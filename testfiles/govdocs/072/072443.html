<P ALIGN="justify">It is realized that the life zone concept is open to
serious criticism when used for intensive studies of small areas, and
that when used for any purpose it may be open to charges of vagueness.
Although the present treatment cannot hope to escape altogether such
charges, an effort has been made to designate the limits of the zones as
definitely as possible.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">It was only after weighing all the factors involved
that the decision was made to describe the Colorado River Basin in terms
of life zones rather than by plant associations comparable to those used
by most ecologists today. The deciding factor was that of
<I>simplicity</I> for the benefit of the average nonscientific reader.
It was believed that loss of critical definition, resulting from the use
of these more generalized zones, would be more than compensated for, in
semipopular treatise, by the reduction in number of classifications.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The life zone map of the Colorado River Basin is like
nearly all maps of large areas that have ever been made, in that no
matter how great has been the expenditure of care and energy to insure
its accuracy, someone more familiar with local areas can discover errors
of various degrees of importance. In the case of the present map, much
less time was available for its preparation than originally had been
anticipated, owing to circumstances beyond the control of the Colorado
River Survey project. In fact, the life zone study never could have been
completed if it had not been for the air surveys, which made possible a
fairly comprehensive coverage of the basin within a period of only 9
months. Even so, the final product would have been much less accurate
had it not been for the generous help, elsewhere acknowledged in full,
of many persons having an extensive technical knowledge of various
parts of the basin.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">As a first step, all available botanical, zoological,
and ecological publications were consulted in order to establish the
average elevation boundaries of all of the life zones in the various
parts of the basin. By no means all of these publications were
specifically concerned with life zones, but since the major plant indicators
and association equivalents of the zones have long been recognized, any
information on the distribution and elevation of these indicators in
various parts of the basin could be translated fairly easily into terms
of life zone boundaries. These preliminary data were summarized as
follows:</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">A transparent tracing-cloth base map of the Colorado
River Basin was laid over the appropriate Regional Aeronautical Charts
(Department of Commerce), which show topographic relief at 1,000-foot
intervals. Provisional life zone boundaries, based on the foregoing
tabulated data, were drawn on the tracing cloth, using the contours
shown on the aeronautical charts as general guidelines. The topographic
accuracy of these charts, which are on a scale of 16 miles to the inch,
is for the most part quite high even for the more remote, unsettled
regions. Contact prints of the completed tracing-cloth map, which
measured 34 by 57 inches, were then taken into the field and compared,
area for area, with conditions on the ground.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Nearly all of the field checking was done in a
two-place light plane at altitudes varying between five hundred and
three thousand feet above ground level. Planes of this type, which can
cruise up to 6 hours without landing and give approximately 16 miles per
gallon of fuel are receiving increasing use in many types of regional
surveys and certainly will have an important and permanent place in such
work.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Corrections were made as carefully as possible on the
field copy of the life zone map while in the air, together with any
pertinent notations. Occasionally the changes also were indicated on a
set of Sectional Aeronautical Charts having a scale of 8 miles to the
inch. Approximately 10,500 linear miles were flown on this
reconnaissance project, which pretty thoroughly covered the basin.
(Plate 2, in pocket.)</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Ground studies are an indispensable supplement to air
surveys and should follow them for purposes of verification, but the air
surveys should come first because they provide at the outset a visual
and mental grasp of the entire region which could be attained only by
months or years of ground work. This is particularly true of large
unfamiliar regions having a rugged and complicated topography which can
be glimpsed only intermittently and at long range by ground travel, but
it holds good in any type of country.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">A disadvantage of air surveys is that some landscape
features, such as potential development sites, appear deceptively small
and are in danger of receiving inadequate consideration. With practice,
however, supplemented by a checkup on the ground, one learns to make the
proper correction for scale. Moreover, the required correction becomes
less as one makes the surveys from lower altitudes.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Other disadvantages of air observation, such as the
impossibility of making stationary observations are relative (light
aircraft usually being easy to maneuver in small circles), and with
practice can be greatly reduced. However, the viewpoint of persons on
the ground with respect to scenery, and the feeling for the type of
recreational use to be made of the area by persons confined to the
ground can best be appreciated while one is on the ground. This probably
represents the most important advantage of ground studies over air
surveys.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The air surveys showed that for many areas the
provisional life zone map was surprisingly correct even in minor
details, which demonstrates the accuracy of the aeronautical charts and
the published ecological studies already mentioned. In a few localities
actual conditions on the ground differed widely from assumed conditions
on which the map had been based. This was particularly true of the Upper
Sonoran Zone in the Little Colorado River Basin, which on the first
draft of the map was taken from the life zone maps of Merriam (1890) and
Swarth (1914) instead of from the altitude table (pp. 220 and 221), with
which the maps were in conflict. These early life zone maps had been
drawn up before the life zone concept had been fully developed and
before detailed studies had been made of this particular basin.
Apparently, these writers based the lower limit of this zone on the
lower limit of the pi&ntilde;on-juniper belt in the basin, but subsequent
studies have shown that this is not the true lower boundary of the zone
in this particular area. Lack of moisture is the operating factor at the
lower boundary of the pi&ntilde;on-juniper belt in the Little Colorado River
Basin, and on the basis of temperature conditions the Upper Sonoran
Zone actually extends to a much lower level in this area, as
demonstrated by the presence of other Upper Sonoran life zone
"indicators" of more elastic moisture requirement.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Some errors were found to have resulted through
having taken data from some of the more recent vegetation type maps, but
these were few. They arose, no doubt, from the physical impossibility
encountered by the type mappers of covering all of the terrain on foot,
which occasionally led to misidentification of distant vegetation
belts.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">By far the commonest source of error in the provisional
map arose from assigning, on the basis of topographic data, a
higher life zone to an isolated mountain region than actually occurred
there. Although special care had been taken to avoid this mistake, the
warming effect of large surrounding desert regions often was even more
extreme than had been anticipated. This was exemplified in the
Kaiparowits Plateau, the Abajo, La Sal, Virgin, New York, Cedar, and
other mountain masses.</P>
