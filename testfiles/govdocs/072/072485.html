In 1991 when Anthony Parisi,                     LYNCH, Circuit Judge.                            _____________<br><br>            II  ("Anthony")  was  nine  years old,  the  Social  Security<br><br>            Administration  reduced  the  amount  he  was  receiving   in<br><br>            dependent child's benefits on  account of his disabled father<br><br>            Anthony  Parisi ("Parisi") from $464 a month to $262 a month.<br><br>            The purported justification for  the reduction is a provision<br><br>            in the Social Security Act ("SSA") that sets a maximum amount<br><br>            that can be paid out  on a single wage earner's account.   If<br><br>            the  benefits paid  on  that account  exceed  the maximum,  a<br><br>            reduction  is required to comply  with the cap.   The cap was<br><br>            exceeded  in this case,  the agency says,  when Parisi's wife<br><br>            (who is not Anthony's  mother and with whom Anthony  does not<br><br>            live)  was  deemed "entitled"  under  one  subsection of  the<br><br>            statute  to spousal  benefits on  Parisi's account.   Another<br><br>            part of the same section of the statute,  however, prohibited<br><br>            any portion  of those  benefits from  actually being paid  to<br><br>            her.  The question is whether those spousal "benefits," which<br><br>            were never actually payable, were properly counted toward the<br><br>            family  maximum  cap.   We conclude  that  they were  not and<br><br>            accordingly  affirm  the  district court's  reversal  of  the<br><br>            agency's determination.<br><br><br>                                I.  Factual Background                                    __________________<br><br>                     While married  to Adriana Parisi,  Anthony Parisi, a<br><br>            fisherman,  had a  child, Anthony  Parisi, II,  with Lorralee<br><br>            Cooney of Gloucester, Massachusetts.   Anthony lives with Ms.<br><br><br>                                         -2-                                          2<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>            Cooney, who has sole custody of him and brings this action on<br><br>            his behalf.<br><br>                     In February 1988, Parisi became disabled, and he and<br><br>            Anthony, as his dependent,  started receiving payments on his<br><br>            account as a wage  earner.1  In 1991, Adriana  Parisi applied<br><br>            for  and became  eligible  for  early retirement  ("old-age")<br><br>            benefits under the SSA based on her own wage-earner's record.<br><br>            By  operation of  the statute,  she was  automatically deemed<br><br>            also  to have applied for and to qualify for spousal benefits            ____<br><br>            on Parisi's account.   See 42  U.S.C.   402(r)(1).   However,                                   ___<br><br>            because the benefits to which Adriana was entitled on her own                                                                      ___<br><br>            account exceeded the spousal benefits for which she qualified<br><br>            on her husband's account, it was determined that she could be<br><br>            paid benefits only on her own account.<br><br>                     The  agency also  decided,  however,  that Adriana's<br><br>            spousal benefits   even though not actually payable to her or<br><br>            anyone  else    still  had to  be  counted toward  the  SSA's<br><br>            statutory  limit (the "family maximum") on benefits available<br><br>            on a single  worker's record.   Because the benefits  Anthony<br><br>            was  already  receiving,  when  combined  with  Parisi's  own<br><br>            benefits  and  Adriana's   (non-payable)  spousal   benefits,<br><br>            exceeded  the  statutory maximum  amount, the  agency reduced<br><br>            Anthony's  dependent  benefits.    Lorralee  Cooney   was  so<br><br>                                            ____________________<br><br>            1.  It  is  undisputed that  Anthony  was  and still  remains<br>            entitled to  receive dependent child's benefits  on the basis<br>            of Parisi's work record.<br><br>                                         -3-                                          3<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>            notified.  On reconsideration at Cooney's request, the agency<br><br>            reaffirmed its decision to reduce Anthony's benefits.<br><br>                     The  agency's  determination   was  appealed  to  an<br><br>            administrative   law  judge   ("ALJ"),  who   concluded  that<br><br>            Adriana's non-payable  spousal benefits should not be counted                                                           ___<br><br>            toward the  family maximum.   The agency  appealed the  ALJ's<br><br>            decision  to  the  Social  Security  Appeals  Council,  which<br><br>            reversed  the  ALJ.    The  Appeals  Council's  decision  was<br><br>            appealed to the district court.  See 42  U.S.C   405(g).  The                                             ___<br><br>            agency  argued  that under  the  plain language  of  the SSA,<br><br>            calculation    of   the    family   maximum    includes   all                                                                      ___<br><br>            "entitlements," not just entitlements  that result in  actual<br><br>            payment.  The  district court disagreed.   It concluded  that<br><br>            the  SSA's "family  maximum"  cap on  benefits  was meant  to<br><br>            include  only  "effective  entitlements"  (entitlements  that<br><br>            result    in   some   actual   payment),   not   "conditional<br><br>            entitlements,"  and  that  because  Adriana  Parisi's spousal<br><br>            benefits were  only conditional (upon her  not being entitled                                ___________<br><br>            to a larger benefit  on her own wage-earner's  account), they<br><br>            were not properly counted toward the family maximum.<br><br><br>                          II.  Relevant Statutory Provisions                               _____________________________<br><br>                     The  two statutory provisions primarily at issue are<br><br>            42 U.S.C.   403(a) and 42 U.S.C.    402(k)(3)(A).  The former<br><br>            contains the "family maximum" provision and the latter is the<br><br>            provision that prevents  Adriana Parisi  from being  actually<br><br><br>                                         -4-                                          4<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>            paid  any  spousal benefits  on  the basis  of  Parisi's work<br><br>            record (which she would otherwise have received under section<br><br>            402(b)(1)).   Section  403(a) provides  in pertinent  part as<br><br>            follows:<br><br>                     . . . [T]he total monthly benefits to  which<br>                     beneficiaries may be entitled under  section<br>                     402 or 423  of this title for a month on the<br>                     basis  of  the  wages  and   self-employment<br>                     income  of  [an]   individual  [wage-earner]<br>                     shall . . . be  reduced as  necessary so  as<br>                     not  to  exceed [the  maximum amount  set by<br>                     statute].<br><br>            42 U.S.C.   403(a)(1).   And section 402(k)(3)(A) provides in<br><br>            relevant part:<br><br>                     If an individual  is entitled to an  old-age<br>                     or  disability  insurance  benefit  for  any<br>                     month and  to  any other  monthly  insurance<br>                     benefit   for   such   month,   such   other<br>                     insurance benefit for such  month, after any<br>                     reduction  . . .  under  section  403(a)  of<br>                     this title,  shall be reduced, but not below<br>                     zero, by an amount equal to  such old-age or<br>                     disability insurance benefit . . . .<br><br>            42 U.S.C.    402(k)(3)(A).<br><br>                     The parties  agree that, because  the monthly amount<br><br>            of Adriana Parisi's  old-age benefits on her  own work record<br><br>            exceeds the amount of  spousal benefits she could be  paid on            _______<br><br>            her    husband's    record    under     section    402(b)(1),<br><br>            section 402(k)(3)(A) has  the result of reducing  to zero the                                                                 ____<br><br>            payable amount of Adriana  Parisi's spousal benefits.  It  is<br><br>            also agreed that Adriana's  own old-age benefits, as  well as<br><br>            Parisi's benefits, are not subject to reduction under section                                   ___<br><br>            403(a).    Thus  the  only  payable  benefits  at  stake  are<br><br><br>                                         -5-                                          5<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>            Anthony's.2  The  statutory issue  is whether  the amount  of<br><br>            "total  monthly  benefits  to  which  beneficiaries   may  be<br><br>            entitled" for  purposes of  section 403(a) must  include what<br><br>            the monthly  amount of Adriana's spousal  benefits would have<br><br>            been under section 402(b)(1) but for the operation of section<br><br>            402(k)(3)(A)  of  the  statute.

The Statutory Language                ______________________<br><br>                     The  agency  claims  that  its  position  is plainly<br><br>            supported  by  two aspects  of the  statutory text:  the term<br><br>            "entitled"  in  section 403(a),  and  the  phrase "after  any<br><br>            reduction   . . .   under    section   403(a)"   in   section<br><br>            402(k)(3)(A).   We conclude that the statutory  text does not<br><br>            support the intuitively troubling result urged by the agency.<br><br>                     The Commissioner of Social Security ("Commissioner")<br><br>            emphasizes that the family maximum is formulated on the basis<br><br>            of entitlement, and that section 403(a) never speaks in terms               ___________<br><br>            of  benefits actually  received.   Thus,  the argument  goes,<br><br>            because subsection  (b)(1)  of  section  402,  considered  in<br><br>            isolation, "entitles" Adriana Parisi  to spousal benefits  on<br><br>            the  basis of her husband's SSA record, such benefits must be<br><br>            included in  the family maximum calculation,  even though the<br><br>            same  section of the statute just a few paragraphs later, see                                                                      ___<br><br>              402(k)(3)(A), operates to render those very benefits wholly<br><br>            non-payable.            ___________<br><br>                     The  Commissioner's   argument  is   strained,   and<br><br>            certainly  not  dictated  by   the  statutory  text's   plain<br><br>            language.  Section 403(a)(1)  of the SSA limits  and requires<br><br>            the reduction  "as necessary" of the  "total monthly benefits<br><br>            to  which beneficiaries  may  be entitled  under section  402                                                       __________________<br><br><br>                                         -7-                                          7<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>            . . . on the basis of the wages and self-employment income of<br><br>            [the  wage-earner, here  Mr.  Parisi]."   42 U.S.C.    403(a)<br><br>            (emphasis  added).   The agency's  claim that  section 403(a)<br><br>            requires the  inclusion of  all "entitlements" in  the family<br><br>            maximum  computation begs  the question  whether  a so-called<br><br>            "entitlement"  created in  one  part of  section 402  that is<br><br>            simultaneously prevented from  yielding any actually  payable<br><br>            benefit  by another  applicable  portion of  section 402  can<br><br>            properly be  deemed an  "entitle[ment] under section  402" at<br><br>            all.3   We doubt that it can.   Indeed, even according to the<br><br>            agency's own regulatory definition, a person is "entitled" to<br><br>            a benefit only when that person "has proven his  or her right<br><br>            to  benefits for  a period  of time."   20  C.F.R.   404.303.<br><br>            Here, Adriana Parisi has "proven"  no right to benefits under                                                                    _____<br><br>            section 402 (taken as a whole) for any period of time.            ___________                        ___<br><br>                     We   need   not   decide,   however,   whether   the<br><br>            Commissioner's understanding  of  the term  "entitlement"  is<br><br>            somehow  supportable,  because  the agency's  argument,  even<br><br>            taken  on its  own terms, does  not carry  the day.

It would seem an unconventional usage at best to say that<br>            Adriana  Parisi is  entitled  to benefits  which the  statute                                ________<br>            clearly disallows in her  case, leaving her with not  even an<br>            expectancy  of receiving them.

Section  403(a) places  a<br><br>            limit  not on entitlements per  se, but rather  on "the total                                       ___  __<br><br>            monthly benefits to which beneficiaries may be entitled under                    ________                                        _____<br><br>            section 402 . . . ."  42 U.S.C.   403(a) (emphases added).  A            ___________<br><br>            natural reading  of this  language suggests that  the primary<br><br>            object of limitation is the "total monthly benefits" produced<br><br>            by the operation  of section 402 as a whole,  and not, as the                                             __________<br><br>            Commissioner  argues, theoretical entitlements created by one<br><br>            fragment  of section  402 considered in  artificial isolation<br><br>            from the rest of that same section, and wholly apart from the<br><br>            benefits that ultimately attach.  Here, the total benefits to                                                              ________<br><br>            which Adriana Parisi might be deemed "entitled" under section<br><br>            402     when that  section is  considered  in its  entirety  <br><br>            amount  to zero.   Hence,  Adriana's putative  benefits under                       ____<br><br>            section  402 could  not possibly  contribute anything  to the<br><br>            family maximum computation under section 403(a).<br><br>                     In addition to requiring an unnatural reading of the<br><br>            statute,  the Commissioner's  argument is  logically unsound.<br><br>            Under the Commissioner's "pure entitlement" approach, section<br><br>            403(a)  is  said to  place  a ceiling  on  pure entitlements,<br><br>            regardless whether  any payable benefits attach  thereto.  If<br><br>            the  total  amount  of  entitlements available  on  a  single                                    ____________<br><br>            worker's record  exceeds the  statutory limit, so  the theory<br><br><br><br>                                         -9-                                          9<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>            goes, a  reduction under section 403(a)  is required, whether<br><br>            the  excess entitlements produce payable benefits or not.  On<br><br>            the other  hand, the Commissioner  simultaneously claims that<br><br>            when  the total  amount of  "entitlements" causes  the family<br><br>            maximum cap to be  exceeded, it is the payable  benefits that                                                   _______  ________<br><br>            are subject to reduction under the statute.  This position is<br><br>            internally inconsistent.   If the thrust of section 403(a) is<br><br>            to  place a limit on entitlements, it is contradictory to say                                 ____________<br><br>            that compliance with the  family maximum cap can be  achieved<br><br>            through a reduction of  payable benefits.  Because  under the                                    _______ ________<br><br>            Commissioner's  logic, an "entitlement"  is entirely separate<br><br>            from the payable benefits (if any) that attach, it would seem<br><br>            to  follow that a reduction  in benefits paid  could never be                                                     ____<br><br>            effective to achieve compliance with the cap.<br><br>                     We conclude that  the Commissioner's contention that<br><br>            section   403(a)   is  concerned   purely   with  theoretical<br><br>            entitlements,  irrespective of  whether any  actually payable<br><br>            benefits attach thereto, is supported neither by the language<br><br>            of the statute nor by reason.<br><br>                     We  also  are  unpersuaded  by   the  Commissioner's<br><br>            argument  to the  extent it  rests on  the phrase  "after any<br><br>            reduction    . . .   under   section   403(a)"   in   section<br><br>            402(k)(3)(A).   The  Commissioner contends  that this  phrase<br><br>            specifically    instructs    that    the   reduction    under<br><br>            section 403(a)  for  compliance   with  the  family   maximum<br><br><br><br>                                         -10-                                          10<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>            provision  be computed  before any  reduction is  taken under                                    ______<br><br>            section 402(k)(3)(A),  and that,  therefore, for  purposes of<br><br>            section  403(a), Adriana  Parisi's  spousal benefits  must be<br><br>            treated (contrary to fact) as if they were fully payable.<br><br>                     The Commissioner  reads  too  much into  the  phrase<br><br>            "after any  reduction . . .  under section 403(a)."   Section<br><br>            402(k)(3)(A) is triggered when  an individual who is entitled<br><br>            to  old-age benefits on  her own  social security  record (as<br><br>            Adriana  is in this case)  is also facially  entitled to some                                          ____<br><br>            other simultaneous benefit (in this case, spousal benefits on<br><br>            Parisi's  account).   In substance, section  402(k)(3)(A) has<br><br>            the  effect  of authorizing  such  an  individual to  receive<br><br>            payment of  the larger of the two  simultaneous benefits, but<br><br>            not  both.4   Thus, section  402(k)(3)(A) requires  comparing<br><br>            the size  of the beneficiary's  "other" benefit with  her own<br><br>            old-age  benefit.   The  "after any  reduction under  section<br><br>            403(a)"  language in  section  402(k)(3)(A) ensures  that, in<br><br>            determining the amount of the "other" simultaneous benefit in<br><br>            question,  the  calculation  will   take  into  account   any<br><br>            reduction  to the  "other"  benefit that  would otherwise  be<br><br>            required  under section  403(a).   This prevents  the old-age<br><br><br>                                            ____________________<br><br>            4.  More precisely, the provision entitles the beneficiary to<br>            payment of  her old-age  benefit plus the  difference between                                             ____<br>            the  "other"  benefit  and   the  old-age  benefit,  if  that<br>            difference is greater than zero.  This is the same  as saying<br>            that  the beneficiary is entitled  to an amount  equal to the<br>            larger of the two simultaneous benefits in question.<br><br>                                         -11-                                          11<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>            beneficiary from receiving, by operation  of the simultaneous<br><br>            benefits  provision,  any  amount  of  benefits   that  would<br><br>            otherwise be excluded as exceeding the cap imposed by section<br><br>            403(a).5<br><br>                     There  is  nothing   in  the  language  of   section<br><br>            402(k)(3)(A) or  section 403(a), however, that  dictates that<br><br>            the family  maximum computation cannot take  into account the<br><br>            fact that  an entitlement  that would normally  contribute to<br><br>            the  family maximum  amount  has  been  reduced  to  zero  by<br><br>            operation of  the simultaneous benefits  provision of section<br><br>            402(k)(3)(A).  It is true that the computation required under<br><br>            section  402(k)(3)(A)  requires  a provisional  determination<br><br>            whether  the  "other" simultaneous  benefit  (here, Adriana's<br><br>            spousal benefits) would, if  payable, be subject to reduction<br><br>            under section 403(a).  But this computation is only necessary<br><br>            for the  purpose  of  determining what  portion  of  the  two<br><br>            simultaneous  benefits the beneficiary  (Adriana) is entitled<br><br>            to receive.   There is  no language in  section 402(k)(3)(A),<br><br>            and  certainly  not in  section  403(a),  requiring that  the<br><br><br>                                            ____________________<br><br>            5.  Suppose,   for   example,    that   a   beneficiary    is<br>            simultaneously entitled to receive her own old-age benefit of<br>            amount  B and a  spousal benefit of  amount S.   Suppose also<br>            that if the spousal benefit were payable, the family  maximum<br>            cap would be exceeded,  and the spousal benefit (S)  would be<br>            reduced by the  amount of the statutory  reduction, to amount<br>            S(r).    The  "after   any  reduction"  language  in  section<br>            402(k)(3)(A)  ensures that  the beneficiary  will receive  an<br>            amount equal  to the larger  of B and  the reduced S(r),  not                                                                      ___<br>            simply the larger of B and S.<br><br>                                         -12-                                          12<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>            family maximum  computation ignore the actual  results of the                                        ______<br><br>            simultaneous benefits determination of section 402(k)(3)(A).<br><br>                     To the contrary, the statutory language  suggests an<br><br>            interplay  between  section 403(a)  and  section 402(k)(3)(A)<br><br>            that  belies  the  position  advanced  by  the  Commissioner.<br><br>            Section 403(a)  requires only such "reduc[tion]  as necessary                                                             ____________<br><br>            so as not to  exceed" the family maximum.   The determination<br><br>            of whether a reduction is necessary in this case depends upon<br><br>            the  calculation of  the  "total monthly  benefits" to  which<br><br>            Adriana Parisi "may  be entitled  under section  402" on  the<br><br>            basis of her husband's SSA record.  As explained, that amount<br><br>            is  zero.    Hence,  the relevant  "total  monthly  benefits"                ____<br><br>            available under section 402 on Parisi's work record (combined<br><br>            with  Parisi's  own benefits)  do  not  exceed the  statutory<br><br>            ceiling.  It cannot be "necessary," then, to reduce Anthony's<br><br>            benefits.<br><br>                     We  conclude that  the Commissioner's  position does<br><br>            not follow  from the  plain language of  section 402(k)(3)(A)<br><br>            and section 403(a).<br><br><br>            B.  Legislative History                ___________________<br><br>                     As the district court  observed, the  interpretation<br><br>            urged  by the  Commissioner produces  a result  that Congress<br><br>            apparently   sought  to   avoid.     The  most   illuminating<br><br>            legislative  comments  are  found   in  connection  with  the<br><br><br><br><br>                                         -13-                                          13<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>            enactment of the  1949 amendments to  the SSA, which  changed<br><br>            the previously existing family maximum provision:<br><br>                     Under the  present  law,  the total  of  the<br>                     family benefits  for a  month is reduced  to<br>                     the  maximum  permitted by  section [403(a)]<br>                     prior  to any  deductions on  account of the<br>                     occurrence of  any  event specified  in  the<br>                     law . . . .  Section [403(a)] as amended  by<br>                     the   bill   reverses  this   procedure  and<br>                     provides that  the  reduction in  the  total<br>                     benefits for  a month  is to  be made  after<br>                     the deductions.   As a result, larger family<br>                     benefits will be payable in many cases.<br><br>            S. Rep. No. 1669,  81st Cong., 2d Sess.

After  this statement,  the<br><br>            Senate  Report set forth a hypothetical scenario illustrating<br><br>            that  under  the amendments  to  section  403(a), the  family<br><br>            maximum provision  would not operate to reduce  a child's SSA<br><br>            benefits on account of  a family member's nominal entitlement<br><br>            to benefits that are not actually payable.

The   agency's  reading   of  the   statute  is<br><br>            inconsistent with that intent.<br><br><br>            C.  Regulatory Language                ___________________<br><br>                     Our     conclusion    that     the    Commissioner's<br><br>            interpretation of  the statute is inconsistent  with both its<br><br>            text and intended effect  suffices, under Chevron, to obviate                                                      _______<br><br>            any requirement of  deference to the agency's  position.

We add,            _______________________________<br><br>            however, as  a  capstone to  our  analysis, that  the  Social<br><br>            Security Administration's  own regulations are  at odds  with<br><br>            its  proposed construction  of the  statute.   The regulation<br><br>            that  describes generally  the effect  of the  family maximum<br><br>            provision explains its operation in this way:<br><br>                     Family Maximum.   As explained in   404.403,                     ______________<br>                     there  is  a  maximum  amount  set  for each<br>                     insured   person's  earnings   record   that<br>                     limits the  total benefits  payable on  that                                 _______________________<br>                     record.  If you are entitled  to benefits as<br>                     the  insured's  dependent or  survivor, your<br>                     benefits  may   be  reduced  to  keep  total                                                            _____<br>                     benefits  payable  to  the insured's  family                     _________________<br>                     within these limits.<br><br>            20 C.F.R.   404.304(d) (emphasis added).  The regulation that<br><br>            more  specifically  describes  the operation  of  the  family<br><br>            maximum provision contains similar language:<br><br>                     The Social  Security Act  limits the  amount<br>                     of  monthly benefits  that can  be  paid for                                 ____________________________<br>                     any  month  based  on  the  earnings  of  an<br>                     insured individual.<br><br>            20 C.F.R.   404.403(a)(1) (emphasis added).<br><br>                     The agency's  own  interpretative  regulations  thus<br><br>            interpret the family maximum  provision as operating to limit<br><br>            the  "amount  of  benefits that  can  be  paid"  on a  single                                                      ____<br><br>            worker's account.  They do not state that section 403(a) caps<br><br>            the total amount of  entitlements that might be available  on                                 ____________<br><br>            an   account.    That  the  agency  has  chosen  in  its  own<br><br>            regulations  to  describe the  family  maximum  as placing  a<br><br>            ceiling on  benefits paid or  payable casts further  doubt on                                 ____     _______<br><br><br>                                         -15-                                          15<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>            its  contention here  that section  403(a) is  concerned with<br><br>            capping  pure  entitlements,  regardless  of  the  amount  of                                          __________<br><br>            payable benefits that attach.<br><br>                     To  similar  effect is  language  contained  in  the<br><br>            agency's   written   rulings   on   Anthony's   benefits   as<br><br>            communicated to  Lorralee Cooney.   In the first  letter from<br><br>            the Social  Security Administration  to Cooney  notifying her<br><br>            that  her  son's  benefits  were to  be  reduced,  the agency<br><br>            explained that the reduction was required because the statute<br><br>            imposes  a "limit  on how  much we can  pay on  each person's                                                    ___<br><br>            Social  Security record [emphasis  added]."  And  later, in a<br><br>            letter    reaffirming    its    initial     decision    after<br><br>            reconsideration, the  agency informed Cooney that  the family<br><br>            maximum provision  "limits the  total amount of  the benefits<br><br>            payable on an individual's earnings record."            _______<br><br>                     The regulations  and agency statements quoted  above<br><br>            support  the  conclusion  we  adopt here,  namely,  that  the<br><br>            "family  maximum"  provision of  section  403(a) operates  to<br><br>            limit  only  those  benefits that  are  payable  on a  single                                                    _______<br><br>            worker's account.<br><br><br>            D.  Policy Considerations                _____________________<br><br>                     We  observe,  finally,  that  the  purported  policy<br><br>            reasons offered in support of the Commissioner's construction<br><br>            of the statute lack persuasive force.<br><br><br><br><br>                                         -16-                                          16<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>                     The agency says its  position prevents families from<br><br>            receiving duplicative  or excessive benefits.   In this case,<br><br>            the  Commissioner  asserts,  applying section 403(a)  in  the<br><br>            manner suggested would  have the effect  of making the  total<br><br>            amount  of benefits  payable  to the  "family unit"  (Parisi,<br><br>            Anthony,  and Adriana)  roughly  the same  as  it was  before<br><br>            Adriana became entitled to receive her own old-age benefits.<br><br>                     The problem with  this rationale is twofold.  First,<br><br>            the family maximum provision (despite its common appellation)<br><br>            is written not as  a broad limitation upon the  amount that a                       ___<br><br>            family  unit can receive in total SSA benefits, but rather as<br><br>            a specific  limitation upon the amount  of benefits available<br><br>            on the  basis of  a single  worker's record.   See 20  C.F.R.                                                           ___<br><br>              404.403(a)(1)  (explaining  that  section  403(a)  places a<br><br>            maximum "for  each person's  earnings record that  limits the<br><br>            total benefits  payable  on that  record" (emphasis  added)).                                     _______________<br><br>            Adriana "earned" her old age  benefits through her own  years<br><br>            in the work force,  not because she  was the wife of  Parisi.<br><br>            The question under section 403(a) is not whether the family's                                                                 ______<br><br>            benefits  have  exceeded a  certain  level,  but whether  the<br><br>            benefits  payable  on  a single  wage-earner's  account  have<br><br>            exceeded the statutory maximum.<br><br>                     Second, the agency's suggestion  that the  reduction<br><br>            of benefits  to Anthony prevents duplicative  payments to the<br><br>            "family  unit" rings hollow.   Anthony lives with his natural<br><br><br><br>                                         -17-                                          17<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>            mother, not with  Adriana and  Parisi.  The  agency does  not<br><br>            suggest that  any portion  of Adriana's or  Parisi's benefits<br><br>            reaches the child.   The agency's statement  that "the family<br><br>            unit  continues  to receive  approximately  the same  overall<br><br>            benefits as  it did before"  thus distorts reality.  In fact,<br><br>            under the agency's interpretation, Anthony receives only half<br><br>            the benefits he was receiving before; and because neither the<br><br>            father's  nor Adriana  Parisi's own  benefits are  subject to<br><br>            reduction under  the family maximum provision, it is only the                                                                 ____<br><br>            child who has been adversely affected  by the agency's action<br><br>            in this case.<br><br>                     The other purported  policy justification offered in<br><br>            defense of  the Commissioner's position is  that reduction of<br><br>            the child's benefits in  this case is required to  uphold the<br><br>            meaning  of  "entitlement."   The Commissioner  contends that<br><br>            because section 403(a) places  a limit on "entitlements," and<br><br>            because  Adriana Parisi  is  "entitled" to  spousal  benefits<br><br>            under  one  subsection  of  the statute  (even  though  those<br><br>            benefits  are not  payable),  failure to  include those  non-<br><br>            payable  benefits in the family maximum tally will dilute the<br><br>            meaning of "entitlement" under the SSA.<br><br>                     We find  this reasoning  unpersuasive.   The flaw in<br><br>            this  argument is the same  as the flaw  underlying its plain<br><br>            meaning argument:  it incorrectly assumes that section 403(a)<br><br>            is concerned  with  keeping  pure  "entitlements"  under  the<br><br><br><br>                                         -18-                                          18<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>            statutory limit.   To the  contrary, as  we concluded  above,<br><br>            section 403(a)  operates  in this  case  to limit  the  total<br><br>            amount of  benefits payable on a  single wage-earner's record                       ________ _______<br><br>            under the relevant benefits provisions (read as a whole), not<br><br>            to  limit  entitlements  theoretically  available  under  one<br><br>            subsection of the statute considered in artificial isolation.<br><br>            In   any  event,   although  this   conclusion  negates   the<br><br>            Commissioner's  claim  that   Adriana  Parisi's   non-payable<br><br>            spousal  benefits  must be  included  in  the family  maximum<br><br>            calculation,   it   does    not   directly   undermine    the<br><br>            Commissioner's purported definition of "entitlement,"  nor is<br><br>            it  necessarily inconsistent  with saying  here  that Adriana<br><br>            Parisi  has,  in some  abstract  sense,  an "entitlement"  to<br><br>            spousal benefits  under section  402(b)(1) read  in isolation<br><br>            from the rest  of section 402.   We hold only  that Adriana's<br><br>            non-payable spousal benefits do  not count toward the section<br><br>            403(a) "family maximum."<br><br><br>            E.  Conclusion                __________<br><br>                     We  conclude   that  the   Commissioner's   proposed<br><br>            construction  of  section  403(a)  is not  supported  by  the<br><br>            language of the statute, is logically flawed, is inconsistent<br><br>            with  the  statute's  intended  effect, is  contrary  to  the<br><br>            agency's own interpretative regulations, and is not supported<br><br>            by  any sound considerations  of policy.   Accordingly, we do<br><br>            not defer to the Commissioner's position under the principles<br><br><br>                                         -19-                                          19<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>            of Chevron, and we hold that section 403(a) operates to limit               _______<br><br>            the total  amount of  benefits actually payable  on a  single                                                    _______<br><br>            worker's record, not the amount of entitlements theoretically<br><br>            available.6<br><br>                     In this case, because Adriana Parisi's "entitlement"<br><br>            under section 402(b)(1) to  spousal benefits on Parisi's work<br><br>            record  produces zero  payable benefits  as a  result  of the                             ____  _______<br><br>            operation  of  section  402(k)(3)(A),  no such  benefits  are<br><br>            included  in the  computation required  under section 403(a).<br><br>            Consequently,  the total  amount of  benefits payable  on the<br><br>            basis of  Parisi's work  record does not  exceed the  maximum<br><br>            imposed  by  the  statute,  and it  is  not  "necessary"  for<br><br>            purposes of section 403(a) to reduce Anthony's benefits.  The<br><br>            district court correctly reversed  the decision of the Social<br><br>            Security Appeals Council.<br><br><br><br>                     Affirmed.                     ________<br><br><br><br><br>                                            ____________________<br><br>            6.  Our reasoning differs from  that employed by the district<br>            court.   The district  court's analysis distinguished between<br>            "effective"   and   "conditional"    entitlements.       This<br>            distinction, although sensible, has no roots in the statutory<br>            language.   We  rely, instead,  on  the notion  that  section<br>            403(a) places  a limit  not  upon non-payable  "entitlements"<br>            created  by  an  isolated subsection  of  the  SSA,  but upon<br>            payable benefits    in this case, the  total benefits yielded<br>            by  section 402 of the SSA  read as a whole.   This notion is<br>            semantically supported by the  statutory framework and by the<br>            agency's own  regulations, which speak  specifically in terms<br>            of payable benefits (e.g., 20 C.F.R.   404.304(d)).               _______ ________  ____<br><br>                                         -20-                                          20<br><br><br><br><br><br><br></pre>
