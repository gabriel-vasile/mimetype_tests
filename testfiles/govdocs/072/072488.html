<h1>AR 97-1 (1): <i>Parisi By Cooney v. Chater</i>, 69 F.3d 614 (1st Cir. 
1995) -- Reduction of Benefits Under the Family Maximum In Cases Involving 
Dual Entitlement--Title II of the Social Security Act.</h1>
<h2>Issue:</h2>
 <p>
Whether, in determining the amount of benefit reduction under the maximum 
family benefits provision in section 203(a) of the Social Security Act 
(the Act) in cases where a beneficiary is entitled to benefits on more 
than one earnings record, only those monthly benefits payable on the 
worker's earnings record after application of the simultaneous benefit 
provisions are included in calculating the total monthly benefits payable 
on that record. </p>

<h2>Circuit:</h2>
 <p>
First (Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Puerto Rico).</p>
<p align="center">
<i>Parisi By Cooney v. Chater, 69 F.3d 614 (1st Cir. 1995).</i></p>
<h2>Applicability of Ruling:</h2>
 <p>
This Ruling applies to determinations or decisions at all administrative 
levels (i.e., initial, reconsideration, Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) 
hearing or Appeals Council).</p>
<h2>Description of Case:</h2>
 <p>
Anthony Parisi, the worker, became disabled in February 1988. He and 
Anthony Parisi II, his dependent child and the plaintiff in this case, 
began receiving Social Security benefits on Anthony Parisi's earnings 
record. In 1991, Adriana Parisi, the worker's spouse, became entitled to 
retirement benefits (old-age benefits) based on her own earnings record. 
Under section 202(r) of the Act, Adriana was deemed also to have applied 
for and become entitled to wife's benefits based on the worker's earnings 
record. The Social Security Administration (SSA) determined under section 
202(k)(3)(A) of the Act that because the monthly retirement benefits that 
Adriana was entitled to receive on her own record exceeded the amount of 
her monthly wife's benefits on Anthony Parisi's earnings record, she could 
only receive payment for the retirement benefits payable on her own 
earnings record.</p>
<p>
SSA counted the wife's benefits to which Adriana was entitled, but which 
were not actually paid to her, toward the monthly maximum amount of 
benefits payable on Anthony Parisi's earnings record under section 203(a) 
of the Act (the family maximum). Because the total monthly amount of 
Anthony's disability benefits, the plaintiff's child's benefits, and 
Adriana's wife's benefits exceeded the monthly family maximum limit, SSA 
reduced the amount of the plaintiff's and the wife's monthly benefits.</p>
<p>
The plaintiff's request for reconsideration of the benefit reduction was 
denied, and he requested a hearing before an ALJ. The ALJ found that 
Adriana's wife's benefits should not be counted toward the family maximum. 
However, the Appeals Council reversed the ALJ's decision and the plaintiff 
appealed to the district court. The district court found that the family 
maximum limit on monthly benefits was meant to include only "effective 
entitlements" that result in actual payment of benefits. Because Adriana's 
entitlement to wife's benefits was only "conditional" upon her not being 
entitled to a greater amount of monthly benefits on her own earnings 
record, the district court concluded that Adriana's wife's benefits should 
not be counted toward the family maximum. SSA appealed and the United 
States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, while offering somewhat 
different reasoning, found that the district court correctly reversed the 
Appeals Council's decision.</p>
<h2>Holding:</h2>
 <p>
After reviewing the statutory language in sections 203(a) and 202(k)(3)(A) 
of the Act, the legislative history, SSA's regulations and policy 
considerations, the Court of Appeals held that "Adriana's non-payable 
spousal benefits d[id] not count toward the section [2]03(a) 'family 
maximum' . . . [because] section [2]03(a) operates to limit the total 
amount of benefits actually payable on a single worker's record, not the 
amount of entitlements theoretically available." The court further held 
that because Adriana's deemed entitlement to wife's benefits resulted in 
"zero payable benefits" under section 202(k)(3)(A) of the Act, none of her 
benefits should be included in the family maximum computation required 
under section 203(a).</p>
<p>
Without reviewing SSA's definition of "entitlement," the court reasoned 
that, if SSA was correct in arguing that section 203(a) of the Act places 
a limit on entitlements, it would be contradictory and impossible to 
enforce compliance with the family maximum cap by reducing payable 
benefits. The court held that section 203(a) of the Act requires SSA to 
consider the actual amount of benefits payable under the relevant benefits 
provisions (read as a whole), not purely theoretical entitlements, in 
calculating the total monthly benefits payable on the worker's earnings 
record. The court noted that its conclusion did not undermine SSA's 
definition of "entitlement" and that Adriana had entitlement, in an 
abstract way, to wife's benefits under section 202(b)(1) of the 
Act.<a name="fnr1" href="#fn1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>
<p>
The court also held that the statutory language requires that monthly 
benefits be reduced under the family maximum only as much "<i>as 
necessary</i>" to enforce compliance and that, because the reduction in 
Parisi's case depended on the calculation of Adriana's wife's benefits, 
which amounted to zero due to her simultaneous entitlement to a higher 
benefit on her own earnings record, a reduction was not necessary. 
Accordingly, the court concluded that the total amount of benefits payable 
on the worker's record did not exceed the family maximum and that 
Anthony's child's benefits should not be reduced.</p>
<h2>Statement As To How <i>Parisi</i> Differs From Social Security 
Policy</h2>
<p>
Section 203(a) of the Act establishes a limit, derived from the worker's 
primary insurance amount, on the total monthly benefits to which 
dependents or survivors may be entitled on the basis of one worker's 
earnings record (the family maximum). Under SSA's regulations implementing 
section 203(a) of the Act (20 CFR 404.403 and 404.404), the benefits of 
each claimant entitled on a worker's earnings record are reduced 
proportionately so that the total benefits of those entitled on the record 
in one month do not exceed the family maximum. In calculating total 
monthly benefits, SSA includes all benefits of the claimants who are 
entitled on the worker's record without considering whether the benefits 
are actually due or payable.</p>
<p>
The <i>Parisi</i> court held that, when computing a reduction under the 
family maximum pursuant to section 203(a) of the Act, SSA should not 
include the monthly benefit that would otherwise be payable to the spouse 
if payment of that spouse's benefit is precluded by section 202(k)(3)(A) 
of the Act due to the spouse's simultaneous entitlement to a higher 
benefit on the spouse's own earnings record.</p>
<h2>Explanation of How SSA Will Apply The <i>Parisi</i> Decision Within 
The Circuit</h2>
<p>
This Ruling applies only to cases involving claimants whose benefits are 
reduced because of the family maximum and who reside in Maine, New 
Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island or Puerto Rico at the time of the 
determination or decision at any administrative level, i.e., initial, 
reconsideration, ALJ hearing or Appeals Council.</p>
<p>
When the total benefits due or payable for any month on the earnings 
record of a worker exceed the maximum amount under section 203(a) of the 
Act (the family maximum applies) and a person entitled on the worker's 
earnings record is simultaneously entitled to benefits on another earnings 
record, SSA will consider only the amount of monthly dependent's or 
survivor's benefits actually due or payable to the simultaneously-entitled 
person when determining the amount of the benefit reduction because of the 
family maximum. Adjudicators will continue to apply SSA's other policies 
for applying and calculating the family maximum reduction.</p>
<hr>
<p>
<a name="fn1" href="#fnr1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> The First Circuit's 
reasoning differed from the district court's analysis that distinguished 
between "effective" and "conditional" entitlements. The court held that 
this distinction had "no roots in the statutory language."</p>
