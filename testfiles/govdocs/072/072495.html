<p>U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION</p>

<p>Litigation Release No. 16295 / September 27, 1999</p></h1>
<p>SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION V. CHARLES F. PARISI, Civil Action
No. 99CV 2079B (RBB) (S.D. Cal.)</p>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a Complaint in federal
district court in San Diego against Charles F. Parisi (&quot;Parisi&quot;) for
violating an administrative order issued by the Commission in July 1992. At that
time, the Commission barred Parisi from associating with any investment adviser
or investment company with the right to reapply to the Commission for permission
to be so associated after one year. He never reapplied.</p>
<p>The Complaint filed today alleges that for nearly five years following the
1992 bar Order, Parisi violated the Order by associating with Palladian
Advisers, Inc. (the &quot;Adviser&quot;), an investment adviser, and the
Palladian Trust (the &quot;Trust&quot;), an investment company. The Complaint
alleges that Parisi associated with these entities by, among other things:
financing them; using others to conceal his association with the entities;
holding himself out as a representative of the entities; helping select Trust
portfolio managers; participating in Trust board meetings; and receiving
compensation based on sales of investments in the Trust. The Complaint seeks an
injunction and civil penalties against Parisi for violating the bar Order and
Section 203(f) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.</p>
<p>In a related action, the Commission today instituted and simultaneously
settled an administrative proceeding against Harry Michael Schwartz
(&quot;Schwartz&quot;), Parisi's long-time employee. In the Order, the
Commission finds that Schwartz, while president of an investment adviser and
investment company, allowed his employer to associate with these entities for
nearly five years, even though during such time his employer was barred from
associating with any investment adviser or investment company. The Order also
alleges that Schwartz caused the entities to engage in disclosure and unlawful
borrowing violations. While neither admitting nor denying the Commission's
findings, Schwartz consented to the entry of an order requiring that he: (1) be
suspended from associating with any investment adviser or investment company for
12 months; (2) cease and desist from committing and/or causing violations of
Sections 203(f), 206(1), (2), and (4) of the Advisers Act and Rule
206(4)-4(a)(1) thereunder, and Section 34(b) of the Investment Company Act of
1940; and (3) pay a civil money penalty of $10,000. (In the Matter of Harry
Michael Schwartz, Rel. No. IA-1833)</p>
