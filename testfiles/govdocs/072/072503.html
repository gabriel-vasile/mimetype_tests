<p><br><b>THE BRITISH CARIBBEAN</b></p>
<p>A SURVEY OF RECENT PUBLICATIONS indicates that interest in the British Caribbean 
  remains healthy. Despite considerable variation in the areas and themes covered, 
  some of the most important scholarly contributions center on immigration of 
  East Indians and Chinese in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with the 
  more useful publications covering the earlier period. Ordahl Kupperman, for 
  example, offers a rich portrait of the early settlers on Providence Island who 
  strove unsuccessfully to create a thriving colony that would have matched the 
  mainland Puritan colonies (item bi 94012312). 
</p>
<p>As in past volumes of the <i>Handbook,</i> slavery continues to provide serious 
  and important discourse for a number of scholars. Stinchcombe invokes social 
  theory to explain why sugar planters needed and sometimes created repressive 
  governments to recruit plantation labor (item bi 96011028). Placing Caribbean 
  slavery and emancipation within the larger world context, he concludes that 
  freedom was not necessarily a means of achieving the goals of the Enlightenment 
  but rather another method of social control. This important work will undoubtedly 
  stimulate considerable debate among slave studies scholars in the foreseeable 
  future. Viotti da Costa's sophisticated work constitutes the most thorough examination 
  to date of the factors surrounding the slave revolt and subsequent martyrdom 
  of Reverend John Smith (item bi 96011023). Sheridan points to the harsh conditions 
  that slaves in the British Windward Islands endured at a crucial period in the 
  expansion of the plantation economy (item bi 94005195). While noting the important 
  role white women played in slave societies of the US South, Beckles calls for 
  serious inquiries into their contributions to Caribbean slave societies (item 
  bi 94007930).
</p>
<p>Nineteenth-century post-slavery adjustments and tensions are addressed in some 
  excellent works. Heuman provides fresh insights into an important episode in 
  Jamaica's social and political history, when growing disagreements between planters 
  and workers led to the declaration of martial law, bloody suppression of the 
  &quot;insurrectionists,&quot; and ultimately the imposition of Crown Colony 
  government (item bi 96011027). Butler discusses the impact of compensated emancipation 
  on credit, landownership, finance, and trade (item bi 96011025). While her conclusion 
  that West India Interest inflated its claims about the disastrous impact that 
  emancipation made on their holdings is hardly novel, Butler's study casts light 
  on the increasing availability of credit, the involvement of women in plantation 
  ownership, and the differences in the plight of Jamaican and Barbadian planters. 
  Finally, Wilmot (item bi 94005398) and Craton (item bi 94015198) address the 
  experiences and expressed priorities of ex-slaves amidst planter attempts to 
  ensure there was an adequate supply of laborers for the demands of plantation 
  agriculture.
</p>
<p>Importation of workers from overseas was a frequent device that planters in 
  some islands employed to augment their labor supply. Look Lai's magisterial 
  study deserves special mention for its sophisticated treatment of the importation 
  and working conditions of Asians into the region (item bi 94000809). Laurence's 
  work, though somewhat more limited in scope, is equally important and contains 
  excellent tables of importation statistics and other information (item bi 96011026).
</p>
<p>A number of fine studies address the contributions of these newer immigrants 
  to the political economy of the host countries. Ramsaran provides a penetrating 
  analysis of the remarkable growth in the mid- and late-20th century of the important 
  East Indian business community in Trinidad (item bi 94012335), while Kartick 
  discusses the unsuccessful attempt of Chinese immigrants to achieve self-sufficiency 
  in British Guiana (item bi 94007411). Both Kelvin Singh (item bi 95007247) and 
  H.P. Singh (item bi 95007246) concentrate on the political strivings of East 
  Indians amidst the racial tensions of Trinidad's multi-ethnic society. Finally, 
  Mudd (item bi 94012314) and Menezes (item bi 94007403) remind us of the important 
  contributions, especially in agriculture and mercantile activities, that East 
  Indians made to the economic life of two colonies.
</p>
<p>Bolland skillfully presents an excellent overview of the political disturbances 
  that spread throughout the British Caribbean in the 1930s as a result of severe 
  economic problems that adversely affected the disenfranchised workers (item 
  bi 96011024). Walker-Kilkenny examines specific strike action in British Guiana 
  (item bi 94015106), while Woolford deals artfully with the career of a Guyanese 
  trade union leader and politician whose activism was spurred by labor discontent 
  (item bi 94001512).
</p>
<p>Finally, one of the most fascinating works reviewed this biennium on the modern 
  period is authored by Fraser (item bi 95007242), who argues that US involvement 
  in the British Caribbean did not begin in the 1960s-70s, but rather, much earlier, 
  when the emergence of nationalist movements in the region led to British withdrawal 
  and American assertion of hegemony. [ELC]</p>
<p><br><b>THE FRENCH AND DANISH CARIBBEAN</b></p>
<p>Three studies utilizing sophisticated methods of social analysis clarify our 
  understanding of slave societies in the French Caribbean and French Guiana. 
  Geggus furthers our knowledge of French slaves by looking systematically at 
  the sex ratios, age, and ethnicity of those who left Africa and worked on plantations 
  (item bi 96012466). Garrigus links the rise of a free-colored planter class 
  in Saint-Domingue both to the dynamics of merchant economies on the periphery 
  and to an official policy of race-recasting (item bi 96012431). Branson traces 
  the history of 1,300 Saint-Domingue refugees - masters and slaves, men and women 
  - in Philadelphia in the early 1800s (item bi 96012339). Mass labor migrations 
  to the Caribbean are reassessed by three studies: Gemery and Horn (item bi 94008990) 
  and Huetz de Lemps (item bi 96012255) examine 17th-century indentured servitude, 
  while Renard covers the East Indian and African indentured servants in 19th-century 
  Martinique and Guadeloupe (item bi 94008430). 
</p>
<p>In <i>HLAS 54</i> we signalled the growing attention to small islands in the interstices 
  of imperial powers. This trend is confirmed by in-depth research on the 18th-century 
  plantation economy, land use and technology, ethnic composition, and culture 
  in Henri and Denise Parisis' &quot;Le si&egrave;cle du sucre &agrave; Saint-Martin 
  fran&ccedil;ais&quot; (item bi 95004790) and Tyson's &quot;Cotton plantations 
  of St. Croix&quot; (item bi 93025056), beautifully matched by Hopkins' study 
  of map-making (item bi 95020495). Pointing toward the same environmental history 
  is Huyghues-Belrose's creative essay on the seaboard of French Guiana, drawing 
  from archaeological, archival, and aerial records (item bi 95011444). 
</p>
<p>Of all periods, the 19th century is best represented in the works annotated 
  below, in particular for Guadeloupe. Meinier has documented how Guadeloupe's 
  first qualified midwives confronted the male medical establishment (item bi 
  95004883). Dominique Taffin's reconstitution of a devastating cholera epidemic 
  provides an unusual window on its post-emancipation society and is a good example 
  of innovative cultural history (item bi 95004885). The centrality of sugar in 
  the political economy of 19th-century French Lesser Antilles is best illuminated 
  by Schnackenbourg's study of Ernest Souques, the first biography of Guadeloupe's 
  most powerful <i>sucrier</i> and political &quot;boss&quot; (item bi 96013170), and 
  Buffon's &quot;L'affaire Z&eacute;vallos,&quot; on the first self-management 
  experience of socialist workers in a <i>centrale</i> (item bi 96013516). In addition, 
  both Buffon and Schnackenbourg describe the colonial banks which presided over 
  the sugar economy of Guadeloupe and Martinique for a century (items bi 94007481 
  and bi 95004884). Corvington's last addition to his multi-volume work shows 
  the Haitian capital in the 19th century asserting its political primacy and 
  achieving its spatial boundaries and distinctive culture (item bi 94012882).
</p>
<p>Contemporary history makes a breakthrough with three studies. Chathuant analyzes 
  the intricacies of the island's domestic and international policies during World 
  War II, and its political culture under the spell of a collaborationist ideology 
  (item bi 95004881). Donet-Vincent shows how France's infamous penal colonies 
  in French Guiana ended (item bi 94012877). Mam-Lam-Fouck's <i>Histoire de la Guyane 
  contemporaine, 1940-1982)</i> covers <i>d&eacute;partementalisation</i> after the war, 
  its modernization policy, new political deal, and quiet demographic revolution 
  (item bi 94012876).
</p>
<p>High standards in local history have been set by Lafleur's comprehensive monograph 
  on Saint-Claude, one of Guadeloupe's oldest settlements (item bi 96010919). 
  In &quot;Histoire et identit&eacute; des Antilles fran&ccedil;aises,&quot; P&eacute;rotin-Dumon 
  analyzes a century of historiography, from romanticism and positivism to the 
  plantation society paradigm (item bi 96001724). An authoritative edition of 
  Thomas Madiou, the founder of Haiti's national history, is a testimony to the 
  scholarly capacity to overcome society's odds (item bi 95009220). [APD and JG] 
</p>
<p><br><b>THE DUTCH CARIBBEAN</b></p>
<p>Scholarly interest in plantations and slavery has continued unabated and has 
  resulted in a number of important essays, most notably those by Oostindie (item 
  bi 94015187) and Van Stipriaan (item bi 96012619), both published in English. 
  Two important Dutch-language contributions on Suriname's slave and plantation 
  systems by these same authors, Oostindie's <i>Roosenburg en Mon Bijou</i> (see <i>HLAS 
  52:1572</i>) and Van Stipriaan's <i>Surinaams contrast</i> (see <i>HLAS 54:2106</i>), have 
  unfortunately not yet been translated into English.
</p>
<p>The recent political past of Suriname has also generated a number of publications, 
  many of which were included in the most recent social sciences volume, <i>HLAS 
  55.</i> Dew's <i>The trouble in Suriname</i> chronicles events from its 1975 independence 
  to 1993 (see <i>HLAS 55:3089</i>). More analytical are two essays by Gary Brana-Shute, 
  one covering the same period (&quot;Suriname: A Military and its Auxiliaries,&quot; 
  see <i>HLAS 55:3087</i>) and the other the Amerindian insurgency in Suriname's interior 
  (&quot;An Inside-Out Insurgency,&quot; see <i>HLAS 55:782</i>), and one by Sedoc-Dahlberg 
  on the transition to democracy (&quot;Suriname: the Politics of Transition from 
  Authoritarianism to Democracy, 1988-1992,&quot; see <i>HLAS 55:3093</i>). Meel's 
  article goes back further in time and discusses the late 1950s and early 1960s, 
  arguing that this was the period when Suriname could and should have become 
  independent (&quot;Verbroederingspolitiek en Nationalisme,&quot; see <i>HLAS 55:3092</i>). 
  Two legal scholars, Munneke and Van Aller, look at the political history and 
  constitutional and administrative future of The Netherlands Antilles and Aruba. 
  In <i>Van kolonie tot Koninkrijksdeel</i> (item bi 96012020), Van Aller describes 
  the political evolution of the islands, while in <i>Ambtsuitoefening en onafhankelijke 
  controle in de Nederlandse Antillen en Aruba</i>, Munneke emphasizes the importance 
  of administrative reforms to improve democratic control (see <i>HLAS 55:3077</i>).
</p>
<p>The two most physically attractive books are by architects and discuss the 
  buildings and lay-out of Saba and Willemstad, the capital of Cura&ccedil;ao. 
  Buddingh' not only relates the architectural history of the area first settled 
  by the Dutch and the synagoge Mikv&eacute;-Isra&euml;l-Emanuel, but also provides 
  an account of social life in early 18th-century Willemstad (item bi 96011257). 
  Brugman uses Saba as a case study to call for more and better maintenance and 
  preservation projects in the Caribbean (item bi 96011258). [RH]</p>
<p><br><b>PUERTO RICO</b></p>
<p>Although the now-familiar &quot;new&quot; historiography of the 1970s renewed 
  its forces in the past two years to produce several works worthy of note, it 
  is the continued output of writings on the island's political situation that 
  is drawing more notice. These two trends are not unrelated - each is connected 
  to the issues brought to the fore by the Quincentenary of the &quot;discovery&quot; 
  of America: constant political domination by a foreign power; limited economic 
  development in the context of global capitalism; ethnic and class conflict resulting 
  from continuous migratory waves, etc. As a result, books and articles on the 
  early colonial period and the 19th century deal with the impact of Spain's economic 
  and political control of subordinate groups in the colony: women, populations 
  of African descent, the working class, and so forth. Studies on the 20th century 
  have continued to examine this history of subjection, describing, analyzing, 
  denouncing, and reminiscing about the island's political trajectory under US 
  rule. In both sets of writings, one can detect the influence of cultural studies 
  and literary criticism, as discourse analysis, the review of literary texts, 
  and the inclusion of popular understandings of historical processes march onto 
  the field of history. Several reference works also resulted from the Quincentenary 
  outflow.
</p>
<p>Several factors affecting Puerto Rico's economy captured the attention of &quot;new&quot; 
  historians in the last two years. Customary consideration was given to sugar 
  and coffee, the export crops that sustained the landowning class for most of 
  the 19th century. Novel in their use of sources and theoretical perspectives 
  were works by Ayala (item bi 96013448), Camunas Madera (item bi 94011295), and 
  Pumarada O'Neill (item bi 94011308). The commercial establishment's links to 
  the island's economy were revisited by D&aacute;vila Ruiz (item bi 96012812) 
  and Cubano Iguiana (item bi 95010233), both of whom expand on traditional interpretations, 
  in the former case, of the role of the US in Puerto Rico's commercial transactions 
  and, in the latter, of that of Spanish-born merchants in the coffee economy. 
  Studies of the oppressed included an outstanding contribution from Gonz&aacute;lez-P&eacute;rez 
  (item bi 94011018), which argues that the near disappearance or absence of Africans 
  in 19th-century Puerto Rican abolitionist and folkloric literature was due to 
  the social and cultural integration of blacks and to the general desire for 
  &quot;whitening.&quot; In the field of women's studies, three excellent works, 
  all three at the cutting edge of both theory and use of sources, must be mentioned: 
  Baerga (item bi 96011018), Barcel&oacute; Miller (item bi 94011017), and Gonz&aacute;lez 
  Garc&iacute;a (item bi 94011282). Camunas Maderas (item bi 94005808), Garc&iacute;a 
  (item bi 94011292), L&oacute;pez Canto (item bi 95010238), and Pic&oacute; (item 
  bi 96011118) offer interesting attempts at exploring historical questions of 
  recent vintage. D&iacute;az Qui&ntilde;ones (item bi 93010482) and Navarro Garc&iacute;a 
  (item bi 93013952), along with the previously mentioned Gonz&aacute;lez P&eacute;rez, 
  engaged quite successfully in discourse analysis of elite immigrant groups, 
  of the religious-political hierarchy, and of the white bourgeois, respectively.
</p>
<p>Political writings concentrated on the 20th century. Informative, descriptive, 
  or &quot;objective&quot; accounts of the relationship between the US and Puerto 
  Rico from the standpoint of the military, of the pro-statehood party, and of 
  commonwealth supporters can be found, respectively, in Estades Font (item bi 
  95003304), Mel&eacute;ndez (item bi 96001113), and Zapata Oliveras (item bi 
  94005810). A more general work, with appended primary source material, is Perusse 
  (item bi 96011116). Empowering in tone and denunciatory in content are Carri&oacute;n 
  <i>et al.</i> (item bi 95010241), Fern&aacute;ndez (item bi 96013776), Garc&iacute;a 
  Mu&ntilde;iz (item bi 96013858) and Rodr&iacute;guez-Fatricelli (item bi 94001739).
</p>
<p>Puerto Rico's two elder statesmen, Luis Mu&ntilde;oz Mar&iacute;n and Luis 
  Ferr&eacute; published memoirs in 1992. The second volume of Mu&ntilde;oz Mar&iacute;n's 
  public autobiography, published posthumously, reflects on politics and government 
  between 1940-52 (item bi 94011289). Ferr&eacute;'s memoir, narrated by his daughter 
  Rosario, an established writer herself, is more personal in terms of style and 
  content (item bi 94011306). Five works revolving around the construction of 
  a national identity deserve a separate category: Acosta-Bel&eacute;n (item bi 
  94002836); Flores (item bi 96011108); Gonz&aacute;lez (item bi 96013884), Alvarez-Curbelo 
  and Rodr&iacute;guez Castro (item bi 96011097); and Delgado Cintr&oacute;n (item 
  bi 96013682).
  A number of textbooks and general works deserve mention as well. Scarano (item 
  bi 94011284) and D&iacute;az Soler (item bi 95010682) wrote general histories, 
  the latter covering exclusively the years of Spanish domination. Another installment 
  of Adolfo de Hostos' <i>Tesauro de datos hist&oacute;ricos</i> (item bi 95010230) 
  covers entries up to the letter <i>R.</i> Scholars are also fortunate to have another 
  volume of Eugenio Mar&iacute;a de Hostos' <i>Obras completas</i> available for consultation 
  (item bi 96012837). [TMV]</p>
<p><br><b>CUBA, THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC, AND THE SPANISH BORDERLANDS</b></p>
<p>The last biennium was disappointing to some extent, among other reasons because 
  it failed to generate any major works related to the centennials of Jos&eacute; 
  Mart&iacute;'s death and the outbreak of the 1859-98 Cuban War of Independence. 
  There continued to be almost a superabundance of materials, but the writing 
  generally followed the pattern of previous years: no significant new trends 
  developed, nor was there any appreciable improvement in the level of objectivity. 
  Ideology and political preconceptions kept permeating historical output, particularly 
  that of Cubans on both sides of the Florida Straits. As always, very little 
  appeared that is truly memorable, but this merely serves to put in relief the 
  noteworthy exceptions.
</p>
<p>Among the works in the general category that deserve to be singled out is Moya 
  Pons' concise history of the Dominican Republic (item bi 95020857), which certainly 
  fills a gap in the literature in English. Equally deserving, although for different 
  reasons, are Levine's study of the Jewish experience in Cuba (item bi 93020854) 
  and Baud's analysis of the problems of the Haitian-Dominican frontier (item 
  bi 93020542). Morena Fraginals' slender volume is also an important addition 
  to the history of Spanish immigration to Cuba (item bi 94008658).
</p>
<p>None of the publications listed under the early colonial and late colonial 
  headings needs to be specially mentioned, but the comparatively higher level 
  of erudition of the works on the Spanish Borderlands ought to be highlighted. 
  Notable among these works is the extremely useful <i>De Soto Chronicles,</i> an indispensable 
  tool for researchers (item bi 94012749).
</p>
<p>As in previous <i>HLAS</i> volumes, most of the entries annotated below refer to 
  works on 19th-century topics. Thus it is not surprising that most of the above-average 
  studies should appear in this subsection. Perhaps the most outstanding among 
  them is the Herculean investigation of the Cuban slave market carried out by 
  Bergad, Iglesias, and Barcia (item bi 95020214), a truly unparalleled work. 
  Three Spanish scholars, Bahamonde, Cayuela, and Rold&aacute;n de Montaud, also 
  produced solid pieces of research on 19th-century Cuban politics, economics, 
  and administration (items bi 94012595, bi 93010720, bi 94012595, bi 94012744, 
  bi 93010727, and bi 93021882). These works, however, are only samples of the 
  excellent materials generated by Spanish historians, who were also largely responsible 
  for the publication of <i>Ram&oacute;n La Sagra y Cuba</i> (item bi 94012662) and 
  half a dozen serious studies on the Spanish-American War. In Cuba, the publication 
  of extensive segments of the campaign diary of Carlos Manuel de C&eacute;spedes 
  (the initiator of the 1868-78 War of Independence) made accessible to scholars 
  material that had been presumed lost for over a century (item bi 96004641). 
  This is a finding that is bound to amend, to some extent, the historical record 
  of the war.
</p>
<p>As to the studies on contemporary history, perhaps the most ambitious, though 
  not necessarily the most successful, is Quirk's massive biography of Fidel Castro 
  (item bi 94012932). Less ambitious, but more successful, is Paterson's inquiry 
  into the reasons for Castro's triumph in Cuba, at least insofar as events in 
  the US were concerned (item bi 95009602). But neither of these two works is 
  as thorough as Bernardo Vega's probe into the relations between Trujillo and 
  the US armed forces (item bi 94012664). The study, based on US and Dominican 
  archival sources, should be required reading for all advocates of US military 
  intervention in other countries. There are also two minor essays that, although 
  less sweeping, are nevertheless interesting: O'Brien's discussion of General 
  Electric's investments in Cuba (item bi 94007531) and Collazo's study of the 
  Cuban banking crisis of 1920 (item bi 95009604). Had Collazo's approach to his 
  subject been more balanced, his little book would have been far more thought-provoking.
