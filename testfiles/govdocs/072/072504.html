<H3>The Renaissance and Early 17th Century</H3>
<P>
(end of the 15th -- first half of the 17th centuries)
        <P> <span class=largecap>T</span>he political and cultural history of France from 
          1498 to 1661, that is, from Louis XII's accession to the throne to Louis 
          XIV's personal assumption of power, can be divided into three major 
          phases. The first, up to the death of Henry II in 1559, looked to Italy 
          as a land ripe for conquest and as an inspiration for France's own Renaissance. 
        <P> <span class=largecap>T</span>he second period (1562-1598) saw the 
          realm convulsed by eight civil wars--the Wars of Religion--as France 
          grappled with the Protestant Reformation. The Reformation was both a 
          theological dispute about the proper understanding and practice of Christianity 
          and a political controversy about the legal status of the new Reformation 
          churches. In France, the conflict took on a further political dimension 
          when members of the high nobility attempted to take advantage of the 
          chaos to wrest power from the king. Factions tore each other apart. 
          The weakened monarchy had to reconquer Paris (1594) and drive the Spanish 
          from the kingdom (1597). Henry IV finally reestablished the monarchy's 
          legitimacy when he legally recognized French Protestants and gave them 
          freedom of worship. 
        <P> <span class=largecap>H</span>enry IV's conversion to Catholicism in 
          1594 inaugurated a new era and a new dynasty of French kings, the Bourbons. 
          Through a governance as militaristic and absolutist as that of any of 
          his predecessors, Henry censored writers and preachers in the name of 
          public peace. Ironically, he would be assassinated in 1610 (after nineteen 
          unsuccessful attempts on his life), falling victim to the very violence 
          and religious passions he sought to quell. 
        <P> <span class=largecap>D</span>uring the half-century that followed, 
          Cardinal Richelieu (b. 1585-d. 1642) orchestrated the royal government's 
          reconquest of domestic control. The monarchy reinforced its monitoring 
          of printing, totally strangling the emerging press. The French language 
          itself became an object of government concern through the newly created 
          <EM>Acad&eacute;mie Fran&ccedil;aise</EM>, a fitting example of Richelieu's 
          overall program of state control over politics and culture. Once the 
          last rebellion of the feudal nobility was suppressed, the framework 
          and mechanisms of absolute monarchy were in place, needing only the 
          arrival of Louis XIV to complete the scene.

        <p> In this illustration, the combined arms of Brittany and Orl&eacute;ans appearing 
          behind the lady praying to the Virgin indicate that this book was produced 
          for Marguerite d'Orl&eacute;ans, sister of Charles d'Orl&eacute;ans. 
          One of the most exquisite examples of fifteenth-century French illumination, 
          this book of hours was executed in a complex series of stages, its decoration 
          inspired by diverse sources and artists. The artist's decorative genius 
          is affirmed most strongly in the imaginative borders.

          2), Paris, after 1480, Manuscripts Department, Western Section, Fr. 
          274, Parchment 
        <p> Commissioned by King John the Good (1350-1364), this first major literal translation 
          of Livy into French was a key medieval reference work on antiquity. 
          It inaugurated the translations commissioned under Charles V (1364-1380) 
          and Charles VI (1380-1422), which provided aristocratic circles with 
          a cultural model established by the royal entourage. The opening illustration 
          shows Livy in his study. Carthage is depicted as the Ile de la Cit&eacute; 
          in Paris while Hannibal asks his father to take him to Spain.

        <P> This book outlines the procedures for settling a quarrel through trial by 
          combat. This opening depicts the confrontation which takes place in 
          an enclosed space, before <em>juges d'armes</em> who monitor the legality 
          of the blows exchanged, and an elegant audience of lords and ladies. 
          This copy was made for Fran&ccedil;ois II, Duke of Brittany (1458-1488). 
          Its diminutive format, presentation of miniatures, and lavish decoration

        <P> In an effort to guarantee the allegiance of ranking nobles, Louis XI (1461-1483) 
          founded the Order of Saint Michael in 1469. The book of <em>Statutes</em> 
          exhibited here--the king's own copy and the finest of all extant copies--was 
          illuminated by Jean Fouquet (b. around 1420-d. around 1480), the king's 
          official painter. The manuscript's only large miniature depicts the 
          king surrounded by the order's fifteen knights with the four officers 
          of the Order in the background.

        <P> Gasparino Barzizza, one of the first Italian Humanists, taught rhetoric, grammar, 
          and moral philosophy, hoping to revive Latin literature. The examples 
          of epistolary art in his Epistolae were designed to teach prose composition. 
          The edition displayed here is the first book printed in France. The 
          first French press was set up at the Sorbonne by two professors who 
          recruited three printers from Germany to whom Louis XI (1461-1483) granted 
          letters of naturalization in 1475.

        <p> At the close of the fourteenth century, Jean, Duke of Berry and Count of Poitou 
          (b. 1340-d. 1416), commissioned a genealogical romance glorifying the 
          Lusignan family from Poitou. Jean d'Arras, the author, drew upon elements 
          of oral, folk literature--a mother-goddess and the breaking of a taboo--creating 
          a new type of romance, different from contemporary tales of Charlemagne 
          and King Arthur. This illustration shows the husband breaking the taboo 
          by viewing his wife bathing.

        <p>  54. Coins of the eighth through 
  the sixteenth centuries 
        <P> This selection of coins depicts French coinage between the late eighth century 
          and early sixteenth century. Charlemagne's reform of 794 created a new 
          denarius whose appearance would change little until the tenth century. 
          The denarius of Charles the Bald (840-877), a half-century later, still 
          closely resembles that of Charlemagne (768-814). Exceptions to the almost 
          exclusive use of silver that lasted until about 1270 included the gold 
          solidi of Louis the Pious (814-840), intended for commerce with the 
          peoples of the north. The absence of a purely royal coinage under Hugh 
          Capet (987-996) suggests the weakness of the new Capetian dynasty: only 
          some denarii and oboles issued by the bishop of Beauvais and a unique 
          denarius of Laon survive. Philip II (1180- 1223) instituted the double 
          system of the denier parisis north of the Loire and the denier tournois 
          to the south. Under Louis IX (1226-1270) appeared the first multiple 
          of the denier, the gros denier worth twelve denarii. The period from 
          Philip IV (1285- 1314) to Philip VI (1328-1350) saw a multitude of gold 
          coins of varied and artistic types, including the gold florin "&agrave 
          la Reine". The royal d'or, ordered October 9, 1429 represents Charles 
          VII (1422-1461) shortly after his coronation. Although already part 
          of the kingdom of France, Brittany retained some issues of a special 
          type until the mid-sixteenth century. The king's portrait appeared for 
          the first time under Louis XII (1498-1515) on heavy silver coins, called 
          "testons", opening a new chapter in the history of French coins.

        <p> In this painting, the king, Francis I (1515-1547), wears Minerva's helmet, 
          Mars's armor, Mercury's winged sandals and his staff, Diana's hunting 
          horn, and Cupid's bow and quiver; and a Medusa's head adorns his breastplate. 
          This elevation of the monarch into a superman with the attributes of 
          the Olympic gods was typical of royal iconography in the sixteenth and 
          seventeenth centuries.

        <p> As proof of the budding alliance between the French monarchy and the Ottoman 
          sultans in the early sixteenth century, this letter was addressed by 
          Suleyman (Suleiman) the Magnificent (1520-1566) to Francis I in 1536. 
          Infused with the appropriate solemnity and magnificence, it was calligraphed 
          with great care in a number of scripts, using inks of different colors. 
          This important document marks the beginning of a permanent French embassy 
          at the Ottoman court.

        <p> The title character of <EM>Pantagruel</EM>, of which this is the oldest extant 
          version, can be traced to a figure in fifteenth-century mystery plays: 
          the sprite of thirst, who incited people to drink by throwing them salt. 
          The book celebrates wine, love, and mortal pleasures. All the coarse 
          passages in this copy were inked out in the sixteenth century.

          miniatures. On folio 1 verso is a golden crown inside a wreath bearing 
          the arms of the princess. On folio 2, Marguerite's husband, Henry of

          IV (1589-1610), is shown holding a marguerite daisy.

          maps of the world. This map is bordered with a handsome Renaissance 
          decoration: two columns support a pediment bearing a Latin inscription 
          signifying "A new and complete description of the world," interrupted 
          in the middle by a coat of arms of France. Also to be noted is a vast

        <p> Traditional in text and layout, this finely-crafted prayer book meant for 
          private devotion and enjoyment, is innovative in its Old Testament miniatures, 
          which illustrate the cares and duties of kingship. The last miniature, 
          exhibited here, shows Henry II (1547-1569) healing the diseased with 
          his touch. The newly-crowned king is garbed in his gold, fleur-de-lis-embroidered 
          regalia; on the far right stands the Archbishop of Rheims, who presided 
          at Henry's coronation.

        <p> This portrait in black chalk is one of the finest achievements of Fran&ccedil;ois 
          Clouet (b. before 1522-d. 1572) from the last years of his career. Queen 
          Catherine (b. 1519-d. 1589), widowed at forty, was overcome with grief 
          and dressed in black for the rest of her life. Ambassadors were struck 
          by her pale complexion and stoutness as much as by her intelligence 
          and stubbornness, the two aspects of her personality that Clouet strove 
          to render.

        <p> While Paris was in the hands of the extremist Catholic League, Pierre de L'Estoile 
          (b. 1546-d. 1611) assembled an album, <EM>Les Belles figures et drolleries 
          de la Ligue</EM>, which was intended to show the League's "wickedness, 
          vanity, folly, and deception." This woodcut recalls the great Parisian 
          processions by "blue and white penitents" (so-called from the color 
          of their garments), which Henry III instituted in 1583, and in which 
          the king and his nobles participated.

        <p> In 1634, Charles de Sainte-Maure, future Duke of Montausier (b. 1610-d. 1690), 
          gave his beloved Lucine-Julie d'Angennes (b. 1607-d. 1671) a collection 
          of verses. Prepared in collaboration with the most fashionable poets 
          of his time, these verses exalted Julie's beauty and other qualities 
          through the theme of flowers. Faced with her apparent indifference, 
          the marquis produced a more lavish version, exhibited here, which he 
          gave Julie in 1641. Three years later, they were married.
