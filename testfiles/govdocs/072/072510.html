<p><center>BRIEF FOR THE UNITED STATES</center>


<p><center>STATEMENT OF SUBJECT MATTER AND APPELLATE JURISDICTION</center>


<p>	The defendant, Joseph Russell Downen, was convicted of
violating 18 U.S.C. 241 (conspiracy against rights), 18 U.S.C.
371 (conspiracy), and 18 U.S.C. 1001 (false statements).  This is
an appeal from a judgment of conviction and sentence.  The
district court entered a final judgment and commitment order on
September 21, 1999 (R. 182).<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a>  A timely notice of appeal was
filed by defendant on September 28, 1999 (R. 187).  The district
court had jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 3231.  This Court
has jurisdiction of this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1291. 

<p><center>STATEMENT OF THE ISSUES</center>


<p>	1.  Whether the evidence is sufficient to sustain
defendant's convictions.

<p>	2.  Whether the district court abused its discretion in
denying defendant's motion to sever counts I and III from counts
IV and V.  

<p>	3.  Whether the district court abused its discretion in
denying defendant's motion for mistrial.  

<p><center>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</center>


<p>A.  <u>Course Of Proceedings And Disposition Below</u>

<p>	Defendant was indicted by a federal grand jury on June 25,
1998, on four counts of a five-count indictment (R. 1).  Count I
of the indictment charged defendant with conspiring to violate
the housing rights of Carlos Durand, Sr., a Mexican American and
legal permanent resident of the United States, and his children
who are Mexican-American citizens of the United States, in
violation of 18 U.S.C. 241.  Count III charged defendant with
intimidating and inflicting bodily injury on victim Durand and
his children because of their race, and because they were
occupying a dwelling in violation of 42 U.S.C. 3631(a).  Count IV
charged defendant with conspiring to make false statements
regarding his participation in the beating of victim Durand in
violation of 18 U.S.C. 371.  Count V charged defendant with
making false statements to federal officials investigating the
beating of Durand in violation of 18 U.S.C. 1001.  Co-defendants
Raymond Parisi and Jason Alvord were also charged and pled guilty
to civil rights conspiracy in violation of 18 U.S.C. 241.  Co-defendant Gary Wilkins pled guilty to interfering with housing
rights in violation of 42 U.S.C. 3631. 

<p>	On December 17, 1998, prior to trial, defendant moved, <u>inter</u>
<u>alia</u>, to sever counts I and III from counts IV and V (R. 73). 
Defendant supplemented that motion on January 29, 1999 (R. 89). 
The United States opposed the motion (R. 74).  The district court
denied the motion at a hearing on March 16, 1999 (Motions Tr. at
99-100).  

<p>	A jury trial was held June 10-11, and 15-16, 1999.  Co-defendants Parisi and Wilkins testified on behalf of the
government pursuant to a plea agreement.  At the conclusion of
trial, but prior to the verdict, defendant again moved to sever
the counts (Tr. 446).  The district court denied the motion (Tr.
449).  Defendant also moved for a mistrial on the basis of a
statement made by a government witness regarding a polygraph test
(Tr. 441).  The district court denied the motion for mistrial
(Tr. 446).   

<p>	The jury found defendant guilty of counts I, IV and V (Tr.
574-575).  A mistrial was declared on count III (Tr. 577). 
Defendant was sentenced to 15 months imprisonment on September
16, 1999, and ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $550,
and a special assessment of $300.  Defendant is not in custody
pending appeal of his conviction (Def. Br. 8). 


<p>B.  <u>Defendant's Motion For Mistrial Based On A Government         
    Witness's Remarks About A Polygraph Test</u>   


<p>	At trial, FBI Agent Timothy Kirkham testified for the
government.  Agent Kirkham investigated the circumstances
surrounding the assault on Carlos Durand (Tr. 414).  He testified
that he interviewed Downen as part of that investigation, and
described that interview at trial (Tr. 415-418).  Agent Kirkham
testified that the information that he received from defendant
with respect to identifying who inflicted bodily injury on Carlos
Durand directly contradicted the information that he received
from Durand himself (Tr. 418-419).  He stated that in view of the
contradictory information, he "had to attempt to ascertain who
was really telling the truth" (Tr. 419).  He stated that to do
that he wanted to "bring a polygraph examiner or lie detector
test person in" (Tr. 419).  Defendant objected to the witness's
reference to a polygraph examination, and asked that it be
stricken (Tr. 419-420).  The district court sustained the
objection and struck the testimony (Tr. 420).

<p>	At the conclusion of trial, defendant moved for a mistrial
based on the Agent Kirkham's reference to the polygraph test
during his testimony (Tr. 441).  The district court denied the
motion (Tr. 446).  

<p><center>STATEMENT OF THE FACTS</center>


<p>A.  <u>The Assault On Carlos Durand</u>

<p>	During the fall of 1997, Carlos Durand and his three
children moved into 2880 Palisades Drive, Apartment 2, Lake
Havasu City, Arizona (Tr. 264, 369-372, 375; U.S. Exhs. 1 and 2). 
At the time of trial, Durand's children were ages 4, 5 and 23
(Tr. 369-370).  The Durands are Mexican-American (Tr. 145, 374). 
They moved next door to a white couple, Gary and Melissa Wilkins,
who lived in Apartment 3 (Tr. 142, 145, 263, 375).  Just prior to
the Durands moving into their Palisades Drive home, Gary and
Melissa Wilkins invited Raymond and Daniel Parisi, who are
brothers, to move in with them until they could afford their own
apartment (Tr. 140-141, 190-192, 194, 263-264, 337-338).  The
Parisi brothers are white (Tr. 145).  They had wanted to move
into Apartment 2, the unit that the Durand family moved into, but
could not afford the apartment (Tr. 144-145, 338). 

<p>	There were no problems between the neighbors, except for a
few requests by Gary Wilkins that Durand turn down his music and
otherwise reduce the level of noise in Durand's apartment (Tr.
146, 167, 265, 339, 375-377).  Later, however, in the fall of
1997, Ray Parisi's friend, Jason Alvord, began to spend a
significant amount of time at the Wilkins' apartment (Tr. 147,
266).  Alvord's nickname was "Hammer" (Tr. 147, 197).  He had a
shaved head, tattoos of swastikas on his arms, and wore tank
tops, long baggy pants, red suspenders, and black boots with
white laces (Tr. 147-148, 170-171, 197-198).  Alvord was an
avowed white supremacist who espoused beliefs that white people
were superior to Hispanics, African-Americans and Asians (Tr.
148-149, 198, 267, 340).  He referred to Hispanic people as
"wetbacks" and "beaners," African-Americans as "niggers," and
Asians as "chinks" (Tr. 149).  As Ray Parisi began "hanging out"
more frequently with Alvord, he shaved his head, dressed like
Alvord, and had tattoos of a swastika, a skull with a swastika in
the forehead, a skull with a dagger, and an eagle tattooed on his
body (Tr. 199).  Ray Parisi's behavior began to change, and he
began using racially derogatory terms when speaking about
minority persons (Tr. 150, 169, 171-172, 200-201).  Defendant
Downen met with Ray Parisi and Alvord at Alvord's apartment
almost every day, participated in conversations that Parisi and
Alvord had about white supremacy, and listened to "hate rock
music" (Tr. 202-203).  Defendant Downen did not dress like Alvord
or have any tattoos on his body (Tr. 201-202).  Gary Wilkins'
behavior also began to change (Tr. 267).  He shaved his head, had
a tattoo placed on his body, and started referring to the Durands
as "wetbacks" (Tr. 150, 267-268, 377-378).  

<p>	Ray Parisi, Wilkins, and Alvord had conversations about the
Durand family and talked about wanting the Durands out of the
apartment complex because they were Hispanic (Tr. 152-153, 172-173, 269, 340).  The men referred to the Durands as the "beaner"
family and said that they needed to get the family out of
Apartment 2 (Tr. 152-154, 203).  Downen, who was at the apartment
during some of these conversations, agreed with the racial slurs
made by Parisi, Wilkins and Alvord, and also talked about
"wetback[s]" (Tr. 201-203).  

<p>	The evening of December 31, 1997, Carlos Durand was walking
up to the door of his apartment when he saw Ray Parisi, Gary and
Melissa Wilkins, and Alvord standing outside (Tr. 205-206, 379). 
Durand said "Happy New Year" to them, and Gary Wilkins responded,
"Fuck you, wetback" (Tr. 206, 379).  Durand went into his
apartment, then returned back outside of his front door to smoke
a cigarette (Tr. 380).  Gary Wilkins and Parisi returned to the
Wilkins' apartment (Tr. 206, 271).  Alvord approached Durand,
pointed a pellet gun to Durand's head, and threatened to shoot
him (Tr. 206, 380-382).  After the incident, Durand returned to
his apartment (Tr. 382).  He did not call the police because he
was afraid that Parisi, Wilkins and Alvord would "do[] something
else to [him] or [his] kids" (Tr. 383).  

<p>	About two weeks later, the evening of January 14, 1998, Gary
Wilkins and Dan Parisi were at the Wilkins' apartment playing a
video game while Melissa Wilkins did laundry (Tr. 273, 341). 
They heard Carlos Durand banging on the front door of the
Durand's apartment (Tr. 272-273, 341).  Durand thought that his
son was in the apartment, and he was trying to get his attention
(Tr. 273, 384).  Gary Wilkins yelled profane language at Durand,
and called him a "wetback" (Tr. 273-274, 384).  Wilkins got a
crowbar, and he and Dan Parisi went to the Durand apartment and
confronted Carlos Durand, who was still pounding on his front
door (Tr. 274, 385).  Wilkins and Parisi yelled at Durand, and
Durand explained that he was trying to get his son's attention
(Tr. 275).  Durand's son then arrived, and they went into the
Durand's apartment (Tr. 276).  Wilkins and Parisi returned to
Wilkins' apartment (Tr. 276).

<p>	Ray Parisi, Alvord, and Downen were drinking at Downen's
apartment when they received a phone call from Gary Wilkins (Tr.
208-209, 240-241).  Alvord took the phone from Ray Parisi, and
talked to Wilkins (Tr. 209, 242, 277).  After Alvord got off the
phone, he told defendant Downen and Parisi that there was a
"problem with the wetback next door" (Tr. 209, 243).  Defendant
Downen went into his room and grabbed a baseball bat (Tr. 209). 
The three men got into a car and drove to the Wilkins' apartment
(Tr.  210-211).  During the drive, the men got "pumped up" and
talked about "getting the beaner" (Tr. 211).  

<p>	They drove to the Wilkins' apartment where they met Gary,
his wife Melissa, Dan Parisi, and Dan's girlfriend Megan Bronzell
(Tr. 154, 278).  Defendant Downen entered the apartment carrying
a baseball bat and pounding it on his hand (Tr. 155).  Downen
appeared to be intoxicated because his eyes were bloodshot (Tr.
155-156, 175-176).  Alvord came into the apartment and left his
dog there (Tr. 345).  After arriving at the Wilkins' apartment,
defendant Downen, Alvord, Ray Parisi, and Gary Wilkins went to
Durand's apartment (Tr. 156, 212, 280).  

<p>	As they approached Durand's apartment, Carlos Durand was
standing at his front door (Tr. 213, 281).  The group surrounded
Durand, called him a "wetback," and Downen yelled that Durand 
was "going to get [his] ass kicked" (Tr. 282-283, 388-392). 
Alvord then hit Carlos Durand on the head and knee with the
baseball bat (Tr. 215, 284, 393-394).  Durand's oldest son
grabbed his father, pulled him into the house, and shut the door
(Tr. 216, 285, 394).  Alvord broke the windows with the baseball
bat while defendant Downen and Ray Parisi kicked on the front
door (Tr. 157, 216).  Defendant Downen yelled, "Come out wetback"
as he continued kicking on the Durand's front door (Tr. 216-217,
259-260, 395).  Then they left (Tr. 218, 286).  Alvord returned
to the Wilkins' apartment for his dog, while Downen, Ray Parisi
and Gary Wilkins ran to a car (Tr. 157, 286, 346).  Alvord was
carrying the baseball bat that Downen had been carrying earlier
in the evening (Tr. 157-158).  

<p>	Defendant Downen rode with Alvord and Ray Parisi to Alvord's
house (Tr. 158, 218).  They were met there by Gary and Melissa
Wilkins, Dan Parisi, and Bronzell (Tr. 158, 346-347).  Alvord had
the cars parked in the back of his house so that if the police
came to the house they would not see the vehicles parked in the
front (Tr. 158-159).  Alvord kept the lights to the house off
(Tr. 159, 347).  They were scared that the police would show up,
so they left and went to defendant Downen's house where they
drank and stayed for three or four hours (Tr. 160, 218, 287, 289,
347).  

<p>	At some point in the evening Downen, Alvord and Ray Parisi
went alone into Downen's backyard (Tr. 219-220).  They talked
about the incident and about "covering up what happened" (Tr.
220).  Alvord asked defendant Downen to "take the rap for him
because Jason [Alvord] had been in a whole bunch of trouble
before * * * [a]nd Joe [Downen] has not, so he would have
probably not been as -- as much trouble as Jason [Alvord] would
have been" (Tr. 220, 248).  Defendant Downen agreed (Tr. 220).  

<p>	Back inside Downen's house, Downen, Alvord and Ray Parisi 
laughed and joked about the incident, and Downen laughed as he
described himself hitting Carlos Durand over the head with the
baseball bat (Tr. 160, 162, 350).  Downen told everybody in the
house that he had hit the "wetback" over the head and then
"smacked him in the knee after that" (Tr. 162, 348).  The three
men also joked about Durand, calling him a "wetback," and Downen,
along with Ray Parisi and Alvord, gave the "white power salute"
as they talked about the incident (Tr. 161-162, 349).  

<p>	When police arrived at Durand's apartment they found blood
in front of Durand's door, a broken front window, blood along the
doorframe and along the carpet inside the apartment, and
shattered glass (Tr. 132).  Mr. Durand was in his apartment with
his children, and was holding a bloodied towel or t-shirt to the
left side of his head (Tr. 133).  Durand suffered injuries that
required five staples to his head (Tr. 398).  Soon following the
incident the Durand family moved out of their Palisades Drive
apartment because they were afraid to continue living there (Tr.
398-401).  

<p>B.  <u>The Investigation Of The Assault</u>

<p>	On January 23, 1998, Ray Parisi was arrested by the Lake
Havasu Police Department in connection with a different assault
than that committed on Carlos Durand (Tr. 221).  While under
arrest for that matter, Parisi was questioned about the assault
on Durand (Tr. 222).  Parisi initially told police that an
unidentified person assaulted Durand (Tr. 222).  Later, when
Parisi was interviewed by the FBI about the Durand assault, he
lied to investigators telling them that defendant Downen had hit
Durand with the bat (Tr. 222-223).  He told investigators that
Downen was the assailant because he wanted to protect Alvord
pursuant to the agreement that he had entered into with Alvord
and Downen the evening of the Durand assault (Tr. 223; see also
Tr. 352).  After telling the FBI the truth about Downen's
involvement, Parisi entered a plea agreement with federal
prosecutors (Tr. 354).  

<p>	City police Detective Robert Spoerry investigated the
circumstances surrounding Durand's assault, and on January 29,
1998, he stopped Gary Wilkins, Alvord and Downen (Tr. 464-465). 
After stopping the men, Detective Spoerry arrested Wilkins and
Alvord for assaulting Durand (Tr. 291, 317, 464-465).  Although
Downen was not arrested with Alvord and Wilkins, Detective
Spoerry interviewed Downen, and Downen told him that he had
assaulted Durand (Tr. 465).  Wilkins told city police that he was
not home the evening of Carlos Durand's assault (Tr. 293).  He
later told the FBI that defendant Downen had assaulted Durand
(Tr. 293).  He told this story to the FBI because it was
something that he had agreed with Alvord to do (Tr. 293).  After
entering into a plea of guilty on reduced charges, Wilkins told
the United States Attorneys Office the truth about Alvord's
involvement in the assault (Tr. 294-295).   

<p>	Detective Spoerry contacted the FBI, and in February, 1998,
the FBI picked up the investigation (Tr. 474).  Detective Spoerry
met with FBI Agent Timothy Kirkham at least once a week over a
period of two months to discuss the case and the conflicting
reports about who struck Durand with the baseball bat (Tr. 470,
475-476).   

<p>	Defendant Downen was interviewed by the FBI in March, 1998
(Tr. 416).  Downen told FBI Agent Timothy Kirkham that on the
evening of January 14, 1998, he went to Durand's apartment,
struck Carlos Durand with a baseball bat, and broke the front
windows of Durand's apartment (Tr. 417).  Downen told Agent
Kirkham that Alvord did nothing during the assault, although he
was present (Tr. 418).  During the discussion with Agent Kirkham,
Downen insisted that he was telling the truth (Tr. 418).  Agent
Kirkham testified at trial that the information that Downen
provided to him with respect to his role in the assault
contradicted the statement provided by Durand, who said that
Alvord had struck him with the baseball bat (Tr. 418-419).  FBI
Agent Kirkham and City Detective Spoerry both testified that
because of this contradiction, the investigation was extended and
further witness interviews were conducted (Tr. 419-420, 476-478).

<p><center>SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT</center>


<p>	The issues raised by defendant in this appeal lack merit and
do not warrant reversal of the convictions.  After a jury trial,
defendant was found guilty of conspiring to violate the civil
rights of an individual in violation of 18 U.S.C. 241, and
making, and conspiring to make, false statements in violation of
18 U.S.C. 371 and 1001.  

<p>	Defendant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to
support his convictions.  He challenges his conviction under 18
U.S.C. 241, arguing that there is no evidence to show that he was
involved in the conspiracy.  This claim is without merit in view
of the ample evidence demonstrating that defendant had a
relationship with the co-conspirators, that he was present during
the assault, and that he then intentionally lied to an FBI agent
about the circumstances surrounding the assault. 

<p>	Defendant's sufficiency of evidence argument regarding the
materiality of his false statements is equally without merit. 
The government need not show that the agent believed the false
statements.  Rather, statements are material if they have the
"intrinsic capability" of misleading a government official.  In
this case, defendant's false statements not only had the
intrinsic capability of misleading FBI Agent Kirkham, they
actually did mislead the agent who extended his investigation and
interviewed additional witnesses because defendant's
identification of the assailant who inflicted bodily injury on
Carlos Durand conflicted with the testimony of other witnesses.  

<p>	Contrary to defendant's argument, the district court did not
abuse its discretion by refusing to sever counts I and III from
counts IV and V.  The government's decision to charge defendant
with related offenses in a single indictment was clearly proper. 
Similarly, the district court's refusal to sever the counts was
not an abuse of discretion.  Trying defendant on these counts
jointly did not prejudice the defendant because the counts are
not inconsistent.  As the jury found, it was possible to find
defendant guilty of conspiring with Alvord and others to assault
Durand, and of falsely stating that he, not Alvord, had beaten
the victim.  The district court properly instructed the jury that
each count had to be decided independently of the others.  

<p>	The district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing
to grant a mistrial based on a government witness's brief
reference to a polygraph test.  The witness did not testify about
whether defendant was subjected to a polygraph test, nor did he
testify about the results of any such test.  As such, the
statement about the polygraph test could not have prejudiced the
jury, nor did it call into question the fairness of the jury's
guilty verdict.  Moreover, the district court's swift action in
striking the testimony, and then instructing the jury to
disregard it cured any possible harm.  

<p><center>ARGUMENT</center>


<p><center>I.</center>


<p><center>THE EVIDENCE IS SUFFICIENT TO </center>


<center>SUSTAIN DEFENDANT'S CONVICTIONS</center>



<p>	Defendant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence
supporting his convictions for conspiring against the civil
rights of the Durand family in violation of 18 U.S.C. 241,
conspiring to make false statements in violation of 18 U.S.C.
371, and making false statements in violation of 18 U.S.C. 1001
(Def. Br. 12-18).  Review of the sufficiency of evidence is
"highly deferential to the jury's findings."  <u>United States</u> v.
<u>Bancalari</u>, 110 F.3d 1425, 1428 (9th Cir. 1997) (internal
quotations omitted).  In reviewing the sufficiency of the
evidence supporting a conviction, this Court must review the
record to determine "whether a reasonable jury, after reviewing
the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, could
have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of each
essential element of the crime charged."  <u>United States</u> v. <u>Mares</u>,
940 F.2d 455, 458 (9th Cir. 1991) (internal quotations omitted);
see also <u>Jackson</u> v. <u>Virginia</u>, 443 U.S. 307, 319 (1979).  The
"relevant inquiry is not whether the evidence excludes every
hypothesis except guilt, but whether the jury could reasonably
arrive at its verdict."  <u>Mares</u>, 940 F.2d at 458.  In this case,
there is ample evidence to support convictions on each count. 


<p>	A.  <u>	The Evidence Is Sufficient To Sustain Defendant's 		Conviction For A Violation Of 18 U.S.C. 241</u>


<p>	Defendant argues (Br. 15-16) that the evidence is
insufficient to establish a violation of 18 U.S.C. 241 because he
did not intend to "join[] an existing conspiracy to violate the
rights of Mr. Durand or his family."

<p>	Section 241 makes it a crime for "two or more persons [to]
conspire to injure, oppress, threaten, or intimidate any person

* * * in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege
secured * * * by the Constitution or laws of the United States." 
18 U.S.C. 241.  To prove a violation of Section 241, the
government "must show that the offender acted with a specific
intent to interfere with the federal rights in question." 
<u>Anderson</u> v. <u>United States</u>, 417 U.S. 211, 223 (1974).<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a>  To
establish the statutory violation, the government need not offer
"direct proof of an express agreement on the part of the
[defendant] to commit the constitutional violations * * * at
issue."  <u>United States</u> v. <u>Reese</u>, 2 F.3d 870, 893 (9th Cir. 1993),
cert. denied, 510 U.S. 1094 (1994).  Rather, the "conspiracy may
be proved by circumstantial evidence that defendants acted
together for a common illegal goal."  <u>United States</u> v. <u>Wiseman</u>,
25 F.3d 862, 869 (9th Cir. 1994) (internal quotations omitted). 
Even a connection that is "slight" is "sufficient to convict
defendant of knowing participation in the conspiracy."  <u>United
States</u> v. <u>Stauffer</u>, 922 F.2d 508, 514-515 (9th Cir. 1990);
<u>Skillman</u>, 922 F.2d at 1373.  That connection can be inferred from
a combination of circumstances and reasonable inferences arising
from the relationship of the parties, statements and conduct
showing an agreement or common motive, as well as comments and
activities to cover up the illegal activity.  See <u>United States</u>
v. <u>Piche</u>, 981 F.2d 706, 717 (4th Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 508
U.S. 916 (1993); <u>United States</u> v. <u>Redwine</u>, 715 F.2d 315, 320 (7th
Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 467 U.S. 1216 (1984); <u>United States</u> v.
<u>Davis</u>, 810 F.2d 474, 477 (5th Cir. 1987); <u>United States</u> v. <u>Ellis</u>,
595 F.2d 154, 160 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 838 (1979).  

<p>	In the instant case, defendant does not dispute that there
was a conspiracy to interfere with victim Durand's housing rights
on the basis of race in violation of 18 U.S.C. 241.<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a>  Instead,
he asserts (Br. 15-16), that the evidence is insufficient to
prove that he joined in the conspiracy.  A review of the record,
however, demonstrates that there was overwhelming evidence that
defendant participated in the conspiracy.     

<p>	Evidence shows that prior to the assault on Durand,
defendant had participated in conversations about getting the
Durands to leave the apartment complex.  Defendant was with his
friends when they referred to the Durands as the "beaner" family,
and expressed wanting to get the Durands out of Apartment 2 (p.
6, <u>supra</u>).  Defendant also talked about "wetbacks" (p. 6, <u>supra</u>). 
On the night of the assault, Gary Wilkins called the defendant's
house where Ray Parisi, Alvord and defendant were drinking (p. 7-8, <u>supra</u>).  When Alvord hung up the phone, he told Parisi and
defendant that there was a "problem with the wetback next door"
(p. 8, <u>supra</u>).  Defendant went into his room and grabbed a
baseball bat, and the three drove to the apartment complex where
Wilkins and Durand lived (p. 8, <u>supra</u>).  During the drive, the
men got "pumped up" and talked about "getting the beaner." 
Defendant entered the Wilkins' apartment with the bat, pounding
it in his hand (p. 8, <u>supra</u>).  Defendant then went with the other
men to Durand's apartment where Carlos Durand was standing.  The
group surrounded Durand at his front door.  They called him a
"wetback," and defendant yelled that Durand was "going to get
[his] ass kicked" (p. 8, <u>supra</u>).  Alvord then hit Durand with the
baseball bat.  When Durand's son dragged him back into their
apartment, defendant kicked on the front door yelling "Come out
wetback" (p. 8-9, <u>supra</u>).  After the assault, defendant rode with
the other men first to Alvord's house, and then to defendant's
house where they drank and joked about assaulting Durand.  The
night of the assault, defendant told friends that he had hit the
"wetback" over the head and "smacked him in the knee after that"
(p. 10, <u>supra</u>).  After the assault, defendant talked to Alvord
and Parisi and the three men agreed that defendant would "take
the rap" so that Alvord could avoid getting into more trouble (p.
9, <u>supra</u>).    

<p>	Indeed, this evidence shows that defendant had more than
just a slight connection to the offense.  The evidence shows that
defendant acted along with others for the common goal of driving
the Durand family out of his apartment because of his race. 
Moreover, evidence of defendant's ongoing relationship with his
co-conspirators, coupled with evidence of statements and conduct
between the men showing an agreement to cover up Alvord's
involvement in the assault and have defendant take the blame, is
more than sufficient to show that defendant conspired to violate
the rights of the Durand family in violation of 18 U.S.C. 241.

<p>	Despite this volume of evidence, defendant argues (Br. 15-16), that the evidence is insufficient to establish defendant's
knowing involvement in the conspiracy because of inconsistencies
in witness testimony.  Inconsistencies in testimony do not,
however, entitle a defendant to reversal of a conviction. 
Rather, the evaluation of conflicting testimony is a matter left
to the jury.  <u>United States</u> v. <u>Messer</u>, 197 F.3d 330, 343 (9th
Cir. 1999).  Accordingly, defendant's conviction for a violation
of 18 U.S.C. 241 should be affirmed.

<p>B.  <u>	The Evidence Is Sufficient To Show That Defendant's False 	Statements Were Material To The FBI Agent's Investigation Of
	The Circumstances Surrounding The Assault</u>


<p>	Defendant argues (Br. 16-18) that there is insufficient
evidence to show that he made false statements in violation of 18
U.S.C. 1001.  Section 1001 of Title 18 prohibits any person from
"mak[ing] any <u>materially</u> false, fictitious, or fraudulent
statement[s] or representation[s]" to a federal officer. 
Materiality is an element of the offense.  <u>United States</u> v.
<u>Valdez</u>, 594 F.2d 725, 728 (9th Cir. 1979).  "[T]he test for
determining the materiality of the falsification is whether the
falsification is calculated to induce action or reliance by an
agency of the United States[.]  [I]s it one that could affect or
influence the exercise of governmental functions, [or] does it
have a natural tendency to influence or is it capable of
influencing agency decision?"  <u>United States</u> v. <u>East</u>, 416 F.2d
351, 353 (9th Cir. 1969); see also <u>United States</u> v. <u>Talkington</u>,
589 F.2d 415, 416 (9th Cir. 1978).  While defendant does not deny
that his statements were false, he argues that the jury's finding
of materiality was erroneous because FBI Agent Kirkham never
believed that defendant's statements regarding involvement in the
assault of Carlos Durand were true.  

<p>	Defendant's argument, however, is meritless in view of this
Court's holding in <u>Valdez</u>, <u>supra</u>.  <u>Valdez</u> involved a false
statement in the course of a visa application.  In <u>Valdez</u>, the
defendant argued that it was impossible for the false statements
to have the capacity or capability of influencing action by a
government official because the visas would have been denied
regardless of the false statements.  Ruling against the
defendant, this Court stated:

<p><blockquote>	We believe that the conduct Congress intended to prevent by
&#167; 1001 was the willful submission to federal agencies of 
false statements calculated to induce agency reliance or
action, irrespective of whether actual favorable agency
action was, for other reasons, impossible.  We think the
test is the intrinsic capabilities of the false statement
itself, rather than the possibility of the actual attainment
of its end as measured by collateral circumstances.</blockquote>


<p><u>Valdez</u>, 594 F.2d at 729; see also <u>United States</u> v. <u>Goldfine</u>, 538
F.2d 815, 821 (9th Cir. 1976).  This Court in <u>Valdez</u> concluded
that the false statements satisfied the materiality requirement
because the statements had the "intrinsic" capability of
misleading a government official.  <u>Ibid.</u>  

<p>	Applying the materiality test to the present case, it is
clear that defendant's undisputedly false statements to the FBI
were "material," because the statements not only had the 
"intrinsic" capability of misleading FBI Agent Kirkham in his
investigation of the circumstances surrounding the assault of
Carlos Durand, but actually did mislead Agent Kirkham because it
required him to extend his investigation and conduct additional
interviews (Tr. 420).    

<p>	Agent Kirkham testified that during the span of his
investigation he interviewed a number of witnesses, including
Durand and defendant, about the assault.  Agent Kirkham stated
that defendant's statements about his role in the assault
conflicted with information given to him by Durand and other
witnesses, and that this extended Agent Kirkham's investigation
so that he could reconcile the contradiction (Tr. 420). 
Defendant's false statements were also material because they were
calculated to induce agency action, <u>i.e.</u>, direct the agent's
attention away from Alvord as the assailant who inflicted bodily
injury on the victim, Carlos Durand, and shift that blame to
defendant.  In view of evidence of the agreement reached between
defendant and his co-conspirators the night of the assault (p. 9,
<u>supra</u>), defendant's false statements were intentional and
calculated to spare Alvord prosecution for beating Durand. 
Defendant's false statements thus satisfy the materiality
requirement of 18 U.S.C. 1001.  

<p><center>II</center>


<p><center>THE DISTRICT COURT DID NOT ABUSE ITS DISCRETION </center>


<center>IN DENYING DEFENDANT'S MOTION TO SEVER </center>


<center>COUNTS I AND III FROM COUNTS IV AND V</center>



<p>	Defendant argues (Def. Br. 18-19) that his convictions
should be reversed because the district court abused its
discretion by refusing to sever counts I and III (involving the
assault) from counts IV and VI (involving the false statements).  

Defendant does not dispute that the counts were properly joined
pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 8(a).  Because the counts were
properly joined in the indictment, defendant has a heavy burden
to prove that the court's refusal to sever counts was an abuse of
discretion.  

<p>	Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 14 permits a district
court to sever multiple counts brought in an indictment "[i]f it
appears that a defendant or the government is prejudiced by a
joinder of offenses."  Fed. R. Crim. P. 14.  Defendant claims
(Br. 19) that he was prejudiced by the district court's refusal
to sever counts because the counts were inconsistent, and
required his conviction on one set of counts in any event. 
Defendant argues (Br. 19) that "admission to [the conspiracy
counts] means a denial of the [false statement counts], meaning
there was no way for Downen to be acquitted on all counts."  This
claim of prejudice is without merit.  Defendant could have
avoided conviction on all counts if the evidence had shown that
he had, in fact, no involvement in the conspiracy to beat Durand
and had not lied to federal officials about his non-involvement. 
Furthermore, "an important factor in determining whether
prejudice exists is whether the evidence of one of the crimes
would be admissible in a separate trial for the other crime." 
<u>United States</u> v. <u>Begun</u>, 446 F.2d 32, 33 (9th Cir. 1971) (internal
quotations omitted).  "If the answer is affirmative, the joinder
of offenses, in most instances, will not be prejudicial."  <u>Ibid.</u> 
In this case, it is clear that the evidence proving the existence
of the offenses in counts I and III (conspiracy against rights)
would be admissible in a separate trial for offenses in counts IV
and V (false statements regarding the conspiracy).  Such evidence
is based upon related actions stemming from the assault, and
would be admissible to prove all of the counts charged against
the defendant.     

<p>	Moreover, the jury was well instructed by the district court
that each count had to be decided independently of the others,
and the evidence as it relates to each count was "easily
compartmentalized."  <u>United States</u> v. <u>Patterson</u>, 819 F.2d 1495,
1501 (9th Cir. 1987); <u>United States</u> v. <u>Ford</u>, 632 F.2d 1354, 1374
(9th Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 934 (1981).  The district
court told the jury:  "A separate crime is charged in each count. 
You must decide each count separately.  Your verdict on one count
should not control your verdict on any other count" (Tr. 547). 
The district court then gave detailed instructions to the jury of
the elements of each independent count, and described the kind of
evidence that could be considered in determining whether the
elements of the offense have been met (Tr. 549-560).  Based on
these detailed instructions, the jury was able to
compartmentalize the counts, and properly apply the evidence to
reach their verdict.  This is underscored by the fact that the
jury found insufficient evidence to support a conviction of the
housing violation set out in count III and declared a mistrial on
that charge, while finding defendant guilty on counts I, IV and
V.  Thus the district court did not abuse its discretion in
denying defendant's motion to sever counts.    

<p><center>III</center>


<p><center>THE DISTRICT COURT DID NOT ABUSE ITS DISCRETION IN </center>


<center>REFUSING TO GRANT A MISTRIAL BASED ON A WITNESS'S BRIEF </center>


<center>REFERENCE TO A POLYGRAPH TEST</center>



<p>	Defendant contends (Br. 22) that the government witness's
remarks prejudiced his right to a fair trial because they implied 
that he failed a polygraph test and therefore made a false
statement.  This contention is without merit.  

<p>	The only statement that Agent Kirkham made about a polygraph
examination was brief and did not say that defendant had taken a
polygraph test.  Agent Kirkham testified that when he interviewed
defendant about the events surrounding the assault, defendant's
statements contradicted information that he received from Carlos
Durand, the victim of the assault (Tr. 419).  He stated that in
view of the conflicting information, he intended to bring in a
"polygraph examiner or lie detector test person in" to help
determine which witness was telling the truth (Tr. 419).  After
Agent Kirkham's remark about possibly bringing in a polygraph
examiner, the district court granted defendant's objection to the
testimony and ordered it stricken (Tr. 420).  At the conclusion
of trial, the district court instructed the jury that "any
testimony that has been * * * stricken * * * is not evidence and
must not be considered" (Tr. 545).  Defendant could not
reasonably have been prejudiced by the mere mention by Agent
Kirkham of the possibility of bringing in a polygraph examiner to
reconcile conflicting witness statements.  Agent Kirkham never
testified that he actually brought in a polygraph examiner to
assist in the investigation.  Moreover, Agent Kirkham did not
testify about whether defendant was subjected to a polygraph
examination at all, nor did he testify about the results of any
such examination.  The district court's swift action in striking
the testimony and then instructing the jury to disregard all such
testimony cured any harm that may have resulted.  See, <u>e.g.</u>,
<u>United States</u> v. <u>Wills</u>, 88 F.3d 704, 713 (9th Cir.) (government
witness's reference to the fact that she had been scheduled for
polygraph exam did not require mistrial where district court
ordered stricken the reference to the polygraph exam and
explained to jury that polygraph examination results are
inadmissible), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 1000 (1996).

<p><a name="N_1_">1. </a>   "R. ___" refers to the docket entries on the district court's
docket sheet at item 25 of the Excerpts of Record filed with
Defendant's brief.  "Br. __" refers to pages in defendant's
brief.  "Motions Tr. ___" refers to pages in the transcribed
Motions hearing conducted by the district court on March 16,
1999.  "Tr. ____" refers to pages in the transcript of the trial
held June 10-11 and 15-16, 1999.  "U.S. Exh. ___" refers to the
United States' trial exhibits.  
<p><a name="N_2_">2. </a>   In addition to showing an agreement between two or more
persons and an intent to commit the violation, defendant states
(Br. 13) that the government must also prove an "overt act" in
order to show the existence of a civil rights conspiracy under
Section 241.  This Court made clear in <u>United States</u> v. <u>Skillman</u>,
922 F.2d 1370, 1375 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. dismissed, 502 U.S.
922 (1991), however, that unlike the proof required by the
general conspiracy statute, 18 U.S.C. 371, which requires proof
of an overt act, Section 241 makes no mention of such a
requirement.  
<p><a name="N_3_">3. </a>   The substantive right being violated is that protected by 42
U.S.C. 1982 and the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. 3601, <u>et</u> <u>seq.</u>,
which protects the right of all citizens to use and hold property
without interference based on race.
