  <p><b>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</b></p>
  <p><b>Background</b></p>
  <p>The Controlled Substances Export Reform Act of 2005 (Pub. L. 109- 57) was
  enacted on August 2, 2005. The Act amended the Controlled Substances Import
  and Export Act to provide authority for the Attorney General (and DEA, by
  delegation) <sup>1</sup> to authorize the export of controlled substances from the
  United States to another country for subsequent export from that country to a
  second country, if certain conditions and safeguards are satisfied.&nbsp;</p>

                <hr NOSHADE WIDTH="90%" COLOR="#9C0000">

  <p><sup>1</sup> 28 CFR 0.100(b).&nbsp;</p>

                <hr NOSHADE WIDTH="90%" COLOR="#9C0000">

  <p>Previously under the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act (prior to
  the 2005 legislation), there were no circumstances in which it was permissible
  to export a controlled substance in Schedules I and II, or a narcotic
  controlled substance in Schedules III and IV, for the purpose of reexport to
  another country. Such controlled substances could lawfully be exported only to
  the immediate country where they would be consumed.&nbsp;</p>
  <p> With the passage of the
  Controlled Substances Export Reform Act of 2005, Congress added a new
  provision, designated Section 1003(f) of the Controlled Substances Import and
  Export Act (21 U.S.C. 953(f)), which states:</p>
  <p>Notwithstanding [21 U.S.C. 953] subsections (a)(4) and (c)(3), the Attorney
  General may authorize any controlled substance that is in schedule I or II, or
  is a narcotic drug in schedule III or IV, to be exported from the United
  States to a country for subsequent export from that country to another
  country, if each of the following conditions is met:&nbsp;</p>
  <p> (1) Both the country to
  which the controlled substance is exported from the United States (referred to
  in this subsection as the 'first country') and the country to which the
  controlled substance is exported from the first country (referred to in this
  subsection as the 'second country') are parties to the Single Convention on
  Narcotic Drugs, 1961, and the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, 1971.&nbsp;</p>
  <p> (2)
  The first country and the second country have each instituted and maintain, in
  conformity with such Conventions, a system of controls of imports of
  controlled substances which the Attorney General deems adequate.&nbsp;</p>
  <p> (3) With
  respect to the first country, the controlled substance is consigned to a
  holder of such permits or licenses as may be required under the laws of such
  country, and a permit or license to import the controlled substance has been
  issued by the country.&nbsp;</p>
  <p> (4) With respect to the second country, substantial
  evidence is furnished to the Attorney General by the person who will export
  the controlled substance from the United States that--&nbsp;</p>
  <p> (A) The controlled
  substance is to be consigned to a holder of such permits or licenses as may be
  required under the laws of such country, and a permit or license to import the
  controlled substance is to be issued by the country; and&nbsp;</p>
  <p> (B) The controlled
  substance is to be applied exclusively to medical, scientific, or other
  legitimate uses within the country.&nbsp;</p>
  <p> (5) The controlled substance will not be
  exported from the second country.&nbsp;</p>
  <p> (6) Within 30 days after the controlled
  substance is exported from the first country to the second country, the person
  who exported the controlled substance from the United States delivers to the
  Attorney General documentation certifying that such export from the first
  country has occurred.&nbsp;</p>
  <p> (7) A permit to export the controlled substance from the
  United States has been issued by the Attorney General.</p>
  <p><b>Note:</b> The above text of the Act is published for the convenience of the
  reader, given that the Act sets forth what are essentially regulatory
  requirements that must be directly incorporated into this proposed rule. The
  official text is published at 21 U.S.C. 953(f).</p>
  <p><b>DEA Proposed Implementation of the Controlled Substances Export Reform Act
  of 2005</b></p>
  <p>The rule being proposed here would amend DEA regulations to implement this
  new legislation. Most of the amendments to the regulations being proposed here
  either reiterate the new statutory provisions added by the 2005 Act or specify
  the procedural details for complying with the new statutory provisions. In
  three respects, however, the proposed rule contains substantive requirements
  not contained in the statute. The first additional proposed requirement is
  that the reexporter notify DEA when the shipment leaves the United States. The
  second additional proposed requirement is that the reexport from the first
  country to the second country take place within 90 days after the shipment
  leaves the United States. The third additional proposed requirement is that
  bulk materials undergo further manufacturing in the first country prior to
  being shipped to the second country. This is the same requirement contained in
  existing DEA regulations for reexports of nonnarcotic controlled substances in
  Schedules III and IV and Schedule V controlled substances (21 CFR
  1312.27(b)(5)).&nbsp;</p>
  <p> It is proposed that these three additional requirements would
  entail minimal regulatory burden yet allow the agency to carry out the 2005
  Act more effectively. Under the 2005 Act (subsection (6)), Congress mandated
  that the reexporter notify DEA within 30 days after the controlled substance
  is shipped from the first country to the second country. It can be inferred
  that one purpose of this provision is to provide a means for DEA to maintain
  an awareness of the status of shipments leaving the United States for reexport
  and thereby enhance the agency's ability to monitor and prevent diversion of
  such shipments. The three additional proposed requirements listed above
  further this same goal by eliminating the possibility that DEA would be unable
  to ascertain the status of an approved reexport for an indefinite period of
  time. Without the requirements being proposed here, a scenario could arise in
  which DEA has issued a permit authorizing a reexport, yet be without
  sufficient documentation to determine whether the shipment (i) has remained
  for many months in the first country without being reexported, (ii) has been
  improperly reexported to a different second country than that indicated on the
  reexport application, or (iii) was properly reexported to the second country
  but the reexporter failed to notify DEA within 30 days as required by the
  statute. The proposed additional notification requirement and the 90-day time
  limit for reexports is intended to minimize the likelihood of such
  uncertainties regarding the status of reexport shipments and thereby minimize
  the likelihood of diversion.&nbsp;</p>
  <p> Requiring that reexports be completed within a
  finite time frame is also consistent with the historical approach in the DEA
  regulations that export permits be of a finite duration. See 21 CFR 1312.25
  (setting forth expiration dates for export permits and providing maximum
  duration of six months).&nbsp;</p>
  <p> Finally, it is anticipated that it will not be unduly
  burdensome for reexporters to notify DEA within 30 days after the shipment has
  left the United States or to complete the reexport within 90 days thereafter.
  DEA notes that the statute requires the reexporter (as a condition of
  obtaining an export permit from DEA) to specify both the first and the second
  countries, and to provide substantial evidence that, with respect to the
  second country, the controlled substance is to be consigned to a holder of
  such permits or licenses as may be required under the laws of such country,
  and a permit or license to import the controlled substance is to be issued by
  the country.</p>
  <p>[[Page 61438]]</p>
  <p>Further, the statute requires the exporter to provide substantial evidence
  that the controlled substance is to be applied exclusively to medical,
  scientific, or other legitimate uses within the second country. Therefore, DEA
  anticipates that reexporters will, themselves, seek to complete the reexport
  well within 90 days of arriving within the first country. DEA welcomes
  comments on these and any other relevant considerations.</p>
  <p><b>Treaty Considerations</b></p>
  <p>The first two subsections of the 2005 Act pertain to the Single Convention
  on Narcotic Drugs, 1961 (Single Convention), and the Convention on
  Psychotropic Substances, 1971 (Psychotropic Convention). Under these
  provisions, a reexport may take place only if both the first and second
  country are parties to both treaties and only if the Attorney General (DEA)
  determines that both the first country and the second country maintain an
  adequate system of controls in conformity with the treaties.&nbsp;</p>
  <p> Thus, Congress
  expressly intended that reexports take place in accordance with the treaties.
  The control measures imposed under the 2005 Act, along with the regulations
  being proposed here, are intended to work in tandem with the international
  control regimes under the treaties. The ultimate goal of the 2005 Act and this
  proposed rule is to permit exportation of controlled substances in Schedules I
  and II and narcotic controlled substances in Schedules III and IV from the
  United States to a first country for subsequent exportation to one or more
  second countries while preventing international diversion resulting from
  reexports. Whenever considering safeguards against diversion of international
  shipments, one must bear in mind the backdrop of the treaties. Toward this
  end, the following treaty principles are noted.&nbsp;</p>
  <p> Under the Single Convention,
  each country that is a party to the treaty is required to furnish the
  International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) with annual estimates of, among
  other things, the quantities of narcotic drugs on hand, the anticipated
  amounts that will be consumed by the party for legitimate purposes, and the
  anticipated production quantities. The Single Convention also requires parties
  to furnish the INCB with statistical returns for the prior year, indicating
  the amounts of drugs produced, utilized, consumed, imported, exported, seized,
  disposed of, and in stock. The Psychotropic Convention requires the parties to
  provide the INCB with statistical reports and assessments containing similar
  information with respect to psychotropic substances. Through the collection of
  this information, the INCB provides exporting countries with information on
  the legitimate requirements of the importing countries and can take steps to
  reduce the likelihood of international diversion. For example, the INCB may
  notify parties if the quantity of drugs exported to a particular country
  exceeded the estimates for that country. Parties that receive such
  notification from the INCB are prohibited from authorizing further exports of
  the drug concerned to that country.&nbsp;</p>
  <p> The United States has always viewed as
  critical its obligation to work with the INCB closely to monitor imports and
  exports, and to take additional appropriate measures to safeguard against
  diversion. Therefore, based on the principles of the Single Convention and
  Psychotropic Convention pertaining to international drug control, and based on
  the requirements of the Controlled Substances Export Reform Act regarding the
  reporting of reexportations, DEA is proposing the additional requirements
  discussed above to ensure that DEA has the information necessary to determine
  whether controlled substances shipments intended for reexportation are
  occurring as initially reported to DEA or being diverted to illicit purposes.</p>
  <p><b>Issuance of Permits</b></p>
  <p>Under the 2005 Act, before a controlled substance can be exported for
  subsequent reexport, the exporter must obtain from DEA a permit that
  authorizes the export for this purpose. Consistent with the 2005 Act, DEA may
  only issue such permit if each of the conditions specified in the Act is met.
  Each of these conditions is restated in the proposed rule. Although most of
  these conditions are self-explanatory, some additional explanation is
  warranted.&nbsp;</p>
  <p> First, as the proposed rule indicates, DEA will be issuing a new
  application form, DEA Form 161-r, for a permit to export controlled substances
  for subsequent reexport in accordance with the 2005 Act. The proposed rule
  also indicates what will constitute "substantial evidence" for purposes of
  subsection (4) of the 2005 Act. Specifically, if on the completed DEA 161-r,
  the applicant has identified an appropriately licensed or permitted consignee
  in the second country and certified that the second country is a party to the
  Conventions and maintains a system of controls of imports consistent with the
  requirements of the treaties, and so affirmed in the affidavit section of the
  application, DEA will consider this substantial evidence that a permit or
  license to import the controlled substance will be issued by the second
  country.</p>
  <p><b>Reexportation to More Than One Second Country</b></p>
  <p>DEA believes it is consistent with the text, structure, and purpose of the
  2005 Act to allow a shipment of controlled substances to be exported from the
  United States to a "first country" for reexport to more than one "second
  country," (but not further export from any second country to a third country)
  provided the exporter notifies DEA of such intent in the application for
  export permit, and provided further that the statute is fully complied with in
  all other respects. The proposed rule expressly provides for reexport to more
  than one second country, and the new Form 161-r will be structured
  accordingly. For example, DEA must be able to determine, based on information
  contained in the permit application (DEA Form 161-r), that each named second
  country is a party to the Single Convention and Psychotropic Convention and
  that each such country has instituted and maintains, in conformity with such
  treaties, a system of controls that DEA deems adequate.</p>
  <p><b>Refused Shipments</b></p>
  <p>Under current DEA regulations, 21 CFR 1312.27(b)(5), it is permissible
  under the conditions specified therein to reexport non- narcotic controlled
  substances in Schedules III and IV, and controlled substances in Schedule V.
  Subsection 1312.27(b)(5)(iv) of this existing regulation addresses the
  situation where a shipment has been exported from the United States but is
  refused by the consignee in the country of destination (the second country),
  or is otherwise unacceptable or undeliverable. The rule being proposed here
  would apply the same type of procedures set forth in subsection
  1312.27(b)(5)(iv) to reexports under the 2005 Act, whereby the exporter may
  seek permission from DEA, in appropriate circumstances, to return the shipment
  to the registered exporter in the United States.</p>
  <p><b>Regulatory Certifications</b></p>
  <p><i>Regulatory Flexibility Act</i></p>
  <p>The Deputy Assistant Administrator hereby certifies that this rulemaking
  has been drafted in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.
  605(b)), has reviewed this regulation, and by approving it certifies that this
  regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial</p>
  <p>[[Page 61439]]</p>
  <p>number of small entities. This rulemaking permits Schedule I and II
  controlled substances, and narcotic controlled substances in Schedules III and
  IV, to be exported from the United States to the first country for subsequent
  reexport to second countries for consumption. Previously such reexportation
  was not permitted within DEA law and regulations.</p>
  <p><i>Executive Order 12866</i></p>
  <p>The Deputy Assistant Administrator further certifies that this rulemaking
  has been drafted in accordance with the principles in Executive Order 12866
  Sec. 1(b). DEA has determined that this is a significant regulatory action.
  Therefore, this action has been reviewed by the Office of Management and
  Budget.</p>
  <p><i>Executive Order 12988</i></p>
  <p>This regulation meets the applicable standards set forth in Sec. Sec. 3(a)
  and 3(b)(2) of Executive Order 12988 Civil Justice Reform.</p>
  <p><i>Executive Order 13132</i></p>
  <p>This rulemaking does not preempt or modify any provision of state law; nor
  does it impose enforcement responsibilities on any state; nor does it diminish
  the power of any state to enforce its own laws. Accordingly, this rulemaking
  does not have federalism implications warranting the application of Executive
  Order 13132.</p>
  <p><i>Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995</i></p>
  <p>This rule will not result in the expenditure by State, local, and tribal
  governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of $118,000,000 or
  more in any one year, and will not significantly or uniquely affect small
  governments. Therefore, no actions were deemed necessary under the provisions
  of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995.</p>
  <p><i>Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995</i></p>
  <p>The Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration, is revising the
  information collection entitled "Application for Permit to Export Controlled

  narcotic controlled substances in Schedules III and IV. DEA has submitted the
  new DEA Form 161-r and the information collection request to the Office of
  Management and Budget for review and clearance in accordance with review
  procedures of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. The proposed information
  collection is published to obtain comments from the public and affected

  Number as set forth in Part 1308 of this chapter, the number and size of
  packages or containers, the name and quantity of the controlled substance
  contained in any finished dosage units, and the quantity of any controlled
  substance (expressed in anhydrous acid, base, or alkaloid) given in kilograms
  or parts thereof. The application shall include the name, address, and
  business of the consignee, foreign port of entry, the port of exportation, the
  approximate date of exportation, the name of the exporting carrier or vessel
  (if known, or if unknown it should be stated whether shipment will be made by
  express, freight, or otherwise, exports of controlled substances by mail being
  prohibited), the date and number, if any, of the supporting foreign import
  license or permit accompanying the application, and the authority by whom such
  foreign license or permit was issued. The application shall also contain an
  affidavit that the packages are labeled in conformance with obligations of the
  United States under international treaties, conventions, or protocols in
  effect on May 1, 1971. The affidavit shall further state that to the best of
  affiant's knowledge and belief, the controlled substances therein are to be
  applied exclusively to medical or scientific uses within the country to which
  exported, will not be reexported therefrom and that there is an actual need
  for the controlled substance for medical or scientific uses within such
  country, unless the application is submitted for reexport in accordance with
  paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. In the case of exportation of crude
  cocaine, the affidavit may state that to the best of affiant's knowledge and
  belief, the controlled substances will be processed within the country to
  which exported, either for medical or scientific use within that country or
  for reexportation in accordance with the laws of that country to another for
  medical or scientific use within that country. The application shall be signed
  and dated by the exporter and shall contain the address from which the
  substances will be shipped for exportation.&nbsp;</p>
  <p> * * * * *&nbsp;</p>
  <p> (c) Notwithstanding
  paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the Administration may authorize any
  controlled substance listed in Schedule I or II, or any narcotic drug listed
  in Schedule III or IV, to be exported from the United States to a country for
  subsequent export from that country to another country, if each of the
  following conditions is met, in accordance with Sec. 1003(f) of the Controlled
  Substances Import and Export Act (21 U.S.C. 953(f)):&nbsp;</p>
  <p> (1) Both the country to
  which the controlled substance is exported from the United States (referred to
  in this section as the "first country") and the country to which the
  controlled substance is exported from the first country (referred to in this
  section as the "second country") are parties to the Single Convention on
  Narcotic Drugs, 1961, and the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, 1971;&nbsp;</p>
  <p> (2)
  The first country and the second country have each instituted and maintain, in
  conformity with such Conventions, a system of controls of imports of
  controlled substances which the Administration deems adequate;&nbsp;</p>
  <p> (3) With
  respect to the first country, the controlled substance is consigned to a
  holder of such permits or licenses as may be required under the laws of such
  country, and a permit or license to import the controlled substance has been
  issued by the country;&nbsp;</p>
  <p> (4) With respect to the second country, substantial
  evidence is furnished to the Administration by the applicant for the export
  permit that--&nbsp;</p>
  <p>(i) The controlled substance is to be consigned to a holder of
  such permits or licenses as may be required under the laws of such country,
  and a permit or license to import the controlled substance is to be issued by
  the country; and&nbsp;</p>
  <p> (ii) The controlled substance is to be applied exclusively to
  medical, scientific, or other legitimate uses within the country;&nbsp;</p>
  <p> (5) The
  controlled substance will not be exported from the second country;&nbsp;</p>
  <p> (6) The
  person who exported the controlled substance from the United States has
  complied with paragraph (d) of this section and a permit to export the
  controlled substance from the United States has been issued by the
  Administration; and&nbsp;</p>
  <p> (7) Within 30 days after the controlled substance is
  exported from the first country to the second country, the person who exported
  the controlled substance from the United States must deliver to the
  Administration documentation certifying that such export from the first
  country has occurred. If the permit issued by the Administration authorized
  the reexport of a controlled substance from the first country to more than one
  second country, notification of each individual reexport shall be provided.
  This documentation shall be submitted on company letterhead, signed by the
  responsible company official, and shall include the following information:&nbsp;</p>
  <p>(i)
  Name of second country;&nbsp;</p>
  <p> (ii) Actual quantity shipped;&nbsp;</p>
  <p> (iii) Actual date
  shipped; and&nbsp;</p>
  <p> (iv) DEA export permit number for the original export.&nbsp;</p>
  <p> (d) Where
  a person is seeking to export a controlled substance for</p>
  <p>[[Page 61441]]</p>
  <p>reexport in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, the following
  requirements shall apply in addition to (and not in lieu of) the requirements
  of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section:&nbsp;</p>
  <p> (1) Bulk substances will not be
  reexported in the same form as exported from the United States, i.e., the
  material must undergo further manufacturing process. This further manufactured
  material may only be reexported to a country of ultimate consumption.&nbsp;</p>
  <p> (2)
  Finished dosage units, if reexported, must be in a commercial package,
  properly sealed and labeled for legitimate medical use in the country of
  destination (the second country);&nbsp;</p>
  <p> (3) Any proposed reexportation must be made
  known to the Administration at the time the initial DEA Form 161-r is
  submitted. In addition, the following information must also be provided where
  indicated on the form:&nbsp;</p>
  <p>(i) Whether the drug or preparation will be reexported
  in bulk or finished dosage units;&nbsp;</p>
  <p> (ii) The product name, dosage strength,
  commercial package size, and quantity;&nbsp;</p>
  <p> (iii) The name of consignee, complete
  address, and expected shipment date, as well as the name and address of the
  ultimate consignee in the country to where the substances will be reexported.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>
  (4) The application (DEA Form 161-r) must also contain an affidavit that the
  consignee in the country of ultimate destination (the second country) is
  authorized under the laws and regulations of the country of ultimate
  destination to receive the controlled substances. The affidavit must also
  contain the following statement, in addition to the statements required under
  paragraph (a) of this section:&nbsp;</p>
  <p>(i) That the packages are labeled in
  conformance with the obligations of the United States under the Single
  Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961, the Convention on Psychotropic Substances,
  1971, and any amendments to such treaties;&nbsp;</p>
  <p> (ii) That the controlled substances
  are to be applied exclusively to medical or scientific uses within the country
  to which reexported (the second country);&nbsp;</p>
  <p> (iii) That the controlled substances
  will not be further reexported from the second country, and&nbsp;</p>
  <p> (iv) That there is
  an actual need for the controlled substances for medical or scientific uses
  within the second country.&nbsp;</p>
  <p> (5) If the applicant proposes that the shipment of
  controlled substances will be separated into parts after it arrives in the
  first country and then reexported to more than one second country, the
  applicant shall so indicate on the DEA Form 161-r, providing all the
  information required in this section for each second country.&nbsp;</p>
  <p> (6) Within 30
  days after the controlled substance is exported from the United States, the
  person who exported the controlled substance shall deliver to the
  Administration documentation on the DEA Form 161-r initially completed for the
  transaction certifying that such export occurred. This documentation shall be
  signed by the responsible company official and shall include the following
  information:&nbsp;</p>
  <p>(i) Actual quantity shipped;&nbsp;</p>
  <p> (ii) Actual date shipped; and&nbsp;</p>
  <p> (iii)
  DEA export permit number.&nbsp;</p>
  <p> (7) The controlled substance will be reexported from
  the first country to the second country (or second countries) no later than 90
  days after the controlled substance was exported from the United States.&nbsp;</p>
  <p> (8)
  Shipments that have been exported from the United States and are refused by
  the consignee in the country of destination (the second country), or are
  otherwise unacceptable or undeliverable, may be returned to the registered
  exporter in the United States upon authorization of the Administration. In
  these circumstances, the exporter in the United States shall file a written
  request for the return of the controlled substances to the United States with
  a brief summary of the facts that warrant the return, along with a completed
  DEA Form 357, Application for Import Permit, with the Drug Enforcement
  Administration, Import/Export Unit, Washington, DC 20537. The Administration
  will evaluate the request after considering all the facts as well as the
  exporter's registration status with the Administration. If the exporter
  provides sufficient documentation, the Administration will issue an import
  permit for the return of these drugs, and the exporter can then obtain an
  export permit from the country of original importation. The substance may be
  returned to the United States only after affirmative authorization is issued
  in writing by the Administration.&nbsp;</p>
  <p> (e) In considering whether to grant an
  application for a permit under paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, the
  Administration shall consider whether the applicant has previously obtained
  such a permit and, if so, whether the applicant complied fully with the
  requirements of this section.&nbsp;</p>
  <p> 3. Section 1312.23 is proposed to be amended by
  revising paragraphs (a) and (f) to read as follows:</p>
  <p><b>Sec. 1312.23 Issuance of export permit.</b></p>
  <p>(a) The Administration may authorize exportation of any controlled
  substance listed in Schedule I or II or any narcotic controlled substance
  listed in Schedule III or IV if he finds that such exportation is permitted by
  subsections 1003(a), (b), (c), (d), or (f) of the Act (21 U.S.C. Sec. 953(a),
  (b), (c), (d), or (f).&nbsp;</p>
  <p> * * * * *&nbsp;</p>
  <p> (f) No export permit shall be issued for the
  exportation, or reexportation, of any controlled substance to any country when
  the Administration has information to show that the estimates or assessments
  submitted with respect to that country for the current period, under the
  Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961, or the Convention on Psychotropic
  Substances, 1971, have been, or, considering the quantity proposed to be
  imported, will be exceeded. If it shall appear through subsequent advice
  received from the International Narcotics Control Board of the United Nations
  that the estimates or assessments of the country of destination have been
  adjusted to permit further importation of the controlled substance, an export
  permit may then be issued if otherwise permissible.</p>
