In Brief
The following information is reprinted from two issues of NLS 
Flash, a newsletter created to bring current information on NLS 
progress in digital technology to patrons, library staff, and 
other interested individuals.

Flash, December 2006, volume 3, issue 1

NLS forms advisory committee for digital transition
With the design and development of digital talking books, 
machines, and containers nearly complete, the National Library 
Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped (NLS), Library of 
Congress, is planning the next stage of the digital project-
implementation. Beginning in 2008, NLS will phase in the 
production and distribution of digital talking books and players 
while phasing out recorded cassettes and C-1 analog talking-book 
machines. NLS has organized the Digital Transition Advisory 
Committee to advise the process during its pivotal first three 
years. The committee, made up of consumer representatives and 
regional and state librarians, will meet for the first time on 
January 30, 2007, in Washington, D.C., to discuss key issues.
	"We have reached an important point in the digital project. 
Our focus is shifting from design and development to production 
and distribution," said Frank Kurt Cylke, NLS director. "We are 
eager to get digital audiobooks into the hands of our patrons." 
	The advisory committee will serve three primary purposes. 
First, it will be a channel for informing user groups, the network 
of cooperating regional libraries, and state librarians about 
NLS's plans for distributing digital talking books and players. 
Key stakeholders will thus know what to expect when implementation 
begins. Second, committee participants will review distribution 
plans to ensure that no significant considerations are overlooked. 
Finally, members will offer new and emerging ideas for improving 
the transition process. 
	This Digital Transition Advisory Committee succeeds the 
Digital Long-Term Planning Group, which was tasked with advising 
NLS on the design and development process for digital talking 
books and players. The planning group completed its assignment. 
The advisory committee will help to move the transition process 
forward. 
	The fourteen-member committee includes consumer 
representatives from the American Council of the Blind, the 
Blinded Veterans Association, and the National Federation of the 
Blind. Regional librarians representing the Midlands, Northern, 
Southern, and Western Conferences and a representative from the 
Consortium of User Libraries will also serve on the committee. 
Additionally, the group includes six state librarians from 
different parts of the country. 

Taking the lead
Carolyn Sung, chief of the NLS Network Division, will chair the 
advisory committee. The Network Division offers direct service and 
support to NLS's network of cooperating libraries. Because it 
maintains regular contact with the libraries, it is the most 
logical choice for channeling communication about the digital 
transition. 
	"The role of the Network Division is ultimately to help 
librarians to do their work and to provide them with the resources 
they need," said Sung. "Our goal is to ensure that librarians 
nationwide continue to be informed about the transition so that 
they can adequately prepare to provide digital offerings to 
patrons in 2008."
	The Network Division has been engaged in the digital project 
from the beginning. Steve Prine, assistant chief of the Network 
Division, serves on NLS's Digital Audio Development (DAD) 
executive committee, which has focused on the development of the 
player and cartridge, and he, along with Sung, will be presenting 
relevant issues to the implementation committee at the inaugural 
meeting. 

Implementation issues
The advisory committee will be presented with a full progress 
report on the development of the digital player, cartridge, and 
container. The state of the digital book download project and 
other automation concerns will also be addressed. The main focus 
of the meeting, however, will be to discuss distribution plans. 
	After the transition period in 2012, NLS will revisit the 
distribution system issues. The organization will consider whether 
to continue mass-duplication of all digital titles or adopt a 
hybrid system, in which the most popular titles will be mass 
produced and less popular titles will be duplicated on demand. The 
cost of digital duplication is expected to decrease steadily over 
the next years, and implementation of a hybrid system may not be 
cost-efficient by 2012. 
	Among the transition issues to be discussed at the advisory 
committee meeting are book and player distribution, shelving, 
duplication, circulation system modifications, machine 
distributing and monitoring issues, and copy allotment.
	According to Prine, successful implementation across the 
network is based on librarians fully understanding the new 
dynamics and processes associated with the digital program. "The 
digital transition will be a complex process, but we're confident 
that with adequate preparation the implementation will be 
seamless," noted Prine.

NLS submits request to fund digital transition
As the digital transition project progresses toward its 2008 
initiation date, the National Library Service for the Blind and 
Physically Handicapped (NLS), Library of Congress, is pursuing its 
plan for a successful launch. A formal funding request has been 
submitted to Congress by the Library of Congress to support a 
four-year transition plan. NLS has requested $76.4 million to 
support the production and distribution of digital talking books 
(DTBs), digital players, flash-memory cartridges, and containers. 
If approved, funds will be disbursed in four equal increments.  
	"This funding request is based on the thorough research and 
analysis of projected costs by NLS experts, our consultants, and 
contractors working on the digital program. Careful assessment of 
the upcoming stages of the program led to the conclusion that 
$76.4 million will be required to support the transition through 
completion, ensuring little disruption in service to patrons," 
said Frank Kurt Cylke, NLS director. "We are hopeful that our 
request will be met so that we may successfully achieve the 
project's goals."
	The digital project, in progress for more than a decade, will 
update talking-book technology by replacing cassette books and 
players with flash-based digital talking books and players. Three 
main factors spurred the transition to digital-improved patron 
service, patron expectations, and cassette obsolescence. Digital 
talking books will greatly enhance the reading experience, 
offering users crisper, clearer audio; significant navigation 
capabilities; and greater convenience. The new players are lighter 
and smaller and, in 95 percent of cases, one cartridge will hold a 
complete book. Finally, NLS is moving toward digital because 
analog technology has become outdated, and cassettes and player 
parts are increasingly expensive and difficult to locate. Unlike 
the cassette player, the digital player contains no moving parts, 
making it more reliable and less susceptible to mechanical 
failure.

Benefits of digital technology
Digital technology offers multiple benefits! The player's smaller 
and lighter frame makes the machine more portable and provides 
patrons more options in where they choose to read. The machine is 
also user-friendly, because of the shape, tactility, and color 
markings of the player's buttons; the ease with which cartridges 
may be inserted and ejected; and optimal audio help features. This 
last function enables patrons to access audio instructions on 
machine use at the touch of a button, allowing them to read 
independently. Equipped with an extended-life battery, the digital 
player also runs longer-approximately sixteen hours-and is more 
cost efficient for NLS to maintain and repair. The flash platform 
can be easily adapted for use by basic, advanced, and download 
users.
	Readers are likely to enjoy the digital talking book's 
superior audio quality. The system's improved navigation 
capabilities will offer patrons greater control over the reading 
process. The digital talking-book cartridge can sustain a 
surprising degree of abuse and still continue to function 
efficiently. Furthermore, once a title is no longer in high 
demand, cartridges may be reloaded and recirculated with no 
degradation in sound quality or performance.  
	To ensure that the digital player meets the needs of its 
users and to guarantee compliance with intellectual property law, 
NLS has chosen to provide a player built to its own 
specifications. 
	The digital player and flash cartridge are based on open 
standards developed by the National Information Standards 
Organization (NISO) so that NLS can obtain products from a number 
of sources instead of a single provider, ensuring that the devices 
are always available. While the system complies with open 
standards, it adheres to a legislated special format to protect 
its intellectual property. 
	The digital machine also has the advantage of being 
significantly more durable than the cassette player, resulting in 
a longer lifespan. Built to endure rough handling and transit 
through the mail system, even three-foot drops, the player also 
features easy-to-clean surfaces so it is easy for patrons to 
maintain and may be reissued over its long lifespan.
	The player's controls facilitate use by both blind and 
physically handicapped readers. The buttons are easy to discover 
and appropriately sized. In most cases the shape denotes their 
function and they are labeled in both print and braille.  

Digital production and distribution 
Taking the digital player from concept to manufacturing was a team 
effort. NLS has engaged the expertise of industry leaders in 
product design and development and in the fields of blindness and 
physical disability research to ensure the best player for our 
users. The process has involved extensive user testing of the 
player's hardware and software.
	As the digital talking-book's design and development stage 
draws to a close, NLS is planning for the production and 
distribution phase. Over the course of four years, NLS will phase 
out cassette books and players as it phases in digital talking 
books and digital players. 
	In 2008, NLS will initiate production of flash-memory 
machines as well as duplication and distribution of digital 
talking-book cartridges. From 2009 to 2010, NLS will increase 
production of digital books while continuing to provide some 
cassette titles. NLS will stop producing cassette books entirely 
in 2011. NLS plans to produce enough digital titles and players 
between 2008 and 2011 to sustain the digital program without 
service disruptions.

[picture of the digital talking-book player]
[Caption] 
Weighing only 2 pounds, the new digital talking-book machines are 
smaller and lighter than current cassette players. The tactile 
buttons, color-coded and shaped to facilitate user ease, are just 
one feature that will enhance reading pleasure. The basic model 
shown here varies only slightly from the advanced version, which 
includes additional buttons for the advanced navigation functions. 
The flash cartridge featured on the right will, in 95 percent of 
cases, hold an entire book, reducing the number of moving parts to 
keep track of.
