Indenting an Entire Region
--------------------------

   This section describes commands that indent all the lines in the
region.  They return unpredictable values.

 - Command: indent-region start end to-column
     This command indents each nonblank line starting between START
     (inclusive) and END (exclusive).  If TO-COLUMN is `nil',
     `indent-region' indents each nonblank line by calling the current
     mode's indentation function, the value of `indent-line-function'.

     If TO-COLUMN is non-`nil', it should be an integer specifying the
     number of columns of indentation; then this function gives each
     line exactly that much indentation, by either adding or deleting
     whitespace.

     If there is a fill prefix, `indent-region' indents each line by
     making it start with the fill prefix.

 - Variable: indent-region-function
     The value of this variable is a function that can be used by
     `indent-region' as a short cut.  You should design the function so
     that it will produce the same results as indenting the lines of the
     region one by one, but presumably faster.

     If the value is `nil', there is no short cut, and `indent-region'
     actually works line by line.

     A short-cut function is useful in modes such as C mode and Lisp
     mode, where the `indent-line-function' must scan from the
     beginning of the function definition: applying it to each line
     would be quadratic in time.  The short cut can update the scan
     information as it moves through the lines indenting them; this
     takes linear time.  In a mode where indenting a line individually
     is fast, there is no need for a short cut.

     `indent-region' with a non-`nil' argument TO-COLUMN has a
     different meaning and does not use this variable.

 - Command: indent-rigidly start end count
     This command indents all lines starting between START (inclusive)
     and END (exclusive) sideways by COUNT columns.  This "preserves
     the shape" of the affected region, moving it as a rigid unit.
     Consequently, this command is useful not only for indenting
     regions of unindented text, but also for indenting regions of
     formatted code.

     For example, if COUNT is 3, this command adds 3 columns of
     indentation to each of the lines beginning in the region specified.

     In Mail mode, `C-c C-y' (`mail-yank-original') uses
     `indent-rigidly' to indent the text copied from the message being
     replied to.

 - Function: indent-code-rigidly start end columns &amp;optional
          nochange-regexp
     This is like `indent-rigidly', except that it doesn't alter lines
     that start within strings or comments.

     In addition, it doesn't alter a line if NOCHANGE-REGEXP matches at
     the beginning of the line (if NOCHANGE-REGEXP is non-`nil').
