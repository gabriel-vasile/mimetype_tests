<p align="center"><font face="Palatino,Book Antiqua"><b><u>IMPLEMENTATION
OF TASK FORCE RECOMMENDATIONS</u></b></font></p>

<p><font face="Palatino,Book Antiqua"><b>1. The Task Force issued
guidelines and recommendations to assist air carriers in
responding to aviation disasters. </b></font></p>

<p><font face="Palatino,Book Antiqua"><b>1.1 The Task Force
recommended that the definition of &quot;family member&quot; for
purposes of notification and provision of airline services should
not be rigidly defined.</b></font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font face="Palatino,Book Antiqua">The Task Force found
        that airlines should not rigidly define family member for
        purposes of notification and provision of services, so
        that the airlines can extend notification and services to
        those who may not meet the legal definition of &quot;next
        of kin.&quot; Airlines recognize that the definition of
        family member could be extended to close friends or
        companions of the victim, and usually will provide
        services to those persons. Most U.S. air carriers
        determine family members for purposes of notification and
        provision of services on a case-by-case basis, as
        familial situations vary. Carriers would choose to err of
        the side of being inclusive rather than exclusive. </font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Palatino,Book Antiqua"><b>1.2 The Task Force
proffered guidelines for the initial notification of family
members by the air carrier in the immediate aftermath of an
aviation disaster, including the use of third parties to assist
in the notification process.</b></font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font face="Palatino,Book Antiqua">The U.S. House of
        Representatives passed legislation that would amend the
        Family Assistance Acts (the Aviation Disaster Family
        Assistance Act of 1996, which applies primarily to U.S.
        air carriers, and the Foreign Air Carrier Family Support
        Act of 1997) to include an assurance by air carriers that
        they will inform the family, upon request, whether the
        passenger&#146;s name appeared on a preliminary passenger
        manifest for the flight involved in the accident. </font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><font face="Palatino,Book Antiqua">Major air carrier
        plans call for the notification of families individually
        if they have information that a family member was on
        board the flight, rather than waiting for whole manifest
        to be released. While a toll-free number is required by
        law, certain airlines also provide additional toll-free
        numbers such as one for relatives once they initially
        call in, so that they will not experience a busy signal
        or delay if they call again. In addition, many airlines
        have also instituted a &quot;Call Home&quot; program for
        employees, whereby employees contact their families once
        the disaster occurs so that phone lines are cleared for
        passenger families.</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><font face="Palatino,Book Antiqua">After first notifying
        their families, Swissair initially posted the names of
        227 people on the flight on its website, </font><a
        href="http://www.swissair.com/"><font
        face="Palatino,Book Antiqua">www.swissair.com</font></a><font
        face="Palatino,Book Antiqua">., in an effort to limit
        phone inquiries to the airline following an aviation
        disaster. Major U.S. air carriers have similar plans to
        utilize the internet in such a situation.</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><font face="Palatino,Book Antiqua">With respect to the
        use of third parties to assist in the notification
        process, the National Air Carrier Association (NACA), on
        behalf of Miami Air International, North American
        Airlines, Omni Air International, Tower Air, and World
        Airways, reached arrangements with Family Enterprises,
        Inc., to provide aviation crisis management services in
        event of an aviation disaster anywhere in the world.
        According to NACA, who served as a member of the Task
        Force, Family Enterprises has assured each carrier that
        in the event of an aviation disaster, Family Enterprises
        will handle the disaster by providing all of the
        toll-free number communication requirements, coordination
        with the next of kin, and on- site representation at the
        scene.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Palatino,Book Antiqua"><b>1.3 The Task Force
recommended that airlines assist family members with travel to
and accommodations at accident sites and memorial services.</b></font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font face="Palatino,Book Antiqua">Major air carriers
        have adopted plans to assure that family member travel
        should not be delayed due to full flights to the location
        of the family assistance center or requirements to fly on
        a particular carrier. Other air carriers will work with
        families to ensure that they spend the appropriate amount
        of time at a family assistance center. United Airlines,
        for example, has placed into its family assistance plan a
        provision that would allow a family to travel between the
        accident site and their residence, if the family so
        chooses.</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><font face="Palatino,Book Antiqua">The U.S. House of
        Representatives has also passed legislation that would
        amend the Family Assistance Acts to include language
        stating that &quot;nothing may be construed as limiting
        the actions that an air carrier may take, or obligations
        that an air carrier may have, in providing assistance to
        the families of passengers involved in an aircraft
        accident.&quot; </font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><font face="Palatino,Book Antiqua">Swissair arranged
        special daily charter flights to Halifax from New York
        and Switzerland for families to visit the crash site and
        to receive briefings on the status of investigations. In
        Halifax, 900 rooms were reserved for families of victims,
        along with transportation to Peggy&#146;s Cove near the
        site of the crash. Families gathering in New York at JFK
        Airport were lodged at a nearby hotel.</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><font face="Palatino,Book Antiqua">In addition to
        provision of travel and lodging, the Task Force
        recommended that airlines consider the provision of
        financial assistance to families in their time of need.
        The European Union Council proposed a regulation in
        October 1997, which would require its member airlines to
        compensate those persons or families involved in an
        airline disaster within fifteen days after the identity
        of the person. Advance payments are to be made to meet
        immediate economic needs on a basis proportional to
        hardship suffered. The payment should not be less than
        the equivalent in ecus (European currency units) of
        15,000 SDR (special drawing rights) per passenger in the
        event of death (1 SDR = 1.3664 US dollars). If airlines
        choose not to provide compensation, the airline must
        inform the passengers at the time of ticket purchase.
        Swissair chose to make a lump sum payment to each family
        in the amount of $US 20000.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Palatino,Book Antiqua"><b>1.4 The Task Force
prepared guidelines for training of air carrier personnel who
interact with family members. </b></font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font face="Palatino,Book Antiqua">Legislation passed by
        the U.S. House of Representatives would amend the Family
        Assistance Acts to include assurances by the air carriers
        that they will provide adequate training to their
        employees and agents to meet the needs of survivors and
        family members following an accident. Many air carriers
        had family assistance plans in place prior to the
        enactment of the legislation. TWA, for instance,
        implemented a family assistance plan with a training
        component in 1992.</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><font face="Palatino,Book Antiqua">All major U.S. air
        carriers have already implemented and improved their
        training plans and programs designed to meet the needs of
        families in the aftermath of aviation disasters.
        Continental Airlines, for instance, has implemented
        different types of training for different levels of
        personnel: emergency volunteers, front line reservations
        personnel, airline personnel, station managers, and
        corporate communication vendors. Northwest Airlines has a
        training program that, among other aspects, trains
        &quot;Assist Members&quot; to provide for logistical
        assistance to family members in a caring and
        compassionate way.</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><font face="Palatino,Book Antiqua">The Task Force also
        recommended that an explanation of the role of the
        government be included in airline training sessions. The
        National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), as well as
        the Department of Transportation (DOT), have participated
        in many airline training sessions to explain to the
        airlines the government&#146;s role in aviation disaster
        response, so that the government and the airlines can
        coordinate in assisting families.</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><font face="Palatino,Book Antiqua">The Task Force found
        that airline training programs should use survivors and
        family members to share their personal experiences either
        in person or on video tape during the training process.
        Many U.S. air carriers, including American Airlines,
        utilize family member testimony in their preparedness
        training sessions. Task Force members Frank Carven, Joe
        Lychner, and Kendra St. Charles have all participated in
        various airline training sessions to emphasize to airline
        employees the necessity of prepared personnel in the
        event of an aviation disaster.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Palatino,Book Antiqua"><b>1.5 The Task Force
stressed the importance of the return of personal effects
(property) to the family members by the airline.</b></font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font face="Palatino,Book Antiqua">Many airlines hold
        personal effects for time periods longer than 18 months,
        the time required by the Family Assistance Acts, so as to
        afford families as much time as necessary to receive
        effects at each family&#146;s personal pace.</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><font face="Palatino,Book Antiqua">The Task Force also
        recommended that airlines retain a private company that
        specializes in the identification and return of personal
        effects to ensure adequate and effective return of
        passenger property. </font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><font face="Palatino,Book Antiqua">Kenyon International
        Emergency Services, a provider of services associated
        with personal effects, continues to work with the NTSB
        two years after the TWA 800 crash in returning personal
        items to families, and is working with Swissair on the
        return of the personnel effects to families of Flight 111
        passengers. Other air carriers have contractual
        arrangements with other service providers in this area.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Palatino,Book Antiqua"><b>1.6 The Task Force
offered guidelines concerning the interaction between the
airlines and American Red Cross in assisting the victims of
aviation disasters.</b></font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font face="Palatino,Book Antiqua">The NTSB has
        designated the American Red Cross (ARC) as the
        &quot;independent nonprofit organization&quot; to provide
        for the emotional well-being of survivors and families
        who lost loved ones in an aviation disaster. Accepting
        this role, the ARC has initiated plans to prepare for and
        implement that role in the event of an aviation disaster
        involving foreign or domestic carriers that occur within
        the continental United States. Recognizing that this role
        must be implemented in close coordination with the
        activities of the NTSB, affected air carriers, airports,
        emergency response agencies, and related agencies and
        organizations, the ARC has developed procedures and
        activities to meet its responsibilities, and continues to
        do so. The ARC has prepared a document intended to
        provide agencies and organizations with an overview of
        the preparedness and response activities that the ARC
        will provide for aviation disasters. Included in this
        document are preparedness and response activities for
        local chapters and national headquarters, as well as
        assigned duties for aviation incident response teams and
        disaster relief operations. </font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><font face="Palatino,Book Antiqua">The NTSB Office of
        Family Affairs hosted a meeting this year with
        representatives from domestic, international, and
        regional air carriers, along with representatives of the
        ARC. The ARC presented information on its accomplishments
        and its objectives for the upcoming year. They also
        discussed the guidance provided to its local chapters on
        working with local airline representatives and airports
        to assist them in developing their plans. This forum
        provided ample opportunity for all participants to ask
        and respond to questions, resulting in beneficial
        information sharing.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Palatino,Book Antiqua"><b>2. The Task Force issued
recommendations to ensure that families of non-U.S. citizens
involved in an aviation disaster receive appropriate assistance
from both the airline and the U.S. government.</b></font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font face="Palatino,Book Antiqua">Since the issuance of
        the Task Force report, the Department of State has
        implemented and otherwise acted in furtherance of a
        number of the Final Report's recommendations. The State
        Department was pleased with the promptness with which a
        toll-free number was established after the crash of
        Swissair Flight 111 for the families, as well as the
        swift deployment of care givers by Swissair and Delta Air
        Lines to assist the families in Switzerland, Canada, New
        York, and in the homes of many families who chose not to
        fly to Halifax. These two procedures, as recommended in
        the Task Force's Report, helped to allay anxiety and
        frustrations of family members during the immediate hours
        and days following the crash.</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><font face="Palatino,Book Antiqua">The State Department
        has entered into a Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) with
        14 U.S. air carriers reflecting Best Practices and
        Procedures in the event of an aviation disaster. The MOU
        provides a basis for cooperation and mutual assistance in
        reacting to aviation disasters occurring outside the
        United States with the goal of improving the treatment of
        victims&#146; families. </font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><font face="Palatino,Book Antiqua">The Swissair Flight
        111 crash on September 2, 1998, was the first time the
        MOU was utilized. The MOU between the State Department
        and Delta Air Lines inspired two positive changes to the
        State Department's response to an aviation disaster.
        First, the Department received in a timely manner the
        manifest from Swissair/Delta Air Lines. Secondly, liaison
        officers from Delta Air Lines joined the Department of
        State Working Group and provided information and insights
        that were critical to avoid miscommunications.</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><font face="Palatino,Book Antiqua">The Department of
        State is also appreciative of the roles played by the DOT
        and NTSB in the aftermath of the crash of Swissair Flight
        111. The NTSB, at the invitation of the State Department,
        was asked to send family affairs personnel to the recent
        Swissair 111 crash off the Halifax coast. Two family
        affairs officers were dispatched to the scene where they
        assisted State Department consular officers in ensuring
        that American victims and families were given all the
        assistance they needed. An NTSB forensic anthropologist
        was invited into the temporary morgue established by the
        Canadian government.</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><font face="Palatino,Book Antiqua">DOT also assisted the
        State Department by focusing on the need for presumptive
        death certificates. This helped to facilitate the
        acquisition of the victims&#146; presumptive death
        certificates, which becomes necessary for the victim's
        families until the report of death can be completed.</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><font face="Palatino,Book Antiqua">Since the issuance of
        the Final Report, the State Department has maintained a
        dialogue with the airlines by participating in training
        exercises and visiting airline crisis centers.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Palatino,Book Antiqua"><b>3. The Task Force issued
recommendations to improve the passenger manifests (or other
systems) used by the airlines to establish points of contact with
families of passengers.</b></font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font face="Palatino,Book Antiqua">The Department of
        Transportation issued on February 18, 1998, a final rule
        to require enhanced passenger manifests for flights to or
        from the United States. The rule, effective October 1,
        1998, will require certificated U.S. and foreign air
        carriers to collect a full name of each U.S. citizen
        traveling on flight segments to or from the United
        States, and to solicit a contact name and phone number.
        The rule allows each carrier to develop its own
        collection system. Implementation of the rule will
        provide the government with prompt and adequate
        information in the event of an aviation disaster and
        permit the State Department to carry forth its
        responsibility to notify families of U.S. citizens killed
        overseas in a timely manner. </font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><font face="Palatino,Book Antiqua">The State Department
        looks forward to the implementation of the passenger
        manifest rule on October 1, 1998. This will assist the
        Department in determining who is a United States citizen
        so that it may fulfill its legal obligations to either
        the individual or his or her family in the event of an
        aviation disaster abroad.</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><font face="Palatino,Book Antiqua">Airlines are working
        to ensure that they can comply with the passenger
        manifest rule. Over 80 U.S. air carriers and over 150
        foreign air carriers have filed plans with DOT on how
        they will improve their passenger manifests. Others are
        conducting drills to ensure that the manifest is
        confirmed in the most timely manner possible. In
        particular, one airline has dedicated a room used only
        for emergency passenger manifest operations, and has
        assigned the function of passenger manifest coordination
        to their 24-hours reservations center. In addition,
        during a recent drill conducted by Continental Airlines
        for members of the Task Force, the average time for a
        name to be confirmed on the manifest was less than one
        minute. </font></li>
</ul>

<ol start="4">
    <li><font face="Palatino,Book Antiqua"><b>The Task Force
        issued recommendations on uniform guidelines for medical
        examiners and coroners on the identification of the
        remains of victims.</b></font></li>
</ol>

<ul>
    <li><font face="Palatino,Book Antiqua">The NTSB continues its
        dialogue with the medical examiner community that was
        established last year when Chairman Jim Hall spoke at the
        annual meeting of the National Association of Medical
        Examiners. Since then the Board has initiated discussions
        with the medical examiner community on the many sensitive
        identification issues associated with an aviation
        disaster. Just recently the Board was able to provide
        advice to the Canadian medical examiner responsible for
        the identification of victims of Swissair Flight 111.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Palatino,Book Antiqua"><b>5. The Task Force
provided findings on the extent to which military experts and
facilities are used to aid in the recovery efforts and subsequent
identification efforts following an aviation disaster. </b></font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font face="Palatino,Book Antiqua">The NTSB continues to
        work with the Department of Defense (DOD) in recovery
        efforts. The NTSB utilized DOD&#146;s DNA capability for
        the identification effort involving Korean Air Flight
        801. The NTSB was also instrumental in assisting the
        medical examiner tasked with the identification of
        passengers of Swissair Flight 111 in obtaining DOD DNA
        support, and assisted the Canadian Transportation Safety
        Board in obtaining U.S. naval salvage support. </font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Palatino,Book Antiqua"><b>6. The Task Force issued
recommendations to ensure that state mental health licensing laws
do not act to prevent out-of-state mental health workers from
working at the site of an aviation disaster or other sites to
assist survivors, family members, and those involved in the
recovery effort.</b></font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font face="Palatino,Book Antiqua">The U.S. House of
        Representatives amended portions of the Family Assistance
        Acts by adding language that prohibits actions by a state
        or political subdivision thereof that would prevent
        employees, agents, or volunteers of an organization
        designated for an accident from providing mental health
        and counseling services within a 30-day period after the
        accident. In addition, language was added permitting the
        designated director of family support services to extend
        the period not to exceed an additional 30 days if the
        director determines that the extension is necessary to
        meet the needs of the families and if state and local
        authorities are notified of the determination. </font></li>

involved in an aviation disaster.</b></font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font face="Palatino,Book Antiqua">As a result of the
        Task Force recommendations, the U.S. House of
        Representatives amended portions of the Family Assistance
        Act to extend the attorney direct solicitation provision
        from 30 days to 45 days. In addition, the House extended

        prosecuted an aviation plaintiff attorney for violation
        of the 30-day solicitation ban in the aftermath of the
        Scenic Air aviation disaster in October 1997 outside of
        Montrose, Colorado. James R. Lebovitz of the Cleveland,
        Ohio law firm of Nurenberg, Plevin, Heller, and McCarthy,
        represented himself and his firm as experts in aviation
        law and sent a letter to a family member dated one week
        after the accident in which he advocated hiring the firm
        for legal representation. Secretary Slater and Chairman
        Hall supported the Justice Department&#146;s decision to
        prosecute, citing the Task Force&#146;s endorsement of
        vigorously prosecuting violators of the solicitation
        prohibition. The prosecution resulted in a settlement
        comprised of an $8000 civil penalty and a letter from the
        attorney to Chairman Hall acknowledging a violation of
        Aviation Disaster Family Assistance Act, as well as a
        commitment to future compliance with the Act. It is DOT
        and NTSB&#146;s hope that enforcement of this legislation
        will have a deterrent effect on other attorneys,
        encouraging efforts of the plaintiff and defense bar to
        police themselves in this delicate area.</font></li>

    <li><font face="Palatino,Book Antiqua">The NTSB addressed the
        issue of protecting families from the media in the
        &quot;Federal Family Assistance Plan for Aviation
        Disasters.&quot; Specifically, other than the media
        releases by the airline on the progress of family
        notification and release of passenger names, all media
        inquiries and releases that pertain to the family support
        operation will be referred to the NTSB family support
        public affairs officer. The NTSB will advise and assist
        the local medical examiner on any media affairs in his or
        her area of responsibility. There are no restrictions on
        victims or family members meeting with the media, if they
        so desire.</font></li>

    <li><font face="Palatino,Book Antiqua">Statutory law imposes
        strict privacy constraints on the federal government
        concerning the use of cockpit voice recorders. The NTSB

<ul>
    <li><font face="Palatino,Book Antiqua">The RAND Institute of
        Civil Justice is conducting a research study for the NTSB
        focusing on the personnel and parties involved in an
        accident investigation &#150; the &quot;party
        system.&quot; The goal of the study is to assure that the
        central mission of the agency &#150; the independent
        investigation of transportation accidents and the
        issuance of recommendations to improve transportation
        safety &#150; continues to be carried out with the
        highest degree of public accountability, accuracy and
        timeliness. As the TWA 800 investigation demonstrated,
        NTSB accident investigations involve much more than an
        agency&#146;s in-house work. In conducting a major
        investigation, the NTSB leverages its resources by
        designating other organizations as &quot;parties to the
        investigation&quot; as a means of obtaining the necessary
        technical or specialized knowledge that is critical to
        the accident in question. RAND will examine the party
        system since its inception, focusing on whether the
        nature of investigations has changed over time, and, if
        so, whether the changes have had a positive or a negative
        impact on NTSB accident investigations.</font></li>
