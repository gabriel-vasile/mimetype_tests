PART 82--72 COLREGS: INTERPRETATIVE RULES--Table of Contents
 
Sec. 82.3  Pushing vessel and vessel being pushed: Composite unit.

    Rule 24(b) of the 72 COLREGS states that when a pushing vessel and a 
vessel being pushed ahead are rigidly connected in a composite unit, 
they are regarded as a power-driven vessel and must exhibit the lights 
under Rule 23. A ``composite unit'' is interpreted to be a pushing 
vessel that is rigidly connected by mechanical means to a vessel being 
pushed so they react to sea and swell as one vessel. ``Mechanical 
means'' does not include the following:
    (a) Lines.
    (b) Hawsers.
    (c) Wires.
    (d) Chains.
