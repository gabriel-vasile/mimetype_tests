Indentation
***********

`&lt;TAB&gt;'
     Indent current line "appropriately" in a mode-dependent fashion.

`&lt;LFD&gt;'
     Perform &lt;RET&gt; followed by &lt;TAB&gt; (`newline-and-indent').

`M-^'
     Merge two lines (`delete-indentation').  This would cancel out the
     effect of &lt;LFD&gt;.

`C-M-o'
     Split line at point; text on the line after point becomes a new
     line indented to the same column that it now starts in
     (`split-line').

`M-m'
     Move (forward or back) to the first non-blank character on the
     current line (`back-to-indentation').

`C-M-\'
     Indent several lines to same column (`indent-region').

`C-x &lt;TAB&gt;'
     Shift block of lines rigidly right or left (`indent-rigidly').

`M-i'
     Indent from point to the next prespecified tab stop column
     (`tab-to-tab-stop').

`M-x indent-relative'
     Indent from point to under an indentation point in the previous
     line.

   Most programming languages have some indentation convention.  For
Lisp code, lines are indented according to their nesting in
parentheses.  The same general idea is used for C code, though details
differ.

   Use the &lt;TAB&gt; command to indent a line whatever the language.  Each
major mode defines this command to perform indentation appropriate for
the particular language.  In Lisp mode, &lt;TAB&gt; aligns a line according
to its depth in parentheses.  No matter where in the line you are when
you type &lt;TAB&gt;, it aligns the line as a whole.  In C mode, &lt;TAB&gt;
implements a subtle and sophisticated indentation style that knows
about many aspects of C syntax.

   In Text mode, &lt;TAB&gt; runs the command `tab-to-tab-stop', which
indents to the next tab stop column.  You can set the tab stops with
`M-x edit-tab-stops'.
