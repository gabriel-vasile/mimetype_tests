construction standards because they incorporated by reference approximately forty\
sets of ANSI standards relating to construction, citing 44 Fed. Reg. 8577-79, 8856-57\
(1979). We note, however, that OSHA&#8217;s scaffolding standards did not arise directly\
from the ANSI standard, but rather they were adopted from the Secretary&#8217;s own\
Construction Safety Act standards as established Federal standards under section 6(a)\
of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, 29 U.S.C. &sect; 655(a).  When the\
Secretary adopted the ancestor Construction Safety Act standards, she did so\
following notice and comment rulemaking. <i>See </i>36 Fed. Reg. 1802, 1833, 1840 (Feb.\
2, 1971) (notice of proposed rulemaking); 36 Fed. Reg. 7340, 7373, 7380 (April 17,\

meaning of &#8216;tie.&#8217; &#8221; We find no basis for this claim.  Her August 1996 change to the\
definition of &#8220;brace&#8221; to replace &#8220;tie&#8221; with &#8220;a rigid connection&#8221; does not support that\
assertion.  Furthermore, the specific definition given to the term &#8220;brace&#8221; by the\

Occupational Safety and Health Administration (&#8220;OSHA&#8221;) of a scaffold collapse at
a worksite in Brookfield, Wisconsin.  The scaffold, which was fitted with a
canopy-like covering called a winter enclosure, collapsed during a period of high
wind while employees of Superior Masonry Builders, Inc. (&#8220;Superior&#8221;) were
working on it. As a result of the inspection, OSHA issued two citations to Superior
alleging willful and serious violations of scaffolding and training standards. 
Superior contested the citations, and a hearing was held before Administrative Law
Judge Sidney J. Goldstein.  In his decision, the judge affirmed the two items in the
serious citation, and he affirmed as serious the one item in the willful citation.  He
assessed a penalty of $7,000 for each violation.</span></span></p>

from the scaffold installing brick veneer on the exterior wall of a building under
construction.  The building was approximately twenty feet high with a flat roof. 
The tower scaffolds in use, made by Morgen Manufacturing Company
(&#8220;Morgen&#8221;), were comprised of sixteen towers that ran about 112 feet from north
to south along the east side of the building.  Each of the towers was made up of
three nine-foot sections placed on a two-foot base. The towers were 7-1/2 feet
apart and were joined by cross-braces or &#8220;X-braces,&#8221; horizontal braces, and
stringer braces. In addition, for the first thirteen towers, wall anchors were placed
into the wall at about 15 feet vertically and every other tower was connected to a
wall anchor with a tie. The last three towers &#8211; two of which were to be moved
around the corner of the building to another work area &#8211; were not connected to the
building, but they were still connected to the line of towers by braces. The
employees were working from a &#8220;carriage,&#8221; or steel platform covered by wooden
planks that were suspended between the towers. The platform was periodically
raised as the work progressed. </span></span></p>

designed to allow work to continue in inclement weather. It consists of a large
plastic cover draped over a frame attached to the towers. At the time of the
accident, the enclosure had just been raised level with or slightly above the
roofline at the north end of the scaffold. Apparently, a gust of wind caught the
plastic and tore the scaffolds away from the wall, causing each set of towers to pull
down the next set. All seven Superior employees on the scaffold fell and were

ANSI A10.8-1988, Section 3.  The Scaffolding, Shoring &amp; Forming Institute, Inc.
(&#8220;SSFI&#8221;) makes similar distinctions in its &#8220;Scaffold Safety Guidelines&#8221; for erection and
use of scaffolds.  Under these guidelines, the paragraph entitled &#8220;BRACING&#8221; (emphasis
in original) states:  &#8220;Each frame or panel shall be braced by horizontal bracing, cross
bracing, diagonal bracing or any combination thereof for securing vertical members
together laterally.&#8221; In contrast, a subsequent paragraph states: &#8220;TIE RUNNING
SCAFFOLD TO WALL or structure when the height exceeds four (4) times the
minimum scaffold base dimension&#8230;. Ties must prevent scaffold from tipping into or
away from the wall or structure.&#8221; (Emphasis in original).  In the SSFI&#8217;s &#8220;Guide to
Scaffolding Erection and Dismantling Procedures,&#8221; &#8220;[c]ross-bracing&#8221; is defined as a
&#8220;[s]ystem of members connecting frames or panels of scaffolding to make a tower
structure,&#8221; and &#8220;[t]ies&#8221; are defined as &#8220;[a] tension compression member used to securely

Assemble and Use&#8221; manual for tower scaffolding, also supports the plain meaning
of the cited standard and definition of the term &#8220;brace&#8221; as not including wall
connections. Unlike the citation, Morgen&#8217;s manual does not refer to the &#8220;Morgen
stiff arm&#8221; as a &#8220;brace&#8221; or the tower scaffold as needing to be &#8220;braced.&#8221;  Rather, the
manual refers to how to &#8220;tie&#8221; the scaffold to the wall with the &#8220;stiff arms,&#8221; which
is done by placing the hook at the end of the stiff arm into the hole of the stiff arm
anchor.  A U-bolt attaches the other end of the adjustable rod-like stiff arm to the
scaffold tower.  Both versions of the manual in evidence require that for scaffolds
&#8220;[o]ver 20 ft. high each tower must be tied to the wall at intervals not to exceed 18
ft. (9 feet when winter enclosure is being used).&#8221; By contrast, the text and
diagrams in both versions of the manual refer to &#8220;bracing&#8221; in terms of attaching
scaffold members to each other.  Another document in the record, Morgen&#8217;s Tower
Scaffolding Specifications, likewise does not refer to Morgen&#8217;s &#8220;stiff arms&#8221; as
braces, or attachment to the wall as bracing. The specifications require that the stiff
arm be &#8220;tied to the wall&#8221; every 9 feet when an enclosure is used and every 18 feet
when the scaffolding is not enclosed but over 20 feet high.  As in the manual,
&#8220;braces&#8221; are mentioned only in the context of connecting parts of the scaffold
together. Both the ANSI standard and the Morgen documents represent that the
term &#8220;brace&#8221; as understood by the industry does not include &#8220;tying&#8221; the scaffold to
the building. This reading is consistent with the plain meaning of the standard.<sup></sup></span></span>

Secretary&#8217;s rulemaking activities in 1986 and 1996. She points to a proposed rule
she published in 1986 that proposed adding to the definition of &#8220;brace&#8221; applicable
here &#8212; &#8220;[a] tie that holds one scaffold member in a fixed position with respect to
another member&#8221; &#8212; the language, &#8220;[b]race also means a rigid type connection
holding a scaffold to a building or structure.&#8221; 51 Fed. Reg. 42,680, 42,703
(November 25, 1986). According to the Secretary, OSHA considered this change
to the definition to be a &#8220;reword[ing] for uniformity or clarity,&#8221; not a &#8220;major
definitional change.&#8221; <i>Id.</i> at 42,682. She further claims that the publication of the
proposed rule provided construction employers with knowledge of her
interpretation of the term &#8220;brace.&#8221;  When OSHA published the final rule nearly ten
years later, one month after the citations were issued in this case, it did so with
what it described as &#8220;only minor editorial revisions&#8221; because no comments were
received.   61 Fed. Reg. 46,025  (August 30, 1996). The definition now states that
a brace &#8220;means a rigid connection that holds one scaffold member to another
member, or to a building or structure.&#8221; 29 C.F.R. &sect; 1926.450(b)(3).  </span></span></p>

used in the standard.  Despite the Secretary&#8217;s contention to the contrary, we see
nothing in this record to suggest that the proposed change was merely a
clarification of a definition that already encompassed the Secretary&#8217;s suggested
meaning of the term &#8220;brace.&#8221; Rather, the entire rulemaking activity supports the
proposition that it was conducted to substantively change the standard by

establish a section 1926.21(b)(2) violation, Secretary must show that cited
employer &#8220;failed to provide the instruction which a reasonably prudent employer
would have given in the same circumstances&#8221;).   Here, there is abundant evidence
in the record that Superior did not instruct its employees in the particular hazards
of adding a winter enclosure to the tower scaffolding.  Although both the lead
laborer who erected the scaffolding and the mason tender who assisted him had
many years of construction experience and had been given a copy of Morgen&#8217;s
manual years ago, each man testified that they received no instruction as to the
hazards associated with the use of an enclosure. In addition, three
masons/bricklayers testified that they had not received any instructions on
enclosures.  Superior&#8217;s field superintendent involved in overseeing safety at the
site acknowledged that he was not aware of any training on scaffolding enclosures
given to the three employees charged with erecting the scaffolding.  </span></span></p>
<p class="BodyText" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.250001in; text-indent: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-size: 13pt">Although Superior disputes the point, we find nothing in the record to
indicate that Superior lacked fair notice that attaching the Morgen winter enclosure
to the scaffolds presented a hazard.  Both of the documents Superior received from
Morgen and the two industry standards that Superior itself introduced at the
hearing make it clear that the use of winter enclosures presented particular hazards. 
Morgen&#8217;s &#8220;Here&#8217;s How&#8221; Manual, which Superior acknowledges it gave to many of
its employees, states that, &#8220;[b]ecause the enclosure provides additional wind
resistance, each tower must be secured to the wall every 9&#8217; vertically, starting at
the 9&#8217; elevation.&#8221;  In addition, the Tower Scaffolding Specifications Morgen
distributes to its customers provide: &#8220;Because of the tremendous force which wind
can put on any enclosure, the scaffolding must be completely braced according to
specifications and tied to the wall with a Morgen stiff arm in the top third of each 9
ft. (2.7 m) insert, starting with the first.&#8221;  Morgen also notes that the enclosure is
usually assembled and covered at ground level, thus &#8220;eliminat[ing] the dangers of
handling canvas and heaters on elevated scaffolding, where a strong gust of wind
can be disastrous.&#8221;</span></span></p>

relies, make these same points. The SSFI&#8217;s &#8220;Scaffold Safety Guidelines&#8221; provide:
&#8220;WHEN SCAFFOLDS ARE TO BE PARTIALLY OR FULLY ENCLOSED,
specific precautions must be taken to assure frequency and adequacy of ties
attaching the scaffolding to the building due to increased load conditions resulting
from effects of wind and weather.&#8221; (Emphasis in original). Similarly ANSI
A10.8&#8211;1988, section 4.30, provides: &#8220;When scaffolds are to be partially or fully
enclosed, precautions shall be taken to assure the adequacy of the number,
placement, and strength of ties attaching the scaffold to the building because of
increased load conditions resulting from the effects of wind and weather. The
scaffolding components to which the ties are attached shall be strong enough to
sustain, without failure, the additional loads imposed upon them.&#8221;<sup> </sup> </span></span></p>

scaffolding at issue.  The lead laborer testified that approximately 30 years ago he
erected some of the first Morgen tower scaffolds used in the Milwaukee area, but
he had never worked with an enclosure.  In addition, he testified that he read the
entire Morgen manual approximately 30 years ago and referred to the manual over
the years, but he did not review the manual before erecting the scaffold at issue
here.  Moreover, he received no safety training from Superior about erecting
Morgen tower scaffolding with or without an enclosure. He also stated that there
were no warnings on the enclosures themselves. When he erected these towers, he
was not aware that Morgen recommends attaching every tower to the wall, tying in
every 18 feet if a scaffold is more than 20 feet high, and tying each tower to the
wall every 9 feet when a winter enclosure is used.  He testified that tying every
other tower to the wall has been his practice all his working life. </span></span></p>

<br>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.250001in"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>The record contains an accident report from David E. powers, Chief Investigator
to Paul E. Bucher, District Attorney, Waukesha, Wisconsin.  He reviewed the reports of
the Brookfield Police Department and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration
and was also familiar with the crash scene because he responded to that location on the
day of the event.  It was apparent to him that the Respondent did not adhere to certain
standards for enclosed scaffolding.  There was negligence in erecting the scaffolding, but
not criminal in nature.  </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.250001in"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>The crew on the scaffold consisted of five masons and two laborers.  Most of
these people were experienced in their field, but using an enclosed Morgen Tower Scaffold was a first for them.  What was fine for an open scaffold was not adequate for an enclosed one.</span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 0.250001in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.250001in"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>It appeared to the investigator that wall anchors were placed in the walls at about
15 feet vertically and for every other tower.  The wall anchors were placed the day before
the accident so that the cement settled.  Seven anchors were placed, but only four were
regular Morgen Tower anchors.  The three northernmost anchors were fabricated from
wire ties not suitable for anchoring scaffolding.  At least some of the Morgen Tower anchors were set with common nails, not the cut nails specified for the anchor.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.250001in"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>On the day of the accident, stiff arms were placed between the wall anchors and
the towers.  Five of the stiff arms were placed, but the northernmost two anchors did not
have stiff arms attached.  The mason and laborer on that part of the scaffold were aware
of this situation and mentioned it to a laborer who indicated that the additional stiff arms
were buried in the snow.  The mason also conveyed his concern to the superintendent
about the windy conditions prevailing, but he did not feel the wind was a problem at that
time.  None of the masons felt they were in danger on the scaffold.  The field superintendent was not aware that standard Morgen Tower wall anchors with cut nails were being
used.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.250001in"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>The constant wind velocity did not seem to be a factor.  Wind gusts up to 32 mph
appeared after the north end of the scaffold was raised above the eave line on the north
end of the building, thus exposing a small portion of the scaffold to the wind.  Apparently, a gust of wind caught the plastic enclosed scaffold; the latter, acting as a sail, pulled
the unattached north towers away from the wall.  The scaffolding started to domino, pulling each next set of towers down.  The wire wall anchors left in the wall seem to be
where the stiff arms were not attached.  At least one wire wall anchor pulled out of the
wall.  Some Morgen Tower anchors that were set with common nails, not cut nails, also
were pulled out of the wall.  The scaffold came down, causing injury to the workers on it.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.250001in"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>According to the report the Respondent had the ultimate responsibility to properly
train its employees, especially while doing something new, such as an enclosure.  The
company relied upon experienced employees, but the latter did not take into consideration
the difference between open and enclosed scaffolding.  These employees had in their possession Morgen Tower manuals, but they  either failed to read or to understand them.</span></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 0.250001in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.250001in"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>On the day of the accident there was new snow on the ground.  The pallet with
additional stiff arms of the correct size was plowed under and looked for.  One mason
thought the scaffold was too far from the wall, and a request for additional cross bracing
was carried through.  Unfortunately, the scaffolding was raised above the north eave
where the wind gust caught it before the stiff arms were found and placed.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.250001in"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>There remained the question of the placement of less than adequate wall anchors. 
Correct anchors set with common nails by the masons appeared to have pulled out.  The
investigator did not understand the use of the wire anchors when there appeared to be
Morgen Tower anchors on the jobsite.  Reports allude to normal anchors found in a mason tool box in the rubble.  The superintendent stated that not only were correct anchors
on site, but also he carried additional ones in his truck.  He visited the building site each
day.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.250001in"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>The chief investigator concluded that negligence was present on the part of numerous individuals but did not rise to criminality.  He felt the accident was caused by a
combination of lack of specific understanding of a new system and lack of training in that
system.  Some portions of the negligence were beyond the control of the employer.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center; line-height: 0.250001in"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="text-decoration: underline">SUMMARY OF THE TESTIMONY</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.250001in"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>In general, testimony at the hearing confirmed much that was contained in the investigative report.  Thus, two laborers stated that they had no instructions or safety training with respect to Morgen Towers.  They were not aware that these towers were to be
tied every nine feet to the wall if an enclosure was utilized.  Stiff arms were not supplied
when needed.  One laborer noticed that masons were inserting ordinary nails and wire ties
instead of the recommended material in the Morgen Tower manual.  Another laborer, still
with the Respondent, heard no complaints and was not aware of a shortage of stiff arms. 
He regarded the Respondent as a safe employer.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.250001in"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Bricklayers also received no safety training or instructions regarding enclosures
during high winds.  They were concerned about the lack of stiff arms and made
complaints to management representatives.  One mason mentioned that the plastic enclosure could act as a sail in the strong wind and pull scaffolding down.  Stiff arms helped
stability, but a sufficient number was never supplied.  In addition, wire ties were substituted for Morgen flat anchors.  One mason added that he did not notice any wind problem.</span></span></p>

One was troubled by the lack of stiff arms.  He
requested more of them but was informed that none were available because they were
buried in the snow.  In his opinion stiff arms should have been placed every nine feet.</span></span></p>

not hear any employee complain about the scaffolding.  He considered the respondent to
be a safe employer.  No training was received with respect to Morgen Towers.  He was
not aware of any shortage of stiff arm braces.  Morgen Tower enclosures did not come
with installation instructions.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.250001in"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Respondent&#8217;s field supervisor shared safety responsibility with a foreman and
conducted tool box safety sessions weekly.  He recalled that one bricklayer was
concerned about the high winds but was not aware that employees were substituting
Morgen Tower anchors with wire ties and that stiff arms were missing.  Admittedly he
did not give Morgen Tower training to some employees.  However, it was not company
practice to substitute wire wall ties for Morgen wall ties.  To prevent a recurrence of the
mishap stiff arms are used in each tower; they are placed every nine feet when scaffolding
enclosures are used.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.250001in"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>A former official with the Morgen Tower organization, a twenty-year veteran and
active in its instruction work, testified that scaffolding with an enclosure requires double
the amount of stiff arms because wind loads are greater with enclosures.  There was no
competent person on site at the time of the mishap because towers were not tied off with
stiff arms.  He did not believe that employees were sufficiently trained.  Concrete nails
should have been used because they are more resistant to pullouts.  Thus, scaffolding was
not properly braced.  He added that warnings and cautions accompany the braces.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.250001in"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>The OSHA compliance officer who investigated the collapse of the scaffolding
learned that Respondent&#8217;s employees were not aware of the mandatory erection stability
specifications contained  in the Morgen Tower assembly and use instructions.  Scaffolding was not assembled according to the manufacturer&#8217;s instructions.  Stiff arms and scaffolding anchors were not properly installed with specific nails.  It appeared that other than
Morgen flat wall ties were used to anchor stiff arms to the walls.  Thus, scaffolding was
not completely braced to the walls.  On the day of the accident there were wind gusts of
up to 49 mph , and employees expressed concern to management representatives.</span></span></p>

standards in issue did not provide that an employer must follow the manfacturere&#8217;s or
ANSI standards.  He acknowledged that the Respondent gave skilled tradesmen the &#8220;How
to Do It Book.&#8221;  He also recalled that twelve of the fourteen citations issued to the Respondent took place prior to 1989.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.250001in"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>The compliance officer recommended the &#8220;willful&#8221; citation because the Respondent&#8217;s superintendent had an opportunity to check the wall ties and had information concerning the lack of proper safety equipment.  </span></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.250001in"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Respondent&#8217;s President testified that a safety policy was instituted when he took
control of the company.  This included insurance and tool box and safety talks.  He also
called upon the Mason Contractors Association for help in the safety field.  In all cases of
new hires employees were given hard hats and a copy of the company safety program. 
There were also talks on enclosing scaffolding.  <span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Respondent&#8217;s safety consultant
agreed that Morgen Tower specifications call for nine-foot vertical intervals, but there is
no statement that this was mandatory.  In the Milwaukee area towers were tied to every
third or fourth tower; but Respondent worked with every other tower, an indication that it
was not indifferent to safety.  On the day of the accident employees worked with wind
pressure which could be three times stronger than the recorded wind speed.  In his opinion, the scaffold would have collapsed no matter what measures Respondent could have
taken.</span></span></p>

winds or storms.  The scaffolding was stable and braced adequately for normal
conditions, but wind conditions were not normal at the time of the accident.  In his opinion the accident was isolated and unpredictable, but he added that the structure would be
more stable if all six towers were attached.</span></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.250001in"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>As previously noted, Citation 1, item 1 charges that respondent did not instruct
each employee in the recognition and avoidance of unsafe conditions and the regulations
applicable to his work environment to control or eliminate any hazards or other exposure
to illness or injury.  The evidence discloses that Respondent did not instruct each
employee in the hazards associated with Morgen Tower scaffolding and they were not
aware of the Morgan Tower Scaffolding Manual regarding anchorage of tower inserts
under enclosed or unenclosed conditions.  The testimony confirms the Respondent&#8217;s failure to instruct the laborers with regard to Morgen Tower scaffolding.  Indeed, they were
not aware that towers were to be tied every nine feet if an enclosure was utilized.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.250001in"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Bricklayers also testified that they received no training regarding scaffold enclosures, one of whom added that he cautioned management that the plastic enclosure could
act as a sail in the strong wind.  A mason tender employed by the respondent for 21 years
also did not receive any training with regard to Morgen Towers.  Finally, Respondent&#8217;s
field supervisor admitted that he did not give Morgen Tower training to some employees.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.250001in"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>The regulation requires the employer to instruct each employee in the recognition
and avoidance of unsafe conditions.  The Respondent failed to comply with this regulation, and therefore Citation 1, item 1, is affirmed.  </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.250001in"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>The regulation at 29 CFR &sect;1926.451(a)(3) provides that no scaffold shall be
erected, moved, dismantled, or altered except under the supervision of competent
persons.  In item 2 of Citation 1 the Complainant enumerated three instances wherein
scaffolding was not erected under the supervision of a competent person.  The record confirms that the Respondent did not follow the Morgen Tower manufacturer&#8217;s assemble and
use instructions in three instances: (1) required wall anchoring was not provided to ensure
stability under scaffold enclosure conditions;  (2) stiff arm scaffold anchors were installed
with nails which did not meet specifications in the manufacturer&#8217;s assemble and use instructions; and (3) number 6 wire veneer wall ties were substituted and used in place of
Morgen Tower scaffolding &#8220;stiff arm&#8221; anchors as specified in the manufacturer&#8217;s assemble and use instructions.  Thus, no competent person supervised the installation of
Morgen Tower equipment to conform with the manufacturer&#8217;s instructions.  Item 2 of
Citation 1 is therefore also affirmed.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.250001in"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Citation 2 (designated &#8220;Willful&#8221;) item 1 alleges that upright members of scaffolding were not securely and rigidly braced to prevent swaying and displacement.  Three examples were advanced: (1) Stiff Arm Braces and wall anchors were not provided to each
of sixteen (16) Morgen Towers at nine (9) foot vertical intervals, according to manufacturer&#8217;s specifications whenever Morgen Tower Scaffolding is enclosed; (2) Stiff Arm
Braces were not installed at two (2) northernmost wall anchor points, permitting the last
six (6) Morgen Towers to become unstable and initiating a chain reaction which toppled
all but two of the remaining ten (10) towers; and (3) Stiff Arm Braces and wall anchors
were not provided at each of the sixteen (16) Morgen Towers at eighteen (18) foot vertical intervals in accordance with manufacturer&#8217;s stability specifications.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.250001in"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>It is not disputed that stiff arm braces were not provided at nine foot intervals
when the scaffold was erected.  This resulted in a violation of the regulation at 29 CFR
&sect;1926.451(a)(15) which provides that poles, legs, or uprights of scaffolds should be
plumb and securely and rigidly braced to prevent swaying and displacement.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.250001in"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>The Complainant established that scaffolding was not securely and rigidly braced
to prevent swaying and displacement.  Even after an employee complained concerning
swaying and lack of stability, the workers were not provided with the proper protective
equipment.  The latter was buried in the snow, but no effort was made to retrieve the necessary materials.  However, the employees were furnished with substitute equipment, admittedly not intended for use with Morgen Tower scaffolding and not as effective in preventing swaying and movement between towers and walls.</span></span></p>

committed with an &#8220;intentional knowing or voluntary disregard to the requirements of the
Act or with plain indifference  to employee safety.&#8221;  It is differentiated from other types

employees.  One employee stated that some stiff arm braces were attached to the walls
and heard no complaints regarding employee safety.  He was unaware of any safety problems and considered the employer to be safety minded.  A bricklayer did not notice any
problem with regard to the wind.  A mason tender also considered the Respondent a safe
employer and was never told there was a problem with the scaffolding.  The field supervisor was unaware that employees were substituting Morgen Tower anchors with wire ties,
and it was not the company&#8217;s practice of replacing wire wall ties for Morgen wall ties. 
Immediately after the accident stiff arms were placed every nine instead of eighteen feet
when enclosures were in use.</span></span></p>

the &#8220;How To Do It&#8221; book, and twelve of fourteen previous citations were issued before
1989 when the current president took over the daily operations of the business.  Also, the
Administration&#8217;s Assistant Area Director testified that the Agency never issued a citation

safety policy and obtained assistance in this area from its insurance carrier.  It started
weekly tool box talks, sought help in the safety area from the Mason Contractors Association, and required employees to attend safety meetings with a contractors association.  In
addition it arranged for special talks regarding enclosing scaffolding.</span></span></p>

were tied every third or fourth post whereas the Respondent installed ties every other
tower.  He calculated that the wind of approximately 45 mph should be multiplied by
three when the employees were working.  In his opinion the accident would have
occurred because of the very strong wind exposure; it was an isolated unavoidable event.</span></span></p>

As previously discussed the Respondent failed to instruct some of its employees in the
proper erection of Morgen Towers, failed to have a competent person supervise the erection of the scaffolding, and failed to instruct employees how to assemble a Morgen Tower
scaffold to assure that upright members were rightly braced to prevent swaying or  displacement when enclosed.  The responsibility in connection with the three items of the
