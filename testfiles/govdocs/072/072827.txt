 In  re:  WBHM(  FM),  Birmingham,  AL  Facility  ID  No.  4240 
 File  No.  BRED–  20031201AUJ  Application  for  Renewal  of  License 


 Informal  Objection 
 Dear  Mr.  Mudd  and  Counsel: 
 This  letter  concerns  the  captioned  application  (the  “Application”)  filed  by  the  Board  of  Trustees/  University  of  Alabama  at  Birmingham  (“  BTUA”)  to  renew  the  license  of  noncommercial  educational 
 Station  WBHM(  FM),  Birmingham,  Alabama.  Also  on  file  is  an  informal  objection  (the  “Objection”)  filed  by  Edward  W.  Mudd  II  (“  Mudd”)  on  March  4,  2004.  For  the  reasons  set  forth  below,  we  deny  the 
 Objection  and  grant  the  Application.  1 
 Background.  In  his  Objection,  Mudd  states  that  “it  is  my  opinion”  that  WBHM(  FM)  “is  not  conducting  itself  in  the  best  interest  of  the  public.”  In  support  of  this  assertion,  Mudd  states  that  the 
 demographics  of  Birmingham  have  changed  during  the  last  decade  and  that  WBHM(  FM)  “is  either  unable  or  unwilling”  to  adapt  its  programming,  “which  is  heavily  oriented  towards  symphony  music,”  to  reflect 
 the  area’s  cultural  and  racial  diversity.  2  Mudd  submits  that,  “in  order  to  serve  the  public  interest,”  WBHM(  FM)  should  make  a  serious  effort  to  understand,  appreciate,  and  serve  all  segments  of  the  area's 
 residents,  an  audience  of  “great  variety  and  tastes.”  Mudd  maintains  that  WBHM(  FM)  should  diversify  the  station's  format,  instead  of  “rigidly  adhering  to  its  narrow  perspective,  programmed  around 
 symphony  music.”  Mudd  states  that,  before  the  Commission  takes  final  action  on  WBHM(  FM)  's  Application,  it  should  convene  a  public  hearing  “to  allow  the  citizens  to  be  heard  on  the  subject  of 
 WBHM(  FM);”  that  the  question  is  not  whether  WBHM(  FM)  's  license  should  be  denied,  but  rather  how  WBHM(  FM)  can  be  changed  in  such  a  way  that  the  public  is  adequately  served.  Mudd  submits  that  his 
 request  for  a  public  hearing  is  not  premised  on  “forcing  a  particular  format  upon  the  station,”  but  rather,  on  determining  whether  WBHM(  FM)  “is  indeed,  serving  the  best  interests  of  its  community's  needs,

 problems,  and  interests.  3  Additionally,  Mudd  states  that  WBHM(  FM)  ’s  on-  air  announcements  of  its  “license  expiration  and  renewal  process”  were  inadequate  because  “.  .  .  would-  be  listeners  who  do  not 
 favor  symphony  music,  simply  aren't  listening.” 
 In  its  Opposition,  BTUA  states  that  it  welcomes  input  from  members  of  the  Birmingham  community  on  its  programming  choices,  and  that  it  regularly  consults  with  a  ten-  member  advisory  board 
 of  outside  community  members  that  assists  the  station  by  providing  grassroots  feedback  about  WBHM(  FM)  's  programming  and  services.  BTUA  also  notes  that  the  Commission,  long  ago,  removed 
 program  formats  as  a  consideration  in  license  renewal  proceedings,  focusing  only  on  a  station's  overall  efforts  to  respond  to  its  community's  needs,  problems  and  interests.  4  WBHM  also  states  that  it  has 
 broadcast  all  of  the  pre-  and  post-  filing  announcements  required  by  the  Commission's  rules,  5  and  that  the  Commission  has  always  deemed  such  on-  air  announcements  as  adequate  to  apprise  the  public  of  the 
 renewal  process  in  its  service  area. 
 Discussion.  In  evaluating  an  application  for  license  renewal,  the  Commission’s  decision  is  governed  by  Section  309(  k)  of  the  Communications  Act  of  1934,  as  amended  (the  “Act”).  6  That  section 
 provides  that  we  are  to  grant  the  renewal  application  if,  upon  consideration  of  the  application  and  pleadings,  we  find  that:  (1)  the  station  has  served  the  public  interest,  convenience,  and  necessity;  (2)  there 
 have  been  no  serious  violations  of  the  Act  or  the  Commission’s  Rules;  and  (3)  there  have  been  no  other  violations  which,  taken  together,  constitute  a  pattern  of  abuse.  If,  however,  the  licensee  fails  to  meet  that 
 standard,  the  Commission  may  deny  the  application  –  after  notice  and  opportunity  for  a  hearing  under  Section  309(  e)  of  the  Act  –  or  grant  the  application  “on  terms  and  conditions  that  are  appropriate, 
 including  a  renewal  for  a  term  less  than  the  maximum  otherwise  permitted.”  7 
 Initially,  Mudd’s  format-  based  public  interest  analysis  is  misguided.  It  is  the  Commission's  general  policy  to  leave  format  issues  to  the  discretion  of  the  licensee.  8  This  is  particularly  so  with  regard 
 to  noncommercial  educational  broadcast  stations.  The  Commission  historically  “has  had  the  appropriately  limited  role  of  facilitating  the  development  of  the  public  broadcasting  system  rather  than 
 determining  the  content  of  its  programming.”  9  Licensees  have  a  duty  to  respond  to  local  needs  and  issues

 by  choosing  appropriate  programming.  They  also  have  broad  discretion  to  select,  in  good  faith,  the  issues  they  believe  to  be  of  concern  to  their  communities,  and  the  manner  in  which  to  address  those  issues.  10 
 The  Commission  may  intervene  in  circumstances  in  which  an  abuse  of  discretion  becomes  apparent.  For  example,  we  may  consider  whether  a  licensee  which  offers  almost  no  amount  of  issue-  responsive 
 programming  has  defaulted  on  its  public  interest  obligation.  11  Mudd  has  not  demonstrated  that  WBHM(  FM)  has  abused  that  discretion. 


 Finally,  Mudd  has  presented  no  information  to  demonstrate  that  BTUA  violated  the  local  public  notice  provisions  of  Section  73.3580  in  its  pre-  and  post-  filing  announcements  of  the  filing  of 
 WBHM(  FM)  ’s  renewal  application.  12  Mudd’s  assertion  that  the  licensee  failed  to  provide  adequate  notice  of  the  filing  of  its  renewal  application  because  it  broadcasts  (in  Mudd’s  opinion)  an  unpopular  format  is 
 without  merit. 
 Conclusion/  Actions.  We  find  that  Mudd’s  Objection  contains  neither  adequate  nor  specific  factual  allegations  sufficient  to  warrant  further  inquiry  regarding  renewal  of  WBHM(  FM)  ’s  license. 
 Furthermore,  pursuant  to  Section  309(  k)  of  the  Act,  we  find  neither  evidence  of  serious  violations  of  the  Act  or  the  Commission’s  Rules  nor  of  other  violations  that,  when  considered  together,  evidence  a  pattern 
 of  abuse.  Further,  we  find  that  Station  WBHM(  FM)  served  the  public  interest,  convenience,  and  necessity  during  the  subject  license  term.  Accordingly,  for  the  reasons  set  forth  above,  pursuant  to 
 Section  309(  k)  of  the  Communications  Act  of  1934,  as  amended,  and  Sections  0.61  and  0.283  of  the  Commission’s  rules,  13  the  informal  objection  filed  by  Edward  W.  Mudd  II  IS  DENIED,  and  the 
 application  (File  No.  BRED-  20031201AUJ)  of  Board  of  Trustees/  University  of  Alabama  at  Birmingham  for  renewal  of  license  for  station  WBHM(  FM),  Birmingham,  Alabama,  IS  GRANTED.
