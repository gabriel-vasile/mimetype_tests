 MEMORANDUM  OPINION  AND  ORDER 
 Adopted:  April  19,  2000;  Released:  April  28,  2000 
 By  the  Commission: 
 1.  This  order  approves  a  settlement  agreement,  filed  January  30,  1998,  by  Lindsay  Television  and  Achernar  Broadcast  ing  Company  providing  for  the  dismissal  of  Lindsay's  applicat  ion, 
 the  amendment  of  Achernar's  application  for  channel  64  to  specify  Charlottesville  Broadcasting  Corporation  (CBC)  as  the  applicant,  and  the  grant  of  Achernar's  amended  application.  On  our  own 
 motion,  pursuant  to  47  U.  S.  C.  §  316,  we  modify  CBC's  construction  permit  to  specify  operation  on  channel  19,  in  lieu  of  channel  64,  subject  to  express  condit  ions.  This  act  ion  serves  the  public  int  erest  by 
 effectuating  congressional  intent  regarding  the  reallocation  of  channel  64  for  public  safety  use  and  the  settlement  of  comparative  broadcast  proceedings  involving  applications  filed  before  July  1,  1997,  as 
 directed  by  47  U.  S.  C.  §§  337  and  309(  l)(  3),  respectively. 
 BACKGROUND 
 2.  In  1986,  the  Commission  designated  for  comparative  hearing  five  mutually  exclusive  applications  for  a  construction  permit  for  a  new  analog  television  station  on  channel  64  in 
 Charlot  t  esville,  Virginia.  1  The  only  remaining  applicants  are  Lindsay  Television  and  Achernar  Broadcasting  Company,  both  of  which  were  disqualified  because  operation  from  their  respective 
 transmitter  sites  was  deemed  to  cause  objectionable  interference  to  the  radio  astronomy  activities  of  the  National  Radio  Astronomy  Observatory  (Observatory),  located  in  Green  Bank,  West  Virginia.  2  The 
 D.  C.  Circuit  reversed  the  Commission,  concluding  that  the  Commission's  decision  rigidly  protecting  the

 Observat  ory's  int  erest  s  wit  hout  regard  t  o  t  he  compet  ing  public  int  erest  benefits  of  providing  second  local  transmission  service  and  additional  reception  service  to  the  community  of  Charlottesville  was 
 arbitrary  and  capricious.  3 
 3.  Upon  remand,  Achernar  and  Lindsay  commenced  negotiations  with  the  Observatory,  and,  after  numerous  engineering  studies  and  intensive  investigation  of  several  possible  transmitter  sites, 
 developed  an  engineering  proposal  acceptable  to  the  Observatory  that  accommodates  Charlottesville's  need  for  a  second  commercial  television  station  and  protects  certain  of  the  Observatory's  astronomy 
 operations  from  broadcast  interference.  4  Achernar  and  Lindsay  have  also  reached  a  settlement  agreement  in  the  comparative  proceeding  providing  for  their  merger  into  a  single  applicant, 
 Charlot  t  esville  Broadcast  ing  Corporat  ion  (CBC),  and  the  grant  of  a  construction  permit  to  that  applicant.  The  settlement  agreement  initially  requested  a  construction  permit  for  channel  64  but  was 
 later  supplemented  with  an  alternative  request  for  channel  19.  As  set  forth  in  greater  detail  below,  the  Mass  Media  Bureau  opposes  the  authorization  of  a  new  analog  television  station  on  channel  64,  but 
 supports  the  acceptance  of  the  engineering  amendments  and  the  grant  of  a  construction  permit  for  a  new  NTSC  television  station  on  channel  19. 


 4.  On  August  5,  1997,  President  Clinton  signed  the  Balanced  Budget  Act  of  1997.  Two  provisions  of  that  legislation  are  pertinent  to  the  matters  before  us.  First,  to  facilitate  the  resolution  of 
 certain  pending  comparative  broadcast  cases  that  could  otherwise  be  resolved  through  auctions,  Section  3002(  a)(  3),  codified  as  47  U.  S.  C.  §  309(  l),  provides  that,  for  settlement  agreements  executed 
 within  180  days  after  enactment  (that  is,  by  February  1,  1998),  "the  Commission  shall  .  .  .  (3)  waive  any  provision  of  its  regulations  necessary  to  permit  such  persons  [who  filed  applications  for  full  service 
 commercial  radio  or  television  stations  before  July  1,  1997]  to  enter  into  an  agreement  to  procure  the  removal  of  a  conflict  between  their  applications."  Second,  section  3004,  codified  as  47  U.  S.  C.  §  337, 
 directs  the  Commission  to  reallocate  24  megahertz  of  spectrum  in  the  746-  806  MHz  band  for  public  safety  services  and  the  remaining  36  megahertz  for  commercial  use.  The  746-  806  MHz  band  currently 
 comprises  television  channels  60-  69. 
 5.  Pursuant  to  Section  337,  the  Commission  reallocated  television  channels  63,  64,  68, 


 3  Achernar  Broadcasting  Company  v.  FCC,  62  F.  3d  1441  (D.  C.  Cir.  1995). 
 4  The  engineering  proposal  involves  operation  from  the  Carter's  Mountain  antenna  farm  with  an  antenna 
 designed  with  a  directionalized  null  to  minimize  transmission  in  the  direction  of  the  Observatory's  Green  Bank 
 facility.  The  applicants  have  submitted  a  written  agreement  formalizing  their  understanding  with  the  Observatory. 
 See  Supplement  to  Joint  Petition  for  Approval  of  Settlement  Agreement,  filed  June  24,  1998.  To  implement  the 
 agreement  resolving  the  interference  issues  with  the  Observatory,  Lindsay  and  Achernar  filed  a  series  of  pleadings 
 in  late  1997  seeking  the  short-  spacing  waivers  and  translator  service  necessary  to  correct  the  loss  of  channel  64 
 service  to  areas  in  the  station's  normally  anticipated  coverage  area.  Specifically,  Achernar  filed  a  Petition  for 
 Leave  to  Amend  and  for  Waiver  of  Short-  Spacing  Rule  on  November  19,  1997,  and  Lindsay  filed  a  Petition  for 
 Leave  to  Amend  and  a  Supplement  thereto  on  September  19,  and  22,  1997,  a  Petition  for  Waiver  of  Short-  Spacing 
 Rules  on  November  5,  1997;  and  a  Petition  for  Acceptance  of  Television  Translator  Applications  and  Request  for 
 Waivers  on  December  8,  1997.  Lindsay's  pleadings  as  well  as  Achernar's  waiver  request  pertain  to  the  original 
 proposal  for  channel  64.  In  view  of  our  action  herein  approving  the  applicants'  settlement  agreement  and 
 modifying  on  our  own  motion  the  construction  permit  to  specify  operation  on  channel  19  in  lieu  of  channel  64, 
 these  pleadings  may  be  dismissed.

 and  69  to  the  fixed  and  mobile  services,  and  designated  this  spectrum  exclusively  for  public  safety  use.  5  In  doing  so,  the  Commission  noted  that  these  channels  would  continue  to  be  used  to  provide  analog 
 and  digital  TV  broadcasting  during  the  DTV  transition  period,  but  that  it  would  not  authorize  additional  new  analog  full-  service  stations  on  channels  60-  69.  6  Inst  ead  of  summarily  dismissing  pending 
 applications  for  these  channels,  the  Commission  said  that  at  a  latter  date  it  would  provide  such  applicants  an  opportunity  to  amend,  if  possible,  to  a  channel  below  60.  7  It  indicated  further  that  all 
 conditions,  including  the  freeze  on  applications  in  large  metropolitan  areas,  pertaining  to  the  pending  applications  and  rulemaking  petitions  would  continue  to  apply,  and  that  freeze  waiver  requests  would 
 be  considered  on  a  case-  by-  case  basis.  On  reconsideration,  the  Commission  affirmed  its  decision  not  to  authorize  new  analog  television  stations  on  channels  60-  69,  but  indicated  that  the  denial  of  Lindsay's 
 petition  for  reconsideration  was  without  prejudice  to  its  pending  waiver  request  for  permission  to  operat  e  a  new  analog  television  st  at  ion  on  channel  64  in  Charlot  t  esville.  By  Public  Not  ice,  ot  her 
 pending  applicants/  petitioners  for  the  reallocated  channels  have  been  afforded  a  limited  opportunity  to  amend  to  a  channel  below  channel  60.  8 


 6.  Also  pertinent  to  consideration  of  the  pending  settlement  agreement  is  the  enactment  of 
 the  Community  Broadcasters  Protection  Act  of  1999  (CPBA).  Signed  into  law  on  November  29, 
 1999,  the  legislation  authorizes  low  power  television  licensees  to  convert  the  secondary  status  of  their 
 stations  into  new  Class  A  status,  provided  certain  statutorily-  prescribed  conditions  are  met.  On 
 December  13,  1999  the  Commission  notified  eligible  licensees  of  the  requirements  for  a  Class  A 
 designation,  9  and  on  March  28,  2000  it  adopted  rules  implementing  the  statute.  10  As  reflected  below, 
 t  he  modificat  ion  of  pet  it  ioners’  const  ruct  ion  permit  to  specify  operat  ion  on  channel  19  will  result  in  the 
 displacement  of  Station  W19BB,  a  translator  station  operating  on  channel  19  in  Charlottesville.  The 
 licensee  of  that  station,  Shenandoah  Valley  Educational  Television,  opposes  petitioners’  settlement 
 agreement  on  that  basis.  And,  as  authorized  by  Section  (c)(  2)(  1)(  B)  of  the  CBPA,  codified  as  47 
 U.  S.  C.  §  336(  f)(  1)(  B),  Shenandoah  has  timely  submitted  a  certification  of  eligibility  for  Class  A  Low 
 Power  Television  Station  Status  for  the  channel  19  translator.  For  the  reasons  set  forth  below, 
 however,  Shenandoah’s  timely  submission  of  the  certification  is  not  an  impediment  to  approval  of  a 
 settlement  agreement  that  was  pending  on  November  29,  1999.

 THE  SETTLEMENT  AGREEMENT 
 7.  In  addition  to  resolving  the  interference  issues  with  the  Observatory,  Achernar  and  Lindsay  have  reached  a  settlement  agreement  of  the  comparative  proceeding.  Entered  into  within  180 
 days  of  the  enactment  of  the  Balanced  Budget  Act  of  1997,  and  thus  subject  to  the  mandatory  waiver  provision  set  forth  in  Section  309(  l)(  3),  the  settlement  agreement  provides  for  a  50/  50  merger  of 
 Achernar  and  Lindsay  int  o  a  new  corporat  e  ent  it  y,  Charlot  t  esville  Broadcast  ing  Company,  t  he  dismissal  of  Lindsay's  application,  the  amendment  of  Achernar's  application  to  substitute  the  merged 
 entity  as  the  applicant,  and  the  grant  of  the  amended  application.  The  settlement  agreement  is  contingent  on  the  grant  of  a  construction  permit  for  channel  64  or  such  other  channel  as  the 
 Commission  may  select  .  Wit  h  regard  to  channel  64,  the  Joint  Pet  it  ioners  submit  that  ,  despit  e  its  reallocation  for  public  safety  use,  the  grant  of  a  construction  permit  for  that  channel  is  consistent  with 
 Section  337  of  the  Act  requiring  only  that  all  television  stations  must  vacate  the  portion  of  the  spectrum  allocated  for  public  safety  use  by  the  end  of  the  digital  television  transition  period.  Joint 
 Petitioners  urge  that  this  is  an  appropriate  case  for  waiving  the  Commission's  policy  determination  not  to  grant  pending  applications  for  TV  channels  60-  69.  They  stress  that  this  is  one  of  the  oldest 
 unresolved  comparat  ive  cases,  that  waiver  will  bring  long-  await  ed,  much  needed  commercial  television  service  t  o  Charlot  t  esville,  and  t  hat  ,  in  cont  rast  to  any  ot  her  pending  applicat  ion  for  a  reallocat  ed  analog 
 television  channel,  the  pending  applications  for  channel  64  (Charlottesville)  have  been  the  subject  of  evidentiary  hearings  before  an  Administrative  Law  Judge,  review  by  the  Commission,  and  judicial 
 review.  If  awarded  a  construction  permit  for  channel  64,  Joint  Petitioners  promise  to  afford  the  requisite  interference  protection  for  public  safety  service  licensees  and  to  cease  broadcast  operations  on 
 channel  64  by  the  end  of  the  digital  transition  period,  as  is  required  by  Section  337. 
 8.  The  Bureau  opposes  the  grant  of  a  construction  permit  for  a  new  analog  television  st  at  ion  on  channel  64  in  Charlot  t  esville  on  the  ground  that  it  would  be  cont  rary  t  o  t  he  Commission's 
 determination  in  ET  Docket  No.  97-  157  not  to  authorize  any  new  television  stations  on  channels  60-  69.  The  grant  of  a  construction  permit  for  NTSC  channel  64  in  Charlottesville  is  also  opposed  by  the 
 Association  of  Public-  Safety  Communications  Officials-  International,  Inc.  (APCO).  It  asserts  that  petitioners'  use  of  channel  64  would  bar  public  safety  use  of  that  channel  throughout  much  of  Virginia 
 and  the  Washington,  D.  C.  metropolitan  area,  as  well  as  the  development  of  a  statewide  public  service  network  and  the  use  of  paired  frequencies  on  channel  69.  In  comments  filed  July  28,  1999,  both  the 
 Bureau  and  APCO  have  confirmed  their  continuing  opposition  to  authorizing  a  new  analog  station  on  channel  64.  11 


 11  These  comments  were  filed  in  response  to  Achernar  Broadcasting  Company,  FCC  99I-  15  (OGC  June  28, 
 1999),  requesting  further  comments  on  APCO's  contention  that  operation  from  channel  64  would  adversely  impact 
 on  public  safety.  Comments  were  also  sought  on  the  applicants'  alternate  request,  discussed  in  greater  detail  below, 
 to  operate  on  channel  19  in  lieu  of  channel  64.  In  particular,  the  Bureau  was  asked  to  comment  on  that  proposal 
 now  that  APCO  has  withdrawn  its  original  opposition  to  channel  19.  Comments  were  also  filed  on  July  28,  1999, 
 by  Shenandoah  Valley  Educational  Television  and  by  Viacom,  Inc.  Responsive  Comments  were  filed  on  August 
 12,  1999  by  Lindsay  and  Achernar,  and  Reply  Comments  were  filed  on  August  19,  1999  by  Shenandoah.  And,  on 
 December  2,  1999,  Shenandoah  filed  a  Supplement  to  Comments  In  Opposition  and  a  Motion  to  Enter  Citizen 
 Comments  Into  the  Record.  Lindsay  and  Achernar  filed  a  Consolidated  Opposition  on  December  16,  1999.

 9.  Alternatively,  Joint  Petitioners  filed  a  Supplement  to  Joint  Petition  for  Approval  of  Settlement  Agreement  on  June  24,  1998  proposing  to  operate  on  channel  19  instead  of  channel  64  at 
 the  same  transmitter  location  and  with  essentially  the  same  technical  proposal.  Attached  thereto  is  an  agreement  reflecting  that  the  Observatory  does  not  object  to  the  substitution  of  channel  19.  12  In 
 support  of  channel  19,  Joint  Petitioners  assert  that  the  proposed  substitution  complies  with  both  the  analog  table  of  television  allotments  and  the  digital  table  of  television  allotments,  that  the  amendment  is 
 supported  by  good  cause,  as  required  by  Section  73.3522(  b)  of  the  rules,  47  C.  F.  R.  §  73.3522(  b),  and  that  the  Commission  has  authority  to  order  the  channel  change  on  its  own  motion.  13  They  accordingly 
 ask  the  Commission  to  issue  an  Order  to  Show  Cause  why  the  channel  petitioners  applied  for  should  not  be  modified  to  specify  channel  19.  14  Without  indicating  whether  they  would  prefer  channel  19  or 
 channel  64,  pet  it  ioners  st  at  e  that  they  will  relinquish  all  claims  to  channel  64  if  they  are  awarded  a  construction  permit  for  channel  19. 


 10.  The  Bureau  initially  opposed  the  amendment  based  on  adjacent  channel  interference  to  land  mobile  operat  ions  on  channel  18  in  Washingt  on,  D.  C.,  as  did  APCO.  15  In  response  to  a 
 subsequent  proposal  to  install  filter  equipment  designed  to  protect  these  land  mobile  operations,  16  APCO  has  st  at  ed  that  it  will  wit  hdraw  its  object  ions  to  channel  19,  provided  Achernar  and  Lindsay 
 abandon  their  bid  for  channel  64  and  their  license  for  channel  19  contains  certain  express  conditions.  17  The  Bureau  has  now  agreed  that  these  conditions  are  adequate  to  protect  land  mobile  service  on 
 channel  18,  and  has  withdrawn  its  objections  to  channel  19,  provided  further  that  a  minus  offset  is  included  in  order  to  prot  ect  NTSC  channel  19  allot  ment  s  in  Jacksonville,  Nort  h  Carolina,  Kingsport  , 
 Tennessee,  and  Jeanette,  Pennsylvania.  18  The  Joint  Pet  it  ioners  have  indicat  ed  their  willingness  to  accept  the  minus  offset,  as  well  as  the  express  conditions  requested  by  APCO,  and  have  reiterated  their 
 intent  to  relinquish  all  claims  to  channel  64  if  awarded  a  construction  permit  to  operate  a  new  analog  television  station  on  channel  19.

 15  The  proposed  transmitter  site  is  less  than  102  miles  from  the  land  mobile  allocation  for  the  Washington,  D.  C. 
 urbanized  area.  See  Land  Mobile  Use  of  TV  Channels,  23  FCC  2d  325,  343-  44  (1970),  providing  that,  in  order  to 
 protect  the  assignment  of  channels  17  and  18  for  land  mobile  use  in  the  Washington,  D.  C.  urbanized  area,  the 
 Commission  will  not  accept  applications  for  construction  permits  for  adjacent  analog  channels  16  and  19,  if  such 
 are  within  140  miles  of  the  specified  geographic  center  of  the  Washington,  D.  C.  urbanized  area.

 17  See  Supplemental  Response  of  APCO  to  Consolidated  Reply  to  Oppositions,  filed  December  4,  1998, 
 requesting  the  following  conditions:  (1)  The  station  must  install  and  maintain  a  filter  on  its  channel  19  transmitter 
 providing  75-  80  dB  attenuation  in  the  494-  500  MHz  band  (channel  18);  and  (2)  The  station  must  accept 
 interference  from  current  or  future  494-  500  MHz  land  mobile  facilities  operating  from  base  stations  located  within 
 50  miles  of  Washington,  D.  C.,  and  mobile  units  operating  within  30  miles  of  their  associated  base  station.

 11.  Nonetheless,  the  award  of  a  construction  permit  for  channel  19  is  separately  opposed  by  Shenandoah  Valley  Educational  Television  (Shenandoah),  the  licensee  of  Station  W19BB,  a 
 t  ranslat  or  st  at  ion  operat  ing  on  channel  19  in  Charlot  t  esville  that  would  be  displaced  if  a  full-  power  commercial  st  at  ion  is  licensed  on  that  channel;  19  and  by  Viacom,  Inc.  (Viacom),  the  ultimate  parent  of 
 the  licensee  of  WGNT  in  Portsmouth,  Virginia,  which  has  been  allocated  DTV  channel  19.  According  to  the  Bureau,  neither  objection  has  merit.  Citing  Commission  rules  requiring  that  a  displaced  translator 
 licensee  must  modify  its  channel  at  its  own  expense  or  ot  herwise  eliminat  e  any  int  erference  t  o  t  he  operation  of  a  full  power  television  station,  the  Bureau  rejects  Shenandoah's  objection.  20  Petitioners 
 likewise  emphasize  that  Station  W19BB  is  neither  a  full  service  station  nor  one  that  originates  local  t  elevision  programming;  t  hey  also  submit  program  schedules  purport  edly  reflect  ing  subst  ant  ial 
 duplication  of  noncommercial  programming  offered  by  another  station,  whose  r  eception  in  Charlottesville  would  be  unaffected  by  the  proposed  channel  switch.  21  As  to  Viacom's  concern  that 
 assigning  a  new  NTSC  allotment  on  channel  19  would  foreclose  future  upgrades  of  WGNT-  DT  (Channel  19-  Portsmouth),  the  Bureau  indicates  that  Viacom  has  no  inherent  right  to  expand  that 
 station's  coverage  and  that  its  engineering  staff  has  confirmed  that  the  presence  of  a  new  NTSC  station  on  channel  19  at  Charlot  t  esville  would  not  det  riment  ally  affect  the  DTV  channel  allot  ment  at 
 Portsmouth. 
 12.  Shenandoah  and  Viacom  also  oppose  the  proposed  substitution  of  channel  19  on  procedural  grounds.  The  amendment  to  channel  19,  according  to  Shenandoah,  is  not  supported  by 
 good  cause,  as  required  by  Section  73.3522(  b)  of  the  rules,  inasmuch  as  its  acceptance  would  require  the  addition  of  new  parties  and  the  enlargement  of  the  issues.  Because  channel  19  is  not  presently 
 allocat  ed  t  o  Charlot  t  esville,  Shenandoah  assert  s  that  the  request  ed  channel  swit  ch  would  require  the  initiation  of  both  a  rulemaking  proceeding  to  amend  the  analog  Table  of  Allotments  and  a  competitive 
 licensing  proceeding  to  award  the  permit  for  that  channel.  And,  in  response  to  the  November  22  1999  Public  Not  ice  announcing  a  filing  opport  unit  y  for  cert  ain  analog  television  applicat  ions,  Shenandoah 
 has  tendered  for  filing  an  application  for  a  construction  permit  for  a  new  noncommercial  educational  station  on  channel  19.  Viacom  urges  that  Petitioner's  procedurally  deficient  request  to  substitute 
 channel  19  should  be  dismissed,  because  it  impermissibly  short-  circuits  procedures  that  provide  opportunities  for  public  notice  of,  and  participation  in,  such  proceedings,  as  well  as  rules  prohibiting  the 
 filing  of  major  amendment  s.  In  response,  Joint  Pet  it  ioners  claim  that  ,  given  the  applicant  s'  concurrence,  the  Commission  has  authority  to  change  the  channel  without  further  proceedings.  22  Citing  the  absence 
 of  any  opposition  to  channel  19  from  any  entity  with  a  legitimate  interest  in  this  matter,  their  agreement 
 19  We  note  the  letter,  dated  March  2,  2000,  from  Thomas  J.  Bliley,  Jr.,  Chairman,  Committee  on  Commerce, 
 U.  S.  House  of  Representatives,  to  William  E.  Kennard,  Chairman,  Federal  Communications  Commission, 
 concerning  this  matter  and  stating  that  Shenandoah  “has  for  over  thirty  years  provided  valuable  noncommercial 
 educational  programming  to  the  people  of  Virginia  and  West  Virginia.“

 to  take  the  protective  measures  requested  by  the  Bureau  and  APCO,  and  the  Bureau's  support  of  the 
 proposed  substitution,  petitioners  request  the  immediate  grant  of  a  construction  permit  for  channel  19.  23  The  petitioners  also  request  that  the  Commission  dismiss  Shenandoah’s  tendered  application  for 


 channel  19  and  reject  the  arguments  contained  in  a  variety  of  allegedly  unauthorized  pleadings  filed  by  Shenandoah.  24 


 DISCUSSION 
 13.  For  the  reasons  stated  below,  we  find  that  the  public  interest  would  be  best  served  in  light  of  the  circumstances  of  this  case  by  authorizing  the  operation  of  a  new  analog  television  station  on 
 channel  19  in  Charlot  t  esville,  subject  to  the  express  condit  ions  request  ed  by  the  Bureau  and  by  APCO.  We  therefore  approve  the  settlement  agreement  providing  for  the  dismissal  of  Lindsay's  application, 
 the  amendment  of  Achernar's  application  to  specify  CBC  as  the  applicant,  and  the  grant  of  CBC's  application  for  channel  64.  On  our  own  motion  we  modify  CBC's  construction  permit  to  specify 
 operation  on  channel  19  in  lieu  of  channel  64,  and  dismiss  Shenandoah’s  tendered  application  for  a  const  ruct  ion  permit  for  a  new  noncommercial  educat  ional  st  at  ion  on  channel  19.  This  act  ion  is 
 appropriate  to  effectuate  congressional  intent  regarding  the  reallocation  of  channel  64  for  public  safety  use  and  to  facilit  at  e  the  resolut  ion  of  one  of  the  oldest  comparat  ive  licensing  cases  pursuant  t  o  a 
 settlement  agreement  that  is  subject  to  the  special  waiver  provision  set  forth  in  Section  309(  l)(  3).  And,  in  the  circumstances  of  this  case,  we  find  for  good  cause  that  a  notice  and  comment  rulemaking  is  not 
 required  to  add  analog  channel  19,  Charlot  t  esville  to  the  Table  of  Allot  ment  s. 
 14.  In  approving  the  settlement  agreement  and  awarding  a  construction  permit  for  channel  64,  we  agree  with  CBC  that  Section  337  of  the  Act  does  not  preclude  authorization  of  a  new  analog 
 t  elevision  st  at  ion  on  channel  64  in  Charlot  t  esville,  Virginia.  By  its  express  terms,  Sect  ion  337  provides  only  that  television  broadcast  operations  on  channels  60-  69  must  cease  at  the  end  of  the  digital 
 television  transition  period,  currently  scheduled  to  end  by  December  31,  2006.  25  Not  hing  in  the  accompanying  legislative  history,  moreover,  precludes  the  authorization  of  new  television  service  on 
 channels  60-  69.  Therefore,  the  authorization  of  a  new  analog  television  station  on  channel  64  in  Charlot  t  esville  during  the  transit  ion  period  is  not  st  at  ut  orily  barred.  Consist  ent  wit  h  clear  congressional 
 intent  that  these  channels  be  reallocated  for  public  safety  use  as  quickly  as  possible,  however,  we  made  a  policy  det  erminat  ion  not  t  o  aut  horize  any  addit  ional  new  analog  st  at  ions  on  them  so  as  to  maximize 
 t  he  ut  ilit  y  of  the  746-  806  MHz  band  for  public  safety  use.  26  We  nevertheless  specifically  recognized

 24  See  Consolidated  Opposition  to  Unlawful  Filings  by  W19BB,  filed  December  16,  1999,  at  8.  Joint  Petitioners 
 refer  specifically  to  the  following  pleadings  filed  by  Shenandoah:  (1)  Supplement  to  Shenandoah  Valley 
 Educational  Television  Corporation’s  Comments,  filed  on  December  2,  1999;  (2)  a  letter  purporting  to  tender  an 
 FCC  Form  340;  and  (3)  a  Motion  to  Enter  Citizen  Comments  into  the  Record,  filed  on  December  2,  1999. 


 25  Section  337(  e)(  1)  specifies  that  "[  a]  ny  person  who  holds  a  television  broadcast  license  to  operate  between  746 
 and  806  megahertz  [channels  60-  69]  may  not  operate  at  that  frequency  after  the  date  on  which  the  digital 
 television  service  transition  period  terminates,  as  determined  by  the  Commission."  Section  309(  j)(  14)(  A)  provides 
 that  "[  a]  television  broadcast  license  that  authorizes  analog  television  service  may  not  be  renewed  to  authorize  such 
 service  for  a  period  that  extends  beyond  December  31,  2006."

 the  unusual  facts  presented  by  this  particular  adjudicatory  proceeding.  27 
 15.  The  award  of  a  construction  permit  for  a  new  analog  station  on  channel  64  would,  in  our  view,  serve  the  public  interest  in  light  of  the  unique  circumstances  of  this  case.  28  The  equities 
 favoring  these  applicants  are  extraordinary.  Consistent  with  Section  309(  l)(  3)  providing  for  the  waiver  of  regulatory  provisions  to  facilitate  settlements  filed  before  February  1,  1998,  29  this  would  resolve  one 
 of  the  oldest  comparative  proceedings  involving  competing  broadcast  applications  filed  before  July  1,  1997.  Waiving  the  reallocation  of  channel  64  will  also  further  the  public  interest  by  expediting  long 
 awaited,  much  needed  television  service  to  Charlottesville.  30  Moreover,  as  discussed  below,  we  intend  to  modify  the  authorization  to  specify  operation  on  Channel  19,  thereby  avoiding  any  possible  impact 
 on  public  safety  use. 
 16.  The  proposed  settlement  agreement  complies  fully  with  47  U.  S.  C.  §  311(  c)  of  the  Communications  Act  and  47  C.  F.  R.  §  73.3525(  a)  of  the  Commission's  Rules  governing  set  t  lement 
 agreements  among  mutually  exclusive  broadcast  applications.  Attached  to  the  applicants'  Joint  Petition  are  declarations  from  each  party  to  the  agreement  stating  that  their  respective  applications  were  not 
 filed  for  the  purpose  of  reaching  a  settlement  agreement.  They  further  state  that  approval  of  the  agreement  will  serve  the  public  int  erest  by  expedit  ing  the  init  iat  ion  of  new  t  elevision  service  t  o  t  he 
 community  and  by  conserving  the  resources  of  the  private  litigants  and  of  the  Commission.  Additionally,  the  attached  Shareholders'  Agreement  reflects  a  bona  fide  merger  of  the  interests  of 
 Achernar  and  Lindsay  that  contemplates  a  genuine  sharing  of  risks  and  rewards,  as  is  required  by  Section  73.3525(  a)(  3)  of  the  Rules.  And,  in  any  event,  a  waiver  of  that  provision  would  be  consistent 
 with  Section  309(  l)(  3),  since  the  agreement  was  executed  before  February  1,  1999.  See  Gonzales  Broadcasting,  Inc.,  12  FCC  Rcd  12253,  12255-  56  ¶  10  (1997).  We  also  grant  the  applicants'  petition 
 for  leave  to  amend  that  is  included  in  the  Joint  Petition,  and  accept  the  attached  amendment  substituting  CBC  as  the  applicant.  The  amendment  is  supported  by  good  cause  in  that  it  facilit  at  es

 28  Given  these  conclusions  regarding  channel  64,  it  is  unnecessary  to  entertain  the  alternative  request  to  amend 
 Achernar's  application  to  specify  operation  on  NTSC  channel  19,  and  it  may  be  dismissed.  For  the  reasons  stated 
 below,  however,  we  will  on  our  motion  modify  the  construction  permit  to  specify  operation  on  channel  19.

 Communications,  Inc.  v.  FCC,  168  F.  3d  1354  (D.  C.  Cir.  1999),  concluding  that,  notwithstanding  our  general 
 public  interest  determination  in  the  digital  television  proceeding  to  eliminate  vacant  NTSC  allotments,  it  was 
 equitable  in  the  context  of  a  longstanding  comparative  proceeding  to  take  action  to  ensure  that  the  community  is 
 not  deprived  of  long-  awaited  television  service.  There,  we  instructed  the  Bureau  to  take  appropriate  steps  to  permit 
 the  filing  of  applications  for  that  channel.  The  circumstances  warranting  relief  are  equally  compelling  here,  given 
 the  special  interference  issues  relating  to  the  Observatory's  use  of  channel  64  for  astronomy  activities,  and  the  D.  C. 
 Circuit's  explicit  recognition  of  the  competing  public  interest  significance  of  Charlottesville's  need  for  a  second 
 commercial  television  service.

 resolution  of  this  comparative  proceeding. 
 MODIFICATION  OF  CONSTRUCTION  PERMIT 
 17.  Pursuant  to  our  authority  under  Section  316(  a)  of  the  Communications  Act,  47  U.  S.  C.  §  316(  a),  and  Section  1.87  of  the  Commission's  rules,  47  C.  F.  R.  §  1.87,  to  modify  any  construction 
 permit  if  we  det  ermine  t  hat  such  act  ion  will  promot  e  the  public  int  erest  ,  we  will  on  our  own  mot  ion  modify  CBC's  construction  permit  to  specify  operation  on  channel  19,  in  lieu  of  channel  64. 
 Modification  of  the  construction  permit  will  serve  the  public  interest  by  furthering  congressional  intent  regarding  broadcast  station  operations  on  channels  60-  69,  31  and  ensuring  the  station's  operations  have 
 no  possible  impact  on  public  safety  use. 
 18.  We  agree  with  the  joint  petitioners  that,  given  the  circumstances  of  this  case,  the  modification  of  CBC's  permit  does  not  require  the  initiation  of  further  proceedings.  Where  the 
 Commission  proposes  to  modify  a  construction  permit,  the  holder  of  that  permit,  as  well  as  any  permittee  or  licensee  who  believes  its  authorization  would  be  modified  by  the  proposed  action,  is 
 entitled  to  protest.  Further  proceedings  are  not  necessary  under  Section  316(  a)(  1)  according  CBC  the  right  to  protest,  inasmuch  as  Achernar  and  Lindsay  sought  to  amend  to  channel  19  in  connection  with 
 their  settlement  agreement.  CBC  has  therefore  acquiesced  in  the  modification,  making  further  proceedings  unnecessary.  A  similar  sit  uat  ion  arose  in  Channel  16  of  Rhode  Island,  Inc.,  31  FCC  2d 
 574  (1971),  where  the  channel  originally  applied  for  was  reallocated  for  land  mobile  use.  Deletion  of  the  original  channel  was  vacated  by  the  court,  and  the  Commission  issued  an  Order  to  Show  Cause 
 why  the  construction  permit  should  not  be  modified  to  specify  an  alternate  channel.  Based  upon  the  permittee's  subsequent  acquiescence,  however,  the  Commission  modified  the  construction  permit 
 without  further  proceedings.  We  recognize  that,  as  Shenandoah  notes,  the  substituted  channel  in  that  case  had  been  allotted  to  the  community  in  question.  Our  authority  to  assign  frequencies,  however,  is 
 statutory,  see  47  U.  S.  C.  §  303(  c),  32  and  nothing  in  Section  316  suggests  that  our  authority  to  modify  a  const  ruct  ion  permit,  where  t  he  public  int  erest  is  thereby  served,  is  limited  to  previously  allot  t  ed 
 channels.  Nor  have  Viacom  and  Shenandoah  cited  any  precedent  for  such  a  restriction,  or  otherwise  challenged  our  authority  under  Sections  303(  c)  and  316(  a)  to  modify  on  our  own  motion  the 
 construction  permit  to  specify  operation  on  NTSC  channel  19  in  lieu  of  channel  64.  And,  although  modification  of  CBC's  permit  requires  an  amendment  to  the  Analog  Table  of  Allotments,  for  the 
 reasons  set  forth  in  paragraph  25  below,  we  find  for  good  cause  that  a  notice  and  comment  rulemaking  is  not  required  to  add  channel  19,  Charlot  t  esville  to  the  Table  of  Allot  ment  s. 


 19.  Further  proceedings  are  also  unnecessary  under  Section  316(  a)(  2)  according  protest  rights  to  licensees  who  believe  their  licenses  would  be  modified  by  the  proposed  modification.  As  noted 
 above,  we  sought  comment  on  the  proposal  to  use  channel  19,  and  two  existing  licensees,  Shenandoah

 32  Section  303  provides  that  "[  e]  xcept  as  otherwise  provided  in  this  Act,  the  Commission  from  time  to  time,  as

 and  the  time  during  which  it  may  operate."

 Federal  Communications  Commission  FCC  00-  149

 and  Viacom,  challenged  the  petitioners'  proposed  use  of  that  channel.  To  the  extent  that  they  rely  upon  potential  interference  with  their  licensed  stations,  the  channel  switch  would  not  effect  a  modification  of 
 either  license  within  the  meaning  of  Section  316(  a)(  2).  As  the  licensee  of  the  channel  19  translator  in  Charlot  t  esville,  Shenandoah's  aut  horizat  ion  is,  pursuant  to  the  Commission's  allocat  ion  rules,  subject  to 
 displacement  by  a  full-  power  station  licensed  to  operate  on  that  channel  regardless  of  the  quality  of  the  non-  commercial  programming  present  ed  on  t  he  translat  or  st  at  ion.  It  s  secondary  st  at  us  is  not  alt  ered, 
 moreover,  by  our  prior  action  permitting  full-  power  Station  WVPT-  TV  (channel  51,  Staunton),  also  licensed  to  Shenandoah,  to  move  to  DTV  channel  11  so  as  to  protect  the  continued  use  of  the  channel 
 19  translat  or  st  at  ion  in  Charlot  t  esville.  33  At  most,  that  action  establishes  the  propriety  of  preserving  the  translator  service  to  the  extent  possible  in  formulating  the  digital  table  of  allotments;  it  does  not, 
 however,  give  Shenandoah  any  rights  vis-  a-  vis  an  applicant  for  a  full  power  television  station  on  channel  19.  Given  the  secondary  status  accorded  to  the  channel  19  translator  under  our  allocation 
 rules,  modifying  CBC's  construction  permit  to  specify  operation  on  channel  19  would  not  effect  a  modification  of  Shenandoah's  license  for  that  secondary  service  within  the  meaning  of  Section 
 316(  a)(  2).  Moreover,  the  further,  unsubstantiated  assertion  that  the  loss  of  the  channel  19  translator  would  jeopardize  the  cont  inued  provision  of  high  qualit  y  noncommercial  programming  through  its 
 main  station  does  not  raise  a  substantial  and  material  question  of  fact  that  allowing  the  use  of  NTSC  channel  19  in  Charlottesville  would  effect  a  modification  of  Shenandoah's  license  for  Station  WVPT-TV 
 in  Staunton. 
 20.  Nor  is  t  he  secondary  st  at  us  of  Shenandoah’s  channel  19  translat  or  alt  ered  by  its  filing 
 on  January  28,  2000  of  a  certification  of  eligibility  for  Class  A  Low  Power  Television  Status  for  the 
 channel  19  translator.  34  As  noted  above,  the  enactment  on  November  29,  1999  of  the  CBPA  amended 
 Section  336  to  require  the  establishment  of  Class  A  low  power  television  service.  As  required  by 
 Section  336(  f)((  1)(  B),  Shenandoah  has  submitted  a  certification  of  eligibilit  y  indicat  ing  its  int  ent  to  file 
 an  application  for  a  Class  A  Low  Power  Television  license  for  channel  19.  It  alleges  that,  with  the 
 exception  of  the  designation  as  a  low  power  licensee,  the  translator  service  currently  provided  on 
 channel  19  complies  with  all  of  the  requirements  for  Class  A  status.  Even  assuming  that  there  is  a 
 basis  for  a  public  interest  determination  to  treat  the  channel  19  translator  as  a  qualifying  low  power 
 television  station  within  the  meaning  of  Section  336(  f)(  2),  35  the  Commission  could  not  grant  a  Class  A 
 license  for  channel  19  in  Charlottesville.  Section  336(  f)(  7)(  A)(  i)  prohibits  the  grant  of  a  Class  A  license 
 absent  a  showing  that  it  “will  not  cause  int  erference  wit  hin  the  predict  ed  Grade  B  cont  our  (as  of  t  he 
 date  of  enactment  of  the  Community  Broadcasters  Protection  Act  .  .  .  ,  or  as  proposed  in  a  change 
 application  filed  on  or  before  such  date)  of  a  station  operating  in  analog  format.”  Petitioners’  predicted 
 Grade  B  contour  for  channel  19,  as  proposed  on  June  24,  1998,  is  entitled  to  protection  under  that

 provision,  and  implementing  Commission  rules,  because  their  settlement  agreement  proposing  a 
 reasonably  ascertainable  predicted  Grade  B  contour  was  pending  on  November  29,  1999,  the  date  of 
 enactment  of  the  CBPA.  36  Specifically,  the  settlement  agreement,  as  supplemented  on  June  24,  1998, 
 proposes  “operation  on  channel  19  instead  of  channel  64,  at  the  same  transmitting  location  and  with 
 subst  ant  ially  the  same  technical  facilit  ies.”  37  Thus,  Shenandoah  will  be  unable  t  o  show,  as  required  by 
 Section  336(  f)(  7)(  A)(  i),  that  a  class  A  low  power  television  license  on  channel  19  will  not  cause 
 interference  within  petitioners’  predicted  Grade  B  contour  that  was  proposed  as  of  November  29, 
 1999.  Its  timely  submission  of  a  certification  of  eligibility  for  Class  A  Low  Power  Television  Status  for 
 the  channel  19  translator  is  therefore  not  an  impediment  to  our  action  herein  approving  petitioners’ 
 January  30,  1998  settlement  agreement  and  modifying  the  construction  permit  to  specify  operation  on 
 channel  19. 


 21.  We  not  e,  however,  that  Cent  ral  Virginia  Educat  ional  Telecommunicat  ions 
 Corporat  ion,  current  ly  operat  ing  St  at  ion  WHTJ(  TV)  (Charlot  t  esville)  on  NTSC  channel  *41,  has  filed 
 a  petition  for  rulemaking  requesting  an  amendment  to  the  Table  of  Allotments  for  Digital  Television.  It 
 seeks  to  change  the  DTV  channel  allotment  for  station  WHTJ-  DT  in  Charlottesville  from  channel  14  to 
 channel  46.  We  direct  the  Mass  Media  Bureau  to  expedite  consideration  of  the  proposed  move  to 
 channel  46,  grant  of  which  could  make  channel  14  available  for  secondary  television  service  in 
 Charlot  t  esville.  To  avoid  disrupt  ion  of  its  current  translat  or  service  on  channel  19,  Shenandoah  may 
 wish  to  submit  a  displacement  application  for  channel  14  to  be  processed  by  the  Mass  Media  Bureau  in 
 accordance  with  its  usual  procedures.  We  note  further  that  the  Commission  has  proposed  to  institute  a 
 further  rulemaking  proceeding  seeking  comment  on  whether  translators  should  be  accorded  some  form 
 of  primary  status.  38  Depending  upon  the  outcome  of  that  proceeding  and  subject  to  any  eligibilit  y 
 criteria  developed  therein,  Shenandoah  could  seek  such  primary  status  if  it  is  ultimately  authorized  to 
 provide  television  translator  service  on  channel  14. 


 22.  Viacom  also  claims  that  it  would  be  adversely  impacted  by  authorization  of  analog  operat  ion  on  channel  19  in  Charlot  t  esville.  In  cont  rast  to  Shenandoah,  however,  it  does  not  allege  that

 the  proposed  use  of  channel  19  will  modify  its  current  authorization  for  Station  WGNT-  DT  (Portsmouth).  Rather,  it  claims  that  interference  will  result  if  its  current  license  for  digital  channel  19  is 
 modified  in  the  future  to  permit  operation  at  increased  power.  As  the  Bureau  notes,  however,  Commission  regulations  do  not  accord  Viacom  a  right  to  maximize  the  power  at  the  Portsmouth 
 station,  and  the  Bureau,  based  on  its  engineering  analysis,  has  indicated  that  the  presence  of  an  analog  t  elevision  st  at  ion  on  channel  19  at  Charlot  t  esville  will  not  det  riment  ally  affect  the  digit  al  table  of 
 allotments.  Thus,  the  channel  switch  would  not  effect  a  modification  of  Viacom's  current  license  for  Station  WGNT-  DT.  39  There  is  presently  no  vacant  digital  allotment  for  Charlottesville,  and  alt  hough 
 CBC  would  be  given  an  opportunity  to  amend  to  a  digital  channel  at  the  end  of  the  DTV  transition  period,  the  future  availability  of  channel  19  for  that  purpose  remains  to  be  determined.  40  The  DTV 
 allotment  for  WGNT-  TV,  Portsmouth,  therefore,  neither  bars  the  modification  of  CBC's  construction  permit,  nor  warrants  the  grant  of  the  NTSC  permit  subject  to  the  express  condition,  requested  by 
 Viacom,  that  CBC  could  not  oppose  any  future  WGNT-  TV  maximization  proposal  up  to  and  including  one  megawatt.  Thus,  neither  Shenandoah  nor  Viacom  has  alleged  an  interest  that  is  legally  protected 
 under  the  Commission's  rules  and  policies  or  that  would  be  adversely  impacted  by  modifying  CBC's  construction  permit.  Nor  have  they  raised  a  substantial  and  material  question  of  fact  requiring  a  hearing 
 to  determine  whether  the  proposed  modification  would  serve  the  public  interest.  Such  modification,  therefore,  does  not  necessitate  the  institution  of  further  proceedings  to  explore  the  objections  raised  by 
 Viacom  and  Shenandoah. 
 23.  One  additional  matter  warrants  comment.  Operation  on  NTSC  channel  19  would,  as  Lindsay  and  Achernar  conceded  in  seeking  to  amend  to  that  channel,  be  slightly  short-  spaced  with 
 WGNT-  DT,  as  currently  authorized.  41  An  engineering  statement  filed  in  support  of  the  amendment  to  NTSC  channel  19  assertedly  demonstrates  satisfaction  of  the  interference  standards  set  forth  in  Section 
 73.623.  42  Shenandoah  disputes  that  showing  and  submits  that  there  has  not  been  a  good  cause 


 39  See  WBEN,  Inc.  v.  FCC,  396  F.  2d  609  (D.  C.  Cir.  (D.  C.  Cir.  1961),  finding  that  a  modification  had  occurred 
 where  Commission  granted  an  unconditional  construction  permit  authorizing  presunrise  operations  that,  if  used, 
 would  cause  interference  to  the  appellant,  even  though  the  rules  permitted  the  Commission  to  order  cessation  of  the 
 presunrise  operation  if  it  caused  undue  interference.  In  contrast  to  the  situation  in  WBEN,  where  the  license  was 
 deemed  modified  within  the  meaning  of  the  statute  by  the  grant  of  an  unconditional  permit,  the  substitution  of 
 channel  19  does  not  impact  on  the  current  license  for  WGNT-  DT;  any  adverse  impact  on  WGNT-  DT  would  occur 
 in  the  future  only  if  the  Commission  ultimately  increases  the  authorized  power  for  Station  WGNT-  DT. 


 40  The  Commission  has  indicated  that  it  would  be  equitable,  where  possible,  to  permit  new  analog  permittees, 
 whose  applications  are  granted  after  April  3,  1997  and  are  thus  ineligible  for  an  initial  paired  digital  license,  to 
 participate  in  the  conversion  to  digital  television.  Memorandum  Opinion  and  Order  on  Reconsideration  of  the

 DTV  channel  with  the  analog  channel  they  are  granted,  but  would  have  an  opportunity  to  convert  to  digital 
 television  on  the  channel  they  were  granted  so  long  as  the  proposed  DTV  station  protects  all  DTV  and  NTSC 
 stations.  Id.  at  1359-  60  ¶  27.

 showing  warranting  a  waiver  of  the  short-  spacing  rules.  43  Significantly,  however,  Viacom,  the  ultimate  licensee  of  WGNT-  DT,  does  not  oppose  the  substitution  of  channel  19  on  this  basis.  The  Bureau, 
 moreover,  has  indicat  ed  t  hat  t  he  addit  ion  of  NTSC  channel  19  in  Charlot  t  esville  would  not  detrimentally  affect  the  digital  channel  19  allotment.  In  these  circumstances,  and  particularly  since 
 Shenandoah  lacks  standing  under  Section  316(  a)(  2)  to  complain  of  the  possible  impact  of  the  proposed  action  on  another  licensee,  we  find  no  substantial  and  material  questions  of  fact  that  the  short-  spacing 
 bet  ween  NTSC  channel  19,  Charlot  t  esville  and  WGNT-  DT,  Port  smout  h  would  result  in  cognizable  interference. 


 24.  In  connection  with  the  applicants'  request  to  amend  Achernar's  pending  application  for  channel  64  to  specify  channel  19,  Shenandoah  and  Viacom  urged  that  the  substitution  of  channel  19  for 
 channel  64  would  impermissibly  short-  circuit  procedures  requiring  the  institution  of  a  rulemaking  proceeding  to  allot  channel  19  to  Charlottesville,  as  well  as  a  compet  it  ive  licensing  proceeding  to  select 
 the  licensee  for  channel  19.  In  light  of  our  determination  to  grant  the  construction  permit  for  channel  64  but  modify  it  to  specify  operation  on  channel  19,  we  need  not  entertain  competing  applications  for 
 channel  19.  As  discussed  above,  Section  316(  a)  of  the  Act  requires  that  we  entertain  protests  from  licensees  or  permittees  who  believe  their  license  would  be  modified  by  the  proposed  action,  and  we 
 have  considered  such  protests  from  Shenandoah  and  Viacom.  We  are  not  required,  however,  to  entertain  competing  applications.  Nor  would  it  make  sense  to  do  so  since  the  license  grant  in  question 
 is  a  narrow  exception  to  our  general  policy  of  not  accepting  additional  NTSC  applications.  See  n.  30,  supra,  n.  45,  infra.  Shenandoah’s  application  for  channel  19,  tendered  in  response  to  the  Mass  Media 
 Bureau’s  November  22,  1999  Public  Notice  is,  in  any  event,  beyond  the  scope  of  that  Public  Notice.  The  Public  Notice  affords  a  window  filing  opportunity  only  to  persons  who  filed  rulemaking 
 petitions  on  or  before  July  25,  1996  to  add  an  NTSC  channel  to  the  TV  Table  of  Allotments  and  to  persons  with  applications  for  new  full-  service  NTSC  television  that  were  filed  before 
 September  20,  1996  or  that  were  filed  after  that  date  in  response  to  a  valid  cutoff  list.  44  Public  Notice,  supra  n.  8,  at  2.  Moreover,  in  accordance  with  the  Commission’s  compet  it  ive  bidding  rules, 
 the  Public  Notice  provides  that  “wherever  two  or  more  applications  were  pending  for  the  same  allotment  before  July  1997,  the  group  is  closed  and  no  additional  applications  for  the  allotment  (on  the 
 new  channel)  will  be  accepted.”  Id.,  at  6.  Achernar’s  and  Lindsay’s  competing  applications  for  channel  64  were  filed  in  1986  and  their  proposed  settlement  is  contingent  on  the  immediat  e  grant  of  a 
 construction  permit  for  channel  64  or  such  other  channel  as  the  Commission  shall  select.  In  these  circumstances,  the  Public  Notice  provides  no  basis  to  accept  Shenandoah’s  tendered  application  for 
 channel  19,  and  it  is  therefore  dismissed. 
 25.  We  also  recognize  that  the  modification  of  CBC's  license  to  specify  operation  on  channel  19,  in  lieu  of  channel  64,  requires  an  amendment  to  the  Table  of  Allotments.  But  we  find  for 
 good  cause,  pursuant  to  5  U.  S.  C.  §  553(  b)(  3)(  B),  that  a  notice  and  comment  rulemaking  is  not  required  in  these  circumstances.  No  purpose  would  be  served  by  initiating  a  notice  and  comment 
 proceeding  to  allot  NSTC  channel  19  to  Charlottesville.  First  ,  analog  television  is  a  mat  ure  broadcast  service,  and  analog  channel  19  is,  due  to  existing  assignments  of  that  channel,  not  available  for

 44  The  Public  Notice  provides  that  a  channel  change  cannot  be  accomplished  by  an  amendment  to  a  pending 
 application,  but  expressly  exempts  the  instant  settlement  request  for  channel  19  in  Charlottesville  from  the 
 requirement  that  a  channel  change  must  be  requested  by  a  petition  for  rulemaking.  Public  Notice  at  n.  9.

 allot  ment  t  o  any  comparable  communit  y  ot  her  t  han  Charlot  t  esville.  Second,  due  to  the  imminent  switch  to  digital  television,  the  Analog  Table  of  Allotments  has  ceased  to  function  as  a  evolving 
 mechanism  to  be  modified  to  reflect  changing  needs  and  technology.  45  Inst  ead  it  exist  s  solely  to  preserve  the  status  quo  (and  in  particular,  interference-  free  analog  television  service)  during  the  DTV 
 transition.  And,  in  contrast  to  any  amendment  to  the  Analog  Table  of  Allotments  that  may  be  filed  during  t  he  window  filing  opport  unit  y  announced  in  the  November  22,  1999  Public  Notice,  the  Mass 
 Media  Bureau  has  affirmatively  stated  that  allotting  analog  channel  19  to  the  community  of  Charlot  t  esville  det  riment  ally  affect  s  neit  her  the  Analog  Table  of  Allot  ment  s  nor  t  he  Digit  al  Table  of 
 Allot  ment  s,  provided  the  channel  19  permit  for  Charlot  t  esville  is  condit  ioned  so  as  t  o  prot  ect  exist  ing  NTSC  channel  19  allot  ment  s  in  Jacksonville,  Nort  h  Carolina,  Kingsport  ,  Tennessee,  and  Jeanet  t  e, 
 Pennsylvania.  CBC's  agreement  to  accept  that  condition  adequately  protects  the  public's  interest  in  maintaining  interference-  free  analog  television  service  as  well  as  the  interests  of  existing  licensees 
 authorized  to  operate  full-  service  television  stations  on  analog  channel  19.  Adding  analog  channel  19  to  the  Table  of  Allotments  is,  in  sum,  an  essentially  ministerial  act  designed  purely  to  ensure  the 
 continuing  accuracy  of  the  Table.  In  these  circumstances,  a  notice  and  comment  rulemaking  is  not  required  to  protect  the  procedural  rights  of  the  listening  public,  of  existing  licensees,  or  of  any  other 
 party  potentially  affected  by  such  allotment. 
 26.  Finally,  we  address  two  ancillary  mat  t  ers  involving  t  he  agreement  wit  h  t  he  Observatory.  First,  we  agree  with  the  Bureau  that,  although  the  technical  proposal  for  channel  19  does 
 not  comply  fully  with  Section  73.685(  e)  of  the  rules,  it  is  nevertheless  acceptable  because  the  proposed  antenna  pattern  with  a  null  in  excess  of  15  dB  was  designed  to  accommodate  the  needs  of  the 
 Observatory.  46  Second,  Achernar,  by  its  November  19,  1997  petition  for  leave  to  amend  and  attached  amendment,  submitted  for  filing  translator  applications  for  the  cities  of  Staunton  and  Waynesboro, 
 Virginia  that  are  still  an  integral  part  of  the  agreement  with  the  Observatory,  despite  the  switch  to  channel  19.  47  As  the  Bureau  notes,  the  translators  are  not  yet  eligible  for  permanent  licenses  because 


 45  Specifically,  the  Commission,  in  order  to  maximize  the  spectrum  available  to  facilitate  that  transition, 
 announced  in  July  1996  that  it  would  no  longer  accept  petitions  for  rulemaking  to  amend  the  Analog  Table  of 
 Allotments,  and  that  as  of  September  20,  1996,  it  would  not  accept  applications  for  NTSC  channels  specified  on 
 the  Table.  Advanced  Television  Systems  and  their  Impact  upon  the  Existing  Television  Broadcast  Service  (Sixth 
 Further  Notice),  11  FCC  Rcd  10968,  10992  (1996).  And,  absent  extraordinary  circumstances,  an  existing  NTSC 
 allotment  that  becomes  vacant  is  routinely  deleted  from  Table.  See  Dorothy  O.  Schulze  and  Deborah  Brigham, 
 supra  n.  30,  in  which  the  Commission  directed  the  Mass  Media  Bureau  to  accept  competing  applications  for  an 
 analog  television  channel  after  termination  of  a  comparative  licensing  proceeding  in  which  all  of  the  applicants 
 were  found  unqualified  to  be  a  Commission  licensee. 


 46  Section  73.685(  e)  provides  that  "Stations  operating  on  channels  14-  69  with  transmitters  delivering  a  peak 
 visual  power  output  of  more  than  1  kW  may  employ  directive  transmitting  antennas  with  a  maximum  to  minimum 
 radiation  in  the  horizontal  plane  of  not  more  than  15  dB."  Here  a  maximum  visual  effective  radiated  power  of 
 2380  kW  is  proposed  with  an  antenna  pattern  indicating  a  null  of  20.6  dB  in  the  direction  of  the  Observatory. 


 47  See  Supplement  to  Agreement,  executed  June  1,  1998,  at  ¶  3,  providing  "The  Observatory  has  no  objection  to 
 the  substitution  of  channel  19  for  channel  64  under  the  agreement  so  long  as  the  "equivalent  protection"  and  other 
 provisions  in  ¶  6  of  the  Agreement  govern."  Paragraph  4  of  the  Agreement,  which  is  not  modified  by  the 
 Supplement,  provides  that  "the  licensee  may  operate  one  or  two  television  translators  to  provide  service  to  the 
 Staunton  and  Waynesboro,  Virginia  areas  within  the  National  Radio  Quiet  Zone  .  .  .  ."

 48  Since  1984  the  Commission's  processing  rules  have  required  that  television  translator  applications  for  new 
 stations  or  for  major  modifications  of  the  facilities  of  existing  stations  may  be  filed  only  on  dates  specified  by  the 
 Commission,  47  C.  F.  R.  §  73.3564(  d),  and  our  practice  has  been  to  announce  such  windows  periodically.  See  Low 
 Power  Television  and  Television  Translator  Service  (Report  and  Order),  102  FCC  2d  295,  297-  98  ¶  5  (1984).  In 
 connection  with  the  adoption  of  competitive  bidding  procedures  for  commercial  broadcast  applications,  we  have 
 revised  our  processing  rules  to  require  the  filing  within  a  publicly  announced  auction  filing  window  of  virtually  all 
 commercial  broadcast  and  secondary  broadcast  applications  for  new  facilities  or  for  major  modifications  of  existing 
 facilities.  First  Report  and  Order,  13  FCC  Rcd  at  15972-  73  ¶¶  136-  38. 


 49  In  referring  this  matter  to  the  Bureau,  we  note  that  the  translators  are  necessitated  by  the  agreement  with  the 
 Observatory.  For  this  reason,  we  believe  that  the  public  interest  considerations  reflected  in  this  order  are  relevant 
 and  may  be  given  weight  in  conjunction  with  the  handling  of  the  television  translator  applications. 


 50  Attached  to  the  Motion  are  letters  from  Members  of  Congress  and  numerous  citizens  supporting 
 Shenandoah’s  opposition  to  the  grant  of  a  construction  permit  for  channel  19.  Pursuant  to  Sections  0.251(  c)  and 
 (h),  1.41,  and  1.47(  g)  of  the  Rules,  Shenandoah  requests  that  the  citizens’  letters  be  placed  in  the  record.  No  party 
 to  this  adjudicatory  proceeding  will  be  harmed  by  entry  of  the  attached  letters  into  the  record  in  MM  Docket  No. 
 86-  440.  With  one  exception,  each  of  the  letters  was  mailed  to  the  parties  in  this  proceeding  at  the  time  of  their 
 submission  to  the  Commission.  Although  the  certificate  of  service  was  inadvertently  omitted  from  the  original 
 submission,  Section  1.47(  g)  of  the  rules  provides  that  proof  of  service  may  be  supplied  at  any  time,  provided  that 
 this  will  not  materially  prejudice  the  parties.  Shenandoah  has  verified  that,  with  one  exception,  it 
 contemporaneously  mailed  copies  of  the  submission  to  all  of  the  parties  and  has  adequately  explained  the 
 circumstances  relating  to  the  submission  of  one  letter  that  was  not  contemporaneously  mailed  to  the  parties.  See 
 Letter,  dated  November  8,  1999,  from  Jonathan  D.  Blake,  Counsel,  Shenandoah  Valley  Educational  Television,  to 
 David  S.  Senzel,  Esq.,  Administrative  Law  Division,  Office  of  General  Counsel,  Federal  Communications 
 Commission.  Given  counsel’s  verification  that  all  of  the  correspondence  has  been  served  on  the  parties  and  that  the
