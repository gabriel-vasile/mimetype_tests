                             DECISION

Before: Judge Weisberger

Appearances: John J. Podgurski, U.S. Department of Labor,
             Mine Safety and Health Administration, Arlington,
             Virginia,; Linda Henry, Esq., U.S. Department of
             Labor, Office of the Solicitor, Philadelphia,
             Pennsylvania, for the Petitioner;
             Randy Rothermel, Owner, Rothermel Coal Company,
             Klingerstown, Pennsylvania, for the Respondent.

                      Statement of the Case

     At issue in this civil penalty proceeding are three
citations issued by the Secretary of Labor (Petitioner) 
allegation violations by Rothermel Coal Company (Respondent)
of mandatory safety regulations set forth in Title 30 in the
Code of Federal Regulations.  Pursuant to notice, the case
was heard in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania on December 14, 1995. 
Harold Glandon and Mark Mott testified for the Petitioner,
and Randy Rothermel, testified for the Respondent.

                 Findings of Fact and Discussion

                Citation No. 41517689.

     On April 20, 1995, Harold Glandon, an MSHA inspector,
inspected the No. 11 Vein Slope Mine, an underground coal 
mine operated by Respondent. A 440 volt cable supplied 
electricity to an energized power box that controlled the main
surface fan.  The cable was secured within approximately 
6 inches from where it entered the box, and a piece of conduit
was wrapped around the cable where it entered the box. However,
there were no  restraining clips to prevent the cable from 
moving at the point where it entered the box. Glandon opined
that inasmuch as the cable could have moved, as it was not 
rigidly attached to the box, the cable could have become
worn at the point of contact with the box. He issued citation
alleging a violation of 30 C.F.R. § 77.505.

     Section 77.505 supra provides, as pertinent, as follows:

     "Cables shall enter metal frames of ... electric
     compartments only through proper fittings."

     Randy Rothermel testified for Rothermel Coal Company and
indicated that on February 1995 a fire had occurred on the
property burning all switch boxes.  New switch boxes were
then installed and Rothermel contacted MSHA to arrange for
technical assistance concerning the installation of the new
switch boxes.  According to Rothermel, a Mr. Hagy, the
electrical inspector for MSHA working out of the Wilkes-
Barre office, told him that his boss, Larry Brown, had
indicated that no violations would be written "on electrity"
if technical assistance would be asked for (Tr. 37).

     Glandon's testimony was not rebutted, contradicted, or
impeached by Respondent.  I thus find, based upon his
testimony, that inasmuch as the cable that entered the box
at issue was not restrained at the point of entry, it could
have moved causing it rub against the entry to the box.
This condition could have led to loss of the cable's
insulation.  I find that the cable did not enter "through
proper fittings".  I conclude that Respondent did violate
Section 77.505 supra.

     Rothermel's testimony that he had been informed by MSHA
officials that no electrical violations would be issued if
he were to call for technical assistance, does not negate
the fact, as testified to by Glandon, that a violation of
Section 77.505 supra had occurred.  However, I do find
Rothermel testimony to be trustworthy, and I conclude that
Respondent's negligence herein was low.  I find that a
penalty of $50 is appropriate for this violation.

     Citation Nos. 4151770 and 4151771.

     On March 14, 1994, Respondent was advised in writing by
W. R. Compton, the MSHA district manager, that the mine
ventilation map for the subject mine was received on January
27, 1994, and that the next map was due for submission to
the District manager on March 14, 1995.  On about February
1, 1995, the building containing Respondent's bulletin
board, office, and hoist serving the underground mine,
burned down.  Production at the mine ceased until the first
or second week in March 1995, when use of the hoist was
resumed.  Rothermel subsequently obtained a survey and
personally filed the mine map with the Wilkes-Barre MSHA
office on April 26, 1995.  On April 26, 1995, Rothermel also
placed a copy of the map in his truck which was kept on the
premises and so informed his one employee.  Gladon indicated
that when he was on the premises on April 27, 1995,
a map had not been filed by March 14, and there was no
updated map on the mine's bulletin board.  He issued 2
citations, one alleging a violation of 30 C.F.R. §
75.372(a)(1) which, as pertinent, provides that an operator
shall submit to the district manager 3 copies of a mine map
"at intervals not exceeding 12 months".  He also issued a
citation alleging a violation of 30 C.F.R. § 75.1203, which
as pertinent, provides that the mine map " . . . shall be 
available for inspection by the Secretary or his authorized
representative."

     The uncontroverted evidence indicates that the mine map in
question was first filed on April 26, 1995, an interval
which exceeded 12 months from the last filing.  I thus find
that Respondent did violate Section 75.372(a)(1), supra.
However, due to the difficulties encountered by Respondent
as a consequence of the fire and lack of access to the
underground area, I conclude that the Respondent's
negligence was extremely low.  I find that a penalty of $20
is appropriate.


     I find Rothermel's testimony credible, having observed 
his deamnor, that the map at issue was in his truck on the
premises on April 27.  Hence I find that it was "available"
for inspection by Gladen or other miners.  I thus find that
it has not been established that Respondent violated Section
75.1203 supra.  Hence citation No. 4151770 shall be
dismissed.

                              ORDER

     It is ORDERED that Respondent shall, within 30 days of this
decision, pay a penalty of $70.  It is further ORDERED that
citation No. 4151770 be DISMISSED.
