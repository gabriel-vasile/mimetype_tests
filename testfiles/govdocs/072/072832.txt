Subject: Experiments on Attention and Quantum Theory

Stan Klein inquired about what sort of experiments
pertaining to attention I had in mind that might distinguish
between classical and quantum theories of the mind-brain
system, and expressed a strong belief that no such experiments
could ever be found.

The experiments of Libet, Koler's and Grunau, Grey Walters have focussed
attention (See my book MM&QM Sec. 1.10) on  peculiar timing reversals
in quantum mechanics, relative to what classical physics demands.
Recent postings of mine on q-mind have again stressed this point.

Jeffery Schwartz has alerted me to the fact that experiments
at Yale on Tourettes Syndrome (Tic) suppression by attentional action
(mental force) are going to be filmed at very high speeds.

If one models the mentally forced supression of TIC expression
by a Zeno-type holding of a mental state in place against the
normal dynamical brain activity then the question arises whether there
could be any precursive effects of a sudden externally demanded turning
off of this mental effort. According to classical physics there could be
no such precursive effect in a properly designed experiment: the effect
of turning off the effort should be later than the turning off of the
effort. But in a quantum mechanical model of the mind-brain there will
be a host of slightly differing superposed overlapping potentialities for
the next experiential events all competing for actualization.
These potentialities will have been formed by brain activities at slightly
earlier times, and, as in the discussion of Einstein set-up described on
my earlier posting, the picking out of one experience will actualize the
whole state that leads up to that experience, and all subsequent human
observations will be condordant with the requirement that during the
interval prior to the experience the brain state will be the brain
state that leads to this experience. So if the sequence of experiences
is held rigidly in place up to some time T, and then suddenly changes
to a different structure, one should expect from this quantum model
that there will be some corresponding systematical changes in the brain
just prior to time T, which is fixed externally. Classically there should
be no such systematic precursive change.

Whether this precursive  change should result in a precursive change
in tic expression is perhaps not so clear. But I would expect, on the
basis of the model that I have been promoting in recent weeks, based on
the attention-controlled Zeno effect, that there would be some precursive
effects in the brain. If they are found then it would seem that classical
concepts would be proven to be inadequate to describe the mind-brain
system: I do not think that any precursive effect of the sudden cessation
of this mental effort at an externally fixed time, in an experiment that
is properly designed, executed, and analyzed, can be explained within the
classical framework.

Jeffery Schwartz has also informed me that technology for tapping into
the spinal column are advancing rapidly. This part of the nervous system.

Considerations similar to the ones just discussed suggest that if strong
attention is being paid to some just-at-threshold sensation that is
caused by nerve impulses traveling from, say, a foot, then a sudden
externally directed cessation of that attention ought to produce what
recording instruments would identify as a precursive effect in the spinal
column, provided there were no actual reductions in the body except
those associated with the conscious experiences.

In general, it appears to me that timing anamolies within body/mind
systems could provide a clean way to prove the inadaquacy of classical
concepts in the study of such systems.

Dear Stan,

I am amazed that you believe that you can account for causal
anomalies of the kind I was describing within a classical framework.

You must have misunderstood what I was saying. In the experiments I was
proposing the subject is holding some idea (e.g., resisting a strong
urge to give in, and allow the tic to occur) in place by a strong
effort of will. Then at a signal timed in some random way, and 
communicated to him, he turns off this willful effort. In any classical
account any effect in his body/brain of this turning-off of his effort 
must occur *after* the signal has been sent. One must of course design,
execute, and analyze the experiment with care. But in a sufficiently
well designed, executed, and analyzed experiment it may be possible to
identify certain changes in body/brain behavior (say at the neural level)
that are reliably correlated to the time that the signal is sent.
If the timing of the signal is suitably randomized to preclude any
systematic correlation with the pre-existing physical/mental state of the
subject if the signal is not actually transmitted to the subject, then if
there is a systematic change that is correlated to signal time when the
signal is communicated to the subject, and that change occurs *before* the
signal is sent, then I claim that this timing anomaly would not be
explainable within the normal classical-physics framework, where all
such observable cause-effect correlations have cause prior to effect.

Subject: precursive


Henry, Thanks for the clarification of what you meant by the word "precursive"
I thought you were talking about the many time anomalies that Libet found.
Indeed in the experiment you clarified that violates causality I wouldn't
dare to look for a classical explanation (other than the ET helpers). All of 
Libet's experiments, on the other hand, have easy classical explanations. 

Stan
