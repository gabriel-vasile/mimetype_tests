5   Manual queries with feedback
5.1  The user interface
The interface allowed the entry of any number of
find commands operating on "natural language" search
terms. By default, the system would combine the result-
ing sets using the BM1S function described in Section
2.6, but any operation specified by the searcher would
override this. All user-entered terms were added to a
pool of terms for potential use in query expansion. Ev-
ery set produced had any documents previously seen by
the user removed from it.
  The show (document display) command displayed
the full text of a single document (or as much as the
user wished to see) with the retrieval terms highlighted
(sometimes inaccurately). Unless specified by the user
this would be the highest-weighted remaining document
from the most recent set. At the end of a document dis-
play the relevance question

    "Is this relevant (yin!?)"

appeared; the system counted documents eliciting the
"?" response as relevant3. The DOCNO was then out-
put to a results file, together with the iteration number.
  Once some documents had been judged r~levant the
exiraci command would produce a list of terms drawn
from the pool consisting of user-entered terms and terms
extracted from all relevant documents.  Terms in the
pool were given w(i) weights. User-entered terms were
weighted as if they had occurred in four out of five fic-
titious relevant documents (in addition to any real rele-
vant documents they might have been present in). Thus
for user-entered terms the numerator in equation 1 be-
comes (r+4+0.5)/(R+5-r-4+0.5) [2].
  Query expansion terms were selected from the term
pool in descending order of the selection value [11]
termweight x (r + 4)/(R + 5) for user-entered terms

  31t was possible for searchers to change their minds about the
relevance of a document. Subsequent feedback iterations handled
this correctly, but the DOCNO would be duplicated in the search
output. This appears to have led to some minor errors in the
frozen ranks evaluation in a few topics.

otherwise iermweight ~ r/R, subject to not all docu-
ments containing the term having been displayed, and
the term not being a semi-stopword4 (unless it was en-
tered by the user). A maximum of 20 terms was used.
These selected terms were then used automatically in
an expansion search, again with the BM1S weighting
function.
  Each invocation of exiraci used all the available rele-
vance information, and there was no "new search" com-
mand. This was intended to encourage compliance with
the TREC guidelines; it was not possible for a dissat-
isfied user to restart a search. When the searcher de-
cided to finish, after some sequence of find, show and
exiraci commands, the resulis command invoked a final
iteration of exiraci (provided there had been at least
three positive relevance judgments).  Finally, the top
1000 DOCNOs from the current set were output to the
results file. Apart from the aforementioned commands,
users could do info seis and hisiory.

5.2  Searchers and search procedure
The searches were done by a panel of five staff and re-
search students from City University's Department of
Information Science. Search procedure was not rigidly
prescribed, although some guidelines were given. There
was a short briefing session and searchers were encour-
aged to experiment with the system before starting.
Procedures seemed to be considerably influenced by in-
dividual preferences and styles.  Some searches were
done collaboratively.
  Searchers tried to find relevant documents by any
means they liked within a single session. The number of
iterations of query expansion varied between zero and
four, with a mean of two.  The IDs of all documents
looked at were output to the results file, together with
the iteration number. At the end of the session, if at
least three relevant documents had been found the sys-
tem did a final iteration of query expansion and output
  4Semi-stopwords are words which, while they may be useful
search terms if entered by a user, are likely to be detrimental if
used in query expansion: numerals, month-names, common ad-
verbs etc.
