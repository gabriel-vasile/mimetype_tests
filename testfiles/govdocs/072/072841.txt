  Description:
    Abstract:
      High-resolution multi-beam sonar mapping of Yellowstone Lake
      was conducted by the U.S. Geological Survey in conjunction
      with the National Park Service from 1999 to 2002. Yellowstone
      Lake is the largest high-altitude lake in North America, at an
      altitude of 2,357 m with a surface area of 341 km2 (sheet 1).
      More than 140 rivers and streams flow into Yellowstone Lake.
      The Yellowstone River, which enters at the southern end of the
      Lake into the Southeast Arm (sheet 1), dominates the inflow of
      water and sediment. The only outlet from the lake is at Fishing
      Bridge where the Yellowstone River flows northward discharging
      375 to 4,600 cubic feet per second.

    Purpose:
      Using the bathymetric and seismic data in addition to the high-
      resolution aeromagnetic data acquired in 1996 and previous on-
      land geologic mapping, a geologic map was prepared. Also various
      bathymetric perspectives of the lake floor have been included in
      sheet 2.

    Attribute_Accuracy_Report:
      Multi-beam sonar mapping occurred over a four-year period beginning
      in 1999 through 2002.  The multi-beam swath-bathymetric surveys
      employed a SeaBeam 1180 (180 kHz) instrument with a depth resolution
      of <1 percent of the water depth.  Water depth in the survey areas
      varied from approximately 4 to 133 m. The multi-beam instrument used
      126 beams arrayed over a 150 degree ensonification angle to map a
      swath width of 7.4 times water depth. The new survey, with locations
      controlled with <1 m both horizontally and vertically using
      differential GPS, utilized more than 244 million soundings to produce
      high-resolution continuous overlapping coverage of the lake's
      bathymetry.

  Logical_Consistency_Report:
    Seismic-reflection records of the upper 25 m of the lake bottom also
    were obtained in 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2003. The seismic reflection
    profiling utilized an EdgeTech SB-216S, that sweeps a frequency range
    from 2 to 10 kHz and has a beam angle of 15 degrees to 20 degrees.
    Bothe the swath-unit transducer and the sub-bottom seismic unit were
    rigidly mounted to the transom of the National Park Service RV "Cutthroat,"
    an 8-m-long aluminum boat.
