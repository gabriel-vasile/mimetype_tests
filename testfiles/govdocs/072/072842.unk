Microbial Pesticide Test Guidelines


OPPTS 885.3100
Acute Dermal Toxicity/Pathology

                              Introduction

        This guideline is one of a series of test guidelines that have 
been developed by the Office of Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic 
Substances, United States Environmental Protection Agency for use in the 
testing of pesticides and toxic substances, and the development of test 
data that must be submitted to the Agency for review under Federal 
regulations.

        The Office of Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic Substances 
(OPPTS) has developed this guideline through a process of harmonization 
that blended the testing guidance and requirements that existed in the 
Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics (OPPT) and appeared in Title 
40, Chapter I, Subchapter R of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), 
the Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP) which appeared in publications of 
the National Technical Information Service (NTIS) and the guidelines 
published by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development 
(OECD).

        The purpose of harmonizing these guidelines into a single set of 
OPPTS guidelines is to minimize variations among the testing procedures 
that must be performed to meet the data requirements of the U. S. 
Environmental Protection Agency under the Toxic Substances Control Act 
(15 U.S.C. 2601) and the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide 
Act (7 U.S.C. 136, et seq.).

OPPTS 885.3100   Acute dermal toxicity/pathology.

        (a) Scope--(1) Applicability. This guideline is intended to meet 
testing requirements of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and 
Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) (7 U.S.C. 136, et seq.).

        (2) Background. The source material used in developing this 
harmonized OPPTS test guideline is OPP guideline 152A-11.

        (b) Purpose. Acute dermal toxicity data provide information on 
health hazards likely to arise from a single dermal application of 
soluble or particulate chemicals associated with a preparation of the 
MPCA, and/or associated with other ingredients in formulations of the 
MPCA, and/or associated with products from genetic material 
intentionally introduced into the MPCA.

        (c) Definitions. The following definitions apply to this 
guideline:

        Acute dermal toxicity is the adverse effect occurring during or 
following a 24-hour dermal exposure to a single dose of a test 
substance.

        (d) Principles of the test method. The MPCA in each formulation 
to be tested is applied in a single high dose to the skin of 
experimental animals. Subsequently, observations of effects and deaths 
are made. Animals that die during the test are necropsied, and at the 
conclusion of the test, the surviving animals are sacrificed and 
necropsied as indicated by the nature of the toxic effects observed.

        (e) Substance to be tested. (1) The manufacturing-use product 
shall be tested to support the registration of each manufacturing-use 
product.

        (2) The end-use product shall be tested to support the 
registration of each end-use product.

        (f) Test procedures--(1) Animal selection--(i) Species and 
strain. Although several mammalian test species may be used, the albino 
rabbit is the preferred species. Commonly used laboratory strains should 
be employed. If another species is used, the investigator should provide 
justification/reasoning for the alternative selection. All test animals 
should be free of parasites or pathogens. Females should be nulliparous 
and nonpregnant.

        (ii) Age. Young adult animals should be used. The weight 
variation of animals used in a test should not exceed <plus-minus> 20 
percent of the mean weight for each sex.

        (iii) Sex. Equal numbers of animals of each sex with healthy 
intact skin are recommended.

        (iv) Numbers. At least 10 animals (5 animals of each sex) should 
be used.

        (2) Control groups. Neither a concurrent untreated nor vehicle 
control group are required except when the toxicity of the vehicle is 
unknown.

        (3) Dosing--(i) Dose level. The test substance should be applied 
at 2 g/kg BW. If a dose level of less than 2 g/kg BW is used, a 
justification/explanation must be provided.

        (ii) Vehicle. Where necessary, the formulation to be tested is 
suspended in a suitable vehicle. An aqueous solution should be used. The 
recommended vehicle for the end-use product usually is the same material 
in which the MPCA will be mixed, suspended, or diluted for application.

        (iii) Volume. The moisture content of the test material should 
not be excessive, but should be sufficient to prevent significant drying 
of the test material during the exposure period, and to ensure good 
contact with the skin.

        (4) Exposure duration. The exposure duration should be for 
approximately 24 h.

        (5) Observation period. The observation period should be at 
least for 14 days, but should not be fixed rigidly. It should be 
determined by the toxic reactions, rate of onset, and length of recovery 
period and may be extended when considered necessary. The time at which 
toxicity signs appear and disappear, and their duration are important.

        (6) Preparation of animal skin. (i) Approximately 24 h before 
the test, fur should be removed from the dorsal and ventral area of the 
trunk of each test animal by clipping or shaving.

        (ii) Not less than 10 percent of the body surface area should be 
cleared for application of the test substance. The weight of the animal 
should be taken into account when deciding on the area to be cleared and 
on the dimensions of the covering.

        (7) Application of the test substance (i) The test substance 
should be applied uniformly over an area which is approximately 10 
percent of the total body surface area.

        (ii) The test substance should be held in contact with the skin 
with porous gauze and a nonirritating tape throughout a 24-h exposure 
period. The test site further should be covered in a suitable manner to 
retain the gauze dressing and test substance and ensure that the animals 
cannot ingest the test substance. Restrainers may be used to prevent the 
ingestion of the test substance, but complete immobilization is not 
recommended.

        (iii) At the end of the exposure period, residual test substance 
should be removed, where practical, using water.

        (8) Observation of animals. (i) A careful clinical examination 
should be made at least once each day.

        (ii) Cageside observations should include, but not be limited 
to, changes in:

        (A) The skin (including signs of irritation) and fur.

        (B) Eyes and mucous membranes.

        (C) Respiratory system.

        (D) Circulatory system.

        (E) Autonomic and central nervous system.

        (F) Somatomotor activity.

        (G) Behavior pattern.

        (H) Particular attention should be directed to observation of 
tremors, convulsions, diarrhea, lethargy, salivation, sleep, and coma.

        (iii) Individual weights of animals should be determined shortly 
before the test material is administered, weekly thereafter, and at 
death or at final sacrifice. Changes in weight should be calculated and 
recorded when survival exceeds 1 day.

        (iv) The time of death should be recorded as precisely as 
possible.

        (v) At the end of the 24-h exposure period, and daily 
thereafter, any signs of skin irritation should be recorded and scored.

        (9) Gross pathology. Consideration should be given to performing 
a gross necropsy of all animals if indicated by the appearance of toxic 
effects. If done, all gross pathological changes should be recorded.

        (h) Data and reporting--(1) Treatment of results. In addition to 
the information recommended by OPPTS 885.0001, the test report should 
include the following information:

        (i) Number of animals at the start of the test.

        (ii) Time of death of individual animals.

        (iii) Number of animals displaying other signs of toxicity.

        (iv) Description of toxic effects.

        (v) Definition for one unit of the MPCA used, and the units in 
the dosing material.

        (vi) Dry weight and net weight determinations of the test 
material applied per kilogram body weight of the test animal.

        (vii) Body weights and time taken.

        (viii) Necropsy findings, when performed;and,

        (ix) Pathology findings, when performed.

        (2) Evaluation of results. An evaluation should include the 
relationship if any, between the animals exposed to the test substance 
and the incidence and severity of all abnormalities, including:

        (i) Behavioral abnormalities.

        (ii) Clinical abnormalities.

        (iii) Skin lesions and skin irritation.

        (iv) Body weight changes.

        (v) Mortality.

        (vi) Toxicity.

        (i) Tier progression (1) If evidence of significant and/or 
persistent toxicity are observed, toxic components of the dosing 
material are to be identified, and to a practical extent, isolated.

        (i) An acute toxicity study (OPPTS 885.3550) is to be conducted 
with the toxic components.

        (ii) [Reserved]

        (2) If no toxic effects are observed, no further testing is 
required.
