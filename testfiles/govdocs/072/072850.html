<H2>Background</H2>

The mineralogy, petrography and chemistry of both "primitive" and more 
evolved meteorites recovered on Earth are currently the subjects of intense 
laboratory studies.  The purpose of these studies, in conjunction with 
our knowledge of terrestrial and lunar petrogenesis, is to establish an 
observational framework that can be used progressively to constrain and 
confine cosmochemical and mechanical-dynamic models of early solar-system 
evolutionary processes.  Such modeling attempts include the nature and 
kinetics of nebular condensation and fractionation, the accretion of 
solid matter into planets, and the role of collisional processes in 
planetary formation and surface evolution. All of these processes are 
known to be highly complex.<P>

Fine-grained interplanetary particles (micrometeroids) of masses as little 
as 10E-16 g are, however, largely excluded from models of the early 
solar-system evolution because their mineralogic, petrographic, and 
geochemical nature is largely unknown.  In comparison, however, their 
dynamics, orbital parameters, and total flux are reasonably well 
established, although still fragmentary in a quantitative sense.  According 
to current (largely dynamical) hypotheses, a majority of these objects 
are derived from comets.  This association affords a unique opportunity 
to study early solar-system processes at relatively large radial 
distances from the Sun (greater than approximately 20 AU).  These 
cometary solids may reflect pressure and temperature conditions in the 
solar nebula which are not represented by any of the presently known 
meteorite classes, and therefore may offer potential insight into the 
formation of comets themselves.<P>

<H2>Objectives</H2>

The prime objective of this experiment is to obtain chemical analyses of 
a statistically significant number of micrometeroids.  These data will 
then be compared with the chemical composition of meteorites.  Secondary 
objectives of the experiment relate to density, shape, mass frequency, 
and absolute flux of micrometeroids as deduced from detailed crater 
geometries (depth, diameter, and plane shape) and number of total 
events observed.<P>

<H2>Approach</H2>

This experiment is designed to collect micrometeroid residue in and 
around micrometeroid impact craters that are produced by hypervelocity 
collisions of the natural particles with high-purity targets.  After the 
return of these targets, the micrometeroid residue will be chemically 
analyzed with a large array of state-of-the-art microanalytical tools 
(e.g., electron microprobe, scanning electron microscope with 
energy-dispersive analyzer, Auger and ESCA spectroscopy, and ion probe 
mass analyzer).  In favorable cases, precision mass spectroscopy may 
be possible.  The experiment will involve both active and passive 
collection units.<P>

<H3>Active Unit</H3>

The principles of the "active" unit are <A HREF="#FIG56">described below. 
(See fig. 56.)</A>
A clam shell concept allows two sets of clam shells, housed in a 
12-in.-deep peripheral tray, to be opened and closed.  The figure shows 
one set of clam shells in the stowed (i.e., closed) mode and the other 
set in a deployed mode.  Due to the high sensitivity of the microanalytical 
tools and the extremely small masses of the micrometeroid residue to be 
analyzed (10E-7 to 10E-12 g), the stowed configuration will protect the 
collector surfaces from particulate contaminants during ground handling, 
launch, and LDEF deployment and retrieval sequences.  The clam shells 
will be opened by a timed sequencer some 8 days after LDEF deployment 
and they will close at a similar time prior  to redocking for retrieval 
of LDEF.  The basic contamination barrier is a precision labyrinth seal.<P>

The main collector surfaces are made of 99.99-percent-pure gold sheets 
0.5 mm thick and totaling some 0.85 square meters total surface area.  
Two individual gold panels, each about 57 by 20.6 cm, will be fastened 
to each clam shell tray for a total of seven panels.  A high-quality 
surface finish will be obtained by polishing, acid etching, and 
electroplating.  The space for the eighth panel is taken up by a 
series of experimental collector materials (about 6.5 by 20.6 by 0.05 cm 
each) for the purpose of empirically determining collection efficiency 
and/or optimum chemical background (i.e., signal-to-noise ratio during 
the analytical phase).  These auxiliary surfaces consist of Al 
(99.999 percent pure), Ti (99.9 percent pure), Be (99.9 percent pure), 
Zr (99.8 percent pure), C (99.999 percent pure), Kapton (a polyimide), 
and Teflon filters.  There are three reasons for selecting gold as the 
main collector surface.  First, its behavior under hypervelocity impact 
conditions is reasonably well known, in contrast to that of some of the 
auxiliary surfaces.  Second, gold is not an overly abundant constituent 
in meteorites, and third, it is a highly suitable substrate for many of 
the microanalytical techniques contemplated.  For a model exposure 
duration of 9 months , a fairly well established mass-frequency 
distribution, and a conservatively low flux estimate for micrometeoroids, 
the approximate numbers of micrometeorite craters expected on the gold 
collector are as follows: 165 craters larger than 5 micrometers, 52 craters 
larger than 10 micrometers, and 9 craters larger than 50 micrometers in 
diameter.  Quantitative analysis is feasible only for craters larger 
than 20 micrometers in diameter (approximately 20 events), although an 
attempt will be made at qualitative analysis of smaller craters.<P>

<H3>Passive Unit</H3>

The experiment will use a "passive" collector unit that occupies a 
3-in.-deep peripheral tray.  (See fig. 57.)  This unit will be covered 
by six Al (99.9 percent pure) panels (47 by 41 by 0.3 cm each).  
These surfaces have no special protection against contamination 
because they are rigidly bolted onto a structural framework which in 
turn is fastened to the LDEF tray.  If contamination is not too significant, 
approximately another 25 events larger than 20 mm in diameter will be 
available for analysis.  Furthermore, an additional gold surface 
(approximately 12 by 2.3 by 0.05 cm) will be flown inside the experiment 
exposure control canister used in LDEF experiment S0010 (Exposure of 
Spacecraft Coatings) for optimum calibration of gaseous and particulate 
contamination.
