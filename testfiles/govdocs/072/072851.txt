                    WELCOMING STATEMENT FROM 
            DEPUTY SECRETARY OF COMMERCE DAVID BARRAM

Welcome to the Virtual Conference on Universal Service and Open
Access to the Telecommunications Network.  In hosting this
conference we seek to broaden our reach beyond the physical
limits of any conference room or auditorium.  The NII will tear
down the barriers of time and distance.  This conference, like
the NII itself, is meant to be inclusive and your ideas are
welcome and encouraged.  Your participation will help make it a
success.

This effort is jointly sponsored by the National
Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) and the
Information Infrastructure Task Force (IITF), as part of the
Administration's National Information Infrastructure initiative. 
Through the NII, the Administration is focusing on the ability of
computer mediated communications to enhance the life and work of
every American.  The NII is a harbinger of change, both economic
and political, and holds great promise for the future of America. 
Some benefits of the NII include telecommuting, distance learning
and active life-long education, remote consultations with expert
medical professionals, as well as new forms of art, entertainment
and culture.

This conference continues the dialog started by NTIA's five field
hearings, held over the past nine months in cities throughout
America.  Unlike the field hearings, this conference allows for a
much wider participation, and more in-depth discussion on the
issues.  There are over 80 public access points in 25 states.

With this conference we are hoping to:

    Garner opinions and views on universal telecommunications
     service that may shape the legislative and regulatory
     debate.

    Demonstrate how networking technology can broaden
     participation in the development of government policies,
     specifically, universal service telecommunications policy.

    Illustrate the potential for using the NII to create an
     electronic commons.

    Create a network of individuals and institutions that will
     continue the dialog started by the conference, once the
     formal sponsorship is over.

This conference is an experiment in a new form of dialog among
citizens and with their government.  The conference is not a one-
way, top down approach, it is a conversation.  It holds the
promise of reworking the compact between citizens and their
government.

I thank you once again for your participation.

Subject: Modifying existing Copyright law probably insufficient
To: intellec@virtconf.ntia.doc.gov

It is usually the habit of legislators to modify old law in order
to deal with new problems.  Normally, this is somewhat desirable since
it provides continuity and a degree of predictability.  However, in
the case of fashioning a copyright law that can deal with the
exigencies of the new digital technology, I'm afraid the standard
approach will be like trying to pound square pegs into round holes;
sure it can be done if you pound hard enough, but you normally
end up breaking the frame work.

The basic reason why copyright can no longer operate as it does is
because at its base, it assumes fixation of a work in the physical
realm, subject to all the limitations of physical objects (ie
scarcity and difficulty of transportation).  Physical limitations
play a very small role in the digital transmission of information,
ideas, and the like.  Any limitation based on physical existence
must now be ineffective.  It seems to me that the only way to
protect the economic investment of the copyright holder must be
rigidly limiting to the uses to which a work can be put without
the express consent of the copyright holder if we are to play by
the old rules in a digital age.

Of course, I don't have a comprehensive vision of what the new
regime should look like, but I suspect that, in order to preserve
the rights of both society and the copyright holder, the whole
of copyright law will end up looking like the fair use exception.
But, then again, I suppose I'm falling into the trap of thinking
in the old fashion, but it seems like without the existence of 
the physical product as a limiting factor, all decisions will
have to be based on considerations of the nature of the work and
the use.  

In any case, since my thinking is obviously drifting to the level
of ramblings, my time is running short, I have a desire for feedback
considering my premises before moving forward with them, and since 
I know my reading becomes less careful after the first couple of
pages and I don't expect more from others; I shall pause this 
discussion in the hopes that others have thoughts on the matter.

I operate an information service for a regional educational service agency.
One of the problems we run into is that we access a database and download
the information but are forbidden to resend it digitally or post it to a
bulletin board. We can, however, make print copy with the obligatory source
noted. This hampers our turnaround time.
I recognize that copyright protects the author or owner and it allows them
to profit from their work but it has to be balanced with the need for
information and its distribution.
There are government sources we would like to see online and be FREE. They
slowly are becoming so. But some of the privatized databases are not cheap
to search and a number of libraries public or otherwise can't afford them
economically.
Its a dillema and a very real one for searchers/librarians trying to access
and provide inforamtion.
