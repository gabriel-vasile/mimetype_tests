   LUDWIG STRESSES SUPERVISION AS KEY TO GLASS-STEAGALL REFORM

Comptroller of the Currency Eugene A. Ludwig today urged Congress
to eliminate artificial barriers that restrict competition for
financial services as it considers reform of the Glass-Steagall
Act.  In testimony before the House Committee on Banking and
Financial Services, Ludwig urged increased reliance on regulatory
supervision to assure safety and soundness rather than artificial
restrictions and rigid structures that limit competition.

"Artificial limits and segregation of non-traditional and
innovative products and services do not further safety and
soundness in our complex and increasingly competitive financial
system," said Mr. Ludwig.  Specifically addressing the bill
sponsored by Rep. Leach (H.R. 18), he said his fundamental
concern is that it puts insufficient emphasis on supervision and
relies too heavily on organizational structure and transactional
firewalls to shield institutions from the perceived risks of
expanded financial services activities.

Mr. Ludwig pointed to two aspects of the bill:

    It allows broader securities activities to be conducted by
     banking organizations, but only  through a bank holding
     company affiliate.

    It contains extensive firewalls that separate a bank and its
     securities affiliate to such an extent that it impairs
     reasonable opportunities for synergies. 

Mr. Ludwig said these devices do not deliver the safety and
soundness benefits that are needed.  "We cannot depend on them to
protect the bank in moments of crisis," he said.  "We have a
better alternative.  The combination of effective supervision and
flexible firewalls can deliver safety and soundness we need
without excessive costs."  Mr. Ludwig said that a balance between
prudential safeguards and enhanced activities flexibility,
coupled with sound supervision, is one key principle of
modernization.

"Today, artificial and antiquated barriers and restrictions
impede the ability of banks, securities, firms, and other
financial companies to operate efficiently, to provide the range
of products and services their customers desire, and to fuel
economic growth," said Ludwig.  "Financial services modernization
is more than just an interesting idea.  It will result in better
customer service, more efficient businesses, and a more vital
financial services section for the nation's economy."

                  COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY

                              of the

                 U. S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES


                       February 28, 1995







Statement required by 12 U.S.C.  250:

The views expressed herein are those of the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency and do not necessarily represent the
views of the President.  

     Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, I welcome this
opportunity to discuss H.R. 18, the Financial Services
Competitiveness Act of 1995.  I commend you for so quickly
offering an initiative to modernize our financial services
system.  I also applaud Representative Baker for his thoughtful
proposal.  Today, artificial and antiquated barriers and
restrictions impede the ability of banks, securities firms, and
other financial companies to operate efficiently, to provide the
range of products and services their customers desire, and to
fuel economic growth.  Financial services modernization is more
than just an interesting idea.  It will result in better customer
service, more efficient businesses, and a more vital financial
services sector for the Nation's economy.

     For banks, activities diversification is an essential
complement to the geographic diversification authorized by
Congress last year.  Together, they form the necessary
cornerstones for a vigorous banking system.  Both types of
diversification are needed to ensure that our banks can meet the
needs of their local customers and communities as well as remain
competitive in international financial markets.

     The Secretary of the Treasury has announced several concepts
directed toward legislation in this area.  He will testify
further in this regard shortly.  I support the Secretary's
approach.

     There is much about H.R. 18 that I support.  I nonetheless
have a number of serious concerns, particularly about those
provisions that force banking organizations into rigid structures
that will make them less efficient competitors and less effective
at meeting the needs of their customers.  

                    I.  Maximizing Competition

     Mr. Chairman, we agree on the fundamental reason to reform
our financial services industry.  Allowing banking organizations
to expand their activities will lead to improved, more
convenient, and less costly services for consumers of financial
services-- individuals as well as small and large businesses. 
Competitive financial services markets are the most efficient
financial services markets, and thus the best able to serve and
benefit all customers. 

     The benefits of allowing banks to engage in investment
banking activities will likely show up most clearly on "Main
Street America."  A small- or medium- sized business seeking to
grow may need to move from traditional bank loans to more
sophisticated means of financing, such as the public debt or
equity markets.  Such a business typically develops a close
working relationship with its commercial banker, who may be able
to offer useful perspectives as the business seeks to graduate to
a middle market.  Yet, today, the ability of banks to facilitate
a customer's changing financial needs is limited.  Restrictions
on the activities of commercial banks deprive that customer of
the option to continue to work with a lender knowledgeable about
its business when the customer seeks to access the capital
markets.  The customer is also deprived of the benefits of price
and product competition from banks that would otherwise seek its
business.  The lack of price competition translates into
increased financing costs.  The lack of product competition
limits the availability of innovative financing approaches for
businesses.

     A more troubling result for a business occurs if its
commercial lender cannot serve its evolving financing needs, and
no one else will.  Small businesses often need amounts or types
of financing that nonbank financial institutions have no interest
in providing.  In these situations, the inability of banks to
offer a more comprehensive selection of financing forces some
small- and medium-sized firms to perpetuate inappropriate
financing arrangements.  By harnessing the credit knowledge of
the banking system, financial modernization promises these
businesses broader access to capital markets.    

     Increased competition could have benefits for states and
municipalities as well.  At a time when all levels of government
are trying to save money yet preserve essential services, we
should offer state and local authorities the benefits of more
effective price competition.  We have known of these benefits for
many years.  A 1968 study issued by the Office of the Comptroller
of the Currency demonstrated this point clearly.  {Wm Paul Smith,
Commercial Bank Entry Into Revenue Bond Underwriting: 
Competitive Impact and Public Benefits (Washington, D.C.:  U. S.
Treasury Department, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,
1968).]  H.R. 18 recognizes this benefit in its provisions
allowing greater authority for national banks to underwrite
revenue bonds.  But I would urge more flexibility in this matter
than H.R. 18 provides.  Specifically, I would allow national
banks to underwrite municipal revenue bonds--as they are today
allowed to underwrite municipal general obligation bonds--
regardless of whether the bank has a securities affiliate.

     In addition, the increased competition provided by banks in
these markets will both lower costs to customers and increase (or
in some instances create) access to the capital markets for
larger businesses.  [Samuel L. Hayes III, A. Michael Spence, and

     Market access--whether by way of securitization, access to
the commercial paper market, or underwriting revenue bonds--will
spur economic development.  The economic boost that competition
in this area provides will translate into increased jobs and will
deepen and strengthen our capital markets.

     However, I say all of this with one important caveat.  None
of these benefits will materialize unless new entrants can
compete effectively.  It is not enough to allow a bank to
undertake new activities if, in so doing, we impose so many
unnecessary regulatory burdens that we lose the benefits of
diversification.  If we dismantle the Glass-Steagall wall, we
must not leave so much regulatory barbed wire in its place that
we defeat our objectives.

     This leads me to two fundamental concerns about H.R. 18. 
First, the bill rigidly compartmentalizes new activities to
address safety and soundness concerns.  I believe effective
safety and soundness oversight requires a more flexible
supervisory approach.  While any new financial activity entails
risk, we must recognize that safety and soundness can increase
when banks realize efficiencies from affiliations with other
financial services firms.

     Second, H.R. 18 shifts new financial services
activities--and even some traditional ones--from banks and their
subsidiaries to holding company affiliates.  Safety and soundness
considerations do not require this surgery.  It will leave banks
atrophied, dependent on affiliate life-support systems.  The
long-term health of the economy and the banking system depends on
banks' ability to remain strong and innovative financial services
providers in their own right.  

               II.  Preserving Safety and Soundness

     My first concern with H.R. 18 is that the bill relies too
heavily on organizational structure and transactional firewalls
as supervisory devices to shield institutions from the perceived
risks of expanded financial services activities.  The bill allows
broader securities activities to be conducted by banking
organizations, but (with one exception) only through a bank
holding company affiliate.  It prohibits other structural
options, potentially more efficient or better suited to a
particular banking organization, such as the use of bank
subsidiaries.  

     In addition, if banks wish to take advantage of this new
opportunity to engage in broader securities activities, they must
discontinue activities that are customary, profitable, and that
have not been the basis for safety and soundness concerns.  For
example, a bank could no longer securitize and sell its loans. 
It could no longer participate in financial market innovations
because it would be barred from underwriting and dealing in any
securities other than those listed by statute.  And banks would
have to discontinue their private placement services for
institutional customers.   

     H.R. 18 also contains extensive firewalls that would
separate a bank and its securities affiliate to such an extent
that it may preclude reasonable opportunities for synergies. 
These restrictions in many cases would disadvantage a bank
securities affiliate relative to an unrelated third party
securities firm, placing banking organizations at a competitive
disadvantage.  

     Let me make two further points about relying on
organizational structure to limit risk and protect bank
customers.  First, these devices, as contemplated in H.R. 18,
will not deliver the safety and soundness benefits that we need. 
We cannot depend on them to protect the bank in moments of
crisis.  In fact, because they are a source of unnecessary costs,
they may actually detract from safety and soundness.  Second, we
have a materially better alternative.  A combination of effective
supervision and adaptable firewalls can deliver the safety and
soundness we need, without excessive costs.      

     Proponents of the corporate structure approach argue that it
promises safety and soundness by insulating the bank from risk. 
But corporate structure may fail to deliver the insulation from
risk that it promises in theory.  Experience teaches that the
location of an entity in a banking organization's corporate
structure, i.e., whether it is a subsidiary of the holding
company or of the bank, does not matter when a banking
organization decides whether to support its affiliates and
maintain its public reputation.  For example, where customers or
creditors are aware of the relationship between a holding company
subsidiary and a bank--and it is highly unlikely sophisticated
customers would not be- -it is questionable whether a holding
company will feel free to walk away from a troubled affiliate,
since doing so could hurt the reputation of the bank itself.  In
the 1970s several large bank holding companies bailed out their
failing real estate investment trust affiliates.  Just last year,
several holding companies came to the rescue of troubled
affiliated money market mutual funds. 

      Proponents of firewalls also contend they are necessary to
prevent affiliates from making unlimited draws on the bank's
capital and from taking advantage of their affiliates' customers. 
When applied to certain kinds of activities, these firewalls,
along the lines of Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve
Act, and separate capital requirements can play a useful role in
reducing a bank's exposure to risk, protecting against conflicts
of interest, and preventing consumer abuses.  But we must be
realistic about their shortcomings.  
     
     By far the most crucial shortcoming concerns the effects of
overly rigid firewalls on the potential benefits of permitting
banking organizations to engage in nontraditional activities. 
Unduly stringent restrictions could eliminate many of the
incentives that motivate banks to enter new activities. 
Therefore, it would be a mistake to legislatively mandate
extensive, detailed, and inflexible firewalls, particularly to
broad categories of activities.  Rather, supervisors need
authority to adapt firewalls to specific activities the conduct
of which entail the greatest risks.  

     For example, it would not, in our view, be appropriate to
apply substantial new restrictions because a bank, bank
subsidiary, or bank affiliate begins to underwrite state and
municipal revenue bonds.  Banks have underwritten state and
municipal general obligation bonds for years, without ill
effects.  Why then, should substantial new restrictions be
applied when those activities are expanded to include revenue
bond underwriting?  On the other hand, regulators should be able
to provide meaningful firewalls for other activities, such as
some or all aspects of property and casualty insurance
underwriting.   

     In contrast to a careful and targeted use of firewalls, the
structure H.R. 18 mandates for conducting new activities and
operational restrictions are blunt instruments that I fear would
undermine key benefits of financial services modernization.  If
we want a healthy, modern banking system, regulators must have
the flexibility to adopt modern approaches to supervision. 

     Given the widespread doubts regarding the efficacy of
structural separateness and the costs involved in establishing a
holding company structure, proponents of restricting new
activities to holding company affiliates should bear the burden
of demonstrating that the holding company structure is the most
effective approach to safety and soundness.  Otherwise, the
market should be free to make its own structural choices to
maximize operational efficiency and minimize risk.

     Fortunately, we need not depend upon statutorily mandated
structural devices to protect against risk.  Let me describe the
supervisory alternative.  In determining whether a banking
organization should conduct a particular new activity, the bank
regulator must focus not only on the specific activity but also
on the nature of the bank's current activities and on how the
bank intends to integrate the new business into its operations. 
We must be certain the activity is appropriately supervised both
by the bank and by its regulator.  Relying on supervision,
combined with corporate restrictions that fit the specific
situations, is superior to relying on mere structural
constraints.  It allows regulators to tailor the risk management,
in light of economic conditions, to the peculiar risks presented
by new activities as they are conducted by a particular bank. 
One-size-fits-all structural constraints and rigid firewalls add
nothing to such supervision, and they add little protection in
crises. 
  
      Placing the emphasis on a combination of supervision and
appropriate corporate safeguards is important because it allows
us to adopt the kind of management that is necessary for a
particular activity conducted in a particular manner.  Moreover,
supervision and risk control systems, including modeling and
stress testing, have improved and become more sophisticated over
time and have adapted to the constantly changing ways in which
even the same activities are conducted.  As banks develop new
products, and new ways to synthesize risks, the regulator can
adapt its supervisory practices to marketplace developments.  

     Therefore, safety and soundness depends on more than just
risk insulation, and is independent of corporate structure.  It
is fundamentally determined by how an activity is conducted, how
risks are managed, and how an institution is supervised.  No
matter what corporate structure is in place, strong and effective
supervision- -which includes appropriate treatment of capital to
limit the exposure of the insured institution, and hands-on
examination--is crucial to keeping risk in check and protecting
the safety and soundness of the banking system and the deposit
insurance fund.  

       III.  Structural Choices and Safety and Soundness

     My second concern is that H.R. 18's imbalance in favor of
activities conducted in holding company affiliates instead of in
bank subsidiaries could increase risk and sap the vitality of our
banking system.  Limiting activities can make banks riskier for
several reasons.  

     First, limiting activities deprives banks of the safety and
soundness benefits of diversification.  By putting all of their
eggs in one basket, it leaves them prey to the vagaries of one
market, one set of risks.

     Second, limiting activities will prevent banks from evolving
beyond a narrow market segment, impairing their ability to
continue to do a safe and profitable business.  External market
forces such as the advent of diverse debt markets and increased
competition from non- bank providers have dramatically shortened
the reach and profitability of traditional banking activities,
chiefly lending, over the past thirty years.  

     Third, limiting activities will cause banks to continue to
lose their better customers, making even their traditional
activities less safe.  As competitors rush to develop new
products, to learn about the risks of these offerings, and to
compete aggressively for bank customers, banks and their
subsidiaries will need the ability to provide products to respond
to market demands.  Accordingly, there should be a strong
presumption in favor of allowing new activities to be conducted
by bank subsidiaries as well as holding company affiliates where
the particular activities do not materially increase the risk of
the bank.  

     The long-term viability of our banking system depends upon
the ability of banks (directly and through their own
subsidiaries) to be strong and competitive financial services
providers in their own right.  Key to that result is that banking
organizations have reasonable choices regarding the most
efficient corporate structure for conducting business.  Unless
compelled by reasons of safety and soundness--which I do not
believe is the case for securities, insurance, and many other
financial activities--banking organizations should be allowed to
innovate, either through holding company affiliates or bank
subsidiaries, as they and the market--not the government--deem
appropriate.

     Artificial limits and segregation of non-traditional and
innovative products and services do not further safety and
soundness in our complex and increasingly competitive financial
system.  Forcing innovation and new product development to occur
outside of a bank and its subsidiaries, restricting banks to a
very narrow range of familiar activities, would ill-serve the
banking system and the Nation's consumers.

     Empirical evidence suggests that non-traditional financial
activities need not threaten bank safety and soundness.  In this
regard, let me offer several observations.  First, U.S. banks,
through foreign branches and subsidiaries, as well as holding
company affiliates, have successfully engaged in a variety of
non-traditional activities abroad for many years.  The authority
for this is longstanding.  

     Second, banks in most G-10 countries have been engaging in a
broad range of financial services activities, including the
activities specifically referred to in H.R. 18, for many years. 
Again, no empirical evidence indicates that engaging in these
activities has threatened the safety and soundness of these
institutions.  [The failure of Barings over the past weekend
arose from unauthorized derivatives activities.  Derivatives
activities are within the scope of activities currently
permissible for both U.S. and foreign banks and accordingly are
not the kind of new activity at issue in Glass-Steagall reform.] 
On the contrary, foreign bank supervisors have told me that
income from non-traditional activities has been a key support to
the safety and soundness of certain banks during periods of
financial stress.  

     Third, there is no support for the premise that a bank would
bear more risk holding municipal revenue bonds (or other types of
securities), for a matter of hours, as part of an underwriting,
than it does today when it holds government securities or
municipal general obligation bonds, for a matter of hours, in
connection with currently permissible bank underwriting
activities.  Common sense suggests that neither of those market
risks is necessarily greater than making and holding a long- term
commercial loan.  

     Finally, the risks to banks from insurance activities are
generally no greater than those presented by commercial lending. 
U.S. banks have offered a variety of insurance services to their
customers for many years.  They already sell all types of
insurance in towns with populations of less than 5,000.  They
underwrite and sell municipal bond, credit life, accident, and
health insurance nationwide. 

     Recent research also lends support to the conclusion that
commercial and investment banking can be combined safely. 
Scholars have found that the Glass-Steagall Act's separation of
commercial and investment banking was not justified either on
safety and soundness grounds or as a response to documented
problems.  In fact, banks with securities affiliates failed less
frequently than other banks.  A path-breaking 1986 study by
Eugene White of Rutgers University found no convincing historical
evidence that any of the 9,000 banks that failed between 1930 and
1933 did so as a result of their investment banking activities.
[E. White, "Before the Glass- Steagall Act:  An Analysis of the
Investment Banking Activities of National Banks." Explorations in
Economic History (January 1986).]  It seems the separation
between commercial and investment banking largely reflected the
continued faith of legislators and regulators in the
now-discredited Real Bills Doctrine, which held that making
short-term loans for productive purposes and secured by real
goods was the only appropriate lending activity for commercial
banks.  The immediate impetus for passage of the Act came from a
serious misdiagnosis of the causes of the banking collapse in the
1930s, together with widespread public resentment toward bankers
involved in underwriting and distributing corporate securities. 

     Another recent study found that the securities underwritten
by commercial banks in the years 1921-1933, far from being unduly
speculative, tended to be higher in quality than those
underwritten by investment banks.  [Randall Kroszner and Raghuram
Rajan, "Is the Glass- Steagall Act Justified?  A Study of the
U.S. Experience with Universal Banking Before 1933." American
Economic Review.  84 (September 1994).]  A detailed study of the
hearings preceding passage of the Glass-Steagall Act by George
Benston of Emory University found little concrete evidence of the
alleged abuses by commercial banks' securities affiliates.
[George J. Benston, The Separation of Commercial and Investment
Banking. (New York:  Oxford University Press, 1990).]

     In sum, H.R. 18 represents an opportunity to enhance the
safety and soundness of banks.  But the ability of banks to seize
that opportunity will depend upon the extent to which they can
diversify without inefficient and costly structural and
supervisory impediments.

                    IV.  Banking and Commerce

     You have asked me to comment on the issues involved in
permitting commercial firms to own banks.  The line between
banking and commerce is unclear.  Various products and services
have attributes of both commerce and banking.  Changes in the
economy, particularly in the field of technology will further
blur the line between banking and commerce.  For example,
computer programming and information management are now widely
acknowledged to be integral to the provision of financial
services, even though twenty-five years ago they seemed to be
more like pure commercial activities.

     Concerns about the consequences of combining banking with
pure commercial activities date back to the establishment of the
Bank of England, and have included worries about conflicts of
interest, excessive market power, and undue risk-taking that
might adversely affect depositors, or further threaten the
stability and efficiency of the financial system.  In the United
States, state bank charters have traditionally restricted the
powers of banks to engage in such commercial activities.  The
National Bank Act and the Bank Holding Company Act continue these
restrictions for national banks and nonbank affiliates.

     Nonetheless, American financial history contains many
examples of banks owned by, or otherwise affiliated with,
commercial and manufacturing enterprises.  The Bank Holding
Company Act Amendments of 1970, ended many, but not all, of all
those affiliations.  Those combinations of banking and commerce
did not occasion particular problems or abuses, although many of
them involved highly specialized circumstances.

     Clearly, the health and competitiveness of U.S. banking may
at some time come to depend on our willingness to modify or
dismantle this separation.  But further expansion by banking
organizations into financial activities offers benefits that are
greater and more immediate, and poses risks that are better
understood than those associated with combining banking and
commerce.  At this time, therefore, I would urge that we focus
our attention on the universe of financial activities.

                          V.  Conclusion

     Any reform proposal must embody three key principles if we
are to achieve the full benefits of financial services
modernization.  First, any new approach must maintain the safety
and soundness of the banking system.  This requires a balance
between prudential safeguards and enhanced activities
flexibility, coupled with sound supervision.  It does not require
presumptions or prohibitions against bank entry into new
activities. 

     Second, a new system should encourage healthy competition
and efficient business operations to benefit all consumers of
financial services--in all of our communities--and thereby
facilitate economic growth.  The elimination of artificial
barriers to entry and antiquated restrictions on corporate
structures is essential to this goal.  Like other businesses,
banks should have substantial freedom to choose the
organizational form that best enables them to respond to
marketplace demands, absent compelling public policy reasons to
limit that freedom.

     Third, regulation--and regulators--must be botheffective and
efficient.  They must not impose unnecessary burdens.  In other
words, we should not limit the efficiencies resulting from
modernization by placing constraints on what activities banks may
conduct and how they may conduct them, unless those constraints
are clearly necessary to assure safety and soundness or to
protect consumers or investors.
  
     In conclusion, I would like to emphasize the importance of
these hearings and once again commend your leadership in this
area.  Absent reform, increasingly competitive world financial
markets would imperil the long-term profitability and stability
of our banks.  Facing up to these issues by reconsidering archaic
and counterproductive product restrictions, by removing
unnecessary impediments on corporate structure, and by relying on
strong supervision of diversified financial firms is, I am
convinced, both a wise and necessary course of action.
