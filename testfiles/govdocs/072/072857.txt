        Charge: The Executive Committee is responsible for making (or
	approving) major scientific and technical decisions of the
	collaboration. It should be representative of the collaboration as a
	whole as much as possible, but the primary requirement is that it
	possesses sufficient experience and wisdom to guide the collaboration.
	Nine members are elected by the Institutional Board for 3-year terms.
	The following are ex-officio members of the ExCom: the Co-Spokespeople,
        the Deputy Spokesperson, the IB Chair, the MINOS Financial Officer and

     5. MINOS Financial Officer: Gina Rameika 
	Charge: The MINOS Financial Officer (MFO) develops MOUs and SOWs
	between MINOS institutions and Fermilab and also administers the
	MINOS Common Fund. The MFO manages the MINOS operations budget on a
	day-to-day basis and prepares operations budget requests to the

	Co-spokespersons. The MFO is appointed by the Co-Spokespersons for
        an indefinite term.

     6. MINOS Authorship and Publications Committee (MAP)
        MAP administers the approval of refereed papers, physics results,
	conference submissions and the MINOS collaboration author list.
        MAP consists of the Co-Spokespeople, the IB chair and the elected
	members of the Executive Committee. The membership of MAP is currently
	identical with the membership of the ExCom. MAP will elect a
	Chairperson, a Deputy Chair and a Technical Paper Coordinator.
        Chair: Jenny Thomas; Technical Paper Coordinator: Alec Habig.

     7. Young MINOS Group (YMG)
        The YMG consists of Collaboration members who are typically graduate
	students or on their first postdoctoral position. The involvement of
	undergraduates and more senior post-doctoral collaborators is also
	welcome. The YMG nominates an IB observer, an ExCom member and a senior
	adviser ("Czar") annually. For 2008, the IB observer is Tobi Raufer,
	the ExCom member is Jeff Hartnell and the YMG Czar is Rob Plunkett.

     8. FarDet Operations Manager: Rik Gran
        Charge: Plan, coordinate, schedule and oversee the various data
	acquisition runs at Soudan. Collect requests from Level 2 Managers and
	the analysis and computing coordinators, and compile lists of data to
	be taken on a weekly basis. Consult with the Soudan DAQ Coordinator,
	Data Quality Tsarevitch, the online DAQ and offline analysis groups to
	coordinate these data acquisition runs with detector maintenance and
	calibration activities. Develop procedures to ensure the integrity of
	data runs and their availability to users. The Soudan Run Coordinator
        is appointed by the MINOS Co-Spokespersons.

     9. MINOS Accelerator Issues Coordinator (MIAC): Rob Plunkett
        Charge: The MIAC is responsible for day-to-day data taking activities,
	oversight of data validation and interactions with Fermilab related to

	activities and interactions with Fermilab regarding the Proton Plan.
        The MIAC is appointed by the Co-Spokespersons for a temporary term,
	until late spring, 2006.
	
    10. Analysis Coordinator: Jim Musser (2009)
        Deputy Coordinator: Karol Lang(2009)
        Charge: The Analysis Coordinator is responsible for coordinating the
	MINOS data processing and data analysis activities. The Analysis
	Coordinators are appointed by the Co-Spokespersons for 2-year terms.
	The Deputy Analysis Coordinator usually becomes the Coordinator at the
        end of the Coordinator's term. The Analysis Coordinators and the
	Co-Spokespersons constitute the MINOS Physics Oversight Group (MIPOG),
	which meets regularly the guide the overall analysis process. The
	Analysis Coordinators and the analysis working group conveners
	constitute the MINOS All Conveners Meeting (MIACoM), which meets
	regularly to coordinate the activities of the analysis groups. 

    11. MINOS Run Coordinator: Bob Zwaska
        Charge: Coordinate day-to-day operation of MINOS detectors with

	public talks about MINOS. Specifically, it is charged with:
	a) Giving MINOS appropriate visibility by actively seeking to have
	   MINOS talks at conferences, workshops and other public fora.
	b) Identifying appropriate speakers for those occasions.
	c) Assuring appropriate and wide distribution of talks, with special
	   emphasis on giving young people adequate credit and exposure.

	    Jeff Hartnell (numubar)
	    Brian Rebel (NC)
        Charge: Examine scenarios for future MINOS running and sensitivities to
	guide collaboration discussions of near-term (2010-11) and longer term
	planning. Consider the ultimate sensitivities for measurements with
	neutrinos and antineutrinos under various running conditions. Provide a
	final report with recommendations in October 2008.

       
    15. MINOS Coordinating Committee for Outreach Activities (MICCO):
           Maury Goodman
           Alec Habig

	   Sacha Kopp
	   Peter Litchfield
	   Bill Miller (co-chair)
	   Jeff Nelson
	   Charlie Peck
	   George Tzanakos
	Charge: Provide the Collaboration with input to various outreach
	activities that are related to the NuMI-MINOS program. Facilitate,
	coordinate, guide, stimulate and publicize the Collaboration's outreach
	activities. In addition, MICCO serves as the interface between the
	Collaboration and external parties (e.g., Fermilab, the Minnesota DNR)
	in all areas related to outreach activities.  The focus of these
	outreach activities is to provide information about MINOS and
	high energy physics to the public, and to interact with educators
	to improve the quality of science education.  It is expected that
	different outreach activities will be performed by different working
	groups, which have non-MINOS members and which have some activities
	not related to MINOS.  The relationship of MICCO to these working
	groups is not rigidly defined.  MICCO is a MINOS committee, reporting
	to the Collaboration through the Spokesperson. MICCO members and chair
	are appointed for three year renewable terms by the Spokesperson with
	advice from the Executive Committee.

    16. Physics Analysis Working Groups and Technical Issue Coordinators.
        Charge: Analysis working group co-conveners and technical issues
	coordinators (listed below) are responsible for organizing the work
	of their groups and providing intellectual leadership and coordination
	of work among working groups. Starting with the September 2006
	reorganization, the co-conveners and coordinators are appointed (or
	reappointed) by the Co-Spokespersons for nominal two-year terms, with
	the next change of appointments taking place on December 31, 2007. It
        is expected that appointments will rotate among different Collaboration
	members as the work evolves.

    16. Blessed Plot organization and responsibilities. [TO BE UPDATED]
        The MINOS Co-Spokespersons have established the following organization
        for producing and/or collecting plots and pictures that are approved
	for use in public presentations and making them readily accessible to
	the Collaboration. The individuals identified here are responsible for
	ensuring that blessed plots meet basic criteria for quality,
        uniformity, clarity and readability. Responsibility for approval of
        the physics content of plots rests with the MAP Committee.
        Specific individuals from the Physics Analysis and Technical Issues
	Working Groups are identified as Blessed Plot Coordinators and Deputy
	Coordinators for each of the four types of plots listed below. The
	Coordinators provide oversight and guidance, and appoint Deputy
	Coordinators who have direct responsibility for maintenance of the
	Blessed Plot files. Coordinators are also responsible for submitting
        candidate plots to the MAP Committee for approval.
	a. Physics plots. Coordinators of the CC, NC, Nu_e, NearDet Non-osc,
	   FarDet Non-Osc and Atmospheric Neutrino working groups act as
	   Blessed Plot Coordinators for their respective groups and appoint
	   specific individuals from each working group to serve as Deputy
	   Coordinators.
	b. Beam performance.
	   Blessed Plot Coordinators: Beam Systematics WG Coordinators,
	   Deputy Coordinator: Mary Bishai.
	c. Detector performance (non-physics aspects).
	   Blessed Plot Coordinator: Gina Rameika,
	   Deputy Coordinator: Niki Saoulidou.
	d. CalDet plots. Blessed CalDet plots will be organized as a library
	   of relevant plots that demonstrate detector performance. 
	   Blessed Plot Coordinators: Karol Lang, Jenny Thomas
	   Deputy Coordinator: TBD
        The Deputy Coordinators are responsible for resolving any issues that
        arise among different types of Blessed Plots.
