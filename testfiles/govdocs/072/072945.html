<p> <font size="2">6. Technical Abstract (Limit 200 words) </font></p>
<p><font size="2">It is well known that light and other electromagnetic radiation 
  can exert pressure on matter, which is the basis for photon sail propulsion. 
  Less well known is that light can also exert controlled torque and in-plane 
  tension on sails that have suitable electromagnetic properties. Although these 
  effects are potentially effective aids to deployment and remote control of gossamer 
  spacecraft, they have not been investigated either analytically or experimentally. 
  This project shall investigate these effects with the goal of developing materials, 
  design tools, and gossamer spacecraft control strategies. Phase 1 will analyze 
  the thrust, tension, and torque produced when polarized electromagnetic radiation 
  interacts with anisotropic sails. Experiments will be performed on tailored 
  carbon microtruss sails using an ultra-sensitive vacuum torsion wire technique 
  to directly measure low-power microwave radiation pressure and torque. Advanced 
  sail designs will be drafted and applications to gossamer spacecraft control 
  will be assessed. Phase 2 would further develop the technology, including numerical 
  and analytical methods, carbon sail processing, and ground testing in vacuum 
  at low power. Concepts for experiments in microgravity (parabolic flight) and 
  at higher power will be developed.</font></p>

<p><font size="2"> The proposed sails offer novel flight control for sails and 
  gossamer spacecraft. The potential exists to provide long-term attitude control 
  for gossamer spacecraft without consumption of on-board fuel, which would greatly 
  reduce the cost of launching and maintaining earth-orbiting satellites. The 
  development may be useful for control of space interferometer spacecraft that 
  require precision formation. The carbon materials also have application to lightweight 
  large-area microwave spacecraft antennas as well as wireless handsets with novel 
  directional and polarization-sensitive properties. </font></p>
