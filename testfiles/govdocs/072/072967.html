We need new materials, designs         and solutions,&#148; said Artur Chmielewski, manager of JPL Space Inflatables         Technology. &#147;We need very light, powerful telescopes that can peer         deep into the cosmos and look for Earth-like planets around other stars.&#148;         <br>        <br>        An important step in the technology development process is space testing         of prototype inflatable systems. A past test program of inflatable technology,         the Inflatable Antenna Experiment, deployed by the Space Shuttle Endeavour         in 1996, provided significant data on the performance of inflatable systems.         The 14-meter inflatable antenna was deployed and inflated for several         hours in space. This successful demonstration of a tennis court-size inflatable         structure in space has generated a lot of interest in the use of this         promising new technology. Now, scientists are planning on-orbit tests         to develop the technology further. <br>        <br>        One of the first space applications of gossamer technology will be the         Advanced Radio Interferometry between Space and Earth (ARISE) mission,         which will use a high-resolution imaging technique called the space-based         Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI). An orbiting 25-meter (82-foot)         inflatable radio telescope will be used in conjunction with ground telescopes         to take pictures of space phenomena, such as neighborhoods around black         holes, with a resolution 3,000 times better than that offered by the Hubble         Space Telescope. <br>        <br>        Innovators such as JPL&#146;s Dr. Mark Dragovan say that inflatable technology         is the wave of the future. &#147;Lightweight, flexible, inflatable materials         will someday replace traditional steel and glass materials on space antennas         and telescopes to the point that the whole telescope will consist of a         reflector and detector as thin as plastic kitchen wrap,&#148; he said.         &#147;The challenge for NASA is to launch structures that are one hundred         times lower density than the Hubble Space Telescope. If the telescope         is extremely low-mass, then one can make it very large and inexpensive         in our quest to put big eyes in the sky.&#148; <br>        <br>        Inflatables have a major advantage over mechanical structures because         even in the most modern telescopes, hundreds of pounds of steel and glass         support a very thin reflecting surface that does all the work in collecting         light from the cosmos. The alternative to these massive structures is         inflatables, which are often 10 times less expensive, can be tightly packed         into small canisters, and are lower mass, allowing launches on smaller,         cheaper rockets. <br>        <br>        The space applications for antennas many times the size of today's mechanical         orbiting antennas include satellites for deep space and mobile communications,         Earth observations, astronomical observations, and space-based radar.         Solar-powered sails thinner than human hair for propelling spacecraft         to the stars, sunshades the size of a soccer field for space telescopes,         inflatable habitats for the moon or Mars, and 24-meter antennas that can         be held by one hand are all possible, according to scientists at JPL.         <br>        <br>        Future work on inflatables will concentrate on the areas of materials         research, development of optical-quality telescopes, and huge solar sail         structures. <br>        <br>        The Gossamer Spacecraft Initiative is managed jointly by JPL and NASA         Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. NASA&#146;s Office of Space         Science in Washington, DC, has overall program management responsibility.         </font></p>      <hr>      <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i><br>      For more information, contact Artur B.
