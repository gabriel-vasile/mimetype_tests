 Space Shuttle Discovery is hurled through a gossamer sky after launch
 
today on mission STS-96. Lifting off at 6:49:42 a.m. EDT, the crew of
 
seven begin a 10-day logistics and resupply mission for the
 
International Space Station. Discovery carries about 4,000 pounds of
 
supplies, to be stored aboard the station for use by future crews,
 
including laptop computers, cameras, tools, spare parts, and
 
clothing. The mission also includes such payloads as a Russian crane,
 
the Strela; a U.S.-built crane; the Spacehab Oceaneering Space System
 
Box (SHOSS), a logistics items carrier; and STARSHINE, a
 
student-involved experiment. It will include a space walk to attach
 
the cranes to the outside of the ISS for use in future
 
construction. Landing is expected at the SLF on June 6 about 1:58
 
a.m. EDT.
