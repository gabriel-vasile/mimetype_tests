<p>Civil Air Patrol’s 60<sup>th</sup> Anniversary Gala was held at the
Smithsonian Air &amp; Space Museum, Washington DC. The evening started out with
a reception held for the 400 plus guest in the 2<sup>nd</sup> floor Pioneers<b>
of Flight </b>gallery, surrounded by Lockheed’s 5 Vega, and 8 Sirius, the
Gossamer Condor and other famous aircraft. Music, in the style of Glenn Miller,
was played by musicians dressed in World War II Army Air Corps uniforms that had
been provided by Roger Thiel.</p>
<p>And then came the call to ‘take your seats’ at a formal sit down dinner
which was held in the <b>Milestones of Flight </b>gallery. The tables were
arranged under a spectacular canopy which included the Wright<i> 1903 Flyer,
Lindbergh’s Spirit of St Louis, Bell’s XP-59A Airacomet and X-1 Glamorous
Glennis</i>, North American’s X-15, Sputnik 1, Explorer 1, and Mariner 2. The
cornerstones of space flight were there as well: Mercury Friendship 7, Gemini
IV, the Apollo 11 Command Module &quot;<i>Columbia</i>&quot; and the Viking
Lander, Pioneer 10.</p>
<p>The guest list included an impressive array of CAP’s and the US Air Forces
movers and shakers, past and present. The evening started with the singing of
&quot;God Bless America&quot; by New York City Policeman Daniel Rodriguez: the
same magnificent a cappella rendition that also opened the 2001 World Series,
the Super bowl, and the 2002 Salt Lake City, Utah Olympics. The room vibrated as
he sang, and when he finished he was given a standing ovation.</p>
<p>Thus began what was to become the most memorable, and probably historical,
event that I have ever attended.</p>
<p>The presentation of the colors was by the highly polished Langley Cadet
Squadron Color Guard, followed by Daniel Rodriguez singing our National Anthem.
He too sang a cappella, an extremely moving performance both visually and
aurally that sent chills up my spine and tears to my eyes. As the attendees
began to sing along with him, the feeling of pride in being American was almost
palpable in the room. The ovation was deafening.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The opening remarks by Gen John R. Dailey, USMC (Ret) Director, National Air
&amp; Space Museum, and CAP’s National Commander Brigadier General Richard L.
Bowling set the theme of history, dedication, respect and responsibility.</p>
<p>The Master of Ceremonies CMS Roy Boudreaux (Ret) introduced the list of
distinguished visitors, from the Military, the Government and of course CAP. One
was Colonel Leo K. Thorsness, USAF (Ret) a Medal of Honor recipient.</p>
<p>The Keynote speaker was A. Scott Crossfield, a long time CAP member, whose
moving speech reflected on CAP’s 60 years of unwavering service to America,
first in wartime and continuing through peace time, along the way producing
leaders of today, a measure of pride, and the unshakeable spirit of ‘can do,
will do’.</p>
<p>Recognition was given to the following &quot;Subchasers&quot; <i>Martin
Miller (CP3), Cliff Bowes (CP7), Jack Robinson (CP2), Glen Cook (CP2), Maury
Betchen (CP2), Luverne Kraemer (CP3) </i>and <i>Buddy Harris (CP6)</i>, who were
each presented models of a pre war Stinson 10A’s painted in yellow with CAP
WW2 markings: a fitting memento of CAP service and the night’s events. (CP =
Coastal Patrol Base)</p>
<p>The USAF Singing Sergeants provided entertainment. Three young ladies, Chief
Master Sergeant Patricia Wolfe, Master Sergeant Robin Askew, and Technical
Sergeant Amy Dolan, all dressed in USAAF WW2 uniforms sang a medley of Andrew
Sister’s hits, along with some individual performances emulating Francis
Langford and Jo Stafford. They finished with a rousing rendition of God Bless
America--with full audience participation.</p>
<p>Each and every guest was presented the Louis E. Keefer book <u>From Maine to
Mexico</u>, a book about America’s Private Pilots in the Fight against Nazi
U-Boats: a gift from CAP and the CAP Historical Foundation.</p>
<p>It was an evening and an experience I’ll never forget….</p>
<p>Happy belated Birthday old friend, and many many more…</p>
