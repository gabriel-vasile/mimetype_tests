COMETARY KNOTS AROUND A DYING STAR

These gigantic, tadpole-shaped objects are probably the result 
of a dying star's last gasps. Dubbed "cometary knots" because 
their glowing heads and gossamer tails resemble comets, the 
gaseous objects probably were formed during a star's final 
stages of life.

Hubble astronomer C. Robert O'Dell and graduate student 
Kerry P. Handron of Rice University in Houston, Texas discovered 
thousands of these knots with the Hubble Space Telescope while 
exploring the Helix nebula, the closest planetary nebula to Earth at 
450 light-years away in the constellation Aquarius. Although 
ground-based telescopes have revealed such objects, astronomers 
have never seen so many of  them. The most visible knots all lie 
along the inner edge of the doomed star's ring, trillions of miles 
away from the star's nucleus. Although these gaseous knots 
appear small, they're actually huge. Each gaseous head is at 
least twice the size of our solar system; each tail stretches for 
100 billion miles, about 1,000 times the distance between the
Earth and the Sun. Astronomers theorize that the doomed star 
spews hot, lower-density gas from its surface, which collides with 
cooler, higher-density gas that had been ejected 10,000 years before. 
The crash fragments the smooth cloud surrounding the star into 
smaller, denser finger-like droplets, like dripping paint.
 
This image was taken in August, 1994 with Hubble's Wide Field 
Planetary Camera 2.  The red light depicts nitrogen emission 
([NII] 6584A); green, hydrogen (H-alpha, 6563A); and blue, 
oxygen (5007A).
