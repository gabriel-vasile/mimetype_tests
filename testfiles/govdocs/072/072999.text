                                        Jupiter's Main Ring and Halo

The top and bottom panels show a mosaic of images of Jupiter's rings 
taken by NASA's Galileo spacecraft.  Jupiter is to the right of this 
mosaic, and different brightness scales accent different parts of the 
ring system.  Jupiter's ring system has three parts -- a flat main 
ring; a halo inside the main ring shaped like a double-convex lens; 
and the gossamer ring outside the main ring.  
In the top view, a faint mist of particles is seen above and below 
the main rings.  This vertically extended "halo" is unusual in 
planetary rings, and is caused by electromagnetic forces pushing the 
smallest grains, which carry electric charges, out of the ring plane. 

Jupiter's main ring is a thin sheet of material encircling the 
planet.  The near and far arms of this  ring extend horizontally 
across the mosaic, joining together at the ring's ansa, the portion 
visible on the sides of Jupiter, on the figure's far left side.  In 
the bottom view, some radial structure is visible across the ring's 
ansa.  The diffuse innermost boundary begins at approximately 122,500 
kilometers (about 76,100 miles).  The main ring's outer radius is at 
about 128,940 kilometers (80,120 miles), very close to the orbit of 
the Jovian moon Adrastea (128,980 kilometers or 80,140 miles).  The 
brightness of the main ring drops markedly at about 127,850 
kilometers (79,440 miles), very near the orbit of another moon, 
Metis, at 127,978 kilometers (79,521 miles).  Jupiter's four small 
satellites-Metis, Adrastea, Amalthea and Thebe, affect the structure 
of the huge planet's tenuous rings. 

These images were taken through the clear filter of Galileo's onboard 
solid state imaging camera system on November 9, 1996.  The 
resolution is approximately 24 kilometers (14 miles) per picture 
element along Jupiter's rings.  Because the spacecraft was only about 
0.5 degrees above the ring plane, the image is highly foreshortened 
vertically.  The images were obtained when Galileo was in Jupiter's 
shadow, peering back toward the Sun, when the ring was approximately 
2.3 million kilometers (1.4 million miles) away.  The view of Earth's 
moon in the explanatory graphics was created from images returned by 
the Clementine lunar orbiter, launched in 1994 by NASA and the 
Ballistic Missile Defense Organization.)
