BOREAS RSS-03 Imagery and Snapshots from a Helicopter-Mounted Video Camera 

Summary

The BOREAS RSS-03 team collected helicopter-based video coverage of forested 
sites acquired during BOREAS as well as single-frame "snapshots" processed to 
still images.  Helicopter data used in this analysis were collected during all 
three 1994 IFCs (24-May to 16-Jun, 19-Jul to 10-Aug, and 30-Aug to 19-Sep), at 
numerous tower and auxiliary sites in both the NSA and the SSA.  The VHS-camera 
observations correspond to other coincident helicopter measurements.  The field 
of view of the camera is unknown.  The video tapes are in both VHS and Beta 
format.  The still images are stored in JPEG format.

Note:  An extensive helicopter log is available for each IFC.  Environmental, 
technical, instrumental, and operational conditions are noted for each 
observation where applicable.  It is strongly recommended that any researcher 
doing extended work with this data set obtain a copy of the helicopter log.

1. Data Set Overview

1.1 Data Set Identification

BOREAS RSS-03 Imagery and Snapshots from a Helicopter-Mounted Video Camera 

1.2 Data Set Introduction

The Remote Sensing Science (RSS)-03 helicopter-based video data set was compiled 
during the BOReal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS) 1994 Intensive Field 
Campaigns (IFCs) with a color VHS video camera mounted on a helicopter platform.  
Video imagery was taken from the helicopter platform at BOREAS sites 
simultaneous with radiometric ground measurements and sunphotometer measurements 
from the same platform.  The instrumentation used was designed and developed at 
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Goddard Space Flight 
Center (GSFC). The data were collected during the green-up, peak, and senescent 
stages of the growing season at numerous tower and auxiliary sites in both the 
Northern Study Area (NSA) and the Southern Study Area (SSA).  The images were 
taken during the following periods: 

     31-May-1994 to 10-Jun-1994 (IFC-1)
     21-Jul-1994 to 08-Aug-1994 (IFC-2)
     06-Sep-1994 to 16-Sep-1994 (IFC-3)

Multiple observations were captured from the video at sites where the cover 
changed significantly during the scan time; this was determined subjectively by 
the operator.

1.3 Objective/Purpose

The study objective was to acquire multispectral, bidirectional reflectance, and 
surface temperature data of the study sites for assessments of spectral, 
spatial, and temporal variability, and the impacts of these variabilities on 
vegetation indices.  A helicopter with a pointable, stabilized mount was used to 
carry a spectrometer (visible and near-infrared), spectroradiometer, infrared 
thermometer, video camera, and a sun tracking photometer.

1.4 Summary of Parameters

Helicopter-based VHS video photographs of tower and auxiliary sites during all 
three IFCs in 1994. Video observations were captured while onboard devices were 
in operation over sites.

1.5 Discussion

The video imagery was taken to capture visual conditions at the site during data 
collection that could then later be referred to as necessary when processing the 
data to aid in the quality assessment of the data.

3. Theory of Measurements

The video imagery was taken to capture visual conditions at the site during data 
collection that could then later be referred to as necessary when processing the 
data to aid in the quality assessment.  Two video cameras are used in the 
system.  One video camera is bore-sighted with the main instruments on the 
pointable platform, and the other is next to the 70-mm photographic camera set 
to view nadir only.  Video data are fed through a time and date video generator 
to superimpose month, day, year, and system clock time on the video tape frames.  

4. Equipment

4.1 Sensor/Instrument Description

Color Video System.  The color video system consists of Charge-Coupled Device 
(CCD)-based color video cameras connected to a stereo-audio VCR.  During IFC-1 
and IFC-2, the VCR was a Beta format unit that had been used with the helicopter 
system since the mid-1980s.  Beta format was originally chosen over VHS to take 
advantage of its higher video image resolution.  Prior to IFC-3, an industrial-
quality Super-VHS unit was installed and used for the rest of the experiment. 

The image is then displayed on a 14-inch color screen in the center instrument 
rack.  Images from the nadir-only viewing camera are fed directly to a small 
color screen located on the pilot's instrument panel and then to a selector 
switch.  The selector switch allows the back-seat instrument operators to view 
either the images from the bore-sighted video camera or the pilot's video 
camera.  The bore-sighted camera provides feedback to the instrument operator 
when pointing the instrument package, and the nadir camera image is used by the 
pilot while positioning the helicopter during hovers.  During IFC-1, a video 
camera with an operator-controlled electronic zoom and focus system with a was 
used.  During IFC-2 and IFC-3, this lens was replaced with the same type of lens 
used with the nadir-looking camera.  These lenses had a manual focus and a 20- 
to 80-mm zoom range, which was set at 30 to 35 mm.

The stereo audio tracks of the VCR are used for an additional data record. One 
track is used to record an audible tone that is generated each time the 
instruments are triggered.  The other audio track records the cabin intercom 
conversations among the aircrew.

4.1.1 Collection Environment

In general, the helicopter was flown during relatively clear days when possible.  
Data collection was attempted during conditions of highest possible solar 
elevation.  All observations were attempted from a nadir observation point and 
usually at 300 m above ground level (AGL).  Exceptions are noted in the 
helicopter log. 

4.1.2 Source/Platform

A Bell UH-1H "Iroquois" helicopter, operated by the NASA's Wallops Flight 
Facility (WFF) was used as the airborne platform during BOREAS.  This particular 
aircraft, call number N415, was built in 1965 and was acquired by WFF in 1993.  
Upon acquisition, the aircraft was slightly modified for use as a scientific 
platform. 

Helicopter N415 operates with standard or low-mount, rear-leaning skids.  The 
engine is a Lycoming T53/L13, which provides 1,400 shaft HP with 1,290 
transmission HP.  The fuel capacity provides 2.0 hours flying time with a 20-
minute fuel reserve under normal modes of operation.  The addition of an 
auxiliary fuel tank in the port-side door crewman's position provided an 
additional 15 minutes of flight time during BOREAS given optimum flight 
conditions.  The weight of the entire helicopter system with full 
instrumentation, full fuel, and crew members was 9,500 lbs.

4.1.3 Source/Platform Mission Objectives 

The video imagery was collected to capture site conditions at a fine spatial 
resolution during data collection that could then later be referred to as 
necessary when processing the data and to aid in the quality assessment of the 
data.

4.1.4 Key Variables

Video imagery.

4.1.5 Principles of Operation

The system is configured for multiple sensor data collection.  The Modular 
Multiband Radiometer (MMR), Spectron Engineering spectroradiometer (SE-590), 
infrared thermometer, autotracking sunphotometer, and video sensor were the 
primary payload during BOREAS.  The video camera was run continuously during 
data collection.

4.1.6 Sensor/Instrument Measurement Geometry

4.1.7 Manufacturer of Sensor/Instrument

Unknown.

4.2 Calibration

5. Data Acquisition Methods

The NASA GSFC/WFF helicopter-based optical remote sensing system was deployed to 
acquire canopy multispectral data while hovering approximately 300 meters AGL 
(Walthall et al., 1996).  A VHS color video camera was in operation during all 
data collection flights.  The field of view (FOV) of the lens is unknown.  
Images are not calibrated.  However, the images provide an overhead view of the 
tower and auxiliary sites with fine spatial resolution.  A visual record of 
conditions at the time of the spectral data collection can assist in analysis. 

The video snapshots were generated on a Power Macintosh PC 8500/220 using a VHS 
video player and Avid VideoShop 3.0.2.  The images were then converted from PICT 
format to JPEG for universal accessibility.

7.2.3 Temporal Resolution

Measurements were collected as conditions permitted during each IFC.  Each site 
was visited as often as possible during each IFC, with priority given to tower 
flux sites and category 1 auxiliary sites.  Helicopter flight time was limited 
to approximately 2 hours by fuel constraints.  As many sites as possible were 
visited during each flight.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Minimum Data Value -- The minimum value found in the column.
Maximum Data Value -- The maximum value found in the column.
Missng Data Value  -- The value that indicates missing data. This is used to
                      indicate that an attempt was made to determine the
                      parameter value, but the attempt was unsuccessful.
Unrel Data Value   -- The value that indicates unreliable data.  This is used
                      to indicate an attempt was made to determine the
                      parameter value, but the value was deemed to be
                      unreliable by the analysis personnel.
Below Detect Limit -- The value that indicates parameter values below the
                      instruments detection limits.  This is used to
                      indicate that an attempt was made to determine the
                      parameter value, but the analysis personnel determined
                      that the parameter value was below the detection
                      limit of the instrumentation.
Data Not Cllctd    -- This value indicates that no attempt was made to
                      determine the parameter value.  This usually
                      indicates that BORIS combined several similar but
                      not identical data sets into the same data base table
                      but this particular science team did not
                      measure that parameter.

Blank -- Indicates that blank spaces are used to denote that type of value.
N/A   -- Indicates that the value is not applicable to the respective column.
None  -- Indicates that no values of that sort were found in the column.

8. Data Organization

8.1 Data Granularity

The smallest unit of information for the video tapes is one video tape.  The 
smallest unit of data for the still images is a single image.

8.2 Data Format(s)

The video tapes are stored in Beta and/or VHS format.  The still images are 
stored in JPEG image files that are named with the date when and site where the 
imagery was acquired.

The Compact Disk-Read-Only Memory (CD-ROM) file of video tape inventory 
information contains American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) 
numerical and character fields of varying length separated by commas. The 
character fields are enclosed with single apostrophe marks. There are no spaces 
between the fields.

Each data file on the CD-ROM has four header lines of Hyper-Text Markup Language 
(HTML) code at the top.  When viewed with a Web browser, this code displays 
header information (data set title, location, date, acknowledgments, etc.) and a 
series of HTML links to associated data files and related data sets. Line 5 of 
each data file is a list of the column names, and line 6 and following lines 
contain the actual data.
