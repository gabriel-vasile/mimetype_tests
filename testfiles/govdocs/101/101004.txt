1. Data Set Overview

1.1 Data Set Identification

BOREAS TE-06 Biomass and Foliage Area Data

1.2 Data Set Introduction

Biomass, sapwood volume, and Leaf Area Index (LAI) estimates were conducted at 
the BOReal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS) Southern Study Area (SSA) and 
Northern Study Area (NSA) during the growing seasons of 1994 and 1995 as part of 
an effort by  the Terrestrial Ecology (TE)-06 team to develop carbon budgets for 
various Canadian boreal forest types.  The biomass of a forest provides 
information on the amount of carbon sequestered by a given forest type over the 
stand history and thereby provides information regarding its successional status 
and functional characteristics. LAI provides information on the area of 
photosynthesizing material within a forest.  Sapwood volume can be used to 
estimate stem respiration.  The biomass data are reported in kg carbon/ha, the 
LAI is reported in m2 of leaf area/m2  of ground based on needle hemisurface area 
(Chen et al., 1997) for conifer sites, and sapwood volume estimates are in m3 of 
sapwood/m2 of ground.  All estimates were derived from plots located at each 
site and allometric equations.  Understory biomass estimates for the Tower Flux 
(TF) and Carbon Evaluation (CEV) sites are also provided.

1.3 Objective/Purpose

The purpose of this work was to quantify the standing biomass, sapwood volume, 
and LAI for the TF, CEV, and Auxiliary (AUX) sites and the forest floor for the 
TF and CEV sites.

1.4 Summary of Parameters

The data records include measurements of stem biomass, sapwood volume, foliage 
biomass, understory biomass, and LAI.

1.5 Discussion

Biomass, sapwood volume, and LAI are important, if not defining, characteristics 
of forests.  These variables not only indicate the past growth of a forest, but 
also are key variables for models that describe the exchange of heat, energy, 
carbon dioxide, and water between the forest and the atmosphere as well as for 
models that describe the forest's biogeochemical cycle.

To determine the biomass, sapwood volume, and LAI for each of the TF, CEV, and 
AUX sites, diameter measurements were made for variable radius and fixed area 
plots.  Allometric equations that use the diameter as the independent variable 
were developed to predict biomass (i.e., stem, branch, foliage), sapwood volume, 
and leaf area for each tree within the plot.  Based on the plot size or the 
variable radius factor used, each tree in a plot represented a number of other 
trees per hectare (Dilworth and Bell, 1979), and this 'scaling factor' was then 
used to scale all biomass and leaf area estimates to the hectare.   Allometric 
equations were developed for the dominant overstory species (Pinus banksiana, 
Populus tremuloides, Picea mariana, Picea glauca) at each TF site and some CEV 
sites from a harvest in August 1994.  A complete description of the development 
of the allometry equations is provided in the TE-06 Allemetry Documentation.  
Equations for Alnus crispa were developed from an allometry harvest in August 
1995. The allometric equations for Populus tremuloides were used for Populus 
balsamifera, Salix  sp., and Betula papyrifera, while equations for Larix 
laricina are from Kloeppel and Vogel (unpublished data), contact J.G. Vogel for 
information.  Biomass equations for Abies balsamea were from Singh (1986).

Biomass, sapwood volume, and LAI estimates for the TF and CEV sites are of good 
quality because they were derived from site-specific allometric equations.  Some 
of the AUX site foliage biomass and LAI estimates suffered from not being 
derived from site-specific allometric equations, and some estimates were 
excluded from the data set for this reason.   Sapwood volume estimates were not 
provided for the AUX sites.  From a spatial perspective, the tower site plots 
were located in areas that approximated the forest within the Wind Aligned Blob 
(WAB), while the CEV and AUX plots were located to describe the forest within a 
30 x 30 m area.  The WAB was the area around a flux tower where most of the 
measured fluxes originated.  During BOREAS, access to this area was limited to 
prevent contamination of flux measurements.

3. Theory of Measurements

The amount of biomass and leaf area produced by a plant is the net result of 
photosynthesis.  The use of allometric equations that are based on a subsample 
of trees to predict biomass, sapwood volume, and LAI for the forest overall is a 
common practice.  Fairly accurate total or stem biomass estimates can often be 
made using generalized equations; however, site-specific equations yield the 
best estimates for foliage mass and leaf.

5. Data Acquisition Methods

Plots were established using a either a 10 BAF prism or a measuring tape.  The 
diameter of each tree was measured at  diameter at breast height (DBH) 1.37 m.  
At a number of sites, tree diameters were measured at the base (10 cm) to better 
facilitate accurate biomass estimates; these sites are marked by (&) in the data 
sets. One site, G2L7S, had trees measured both at the base and at DBH.  The 
diameter measured from each tree was then used in an allometric equation to 
determine biomass, leaf area, etc. for each tree.  

The AUX sites measured at the base are listed below:

Understory vegetation was sampled from a 2 x 2 or 1 x 1 m subplot that was
randomly located in each of the plots. The subplot size varied depending on 
plant density. All vegetation in the plot was clipped and stored in a cold room 
(3 °C) until processed.  Samples were separated into three categories: 
ephemeral, new foliage and twig from perennial plants, and old foliage and twig 
from perennial plants.  Samples were dried and weighed to the nearest 0.1 g.

7. Data Description

7.1 Spatial Characteristics

7.1.1 Spatial Coverage

Four replicate plots were established immediately outside the footprint of the 
tower.  The plots were located in areas that reasonably represented the 
vegetation within the WAB and should provide accurate stand-level descriptions. 
The WAB was the area around a flux tower where most of the measured fluxes 
originated.  During BOREAS, access to this area was limited to prevent 
contamination of flux measurements. The plot size varied from 7.5 x 7.5 m to 30 
x 30 m depending upon tree density.  The number of trees per plot ranged from 60 
to 120.  The CEV and AUX sites were sampled to describe the biomass within a 30 
x 30 meter area.

9. Data Manipulations

9.1 Formulae

Tree biomass was calculated from a diameter measurement and an allometric 
equation, and then scaled to the hectare level using a plot scaling factor that 
reflects the tree's representative size in relation to the plot size (Dilworth 
and Bell, 1979).  Allometric equations are generally developed on a log-log 
basis to correct for nonhomogeneous variance (see TE-06 Allometry 
Documentation).

Biomass by component:                                                        (1)
(Kg/hemisurface area) = (INVLOG(a + b (LOG (diameter)))) * PLOT SCALING FACTOR 

Where a (the slope) and b (the y intercept) are in the equation y=a(x)+b.

10. Errors

10.1 Sources of Error

The greatest potential source of error other researchers need to be aware of for 
the TF sites is not from our data collection or calculation, but rather from 
differences in vegetation between where other researchers may have worked and 
where we located our plots.  Researchers should contact Tom Gower if they feel 
plot location may be affecting any corroboration between their and our 
estimates.  A second error that may affect the agreement between the numbers 
provided here and the numbers found by other researchers for the TF sites are 
differences in dates between the time of DBH measurement (October 1993) and the 
time the allometric equations were developed (August 1994).  This error had the 
greatest effect on the foliage biomass and leaf area measurements, although it 
is likely small in either case.

For the auxiliary sites, difficulty surrounding the efficacy of non-site-
specific allometric equations in estimating LAI and foliage biomass is a problem 
for a number of sites.  Estimating overstory biomass from non-site-specific 
equations for wood and branch biomass is problematic when the diameters of the 
trees measured are smaller or larger than the diameters of the trees that were 
harvested to develop the allometric equation.  For this reason, in plots where 
there were trees larger or smaller than the trees harvested for the allometric 
equation, only the total biomass is reported.

10.2 Quality Assessment

The data provided are of generally good quality with the above considerations 
taken into account.

10.2.1 Data Validation by Source

It is not possible to validate the data without developing new allometric 
equations and/or installing new plots.  A check was performed using published 
allometric equations, and there was generally good agreement for total biomass 
(<10%) at all sites, but poor agreement for foliage mass and LAI, which is not 
unexpected.  Because of the paucity of sapwood volume equations in the 
literature, this variable was not checked.

10.2.2 Confidence Level/Accuracy Judgment

Confidence level for the tower sites is high for the data submitted and
slightly less so for some auxiliary sites.  Researchers should note Section 
10.1.

10.2.3 Measurement Error for Parameters

Not applicable.

10.2.4 Additional Quality Assessments

Not applicable.

10.2.5 Data Verification by Data Center

Data were examined for general consistency and clarity.

11. Notes

None.

11.1 Limitations of the Data

The AUX biomass, LAI, and sapwood volume estimates are limited to the 30 x 30 m 
area surrounding their location.

11.2 Known Problems with the Data

See Section 10.1.
