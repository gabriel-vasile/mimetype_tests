<section id="H08C654D032B64BC3B40724C100DD16B"><enum>2.</enum><header>Findings</header><text display-inline="no-display-inline">Congress finds the following:</text> 
<paragraph id="H12FF0412F6F0437ABF47E8C1F17167AB"><enum>(1)</enum><text>A major barrier to sharing information among police, firefighters, and others who may be called on to respond to terrorist attacks and other large-scale emergencies is the lack of interoperable communications systems, which can enable public safety agencies to talk to one another and share important, sometimes critical, information in an emergency.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="HCC4E7FD851AA47B3A4BDC87F99B76A1"><enum>(2)</enum><text>Communications interoperability has been identified by the Department of Homeland Security as 1 of the most essential capabilities necessary for first responders to achieve the national preparedness goal the Department of Homeland Security has established for the Nation.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H2D608AF1A09646748D00939D92B94075"><enum>(3)</enum><text>The lack of interoperability costs lives during terrorist attacks or natural disasters, but also during everyday emergency operations.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="HC76DE92150EB482E9B71534FBE00B12D"><enum>(4)</enum><text>Achieving interoperability is difficult because some 50,000 local agencies typically make independent decisions about communications systems. This lack of coordination also dramatically increases the cost of public safety communications to Federal, State, local, and tribal governments.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H6642693BFA2C45E487763374AB2EF5DB"><enum>(5)</enum><text>Achieving the level of communications interoperability that is needed will require an unprecedented level of coordination and cooperation among Federal, State, local, and tribal public safety agencies. Establishing multidisciplinary, cross-jurisdictional governance structures to achieve the necessary level of collaboration is essential to accomplishing this goal.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="HCC551E99582F4769AB0007CFBF2D1000"><enum>(6)</enum><text>The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 requires the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with other Federal officials, to establish a program to ensure public safety interoperable communications at all levels of government.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H4A344B57F64B4D29A9B3CEC72BE8B32D"><enum>(7)</enum><text>However, much more remains to be done. For example, in January 2005, the National Governors Association reported that while achieving interoperability ranked as the top priority for States, obtaining the equipment and technology to fulfill this goal remains a challenge. The large majority of States report that they have not yet achieved interoperability in their States.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="HC308D5F90408404EA4AEBB713B72BF14"><enum>(8)</enum><text>Over 70 percent of public safety communications equipment is still analog, rather than digital. In fact, much of the communications equipment used by emergency responders is outdated and incompatible, which inhibits communication between State and local governments and between neighboring local jurisdictions. Additional grant funding would facilitate the acquisition of new technology to enable interoperability.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H8F8A0F02FEA841EA9EBC4C19CF404950"><enum>(9)</enum><text>Stronger and more effective national, statewide, and regional leadership are required to improve interoperability. The Department of Homeland Security must provide national leadership by conducting nationwide outreach to each State, fostering the development of regional leadership, and providing substantial technical assistance to State, local, and tribal public safety officials, while more effectively utilizing grant programs that fund interoperable equipment and systems.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H9FB4DC71B9AC4B568100FAA214F58177"><enum>(10)</enum><text>The Department of Homeland Security must implement pilot programs and fund and conduct research to develop and promote adoption of next-generation solutions for public safety communications. The Department of Homeland Security must also further develop its own internal expertise to enable it to better lead national interoperability efforts and to provide technically sound advice to State and local officials.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H7D4F611D443A41568508CFFA33C456BB"><enum>(11)</enum><text>Communications interoperability can be accomplished at a much lower cost if strong national leadership drives cooperation and adoption of smart, new technology solutions.</text></paragraph></section>
