                               [Docket No. 23-87] 
 
                                  52 FR 41599 
 
                                October 29, 1987 
 
 
Foreign-Trade Zone 141, Monroe County, NY: Rochester Customs Port of Entry; 
Application for Subzone; Kodak Manufacturing Facilities 
 
TEXT: An application has been submitted to the Foreign-Trade Zones Board (the
Board) by the County of Monroe, State of New York, grantee of FTZ 141, 
requesting special-purpose subzone status for the manufacturing and 
distribution facilities (10 sites) of the Eastman Kodak Company (Kodak) in 
the Rochester area. The application was submitted pursuant to the provisions
of the Foreign-Trade Zones Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 81a-81u), and the 
regulations of the Board (15 CFR Part 400). It was formally filed on 
October 19, 1987.  
 
   Kodak is a major multi-national manufacturer of film, imaging and 
information management equipment, chemicals and life science products. Its
sales in 1986 amounted to $12 billion, 35 percent of which were overseas. 
The company has manufacturing facilities in eight states and in eight 
countries, and it sells its products in 150 countries. Its headquarters and
largest manufacturing facilities are in the Rochester area. 
 
   Kodak's Rochester facilities involved in this application cover 10 sites
(3,200 acres) in the Counties of Monroe, Ontario, and Wayne, where some 
43,000 persons are employed. Site 1, Kodak Park (2,134 acres), is the 
company's main manufacturing and distribution center. It is located along 
I-390 and Ridgeway Avenue, in the communities of Rochester, Greece, and 
Gates, New York. The other sites are: Site 2, Kodak Park Irondequoit (17 
acres), 2200 North Goodman Street, Irondequoit; Site 3, Kodak Park G (20 
acres), 460 Buffalo Road, Rochester; Site 4, Elmgrove Plant (750 acres), 
Elmgrove Road, Gates; Site 5, Hawk-eye Plant (14 acres), Paul Street/Avenue 
E, Rochester; Site 6, C Building (9 acres), Carlson Road, Rochester; Site 7,
Sayette Technology Division (12,000 square feet), 1133 Mount Read Boulevard,
Rochester; Site 8, Beta Physics Division (12 acres), Routes 5 and 20, East 
Bloomfield; Site 9, Videk Division (13 acres), Route 332 and Collett Road, 
Farmington; and, Site 10, Ultra Technologies Division (217 acres), Highway
88/Silverhill Road, Newark. 
 
   The facilities produce and distribute over 30,000 products in the five 
product categories listed below. Within each category, the company sources
numerous components abroad, some from its own plants. List under each 
category are examples of the items that are or could be sourced abroad. 
 
   1. Photographic Film, Paper and Chemicals (duty rates 0-8.5 percent). 
Materials include gelatin, silver bullion, pulp, paper, acenaphthene, 
alkylbenzenes, 4-chlororesoranol, thio salicylic acid, hydrobromic acid, 
lithium compounds, and selium (duty rates 0-17.3 percent). 
 
   2. Photographic/Video Cameras, Equipment and Supplies (duty rates 
2.0-9.0 percent). Components include parts, lenses, fans, electrical 
equipment, and photographic/video equipment parts (duty rates 3.7-7.0 
percent).  
 
   3. Copiers, Office Machines, and Computer Equipment (duty rates 3.7-3.9 
percent). Components include wiring harnesses, transformers, switches, 
regulators, displays, keyboards, disk drives, printers, lenses, circuit 
boards, motors, and other electrical parts (duty rates 2.4-7.0 percent).
 
   4. Medical Instruments and Equipment (duty rates 2.1-10.0 percent). 
Components include lenses, circuit boards, electrical components, and 
medical equipment parts (duty rates 2.1-10.0 percent). 
 
   5. Life Science Chemicals (duty rates 0-16 percent). Materials include 
enzymes, vitamins, amino acids, flavors and components thereof (duty rates
0-16 percent).  

   Zone procedures would allow Kodak to avoid Customs duty payments on 
foreign materials used in its exports. On its domestic sales, the company
would be able to defer duty payments and, in some cases, to take advantage
of the same duty rate available to importers of finished merchandise. The 
application indicates that the savings will help improve the company's 
international competitiveness.   

   In accordance with the Board's regulations, an examiners committee has
been appointed to investigate the application and report to the Board. The
committee consists of: Dennis Puccinelli (Chairman), Foreign-Trade Zones 
Staff, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, D.C. 20230; Edward A. 
Goggin, Assistant Regional Commissioner, U.S. Customs Service, Northeast 
Region, 100 Summer Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02110; and Colonel Daniel 
R. Clark, District Engineer, U.S. Army Engineer District Buffalo, 1776 
Niagra Street, Buffalo, New York 14207. 
 
   Comments concerning the proposed foreign-trade subzone are invited in 
writing from interested parties. They should be addressed to the Board's
Executive Secretary at the address below and postmarked on or before 
December 11, 1987.   

   A copy of the application and accompanying exhibits will be available 
for public inspection at each of the following locations: 
 
 
U.S. Department of Commerce District Office, 
Rochester Branch, 
121 East Avenue,
