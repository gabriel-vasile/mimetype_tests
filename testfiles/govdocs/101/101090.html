<p><font size="3">Methods for the X-ray fluorescence
spectrometric analysis of 11 elements in coal ash (Na, Mg, Al,
Si, P, S, K, Ca, Ti, Mn, and Fe) and of two elements in whole
coal (Cl and P) are described. Coal-ash samples are fused with
lithium tetraborate to produce glass disks; whole-coal samples
are briquetted with a cellulose binder prior to analysis.
Calibration for all elements in both whole coal and coal ash is
accomplished by using a simple linear regression of X-ray
intensity versus concentration. Silicate rock standards are used
for calibration in coal ash analysis, and whole-coal analyses are
based on coal standards from the National Bureau of Standards
(NBS), on coals analyzed by independent methods, and on synthetic
standards. Precision, expressed as the relative standard
deviation, is 2 to 5 percent for coal ash and 10 percent for
determinations of elements in the whole coal.</font></p>

<p><a name="2"><font size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></a></p>

<p><font size="3">X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometry is a
rapid technique for accurate and precise elemental analysis of
solid and liquid specimens. As such, it is suited to the
determination of certain important elements that occur in coal
and has been used extensively for the analysis of both whole coal
and coal ash (Kuhn and others, 1975; Giauque and others, 1979;
Mills and others, 1981; Wheeler, 1983). In practice, most XRF
spectrometer systems are not able to detect elements having
atomic numbers lower than 11, the atomic number of sodium. Thus,
concentrations of the most abundant elements in the coal matrix
(C, H, N, and O) must be determined by other methods.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">In general, the accuracy of XRF spectrometric
determinations of inorganic elements depends on concentration,
particle size, matrix effects, surface roughness, the quality of
standard materials, and other related factors. The accuracy of
analysis usually falls between 2 and 10 percent (relative)
depending on how well these factors have been controlled. The
lower limit of determination is as low as 1 m g/g for elements
having atomic numbers greater than 26, the atomic number of iron,
and ranges to several hundred micrograms per gram for aluminum
and silicon and to several thousand micrograms per gram for
sodium. The upper limits for quantitative XRF spectrometric
analysis are determined by the availability of standard reference
materials.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">This section describes procedures for the
analysis of 2 minor elements (Cl and P) in whole-coal samples,
and 11 major elements (Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, K, Ca, Ti, Mn, and
Fe) in the corresponding high-temperature (525° C) coal ash.</font></p>

<p><a name="5"><font size="3"><b>Coal Ash</b></font></a></p>

<p><font size="3">Because coal ash represents the dominant
mineral portion of coal, XRF spectrometric analysis of this
material is very similar to the XRF analysis of silicate rocks
(Rose and others, 1963; Norrish and Hutton, 1969). Samples are
prepared by fusion with lithium tetraborate flux, and silicate
rock standards are used to construct calibration curves for each
element. Extensive matrix correction techniques are not required
because of the almost eightfold dilution of the sample by the
flux. Fusion is the preferred method of preparation because it
eliminates particle-size effects and mineralogical heterogeneity
and thus allows for the highest precision possible.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">A sample is prepared by thoroughly mixing 600
mg of coal ash with 5.400 g of lithium tetraborate in a Pt-Au
crucible (95 percent Pt and 5 percent Au). To this mixture is
added 5 drops of a 15-percent hydrobromic acid solution, which
acts as a nonwetting agent during the fusion. Samples are fused
for 20 min by a commercial fluxer (Claisse<sup>R</sup>) that
produces a temperature in the range of 1,100 to 1,200° C.
Alternatively, samples may be fused for 1 h at 1,100° C by a
U.S. Geological Survey &quot;in-furnace&quot; device (Taggart and
Wahlberg, 1980a), and finally cast in Pt-Au molds (Taggart and
Wahlberg, 1980b) to produce glass disks. Caution is advised here.
Preliminary evidence indicates that the higher temperature
effected by the Meeker burner in the Claisse<sup>R</sup> fluxer
may volatilize sodium from certain samples during the fusion
process.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">A Diano<sup>R</sup> model XRD-8300
wavelength-dispersive XRF (WDXRF) spectrometer is used to make
all intensity measurements; instrumental parameters and operating
conditions are listed in </font><a href="table11.htm"><font size="3">table 11</font></a><font size="3">.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Calibration of the instrument consists of
plotting X-ray intensity versus concentration of the standard
reference materials for each element and calculating slope and
intercept through simple linear regression analysis. Silicate
rock standards are used for every element except sulfur because
of their availability and similarity to the composition of most
coal ashes. The ranges of concentration (Abbey, 1983) covered by
these reference materials for 10 elements (excluding sulfur) are
listed in </font><a href="table12.htm"><font size="3">table 12</font></a><font size="3">. Results from a typical calibration for iron are shown
in </font><a href="table13.htm"><font size="3">table 13</font></a><font size="3"> in the form of accepted and calculated concentrations
generated by the simple linear regression model.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Because many coal ashes contain much higher
levels of sulfur than do the available reference materials, the
preparation of separate standards for use in determining sulfur
is necessary. To prepare these standards, a typical rock standard
is spiked with sulfur and diluted in steps with the unspiked
material to produce a set of secondary standards covering the
intended concentration range. The mixture is fused with lithium
tetraborate flux, and sulfur in the product is determined by an
independent method (LECO<sup>R</sup> sulfur analyzer) because
some sulfur is lost during the fusion process.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The sulfur reference standards used for this
work were produced by spiking U.S. Geological Survey basalt BIR-1
with ignited calcium sulfate. Serial dilutions of this mixture
with BIR-1 were made to cover the concentration range of 0.1 to
10 percent sulfur. Samples were prepared in duplicate, and one of
each was crushed, ground, and analyzed by a LECO<sup>R</sup>
sulfur analyzer. Calibration for sulfur is accomplished in the
same way as the calibrations for other elements.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The XRF spectrometric determinations of major
elements in coal ash compare well with other analytical methods.
Because the chemistry (or at least the range of composition of
the major elements) of coal ash is similar to that of silicate
rocks, the accuracy is approximately the same. This accuracy is
estimated to be ±2 to 5 percent (relative error) depending on
the element and the concentrationn level.</font></p>

<p><a name="6"><font size="3"><b>Whole Coal</b></font></a></p>

<p><font size="3">One advantage of analyzing whole coal is that
volatile elements normally lost in ashing or fusion can be
determined. The analysis of whole coal may include practically
any element, at concentrations approaching 1 m g/g for many. One
problem, however, is that calibration standards for XRF
spectrometric analysis of whole coal must themselves be whole
coals. Only a few coal standards exist, and these are certified
for only a few elements. Thus, additional reference materials
must be established by analysis of existing coals by other
methods or by preparation of synthetic standards.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Specimen preparation normally involves grinding
a coal sample with a binder, followed by compression to form a
briquette. A low weight-ratio of sample to binder is used because
the XRF spectrometric analysis of whole coal usually involves the
determination of certain trace elements for which the best
possible detection limits are desired. This section describes
procedures used in the determination of phosphorus and chlorine
in whole coal. Similar procedures could be used for the
determination of other elements.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Air-dried coal samples (80 mesh) to be prepared
for XRF analysis are further dried for three hours at 105° C.
Then, 0.500 g of coal is mixed with an equal portion of
microgranular cellulose that serves as a binder. The mixture is
transferred to a 26-mL polystyrene vial containing two
6-mm-diameter polycarbonate beads (to aid mixing) and is shaken
on a mixer-mill for 10 min to ensure homogeneity. This mixture is
pressed against an equal volume of fibrous cellulose (to provide
a strong backing) in a hydraulic press at 276 MPa (40,000 psi)
for 30 s to produce a 2.54-cm-diameter briquette.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Measurements are made by a Diano<sup>R</sup>
model XRD-8300 WDXRF spectrometer; instrumental operating
conditions are listed in </font><a href="table14.htm"><font size="3">table 14</font></a><font size="3">.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Standards used for the determination of
chlorine and phosphorus in whole coal include three NBS reference
materials, coals that have been analyzed by other methods, and
synthetic standards. The NBS coal standards include NBS 1633,
1633a, and 1635. NBS 1633 is no longer available, and NBS 1632b
has only recently become available. The NBS coals are used in
determinations of both chlorine and phosphorus; concentration
values are taken from Germani and others (1980) and from Ondov
and others (1975) because the concentrations of these elements
are not certified by NBS.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Standards for the determination of chlorine in
whole coal consist of a set of coals from three power plants.
These coals were analyzed by instrumental neutron activation
analysis (R.B. Finkelman, written commun., 1980) for 18 elements,
including chlorine. A second set of five coals was the subject of
an American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) cooperative
program investigating XRF analysis of whole coals (ASTM
D.05.29.02); although the coal samples were not intended to be
distributed as standards, they were extensively analyzed by a
variety of methods for the 10 major elements and phosphorus.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Finally, when the available standard reference
material is not sufficient to meet analytical needs, it is
possible to produce synthetic standards. The use of synthetic
standards is the least desirable alternative because of the
uncertainty in the composition of the final product due to
preparation error and the considerable time and effort required
to produce such material.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Phosphorus standards can be produced by
thoroughly mixing a sample with a known concentration of
phosphorus (for example, NBS 120a, a phosphate rock standard) or
a pure compound (Na<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>) with
spectrographically pure graphite and then diluting this mixture
in steps to give a series of samples that define the
concentration range needed. These samples are then mixed with
cellulose and briquetted as described previously.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Likewise, chlorine standards are prepared by
spiking graphite with a substance such as sodium chloride and
then diluting the mixture with graphite in steps to produce a
series of standards. Standards for other elements can be prepared
in a similar fashion.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Calibration for each element is accomplished by
plotting concentration and intensity for all the available
standards and calculating slope and intercept by a simple linear
regression analysis. Results from a typical calibration for
phosphorus are shown in </font><a href="table15.htm"><font size="3">table 15</font></a><font size="3">, where accepted and
calculated concentrations are given. (The standards Syn-C through
Syn-H were prepared synthetically, as described in the text.
RM-120 through RM-124 were analyzed by other methods. The value
for NBS 1632 is from Ondov and others (1975), and the value for
NBS 1632a is from Germani and others (1980).) Although
mathematical correction for absorption and enhancement by the
other matrix elements may improve results (because minimal
dilution is used), in practice, such corrections are difficult to
accomplish because of the lack of well-characterized standards.
Most matrix correction algorithms require that concentrations for
all major and minor elements for the standards be known.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Precision is determined by the sample
preparation, instrument stability, and counting time and is
generally in the 1- to 2-percent range. Because of the lack of
appropriate standard reference materials and because of the
uncertainty associated with those materials that are being used
as reference standards in the calibrations, assessment of the
accuracy of the chlorine and phosphorus determinations is
difficult. In addition, there are no other methods for
determining either of these two elements now in routine use at
the U.S. Geological Survey to provide values for comparison.
However, based on the few primary standards available, we
estimate the relative precision of the method to be approximately
10 percent.</font></p>

<hr>

<p><a name="7"><font size="3"><b>CONCLUSIONS</b></font></a></p>

<p><font size="3">Methods based on XRF spectrometry are capable
of determining 11 inorganic elements in coal, providing relative
precision and accuracy of 2 to 5 percent for the determination of
sulfur and major oxides in coal ash, and 10 percent for the
determinations of chlorine and phosphorus in whole coal. The most
important factor limiting the accuracy of analysis is the
restricted availability of standard reference materials. Another
significant factor that affects accuracy is that many coal
samples not stored in a cool, dry, inert atmosphere decompose
over time and, consequently, are subject to changes in
composition. In addition, other elements, such as Mg, Al, Si, K,
Ca, Ti, Mn, Fe, Cu, Ni, Zn, Rb, Sr, Y, Zr, Nb, and Ba have been
determined in whole coal by methods quite similar to those
previously described.</font></p>
