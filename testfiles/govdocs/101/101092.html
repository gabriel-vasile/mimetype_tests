      <h2><font color="#800000"><a name="Start">M</a>ethamphetamine</font></h2>
      <p>Methamphetamine production, distribution, and abuse in Pennsylvania are
      limited, although there is some evidence of an increase in some areas of
      the commonwealth. Most of the increase in production has occurred in rural
      areas, suggesting that abuse there has risen as well. The Pennsylvania
      State Police and the U.S. Attorneys in the Middle and Western Districts of
      Pennsylvania report that methamphetamine production, distribution, and
      abuse are emerging problems. The production, availability, and abuse of
      higher-purity d-methamphetamine have been rising, and those of
      lower-purity dl-methamphetamine have been dropping in the state. Most
      methamphetamine is distributed in ounce to multiounce quantities; larger
      quantities are available primarily in the Philadelphia area. Local
      independent dealers and OMGs are the state's primary methamphetamine
      distributors.</p>
      <h3><font color="#800000"><a name="Abuse">Abuse</a></font></h3>
      <p>Methamphetamine abuse is low in Pennsylvania. Admissions to state
      treatment facilities with methamphetamine as the primary drug of abuse
      accounted for less than 1 percent of all nonalcohol drug treatment
      admissions in 2000, although they did increase slightly from 136 in 1999
      to 155 in 2000. NHSDA data for 1999 indicate that 3 percent of individuals
      in Pennsylvania aged 12 or older have used methamphetamine in their
      lifetimes. Past-year use was reported by only 0.1 percent of individuals
      surveyed. Methamphetamine-related ED mentions in Philadelphia reached a
      7-year low in 1999, dropping from 110 mentions in 1993 to 47 mentions in
      1999. The Philadelphia Police Department reported in 2000 that
      methamphetamine popularity in the city was declining. However, law
      enforcement in Jefferson County, Titusville, and Pottsville report that
      methamphetamine abuse increased in those areas in 2000.</p>
      <p align="center"><a href="#Top">To Top</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="index.htm#Contents">To Contents</a></p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <h3><a name="Availability"><font color="#800000">Availability</font></a></h3>
      <p>Methamphetamine throughout the state is available in small quantities,
      and larger quantities are available primarily in the Philadelphia area.
      DEA Philadelphia reports that methamphetamine remains readily available in
      southeastern Pennsylvania, particularly in Bucks, Delaware, and Montgomery
      Counties. An increase in the availability of suspected d-methamphetamine
      in Allentown, Bethlehem, and Easton (all located in eastern Pennsylvania)
      was reported. Methamphetamine is readily available in ounce to pound
      quantities in parts of Schuylkill County, corresponding with high abuse in
      that area. In central Pennsylvania, wholesale quantities of
      methamphetamine are limited, but ounce quantities are usually available.</p>
      <p>Methamphetamine-related investigations, arrests, and seizures increased
      in 2000 in Pennsylvania, according to law enforcement reporting.
      Approximately 6.6 percent of convicted federal criminal defendants in the
      state were sentenced for a methamphetamine-related primary offense in
      1999, compared with 12.8 percent nationally. Methamphetamine-related
      sentences were highest in the U.S. Attorney Eastern District at 9.1
      percent and lowest in the Western District at 1.6 percent. In the Middle
      District, 4.3 percent of sentences were methamphetamine-related.</p>
      <p>The price of methamphetamine remained stable in 2000. Generally,
      methamphetamine costs from $8,000 to $23,000 per pound and has a purity of
      25 to 60 percent. According to the Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Organized
      Crime Law Enforcement Network (MAGLOCLEN), the price of a gram of
      methamphetamine averages $80.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <h3><a name="Violence"><font color="#800000">Violence</font></a></h3>
      <p>Because methamphetamine abuse and distribution are low in Pennsylvania,
      methamphetamine-related violence is limited. However, violence might
      increase if methamphetamine activity rises. Methamphetamine users
      sometimes resort to violent means to obtain the drug, and methamphetamine abusers often
      experience feelings of paranoia, fright, delusion, and confusion, which
      can cause them to act violently without provocation.</p>

      <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <h3><font color="#800000"><a name="Production">Production</a></font></h3>
      <p>Historically, most methamphetamine production in Pennsylvania has
      occurred in Philadelphia using the P2P method, a process that yields
      low-purity dl-methamphetamine (see <a href="#textbox">text box</a>).
      Production now occurs in other parts of the state in both urban and rural
      areas, and some laboratory operators are using the red phosphorus, Nazi,
      or cold cook methods to produce higher purity d-methamphetamine. The introduction of high purity d-methamphetamine to
      the market is attracting college students, young professionals,
      minorities, and women in addition to Caucasian, blue-collar workers, who
      have been the traditional methamphetamine users.

              </b><i>
              <p>Cold Cook Method:</i><b> </b>Ephedrine, iodine, and red
              phosphorus are mixed in a plastic container, and methamphetamine
              oil precipitates into another plastic container through a
              connecting tube. The oil is heated, typically by sunlight or by
              burying the containers in hot sand, to produce small quantities of
              highly pure d-methamphetamine.</p>
              <i>
              <p>Nazi Method:</i> Primary chemicals are sodium or lithium metal
              and ephedrine. This method usually yields up to ounce quantities
              of highly pure d-methamphetamine and is frequently used by
              independent Caucasian methamphetamine cookers.</p>
              <i>
              <p>Red phosphorus Method:</i><b> </b>Also known as the
              &quot;Mexican&quot; or &quot;ephedrine reduction&quot; method.
              Primary chemicals are ephedrine or pseudoephedrine, hydriodic
              acid, and red phosphorus. Frequently used by Mexican
              organizations, or cookers trained by Mexicans, this method
              produces large amounts of d-methamphetamine.</p>
              <i>
              <p>P2P Method:</i> Primary chemicals are phenyl-2-propanone and
              aluminum. Synthesis process is complicated and is normally used by
              outlaw motorcycle gangs to produce low-purity dl-methamphetamine.

      <p>
      Methamphetamine laboratory activity is limited in Pennsylvania as a whole,
      although law enforcement reports recent increases in some areas. EPIC data
      indicate one methamphetamine laboratory seizure by federal authorities in
      Pennsylvania in 1998, eight in 1999, and one in the first quarter of 2001.
      Of the eight laboratories seized in 2000, five used the P2P method, two
      used the Nazi method, and one used the ephedrine reduction method to
      produce methamphetamine. The Pennsylvania State Police reported seizing
      five d-methamphetamine laboratories during the first 5 months of 2001. DEA
      Pittsburgh reports an increase in the number of methamphetamine
      laboratories in their jurisdiction, having seized six in western
      Pennsylvania from August 2000 to May 2001. The Pennsylvania Bureau of
      Narcotics in Erie reports a large increase in the number of seizures of
      methamphetamine laboratories, most of them using the red phosphorus
      method.</p>
      <p align="center"><a href="#Top">To Top</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="index.htm#Contents">To Contents</a></p>
      <p>In Philadelphia, traditional organized crime elements, OMGs, and other
      independent groups are the chief manufacturers of methamphetamine. These
      groups produce ounce to multipound quantities. DEA Philadelphia reports
      that the P2P method of manufacturing is the preferred method in
      Philadelphia, despite the increased popularity of the Nazi and red
      phosphorus methods. Philadelphia remains a major source for
      dl-methamphetamine produced in the state. The majority of methamphetamine
      manufactured in Philadelphia is sold in Pennsylvania, Delaware, and New
      Jersey.</p>
      <p>The Philadelphia Division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation
      reports that the distribution of methamphetamine's precursor chemicals is
      a lucrative business for organized crime groups. The Philadelphia Police
      Department reports that Mexican and Russian criminal groups and Italian
      organized crime groups are involved in chemical procurement in the city.
      Independent dealers are involved as well. For instance, on April 4, 2000,
      a Delaware County man pled guilty to selling $72 million worth of P2P on
      the black market, enough to produce 10 to 13 pounds of methamphetamine.
      The individual sold the P2P for $10,000 to $35,000 per gallon. This
      arrest, which made P2P more difficult to obtain, may have contributed to
      the decline of P2P methamphetamine production in Philadelphia, thereby
      opening the market to other forms of methamphetamine.</p>
      <p>Local independent dealers, primarily Caucasians, are responsible for
      most of the methamphetamine production in western Pennsylvania. Their
      laboratories typically produce small quantities of high-purity
      d-methamphetamine for personal use and limited distribution to friends and
      associates. These low-production laboratories are frequently referred to
      as &quot;tweaker,&quot; &quot;Mom and Pop,&quot; or &quot;Beavis and
      Butthead&quot; laboratories. The following are some examples of
      methamphetamine activity in western Pennsylvania:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>In 2000, DEA Philadelphia reported the seizure of a methamphetamine
          laboratory operating in a mobile trailer in western Pennsylvania that
          was capable of producing 10 to 12 ounces of methamphetamine per week.
          The laboratory operator had combined pseudoephedrine extracted from
          diet capsules with red phosphorus and iodine to produce
          methamphetamine. He had purchased the diet capsules by the case in
          Ohio and had ordered the red phosphorus from Louisville, Kentucky.
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>On September 15, 2000 an individual arrested in Seattle told
          authorities he had a methamphetamine laboratory in his apartment in
          Hampton, a suburb of Pittsburgh. The individual reportedly had
          purchased precursor chemicals in Oregon and was attempting to
          transport them back to Pittsburgh by way of Seattle when a bottle of
          hydrobromic acid broke in his duffel bag and started to smolder and
          emit fumes.
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>In February 2001, a Centerville, Crawford County man was charged
          with manufacturing methamphetamine in a shed near his home.
          Intelligence indicates that the individual was possibly using the cold
          cook production method.
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>In March 2001, authorities seized an active methamphetamine
          laboratory in Crawford County that was operated by residents of the
          county. The laboratory used the red phosphorus method of production
          and had the capacity to produce at least 2 pounds of methamphetamine
          at a time. The laboratory operators had purchased precursor chemicals
          from an Erie chemical company.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Methamphetamine production is a serious safety and environmental
      concern. The production process creates toxic waste that endangers law
      enforcement personnel, emergency response teams, and the environment.
      Methamphetamine laboratories typically produce 5 to 6 pounds of toxic
      waste for every pound of methamphetamine. Illegal manufacturers typically
      dump waste in the local area, contaminating ground water and killing
      vegetation. Cleanup and remediation of laboratory sites, mandated by
      federal law, can be very expensive. A single laboratory site cleanup can
      cost $5,000 to $60,000.</p>

      <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <h3><a name="Transportation"><font color="#800000">Transportation</font></a></h3>
      <p>In addition to being locally manufactured, methamphetamine available in
      Pennsylvania is transported from sources in California, Florida, and
      Mexico. Local independent dealers and OMGs are the primary transporters of
      methamphetamine to Pennsylvania. They transport the drug along major
      highways in private or rented vehicles, or they send methamphetamine to
      the state via express mail. On June 5, 2000, law enforcement dismantled a
      criminal group that transported methamphetamine from California to
      Bloomsburg (Columbia County) on Interstate 80, which runs from California
      to Pennsylvania. A member of the group claimed that he was transporting
      more than 42 pounds of methamphetamine concealed in a truckload of walnuts
      and pistachios. The methamphetamine was purchased in California for
      $10,000 per pound and was to be sold in Pennsylvania for $25,000 per
      pound. Also, in February 2000, the Blair County Drug Task Force seized
      methamphetamine in an express mail package arriving from Bakersfield,
      California.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <h3><font color="#800000"><a name="Distribution">Distribution</a></font></h3>
      <p>Most methamphetamine is distributed in ounce to multiounce quantities;
      larger quantities are available primarily in the Philadelphia area. Local
      independent dealers and OMGs are the state's primary methamphetamine
      distributors. In April 2000, two residents of Nanty Glo in western
      Pennsylvania were arrested for distributing methamphetamine. Authorities
      seized 1 pound of the drug. The estimated revenue from the distribution of
      the seized methamphetamine was $50,000.
