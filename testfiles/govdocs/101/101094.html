In toxicology and carcinogenesis studies, groupsofF344/N rats and B6C3F<sub class="small">1</sub> mice of each sex received whole-bodyexposure to bromoethane (greater than 98% pure) once for 4 hours or for 6hoursper day, 5 days per week, for 14 days, 14 weeks, or 2 years.  Genetictoxicology studies were conducted in <span class="italic">Salmonella typhimurium</span> andChinesehamster ovary (CHO) cells.</p><h4>Single-Exposure,Fourteen-Day,and Fourteen-WeekStudies:</h4><p> Single-exposureinhalation studies were conducted in rats and mice at target concentrations of625, 1,250, 2,500, 5,000, or 10,000 ppm bromoethane.  All rats exposed to10,000 ppm bromoethane and 3/5 female rats exposed to 5,000 ppm diedbefore theend of the single-exposure studies.  All mice exposed to 5,000 or 10,000 ppmbromoethane and 2/5 female mice exposed to 1,250 ppm died before the endof thestudies.</p><p>Fourteen-dayinhalation studies were conducted in rats and mice at target concentrations of0, 250, 500, 1,000, 2,000, or 4,000 ppm bromoethane.  All rats and miceexposedto 2,000 or 4,000 ppm died before the end of the 14-daystudies.  Final mean body weights of exposed and control rats weresimilar.</p><p>Fourteen-weekinhalation studies were conducted in rats and mice at target concentrations of0, 100, 200, 400, 800, or 1,600 ppm bromoethane.  Four of 10 male and 2/10female rats exposed to 1,600 ppm died before the end of the 14-week studies.The final mean body weights of rats exposed to 1,600 ppm were lower thantheinitial mean body weights.  Compound-relatedlesions observed in rats at 1,600 ppm, but not at lower concentrations,included minimal atrophy of the thigh muscle, minimal-to-moderatemultifocal mineralization in the cerebellum of the brain, minimal-to-severehemosiderosis of the spleen, marked atrophy of the testis, and minimal-to-mildatrophy of the uterus.  The effects in the testis and uterus are probably dueto chemical-relatedloss in body weight during the studies.</p><p>In mice, compound-relateddeaths included 3/10 male and 1/10 female mice exposed to 1,600 ppm, 1/9malesexposed to 800 ppm, and 1/10 males exposed to 400 ppm.  The final meanbodyweights of male and female mice exposed to 1,600 ppm were about 15%lower thanthose of controls. Compound-related effects included atrophy of the uterusandinvolution of the ovary in females exposed to 1,600 ppm bromoethane.<p>Based on these results, 2-yearstudies were conducted by exposing groups of 49 or 50 rats or mice of eachsexto bromoethane at 0, 100, 200, or 400 ppm, 6 hours per day, 5 days perweek.</p><h4>Body Weight and Survival in the Two-YearStudies:</h4><p> Mean body weights of exposed and control rats were generallysimilarthroughout the studies.  No significant differences in survival were observedbetween any groups of male rats (control, 17/49; 100 ppm, 26/50; 200 ppm,27/50; 400 ppm, 21/50); survival of the 100-ppmgroup of female rats was greater than that of controls (19/50; 29/50; 24/49;23/50), and the number of control and 400-ppmmale rats and control female rats surviving to the end of the studies waslow.</p><p>Mean body weights of the 400-ppmgroup of male mice were up to 9% lower than those of controls throughout thestudy.  Mean body weights of the 400-ppmgroup of female mice were generally 6%-16%lower than those of controls after week 29.  No differences in survival wereobserved between any group of male mice (35/50; 37/50; 30/50; 34/50).  Thesurvival of the 400-ppmgroup of female mice was lower than that of controls at the end of the study(36/50; 37/50; 37/49; 23/49).</p><h4>Nonneoplastic and Neoplastic Effects in the Two-YearStudies:</h4><p>  The incidences of pheochromocytomas or malignantpheochromocytomas(combined) of the adrenal medulla were increased in exposed male rats(control,8/40; 100 ppm, 23/45; 200 ppm, 18/46; 400 ppm, 21/46).</p><p>Granular cell neoplasms of the brain were seen in exposed male rats but notincontrols (0/49; 3/50; 1/50; 1/50).  A glioma, an astrocytoma, or anoligodendroglioma was seen in 3/50 male rats exposed to 100 ppm.  Gliomaswerenot observed in control female rats, but they occurred in exposed female ratswith a significant positive trend (0/50; 1/50; 1/48; 3/50).  The historicalincidence of granular cell tumors in male F344/N rat chamber controls at thestudy laboratory is 0/297.  The incidences of gliomas in the exposed femalegroups were not significantly greater than that in the controls and were withinthe historical incidence range for glial cell neoplasms for untreated controlsin <acronym title="National Toxicology Program">NTP</acronym> studies (mean: 23/1,969, 1%; range: 0/50-3/50),but they exceeded the historical incidence range for chamber controls at thestudy laboratory (mean: 1/297, 0.3%; range: 0/50-1/50).</p><p>Alveolar epithelial hyperplasia was increased in rats exposed to 400 ppmbromoethane (male: 3/48; 7/49; 7/48; 18/48; female: 5/50; 4/48; 5/47; 10/49).Alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas or carcinomas (combined) were seen in fourmalerats exposed to 200 ppm and in one exposed to 400 ppm. Alveolar/bronchiolaradenomas were observed in 3/49 female rats at 400 ppm but not at lowerconcentrations or in controls.  The incidences in exposed male and femaleratswere not significantly greater than those in controls; however, the historicalincidence in rat chamber controls for alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas orcarcinomas (combined) at the study laboratory is 6/299 (2%) for males and4/297(1.3%) for females.</p><p>The incidences of epithelial hyperplasia and squamous metaplasia of thenasalcavity were increased in rats exposed to 400 ppm.  The incidence ofsuppurativeinflammation of the nasal cavity was increased in exposed male rats, and theincidences of suppurative inflammation of the larynx and metaplasia of theolfactory sensory epithelium were increased in exposed male and female rats.An adenoma of the nose was seen in one 400-ppmmale rat and in one 400-ppm female mouse.</p><p>Suppurative inflammation and dilatation of the salivary gland ducts wereobserved at increased incidences in the 200-and 400-ppm groups of female rats.  Animals were found to be positive for ratcoronavirus/sialodacryoadenitis virus antibodies.</p><p>The incidence of mammary gland neoplasms was significantly lower in femaleratsat 400 ppm than in controls (18/50; 15/50; 10/48; 7/50).</p><p>Adenomas (0/50; 1/50; 1/47; 6/48), adenocarcinomas (0/50; 2/50; 3/47;19/48),and squamous cell carcinomas (0/50; 1/50; 1/47; 3/48) of the uterus occurredinexposed female mice and not in control mice.</p><p>The incidence of alveolar/bronchiolar neoplasms was greater in male mice at400ppm than in controls (adenomas or carcinomas, combined: 7/50; 6/50; 12/50;15/50). Acute/chronic inflammation of the lung was observed at increasedincidences in female mice at 200 and 400 ppm.</p><h4>Genetic Toxicology:</h4><p> Bromoethane, tested in a closed environment of adesiccator, was mutagenic in <span class="italic">S. typhimurium</span> strain TA100 with andwithout exogenous metabolic activation; it was not mutagenic in strain TA98.Incultured CHO cells, bromoethane induced sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs)butnot chromosomal aberrations in both the presence and absence ofexogenousmetabolic activation.</p><h4>Conclusions:</h4><p> Under the conditions of these 2-yearinhalation studies, there was <span class="italic"><A HREF="/index.cfm?objectid=07027D0E-E5CB-050E-027371D9CC0AAACF#CARCDEF">some evidence</A> of carcinogenic activity</span> ofbromoethane for male F344/N rats, as indicated by increased incidences ofpheochromocytomas of the adrenal gland; neoplasms of the brain and lungmayalso have been related to exposure to bromoethane.
