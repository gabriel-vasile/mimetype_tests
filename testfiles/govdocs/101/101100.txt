                                BROMINE

    (Data in thousand metric tons of bromine content, unless noted)

Domestic Production and Use:  The quantity of bromine sold or used in the United
States from companies operating in Arkansas and Michigan accounted for 100% of
elemental bromine production valued at an estimated $186 million.  Arkansas continued
to be the Nation's leading bromine producer, and bromine was the leading mineral
commodity in terms of value produced in the State.

Estimated bromine use was fire retardants, 27%; agriculture, 15%; petroleum
additives, 15%; well drilling fluids, 10%; sanitary preparations, 5%; and other uses,
28%.  Other uses included intermediate chemicals used in the manufacture of other
products, and bromide solutions used alone or in combinations with other chemicals.

Recycling:  Approximately 35% of U.S. bromine production was converted to byproduct
sodium bromide solutions, which were recycled to obtain elemental bromine.  This
recycled bromine is not included in the virgin bromine production reported by the
companies.

Import Sources (1991-94):  Israel, 76%; Netherlands, 20%; and France, 4%.

Depletion Allowance:  5% on brine wells (Domestic and Foreign).

Government Stockpile:  None.

Events, Trends, and Issues:  Two bromine companies announced plans to expand domestic
capacity.  One of the companies announced that their bromine production capacity
would be increased 30% at its plant in Magnolia, AR.  A third company planned to
build a bromine plant with capacity between 9 and 14 million kilograms at Manistee,
MI.  The plant would produce elemental bromine and brominated salts from brines used
to produce magnesium.  The plant was expected to be completed in late 1996.

The Environmental Protection Agency planned to work on an essential-use exemption for
methyl bromide in the event effective alternatives are not found by 2001.  Methyl
bromide was listed as a Class I ozone depleting substance in the 1990 Clean Air Act
and is scheduled to be phased out in 2001.  

Producers of brominated flame retardants have voluntarily agreed to phase out
production of some grades of flame retardants considered capable of emitting toxic
byproducts when incinerated.  The agreement was reached by a joint policy board on
chemical safety at the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD).  

Israel, the second largest producer of bromine in the world, canceled the public
offering of a 22% share in the state-owned chemical company.  The delay in
privatization was as a result of the offering not meeting the Government's minimum
price.  

Israel and Jordan announced a memorandum of understanding to construct a $50 million
bromine plant on the Jordanian side of the Dead Sea.  The 50-50 joint venture would
be managed by the Jordanians, but technical and marketing assistance would be
provided by Dead Sea Bromine.  The facility would have a capacity of 11 million
kilograms per year of bromine.  Dead Sea signed an agreement with a domestic producer
to provide bromine during a 20-year period.

World Resources:  Resources of bromine are virtually unlimited.  The Dead Sea in the
Middle East is estimated to contain 1 billion tons of bromine.  Seawater contains
about 65 parts per million of bromine or an estimated 100 trillion tons.  The bromine
content of underground water in Poland has been estimated at 36 million tons.

Substitutes:  Chlorine and iodine may be substituted for bromine in a few chemical
reactions and for sanitation purposes.  Aniline and some of its derivatives,
methanol, ethanol, and gasoline-grade tertiary butyl alcohol, are effective nonlead
substitutes for ethylene dibromide and lead in gasoline in some cars.  There are no
comparable substitutes for bromine in various oil and gas well completion and packer
applications.   Alumina, magnesium hydroxide, organic chlorine compounds, and
phosphorus compounds can be substituted for bromine as fire retardants in some uses.
