      <P>Dear Mr. Scalice:</P>
      <P>This is in reference to an investigation conducted by the Nuclear Regulatory 
        Commission's (NRC) Office of Investigations (OI) between September 21, 
        1999 and June 15, 2000, and an inspection completed on June 24, 2000. 
        The purpose of the OI investigation and inspection was to review the circumstances 
        involving an individual formerly employed by the Tennessee Valley Authority's 
        (TVA) Browns&nbsp;Ferry Nuclear Plant (BFN), who failed to perform measuring 
        and test equipment (M&amp;TE) nonconformance evaluations in accordance 
        with Technical Specification required site procedures. </P>
      <P>The results of the OI investigation and inspection were formally transmitted 
        to you by letter dated July 27, 2000. Our letter also provided you the 
        opportunity to either respond to the apparent violation in writing or 
        request a predecisional enforcement conference. By letter dated August 
        25, 2000, you responded to the apparent violation and addressed the root 
        causes and your corrective actions to prevent recurrence. We have reviewed 
        the information you provided and have concluded that sufficient information 
        is available to determine the appropriate enforcement action in this matter.</P>
      <P>Based on the information developed during the investigation and our review 
        and follow-up of the information provided in your response of August 25, 
        2000, the NRC has determined that a violation of NRC requirements occurred. 
        The violation is cited in the enclosed Notice of Violation (Notice), and 
        the circumstances surrounding it are described in detail in the subject 
        inspection report. The violation involves the failure to adhere to TVA 
        procedures as required by Technical Specification 5.4.1, related to out-of-tolerance 
        M&amp;TE. During a self-assessment in June 1999, your staff identified 
        that certain procedurally required actions had not been taken in response 
        to numerous out-of-tolerance M&amp;TE. Site procedures required that upon 
        being informed (in this case, by TVA's Central Laboratory Field Testing 
        Services) that M&amp;TE was out-of-tolerance, the M&amp;TE Program Administrator 
        was required to issue and/or disposition non-conformance evaluations for 
        those plant components tested or inspected using the out-of-tolerance 
        M&amp;TE. The purpose of a nonconformance evaluation is, among other reasons, 
        to initiate the site review process to ensure that plant components have 
        not been negatively affected by the out-of-tolerance M&amp;TE, and to 
        initiate action to address plant components that have been affected. Your 
        review determined that from June 1997 to June 1999, approximately 500 
        nonconformance evaluations were not properly issued and/or dispositioned. 
        After TVA identified the full scope of unprocessed nonconformance evaluations, 
        your staff's reevaluation of all nonconformance evaluations determined 
        that plant component operability, and in particular, safety related component 
        operability, was unaffected. The NRC's OI investigation concluded that 
        the failure of the M&amp;TE Program Administrator to issue and/or disposition 
        nonconformance evaluations for the out-of-tolerance M&amp;TE was deliberate. 
        Based on the deliberate aspects of this matter, the violation has been 
        categorized at Severity III, in accordance with the "General Statement 
        of Policy and Procedures for NRC Enforcement Actions - May 1, 2000" (Enforcement 
        Policy), NUREG-1600. </P>
      <P>In accordance with the Enforcement Policy, a base civil penalty in the 
        amount of $55,000 is considered for a Severity Level III violation. Because 
        your facility has not been the subject of escalated enforcement action 
        in the past two years, the NRC considered whether credit was warranted 
        for <EM><U>Corrective Action</U></EM> in accordance with the civil penalty 
        assessment process described in Section VI.C.2 of the Enforcement Policy. 
        Your letter of August 25, 2000, described your corrective actions in response 
        to this issue, which included: (1) an evaluation of the impact of the 
        unprocessed nonconformance evaluations on plant equipment; (2) an overall 
        assessment of the M&amp;TE program to examine compliance with internal 
        governing documents and policies; (3) increasing the awareness of M&amp;TE 
        issues at the site by a weekly review of nonconformance evaluations during 
        the Plan-Of-The-Day meeting; (4) a briefing of senior site managers on 
        the circumstances of this particular violation; (5) the development of 
        a new training course for first line supervisors to improve their awareness 
        of the potential for the type of behavior encountered in this particular 
        instance, and methods of detection; and (6) inclusion of the M&amp;TE 
        program in the BFN Programs and Process Core Assessment program, which 
        will re-assess the site M&amp;TE program in June of 2001.</P>
      <P>As stated in our July 27, 2000 letter, the NRC initially was concerned 
        that management oversight of the M&amp;TE program failed to detect this 
        situation during the two year period it was occurring, and requested that 
        TVA address any management oversight aspects of this issue. Your response 
        referenced, as background information, the performance of M&amp;TE periodic 
        status reports. The purpose of these status reports, as you indicated, 
        was to provide feedback to management as a means to ensure that all nonconformance 
        evaluations were being properly investigated in a timely manner. As stated 
        in your letter, four status reports were performed by the M&amp;TE Program 
        Administrator from 1997 to 1999 and were submitted to his management superiors. 
        Based on our subsequent review and follow-up of the four audit reports, 
        we have identified that the audit reports contained only one month of 
        nonconformance evaluation data. Based on the NRC's discussions with TVA 
        staff, it appears that the intent of these audit reports was to provide 
        six months of nonconformance data to plant supervision. However, this 
        discrepancy was apparently not recognized by TVA supervision at the time 
        the audits were provided to them, nor was the discrepancy identified during 
        TVA's review of this matter. The NRC has concluded that BFN supervisory 
        review of the audit reports during the time of the M&amp;TE Program Administrator's 
        deliberate misconduct was inadequate, in that the review failed to consider 
        that a significant quantity of nonconformance evaluation data was not 
        submitted for review. An adequate review of the audit reports and the 
        work of the M&amp;TE Program Administrator may have provided management 
        a possible opportunity to identify the violation earlier. </P>
      <P>More importantly, your response of August 25, 2000, indicated that an 
        overall assessment of the M&amp;TE program was conducted to examine compliance 
        with internal governing documents and policies. However, the omitted data 
        issue was not addressed by TVA. The failure to recognize the omitted data 
        supports a conclusion that your review of the factors stemming from the 
        violation was not adequate to fully identify management oversight deficiencies. 
        As such, this management oversight failure was not considered in the development 
        of TVA's corrective actions for this issue. Therefore, the NRC determined 
        that credit is not warranted for the factor of <EM><U>Corrective Action</U></EM>.</P>
      <P>This assessment normally would result in a proposed civil penalty of 
        $55,000. However, the NRC may refrain from proposing a civil penalty for 
        a Severity Level III violation in accordance with Section VII.B.6 of the 
        Enforcement Policy. In this case, the NRC has concluded that the underlying 
        safety significance involving the unprocessed nonconformance evaluations 
        was low, because safety related plant component operability was unaffected. 
        Therefore, with approval of the Director, Office of Enforcement, and in 
        consultation with the Deputy Executive Director for Reactor Programs, 
        I have been authorized to propose that no civil penalty be assessed in 
        this case. However, significant violations in the future could result 
        in a civil penalty. Please note that an Order Prohibiting Involvement 
        in NRC Licensed Activities (Effective Immediately) has been issued to 
        the former employee responsible for the deliberate misconduct. A copy 
        of the Order is enclosed for your information. </P>
      <P>You are required to respond to this letter and should follow the instructions 
        specified in the enclosed Notice when preparing your response. The NRC 
        will use your response, in part, to determine whether further enforcement 
        action is necessary to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.</P>
      <P>In accordance with 10 CFR 2.790 of the NRC's "Rules of Practice," a copy 
        of this letter and its enclosures, TVA's letter dated August 25, 2000, 
        and your response to the Notice will be available electronically for public 
        inspection in the NRC Public Document Room (PDR) or from the Publicly 
        Available Records (PARS) component of NRC's document system (ADAMS). To 
        the extent possible, your response should not include any personal privacy, 
        proprietary, or safeguards information so that it can be placed in the 
        PDR and PARS without redaction. ADAMS is accessible from the NRC Web site 
        at <A HREF="http://reading-rm/adams.html">http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/adams.html</A>

      <P>If you have any question regarding this matter, please contact Paul Fredrickson, 
        Chief, Projects Branch 6 at 404-562-4530.</P>

      <P>During an investigation conducted by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's 
        (NRC) Office of Investigations (OI) between September 21, 1999 and June 
        15, 2000, and an inspection completed on June 24, 2000, a violation of 
        NRC requirements was identified. In accordance with the "General Statement 
        of Policy and Procedures for NRC Enforcement Actions - May 1, 2000," NUREG-1600, 
        the violation is listed below:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>Technical Specification 5.4.1 requires written procedures be 
        established, implemented, and maintained covering the applicable procedures 
        recommended in Regulatory Guide&nbsp;1.33, Revision&nbsp;2, Appendix&nbsp;A, 
        February&nbsp;1978. Appendix&nbsp;A, Section&nbsp;8, specifically addresses 
        procedures for control of measuring and test equipment. Appendix A further 
        states that procedures of a type appropriate to the circumstances should 
        be provided to ensure that tools, gauges, instruments, controls, and other 
        measuring and test devices are properly controlled, calibrated, and adjusted 
        at specified periods to maintain accuracy. </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>Browns Ferry Site Standard Practice Procedure (SSP)-6.7, Control 
        of Measuring and Test Equipment (M&amp;TE), Revision&nbsp;8A, Effective 
        May 27, 1997 through June 1, 1998, Step 3.14.A, states that nonconformance 
        evaluations shall be issued for the following conditions: lost M&amp;TE 
        or standards, out-of-tolerance M&amp;TE or plant standards, damaged or 
        otherwise defective M&amp;TE or plant standards, and disassembled M&amp;TE 
        or plant standards. Step 3.14.E states that all nonconformance evaluations 
        should be completed within 30&nbsp;calendar days of the site receipt of 
        the initiating document. An extension of up to ten calendar days may be 
        approved by the Plant Manager, or designee, using Appendix&nbsp;H. </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>Tennessee Valley Authority Standard Programs and Processes Procedure 
        (SPP)-6.4, Measuring and Test Equipment, Revision&nbsp;0, Effective May 
        29, 1998, Step&nbsp;3.15.1, states that nonconformance evaluations shall 
        be issued to determine the validity and acceptability of previous work 
        for the following conditions: lost M&amp;TE or standards, out-of-tolerance 
        M&amp;TE or plant standards, damaged or otherwise defective M&amp;TE or 
        plant standards, and disassembled M&amp;TE or plant standards. Step 3.15.6 
        requires all nonconformance evaluations be completed within 30 calendar 
        days of the site receipt of the initiating document. </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>Contrary to the above, during the period from June 2, 1997, 
        to June 14, 1999, SSP-6.7 and SPP-6.4 were not implemented, in that approximately 
        500 nonconformance evaluations were either not issued or completed for 
        measuring and test equipment which had been identified as out-of-tolerance 
        or otherwise meeting the criteria for evaluation. (01013) </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>This is a Severity Level III violation. (Supplement I)</P>
      <P>Pursuant to the provisions of 10 CFR 2.201, Tennessee Valley Authority 
        is hereby required to submit a written statement or explanation to the 
        U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, ATTN: Document Control Desk, Washington, 
        DC 20555 with a copy to the Regional Administrator, Region II, and a copy 
        to the NRC Resident Inspector at the Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant, within 
        30 days of the date of the letter transmitting this Notice of Violation 
        (Notice). This reply should be clearly marked as a "Reply to a Notice 
        of Violation" and should include: (1) the reason for the violation, or, 
        if contested, the basis for disputing the violation or severity level, 
        (2) the corrective steps that have been taken and the results achieved, 
        (3) the corrective steps that will be taken to avoid further violations, 
        and (4) the date when full compliance will be achieved. Your response 
        may reference or include previously docketed correspondence, if the correspondence 
        adequately addresses the required response. If an adequate reply is not 
        received within the time specified in this Notice, an order or a Demand 
        for Information may be issued as to why the license should not be modified, 
        suspended, or revoked, or why such other action as may be proper should 
        not be taken. Where good cause is shown, consideration will be given to 
        extending the response time. </P>
      <P>If you contest this enforcement action, you should also provide a copy 
        of your response, with the basis for your denial, to the Director, Office 
        of Enforcement, United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, 
        DC 20555-0001. </P>
      <P>Because your response will be made available electronically for public 
        inspection in the NRC Public Document Room or from the Publicly Available 
        Records (PARS) component of NRC's document system (ADAMS), to the extent 
        possible, it should not include any personal privacy, proprietary, or 
        safeguards information so that it can be made available to the public 
        without redaction. ADAMS is accessible from the NRC Web site at <a href="http://reading-rm/adams.html">http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/adams.html</a> 
        (the Public Electronic Reading Room). If personal privacy or proprietary 
        information is necessary to provide an acceptable response, then please 
        provide a bracketed copy of your response that identifies the information 
        that should be protected and a redacted copy of your response that deletes 
        such information. If you request withholding of such material, you <U>must</U> 
        specifically identify the portions of your response that you seek to have 
        withheld and provide in detail the bases for your claim of withholding 
        (e.g., explain why the disclosure of information will create an unwarranted 
        invasion of personal privacy or provide the information required by 10 
        CFR&nbsp;2.790(b) to support a request for withholding confidential commercial 
        or financial information). If safeguards information is necessary to provide 
        an acceptable response, please provide the level of protection described 
        in 10 CFR 73.21. </P>
      <P>In accordance with 10 CFR 19.11, you may be required to post this Notice 
        within two working days. </P>
      <P>Dated this 27<SUP>th</SUP> day of October 2000 </P>
