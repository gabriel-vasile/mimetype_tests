<h1>Sitewide welding operations</h1>
<p> This notice supersedes Notice 0141, dated April 16,  and requires the use of PD-030-000, PS-1 Nonconformance Reporting, in the documenting and dispositioning of weldments determined to be nonconforming and consumable welding materials that have not been or are not being correctly maintained and stored. PD-030-000 allows the use of an organization's existing nonconformance reporting procedure if certain requirements are met.  A review of the Welder Qualification Database, field observations, walk-downs, audits and weld filler material requisitions, indicates that consistent standardized requirements for performing sitewide welding activities must be established. Therefore,  the requirements contained in this notice must be implemented until replaced by similar requirements that will be contained in Chapter 13 of the Engineering Standards Manual when developed and implemented.</p>
