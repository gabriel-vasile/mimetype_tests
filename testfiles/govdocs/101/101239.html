Why GAO Did This Study:

In the 2004 Defense Appropriations Act, Congress mandated that GAO 
examine and report on the oversight of prime contractors by the 
Department of Defense (DOD) and the oversight of subcontractors by the 
prime contractors. Contract quality assurance oversight is intended to 
assess whether contractors are capable of and are providing supplies or 
services that meet contract quality and technical requirements. 
Providing effective oversight is challenging. DCMA recognizes that the 
risk of nonconforming parts reaching end users exists, given the 
diversity of contracts, parts, and products used to meet weapon systems 
requirements and uses a risk management process to guide its efforts. 
For fiscal year 2003, government quality assurance oversight was 
required for approximately 273,000 contracts. GAO determined (1) 
whether DOD provided quality assurance oversight and enforcement over 
its spare parts prime contractors, (2) if prime contractors provided 
quality assurance oversight over their subcontractors, and (3) how DOD 
held prime contractors accountable for overseeing the subcontractors’ 
work. To address these objectives, GAO judgmentally selected and 
reviewed 15 contracts awarded to 11 prime contractors by the services 
and the Defense Logistics Agency.

In commenting on a draft of this report, DOD provided one technical 
comment, which GAO incorporated as appropriate.

What GAO Found:

GAO’s review of the 15 contracts showed that quality assurance 
personnel within the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA)—DOD’s 
primary organization for providing quality assurance oversight—
generally followed established policies, guidance, regulations, and 
contract requirements in performing oversight and enforcement over 
spare parts prime contractors. This oversight ranged from conducting 
physical inspection of parts, such as testing the measurements and 
functions of a part to evaluating contractor production processes to 
observing the outer appearance and counting the number of parts for 
compliance with contract requirements. When one of the prime 
contractor’s processes and another contractor’s parts did not meet 
contract requirements, DCMA used its enforcement system by issuing 
requests for corrective action by the prime contractors.

GAO found that the 11 prime contractors reviewed provided quality 
assurance oversight over their subcontractors’ work in accordance with 
industry standards and contract requirements. The contractors used at 
least two and up to four methods in providing quality assurance 
oversight over their subcontractors. These methods included evaluating 
potential subcontractors for placement on an Approved Supplier List, 
requiring certifications of parts and processes, testing parts and 
processes, and tracking and monitoring subcontractor’s performance. The 
primary methods of oversight were evaluating subcontractors for 
placement on an Approved Supplier List and requiring certifications 
that parts and processes conform to contractual specifications. 
Establishing an Approved Supplier List served to identify 
subcontractors capable of producing needed parts or processes in 
accordance with industry standards and contractual specifications.

In GAO’s review of the 15 contracts, DCMA held prime contractors 
accountable for their subcontractors’ work by requiring that the prime 
contractors adhere to contract clauses concerning oversight 
responsibility. Most of the contracts included either clauses stating 
that the prime contractor shall provide supplies that conform to 
contract requirements or clauses related to other quality requirements. 
When nonconformance was reported, DCMA quality assurance personnel and 
the prime contractor determined if the deficiency was due to contractor 
nonconformance and assigned responsibility for corrective action. GAO 
identified one deficiency from the 15 contracts that the prime 
contractor was responsible for and DCMA held the prime contractor 
accountable for the part.

While GAO did not identify any major deficiencies from the contracts 
and practices it reviewed, GAO recognizes that the risk of 
nonconforming spare parts reaching end users exists. Compliance by 
contractors, DCMA, and other DOD agencies with established internal 
controls helps mitigate against this risk.

Military personnel rely upon weapon systems such as aircraft and tanks 
to successfully perform their missions on the battlefield. These 
systems contain numerous individual parts and assemblies produced by 
many different contractors and subcontractors. For example, an engine 
for an F-15 aircraft has approximately 16,000 parts and 1,600 different 
part numbers.[Footnote 1] Although there is one prime contractor 
responsible for producing this engine, there are numerous 
subcontractors supplying the parts and assemblies required to build the 
engine under numerous contracts, and quality assurance is required 
throughout the production process. While the military services' 
contracting offices oversee a small percentage of the Department of 
Defense's (DOD) contracts for acquiring the parts, the Defense Contract 
Management Agency (DCMA), through its quality assurance specialists, 
provides quality assurance oversight over the majority of these 
contracts. Quality assurance oversight is defined as the various 
functions, including inspections, performed to determine whether a 
contractor has fulfilled the contractual obligations related to quality 
and quantity. This oversight is intended to assess whether contractors 
are capable of and are providing supplies or services that meet 
contract quality and technical requirements.

Providing effective oversight is challenging, and DCMA recognizes that 
the risk of nonconforming parts reaching end users exists, given the 
diversity of contracts, parts, and products used to meet weapon 
systems requirements. For fiscal year 2003, DCMA was responsible for 
performing government quality assurance oversight over approximately 
273,000 contract actions.[Footnote 2] To help mitigate risks inherent 
with spare parts acquisitions, DOD developed a risk management guide 
that discusses risk and risk management, examines risk management 
concepts, and provides a practical reference for dealing with 
acquisition risk. DCMA used this guide in developing its Risk 
Assessment and Management Program that is used to assess the risk of a 
contractor providing nonconforming parts. According to DCMA officials, 
for the majority of spare parts prime contractors that had contracts 
requiring oversight by DCMA and used subcontractors in providing the 
parts, DCMA relied upon the prime contractors to oversee their 
subcontractors. In accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation, 
DCMA is only responsible for providing quality assurance oversight over 
subcontractors when required to do so in the government's interest. 
When DCMA provides quality assurance oversight over subcontractors, the 
prime contractor is not relieved of any quality assurance oversight 
responsibilities under the contract.

This report responds to the mandate in section 8143 of the 2004 Defense 
Appropriations Act that GAO examine and report on the oversight of 
prime contractors by DOD and the oversight of subcontractors by prime 
contractors.[Footnote 3] Our review focused on whether DCMA and spare 
parts prime contractors are fulfilling their quality assurance 
oversight responsibilities as required by regulations, policies, 
procedures, and contract provisions. Specifically, our objectives were 
to determine whether:

1. DCMA provided quality assurance oversight and enforcement over its 
spare parts prime contractors in accordance with established policies, 
procedures, and guidance; and:

2. prime contractors provided quality assurance oversight over their 
subcontractors' work related to producing spare parts in accordance 
with industry standards and contract requirements.

We also reviewed how DCMA held prime contractors accountable for 
overseeing their subcontractors' work.

To address our objectives, we reviewed regulations, policies, and 
procedures related to the quality assurance oversight over spare parts 
contractors provided by DCMA and prime contractors and the enforcement 
actions available to assure compliance. In addition, we reviewed 15 
contracts awarded to 11 prime contractors and any reports on product 
quality deficiency for these contracts[Footnote 4]. Specifically:

* To assess whether DCMA provided quality assurance oversight over the 
prime contractors, we compared the quality assurance provisions 
included in the 15 contracts to oversight actions performed by DCMA 
quality assurance specialists.[Footnote 5] In assessing whether DCMA 
used enforcement actions, we looked for instances of spare parts 
nonconformance related to these contracts and determined if DCMA levied 
any enforcement actions against the prime contractors.

* To assess prime contractors' oversight of their subcontractors, we 
interviewed representatives from the 11 prime contractors and 
determined if the prime contractors used subcontractors. For those that 
used subcontractors, we held discussions with prime contractor 
personnel related to the level of quality assurance oversight they 
performed over the subcontractors and reviewed their processes for 
managing suppliers and subcontractors. We also gathered documentation 
from the prime contractors on test results of parts produced by 
subcontractors.

* To assess how DCMA held prime contractors accountable for the work of 
their subcontractors, we reviewed the 15 contracts to determine if they 
included clauses holding the prime contractor responsible for the spare 
parts provided to the government. For the instances of nonconforming 
parts reported against these contracts, we reviewed how DCMA handled 
the reported nonconformance and whether DCMA held the prime contractor 
responsible for correcting the nonconformance. More detailed 
information about our scope and methodology is contained in appendix I.

We conducted our review from November 2003 through October 2004 in 
accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Results in Brief:

In our review of the 15 contracts, DCMA quality assurance specialists 
followed established policies, procedures, and guidance in performing 
quality assurance oversight and enforcement over the spare parts prime 
contractors. DCMA's oversight was provided through inspections that 
included: (1) physical inspection of parts such as testing the 
measurements and functions of parts, (2) evaluation of the prime 
contractors' processes to determine compliance with established 
contract requirements and production procedures, and (3) observation of 
the outer appearance of spare parts and taking a physical count of the 
parts to ensure that the proper number of parts are being shipped to 
the end user. When one of the prime contractor's processes and another 
contractor's parts did not meet contract requirements, DCMA used an 
enforcement system that involved issuing requests for corrective action 
by the prime contractors. Corrective actions involved requiring the 
prime contractor to make corrections or changes to the production 
process and demonstrating how processes would be improved to prevent 
further instances of nonconformance. According to DCMA, it was not 
necessary to levy severe enforcement actions such as penalties and 
debarment from conducting business with the federal government against 
any of the contractors that we reviewed.

The prime contractors we reviewed provided quality assurance oversight 
over their subcontractors' work related to producing spare parts in 
accordance with accepted industry standards and contract requirements. 
Based on industry standards, prime contractors used at least two and up 
to four methods in providing quality assurance oversight over their 
subcontractors' work. These methods included (1) evaluating and 
visiting potential subcontractors for placement on a list of approved 
suppliers for a particular part, (2) requiring certifications from the 
subcontractors that the parts or processes were produced in accordance 
with established industry standards and contract requirements, 
(3) performing periodic testing of parts produced by subcontractors, 
and (4) tracking and monitoring approved subcontractors' past 
performance. The primary methods of oversight used were evaluating 
subcontractors for placement on the prime contractor's Approved 
Supplier List and requiring certifications that their parts and 
processes conform to contractual specifications. Establishing an 
Approved Supplier List served to identify qualified subcontractors 
capable of producing needed parts or processes in accordance with 
industry standards and contractual specifications. Industry standards, 
developed and voted upon by a group of technical experts representing 
standards organizations such as Aerospace Standards and International 
Organization of Standardization, allowed prime contractors flexibility 
in providing quality assurance oversight over subcontractors 
considering the type and size of the organization and the product(s) 
produced.

In our review of the 15 contracts, DCMA held prime contractors 
accountable for overseeing their subcontractors' work by requiring that 
the prime contractors adhere to contract clauses concerning oversight 
responsibility. Most of the contracts we reviewed included either the 
Federal Acquisition Regulation clause stating that the prime contractor 
shall tender to the government for acceptance only supplies that 
conform with contract requirements or other clauses related to quality 
assurance requirements. When instances of product quality deficiency 
were reported, the DCMA quality assurance specialist and the prime 
contractor determined if the deficiency was due to contractor 
nonconformance and assigned responsibility for corrective action. For 
the 15 contracts we reviewed, we identified one deficiency that was 
determined to be the responsibility of the prime contractor and DCMA 
held the prime contractor accountable for the part. DCMA also performed 
reviews of subcontractors' certifications to the prime contractor that 
the parts and processes produced by the subcontractor were manufactured 
in accordance with the contract requirements. These reviews served as a 
check by DCMA to determine whether the prime contractors' quality 
assurance systems were adequate for oversight of their subcontractors' 
work. During our review, service officials provided us with examples of 
other contracts in which nonconforming parts reached end users. DCMA 
followed its procedures for evaluating the causes of these 
nonconforming parts. The reasons for the nonconformance varied for each 
part.

We are not making any recommendations in this report. While we did not 
identify any major deficiencies from the contracts and practices we 
reviewed, we recognize that the risk of nonconforming spare parts 
reaching end users exists. Compliance by contractors, DCMA, and other 
DOD agencies with established internal controls helps mitigate against 
this risk.

In written comments on a draft of this report, DOD provided one 
technical comment, which we incorporated as appropriate. The 
department's comments and our evaluation are on page 17 of this report.

Background:

The Federal Acquisition Regulation is the primary regulation for use by 
all federal agencies in acquiring supplies and services. Sections 46 
and 52, which discuss and set forth quality assurance and contract 
clauses, respectively, provide guidance in determining quality 
assurance responsibilities. According to the Federal Acquisition 
Regulation, government contract quality assurance is defined as the 
various functions, including inspections, performed by the government 
to determine whether a contractor has fulfilled the contract 
obligations pertaining to quality and quantity. These inspections can 
either be conducted at the contractor's place of manufacture and 
production (source) or at the receiving location for the parts 
(destination).

DOD's Quality Assurance Oversight for Contracts Is Provided Primarily 
by DCMA:

DCMA is DOD's primary organization for performing quality assurance 
oversight for contracts and this oversight responsibility typically 
only covers prime contractors. DCMA's execution of its quality 
assurance responsibility is primarily through its source inspection 
program. Source inspections are defined as inspections at the point 
where goods are manufactured or assembled. There are three types of 
source inspections: physical inspection; contractor process reviews; 
and kind, count, and condition. Physical inspection involves inspecting 
parts by comparing the parts to a specification, drawing, or other 
instruction. Contractor process reviews are inspections of processes 
and procedures for establishing confidence that the procured parts will 
produce a desired outcome. Inspections involving kind, count, and 
condition are inspections intended to visually identify and verify the 
quantity and exterior appearance of a part to determine if it visually 
meets contract specifications.

During fiscal year 2003, DCMA was responsible for government source 
inspection for approximately 273,000 contracts. The Federal Acquisition 
Regulation requires that contracts include inspection and other quality 
requirements that will protect the interest of the government. It also 
provides guidance in establishing which clauses to include in the 
various types of contracts. The clauses included in each contract 
dictate the type and level of quality assurance oversight to be 
performed. DCMA quality assurance specialists are expected to follow 
the inspection and acceptance provisions in each contract in 
determining whether they are required to perform quality assurance 
oversight. If the contract states that inspection and acceptance will 
be at destination, then DCMA does not perform any quality assurance 
oversight. End users within military units, such as Army battalions and 
Air Force squadrons, perform inspection and acceptance for these 
contracts.

Questions have been raised about the efficiency of DCMA's quality 
assurance oversight program. In October 2003, the DOD Inspector General 
reported that of the 518 contracts requiring DCMA source inspection 
that they reviewed, at least 172 of the inspections provided either 
nominal or no value to the DOD quality assurance process.[Footnote 6] 
The DOD Inspector General also pointed out concerns in the DOD quality 
assurance program, including (1) ambiguity in the level and extent of 
requested source inspections; (2) inconsistent and unclear application 
of items defined as critical or having a critical application; 
(3) inconsistent implementation of inspection procedures for items 
considered commercial, off-the-shelf; and (4) arbitrary and 
inconsistent inspection procedures for items purchased from 
distributors.

DCMA Provided Quality Assurance Oversight and Enforcement over 
Contractors:

In our review of 15 contracts awarded to 11 contractors, DCMA provided 
quality assurance oversight and enforcement over these spare parts 
prime contractors. DCMA used three types of inspections to perform 
quality assurance oversight over the contractors. DCMA adhered to the 
Federal Acquisition Regulation, contract quality requirements, and DCMA 
guidance in providing quality assurance oversight over these prime 
contractors. Federal Acquisition Regulation clauses included in the 
contracts guide whether or not DCMA would perform quality assurance 
oversight. DCMA provides oversight for those contracts requiring 
inspection at the place of manufacture of the parts. Enforcement of 
spare parts quality and safety during the production process was 
achieved through the issuance of corrective action requests.

DCMA Used Three Types of Inspections to Perform Quality Assurance 
Oversight over Contractors:

DCMA quality assurance specialists followed established policies, 
procedures, and guidance in performing their oversight over the spare 
parts prime contractors in our review. As shown in table 1, the quality 
assurance specialists performed one or a combination of three types of 
inspections over prime contractors. The three types of inspections 
include: physical inspection to measure the dimensions of parts or to 
test the parts; process reviews; or an observation of the kind, count, 
and condition of the parts. At 7 of the 11 contractor locations , DCMA 
quality assurance specialists performed both process reviews and 
physical inspections.

[End of table]

For physical inspection of spare parts, the quality assurance 
specialist selects a sample of the parts from various production runs 
and inspects them by comparing the parts to a specification, drawing, 
or other instruction. For example, at one location, the prime 
contractor had procured the part from a subcontractor and required the 
subcontractor to provide test data related to the part. The quality 
assurance specialist reviewed the test data and compared it to the part 
specifications. Also, the quality assurance specialist inspected the 
number imprinted on the parts, exterior painting, and workmanship of 
the received parts to ensure they complied with contract 
specifications.

The second type of inspection involves evaluating the prime 
contractors' processes to determine compliance with established 
contract requirements and production procedures. During these 
inspections the quality assurance specialist assesses the prime 
contractor's processes and production line procedures in relation to 
established industry practices and provides the contractor an early 
opportunity to make corrections or improvements, if necessary. For 
example, at one prime contractor location, the quality assurance 
specialist monitored the prime contractor's key processes during the 
production, including the cleaning, painting, welding, and final 
quality inspection of the product. To help ensure a comprehensive 
quality assurance check, the quality assurance specialist performed his 
daily quality checks at different phases of the production process. 
Also, the quality assurance specialist reviewed the prime contractor's 
procedures for selecting its subcontractors to determine if the 
subcontractors were certified in accordance with the applicable 
industry standards.

The third type of inspection consists of observing the kind, count, and 
condition of the parts. Observation of the kind of part includes visual 
identification of at least one part for each different part being 
procured under the contract and verifying the part number against the 
number required in the contract. Counting the parts involves visual 
confirmation of the contents of one package per line item and counting 
the number of packages received. The quality assurance specialists 
verify the physical appearance of the parts to assess their condition. 
For example, at one location, the quality assurance specialist 
performed a kind, count, and condition inspection to confirm that the 
contractor had the correct part by verifying the part number, checking 
to ensure the contractor had the proper quantity of parts, and 
inspecting the outward appearance of the parts.

DCMA Adhered to the Federal Acquisition Regulation, Contract Quality 
Requirements, and DCMA Guidance in Providing Quality Assurance 
Oversight over Prime Contractors:

DCMA's quality assurance oversight over the 11 spare parts prime 
contractors in our review was in accordance with the Federal 
Acquisition Regulation, contract quality requirements, and DCMA's One 
Book guidance. Each contract we reviewed designated the location of 
inspection and acceptance by contract line item. Contracts that were 
designated for inspection and acceptance at the contractor's place of 
manufacture and production received DCMA quality assurance oversight. 
When contracts are designated for inspection and acceptance at the 
receiving location for the parts, the end user is responsible for 
inspecting the procured part and the DCMA quality assurance specialist 
typically does not get involved with the contract.

Of the 15 contracts we reviewed, DCMA provided quality assurance 
oversight for the 13 contracts that were designated for inspection and 
acceptance at source. The other two contracts were designated for 
inspection and acceptance at destination and did not require DCMA 
quality assurance oversight. In accordance with the One Book guidance, 
quality assurance specialists performed inspections and acceptance for 
its customers to ensure supplies were in compliance with contract 
requirements. According to a DCMA official, this guidance allows DCMA 
quality assurance specialists flexibility in providing quality 
assurance oversight over prime contractors. For example, the guidance 
does not include standard requirements for the number of tests, site 
visits, or inspections that the DCMA quality assurance specialists 
should perform while providing quality assurance oversight. When 
contracts were designated for inspection and acceptance at source, 
quality assurance specialists typically reviewed contract 
requirements, assessed the contractor's risks of producing 
nonconforming parts, determined what needed to be done to mitigate the 
risks, and applied quality assurance oversight, including inspections, 
based on the contractor's risk level.

Enforcement of Spare Parts Quality and Safety during the Production 
Process Was Achieved through Corrective Action Requests:

During the production process, when a prime contractor's processes or 
spare parts did not meet contract requirements, DCMA used an 
enforcement system that involved issuing requests for corrective action 
by the prime contractor. According to the Federal Acquisition 
Regulation, contractors must be given an opportunity to correct or 
replace nonconforming supplies. Contractors are notified about 
nonconformance through corrective action requests issued by DCMA or 
product quality deficiency reports issued by the end user. When there 
is contractual nonconformance during the production process, DCMA may 
issue the prime contractor a corrective action request to formally 
communicate the deficiency and request corrective action on the part of 
the prime contractor. When the prime contractor does not take 
corrective actions, contractual remedies available to procuring 
contracting officers include suspension of progress payments, 
termination for default, and penalties such as suspension or debarment 
from holding contracts with the government.

Only 2 of the 11 prime contractors that we reviewed received corrective 
action requests related to the contracts in our review. According to 
DCMA officials, the remaining contractors did not warrant corrective 
action requests related to the contracts we reviewed. Our review of 
DCMA files related to these contractors also did not identify any need 
for corrective actions by the prime contractors. Corrective actions 
identified by the two contractors involved the prime contractor making 
corrections or changes to its production processes and demonstrating 
how processes would be improved to prevent further instances of 
nonconformance. For example, DCMA issued a corrective action request to 
a prime contractor identifying loose insulation, an inactive gear, poor 
painting quality, and parts that did not meet surface finish 
specification requirements as nonconforming items. The prime contractor 
corrected the nonconformance and DCMA accepted the product. To prevent 
reoccurrence of the deficiencies, the prime contractor reported that it 
had taken the following actions: (1) discontinued the use of material 
that caused the loose insulation, (2) instructed operators to ensure 
that gears were properly adjusted, (3) arranged a meeting with all 
contractor paint personnel advising them on the importance of attention 
to detail, and (4) agreed to provide their quality assurance 
representatives with acceptable and unacceptable finish samples as 
visual standards to meet customer expectations.

For the other prime contractor, DCMA issued a corrective action request 
because the contractor used the wrong procedure to receive approval for 
a major waiver from contract requirements.[Footnote 7] The request for 
major waiver was supposed to go through an array of signatures and DCMA 
approvals, whereas a minor waiver could be submitted and approved 
electronically, requiring fewer signatures and approvals. However, the 
prime contractor downgraded the waiver request from major to minor 
without the appropriate concurrence and approval of DCMA and submitted 
the request through the electronic system. According to the prime 
contractor, their personnel had conflicting procedures describing how 
to process waivers. To prevent reoccurrence of incorrect processing of 
major waivers, the contractor planned to review its current procedures 
for processing waivers. Also, the contractor planned to train its 
quality assurance staff to ensure they understand the correct 
procedures for processing waivers.

Prime Contractors Adhered to Industry Standards in Providing Quality 
Assurance Oversight over Subcontractors:

The prime contractors in our review adhered to industry standards in 
providing quality assurance oversight over their subcontractors' work. 
Based on industry standards, prime contractors performed at least two 
or up to four methods to provide quality assurance oversight over their 
subcontractors, as shown in table 2. The primary methods of oversight 
used were evaluating subcontractors for placement on an Approved 
Supplier List and requiring certifications of parts and processes. 
Industry standards, such as the International Organization for 
Standardization 9001 and Aerospace Standards 9100, require that an 
organization have a quality management system in place to ensure that 
it will produce high quality products that will serve their intended 
purpose. The standards are broad and are intended to be applicable to 
all organizations, regardless of type, size, and product provided.

All of the prime contractors that we reviewed evaluated potential 
subcontractors prior to the contract award for placement on their 
Approved Supplier List. The purpose of establishing an Approved 
Supplier List is to identify qualified subcontractors capable of 
producing needed parts or processes in accordance with industry 
standards and contractual specifications. When evaluating a potential 
subcontractor for inclusion on their Approved Supplier List, some prime 
contractors periodically visited their subcontractors' production 
facilities, requested that subcontractors complete surveys containing 
questions regarding the subcontractors' capabilities and 
qualifications necessary to produce parts and processes, or examined 
information about the technical skills and qualifications of 
subcontractor personnel, past performance for producing similar 
products, and applicable certifications related to the subcontractors' 
operations. Six of the 11 prime contractors said they periodically 
visited potential subcontractors prior to contract award.

All of the prime contractors that we reviewed required certifications 
such as independent, third-party certifications or certificates of 
conformance from their subcontractors to certify that their parts and 
processes are in accordance with contract requirements and industry 
standards.[Footnote 8] Independent, third-party certifications and 
certificates of conformance served as verification that the 
subcontractors could produce parts and processes that conformed to 
contractual specifications. Prime contractors required certifications 
from their subcontractors for different phases of the production 
process. For example, one contractor used steel to fabricate parts and 
required a certification from the steel subcontractor that the steel 
had been produced according to specifications. In this instance, the 
prime contractor did not use the steel provided by the subcontractor 
until they received the certificate of conformance verifying that the 
product was in accordance with industry standards and contractual 
requirements.

Eight of the 11 prime contractors we reviewed periodically tested parts 
or processes produced by their subcontractors. Prime contractors tested 
the subcontractors' parts or processes at either the manufacturing site 
or the receiving point to determine whether products or processes met 
contractual specifications. For example, one prime contractor performed 
mechanical and electrical tests on all materials received from 
subcontractors to ensure that the materials met contract 
specifications. If the materials did not meet contract specifications, 
the prime contractor's review board, which included the government 
quality assurance specialist, made a determination concerning the 
disposition of the materials. Disposition options included using the 
material "as is" or scrapping it.

Seven of the prime contractors that we reviewed tracked and monitored 
the performance of their subcontractors by establishing performance 
goals, assessing and rating the subcontractors' performance, or 
recommending corrective and preventive actions when subcontractors 
produced nonconforming parts. The seven prime contractors established 
performance goals and rated their subcontractors on a routine and 
periodic basis using various performance metrics, such as product 
quality and on-time deliveries. For example, one contractor kept track 
of the number of nonconforming parts provided by each subcontractor in 
relation to the total number of parts provided. When a subcontractor's 
nonconformance rate exceeded the prime contractor's acceptable goal, 
the prime contractor placed the subcontractor on probation.

DCMA Held Prime Contractors Accountable by Requiring Adherence to 
Contract Clauses:

In our review of the 15 contracts, DCMA held prime contractors 
accountable for overseeing their subcontractors' work by requiring that 
prime contractors adhered to contract clauses concerning oversight 
responsibility. When instances of nonconformance were reported through 
product quality deficiency reports, the DCMA quality assurance 
personnel and the prime contractor determined if the deficiency was due 
to contractor nonconformance and assigned responsibility for corrective 
action. For the 15 contracts we reviewed, one deficiency was determined 
to be the responsibility of the prime contractor and DCMA held the 
prime contractor accountable for the part. During our review, service 
officials provided us with examples of other contracts in which 
nonconforming parts reached end users. DCMA followed its procedures for 
evaluating the causes of these nonconforming parts. The reasons for the 
nonconformance varied for each part.

Most of the 15 contracts we reviewed included Federal Acquisition 
Regulation clause 52.246-2, Inspection of Supplies--Fixed Price, which 
states that the prime contractor shall tender to the government for 
acceptance only supplies that have been inspected in accordance with 
the inspection system and found by the contractor to be in conformity 
with contract requirements. This contract clause also states that the 
contractor is not relieved of its oversight responsibility when 
government quality assurance over subcontractors is required. The 
remaining contracts included other quality clauses or did not specify 
quality requirements because the contractors had quality systems that 
had been previously approved by the procuring contracting officers.

DCMA also performed reviews of subcontractors' certifications to the 
prime contractor that the parts and processes produced by the 
subcontractor were manufactured in accordance with the contract 
requirements. DCMA quality assurance specialists periodically reviewed 
third-party certifications and contractors' documents related to site 
visits, receiving inspections, and other oversight of subcontractors. 
These reviews provided a technique for DCMA to determine whether the 
contractors' quality assurance systems were adequate for oversight of 
subcontractors. For example, at one contractor location, the quality 
assurance specialist obtained copies of certifications that steel was 
produced and heat-treated in accordance with standards. The specialist 
also reviewed copies of test records maintained by the contractor 
during the production process.

After parts are provided to end users within military units, such as 
Army battalions and Air Force squadrons, instances of nonconforming 
parts are reported through product quality deficiency reports. End 
users issue product quality deficiency reports to identify deficiencies 
in parts that may indicate nonconformance with contractual or 
specification requirements. When the end user identifies a 
nonconforming product, the user issues a product quality deficiency 
report that is sent to the applicable DCMA contract management office 
and distributed to the quality assurance specialist responsible for 
overseeing the contractor that produced the item. The quality assurance 
specialist notifies the contractor of the report. The contractor may 
request that the part be returned to its facility for testing to 
determine whether the problem that has been identified by the user can 
be duplicated. The DCMA quality assurance specialist and the prime 
contractor also determine if the deficiency was due to contractor 
nonconformance with contract requirements and assign responsibility for 
corrective action. DCMA writes the final disposition of the product 
quality deficiency report based on the results of the tests completed 
by the contractor and the assessment of who was responsible for the 
deficiency. In those cases where the deficiency was determined to be 
the responsibility of the prime contractor, DCMA held the prime 
contractor accountable for the part. If the cause of the deficiency was 
tied back to a subcontractor, DCMA held the prime contractor 
responsible for correcting the deficiency and ensuring that the 
subcontractor's processes were modified to correct the cause of the 
nonconformance.

During our review, service officials provided examples of other 
contracts in which nonconforming parts reached end users for various 
reasons. DCMA and prime contractors followed their procedures in 
evaluating causes for the nonconformance. For example, in March 2004 
one prime contractor was notified that five wiring harnesses, 
manufactured by one of their approved subcontractors, were defective. 
Investigations showed that the prime contractor's quality oversight 
system did not detect the problem because its personnel were unfamiliar 
with drawings, specifications, or electrical wiring harness 
fabrications. After the problem was identified, the prime contractor 
provided training related to drawings and proper manufacturing 
processes to its quality assurance personnel as well as subcontractor 
personnel. However, according to the prime contractor, the 
subcontractor still could not produce the wiring harnesses correctly. 
As a result, the prime contractor selected another subcontractor to 
manufacture the wiring harnesses.

In another case, the contract was for a survival kit that included 
critical safety items. The nonconformance related to an O-ring 
lubricant that was allowing oxygen pressure to be released prematurely. 
Based on the deficiency report, the contractor began using another 
lubricant for the O-ring that eliminated the problem. For this 
contract, DCMA recommended that government source inspection be added 
at the subcontractor level because no prior government source 
inspection was required.

Yet in another example, an axle component manufactured by a 
subcontractor broke on an aircraft landing gear because the dimensions 
of the axle component were incorrect. Incorrect dimensions resulted 
from the subcontractor's improper grinding process; yet, the 
subcontractor never reported the discrepancies to the prime contractor. 
Since the incident, the prime contractor has placed the subcontractor 
on probation within the prime contractor's quality approval system. The 
subcontractor will remain on probation until an audit is performed by 
the end users of the axle to verify that all corrective actions are in 
effect.

Concluding Observations:

DCMA and the prime contractors we reviewed utilized a number of 
processes to provide quality assurance oversight over the production of 
spare parts for the military. The processes included conducting 
physical inspections of parts produced by contractors, reviewing prime 
contractor's processes, evaluating potential subcontractors for 
placement on an Approved Supplier List, requiring certifications of 
parts and processes, testing parts and processes, and tracking and 
monitoring subcontractor's performance. These processes are founded 
upon contractual requirements, DCMA policies, and industry standards 
for quality assurance. In addition, there are enforcement procedures 
that DCMA uses when nonconforming spare parts reach end users. 
However, despite these quality assurance controls, some risk still 
exists. For example, while we did not identify any major deficiencies 
from the contracts and practices we reviewed, service officials 
provided examples of nonconforming parts related to contracts not 
included in our review that reached end users for various reasons. 
Furthermore, given the vast number of contracts and contractors 
involved in providing spare parts to the government, we recognize that 
the risk of nonconforming spare parts reaching end users exists. 
Compliance by contractors, DCMA, and other DOD agencies with 
established internal controls helps mitigate against this risk.

Appendix I: Scope and Methodology:

To address our objectives, we judgmentally selected for review 
11 contracts awarded to 11 prime contractors. During the course of our 
review, Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) and the prime 
contractors provided four additional contracts awarded to some of these 
same contractors that had nonconforming parts that reached end users, 
bringing the total number of contracts we reviewed to 15. Given the 
small number of contracts we reviewed, our results cannot be used to 
make inferences about the entire population of contracts requiring 
government quality assurance. We included the following kinds of 
contracts as candidates for our study: contracts, purchase orders, 
basic ordering agreements, delivery orders against existing contracts, 
and contract modifications for existing contracts. We included 
contracts that were large and small dollar value, from DCMA's East and 
West regions, and from the Army, Navy, Air Force, and the Defense 
Logistics Agency (DLA). Eleven of these contracts were judgmentally 
selected: three from information provided by the Navy and Air Force on 
nonconforming parts and 8 from DCMA. To select the eight contracts, we 
obtained a query from DCMA's Mechanization of Contract Administration 
Services system of contracts for October 1, 1999, through September 30, 
2003. Because of the large number of contracts in the database and 
because we wished to examine recent contract quality assurance 
oversight practices, we sorted the query to only identify contracts for 
fiscal year 2003. From this query, we sorted the contracts into four 
groups according to whether they were associated with the Army, the 
Navy, the Air Force, or the Defense Logistics Agency. We randomly 
sampled contracts from each of these four groups. Then, we judgmentally 
selected a subset of contracts from our random samples in such a way to 
obtain a set of eight contracts that spanned the various military 
commands and DCMA's East and West regions. The breakout of the eight 
contracts included three Army, two Air Force, two Navy, and one Defense 
Logistics Agency.

To assess the reliability of data from DCMA's Mechanization of Contract 
Administration Services system we (1) performed electronic testing of 
required data elements, (2) reviewed existing information about the 
data and the system, and (3) interviewed agency officials knowledgeable 
about the data. We determined DCMA's Mechanization of Contract 
Administration Services system data to be reliable for the purposes of 
our review.

To assess whether DCMA provided quality assurance oversight and 
enforcement over its spare parts prime contractors in accordance with 
established policies, procedures, and guidance, we compared contract 
quality assurance provisions and requirements to oversight actions 
performed by DCMA for the 15 contracts. Specifically, we reviewed the 
Federal Acquisition Regulation, the DCMA One Book, and the contracts to 
determine quality assurance oversight responsibilities and enforcement 
actions available to assure contractor compliance. We compared these 
policies, procedures, and contract requirements to the three types of 
inspections performed by DCMA quality assurance specialists to assess 
if DCMA provided appropriate oversight. For each of the contracts, we 
met with officials at the DCMA contract management offices identified 
on the contracts to determine quality assurance oversight actions 
performed by DCMA personnel. As part of this assessment, we determined 
which of the three types of inspections were performed for each 
contractor. We sent letters to officials at the DOD contracting offices 
to obtain and review documentation related to the pre-award process, 
quality assurance requirements, and the contracting officers' 
interaction with DCMA prior to contract award. In assessing whether 
DCMA used enforcement actions, we reviewed the product quality 
deficiency reports included in our review to determine if DCMA levied 
enforcement actions against the prime contractor when necessary. We 
also reviewed prior DOD and GAO reports related to DCMA's execution of 
its quality assurance oversight over prime contractors and DOD's 
implementation of its deficiency reporting system.

To assess whether prime contractors provided quality assurance 
oversight over their subcontractors' work related to producing spare 
parts and followed industry standards and contract requirements, we 
identified prime contractor quality assurance oversight actions 
performed over subcontractors. We reviewed Aerospace Standard 9100 and 
prime contractor quality manuals to determine requirements for 
establishing contractor quality management systems and ensuring that 
their subcontractors are providing quality parts.[Footnote 9] We 
visited and interviewed representatives at the prime contractor 
locations as shown in appendix II, and determined whether the prime 
contractors used subcontractors. For those that used subcontractors, we 
identified the level of quality assurance oversight performed by these 
prime contractors over the subcontractors. We discussed whether the 
prime contractors performed supplier ratings of their subcontractors, 
tested parts or processes provided by their subcontractors, or 
conducted site visits at their subcontractors' facilities. At the prime 
contractor facilities, we observed the prime contractors' processes for 
manufacturing or repairing parts to determine the quality assurance 
performed by the prime contractor throughout the production process.

To assess how DCMA held prime contractors accountable for the work of 
their subcontractors, we reviewed the 15 contracts to determine if the 
contracts included clauses holding the prime contractor responsible for 
the spare parts provided to the government and whether instances of 
nonconformance had occurred. For the reported instances of 
nonconformance, we looked at whether DCMA held the prime contractor 
responsible for correcting the nonconformance and what types of actions 
were performed by DCMA. We also reviewed the Federal Acquisition 
Regulation to determine contract clauses that require the prime 
contractor to ensure that parts furnished to the government conform to 
contract requirements. We reviewed the contracts to determine if they 
included clauses that the prime contractor was responsible for the 
spare parts being provided.

We also visited or obtained information from representatives at the 
following organizations:

* U.S. Air Force, Office of the Assistant Secretary, Contracting 
Operations Division, Rosslyn, Va;

* U.S. Air Force Materiel Command, Wright Patterson Air Force Base, 
Ohio;

Dear Mr. Solis:

This is the Department of Defense (DoD) response to the GAO draft 
report, GAO-05-73, "DEFENSE INVENTORY: DoD and Prime Contractors 
Adhered to Requirements in Selected Contracts for Overseeing Spare 
Parts Quality," dated November 10, 2004 (Code 350460). The draft report 
did not contain any recommendations for the DoD.

Page 7 of the report discussed the DoD Inspector General (DoDIG) audit 
regarding source inspection performed in 2003 and states that the DoDIG 
"pointed out weaknesses in the management of DCMA's inspection 
program." The DoDIG report highlighted concerns with DoD at the program 
office, procurement activity, and quality assurance activity levels and 
did not isolate weaknesses with DCMA activities.

Therefore, the DoD recommends that the text "...pointed out weaknesses 
in the management of DCMA's inspection program" be changed to 
"...pointed out concerns in the DoD quality assurance program."
