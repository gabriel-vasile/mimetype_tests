<h2>Appendix D - FY 2004 Federal Managers' Financial
Integrity Act Report on Systems and Controls</h2>

<p>The Federal Managers' Financial Integrity Act (FMFIA) requires agencies to provide an annual statement of assurance on the effectiveness of their management, administrative, and accounting controls (Section 2 of the Act), and financial management systems (Section 4 of the Act).  Significant deficiencies in internal controls are considered material weaknesses; significant deficiencies in financial management systems are considered material nonconformances.  The full text of the Secretary's assurance statement for FY 2004 can be found in the Secretary's Letter at the beginning of this report; the Sections 2 and 4 results are discussed in the following pages. At the end of FY 2004, the Secretary reported three material weaknesses and one material nonconformance.</p>

<p><b>Section 2 Material Weaknesses</b></p>
		 
<p>HHS reports three new Section 2 material weaknesses: 1) FISMA significant deficiency; 2) Departmental Payroll System , and 3) Departmental Financial Reporting.</p>

<p><i>Federal Information Systems Management Act (FISMA) Significant Deficiency (HHS-04-01)</i></p>

<p>In the Department's FY 2004 FISMA report to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), dated October 6, 2004, the OIG executive overview identified one "significant deficiency" at the Department level:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our FY 2004 FISMA evaluation determined that the Department has a significant deficiency in its information system security program relating to contingency planning and disaster recovery.  Our evaluation identified weaknesses in these areas at 11 of 13 HHS Agencies. For 6 HHS Agencies this was a repeat finding from a previous FISMA evaluation. "</p>

<p>Per OMB FY 2004 guidance, a significant deficiency under FISMA is to be reported as an FMFIA material weakness under Section 2.  HHS believes that although contingency planning and disaster recovery need to be addressed, this significant deficiency has little impact on day-to-day processing.  According to the HHS Chief Information Officer, this finding is not a statement that some particular system has been compromised, although the FISMA report notes a few areas of improvement and contains a list of things HHS needs to do better. OIG also reported that another component of the deficiency is the Medicare EDP controls, which has already been identified through the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) audit process. This is a repeat finding and is addressed separately as part of the one Section 4 material nonconformance discussed below.</p>  

<p>The FISMA report contains a corrective action plan to address these findings and includes a target date of September 30, 2005 for completing corrective action.  However, due to FISMA confidentiality requirements, FISMA report findings are not published and therefore a detailed corrective action plan is not included in this published FMFIA report.</p>

<p><i>Departmental Payroll System (HHS-04-02)</i></p>

<p>The auditors found that there are significant deficiencies in the Departmental Payroll System that could result in misstatements to payroll-account balances and the Commission Corp liability, improper payments, release of sensitive data, and reduced controls over safeguarding of assets.</p>

<p>The Department is committed to putting any necessary remedial or preventive mechanisms in place to improve our audit standing.  However, there are some areas where reasonable explanations were provided to findings and these areas may not change.  We fully embrace having solid oversight responsibilities for payroll and personnel and have already implemented procedures and processes that address many of the concerns discovered during our massive data cleanup efforts.  We believe that our efforts in the HR consolidation, implementing Department wide automated HR systems, and the transition to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service scheduled for March 2005 will enhance our ability to have a solid payroll system.</p> 

<p><i>Departmental Financial Reporting (HHS-04-03)</i></p>

<p>The auditors found that the department lacks a coordinated process among cross-functional teams of finance, operations and legal personnel to monitor business activities to identify situations where accounting evaluation or decision-making may be necessary.    The issue that gave rise to this problem is that HHS had a significant policy issue at the end of FY '04 that had a material impact on its financial statements. This issue was below the materiality threshold in prior years.</p>

<p>In response to the auditor's findings, HHS is taking the following actions.  HHS will:  (1) appoint a single point of contact (POC) within the HHS CFO's office responsible for early identification and resolution of significant policy issues that have an impact on HHS financial statements; (2) strengthen its existing CFO Quarterly Meetings with OPDIV CFOs at the Department level to ensure coordination among cross-functional teams of finance, operations, and legal personnel to identify significant programmatic activities that may impact the quarterly and annual financial statements; (3) hold OPDIV CFOs accountable for ensuring that programmatic and related legal issues are promptly identified and communicated to the HHS CFO POC; and 4) engage the active participation of OMB officials in the resolution of any significant policy issues. </p>

		
<p><b>Section 4 Material Nonconformance</b></p>

<p>At the end of FY 2004, HHS reported one Section 4 nonconformance, Financial Systems and Processes  (HHS 00-01). This finding comprised three component findings: the Department-wide audit finding, and the two separate audit findings at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) -- Financial Systems Analysis and Oversight (CMS 01-01) and Medicare EDP [electronic data processing] Controls (CMS 01-02). Implementation of the Unified Financial Management System (UFMS) will provide the long-term solution to these problems and eliminate the Section 4 nonconformance by the end of FY 2006. As part of the Financial Analysis and Oversight component finding the auditors also determined that internal controls over the Managed Care program need to be improved.  The auditors disclosed that there was a lack of and/or inconsistent documentation to evidence the on-going monitoring and oversight reviews of the Managed Care program.</p>  

<p>HHS auditors have cited the Department's lack of an integrated accounting system as a material weakness and a specific impediment in preparing timely financial reports and statements.  As part of Secretary Thompson's "One HHS" approach to managing the Department, HHS is developing and implementing an integrated UFMS to provide for Department-wide financial reporting.  UFMS will generate interim and annual financial statements, as well as other required external and internal financial reports.  UFMS consists of two primary components: the Health Care Integrated General Ledger System (HIGLAS), dedicated to CMS, and the second dedicated to the rest of HHS.  FY 2005 will see a significant achievement for the UFMS effort.  By the end of the year the system will be deployed at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Business and Research Support System (NBRSS) has already been "stood up" and the HIGLAS will have been deployed at eight of the largest CMS Medicare contractors.  This level of deployment will not comply with the requirements of the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act (FFMIA).  The Department will not meet this level of materiality of financial operations until the end of FY 2006.</p>

<p>In the short term, HHS Agencies have continued to make substantial progress in addressing account analysis and reconciliation problems that contribute to the Department's FMFIA Section 4 nonconformance.</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>NIH has implemented numerous additional analyses and reconciliations; a new, more disciplined and controlled process to prepare the trial balances from which NIH financial statements are prepared; and has identified additional areas of potential improvement on which NIH has already begun work.  Also, NIH plans to validate or change certain internal processes and provide significant training to staff.  This effort will result in benefits to accounting operations and to the administrative operations of Institutes and Centers. The Office of Financial Management, working with the NIH Center for Information Technology, has implemented a new web-based tool that allows staff to analyze all general ledger accounts individually and by transaction codes online.  This has allowed NIH to correct and compensate for some of the deficiencies noted by auditors.  The information is more reliable and available in a timely manner for review and reporting.</p></li>

	<li><p>CDC conducts periodic reviews, as well as monthly and quarterly reconciliations. CDC created the trial balance and financial statements offline using a manually-intensive process, which required excessive resources and increased the chance of error.  The new UFMS will eliminate this material weakness by generating financial statements without the manually-intensive process.</p></li>  

	<li><p>Auditors reported in their FY 2004 CMS audit report that, overall, the Medicare contractors continue to significantly improve the maintenance of supporting records for financial activities and year end balances.  However, the lack of an integrated financial management system continues to impair CMS and its Medicare contractors' abilities to efficiently and effectively support and analyze accounts receivable and other reported financial balances on a timely basis.  The CMS long-range plan to address this material weakness is to implement, including Medicare contractors, a Joint Financial Management Improvement Program-approved integrated general ledger accounting software package.</p></li>

	<li><p>Managed Care Program -- CMS central office has revised its Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) regarding the Managed Care program and has posted the SOP on the Intranet.  The Preferred Provider Organization Demonstration Guide was completed June 2004, and the Health Care Pre-payment Plans Guide was revised and completed in June 2004.  The attestation module in the Health Plan Management System has been completed and is operational.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>CMS also continues to make substantial progress on mitigating the EDP control weaknesses and has revised its target for completing the related corrective action to FY 2006.  CMS reports that the material weakness for the Medicare EDP controls is very complex involving approximately 33 contracts with the fiscal intermediaries and carriers who process claims using 16 data centers.  Because of this complexity, resolution of the material weakness will take time and resources. The long-term strategy in eliminating the material weakness is rooted in the CMS modernization initiative that will further improve HHS' security posture. The President's budget for FY 2005 includes funding for information technology modernization.  A more secure system environment is a key component of the IT modernization plan.  CMS is implementing its plan using a two-track policy for security.  On the first track, CMS is aggressively taking reasonable and appropriate remedial steps to close the highest risk vulnerabilities.  These actions are reflected in HHS' Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) report.  On the second complementary track, CMS is building security into the agency's modernized infrastructure through capital investments targeted to reduce its security perimeter. CMS will limit its exposure to risk through such preemptive measures as data center consolidation and simplifying application development in a way that leaves less opportunity for exploitation than is the case in the current highly complex systems environment.  To reinforce this further, CMS' Information Services Modernization Implementation Strategy includes security components for application modernization, data modernization, and infrastructure modernization.  The CMS' main effort is on building a secure infrastructure versus managing corrective actions.  CMS intends to be proactive in managing IT modernization and will address all audit results as part of the POA&M report process.</p>

                     <b>Summary of
                     Corrective Action Approach:</b> HHS
                     has made significant changes to its human resources
                     operation in response to the President&rsquo;s Management
                     Agenda (PMA). It was one of the first
                     agencies to embrace the e-Gov e-Payroll initiative to
                     consolidate to four payroll providers. As part of
                     this initiative, in FY 2001, HHS established a goal
                     of consolidating its human resources services activities.
                     Beginning in FY 2002, several of our Operating Divisions
                     internally consolidated their human resources function to
                     a single office. The final step in the
                     consolidation took place in January 2004, when we
                     established the Human Resources Centers
                     (HRCs). The recent implementation of this
                     consolidation was designed to consolidate more than 40
                     decentralized HR offices into 4 HR service centers. This
                     initiative has helped us recognize the need for
                     improvement in our HR operations to include more training,
                     periodic review of how our systems interface, and
                     establishment of consistent processes and policies across
                     the Department.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                     As we move forward in
                     these areas, our human resources staff are also devoting
                     an enormous amount of time to other efforts. For
                     example, of primary concern is the transition of payroll
                     services to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service
                     (DFAS), which is scheduled for March 2005.
                     Additionally, the Electronic Official Personnel Folders
                     (eOPF) project is scheduled for implementation from
                     December 2004 - September 2005
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     These initiatives
                     (i.e., HR consolidation, transition to DFAS, and migration
                     to the eOPF) have focused our attention on several issues
                     we need to address before the transition to DFAS and
                     eOPF. We are also committed to putting any necessary
                     remedial or preventive mechanisms in place to improve our
                     audit standing. However, there are some areas where
                     reasonable explanations were provided to findings and
                     these areas may not change. We fully embrace having
                     solid oversight responsibilities for payroll and personnel
                     and have already implemented procedures and processes that
                     address many of the concerns discovered during our massive
                     data cleanup efforts. We believe that our efforts in
                     the HR consolidation, implementing Department wide
                     automated HR systems, and the DFAS transition will enhance
                     our ability to have a solid payroll system.

                     Accelerated
                     government-wide financial reporting requirements include
                     the fact that policy decisions that have an impact on
                     agency financial statements are to be resolved by Federal
                     agencies timely to ensure that audited financial
                     statements are issued timely and within federal
                     requirements.&nbsp; In order to meet these requirements,
                     HHS policy officials need to develop a more effective
                     approach for the early identification and resolution of
                     significant policy issues that have an impact on HHS
                     financial statements.&nbsp; This approach should include
                     coordination early and throughout the process with
                     appropriate officials both within and outside HHS.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                     The issue that gave
                     rise to this problem is that HHS had a significant policy
                     issue at the end of FY &rsquo;04 that had a material
                     impact on its financial statements. This issue was below
                     the materiality threshold in prior years. As a result, the
                     HHS auditors found that the Department lacks a coordinated
                     process among cross-functional teams of finance,
                     operations, and legal personnel to monitor business
                     activities and identify situations where accounting
                     evaluation or decision-making may be necessary; and that
                     no structured process exists to communicate potential loss
                     contingencies to legal or accounting personnel.&nbsp;
                     Further, the auditors found that upon identification of
                     potential loss contingencies, no rational, structured
                     process exists to ensure timely resolution of accounting
                     questions by appropriate personnel.&nbsp; This condition
                     could also impact the ability to rely on financial
                     reporting from other OPDIVs or HHS as a whole.

                     One of the

                     appropriate polices, procedures and protocol, including
                     clearly assigning responsibility, to address situations or
                     transactions that require cross-functional involvement in
                     determining accounting-related estimates.&nbsp; The
                     financial management function should coordinate and
                     facilitate the involvement of the other cross functional
                     units whose input are important factors in formulating the
                     amount of the estimate.

                     The Department
                     continues to have serious internal control weaknesses in
                     its financial systems and processes for producing
                     financial statements.&nbsp; The FY 2003 CFO audit and the
                     FMFIA Report reflected a material non-conformance
                     Department-wide under the FFMIA, which was reclassified in
                     FY 2001 under Section 4 of the FMFIA as Financial Systems
                     and Processes&nbsp; (HHS-00-01). This finding combined the
                     Department-wide audit finding with the audit findings at
                     CMS.&nbsp; CMS&rsquo; FY 2003 financial statements audit
                     revealed the same two material weaknesses as in the FY
                     2002 audit, specifically: Financial Systems and Analysis
                     (CMS-01-01) and Medicare EDP Controls (CMS 01-02). For
                     NIH, the auditors concluded that NIH financial systems,
                     including mixed systems, do not fully conform to all
                     government-wide standards required by OMB Circular A-127,
                     <i>Financial Management Systems</i>. For CDC, the FY 2003
                     audit reported that CDC&rsquo;s financial system did not
                     have the capability to generate financial
                     statements.

                     contractors will be using HIGLAS).&nbsp; Implementation of
                     UFMS in accordance with approved implementation plan will
                     allow HHS to comply with the FFMIA/FMFIA by the end of FY
                     2006. OMB, as a result of its review of key UFMS planning
                     documents and discussions with HHS officials, recognized
                     in its quarterly progress reports for the
                     President&rsquo;s Management Agenda (PMA) that the
                     Department&rsquo;s current PMA financial management
                     "status&rdquo; could improve when the UFMS is
                     substantially implemented at the end of FY 2006 and this
                     nonconformance is resolved or downgraded to a reportable
                     condition.&nbsp; In the short term, account analysis and
                     reconciliations are helping to mitigate systems
                     weaknesses.&nbsp; Full UFMS/HIGLAS implementation is
                     expected in FY 2007.

                     ongoing monitoring and oversight reviews of the Managed
                     Care program.&nbsp; For the Medicaid and the State
                     Children&#39;s Health Insurance Programs, the auditors
                     also found that CMS needs to improve its communication
                     processes and procedures to prevent financial statements
                     from being issued that are materially misstated.

                     <b>Brief Description
                     of Corrective Action Plan:</b> While
                     CMS has made significant improvements in financial
                     reporting, the long-term solution to this material
                     weakness is HIGLAS.&nbsp; Until this system is
                     implemented, CMS will continue projects and activities
                     aimed at compensating for the lack of the modernized
                     system.&nbsp; Until this system can be fully implemented,
                     CMS will continue to implement short-term corrective
                     actions, as outlined in its CFO&rsquo;s <i>Comprehensive
                     Plan for Financial Management</i>, to address this
                     material weakness.&nbsp; The four key financial management
                     objectives of this plan are to:&nbsp; (1) improve
                     financial reporting, guidance, and oversight by providing
                     timely, reliable, and accurate financial information that
                     will enable CMS managers and other decision makers to make
                     timely and accurate program and administrative decisions,
                     (2) design and implement effective financial management
                     systems that comply with FFMIA, (3) improve debt
                     collection and internal accounting operations, and (4)
                     validate key financial data to ensure its accuracy and
                     reliability.

                     office staff will follow up with all regional offices to

                     The financial
                     statement auditors reported that EDP control weaknesses at
                     CMS central office and the Medicare contractors exist in
                     the areas of entitywide security programs, logical and
                     physical access controls, application security development
                     and program change controls, systems software, and service
                     continuity planning and testing. The majority of the
                     weaknesses were noted at the Medicare contractors, rather
                     than the CMS central office. Audit procedures disclosed no
                     evidence of actual system compromise of security, but in
                     the aggregate the weaknesses identified were considered
                     material. The Department anticipates that this weakness
                     will carry over into FY 2006.

                     Accountability Report</i> was FY 2004.&nbsp; The reason
                     for the change in date is that the CMS modernization is
                     programmed to commence in FY 2004.&nbsp;

                     <b>Brief Description
                     of Corrective Action Plan:&nbsp;</b> The CMS recognizes the significance of security
                     measures regarding Medicare EDP issues as they relate to
                     the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of
                     sensitive Medicare data.&nbsp; CMS received funding in
                     August 2002 to mitigate the most vulnerable weaknesses at
                     the Medicare contractors and data centers.&nbsp; The
                     distribution based on risk analysis was to fund system
                     security plans for the contractor claims processing
                     systems, access controls, systems software, segregation of
                     duties, and service continuity.&nbsp; Funding decisions
                     were risk-based and business-driven.&nbsp; Additional
                     weaknesses were funded in FY 2004 through redistribution
                     of funds remaining from the initial FY 2002
                     distribution.&nbsp; The full implementation of the
                     modernization program will address issues contributing to
                     the material weakness.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     Primarily due to the
                     large size and complexity of the Medicare Fee-for-Service
                     claims processing system and number of data centers, the
                     completion dates will extend into FY 2006. The sheer
                     magnitude of the Medicare claims processing system,
                     encompassing 16 data centers and 33 entities that process
                     claims, coupled with the level of aggressive oversight,
                     guarantees that there will always be findings.&nbsp; The
                     issue is to keep these findings to a manageable number
                     with no critical vulnerabilities.

                     It is important to
                     note that funding has been requested and received for FY
                     2004 as part of the CMS Modernization initiative.&nbsp;
                     Additional funding is requested for FY 2005.&nbsp; The CMS
                     Modernization initiative is the long-term plan for
                     addressing these security issues, e.g., by reducing the
                     security perimeter through Medicare contractor reform and
                     data center consolidation.
