<h1>Chapter 7.  Occupational Health Review Process</h1>  
<hr>
<h2>7.1  Introduction</h2>

<p class="h025Indent">This chapter establishes a method for performing and documenting the 
results of Agency Occupational Health reviews and delineates requirements 
for biennial evaluations of major NASA HQ and field locations that occur 
on NASA property.  For purposes of the audit element of the review process, 
the OCHMO defines a requirement as a mandatory element for a program or 
function.  Requirements shall include NASA Policy Directives (NPDs), NASA 
Procedures and Requirements (NPRs) and other external regulations and 
consensus standards applicable to NASA.</p> 

<p class="h025Indent">The review process shall be comprehensive enough to provide Center 
Senior Management with a status of the effectiveness of their Center's 
programs.  By definition this must include the provision of sufficient 
resources commensurate with the Center's size, population, and mission to 
achieve and maintain desired effectiveness.</p>

<h2>7.2 Purpose</h2>

<p class="h025Indent">Regular reviews of medical and occupational health services are required 
to assure protection of  the health of the NASA workforce.  Biennial OCHMO 
reviews shall be designed to help the Agency identify and mitigate risk, 
provide a consistent, high level of health care to participants across the 
Agency and identify best practices and innovative solutions that provide 
greater operational effectiveness and efficiency. </p>

<p class="h025Indent">Occupational health (OH) reviews include a compliance audit component. 
They also provide an opportunity for open dialogue with Center personnel 
and are used as a forum to advocate for appropriate support for health-
related services. The Review Team provides technical help, guidance on best 
practices, support on Agency occupational health initiatives, and 
facilitates specialized training for emerging health threats or new 
requirements as needed to enhance the competency of health discipline 
employees.</p>

<p class="h025Indent">The OH components assessed shall include medical care provided at each 
Center's  Occupational Medicine Clinic (including emergency care capability 
and coordination with other departments, medical quality assurance, and 
health clinic environment of care); preventive health activities; the 
employee assistance program; federal workers' compensation; fitness 
facilities; industrial hygiene; health physics; sanitation and food safety 
programs; and medical aspects of other programs such as emergency 
preparedness and childcare facilities.</p>

<p class="h025Indent">During the alternate years, when a review is not conducted at a Center, 
the Center shall perform a self evaluation using criteria provided in the 
most recent occupational health review conducted at the Center, or some 
other approved equivalent methodology.  A record of areas reviewed, names 
of individual(s) conducting evaluations, dates and locations shall be 
retained on file at the host center. Each Center shall provide a self-
evaluation to the OCHMO  in the same month of the alternate year in which 
they are normally audited.  The Center report shall delineate areas of 
substantial improvement and/or degradation of their occupational health 
program.</p>

<h2>7.3  Process Description</h2>

<p class="h025Indent">Occupational health reviews shall compare Center policies, procedures, 
and practices to regulatory and other compliance requirements, agency 
policy requirements and consensus standards.  A written report shall be 
produced from the review findings and provided to the Center for response.  
The appropriate Mission Associate Administrator, Institutional Corporate 
Management, and Safety and Mission Assurance Directorates shall be 
appropriately copied for their reference of findings associated with 
health, environmental compliance and/or safety, respectively.  
Nonconformance findings shall be tracked to closure as further detailed 
below.</p>

<p class="h025Indent">Occupational health reviews shall begin with scheduling review dates 
with the Centers' occupational health Contracting Officer Technical 
Representative(s) (COTR) or their appointed representative.  The COTR or 
their representative shall act as the Centers' primary point of contact for 
the review process.  The schedule for the program surveys is as follows:</p>

<div class="h025Indent">
  <table align=center border="2" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#000000">
    <tr bordercolor="#000000" bgcolor="#99FFFF" align=center>

          <p>LaRC - June </p>
          <p>ARC - August </p>
          <p>DFRC - August </p>
      <p>WSTF - September </p></td>
      <td width="228" valign="top"><p>JPL - January </p>

          <p>WFF - May </p>
          <p>HQ - August </p>
      <p>MSFC - September </p></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p class="h025Indent">A letter shall be sent to the Center Director or Facility Manager, at 
least 60 days ahead of the review dates, announcing the upcoming review and 
requesting the associated support.  This shall be followed with an e-mail 
to the COTR containing the review questionnaires and a request for specific 
Center documentation.  The COTR shall distribute the requests to the Centers' 
occupational health representatives.  The Centers' occupational health 
representatives shall answer the questions.  The primary point of contact 
shall return the questionnaires to the OCHMO Review Team Leader via e-mail.  
The requested Center-specific documentation shall be returned to the OCHMO 
Review Team Leader, who will distribute it to the Review Team for their 
assessment prior to the Center review.</p>

<p class="h025Indent">The review shall begin with an in-briefing of the 
principals involved in the review process.  The Center shall provide 
multi-disciplinary coverage for the entire review period. The in-briefing 
shall provide a forum for an exchange of information and details regarding 
the review.  It shall also provide the Centers with current OHMS 
information that may affect them and provide feedback on previous review 
process improvements.  The in-briefing shall be an opportunity for the 
OHMS Review Team to offer expert information and advocacy while on site.  
The Centers shall present their top occupational health concerns and a 
status of any open or unresolved nonconformance findings from previous 
occupational health reviews at the in-briefing.</p>
<p class="h025Indent">After the in-briefing, each reviewer shall meet with 
their subject matter counterpart to clarify questionnaire answers, discuss 
Center occupational health programs and processes and plan area visits.  
Information shall be collected and verified through interviews, tours of 
work areas, observation of activities and the surrounding work environment 
and conditions, documentation of reviews, and record inspections.</p>
<p class="h025Indent">The out-briefing shall be presented to the Center 
Director or the Deputy as a verbal executive summary.  It shall focus on 
the strengths and weaknesses found during the review.  A written report 
shall be prepared within 45 days of out-briefing.</p>
<p class="h025Indent">The written report shall be a reiteration of the same 
issues expressed in the verbal executive summary, plus a detailed report of 
all review findings.  Centers shall have 45 days after receipt of the 
written report to reply to the OHMS Review Team Leader with a corrective 
action plan that addresses remedial actions for the non-conformance 
findings associated with the review process.</p>
<p class="h025Indent">Nonconformance findings shall be closed within 6 
months or as negotiated. The Center shall keep the OHMS Review Team Leader 
informed of the status of corrective action activities particularly if a 
delay is anticipated. Corrective actions shall only be "closed" when the 
anomalous condition associated with the non-conformance no longer exists.</p>

<p class="h025Indent">A re-visit to a Center to review the occupational 
health program, or portion thereof, shall be performed when important 
program elements are non-conforming or incomplete or if, in the opinion of 
the discipline reviewer and team leader, the program or a portion thereof, 
is sufficiently weak or degraded as to require a review before the next 
biennial review.  Follow-up review elements shall concentrate only on the 
deficient areas.</p>
<p class="h025Indent">Working documents, reports, and results shall be 
retained on file or in the Agency Health Electronic Database (AHED) for use 
and future examination.</p>
<p class="h025Indent">Findings shall be categorized as follows:</p>

<p class="h05Indent">Commendation: Best practices that far exceed 
requirements or are ingenious time or cost-saving solutions to problems.</p>

<p class="h05Indent">Recognition: Acknowledgement of significant 
improvements or progress toward Center occupational health program goals.</p>

<p class="h05Indent">Observation: A noteworthy comment such as a notation 
of a significant difference compared with other Centers' practices.  Such 
comments are neither positive nor negative in nature.</p>

<p class="h05Indent">Opportunity for Improvement: A condition that meets 
compliance requirements, but could be improved.  Opportunities for 
Improvement will be accompanied by "Recommendations" in the written report 
but are not required to be addressed in the Center's corrective action 
plan.</p>
<p class="h05Indent">Nonconformance: A divergence from a compliance 
requirement (Federal, State, local, NASA Agency, NASA Center, etc.) or 
consensus standard (ANSI, HACCP, NIOSH, NFPA, etc.). These findings 
require Center response in the corrective action plan.</p>
