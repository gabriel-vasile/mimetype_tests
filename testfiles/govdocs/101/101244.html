      Lab astrophysicist Peter Nugent, working with Adam Riess of the Space Telescope 
      Science Institute, used an IBM SP supercomputer at NERSC to analyze data 
      from an exploding star that had been caught once on purpose and twice by 
      accident by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope.<font face="Times,Times New Roman"> 
      <p>Nugent's analysis confirmed that SN 1997ff, with a redshift of 1.7, is 
        the oldest and most distant Type Ia supernova ever seen. Riess and Nugent 
        presented their findings at a press conference held at NASA headquarters 
        in Washington this Monday, April 2, where they discussed the importance 
        of their discovery for cosmology.</p>
      <p>&quot;This supernova is consistent with the cosmological model of an 
        accelerating universe, a universe mostly filled with dark energy,&quot; 
        Nugent says. &quot;It argues against the notion that observations of distant 
        Type Ia supernovae may be systematically distorted by intervening gray 
        dust or the chemical evolution of the universe.&quot;</p>

        Moreover, says Nugent, &quot;the supernova is so ancient that it allows 
        us to glimpse an era when matter in the universe was still relatively 
        dense and expansion was still slowing under the influence of gravity. 
        More recently the dark energy has begun to predominate and expansion has 
        started to speed up.&quot;</p>
      <b><i> 
      <p>The farthest candle</p>
      </i></b> 
      <p>Two international groups of astronomers and physicists - the Supernova 
        Cosmology Project, headquartered at Berkeley Lab and led by Saul Perlmutter 
        of the Physics Department, and the High-Z Supernova Search Team, led by 
        Brian P. Schmidt at the Australian National University - discovered the 
        accelerating expansion of the universe by using Type Ia supernovae as 
        &quot;standard candles&quot; to measure cosmological parameters.</p>
      <p>Type Ia spectra and light curves (their rising and falling brightness 
        over time) are all nearly alike, and they are bright enough to be seen 
        at very great distances. With a redshift (or z) of about 1.7, says Nugent, 
        &quot;supernova 1997ff is some 11.3 billion years old - much older and 
        much fainter than the previous record of z equal 1.2, which corresponds 
        to an age of about 9.8 billion years.&quot;</p>
      <p>He adds that a supernova at redshift 1.7 &quot;is too far away to have 
        been visible from the surface of the Earth. Only a space-based telescope 
        could have found it.&quot;</p>
      <p>Faint as it is, SN 1997ff is actually brighter than its extreme redshift 
        would suggest. &quot;This drives a stake through &#9;the heart of alternatives 
        to the accelerating universe,&quot; said University of Chicago cosmologist 
        Michael Turner at the NASA press conference.</p>
      <p>Because the theory of the accelerating universe is based on observations 
        that distant supernovae are dimmer and thus farther away than their redshifts 
        might otherwise suggest, some critics had suggested that maybe Type Ia 
        supernovae in the early universe were just dimmer to begin with, or that 
        some form of &quot;gray dust,&quot; like a neutral density filter on a 
        camera, filters their light and only makes them seem dim.</p>
      <p>But SN 1997ff dates from a time before acceleration, so early that the 
        expansion of the universe was still slowing under the influence of gravity. 
        Instead of being dimmer than expected, it is brighter, an effect that 
        rules out both gray dust filters and the inherent dimness of the most 
        ancient supernovae.</p>
      <b><i> 
      <p>The one that almost got away</p>
      </i></b> 
      <p>SN 1997ff was first found, on purpose, by Ron Gilliland of the Space 
        Telescope Science Institute and Mark Phillips of the Carnegie Institute 
        of Washington, during the last week of December 1997. Gilliland and Phillips 
        turned the Hubble Space Telescope on the same patch of sky recorded in 
        the renowned Hubble Deep Field of typical galaxies, looking for bright 
        spots which, after spurious or doubtful signals had been rigorously eliminated, 
        might prove to be supernovae. They found two good candidates.</p>
      <p>Gilliland and Phillips asked Nugent to help them determine what these 
        discoveries implied for the rate at which high-redshift supernovae might 
        occur in the universe as a whole. The three published a report in 1999 
        suggesting that one of their two candidates, SN 1997ff, was probably a 
        Type Ia with a redshift greater than z = 1.32. Because it had been observed 
        in only one range of frequencies, however, the uncertainties were too 
        great to use the supernova for cosmological estimates.</p>
      <p>At high redshifts, much of an astronomical object's characteristic spectrum 
        is shifted into the infrared. Without additional infrared observations, 
        no useful cosmological information could be derived from SN 1997ff, nor 
        could its type be positively identified. It seemed unlikely that anyone 
        had made such observations.</p>
      <p>Enter serendipity. Only 25 days after the initial observation, Rodger 
        Thompson of the University of Arizona had begun doing tests of a small 
        portion of the Hubble Deep Field with NICMOS, an instrument aboard the 
        space telescope that makes images in the near infrared. Although Thompson 
        had not been looking for supernovae, many of his images accidentally included 
        SN 1997ff and its host galaxy.</p>

      <p>&quot;Twenty-five days later may seem like a long time, but highly redshifted 
        objects are moving away from us so fast that time dilation is large,&quot; 
        Nugent remarks. &quot;At a redshift of 1.7, three and a half weeks in 
        our frame of reference is only about nine days of elapsed time for the 
        supernova itself.&quot;</p>
      <p>Six months later another set of infrared images of the same region, made 
        by Mark Dickinson of the Space Telescope Science Institute, caught the 
        now greatly faded supernova and its host galaxy once again. Once more, 
        luck had provided a missing piece of the puzzle: by digitally subtracting 
        the new image of the host galaxy from images made when the supernova was 
        bright, Nugent proposed to Dickinson, much of the remaining uncertainty 
        about the supernova and its host could be eliminated.</p>
      <p>He had no takers until July of last year, however, when Adam Riess, independently 
        intrigued by the accumulating data, queried Nugent about doing cosmology 
        on an unnamed supernova at a redshift &quot;around 1.65.&quot; There was 
        only one such supernova; soon Riess and Nugent were collaborating.</p>
      <p>&quot;Adam had the monumental task of reducing the observed NICMOS infrared 
        data,&quot; said Nugent, &quot;while I concentrated on comparing the reduced 
        data to known supernovae and various sets of cosmological parameters.&quot; 
        By painstakingly eliminating other possibilities, they determined that 
        SN 1997ff was almost certainly a Type Ia supernova at a redshift of 1.7, 
        first seen eight days after it exploded.</p>
      <p>&quot;Now we could do the cosmology,&quot; Nugent says.</p>
      <b><i> 
      <p>If the luck holds, what comes next?</p>
      </i></b> 
      <p>SN 1997ff supports the model of a universe consisting of about one third 
        matter and ordinary energy and about two thirds &quot;dark energy,&quot; 
        which acts to overcome gravity. Most important, says Nugent, SN 1997ff 
        proves that while the most distant supernovae currently cannot be seen 
        from ground telescopes, they can be observed from space - and they can 
        provide vital information about the most basic cosmological questions, 
        including, perhaps, the nature of the dark energy itself.</p>
      <p>&quot;The results from SN 1997ff are one of the best arguments for the 
        SNAP satellite,&quot; Nugent says. SNAP, for SuperNova/ Acceleration Probe, 
        is a multi-institution, multi-agency proposal led by Saul Perlmutter and 
        Michael Levi of the Lab's Physics Division. It would fly a 2-meter telescope 
        and employ a CCD camera far larger and more sensitive than any previous 
        astronomical imager, especially in the near infrared.</p>
      <p>The discovery of SN 1997ff underscores the role of luck in science - 
        although as Michael Turner paraphrased Louis Pasteur, &quot;Serendipity 
        favors the prepared mind;&quot; and it also illustrates the value of cooperation 
        among agencies such as NASA and the Department of Energy.</p>
      <p>Not to mention cooperation among rival groups: Peter Nugent is a member 
        of the Supernova Cosmology Project, and Adam Riess is a member of the 
        High-Z Supernova Search Team.</p>

      <font face="Times,Times New Roman"> 
      <p></p>
      <b><i> 
      <p>By Ron Kolb</p>
      </i></b> </font><font size="+2">A</font>n environmental consultant hired 
      by the City of Berkeley has confirmed what Berkeley Lab has been reporting 
      for years - that radiological emissions from the National Tritium Labeling 
      Facility (NTLF) are well within the federal standards established to protect 
      public health.<font face="Times,Times New Roman"> 
      <p>Bernd Franke of the German firm IFEU delivered his draft final report 
        on radiological monitoring in a public meeting held in Berkeley on Monday. 
        And among his findings was the bottom-line conclusion: &quot;I found [the 
        Lab's tritium emission] numbers to be reliable and state-of-the-art. There 
        is no evidence to suggest that any individual received a radiation exposure 
        resulting from NTLF emissions which exceeded 10 millirem per year in the 
        years 1998 and 1999.&quot;</p>
      <p>Those were the two years of data that Franke reviewed, and 10 millirem 
        per year is the maximum allowable airborne public dose set by the Environmental 
        Protection Agency (EPA).</p>
      <p>Berkeley Lab's average annual radiation doses have been less than 2 percent 
        of the EPA's standard.</p>
      <p>At one point in the meeting, Franke was asked by a Berkeley citizen whether 
        he would keep his children away from the Lawrence Hall of Science, where 
        the hypothetical maximum tritium exposure would be. &quot;No,&quot; the 
        city's consultant replied, &quot;I would let my own kids go. I would not 
        be concerned for the safety of my child.&quot;</p>
      <p>Franke was hired by the city to address community concerns over past 
        and present radiation exposures at Berkeley Lab, in particular from the 
        NTLF. He concentrated on four areas - exposures from current operations, 
        legacy contamination from past operations, historical exposures, and risk-related 
        questions. On Monday night, before an audience of 125 that included five 
        Berkeley City Council members at the North Berkeley Senior Center, he 
        offered his observations and suggestions.</p>
      <p>Also speaking was Owen Hoffman, an environmental consultant and risk 
        specialist from Senes Oak Ridge, Inc., who was hired by the Lab to work 
        with Franke during the review. Hoffman told the audience he always found 
        Lab personnel to be credible and responsive, and he concluded, &quot;This 
        is the lowest dose and risk that I've had in my professional career.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;We are pleased that Mr. Franke verified what we have been saying 
        about our public exposures,&quot; said David McGraw, Laboratory Director 
        for Environment, Health and Safety. &quot;We appreciate the care and thoroughness 
        with which IFEU reviewed and commented on our radiological monitoring 
        program. While we might disagree with some of IFEU's conclusions, we respect 
        the objectives of their review.&quot;</p>
      <p>Franke emphasized the need for improved monitoring and more reliable 
        measurements throughout the evening. He also suggested further study of 
        historic levels of radioactivity at the Lab, which were higher in the 
        1950s and 1960s when the Bevatron accelerator was operating.</p>
      <p>But he said he found little to suggest any immediate health threat to 
        the public.</p>
      <p>&#149;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franke noted that, although the Lab's estimate 
        of tritium inventory lacks precision, &quot;it's more important to monitor 
        what really goes out&quot; to determine emissions. He acknowledged the 
        Lab's purchase of a new calorimeter to improve inventory accuracy.</p>
      <p>&#149;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tritium levels in leaves and trees near the NTLF, 
        he said, are so small that &quot;I don't see any cause for concern.&quot; 
        Doses from gamma and neutron radiation are similarly small, he noted.</p>
      <p>&#149;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franke said he was &quot;misunderstood by the 
        media&quot; when he questioned the validity of the Laboratory's analysis 
        of public health impacts of tritium releases in the event of a major fire 
        at the NTLF. The Lab's calculations show that public impacts, even from 
        a catastrophic fire that resulted in the release of the entire inventory 
        of tritium at the NTLF, would be small. Without challenging that result, 
        he said, &quot;The Lab should do a better job of giving proper justification 
        for their conclusion.&quot;</p>
      <p>McGraw pointed out that the Laboratory is actually delivering on several 
        of Franke's suggestions. For example, the report recommended that the 
        Laboratory's ambient air monitoring program be expanded. McGraw said that 
        the Lab will be adding eight monitoring stations to its present seven, 
        including seven stations located within 300 meters of the NTLF.</p>
      <p>The Laboratory also announced in January that it would be removing the 
        hillside emission stack and installing an upgraded exhaust system and 
        a smaller stack on the roof of the NTLF. Franke's report supported this 
        move, adding that &quot;this will likely decrease the impact on off-site 
        locations.&quot;</p>
      <p>Once the new emission stack is installed later this year, a fire analysis 
        and dose assessment will be performed by an external contractor - an evaluation 
        that Franke also recommended in his report.</p>
      <p>Berkeley Lab's Environmental Sampling Project Task Force, a broad-based 
        community group, has been meeting for two years to comment on a tritium 
        sampling plan that would provide data to the EPA for evaluation as a priority 
        cleanup site. At its ninth meeting on March 29, consensus was reached 
        on sampling in several media, some of which started in April. Sampling 
        will continue through the next year as an adjunct to the Lab's ongoing 
        monitoring program.</p>

      <p>NIH to Raise Stipends for Postdocs</p>
      </i></b> 
      <p>Acknowledging that its stipends for postdoctoral and graduate students 
        are too low, the National Institutes of Health plans significant raises 
        over the next five years. NIH is also throwing its weight behind efforts 
        to reduce the maximum length of a postdoc's funding to five years and 
        a grad student's to six years.</p>
      <p>These policies are part of the agency's long-awaited response to a report 
        last summer from the National Academy of Sciences calling for changes 
        in how the federal government trains biomedical and behavioral scientists. 
        The report said that institutions should concentrate on improving the 
        quality of training rather than increasing the number of postdocs and 
        grad students it funds, and called for higher stipends and shorter periods 
        of funding for postdocs.</p>
      <p>NIH plans to boost stipend levels by 10 to 12 percent a year to $25,000 
        for graduate students and $45,000 for beginning postdocs. (Current levels 
        are $16,500 and $28,260, respectively.) Annual cost-of-living increases 
        will also be issued. Although NIH funds a minority of students, most universities 
        tie their pay scales to those of the NIH.</p>

      <p>NSF Reviewers Find Criteria Too Tough</p>
      </i></b> 
      <p>Three years ago, the National Science Foundation changed the criteria 
        for rating grant proposals. Reviewers were asked to rate on just two criteria: 
        scientific quality and social impact. Even though social impact was defined 
        to include issues such as education and training, diversity, and addressing 
        of national priorities, reviewers apparently found it too tough to render 
        a judgment.</p>
      <p>A new report from a panel of management experts commissioned by NSF says 
        that 73 percent of the reviewers don't even bother to rate proposals on 
        their potential social impact. Irate congressional members who have charged 
        the NSF grants process as being an &quot;old boys network&quot; biased 
        against first-time applicants and less prestigious institutions, are now 
        saying that if NSF can't convince them that the peer review system is 
        fair, they will try to remedy the problem themselves.</p>
      <p>&quot;We're not achieving our goal,&quot; admits Nate Pitts, head of 
        NSF's Office of Integrative Activities, which collects data on NSF's peer 
        review process.</p>
      <p>The report was prepared by the National Academy of Public Administration. 
        It concluded that by giving reviewers broad discretion on how to apply 
        each criterion, NSF &quot;essentially gives reviewers license to not apply 
        [the social impact criterion] at all.&quot;</p>

      <font size="+2">A </font>paper in the March 22 issue of the journal Nature, 
      signed by dozens of physicists and astronomers from institutions around 
      the world - many of them from Berkeley Lab and UC Berkeley - reported the 
      first high-energy neutrinos detected by AMANDA, the neutrino telescope implanted 
      beneath the ice at the South Pole.<font face="Times,Times New Roman"> 
      <p>AMANDA was designed to detect neutrinos originating from the far reaches 
        of the cosmos. It aims downward, using the entire Earth to filter out 
        other particles originating in the northern sky. The first neutrinos reported 
        by AMANDA, while energetic, are not of cosmic origin but instead result 
        from the collision of cosmic rays with the northern atmosphere.</p>
      <p>The sources of cosmic neutrinos are uncertain, although the prime suspects 
        include supernovae, gamma-ray bursters, matter-eating black holes at the 
        hearts of active galaxies, and other powerful phenomena.</p>
      <p>When an energetic neutrino interacts with the polar ice, a muon is emitted 
        which leaves a trail of blue Cerenkov radiation visible by optical modules 
        suspended more than a kilometer beneath the surface. The direction of 
        the muon track allows the path of the neutrino that created it to be reconstructed.</p>
      <p>The eventual goal of the neutrino telescope is to track neutrino paths 
        back to their points of origin in the sky. To this end, thousands of detectors 
        distributed in a cubic kilometer of ice will be needed. AMANDA is only 
        the beginning of the proposed IceCube, but its unambiguous detection of 
        energetic neutrinos conclusively demonstrates that a neutrino telescope 
        designed to do astrophysics will work.</p>

      <p>&quot;Gee, thanks, I don't have to cut up a frog&quot; is the typical 
        comment Bill Johnston gets from students from around the world who visit 
        the famous virtual frog site that he and colleague David Robertson developed 
        back in 1994. The site jump-started a virtual frog trend on the web, but 
        the Lab's Whole Frog Project was the first interactive 3D website of its 
        kind. Seven years later, the site still gets a million hits a year from 
        over 100 countries, has amassed scores of awards, is posted on many K-12 
        educational sites, and was even featured once in the &quot;Frog Stuff&quot; 
        category on Jeopardy.</p>
      </font> 
      <p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">Last month, the Whole Frog (</font><a href="http://www.itg.lbl.gov/Frog/"><font face="Times,Times New Roman">http://www.itg.lbl.gov/Frog/</font></a><font face="Times,Times New Roman">) 
        was selected by the Department of Energy's Web Council as DOE's Featured 
        Site. &quot;Each month new sites are selected by the council to represent 
        the best of the department on the World Wide Web,&quot; said Howard Landon 
        of the DOE. &quot;Featured Sites are selected based on their ability to 
        provide the public with valuable content in a user-friendly format.&quot;</font></p>
      <font face="Times,Times New Roman"> 
      <p>The site, used mostly by schools to help students study biology, was 
        started as an experiment.</p>
      <p>&quot;We wanted to see if we could use the Lab's capability in medical 
        imaging, computer science and 3D graphics to put up a library of three-dimensional, 
        anato-mically accurate renderings of critters.&quot;</p>
      <p>The project was a collaboration between Johnston's group and Thomas Budinger's 
        Center for Functional Imaging.</p>
      <p>The site's most popular part is the interactive dissection kit. Users 
        can pick any section of the frog - skeleton, organs, digestive or nervous 
        system - and manipulate it in 3D. In effect, you can see the frog inside 
        out without having to dip your hands or any critter parts into formaldehyde.</p>
      <p>&quot;It turns out that you can't do an MRI of a frog, which is what 
        we originally wanted to do,&quot; Johnston explains. &quot;They have iron 
        in their skin which disrupts the MRI process. So we had to slice it mechanically 
        and photograph the slices to produce the sort of images you would usually 
        get from a tomographic reconstruction.&quot;</p>
      <p>To create the graphics, a UC biology student outlined the frog organs 
        on sequential images and stacked them to get 3D images. This process, 
        Johnston said, is roughly the same as the one used by radiologists to 
        get information from tomographic images for medical purposes.</p>
      <p>Instead of working with a stack of X-ray film, however, Robertson used 
        the organ outlines as input to a 3D computer graphics program to produce 
        the web images. Every image is calculated on demand as a result of the 
        user interaction. &quot;The images on the screen do not exist until someone 
        clicks on an organ or a rotation knob,&quot; Johnson says. &quot;Many 
        people ask if they have the frog images on a CD-ROM, and the answer is 
        no, because the images are computed on the fly.&quot; There is not a library 
        of 3D frog images.</p>
      <p>The National Library of Medicine has used a similar approach recently 
        to create a &quot;Visible Human&quot; anatomy project website (http://anatline.nlm.nih.gov).</p>
      <p>The frog site has been enhanced over years to make its interface more 
        user-friendly, but the basic concept has remained unchanged. Visitors 
        from 170 countries and 110,000 websites manipulate Berkeley Lab's virtual 
        frogs, and the site has been translated into seven languages (Spanish, 
        German, French, Dutch, Czech, Italian, and Portuguese).</p>
      <p>Over the years, the Whole Frog has been listed on major education sites 
        such as the BBC Online Education Web Guide and Educating.net, and was 
        chosen as a top website by the editors of PC Computing and PC Magazine.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Johnston continues to receive e-mail from around the world. 
        Sometimes, he says, when the server is temporarily down, teachers mail 
        him frantically. &quot;We have class in two hours, help!&quot;</p>
      <p>That's when you know you really have something good going.</p>

      and earnings until they withdraw the funds. The Internal Revenue Code (IRC) 
      limits the amount an individual can contribute each year to a tax-deferred 
      retirement savings plan and imposes penalties for over-contributing. This 
      limit is referred to as the Maximum Annual Contribution (MAC). The payroll 
      system will automatically stop an employee's 403(b) contribution when it 
      reaches the employee's MAC.<font face="Times,Times New Roman">

        from the Benefits Office at X6403.</p>
      <b><i> 
      <p>Think your 2001 MAC is too low?</p>
      </i></b> 
      <p>If so, you may be able to increase your limit - if certain conditions 
        apply. The first step is to request a copy of the data used to calculate 
        your MAC (your MAC Calculation and Data Explanation) by calling Bencom.fone 
        at (800) 888-8267. Review the data elements and compare the three limits 
        described above to determine if one of the following apply:</p>
      <p>1. One or more of the data elements is incorrect. (For example, the data 
        elements show your percent time worked as 50 percent and you are a full-time 
        employee.)</p>
      <p>2. The TRA of $10,500 is the lowest of the three limits. If you have 
        15 or more full years of UC employment you may be eligible for the &quot;Catch-up 
        Provision&quot; to increase your MAC by a maximum of $3,000 for up to 
        five years, for an additional $15,000. If you used the Catch-up Provision 
        to increase your MAC in 2000 and are eligible to use it again in 2001, 
        you will receive a reminder from the Benefits office to reelect this option.</p>
      <p>3. The IRC §415 Limit or the Maximum Exclusion Allowance (MEA) is the 
        lowest of the three calculations. You can request that one of three Alternative 
        Contribution Limits be used instead. These limits are mutually exclusive 
        - once you elect an alternative limit you may never elect a different 
        one. You can, however, always revert to the MAC that is automatically 
        calculated for you each year.</p>
      <p>If you used an Alternative Contribution Limit for 2000, an Alternative 
        Election Limit worksheet and an election form for 2001 was mailed to you 
        in late March. The worksheet and election form must be returned to the 
        UC Benefits Office in Oakland by June 1 to avoid the replacement of your 
        2000 Alternative Election Limit with your University calculated MAC. The 
        University calculated MAC may be lower than your 200 Alternative Election 
        Limit and may cause your 403(b) contributions to stop.</p>
      <p>Please note that unless you are eligible for the Catch-up Provision, 
        your MAC will not exceed the TRA Limit of $10,500.</p>
      <p>If you need assistance with any of the options above, contact the Benefits 
        office at X6403.</p>

      <h2>Estate Planning Information Session</h2>
      <font face="Times,Times New Roman"> 
      <p></p>
      </font><font size="+2">O</font>n April 11, the Benefits Department and Fidelity 
      Investments will present an information session on the topic of estate planning 
      - a lifelong process that involves evaluating one's financial situation 
      and planning for the future. It includes planning for retirement, as well 
      as for the possibility of disability or death. A wide range of legal, financial, 
      emotional and logistical issues need to be considered.<font face="Times,Times New Roman"> 
      <p>Although it is unpleasant to think about catastrophic events, advance 
        planning is a way to show concern for loved ones and to reduce distress 
        in the future. A properly designed estate plan will assure your family's 
        welfare and the education of your children.</p>
      <p>To help employees design an estate plan, Benefits brings Fidelity's vice 
        president of estate planning to speak at Berkeley Lab. The event will 
        be held at noon on Wednesday, April 11 in the Bldg. 66 auditorium.</p>

      <p>He began his career at what was then known as the Lawrence Radiation 
        Lab as a UC Berkeley graduate student in high energy physics. In 1979 
        he moved to the Accelerator Group, where he continued his research until 
        suffering a stroke in 1998.</p>
      <p>&quot;He never acted like a physicist,&quot; jokes Jerry Stoker of Electrical 
        Engineering, who was matrixed to work with Chupp. &quot;He loved to get 
        his hands dirty at the workbench or lathe. He could fix anything.&quot;</p>
      <p>Chupp was a devoted family who will also be remembered for his warm friendship.</p>
      <p>&quot;He was always there to give support to his friends,&quot; says 
        Stoker. &quot;He was a good friend to me and he will be greatly missed.&quot;</p>
      <p>Chupp is survived by his wife of 55 years, Maria Claudio Chupp; his children 
        Ernest Chupp and Camille Reed; brothers Edward and Norman Chupp; and five
