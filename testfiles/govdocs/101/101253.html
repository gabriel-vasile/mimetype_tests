<p class="stratgoal">Management Control Program</p>
<p>The Federal Managers Financial Integrity Act of 1982 (FMFIA) requires 
              that we annually assess the adequacy of our management controls. 
              Management controls are the organization, policies, and procedures 
              we use to reasonably ensure that:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>our programs achieve 
                their intended results; </li>
              <li>we use our resources 
                in a manner that is consistent with our mission;</li>
              <li>our programs and resources 
                are protected from waste, fraud, and mismanagement;</li>
              <li> we follow all laws 
                and regulations; and</li>
              <li>we generate and use 
                reliable and timely information for decision making.</li>
            </ul>
<p>In assessing the adequacy of our management controls,we relied on the judgments of our senior executives of their program and administrative functions, the input of our Office of the Inspector General (OIG) and of our independent public accountants, and on our internal program of quality assurance reviews. We are pleased to be able to certify, with reasonable assurance, that our management controls are adequate, effective, and are achieving all intended purposes. </p>

              <p>In considering the compliance of our financial management systems 
              with the FFMIA, KPMG LLP assessed individually the systems we use 
              to administer the (1) Retirement, Heath Benefits, and Life Insurance 
              Programs and (2) Revolving Fund and Salaries and Expenses account. 
              In its audit report, KPMG LLP cited the financial management systems 
              supporting the Revolving Fund Programs and Salaries and Expenses 
              as being substantially non-compliant with the FFMIA. More specifically, 
              they reported that as of September 30, 2001, the financial management 
              systems we used to manage the Revolving Fund Programs and Salaries 
              and Expenses account: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Lacked a formal budgetary accounting structure, which compromises 
                our ability to comply with budget preparation, execution and reporting 
                requirements; and</li>
                
              <li>Did not provide for the recording of financial events in a manner 
                that is consistent with the SGL.</li></ul>
            <p>On an agency-wide level, KPMG LLP reported that we did not provide 
              adequate system security in that we do not have coordinated security 
              procedures; lack effective incidence response and monitoring capabilities; 
              do not conduct periodic risk assessments; and have not developed 
              adequate security-related processes to protect our assets from unauthorized 
              access or improper use. </p>
            <p>We implemented our new core financial management system supporting 
              the Revolving Fund Programs and Salaries and Expenses account on 
              October 1, 2001. As a consequence, we believe that we will be able 
              to report for FY2002 that the financial management systems are substantially 
              compliant with the FFMIA. Further, we intend in FY2002 to resolve 
              fully all issues that led KPMG LLP to conclude that we do not have 
              in place adequate system security procedures.</p>

<p class="stratgoal">Debt Collection Improvement Act Compliance</p>
            <p>The Debt Collection Improvement Act (DCIA) has had a major impact 
              on the way we make our payments and collect the monies owed us. 
              We comply with the DCIA in the following ways:</p>
            <p><span class="pi">Cross-servicing.</span> The DCIA established 
              the Treasury's Financial Management Service (FMS) as the collection 
              agency for all Federal agency receivables that are delinquent for 
              more than 180 days. As a consequence, we transfer all such receivables 
              to FMS for collection or "cross-servicing". To collect 
              on the accounts we transfer, FMS issues demand letters, administratively 
              offsets, performs wage garnishment and refers accounts to private 
              collection agencies. To date, 4,475 of our receivables for more 
              than $1.4 million have been collected via FMS cross-servicing. </p>
            <p><span class="pi">Computer-Matching.</span> We believe that 
              it is equally important to prevent overpayments in the first place 
              as it is to collect them once they become debts. Thus, we maintain 
              an aggressive and active program integrity function to prevent waste, 
              fraud, and abuse of Retirement Program benefit payments. One of 
              the primary tools supporting this function is the use of computer-matching 
              agreements. As such, we exchange payment information with other 
              benefit-paying agencies to identify individuals who have died or 
              are otherwise no longer eligible for benefits. In FY 2001, our computer-matching 
              activities identified more than $22 million in overpayments and 
              prevented an additional $70 million from being overpaid. </p>
            <p><span class="pi">Quality Assurance Program.</span> We have 
              incorporated a Quality Assurance Program in our Retirement Program 
              claims adjudication process by performing quarterly reviews of recently 
              adjudicated cases for errors. </p>
            <p><span class="pi">Managing Receivables.</span> The following 
              chart summarizes our receivables management activity for FY 2001: </p>

<p><span class="pi">Retirement Program.</span> Retirement Program 
              receivables result when beneficiaries or family members inadvertently 
              delay reporting certain changes in an individual's status (death, 
              marriage, recovery from disability, etc.) that result in a changed 
              benefit. In other cases, partial or incorrect information is provided 
              by the individual or the employing agency, resulting in an overpayment. 
              Our receivables management process demonstrates a balance between 
              our accountability for the public's money vis-a-vis the needs 
              of Federal employees and retirees who have performed vital al services 
              on behalf of America's citizens. We recognize that our customers 
              are generally aged, living on fixed incomes, and are often unaware 
              of the rules that apply to the need to report changes in their circumstances.</p>
<p>In fact, Retirement Program receivables represent a very small part 
              of our total assets, as we do not operate commercial programs that 
              are material to our financial statements. In FY 2001, total Retirement 
              Program overpayments were less than one percent of the total benefit 
              payments we made. Further, almost 88 cents of every dollar that 
              was overpaid was collected. </p>

            <p><span class="pi">Health Benefits Program.</span> Our Office 
              of the Inspector General (OIG) performs financial and contract compliance 
              audits of the participating insurance carriers. As a consequence 
              of these audits, the OIG may question costs charged by the carriers 
              to their contracts with the Program. If Program management agrees 
              and decides that such costs should not be charged to the Program, 
              a receivable is established. </p>
            <p>During FY 2001, we won an important victory in the courts that 
              will enhance the tool set we have at our disposal to collect monies 
              due the Program. The ruling supported the ability of our OIG to 
              identify, and management's right to collect, interest we lose 
              when a carrier overcharges the Program through its premium rates. </p>
            <p>As with the Retirement Program, Health Benefits Program receivables 
              are relatively small, representing less than one percent of the 
              total benefit and premium payments we make. </p>
            <p>As can be seen in the Health Benefits Program Receivables table, 
              we ended the year with $186.2 million in management decisions requiring 
              final action, an increase of $113.6 million from the beginning of 
              the year. The large increase is attributable to the fact that $125.4 
              million in management decisions were made during the last month 
              in FY 2001.</p>

<p><span class="pi">Electronic Payments.</span> The DCIA requires 
              that we issue payments electronically. Ninety-three percent of our 
              Retirement Program annuitants are now paid via Direct Deposit&#151;the 
              highest percentage among all Federal benefit&#151;paying programs. 
              We believe it may be difficult to convince a great many of the remaining 
              annuitants to enroll, since they are older individuals who may be 
              uncomfortable with the concept of electronic payments and banking. 
              Most of the future growth in our direct deposit participation rate 
              will come from our annuitants who live overseas. In fact, during 
              the year, we initiated an effort to extend "International Direct 
              Deposit" to our overseas customers and will begin paying annuitants 
              living in Italy this way very soon. </p>
