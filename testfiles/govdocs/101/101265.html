<P>

"Implementations of Standards offered as a result of these

requirements shall conform to the

requirements in the specified STANDARD (i.e., voluntary consenses

standards such as FIPS, IEEE, ANSI).   These implementations shall

implement all of the elements of the STANDARD and require

[insert 'Delayed Validation', 'Prior Validation Testing' or 'Prior

Validation' (choose one)] as specified elsewhere in this document

[insert reference]."

[Procurement Officers should refer to Part 2 below on guidance for

 selection of above 'Delayed Validation', 'Prior Validation Testing'

  or 'Prior Validation' terminology].

          SOLICITATION WORDING FOR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY STANDARDS

</CENTER>

<P>

<B>Delayed Validation </B>- When an procurement activity determines that

 it is acceptable for implementations of a STANDARD to be offered that have

not yet been tested for conformance to that STANDARD the 'Delayed

Validation' solicitation wording option shall be included as part

of the Sample Solicitation Wording as identified in Part 1 above.

<P>

<B>Prior Validation Testing</B> - When an procurement activity determines that

it is essential for implementations of a STANDARD to be previously tested for

conformance to that STANDARD before being offered, and the nature of

the requirement is such that an implementation of that STANDARD may be

initially offered that has not been fully validated (i.e.,

implementation has areas of nonconformance or does not fully demonstrated

 compliance to the STANDARD),

the 'Prior Validation Testing' solicitation wording option shall be

included as a part of the Sample Solicitation Wording as

identified in Part 1 above.

<P>

<B>Prior Validation </B>- When a procurement activity determines that

it is essential for implementations of a STANDARD be validated (i.e.,

 implementation has been tested and has demonstrated compliance

 to the FIPS) for conformance to that STANDARD prior to being offered the 'Prior

Validation' solicitation wording option shall be included as part

of the Standard Solicitation Wording as identified in Part 1 above.

"In addition to the STANDARD implementation requirements specified

elsewhere in this requirements document, all implementations of the

STANDARD that are brought into the organization's inventory as a result of

this document for which validation is specified, and those

implementations used by vendors to develop programs or provide

services shall be validated using the official Validation System

specified by the ________________________________ (organization name).

  Validation shall be in accordance with ___________________ (organization name)

  validation procedures for that STANDARD.

   The results of validation shall be used to confirm that the

implementation meets the requirements of the applicable STANDARD as

specified in this document.

<P>  

To be considered responsive the offeror shall:

<P>

(1) Provide validated standard implementations through 'Delayed

Validation',  'Prior Validation Testing' or 'Prior Validation', as

specified for each STANDARD that is specified elsewhere in this

requirements document."   

<P>

(Option 1) - "Delayed Validation"

<P>

"The offeror shall certify in the offer that all implementations of

a STANDARD, including applicable STANDARD options, offered in response to

this document will be submitted for validation upon contract award.

Implementations submitted for validation shall have the validation

completed at the earliest possible date permitted by the testing laboratory

validation procedures.  Unless specified elsewhere, proof of

submission for validation shall be in the form of a letter

scheduling the validation and the subsequent delivery by the

offeror of a validation summary report or Certificate of

Validation.  Proof of testing shall be provided in the form of a

registered validation summary report.  Proof of fully validated

implementations shall be in the form of a Certificate of

Validation."

<P>

(Option 2) - "Prior Validation Testing"

<P>

"The offeror shall certify in the offer that all implementations of

a STANDARD, including applicable STANDARD options, offered in response to

this document have been previously tested or validated and included

on the current list of validated products maintained by the

________________________(organization name).  Unless specified elsewhere,

proof of testing shall be provided in the form of a registered

validation summary report.  Proof of fully validated

implementations shall be in the form of a Certificate of

Validation."

<P>

(Option 3) - "Prior Validation"

<P>

"The offeror shall certify in the offer that all implementations of

a STANDARD, including applicable STANDARD options, offered in response to

this document have been previously validated and included on the

current list of validated products maintained by ______________________

(organization name).  Unless specified elsewhere, proof of validation

shall be in the form of a Certificate of Validation."

<P>

(2)  Agree to correct all implementation nonconformance from the

applicable STANDARD reflected in the validation summary report not

previously covered by a waiver.  All areas of nonconformance must

be corrected within 12 months from the date of contract award

unless otherwise specified elsewhere in this document. If an

interpretation of the STANDARD is required, such a request for

interpretation shall be made within 30 calendar days after contract

award.  Any corrections that are required as a result of any interpretations

made shall be completed

within 12 months of the date of the formal notification to the

contractor of the approval of the interpretation.  Proof of

correction in either case shall be in the form of a Certificate

of Validation or registered validation summary report showing that

the implementations nonconformance has been corrected.  Failure to

make required corrections within the time limits set forth above

shall be deemed a failure to deliver required software.  The

liquidated damages as specified for failure to deliver the

operating system or other software shall apply."
