SUBJECT:   MANAGEMENT CONTROL PROGRAM


     1.   OBJECTIVES.  To establish requirements and assign responsibilities for the Department of
     Energy (DOE) Management Control Program.  The objectives of the Management Control
     Program are to 

               a.   ensure sound management controls and overall consistency in exercising the statutory
          authorities that vest in the Secretary and the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) for
          implementing the Federal Managers' Financial Integrity Act of 1982 (P.L. 97-255) and
          related central agency guidance;

               b.   evaluate management controls using existing information and day-to-day knowledge to
          the maximum extent possible;

               c.   provide reasonable assurance that the Department's, including the National Nuclear
          Security Administration's (NNSA's), programs are protected from waste, fraud, and
          mismanagement;

               d.   promote open recognition of problems prior to identification by outside organizations;

               e.   focus attention on correcting the most serious problems facing the Department, NNSA,
          and component organizations; and

               f.   report the status of the Department's, including NNSA's, major problems up through
          the chain of command to the President and Congress. 

     2.   CANCELLATION.  DOE O 413.1, Management Control Program, dated 12-6-95. 
     Cancellation of an Order does not, by itself, modify or otherwise affect any contractual
     obligation to comply with the Order.  Canceled Orders that are incorporated by reference in a
     contract remain in effect until the contract is modified to delete the reference to the requirements
     in the canceled Orders.

     3.   APPLICABILITY.  

               a.   DOE Elements.  Except for the exclusions in paragraph 3c, this Order applies to all

          in Attachment 1, Departmental Elements, are required to maintain separate
          management control programs.  All other Departmental organizations must not establish
          separate management control programs as required by this Order, but must participate
          in the programs established by the respective Departmental elements to which they
          report.

               b.   Contractors.  Except for the exclusions in paragraph 3c, the Contractor Requirements

                      REQUIREMENTS OVERVIEW


The DOE Management Control Program requires DOE elements, including NNSA, to evaluate and
report on the status of the management controls used in the Department's programs and administrative
functions and to report any problems identified.  DOE elements must 

     1.   identify annually the programs and administrative functions subject to the evaluation and
     reporting requirements in this Order (see Chapter II);

     2.   conduct annual summary management reviews of programs and administrative functions (see
     Chapter III);

     3.   conduct annual summary financial management system reviews of financial management systems
     or system components contained in the Department of Energy Financial Management System
     Inventory (see Chapter IV); 

     4.   develop executive-level summary action plans to address reportable problems and financial
     system reportable nonconformances of concern to the next higher level of management (see
     Chapter V);

     5.   report the status of management controls and any reportable problems or financial management
     system nonconformances through the Department's reporting chain, reporting the Department's
     most serious problems to the President and Congress (see Chapter VI); and

     6.   track progress on correcting reportable problems and financial system nonconformances (see
     Chapter VII).

The head of each DOE element, or NNSA Deputy Administrator, must appoint a management control
action officer to coordinate all planning, evaluating, and reporting related to the DOE Management
Control Program.      

			CHAPTER II

        IDENTIFYING PROGRAMS AND ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS


     1.   GENERAL.  Each Departmental element is required to develop an annual list of its programs
     and administrative functions to serve as the basis for the evaluations of management controls
     required by this Order.

     2.   PURPOSE.  The list designates those specific programs, administrative functions, and other
     sensitive areas for which summary management reviews are to be performed.  This list further
     helps ensure that all appropriate Departmental activities are evaluated and reported on.

     3.   CRITERIA FOR IDENTIFYING PROGRAMS AND ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS. 
     The following paragraphs outline the criteria for identifying each Departmental element's
     programs, administrative functions, and other activities that are subject to the requirements of
     this Order.  The word "program" as used in this chapter refers to programs identified by
     Congress as funding control levels (e.g., budget and reporting code EM01, DP02, etc.).

               a.   Headquarters Departmental Elements.

                         (1)  Each individual program with a total obligational authority of $10 million or
               more.

                         (2)  If no individual program has a total obligational authority of $10 million or more,
               all programs must be consolidated and treated as a single program at the
               organizational level (e.g., General Counsel, Hearings and Appeals).

               b.   Field Departmental Elements.  Each individual program with a total obligational
          authority of $5 million or more if total Departmental funding for the program is $10
          million or more.

               c.   Headquarters and Field Elements.  

                         (1)  Each applicable administrative function and crosscutting area, included in
               Attachment 3, regardless of funding level.

                         (2)  Each "sensitive area" identified by the Office of Chief Financial Officer in its
               annual year-end reporting guidance, regardless of funding level.

          Evaluation of programs and activities that do not meet these criteria is not required under this
     Order.  However, Departmental elements have the option of including these programs and
     activities if management considers them to be sensitive at the local level.

     4.   DEVELOPING THE LIST OF PROGRAMS AND ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS.  

               a.   The Departmental element must develop its list using budget reports on current-year
          funding and unobligated carryover to identify the programs for which it is responsible
          and programs that are subject to the requirements of this Order. 
  
               b.   The list must identify applicable administrative functions and crosscutting program
          areas, as well as any sensitive areas, regardless of funding level.

               c.   The programs, administrative functions, and other activities in the list may be aligned to
          reflect the Departmental element's internal use.  However, Departmental elements must
          document that all applicable programs (identified by budget and reporting code),
          administrative functions, and other activities have been included.

               d.   Occasionally, funding is provided to a Departmental element that does not have the
          programmatic responsibility to determine the manner in which those funds are used.  In
          those instances, the Departmental element with the funding must exclude that program
          from its list after documenting that the Departmental element with the programmatic
          responsibility agrees and has included that program on its own list.

                    SUMMARY MANAGEMENT REVIEW


     1.   GENERAL.  Each Departmental element is responsible for evaluating the adequacy of its
     management controls to determine whether they conform to the principles and standards
     established by Office of Management and Budget Circular A-123.  This evaluation is
     accomplished by performing annual summary management reviews of the Departmental
     element's programs and administrative functions.

     2.   PURPOSE.  Summary management reviews must provide an overall look at the operations
     under a manager's cognizance and provide a framework for identifying and summarizing
     inadequate management controls and reportable problems.  

     3.   CONDUCTING SUMMARY MANAGEMENT REVIEWS.  Heads of Departmental
     elements may perform summary management reviews in a manner that suits their method of
     operation.  However, the appropriate responsible managers must be involved to ensure that
     adequate summary management reviews are conducted.  

          During a summary management review, managers must 

               a.   consider existing information regarding the activities under their cognizance;

     b.   consider underlying management principles included below;

               c.   determine if there are problems which should be reported to the next higher level of
          management;

               d.   develop action plans to correct the reportable problems identified; and

               e.   document, in a succinct manner, the process used and the rationale for the conclusions
          reached.

     4.   EXISTING INFORMATION.  The following types of information, as well as any other
     relevant information available to management, must be considered during performance of the
     summary management review.  Not all of the types of information will be available to every
     organization; therefore, managers must determine which items are applicable.  Furthermore, if
     the available information is not sufficient, the head of the Departmental element should ensure
     that an appropriate evaluation is conducted to obtain the needed information. 

               a.   Prior-Year Reportable Problems.  Managers must consider problems at the
          organizational level that were reported the previous year, as well as prior-year
          Departmental challenges.  The following factors should be considered: 

                         (1)  any changes that have affected the nature of the problem;

                         (2)  whether critical milestones reported last year still appropriately describe the
               corrective actions to be taken and are on schedule; and

                         (3)  whether the root cause has been fixed for problems that are now considered
               closed.   

               b.   Current-Year Evaluations and Information.  Managers must consider available current-
          year information to determine whether any new potentially reportable problems have
          surfaced or any previously undetected reportable problems exist.  The following factors
          should be considered:

                         (1)  current-year internal and external reviews, audits, appraisals, and other types of
               evaluations and any problems that were disclosed;

                         (2)  activity reports and other existing mechanisms for reporting to management and
               any problems that were disclosed;

                         (3)  day-to-day knowledge of the program or administrative function that would
               indicate whether reportable problem(s) exist;

                         (4)  problems identified through ongoing improvement-related initiatives;

                         (5)  problems uncovered by reviews or audits in other areas that may also exist in
               the program or administrative function being evaluated; and

                         (6)  information on the status of major contractors' activities.

               c.   Strategic Plans, Budgets, and Customer Needs.  The strategic plan, the budget, annual
          performance plans, and the needs of customers are critical DOE processes and
          interests that must be considered in determining whether reportable problems exist. 
          The following factors should be considered:

                         (1)  difficulties in meeting the goals and/or objectives in the immediate organization's
               and/or the Department's strategic plan;

                         (2)  difficulties in achieving the performance targets in the immediate organization's
               or Department's performance plans;

                         (3)  problems for which funding has been requested and/or identified in the budget;
               and

                         (4)  problems in meeting customer needs.

     5.   UNDERLYING MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES.  When conducting the summary
     management review, managers must consider the following underlying principles which
     incorporate the principles stated in the General Accounting Office's Standards for Internal
     Controls in the Federal Government.

               a.   Policies and objectives have been established and are understood and accepted. 
          Management must set expectations for the organization before employees can do their
          jobs, satisfy their customers, and strive to improve the quality of their work.  Specific
          policies and objectives reflecting requirements in applicable laws and regulations and
          the Departmental element's mission, core values, and operating philosophy must be
          established.  Once these have been established, managers must take actions to ensure
          that employees share the organization's vision.  

               b.   Roles and responsibilities have been assigned and are understood and accepted.  It is
          management's obligation to ensure that an organizational structure and delegations of
          authority are in place to support the accomplishment of the organization's mission and
          that employees understand what their responsibilities are.  Before taking responsibility
          for their work, employees must know management's expectations, know why a task is
          being performed, and be empowered to carry out assigned tasks.     

               c.   Work is planned and controlled to ensure that objectives are met.  Work must be
          carefully planned and controlled to ensure management's objectives are met. Relevant
          risks associated with achieving management's objectives, such as those defined in
          strategic and annual performance plans, should be identified and analyzed to form a
          basis for determining how risks should be managed.  Needs must be thought out,
          organizational goals identified, lines of communication put in place, manpower and other
          resources provided, and accountability established.  Management must also ensure that
          the right material, tools, and processes are in place and used appropriately.

               d.   Employees are capable of performing their assigned tasks and are adequately
          supervised.  Management must ensure that employees are capable of performing
          assigned tasks.  Work assigned to employees should be equivalent to their skill levels. 
          Employees should have appropriate education and training, including professional
          development and on-the-job training.  Employees should be supervised to ensure they
          understand the specific tasks assigned to them and that the organization's work is
          successfully accomplished.

               e.   Responsibilities for critical verifications and approvals are assigned to separate
          employees and/or organizations.  Some critical tasks and work processes require
          verifications or approvals to ensure that the final product meets specifications or that
          strict operating requirements are adhered to.  Management is responsible for assigning
          the responsibility for these critical verifications and approvals to employees and/or
          organizations that are separate from those performing the work. 

               f.   Decisions are based on accurate, up-to-date information.  Decision making must be
          based on accurate information that is available when needed.  This requires that
                                                                                significant events and relevant data be promptly and accurately documented,     recorde
                                                                                d, and
                                                                                distribu
                                                                                ted in a
                                                                                form
                                                                                and
                                                                                time
                                                                                frame
                                                                                that

                                                                                people
                                                                                to

                                                                                Manag

                                                                                use

                                                                                and
                                                                                external
                                                                                sources
                                                                                that
                                                                                could
                                                                                affect
                                                                                their
                                                                                operati
                                                                                ons.

               g.   Work is assessed to ensure it meets expectations.  Employees must critically assess
          their efforts and determine if they have accomplished what they set out to do.  In
          addition, a system of assessments must be established and implemented by
          management.  In carrying out these assessments, work performance should be
          measured against defined standards and must be conducted by competent individuals
          with expertise in the subject area involved.  Management should also  track major
          agency achievements and compare these to the plans, goals, and objectives established
          under the Government Performance and Results Act.
                                                  
               h.   General and application control activities are in place for information systems.  General
          controls apply to all information systems mainframe, minicomputer, network, and end
          user environment.  These controls include backup and recovery procedures,
          contingency and disaster planning, controls over acquisition, implementation and
          maintenance of all systems software, protection of systems networks from inappropriate
          access, and processes in place for safely developing new systems and modifying
          existing systems.  Application controls should be installed at an application's interfaces
          with other systems to ensure that all inputs are received and are valid and outputs are
          correct and properly distributed. 
 
               i.   Problems are identified and corrected.  Problems must be identified, documented,  
          analyzed, resolved, and followed up.  Management must be committed to preventing
          problems, correcting them when identified, and improving quality.  Managers should
          establish an environment in which problems are viewed as opportunities for
          improvement.

     6.   REPORTABLE PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION.  After considering day-to-day knowledge,
     existing information, and the underlying management principles, heads of Departmental elements
     must determine whether any of the problems identified are reportable.  Generally, if the problem
     would be of concern to the next higher level of management, it should be considered by the
     head of the Departmental element to be reportable.  As problems are reported up the
     management chain, judgments of reportability are made by progressively senior individuals with
     a broader perspective on the Department's mission and function.

          The following guidance is provided to aid heads of Departmental elements in determining
     whether a problem is reportable to the next higher level of management.  Specifically, heads of
     Departmental elements must consider whether the problem in their view:

     a.   substantially impairs the organization's performance, mission, and strategic plan;

               b.   violates significant statutory or regulatory requirements;

               c.   substantially weakens safeguards against waste, loss, unauthorized use, and
          misappropriation of funds or other assets;

          d.   results in a conflict of interest;

               e.   creates adverse publicity that affects the organization's credibility;

               f.   merits the attention of senior DOE management, the Secretary, Congressional
          Oversight Committees or the Executive Office of the President;

               g.   exists in a majority of programs, administrative functions, and/or organizations and can
          cause harm, even though minor individually, because the aggregate is significant;

               h.   risks or results in the actual loss of either $10 million or 5 percent of the resources of a
          budget line item;

               i.   could reflect adversely on the management integrity of the organization if not reported;

     j.   endangers national security; and/or

          k.   has received significant adverse audit coverage. 

     7.   ACTION PLANS FOR REPORTABLE PROBLEMS IDENTIFIED AND
     DEPARTMENTAL CHALLENGES.  An action plan must be developed for the actions the
     Departmental element will take to correct each reportable problem identified.  Action plans for
     prior year reportable problems must be updated on an annual basis including the year of
     closure.  In addition, Departmental elements responsible for a Departmental challenge, or
     portion of a Departmental challenge, should ensure the actions in the Departmental plan are
     updated.  Instructions for completing the action plan(s) are in Chapter V. 

     8.   SUMMARY MANAGEMENT REVIEW DOCUMENTATION.  Heads of Departmental
     elements must document the summary management review in a succinct narrative that is
     sufficient to evidence  

          a.   that a summary management review was conducted;
               b.   what information was used to conduct the evaluation; and 
               c.   the rationale for the conclusion reached.

          Managers are encouraged to retain additional supporting documents (e.g., management
     reports) as part of the summary management review documentation if they are critical to the
     conclusions reached and are not readily available otherwise.  In determining the need for
     documentation, managers should keep in mind that they are not required to maintain exhaustive
     documentation and must use their best judgment as to the minimum amount required to
     adequately support their evaluation and conclusions reached.  However, documentation should
     be sufficient to withstand review by auditors or other reviewers.                            CHAPTER IV

            SUMMARY FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM REVIEW


     1.   GENERAL.  The Department is responsible for evaluating its financial management system to
     determine whether it conforms to the principles and standards established by the Comptroller
     General and the requirements of Office of Management and Budget Circulars A-127 and A-
     130 and the Government Information Security Reform Act.  This evaluation is accomplished
     through the performance of two types of financial management system reviews:

               a.   Summary Financial Management System Reviews.  Summary financial management
          system reviews must be conducted annually by each Departmental element responsible
          for a financial management system and/or system component.

               b.   Financial Statement Audit Reviews.  As part of the audit of the Department's financial
          statements, the Inspector General, or contractor working for the Inspector General,
          must review the Department's financial management systems annually to determine
          whether they substantially comply with requirements delineated in the Federal Financial
          Management Improvement Act.

          The remainder of this chapter contains requirements pertaining to the summary financial
     management system review.

     2.   PURPOSE.  The purpose of the summary financial management system review is to give the
     manager an overall look at the financial system and/or system component under his or her
     cognizance and provide a framework for identifying and summarizing reportable
     nonconformances.

     3.   CONDUCTING SUMMARY FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM REVIEWS. 
     Departmental elements have the flexibility to perform the summary financial management system
     review in a manner that suits their method of operation.  However, the appropriate financial and
     systems managers must be involved to the extent required to ensure an adequate summary
     financial management system review is conducted.  

          During the summary financial management system review, managers must   

               a.   consider the existing information they have at their disposal regarding their financial
          management system or system component;

               b.   determine whether the system complies with General Accounting Office, Office of
          Management and Budget, Joint Financial Management Improvement Program
          (JFMIP), and legal and regulatory requirements;

               c.   determine if there are nonconformances which should be reported to the next higher
          level of management;

               d.   develop plans for the actions they will take to correct the reportable nonconformances
          identified; and

               e.   document, in a succinct manner, the process used and the rationale for conclusions
          reached.

     4.   DOE FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM INVENTORY.  The Department must
     review the following financial management systems and system components:

     a.   Departmental Integrated Standardized Core Accounting System (DISCAS),

     b.   Financial Information System (FIS),

     c.   Departmental Funds Distribution System (FDS),
     
     d.   Management Analysis and Reporting System (MARS),

               e.   Financial Management System (FMS) of the Power Marketing Administrations,

     f.   Corporate Human Resources Information System (CHRIS), and

     g.   Departmental Budget Formulation System (BFS).

          Departmental elements must evaluate only requirements under their control during the summary
     financial management system review.  For example, operations offices and field elements would
     consider only those DISCAS requirements not controlled by Headquarters.   

     5.   EXISTING INFORMATION.  In conducting the summary financial management system
     review, managers must consider existing information at their disposal.  Examples of such
     sources of information are:

               a.   Inspector General and/or General Accounting Office reviews;
               b.   day-to-day knowledge; 
               c.   management reviews, including, but not limited to, computer security reviews and
          summary management reviews;   
               d.   financial statement audits and findings; 
               e.   Department's 5-Year Systems Development Plan;
               f.   problems identified through ongoing initiatives;
               g.   system change requests;
               h.   problem(s) identified by user groups or councils; and
               i.   prior Summary Financial Management System reviews.

          If existing information is insufficient for an adequate evaluation, the manager must use other
     techniques (e.g., financial analysis, questionnaires, transaction testing) to obtain the needed
     information.  

     6.   COMPLIANCE WITH FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS REQUIREMENTS. 
     The financial management system must comply with applicable requirements in Title 2, Title 6,
     and Title 7 of the GAO Policies and Procedures Manual, Office of Management and Budget
     Circulars A-127 and A-130, the Government Information Security Reform Act, JFMIP System
     Requirements, and applicable accounting standards.  To enable these requirements to be met,
     financial management systems must process and record financial events effectively and
     efficiently, and provide complete, timely, reliable and consistent information for decision makers
     and the public.  Specific requirements call for the following:

               a.   an agency-wide financial information classification structure that is consistent with the
          U.S. Government Standard General Ledger;
               b.   integrated financial management systems;
               c.   use of the Standard General Ledger at the transaction level;
               d.   timely, useful reports on financial information and performance measures;
               e.   budget preparation, execution and reporting in accordance with Office of Management
          and Budget;
               f.   adherence to design, development, operation and maintenance requirements;
               g.   incorporation of Government Information Security Reform Act and other Government-
          wide computer security requirements;
               h.   up-to-date systems documentation adequate to user needs;
               i.   appropriate internal controls;
               j.   training and user support services;
               k.   ongoing maintenance for continued effective and efficient operations; and
               l.   adherence to Federal accounting standards.

          The Office of Chief Financial Officer must issue annual instructions on the specific requirements
     to be considered during the summary financial management system review.

     7.   REPORTABLE NONCONFORMANCE IDENTIFICATION.  Heads of Departmental
     elements must judge whether any of the nonconformances identified are reportable.  Generally,
     nonconformances that would be of concern to the next highest level of management are
     reportable.  As nonconformances are reported up, judgments of reportability are made by
     progressively senior individuals.

          The following is provided to assist heads of Departmental elements in determining if a
     nonconformance is reportable to the next highest level of management.  Specifically, reportable
     nonconformances in a financial management system must meet one or more of the following
     criteria: 

               a.   merits the attention of senior management, the Chief Financial Officer and/or the
          Secretary;
               b.   prevents the financial system from achieving central control over financial transactions
          and resource balances;
               c.   results in significant adverse effect on external reporting and internal management
          decisions; and
               d.   prevents conformance of financial systems with the Financial Management System
          Requirements in paragraph 6. 

          In addition, if management has agreed to a material systems weakness identified through
     audited financial statements, that issue must be considered a reportable nonconformance and an
     action plan must be submitted with the assurance memorandum.  Heads of Departmental
     elements should bear in mind that the existence of a reportable nonconformance does not
     preclude the system's overall conformance with financial management system requirements, so
     long as the nonconformances, when considered together, are not sufficiently serious to prevent
     reasonable assurance that the system as a whole conforms. 

     8.   ACTION PLANS FOR REPORTABLE NONCONFORMANCES IDENTIFIED.  An
     action plan must be developed for the actions the Departmental element will take to correct
     each reportable nonconformance identified.  Action plans must be updated on an annual basis,
     including the year of closure.  Instructions for preparing action plans are in Chapter V.

     9.   SUMMARY FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM REVIEW PROCESS
     DOCUMENTATION.  Heads of Departmental elements must document the summary financial
     management system review in a succinct narrative sufficient to evidence:
          a.   That a summary financial management system review was conducted;
                                                                           b.   What information was used to conduct the evaluation; and    
               c.   The rationale for the conclusion.
          Managers are encouraged to retain additional supporting documents (e.g. management reports,
     etc.) as part of the summary financial management system review documentation if critical to the
     conclusions reached and not readily available otherwise.  In determining the need for
     documentation, managers should keep in mind that they are not required to maintain exhaustive
     documentation and must use their best judgment as to the minimum amount required to
     adequately support their evaluation and conclusions reached.  However, documentation should
     be sufficient to withstand review by auditors and other reviewers.

     10.  MAJOR CONTRACTOR FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS.  Heads of field
     elements are responsible for ensuring that major contractor financial management systems and
     practices necessary to carry out the Department's financial policy, principles and objectives are
     acceptable.

                            CHAPTER V

                           ACTION PLANS


     1.   GENERAL.  Action plans are used by Departmental elements to describe their reportable
     problems and financial management system reportable nonconformances and the actions they
     plan to take to correct them.  In addition, cognizant Headquarters organizations use the field
     action plans to identify potential reportable problems or nonconformances during their year-end
     process, which are then considered for inclusion as one of the Departmental challenges
     reported by the Secretary.     

     2.   PREPARATION OF ACTION PLANS.  Action plans must 

               a.   concisely describe reportable problems or nonconformances, their root cause(s), and
          impact on the Department;

               b.   consolidate related or similar problems within the same program and administrative
          function at the Departmental element level;

               c.   be prepared at the executive summary level, using existing information when available;

               d.   identify planned critical milestones that portray broad, summary-level steps to rectify the
          problem, and its root cause(s);

               e.   reflect only those actions to be taken by the Departmental element reporting the
          problem; and

               f.   reflect critical milestones that are in line with the direction of the Departmental element's
          strategic plan. 

     3.   REQUIRED FORMAT.  Action plans must include the categories detailed below.  (See
     Attachment 4 for a sample action plan.)

               a.   Title.  A descriptive name for the action plan.

               b.   Reportable Problem or Reportable Nonconformance.  Indicate whether the action plan
          relates to a reportable problem or a financial management system reportable
          nonconformance.

               c.   Headquarters Organization (Field Only) and Program or Administrative Function.
          Identify the cognizant Headquarters organization and the title of the program or
          administrative function, consistent with the Department's budget and reporting codes or
          the administrative functions in Attachment 3.  Reportable problems in crosscutting areas
          must identify the crosscutting area as the program or administrative function and the
          cognizant Headquarters element with programmatic responsibility for correcting it.

               d.   Description.  A brief explanation describing the reportable problem or
          nonconformance, its impact on the program or administrative function, and the root
          cause(s).  

               e.   Assessment of Progress.  A brief explanation of progress in implementing the milestones
          and alleviating the problem or nonconformance during the current reporting period.  If
          the last critical milestone is not the closure date of the problem or nonconformance, the
          projected month and year for closure must be indicated.  Any slippage in critical
          milestone dates during the current reporting period must be explained and the overall
          impact on the completion of the plan provided.

               f.   Critical Milestones.  

                         (1)  In chronological order, provide the key tasks and target dates representing
               broad events required to correct the problem and its root cause(s).

                         (2)  All critical milestones must list an "Original Target Completion" date by month
               and year.  This is the date included in the original action plan as the proposed
               completion of the milestone and must stay the same through closure.  A
               "Revised Target or Actual Completion" date denoted by month and year must
               be listed if:

                                   (a)  the milestone target completion date has been revised, in which case the
                    most current date must be listed; or

                                   (b)  the milestone has been completed, in which case the completion month
                    and year must be listed.  

                              Critical milestones completed during the current year should correspond with
               planned actions indicated on the prior year's plan.

               g.   Success Indicators for Closed Action Plans.  A statement provided only for those
          reportable problems or nonconformances that are being closed.  Briefly describe the
          qualitative or quantitative success indicators used to show completed actions have
          eliminated the problem or nonconformance and its root cause(s).  

               h.   Name, Title, and Date.  Provide the name and title of the manager responsible for
          reporting problems or nonconformances to the next higher level of management and the
          date the action plan was prepared or updated.
     4.   SUBMITTING ACTION PLANS WITH ASSURANCE MEMORANDUMS.  An action
     plan for reportable problems and reportable nonconformances must be submitted with the
     Departmental element's annual assurance memorandum.  In addition, a cover sheet providing
     an index and crosswalk for the action plans submitted is required.  The cover sheet should
     include the following information:

               a.   program, as indicated by the Department's budget and reporting code, or
          administrative function included on the applicable action plan;
               b.   title of the action plan; 
               c.   responsible Headquarters organization; 
               d.   closed or open designation; and 
               e.   page number.

          The information above should be included for new action plans and action plans from the
     previous year that continue to be reportable.  Departmental elements should also include
     information on action plans reported previously that have closed during the reporting year. 
     Finally, Departmental elements should include updated Departmental challenge action plans
     under their responsibility with their year assurance memorandum.  Attachment 4 includes a
     sample format for the index and crosswalk.

     5.   DEPARTMENTAL ACTION PLANS.  Each of the Departmental challenges will have a
     corresponding action plan including assignment of a responsible program manager(s) and the
     office responsible for each critical milestone. 

          Responsible offices should also ensure that appropriate planned critical milestones are included
     in subsequent year's performance plans.  Inclusion will help to ensure actions necessary for
     closure are completed within the timeframe intended.  Action plans related to the Departmental
     challenges will be updated yearly by responsible program organizations and tracked by the
     Office of Chief Financial Officer.
                            CHAPTER VI

                            REPORTING


     1.   GENERAL.  Heads of Departmental elements must report annually on the management
     controls and financial management system(s) in their respective programs and administrative
     functions.  The following factors must be considered, where applicable, in preparing the annual
     report:

               a.   current year summary management review and related action plans;
               b.   status of reportable problems identified in the prior year;
               c.   status of actions taken to correct problems previously reported by the Secretary;
               d.   current financial management system review and related action plans; and
               e.   major contractors' management controls and financial management systems.

          Headquarters annual assurance reports must, if applicable, summarize field and/or
     Headquarters reportable problems at the overall DOE level.  The annual assurance reports
     must not supercede, but must build on, the reporting required under other Departmental
     programs.

     2.   REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.  Departmental elements' annual assurance reports must
     include an assurance memorandum and action plans for correcting reportable problems and/or
     financial system reportable nonconformances.  The DOE Office of Chief Financial Officer must
     issue detailed reporting requirements annually that contain specific information on preparing the
     current year's report.  These annual instructions will incorporate the Office of Management and
     Budget's current reporting requirements, specify current Department-wide sensitive areas,
     provide current year report dates, and outline the language to be used in the annual assurance
     report.  (See Attachment 4 for a sample assurance memorandum.)  The basic requirements are
     as follows:

               a.   Assurance Memorandum.  The annual assurance memorandum is a high-level
          document that presents salient issues of concern to the next higher level of management
          and should be prepared in an executive summary fashion.  It must include the following:

                         (1)  A statement that management controls were reviewed using all known
               information, including assurances from major contractors, and that underlying
               management principles incorporating the General Accounting Office's
               Standards for Internal Controls in the Federal Government were
               considered.  

                         (2)  A statement that current Department-wide sensitive areas (identified annually in
               the reporting instructions issued by the Office of Chief Financial Officer) have
               been considered and whether or not deficiencies were identified.  

                         (3)  A statement that there is or is not reasonable assurance that management
               controls were working effectively and programs and administrative functions
               were performed economically and efficiently consistent with applicable laws;
               property, funds and other resources were safeguarded; obligations and costs
               were proper; and accountability for assets was maintained.  

                         (4)  A statement that the financial management system does or does not comply
               with Government-wide financial management system requirements.  (Only
               organizations with financial management systems should include this statement.) 
               In addition, Departmental elements with major contractors must include a
               statement that the contractor financial management system does or does not
               conform to DOE requirements.

                         (5)  An executive summary of the reportable problems and system
               nonconformances in action plans attached to the assurance memo.  If
               reportable problems are being closed, the letter must also include a statement
               that actions taken have resolved the problem.  Cognizant Headquarters
               elements must include a statement indicating concurrences with reportable
               problem closures reported by field elements.

                         (6)  An optional brief summary of other significant issues facing the reporting
               Departmental element.  These are issues the head of the Departmental element
               believes meet the standard of a reportable problem, either as a current or
               emerging issue, but for which correction is outside the scope of their
               responsibility or operational authority.

               b.   Action Plan(s).  Plans for correcting reportable problems and financial management
          system reportable nonconformances identified in the Departmental element's assurance
          memorandum must be attached.  All milestones in Departmental challenge action plans
          must be incorporated into and represented by an action plan from the responsible
          organization.  The format and instructions for the action plan provided in Chapter V
          should be strictly adhered to.  Guidance for determining which problems and financial
          management system nonconformances should be reported are in Chapters III and IV,
               respectively.  
               
                           CHAPTER VII

                             TRACKING


     1.   GENERAL.  Departmental elements and the Chief Financial Officer must track all reportable
     problems and nonconformances identified during the year-end evaluation and reporting process
     to monitor the progress towards correction.  

     2.   TRACKING REQUIREMENTS.  Action plans for all reportable problems and
     nonconformances must be tracked through completion and validated to ensure intended results
     have been achieved.  The Department's management control tracking program is two pronged
     as described below:  

               a.   Departmental elements must locally track all reportable problems and reportable
          nonconformances.  Actions must be tracked through completion and validation that
          actions have produced intended results.  If reportable problems are identified by major
          contractors, Departmental elements may rely on the major contractors' systems to
          track problems and nonconformances if the contractor has adequate procedures in
          place to ensure adequate tracking occurs through closure.

               b.   The Office of Chief Financial Officer must track Departmental challenges reported by
          the Secretary.                       DEPARTMENTAL ELEMENTS


Except for the exclusions in paragraph 3c, this Order applies to all DOE elements, including NNSA. 
However, only the Departmental elements identified below are required to maintain a separate
management control program.  All other Departmental organizations must not establish separate
management control programs as required by this Order, but must participate in the programs
established by the respective Departmental elements to which they report.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY

FROM:  HEAD OF DEPARTMENTAL ELEMENT

SUBJECT:  Management Control and Financial Management System Review

In accordance with the Federal Managers' Financial Integrity Act, I have completed a summary
management review of the management controls for the (name of Departmental element) in effect as
of the fiscal year ending September 30,     .  The review was performed in conformity with
Departmental guidelines and accordingly included a review of whether the management controls comply
with underlying management principles which incorporate the General Accounting Office's Standards
for Internal Controls in the Federal Government.  The review included consideration of the results
of audit reports, internal management reviews, assurances from major contractors under my
cognizance, and all other known information.  In addition, our review considered the areas of (1)
environmental management, (2) nuclear safety management, and (3) nonnuclear safety management,
and no problems were identified.  The results of the review indicate there is (is not) reasonable
assurance that the management controls were working effectively and that program and administrative
functions were performed in an economical and efficient manner consistent with applicable laws;
property, funds, and other resources were safeguarded against waste, waste, loss, unauthorized use or
misappropriation; obligations and costs were proper; and accountability for assets was maintained.  The
concept of reasonable assurance recognizes that management controls must be cost effective, and there
is always some potential for errors or irregularities to go undetected.

The above review did, however, (did not) disclose the following (any) reportable problems.   

An evaluation of the financial management system for the (name of Departmental element) has also
been conducted in accordance with DOE guidelines.  The results of the review indicate that the system
generally conforms (does not conform) with Federal financial management system requirements.  In
addition, the financial management systems of major contractors under my cognizance are in
conformance with DOE accounting policies and procedures.

The financial management systems evaluation did (did not) disclose the following (any) financial
management system reportable nonconformances.

Upon review of all reportable problem closures identified by field elements, we concur that with the
actions taken, closure is warranted.  (Optional Section) The review also disclosed the following
significant issues facing my organization.  While these issues may meet the definition of a reportable
problem, correction of these issues is outside the scope of my Departmental element's responsibility or
operational authority and, therefore, I have attached no action plans.

The attachment to this report contains the action plans for correcting reportable problems of the
management control system and reportable nonconformances of the financial management system.            200X INDEX AND CROSSWALK FOR ACTION PLANS

Title:  Ineffective Management of Projects at DOE Laboratory

Action Plan:                     Reportable Problem:   X       Reportable Nonconformance:                        
HQ Organization:   CR     Program/Admin. Function:    Program/Project Management  

Description:  Performance of DOE Laboratory in the area of project management was evaluated as
"needs improvement."  The "needs improvement" assessment reflects problems/weaknesses in project
management.  These weaknesses have been particularly evident in several key projects at the
Laboratory that have experienced severe problems maintaining schedule, staying within budget, and
maintaining the expected level of quality.  This performance problem is critical at this time because the
Department plans to invest nearly one billion dollars in new projects at the Laboratory over the next five
years.

The key weaknesses identified include (1) poor project development and baseline definition, (2) failure
to integrate program and project management, (3) lack of implementation and enforcement of project
controls by the Laboratory, and (4) insufficient oversight.  Continued poor project performance at the
Laboratory could impact the Laboratory's capability to meet assigned missions.

Assessment of Progress:  In response to the identified project management deficiencies, the Department
and Laboratory have undertaken additional assessment activities to determine root causes, corrective
actions, and implementation strategies required to fully establish and maintain an effective construction
project management program and ensure proper management of the Stockpile Management at the
Laboratory.  A key result of these efforts was the formulation of a Nuclear Construction Projects Office
(NCPO) within the field site in July of 1997.  The NCPO was established to provide a single DOE field
line management organization responsible for management oversight of projects at the Laboratory.  The
NCPO includes both field office and site personnel, and therefore, previously cited actions were
incorporated into the formulation of the new office.                                                      Page 2 of 2

Formal project reviews occur monthly, with "at risk" projects.  Several of the Laboratory's projects
have turned around and been taken off the Chief Operating Officer's watch list.  DOE staff now also
participate in the generation, negotiation, and assessment of contract performance measures for the
laboratory related to project management.

      Date:    September 16, 200X                                             
                           DEFINITIONS


     1.   Action Plans describe reportable problems or reportable financial management system
     nonconformances, their root cause(s), and the actions planned for correcting them.

     2.   Assurance Report is an annual report from heads of Departmental elements on the status of
     management controls and financial management system(s) within their respective programs and
     administrative functions.

     3.   Departmental Challenge is a reportable problem determined to be of significance at the overall
     Departmental level, warrants the attention of the President and/or Congress, and is reported by
     the Secretary.

     4.   Financial Management Systems are systems both manual and automated used to collect,
     classify, analyze, and report data for financial decision making; process, control, and account
     for financial transactions and resources; formulate and execute the budget; and generate
     financial information in support of the Department's mission.

     5.   Major Contractors is a term used to describe the universe of contractors responsible for the
     management and operation of Department-owned facilities.  These may include management
     and operating contractors, integrated, integrating contractors, etc.

     6.   Management Controls (internal controls) are the organization, procedures and methods
     managers use to achieve their goals.  They include processes for planning, organizing, directing,
     and controlling operations.  Management controls are designed to reasonably assure that
     programs achieve intended results; resources are used consistent with DOE's mission and are
     protected from waste, loss, unauthorized use, and misappropriation; laws and regulations are
     followed; and decisions are based on reliable data.  Management controls apply to all programs
     and administrative functions.

     7.   Programs and Administrative Functions are the Departmental element's programs and
     administrative functions subject to evaluation and reporting.

     8.   Reportable Nonconformance is a financial management system nonconformance with Office of
     Management and Budget and General Accounting Office requirements that is of concern to the
     next higher level of management.  Chapter IV contains specific criteria to aid managers in
     determining whether a nonconformance is reportable.

     9.   Reportable Problem is a problem that generally would be of concern to the next higher level of
     management.  Chapter III contains specific criteria to aid managers in determining whether a
     problem is reportable.

     10.  Responsible Manager is a manager responsible for a specific program or administrative
     function.

     11.  Sensitive Area is an area identified by the Office of Chief Financial Officer in its annual year-
     end reporting guidance which must be identified as a separate program in each Department
     element's list of programs and administrative functions, regardless of funding level.

     12.  Significant Issue is an issue reported by the head of a Departmental element which meets the
     standard of a reportable problem either as a current or emerging issue, but for which correction
     is outside the scope of their responsibility or operational authority.

     13.  Summary Management Review is an annual evaluation of a Departmental element's programs
     and administrative functions based on day-to-day knowledge and existing evaluations.  It is an
     overall look at an operation and provides a framework for identifying and summarizing
     inadequate management controls and reportable problems.

     14.  Summary Financial Management System Review is an annual evaluation of the Departmental
     element's financial management system to determine if it conforms to Federal financial
     management system requirements.
