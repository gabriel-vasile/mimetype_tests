                 MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER 

    Adopted:  September 19, 1996  Released:  September 25, 1996

By the Chief, Cable Services Bureau:

                           INTRODUCTION

      1.On April 18, 1996, Multimedia Cablevision, Inc. ("Multimedia") filed a Petition for
Revocation challenging the certification of Lenoir County, North Carolina ("the County") to regulate
Multimedia's rates for basic cable service and associated equipment.  The County did not file an
opposition.
     
      2.Section 623(a)(4) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended,
("Communications Act") allows franchising authorities to become certified to regulate basic cable
service rates of cable operators that are not subject to effective competition.  To qualify for
certification, a franchising authority must confirm that it has the legal authority and personnel to
regulate rates, that it will adopt and administer regulations that are consistent with the Commission's
rules, and that interested parties will be provided with a reasonable opportunity to comment during
rate proceedings.  Certification becomes effective 30 days from the date of filing unless the
Commission finds that the franchising authority does not meet the statutory certification
requirements.  Cable operators may file petitions for reconsideration of the franchising authority's
certification within 30 days from the date such certification becomes effective.  After that time
period has expired, a cable operator may challenge a franchising authority's certification by filing
a petition for revocation.  Grounds for revocation of a franchising authority's certification include,
inter alia, the nonconformity of state and local laws to the Commission's rate regulations.  

                            DISCUSSION

      3.In its petition, Multimedia argues that the County's certification to regulate basic
service tier rates should be revoked because the County did not properly apply the Commission's
rules in rendering a local rate order.  Multimedia explains that, on November 6, 1995, it submitted
to the County FCC Form 1210, setting forth justification for a proposed increase in basic service tier
rates.  Multimedia alleges that, on December 4, 1995, the County issued a Resolution denying the
requested rate increase.  Multimedia argues that the County's denial is inconsistent with the
Commission's rules and procedures for review of basic service tier rates.  Specifically, Multimedia
contends that the County ignored applicable benchmark methodology for determining the permitted
basic service tier charge, and based its denial of a rate increase on irrelevant factors.  Although
Multimedia filed an appeal of the County's rate order which is currently pending, Multimedia also
requests that the Commission revoke the County's certification to regulate basic service tier rates on
the grounds that the County is "neither willing nor able to administer a rate regulation scheme that
is consistent with the Commission's rules and procedures."

      4.If the Commission, after granting the franchising authority reasonable opportunity
to comment and cure any minor nonconformance, determines that state and local laws and
regulations are not consistent with the Commission's rules, the Commission shall revoke the
certification of the franchising authority.   Here,  Multimedia has filed an appeal of the County's
rate order alleging that the County's action with respect to Multimedia's rate filing was inconsistent
with Commission regulations. We believe that the issue is properly addressed in that context, and
that revocation of the County's certification prior to any determination in the appeal case would be
premature and unwarranted.  We note that Multimedia's petition for revocation is based on the
allegation that the local rate order, rather than any local regulation, is inconsistent with the
Commission's rules.  Section 76.944 of our rules provides a remedy for such claims in the form of
a right to appeal rate decisions issued by local franchising authorities to the Commission. 
Multimedia is pursuing this remedy.  If, in its appellate review, the Commission finds that the
County has not properly applied federal cable rate regulatory rules in considering Multimedia's rate
filing, the Commission will remand matters to the local franchising authority to allow it to correct
the rate order on which Multimedia bases its revocation claims in this proceeding.  This is the
appropriate procedure set forth in our rules.  If we should determine that the County's rate order is
inconsistent with Commission regulations, the County must be given an opportunity to cure this
defect, under Section 76.914(a)(2) of our rules. 

      5.Given the extensive overlap between Multimedia's rate appeal and its petition for
revocation, we believe that it is appropriate that we dismiss Multimedia's decertification request at
this time, without prejudice to its being refiled should circumstances warrant.  In the interim, specific
issues, if any, relating to rate setting by the County may continue to be brought to the Commission's
attention through the rate appeal process set forth in our rules.

                         ORDERING CLAUSES

      6.Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that the Petition for Revocation filed by Multimedia
Cablevision, Inc., against Lenoir County, North Carolina IS DISMISSED WITHOUT
PREJUDICE.

       7.This action is taken by the Chief, Cable Services Bureau, pursuant to authority
delegated by Section 0.321 of the Commission's rules.
