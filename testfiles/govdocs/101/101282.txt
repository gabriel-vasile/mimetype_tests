 1.  Commco  argues  that  by  dismissing  amendments  to  pending  39  GHz  applications  filed  on  or  after  December  15,  1995,  the  Commission  "improperly  amended"  its  finding  in  the  NPRM  and  Order  that 
 such  amendments  are  "of  right."  1  However,  Commco's  argument  ignores  the  fact  that  the  freeze  portion  of  the  NPRM  and  Order  provided  notice  that  such  amendments  would  no  longer  be  accepted  for  processing. 
 Consequently,  although  we  found  that  amendments  filed  prior  to  the  NPRM  and  Order  should  be  processed  "of  right,"  any  former  right  to  amend  a  pending  39  GHz  application  ended  with  the  release  of  the  NPRM  and 
 Order.  2 
 2.  Commco  further  argues  that  Sections  101.29(  a)  3  and  101.45(  f)(  2)  4  of  the  Commission's  Rules  provide  that  an  applicant  may  amend  an  application  "as  of  right,"  and  that  the  Commission  violated 
 those  rules  when  we  dismissed  amendments  to  39  GHz  applications  filed  on  or  after  December  15,  1995.  5  For  the  reasons  set  forth  below,  we  disagree.

 3.  Section  101.29(  a)  generally  states  that  pending  applications  that  are  not  designated  for  the  random  selection  process  may  be  amended  "as  a  matter  of  right."  6  It  is  well  established  that  the  mere  filing  of 
 an  FCC  application  vests  no  rights  in  an  applicant.  7  Moreover,  as  stated  above,  any  right  to  amend  a  pending  39  GHz  application  ended  with  the  release  of  the  NPRM  and  Order.  8  We  stated  in  the  NPRM  and 
 Order  that  amendments  to  pending  applications  would  not  be  accepted  for  filing  on  or  after  December  15,  1995.  9  In  addition,  Section  101.45(  f)(  2)  does  not  provide  an  applicant  with  a  vested  right  to  amend  its 
 application.  Rather,  it  provides  an  exception  to  the  general  rule  that  pending  applications  amended  by  major  amendments  are  considered  "newly-  filed"  and  lose  their  place  in  the  processing  line.  10 


 4.  Some  parties  argue  that  by  dismissing  amendments  to  pending  39  GHz  applications  intended  to  resolve  mutual  exclusivity  filed  on  or  after  December  15,  1995,  the  Commission  violated  Section 
 309(  j)(  6)(  E)  of  the  Communications  Act.  11  Contrary  to  those  assertions,  by  dismissing  the  subject  amendments  and  unripe  applications,  we  did  not  violate  our  statutory  mandate  to  "continue  to  use 
 engineering  solutions,  negotiation,  threshold  qualifications,  service  regulations,  and  other  means  in  order  to  avoid  mutual  exclusivity  in  application  and  licensing  proceedings."  12  The  Commission  conducted  the  instant 
 proceeding  in  response  to  a  petition  for  rulemaking  where  it  considered  implementing  new  technical  standards  for  the  39  GHz  band,  which  would  require  new  licensing  procedures.  13  It  froze  new  applications 
 for  39  GHz  licenses  because  of  its  concern  that  applications  filed  under  the  former  rules  may  not  conform  to  the  technical  and  service  requirements  being  considered.  14  For  the  same  reason,  it  froze  certain  amendments 
 to  pending  39  GHz  applications,  including  those  at  issue.  15  After  a  notice  and  comment  period,  as  required  by  the  APA,  16  the  Commission  determined  that  continuing  to  license  the  39  GHz  band  under  the  former 
 rules  would  run  contrary  to  its  proposed  regulatory  overhaul  and  decided  to  implement  competitive  bidding

 for  all  future  39  GHz  licensees.  17  Accordingly,  it  dismissed  "unripe"  pending  mutually  exclusive  39  GHz  applications  and  certain  amendments  thereto,  including  amendments  which  were  filed  on  and  after 
 December  15,  1995,  to  avoid  mutual  exclusivity  with  other  pending  applications.  18 
 5.  As  noted  in  the  preceding  paragraphs,  we  have  carefully  considered  our  obligations  under  Section  309(  j)(  6)(  E)  in  making  our  decision  to  uphold  the  dismissal  of  "unripe"  pending  mutually  exclusive 
 39  GHz  applications  and  amendments.  We  have  also  determined,  after  considering  our  Section  309(  j)(  6)(  E)  obligations,  to  process  those  39  GHz  applications  that  passed  the  30-  day  public  notice  period  as  of  the 
 release  date  of  the  Freeze  Order,  November  13,  1995,  and  all  associated  amendments  of  right  filed  before  the  release  date  of  the  Notice  of  Proposed  Rule  Making  and  Order,  December  15,  1995.  19  Further,  we  will 
 grant  those  pending  applications  that  are  not  mutually  exclusive  with  previously-  filed  applications.  20 
 6.  It  has  been  established  by  case  law  that  Section  309(  j)(  6)(  E)  does  not  require  us  to  adhere  to  an  outmoded  licensing  policy  in  order  to  avoid  mutual  exclusivity.  21  Section  309(  j)(  6)(  E)  merely  requires 
 that  we  take  certain  measures  to  avoid  mutual  exclusivity  "within  the  framework  of  existing  policies."  22  The  Commission's  decision  to  adopt  competitive  bidding  procedures  for  assignment  of  39  GHz  licenses  arose 
 from  the  changes  it  made  to  the  service  and  licensing  rules  for  the  39  GHz  band,  which  were  found,  pursuant  to  notice  and  comment,  to  serve  the  public  interest.  Thus,  we  conclude  that  Section  309(  j)(  6)(  E)  does  not 
 require  us  to  process  the  petitioners'  amendments,  because  they  were  submitted  under  a  regulatory  regime  that  is  no  longer  in  effect.  Accordingly,  we  affirm  our  decision  to  dismiss  all  amendments,  filed  on  or  after 
 December  15,  1995,  including  those  intended  to  resolve  mutual  exclusivity  among  pending  39  GHz  applications. 


 7.  Similarly,  we  do  not  believe  that  Section  309(  j)(  6)(  E)  requires  us  to  process  unripe  pending  mutually  exclusive  applications,  nor  are  we  required  to  foster  settlement  agreements  among  applicants  who 
 submitted  applications  under  the  former  processing  rules  and  policies.  Bachow  claims  that  it  reduced  its  channel  requests  in  compliance  with  the  Commission's  September  16,  1994,  Public  Notice,  23  which 
 contained  a  policy  statement  that,  inter  alia,  imposed  a  spectrum  cap  on  applicants  for  certain  39  GHz  services.  24  Bachow  states  that  it  was  unable  to  reach  agreements  to  resolve  mutually  exclusive  situations 
 with  non-  complying  applicants  before  the  unripe  pending  applications  were  dismissed.  25  Bachow  argues

 that  the  Commission  should  insist  that  all  pending  applications  conform  to  the  Public  Notice  before  dismissing  unripe  pending  application.  26  We  disagree.  The  Public  Notice  was  issued  pursuant  to  the  former 
 regulatory  regime,  and  the  fact  that  some  pending  applications  may  have  been  subject  to  dismissal  due  to  nonconformance  with  the  Public  Notice  is  inapposite.

 d.  Disposition  of  39  GHz  Applications  Meeting  the  Public  Notice  Requirement  as  of  November  13,  1995 
 8.  In  the  NPRM  and  Order,  the  Commission  expanded  upon  the  Freeze  Order  by  stating  that  39  GHz  applications  would  be  processed  if  they  were  not  mutually  exclusive  with  other  39  GHz  applications 
 at  the  time  of  the  Freeze  Order,  and  if  the  60-  day  period  for  filing  mutually  exclusive  applications  expired  prior  to  November  13,  1995.  27  Some  parties  argue  that  a  30-  day  cut-  off  period  --  not  a  60-  day  cut-  off  period 
 --  is  the  correct  requirement  for  processing  eligibility.  28  Section  309(  b)  of  the  Communications  Act  29  and  Section  101.37(  c)  of  the  Commission's  Rules  (former  Section  21.27(  c))  30  state  that  we  may  process  an 
 application  no  earlier  than  30  days  after  it  has  been  placed  on  public  notice.  Section  101.45(  b)(  2)  (former  Section  21.31(  b))  allows  competing  applications  to  be  filed  up  to  60  days  after  the  date  of  the  public  notice 
 listing  the  first  of  the  conflicting  applications  as  accepted  for  filing.  31  Subparts  (i)  and  (ii)  explain  that  the  cut-  off  date  is  the  earlier  of  two  dates: 


 (i)  Sixty  (60)  days  after  the  date  of  the  public  notice  listing  the  first  of  the  conflicting  applications  as  accepted  for  filing;  or  (ii)  One  (1)  business  day  preceding  the  day  on  which 
 the  Commission  takes  final  action  on  the  previously  filed  application  (should  the  Commission  act  upon  such  application  in  the  interval  between  thirty  (30)  and  sixty  (60) 
 days  after  the  date  of  its  public  notice).  32 
 9.  We  have  determined,  after  further  consideration,  that  those  39  GHz  applications  that  met  the  30-  day  public  notice  requirement,  but  not  the  60-  day  period  for  which  mutually  exclusive  applications  may 
 be  filed,  are  not  materially  different  than  those  applications  for  which  the  60-  day  period  for  filing  mutually  exclusive  applications  has  passed.  Specifically,  we  find  that  those  39  GHz  applications  that  meet  the  30-  day 
 public  notice  requirement  are  ripe  for  processing,  in  accordance  with  our  rules.  It  is  our  practice  to  process  applications  as  soon  after  the  close  of  the  30-  day  public  notice  period  as  possible.  Even  though  the 
 mounting  number  of  39  GHz  applications  created  complexities  that  generally  forestalled  our  processing  of  those  applications  until  after  the  60-  day  period  for  filing  mutually  exclusive  applications  had  passed,  we  find 
 that  those  applications  became  ripe  for  processing  on  day  31.  Therefore,  we  will  process  those  39  GHz  applications  that  passed  the  30-  day  public  notice  period  as  of  November  13,  1995  and  all  associated 
 amendments  of  right  filed  before  December  15,  1995,  and  grant  those  applications  that  are  not  mutually  exclusive  with  previously-  filed  applications.  We  find  this  action  to  be  in  the  public  interest  because  it  best 
 comports  with  the  plain  reading  of  our  rules,  and  promotes  regulatory  certainty  and  consistency.

 e.  Disposition  of  39  GHz  Applications  not  Meeting  the  Public  Notice  Requirement  as  of  November  13,  1995 
 10.  Some  petitioners  also  argue,  based  on  McElroy  and  Kessler,  that  the  Freeze  Order  announcing  that  the  Commission  would  no  longer  accept  for  filing  any  applications  for  new  39  GHz  licenses 
 filed  on  or  after  November  13,  1995,  33  constitutes  an  "accelerated  cut-  off"  period  requiring  us  to  process  all  39  GHz  applications  on  file  as  of  that  date.  34  As  an  initial  matter,  we  note  that  the  Commission  did  not  cut-off 
 the  processing  of  eligible,  ripe  applications,  rather  it  froze  application  processing  in  preparation  for  a  rulemaking  proceeding,  and  later  dismissed  applications  not  comporting  with  our  Rules  as  unacceptable  for 
 filing.  Further,  petitioners  misconstrue  McElroy  and  Kessler.  At  issue  in  McElroy,  was  whether  certain  public  notices  prevented  the  60-  day  cut-  off  period  for  filing  of  competing  applications  from  commencing 
 because  they  failed  to  adequately  notify  competing  applicants  by  including  the  phrase  "accepted  for  filing."  35  The  Court  found  that  the  public  notices  gave  adequate  notice  and  did  not  prevent  the  60-  day  cut-  off  period 
 from  commencing.  36 
 11.  Petitioners  also  cite  Kessler  as  a  basis  for  their  claim  that  the  Freeze  Order  imposes  an  accelerated  cut-  off  date.  37  However,  in  Kessler,  the  pertinent  issue  was  whether  it  was  arbitrary  and 
 capricious  for  the  Commission  to  fail  to  give  advance  notice  of  a  freeze,  and  the  Court  held  that  it  was  not.  38  Moreover,  the  application  freeze  imposed  in  Kessler  is  distinguishable  from  the  39  GHz  application  freeze. 
 In  the  underlying  proceeding  in  Kessler,  the  Commission  decided  that  it  was  in  the  public  interest  to  process  pending  applications  for  the  following  reason: 


 [T]  he  total  number  of  potential  grants  that  could  result  from  proposals  on  file  .  .  .  was  not  sufficiently  great  to  frustrate  the  ends  we  sought  to  accomplish  through  our  rulemaking. 
 We  decided,  therefore,  that  we  could  continue  to  process  those  cases,  without  substantial  sacrifice  of  our  basic  objectives.  39 


 The  Commission  then  amended  its  procedural  rules  "to  establish,  in  effect,  a  new  'cut-  off'  date  for  most  pending  applications,  this  new  date  acting  to  supersede  all  previous  cut-  off  lists."  40  This  "exceptional 
 treatment"  was  proposed  in  an  effort  "to  speed  up  the  disposition  of  applications  where  a  contest  had  ceased

 to  exist."  41  In  the  39  GHz  proceeding  --  unlike  the  underlying  proceeding  in  Kessler  --  the  Commission  found  the  large  volume  of  potential  grants  of  licenses  sufficiently  great  to  frustrate  the  goals  of  the  39  GHz 
 rulemaking.  42 
 12.  It  is  well  settled  that  the  Commission  "is  not  bound  to  adhere  to  a  procedure  just  because  it  was  once  adopted."  43  If  we  find  that  it  is  in  the  public  interest  to  hold  in  abeyance  the  acceptance  of 
 applications,  we  may  craft  a  freeze  to  fit  the  circumstances.  For  example,  in  one  proceeding,  the  Commission  suspended  acceptance  of  all  new  paging  applications  in  conjunction  with  a  proposal  to  convert 
 from  site-  by-  site  licensing  of  paging  channels  to  licensing  on  a  geographic  area  basis,  44  and  subsequently  modified  the  freeze  to  give  incumbent  licensees  with  operating  paging  systems  the  opportunity  to  file 
 primary  site  applications  for  sites  that  incrementally  expand  their  services  areas.  45  Further,  in  the  220-  222  MHz  band  proceeding,  the  Commission  imposed  a  freeze  on  the  filing  of  initial  and  modification 
 applications  due  to  the  volume  of  applications,  and  later  lifted  the  filing  window  for  non-  nationwide  220  MHz  licensees  who  sought  to  obtain  modification  of  their  authorizations  to  relocate  base  stations.  46  These 
 are  but  two  examples  of  how  the  Commission  has  crafted  procedural  rules  to  fit  the  circumstances. 
 13.  Moreover,  applications  that  do  not  comport  with  the  30-  day  public  notice  requirement  as  of  the  November  13,  1995  Freeze  Order  are,  under  our  rules,  unripe  for  processing.  As  discussed  above, 
 Section  101.37(  c)  (former  Section  21.27(  c))  of  the  Commission's  rules  states  that  we  may  process  an  application  no  earlier  than  30  days  after  it  has  been  placed  on  public  notice.  47  Thus,  those  applications  for 
 which  the  30-  day  public  notice  period  was  not  completed  by  the  November  13,  1995  Freeze  Order  are  permanently  foreclosed  from  becoming  ripe  for  processing.  To  find  otherwise  would  defeat  the  purpose  of 
 the  processing  freeze.  In  the  Report  and  Order  and  Second  NPRM,  the  Commission  found  that  because  the  39  GHz  band  is  subject  to  significantly  different  rules  than  the  ones  used  previously,  the  most  fair  and 
 reasonable  approach  concerning  pending  unripe  39  GHz  applications  was  to  dismiss  them,  without  prejudice,  and  allow  those  applicants  to  reapply  under  the  new  rules.  We  continue  to  believe  that  this 
 approach  adequately  balances  the  expectations  of  applicants  with  the  need  for  a  more  efficient  and  effective  system  for  licensing  use  of  the  39  GHz  band.

 f.  Emergency  Request  for  Stay 
 14.  DCT  filed  an  Emergency  Request  for  Stay  on  April  8,  1998,  requesting  that  we  stay  the  decision  to  dismiss  those  39  GHz  applications  that  were  not  resolved  of  their  mutual  exclusivity  as  of 
 December  15,  1995,  and  those  39  GHz  applications  that  had  not  passed  the  60-  day  cut-  off  period  as  of  November  13,  1995,  pending  final  resolution  of  all  challenges  to  the  Commission's  39  GHz  application 
 dismissal  policy.  Inasmuch  as  we  have  carefully  reviewed  the  substance  of  DCT's  request,  and  in  light  of  today's  decision  and  the  absence  of  prior  dismissal  of  the  pending  39  GHz  applications  subject  to  this 
 proceeding,  we  conclude  DCT  has  in  fact  received  the  relief  it  requested.  Moreover,  there  will  be  no  further  delay  in  implementing  the  dismissal  or  further  processing  of  the  above-  referenced  applications  because  this 
 Memorandum  Opinion  and  Order  resolves  the  issues  addressed  in  the  petitions  for  reconsideration.  We  therefore  dismiss  DCT's  request  for  stay  as  moot. 


 B.  SERVICE  AREAS 
 15.  In  the  NPRM  and  Order,  we  proposed  to  license  all  channel  blocks  in  the  39  GHz  band  using  BTAs,  and  we  solicited  comments  on  that  proposal.  48  Based  on  the  record  as  it  existed  at  the  time  of 
 the  release  of  the  Report  and  Order  and  Second  NPRM,  we  determined  that  BTAs  were  the  most  appropriate  geographic  areas  for  the  types  of  services  envisioned  for  the  39  GHz  band.  49  Explicit  in  this  determination 
 was  the  Commission's  expectation  that  39  GHz  licensees  and  Rand  McNally  would  execute  licensing  agreements  similar  to  those  in  other  services.  50  Subsequent  to  the  release  of  the  Report  and  Order  and 
 Second  NPRM,  new  developments  concerning  Rand  McNally's  copyright  interest  in  BTAs  lead  us  to  conclude  that  using  BTAs  as  service  areas  for  39  GHz  authorizations  could  result  in  extended  delays  in  the 
 39  GHz  licensing  process.  51  Thus,  on  our  own  motion,  after  reviewing  the  current  record,  we  reconsider  the  service  area  definitions  for  the  39  GHz  band  and  will  license  all  channel  blocks  in  the  39  GHz  band  using 
 Economic  Areas  (EAs).  52  We  believe  that  licensing  the  39  GHz  band  by  EAs  will  provide  ample  population  coverage  and  allow  licensees  the  flexibility  to  provide  many  different  types  of  services,  which  will  promote 
 an  equitable  distribution  of  licenses  and  services  among  geographic  areas,  encourage  economic  opportunities  among  a  wide  variety  of  applicants,  and  foster  investment  in  and  rapid  deployment  of  new  technologies  and 
 services.  53  In  addition,  by  using  EAs  we  will  better  serve  the  public  by  avoiding  the  potential  delays  in  the

 49  Report  and  Order  and  Second  NPRM,  12  FCC  Rcd  at  18610-  12.  In  reaching  the  conclusion  that  BTAs  would 
 be  the  most  appropriate  service  areas  for  anticipated  39  GHz  services,  we  stated  that  the  record  did  not  indicate  that  the  majority  of  39  GHz  licensees  would  seek  to  provide  services  over  vast  geographic  areas.  Hence,  we  noted  that  large 


 service  areas  such  as  MTAs  would  be  inappropriate  for  the  39  GHz  band.  See  Id.  at  18611.

 continued  licensing  of  the  39  GHz  band  under  the  new  licensing  approach  established  in  this  proceeding.  Accordingly,  a  total  of  175  authorizations  (172  EAs,  and  three  EA-  like  areas,  covering  Guam  and  Northern 
 Mariana  Islands;  Puerto  Rico  and  the  U.  S.  Virgin  Islands;  and  American  Samoa)  will  be  issued  for  each  39  GHz  channel  block.  54 


 C.  CHANNELIZATION  PLAN 
 16.  In  the  Report  and  Order  and  Second  NPRM,  we  determined  that  the  39  GHz  spectrum  could  be  used  to  offer  a  variety  of  terrestrial  services.  55  TRW,  Inc.  (TRW)  asks  that  we  ensure  that  some  of 
 the  global  spectrum  allocation  for  fixed  satellite  services  (FSS)  on  the  39  GHz  band  remain  available  for  next-  generation  satellite  networks.  Specifically,  TRW  entreats  us  to  limit  our  39  GHz  spectrum 
 channelization  plan  for  terrestrial  wireless  services  to  those  frequencies  below  39.5  GHz  in  order  to  provide  a  segment  of  the  spectrum  above  39.5  GHz  for  FSS.  56  TRW  requests  that,  at  a  minimum,  we  clarify  that 
 fixed  and  mobile  service  authorizations  in  the  39  GHz  band  "will  not  confer  exclusive  spectrum  rights,  and  that  fixed  and  mobile  licensees  should  be  required  to  coordinate  with  satellite  operators  to  facilitate  spectrum 
 sharing  to  the  extent  feasible."  57  TRW  also  suggests  that  a  limitation  on  elevation  angles  of  terrestrial  transmitting  equipment  would  "assist  spectrum  sharing  in  the  39  GHz  band."  58 


 17.  Several  parties  oppose  the  TRW  Petition,  and  request  that  we  affirm  the  current  channelization  plan  and  decline  to  reserve  the  39.5-  40.0  GHz  band  for  satellite  operators.  59  Both  ART  and 
 WinStar  correctly  assert  that  we  have  already  addressed  the  issue  of  reserving  the  39.5-  40.0  GHz  band  for  satellite  operators.  60  In  addition,  several  parties  maintain  that  sharing  between  terrestrial  and  satellite 
 services  in  this  segment  of  the  39  GHz  band  is  not  feasible.  61  WinStar,  for  example,  argues  that  interference 


 permitting  partitioning  and  disaggregation  in  the  39  GHz  band.  See  paras.  57-  62,  infra.  The  availability  of  these  options  will  enhance  39  GHz  licensees'  flexibility  regarding  system  design  and  service  offerings,  which  will  promote 
 the  efficient  and  diverse  use  of  the  39  GHz  band.

 concerns  would  freeze  fixed  terrestrial  services  out  of  significant  areas  surrounding  proposed  satellite  earth  stations  and  that  terrestrial  services  would  find  it  impossible  to  operate  under  the  severe  power  density  and 
 automatic  transmission  power  control  sought  by  satellite  operators  if  TRW's  proposal  is  adopted.  62  These  parties,  therefore,  request  that  we  not  revisit  our  earlier  decision  to  maintain  terrestrial  primacy  in  the  39.5- 
 40.0  GHz  band. 
 18.  We  find  that  TRW  has  not  provided  a  convincing  basis  for  altering  our  rules  for  this  band.  Further,  we  affirm  the  conclusion  that  altering  the  service  designation  in  the  39.5-  40.0  GHz  segment  of  the 
 band  is  not  in  the  public  interest.  As  we  stated  in  reaching  our  initial  decision  rejecting  TRW's  request,  we  believe  that  it  would  be  too  burdensome  to  "repack"  terrestrial  users  in  a  portion  of  the  band  below  39.5 
 GHz,  because,  among  other  things,  existing  licensees  could  be  required  to  purchase  new  equipment  or  change  frequencies.  63  In  addition,  we  explained  that  a  new  terrestrial  frequency  plan  would  be  required, 
 based  on  a  different  transmit/  receiving  separation,  which  would  be  costly  to  equipment  manufacturers  and  licensees.  64  Furthermore,  due  to  the  potential  for  interference  between  contemplated  ubiquitous  satellite  and 
 the  in-  place  high  density  operating  terrestrial  systems,  altering  the  current  allocation  of  the  39  GHz  band,  at  the  present  time,  would  not  serve  the  public  interest  and  would  be  inconsistent  with  the  outstanding 
 proposals  in  the  March  24,  1997,  Notice  of  Proposed  Rulemaking  in  IB  Docket  No.  97-  95.  65  Thus,  we  conclude  that  it  would  not  be  practical  to  implement  TRW's  request,  and  it  is  therefore  denied.  However,  we 
 reiterate  that  our  current  allocation  for  the  39  GHz  segment  of  the  band  contains  both  fixed  and  satellite  services  and,  as  noted  in  the  Report  and  Order  and  Second  NPRM,  our  action  here  does  not  constrain  our 
 ability  to  make  modifications  to  the  Table  of  Allocations  at  a  later

 time.  66  Nor  is  our  action  here  in  any  way  intended  to  constrain  wireless  licensees'  ability  to  deploy  satellite  earth  stations  in  the  39.5-  40.0  GHz  band.  67 
 D.  PERFORMANCE  REQUIREMENTS:  RENEWAL  AND  BUILD-  OUT 
 19.  Prior  to  the  Report  and  Order  and  Second  NPRM,  39  GHz  licensees  were  subject  to  the  Part  101  build-  out  rules,  which  required  station  construction  within  18  months  of  the  date  of  license  grant.  68 
 Licensees  authorized  before  August  1,  1996,  received  a  five-  year,  fixed  license  term  69  and  licensees  authorized  after  August  1,  1996,  received  a  ten-  year,  fixed  license  term.  70  Moreover,  at  that  time,  neither  the 
 Part  21  rules  nor  the  Part  101  rules  directly  provided  for  a  renewal  expectancy  at  the  time  of  license  expiration.  However,  in  the  Report  and  Order  and  Second  NPRM,  the  Commission  determined  that,  in  order 
 to  promote  flexibility  in  system  design  and  market  development,  it  would  combine  the  performance  standards  required  at  build-  out  with  the  requirements  for  a  renewal  expectancy  into  one  showing  of 
 substantial  service  at  the  time  of  license  renewal,  in  accordance  with  Section  101.17(  a).  71  It  further  determined,  at  that  time,  that  the  substantial  service  showing  be  made  18  months  prior  to  the  license 
 expiration  date  in  accordance  with  Section  101.15(  c).  72 
 20.  In  pleadings  responsive  to  the  Report  and  Order  and  Second  NPRM,  many  petitioners  ask  us  to  reconsider  our  decision  concerning  the  incumbent  renewal  deadline,  arguing  that  the  new  renewal 
 requirement  will  promote  inequity  between  the  incumbents  and  new  licensees.  73  These  parties  assert  that  incumbent  39  GHz  licensees  will  be  placed  at  a  disadvantage  due  to  a  shorter  period  of  time  in  which  to 


 66  See  Report  and  Order  and  Second  NPRM,  12  FCC  Rcd  at  18608-  09. 
 67  It  may  be  possible  and  desirable  for  a  licensee  to  deploy  both  terrestrial  and  satellite  facilities.  For  example, 
 terrestrial  facilities  may  be  deployed  in  more  densely  populated  urban  areas,  while  satellite  facilities,  particularly  "gateway"  type  facilities,  may  be  deployed  in  sparsely  populated  rural  areas.

 license  renewal. 
 72  Former  Rule  47  C.  F.  R.  §  101.15(  c),  as  amended,  required  a  39  GHz  licensee  to  file  a  renewal  form  18  months

 meet  the  performance  requirements.  74  ART,  for  example,  contends  that  the  renewal  deadline  is  "antithetical"  to  our  policy  of  ensuring  that  licensees  have  flexibility  and  time  to  acquire  necessary  capital  and  to  build-  out 
 their  systems.  75 
 21.  We  disagree  that  the  renewal  requirements  adopted  in  the  Report  and  Order  and  Second  NPRM  cause  inequity  among  licensees  or  are  inconsistent  with  the  Commission's  stated  goals  in  this 
 proceeding.  Due  to  recent  developments,  however,  we  are  reconsidering  our  decision  regarding  renewal  requirements  on  different  grounds.  Subsequent  to  the  adoption  of  the  Second  Report  and  Order  and  NPRM, 
 the  Commission  streamlined  its  wireless  license  application  process  by  implementing  an  automated  licensing  system  and  integrated  database  for  the  wireless  services.  76  The  result  of  this  effort  was  the  Universal 
 Licensing  System  (ULS).  With  the  deployment  of  ULS,  the  Commission  intends  to  "improve  the  consistency  of  the  Commission's  rules  across  wireless  services  and  provide  a  single  point  of  reference  for 
 applicants"  by  consolidating  the  procedural  rules  governing  the  filing  and  processing  of  wireless  applications,  including  the  procedures  for  license  renewal,  into  Part  1  of  the  Commission's  Rules.  77  In  this 
 connection,  Section  101.15,  which  required  39  GHz  licensees  to  file  for  renewal  18  months  prior  to  the  licenses  expiration  date,  was  removed  and  replaced  by  Section  1.949  of  the  Commission's  Rules.  78  Section 
 1.949  requires  all  applications  for  renewal  of  station  authorization  to  be  filed  no  later  than  the  license  expiration  date  and  no  earlier  than  90  days  prior  to  the  expiration  date.  79  A  showing  of  substantial  service 
 must  also  be  made  at  that  time  that  an  application  for  renewal  of  station  authorization  is  filed.  We  believe  that  this  approach  better  comports  with  our  goal  in  this  proceeding  of  promoting  flexibility  in  system  design 
 and  market  development.  Further,  this  approach  conforms  to  the  Commission's  intention  to  promote  consistency  across  the  wireless  services.  Thus,  under  the  new  ULS  guidelines  39  GHz  licensees  are  not 
 required  to  comply  with  the  18  month  filing  requirement  in  former  Section  101.15,  but  rather  should  refer  to  Section  1.949  for  license  renewal  requirements.  80  We  clarify,  however,  that  the  substantial  service

 75  ART  Opposition  at  5.  ART  also  contends  that  the  renewal  deadline  would  be  disadvantageous  to  those 
 licensees  who  intend  to  utilize  point-  to-  multipoint  technology.  It  contends  that  the  necessary  equipment  is  still  in  the  beta  testing  stage  and  won't  be  commercially  viable  until  very  close  to  the  first  substantial  showing  deadline.  Id.  at  6.

 performance  requirement  under  Section  101.17(  a)  remains  the  performance  standard  for  the  39  GHz  band  and  must  be  demonstrated  upon  license  renewal.  81 
 22.  Biztel  asks  that  we  amend  Section  101.63(  a)  to  reflect  that  39  GHz  licensees  are  exempted  from  compliance  with  Section  101.63(  a)  's  build-  out  requirement  of  mandatory  operation  within  18  months 
 from  the  initial  date  of  license  grant,  in  light  of  the  new  performance  standard  under  Section  101.17(  a).  82  We  find  that  this  clarification  comports  with  our  determination  in  the  Report  and  Order  and  Second 
 NPRM,  83  and,  thus,  we  amend  Section  101.63(  a)  to  read  as  follows: 
 Each  Station,  except  in  Local  Multipoint  Distribution  Services  and  the  38.6-  40.0  GHz  band,  authorized  under  this  part  must  be  in  operation  within  18  months  from  the  initial  date  of 
 grant.  84 
 23.  Finally,  AA&  T  et  al.,  Joint  Petitioners,  seek  clarification  that  incumbent  service  areas,  and  not  just  individual  links,  will  be  protected  from  the  operations  of  those  who  obtain  their  licenses  by 
 competitive  bidding.  85  Accordingly,  we  clarify  that  Section  101.147(  u)(  2)  --  which  compels  applicants  to  be  aware  of  any  grandfathered  links  within  their  EA  --  protects  all  incumbent  service  areas  from  the  operations 
 of  licensees  who  receive  their  licenses  by  competitive  bidding.  86  Thus,  Section  101.147(  u)(  2)  will  be  modified  to  read: 


 Applications  filed  pursuant  to  Section  101.1206  shall  identify  any  pre-  existing  rectangular  service  area  authorizations  that  are  located  within,  or  are  overlapping  with,  the  EA  for  which  the  license  is 
 sought,  and  the  provisions  of  Section  101.103  shall  apply  for  purposes  of  frequency  coordination  between  any  authorized  rectangular  service  area(  s)  and  EA  service  area(  s)  that  are  geographically 
 adjoining  and  overlapping.  87

 E.  LICENSING  RULES 
 1.  Antenna  Requirements 
 24.  The  Commission  requires  fixed  stations  operating  at  932.5  MHz  or  higher  to  utilize  transmitting  and  receiving  antennas  meeting  or  exceeding  the  appropriate  performance  standards  in  order  to 
 avoid  frequency  interference.  88  Thus,  it  generally  requires  the  use  of  either  Category  A  antennas,  or,  in  areas  not  subject  to  frequency  congestion,  Category  B  antennas.  89  However,  in  the  Report  and  Order  and  Second 
 NPRM,  the  Commission  did  not  require  utilization  of  Category  A  antennas  and,  in  fact,  advocated  the  use  of  a  variety  of  antennas,  including  omni-  directional  and  sectored  antennas,  in  order  to  promote  the  entry  of 
 point-  to-  multipoint  users  in  the  39  GHz  band  and  to  allow  those  users  more  flexibility  in  meeting  service  demands.  90  It  stated,  however,  that  if  a  licensee  utilizing  an  antenna  other  than  a  Category  A  antenna  causes 
 interference  which  cannot  be  resolved  among  the  licensees  involved  that  licensee  must  resolve  the  interference  by  replacing  its  antenna  with  a  Category  A  antenna,  or  one  with  better  performance.  91  One 
 petitioner  asks  that  we  exclude  omni-  directional  or  sectored  antennas  from  directional  Category  A  or  B  radiation  pattern  requirements,  reasoning  that  the  interference  replacement  requirement  confers  secondary 
 status  upon  point-  to-  multipoint  users  employing  those  types  of  antennas.  92 
 25.  As  discussed  in  the  Report  and  Order  and  Second  NPRM,  we  permit  various  types  of  antennas  for  use  in  the  39  GHz  band  because  Category  A  directional  antenna  may  be  too  restrictive  to  fulfill 
 the  requirements  of  diverse  system  configurations  in  the  39  GHz  band.  93  We  clarify,  however,  that  Category  A  and  B  radiation  pattern  requirements  do  not  apply  to  wide-  beam  antennas,  such  as  omni-  directional  and 
 sectored  antennas.  Point-  to-  multipoint  licensees  should  benefit  from  this  rule  modification  because  the  omni-  directional  and  sectored  antennas  "represent  a  more  cost-  effective  and  technically  suitable  alternative 
 to  traditional  narrowbeam  Category  A  antennas  when  deployed  in  a  point-  to-  multipoint  configuration."  94  However,  in  the  event  that  interference  difficulties  arise  as  a  result  of  the  use  of  wide-  beam  antennas  and  are 
 not  resolved  by  the  licensees,  we  reserve  the  right  to  employ  any  reasonable  method  necessary  to  resolve  the  interference,  including  requiring  the  use  of  better  performing  antennas. 


 88  47  C.  F.  R.  §  101.115(  c). 
 89  47  C.  F.  R.  §  101.115(  c)  defines  the  performance  standards  required  for  Category  A  and  B  antennas.  Category 
 A  antennas  have  a  higher  performance  standard,  for  example  they  radiate  less  energy  in  the  side  lobes,  thereby  lessening  the  chance  for  interference.

 2.  Frequency  Coordination  and  Power  Flux  Density  Limit 
 26.  In  the  Report  and  Order  and  Second  NPRM,  in  order  to  facilitate  coordination  between  39  GHz  licensees  licensed  in  adjoining  areas,  the  Commission  adopted  interim  frequency  coordination 
 procedures,  but  declined  to  establish  final  rules  concerning  maximum  field  strength  or  power  flux  density  (PFD)  limits  pending  the  results  of  the  National  Spectrum  Management  Association  (NSMA)  interference 
 study.  95  We  decided,  in  the  interim,  that  it  was  in  the  public  interest  to  continue  to  use  the  frequency  coordination  procedures  in  Section  101.103(  d)  of  our  rules,  as  amended,  with  the  following  modifications: 
 (1)  neighboring  co-  channel  and  adjacent  channel  licensees  must  coordinate  within  16  kilometers  of  an  adjacent  service  area  boundary,  and  (2)  licensees  that  receive  coordination  notifications  must  respond  within 
 10  days,  as  opposed  to  the  30  days  afforded  under  the  former  rules.  96 
 27.  Several  petitioners  express  concern  regarding  the  interim  coordination  boundaries  and  notification  response  time.  97  First,  regarding  coordination  boundaries,  one  party  contends  that  a  coordination 
 distance  of  16  km  for  39  GHz  services  is  not  enough  to  preclude  the  possibility  of  harmful  interference,  and  suggests  that  a  distance  of  50  km  be  used.  98  WinStar  disagrees,  maintaining  that  the  frequency  coordination 
 measures  are  interim  in  nature  and  that  "it  would  be  counterproductive  to  adopt  [permanent]  interference  measures"  prior  to  analyzing  the  results  of  the  NSMA  study.  99  We  concur  with  WinStar  as  we  have  received 
 no  notice  of  difficulties  to  date  with  the  interim  rule,  nor  to  our  knowledge,  have  incumbent  licensees  experienced  complications.  Therefore,  we  find  that  it  is  in  the  public  interest  to  retain  the  interim  rule 
 requiring  licensees  to  coordinate  frequency  interference  within  16  kilometers  of  an  adjacent  service  area  boundary,  pending  the  conclusion  and  analysis  of  the  NSMA  study.  100 


 28.  Second,  ART  and  WinStar  request  a  reduction  in  notification  response  time,  with  ART  requesting  a  decrease  from  10  to  5  business  days.  101  ART  argues  that  5  business  days  would  better  facilitate 
 the  ability  of  a  licensee  to  determine  the  impact  of  an  interference  problem  and  to  rapidly  meet  customer

 was  revised  pursuant  to  the  ULS  Report  and  Order  to  require  frequency  coordination  to  be  completed  prior  to  filing  an  application  for  regular  authorization,  or  a  major  amendment  to  a  pending  application,  or  any  major  modification  to  a 


 license.  Id.  Applicants  and  licensees  should  refer  to  47  C.  F.  R.  §  1.929  of  the  Commission's  Rules  for  a  classification  of  major  and  minor  filings.

 needs.  102  We  are  not  persuaded  that  a  shorter  response  time  will  necessarily  decrease  burdens  on  licensees  and  Commission  staff.  We  also  are  concerned  that  a  five-  day  response  time  could  unduly  burden 
 coordination  notice  recipients  by  forcing  them  to  rush  a  response  without  having  sufficient  time  to  fully  consider  the  relevant  technical  data  of  the  proposed  operation.  Thus,  we  conclude  that  a  reduction  in  the 
 notification  response  is  not  warranted  at  this  time. 
 3.  Partitioning  and  Disaggregation 
 29.  In  the  Report  and  Order  and  Second  NPRM,  the  Commission  stated  that  all  entities  eligible  to  hold  39  GHz  licenses  should  be  permitted  to  partition  and  disaggregate  spectrum  within  the  39  GHz 
 band.  103  It  stated  that  these  options  would  enhance  39  GHz  licensee  flexibility  with  respect  to  system  design  and  service  offerings.  104  Some  petitioners  incorrectly  read  these  rules  to  mean  that  these  options  are  not 
 available  to  incumbent  licensees.  105  We,  therefore,  clarify  that  all  39  GHz  licensees,  including  incumbents  and  those  who  obtain  their  39  GHz  license  by  competitive  bidding,  may  partition  and  disaggregate. 


 30.  Although  the  Report  and  Order  and  Second  NPRM  did  not  address  the  issue  of  combined  partitioning  and  disaggregation  agreements,  WinStar  requests  that  we  permit  this  type  of  arrangement.  106 
 The  Commission  has  previously  allowed  such  combinations  in  other  services  and  has  found  that  providing  licensees  such  flexibility  promotes  "competitive  service  offerings,  encourages  new  market  entrants,  and 
 ensures  quality  service  to  the  public."  107  Therefore,  in  keeping  with  the  underlying  purpose  of  this  proceeding,  i.  e.,  to  promote  flexibility  both  in  system  design  and  service,  and  to  encourage  new  entrants  into 
 the  market,  we  permit  all  39  GHz  licensees  to  enter  into  combined  partitioning  and  disaggregation  agreements. 


 31.  In  addition,  in  the  Report  and  Order  and  Second  NPRM,  the  Commission  decided  to  allow  partitioning  according  to  county  boundaries  or  geo-  political  subdivisions.  108  WinStar  requests  that  licensees 
 be  allowed  to  partition  along  any  licensee  defined  service  area  arguing  that  requiring  partitioning  along  geo-  political  subdivision  boundaries  is  "unduly  restrictive  and  will  diminish  the  utility  of  licensees'

 partitioning  abilities."  109  We  agree  with  WinStar's  concern  and  will  observe  the  policy  --  as  established  in  the  PCS  Order  --  of  allowing  licensees  to  determine  the  area  to  be  partitioned.  110  Therefore,  Section 
 101.56(  a)(  1)  111  is  amended  as  follows: 
 The  holder  of  a  EA  authorization  to  provide  service  pursuant  to  the  competitive  bidding  process  and  any  incumbent  licensee  of  rectangular  service  areas  in  the  38.6-  40.0  GHz  band 
 may  enter  into  agreements  with  eligible  parties  to  partition  any  portion  of  its  service  area  as  defined  by  the  partitioner  and  partitionee.  Alternatively,  licensees  may  enter  into 
 agreements  or  contracts  to  disaggregate  any  portion  of  spectrum,  provided  acquired  spectrum  is  disaggregated  according  to  frequency  pairs. 


 32.  WinStar  also  raised  the  issue  of  whether  licensees  utilizing  bidding  credits  should  be  permitted  to  partition  and  disaggregate  their  spectrum  in  the  same  manner  as  licensees  not  eligible  for  such 
 provisions,  and  favored  permitting  partitioning  and  disaggregation  by  such  licensees,  subject  to  our  unjust  enrichment  rules.  112  We  concur.  We  have  permitted  licensees  utilizing  bidding  credits  to  partition  and 
 disaggregate  their  spectrum  in  other  services,  and  we  find  no  reason  not  to  allow  39  GHz  licensees  to  have  the  same  opportunity.  113  By  this  action,  we  encourage  the  participation  of  those  who  desire  individual  links, 
 smaller  service  areas,  or  smaller  spectrum  blocks  in  the  provision  of  39  GHz  service.  Thus,  we  will  amend  Section  101.56(  i)  accordingly. 


 F.  SECOND  NOTICE  OF  PROPOSED  RULE  MAKING 
 33.  In  the  Second  NPRM,  the  Commission  sought  comment  on  the  appropriate  provisions  to  prevent  unjust  enrichment  and  ensure  effective  implementation  of  partitioning  and  disaggregation  in  the  39 
 GHz  service.  114  It  also  sought  comment  on  how  to  calculate  the  unjust  enrichment  payments  for  39  GHz  licensees  that  are  awarded  bidding  credits  and  subsequently  partition  or  disaggregate  to  a  business  not 
 qualifying  for  bidding  credits  or  not  qualifying  for  the  same  level  of  bidding  credits,  and  asked  commenters  to  address  whether  the  unjust  enrichment  payments  should  be  calculated  on  a  proportional  basis.  115 


 34.  Subsequent  to  our  issuance  of  the  Second  NPRM,  we  adopted  a  provision  in  Part  1  of  the  Commission's  Rules  for  all  auctionable  services  that  provides  a  uniform  approach  for  calculating  unjust

 enrichment  payments  in  the  context  of  partitioning  and  disaggregation.  116  Since  we  received  no  comments  addressing  the  issue  of  calculating  unjust  enrichment  payments,  we  will  adopt  the  uniform  procedures  set 
 forth  in  Sections  1.2111(  d)  117  and  1.2111(  e)  118  of  our  rules  for  the  39  GHz  service  and  amend  Section  101.56(  i)  accordingly.  As  a  result,  we  will  calculate  unjust  enrichment  payments  using  population  to 
 determine  the  relative  value  of  the  partitioned  area  and  the  amount  of  spectrum  disaggregated  to  determine  the  relative  value  of  the  disaggregated  spectrum.  119  Population  will  be  calculated  based  upon  the  latest 
 available  census  data.  The  Commission  has  consistently  adopted  this  approach  for  other  wireless  services,  including  most  recently  LMDS.  120  For  purposes  of  applying  our  unjust  enrichment  payments  when  a 
 combined  partitioning  and  disaggregation  is  proposed,  we  will  use  a  combination  of  both  population  of  the  partitioned  area  and  amount  of  spectrum  disaggregated  to  make  these  pro  rata  calculations.

 APPENDIX  B 
 REGULATORY  FLEXIBILITY  ACT 
 Supplemental  Final  Regulatory  Flexibility  Analysis 
 Memorandum  Opinion  and  Order 
 As  required  by  the  Regulatory  Flexibility  Act,  see  5  U.  S.  C.  §  603  (RFA),  an  Initial  Regulatory  Analysis  (IRFA)  was  incorporated  into  the  Notice  of  Proposed  Rulemaking  and  Order  (NPRM  and  Order)  in 
 this  proceeding.  121  The  Commission  sought  written  public  comment  on  the  proposals  in  the  NPRM  and  Order,  including  comment  on  the  IRFA.  A  Final  Regulatory  Flexibility  Analysis  (FRFA)  was  incorporated 
 in  the  Report  and  Order  and  Second  Notice  of  Proposed  Rule  Making  in  this  proceeding  in  ET  Docket  No.  95-  183.  122  This  present  Supplemental  FRFA,  associated  with  the  present  Memorandum  Opinion  and  Order 
 (MO&  O),  reflects  revised  or  additional  information  to  that  contained  in  the  FRFA.  123  This  supplemental  FRFA  conforms  to  the  RFA.  124 


 A.  Need  for,  and  Objectives  of,  the  Memorandum  Opinion  and  Order 
 This  MO&  O  addresses  petitions  for  reconsideration  and  clarification  received  in  response  to  the  Report  and  Order  and  further  simplifies  and  corrects  the  rules  implemented  in  the  Report  and  Order.  This 
 MO&  O  reconsiders  the  service  area  definitions  established  in  the  Report  and  Order  and  determines  to  license  all  channel  blocks  in  the  39  GHz  band  using  Economic  Areas  (EAs).  In  the  Report  and  Order,  the 
 Commission  determined  to  license  all  channel  blocks  in  the  39  GHz  band  using  Basic  Trading  Areas  (BTAs).  However,  due  to  recent  developments  concerning  Rand  McNally's  copyright  interests  in  BTAs,  the 
 Commission  has  determined  that  the  public  interest  would  be  better  served  by  licensing  all  39  GHz  channel  blocks  using  Economic  Areas  (EAs)  as  the  authorized  service  areas.  125 


 The  MO&  O  further  modifies  the  Commission's  geographic  partitioning  provisions  and  permits  the  use  of  partitioning  and  disaggregation  by  parties  taking  advantage  of  bidding  credits  under  our  competitive 
 121  Amendment  of  the  Commission's  Rules  Regarding  the  37.0-  38.6  GHz  and  38.6-  40.0  GHz  Bands,  ET  Docket 
 No.  95-  183,  Notice  of  Proposed  RuleMaking  and  Order,  11  FCC  Rcd  4930  (1995)  (NPRM  and  Order). 
 122  Amendment  of  the  Commission's  Rules  Regarding  the  37.0-  38.6  GHz  and  38.6-  40.0  GHz  Bands,  ET  Docket 
 95-  183,  Report  and  Order  and  Second  Notice  of  Proposed  Rule  Making,  12  FCC  Rcd  18600  (1997)  (Report  and  Order  and  Second  NPRM). 


 123  The  instant  MO&  O  also  addresses  petitions  for  reconsideration  of  a  prior  Memorandum  Opinion  and  Order 
 released  on  January  17,  1997  (Jan.  17  MO&  O).  The  prior  Jan.  17  MO&  O  modified  the  interim  filing  and  processing  rules  for  the  39  GHz  band.  However,  in  the  instant  MO&  O,  the  Commission  promulgates  no  additional  rules,  and  our 


 action  does  not  affect  the  previous  analysis.

 bidding  licensing  rules.  In  the  NPRM,  we  proposed  a  partitioning  scheme  with  respect  to  rural  telephone  companies.  Then,  in  the  Report  and  Order,  the  Commission  determined  that  the  option  of  partitioning 
 should  be  made  available  to  all  entities  eligible  to  be  licensees  in  the  39  GHz  band.  The  Commission  also  concluded  that  all  39  GHz  licensees  should  be  permitted  to  disaggregate  their  spectrum  blocks.  In  the 
 MO&  O,  we  have  clarified  that  incumbent  licensees  may  partition  and  disaggregate  their  non-  EA  licenses.  We  have  allowed  all  39  GHz  licensees  to  enter  into  and/  or  combine  existing  partitioning  and  disaggregation 
 agreements  and  we  have  permitted  licensees  to  define  their  own  partitioning  boundaries  along  licensee  service  areas  in  order  to  encourage  new  entrants,  including  small  businesses,  into  the  market.  We  will  enable 
 licensees  utilizing  bidding  credits  to  partition  and  disaggregate,  subject  to  unjust  enrichment  provisions. 
 In  the  MO&  O,  the  Commission  reconsiders  its  decision  regarding  license  renewal.  In  the  Report  and  Order,  the  Commission  required  a  showing  of  substantial  service  18  months  prior  to  the  license 
 expiration  date.  The  MO&  O,  however,  directs  39  GHz  licensees  to  comport  with  the  recently  implemented  Part  1  rules  governing  license  renewal  provided  in  Section  1.949  of  the  Commission's  Rules.  126  Section 
 1.949  requires  all  applications  for  renewal  of  station  authorization  to  be  filed  no  later  than  the  license  expiration  date  and  no  sooner  than  90  days  prior  to  the  expiration  date.  127  Finally,  the  Commission 
 considered  various  petitions  for  reconsideration  relating  to  the  dismissal  of  pending  39  GHz  applications  and  coordination  requirements.  The  rule  changes  made  herein  are  generally  minor  in  nature  and  are  focused  on 
 eliminating  confusion  and  promoting  the  public  interest. 
 B.  Summary  of  Significant  Issues  Raised  by  Public  Comments  in  Response  to  the  Final  Regulatory  Flexibility  Analysis 


 No  petitions  were  filed  in  direct  response  to  the  FRFA.  In  general,  the  12  petitions  for  reconsideration  of  the  Report  and  Order,  five  opposition  to  petitions  and  two  replies  were  not  directly 
 related  to  small  entities.  However,  one  petition  raised  several  issues  that  might  affect  small  entities  concerning  partitioning  and  disaggregation.  In  particular,  this  party  requested  that  the  Commission  allow  the 
 combination  of  partitioning  and  disaggregation  agreements  and  permit  39  GHz  licensees  to  define  their  own  boundaries  for  partitioning,  as  opposed  to  partitioning  according  to  county  lines  or  geo-  political 
 subdivisions.  128  Further,  Winstar  requested  that  licensees  utilizing  bidding  credits  be  permitted  to  partition  and  disaggregate  their  spectrum,  subject  to  the  unjust  enrichment  provisions  of  the  Commission.  129 


 C.  Description  and  Estimate  of  the  Small  Entities  to  Which  Rules  Will  Apply 
 In  the  previous  FRFA  in  this  proceeding,  we  determined  in  detail  the  description  and  estimate  of  the  following  small  entities  subject  to  these  rules  from  the  FRFA:  cellular  licensees,  Broadband  PCS  licensees,

 and  Point-  to-  Point  or  Point-  to-  Multipoint  licensees.  130  We  include  the  following  revision  of  the  estimate  for  broadband  PCS  Licensees:  The  broadband  PCS  spectrum  is  divided  into  six  frequency  blocks  designated  A 
 through  F,  and  the  Commission  has  held  auctions  for  each  block.  The  Commission  defined  "small  entity"  for  Blocks  C  and  F  as  an  entity  that  has  average  gross  revenues  of  less  than  $40  million  in  the  three  previous 
 calendar  years.  131  For  Block  F,  an  additional  classification  for  "very  small  business"  was  added  and  is  defined  as  an  entity  that,  together  with  their  affiliates,  has  average  gross  revenues  of  not  more  than  $15 
 million  for  the  preceding  three  calendar  years.  132  These  regulations  defining  "small  entity"  in  the  context  of  broadband  PCS  auctions  have  been  approved  by  the  SBA.  133  No  small  businesses  within  the  SBA  approved 
 definition  bid  successfully  for  licenses  in  Blocks  A  and  B.  There  were  90  winning  bidders  that  qualified  as  small  entities  in  the  Block  C  auctions.  A  total  of  93  small  and  very  small  business  bidders  won 
 approximately  40%  of  the  1,479  licenses  for  Blocks  D,  E,  and  F.  134  Based  on  this  information,  we  conclude  that  the  number  of  small  broadband  PCS  licensees  will  include  the  90  winning  C  Block  bidders  and  the  93 
 qualifying  bidders  in  the  D,  E,  and  F  blocks,  for  a  total  of  183  small  entity  PCS  providers  as  defined  by  the  SBA  and  the  Commission's  auction  rules. 


 D.  Description  of  the  Projected  Reporting,  Recordkeeping,  and  Other  Compliance  Requirements 
 There  are  no  general  reporting  or  recordkeeping  requirements  proposed  or  adopted  in  this  MO&  O. 
 E.  Steps  Taken  to  Minimize  Significant  Economic  Impact  on  Small  Entities,  and  Significant  Alternatives  Considered 


 The  use  of  EAs  as  authorized  service  areas  will  better  serve  the  public  interest.  Specifically,  EAs  will  provide  ample  population  coverage  and  allow  small  businesses  the  flexibility  to  provide  a  variety  of 
 services.  Further,  the  use  of  EAs  will  promote  an  equitable  distribution  of  licenses  among  various  geographic  areas  and  promote  economic  opportunity  among  a  wide  variety  of  applicants.  Finally,  those 
 licensees  seeking  service  areas  smaller  than  EAs  may  partition  or  disaggregate. 
 The  minor  partitioning  and  disaggregation  rule  changes  implemented  herein  will  further  facilitate  market  entry  by  small  entities  who  may  lack  the  financial  resources  for  participation  in  the  auctions, 
 including  small  businesses.  By  permitting  flexible  partitioning  and  disaggregation,  small  businesses  will  be

 able  to  obtain  licenses  for  smaller  service  areas  and  smaller  amounts  of  spectrum  tailored  to  meet  the  needs  of  their  proposed  service.  Finally,  allowing  geographic  partitioning  of  39  GHz  licenses  defined  by  the 
 parties  along  licensed  service  areas,  rather  than  only  by  county  lines  or  geo-  political  subdivisions,  will  permit  small  businesses  to  enter  the  marketplace. 


 The  license  renewal  procedures  governed  by  Section  1.949  of  the  Commission's  Rules  better  comport  with  the  Commission's  goal  of  promoting  flexibility  in  system  design  and  market  development 
 Further,  this  approach  fosters  uniformity  across  the  wireless  services.
