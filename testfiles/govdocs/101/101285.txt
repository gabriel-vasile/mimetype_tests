Subject:     Risk Management of New, Expanded, or Modified Bank Products 
             and Services
Description: Risk Management Process

     of National Banks, Department and Division Heads, Compliance
     Officers, and All Examining Personnel


PURPOSE

This guidance reminds national banks of the process they should
follow to prudently manage the risks associated with new,
expanded, or modified bank products and services.  Specifically,
it outlines the expectations of the Office of the Comptroller of
the Currency's (OCC's) expectations for banks' management and
boards to implement an effective risk management process.



The risk management principles outlined in this bulletin apply to
the introduction of traditional and non-traditional bank products
and services, as well as modifications to existing products and
services.  Modifications include changes in the terms or nature
of an existing product or service that significantly alter the
underlying risk characteristics of the product or service (e.g.,
significant changes in underwriting standards, geographic or
industry focus).


BACKGROUND

During periods of reduced net interest margins, stagnant growth
in traditional business lines, and increased competition, bank
managementrs and directors face many challenges in seeking to
improve the bank's financial performance.  Engaging in new,
expanded, or modified bank products or services is often
considered a solution.  However, if management and the board are
overly focused on expected returns, do not have a good
understanding of the inherent risks, or have poor governance
practices, the bank's ability to effectively measure, monitor,
and control the risks inherent in such products or services may
be compromised.

Recently, the OCC has seen banks that have not performed the
necessary up-front analysis to determine whether a potential new,
expanded, or modified product or service offers the appropriate
risk-versus-return profile and is consistent with the bank's
strategic direction.  Additionally, some banks have failed to
implement appropriate risk management controls and processes.  In
some cases, these oversight failures have resulted in costly
errors, unwarranted risk exposures, and deviations from the
bank's business plan.  Some historically well-managed banks have
found themselves faced with problems because bank management
underestimated its need to manage, monitor, and control the
development and implementation of a product or service.  Instead
of boosting net income, the product or service caused systems and
control problems, resulting in credit losses, compliance issues,
litigation exposure, unfavorable returns, and diminished
reputation in the marketplace.


RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS

The OCC expects bank management and the board to oversee all new,
expanded, or modified products and services through an effective
risk management process.  Failure to provide an effective risk
management process is an unsafe and unsound banking practice.  An
effective risk management process includes (1) performing
adequate due diligence prior to introducing the product, (2)
developing and implementing controls and processes to ensure
risks are properly measured, monitored, and controlled, and (3)
developing and implementing appropriate performance monitoring
and review systems.  The formality of the bank's risk management
process should reflect the size of the bank and the complexity of
the product or service offered.  Depending on these factors, it
may be appropriate for the bank to establish an executive
management committee to oversee development and implementation of
bank products and services.

Due Diligence

Before deciding to introduce a significant new, expanded, or
modified product or service to bank customers, management and the
board should conduct due diligence to ensure they have a
realistic understanding of the risks and rewards of the product
or service being considered.  Management and the board should
clearly understand the rationale for offering the product or
service.1

The due diligence process should include:

* Assessing how the risks associated with the new, expanded,
  or modified product or service fits with the bank's business
  strategy and risk profile.

* Consulting with relevant functional areas, such as credit,
  compliance, accounting, audit, risk management, legal,
  operations, information technology, and marketing, as well as the
  Treasury/Asset Liability Committee (ALCO) , to determine risks,
  concerns, and necessary controls.

* Determining requirements for complying with laws,
  regulations, and regulatory guidance.

* Determining the expertise needed to effectively manage the
  product or service, including the possible need to acquire
  additional expertise.

* Researching the background, experience, and reliability of
  relevant third parties.

* Developing a business and financial plan for the product or
  service that assesses the bank's competitive position and
  establishes objectives and strategies for how the product or
  service will be brought to market.

* Developing viable alternatives, including an exit strategy
  in the event the product or service fails to perform as expected.

Although the board may delegate performance of managerial duties
to others, it has the ultimate responsibility for ensuring that
the bank is run in a safe and sound manner.  In fulfilling its
responsibilities, the board or its designee must ensure that a
new, expanded, or modified bank product or service is consistent
with the bank's strategic goals.

Risk Management Controls and Processes

Once the bank decides to introduce a new, expanded, or modified
product or service and develops a business plan, the board and
management should develop and implement adequate risk management
processes to effectively control the risks of the activity.
These ThisSteps should include:

* Expanding and amending bank policies and procedures, as
  appropriate, to ensure that they adequately address the product
  or service.  Policies and procedures should establish
  accountability and provide for exception monitoring.

* Developing and implementing the information and reporting
  systems (MIS) necessary to monitor adherence to established
  objectives and to properly supervise the product or service.  MIS
  reports should contain key indicators to allow the board and
  management to effectively identify, measure, monitor, and control
  risk.

* Incorporating the product or service into the bank's audit
  and compliance processes to ensure adherence with bank policies
  and procedures and customer safeguards.

Performance Monitoring

Management and the board should have appropriate performance and
monitoring systems in place to allow them to assess whether the
product or service is meeting operational and strategic
expectations.  Such systems should:

ú    Include limits on the size of acceptable risk exposure that
  management and the board are willing to assume with the product
  or service.

* Identify specific objectives and performance criteria to
  evaluate success of the product or service.  The performance
  criteria should include quantitative benchmarks that will serve
  as a means to evaluate success of the product or service.

* Reflect a process that periodically compares actual results
  with projections and qualitative benchmarks, to detect and
  address adverse trends or concerns in a timely manner.

* Trigger changes in the business plan, when appropriate,
  based on the performance of the product or service.  Such changes
  may include exiting the activity should actual results fail to
  achieve projections.

Risk Management of Third Parties

Unique risks are involved when a bank obtains new, expanded, or
modified products and services through third-party vendors.
Inferior performance or service on the part of a vendor
mmay result in unexpected risks, including legal costs or loss of
business to the bank.  Although most vendors are reputable, their
products may be unproven, or the risks associated with the
product or service may conflict with bank safety and soundness
standards or compliance requirements.  In addition, the vendor's
services may not be appropriate for the bank's unique market,
personnel, or operating environment.  These risks can be
exacerbated by so-called "turn-key" arrangements that are
designed to provide the bank with only minimal involvement in the
administration and oversight of the product or service.

Bank management must ensure that it understands the risks
associated with the activity and conducts adequate due diligence
of the vendor, including assessing the proposed vendor's
reputation, products, and financial condition.  Management must
also implement an ongoing oversight program over the vendor's
activities and develop a contingency plan in the event the
vendor cannot perform as expected.  Management should not overly
rely on the vendor's assertions, representations, or warranties,
but should do its own analysis to ensure the vendor and its
products are a good fit for the bank.

OCC Bulletin 2001-47, Third Party Relationships: Risk Management
Principles, dated November 1, 2001, provides additional guidance
to national banks on managing the risks associated with third-
party vendors.  This bulletin is available through the OCC Web
site at http://www.occ.treas.gov/.


ASSOCIATED RISKS

Poor planning, oversight, or control may lead to an incomplete
assessment and understanding of the risks involved with new,
expanded, or modified bank products and services.  This section
highlights the primary risks that arise in the theirtheir
development and introduction.

Strategic Risk:  The risk to earnings or capital arising from
adverse business decisions or improper implementation of those
decisions.

Strategic risk arises when a bank offers products and services
that are not compatible with the bank's strategic goals or that
do not provide an adequate return on investment.  This kind of
risk increases when management introduces new, expanded, or
modified products or services without performing adequate due
diligence reviews or without implementing an appropriate risk
management infrastructure to oversee the activity.  Strategic
risk also increases when management does not have adequate
expertise and experience to properly oversee these products or
services.


Reputation Risk:  The risk to earnings or capital arising from
negative public opinion.

Reputation risk occurs when a bank offers new, expanded, or
modified products or services without fully understanding its
customers' business objectives or the economic purposes of the
transaction.  Reputation risk also arises when a bank stretches
for income by offering products or services that involve
practices or techniques that differ from the bank's standards.
Reputation risk increases with poor service, inappropriate sales
recommendations, or violations of consumer law, any of which may
result in litigation, adverse publicity, and loss of business.

Using third parties to offer products or services, or expanding
the use of existing third parties,  may also expose the bank to
reputation risk.  This risk increases when bank management fails
to closely monitor the quality and appropriateness of the
provider's products or services.  In cases where third-party
employees interact directly with bank customers, reputation risk
increases if interactions are inconsistent with the bank's
policies, practices, and standards.

Credit Risk:  The risk to earnings or capital arising from an
obligor's failure to meet the terms of any contract with the bank
or otherwise fail to perform as agreed.

Credit risk arises any time bank funds are extended, committed,
invested, or otherwise exposed through actual or implied
contractual agreements, whether reflected on or off the balance
sheet.  Since credit risk is found in all activities where
success depends on counter-party, issuer, or borrower performance,
it is often a key risk in new, expanded, or modified bank
products and services.

Transaction Risk:  The risk to earnings or capital arising from
problems with service or product delivery.

A bank is exposed to transaction risk when products, services, or
delivery channels do not fit with the bank's operational
capacity, customer demands, or strategic objectives.  Transaction
risk can increase with the implementation of new information
technology to support a new, expanded, or modified product or
service.  Failed or flawed technology, either from error,
inadequate capacity, or fraud, may result in the inability to
deliver products or services.

Compliance Risk:  The risk to earnings or capital arising from
violations of laws, rules, or regulations, or from nonconformance
with internal policies and procedures or ethical standards.

Compliance risk arises when new, expanded, or modified bank
products or services are not properly monitored for compliance
with law, ethical standards, or the bank's policies and
procedures.  The potential for serious or frequent violations or
noncompliance increases when a bank's oversight program does not
include appropriate audit and control features.  Compliance risk
increases when the privacy of customer records is not protected,
when conflicts of interest between a bank and affiliated third
parties are not appropriately managed, and when a bank or its
service providers have not implemented appropriate information
security programs.  Compliance risk also increases from
inadequate accounting practices.



Other Potential Risks:

Depending on the product or service, a bank may be subject to
increased liquidity, interest rate, price, or even foreign
currency translation risk.  Such risks will increase if bank
management does not have a solid understanding of all risks
involved with proposed products and services and does not take
all appropriate steps to control risks prior to introducing the
product or service.


SUPERVISORY MONITORING

The OCC's primary supervisory objective is to ensure that a bank
does not assume more risk than it can effectively manage.

As part of ongoing supervision, OCC examiners will review
significant new, expanded, or modified bank products and
services, consistent with the OCC's supervision-by-risk
framework.  In particular, examiners will consider a product or
service's impact on the bank's risk profile, and the
effectiveness of a bank's product risk management program,
including due diligence and oversight monitoring efforts.
Examiners will be critical of banks that have not established
appropriate risk management processes.

Bank management should discuss their plans with their OCC
examiner-in-charge or supervisory office before developing and
implementing new, expanded, or modified products or services,
particularly if the new activity constitutes a significant
deviation from the bank's existing business plan.2
