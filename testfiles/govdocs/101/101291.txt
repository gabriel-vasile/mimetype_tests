1.  SCOPE

This document establishes standard requirements for the application of
protective coatings to prevent corrosion of exposed carbon steel, stainless
steel, and aluminum.  This standard is applicable to launch structures,
facilities, and ground support equipment.  It provides a design standard to
experienced corrosion control engineers for the development of
specifications including requirements for materials, equipment, safety,
procedures, and quality assurance inspections.  Due to the ever changing
environmental considerations, new advances in corrosion technology and the
wide array of possible applications, this document should not be used as a
stand-alone specification that meets every contingency.  Refer to 6.1 for
the intended use and surfaces to be coated according to this standard.

1.1  Zones of Exposure. - The following zones of exposure are established
to define coating system requirements for surfaces located in specific
environments:

        a. Zone 1. - Surfaces that receive rocket engine exhaust
        impingement.

        b. Zone 2. - Surfaces that receive elevated temperatures [above 65
        degrees Celsius (above 150 degrees Fahrenheit)] and acid
        deposition from solid rocket booster exhaust with no exhaust
        impingement.

        c. Zone 3. - Surfaces, other than those located in Zones 1 or 2,
        that receive acid deposition from solid rocket booster exhaust
        products or that receive other types of chemical contamination
        (e.g., cooling towers, diesel exhaust stacks, etc.).

except for Zone 5 exposures.

3.5.1.2.2  Surface Preparation of
Galvanizing.

               CAUTION

Some galvanized configurations are
susceptible to distortion when they
are abrasive blasted.  Special care
shall be taken to ensure against
any metal distortion by reducing
blast nozzle pressure and
increasing the working distance
from nozzle to surface.  In some
cases, such as in the surface
preparation of light-gage sheet,
these precautions may not be
sufficient to prevent distortion;
and alternate procedures, such as
abrading or mechanical cleaning,
must be used to remove corrosion or
roughen the surface.  Galvanized
surfaces shall be abrasive blasted
with fine abrasives conforming to
the requirements in 3.1.1 to remove
corrosion and old coatings or
roughen new surfaces.  The blasted
surface shall be free of all
corrosion and foreign matter and
have a uniform, slightly roughened
appearance.

               NOTE

High-strength steels are
susceptible to embrittlement by
hydrogen during the galvanizing
process.  Steel components with an
ultimate tensile strength above 900
megapascals (MPa) [130 kips per
square inch (ksi)] or hardness
above Rockwell C Hardness 28 shall
not be galvanized.

Galvanized surfaces to be further
topcoated shall be prepared by
degreasing in accordance with
3.4.2.1 prior to any additional
surface preparation.  After
degreasing, abrasive blasting or
mechanical cleaning shall be
performed as required by the zone
of exposure.  If galvanized steel
is prepared for the application of
coatings by abrasive blasting, it
shall be lightly brush blasted with
fine abrasive at a lower pressure
of 275 to 420 kPa (40 to 60 psi) to
provide a corrosion-free and
uniform, slightly roughened
surface.  Care shall be taken not
to completely remove the galvanized
finish.  The zinc coatings shall be
maintained or rendered clean, dry,
and free from contaminants prior to
the application of topcoat systems.
Field repair of damaged galvanizing
shall be accomplished in accordance
with ASTM A780 using inorganic zinc
coatings.

Galvanized steel that is to be
mechanically cleaned shall be
cleaned in accordance with SSPC SP-
3 using abrasive discs/sheets, or
other approved methods.  All
corrosion and foreign matter shall
be completely removed and the
entire surface slightly roughened.

        are required, except for
        color coding, safety,
        identification, or special
        conditions.  When topcoats
        are required, the surface
        shall be degreased and a
        wash primer applied to a
        DFT of 10 to 15
        micrometers (0.4 to 0.6
        mil).  Within 8 hours, a
        polyurethane finish coat
        conforming to 3.1.2 shall
        be applied to a DFT of 40
        to 75 micrometers (1.5 to
        3 mils).

3.5.2  Protection of Aluminum.

3.5.2.1  Surface Preparation of
Aluminum.

                    CAUTION

Some aluminum configurations are
susceptible to distortion and/or
destruction when they are abrasive
blasted.  Special care shall be
taken to ensure against any metal
damage by choice of abrasive
aggregate and by reducing blast
nozzle pressure and increasing the
working distance from nozzle to
surface as necessary.  In some
cases, such as in the surface
preparation of light-gage sheet,
these precautions may not be
sufficient to prevent distortion,
and an alternate procedure, such as
abrading or mechanical cleaning,
must be used to remove corrosion or
roughen the surface.  Aluminum
surfaces shall be abrasive blasted
with fine abrasive conforming to
the requirements in 3.1.1 to remove
corrosion and old coatings or
roughen new surfaces.  The blasted
surface shall be free of all
corrosion and foreign matter and
have a uniform, slightly roughened
appearance.

Aluminum shall be prepared by
degreasing and abrasive blasting or
mechanical cleaning, as required by
the condition and configuration of
the surface.  Abrasive blasting
shall be used whenever possible
using abrasives specified in 3.1.1.
Mechanical cleaning shall be used
only when abrasive blasting is
impractical, would damage the
structure or component, or is
prohibited in the area of work.
Aluminum shall be mechanically
cleaned in accordance with SSPC SP-
3 using abrasive discs/sheets, or
other approved methods.  All
corrosion and foreign matter shall
be completely removed and the
entire surface slightly roughened.
Anodized or chemical conversion
coated aluminum surfaces shall not
be mechanically cleaned.

Abrasive blasting of bellows,
gimbal joints, and other thin-
walled, abrasion-sensitive
components shall be blasted with
walnut shells or approved equiva
lent in accordance with 3.1.1.

3.5.2.2  Protective Coatings. - The
following protective coatings shall
be applied to aluminum surfaces as
required for each zone of exposure
described in 1.1.

        a. Zones 1, 2, and 3. - A
        nitrile-rubber-base,
        aluminum-pigmented coating
        conforming to 3.1.2.7
        shall be applied.  Coating
        shall have a DFT of 65
        micrometers (2.5 mils)
        minimum to 100 micrometers
        (4 mils) maximum.  To
        facilitate washdown of SRB
        residue on critical
        hardware, polymide epoxy
        coating and aliphatic
        polyurethane topcoat may
        be used as an alternate.

        b. Zones 4 and 5. - No
        protective coatings are
        required except for color
        coding, safety,
        identification, or special
        conditions for normal
        atmospheric service of
        1000, 5000, and 6000
        series alloys.  However,
        aluminum that is located
        within 3.5 kilometers (2
        miles) of the coastline or
        other series alloys shall
        be fully coated according
        to 3.5.2.2.a.  As an
        alternate to 3.5.2.2.a,
        aluminum may be degreased,
        wash primed with DOD-P-
        15328 to a DFT of 10 to 15
        micrometers (0.4 to 0.6
        mil), or conversion coated
        in accordance with MIL-C-
        5541, Class 1A, to meet
        electrical ground support
        equipment (GSE)
        requirements of KSC-E-165.
        Finish coats of epoxy
        primer to a DFT of 50 to
        75 micrometers (2 to 3
        mils) and topcoat of
        polyurethane, or
        equivalent, to a DFT of 40
        to 75 micrometers (1.5 to
        3.0 mils) shall be
        applied, as a minimum, to
        external surfaces where
        conversion coating is
        employed, such as racks
        and panels.

            NOTE

Aluminum requires special coatings
if immersion conditions could
occur.  See 3.5.4 for coatings for
immersion.

3.5.3  Protection of Stainless
Steel.

              CAUTION

          Some stainless
          steel
          configurations
          are susceptible
          to distortion
          and/or
          destruction
          when they are
          abrasive
          blasted.
          Special care
          shall be taken
          to ensure
          against any
          metal damage by
          choice of
          abrasive
          aggregate and
          by reducing
          blast nozzle
          pressure and
          increasing the
          working
          distance from
          nozzle to
          surface as
          necessary.  In
          some cases,
          such as in the
          surface
          preparation of
          light-gage
          sheet, these
          precautions may
          not be
          sufficient to
          prevent
          distortion, and
          an alternate
          procedure, such
          as abrading or
          mechanical
          cleaning, must
          be used to
          remove
          corrosion or
          roughen the
          surface.
          Stainless steel
          surfaces shall
          be abrasive
          blasted with
          fine abrasive
          conforming to
          the
          requirements in
          3.1.1 to remove
          corrosion and
          old coatings or
          roughen new
          surfaces.  The
          blasted surface
          shall be free
          of all
          corrosion and
          foreign matter
          and have a
          uniform,
          slightly
          roughened
          appearance.

3.5.3.1  Surface Preparation of
Stainless Steel. - Stainless steel
shall be prepared by degreasing in
accordance with SSPC SP-1 and
mechanical cleaning or abrasive
blasting.  Abrasive blasting shall
be used whenever possible.  Using

        shall have a DFT of 65
        micrometers (2.5 mils)
        minimum to 100 micrometers
        (4 mils) maximum.  To
        facilitate washdown of SRB
        residue on critical
        hardware, polyamide epoxy
        coating and aliphatic
        polyurethane topcoat may
        be used as an alternate.

        b. Zones 4 and 5. - No
        protective coatings are
        normally required for
        normal atmospheric service
        except for color coding,
        safety, identification, or
        special conditions.  As an
        alternative for special
        conditions, stainless
        steel may be brush blasted
        and coated with inhibitive
        epoxy primer to a DFT of
        50 to 75 micrometers (2 to

   specifications.  The assigned
  inspector shall be certificated
 under the National Association of
    Corrosion Engineers (NACE)
  International Coating Inspector
Training and Certification Program
  (NICITCP).  The inspector shall
  witness, inspect, and test all
 protective coating work to verify
   complete compliance with the
   specified requirements.  The
 assigned inspector shall document
 the work on the inspection forms
   described in 4.4.  The daily
    inspection reports shall be
   prepared and signed daily and
   submitted to the Contracting
  Officer on a weekly basis as a
  minimum.  When a nonconformance
  report is required, it shall be
    signed and submitted to the
   Contracting Officer within 1
 working day from the time that it
is written.  After determining that
   all nonconformances have been
 corrected and/or the coating work
is in compliance with this standard
 and the project specifications, a
  conformance verification report
shall be completed for the specific
   item, area, or project.  This
 report shall be signed and sealed
  by the assigned inspector.  The
  application of the certificated
      inspector's seal to the
  verification conformance report
 indicates that he has personally
 inspected the indicated work and
 has found it to be in compliance
 with the specified requirements.
 The seal shall not be affixed to

    needle of the gage shall be
inserted as close to the nozzle as
  practically possible and in the
    direction of the air flow.
 Pressure readings should be taken
    with the blasting system in
  complete operation.  The nozzle
 pressure shall be recorded.  The
 nozzle shall be checked initially
and then at a frequency determined
by the NACE inspector with a blast
 nozzle orifice gage to ensure the
 compressor output correlates with
         the nozzle size.
                 
     4.6.3  Degree of Surface
    Cleanliness. - The surface
  cleanliness shall be inspected
  after the completion of surface
preparation procedures and prior to
  primer application to determine
  compliance with the applicable
requirements of 3.5.  The degree of
  cleanliness of abrasive blasted
