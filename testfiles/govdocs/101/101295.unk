              I.  INTRODUCTION AND EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

     1.   On January 17, 1997, the Commission released a Memorandum Opinion and Order that
modified the interim rules for the filing and processing of applications and amendments for fixed point-to-point
microwave services in the 38.6-40.0 GHz (39 GHz) band.  Two petitions for reconsideration of this action were
filed.  On November 3, 1997, the Commission released a Report and Order and Second Notice of Proposed
Rule Making which amended Parts 1, 2, and 101 of our rules by revising the licensing and technical rules for the
fixed point-to-point microwave service in the 39 GHz band, and dismissed certain 39 GHz applications and
amendments thereto that had been held in abeyance pending the outcome of this rulemaking proceeding.  We
have received twelve petitions for reconsideration of the Report and Order and Second NPRM concerning the
channelization plan, performance requirements, and licensing  rules, along with the disposition of pending 39 GHz applications.  The instant Memorandum Opinion and Order
addresses the pleadings filed concerning these two Commission items.  Generally, we revisit the 39 GHz band
service areas, channelization plan, performance requirements, licensing rules and disposition of pending
applications, and affirm application of the standard method for calculating unjust enrichment payments on a pro
rata basis.  We also dismiss as moot an Emergency Request for Stay filed in connection with one of the petitions
for reconsideration.

     2.   The significant decisions in the instant Memorandum Opinion and Order are as follows:

         We affirm our decision to dismiss, without prejudice, all pending mutually exclusive 39 GHz
          applications where mutual exclusivity was not resolved by December 15, 1995, and all major
          modification applications and amendments thereto filed on or after November 13, 1995, and all
          amendments to resolve mutual exclusivity filed on or after December 15, 1995.

         We will process all 39 GHz applications that were not mutually exclusive with previously filed
          applications as of December 15, 1995, that conform in all aspects to our rules and all associated
          amendments of right filed before December 15, 1995, where such applications have satisfied
          the 30-day public notice requirement, even if they have not been subject to the full 60-day
          window during which competing mutually exclusive applications may be filed. 

         We affirm our decision to dismiss, without prejudice, all 39 GHz applications that did not meet
          the 30-day public notice requirement as of November 13, 1995.

         On our own motion, we reconsider the service area definitions for the 39 GHz band and decide
          to license all channel blocks in the 39 GHz band using Economic Areas (EAs).                                                                          

                   We retain the channelization plan set forth in the Report and Order and Second NPRM.           Consistent with the new Part 1 rules governing applications for license renewal provided in 47
          C.F.R.  1.949, 39 GHz licensees seeking renewal of station authorizations must file 
          applications no later than the expiration date of the authorization for which renewal is sought,
          and no sooner than 90 days prior to the date of license expiration.

         Consistent with the Part 1 competitive bidding provision contained in 47 C.F.R.  1.2111(e),
          unjust enrichment payments for 39 GHz licensees that obtain a bidding credit at auction, and
          subsequently partition or disaggregate to an entity that would not have qualified for such a
          credit, will be calculated on a pro rata basis, using population to determine the relative value
          of the partitioned area, the amount of spectrum disaggregated to determine the relative value of
          the disaggregated spectrum, and some combination thereof for combined partitioning and
          disaggregation. 

                        II.  BACKGROUND

     3.   On September 9, 1994, the Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) filed a Petition for
Rulemaking proposing a modification of the rules governing the 39 GHz band in order to increase the variety of
possible uses on the band.  On November 13, 1995, the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau (Bureau) issued
a Freeze Order, which froze acceptance of new 39 GHz applications.  On December 15, 1995, the Commission
issued a Notice of Proposed Rule Making and Order, whereby it proposed to amend the rules for fixed, point-to-point microwave service in the 39 GHz band, and to adopt a conforming set of new rules for the virtually unused
37 GHz band in order to allow for the expansion of 39 GHz-type service.  The NPRM and Order expanded upon
the Freeze Order primarily by distinguishing between those pending 39 GHz applications that would be
processed and those that would be held in abeyance pending the outcome of the rulemaking proceeding.  It also
stated that amendments to pending 39 GHz applications, and certain modification applications and modification
amendments, filed on or after November 13, 1995, would be held in abeyance during the pendency of the instant
proceeding.    

     4.   On January 17, 1997, the Commission released a Memorandum Opinion and Order which lifted
the processing freeze on amendments of right filed on or after November 13, 1995, but before December 15,
1995.  This action authorized the processing of applications for licensing new 39 GHz frequency assignments
that had completed the 60-day public notice period before November 13, 1995, and had been amended to resolve
mutual exclusivity on or after that date, but before December 15, 1995.  The Jan. 17 MO&O also clarified that
applications to modify existing 39 GHz licenses and amendments thereto would be processed regardless of when
filed, provided they neither enlarge the service area nor change the assigned frequency blocks, except to delete
them.  The rest of the freeze was left in place. 
                                                   
     5.   On November 3, 1997, the Commission released the Report and Order and Second NPRM,
which amended Parts 1, 2 and 101 of our rules to facilitate more effective use of the 39 GHz band, by
implementing a number of improvements, such as licensing by Basic Trading Areas (BTAs) and employing
competitive bidding procedures as a means for choosing among mutually exclusive license applications.  We
concluded that our regulatory framework should be expanded to include service rules for mobile operations in
the 39 GHz band, and addressed the status of those 39 GHz applications held in abeyance pursuant to the
processing freeze imposed in the NPRM and Order, as modified in the Jan. 17 MO&O.  In the Second NPRM,
we sought comment on:  (a) the types of unjust enrichment requirements that should be placed on 39 GHz
licensees receiving bidding credits as a condition for approval of partitioning and disaggregation arrangements;
and (b) the method of calculating unjust enrichment payments for 39 GHz licensees that are awarded bidding
credits and subsequently partition or disaggregate to a larger business or a business not entitled to the same level
of bidding credits. 

     6.   On April 8, 1998, DCT filed an Emergency Request for Stay of our decision to dismiss and
return all 39 GHz applications that remained mutually exclusive as of December 15, 1995, and those applications
that had not passed the 60-day cut-off period as of November 13, 1995, pending final determination of all
challenges to the subject applications.

                         III.  DISCUSSION

     A.   RESOLUTION OF THE OUTSTANDING 39 GHZ APPLICATION MATTERS

          1.   Reconsideration of the Commission's January 17, 1997 Memorandum Opinion
               and Order

     7.   Two parties, ELAR and BizTel, seek reconsideration of the interim filing and processing
freeze, which was modified pursuant to the Jan. 17 MO&O.  This is the second time that reconsideration of
the interim filing and processing freeze has been requested.  Section 1.429(i) of the Commission's Rules states: 

     Any order disposing of a petition for reconsideration which modifies rules adopted
     by the original order is, to the extent of such modification, subject to
     reconsideration in the same manner as the original order.  Except in such
     circumstance, a second petition for reconsideration may be dismissed by the staff
     as repetitious.

Thus, we will reconsider the Jan. 17 MO&O only to the extent that it modifies the NPRM and Order.

     8.   ELAR MO&O Petition.  ELAR asks us to lift the processing freeze on applications that were
amended on or after December 15, 1995, based on four arguments:  (1) because amendments of right are effective
upon filing, the NPRM and Order and MO&O cannot prevent amendments submitted on or after December 15,
1995, from taking effect; (2) the NPRM and Order was a retroactive rulemaking; (3) the MO&O's distinction
between applications amended of right before December 15, 1995, and those sought to be amended on or after
that date was arbitrary and capricious; and (4) the NPRM and Order was not effective until notice of it was
published in the Federal Register, or the Commission's Daily Digest, or at least until it was available to the public,
and any amendment of right submitted before such notice must be accepted for filing and processed.       9.   As noted above, the NPRM and Order itself is no longer subject to reconsideration, so
arguments that the freeze as a whole is invalid, and arguments going to aspects of the freeze that the Jan. 17
MO&O left unchanged, may no longer be raised, regardless of whether they were raised earlier.  We find that
the argument that the NPRM and Order was a retroactive rulemaking addresses the NPRM and Order rather than
the Jan. 17 MO&O, and therefore is repetitious and untimely.  The rule against repetitive reconsideration petitions
"bring[s] finality to our decision making process and eliminate[s] uncertainty," and may be waived only when
"the arguments that petitioners proffer in support of their requests [are] so compelling that they warrant departure
from this policy."  The argument that the NPRM and Order was a retroactive rulemaking is not sufficiently
compelling, and in fact was considered and rejected in the Jan. 17 MO&O. 

     10.  Our review of ELAR's petition is limited, therefore, to arguments challenging the modifications
to the freeze adopted in the Jan. 17 MO&O, or questioning the scope of these modifications, i.e., issues pertaining
to which amendments of right and which modifications should be accepted for filing and/or processed.  Three of
ELAR's arguments are reviewable under that standard.  None of these, however, provides a basis for altering the
policies adopted in the Jan. 17 MO&O.  First, the argument that the modifications to the freeze adopted in the
NPRM and Order and the Jan. 17 MO&O cannot prevent amendments of right submitted on or after December
15, 1995, from taking effect overlooks the difference between filed amendments and amendments tendered but
not filed due to the freeze.  As the Commission has previously stated, the fact that amendments of right are
effective upon filing does not mean that all proffered amendments of right must be accepted for filing, or that
amendments not accepted for filing are effective upon submittal. 

     11.  Second, ELAR's argument that processing amendments of right filed before the expanded Freeze
Order portion of the NPRM and Order took effect, while refusing to accept such amendments submitted
thereafter, is arbitrary and capricious similarly misreads the Jan. 17 MO&O.  The Jan. 17 MO&O concluded that
amendments of right resolving mutual exclusivity that were filed after the initial Freeze Order was released and
before the modifications to the freeze adopted in the NPRM and Order was released should be processed, rather
than held in abeyance as provided in the NPRM and Order.  The Commission reasoned in the Jan. 17 MO&O
that, because those amendments took effect upon filing (i.e., were not subject to the freeze), the amended
applications were not "materially different" from pending applications that were not mutually exclusive as of
November 13, 1995, which the Commission continued to process.  ELAR contends that if there is no material
difference between an application that was not mutually exclusive as of November 13 and one that was amended
between November 13 and December 15 to resolve mutual exclusivity, then there is no material difference
between an application that was amended between November 13 and December 15 to resolve mutual exclusivity
and an application sought to be so amended on or after December 15.  We disagree.  The material difference
between these two situations, however, is that the latter amendment would have been unacceptable for filing
because of the freeze as modified by the NPRM and Order.  Thus, this argument fails because it disregards the
difference between an amendment that is filed and one that is submitted but not accepted for filing.  Moreover,
in reaching its decision regarding the ability of parties to amend their pending applications after December 15,
1995, the Commission noted that the applicants had ample opportunity to file amendments prior to the
commencement of this rule making and that applicants would have a reasonable avenue of relief under the rules
and procedures adopted in the Report and Order.

     12.  Third, ELAR argues that any "amendment of right" submitted before the NPRM and Order
became effective must be processed.  As previously noted, the Jan. 17 MO&O agreed with this argument, and
those applications filed between Nov. 13 and Dec. 15 and determined to be "ripe" were to be processed.  ELAR
further argues that the NPRM and Order was not effective until notice of it was published in the Federal Register
or the Commission's Daily Digest, or at least until it was available to the public.  The NPRM and Order
provided that amendments to pending 39 GHz applications filed on or after December 15, 1995, would "not be
accepted for filing."  It is well settled that an application freeze is the type of procedural action that may be
adopted without notice and comment under the Administrative Procedure Act.  We conclude, therefore, that the
Freeze Order portion of the NPRM and Order was effective on December 15, 1995, when it was released.  While
ELAR contends that the NPRM and Order was not in fact available to the press and public on December 15,
1995, our rules make no provision for deeming a date other than the one "on the face of the document" to be
its release date.  Even if the presumption that the document correctly reflects the release date is rebuttable,
ELAR's unsubstantiated allegation that the document was not available until the following day does not suffice.

     13.  ELAR also contends that it was exempted from the NPRM and Order's freeze on filing
amendments until ELAR, itself, had actual notice thereof, because Section 0.445(e) of our Rules states, "No
person is expected to comply with any requirement or policy of the Commission unless he has actual notice of
that requirement or policy or a document stating it has been published."  The NPRM and Order did not require
ELAR and the other parties with pending applications to "comply" with anything, for it required no action on their
part.  Thus, we find that Section 0.445(e) offers ELAR no basis for relief.  We therefore deny ELAR's petition.

     14.  BizTel MO&O Petition.  BizTel filed a Petition for Reconsideration asking us to process all
pending applications that are not mutually exclusive and to allow the filing of amendments of right at least until
this rulemaking proceeding is terminated.  BizTel's first two arguments, that the freeze violates portions of
Section 309(j) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the "Act"), and that pending applications
that were not mutually exclusive as of November 13, 1995, should be processed because they cannot become
mutually exclusive, address the NPRM and Order rather than the Jan. 17 MO&O. For the reasons outlined
above with respect to ELAR's MO&O Petition, we dismiss these arguments as repetitious and untimely.

     15.  BizTel next argues that we must continue to accept amendments of right for three reasons.  First,
BizTel argues that Section 309(j)(6)(E) of the Communications Act requires us to resolve mutual exclusivity
among pending applications.  This argument, however, was previously held to be premature in the Jan. 17
MO&O.    That decision was correct and there are no grounds to reverse it here.  We do note, however, the issue
was addressed in the Report and Order and Second NPRM, and was raised in petitions seeking reconsideration,
which are discussed below.  Second, BizTel argues that the right to amend cannot be revoked without notice
and comment.   This argument fails as well, because, as noted previously, a freeze is a procedural matter and
thus may be initiated without prior notice and comment.  Third, BizTel argues that the freeze on filing
amendments of right is arbitrary and capricious because it serves no purpose.  This argument ignores the
justifications for the freeze discussed in the NPRM and Order and Jan. 17 MO&O.  As we have previously
stated, accepting and processing such amendments would burden Commission resources and could lead to results
inconsistent with our intent in this proceeding to update the regulatory structure of the 39 GHz band in light of
contemporary market conditions.  BizTel's view of the best way to proceed understandably is influenced by its
desire to obtain the licenses for which it has applied.  We must, however, consider the interests not only of
pending applicants, but also of future applicants, consumers, and others.  We thus adhere to the balance struck
in the Jan. 17 MO&O.

     16.  Finally, BizTel asserts that the Jan. 17 MO&O "mischaracterizes and fails to adequately
consider BizTel's legal challenge to the unlawful policies adopted in the [NPRM and Order]."  It specifies two
arguments that it claims were raised earlier but not addressed.  One is that the freeze violates Section 309(j)(7)
of the Act, which prohibits the basing of a finding of the public interest, convenience and necessity on the
expectation of Federal revenues from the use of a system of competitive bidding.  Our review of the record
reveals nothing on this topic in BizTel's comments that we did not address in the Jan. 17 MO&O, and therefore
we dismiss this argument as untimely.

     17.  The other argument that BizTel says was raised but not addressed in the  Jan. 17 MO&O is that
McElroy Electronics Corp. v. FCC compels the processing of all pending, non-mutually exclusive applications,
whenever they were filed.  At issue in McElroy was whether the public notice announcing the appellant's
application commenced a cut-off period for mutually exclusive applications pursuant to Section 22.131(b) of our
rules.  The Commission concluded that it had not (because the notice did not state that the application had been
"accepted for filing," and the Commission had not specifically established a filing window), so the Commission
established a one-day filing window for that market.  On appeal, the D.C. Circuit held that the notice did
commence the cut-off period, and ordered the applications received during the one-day filing window dismissed. 
BizTel cites McElroy for the proposition that a filing cut-off can be established even if we do not explicitly set
out the cut-off date.  According to Biztel, under Kessler, a freeze order forever forecloses the subsequent filing
of applications that are mutually exclusive to pending applications.  Therefore, BizTel asserts that the
Commission, in the Freeze Order portion of the NPRM and Order should have treated applications pending as
of November 13, 1995, that were not mutually exclusive, yet had not completed the public notice period, the same
as pending applications that had completed the notice period, and should have ruled that these applications should
be processed rather than held in abeyance.  

     18.  We believe that we sufficiently considered and rejected this argument, in the Jan. 17 MO&O,
explaining that applications that were held in abeyance by the initial Freeze Order and the NPRM and Order's
modification of the initial Freeze Order were not permanently cut off from the filing of competing applications:

     [W]e have not yet completed the rulemaking process that is necessary to determine
     the very question of what final action will be taken with regard to the 39 GHz
     applications held in abeyance.  Until we complete our consideration of the record,
     we will not be in a position to state whether further applications may be filed, or
     how the applications presently held in abeyance will be treated.  In contrast, the
     procedural status of the "ripe" applications has already been determined -- under
     our current rules, competing applications may no longer be filed.  Thus, we have
     two distinct categories of "cut-off" applications:  those that have been temporarily
     cut-off from competition, subject to the results of our notice-and-comment
     rulemaking proceeding here, and those that were permanently "cut-off" from
     competition by operation of our rules.

We therefore reject Biztel's argument that McElroy compels processing of these applications, and deny Biztel's
petition.     2.   November 3, 1997 Report and Order Treatment of Pending 39 GHz Applications
     
          a.   Legality of License Processing Rules

     19.  Some parties claim that the new license processing policy adopted in the Report and Order and
Second NPRM violates certain sections of the Act.  On the contrary, as discussed below, we believe that the new
processing policy comports with the Act and controlling case law.

     20.  A few petitioners argue that the "sole operative purpose" of the our new processing rules is to
preserve spectrum in the "expectation of increased Federal Revenues" in violation of Section 309(j)(7)(A) of
the Act.  As stated above, the Commission has previously set forth clear public policy  reasons for 
implementing this licensing scheme,  and has thus rejected petitions for reconsideration concerning this issue. 
Accordingly, these petitioners' arguments are rejected.   

     21.  Some parties also claim that the new licensing regime prevents the grant of licenses to applicants
who contribute to the development of new telecommunications services and technology, in violation of Section
309(j)(6)(G) of the Act.  To the contrary, under our rules, eligibility to participate in the competitive bidding
process for 39 GHz licenses is not restricted.  In fact, the Commission has structured the auction to encourage
and promote participation by many different entities.  Additionally, we have found, after reviewing the record
in this proceeding, that implementing the new licensing regime will expand the pool of potential 39 GHz
applicants, which, in turn, will provide opportunities for new entities to develop new and innovative services in
this spectrum.
     b.   Disposition of Pending Mutually Exclusive 39 GHz Applications

     22.  Some parties assert that the new licensing regime violates applicant "processing rights."  They
assert that a window of time should be provided to resolve pending mutually exclusive 39 GHz applications, and
that those applications should be processed under the old rules.  One party also requested clarification of our
processing policy concerning pending "partially mutually exclusive" 39 GHz applications.  We disagree that
the new licensing policy violates processing rights.  The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 requires us, with limited
exceptions, to use competitive bidding to resolve mutually exclusive applications.  Our new processing policy
is pursuant to and consistent with that legislative mandate.

     23.  Section 309(j)(1) of the Communications Act requires the Commission, subject to certain
exceptions not pertinent to this proceeding, to use competitive bidding to resolve mutually exclusive  applications
for all categories of spectrum licenses.  Additionally, Section 309(j)(6)(E) of the  Communications Act states
that, in determining the auctionability of applications, the Commission has the "obligation in the public interest
to continue to use engineering solutions, negotiation, threshold qualifications, service regulations, and other
means to avoid mutual exclusivity in application and licensing proceedings."    

     24.  As we stated in our recent decision resolving petitions for reconsideration of our adoption of a
geographic area licensing approach for paging services, the Commission has previously construed Section
309(j)(6)(E)  to mean  that  it  has  an obligation  to attempt to avoid mutual exclusivity by the  methods prescribed therein only when it would further the public interest goals of Section 309(j)(3).  In the
Paging MO&O, we determined that the public interest would be better served by licensing all remaining paging
spectrum through a geographic licensing scheme rather than processing additional site-specific licenses.  We
reasoned that geographic area licensing "provides flexibility for licensees and ease of administration for the
Commission, facilitates build-out of wide-area systems, and enables paging operators to act quickly to meet the
needs of their customers.  We also determined that it would "not be in the public interest to implement other
licensing schemes or other processes that avoid mutual exclusivity, thus fulfilling the Commission's obligation
under Section 309(j)(6)(E)."  Moreover, we explained that "we have concluded in other proceedings that the
Balanced Budget Act's revision of our auction authority does not require us to re-examine determinations
regarding the use of geographic licensing and competitive bidding that were made under the auction authority
provided by the 1993 Budget Act."  Thus, in the Paging MO&O we affirmed our previous decision to dismiss
all pending applications.  

     25.  We believe that the same type of analysis supports the Commission's decisions in this
proceeding to adopt a geographic licensing approach and dismiss pending mutually exclusive 39 GHz
applications.  In the Report and Order and Second NPRM, the Commission addressed Section 309(j)(3) public
interest goals vis a vis the Section 309(j)(6)(E) obligations and determined that the proposed change in the 39
GHz licensing scheme comports with those objectives and obligations.  At that time, the Commission
considered comments from those who contended that because the then-current point-to-point rules were structured
to avoid mutual exclusivity through frequency coordination, changing the rules to license by larger service areas
would encourage mutual exclusivity.  In rejecting that argument, the Commission stated that, due to the
significantly increased requests for large service areas and multiple channels in the 39 GHz band, frequency
coordination techniques that were suitable for a lower level of 39 GHz spectrum demand were no longer
adequate.  The Commission asserted that auctioning licenses for pre-defined, larger service areas would serve
the public interest by providing for a more orderly structure for the licensing process; and, by placing 39 GHz
licenses in the hands of those who value them the most, encourage the creation and deployment of new services,
which would foster efficient and expeditious use of the 39 GHz spectrum.  It further stated that continued use
of applicant-defined service areas would actually slow service to the public because the processing of each
application requires extensive analysis and review by Commission staff.  The Commission also noted that,
because we had previously sought comments concerning the auctionability of the 39 GHz band in the NPRM and
Order, and because the Bureau regularly releases public notices announcing time frames for upcoming
auctions, we satisfied the requirements that notice and comment be permitted prior to issuing bidding rules, and
that interested parties have time to develop business plans, assess market conditions, and determine the
availability of suitable equipment, after the issuance of bidding rules.  As a result, consistent with our decision
in the Paging MO&O, we conclude that the Commission  effectively determined that it would not be in the public
interest to implement other licensing schemes or other processes that avoid mutual exclusivity, and thereby
fulfilled the Commission's obligation under Section 309(j)(6)(E).

     26.  Additionally, we decline to resolve pending mutually exclusive 39 GHz applications under the
prior rules.  Because the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 terminated the Commission's authority to use random
selection for the issuance of licenses for most communications services, the only method for resolving mutually
exclusive applications in the 39 GHz band under the old rules would be through comparative hearings.  The
comparative hearing process involves a trial-type proceeding before an Administrative Law Judge, which can
prove burdensome to the parties and a strain our limited resources.  In the past, those burdens have proven
manageable in processing applications for single point-to-point links.  Such applications were very easy to
coordinate and have resulted in few, if any, instances of mutual exclusivity.  The rare case that could not be
coordinated to avoid interference would be appropriate for comparative hearing.  Now, however, applicants seek
to serve geographic areas rather than single point-to-point links.  This results in significant conflicts among
entities seeking to acquire spectrum.

     27.  Accordingly, we uphold our finding that comparative hearings would be slower and more costly,
both to the government and applicants, than competitive bidding, and that comparative hearings are not in the
public interest where, as here, large numbers of applications and large protected service areas are involved. 
Thus, for pending mutually exclusive applications in the 39 GHz band, we conclude that competitive bidding
serves the public interest and is the best method for choosing among mutually exclusive applicants.  We also
uphold our finding that those who believe that they should be afforded the opportunity to amend their applications
to avoid mutual exclusivity had ample opportunity to file such amendments prior to the commencement of this
rulemaking, and further delay would not be in the public  interest.  Accordingly, we will not grant a window
of time for pending 39 GHz applicants to resolve mutually exclusive applications.

     28.  We also affirm our decision regarding the partially mutually exclusive applications, i.e., to
process the non-mutually exclusive portion of them, while dismissing the remainder of those applications that
cannot be granted due to mutual exclusivity.  CMC argues that, by taking that action, the Commission changed
the course of the instant proceeding.  CMC further argues that we should provide a reason for distinguishing
partially mutually exclusive applications from other mutually exclusive applications.  The Report and Order
and Second NPRM previously explained that the frequency pairs in those applications were categorized as either
mutually exclusive or non-mutually exclusive, pursuant to our findings in the instant rulemaking.  Based on
the record, the Commission reasonably determined that the best course of action was to grant the uncontested
frequency pairs requested in the partially mutually exclusive applications, while dismissing the applications with
respect to contested frequency pairs.  This decision parallels the Commission's approach regarding non-mutually exclusive applications, which were processed, and mutually exclusive applications, which were
dismissed.  Consequently, our decision concerning the partially mutually exclusive applications did not "change
the course" of the instant rulemaking, and we reject CMC's argument to the contrary.

     c.   Disposition of Amendments to Pending 39 GHz Applications

     29.  In the Report and Order and Second NPRM, we stated that, in order to further the goals of the
instant rulemaking -- e.g., updating the regulatory structure for the 39 GHz band -- amendments to pending 39
GHz applications intended to avoid mutual exclusivity, filed on or after December 15, 1995, would be
dismissed.   A few parties argue that by dismissing those amendments, we revoked their "substantive" right
to amend, and that all such amendments to 39 GHz applications filed on or after December 15, 1995 should be
processed. Some parties also argue that our decision to dismiss those amendments violates Section 309(j)(6)(E)
of the Act.

     30.  It is well established that when an entity has notice that we might change our rules and/or
procedures, the implementation of a new rule or procedure does not impair any substantive right upon which that
entity is entitled to rely.  After being put on notice of our proposed rule and policy changes by the NPRM and
Order, the parties, as of that date, had no "substantive" right to amend their applications.  The parties thus filed
such amendments at their own risk.

     31.  In the Jan. 17 MO&O, the Commission announced that we would process amendments to
pending 39 GHz applications, filed between the dates of the initial Freeze Order and the modification to the
freeze adopted in the NPRM and Order, that resolved mutual exclusivity and were otherwise in compliance with
our rules.  It stated that such amendments were "as of right and were effective when filed" because the initial
Freeze Order did not specify that those amendments were frozen.  It specifically interpreted the subsequent
modification of the freeze adopted NPRM and Order as a freezing of amendments and subsequently dismissed
all those amendments filed on or after December 15, 1995.  It also reasoned that permitting existing 39 GHz
applicants to amend their pending applications on or after December 15, 1995, would run contrary to the goals
of the instant rulemaking proceeding.  The Commission found, for example, that if existing applicants were
allowed to resolve conflicts outside of the competitive bidding process, other entities would be prevented from
applying for 39 GHz spectrum under the new rules.  It also found that the resulting limited pool of applicants
could "inhibit the development of new and innovative services in this spectrum." Accordingly, the Commission
determined that dismissal of the pending amendments would serve the public interest.

     32.  Commco argues that by dismissing amendments to pending 39 GHz applications filed on or after
December 15, 1995, the Commission "improperly amended" its finding in the NPRM and Order that such
amendments are "of right."  However, Commco's argument ignores the fact that the freeze portion of the NPRM
and Order provided notice that such amendments would no longer be accepted for processing.  Consequently,
although we found that amendments filed prior to the NPRM and Order should be processed "of right," any
former right to amend a pending 39 GHz application ended with the release of the NPRM and Order.

     33.  Commco further argues that Sections 101.29(a) and 101.45(f)(2) of the Commission's
Rules provide that an applicant may amend an application "as of right," and that the Commission violated those
rules when we dismissed amendments to 39 GHz applications filed on or after December 15, 1995.  For the
reasons set forth below, we disagree.

     34.  Section 101.29(a) generally states that pending applications that are not designated for the
random selection process may be amended "as a matter of right." It is well established that the mere filing of
an FCC application vests no rights in an applicant.  Moreover, as stated above, any right to amend a pending
39 GHz application ended with the release of the NPRM and Order.  We stated in the NPRM and Order that
amendments to pending applications would not be accepted for filing on or after  December 15, 1995.  In
addition, Section 101.45(f)(2) does not provide an applicant with a vested right  to amend its application.  Rather,
it provides an exception to the general rule that pending applications amended by major amendments are
considered "newly-filed" and lose their place in the processing line. 

     35.  Some parties argue that by dismissing amendments to pending 39 GHz applications intended
to resolve mutual exclusivity filed on or after December 15, 1995, the Commission violated Section 309(j)(6)(E)
of the Communications Act.  Contrary to those assertions, by dismissing the subject amendments and unripe
applications, we did not violate our statutory mandate to "continue to use engineering solutions, negotiation,
threshold qualifications, service regulations, and other means in order to avoid mutual exclusivity in application
and licensing proceedings."  The Commission conducted the instant proceeding in response to a petition for
rulemaking where it considered implementing new technical standards for the 39 GHz band, which would require
new licensing procedures.  It froze new applications for 39 GHz licenses because of its concern that
applications filed under the former rules may  not conform to the technical and service requirements being
considered.  For the same reason, it froze  certain amendments to pending 39 GHz applications, including those
at issue.  After a notice and comment period, as required by the APA, the Commission determined that
continuing to license the 39 GHz band under the former rules would run contrary to its proposed regulatory
overhaul and decided to implement competitive bidding for all future 39 GHz licensees.  Accordingly, it
dismissed "unripe" pending mutually exclusive 39 GHz applications and certain amendments thereto, including
amendments which were filed on and after December 15, 1995, to avoid mutual exclusivity with other pending
applications. 

     36.  As noted in the preceding paragraphs, we have carefully considered our obligations under
Section 309(j)(6)(E) in making our decision to uphold the dismissal of "unripe" pending mutually exclusive 39
GHz applications and amendments.  We have also determined, after considering our Section 309(j)(6)(E)
obligations, to process those 39 GHz applications that passed the 30-day public notice period as of the release
date of the Freeze Order, November 13, 1995, and all associated amendments of right filed before the release
date of the Notice of Proposed Rule Making and Order, December 15, 1995.  Further, we will grant those
pending applications that are not mutually exclusive with previously-filed applications.   

     37.  It has been established by case law that Section 309(j)(6)(E) does not require us to adhere to an
outmoded licensing policy in order to avoid mutual exclusivity.  Section 309(j)(6)(E) merely requires that we
take certain measures to avoid mutual exclusivity "within the framework of existing policies."  The
Commission's decision to adopt competitive bidding procedures for assignment of 39 GHz licenses arose from
the changes it made to the service and licensing rules for the 39 GHz band, which were found, pursuant to notice
and comment, to serve the public interest.  Thus, we conclude that Section 309(j)(6)(E) does not require us to
process the petitioners' amendments, because they were submitted under a regulatory regime that is no longer in
effect.  Accordingly, we affirm our decision to dismiss all amendments, filed on or after December 15, 1995,
including those intended to resolve mutual exclusivity among pending 39 GHz applications.

     38.  Similarly, we do not believe that Section 309(j)(6)(E) requires us to process unripe pending
mutually exclusive applications, nor are we required to foster settlement agreements among applicants who
submitted applications under the former processing rules and policies.  Bachow claims that it reduced its channel
requests in compliance with the Commission's September 16, 1994, Public Notice,  which contained a policy
statement that, inter alia, imposed a spectrum cap on applicants for certain 39 GHz services.  Bachow states
that it was unable to reach agreements to resolve mutually exclusive situations with non-complying applicants
before the unripe pending applications were dismissed.  Bachow argues that the Commission should insist that
all pending applications conform to the Public Notice before dismissing unripe pending application.  We
disagree. The Public Notice was issued pursuant to the former regulatory regime, and the fact that some pending
applications may have been subject to dismissal due to nonconformance with the Public Notice is inapposite.  
 
          d.   Disposition of 39 GHz Applications Meeting the Public Notice Requirement as of
               November 13, 1995

     39.  In the NPRM and Order, the Commission expanded upon the Freeze Order by stating that 39
GHz applications would be processed if they were not mutually exclusive with other 39 GHz applications at the
time of the Freeze Order, and if the 60-day period for filing mutually exclusive applications expired prior to
November 13, 1995.  Some parties argue that a 30-day cut-off period -- not a 60-day cut-off period -- is the
correct requirement for processing eligibility.  Section 309(b) of the Communications Act and Section
101.37(c) of the Commission's Rules (former Section 21.27(c)) state that we may process an application no
earlier than 30 days after it has been placed on public notice.  Section 101.45(b)(2) (former Section 21.31(b))
allows competing applications to be filed up to 60 days after the date of the public notice listing the first of the
conflicting applications as accepted for filing.  Subparts (i) and (ii) explain that the cut-off date is the earlier
of two dates:
 
      (i) Sixty (60) days after the date of the public notice listing the first of the
     conflicting applications as accepted for filing; or (ii) One (1) business day
     preceding the day on which the Commission takes final action on the previously
     filed application (should the  Commission act upon such application in the interval
     between thirty (30) and sixty (60) days after the date of its public notice).

     40.  We have determined, after further consideration, that those 39 GHz applications that met the
30-day public notice requirement, but not the 60-day period for which mutually exclusive applications may be
filed, are not materially different than those applications for which the 60-day period for filing mutually exclusive
applications has passed.  Specifically, we find that those 39 GHz applications that meet the 30-day public notice
requirement are ripe for processing, in accordance with our rules.  It is our practice to process applications as soon
after the close of the 30-day public notice period as possible.  Even though the mounting number of 39 GHz
applications created complexities that generally forestalled our processing of those applications until after the
60-day period for filing mutually exclusive applications had passed, we find that those applications became ripe
for processing on day 31.  Therefore, we will process those 39 GHz applications that passed the 30-day public
notice period as of November 13, 1995 and all associated amendments of right filed before December 15, 1995,
and grant those applications that are not mutually exclusive with previously-filed applications.  We find this
action to be in the public interest because it best comports with the plain reading of our rules, and promotes
regulatory certainty and consistency.

          e.   Disposition of 39 GHz Applications not Meeting the Public Notice Requirement
               as of November 13, 1995

     41.  Some petitioners also argue, based on McElroy and Kessler, that the Freeze Order announcing
that the Commission would no longer accept for filing any applications for new 39 GHz licenses filed on or after
November 13, 1995, constitutes an "accelerated cut-off" period requiring us to process all 39 GHz applications
on file as of that date.  As an initial matter, we note that the Commission did not cut-off the processing of
eligible, ripe applications, rather it froze application processing in preparation for a rulemaking proceeding, and
later dismissed applications not comporting with our Rules as unacceptable for filing.  Further, petitioners
misconstrue McElroy and Kessler.  At issue in McElroy, was whether certain public notices prevented the 60-day
cut-off period for filing of competing applications from commencing because they failed to adequately notify
competing applicants by including the phrase "accepted for filing."  The Court found that the public notices
gave adequate notice and did not prevent the 60-day cut-off period from commencing.

     42.  Petitioners also cite Kessler as a basis for their claim that the Freeze Order imposes an
accelerated cut-off date.  However, in Kessler, the pertinent issue was whether it was arbitrary and capricious
for the Commission to fail to give advance notice of a freeze, and the Court held that it was  not.   Moreover,
the application freeze imposed in Kessler is distinguishable from the 39 GHz application freeze.  In the
underlying proceeding in Kessler, the Commission decided that it was in the public interest to process pending
applications for the following reason:  

     [T]he total number of potential grants that could result from proposals on file . .
     . was not sufficiently great  to  frustrate the ends we sought to accomplish through
     our rulemaking.  We  decided, therefore, that we could continue to process those
     cases, without substantial sacrifice of our basic objectives.

The Commission then amended its procedural rules "to establish, in effect, a new 'cut-off' date for most pending
applications, this new date acting to supersede all previous cut-off lists."  This "exceptional treatment" was
proposed in an effort "to speed up the disposition of applications where a contest had ceased to exist."  In the
39 GHz proceeding -- unlike the underlying proceeding in Kessler -- the Commission found the large volume of
potential grants of licenses sufficiently great to frustrate the goals of the 39 GHz rulemaking. 

     43.  It is well settled that the Commission "is not bound to adhere to a procedure just because it was
once adopted."  If we find that it is in the public interest to hold in abeyance the acceptance of applications, we
may craft a freeze to fit the circumstances.  For example, in one proceeding, the Commission suspended
acceptance of all new paging applications in conjunction with a proposal to convert from site-by-site licensing
of paging channels to licensing on a geographic area basis, and subsequently modified the freeze to give
incumbent licensees with operating paging systems the opportunity to file primary site applications for sites that
incrementally expand their services areas.  Further, in the 220-222 MHz band proceeding, the Commission
imposed a freeze on the filing of initial and modification applications due to the volume of applications, and later
lifted the filing window for non-nationwide 220 MHz licensees who sought to obtain modification of their
authorizations to relocate base stations.  These are but two examples of how the Commission has crafted
procedural rules to fit the circumstances.

     44.  Moreover, applications that do not comport with the 30-day public notice requirement as of the
November 13, 1995 Freeze Order are, under our rules, unripe for processing.  As discussed above, Section
101.37(c) (former Section 21.27(c)) of the Commission's rules states that we may process an application no
earlier than 30 days after it has been placed on public notice.  Thus, those applications for which the 30-day
public notice period was not completed by the November 13, 1995 Freeze Order are permanently foreclosed from
becoming ripe for processing.  To find otherwise would defeat the purpose of the processing freeze.  In the Report
and Order and Second NPRM, the Commission found that because the 39 GHz band is subject to significantly
different rules than the ones used previously, the most fair and reasonable approach concerning pending unripe
39 GHz applications was to dismiss them, without prejudice, and allow those applicants to reapply under the new
rules.  We continue to believe that this approach adequately balances the expectations of applicants with the need
for a more efficient and effective system for licensing use of the 39 GHz band.  

          f.   Emergency Request for Stay

     45.  DCT filed an Emergency Request for Stay on April 8, 1998, requesting that we stay the decision
to dismiss those 39 GHz applications that were not resolved of their mutual exclusivity as of December 15, 1995,
and those 39 GHz applications that had not passed the 60-day cut-off period as of November 13, 1995, pending
final resolution of all challenges to the Commission's 39 GHz application dismissal policy.  Inasmuch as we have
carefully reviewed the substance of DCT's request, and in light of today's decision and the absence of prior
dismissal of the pending 39 GHz applications subject to this proceeding, we conclude DCT has in fact received
the relief it requested.  Moreover, there will be no further delay in implementing the dismissal or further
processing of the above-referenced applications because this Memorandum Opinion and Order resolves the issues
addressed in the petitions for reconsideration.  We therefore dismiss DCT's request for stay as moot.

     B.   SERVICE AREAS
          
     46.  In the NPRM and Order, we proposed to license all channel blocks in the 39 GHz band using
BTAs, and we solicited comments on that proposal.  Based on the record as it existed at the time  of the release
of the Report and Order and Second NPRM, we determined that BTAs were the most appropriate geographic
areas for the types of services envisioned for the 39 GHz band.  Explicit in this determination was the
Commission's expectation that 39 GHz licensees and Rand McNally would execute licensing agreements similar
to those in other services.  Subsequent to the release of the Report and Order and Second NPRM, new
developments concerning Rand McNally's copyright interest in BTAs lead us to conclude that using BTAs as
service areas for 39 GHz authorizations could result in extended delays in the 39 GHz licensing process.  Thus,
on our own motion, after reviewing the current record, we reconsider the service area definitions for the 39 GHz
band and will license all channel blocks in the 39 GHz band using Economic Areas (EAs).  We believe that
licensing the 39 GHz band by EAs will provide ample population coverage and allow licensees the flexibility to
provide many different types of services, which will promote an equitable distribution of licenses and services
among geographic areas, encourage economic opportunities among a wide variety of applicants, and foster
investment in and rapid deployment of new technologies and services.  In addition, by using EAs we will better
serve the public by avoiding the potential delays in the continued licensing of the 39 GHz band under the new
licensing approach established in this proceeding.  Accordingly, a total of 175 authorizations (172 EAs, and three
EA-like areas, covering Guam and Northern Mariana Islands; Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands; and
American Samoa) will be issued for each 39 GHz channel block.   

     C.   CHANNELIZATION PLAN
     
     47.  In the Report and Order and Second NPRM, we determined that the 39 GHz spectrum could
be used to offer a variety of terrestrial services.  TRW, Inc. (TRW) asks that we ensure that some of the global
spectrum allocation for fixed satellite services (FSS) on the 39 GHz band remain available for next-generation
satellite networks.  Specifically, TRW entreats us to limit our 39 GHz spectrum channelization plan for terrestrial
wireless services to those frequencies below 39.5 GHz in order to provide a segment of the spectrum above 39.5
GHz for FSS.  TRW requests that, at a minimum, we clarify that fixed and mobile service authorizations in
the 39 GHz band "will not confer exclusive spectrum rights, and that fixed and mobile licensees should be
required to coordinate with satellite operators to facilitate spectrum sharing to the extent feasible."  TRW also
suggests that a limitation on elevation angles of terrestrial transmitting equipment would "assist spectrum sharing
in the 39 GHz band." 

     48.  Several parties oppose the TRW Petition, and request that we affirm the current channelization
plan and decline to reserve the 39.5-40.0 GHz band for satellite operators.  Both ART and WinStar correctly
assert that we have already addressed the issue of reserving the 39.5-40.0 GHz band for satellite operators. 
In addition, several parties maintain that sharing between terrestrial and satellite services in this segment of the
39 GHz band is not feasible.  WinStar, for example, argues that interference concerns would freeze fixed
terrestrial services out of significant areas surrounding proposed satellite earth stations and that terrestrial
services would find it impossible to operate under the severe power density and automatic transmission power
control sought by satellite operators if TRW's proposal is adopted.  These parties, therefore, request that we
not revisit our earlier decision to maintain terrestrial primacy in the 39.5-40.0 GHz band.

     49.  We find that TRW has not provided a convincing basis for altering our rules for this band. 
Further, we affirm the conclusion that altering the service designation in the 39.5-40.0 GHz segment of the band
is not in the public interest.  As we stated in reaching our initial decision rejecting TRW's request, we believe that
it would be too burdensome to "repack" terrestrial users in a portion of the band below 39.5 GHz, because, among
other things, existing licensees could be required to purchase new equipment or change frequencies.  In
addition, we explained that a new terrestrial frequency plan would be required, based on a different
transmit/receiving separation, which would be costly to equipment manufacturers and licensees.  Furthermore,
due to the potential for interference between contemplated ubiquitous satellite and the in-place high density
operating terrestrial systems, altering the current allocation of the 39 GHz band, at the present time, would not
serve the public interest and would be inconsistent with the outstanding proposals in the March 24, 1997, Notice
of Proposed Rulemaking in IB Docket No. 97-95.  Thus, we conclude that it would not be practical to
implement TRW's request, and it is therefore denied.  However, we reiterate that our current allocation for the
39 GHz segment of the band contains both fixed and satellite services and, as noted in the Report and Order and
Second NPRM,  our action here does not constrain our ability to make modifications to the Table of Allocations
at a later  time.  Nor is our action here in any way intended to constrain wireless licensees' ability to deploy satellite earth
stations in the 39.5-40.0 GHz band.

     D.   PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS: RENEWAL AND BUILD-OUT

     50.  Prior to the Report and Order and Second NPRM, 39 GHz licensees were subject to the Part
101 build-out rules, which required station construction within 18 months of the date of license grant. 
Licensees authorized before August 1, 1996, received a five-year, fixed license term and licensees authorized
after August 1, 1996, received a ten-year, fixed license term.  Moreover, at that time, neither the Part 21 rules
nor the Part 101 rules directly provided for a renewal expectancy at the time of license expiration.  However, in
the Report and Order and Second NPRM, the Commission determined that, in order to promote flexibility in
system design and market development, it would combine the performance standards required at build-out with
the requirements for a renewal expectancy into one showing of substantial service at the time of license renewal,
in accordance with Section 101.17(a).  It  further determined, at that time, that the substantial service showing
be made 18 months prior to the license expiration date in accordance with Section 101.15(c).  

     51.  In pleadings responsive to the Report and Order and Second NPRM, many petitioners ask us
to reconsider our decision concerning the incumbent renewal deadline, arguing that the new renewal requirement
will promote inequity between the incumbents and new licensees.  These parties assert that incumbent 39 GHz
licensees will be placed at a disadvantage due to a shorter period of time in which to  meet the performance requirements.  ART, for example, contends that the renewal deadline is "antithetical"
to our policy of ensuring that licensees have flexibility and time to acquire necessary capital and to build-out their
systems.  

     52.  We disagree that the renewal requirements adopted in the Report and Order and Second NPRM
cause inequity among licensees or are inconsistent with the Commission's stated goals in this proceeding.  Due
to recent developments, however, we are reconsidering our decision regarding renewal requirements on different
grounds.  Subsequent to the adoption of the Second Report and Order and NPRM, the Commission streamlined
its wireless license application process by implementing an automated licensing system and integrated database
for the wireless services.  The result of this effort was the Universal Licensing System (ULS).  With the
deployment of ULS, the Commission intends to "improve the consistency of the Commission's rules across
wireless services and provide a single point of reference for applicants" by consolidating the procedural rules
governing the filing and processing of wireless applications, including the procedures for license renewal, into
Part 1 of the Commission's Rules.  In this connection, Section 101.15, which required 39 GHz licensees to file
for renewal 18 months prior to the licenses expiration date, was removed and replaced by Section 1.949 of the
Commission's Rules.  Section 1.949 requires all applications for renewal of station authorization to be filed
no later than the license expiration date and no earlier than 90 days prior to the expiration date.  A showing of
substantial service must also be made at that time that an application for renewal of station authorization is filed. 
We believe that this approach better comports with our goal in this proceeding of promoting flexibility in system
design and market development.  Further, this approach conforms to the Commission's intention to promote
consistency across the wireless services.  Thus, under the new ULS guidelines 39 GHz licensees are not required
to comply with the 18 month filing requirement in former Section 101.15, but rather should refer to Section 1.949
for license renewal requirements.  We clarify, however, that the   substantial service performance requirement
under Section 101.17(a) remains the performance standard for the 39 GHz band and must be demonstrated upon
license renewal.

     53.  Biztel asks that we amend Section 101.63(a) to reflect that 39 GHz licensees are exempted from
compliance with Section 101.63(a)'s build-out requirement of mandatory operation within 18 months from the
initial date of license grant, in light of the new performance standard under Section 101.17(a).  We find that
this clarification comports with our determination in the Report and Order and Second NPRM, and, thus, we
amend Section 101.63(a) to read as follows:

     Each Station, except in Local Multipoint Distribution Services and the 38.6-40.0
     GHz band, authorized under this part must be in operation within 18 months from
     the initial date of grant.

     54.  Finally, AA&T et al., Joint Petitioners, seek clarification that incumbent service areas, and not
just individual links, will be protected from the operations of those who obtain their licenses by competitive
bidding.  Accordingly, we clarify that Section 101.147(u)(2) -- which compels applicants to be aware of any
grandfathered links within their EA -- protects all incumbent service areas from the  operations of licensees who
receive their licenses by competitive bidding.  Thus, Section 101.147(u)(2) will be modified to read:

     Applications filed pursuant to Section 101.1206 shall identify any pre-existing rectangular service area
     authorizations that are located within, or are overlapping with, the EA for which the license is sought,
     and the provisions of Section 101.103 shall apply for purposes of frequency coordination between any
     authorized rectangular service area(s) and EA service area(s) that are geographically adjoining and
     overlapping.          E.   LICENSING RULES

          1.   Antenna Requirements

     55.  The Commission requires fixed stations operating at 932.5 MHz or higher to utilize transmitting
and receiving antennas meeting or exceeding the appropriate performance standards in order to avoid frequency
interference.  Thus, it generally requires the use of either Category A antennas, or, in areas not subject to
frequency congestion, Category B antennas.  However, in the Report and Order and Second NPRM, the
Commission did not require utilization of Category A antennas and, in fact, advocated the use of a variety of
antennas, including omni-directional and sectored antennas, in order to promote the entry of point-to-multipoint
users in the 39 GHz band and to allow those users more flexibility in meeting service demands.  It stated,
however, that if a licensee utilizing an antenna other than a Category A antenna causes interference which cannot
be resolved among the licensees involved that licensee must resolve the interference by replacing its antenna with
a Category A antenna, or one with better performance.  One petitioner asks that we exclude omni-directional
or sectored antennas from directional Category A or B radiation pattern requirements, reasoning that the
interference replacement requirement confers secondary status upon point-to-multipoint users employing those
types of antennas.

     56.  As discussed in the Report and Order and Second NPRM, we permit various types of antennas
for use in the 39 GHz band because Category A directional antenna may be too restrictive to fulfill the
requirements of diverse system configurations in the 39 GHz band.  We clarify, however, that Category A and
B radiation pattern requirements do not apply to wide-beam antennas, such as omni-directional and sectored
antennas.  Point-to-multipoint licensees should benefit from this rule modification because the omni-directional
and sectored antennas "represent a more cost-effective and technically suitable alternative to traditional
narrowbeam Category A antennas when deployed in a point-to-multipoint configuration."  However, in the
event that interference difficulties arise as a result of the use of wide-beam antennas and are not resolved by the
licensees, we reserve the right to employ any reasonable method necessary to resolve the interference, including
requiring the use of better performing antennas.          2.   Frequency Coordination and Power Flux Density Limit

     57.  In the Report and Order and Second NPRM, in order to facilitate coordination between 39 GHz
licensees licensed in adjoining areas, the Commission adopted interim frequency coordination procedures, but
declined to establish final rules concerning maximum field strength or power flux density (PFD) limits pending
the results of the National Spectrum Management Association (NSMA) interference study.  We decided, in the
interim, that it was in the public interest to continue to use the frequency coordination procedures in Section
101.103(d) of our rules, as amended, with the following modifications:  (1) neighboring co-channel and adjacent
channel licensees must coordinate within 16 kilometers of an adjacent service area boundary, and (2) licensees
that receive coordination notifications must respond within 10 days, as opposed to the 30 days afforded under
the former rules.  

     58.  Several petitioners express concern regarding the interim coordination boundaries and
notification response time.  First, regarding coordination boundaries, one party contends that a coordination
distance of 16 km for 39 GHz services is not enough to preclude the possibility of harmful interference, and
suggests that a distance of 50 km be used.  WinStar disagrees, maintaining that the frequency coordination
measures are interim in nature and that "it would be counterproductive to adopt [permanent] interference
measures" prior to analyzing the results of the NSMA study.  We concur with WinStar as we have received no
notice of difficulties to date with the interim rule, nor to our knowledge, have incumbent licensees experienced
complications.  Therefore, we find that it is in the public interest  to retain the interim rule requiring licensees to
coordinate frequency interference within 16 kilometers of an adjacent service area boundary, pending the
conclusion and analysis of the NSMA study.  

     59.  Second, ART and WinStar request a reduction in notification response time, with ART
requesting a decrease from 10 to 5 business days.  ART argues that 5 business days would better facilitate the
ability of a licensee to determine the impact of an interference problem and to rapidly meet customer needs. 
We are not persuaded that a shorter response time will necessarily decrease burdens on licensees and Commission
staff.  We also are concerned that a five-day response time could unduly burden coordination notice recipients
by forcing them to rush a response without having sufficient time to fully consider the relevant technical data of
the proposed operation.  Thus, we conclude that a reduction in the notification response is not warranted at this
time.

          3.   Partitioning and Disaggregation

     60.  In the Report and Order and Second NPRM, the Commission stated that all entities eligible to
hold 39 GHz licenses should be permitted to partition and disaggregate spectrum within the 39 GHz band. 
It stated that these options would enhance 39 GHz licensee flexibility with respect to system design and service
offerings.  Some petitioners incorrectly read these rules to mean that these options are not available to
incumbent licensees.  We, therefore, clarify that all 39 GHz licensees, including incumbents and those who
obtain their 39 GHz license by competitive bidding, may partition and disaggregate.
 
     61.  Although the Report and Order and Second NPRM did not address the issue of combined
partitioning and disaggregation agreements, WinStar requests that we permit this type of arrangement.  The
Commission has previously allowed such combinations in other services and has found that providing licensees
such flexibility promotes "competitive service offerings, encourages new market entrants, and  ensures quality
service to the public."  Therefore, in keeping with the underlying purpose of this proceeding, i.e., to promote
flexibility both in system design and service, and to encourage new entrants into the market, we permit all 39 GHz
licensees to enter into combined partitioning and disaggregation agreements.

     62.  In addition, in the Report and Order and Second NPRM, the Commission decided to allow
partitioning according to county boundaries or geo-political subdivisions.  WinStar requests that licensees be
allowed to partition along any licensee defined service area arguing that requiring partitioning along geo-political
subdivision boundaries is "unduly restrictive and will diminish the utility of licensees' partitioning abilities." 
We agree with WinStar's concern and will observe the policy -- as established in the PCS Order -- of allowing
licensees to determine the area to be partitioned.  Therefore, Section 101.56(a)(1) is amended as follows:

     The holder of a EA authorization to provide service pursuant to the competitive
     bidding process and any incumbent licensee of rectangular service areas in the
     38.6-40.0 GHz band may enter into agreements with eligible parties to partition
     any portion of its service area as defined by the partitioner and partitionee. 
     Alternatively, licensees may enter into agreements or contracts to disaggregate any
     portion of spectrum, provided acquired spectrum is disaggregated according to
     frequency pairs.

     63.  WinStar also raised the issue of whether licensees utilizing bidding credits should be permitted
to partition and disaggregate their spectrum in the same manner as licensees not eligible for such provisions, and
favored permitting partitioning and disaggregation by such licensees, subject to our unjust enrichment rules. 
We concur.  We have permitted licensees utilizing bidding credits to partition and disaggregate their spectrum
in other services, and we find no reason not to allow 39 GHz licensees to have the same opportunity.  By this
action, we encourage the participation of those who desire individual links, smaller service areas, or smaller
spectrum blocks in the provision of 39 GHz service.  Thus, we will amend Section 101.56(i) accordingly.

     F.   SECOND NOTICE OF PROPOSED RULE MAKING

     64.  In the Second NPRM, the Commission sought comment on the appropriate provisions to prevent
unjust enrichment and ensure effective implementation of partitioning and disaggregation in the 39 GHz
service.  It also sought comment on how to calculate the unjust enrichment payments for 39 GHz licensees that
are awarded bidding credits and subsequently partition or disaggregate to a business not qualifying for bidding
credits or not qualifying for the same level of bidding credits, and asked commenters to address whether the unjust
enrichment payments should be calculated on a proportional basis.

     65.  Subsequent to our issuance of the Second NPRM, we adopted a provision in Part 1 of the
Commission's Rules for all auctionable services that provides a uniform approach for calculating unjust
enrichment payments in the context of partitioning and disaggregation.  Since we received no comments
addressing the issue of calculating unjust enrichment payments, we will adopt the uniform procedures set forth
in Sections 1.2111(d) and 1.2111(e) of our rules for the 39 GHz service and amend Section 101.56(i)
accordingly.  As a result,  we will calculate unjust enrichment payments using population to determine the relative
value of the partitioned area and the amount of spectrum disaggregated to determine the relative value of the
disaggregated spectrum. Population will be calculated based upon the latest available census data.  The
Commission has consistently adopted this approach for other wireless services, including most recently LMDS. 
For purposes of applying our unjust enrichment payments when a combined partitioning and disaggregation is
proposed, we will use a combination of both population of the partitioned area and amount of spectrum
disaggregated to make these pro rata calculations.

                    REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY ACT

        Supplemental Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis

                  Memorandum Opinion and Order 

     As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act, see 5 U.S.C.  603 (RFA), an Initial Regulatory Analysis
(IRFA) was incorporated into the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and Order (NPRM and Order) in this
proceeding.  The Commission sought written public comment on the proposals in the NPRM and Order,
including comment on the IRFA.  A Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (FRFA) was incorporated in the Report
and Order and Second Notice of Proposed Rule Making in this proceeding in ET Docket No. 95-183.  This
present Supplemental FRFA, associated with the present Memorandum Opinion and Order (MO&O), reflects
revised or additional information to that contained in the FRFA.  This supplemental FRFA conforms to the
RFA.

A.   Need for, and Objectives of, the Memorandum Opinion and Order 

     This MO&O addresses petitions for reconsideration and clarification received in response to the Report
and Order and further simplifies and corrects the rules implemented in the Report and Order.  This MO&O
reconsiders the service area definitions established in the Report and Order and determines to license all channel
blocks in the 39 GHz band using Economic Areas (EAs).  In the Report and Order, the Commission determined
to license all channel blocks in the 39 GHz band using Basic Trading Areas (BTAs).  However, due to recent
developments concerning Rand McNally's copyright interests in BTAs, the Commission has determined that the
public interest would be better served by licensing all 39 GHz channel blocks using Economic Areas (EAs) as
the authorized service areas. 
     
     The MO&O further modifies the Commission's geographic partitioning provisions and permits the use
of partitioning and disaggregation by parties taking advantage of bidding credits under our competitive bidding
licensing rules. In the NPRM, we proposed a partitioning scheme with respect to rural telephone companies. 
Then, in the Report and Order, the Commission determined that the option of partitioning should be made
available to all entities eligible to be licensees in the 39 GHz band. The Commission also concluded  that all 39
GHz licensees should be permitted to disaggregate their spectrum blocks.  In the MO&O, we have clarified that
incumbent licensees may partition and disaggregate their non-EA licenses.  We have allowed all 39 GHz licensees
to enter into and/or combine existing partitioning and disaggregation agreements and we have permitted licensees
to define their own partitioning boundaries along licensee service areas in order to encourage new entrants,
including small businesses, into the market.  We will enable licensees utilizing bidding credits to partition and
disaggregate, subject to unjust enrichment provisions.

     In the MO&O, the Commission reconsiders its decision regarding license renewal.  In the Report and
Order, the Commission required a showing of substantial service 18 months prior to the license expiration date. 
The MO&O, however, directs 39 GHz licensees to comport with the recently implemented Part 1 rules governing
license renewal provided in Section 1.949 of the Commission's Rules.  Section 1.949 requires all applications
for renewal of station authorization to be filed no later than the license expiration date and no sooner than 90 days
prior to the expiration date.  Finally, the Commission considered various petitions for reconsideration relating
to the dismissal of pending 39 GHz applications and coordination requirements.  The rule changes made herein
are generally minor in nature and are focused on eliminating confusion and promoting the public interest.

B.   Summary of Significant Issues Raised by Public Comments in Response to the Final     Regulatory Flexibility Analysis  

     No petitions were filed in direct response to the FRFA.   In general, the 12 petitions for reconsideration
of the Report and Order, five opposition to petitions and two replies were not directly related to small entities. 
However, one petition raised several issues that might affect small entities concerning partitioning and
disaggregation.  In particular, this party requested that the Commission allow the combination of partitioning and
disaggregation agreements and permit 39 GHz licensees to define their own boundaries for partitioning, as
opposed to partitioning according to county lines or geo-political subdivisions.  Further, Winstar requested that
licensees utilizing bidding credits be permitted to partition and disaggregate their spectrum, subject to the unjust
enrichment provisions of the Commission.

C.   Description and Estimate of the Small Entities to Which Rules Will Apply  

     In the previous FRFA in this proceeding, we determined in detail the description and estimate of the
following small entities subject to these rules from the FRFA:  cellular licensees, Broadband PCS licensees, and
Point-to-Point or Point-to-Multipoint licensees.  We include the following revision of the estimate for
broadband PCS Licensees:  The broadband PCS spectrum is divided into six frequency blocks designated A
through F, and the Commission has held auctions for each block.  The Commission defined "small entity" for
Blocks C and F as an entity that has average gross revenues of less than $40 million in the three previous calendar
years.  For Block F, an additional classification for "very small business" was added and is defined as an entity
that, together with their affiliates, has average gross revenues of not more than $15 million for the preceding three
calendar years. These regulations defining "small entity" in the context of broadband PCS auctions have been
approved by the SBA.  No small businesses within the SBA approved definition bid successfully for licenses
in Blocks A and B.  There were 90 winning bidders that qualified as small entities in the Block C auctions.  A
total of 93 small and very small business bidders won approximately 40% of the 1,479 licenses for Blocks D,
E, and F.  Based on this information, we conclude that the number of small broadband PCS licensees will
include the 90 winning C Block bidders and the 93 qualifying bidders in the D, E, and F blocks, for a total of 183
small entity PCS providers as defined by the SBA and the Commission's auction rules.

D.   Description of the Projected Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Other Compliance     Requirements

     There are no general reporting or recordkeeping requirements proposed or adopted in this MO&O.  

E.   Steps Taken to Minimize Significant Economic Impact on Small Entities, and Significant    Alternatives Considered
     
     The use of EAs as authorized service areas will better serve the public interest.  Specifically, EAs will
provide ample population coverage and allow small businesses the flexibility to provide a variety of services. 
Further, the use of EAs will promote an equitable distribution of licenses among various geographic areas and
promote economic opportunity among a wide variety of applicants.  Finally, those licensees seeking service areas
smaller than EAs may partition or disaggregate.

     The minor partitioning and disaggregation rule changes implemented herein will further facilitate market
entry by small entities who may lack the financial resources for participation in the auctions, including small
businesses.  By permitting flexible partitioning and disaggregation, small businesses will be able to obtain
licenses for smaller service areas and smaller amounts of spectrum tailored to meet the needs of their proposed
service.  Finally, allowing geographic partitioning of 39 GHz licenses defined by the parties along licensed service
areas, rather than only by county lines or geo-political subdivisions, will permit small businesses to enter the
marketplace.

     The license renewal procedures governed by Section 1.949 of the Commission's Rules better comport
with the Commission's goal of promoting flexibility in system design and market development  Further, this
approach fosters uniformity across the wireless services.

     The Commission will send a copy of the MO&O, including this SFRFA, in a report to be sent to
Congress pursuant to the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996.  In addition, the
Commission will send  copy of the MO&O, including the SFRFA, to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small
Business Administration.  A copy of the MO&O and SFRFA (or summaries thereof) will be published in the
Federal Register.

     Report to Congress:  The Commission will send a copy of the Memorandum Opinion and Order,
including this FRFA, in a report to be sent to Congress pursuant to the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement
Fairness Act of 1996, see 5 U.S.C.  801(a)(1)(A).  In addition, the Commission will send a copy of the
Memorandum Opinion and Order, including FRFA, to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business
Administration.  A copy of the Memorandum Opinion and Order and FRFA (or summaries thereof) will also
be published in the Federal Register.  See 5 U.S.C.  604(b).
