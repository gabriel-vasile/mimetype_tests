Improving Government Regulations; Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory 
and Deregulatory Actions

AGENCY: Department of Defense (DoD).

ACTION: Semiannual regulatory agenda.

_______________________________________________________________________

SUMMARY: The Department of Defense (DoD) is publishing this semiannual 
agenda of regulatory documents, including those that are procurement-
related, for public information and comments under Executive Order 
12866 ``Regulatory Planning and Review.'' This agenda incorporates the 
objective and criteria, when applicable, of the regulatory reform 
program under the Executive order and other regulatory guidance. It 
contains DoD issuances initiated by DoD components that may have 
economic and environmental impact on State, local, or tribal interests 
under the criteria of Executive Order 12866. Although most DoD 
issuances listed in the agenda are of negligible public impact, their 
nature may be of public interest and, therefore, are published to 
provide notice of rulemaking and an opportunity for public 
participation in the internal DoD rulemaking process.

     For this edition of the Department of Defense's regulatory 
agenda, the most important significant regulatory actions are 
included in The Regulatory Plan, which appears in part II of this 
issue of the Federal Register. The regulatory plan entries are 
listed in the table of contents below and are denoted by a 
bracketed bold reference, which directs the reader to the 
appropriate sequence number in part II.

     This agenda updates the report published on April 24, 2006, 
and includes regulations expected to be issued and under review 
over the next 12 months. The next agenda is scheduled to be 
published in the spring of 2007, with the next regulatory plan 
scheduled to be published in the fall of 2007. In addition to this 
agenda, DoD components also publish rulemaking notices pertaining 
to their specific statutory administration requirements as 
required.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This edition of the Unified Agenda of 
Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions is composed of the 
regulatory status reports, including procurement-related regulatory 
status reports, from the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and 
the Departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force. Included also is the 
regulatory status report from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, whose 
civil works functions fall under the reporting requirements of 
Executive Order 12866 and involve water resource projects and 
regulation of activities in waters of the United States.

     DoD issuances range from DoD directives (reflecting 
departmental policy) to implementing instructions and regulations 
(largely internal and used to implement directives). The OSD agenda 
section contains the primary directives under which DoD components 
promulgate their implementing regulations.

     To ease identification and to differentiate among the variety 
of issuances reported, they are identified by their DoD internal 
numbering system, which denotes component level of authority and 
type of issuance, in addition to the required CFR number.

     In addition, this agenda, although published under the 
reporting requirements of Executive Order 12866, continues to be 
the DoD single-source reporting vehicle, which identifies issuances 
that are currently applicable under the various regulatory reform 
programs in progress. Therefore, DoD components will identify those 
rules which come under the criteria of the:

a. Regulatory Flexibility Act;

b. Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995;

c. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995.

[[Page 73127]]

     Those DoD issuances, which are directly applicable under these 
statutes, will be identified in the agenda and their action status 
indicated. Generally, the regulatory status reports in this agenda 
will contain five sections: (1) Prerule stage; (2) proposed rule 
stage; (3) final rule stage; (4) completed actions; and (5) long-
term actions. Where certain regulatory actions indicate that small 
entities are affected, the effect on these entities may not 
necessarily have significant economic impact on a substantial 
number of these entities as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility 
Act (5 U.S.C. 601(6)).

     Although not a regulatory agency, DoD will continue to 
participate in regulatory initiatives designed to reduce economic 
costs and unnecessary environmental burdens upon the public. 
Comments and recommendations are invited on the rules reported and 
should be addressed to the DoD component representatives identified 
in the regulatory status reports. Although sensitive to the needs 
of the public, as well as regulatory reform, DoD reserves the right 
to exercise the exemptions and flexibility permitted in its 
rulemaking process in order to proceed with its overall defense-
oriented mission. The publishing of this agenda does not waive the 
applicability of the military affairs exemption in section 553 of 
title 5 U.S.C. and section 3 of Executive Order 12866.

Dated: September 5, 2006.

Acting Deputy Director, Administration and Management.

Abstract: The Department of Defense (DoD) is revising the DoD Grant and 
Agreement Regulations (DoDGARs) to implement Office of Management and 
Budget (OMB) guidance on nonprocurement suspension and debarment and to 
make needed technical corrections. To implement the OMB guidance, DoD 
is adopting a new part in title 2 of the CFR, the Governmentwide title 
recently established for OMB guidance and agencies' implementing 
regulations on grants and agreements. The Department also is removing 
the common rule on nonprocurement suspension and debarment that is in 
the DoDGARs in 32 CFR, chapter I, subchapter C, since the common rule 
is superseded by the new DoD part implementing the OMB guidance. This 
regulatory action is the first step toward relocating all of the 
DoDGARs to 2 CFR.

Abstract: This rulemaking is the Department of Defense portion of a 
multiple-agency action. The agencies are amending their rules 
implementing Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-110 
``Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements With 
Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals, and Other Nonprofit 
Organizations.'' The amendments to the rules incorporate updated 
language in Circular A-110 requiring Federal awarding agencies to 
ensure that all data produced under awards subject to the Circular are 
made available to the public through the procedures established under 
the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). OMB updated the Circular 
language in this way in October 1999, in response to a provision in 
Public Law 105-277. With this rule amendment to 32 CFR parts 22 and 32, 
the Department of Defense therefore will maintain policies on access to 
data produced under awards subject to Circular A-110 that are 
consistent with the policies of other executive departments and 
agencies.

Abstract: This rule proposes policy and assigns responsibilities for

transferred to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget 
(OMB) the Comptroller General's authority to settle claims. The OMB 
Director subsequently delegated some of these authorities to the 
Department of Defense (DoD). Later, the General Accounting Office Act 
of 1996 codified many of these delegations to the Secretary of Defense 
and others and transferred to the OMB Director the authority of the 
Comptroller General to waive uniformed service member and employee 
debts arising out of the erroneous payment of pay or allowances 
exceeding $1,500. The OMB Director subsequently delegated the authority 
to waive such debts of uniformed service members and DoD employees to 
the Secretary of Defense. The Secretary of Defense further delegated 
his claims settlement and waiver authorities to the General Counsel. 
This rule implements the reassignment of the Comptroller General's 
former duties within the Department of Defense with little impact on

Abstract: Amends the Defense FAR Supplement to establish a pilot 
program that permits contracting officers to use FAR part 12 
(Acquisition of Commercial Items) procedures to award follow-on 
contracts for the production of items begun as prototype projects under 
other transaction agreements. The follow-on contract must be awarded to 
a nontraditional defense contractor; must not exceed $50,000,000; must 
be either firm-fixed-price or fixed-price with economic price 
adjustment; and must be awarded on or before September 30, 2008. This 
change implements section 847 of the National Defense Authorization Act 
for Fiscal Year 2004 and is intended to ease the transition of 
nontraditional defense contractors from prototype transactions to 
standard contracts.

upstream channel restricted area boundary to provide a small craft 
portage route around the lock and dam along the north shoreline. This 
reduces interference between fisherman and the boat ramp.

Abstract: TRICARE eligible beneficiaries, who are entitled to Medicare 
Part A on the basis of age, disability, or end-stage renal disease, 
maintain their TRICARE eligibility when they are enrolled in the 
supplementary medical insurance program under Part B of Medicare. In 
general, in the case of medical or dental care provided to these 
individuals for which payment may be made under both Medicare and 
TRICARE, Medicare is the primary payer and TRICARE will normally pay 
the actual out-of-pocket costs incurred by the person. This proposed 
rule prescribes double coverage payment procedures and makes revisions 
to TRICARE rules to accommodate beneficiaries who are eligible under 
both Medicare and TRICARE and who participate in Medicare's outpatient 
prescription drug program under Medicare Part D.

Abstract: Currently, any individual who is a civilian employee of the

of medical services. We propose to provide an exception to this 
prohibition to permit these individuals to be authorized CHAMPUS 
providers if they meet three conditions. First, they must be employed 
by the Government agency on a part-time basis; that is, less than 20 
hours per week. Second, the agency must certify that unique or special 
circumstances detrimental to the delivery of quality health care exist 
that can be overcome only by employing part-time, non-Government 
physicians. Third, the agency and the physician must certify that they 
understand and have taken appropriate measures to avoid violation of 
Standards of Conduct, dual compensation, and conflict of interest 
requirements including protection against referral of patients to the 
employee's private practice.

Priority: Substantive, Nonsignificant

Legal Authority: 10 USC 55; 5 USC 301

CFR Citation: 32 CFR 199

Legal Deadline: None

Abstract: This rule clarifies our double coverage policy for non-
institutional claims for beneficiaries with primary health insurance. 
TRICARE network, non-network but participating, and non-participating 
providers are all reimbursed differently under current procedures. This 
has had the unintended effect of discouraging TRICARE network 
participation since non-network but participating providers receive the 
most favorable treatment with respect to double coverage calculations. 
The Department proposes to revise double coverage reimbursement 
calculations by reimbursing all providers up to 100 percent of the 
CHAMPUS Maximum Allowable Charge after the primary health insurance has 
paid or 115 percent for nonparticipating providers.

895. [bull] TRICARE; RESERVE AND GUARD FAMILY MEMBER BENEFITS

Priority: Other Significant

Legal Authority: 10 USC 55; 5 USC 301

CFR Citation: 32 CFR 199

Legal Deadline: None

Abstract: This proposed rule would implement the authority granted the 
Secretary of Defense under sections 704 and 705 of the Ronald W. Reagan 
National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005. These 
provisions would apply to eligible family members who become eligible 
for TRICARE as a result of their Reserve Component (RC) sponsor 
(including those with delayed effective date orders up to 90 days) 
being called or ordered to active duty for more than 30 days in support 
of a Federal/contingency operation and choose to participate in TRICARE 
Standard or Extra, rather than enroll in TRICARE Prime. The first 
provision would waive the annual TRICARE Standard (or Extra) 
deductible, which is set by law (10 U.S.C. 1079(b)) at $150 per 
individual and $300 per family ($50/$150 for families of members in pay 
grades E-4 and below). The second provision would increase TRICARE 
payments up to 115 percent of the TRICARE maximum allowable charge, 
less the applicable patient cost share if not previously waived under 
the first provision, for covered outpatient health services received 
from a provider that does not participate (accept assignment) with 
TRICARE. These provisions would help ensure timely access to health 
care and maintain clinically appropriate continuity of health care to 
family members of Reservists and Guardsmen activated in support of a 
Federal/contingency operation; limit the out-of-pocket health care 
expenses for those family members; and remove potential barriers to 
health care access by Guard and Reserve families.
