Background and Purpose

    DHS is issuing the Homeland Security Acquisition Regulation (HSAR) 
to establish a uniform departmentwide acquisition policy and 
regulation. The HSAR uses plain language for clarity and understanding; 
does not contain internal operating procedures that do not have a 
significant effect beyond DHS; and establishes the DHS Mentor-Protege 
Program.
    The Department formed a HSAR Work Group that included both 
acquisition and legal staff from both the Department and its 
organizational elements. The team's approach was to develop and issue a 
regulation that delegates authority, where appropriate, to the lowest 
levels, is concise, and is simple for contractor's, offerors, and DHS 
contracting personnel to use.

Regulatory Assessment

    This interim rule is not subject to review by the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866, Regulatory 
Planning and Review, as supplemented by Executive Order 13132, 
Federalism, and is not a major rule under 5 U.S.C. 804. It therefore 
does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under 
section 6(a)(3) of that Order. The Office of Management and Budget has 
not reviewed it under Executive Order 12866. It is not significant 
under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of 
Homeland Security.

Small Entities

    Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612), we have 
considered whether this interim rule would have a significant economic 
impact on a substantial number of small entities. The term ``small 
entities'' comprises small businesses, not-for-profit organizations 
that are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their 
fields, and governmental jurisdictions with populations of less than 
50,000. This interim rule is not expected to have a significant 
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the 
meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. An Initial Regulatory

[[Page 67870]]

Flexibility Analysis has not been performed.
    The Mentor-Prot[eacute]g[eacute] Program does apply to large 
business and small business firms that receive a form of incentive for 
assuming the role of mentor to small businesses, other small 
disadvantaged businesses, qualified HUBZone small businesses, small 
businesses owned and controlled by service disabled veterans, and small 
women-owned businesses. It is expected that the prot[eacute]g[eacute] 
entities would directly benefit from the forms of mentoring provided 
for in this rule. The interim regulation provides consistency with the 
FAR.

Collection of Information

    This interim rule contains information collection requirements 
subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520) that are 
being submitted to OMB for approval. As defined in 5 CFR 1320.3(c), 
``collection of information'' comprises reporting, recordkeeping, 
monitoring, posting, labeling, and other, similar actions. DHS is 
awaiting approval from OMB for the five (5) forms that are referenced 
in the HSAR, and that can be found in Part 3053. DHS is also awaiting 
approval and the assignment of numbers for contract, solicitations and 
protests.
    This information will be shown in HSAR Section 3001.106 and Part 
3053, and will be published separately. This information is required by 
the Office of the Chief Procurement Officer in order to solicit, 
negotiate, award, and administer contracts in accordance with the 
Federal Acquisition Regulation, other regulations and statutes; in 
order to evaluate offers, ensure appropriate contract cost controls, 
and minimize conditions conducive to fraud, waste, and abuse; and in 
order to collect appropriate information from prospective contractors 
when protests are filed.
    Additionally, the collections of information in this rule in part 
3053 are for DHS Forms 0700-01 through 0700-05. These forms will be 
used when applicable for the following purposes: Cumulative Claim and 
Reconciliation Statement; Contractor's Assignment of Refunds, Rebates, 
Credits, and Other Amounts; Contractor's Release; Contractor Report of 
Government Property; and Employee Claim for Wage Restitution.
    As required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 
3507(d)), we have submitted a copy of this interim rule to the Office 
of Management and Budget (OMB) for its review of the collection of 
information. Due to the circumstances surrounding this temporary rule, 
we asked for ``emergency processing'' of our request.
    We ask for public comment on the collection of information to help 
us determine how useful the information is; whether it can help us 
perform our functions better; whether it is readily available 
elsewhere; how accurate our estimate of the burden of collection is; 
how valid our methods for determining burden are; how we can improve 
the quality, usefulness, and clarity of the information; and how we can 
minimize the burden of collection.
    If you submit comments on the collection of information, submit 
them both to OMB and to DHS at the address indicated under ADDRESSES, 
by the date under DATES.
    You need not respond to a collection of information unless it 
displays a currently valid control number from OMB.

Federalism

    A rule has implications for federalism under Executive Order 13132, 
Federalism, if it has a substantial direct effect on State or local 
governments and would either preempt State law or impose a substantial 
direct cost of compliance on them. This rule is not subject to the 
requirements of Executive Order 13132. DHS has determined that this 
proposed rule does not contain federalism implications and would not 
preempt State laws.

Determination To Issue an Interim Rule

    A determination has been made under the authority of the Secretary 
of Homeland Security that urgent and compelling reasons exist to 
publish an interim rule prior to affording the public an opportunity to 
comment. This interim rule implements Sections 833 and 835 of the 
Homeland Security Act (Public Law 107-296), signed on November 25, 
2002. The act provides authorities to be used in contracting for 
supplies and services required to accomplish the DHS mission of 
preventing and reducing terrorist attacks as well as minimizing damage 
and assisting in recovery from terrorist attacks for the Department and 
its organizational elements (OEs). Comments received in response to 
this interim rule will be considered in the formation of the final 
rule.
    Under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) 
finds that good cause exists for not publishing a general notice of 
proposed rulemaking (NPRM). DHS consists of agencies and other 
operating elements of Government that pre-existed the formation of DHS. 
Prior to DHS's formation, those agencies used supplemental acquisition 
regulations as a foundation for the conduct of their procurement and 
acquisition functions. For example, the Coast Guard utilized the 
Department of Transportation (DOT) Acquisition Regulations found at 48 
CFR Chapter 12. The Coast Guard can no longer rely on the DOT 
regulations since they no longer are a part of DOT. Similarly, 
organizations that used the Department of Treasury's or Department of 
Justice's acquisition supplements can no longer rely on those 
regulations.
    DHS finds that due to an urgent need for seamless continued 
acquisition and contracting operations of the previous agencies and 
organizations that now comprise DHS, it is impracticable to afford the 
public an opportunity to comment prior to issuing this interim rule. 
Currently, there are no Department-level acquisition regulations 
governing DHS's vital contracting business. Consequently, a delay in 
issuing this regulation would be contrary to the public interest. This 
regulation realigns contracting authority within the Department and 
provides uniform regulatory guidance for the acquisition of supplies 
and services required to accomplish DHS's mission of preventing and 
reducing terrorist attacks as well as minimizing damage and assisting 
in recovery from terrorist attacks.
    Under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3), DHS also finds that for the same reasons 
discussed above respecting 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), good cause exists for 
making this rule effective in less than 30 days after publication in 
the Federal Register.

    (c) For nonappropriated fund contracts, the FAR and HSAR will be 
followed to the maximum extent feasible excluding provisions determined 
by counsel not to apply to Nonappropriated Fund institutions (NAFIs). 
Contracting terms may provide for mutual agreement as to the Board of 
Contract Appeals jurisdiction but this policy will not confer court 
jurisdiction concerning NAFIs that does not otherwise exist.

3001.301  Policy.

    (a)(1) The HSAR is issued for Departmental guidance according to 
the policy cited in (FAR) 48 CFR 1.301. The HSAR establishes uniform 
Homeland Security policies and procedures for all acquisition 
activities within the Department of the Homeland Security, except the 
TSA. OE supplemental acquisition regulations to be inserted in the HSAR 
as a HSAR supplement regulation must be reviewed and approved by the 
Chief Procurement Officer (CPO) before the CPO submits the proposed 
coverage for publication in the Federal Register according to (FAR) 48 
CFR 1.501.
    (2)(i) The CPO is authorized to issue internal agency guidance at 
any organizational level. Department-wide procedures are contained in 
the HSAM. The HCA may implement internal procedures or supplement the 
FAR, HSAR, or HSAM as provided in HSAM 3001.3. The HCA may issue 
procedures or delegate this authority to any organizational level 
deemed appropriate. OE procedures may be more restrictive or require 
higher approval levels than those permitted by the HSAM, unless 
otherwise specified.
    (ii) Individuals granted authority in the HSAR may delegate that 
authority, unless the FAR or HSAR specifically state that the authority 
is not delegable.
    (b) The Under Secretary of Management established procedures 
through Management Directive (MD) 0490.1, entitled Federal Register 
Notice and Rules, to ensure that agency acquisition regulations are 
published for comment in the Federal Register in conformance with FAR 
procedures at (FAR) 48 CFR subpart 1.5.


3001.301-70  Amendment of HSAR.

    (a) Request for changes to the regulation may be recommended by DHS 
personnel, other Government agencies, or the public. Change requests 
are to be submitted in the following format to the Department of 
Homeland Security, Attn: Office of the Under Secretary of Management, 
Chief Procurement Officer, Washington, DC 20598.
    (1) Problem: Succinctly state the problem(s) created by current 
HSAR requirements or processes and describe the factual or legal 
reasons for requesting a regulatory change.
    (2) Recommendation: Identify the recommended change by using the 
current language and lining through the words to be deleted and 
inserting proposed language in brackets. If the change is extensive, 
deleted language may be displayed by forming a box with diagonal lines 
connecting the corners.
    (3) Discussion: Explain why the change is necessary and how the 
change will solve the problem. Address any cost or administrative 
impact on Government activities, offerors, and contractors. Provide any 
other helpful information and documents such as statutes, legal 
decisions, regulations, reports, etc.
    (4) Point of Contact: Provide a point of contact for answering 
questions regarding the recommendation, along with a telephone number, 
e-mail or other method of reaching the contact.
    (b) The HSAR is maintained by the CPO through the HSAR/HSAM change 
process (i.e., input from various OEs including representatives 
specifically designated to formulate Departmental acquisition policies 
and procedures).
    (1) Homeland Security Acquisition Circular (HSAC). HSAC (see (HSAR) 
48 Chapter 3001.301-72) will be used to amend (HSAR) 48 Chapter 30.
    (2) HSAR Notices will be issued (with a specified expiration date) 
when interim guidance is necessary under any of the following 
circumstances:
    (i) To promulgate, as rapidly as possible, selected material in a 
general or narrative manner, in advance of a HSAC issuance;
    (ii) To disseminate other acquisition related information; or
    (iii) To issue guidance that is expected to be effective for a 
period of 1 year or less.


3001.301-71  Effective date.

    Unless otherwise stated, the following applies--
    (a) Statements in HSACs or HSAR Notices that the content is ``upon 
a specified date,'' or that changes in the document are ``to be used 
upon receipt,'' mean that any new or revised provisions, clauses, 
procedures, or forms must be included in solicitations or contracts 
issued thereafter; and
    (b) Unless expressly directed by statute or regulation, if 
solicitations have been issued prior to the HSAC or HSAR notice receipt 
or publication, the new information (e.g., forms and clauses) need not 
be included if the Chief of the Contracting Office (COCO) determines, 
in writing, that including the new information would not be in the best 
interests of the Government.


3001.301-72  HSAC or HSAR Notice numbering.

    HSACs and HSAR Notices will be numbered consecutively on a fiscal 
year basis beginning with number ``01'' prefixed by the last two digits 
of the fiscal year (e.g., HSAR Notices 03-01 and 03-02 indicate the 
first two HSAR Notices issued in fiscal year 2003).


3001.303  Publication and codification.

    (a) The HSAR is issued as chapter 30 of Title 48 of the CFR.

[[Page 67873]]

    (1) The FAR numbering illustrations at (FAR) 48 CFR 1.105-2 apply 
to the HSAR.
    (2) Coverage within HSAR 48 CFR chapter 30 is identified by the 
prefix ``30'' followed by the complete FAR cite which may extend 
downward to the subparagraph level (e.g., (HSAR) 48 CFR 3001.101).
    (3) Coverage in HSAR Chapter 30 that supplements the FAR will use 
part, subpart, section and subsection numbers ending in ``70'' through 
``89''. A series of numbers beginning with ``70'' is used for 
provisions and clauses (e.g., (HSAR) 48 CFR 3001.301-70).
    (4) Coverage in HSAR 48 CFR chapter 30, other than that identified 
with a ``70'' or higher number, which implements the FAR uses the 
identical number sequence and caption of the FAR segment being 
implemented which may extend downward to the subparagraph level. 
Subparagraph numbers/letters may not be shown as sequential, but may be 
shown by the specific paragraph/subparagraph implemented from the FAR 
(e.g., (HSAR) 48 CFR 3003.301 contains subparagraphs (a) and (b) 
because only these subparagraphs, correlating to FAR, are being 
supplemented by (HSAR) 48 CFR chapter 30).
    (5) Organizational Element-unique guidance. Supplementary material 
for which there is no counterpart in the FAR or HSAR shall be 
identified using chapter, part, subpart, section, or subsection numbers 
of ``90'' and up (e.g., the U.S. Coast Guard's acronym is ``USCG''; an 
USCG-unique clause pertaining to ``Inspection and/or Acceptance'' would 
be designated ``USCG 3052.246-90'').
    (6) References and citations. Cross references to the FAR in the 
HSAR will be cited by ``FAR'' followed by the FAR numbered cite, and 
cross reference to the HSAM in the HSAR will be cited by ``HSAM'' 
followed by the HSAM numbered cite.
    (7) Department/agency and OE supplements must parallel the FAR and 
HSAR numbering, except department/agency supplemental numbering uses 
subsection numbering of 90 and up, instead of 70 and up.

3001.304  Agency control and compliance procedures.

    (a) The HSAR is under the direct oversight and control of the 
Homeland Security, Office of the Chief Procurement Officer (OCPO), 
which is responsible for evaluation, review, and issuance of all 
Department-wide acquisition regulations and guidance. Each HCA may 
supplement the HSAR with OE guidance. Supplementation should be kept to 
a minimum. OEs proposing to issue regulatory supplements or use 
solicitation or contract clauses on a repetitive basis must obtain 
legal review by the OE's legal counsel and forward supplements to the 
CPO for concurrence prior to publication in the Federal Register.
    (c) The CPO is responsible for evaluating all regulatory coverage 
in agency acquisition regulations to determine if the substance could 
apply to other agencies and to make recommendation for inclusion in the 
FAR.

subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Pub. L. 
107-296.


3009.104-72  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart--
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in 
section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to 
section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code 
shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 
80 percent' each place it appears.
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for 
subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Pub. L. 
107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the 
Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall 
be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan 
(or a series of related transactions)--

[[Page 67877]]

    (1) The entity completes after the date of enactment of this Act, 
the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the 
properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or 
substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of 
a domestic partnership;
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote 
or value) of the entity is held--
    (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic 
corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by 
reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic 
partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason 
of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; 
and
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition 
includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in 
the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is 
created or organized when compared to the total business activities of 
such expanded affiliated group.
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by 
paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue 
Code of 1986, respectively.


3009.104-73  Special rules.

    The following special rules shall apply when determining whether a 
foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic 
corporation.
    (a) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a 
foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these 
shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
    (1) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which 
includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
    (2) Stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related 
to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of section 835 of the 
Homeland Security Act (the Act), Pub. L. 107-296.
    (b) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity 
acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of 
a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period 
beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act 
and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection 
(b)(2) of the Act are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to 
a plan.
    (c) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or 
liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be 
disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of 
which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships. For purposes of applying 
subsection (b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as 
provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under 
common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.
    (e) Treatment of certain rights. (1) Certain rights shall be 
treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value 
of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
    (i) Warrants;
    (ii) Options;
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock;
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments;
    (v) Others similar interests.
    (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks 
whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value 
of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would 
defeat the purpose of section 835 of the Act.


3009.104-74  Waiver.

    (a) The Secretary shall waive subsection (a) of section 835 of Pub. 
L. 107-296 with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary

security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or 
prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that 
otherwise would not occur.

waiver is granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached with

to include a clause in a contract for a guarantee period of more than 
60 days. In such instances:
    (i) Where, after full inquiry, it has been determined that such 
longer guarantee period will not involve increased costs, a longer 
guarantee period may be substituted by the contracting officer for the 
usual 60 days; or
    (ii) Where the full inquiry discloses that such longer guarantee 
period will involve, or is reasonably expected to involve, increased 
costs, such facts and the reasons for the need for such longer period 
shall be set forth in letter form to the COCO, requesting approval for 
use of guarantee period in excess of 60 days. Upon approval, the longer 
period may be inserted by the contracting officer in the first sentence

otherwise indicated by the specific instructions for their use, in any 
contract for the lease of aircraft (including aircraft used in out-
service flight training).
    (b) For the U.S. Coast Guard, the contracting officer shall insert 
the clause at (HSAR) 48 CFR 3052.228-91, Loss of or Damage to Leased 
Aircraft, in any contract for the lease of aircraft, except in the 
following circumstances:
    (1) When the hourly rental rate does not exceed $250 and the total 
rental cost for any single transaction is not in excess of $2,500:
    (2) When the cost of hull insurance does not exceed 10 percent of 
the contract rate; or
    (3) When the lessor's insurer does not grant a credit for uninsured 
hours, thereby preventing the lessor from granting the same to the 
Government.
    (c) For the U.S. Coast Guard, the contracting officer shall insert 
the clause at (HSAR) 48 CFR 3052.228-92, Fair Market Value of Aircraft,

aircraft under a bona fide lease of 30 days or more shall be liable by 
reason of his interest as lessor or title-holder of the aircraft for 
any injury to or death of persons, or damage to or loss of property, 
unless such aircraft is in the actual possession or control of such 
person at the time of such injury, death, damage or loss. On short-term 
or intermittent-use leases, however, the owner may be liable for damage 
caused by operation of the aircraft. It is usual for the aircraft owner 
to retain insurance covering this liability during the term of such 
lease. Such insurance can, often for little or no increase in premium, 
be made to cover the Government's exposure to liability as well. In 
order to take advantage of this coverage, the Risks and Indemnities 
clause at (HSAR) 48 CFR 3052.228-93 prescribed in paragraph (d)(1) of 
this section shall be used.
    (1) For the U.S. Coast Guard, the contracting officer shall insert 
the clause at (HSAR) 48 CFR 3052.228-93, Risk and Indemnities, in any

period of less than thirty days.
    (2) For the U.S. Coast Guard, any contract for out-service flight 
training shall include a clause in the contract schedule stating 
substantially that the contractor's personnel shall at all times during 
the course of the training be in command of the aircraft and that at no 
time shall other personnel be permitted to take command of the 
aircraft.

3046.702  General.


3046.702-70   Additional definitions.

    At no additional cost to the Government, means without an increase 
in price for firm-fixed-price contracts, without an increase in target 
or ceiling price for fixed price incentive contracts (see (FAR) 48 CFR 
46.707), or without an increase in estimated cost or fee for cost-
reimbursement contracts.
    Defect means any condition or characteristic in any supplies or 
services furnished by the contractor under the contract that is not in 
compliance with the requirements of the contract.
    Design and manufacturing requirements means structural and 
engineering plans and manufacturing particulars, including precise 
measurements, tolerances, materials and finished product tests for the 
major system being produced.
    Major system means a system or major subsystem used directly by the 
Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to carry out its mission(s), as 
defined by HSAM Chapter 1234, Major Acquisition Policies and Procedures 
(for dollar threshold applicable to U.S. Coast Guard, See Coast Guard 
guidance at (HSAR) 48 CFR 3046.701-90). The term does not include:
    (1) Related support equipment, such as ground-handling equipment, 
training devices and accessories thereto, unless a cost effective 
warranty for the system would require inclusion of such items; or
    (2) Commercial items sold in substantial quantities to the general 
public as described in (FAR) 48 CFR part 2.
    Performance requirements means the operating capabilities, 
maintenance, and reliability characteristics of a system that are 
determined to be necessary for it to fulfill the requirement for which 
the system is designed.


3046.703  Criteria for use of warranties.

    (a) Major Systems. The use of warranties in the procurement of 
major systems by the USCG is mandatory, unless waived (see USCG 
guidance at (HSAR) 48 CFR 3046.792). Other OEs may use the procedures 
in USCG guidance in this part as a guideline for major systems 
acquisitions.


3046.705  Limitations.

    (a) The following restrictions are applicable to DHS contracts:
    (1) The USCG is required to include a warranty in cost 
reimbursement contracts for the production of major systems 
acquisitions.
    (2) Any warranty on major system acquisitions shall not apply in 
the case of any system or component thereof which has been furnished by 
the Government to a contractor except as indicated in the USCG guidance 
at (HSAR) 48 CFR 3046.791-3.
    (3) Any warranty obtained shall specifically exclude coverage of 
damage in time of war or national emergency.


3046.706  Warranty terms and conditions.

    (a) The contracting officer, in developing the warranty terms and 
conditions, shall consider the following, and, where appropriate and 
cost beneficial, shall:
    (1) Identify the affected line item(s) and the applicable 
specification(s);
    (2) Require that the line item's design and manufacture will 
conform to:
    (i) An identified revision of a top-level drawing; and/or

[[Page 67888]]

    (ii) An identified specification or revision thereof;
    (3) Require that the system conform to the specified Government 
performance requirements;
    (4) Require that all systems and components delivered under the 
contract will be free from defects in materials and workmanship;
    (5) State that in the event of failure due to nonconformance with 
specification and/or defects in material and workmanship, the 
contractor will bear the cost of all work necessary to achieve the 
specified performance requirements, including repair and/or replacement 
of all parts;
    (6) Require the timely replacement/repair of warranted items and 
specify lead times for replacement/repair where possible;
    (7) Identify the specific paragraphs containing Government 
performance requirements which must be met;
    (8) Ensure that any performance requirements identified as goals or 
objectives in excess of specification requirements are excluded from 
the warranty provision;
    (9) Define what constitutes the start of the warranty period (e.g., 
delivery, acceptance, in-service date), the ending of the warranty 
(e.g., passing a test or demonstration, or operation without failure 
for a specified time period), and circumstances requiring an extension 
of warranty duration (e.g., extending the warranty period as a result 
of mass defect correction during warranty period);
    (10) Identify what transportation costs will be paid by the 
contractor in conjunction with warranty coverage;
    (11) Identify any conditions which will not be covered by the 
warranty, other than the exclusion of combat damage; and
    (12) Identify any limitation on the total dollar amount of the 
contractor's warranty exposure, or agreement to share costs after a 
certain dollar threshold to avoid unnecessary warranty returns.
    (b) Any contract that contains a warranty clause shall contain 
warranty implementation procedures, including warranty notification 
content and procedures, and identify the individuals responsible for 
implementation of warranty provisions. The contract may also permit the 
contractor's participation in investigation of system failures, 
providing that the contractor is reimbursed at established rates for 
fault isolation work, and that the Government receives credit for any 
payments where equipment failure is covered by warranty provisions.


3046.790  Additional USCG definitions (USCG).

    For the USCG, in accordance with Public Law 99-190, the dollar 
threshold as it pertains to the inclusion of a warranty in major 
systems acquisitions is $10 million.


3046.791  Use of warranties in major systems acquisitions by the USCG 
(USCG).

    This subpart provides the policy for the USCG to use in obtaining 
warranties from contractors when contracting for the acquisition of a 
major system.


3046.791-1  Policy (USCG).

    The USCG shall include a warranty in all contracts for major 
systems acquisitions. When drafting warranty provisions/clauses for 
major systems acquisitions, the contracting officer shall ensure that 
the items listed at (HSAR) 48 CFR 3046.706 have been considered. The 
warranty shall also meet the following requirements:
    (a) For systems or components which are commercially available, 
such warranty as is normally provided by the manufacturer or supplier 
shall be obtained in accordance with (FAR) 48 CFR 46.703(d) and (FAR) 
48 CFR 46.710(b)(2).
    (b) For systems or components provided in accordance with either 
design and manufacturing or performance requirements as specified in 
the contract or any modification to that contract, a warranty of 
compliance with the stated requirements shall be obtained.
    (c) The warranty provided under paragraph (b) of this section shall 
provide that in the event the major system or any component thereof 
fails to meet the terms of the warranty provided, the contracting 
officer may:
    (1) Require the contractor to promptly take such corrective action 
as the contracting officer determines to be necessary at no additional 
cost to the Government, including repairing or replacing all parts 
necessary to achieve the requirements set forth in the contract;
    (2) Require the contractor to pay costs reasonably incurred by the 
United States in taking necessary corrective action; or
    (3) Equitably reduce the contract price.
    (d) Any warranty shall specifically exclude coverage of combat 
damage.


3046.791-2  Tailoring warranty terms and conditions (USCG).

    (a) As the objectives and circumstances vary considerably among 
major systems acquisition programs, contracting officers shall 
appropriately tailor the warranty on a case-by-case basis, including 
remedies, exclusions, limitations and durations, provided the tailoring 
is consistent with the specific requirements of this subpart and (FAR) 
48 CFR 46.706.
    (b) Contracting officers of major systems acquisitions may exclude 
from the terms of the warranty certain defects for specified supplies 
(exclusions) and may limit the contractor's liability under the terms 
of the warranty (limitations), as appropriate, if necessary to derive a 
cost-effective warranty in light of the technical risk, contractor 
financial risk, or other program uncertainties.
    (c) Contracting officers are encouraged to structure a broader and 
more comprehensive warranty where such is advantageous. Likewise, the 
contracting officer may narrow the scope of a warranty when appropriate 
(e.g., where it would be inequitable to require a warranty of all 
performance requirements because a contractor had not designed the 
system).
    (d) Contracting officers shall not include in a warranty clause any 
terms that require the contractor to incur liability for loss, damage, 
or injury to third parties.


3046.791-3  Warranties on Government-furnished property (USCG).

    A contractor for a major systems acquisition shall not be required 
to provide the warranties specified in (HSAR) 48 CFR 3046.790-1 on any 
property furnished to that contractor by the Government except for:
    (a) Defects in installation; and
    (b) Installation or modification in such a manner that invalidates 
a warranty provided by the manufacturer of the property.


3046.792  Cost benefit analysis (USCG).

    If a specific warranty is considered not to be cost beneficial by 
the contracting officer, a waiver request shall be initiated in 
accordance with guidance at (HSAR) 48 CFR 3046.793.


3046.793  Waiver and notification procedures (USCG).

    (a) The Secretary of Homeland Security, without delegation, may 
waive the requirement for a warranty for USCG major system acquisitions 
when the waiver is in the interest of national defense or if the 
warranty obtained would not be cost beneficial. A waiver may be granted 
provided that the Committees on Appropriations of the Senate and the 
House of Representatives, the Committee on Commerce, Science and 
Transportation of the Senate, and the Committee on

[[Page 67889]]

Merchant Marine and Fisheries of the House of Representatives are 
notified, in writing, of the Secretary's intention to waive the 
warranty requirements and the reasons supporting such a determination 
prior to granting the waiver. The request for Secretarial waiver shall 
include, as a minimum:
    (1) A brief description of the major system and its stage of 
production (e.g., the number of units delivered and anticipated to be 
delivered during the life of the program);
    (2) The specific waiver requested, the duration of the waiver if it 
is to involve more than one contract, and the rationale for the waiver; 
and
    (3) All documentation supporting the request for waiver, such as a 
cost-benefit analysis.
    (b) The waiver request shall be forwarded to the Secretary, via the 
CPO. The USCG shall maintain a written record of each waiver granted 
and the Congressional notification and report made, together with 
supporting documentation.

technology resources.

    As prescribed in (HSAR) 48 CFR 3004.470-4 Contract clauses, and 
(HSAR) 48 CFR 3037.110-70 (a) and (b), insert a clause substantially 
the same as follows:

Security Requirements for Unclassified Information Technology 
Resources (Dec. 2003)

    (a) The Contractor shall be responsible for Information 
Technology (IT) security for all systems connected to a DHS network 
or operated by the Contractor for DHS, regardless of location. This 
clause applies to all or any part of the contract that includes 
information technology resources or services for which the 
Contractor must have physical or electronic access to sensitive 
information contained in DHS unclassified systems that directly 
support the agency's mission. The security requirements include, but 
are not limited to, how the Department of Homeland Security's 
sensitive information is to be handled and protected at the 
Contractor's site, (including any information stored, processed, or 
transmitted using the Contractor's computer systems), the background 
investigation and/or clearances required, and the facility security 
required. This requirement includes information technology, 
hardware, software, and the management, operation, maintenance, 
programming, and system administration of computer systems, 
networks, and telecommunications systems. Examples of tasks that 
require security provisions include--
    (1) Acquisition, transmission or analysis of data owned by DHS 
with significant replacement cost should the contractor's copy be 
corrupted; and
    (2) Access to DHS networks or computers at a level beyond that 
granted the general public, (e.g. such as bypassing a firewall).
    (b) At the expiration of the contract, the contractor shall 
return all sensitive DHS information and IT resources provided to 
the contractor during the contract, and a certification that all DHS 
information has been purged from any contractor-owned system used to 
process DHS information. Organizational elements shall conduct 
reviews to ensure that the security requirements in the contract are 
implemented and enforced.
    (c) The Contractor shall provide, implement, and maintain an IT 
Security Plan. This plan shall describe the processes and procedures 
that will be followed to ensure appropriate security of IT resources 
that are developed, processed, or used under this contract. The plan 
shall describe those parts of the contract to which this clause 
applies. The Contractor's IT Security Plan shall be compliant with 
Federal laws that include, but are not limited to, the Computer 
Security Act of 1987 (40 U.S.C. 1441 et seq.), and the Government 
Information Security Reform Act of 2000, and the Federal Information 
Security Management Act of 2002. The plan shall meet IT security 
requirements in accordance with Federal policies and procedures that 
include, but are not limited to OMB Circular A-130, Management of 
Federal Information Resources, Appendix III, and Security of Federal 
Automated Information Resources;
    (d) Within----days after contract award, the contractor shall 
submit for approval an IT Security Plan. This plan shall be 
consistent with and further detail the approach contained in the 
offeror's proposal or quote that resulted in the award of this 
contract and in compliance with the requirements stated in this 
clause. The plan, as approved by the Contracting Officer, shall be 
incorporated into the contract as a compliance document.
    (e) Within 6 months after contract award, the contractor shall 
submit written proof of IT Security accreditation to DHS for 
approval by the DHS Contracting Officer. Accreditation will be 
according to the criteria of the Homeland Security Information 
Technology Security program Publication, DHS MD 4300.Pub., Volume I, 
Policy Guide, Part A, Sensitive Systems, which is available from the 
Contracting Officer upon request. This accreditation will include a 
final security plan, risk assessment, security test and evaluation, 
and disaster recovery plan/continuity of operations plan. This 
accreditation, when accepted by the Contracting Officer, shall be 
incorporated into the contract as a compliance document, and shall 
include a final security plan, a risk assessment, security test and 
evaluation, and disaster recovery/continuity of operations plan. The 
contractor shall comply with the approved accreditation 
documentation.

(End of clause)


3052.209-70  Prohibition on contracts with corporate expatriates.

    As prescribed at (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-75, insert the following 
clause:

Prohibition on Contracts With Corporate Expatriates (Dec. 2003)

    (a) Prohibitions.
    Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of 
Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign 
incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an 
inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause.
    The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any 
specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is 
required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the 
loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from 
incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur.
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined 
in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without 
regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of 
such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' 
for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears.
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but 
for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 
Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for 
purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity 
shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to 
a plan (or a series of related transactions)--
    (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or 
indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held 
directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially 
all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic 
partnership;
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by 
vote or value) of the entity is held--
    (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic 
corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by 
reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic 
partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by 
reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic 
partnership; and
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition 
includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in 
the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is 
created or organized when compared to the total business activities 
of such expanded affiliated group.
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms 
by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules 
shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity 
should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a 
foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation 
these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which 
includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering 
related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 
835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated 
entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the 
properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-
year period beginning on the date which is after the date of 
enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership 
requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be 
treated as pursuant to a plan.
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or 
liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be 
disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose 
of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships. For purposes of 
applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of 
a

[[Page 67891]]

domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all 
domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the 
meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall 
be treated as a partnership.
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent 
necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests 
incident to the transaction, as follows:
    (i) Warrants;
    (ii) Options;
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock;
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments;
    (v) Others similar interests.
    (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks 
whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present 
value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose 
recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835.
    (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror 
under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign 
incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic 
corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland 
Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002.
    (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver 
shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

in paragraph (b) of this clause; or
    (2) The institution has a long-standing policy of pacifism based 
on historical religious affiliation.
    (d) Agreement. The Contractor represents that it does not now 
have, and agrees that during performance of this contract it will 
not adopt, any policy or practice described in paragraph (b) of this 
clause, unless the Secretary of Defense has granted an exception in 
accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this clause.
    (e) Notwithstanding any other clause of this contract, if the 
Secretary of Defense determines that the Contractor misrepresented 
its policies and practices at the time of contract award or has 
violated the agreement in paragraph (d) of this clause--
    (1) The Contractor will be ineligible for further payments under 
this and any other contracts with the Department of Homeland 
Security; and
    (2) The Government will terminate this contract for default for 
the Contractor's material failure to comply with the terms and 
conditions of award.

(End of clause)


3052.209-72  Disclosure of conflicts of interest.

    As prescribed in (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.507, insert the following 
provision:

Disclosure of Conflicts of Interest (Dec 2003)

    The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will award contracts 
only to those offerors whose objectivity is not impaired by 
conflicting interests. Based on this policy--
    (a) The offeror shall provide a statement in its proposal which 
describes in a concise manner all past, present or planned 
organizational, financial, contractual or other interest(s) with an 
organization whose interests may be substantially affected by 
Departmental activities, and which is related to the work under this 
solicitation. The interest(s) described shall include those of the 
proposer, its affiliates, proposed consultants, proposed 
subcontractors for more than 20% of the work and key personnel of 
the offeror and any subcontractor accounting for more than 20% of 
the contract. Past interest shall be limited to within one year of 
the date of the offeror's technical proposal. Key personnel, for 
purposes of this clause, shall include any person owning more than 
20% interest in the company, and the company's corporate officers, 
its senior managers and any employees responsible for making a 
decision or taking an action on this contract where the decision or 
action can have an economic or other impact on the interests of a 
regulated or affected organization.
    (b) The offeror shall describe in detail why it believes, in 
light of the interest(s) identified in (a) above, that performance 
of the proposed contract can be accomplished in an impartial and 
objective manner.
    (c) In the absence of any relevant interest identified in (a) 
above, the offeror shall submit in its proposal a statement 
certifying that to its best knowledge and belief no affiliation 
exists relevant to possible conflicts of interest. The offeror must 
obtain the same information from potential subcontractors prior to 
award of a subcontract.
    (d) The Contracting Officer will review the statement submitted 
and may require additional relevant information from the offeror. 
All such information, and any other relevant information known to 
DHS, will be used to determine whether an award to the offeror may 
create a conflict of interest. If any such conflict of interest is 
found to exist, the Contracting Officer may (1) disqualify the 
offeror, or (2) determine that it is otherwise in the best interest 
of the United States to contract with the offeror and include 
appropriate provisions to mitigate or avoid such conflict in the 
contract awarded.
    (e) The refusal to provide the disclosure or representation, or 
any additional information required, may result in disqualification 
of the offeror for award. If nondisclosure or misrepresentation is 
discovered after award, the resulting contract may be terminated. 
If, after award, the Contractor discovers a conflict of interest 
with respect to the contract awarded as a result of this 
solicitation, which could not reasonably have been known prior to 
award, an immediate and full disclosure shall be made in writing to 
the Contracting Officer. The disclosure shall include a full 
description of the conflict, a description of the action the 
contractor has taken, or proposes to take, to avoid or mitigate such 
conflict. The Contracting Officer may, however, terminate the 
contract for convenience if he or she deems that termination is in 
the best interest of the Government.

not guaranteed, and it is not to be considered as part of the 
specifications. In case of discrepancy between the index or table of 
contents and the specifications, the specifications shall govern.
