(viii)  Provide the applicant with a written list of changes required in the contract documents.  The applicant will submit two complete revised (as requested) sets of contract documents, for approval.  On one set, the County Supervisor or District Director will indicate acceptance on each sheet of the drawings, and on the cover of the specifications and all other contract documents.  At least the date and the initials of the approval official must be shown.  On projects where a consulting architect or engineer has been retained, this acceptance will be indicated only after the State Director has given written authorization.  The marked set of documents shall be available at the job site at all times for review by Rural Development.  The second set will become part of the loan docket.

(ix)  Review the proposed method of doing the work and determine whether the work can be performed satisfactorily under the proposed method.

(x)  Instruct the applicant not to incur any debts prior to loan closing for materials or labor or make any expenditures for such purposes with the expectation of being reimbursed from loan funds.

(xi)  Instruct the applicant not to commence any construction nor cause any supplies or materials to be delivered to the construction site prior to loan closing.

(xii)  Under certain conditions prescribed in Exhibit H of this subpart, provide the applicant with a copy of the leaflet, "Warning - Lead-Based Paint Hazards," which is Attachment 1 of Exhibit H (available in any Rural Development office), and the warning sheet, "Caution Note on Lead-Based Paint Hazard," which is Attachment 2 of Exhibit H (available in any Rural Development office).

(g)  Surplus structures and use or sale of timber, sand, or stone.  In planning the developments, the applicant and the County Supervisor or District Director should, when practicable, plan to use salvage from old buildings, timber, sand, gravel, or stone from the property.  The borrower may sell surplus buildings, timber, sand, gravel, or stone that is not to be used in performing planned development and use net proceeds to pay costs of performing planned development work.  In such a case:

(1)  An agreement will be recorded in the narrative of Form RD 1924-1 which as a minimum will:

(i)  Identify the property to be sold, the estimated net proceeds to be received, and the approximate date by which the property will be sold.

(ii)  Provide that the borrower will deposit the net proceeds in the supervised bank account and apply any funds remaining after the development is complete as an extra payment on the loan, or in accordance with § 1965.13(f) of subpart A of Part 1965 of this chapter for farm program loans.

(2)  The agreement will be considered by the Government as modifying the mortgage contract to the extent of authorizing and requiring the Government to release the identified property subject to the conditions stated in the agreement without payment or other consideration at the time of release, regardless of whether or not the mortgage specifically refers to Form RD 1924-1 or the agreement to release.

(3)  If the RD loan will be secured by a junior lien, all prior lienholders must give written consent to the proposed sale and the use of the net proceeds before the loan is approved.

(4)  Releases requested by the borrower or the buyer will be processed in accordance with applicable release procedures 7 CFR part 3550, as appropriate.  (Revised 01-23-03, SPECIAL PN.)

(h)  Review prior to performing development work.  For the sole benefit of the Agency, prior to beginning development work, the County Supervisor or District Director will review planned development with the borrower.  Adequacy of the drawings and specifications as well as the estimates will be checked to make sure the work can be completed within the time limits previously agreed upon and with available bids.  Items and quantities of any materials the borrower has agreed to furnish will be checked and dates by which each item of development should be started will be checked in order that the work may be completed on schedule.  If any changes in the plans and specifications are proposed, they should be within the general scope of the work as originally planned.  Changes must be approved and processed in accordance with §1924.10 of this subpart.  The appropriate procedure for performing development should be explained to the borrower.  Copies of FmHA forms that will be used during the period of construction should be given to the borrower.  The borrower should be advised as to the purpose of each form and at that period during construction each form will be used.

(C)  The applicant requests a surety bond.

(D)  The contract provides for partial payments in excess of the mount of 60 percent of the value of the work in place.

(E)  The contract provides for partial payments for materials suitably stored on the site.

(ii)  If surety bonds are required the construction contract must indicate that the contractor will furnish properly executed surety bonds prior to the start of any work.  Exhibits F and G of this subpart as revised by OGC if necessary to comply with local or state statutory requirements will be used as the forms of payment bond and performance bond to be provided.  Unless noncorporate surety is provided, the surety bonds may only be obtained from a corporate bonding company listed on the current Department of the Treasury Circular 570 (published annually in the Federal Register), as holding a certificate of authority as an acceptable surety on Federal bonds and as legally doing business in the State where the land is located.  Noncorporate sureties are not recommended and the State Director will be responsible for determining the acceptability of the individual or individuals proposed as sureties on the bonds.  The State Director must determine that an individual or individuals proposed as sureties must have cash or other liquid assets easily convertible to cash in an amount at least equal to 25 percent more than the contract amount in order to be acceptable.  The individual(s) will pledge such liquid assets in an mount equal to the contract amount.  Fees charged for noncorporate sureties may nor exceed fees charged by corporate sureties on bonds of equal amount and, in no case, may surety be provided by the applicant or any person or organization with an identity of interest in the applicant's operation.

If the applicant's request is reasonable and justified, and if the proposed contractor is reliable and experienced in the construction of projects of similar size, design, scope, and complexity, the State Director may grant an exception to the surety requirements for loans or grants within the State Director's approval authority and accept one or a combination of the following:

(A)  An unconditional and irrevocable letter of credit issued by a lending institution which has been reviewed and approved by OGC.  In such cases, the construction contract must indicate that the contractor will furnish a properly executed letter of credit from a lending institution acceptable to Rural Development prior to the start of any work.  The letter of credit must retain in effect until the date of final acceptance of work by the owner and Rural Development.  In addition, the letter of credit must stipulate that the lending institution, upon written notification by Rural Development of the contractor's failure to perform under the terms of the contract, will advance rounds up to the amount of the contract (including all Rural Development approved contract change orders) to satisfy all prior debts incurred by the contractor in performing the contract and all funds necessary to complete the work.  Payments may be made to the contractor in accordance with paragraph (a) (12) (i) (C) of this section as if full surety bonds were being provided.

(B)  If a letter of credit satisfying the conditions of paragraph (A) cannot be obtained, the State Director may accept a deposit in the amount of the contract, into an interest or non-interest bearing supervised bank account.  In such cases, the construction contract must indicate that the contractor will furnish the required deposit prior to the start of any work and that the funds shall remain on deposit until final acceptance of work by the owner and Rural Development.  Payments may be made to the contractor in accordance with paragraph (a) (12) (i) (C) of this section as if full surety bonds were being provided.

(C)  When the provisions of paragraphs (a) (3) (iii) (A) or (B) of this section can be met except that a surety bond, a letter of credit, and/or deposits are not obtainable in full amount of the contract, the State Director may accept an amount less than the full amount of the contract provided all of the following conditions are met:

(5-12-87)  SPECIAL PN

RD Instruction 1924-A
§1924.6 (a) (3) (iii) (C) (Con.)


(1)  The contractor provides a surety bond, a letter of credit, or deposits in the greatest amount possible, and provides documentation indicating the reasons why amounts exceeding the proposed amount cannot be provided.

(2)  The applicant agrees to the amount of the surety bond, letter of credit, or deposits proposed, and the State Director determines that the applicant has the financial capability to withstand any financial loss due to default of the contractor.

(3)  In the opinion of the State Director, the proposed amount and the method of payment will provide adequate protection for the borrower and the Government against default of the contractor.

(4)  The contract provides for partial payments not to exceed 90 percent of the value of the work in place for that portion of the total contract which is guaranteed by an acceptable surety bond, letter of credit, or deposits, and partial payments not to exceed 60 percent of the value of the work in place for that portion of the total contract which is not guaranteed by surety, letter of credit, or deposits.

Example:

Contractor has a surety bond which guarantees payment and performance in an amount of $150,000 which represents 75 percent of the total contract amount of $200,000.  The contractor's first request for payment appears thus:

-  value of work in place is $10,000.

-  payment for work guaranteed by surety= 
   75 percent x $10,000 x 90 percent    = $6,750

-  Payment for work not guaranteed by surety=
   25 percent x $10,000 x 60 percent    = $1,500

-  Authorized payment                   = $8,250

(iv)  In cases where the contractor does not obtain payment and performance bonds in accordance with the surety requirements of paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section, or where an exception to the surety requirements is granted by the State Director, the following steps will be taken to protect the borrower and the government against latent obligations or defects in connection with the construction:  (Revised 
10-30-96, PN 267.)

(A)  The contractor will furnish a properly executed corporate latent defects bond or a maintenance bond in the amount of 10 percent of the construction contract; or

(B)  An unconditional and irrevocable letter of credit in the amount of 10 percent of the construction contract issued by a lending institution which has been reviewed and approved by OGC; or

(C)  A cash deposit into an interest or non-interest bearing supervised bank account in the amount of 10 percent of the construction contract;

(D)  The period of protection against latent obligations and/or defects shall be one year from the date of final acceptance of work by the owner and RHS;

(E)  Final payment shall not be rendered to the contractor until the provisions of paragraphs (a)(3)(iv)(A), (B) or (C) of this section have been met;

(F)  The contract will contain a clause indicating that the contractor agrees to provide surety or guarantee acceptable to the owner and RHS against latent obligations and/or defects in connection with the construction.

(4)  Equal Opportunity.  Section 1901.205 of subpart E of part 1901 of this chapter applies to all loans or grants involving construction contracts and subcontracts in excess of $10,000.

(5)  Labor Standards Provisions.  The provisions of the Davis-Bacon and other related Acts, which are published in the Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR, parts 1, 3 and 5), will apply when the contract involves either LH grant assistance, or 9 or more units in a project being assisted under the HUD Section 8 housing assistance

The contract should contain provisions obligating the contractor as a condition for the award of the contract as follows:

(i)  To notify the owner of the receipt of any communication from Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) indicating that a facility to be utilized in the performance of the contract is under consideration to be listed on the EPA list of Violating Facilities.  Prompt notification is required prior to contract award.

(ii)  To certify that any facility to be utilized in the performance of any nonexempt contractor subcontract is not listed on the EPA list of Violating Facilities as of the date of contract award.

(iii)  To include or cause to be included the above criteria and requirements of paragraphs (a)(7)(i) and (ii) of this section in every nonexempt subcontract, and that the contractor will take such action as the Government may direct as a means of enforcing such provisions.

(8)  Architectural barriers.  In accordance with the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, (Pub. L. 90-480) as implemented by the General Services Administration regulations (41 CFR 101-19.6) and section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Pub.

(ii)  When a price has already been negotiated or an applicant and a contractor, the County Supervisor, District Director or other appropriate Rural Development official will review the proposed contract.  If the contractor is qualified to perform the development and provide a warranty of the work and the price compares favorably with the cost of similar construction in the area, further negotiation is unnecessary.  If the Rural Development official determines the price is too high or otherwise unreasonable, the applicant will be requested to negotiate further with the contractor.  If a reasonable price cannot be negotiated or if the contractor is not qualified, the applicant will be requested to obtain competitive bids.

(iii)  When an applicant has a proposed development plan and no contractor in mind, competitive bidding will be encouraged.  The applicant should obtain bids from as many qualified contractors, dealers or tradespeople as feasible depending on the method and type of construction.

(iv)  If the award of the contract is by competitive bidding, Form RD 1924-5, "Invitation for Bid (Construction Contract)," or another similar invitation bid form containing the requirements of Subpart E of Part 1901 of this chapter, may be used.  All contractors from whom bids are requested should be informed of all conditions of the contract including the time and place of opening bids.  Conditions shall not be established which would give preference to a specific bidder or type of bidder.  When applicable, copies of Forms RD 1924-6 and RD 400-6, "Compliance Statement," also should be provided to the prospective bidders.

(11)  Awarding the contract.  The borrower, with the assistance of the County Supervisor or District Director, will consider the amount of the bids or proposals, and all conditions which were listed in the "Invitation for Bid."  On the basis of these considerations, the borrower will select and notify the lowest responsible bidder.

(D)  The "Partial payments which reflect the portions of the contract amount which is guaranteed" method will be used when the contractor provides surety bonds, a letter of credit, or deposits less than the total amount of the contract in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (a)(3)(iii)(C) of this section.

(ii)  When Form RD 1924-6 is used, the appropriate payment clause will be checked and the other payment clauses not used will be effectively crossed out.

(iii)  When a contract form other than Form RD 1924-6 is used, the payment clause must conform with paragraph (a) (12)(i) of this section and the appropriate clause as set forth in Form RD 1924-6.

(iv)  The borrower and Rural Development must take precautionary measures to see that all payments made to the contractor are properly applied against bills for materials and labor procured under the contract.  Prior to making any partial payment on any contract where a surety bond is not used, the contractor will be required to furnish the borrower and the Rural Development with a statement showing the total amount owed to date for materials and labor procured under the contract.  The contractor also may be required to submit evidence showing that previous partial payments were applied properly.  When the borrower and the County supervisor or District Director have reason to believe that partial payments may not be applied properly, checks may be made jointly to the contractor and persons who furnished materials and labor in connection with the contract.

(v)  When partial payments are requested of the contractor and approved by the owner, the amount of the partial payment will be determined by one of the following methods:

(A)  Based upon the percentage completed as shown on a recently completed and properly executed Form RD 1924-12, "Inspection Report."

(B)  When the structure will be covered by an insured 10-year warranty, the insurer's construction inspector must provide Rural Development with any available copies of instruction reports showing percentage of completion immediately after the inspections are completed.  To make partial payments when copies of inspection reports are not available, the responsible Rural Development official will make the inspections or will be guided by the provisions of §1924.6 (a) (12) (v) (C) of this subpart.  If further assistance is deemed necessary to justify partial payments, the Rural Development official may make onsite inspections or require additional information.

(C)  Based upon an application for payment containing an estimate of the value of work in place which has been prepared by the contractor and accepted by the borrower and Rural Development.  When the contract provides for partial payments for materials satisfactorily stored at the site, the application for payment may include these item.  Prior to receiving the first partial payment, the contractor should be required to submit a list of major subcontractors and suppliers and a schedule of prices or values of the various phases of the work aggregating the total sum of the contract such as excavation, foundations, framing, roofing, siding, mill work, painting, plumbing, heating, electric wiring, etc., made out in such form as agreed upon by the borrower, Rural Development, and the contractor.  In applying for payments, the contractor should submit a statement based upon this schedule.  See Exhibit A of this subpart for guidance in reviewing the contractor's schedule of prices and estimating the value of the work in place.

(vi)  Final payment.

(A)  When the structure will be covered by an insured 10-year warranty, the insurer must provide an insured 10-year warranty policy (or a binder if the policy is not available) before final payment is made to the builder.

RD Instruction 1924-A
§1924.6 (a) (12) (vi) (Con.)


(B)  Final payment of the amount due on the contract or disbursal of the Rural Development loan funds where an interim loan was used will be made only upon completion of the entire contract, final inspection by Rural Development, acceptance of the work by Rural Development and the borrower, issuance of any and all final permits and approvals for the use and occupancy of the structure by any applicable state and local governmental authorities, and compliance by the contractor with all terms and conditions of the contract.  In the event the work of construction is delayed or interrupted by reason of fire, flood, unusually stormy weather, war, riot, strike, an order, requisition or regulation of any governmental body (excluding delays related to possible defects in the contractor's performance and excluding delays caused by the necessity of securing building permits or any required inspection procedures corrected therewith) or other contingencies reasonably unforeseeable and beyond the reasonable control of the contractor, then with the written consent of Rural Development, the date of completion of the work may be extended by the owner by the period of such delay, provided that the contractor shall give the owner and Rural Development written notice within 72 hours of the occurrence of the event causing the delay or interruption.

(C)  Prior to making final payment on the contract when a surety bond is nor used or disbursing the Rural Development loan funds when an interim loan was used, Rural Development will be provided with a Form RD 1924-9, "Certificate of Contractor's Release," and Form RD 1924-10, "Release by Claimants," executed by all persons who furnished materials or labor in connection with the contract.  The borrower should furnish the contractor with a copy of the "Release by Claimants" form at the beginning of the work in order that the contractor may obtain these releases as the work progresses.

(1)  If such releases cannot be obtained, the funds may be disbursed provided all the following can be met:

(i)  Release statements to the extent possible are obtained;

(ii)  The interests of Rural Development can be adequately protected and its security position is not impaired; and

(iii)  Adequate provisions are made for handling the unpaid account by withholding or escrowing sufficient funds to pay any such clams or obtaining a release bond.

(2)  The State Director may issue a State Supplement which will:

(i)  Not require the use of Form RD 1924-10.  If, under existing state statures, the furnishing of labor and materials gives no right to a lien against the property, or

(ii)  Provide an alternative method to protect against mechanic's and materialmen's liens.  In this case, the use of Form RD 1924-10 is optional.

(b)  Borrower method.  The borrower method means performance of work by or under the direction of the borrower, using one or more of the ways specified in this paragraph.  Development work may be performed by the borrower method only when it is not practicable to do the work by the contract method; the borrower possesses or arranges through an approved self-help plan for the necessary skill and managerial ability to complete the work satisfactorily; such work will not interfere seriously with the borrower's farming operation or work schedule, and the County Office caseload will permit a County Supervisor to properly advise the borrower and inspect the work.

(1)   Ways of performing the work.  The borrower will:  

(i)  Purchase the material and equipment and do the work.

(ii)  Utilize lump-sum, agreements for (A) minor items or minor portions of items of development, the total cost of which does not exceed $5,000 per agreement, such as labor, material, or labor and material for small service buildings, repair jobs, or land development; or (B) material and equipment which involve a single trade and will be installed by the seller, such as the purchase and installation of heating facilities, electric wiring, wells, painting, liming, or sodding.  All agreements will be in writing, however, the County Supervisor may make an exception to this requirement when the agreement involves a relatively small amount.

RD Instruction 1924-A
§ 1924.6 (b) (Con.)


(2)  Acceptance and storage of material on site.  The County Supervisor will advise the borrower that the acceptance of material as delivered to the site and the proper storage of material will be the borrower's responsibility.

(3)  Payment for work done by the borrower method.

(i)  Payments for labor.  Before the County Supervisor countersigns checks for labor, the borrower must submit a completed Form RD 1924-11, "Statement of Labor Performed," for each worker performing labor during the pay period.  Ordinarily, checks for labor will be made payable to the workers involved.  However, under justifiable circumstances, when the borrower has paid for labor with personal funds and has obtained signatures of workers on Form RD 1924-11 as having received payment, the County Supervisor may countersign a check made payable to the borrower for reimbursement of these expenditures.  Under no circumstances will the County Supervisor permit loan funds or funds withdrawn from the supervised bank account to be used to pay the borrower for the borrower's own labor or labor performed by any member of the borrower's household.

(ii)  Payments for equipment, material or lump-sum agreements.

(A)  Before countersigning checks for equipment or materials, the County Supervisor must normally have an invoice from the seller covering the equipment or materials to be purchased.  When an invoice is not available at the time the check is issued, an itemized statement of the equipment or materials to be purchased may be substituted until a paid invoice from the seller is submitted, at which time the prepurchase statement may be destroyed.

(B)  When an invoice is available at the time the check is drawn, the check will include a reference to the invoice number, the invoice date if unnumbered and, if necessary, the purpose of the expenditure.

(C)  The check number and date of payment will be indicated on the appropriate Form RD 1924-11, invoice, itemized statement of equipment or materials and/or lump-sum agreement.

§ 1924.6(b)(3)(ii) (Con.)


(D)  Ordinarily, checks for equipment or materials will be made payable to the seller.  Under justifiable circumstances, when the borrower has paid for equipment or materials with personal funds and furnished a paid invoice, the County Supervisor may countersign a check made payable to the borrower for reimbursement of these expenses.

(E)  When an invoice includes equipment or materials for more than one item of development, the appropriate part of the cost to be charged against each item of development will be indicated on the invoice by the borrower, with the assistance of the County Supervisor.

(F)  Payment made under lump-sum agreements will be made only when all items of equipment and materials have been furnished, labor has been performed as agreed upon, and the work has been accepted by the borrower and the Agency.

(G)  Each paid Form RD 1924-11, invoice, itemized statement for equipment or material and/or lump-sum agreement will be given to the borrower in accordance with the FMI.

(c)  Mutual self-help method.  The mutual self-help method is performance of work by a group of families by mutual labor under the direction of a construction supervisor, as described in 7 CFR part 3550.  The ways of doing the work, buying materials, and contracting for special services are like those used for the borrower method.  Materials can be bought jointly by the group of families, but payments will be made individually by each family.  In the case of RH loans to families being assisted by Self-Help Technical Assistance (TA) grants in accordance with subpart I of part 1944 of this chapter, the County Supervisor may countersign checks for materials and necessary contract work made payable directly to the TA grantee, provided the District Director determines that:  (Revised 01-23-03, SPECIAL PN.)

(1)  The grantee acts in the same capacity as a construction manager in the group Purchase of material and services.

(2)  The grantee has an adequate bookkeeping system approved by the District Director to assure that funds in each RH account are properly distributed and maintained.

(e)  Periodic plant inspections will be performed in accordance with paragraphs II and III Exhibit B of this subpart.  Agency employees responsible for inspections in the area in which the manufacturing plant or material supply yard is located will perform such inspections as deemed necessary under paragraph III of Exhibit B of this subpart.

(1)  Plant inspections will be made if the type construction method used could restrict adequate inspections on the building site.

(2)  Plant inspections will be made as often as necessary; however, after initial inspection and acceptance of the unit, only when it appears advisable to ascertain the performance and continuing stability of accepted materials and construction.

(f)  Only one contract will be accepted for the completed house on the site owned or to be bought by the borrower.  The manufacturer of the house or the manufacturer's agent may be the prime contractor for delivery and erection of the house on the site or a builder may contract with the borrower for the complete house in place on the site.  Such contracts should provide that payments will be made only for work in place on the borrower's site.

§ 1924.9  Inspection of development work.

The following policies will govern the inspection of all development work.

(a)  Responsibility for inspection.  The County Supervisor or the District Director, accompanied by the borrower when practicable, will make final inspection of all development work and periodic inspections as appropriate to protect the security interest of the government.  In this respect, inspections other than final inspections, may be conducted by other qualified persons as authorized in paragraph (d) of this section, in 7 CFR part 3550, in RD Instruction 2024-A (available in any Rural Development Office), and as authorized under other agreements executed by, or authorized by, the National Office.  The borrower will be responsible for making inspections necessary to protect the borrower's interest.  Agency inspections are not to assure the borrower that the house is built in accordance with the plans and specifications.  The inspections create or imply no duty or obligation

to the particular borrower.  Agency inspections are for the dual purpose of determining that the Agency has adequate security for its loan and is achieving the statutory goal of providing adequate housing.  If difficult technical problems are encountered, the County Supervisor or District Director should request the assistance of the State Office or a qualified technician from SCS or the State University Cooperative Extension Service.  (Revised 01-23-03, SPECIAL PN.)

(b)  Frequency of inspections.  The County Supervisor or District Director will inspect development work as frequently as necessary to assess that construction and land development conforms to the drawings and specifications.  The final inspection will be made at the earliest possible date after completion of the planned development.  When several major items of development are involved, final inspection will be made upon completion of each item.

(1)  For new buildings and additions to existing buildings, inspections will be made at the following stages of construction and at such other stages of construction as determined by the County Supervisor or District Director except as modified by paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

(i)  Stage 1.  Customarily, the initial inspection in construction cases is made just prior to or during the placement of concrete footings or monolithic footings and floor slabs.  At this point, foundation excavations are complete, forms or trenches and steel are ready for concrete placement and the subsurface installation is roughed in.  However, when it is not practicable to make the initial inspection prior to or during the placement of concrete, the County Supervisor or District Director will make the initial inspection as soon as possible after the placement of concrete and before any backfill is in place.

(ii)  Stage 2.  The Stage 2 inspection will be made when the building is enclosed, structural members are still exposed, roughing in for heating, plumbing, and electrical work is in place and visible, and wall insulation and vapor barriers are installed.  Customarily, this is prior to installation of brick veneer or any interior finish which could include lath, wallboard and finish flooring.

(iii)  Stage 3.  The final inspection will be made when all on-site and off-site development has been completed and the structure is ready for occupancy or its intended use.

(2)  For rehabilitation of existing buildings, inspections will be made in accordance with paragraphs (b)(l)(ii) and (iii) of this section, and at such other stages of construction to assure that construction is being performed in a professional manner and in accordance with the CFSA and/or RHCDS approved drawings and specifications.

(3)  For new construction when the structure will be covered by an insured 10-year warranty plan as described in Exhibit L of this subpart, only the final inspection is required, except in cases when partial payments are required then the provisions of § 1924.6(a)(12)(v) of this subpart will be followed.

(4)  Arrangements should be made to have the borrower join the County Supervisor or the District Director in making periodic inspections as often as necessary to provide a mutual understanding with regard to the progress and performance of the work.

(5)  The borrower should make enough periodic visits to the site to be familiar with the progress and performance of the work, in order to protect the borrower's interest.  If the borrower observes or otherwise becomes aware of any fault or defect in the work or nonconformance with the contract documents, the borrower should give prompt written notice thereof to the contractor with a copy to the County Supervisor or District Director responsible for servicing the type of loan or grant involved.

(6)  The borrower should, when practicable, join the County Supervisor or District Director in making all final inspections.

(7)  When irrigation equipment and materials are to be purchased and installed, a performance test under actual operating conditions by the person or firm making the installation should be required before final acceptance is made.  The test should be conducted in the presence of the borrower, a qualified technician, and, when practicable, the County Supervisor or District Director.  If the CFSA official is not present at the performance test, he or she should request the technician to furnish a report as to whether or not the installation meets the requirements of the plans and specifications.

(c)  Recording inspections and correction of deficiencies.  All periodic and final inspections made by the County Supervisor or District Director will be recorded on Form RD 1924-12 in accordance with the FMI.  The County Supervisor or District Director will be responsible for following up on the correction of deficiencies reported on Form RD 1924-12.  When an architect/ engineer is providing services on a project, the District Director should notify the architect/engineer immediately of any fault or defect observed in the work or of any nonconformment with the contract document.  If the borrower or the contractor refuses to correct the deficiencies, the District Director will report the facts to the State Director who will determine the action to be taken.  No inspection will be recorded as a final inspection until all deficiencies or nonconforming conditions have been corrected.

(d)  Acceptance by responsible public authority.  When local (city) county, state, or other public authority) codes and ordinances require inspections, final acceptance by the local authority having jurisdiction will be required prior to final inspection or acceptance by Rural Development.

(e)  Acceptance by project architect.  If architectural services pursuant to §1924.13 (a) of this subpart have been obtained, final acceptance by the project architect pursuant to §1924.13 (a) (5) (v) of this subpart will be required prior to acceptance by Rural Development.

(2)  Sufficient funds are deposited in the borrower's supervised bank account or with the interim letter, as appropriate, to cover the contemplated changes when the change involves additional funds to be furnished by the borrower.

(3)  The change will not adversely affect the soundness of the operation or Rural Development's security.  If uncertain as to the probable effect the change would have on the soundness of the operation or Rural Development security, the County Supervisor will obtain advice from the District Director on whether to approve the change.

(4)  If a surety bond has been provided on the full amount of the construction contract, the aggregate amount of all contract change orders on Form RD 1924-7, "Contract Change Order," or other acceptable form will not exceed 20 percent of the original contract mount.  Change orders for contracts on which a surety bond has been provided which increases the original contract amount by more than 20 percent may only be approved if additional surety is provided in the full revised amount of the contract.  For purposes of this paragraph, letters of credit and deposits are not considered surety.

(5)  Change orders for contracts on which letters of credit or deposits have been provided on the full amount of the contract which will increase the original contract amount are approved only if additional letters of credit or deposits are provided in the full revised amount of the contract.

(6)  Modifications have been certified in accordance with §1924.5 (f) (1) (iii) or certification has been waived in accordance with §1924.5 (f) (1) (iii) (C) of this subpart.

(a)  Once each year the District Director will make a comprehensive review of all development work not completed within the time scheduled.  For incomplete development financed with loan or grant funds within the responsibility of the District Director, the District Director will take the necessary actions to assure that the borrower or grantee completes the planned development.  For incomplete development financed with loan or grant funds within the responsibility of the County Supervisor, the District Director will give the necessary direction to the County Supervisor to assure completion of the work.  In connection with these responsibilities, the District Director will consider:

(1)  The current farm and home operations with respect to the need for the development as originally planned.

(2)  Revisions to the development plan.

(3)  Funds remaining in the supervised bank account.

(4)  Need for additional funds.

(5)  Personal funds that could be furnished by the borrower.

contract.  The construction costs, as reported on Form RD 1924-13, must also be audited, in accordance with Government Auditing Standards, by a CPA, or LPA licensed on or before December 31, 1970.  In addition, certain agreed upon procedures (available in any Rural Development office) will be performed in accordance with Attestation Standards.  In some cases, Rural Development will contract directly with a CPA or LPA for the cost certification.  In that event, documentation necessary to have the costs of construction certified by an Rural Development contractor that they were the actual costs of the work performed, as reported on Form RD 1924-13, will be provided.  Funds which were included in the loan for cost certification and which are ultimately not needed because Rural Development contracts for the cost certification will be returned on the loan.  Rural Development personnel will utilize Exhibit M of this subpart (available in any Rural Development office) and Form RD 1924-26, "Cost Certification Worksheet," to assist in the evaluation of the cost certification process.  (Revised 03-16-94, SPECIAL PN.) 

(A)  Prior to the start of construction, the borrower, contractor and any subcontractor, material supplier, or equipment lessor sharing an identity of interest must submit, to the CPA or LPA, the accounting system that the borrower, contractor, subcontractor, material supplier, or equipment lessor and/or the CPA or LPA proposes to set up and use in maintaining a running record of the actual cost.  In order to be acceptable, the borrower must provide a written assertion that it has an accounting system that is suitably designed to provide for a trade-item basis comparison of the actual cost as compared to the estimated cost submitted on Form RD 1924-13.  Costs pertaining to a specific line item will be set up in the accounting system for that particular account.  For instance, only costs of materials, supplies, equipment, and labor associated with concrete will be shown in the concrete account.  The accounting system must also restrict costs to those pertaining to a specific project so that costs from multiple projects will not be co-mingled.  The independent CPA or LPA shall report on the borrower's assertion in accordance with the Standards for Attestation Engagements of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA).  The borrower's and the CPA or LPA's reports on the accounting system shall be provided to Rural Development by the borrower.

(B)  Prior to final payment to anyone required to cost certify, a trade-item breakdown showing the actual cost compared to the estimated cost must be provided to the owner and Rural Development.  Form RD 1924-13 is the form of comparative breakdown that must be used, and contains the certifications required of the applicant and contractor prior to final payment.  The amounts for builder's general overhead, builder's profit, and general requirements, respectively, shall not exceed the amounts represented on the estimate of cost breakdown provided in accordance with paragraph (e)(1)(iv) of this section for any contractor, subcontractor, material supplier, or equipment lessor having or sharing an identity of interest with the borrower.  The amounts for general overhead, builder's profit, and general requirements must be estabished prior to Rural Development approving the construction contract and will not be changed during the course of construction.  This applies to all contractors, subcontractors, material suppliers, or equipment lessors having or sharing an identity of interest with the applicant.  Contract change orders will be processed to adjust the contract amount downward prior to the final payment to the contractor, if necessary, to assure that the amounts shown in the certificate of actual costs do not exceed the amounts represented in the contract cost breakdown.  Reduction in the builder's profit, and general overhead if needed, will counterbalance any increase reflected in the contract costs.  Any funds remaining as a result of hard cost savings will be applied to the account as an extra payment or used for eligible loan purposes approved by Rural Development as long as the improvements are genuinely needed and will enhance marketability of the project.  All increases or decreases of 15 percent or more in line item costs will require documentation as to the reason for the increases and/or decreases.  The State Director may require documentation for increases and/or decreases of less than 15 percent, if he/she determines it necessary.  This information will be required with the cost certification.  

(C)  The CPA or LPA audit, performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards, will include such tests of the accounting records and such other auditing procedures of the borrower and the contractor (and any subcontractor, material supplier, or equipment lessor sharing an identity of interest)

concerning the work performed, services rendered, and materials supplied in accordance with the construction contract he/she considers necessary to express an opinion on the construction costs as reported on Form RD 1924-13.  The CPA or LPA shall also perform the additional agreed upon procedures specified by Rural Development (available in any Rural Development office), performed in accordance with Attestation Standards, for the applicant and the contractor (and any subcontractor, material supplier, or equipment lessor sharing an identity of interest) concerning the work performed, services rendered, and materials supplied in accordance with the construction contract.  

(D)  Upon completion of construction and prior to final payment, the CPA or LPA will provide an opinion concerning whether the construction costs, as reported on Form RD 1924-13, present fairly the costs of construction in conformity with eligible construction costs as prescribed in  Rural Development regulations.  

(E)  In some cases, cost certification will be obtained by Rural Development through direct contract with the CPA or LPA.  The borrower and his/her CPA or LPA will cooperate fully with the contract CPA or LPA by providing all documentation necessary to conduct the certification.  Rural Development reserves the right to determine, upon receipt of the certified Form RD 1924-13 and the auditor's report, whether they are satisfactory to Rural Development.  If not satisfactory to Rural Development, the borrower will be responsible for providing additional information.  

(F)  There will exist no business relationship between the CPA or LPA and the borrower except for the performance of the examination of the cost certification, accounting systems work, and tax preparation.  Any CPA or LPA who acts as the borrower's accountant (performing manual or automated bookkeeping services or maintains the official accounting records) will not be the same CPA or LPA who cost certifies the project.  

(G)  Forms RD 1944-30, "Identity of Interest (IOI) Disclosure Certificate" and RD 1944-31, "Identity of Interest (IOI) Qualification Form," provide written notification to the borrower that willful and intentional falsification of cost certification documents will result in debarment of all violators

RD Instruction 1924-A
§1924.13 (e)(1)(v)(G) (Con.)


in accordance with the provisions of RD Instruction 1940-M (available in any Rural Development office).  These forms require the disclosure of all identities of interest associated with project construction, certify the entity's ability to provide the contracted service, and cite the penalties for failure to disclose or falsify such certification.  Each applicant/borrower will be required to complete and sign the forms (available in any Rural Development office).  

(H)  Subcontracting development work.  

(1)  Contractors will not be allowed to obtain a profit and overhead unless they are performing actual construction.  "Actual construction" means "work" as defined in American Institute of Architects (AIA) documents:  "... labor, materials, equipment, and services provided by the contractor to fulfill the contractor's obligations."  Under this definition, contractors who choose to subcontract out construction of the project to another contractor will not obtain a builder's fee (general overhead and profit) when:  

(i)  More than 50 percent of the contract sum in the construction contract is subcontracted to one subcontractor, material supplier, or equipment lessor, and/or

(ii)  Seventy-five percent or more with three or fewer subcontractors, material suppliers, and/or equipment lessors.  

(2)  Note:  If two or more subcontractors have common ownership, they are considered as one subcontractor.  

(3)  How to apply rule:

(i)  The 50 percent rule will apply when division of the amount of the largest subcontract by the contract sum of the construction contract results in more than 50 percent.

(ii)  The 75 percent rule will apply when division of the sum of the amounts of the three largest subcontracts by the contract sum of the construction contract results in 75 percent or more.  

(I)  Qualified contracting entities.  Contractors, subcontractors, material suppliers, and any other individual or organization sharing an identity of interest and providing materials or services for the project must certify that it is a viable, ongoing trade or business qualified and properly licensed to undertake the work for which it intends to contract.  Form RD 1944-31 will be prepared and executed by the contracting entities.  The form provides notification to the entities of the penalty, under law, for erroneously certifying to the statements contained therein.  Debarment actions will be instituted against entities who fail to disclose an identity of interest in accordance with the provisions of RD Instruction 1940-M (available in any Rural Development office).   

(vi)  Method of payments.  Partial payments may be requested in accordance with the terms of the construction contract on Form RD 1924-18, "Partial Payment Estimate," or other professionally recognized form that contains the architect's certification, approval of the owner, and conditional acceptable of Rural Development as shown in Form RD 1924-18.  

(A)  If interim financing is available at reasonable rates and terms for the construction period, such financing shall be obtained.  Exhibit B of Subpart E of Part 1944 of this chapter shall be used to inform the interim lender that Rural Development will not close its loan until the project is substantially complete, ready for occupancy, evidence is furnished indicating that all bills  have been paid or will be paid at loan closing for work completed on the project, all inspections have been completed and all required approvals have been obtained from municipal and governmental authorities having jurisdiction over the project.  Upon presentation of proper partial payment estimates approved by the applicant and accepted by Rural Development, the interim lender may advance construction funds in accordance with the payment terms of the contract.  It is suggested that partial payments not exceed 90 percent of the value of work in place and materials suitably stored on site.  (Revised 2-25-88, SPECIAL PN.)

(B)  When interim financing is not available, payments will be made in accordance with §1924.6(a)(12) of this subpart. 

(vii)  Exception to competitive bidding.

(A)  For all applicants.  An applicant may negotiate a construction contract provided the State Director grants an exception and documentation shows that:  

(1)  The contract price is competitive with other projects similar in construction and design being built in the area. 

(2)  The proposed contractor is experienced in construction of projects of similar size, scope, and complexity, and is recognized as a reliable builder.  

(3)  The proposed development work meets all requirements of this subpart. 

(4)  If appropriate for nonprofit organizations and public bodies, the application provides a copy of a duly authorized resolution by its governing body requesting Rural Development to permit awarding the construction contract without formal bidding. 

(5)  The applicant is permitted by state law, local law and/or organizational by-laws to negotiate a construction contract.  

(6)  The requirements of paragraphs (e)(1)(ii), (iii), (iv) and (v) of this section are met. 

(B)  In considering an exception to competitive bidding, the following additional steps will be taken in all cases. 

(1)  If, after a full review of the case documents by the appropriate members of the State Office staff, the State Director determines that the requirements have been met and the costs are reasonable, an exception to competitive bidding may be granted.  Written documentation of the State Office review results will be placed in the application file.

(2)  If after the full review by the State Office staff, the State Director determines that the negotiated contract price is not competitive with other similar projects in construction and design being built in the area, the applicant will be requested to competitively bid the construction of the project in accordance with paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section. 

(3)  If there is no agreement by Rural Development and the applicant as to the construction cost, the State Director will cease any further action on the preapplication and inform the applicant of the right to appeal in accordance with Subpart B of Part 1900 of this chapter. 

(C)  Any requests for exceptions to competitive bidding that are not covered in this section may be submitted to the National Office for consideration.  

(viii)  Exception to contract method - public body.  With the approval of the National Office, the State Director may grant to a public body an exception to the requirement for using contract method construction under the following circumstances:  

(A)  The loan or grant is for repair or rehabilitation of existing facilities and it is not practicable to perform all work by the contract method. 

(B)  The applicant has the managerial ability and qualified employees necessary to complete the work successfully. 

(C)  The applicant submits a written request to the District Director indicating:

(1)  The scope of work and construction timetable;

(7)  Proposed method of certifying progress and requesting payments. 

(D)  The request, recommendations of the District Director, appropriate members of the State Office staff and the State Director and the application file will be sent to the National office. 

(2)  Owner-builder method.  This method of development is used only when requested by profit or limited profit RRH applicants when the applicant or any of its controlling principals (such as stockholders, members, partners other than limited partners, directors, or officers), are general contractors by profession, and will serve as the builder of the project without a written construction contract.  The State Director may make an exception to the contract method of construction and authorize proceeding by the owner-builder method of construction in accordance with the provisions of this section if the amount of the loan(s) does not exceed the State Director's approval authority.  For projects over the State Director's authority, prior written consent of the National office is required.  In such cases, the drawings, specifications, cost estimates, copy of the State Architect/Engineer's review and detailed information on the applicant's qualifications will be submitted to the National Office along with the State Director's recommendations. 

(i)  The applicant's request to construct a project by the owner-builder method of construction shall be in the form of a letter giving specific and detailed information concerning the owner-builder's proposal, and the qualifications and past experience of the owner-builder.  The following information must be included with the request:  

(A)  A resume indicating the owner-builder's history, ability, and experience.  

(B)  Dated and signed financial statements on the owner-builder's operation (including balance sheets and statements of income and expense) from current and prior years indicating the payment status of the owner-builder's accounts and any contingent

liabilities that may exist.  Rural Development personnel will be responsible for analyzing the financial statement as to the sufficiency of the owner-builder's financial capability to carry out construction.  The financial strength must demonstrate the ability of the owner-builder to pay all bills prior to receiving periodic draws of funds from the lender.  (Revised 03-16-94, SPECIAL PN.)

(C)  A written, dated, and signed statement agreeing to provide any funds necessary in excess of the applicant's contribution and the loan amount to complete the project. 

(D)  A credit report (obtained at no expense to Rural Development) attesting to the owner-builder's credit standing.  

(E)  A listing of trade references that could be contacted to substantiate the owner-builder's experience and good standing. 

(F)  Statements from other persons for whom the 
owner-builder has done similar work, indicating the scope of the work and that person's evaluation of the owner-builder's performance. 

(G)  A current, dated, and signed trade-item cost breakdown of the estimated total development cost of the project which has been prepared by the applicant/owner-builder.  Form RD 1924-13 will be used for this purpose.  If cost certification services are required by Rural Development, the cost of such services may be included in the total development cost of the project.  Any subcontractor, material supplier, or equipment lessor sharing an identity of interest with the applicant/owner-builder as defined in §1924.4 (i) of this subpart must also provide a trade-item cost breakdown of the proposed amount.  (Revised 03-16-94, SPECIAL PN.)

(H)  Prior to the start of construction, the owner-builder and any subcontractor, material supplier, or equipment lessor sharing an identity of interest must submit, to the CPA or LPA, the accounting system that the owner-builder, subcontractor, material supplier, or equipment lessor and/or the CPA or LPA proposes to set up and use in maintaining a running record of the actual cost.  In order to be acceptable, the owner-builder must provide a written assertion that it has

RD Instruction 1924-A
§1924.13 (e)(2)(i)(H) (Con.) 


an accounting system that is suitably designed to provide for a trade-item basis comparison of the actual cost as compared to the estimated cost submitted on Form RD 1924-13.  Costs pertaining to a specific line item will be set up in the accounting system for that particular account.  For instance, only costs of materials, supplies, equipment, and labor associated with concrete will be shown in the concrete account.  The accounting system must also restrict costs to those pertaining to a specific project so that costs from multiple projects will not be co-mingled.  The independent CPA or LPA shall report on the owner-builder's assertion in accordance with the Standards for Attestation Engagements of the AICPA.  The owner-builder's and the CPA or LPA's reports on the accounting system shall be provided to Rural Development by the owner-builder.  (Revised 03-16-94, SPECIAL PN.)

(I)  A written, dated, and signed statement agreeing to permit U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their duly authorized representatives, to have access to any books, documents, papers, and records which are directly pertinent to the specific Federal program for the purpose of making audit, examination, excerpts and transcriptions.  

(ii)  In order to grant an exception to the contract method of construction and proceed with the owner-builder method of construction, the State Director must determine that the following conditions exist: 

(A)  The applicant or at least one of its principals is a fully qualified and licensed (if necessary under applicable local law) builder by profession, has adequate experience in constructing the type of units proposed as well as projects of similar size, scope, and complexity and will be able to complete the work in accordance with the Rural Development approved drawings and specifications.  

(B)  Based upon the information presented in the applicant's financial statements, the applicant is presently able and is likely to continue to be able to provide any funds necessary in excess of the applicant's contribution and the loan amount to complete the project.

(C)  The total development cost of the project does not exceed that which is typical for similar type projects in the area.  The total development cost recognized by Rural Development for each individual case will be determined by the MFH Coordinator with the advice of the State Architect.  (Revised 03-16-94, SPECIAL PN.)

(D)  The owner-builder has provided sufficient information on all contracts or subcontracts in excess of $10,000 to permit compliance with §1924.6 (a)(11)(iv) of this subpart. 

(iii)  In addition to the requirements for the State Director to authorize the owner-builder method of construction as indicated in §1924.13 (e)(2)(i) and (ii) of this subpart, the following additional steps will be taken by the State Director. 

(A)  If, after a full review of the case documents by the appropriate members of the State Office staff, the State Director determines that the requirements have been met and the construction cost is reasonable, an exception to competitive bidding may be granted.  Written documentation of the State Office review results will be placed in the application file.  
(Revised 03-16-94, SPECIAL PN.)

(B)  If, after the full review by the State Office staff, the State Director determines that the construction cost is not competitive with other similar projects in construction and design being built in the area, the applicant will be requested to competitively bid the construction of the project in accordance with paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section. 

(C)  If there is no agreement by Rural Development and the applicant as to construction cost and the applicant is not agreeable to any of the aforementioned alternatives, the State Director will cease any further action on the preapplication and inform the applicant of the right to appeal, in accordance with Subpart B of Part 1900 of this chapter. 

(iv)  The development cost of the project may include a typical allowance for general overhead, general requirements and a builder's profit.  These amounts may be determined by local investigation and also from HUD data 

64
(Revision 2)

RD Instruction 1924-A

for the area.  The applicant/owner-builder and any subcontractors, material suppliers, and equipment lessors having or sharing an identity of interest with the applicant/owner-builder may not be permitted a builder's profit, general overhead, and general requirements which exceed the amounts represented on their cost breakdown.  (Revised 03-16-94, SPECIAL PN.)

(v)  Under no circumstances will loan funds be used to pay the owner-builder or its stockholders, members, directors or officers, directly or indirectly, any profits from the construction of the project except a typical builder's fee for performing the services that would normally be performed by a general contractor under the contract method of construction.  Discounts and rebates given the owner-builder in advance must be deducted before the invoices are paid.  If discounts or rebates are given after the invoices are paid, the funds must be returned to the supervised bank account or applied on the interim construction loan, as appropriate.   Under no circumstances will the dollar amount be placed in the reserve account.  (Revised 03-16-94, SPECIAL PN.)

(vi)  The plans and specifications must be specific and complete so that there is a clear understanding as to how the facility will be constructed and the materials that will be used. 

(vii)  When architectural services are required by §1924.13(a) during the construction and warranty phases they must be provided by an architect who has no identity of interest with the applicant/owner-builder.  The services to be rendered during the construction and warranty phases include, but are not limited to inspections, changes in the scope of project or work to be done, administration of construction accounts, rejection of work and materials not conforming to the Rural Development approved drawings and specifications, and other appropriate service listed in §1924.13 (a)(5)(v) and (vi) of this subpart.  

(viii)  The applicant/owner-builder and any subcontractor, material supplier, or equipment lessor sharing an identity of interest as defined in §1924.4 (i) of this subpart must each provide certification as to the actual cost of the work performed in connection with the construction of the project on Form RD 1924-13 prior to final payment.  The construction costs, as reported on Form RD 1924-13, must be audited by a CPA, or LPA licensed on or before

December 31, 1970, in accordance with Government Auditing Standards, and certain agreed upon procedures (available in any Rural Development office) performed in accordance with Attestation Standards.  In some cases, Rural Development will contract directly with a CPA or LPA for the cost certification.  In that event, documentation necessary to have the costs of construction certified by an Rural Development contractor that they were the actual costs of the work performed, as reported on Form RD 1924-13, will be provided.  Funds which were included in the loan for cost certification and which are ultimately not needed because Rural Development contracts for the cost certification will be returned on the loan.  (Revised 03-16-94, SPECIAL PN.)

(A)  The CPA or LPA's audit, performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards, will include such tests of the accounting records and such other auditing procedures of the applicant/owner-builder (and any subcontractor, material supplier, or equipment lessor sharing an identity of interest) concerning the work performed, services rendered, and materials supplied in connection with the construction of the project he/she considers necessary to express an opinion on the construction costs as reported on Form RD 1924-13.  Upon completion of construction and prior to final payment, the CPA or LPA will provide an opinion as to whether the construction costs as reported on Form RD 1924-13 present fairly the costs of construction in conformity with eligible construction costs as prescribed in Rural Development regulations.  Rural Development reserves the right to determine, upon receipt of the certified Form RD 1924-13 and the auditor's report, whether they are satisfactory to Rural Development.  At a minimum, the CPA or LPA shall also perform any additional agreed upon procedures (available in any Rural Development office) specified by Rural Development, performed in accordance with Attestation Standards, of the owner-builder (and any subcontractor, material supplier, or equipment lessor sharing an identity of interest) concerning the work performed, services rendered, and materials supplied in connection with the construction.  There will exist no business relationship between the CPA or LPA and the borrower except for the performance of the examination of the cost certification, accounting systems work, and tax preparation.  Any CPA or LPA who acts as the borrower's accountant (performing manual or automated bookkeeping services or maintains the official accounting records) will not be the same CPA or LPA who cost certifies the project.

(B)  Prior to final payment to anyone required to cost certify, Rural Development must be provided with a certification and a trade-item breakdown showing the actual cost compared to the estimated cost furnished in accordance with paragraph (e)(2)(i)(G) of this section.  Form RD 1924-13 is the form of comparative breakdown that must be used, and contains the certification required of the applicant/owner-builder prior to final payment.  The amounts for builder's general overhead, general requirements, and builder's profit shall not exceed the amounts represented on the estimate of cost breakdown provided in accordance with paragraph (e)(2)(i)(G) of this section for the owner-builder or any subcontractor, material supplier, or equipment lessor having or sharing an identity of interest with the applicant/owner-builder.  Final payment to the owner-builder will be adjusted, if necessary, to assure that the amounts shown on the certificate of actual cost do not exceed the amounts represented on the cost breakdown.  Any funds remaining as a result of hard cost savings will be applied to the account as an extra payment or used for eligible loan purposes approved by Rural Development as long as the improvements are genuinely needed and will enhance marketability of the project.  All increases or decreases of 15 percent or more in line item costs will require documentation as to the reason for the increases or decreases.  The State Director may require documentation for increases or decreases of less than 15 percent, if he/she determines it necessary.  This information will be required with the cost certification.  

(C)  Subcontracting development work.  

(1)  Owner-builders will not be allowed to obtain a profit and overhead unless they are performing actual construction.  "Actual construction" means "work" as defined in AIA documents:  "... labor, materials, equipment, and services provided by the contractor to fulfill the contractor's obligations."  Under this definition, owner-builders who choose to subcontract out construction of the project to another contractor will not obtain a builder's fee (general overhead and profit) when:

(ii)  Seventy-five percent or more with three or fewer subcontractors, material suppliers, and/or equipment lessors.  

(2)  Note:  If two or more subcontractors have common ownership, they are considered as one subcontractor.  

(3)  How to apply rule:

(i)  The 50 percent rule will apply when division of the amount of the largest subcontract by the total amount of the building cost results in more than 50 percent. 

(ii)  The 75 percent rule will apply when division of the sum of the amounts of the three largest subcontracts by the total building cost results in 75 percent or more.  

(D)  Qualified contracting entities.  Contractors, subcontractors, material suppliers, and any other individual or organization sharing an identity of interest and providing materials or services for the project must certify that it is a viable, ongoing trade or business qualified and properly licensed to undertake the work for which it intends to contract.  Form RD 1944-31 will be prepared and executed by the contracting entities.  The form provides notification to the entities of the penalty, under law, for erroneously certifying to the statements contained therein.  Debarment actions will be instituted against entities who fail to disclose an identity of interest in accordance with the provisions of RD Instruction 1940-M (available in any Rural Development office).

(ix)  Requests for payment for work performed by the owner-builder method, shall be submitted to the Rural Development District Director for review and approval prior to each advance of funds in order to insure that funds are used for authorized purposes.  Requests for payment shall be made on Form RD 1924-18 or other professionally recognized form containing the following certifications to Rural Development:

until the project is complete, ready for occupancy, evidence is furnished indicating that all bills have been paid for work completed on the project, all inspections have been completed and all required approvals have been obtained from any governmental authorities having jurisdiction over the project.  Upon presentation of proper payment estimates containing an estimate of the value of work in place which has been prepared and executed by the owner-builder, certified by the applicant's architect, and accepted by Rural Development, the interim lender may advance construction funds in accordance with the provisions of this section.  It is suggested that the partial payment not exceed 90 percent of the value of work in place and material suitably stored on site.  (Revised 2-25-88, SPECIAL PN.)

(B)  If interim financing is not available, partial payments not to exceed 90 percent of the value of work in place and materials suitably stored on site may be made to the owner-builder for that portion of the estimated cost of development guaranteed by a letter of credit or deposits meeting the requirements of §1924.6 (a)(3)(iii)(A), (B), or (C) of this subpart.  Partial payments may not exceed 60 percent of the value of work in place in all other cases.  The determination of the value of work in place will be based upon an application for payment containing an estimate of the value of work in place which has been prepared and executed by the owner-builder, certified by the borrower's architect, and accepted by Rural Development.  Prior to receiving the first partial payment, the owner-builder must submit a schedule or prices or values of the various trades or phases of the work aggregating the total development cost of the project as required in §1924.13 (e)(2)(i)(G) and (H) of this subpart.  Each application for payment must be based upon this schedule, and show the total amount owed and paid to date for materials and labor procured in connection with the project.  With each application for payment, the owner-builder must also submit evidence showing how the requested partial payment is to be applied, evidence showing that previous partial payments were properly applied, and a signed statement from the applicant's attorney, title insurance company, or local official in charge of recording

REQUIREMENTS FOR MODULAR/PANELIZED HOUSING UNITS

For the benefit of Rural Development this Exhibit prescribes evaluation, acceptance, inspection and certification procedures for modular/panelized housing units proposed for use in Rural Development Rural Housing programs.  It applies to proposed development packages provided either under a contract between an Rural Development borrower and a single contractor or under a conditional commitment.  This Exhibit also describes the use of background information available through the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for analysis of manufactured products.  This Exhibit also applies to the evaluation of manufactured farm service buildings in paragraph XI, below.  For the purpose of this Exhibit, County Supervisor and County Office also mean District Director and District Office, respectively.

I.  Applicable Standards and Manuals.

A.  The HUD Handbook 4950.1, Technical Suitability of Products Program Technical and Processing Procedures, must be followed by housing manufacturers to obtain acceptance of their products.  Acceptance documents issued by HUD include:  Structural Engineering Bulletins (SEB) on a national basis, Area Letters of Acceptance (ALA) which when accepted by all Area HUD Offices in a HUD region will, in essence, become Regional Letters of Acceptance (RLA), Truss Connector Bulletins (TCB): and, Mechanical engineering Bulletins MEB).  These documents as well as the Use of Material Bulletins (UM) and Materials Release Bulletins (MR) are addendum to the HUD Minimum Property Standards (MPS).  Under handbook guidelines, HUD also examines state agency regulations concerning design, construction and labeling of modular/panelized housing units and designates those states having procedures acceptable for use under HUD programs.  Modular/panelized housing produced in these states is called Category III and is considered technically suitable for use without further structural analysis.

B.  All State Rural Development Offices should maintain a close working relationship with each HUD office in their jurisdiction to assure coordination.  Any deviations in structure, materials or design from HUD acceptance documents must comply with one of the other applicable development standards.

II.  Modular Housing Units that Require Factory Inspections.

Only those types which cannot be completely inspected on site are required to obtain acceptance from HUD.  Those that receive acceptance will be periodically factory inspected by HUD or HUD's designated agency, usually about every 6 months.

(5-12-87)  SPECIAL PN

RD Instruction 1924-A
Exhibit B
Page 2


III. Panelized Housing Units that Do Not Require Factory Inspections.

A.  Housing completely assembled on the building site does not require HUD acceptance.  This includes housing that is manufactured but is assembled on the site such as:  Precut pieces, log wall houses, trussed roof rafters or floor trusses; open panel walls, and other types that can be completely inspected on site.
B.  Housing that is assembled in local materials dealers' yards for moving to local sites and to be purchased by an Rural Development applicant, will be inspected during construction in the yard by the local Rural Development County representative.  These units must be constructed according to the applicable development standard and not transported out of the local Rural Development County Office jurisdiction.  The inspection must be recorded on Form RD 1924-12 "Inspection Report."

IV. Manufacturer's Actions Required for Submissions to Rural Development are listed in Attachment 1 to this Exhibit B.

V.  State Rural Development office Actions when Manufacturing Facilities are in its Jurisdiction.  The State Office, upon receipt of manufacturer's submission, must:

A.  Determine that the unit structural system has been accepted by HUD as appropriate under HUD Handbook 4950.1 requirements.
B.  Review the thermal characteristics and approach of the calculations to determine actions to be taken in compliance with paragraph IV C of Exhibit D of this subpart.
C.  Review the proposal for compliance with §1924.5 (d) (1) of this subpart.
D.  Determine that the prerequisites for consideration of acceptance by Rural Development are met.  The prerequisites include all of the following:

1.  A current acceptance document from HUD (SEB, RLA, ALA),  Except for Category III housing modular/panelized housing that does not have to have a Structural Engineering Bulletin as designated by HUD).  In Category III states, the state government requirements for manufactured housing must be followed.

2.  A current HUD Factory Inspection Report, Form No. 2051m, or in the case of Category iii housing, a copy of the inspection report from the state government or accepted third party performing the factory inspection.  Each report must be made by HUD or a HUD authorized agency, and must be no older than 6 months.

3.  A letter from the manufacturer requesting a review for acceptance.  Enclosed with the letter shall be all the information listed in Attachment 1 to this Exhibit B.

RD instruction 1924-A

THERMAL PERFORMANCE
CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS

I.	PURPOSE:  This Exhibit prescribes thermal performance construction standards to be used in all housing loan and grant programs.  These requirements shall supersede the thermal performance requirements in any of the development standards in § 1924.4(h) of this subpart.

II.	POLICY:  All loan or grant applications involving new construction (except for new Single Family Housing (SFH)) and all applications for conditional commitments (except for new SFH) shall have drawings and specifications prepared to comply with paragraphs IV A or C and IV D of this Exhibit.  All new SFH construction shall have drawing and specifications prepared to comply with paragraph IV F of this Exhibit.  

III.  DEFINITIONS:

A.  British thermal unit (Btu) means the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound (.4535 KM.) of water by one degree Fahrenheit (F).  For example, one Btu is the amount of heat needed 
to raise the temperature of one pound of water from 59 degrees F to 60 degrees F.

B.  Glazing is the material set into a sash or door when used as a natural light source and/or for occupant's views of the outdoors.

C. R value, thermal resistance, is a unit of measure of the ability to resist heat flow.  The higher the R value, the higher the insulating ability.

D. U value is the overall coefficient of heat transmission and is the combined thermal value of all the materials in a building section.  U is the reciprocal of R.  Thus U = 1/R or R = 1/U or 1/C where C is the thermal conductance and is the unit of measure of the rate of heat flow for the actual thickness of a material one square foot in area at a temperature of one degree Fahrenheit.  The lower the U value, the higher the insulating ability.

E.  Winter degree-day is a unit based on temperature difference 
and time.  For any one day, when the mean temperature is less than 
65 degrees F (18.3 degrees Celsius), there are as many degree-days as the number of degrees difference between the mean temperature for the day and 65 degrees F.  The daily mean temperature is computed as half the total of the daily maximum and daily minimum temperatures.

Note 2.  Insulation must be continuous (i.e. no gaps) above all ceiling joists.  In pitched roof construction, compression of insulation at the outside building walls is permitted to allow a 1" ventilation space under the roof sheathing.  For any loose fill insulation, a baffle must be provided.  Raised trusses are not required.

Note 3.  For floors of heated spaces over unheated basements, unheated garages or unheated crawl spaces, the U value of floor section shall not exceed the value shown.  A basement, crawl space, or garage shall be considered unheated unless it is provided with a positive heat supply to maintain a minimum temperature of 50 degrees F.  Positive heat supply is defined by ASHRAE as heat supplied to a space by design or by heat losses occurring from energy-consuming systems or components associated with that space."

         Where the walls of an unheated basement or crawl space are insulated in lieu of floor insulation, the total heat loss attributed to the floor from the heated area shall not exceed the heat loss calculated for floors with required insulation.

         Insulation may be omitted from floors over heated basement areas or heated crawl spaces if foundation walls are insulated.  The U value of foundation wall sections shall not exceed the value shown.  This requirement shall include all foundation wall area, including header joist (band joist), to a point 50 percent of the distance from a finish grade to the basement floor level.

Notice to Purchasers and Renters of Housing Constructed
 Before 1978

Warning - Lead-Based Paint Hazards

If the home you intend to purchase or rent was built before 1978, it may contain lead-based paint.  About three out of every four pre-1978 buildings have lead-based paint.
YOU NEED TO READ THIS
NOTICE ABOUT LEAD
WHAT IS LEAD POISONING?

Lead poisoning means having high concentrations of lead in the body.  LEAD CAN:
o  Cause major health problems, especially in children
   under 7 years old.
o  Damage a child's brain, nervous system, kidneys,
   hearing, or coordination.
o  Affect learning.
o  Cause behavior problems, blindness, and even death.
o  Cause problems in pregnancy and affect a baby's normal
   development.

WHO GETS LEAD POISONING?

Anyone can get lead poisoning, but children under 7 years old are at the greatest risk, because their bodies are not fully grown and are easily damaged.  The risk is worse if the child:

o  Lives in the older home (built/constructed before 1978,
   and even more so before 1960).
o  Does not eat regular meals (an empty stomach accepts
   lead more easily).
o  Does not eat enough foods with iron or calcium.
o  Has parents who work in lead-related jobs.
o  Has played in the same places as brothers, sisters, and
   friends who have been lead poisoned.  (Lead poison
   cannot be spread from person to person.  It comes from
   contact with lead.)

Women of childbearing age are also at risk, because lead poisoning can cause miscarriages, premature births, and the poison can be passed onto their unborn babies.

RD Instruction 1924-A

WHERE DOES LEAD POISONING COME FROM?


The lead hazards that children most often touch are lead dust, leaded soil, loose chips and chewable surfaces painted with lead-based paint.  A child may be harmed when it puts into its mouth, toys, pacifiers, or hands that have leaded soil or lead dust on them.  Lead also comes from:

o  Moving parts of windows and doors that can make lead
   dust and chips.
o  Lead-based paint on windows, doors, wood trim, walls and
   cabinets in kitchens and bathrooms, on porches, stairs,
   railings, fire escapes, and lamp posts.
o  Soil next to exterior of buildings that have been
   painted with lead-based paint and leaded gasoline dust
   in soil near busy streets.
o  Drinking water (pipes and solder).
o  Parents who may bring lead dust home from work on skin,
   clothes, and hair.
o  Colored newsprint and car batteries.
o  Highly glazed pottery and cookware from other countries.
o  Removing old paint when refinishing furniture.

In recent years some uses of lead in products that could cause lead poisoning have been reduced or banned.  This is true for lead in gasoline, lead in solder used in water pipes, and lead in paint.  Still, a great deal of lead remains in and around older homes, and lead-based paint and accompanying lead dust are seen as the major source.


HOW DO I KNOW IF MY CHILD IS AFFECTED?

Is your child:

o  Cranky?                     o  Unable to concentrate?
o  Vomiting?                   o  Hyperactive?
o  Tired?                      o  Playing with children who
o  Unwilling to eat or play?      have these symptoms?
o  Complaining of stomach 
   aches or headaches?

These can be signs of lead poisoning.  However, your children might not show these signs and yet be poisoned; only your clinic or doctor can test for sure.


RD Instruction 1924-A
Exhibit H
Attachment 1
Page 3
WHAT CAN I DO ABOUT LEAD POISONING?

Your child should first be tested for lead in the blood between the age of 6 months and 1 year.  Ask the clinic or your doctor to perform the test during a regular checkup.  Your doctor will tell you how often you should have your child tested after that.  A small amount of lead in the blood may not make your child seem very sick, but it can affect how well he or she can learn.  If your child does have high amounts of lead in the blood, you should seek treatment and have your home tested for lead-based paint and lead dust.

HOW DO I KNOW IF MY HOME HAS LEAD-BASED PAINT?

Rural Development inspection does not determine whether a home actually has lead-based paint.  It only identifies whether there is defective paint in a home that might have lead-based paint.  Therefore, the only way you can know for sure is to have the home tested by a qualified firm or laboratory.  Both the interior and exterior should be tested.  You should contact the local health or environmental office for help.

WHAT DO I DO IF MY HOME DOES HAVE LEAD?

Do not try to get rid of lead-based paint yourself.  You could make things worse for you and your family.  If your home contains lead-based paint and you are the owner, contact a company that specializes in lead-based paint abatement.  Have professionals do the job correctly and safely.  This may cost thousands of dollars, depending on the amount of lead-based paint found in your home, but it will also protect you and your children from the effects of lead poisoning.  If you are a renter, notify the management or landlord immediately and cooperate with the management's office or landlord's efforts to repair any deficiencies and keep your home in good shape.  To prevent peeling paint, most housing should be repainted every 3 to 5 years.  If your home has not been repainted within this period of time, inform the management office or landlord.  In the meantime, there are things you can do immediately to protect your child:

o  Keep your child away from paint chips and dust.
o  Wet-mop floors and wipe down surfaces often, especially
   where the floors and walls meet.  Be sure to clean the
   space where the window sash rests on the sill.  Keeping
   the floor clear of paint chips, dust, and dirt is easy
   and very important.  Do not sweep or vacuum lead-based
   paint chips or dust with an ordinary vacuum cleaner. 
   Lead dust is so fine it will pass through a vacuum
   cleaner bag and spread into the air you breathe.
o  Make sure your children wash their hands frequently and
   always before eating.
o  Wash toys, teething rings, and pacifiers frequently.

MANUFACTURED HOME SITES, RENTAL PROJECTS AND SUBDIVISIONS:
DEVELOPMENT, INSTALLATION AND SET-UP

PART A - INTRODUCTION

I.  Purpose and Scope.  This Exhibit describes and identifies acceptable site development, installation and set-up practices and concepts for manufactured homes.  It is intended for Rural Development field personnel, builders, developers, sponsors, and others participating in Rural Development housing programs.

This Exhibit applies to all manufactured homes (except those referenced in Exhibit B of this subpart) on scattered sites or in rental projects and subdivisions and covers the requirements for design and construction of manufactured home communities.  Rural Development may approve alternatives or substitutes if it finds the proposed design satisfactory for the proposed use, and if the materials, installation, device, arrangement, or method of work is at least equivalent to that prescribed in this Exhibit considering quality, strength, effectiveness, durability, safety and protection of life and health.

Rural Development will require satisfactory evidence to be submitted to substantiate claims made regarding the use of any proposed alternative.

II.  Background.  Rural Development has authority to make (1) Section 502 Rural Housing (RH) loans with respect to manufactured homes and lots, and (2) Section 515 Rural Rental Housing (RRH) loans with respect to manufactured home rental projects.

The manufactured home must be constructed in conformance with the Federal Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standard (FMHCSS) and be permanently attached to a site-built permanent foundation which meets or exceeds the Minimum Property Standards (MPS) for One- and Two-Family Dwellings or Model Building Codes acceptable to Rural Development.  The manufactured home must be permanently attached to that foundation by anchoring devices adequate to resist all loads identified in the MPS.  This includes resistance to ground movements, seismic shaking, potential shearing, overturning and uplift loads caused by wind.  Note that anchoring straps or cables affixed to ground anchors other than footings will not meet these requirements.

Subpart G of Part 1940 of this chapter applies on scattered sites, in subdivisions and rental projects to the development, installation and set-up of manufactured homes.  To determine the level of environmental analysis required for a particular application, each manufactured home or lot involved shall be considered as equivalent to one housing unit or lot as these terms are used in §§1940.310-.312 as well as in any other sections of Subpart G of Part 1940 of this chapter.  The implementation of Rural Development environmental policies and the consideration of important land use impacts are of particular relevance in the review of proposed manufactured home sites and in achieving
(12-18-86)  SPECIAL PN

RD Instruction 1924-A
Exhibit J
Page 2

the two purposes highlighted below.  Because the development, installation and set-up of manufactured home communities, including scattered sites, rental projects, and subdivisions, differ in some requirements from conventional site and subdivision development, two of the purposes of this Exhibit are to:

A.  Encourage economical and orderly development of such communities and nearby areas, and
B.  Promote the safety and health of residents of such communities.

Therefore, this Exhibit identifies those required standards and regulations and suggested guidelines for eliminating and preventing health and safety hazards and promoting the economical and orderly development and utilization of land for planning and development of manufactured home communities.  The Exhibit also provides the requirements for meeting the following:

A.  Resistance to Wind.  Foundations and anchorages shall be designed to resist wind forces specified in American National Standards Institute (ANSI) A-58.1-1982 for the geographic area in which the manufactured home will be sited;
B.  Proper Installation.  The manufacturer's installation instructions provided with each manufactured home shall contain instructions for at least one site-built foundation with interior and/or perimeter supports.  Rural Development field office personnel shall review to determine its adequacy as security for an Rural Development loan only, the foundation design concept for compliance with this Exhibit, the Rural Development/MPS and any Model Building Code acceptable to Rural Development in that particular geographic area; and
C.  Proper Foundation Design.  Manufactured homes shall be installed on a foundation system which is designed and constructed to sustain, within allowable stress and settlement limitations, all applicable loads.  Any foundation and anchorage system or method of construction to be used should be analyzed in accordance with well-established principles of mechanics and structural engineering.

III.  Definitions.  For the purpose of this Exhibit the following definitions apply:

Accessory Building or Structure.  A subordinate building or structure which is an addition to or supplements the facilities provided by a manufactured home.

Anchoring Systems.  An approved system for securing the manufactured home to the ground or foundation system that will, when properly designed and installed, resist overturning and lateral movement of the home from wind forces.

Contiguous.  Sharing a boundary, adjoining or adjacent.  A lot or subdivision is considered to be contiguous to other lots or subdivisions if it is adjoining, touching or adjacent.

     C.  The finished grade elevation beneath the manufactured home or the first floor elevation of the habitable space, whichever is lower, shall be above the 100-year return frequency flood elevation.  This requirement applies wherever manufactured homes may be installed, not just in locations designated by the National Flood Insurance Program as areas of special flood hazards.  The use of fill to accomplish this is a last resort.  However, as stated in § 1940.304 of subpart G of Part 1940 of this chapter, it is the Agencys Policy not to approve or fund any proposal in a 100-year floodplain area unless there is no practicable alternative to such a floodplain location.

     D.  Essential service such as employment centers, shopping, schools, recreation areas, police and fire Protection, and garbage and trash removal shall be convenient to the development and any site, community, or subdivision must meet the environmental and location requirements contained in Subpart G of Part 1940 of this chapter.

     E.  Manufactured home sites, rental projects and subdivisions shall not be subject to any adverse influences of adjacent land uses.  An adverse influence is considered as one that is out of the acceptable level or range of a recognizable standard or where no standard exists is considered a nuisance irrespective of a site being zoned for manufactured home use.  Health, safety and aesthetic consequences of location shall be carefully assessed by inspection of the site prior to selection for development.  Undesirable land uses such as deteriorated residential or commercial areas and noxious industrial properties shall be avoided to ensure compatibility.  Other undesirable elements such as heavily traveled highways, airport runways, railroads, or fire hazards and other areas subject to recognizably intolerable noise levels shall be avoided.

     F.  The requirements for streets shall be those found in subpart C of Part 1924 of this chapter.  (Revised 6-22-87, SPECIAL PN.)

     G.  The site design and development shall be in accordance with sound engineering and architectural practices and shall provide for all utilities in a manner which allows adequate, economic, safe, energy efficient and dependable systems with sufficient easements for their required installation and maintenance.

     H.  Utilities for each manufactured home site, rental housing project or subdivision shall be designed and installed in accordance with subpart C of Part 1924 of this chapter; and the State health authority having jurisdiction, and all local laws and regulations requiring approval prior to construction.

Stage 2 and 3 inspections for manufactured homes may be combined when authorized by the State Director.

B.  The borrower will join the County Supervisor or the District Director in making periodic inspections as often as possible and always for the final inspection.

C.  The borrower should be encouraged to make enough periodic visits to the site to be familiar with the progress and performance of the work in order to protect the borrower's interest.  If the borrower observes or otherwise becomes aware of any fault or defect in the work or nonconformance with the contract documents, the borrower should give prompt written notice thereof to the dealer-contractor and a copy of the notice to the appropriate County Supervisor or District Director.

D.  During inspection, it will generally be infeasible to determine whether a manufactured unit erected on a site was properly braced and stiffened during transportation.  Inspectors should examine these units

to determine that there is no obvious damage or loosening of fastenings that may have occurred during transportation.  The dealer-contractor must warrant these units against such damage, which should protect the Agencys interest.

III. Warranty Plan Coverage.  The warranty requirements for all development work shall be in accordance with § 1924.9(d) of this subpart and 7 CFR part 3550, subpart B.  (Revised 01-23-03, SPECIAL PN.)

CLASSIFICATIONS FOR MULTI-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL REHABILITATION WORK

I.  GENERAL

This Exhibit distinguishes between what Rural Development considers maintenance and repair work, moderate rehabilitation and substantial rehabilitation.  In all cases, the building or project to be rehabilitated shall be structurally sound.  The applicant shall have a structural analysis of the existing building made to determine the adequacy of all structural systems for the proposed rehabilitation.

II.   DEFINITIONS

Maintenance and Repair - Work involved in the selective replacement and general maintenance and repair of certain materials, appliances or components of an existing residential building.

Moderate Rehabilitation - All work directly involved in the rearrangement of interior space, the replacement of finish materials or components of the electrical, plumbing, heating or conveyance system of an existing multi-family residential building.  Work and improvements are considered to be more than routine maintenance and repair.

Substantial Rehabilitation - All work directly involved in the rearrangement of interior space that involves alteration of load bearing partitions and columns; the replacement of the electrical, plumbing, heating or conveyance systems; and the addition to and/or major conversion of existing multi-family residential buildings or other building structures.

Moderate rehabilitation and repair shall not be limited to building changes for cosmetic or convenience purposes.  In all cases moderate rehabilitation shall involve a minimum of three (3) components of building rehabilitation listed as moderate.  Unless combined with other improvements in a project that are considered to be moderate or substantial rehabilitation the items identified as maintenance and repair are considered to be cosmetic and convenience changes.

When a rehabilitation project consists of both moderate and substantial rehabilitation components, those substantial rehabilitation components shall be in accordance with Rural Development's development standards and local codes and regulation requirements.  Where the majority of project components of building rehabilitation are considered substantial the project shall be considered in the substantial rehabilitation category.



(5-12-87)  SPECIAL PN

RD Instruction 1924-K
Exhibit K
Page 2


Those site components of rehabilitation such as landscaping, grading, drainage, fencing, parking areas, recreation areas, water and waste disposal systems, etc., whether considered either maintenance and repair, moderate rehabilitation or substantial rehabilitation shall be in accordance with Rural Development's development standards for site development work; all local codes and regulation requirements; and sound engineering and architectural practices.

Any alteration of a structure listed or eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places may be considered either moderate or substantial rehabilitation; however, it shall conform first to the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation and Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings and then to Rural Development's requirements.  In cases where the Secretary of the Interior's standards cannot be met, rehabilitation will conform to the agreed upon approaches, treatments and techniques resulting from the consultation process between Rural Development, the borrower, the State Historic Preservation Officer and the Advisory Council of Historic Preservation.

III.  COMPONENTS OF MULTI-FAMILY BUILDING REHABILITATION

The components of multi-family building rehabilitation necessary and generally considered by Rural Development to be either maintenance and repair, moderate rehabilitation or substantial rehabilitation include but are not limited to those listed in the following chart.

INSURED 10-YEAR HOME WARRANTY PLAN REQUIREMENTS

I.  Purpose:  In recent years, numerous third-party home warranty plans have been developed offering new homeowners varying degrees of protection against builder default and/or major structural defects in their homes.  This exhibit establishes the criteria and procedures by which a warranty plan is found acceptable for new construction of single family homes financed by Rural Development.  An acceptable warranty plan will:

A.  Assure that Rural Development borrowers receive adequate warranty coverage,
B.  In certain circumstances, eliminate the requirement for Rural Development personnel to make the first two construction inspections, and
C.  Permit a loan up to the market value of the security (less the unpaid principal balance and past due interest of any other liens against the security), even though Rural Development personnel may not have performed periodic inspections during construction.

II.  Types of Warranty Companies.

A.  An insured warranty company is underwritten by an insurance carrier, licensed to operate as an insurer by the states where the warranty company plans to operate, and has an acceptable rating from a nationally recognized rating company such as A. M. Best Company.
B.  A risk retention group is an insurer which is licensed in one state and is authorized, under the Products Liability Risk Retention Act of 1981, to issue its policies in all states.  This authority is not challenged by Rural Development; however, there remains some question as to the legal propriety of a 10-year insured warranty insurer to be a risk-retention group.  If at some future time any state insurance commission or regulatory agency challenges the legal authority of such group, Rural Development will reconsider its acceptance of the group.
C.  Individual state warranty plans, such as that offered by the State of New Jersey, are backed by the full faith and credit of the state government.

III. Plan Requirements

To be considered acceptable, a warranty plan must include the following features:

A.  The entire cost (fee, premium, etc.) of the coverage is prepaid and coverage automatically transfers to subsequent owners without additional cost.
B.  The coverage is not cancellable by the warrantor (builder), warranty company or insurer.



(5-12-87)  SPECIAL PN

RD Instruction 1924-A
Exhibit L
Page 2


C.  The coverage includes at least the following:

(1)  For one year from the effective date, any defects caused by faulty workmanship or defective materials.

(2)  During the second year after the effective date, the warranty continues to cover the wiring, piping and duct work of the electrical, plumbing, heating and cooling systems, plus the items in (3).

(3)  During the third through the tenth years, the warranty continues to cover minor structural defects.  A minor structural defect is actual damage to the load-bearing portion of the home including damage due to subsidence, expansion or lateral movement of the soil (excluding movement caused by flood or earthquake) which affects its load-bearing function and which vitally affects or is imminently likely to affect use of the home for residential purposes.

D.   A system is provided for complaint (claims) handling which includes a conciliation and, if necessary to resolve matters in dispute, arbitration arranges by the American Arbitration Association or similar organization.

E.   A construction inspection plan is required if Rural Development is to eliminate the first two Rural Development inspections or permit a full market value loan when Rural Development inspections are not conducted.

IV.  Information for  Review.

A.   Companies submitting warranty plans for a determination of acceptability must support requests with the following information.

(1)  Evidence that the insured warranty company has met the applicable state licensing and/or regulatory requirements in the state in which the company plans to operate.

(2)  Evidence that the insurance carrier underwriting the warranty plan is licensed to operate as an insurer in the states in which the company plans to operate and has an acceptable rating from a nationally recognized rating company such as A. M. Best Company.

(3)  State warranty plan agencies will provide evidence that the plan is backed by the full faith and credit of the state.

RD Instruction 1924-A
Exhibit L
Page 3


(4)  A full description of the warranty plan including information on the fees, builder and home registration procedures, required construction standards, construction inspection procedures, coverage provided and claims procedures.
(5)  A sample copy of the warranty information and/or policy which is provided to the homeowner.
(6)  Suggested means by which Rural Development field offices can readily assure that the builder is a member in good standing prior to loan approval and that a warranty will be issued upon the completion of construction prior to the final release of funds.

B.   Submission and Acceptance.

(1)  Insured warranty companies, except those operating as risk retention groups, and state warranty plan agencies will submit their requests and supporting information to the Rural Development State Director in the state in which they plan to operate.  State Directors will determine the acceptability of insured warranty plans and state warranty plans in their jurisdictions, notify the company or agency of the decision in writing and notify field offices by issuance of a State Supplement including the names and addresses of acceptable warranty companies and any other pertinent information.
(2)  Warranty companies claiming authority as risk retention groups will submit their requests and supporting information including certification that it has complied with all requirements of the Products Liability Risk Retention Act of 1981 (Public law 97-45) and information indicating the state in which it is licensed, information to the Rural Development National Office, Single Family Housing Processing Division.  The National Office will determine the acceptability of the warranty of a risk retention group, notify the company of the decision in writing and notify field offices by issuance of an attachment to this Exhibit.

V.  Warranty Performance.

A.  County Supervisors will report inadequate warranty performance through their District Director to the State Director.  State Directors will review the situation, assist in resolving any problems and, if necessary, initiate action under Subpart F of Part 1924 of this chapter.  State Directors will inform, by memorandum, the Director, Single Family Housing Processing Division, National Office, of any problems with warranty performance and if any debarment action is initiated.

B.  State Directors will annually monitor each warranty company and/or its insurer to assure continued compliance with state licensing and/or regulatory requirements.

Acceptable Warranty Companies

The warranty companies listed below claim authority to act as a risk retention group under the Products Liability Risk Retention Act of 1981 and as such, to operate in all states to provide 10-year home warranties.  This authority remains subject to future challenges by any state insurance commissioner or regulatory agency; however, until such challenge is made, Rural Development accepts their warranty.

CONTRACT DOCUMENTS

This guide is provided to assist USDA/Rural Development personnel and applicants in assembling and reviewing Contract Documents for more complex construction projects such as that administered under § 1924.13.

It is important when preparing or reviewing contract documents that all clauses are in conformance with Rural Development /Rural Housing Service (RHS) program requirements as well as those of State and local jurisdictions.  These requirements may vary significantly depending on the relationship between the Owner and Contractor, the type of surety provided, if any, and the type of RHS financial assistance.  All appropriate document modifications must be made before United States of America concurrence of the Contract.

Contract Documents may incorporate documents published by the American Institute of Architects (AIA) if they are the current editions and are used in accordance with copyright rules.  A complete set of Contract Documents may include the following:

FOREWORD



This Guide is designed to assist Rural Development personnel determine and evaluate design features which are not fully described in local building codes or the development standards for rural housing proposals requesting financing from the Agency.  Housing proposals should address the liveability and marketability objectives in the Rural Development Manual of Acceptable Practice (MAP) and this Guide.  Substantial deviation from these objectives should be evaluated in the appraisal process and reflected in the present market value of the proposed housing.

CHAPTER 3
SITE DEVELOPMENT

300       GENERAL

Site development includes the arrangement of all site facilities necessary to create a safe, functional, convenient, healthful, durable and attractive living environment for residents.

This chapter gives basic guidelines and considerations to be used by an applicant or builder-developer in planning subdivisions, individual sites, and Multi-Family Housing developments.  Site development requirements are prescribed in RD Instruction 1924-C, Exhibit B.

301       LAND USE

301-1     GENERAL

Land use planning for all housing should relate appropriately to all site conditions and to the existing or permissible development of adjoining properties.

301-2     BUILDING LOCATION AND ARRANGEMENT

301-2.1   The use of a proposed site should be planned for buildings so
          arranged on the site and having characteristics which assure
          that:

(a)  The property has adequate visual appeal.

(b)  The property can be operated and maintained at costs reasonably related to income.

(c)  The land use and other site planning standards are met, and

(d)  Zoning and other local regulations are complied with.

301-2.2   The building arrangement and location should relate well:

(a)  To the natural topography, avoiding deep cuts, fills, excessive foundation wall depth, unnecessary steps and steep access gradients.

(b)  To climatic conditions, assuring maximum benefit from and protection against, as appropriate, sun, wind, temperature, precipitation, etc., and

RD Instruction 1924-A
Guide 2
Page 3 - 3

(c)  To attractive on-site and off-site views.

301-2.3   The building location, arrangement, and orientation should
assure adequate open space for outdoor living areas, all facilities, services, amenities, and for interior natural light, air and privacy.  Undesirable outlook from windows of rooms for daytime use should be avoided.

301-3     INTENSITY OF DEVELOPMENT

The number, size and type of dwelling, along with parking spaces, recreation and other open spaces should be determined by the characteristics of the site, its location, land cost, and acceptability by the community.

301-4     NOISE CONTROL

Through the use of site design techniques such as building location and orientation, window placement and the use of barriers, predictable undesirable site noise should be tolerated to as close to clearly acceptable levels as practicable.  See HUD-PDR-735 "Noise Assessment Guidelines."

301-5     SITE SURROUNDINGS

The site design should be arranged when practical and possible to harmonize with the complement functions and appearance of site surroundings which have a significant bearing on the site.  Where the surroundings of a site have incongruous functions or undesirable visual conditions, buffers or screen devices sufficient to separate or modify these unpleasant conditions should be provided.

301-5.1   No site should be developed where external influences on the
site create conditions undesirable for residential use such as:

(a)  Hazardous landslides, falling rock, or other unstable slope conditions due to site topographic or geologic conditions;

(b)  Unusual terrain features such as steep slopes, abutting rock formations, or other conditions affecting construction, drainage, or livability;

(c)  Unusual risks from natural hazards such as geologic faults, flash floods, volcanic activity, mudslides or fires, or from the presence of ponds, or hazardous terrain features;

(d)  Unwarranted risks from man-made hazards such as the presence of hazardous materials, or the presence of potentially hazardous industrial activity or material in the surrounding area;

(e)  Nuisances from odors, vibrations, unsightly areas, nearby landfills, inconvenience or other nuisances.

301-6     BLOCKS

301-6.1   The lengths, widths and shapes of blocks should be determined
with due regard to:

(a)  Provision of adequate building sites suitable to the special needs of the type of use contemplated.

(b)  Zoning requirements as to lot sizes and dimensions.

(c)  Needs for convenient access, circulation, control and safety of street traffic.

(d)  Limitations and opportunities of topography.

301-6.2   Block lengths generally should not exceed 1600 feet nor be
less than 400 feet.

301-6.3   Blocks should be wide enough to allow two tiers of lots of
minimum depth.  However, where this would require lots to front on an arterial street or highway or where topographical conditions of the size of the property prevent two tiers of lots, single lots with necessary alterations may be used.

301-6.4   When double tiered blocks are over 800 feet in length, a 10-foot
wide pedestrian access easement is recommended near the center of the block for circulation or access to schools, playgrounds, shopping centers, transportation and other community facilities.

301-6.5   Intersections with arterial streets should be held to a minimum
and preferably spaced at least 1000 feet apart.

302       UTILITIES

302-1     GENERAL

The site design should provide for all utilities in a manner which allows economy in construction and maintenance.

302-1.1   The site design should be arranged to recognize existing
easements, utility lines, etc., and permit connection to existing facilities where necessary for the proper functioning of drainage and utilities.

303-6.1.1 All driving and parking areas should have sufficient gradient
to provide for adequate drainage.  Storm sewers or drainage ditches should be provided to accept surface run-off and prevent pooling on roadway areas.  In arid or semi-arid areas, the roadway may be designed with an inverted crown to accommodate occasional run-off.  Subsurface drainage should be adequate to maintain a stable subgrade.

303-6.1.2 The subgrade should provide a stable platform for the base and
wearing surface under all anticipated geologic, hydrologic and climatic conditions.  The subgrade should be judged acceptable according to soil type and anticipated traffic loads.

(a)  In-place soil should not contain amounts of muck, clay, veritable matter or other elements which will detrimentally affect the structure of the roadway.  Where these elements do occur the stabilization procedures outlined below should be followed.  The subgrade should be thoroughly compacted to a density necessary to support the roadway.

(b)  Fill material should be free from muck, clay, vegetable matter or other elements which will detrimentally affect the structure of the roadway.  All fill should be compacted according to the characteristics of the acceptable in-place soil, the fill soil and anticipated traffic loads.  Where extensive fill is required, the design should be executed by a qualified professional engineer.

(c)  Compaction should be adequate for the design load of the roadway plus a 25 percent impact load.  State or local regulations should be followed in the determination of acceptable practice.

(d)  In areas where soil in-place is not adequate for use as a street subgrade, appropriate stabilization should be utilized.  Soil cement, lime and calcium chloride are the most commonly used stabilization elements and their use for each particular case should be determined by a competent engineering study or by local regulations.

303-6.1.3 The base should be constructed in a manner which will provide a
suitable course for the application of the final surfacing.  The composition and depth of the base should be appropriate for the type and amount of traffic anticipated.  The types listed below are generally acceptable base materials and others may be used according to local conditions.

(a)  Gravel Base.  This base should consist of gravel and filler constructed on a prepared subgrade.  The material should be free from organic matter and lumps or balls of clay; and such

Material should be removed and replaced with approved material.  The base thickness should be determined by the projected road usage and should be placed in layers not to exceed three (3) inches in thickness after compaction.  The base course material should not be deposited or shaped on a frozen or thawing subgrade or during unfavorable weather conditions.

(b)  Crushed Stone Base.  This base should consist of crushed stone constructed on a prepared subgrade.  The material should consist of hard, durable particles or fragments of stone, free from an excess of flat, elongated, soft or disintegrated pieces, dirt or other objectionable matter.  The base thickness should be determined by the projected road usage and should be placed in layers not to exceed three (3) inches in thickness after compaction.  After the coarse aggregate has been thoroughly compacted, choker stone should be gradually applied to fill all voids.  No base course material should be deposited or shaped when the subgrade is frozen or thawing or during unfavorable weather conditions.

(c)  Soil Cement Base.  This base should consist of a combination of soil and portland cement uniformly mixed, moistened and compacted.  Water should be from oil, acids, alkali and vegetable matter and should be reasonably clean.  Soil for this base course should consist of the soil found in place, and any additional soil that may be required should be treated as necessary for use as abase material.  Prior to mixing, the soil should be pulverized for the full width and sufficient depth of the roadway.  The specified quantity of portland cement should be spread in one operation and thoroughly mixed before the application of water and compaction.  After compaction, the roadway should be cured for an appropriate period of time and traffic should be prohibited during this time.

(d)  Asphaltic Concrete Base.  This base should be composed of a combination of course aggregate, fine aggregates and bituminous cement mixed in a central plant.  Asphaltic cement to be used in the asphaltic concrete should be uniform in character, free from water and should contain no mineral matter other than that naturally present.  Aggregate should consist of fine gravel and sand, disintegrated granite, or other similar granular materials.  Where cement concrete or masonry edging is not used, suitable side forms of wood or steel should be placed.  Placing of the mixture should be as continuous as possible with all joints well bonded and sealed.  After spreading, the mixture should be thoroughly compacted with a power drive roller according to accepted practices.  No asphalt material should be laid when the temperature of the air is 50 degrees

Fahrenheit and falling or during other unfavorable weather conditions.

303-6.1.4 Hard surfaced wearing surfaces, when required, should be of
adequate design for the projected traffic loads.  Local regulations, availability of materials, and maintenance facilities will dictate the type of paving to be used.  The following types of paving are generally acceptable, although some types may not be locally accepted, or additional materials may be used according to local regulations.

(a)  Portland Cement Concrete Pavement.  This surface should consist of water, aggregate and cement in the required proportions.  Forms should be placed to acceptable tolerances, properly braced, and well oiled before placement of the material.  The concrete should be deposited rapidly and leveled according to approved methods.  Finishing should be done to remove free water, to provide the desired final appearance and to correct surface irregularities.  Expansion and contraction joints should be provided at the required intervals.  Properly protected curing for a minimum 72 hours should be observed.  No concrete should be placed on a frozen or thawing subgrade or during unfavorable weather conditions, or when the temperature is 38 degrees and falling.

(b)  Double Bituminous Surface Treatment (Cutback Asphalt).  This surface should consist of three applications of bitumen and a spreading of coarse aggregate and seal coat aggregate on a prepared base.  Bituminous materials should conform to applicable specifications.  Aggregate should be crushed stone and should consist of particles of clean, hard, tough, durable, uncoated rock fragments and should be reasonably free from an excess of flat, elongated soft or disintegrated pieces, organic or other objectionable matter and should be free from lumps of clay.  The bitumen should be applied with a pressure-type power distributor.  A prime coat should be uniformly spread and allowed to set up.  A second coat should be applied followed immediately by an application of coarse aggregate which should be uniformly rolled.  A seal coat of bitumen and aggregate should be applied after all loose and excess aggregate have been removed from the first coating.  No materials should be placed when either the temperature of the air or base on which the material is to be placed is 50 degrees Fahrenheit and falling or during unfavorable weather conditions.

(c)  One Course Asphaltic Wearing Surface.  This surface should consist of a wearing course composed of aggregate and bituminous material mixed in a central plant.  Liquid asphalt should be of acceptable quality.  Asphalt cement to be used in

The asphaltic concrete should be uniform in character, free from water and should contain no mineral matter other than that naturally present.  Aggregate should consist of fine gravel and sand, disintegrated granite and other similar granular materials.  The existing surface should be cleaned before application of the tack coat by a pressure-type power distributor.  The bituminous mixture should be spread, raked and rolled in an acceptable manner.  Longitudinal and transverse joints should be well bonded and sealed.  No asphalt material should be laid when the temperature of the air is 50 degrees Fahrenheit and falling or during unfavorable weather conditions.

(d)  Asphaltic Concrete Wearing Surface.  This surface should consist of aggregate and bituminous material mixed in a central plant.  Asphalt cement to be used in the asphaltic concrete should be uniform in character, free from water and should contain no mineral matter other than that naturally present.  Aggregate should consist of fine gravel and sand, Aggregate disintegrated granite or other similar granular materials.  The bituminous mixture should be spread, raked and rolled in an acceptable manner.  Longitudinal and transverse joints should be well bonded and sealed.  No asphalt material should be laid when the temperature of the air is 50 degrees Fahrenheit and falling or during unfavorable weather conditions.

303-6.1.5 All-weather surfaces, where acceptable, should be designed to
accommodate the projected traffic load.  The subgrade and base should be constructed in a manner similar to hard-surface roads so that hard surfacing can be easily accomplished at a later date.  The following types are generally acceptable and other types may be used dependent upon local conditions.

(a)  Layered Oil Surface.  This surface should consist of aggregate and waste oil thoroughly mixed and compacted.  The base should be scarified and oil applied by a pressure-type power distributor.  This process should be repeated a number of times until the mixture is consistent to an acceptable depth.  Final compaction should provide a regular surface with the required density.

(b)  Gravel Surface.  This surface should consist of course and fine aggregates applied in a manner similar to gravel bases.  If the gravel wearing surface is for long-term usage, a permanent gravel or crushed stone base should be covered with a layer of aggregate selected or treated to minimize dust in use.  Where hard surfacing is anticipated within 24 months, a suitable gravel base may be used as a driving surface provided adequate maintenance is performed and the base is adequately required before application of the hard surfacing.

314       HILLSIDE DEVELOPMENT
314-1     GENERAL

It is the intent of this Section to provide guidelines for sites, where the majority of the land area has slopes exceeding fifteen percent (15%) and special measures must be taken to provide adequate building sites with safe access and reliable utilities.  These steep sites will be acceptable for Rural Development financed housing only if the State Director determines there are no other suitable sites of lesser slopes available in the area where the housing need exists.

314-2     MANUFACTURED SLOPES

314-2.1   All manufactured slopes adjacent to the roadway should normally
be a maximum of two horizontal to one vertical (2:1 unless limited to existing topography or constructed in rock.  Manufactured slopes of less than two to one (2:1) may be permitted where adequate slope control measures such as retaining walls or rip-rap embankment are utilized.  The slope should in no case exceed the natural angle of repose of the material.  Cut and fill slopes should be constructed to eliminate sharp angles of intersection with the existing terrain and should be rounded and contoured as necessary to blend with the natural topography to the maximum possible intent.

314-2.2   All manufactured slopes, other than those constructed in rock,
should be planted or otherwise protected from the effects of storm erosion as soon as possible after construction and should be benched, terraced and excessive runoff diverted as required to provide for adequate stability.  If the severity of the slope or the composition of the soil indicates unusual stability hazards, according to soil reports, further remedies may be necessary as determined with the assistance of a qualified soils engineer.

314-3     LOT AREAS

As the slope of terrain increases, lot areas normally increase to provide adequate outdoor living area, driveways, allowance for slope maintenance, snow removal or collection, etc.  Lots should be of adequate size to meet the needs of occupants of the structure to be placed thereon.

FOREWORD


This Guide is designed to assist Rural Development personnel and potential applicants in determining the feasibility and acceptability of existing multi-family residential properties for moderate rehabilitation.  The moderate rehabilitation quality and performance criteria contained in this Guide are significantly different from those Rural Developments development standards that apply to substantial rehabilitation.  This Guide should be used in conjunction with Rural Development's Design Guide and Manual of Acceptable Practice (MAP).  Although this Guide, the Design Guide, and the MAP are not mandatory documents, the construction and development plans for each moderately rehabilitated multi-family development should address the liveability and marketability objectives contained in these documents.  Substantial deviation from these objectives will be evaluated by our appraisal process and reflected in the present market value.

CHAPTER 1     GENERAL USE

100  APPLICATION

     The criteria in this Guide apply to the moderate rehabilitation of existing multi-family residential properties.  The range of moderate rehabilitation covered by this Guide is broad.  In a general context this Guide will aid in establishing the feasibility of a property considered for moderate rehabilitation.  It also provides information which is useful in preliminary planning, evaluation and development work.  Properties needing substantial rehabilitation must meet the same Rural Developments Development Standards as new multi-family housing.

101  GENERAL

     These guidelines provide minimum performance requirements and acceptability criteria for the moderate rehabilitation of dwellings to be financed by the Rural Development.  The guidelines are intended to serve as an aid to providing marketable, decent, functional, safe, sanitary and attractive housing through the moderate rehabilitation of existing dwelling units.  In all cases the building or project to be rehabilitated shall be structurally sound.  The applicant shall have a structural analysis of the existing building made to determine the adequacy of all structural systems for the proposed rehabilitation.  Rural Development differentiates between moderate rehabilitation, maintenance and repair and substantial rehabilitation as follows:

Maintenance and Repair - Work involved in the selective replacement and general maintenance and repair of certain materials, appliances or components of an existing residential building.

Moderate Rehabilitation - All work directly involved in the rearrangement of interior space, the replacement of finish materials or components of the electrical, plumbing, heating or conveyance systems of an existing multi-family residential building.  Work and improvements are considered to be more than routine maintenance and repair.

Substantial Rehabilitation - All work directly involved in the rearrangement of interior space that involves alteration of load bearing partitions and columns; the replacement of the electrical, plumbing, heating or coveyance systems: and the addition to and/or major conversion of existing multi-family residential buildings or other building structures.

Moderate rehabilitation and repair shall not be limited to building changes for cosmetic or convenience purposes.  In all cases moderate rehabilitation shall involve a minimum of three (3) components of building rehabilitation listed as moderate.  Unless combined with other improvements in a project that are considered to be moderate or substantial rehabilitation the items identified as maintenance and repair are considered to be cosmetic and convenience changes.

RD Instruction 1924-A
Guide 3
Page 1-5

      When a project consists of both moderate and substantial rehabilitation components, those substantial rehabilitation components shall be in accordance with Rural Development's development standards and local codes and regulation requirements.  Where the majority of project components of building rehabilitation are considered substantial the project shall be considered in the substantial rehabilitation category.

      Those site components of rehabilitation such as landscaping, grading, drainage, fencing, parking areas, recreation areas, water and waste disposal systems, etc., whether considered either maintenance and repair, moderate rehabilitation or substantial rehabilitation shall be in accordance with Rural Development's development standards for site development work; all local codes and regulation requirements, and sound engineering and architectural practices.

      The site requirements contained in Section 4 of the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS), the provisions of Sections 4.1.5, Accessible Building; Additions and 4.1.6 Accessible Building;  Alterations and all other appropriate UFAS requirements shall apply to all moderate rehabilitation.  Where Rural Development Instructions are more stringent than UFAS they shall apply.

      Any alteration of a structure listed or eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places may be considered either moderate or substantial rehabilitation.  However, it shall conform first to the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation are Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings and then to Rural Development's requirements.  In cases where the Secretary of the Interior's standards cannot be met, rehabilitation will conform to the agreed upon approaches, treatments and techniques resulting from the consultation process between Rural Development, the borrower, the State Historic Preservation Officer are the Advisory Council of Historic Preservation.


 102  GUIDE FORMAT

      The format of this Guide is to first list a major component of moderate rehabilitation (the chapter title); second, state the performance requirement that should be met for that component: and third provide acceptable criteria for meeting the performance requirement.  Also, by identifying acceptable criteria for various components of moderate rehabilitation, e.g., site and community, building design, fire safety, construction, mechanical equipment and exterior and interior finishes, the Guide achieves the major objectives of Rural Development, or ensuring decent, safe, and sanitary housing and related facilities with adequate liveability.

      Appendix A, Definitions, provide a basis for understanding the meaning of the phrases and terms used in this Guide.
