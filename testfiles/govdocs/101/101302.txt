Improving Government Regulations; Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory 
and Deregulatory Actions

AGENCY: Department of Defense (DoD).

ACTION: Semiannual regulatory agenda.

_______________________________________________________________________

SUMMARY: The Department of Defense (DoD) is publishing this semiannual 
agenda of regulatory documents, including those that are procurement-
related, for public information and comments under Executive Order 
12866 ``Regulatory Planning and Review.'' This agenda incorporates the 
objective and criteria, when applicable, of the regulatory reform 
program under the Executive order and other regulatory guidance. It 
contains DoD issuances initiated by DoD components that may have 
economic and environmental impact on State, local, or tribal interests 
under the criteria of Executive Order 12866. Although most DoD 
issuances listed in the agenda are of negligible public impact, their 
nature may be of public interest and, therefore, are published to 
provide notice of rulemaking and an opportunity for public 
participation in the internal DoD rulemaking process.

     For this edition of the Department of Defense's regulatory 
agenda, the most important significant regulatory actions are 
included in the Regulatory Plan, which appears in part II of this 
issue of the Federal Register. The Regulatory Plan entries are 
listed in the table of contents below and are denoted by a 
bracketed bold reference, which directs the reader to the 
appropriate sequence number in part II.

     This agenda updates the report published on May 16, 2005, and 
includes regulations expected to be issued and under review over 
the next 12 months. The next agenda is scheduled to be published in 
the spring of 2006, with the next regulatory plan scheduled to be 
published in the fall of 2006. In addition to this agenda, DoD 
components also publish rulemaking notices pertaining to their 
specific statutory administration requirements as required.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This edition of the Unified Agenda of 
Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions is composed of the 
regulatory status reports, including procurement-related regulatory 
status reports, from the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and 
the Departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force. Included also is the 
regulatory status report from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, whose 
civil works functions fall under the reporting requirements of 
Executive Order 12866 and involve water resource projects and 
regulation of activities in waters of the United States.

     DoD issuances range from DoD directives (reflecting 
departmental policy) to implementing instructions and regulations 
(largely internal and used to implement directives). The OSD agenda 
section contains the primary directives under which DoD components 
promulgate their implementing regulations.

     To ease identification and to differentiate among the variety 
of issuances reported, they are identified by their DoD internal 
numbering system, which denotes component level of authority and 
type of issuance, in addition to the required CFR number.

     In addition, this agenda, although published under the 
reporting requirements of Executive Order 12866, continues to be 
the DoD single-source reporting vehicle, which identifies issuances 
that are currently applicable under the various regulatory reform 
programs in progress. Therefore, DoD components will identify those 
rules which come under the criteria of the:

a. Regulatory Flexibility Act;

b. Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995;

c. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995.

[[Page 64485]]

     Those DoD issuances, which are directly applicable under these 
statutes, will be identified in the agenda and their action status 
indicated. Generally, the regulatory status reports in this agenda 
will contain five sections: (1) Prerule stage; (2) proposed rule 
stage; (3) final rule stage; (4) completed actions; and (5) long-
term actions. Where certain regulatory actions indicate that small 
entities are affected, the effect on these entities may not 
necessarily have significant economic impact on a substantial 
number of these entities as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility 
Act (5 U.S.C. 601(6)).

     Although not a regulatory agency, DoD will continue to 
participate in regulatory initiatives designed to reduce economic 
costs and unnecessary environmental burdens upon the public. 
Comments and recommendations are invited on the rules reported and 
should be addressed to the DoD component representatives identified 
in the regulatory status reports. Although sensitive to the needs 
of the public, as well as regulatory reform, DoD reserves the right 
to exercise the exemptions and flexibility permitted in its 
rulemaking process in order to proceed with its overall defense-
oriented mission. The publishing of this agenda does not waive the 
applicability of the military affairs exemption in section 553 of 
title 5 U.S.C. and section 3 of Executive Order 12866.

Dated: August 31, 2005.

 Howard G. Becker,

Deputy Director, Administration and Management.

USC 420; 31 USC 3529; 31 USC 3702; 32 USC 714; 37 USC 554; . . .

CFR Citation: 32 CFR 281

Legal Deadline: None

Abstract: This rule proposes policy and assigns responsibilities for 
settling personnel and general claims and for processing requests for 
an advance decision. The Legislative Branch Appropriations Act of 1996 
transferred to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget 
(OMB) the Comptroller General's authority to settle claims. The OMB 
Director subsequently delegated some of these authorities to the 
Department of Defense (DoD). Later, the General Accounting Office Act 
of 1996 codified many of these delegations to the Secretary of Defense 
and others and transferred to the OMB Director the authority of the 
Comptroller General to waive uniformed service member and employee 
debts arising out of the erroneous payment of pay or allowances 
exceeding $1,500. The OMB Director subsequently delegated the authority 
to waive such debts of uniformed service members and DoD employees to 
the Secretary of Defense. The Secretary of Defense further delegated 
his claims settlement and waiver authorities to the General Counsel. 
This rule implements the reassignment of the Comptroller General's 
former duties within the Department of Defense with little impact on 
the public.

CFR Citation: 32 CFR 22; 32 CFR 32

Abstract: This rulemaking is the Department of Defense portion of a 
multiple-agency action. The agencies are amending their rules 
implementing Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-110 
``Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements With 
Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals, and Other Nonprofit 
Organizations.'' The amendments to the rules incorporate updated 
language in Circular A-110 requiring Federal awarding agencies to 
ensure that all data produced under awards subject to the Circular are 
made available to the public through the procedures established under 
the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). OMB updated the Circular 
language in this way in October 1999, in response to a provision in 
Public Law 105-277. With this rule amendment to 32 CFR parts 22 and 32, 
the Department of Defense therefore will maintain policies on access to 
data produced under awards subject to Circular A-110 that are 
consistent with the policies of other executive departments and 
agencies.

Priority: Other Significant

Legal Authority: 5 USC 5584; 10 USC 2774; 32 USC 716

CFR Citation: 32 CFR 283

Abstract: This rule proposes policy and assigns responsibilities for 
considering applications for the waiver of debts resulting from 
erroneous payments of pay and allowances (including travel and 
transportation allowances) to or on behalf of members of the Uniformed 
Services and civilian DoD employees. The Legislative Branch 
Appropriations Act of 1996 transferred to the Director of the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) the Comptroller General's authority to 
settle claims. The OMB Director subsequently delegated some of these 
authorities to the Department of Defense (DoD). Later, the General 
Accounting Office Act of 1996 codified many of these delegations to the 
Secretary of Defense and others and transferred to the OMB Director the 
authority of the Comptroller General to waive uniformed service member 
and employee debts arising out of the erroneous payment of pay or 
allowances exceeding $1,500. The OMB Director subsequently delegated 
the authority to waive such debts of uniformed service members and DoD 
employees to the Secretary of Defense. The Secretary of Defense further 
delegated his claims settlement and waiver authorities to the General 
Counsel. This rule implements the

[[Page 64495]]

reassignment of the Comptroller General's former duties within the 
Department of Defense with little impact on the public.

772. REVIEW OF THE MANUAL FOR COURTS-MARTIAL (DOD DIRECTIVE 5500.17)

Priority: Substantive, Nonsignificant

Legal Authority: EO 12473; 10 USC 47

CFR Citation: 32 CFR 152

Legal Deadline: None

Abstract: The Department of Defense promulgates procedures implementing 
Executive Order 12473, dated July 13, 1984, calling upon the Secretary 
of Defense to cause an annual review of the Manual for Courts-Martial 
(MCM) and to recommend to the President any appropriate amendments. 
Through the annual review process, the Secretary of Defense assists the 
President in fulfilling his rulemaking responsibilities under article 
36 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ; chapter 47 of title 
10, United States Code). Under the direction of the General Counsel of 
the Department of Defense, a Joint Service Committee on Military 
Justice (JSC) is established with responsibility to conduct the annual 
review and propose MCM amendments. The JSC also proposes amendments to 
the UCMJ, as necessary.
 This rule updates part 152 to title 32, Code of Federal Regulations, 
``Review of the Manual for Courts-Martial,'' to reflect practice and 
procedures for conducting annual reviews and to change the annual 
review cycle from concluding with an annual report due to the General 
Counsel by December 31, instead of May 1. The change in the annual 
review cycle is due to legislative requirements on affecting JSC 
responsibilities. This interim rule is provided to afford a 60-day 
opportunity for public comment prior to issuing a final rule. This rule 
is intended only to improve the internal management of the Federal 
Government. It is not intended to create any right or benefit, 
substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by any party against the 
United States, its agencies, its officers, or any person.

Abstract: The Department of Defense (DoD) proposes to amend parts 21, 
22, 25, 32, 33, 34, and 37 of the DoD Grant and Agreement Regulations 
(DoDGARS) to implement four Office of Management and Budget (OMB) 
policy directives, to conform the DoDGARs with several statutory and 
regulatory revisions, and to make other administrative changes. The 
four OMB directives that are being implemented: Require Federal 
agencies to use a new standard format for announcements of funding 
opportunities; require Federal agencies to electronically post synopses 
of those announcements at a Governmentwide Internet site; require 
Governmentwide use of the Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number 
as the universal identifier for recipient organizations; and amend OMB 
Circular A-133 to raise the threshold of Federal funding at which 
recipients must obtain single audits. The statutory and regulatory 
changes with which the DoDGARs are being conformed concern matters such 
as nonprocurement debarment and suspension, drug-free workplace 
requirements for grants, and campus access for military recruiters and 
Reserve Officer Training Corps.

Abstract: Amends the Defense FAR Supplement to place restrictions on

of requirements are made with a view toward providing maximum 
practicable opportunity for small business concerns to participate in

These changes correct language for the new replacement lock. For the 
Little Goose Lock and Dam the Corps is making adjustments in the 
upstream channel restricted area boundary to provide a small craft 
portage route around the lock and dam along the north shoreline. This 
reduces interference between fisherman and the boat ramp.

Abstract: Currently, any individual who is a civilian employee of the

providers if they meet three conditions. First, they must be employed 
by the Government agency on a part-time basis; that is, less than 20 
hours per week. Second, the agency must certify that unique or special 
circumstances detrimental to the delivery of quality health care exist 
that can be overcome only by employing part-time, non-Government 
physicians. Third, the agency and the physician must certify that they 
understand and have taken appropriate measures to avoid violation of 
Standards of Conduct, dual compensation, and conflict of interest 
requirements including protection against referral of patients to the 
employee's private practice.

899. CIVILIAN HEALTH AND MEDICAL PROGRAM OF THE UNIFORMED SERVICES 
(CHAMPUS); DOUBLE COVERAGE

Priority: Substantive, Nonsignificant

Legal Authority: 10 USC 55; 5 USC 301

CFR Citation: 32 CFR 199

Legal Deadline: None

Abstract: This rule clarifies our double coverage policy for non-
institutional claims for beneficiaries with primary health insurance. 
TRICARE network, non-network but participating, and non-participating 
providers are all reimbursed differently under current procedures. This 
has had the unintended effect of discouraging TRICARE network 
participation since non-network but participating providers receive the 
most favorable treatment with respect to double coverage calculations. 
The Department proposes to revise double coverage reimbursement 
calculations by reimbursing all providers up to 100 percent of the 
CHAMPUS Maximum Allowable Charge after the primary health insurance has 
paid or 115 percent for nonparticipating providers.
