AGENCY: Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, Treasury.

ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) proposes to 
amend its distilled spirits plant regulations. Many of these proposed 
revisions are the result of comments submitted by the Distilled Spirits 
Council of the United States in response to a Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco and Firearms notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) published in 
November 1998. Other proposed revisions are a result of a comprehensive 
TTB review of the distilled spirits plant regulations. This NPRM 
supersedes the NPRM issued in November 1998. We believe the proposed 
amendments will modernize the requirements for operating distilled 
spirits plants and make the regulations easier to understand, thereby 
allowing proprietors of such plants to operate in a more efficient 
manner. The proposed regulations are also written in a plain language 
format to improve clarity.

DATES: We must receive your written comments on or before August 6, 
2008.

Notice to Readers--Impact of the Homeland Security Act on This 
Rulemaking

    Effective January 24, 2003, the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (Pub. 
L. 107-296, 116 Stat. 2135 (2002)) divided the Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) into two new agencies, the Alcohol and 
Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) in the Department of the Treasury 
and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in the 
Department of Justice. The regulation and taxation of alcohol beverages 
remains a function of the Department of the Treasury and is the 
responsibility of TTB. References to ATF in this notice reflect the 
time period prior to January 24, 2003, while references to TTB are 
after that date.

I. Background Information for This Notice

A. Distilled Spirits Plant Operations Under Current Law

    Distilled spirits taxation is a specialized area of Federal law. 
The following background material provides basic information about how 
distilled spirits plants operate and are regulated under Federal law.
Basis Definitions
    Distilled Spirits. The term ``distilled spirits'' refers to those 
products that contain ethyl alcohol and are generally the result of 
distillation. This term does not apply to wine and beer, which are 
products of fermentation. Examples of distilled spirits products 
include vodka, whiskey, gin, brandy, cordials, liqueurs, flavored 
brandies, and other similar products.
    Distilled Spirits Plants. The term ``Distilled Spirits Plant'' 
(DSP) refers to a plant at which distilled spirits are manufactured or 
produced, aged or stored, or packaged or bottled, either for beverage 
or industrial use.
Federal Laws and Regulatory Authority
    Federal law prohibits the manufacture or production of distilled 
spirits in the United States at other than a registered DSP that has 
received a permit from

[[Page 26201]]

TTB. While Federal law allows for the limited home production of wine 
and beer, no such exemption exists for distilled spirits.
    DSPs are regulated under the provisions of two laws, the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986 (IRC) (Title 26 of the United States Code) and the 
Federal Alcohol Administration Act (FAA Act) (Title 27 of the United 
States Code). The IRC imposes an excise tax on distilled spirits, 
requires plants to register, requires plants to obtain permits not 
otherwise required by the FAA Act, and imposes strict controls over the 
operation of DSPs. The FAA Act imposes a requirement to obtain a basic 
permit and contains various consumer-protection provisions, including 
provisions related to the formulation, labeling, and advertising of 
alcohol beverages. The FAA Act also controls various trade practices 
within the alcohol industry.
    Under these two laws, TTB regulates the distilled spirits industry 
in the United States. Each law authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury 
to prescribe regulations to carry out and enforce its provisions, and 
the Secretary has delegated this authority to TTB. The TTB regulations 
concerning DSPs are contained in title 27 of the Code of Federal 
Regulations, Part 19, Distilled Spirits Plants (27 CFR part 19).
Major Regulatory Provisions
    A DSP consists of one or more of the following: production, 
storage, processing, denaturation, and bottling facilities. A DSP may 
be a large and complex plant, having all facilities, a simple storage 
facility consisting of only one building, or a small bottling facility 
with storage facilities. Production facilities are usually accompanied 
by some storage facilities. Bottling facilities are often accompanied 
by storage facilities, and must by law be accompanied by either a 
production or a storage facility. However, large storage facilities are 
often not accompanied by either of the other two types.
    Registration. Before commencing operations, the DSP proprietor must 
obtain an approved notice of registration. This application for 
registration includes: documents to set up distilling apparatus, 
environmental impact forms, personnel questionnaires, signature 
authorities, and a statement of security.
    Permits. Under the FAA Act, all persons who intend to engage in the 
business of: (a) Distilling spirits; (b) rectifying, blending, or 
bottling (processing) distilled spirits; or (c) warehousing and 
bottling distilled spirits, must file for a basic permit.
    To maintain control over the industrial use of distilled spirits, 
the IRC requires that an operating permit be obtained before commencing 
the production, warehousing, or bottling of alcohol for industrial use. 
Specifically, a permit is required for:
    <bullet> Distilling for industrial use.
    <bullet> Bonded warehousing of spirits for industrial use.
    <bullet> Denaturation of spirits.
    <bullet> Bonded warehousing of spirits (without bottling) for non-
industrial use.
    <bullet> Bottling or packaging of spirits for industrial use.
    <bullet> Any other distilling, warehousing, or bottling operations 
not required to be covered by a basic permit under the FAA Act.
    DSP Bonded Premises. The physical premises of a DSP are divided 
into two technical categories: ``bonded premises,'' and unbonded or 
``general premises.'' All activities relating to the distilling, 
storage, and processing (blending and mixing) of distilled spirits must 
be conducted on bonded premises. All activities relating to taxpaid 
alcohol beverages conducted at the distilled spirits plant must be 
conducted on general premises.
    Operations as a distiller, warehouseman, or processor may be 
conducted only on the bonded premises of a DSP by a person qualified to 
carry on such operations under 27 CFR part 19 and who has obtained the 
basic permits required by 27 CFR part 1, or, as appropriate, the 
operating permit required by part 19. However, certain other 
activities, such as those of apothecaries, customs bonded warehousemen, 
manufacturers of nonbeverage products, and users of specially denatured 
alcohol, may be carried on outside of DSPs.
    The continuity of a DSP must be unbroken except for separations 
that may include public waterways, thoroughfares, or carrier rights-of-
way. In most instances, DSPs are also prohibited from being located in 
a dwelling house, in a shed, yard, or enclosure connected with a 
dwelling house, on board a vessel or boat, on premises where beer or 
wine is produced, in a retail liquor establishment, or where any other 
business is conducted.
    Bonds. Normally, the distilled spirits tax is not collected while 
spirits are held on the ``bonded'' premises of a distilled spirits 
plant. The potential tax liability of the spirits held on bonded 
premises is guaranteed by an operations bond, and taxable removals are 
covered by a withdrawal bond.
    The bond is a legally binding, written agreement involving three 
parties: the taxpayer, the surety (insurance or bonding company), and 
the U.S. Government. The purpose of the bond is to protect the 
financial interest of the Government. If for any reason, the taxpayer 
fails to pay the tax, then the surety (insurance or bonding company) is 
obliged to pay, up to the limit of the bond.
    Other Requirements. In addition to registering, obtaining a permit, 
and providing a bond, plants are required to comply with a number of 
regulations relating to plant security; the production, storage, and 
processing of spirits; recordkeeping; inspection and audit; and filing 
of reports. These requirements are outlined in 27 CFR part 19.
    Recordkeeping Accounts. All operations at a DSP are accounted for 
within three recordkeeping accounts: Production, Storage, and 
Processing. Since the facilities (tanks and rooms) of a DSP may be used 
for multiple purposes, the accountability of spirits must be maintained 
by appropriate records within the three accounts instead of physical 
separation.
    Payment of Taxes. The Federal excise tax on distilled spirits 
attaches to the spirits as soon as they are produced, and the distilled 
spirits plant is held liable for the tax on all distilled spirits held 
in the bond premises. The amount of Federal excise tax that a distilled 
spirits plant must pay is based upon the taxable removal of the spirits 
from the bonded premises. There are two basic methods of paying the tax 
on distilled spirits withdrawn from bonded premises-deferred payment 
and prepayment. Under the deferred payment system, the proprietor may 
withdraw spirits from bond after tax determination but before payment 
of tax. The excise tax paid is based on the amount of spirits removed 
from bond during each return period. Under the prepayment system, the 
proprietor must pay the distilled spirits tax after tax determination 
but before withdrawal of the spirits from bonded premises. Most DSP 
proprietors use the deferred payment system.
    Currently, the Federal excise tax rate on distilled spirits is 
$13.50 per proof gallon. The term ``proof gallon'' is unique to this 
particular commodity and means: a liquid gallon that contains 50 
percent ethyl alcohol.
    Although the tax rate for distilled spirits is $13.50 per proof 
gallon, many distilled spirits products are actually taxed at a lower 
rate. Many products contain wine and/or flavors, and the IRC at 26 
U.S.C. 5010 provides a credit for the wine and flavors content of the 
product. These credits effectively

[[Page 26202]]

reduce the rate of excise tax paid on distilled spirits products that 
contain wine and flavors.
    Nontaxable Transactions. Certain types of shipments to and from a 
distilled spirits plant are permitted without payment of tax. Examples 
are:
    <bullet> Shipments of bulk (unbottled) spirits from one registered 
distilled spirits plant to another. (Bottled spirits are not eligible 
for untaxed transfer in bond between plants.)
    <bullet> Shipments of bulk imported spirits from U.S. Customs and 
Border Protection custody to a distilled spirits plant. (Only bulk 
imported spirits are eligible for this type of transfer.)
    <bullet> Direct exports of products from the United States.
    <bullet> Shipments to users of industrial alcohol (certain permit 
holders who use alcohol for medical, research, or industrial purposes).

B. Notice No. 870 and the Petition To Amend 27 CFR Part 19

    On November 30, 1998, ATF issued a notice of proposed rulemaking, 
Notice No. 870 (63 FR 65720), that solicited comments on proposed 
changes to several sections of the regulations in 27 CFR part 19. The 
proposed changes included: (1) Delegations of authority, (2) removing a 
special tax provision, (3) liberalizing the requirement for approval of 
certain changes in plant personnel or procedures, (4) reducing the 
paperwork when plant premises are alternated with other premises, (5) 
providing for alternation of distilled spirits plant and brewery 
premises, (6) allowing denaturation and manufacture of articles to be 
done in a single, unified process, (7) specifying marks for packages of 
industrial spirits withdrawn taxpaid, (8) clarifying regulations that 
refer to a transfer record, and (9) incorporating a provision of an ATF 
Industry Circular regarding alcohol fuel into the regulations.
    In addition to these proposed changes, ATF asked for comments 
regarding the general recordkeeping system for distilled spirits plants 
prescribed in part 19.
    In response to Notice No. 870, ATF received extensive comments from 
the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States (DISCUS), a trade 
association representing distilled spirits industry members with 
interests in the U.S. market. While DISCUS provided comments on the 
specific issues raised in Notice No. 870, it also asked that ATF 
consider a broad range of regulatory changes to part 19. Essentially, 
in its comments on part 19, DISCUS asked ATF to initiate a complete 
revision of part 19. In support of its petition, DISCUS provided ATF 
with sample regulations that consisted of a ``markup'' version of 27 
CFR part 19, along with numerous copies of variances (alternate methods 
or procedures) that ATF granted to members of the distilled spirits 
industry over the years. Suggested amendments included a broad range of 
issues, including, but not limited to, reduced recordkeeping 
requirements for distilled spirits plants, greater use of commercial 
records, reduced reporting requirements, reduced requirements for 
reporting changes affecting the DSP's registration, liberalized use of 
DSP premises, storage of distilled spirits on bonded premises through 
``constructive segregation'' based on commercial records, and adoption 
of alternative methods in the regulations for universal applicability.
    In response to Notice No. 870, ATF also received comments from 
Equistar Chemicals, LP. Equistar is a producer of industrial ethyl 
alcohol, and its comments addressed issues in Notice No. 870 related to 
industrial alcohol. Equistar also commented on other issues affecting 
distilled spirits plants such as the amendment of plant registrations, 
recordkeeping, denaturation, and gauging.
    After reviewing the comments received in response to the Notice No. 
870, ATF concluded that the amendments proposed in the 1998 NPRM were 
not extensive enough to address the changes that have taken place in 
the industry since the last major revision to the distilled spirits 
plant regulations took place over 20 years ago when ATF implemented the 
Distilled Spirits Tax Revision Act of 1979, commonly referred to as 
``All in Bond.''
    As the successor agency to ATF, TTB undertook a comprehensive 
review of the distilled spirits plant regulations in 27 CFR part 19 and 
the comments received in response to Notice No. 870. This notice of 
proposed rulemaking is the result of that review, and this notice 
supersedes Notice No. 870. We believe the proposed amendments will 
modernize the requirements for operating distilled spirits plants and 
make the regulations easier to understand, thereby allowing proprietors 
of such plants to operate in a more efficient manner. A discussion of 
our new proposal to amend part 19 in a more comprehensive way follows.

C. General Changes Proposed in This Notice

    The following summarizes the general changes we propose to make to 
27 CFR part 19.
Plain Language
    On June 1, 1998, the President issued a memorandum that requires 
Federal agencies to write regulations in ``plain language.'' We fully 
support this initiative, and we have written these proposed regulations 
in the plain language style. In an effort to make these regulations 
easier to understand, we made several plain language changes to the 
part 19 regulations:
    <bullet> We use the active voice in the regulations, whenever 
possible;
    <bullet> We use shorter sentences, paragraphs, and sections; and
    <bullet> We minimize the use of jargon and unnecessary technical 
terms.
Structure of Part 19
    In its comments on part 19, DISCUS points out that part 19 is 
``excessively long, overcomplicated and very difficult to read.'' 
Further, it stated that the regulations are ``divided into 25 subparts, 
with many related and overlapping provisions included in two or more 
subparts.'' DISCUS recommends ``consolidating and re-grouping a number 
of regulatory provisions which are closely related, eliminating 
regulations which merely are redundant of each other or the statute, 
adding cross-references to related regulations, and clarifying 
regulatory language.''
    We reviewed the various sections and subparts in the current part 
19 and determined that much of the basic structure for part 19 needs to 
be amended. Under the current structure, information is not always 
located where a reader would logically expect to find it.
    For example, under the current regulations, information regarding 
distilled spirits taxes is found in two separate subparts, Subpart C, 
Taxes, and Subpart P, Transfers and Withdrawals. Subpart C contains 
much of the basic information about distilled spirits taxes, including 
the methods for calculating tax credits under the IRC at 26 U.S.C. 
5010. However, information regarding determination of taxes and the 
filing of tax returns is located in subpart P. Logically, all 
information associated with distilled spirits taxes should appear 
within the same subpart. The proposed regulations consolidate all of 
the information concerning distilled spirits taxes into a new Subpart 
I, Distilled Spirits Taxes. Similarly, we reviewed all of the major 
topics covered in part 19 and attempted to group them together in a 
more logical order. Accordingly, this proposed, amended version of part 
19 has been restructured with new subparts and related

[[Page 26203]]

information has been consolidated, where appropriate, into a single 
subpart. In addition, duplicative sections have been eliminated. The 
intent of this restructuring is to assist the reader and make it easier 
to locate related topics within part 19.
    The proposed subparts are as follows:
    <bullet> Subpart A--General Provisions
    <bullet> Subpart B--Administrative and Miscellaneous Provisions
    <bullet> Subpart C--Restrictions on Production, Location, and Use 
of Plants
    <bullet> Subpart D--Registration of a Distilled Spirits Plant and 
Obtaining a Permit
    <bullet> Subpart E--Changes to Registrations and Permits
    <bullet> Subpart F--Bonds and Consents of Surety
    <bullet> Subpart G--Construction, Equipment, and Security 
Requirements
    <bullet> Subpart H--Special (Occupational) Tax
    <bullet> Subpart I--Distilled Spirits Taxes
    <bullet> Subpart J--Claims
    <bullet> Subpart K--Gauging
    <bullet> Subpart L--Production of Distilled Spirits
    <bullet> Subpart M--Storage of Distilled Spirits
    <bullet> Subpart N--Processing of Distilled Spirits
    <bullet> Subpart O--Denaturing Operations and Manufacture of 
Articles
    <bullet> Subpart P--Transfers, Receipts, and Withdrawals
    <bullet> Subpart Q--Return of Spirits to Bonded Premises and 
Voluntary Destruction
    <bullet> Subpart R--Losses and Shortages
    <bullet> Subpart S--Containers and Marks
    <bullet> Subpart T--Liquor Bottle, Label, and Closure Requirements
    <bullet> Subpart U--Reserved
    <bullet> Subpart V--Records and Reports
    <bullet> Subpart W--Production of Vinegar by the Vaporizing Process
    <bullet> Subpart X--Distilled Spirits for Fuel Use
    <bullet> Subpart Y--Paperwork Reduction Act
Redundancy With the Law
    In its comments on part 19, DISCUS recommends that several sections 
of the regulations be deleted because those sections are ``redundant 
with the law.'' DISCUS notes that many of the sections simply repeat 
provisions of law contained in title 26 of the IRC. DISCUS recommends 
we delete these redundant sections of part 19 or revise the regulations 
to simply reference the appropriate section of the IRC.
    TTB recognizes that some sections of the part 19 regulations repeat 
provisions of the IRC. However, we intend that the part 19 regulations 
provide users with a comprehensive and complete body of the 
requirements for operating a distilled spirits plant. By making part 19 
a complete reference tool, persons researching a particular issue will 
not need access to both the IRC and the regulations. Therefore, when a 
provision of law affects operations at a distilled spirits plant, we 
included that provision in part 19. However, in some instances, we 
deleted sections of the regulations that simply repeated information 
found in other regulations within part 19.
Alternate Methods or Procedures.
    Periodically, TTB allows industry members to use an alternate 
method or procedure in lieu of a specific regulatory requirement in 
part 19. The current regulation at 27 CFR 19.62 describes how DSP 
proprietors may apply for an alternate method or procedure. Section 
19.62 also describes the criteria that TTB uses when evaluating such 
requests. Generally, TTB may approve the use of an alternate method or 
procedure when:
    <bullet> Good cause has been shown for use of the alternate method 
or procedure,
    <bullet> The alternate method or procedure is consistent with the 
intent of the regulation, and
    <bullet> The alternate method or procedure is not contrary to the 
law.
    Over the years, DSP proprietors have applied for a wide range of 
alternate methods or procedures in lieu of the requirements stated in 
part 19. We have evaluated these requests on a case-by-case basis using 
the criteria established in 27 CFR 19.62, and we have approved many of 
these requests. Industry members commonly refer to these alternate 
methods or procedures as ``variances.''
    As part of its comments on part 19, DISCUS submitted numerous 
copies of variances that have been granted to members of the distilled 
spirits industry. The variances submitted by DISCUS were divided into 
three general categories, recordkeeping, separation of premises, and 
``other.'' In its comments, DISCUS asserts that ATF granted variances 
from many of the regulatory requirements and that it is not aware of 
any variance that has caused any problems with Federal excise tax 
compliance. DISCUS recommends that variances granted to individual 
plant proprietors be extended to all plants in the revised regulations.
    In response to this suggestion, TTB reviewed the individual 
variances submitted by DISCUS for possible applicability to all 
distilled spirits plants. We found that many variances did, in fact, 
have general applicability to all plants. As a result, we have 
incorporated many of those methods or procedures into the proposed 
regulations, where appropriate. For example:
    <bullet> Several variances were issued that allowed for the use of 
computer-generated records. This proposal has been adopted into the 
revised regulations at Sec.  19.572 and is discussed later in this 
preamble under our discussion of Records in subpart V.
    <bullet> Several variances were issued that allowed for computer-
generated reports and computer-generated transaction forms. These 
proposals were adopted into the revised regulations at Sec.  19.634, 
and are discussed later in this preamble under our discussion of 
records in subpart V.
    <bullet> A variance was issued that allows for the filing of 
letterhead notices to report certain changes at a plant. This procedure 
providing for the use of letterhead notices has been incorporated into 
the new subpart E and is explained more fully under our discussion of 
subpart E.
    <bullet> Several variances were issued that allow for the use of 
``commercial records'' to record transactions and/or operations. The 
use of documents created in the ordinary course of business, rather 
than documents created expressly to meet the requirements of part 19 is 
now provided for in the proposed regulations at Sec.  19.572 in subpart 
V.
    <bullet> A variance was issued that allows modified 
``abbreviations'' to be used. The proposed regulations will not 
prescribe any official abbreviations for use on forms and records to 
identify spirits, and the provisions of current Sec.  19.726, which 
prescribe official abbreviations have been deleted from the proposed 
regulations. However, we will continue to list authorized abbreviations 
for marking containers found in the current regulations at Sec.  
19.612.
    <bullet> A variance was issued that allows filled, capped, and 
labeled bottles to remain on the bottling line at the end of each work 
day if the same brand and size will be produced on the next bottling 
shift. This variance was incorporated into the proposed regulations at 
Sec.  19.358 and is discussed under subpart N.
    <bullet> A variance that allows the bottling of liqueurs from a 
tank truck or tote was incorporated into the proposed regulations at 
Sec.  19.352 and is discussed under subpart N.
    <bullet> A variance whereby certain small tanks are not required to 
be mounted on scales was incorporated into the proposed regulations at 
Sec.  19.183 and is discussed under subpart G.

[[Page 26204]]

    <bullet> Several variances have been approved that allow for the 
use of meters in gauging spirits for purposes other than tax 
determination. We are proposing significant changes in the new 
regulations that will allow for the use of accurate mass flow meters, 
without prior approval by TTB, for bulk tax determination gauges and 
other required gauges at a distilled spirits plant if the meters meet 
certain criteria for accuracy.
    During our review of the variances submitted by DISCUS, we also 
found several that were not appropriate for incorporation into the new, 
revised regulations. In some instances, we did not wish to apply the 
provisions of a particular alternate method or procedure to all DSP 
proprietors without regard to their compliance history and other 
factors. As such, proprietors may continue to apply for these types of 
alternate methods or procedures, and we will evaluate them on a case-
by-case basis.
    For example, we have issued several variances to DSP proprietors 
regarding the timing and frequency of required inventories for bulk and 
cased spirits. In evaluating this type of variance, we frequently 
consider the compliance history of the particular plant, shortages and 
gains disclosed by past inventories, along with other factors. 
Accordingly, this type of authorization does not have general 
applicability and is not appropriate for inclusion in the new proposed 
regulations. However, we will continue to approve this type of request, 
when appropriate, on a case-by-case basis.
    In other instances, the subject matter of a particular variance 
only applied to a very specific situation at a single plant and was, 
therefore, not applicable to all plants. Accordingly, we did not 
incorporate this type of variance into the new proposed regulations. 
For example:
    <bullet> We approved several variances in regard to case markings 
that did not have general application to the case markings used by 
other plants.
    <bullet> We approved a ``business day'' for a plant that runs from 
2 a.m. through 1:59 a.m. This type of variance does not have general 
applicability to other plants.
    In summary, we have incorporated a number of existing variances 
into the proposed regulations where appropriate, and when the variance 
would have general applicability to the industry.

D. Specific Changes Proposed in This Notice

    The following is a discussion of the new, revised subparts in 27 
CFR part 19 and the specific changes that we propose to make in the 
part 19 regulations.
Subpart A--General Provisions
    Proposed subpart A includes several sections that have general 
applicability to part 19, including a revised definitions section, a 
section that defines the territorial extent of the regulations, and a 
section that identifies other regulations that relate to part 19.
    In the proposed definitions section at Sec.  19.1, we propose some 
minor amendments to the language used within this section to clarify 
the meaning of some terms. We also propose to add some new terms and 
delete an outdated term found in the current definitions section. We 
propose to add the terms ``accurate mass flow meter,'' ``general 
premises,'' ``letterhead application,'' ``letterhead notice,'' 
``National Revenue Center,'' ``TTB officer,'' and ``we.'' We propose to 
delete the term ``region director.''
    We also propose to move two sections currently located in subpart 
D, under the heading ``Activities Not Subject To This Part,'' to 
subpart A. The relocated sections are Sec.  19.4, Recovery and reuse of 
denatured spirits in manufacturing processes, and Sec.  19.5, 
Manufacturing products unfit for beverage use, which are currently 
found at Sec. Sec.  19.57 and 19.58, respectively.
Subpart B--Administrative and Miscellaneous Provisions
    Proposed subpart B contains the administrative and miscellaneous 
provisions for part 19 that are currently found in subpart D. However, 
some sections of regulations that are located in the current subpart D 
have been relocated to other revised subparts, where appropriate. For 
example, we propose to move sections relating to gauging to the new 
proposed Subpart K, Gauging. Similarly, we propose to relocate sections 
relating to the conveyance of spirits or wines on plant premises to the 
new proposed Subpart C, Restrictions, Location, and Use of Plants.
    Proposed subpart B includes a ``penalty of perjury'' section that 
is currently located at Sec.  19.100. In its comments on part 19, 
DISCUS proposes the deletion of the requirement that documents be 
executed under penalties of perjury from several sections of 
regulations. DISCUS states that ``these penalties are unnecessary and 
excessive in light of the fact that a proprietor's permit is subject to 
revocation under the Federal Alcohol Administration Act for failure to 
comply with the Bureau's requirements.'' TTB did not adopt this 
proposal. The penalty of perjury statement is an important safeguard 
that places legal responsibility for the truthfulness of significant 
documents filed with TTB on the documents' signatories. Generally, we 
do not require the ``penalty of perjury'' statement on most documents 
and records. Its use is generally restricted to claims, tax returns, 
applications, and similar documents. The IRC at 26 U.S.C. 6065 states, 
``Except as otherwise provided by the Secretary, any return, 
declaration, statement, or other document required to be made under any 
provisions of the internal revenue laws or regulations shall contain or 
be verified by a written declaration that it is made under penalties of 
perjury.'' Consistent with the IRC at 26 U.S.C. 6065 and along with the 
other tax collection agencies within the Department of the Treasury, 
TTB requires that such documents be signed under penalties of perjury. 
The penalty of perjury provision in the proposed regulations is located 
at Sec.  19.45.
Subpart C--Restrictions on Production, Location, and Use of Plants
    Proposed subpart C covers restrictions associated with the 
operation of a distilled spirits plant, along with the location and use 
of DSP premises. In its comments on part 19, DISCUS makes several 
recommendations affecting those sections of the current regulations 
that govern restrictions, locations, and use of DSP premises. We 
discuss these recommendations and our responses below.
    Restrictions regarding location. Currently, 27 CFR 19.131 provides 
that a distilled spirits plant may not be located on premises where 
beer or wine is produced, or liquors of any description are retailed, 
or (except as provided in Sec.  19.133) on premises where any other 
business is conducted. DISCUS contends that physical separation of 
commodities is meaningless and recommends that this restriction be 
amended to allow a distilled spirits plant to be located on such 
premises if the proprietor's records show the separate operations. We 
did not adopt this proposal because Federal law does not provide for 
``constructive'' separation of premises by records only. The language 
of this regulation is derived directly from the language of the IRC at 
26 U.S.C. 5178(a)(1)(B), which states that a distilled spirits plant 
shall not be located ``on premises where beer or wine is made or 
produced, or liquors of any description are retailed, or on premises 
where any other business is carried on (except when authorized under 
subsection (b)).'' This

[[Page 26205]]

provision appears in the proposed regulations at Sec.  19.52.
    Continuity of premises. Currently, the regulation at Sec.  19.132 
provides that the physical continuity of a distilled spirits plant must 
be unbroken except for separation by public waterways, thoroughfares, 
or carrier rights-of-way. However, TTB may approve other separations of 
the plant premises when all parts of the plant are in the ``same 
general location.'' DISCUS recommends that the term ``same general 
location'' mean within 200 miles of the distilled spirits plant.
    We did not adopt this recommendation in the proposed regulations. 
Although DISCUS states that a ``200 mile rule'' would provide increased 
operational flexibility for proprietors, they do not explain how this 
would occur under their proposal and why that distance is more 
appropriate than any other.
    Over the years TTB has received a number of requests to establish 
non-contiguous distilled spirits plant premises. We have evaluated each 
of these requests on a case-by-case basis. In our evaluation of each 
request, we consider a number of factors, such as:
    <bullet> Security and protection of the revenue,
    <bullet> Distance between the main plant premises and the proposed 
non-contiguous premises,
    <bullet> Whether the non-contiguous premises would cross State 
lines,
    <bullet> Whether the non-contiguous premises will facilitate 
inspections and audits, and
    <bullet> Whether establishment of non-contiguous premises would 
provide the proprietor with a means for delaying payment of taxes.
    We propose to retain the case-by-case analysis based on multiple 
factors, instead of adopting a 200 mile rule as proposed by DISCUS. As 
a general rule, we believe that the ``same general location'' must not 
be too large an area so that the revenue is placed at risk. Also, 
because a distance of 200 miles could extend over a multi-state area 
and would cross over into different field offices within TTB, such a 
distance would create administrative difficulties for TTB. This 
provision appears in the proposed regulations at Sec.  19.53.
    Other businesses. Currently, the regulation at Sec.  19.68 provides 
that TTB may authorize the carrying on of other businesses (not 
otherwise prohibited) on DSP premises under certain conditions. The 
other businesses should not pose a jeopardy to the revenue, hinder the 
effective administration of part 19, or be contrary to law. There is a 
similar section of regulations at Sec.  19.72. DISCUS recommends the 
removal of Sec.  19.68 since it is redundant with Sec.  19.72.
    We agree that Sec. Sec.  19.68 and 19.72 are very similar, and we 
have merged the two sections into a single section within the proposed 
regulations at Sec.  19.55.
    Bonded warehouses not on premises qualified for production of 
spirits. The current regulation at Sec.  19.134 allows for the 
establishment of a bonded warehouse on premises that are not qualified 
for the production of spirits, if the need for such is clearly 
established. DISCUS recommends the amendment of this section by adding 
language stating that the warehouse may be within 200 miles of the main 
plant. We did not adopt this recommendation for the same reasons 
discussed above under the heading, ``Continuity of Premises.'' This 
provision is found in the proposed regulations at Sec.  19.56.
    Taxpaid spirits or wines on bonded premises. The current regulation 
at Sec.  19.97 provides that spirits or wines on which the tax has been 
paid or determined may be conveyed across bonded premises but cannot be 
stored or remain on bonded premises, and must be kept separate and 
apart from spirits or wines on which the tax has not been paid or 
determined. DISCUS recommends the addition of new language to this 
section whereby the area where taxpaid spirits or wines are stored will 
not be considered bonded premises if the proprietor's records show that 
the tax has been paid or determined. They state that their proposal 
would ``shift the focus from the outdated requirement of physical 
segregation to a modernized, efficient approach based upon 
`constructive segregation.' ''
    We did not adopt this recommendation because the IRC does not allow 
for the separation of premises solely by records. The IRC at 26 U.S.C. 
5612 clearly states that taxpaid or tax determined spirits cannot be 
stored on bonded premises. Further, the bonded area of a DSP is a 
clearly defined physical area of the plant with clearly defined 
boundaries. It is not an area defined only by records of the type of 
spirits stored on the premises. In our proposed regulations, this 
section is now found at Sec.  19.58.
    Conveyance of untaxed spirits or wines within a distilled spirits 
plant. Currently, the regulation at Sec.  19.98 provides that untaxed 
spirits or wines can be conveyed between different bonded areas of a 
plant and across areas of a plant that are not bonded. DISCUS 
recommends the amendment of this section by adding language whereby if 
the proprietor's records show the tax has not been paid or determined, 
then the untaxed spirits will be considered to be on bonded premises 
(constructive segregation).
    We did not adopt this recommendation because the regulation already 
allows for the transfer of untaxed spirits across areas of a plant that 
are not bonded. The amendment proposed by DISCUS would only incorporate 
the idea of ``constructive segregation'' into this section of the 
regulations. However, since the regulation already allows for transfers 
across areas of the plant that are not bonded, the amendment proposed 
by DISCUS is not necessary. This section of the regulations is now 
found at Sec.  19.59 in the proposed regulations.
    Spirits in customs custody. Currently, the regulation at Sec.  
19.99 provides that spirits in customs custody may be conveyed across 
DSP premises under certain conditions. Those conditions include:
    <bullet> The spirits may not be stored or allowed to remain on DSP 
premises.
    <bullet> The spirits must be kept separate from other spirits on 
DSP premises.
    <bullet> The means and route of conveyance must be approved.
    <bullet> The proprietor must file a consent of surety.
    DISCUS recommends the addition of language to this section whereby 
if the proprietor's records show that spirits are in customs custody, 
then the area where the spirits are stored will not be considered part 
of the DSP premises.
    We did not adopt this DISCUS recommendation for several reasons. 
First, this section of regulations deals with conveyance of spirits in 
customs custody across DSP premises. It does not deal with the storage 
of such spirits on DSP premises.
    In addition, TTB bonded premises and customs bonded premises are 
two distinct types of bonded premises. TTB bonded premises are 
established under the laws and regulations administered by the Alcohol 
and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, while customs bonded premises are 
established under a separate set of laws and regulations administered 
by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. As such, the premises cannot be 
co-located, and there is no basis in the law for constructive 
segregation of these bonded premises by records only. The bonded area 
of a DSP is a clearly defined physical area of the plant with clearly 
defined boundaries. It is not an area defined only by records. In our 
proposed regulations, this section is now found at Sec.  19.60.
    Production of distilled spirits for personal use. Frequently, TTB 
receives

[[Page 26206]]

questions from the general public asking whether the law allows for the 
production of distilled spirits in the home for personal use. Under 
Federal law (26 U.S.C. 5171), distilled spirits may only be produced at 
a registered distilled spirits plant. Therefore, we propose to add a 
new section to subpart C, which will explain that a person may not 
distill spirits at home for personal use. This new section is found in 
the proposed regulation at Sec.  19.51.
Subpart D--Registration of a Distilled Spirits Plant and Obtaining a 
Permit
    The current regulations governing the qualification of a distilled 
spirits plant are found in subpart G. These regulations cover a number 
of issues, including the requirements for plant registration, operating 
permits, alternation of premises, and amending registrations and 
operating permits.
    Proposed subpart D covers the initial registration of a distilled 
spirits plant and procedures for obtaining an operating permit. We 
propose to assign regulations concerning changes after the original 
qualification of the plant to the new subpart E.
    In the proposed subpart D, we also propose to rearrange the 
information related to the qualification of a distilled spirits plant 
in a more logical order. For example, we propose to group all 
registration information together under a heading titled ``Requirements 
for Registering a Plant,'' while information relating to operating 
permits is grouped together under a separate heading titled 
``Requirements for an Operating Permit Under the I.R.C.'' In the 
current regulations, much of the information regarding registration and 
operating permits is intermingled. We believe that separating these 
subjects will make it easier for readers to understand which 
requirements apply to plant registration and which requirements apply 
to operating permits.
    Other businesses. In its comments on part 19, DISCUS proposes the 
inclusion of a cross-reference at Sec.  19.152 of the current 
regulations, indicating that ``other businesses'' may be allowed under 
a separate section of the regulations. We adopted this proposal in the 
proposed regulations at Sec. [thns<brit-pound> x p]19.73(b).
    Major equipment. DISCUS also recommends in its comments that the 
requirement to list major equipment on the application for 
registration, currently found at Sec.  19.166, be amended. First, it 
states that the regulation should be clarified to provide that ``major 
equipment'' must be identified in the registration only if it is ``set 
up'' and ``used for distillation, redistillation, or recovery of 
spirits.''
    We adopted this suggestion in part. We do not see any need to list 
major equipment in the application that is not ``set up'' and used for 
the production, storage, or processing of spirits. Therefore, we have 
inserted language in the proposed regulations at Sec.  19.75, which 
requires that equipment be listed if it is ``set up'' and used for the 
production, storage, or processing of spirits.
    DISCUS also recommends that a paragraph be added to Sec.  19.166 
stating that ``bulk containers of less than 101 wine gallon capacity 
and not meeting the criteria of a tank under Sec.  19.273 (such as 
perks and small totes) are not items of major equipment and are not 
required to be listed in the application for registration.'' This 
recommendation is reasonable because such containers are not items of 
major equipment, and we include it in the proposed regulation at Sec.  
19.75.
    In addition, DISCUS recommends that the requirement to provide a 
``statement of certification of accurate calibration'' for tanks found 
in the current regulations at Sec. Sec.  19.166 and 19.273(a)(6) be 
eliminated. This recommendation is reasonable and has been adopted in 
the proposed regulations because it only involves eliminating a 
requirement to include a ``statement of certification of accurate 
calibration'' in the notice of registration. The proposed regulation at 
Sec.  19.182 will continue to require that tanks be accurately 
calibrated.
    Registration file. The IRC at 26 U.S.C. 5171(c) requires that 
persons must apply for and receive a notice of registration before 
commencing business as a distilled spirits plant. In regard to the 
maintenance of the registration file, currently at Sec.  19.155, DISCUS 
recommends the addition of language to allow the registration file to 
be kept in computerized records. We did not adopt this proposal because 
registration documents are normally submitted to TTB in a hard-copy 
format and returned to the proprietor by TTB in hard-copy format. 
DISCUS also recommended the elimination of the requirement that the 
registration file be kept ``at the plant.'' We did not adopt this 
proposal because the file must be readily available for inspection by 
appropriate TTB officers.
    LLCs and LLPs. The current regulations governing qualification of a 
distilled spirits plant in subpart G only acknowledge three types of 
business organizations, sole proprietorships, partnerships, and 
corporations. In view of the increasing use of limited liability 
companies (LLCs) and limited liability partnerships (LLPs), we have 
included instructions for these types of business organizations in the 
proposed regulations at Sec.  19.93.
Subpart E--Changes to Registrations and Permits
    Proposed subpart E includes the regulations governing changes to 
the distilled spirits plant registration, changes to operating permits, 
and alternation of plant premises. Similar to the changes that we 
propose in new subpart D, much of the information in the new subpart E 
is arranged in a more logical order. For example, matters affecting 
changes to registration are grouped together under the heading titled 
``Rules for Amending a Registration,'' and matters affecting changes to 
operating permits are grouped together under the heading titled ``Rules 
for Amending an Operating Permit.''
    In the current regulations, much of the information regarding 
changes to the registration and changes to the operating permit is 
intermingled. As with new subpart D, we believe that separating these 
subjects will make it easier for readers to understand the specific 
requirements that apply to amending either the plant registration or 
the operating permit.
    Letterhead notices and letterhead applications. In its comments on 
part 19, DISCUS makes several recommendations regarding how proprietors 
should apply for changes to a plant's registration or operating permit. 
Generally, DISCUS recommends that, in most instances, the regulations 
allow proprietors to request changes by filing a letterhead notice. In 
its petition, DISCUS states that:

    Subpart G provisions regarding changes in the information shown 
in the original registration should be revised to eliminate 
unnecessary prior submissions and prior approval requirements. 
Similar to our alternation proposals, 27 CFR 19.180, 19.82 and 
19.183 (application for amended registration, change in name of 
proprietor and change of trade name, respectively) should be amended 
to provide that a proprietor file a letterhead notice reporting any 
change within 30 days after the change. Further, 27 CFR 19.184 and 
19.185 (changes to largest stockholders and changes in officers and 
directors, respectively) should be revised to provide identical 
treatment (i.e., reported in the next amended registration) because 
there is no reason to treat these changes differently.

    TTB agrees that we should simplify the amendment of registrations 
and permits wherever possible. Accordingly, we are proposing to expand 
the use of both letterhead notices and letterhead applications for 
reporting changes to the registration and permit. We will allow the use 
of letterhead notices to report

[[Page 26207]]

minor changes affecting the registration or permit. We will allow for 
the use of letterhead applications for more substantive changes but 
these must be approved by TTB prior to the change. The use of amended 
applications, letterhead applications, and letterhead notices are 
discussed in the proposed regulations at Sec. Sec.  19.112 and 19.126.
    Changes in the statement of plant security. In the current 
regulation at Sec.  19.153(b), an application for amended plant 
registration (form TTB F 5110.41) must be filed each time there is a 
change in plant personnel or procedures contained in the statement of 
security. In Notice No. 870, ATF proposed to liberalize this 
requirement. Therefore, we propose that Sec.  19.153(b) be amended to 
require that a letterhead application be filed for changes in the 
security procedures listed in Sec.  19.153(a)(1)-(4), and that a 
letterhead notice be filed for changes in the personnel listed in Sec.  
19.153(a)(5). Thus, the letterhead application or letterhead notice 
would replace the amended registration that was required each time that 
the information in Sec.  19.153(a)(1)-(5) changed. The plant 
registration would be updated on an annual basis to incorporate changes 
made during the preceding year.
    In its comments on Notice No. 870, Equistar Chemicals states that 
it endorses the proposed changes and would encourage any additional 
efforts to facilitate compliance through reducing nonessential 
paperwork. However, Equistar asks for some clarification of this 
proposal. It pointed out that the proposal allows companies to submit a 
``letterhead application'' and ``letterhead notice'' for changes. 
Equistar states that it presumes that we intended companies to simply 
send an informal letter notifying the agency of procedure or personnel 
changes. The company asks for a clarification of these terms.
    In response to this request for clarification, TTB advises that the 
terms ``letterhead application'' and ``letterhead notice'' refer to a 
letter from a company representative, with signature authority, on 
company letterhead (see definitions). The ``letterhead application'' is 
subject to TTB approval prior to the change; however, the ``letterhead 
notice'' is not subject to prior approval. These terms are now fully 
explained in the proposed regulations at Sec. Sec.  19.112 and 19.126.
    Equistar also points out that ``the proposal requires a letterhead 
application for `changes in any of the information' listed in the 
sections of the Statement of Physical Security that address procedural 
changes.'' The company states that a requirement to advise us of ``any 
changes'' is overly broad and could encompass non-substantive as well 
as substantive changes. Equistar recommends that we maintain the rule's 
original language that covers changes in ``procedure'' rather than 
``any changes.''
    The current regulation governing changes in plant security, which 
appears at Sec.  19.153, has been rewritten to clarify the type of 
changes that may be reported to TTB by letterhead application or 
letterhead notice. In our proposed regulations, this section is now 
located at Sec.  19.123.
    In its response to Notice No. 870, DISCUS states that it supports 
the proposal whereby a distilled spirits plant would file a letterhead 
notice instead of an amended registration for changes in the 
information provided under 27 CFR 19.153(a)(5). However, DISCUS 
recommends the deletion of the word ``security'' from the proposed term 
``security personnel listed in paragraph (a)(5).'' DISCUS states that 
the term ``security personnel'' is not used in paragraph (a)(5) and is 
not synonymous with the persons covered by paragraph (a)(5).
    We agree that the term ``security personnel'' is not an accurate 
term. Therefore, we propose deleting the word ``security'' from the 
proposed regulation at Sec.  19.76.
    DISCUS also recommends that the regulations conform their treatment 
of changes in Sec.  19.153(a)(1)-(4) to the proposed changes in 
paragraph (a)(5). DISCUS asks that the regulations allow these changes 
to be reported by a letterhead notice within 30 days after the changes. 
DISCUS states that the information required by paragraphs (a)(1)-(4) 
and (a)(5) concern the same issues, and ``no reason exists to subject 
subsection (a)(5) to different treatment than subsections (a)(1)-
(a)(4).''
    In response to this recommendation, TTB advises that the 
information at Sec.  19.153 is part of the data for an ``application'' 
for registration (27 CFR 19.152(k)). As such, the items of information 
provided under Sec.  19.153 are subject to pre-approval for initial 
qualification of a distilled spirits plant and continued qualification 
of each plant. Further, the items listed under Sec.  19.153(a)(1) 
through (4) represent crucial physical security features of a plant and 
must, therefore, be subject to prior approval by TTB. In contrast, the 
information required by Sec.  19.153(a)(5) is a listing of persons 
having responsibility for custody and access to keys for approved locks 
at the distilled spirits plant. Since plants are free to designate the 
persons responsible for such custody, this particular item of 
information is not something that needs to be pre-approved. Therefore, 
this item will be treated as a ``notification'' rather than an 
``application.'' These changes now appear in the new, proposed 
regulations Sec. Sec.  19.76 and 19.123.
    Change in name of proprietor. The current regulation at Sec.  
19.182 requires that the proprietor file an application to amend the 
registration and the operating permit whenever there is a change in the 
name of the proprietor. DISCUS recommends the amendment of that 
regulation to allow the filing of a letterhead notice within 30 days of 
the name change, and that the new information be included in the next 
application to amend the registration and the next application to amend 
the operating and/or basic permit filed by the proprietor. DISCUS also 
recommends deleting from the current regulations the phrase, 
``Operations may not be conducted under the new name prior to approval 
of the amended registration and issuance of the amended permit.''
    The provisions of the current regulation at Sec.  19.182 will be 
covered in the proposed regulations at Sec. Sec.  19.113 and 19.128, 
and the proposed regulations will no longer require the filing of 
amended applications. Instead, the proposed regulations will allow for 
the filing of a letterhead application. However, since a change in the 
proprietor's name is a substantive change, the proposed regulation will 
still prohibit operations conducted under the new name before TTB 
approves the letterhead application.
    Change of trade name. The current regulation at Sec.  19.183 
requires that the proprietor file an application to amend the operating 
permit when there is a change in the trade name of the proprietor. 
Operations may not be conducted under the new trade name until the 
amended permit is approved. DISCUS recommends the amendment of the 
regulation to allow for the filing of a letterhead notice within 30 
days of the change and no longer require an application to amend the 
operating permit.
    In the proposed regulation at Sec.  19.129, TTB will no longer 
require the filing of an amended application. Instead, the proposed 
regulation will allow for the filing of a letterhead application. 
However, since any change in the trade names used by the proprietor is 
a substantive change, the proposed regulations will still prohibit 
operations conducted under the new trade name prior to TTB's approval 
of the letterhead application.
    Change of stockholders. The current regulation at Sec.  19.184 
allows for the filing of an annual report of changes in

[[Page 26208]]

major stockholders except where the sale or transfer of capital stock 
results in a change in control or management. In its comments on part 
19, DISCUS recommends that the language of the regulation be amended to 
read, ``Changes in the list of stockholders furnished under the 
provision of Sec. 19.167(c)(1) shall be reported in the next 
application for amended registration on Form 5110.41 filed by the 
proprietor.''
    In the proposed regulations at Sec. Sec.  19.114 and 19.130 we will 
allow a proprietor to submit an annual letterhead notice regarding 
changes in major stockholders. Under the proposed regulations, the 
changes must be incorporated in the next application filed, unless a 
change of control occurs. If a change in control takes place, Sec.  
19.114 requires that the proprietor must file TTB F 5110.41, 
Registration of Distilled Spirits Plant, within 30 days of the change, 
and Sec.  19.130 requires that the proprietor must file TTB F 5110.25, 
Application for Operating Permit Under 5171(d), within 30 days of the 
change.
    Changes in officers and directors. The current regulation at Sec.  
19.185 requires that a proprietor file an application for amended 
registration on Form 5110.41 when there is a change in the list of 
officers or directors. DISCUS recommends that the regulation be amended 
to state that the proprietor will report the change on the next 
application on TTB F 5110.41 for amended registration filed by the 
proprietor.
    In the proposed regulations at Sec. Sec.  19.115 and 19.131, we 
propose to allow a proprietor to submit a letterhead notice at the time 
of the changes and incorporate the changes in the next application for 
amended registration filed on form TTB F 5110.41 and the next form TTB 
F 5110.25 filed.
    Permit transfers. In its comment on Notice No. 870, Equistar 
Chemicals asked that ATF (BATF in its comment) examine ways to minimize 
the paperwork and notice requirements associated with ATF permits when 
a change of ownership occurs. Equistar states:

    BATF should examine ways to minimize the paperwork and notice 
requirements necessary to transfer BATF permit ownership in order to 
facilitate a smoother and less burdensome transition to the 
acquiring entity. Because the Securities and Exchange Commission 
(SEC) obtains copious records on publicly traded companies, perhaps 
BATF could coordinate efforts with SEC in cases where the acquiring 
entity is a publicly traded company and obtain company information 
through existing government databases. Alternatively, BATF could 
also prevent duplication by allowing companies to submit their 
annual reports in lieu of filling out numerous forms and 
applications. Such solutions would simultaneously facilitate BATF's 
access to companies' business information and alleviate the burden 
on companies who must currently submit new documentation of standard 
business information to each governmental branch who requests it.

    In general, TTB agrees that we should simplify the amendment of 
registrations and permits wherever possible. For this reason, we 
propose to expand the use of both letterhead notices and letterhead 
applications for reporting changes to the registration and the 
operating permit.
    However, in regard to utilizing SEC filings in cases where there is 
a change in ownership or control, there are several problems. First, 
much of the information that a proprietor submits in support of a plant 
registration or an operating permit is specific to distilled spirits 
operations. As such, this type of information, except for some similar 
items of information, is not required by agencies such as the SEC and 
so copies of such submissions would be inadequate for TTB purposes.
    Adoption of formulas. The current regulation at Sec.  19.187 
provides for the adoption of formulas by a successor. DISCUS recommends 
in its comments on part 19 that the regulation refer to 27 CFR 5.28 and 
that the language in Sec.  19.187 which is redundant with Sec.  5.28 be 
removed.
    In the proposed regulations we eliminated Sec.  19.187 as a 
separate section of regulations and we have incorporated references to 
the adoption of formulas and Sec. Sec.  5.28 and 20.63 into the 
proposed regulations at Sec. Sec.  19.116 and 19.132.
    Changes in premises. The current regulation at Sec.  19.190 refers 
to several sections of regulations relating to alternation of premises. 
DISCUS recommends the amendment of these references to ensure the 
accuracy of cross-references to other appropriate sections in part 19. 
The accuracy of cross-references is important so we propose to amend 
the references at proposed Sec.  19.119 to reflect the new section 
numbers for alternation of premises.
    Change in operations. The current regulation at Sec.  19.191 
requires that a DSP proprietor file an application to amend the 
registration and operating permit if the proprietor wishes to engage in 
a new business involving distilled spirits. This section also applies 
to conducting other businesses on DSP premises. DISCUS recommends the 
addition of language to the end of this section stating, ``Applications 
may be approved as provided in Sec. 19.72.''
    In the proposed regulation at Sec.  19.120, we now include a 
reference to Sec.  19.55, which is the section of regulations relating 
to other businesses.
    Changes in construction or use of buildings and equipment. The 
current regulation at Sec.  19.193 requires a DSP proprietor to submit 
a letterhead notice prior to a material change in construction or use 
of buildings or equipment and then incorporate the change into the next 
amendment of the notice of registration. DISCUS recommends the 
elimination of most of this section because it is redundant with the 
general instructions relating to applications for amended registration 
found at Sec.  19.180.
    We did not eliminate this section because we do not believe that it 
is redundant. Similar to the other sections in this subpart, it 
provides specific instructions for amending the registration. The 
provisions of current Sec.  19.193 appear in the proposed regulations 
at Sec.  19.122.
    Procedures for alternation of proprietors. The current regulation 
at Sec.  19.201 covers the procedures that proprietors must follow when 
DSP premises, or part of the premises, are alternated between different 
proprietors. Alternation of premises refers to the formal, legal 
transfer of operations from one proprietor to another proprietor. 
DISCUS proposes to amend this regulation by eliminating the requirement 
to provide a diagram of the area of the plant to be alternated. 
Further, DISCUS proposes that language be inserted into the regulation 
that would allow the proprietor's production, storage, and processing 
records to be used to document the alternation of proprietors.
    We did not adopt this DISCUS proposal. Records of production, 
storage, and processing are used to record the details of production, 
storage, and processing activities at a plant. These records are not 
designed to officially document the alternation of plant premises from 
one proprietor to another proprietor. Further, such records would not 
identify the actual bonded areas of the plant that are alternated; only 
a diagram can provide this information. However, we did substantially 
rewrite this section of the regulations to clarify the procedure for 
alternating proprietors. In addition, the requirement to file Form 
5110.34 has been replaced with the requirement to file a letterhead 
notice with TTB when such alternations occur. The proposed amended 
section appears at Sec.  19.141.
    Alternate operations. The current regulation at Sec.  19.202 
provides for the alternate use of plant premises and equipment for 
customs purposes whereby the premises of the plant are

[[Page 26209]]

converted from TTB bonded premises to Customs bonded premises. The 
current regulation also requires that the proprietor file a notice on 
Form 5110.34 whenever the plant premises are curtailed or extended for 
customs purposes. In Notice No. 870 ATF proposed to substitute a 
letterhead notice for the filing of Form 5110.34 each time that 
distilled spirits plant premises are alternated for customs purposes.
    The current regulations at Sec. Sec.  19.203 through 19.206 provide 
for the alternation of distilled spirits plant premises with bonded 
wine cellar premises, taxpaid wine bottling house premises, general 
premises, and premises for the manufacture of eligible flavors. The 
current regulations also require that the proprietor file a notice on 
Form 5110.34 whenever the premises are curtailed or extended for these 
purposes. In Notice No. 870, ATF proposed to simplify this requirement 
by amending Sec. Sec.  19.203 through 19.206 to provide that after a 
proprietor has received approval for the alternation plan that defines 
the boundary of the premises to be alternated, the alternation may take 
place pursuant to records kept in a logbook. In Notice No. 870, ATF 
listed the requirements for the proposed logbook record in a new 
section of regulations at Sec.  19.781. In Notice No. 870, ATF also 
proposed to allow for the alternation of distilled spirits plant and 
brewery premises under the same conditions. Alternation of distilled 
spirits plant premises and brewery premises is not provided for in the 
current regulations.
    In its comments on Notice No. 870, DISCUS expresses support for the 
proposal to eliminate the requirement to file Form 5110.34 each time 
that the premises are alternated. However, DISCUS does not support the 
proposal to require a proprietor to prepare a logbook containing the 
information required by proposed Sec.  19.781 each time that the 
proprietor alternates premises. DISCUS states that ``this proposal runs 
contrary to the objective of effective regulatory reform; [sic] to 
replace formal recordkeeping requirements with reliance upon commercial 
business records maintained in the ordinary course of business.'' 
Further, DISCUS contends that the proposal does not eliminate the 
requirements for prior submission and prior approval or the requirement 
to physically segregate products by type (wine, beer, spirits, or 
flavors). It asserts that the requirement in the regulations to 
segregate products is burdensome and that companies can track, 
distinguish, and identify products and operations by computer. DISCUS 
also asserts that `` `constructive segregation' of product by 
computerized records protects BATF's regulatory objectives, without the 
inefficient use of space and time and effort inherent in requiring 
physical separation.''
    DISCUS recommends that the regulations allow alternation under 
Sec. Sec.  19.202 through 19.206 if the distilled spirits plant 
proprietor files a letterhead notice reporting the alternation within 
30 days after the alternation takes place. It also proposes that the 
proprietor's ordinary business records be used to substantiate the 
alternation and that we eliminate the requirement to physically 
separate products as currently required.
    For the reasons discussed earlier in this notice, TTB is not 
adopting these recommendations regarding dependence upon company 
records for segregation of goods and reliance upon ``constructive 
segregation.'' As stated earlier, the IRC does not provide for the 
separation of premises solely by records. Further, the bonded area of a 
DSP is a clearly defined physical area of the plant with clearly 
defined boundaries. It is not an area defined only by commercial 
records.
    Therefore, in this current notice we propose a new section of 
regulations at Sec.  19.142 to provide for the alternation of premises 
for customs purposes whereby proprietors will file a letterhead notice 
with TTB prior to any alternation of premises. We have also eliminated 
the requirement to file Form 5110.34. We do not agree with the DISCUS 
proposal that would allow notices to be filed up to 30 days after the 
fact. Thus, the proposed regulation at Sec.  19.142 will require that 
the letterhead notice must be filed prior to alternation of premises 
for customs purposes.
    In addition, we propose a new, single section of regulations at 
Sec.  19.143 that will provide for extension and curtailment of 
distilled spirits plant bonded premises with either general premises, 
an adjacent bonded wine cellar, an adjacent taxpaid wine bottling 
house, an adjacent brewery, or facilities for the manufacture of 
eligible flavors. Under our proposed regulations, proprietors will 
document such alternations in the record prescribed in proposed Sec.  
19.627 at the time the alternation occurs, and we will not require the 
filing of a letterhead notice with TTB or the filing of form TTB F 
5110.34. The record prescribed in proposed Sec.  19.627 will allow for 
the use of commercial records, when the commercial records provide the 
same information required by Sec.  19.627 and are retrievable and 
available for inspection by TTB officers. Because of the variability of 
commercial records, we believe that there is a need to provide minimum 
standards for the commercial records that document alternation of 
premises. Further, the proposed regulation at Sec.  19.143 will still 
require the segregation of products. We disagree with the DISCUS 
recommendation that would allow for the ``constructive segregation'' of 
products based on computerized records. This is not an actual 
segregation of product as required by law at 26 U.S.C. 5178(a)(1)(B) 
and 5612 and could result in the commingling of taxpaid and non-taxpaid 
product.
Subpart F--Bonds and Consents of Surety
    Proposed subpart F covers the bonding of distilled spirits plants. 
For the most part, this subpart contains the same information found in 
current regulations at subpart H, except that the proposed regulations 
are written in plain language.
    However, the proposed regulation at Sec.  19.163 will allow persons 
who operate more than one distilled spirits plant serviced by TTB's 
National Revenue Center to give TTB a single area operations bond that 
covers the operations of two or more distilled spirits plants and 
adjacent bonded wine cellars located within the same geographic area. 
For practical purposes this means that, since TTB's National Revenue 
Center services the entire United States, a proprietor's operations 
bond may cover all of the proprietor's plants in the United States.
    DISCUS did not recommend any substantive changes to these 
regulations in its comments on part 19. However, it did recommend that 
the requirement to execute a bond under penalties of perjury be 
deleted. This recommendation is not being considered in this proposed 
rule for the reasons discussed earlier in this notice.
Subpart G--Construction, Equipment, and Security Requirements
    Under the current regulations in part 19, construction, equipment, 
and security issues are covered at subpart I. In the regulations 
proposed by this notice, those issues will be covered in the new 
proposed subpart G. The following is a discussion of the changes we 
that propose in the new subpart G.
    Construction of buildings. The current regulation at Sec.  19.271, 
Construction of buildings, will not be included in the proposed 
regulations. We found that it simply repeats requirements already found 
in Sec. Sec.  19.281(a) and 19.281(b).
    Equipment. The current regulation at Sec.  19.272, Equipment, will 
also be deleted. We found that it simply repeats

[[Page 26210]]

requirements found in several other sections of the current regulations 
including: Sec. Sec.  19.152(h), 19.152(k), 19.153, 19.166, and 
19.281(a), (c), and (d).
    Tanks. DISCUS recommends that the requirement to permanently mount 
scale tanks on scales should not apply to tanks that do not exceed a 
55-gallon capacity. This proposal is reasonable because such small 
tanks are intended to be portable and there is no need to mount them 
permanently on scales. Therefore, we adopted this recommendation in the 
proposed regulation at Sec.  19.183(b).
    Continuous distilling system. We propose to eliminate the current 
regulation at Sec.  19.275, Continuous distilling system, from the 
regulations in the new proposed subpart G. The requirement for a 
continuous distilling system is already covered in the proposed 
regulations at Subpart L, Production of Distilled Spirits, and we found 
Sec.  19.275 of the current regulations to be redundant.
    Meters. During the course of certain operations at distilled 
spirits plants, proprietors are required to measure the volume of 
distilled spirits. When measuring spirits for purposes other than tax 
determination, the regulations require that the spirits be measured in 
a tank or a conveyance using calibration charts. The current regulation 
at Sec.  19.277 also allows for the use of meters when measuring 
spirits for purposes other than tax determination. However, in order to 
use a meter, the proprietor must first submit an application to TTB, 
along with technical data regarding the meter they intend to use. TTB 
must approve the meter prior to its use at a plant.
    In its petition and markup of part 19, DISCUS proposes the 
elimination of the prior approval requirement for meters. DISCUS states 
that this requirement imposes unnecessary and time-consuming burdens on 
TTB resources and the industry and serves only to delay operations at a 
DSP. DISCUS states that the proprietor should be responsible for using 
and maintaining accurate equipment.
    After careful consideration of this proposal, TTB has decided to 
propose significant changes in the new proposed regulations whereby a 
proprietor may use mass flow meters for all required bulk gauges at a 
distilled spirits plant, including bulk tax determination gauges, if 
the meters meet certain criteria for accuracy. This will reduce the 
burden on industry members and TTB while ensuring the accuracy of bulk 
measurements.
    Accordingly, the proposed regulation at Sec.  19.188(c) provides 
that a proprietor may use a mass flow meter for tax determination of 
bulk spirits if the meter is certified by the manufacturer or other 
qualified person as accurate within a tolerance of +/-0.1%. For all 
other required gauges of bulk spirits at a distilled spirits plant, a 
proprietor may use a mass flow meter if it is certified by the 
manufacturer or other qualified person as accurate within a tolerance 
of +/-0.5%. For both tax determination gauges and all other required 
gauges, the proprietor must make corrections for the temperature of the 
spirits being measured in conjunction with the volumetric measurement 
of spirits by mass flow meter. The proprietor must also test mass flow 
meters at least every 6 months to ensure that they are accurate within 
the required tolerances.
    Miscellaneous changes. In addition to the changes proposed above, 
TTB also proposes to make several editorial changes in subpart G that 
will make the regulations easier to understand. For example, the 
current regulation at Sec.  19.273, Tanks, has been divided into 
several shorter sections covering: (a) The general requirements for 
tanks, (b) scale tanks, (c) graduation of scale tanks, and (d) testing 
for accuracy. The proposed, shorter sections are found at Sec. Sec.  
19.182, 19.183, 19.184, and 19.185.
Subpart H--Special (Occupational) Tax
    On October 22, 2004, the President signed into law the American 
Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Act), Public Law 108-357, 118 Stat. 
1418. Section 246 of the Act amended the IRC by providing that, during 
the 3-year period from July 1, 2005 through June 30, 2008, the rate of 
special (occupational) tax imposed under IRC sections 5081, 5091, 5111, 
5121, and 5131 is zero. The effect of this provision is that 
proprietors of distilled spirits plants, including alcohol fuel plants 
and certain other proprietors, are not subject to special 
(occupational) tax during the suspension period. However, although the 
tax rate for the occupations affected by the suspension is zero during 
the suspension period, the IRC still requires that persons engaging in 
those occupations must register annually and comply with all applicable 
recordkeeping requirements. On October 31, 2005, TTB issued Treasury 
decision T.D.TTB-36 (70 FR 62238) which implemented this provision of 
the Act by amending the special (occupational) tax regulations in part 
19 and other affected parts.
    On August 10, 2005, the President signed into law the Safe, 
Accountable, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users, 
Public Law 109-59, 119 Stat. 1144. Section 11125 of this act repeals 
the special (occupational) tax applicable to proprietors of distilled 
spirits plants. This provision will become effective on July 1, 2008.
    The special (occupational) tax regulations proposed in this notice 
are located in proposed subpart H and are based upon the American Jobs 
Creation Act of 2004. Thus, they provide for a suspension of the 
special (occupational) tax through June 30, 2008. However, prior to the 
effective date of section 11125 of the Safe, Accountable, Efficient 
Transportation Equity Act, TTB intends to develop and issue regulations 
for all parts in title 27 of the Code of Federal Regulations that are 
affected by the special tax repeal provisions of that act. Therefore, 
the regulatory text in the final rule associated with this notice of 
proposed rulemaking will reflect the statutory provisions that are in 
effect when that final rule is published.
Subpart I--Distilled Spirits Taxes
    Under the current regulations, information regarding payment of the 
distilled spirits taxes is found in two separate subparts, Subpart C, 
Taxes, and Subpart P, Transfers and Withdrawals. Subpart C contains 
much of the basic information about distilled spirits taxes, plus the 
methods for calculating tax credits under the IRC at 26 U.S.C. 5010. 
Information regarding determination of taxes and the filing of tax 
returns is located in subpart P.
    Logically, all information associated with distilled spirits taxes 
should appear in the same subpart. Therefore, the proposed regulations 
consolidate all of the information relating to distilled spirits taxes 
currently found in subparts C and P plus several other miscellaneous 
tax provisions currently located in other subparts into a new proposed 
Subpart I, Distilled Spirits Taxes.
    General sections. In addition to consolidating the tax information 
currently found in subpart C and P, we have created several new general 
sections within the proposed subpart I. These new sections discuss 
issues such as deferred payment and prepayment of taxes, and the tax 
credits provided under 26 U.S.C. 5010. These general sections are 
intended to give the reader a brief introduction to some of the more 
complex subject matter within proposed subpart I.
    Gallonage taxes. In its comments on part 19, DISCUS recommends the 
elimination of several sections of the current Subpart C regulations 
that appear under the heading ``gallonage taxes.'' This includes 
Sec. Sec.  19.21, 19.22,

[[Page 26211]]

19.23, 19.24, 19.25, and 19.26. DISCUS states that these sections are 
redundant with the IRC.
    TTB agrees that many of these sections of regulations repeat 
provisions of the IRC. However, as stated earlier in this notice, we 
intend that the regulations in part 19 provide users with a 
comprehensive and complete guide to the requirements for operating a 
distilled spirits plant, and where appropriate, we will repeat certain 
statutory requirements in the regulations. We do not wish to 
unnecessarily require readers of these regulations to reference both 
the IRC and the regulations when researching an issue. Therefore, we 
propose to retain most of the information provided in current 
Sec. Sec.  19.21, 19.22, 19.23, 19.24, 19.25, and 19.26 in proposed 
Subpart I.
    Inventory reserve account. In its markup of part 19, DISCUS also 
proposes the deletion of Sec.  19.38, which provides for an inventory 
reserve account. The inventory reserve account is one of the optional 
methods that a proprietor may use for applying effective tax rates 
under the IRC at 26 U.S.C. 5010. DISCUS offers no explanation for 
deleting this section. In the proposed regulations, we retained this 
section in order to provide industry members with another option in 
determining the method for applying effective tax rates.
Subpart J--Claims
    Under the current regulations in part 19, the subject of ``Claims'' 
is covered as a subcategory of subpart C, Taxes. In these proposed 
regulations, we have relocated the regulations related to claims into a 
new, separate subpart J. Most of the changes to the regulations in 
proposed subpart J are relatively minor and are intended to improve the 
language and thereby make the regulations easier to comprehend.
    Under the current regulations governing claims, only distilled 
spirits that were withdrawn from a domestic distilled spirits plant may 
be returned to a distilled spirits plant and a claim filed. We propose 
to amend the language of the regulations in proposed Subpart J, Claims, 
and in Subpart Q, Return of Spirits to Bonded Premises and Voluntary 
Destruction, to reflect the fact that imported bottled spirits that 
were taxpaid or tax determined when imported into the United States may 
be returned to a distilled spirits plant and a claim filed. This change 
reflects an amendment to the law at 26 U.S.C. 5008(c), which became 
effective on April 1, 1998.
Subpart K--Gauging
    We propose to establish a new subpart K that will amend and 
consolidate gauging instructions that are currently located in several 
different subparts within part 19 at Sec. Sec.  19.84, 19.91, 19.92, 
19.93, 19.319, and 19.503.
    We believe that placing gauging issues within a single subpart will 
assist the reader in locating gauging information that was formerly 
located within administrative and miscellaneous subparts. We have also 
restructured several of the sections relating to gauging to make them 
easier to understand. We also propose to amend several of the 
regulations relating to gauging.
    Meters. Under the current regulations at Sec.  19.277(c), TTB may 
authorize proprietors to use a meter for measuring quantities of 
spirits for purposes other than tax determination. In order to receive 
authorization to use a meter for this purpose, Sec.  19.277 requires 
that the proprietor make an application to the appropriate TTB officer 
that includes technical data about the meter such as make, model, and 
the accuracy tolerance. TTB must then evaluate the data to determine 
whether the meter is suitable for the intended use before approving its 
use. The current regulations do not provide for the use of meters for 
bulk tax determination gauges.
    Under the proposed regulations at Sec.  19.284, TTB would allow for 
the use of mass flow meters for both bulk tax determination gauges and 
all other bulk gauges that must be performed at a distilled spirits 
plant. Further, the proprietor's use of mass flow meters would not be 
subject to prior approval by TTB. Instead, the proposed regulations 
establish standards of accuracy that a mass flow meter must meet for 
use in bulk tax determination gauges and a separate standard of 
accuracy for all other bulk gauges. As proposed, a mass flow meter used 
for tax determination gauges must be certified by the manufacturer or 
other qualified person as accurate within a tolerance of <plus-
minus>0.1%. A mass flow meter used for all other required gauges must 
be certified by the manufacturer or other qualified person as accurate 
within a tolerance of <plus-minus>0.5%.
    In its comments on part 19, DISCUS recommends amending the current 
regulation at Sec.  19.319(a) by deleting the requirement to use an 
``approved meter'' for volume determinations in the production gauge. 
We propose to change this requirement by substituting the term 
``accurate mass flow meter'' for the term ``approved meter.'' Thus, the 
volume determination on the production gauge can be made using an 
``accurate mass flow meter.'' This change appears in the proposed 
regulations at Sec.  19.289.
    For several years, TTB has seen an increased interest in the use of 
meters by proprietors of distilled spirits plants. Further, 
manufacturers of meters have improved the accuracy of their mass flow 
meters. The proposed regulations will give proprietors the opportunity 
to take advantage of the improved performance of mass flow meters and 
modernize operations at their plants without the need to seek prior 
approval from TTB.
    Spirits in receiving tanks. DISCUS recommends the deletion of a 
sentence from the current regulation at Sec.  19.319(a) that states, 
``Spirits in each receiving tank shall be gauged before reduction in 
proof and both before and after each removal of spirits therefrom.'' We 
did not adopt this recommendation because we need accurate measurements 
of spirits removed from production, including a measurement of the 
spirits before and after removal from the receiving tank. This 
provision is found in the proposed regulations at Sec.  19.289(a).
    Gauge record for packages filled. DISCUS also recommends the 
deletion of the requirement for a gauge record for each lot of packages 
filled, found in the current regulation at Sec.  19.319(d). We did not 
adopt this recommendation. We continue to need this type of information 
and we will continue to require a gauge record for each lot of packages 
filled. This provision is now found in the proposed regulations at 
Sec.  19.289(d).
    Other industry proposals. DISCUS also recommends that gauges no 
longer be required when spirits are filled into packages from storage 
tanks and when spirits are transferred between operational accounts. We 
did not adopt these changes in the proposed regulations. We believe 
that these gauges are still an important means of accounting for 
spirits within the plant.
    The current regulation at Sec.  19.91(b) covers the gauging of 
alcoholic flavoring materials when dumped. The regulation states that 
when proof of the flavoring materials is determined from a label or the 
manufacturer's statement, the proprietor must periodically test a 
sufficient number of samples and record the results in the gauge 
record. DISCUS recommends the elimination of the requirement to record 
those results in a gauge record. TTB has adopted this recommendation in 
the proposed regulations at Sec.  19.287. This is a relatively minor 
gauging requirement,

[[Page 26212]]

and we see no reason to require a record for such gauges.
    In its comment on Notice No. 870, Equistar Chemicals asks that the 
requirement in the current regulations at Sec.  19.503 and Sec.  30.43 
be clarified. The company states that the existing regulations appear 
to require the establishment of a separate tare for each package 
individually gauged. The term ``tare'' refers to the weight of an empty 
package. They propose that TTB allow for an average tare in order to 
facilitate packaging by reducing the time involved in recording a gauge 
and tare for each package. We did not adopt this recommendation. TTB 
requires an accurate gauge of spirits that are withdrawn from bonded 
premises. A package (drum, barrel, or similar container; see Sec.  19.1 
definition) is so large that the variance in tare can be significant. 
This means that the proprietor must establish the actual tare of each 
package to be withdrawn from bond. This requirement appears in the 
proposed regulations at Sec.  19.288.
Subpart L--Production of Distilled Spirits
    Under the current regulations in part 19, production of distilled 
spirits is covered at subpart J. In the regulations proposed by this 
notice, production issues will be covered in proposed subpart L. In its 
comments on part 19, DISCUS recommends several changes affecting the 
regulations that govern production of distilled spirits. Below is a 
summary of the recommended changes and TTB's evaluation of those 
recommendations. Also discussed is a proposed change to a regulation 
based on an amendment to the IRC at section 5222(b)(2).
    Notices. The current regulation at Sec.  19.311 requires a 
proprietor to file a notice on Form 5110.34 with the appropriate TTB 
officer prior to commencing, resuming, or suspending production 
operations. DISCUS recommends that the proprietor simply file a 
letterhead notice for such actions. This recommendation is reasonable 
because the filing of a letterhead notice accomplishes the same 
objective as the filing of a form. We adopted this recommendation in 
the proposed regulations at Sec.  19.292.
    Suspension of reports. DISCUS recommends that during periods when 
production operations are suspended, the regulations should not require 
proprietors to file reports of production under current subpart W. This 
recommendation is reasonable because TTB does not need to receive 
reports of no activity, and we adopted this recommendation in the 
proposed regulations at Sec. Sec.  19.292(c) and 19.632.
    Record of fermenting material. DISCUS recommends amendment of the 
current regulation at Sec.  19.314 by the deletion of the requirement 
to maintain a record of fermenting material removed from or used on 
bonded premises for other purposes. We did not adopt this 
recommendation. The IRC at 26 U.S.C. 5207(a)(1)(A) specifically 
requires that the proprietor maintain records of the receipt of 
materials intended for use in the production of distilled spirits, and 
the use thereof.
    Unfinished spirits. The current regulation at Sec.  19.316 
discusses the requirements for a continuous distillation system and 
redistillation of unfinished spirits. DISCUS recommends amendment of 
this section of regulation by the deletion of the requirement to 
determine the quantity and proof of unfinished spirits produced from 
distilling materials. We did not adopt this recommendation because this 
type of record is required by the IRC at 26 U.S.C. 5207(a)(1)(C).
    Entry gauge. DISCUS recommends amendment of the current regulation 
at Sec.  19.321 by the insertion of language that would allow the 
production gauge to be used as the entry gauge when spirits are 
deposited for storage or processing at the same plant and entered for 
redistillation at the same plant. This is a reasonable recommendation 
because a single gauge will be sufficient as the production gauge and 
the entry gauge and we adopted this recommendation in the proposed 
regulation at Sec.  19.306.
    Record of tests. DISCUS also recommends that the current regulation 
at Sec.  19.326 be amended by deleting a requirement to maintain a 
record of tests for the spirits content of chemicals produced by the 
production process. We did not adopt this recommendation. The 
proprietor is required by this section of regulations to test chemicals 
for spirits content. We believe that it is reasonable that the 
proprietor keep a record of such tests in order to document that the 
spirits content of chemicals removed from the premises does not exceed 
the 10 percent by volume limit imposed by the proposed regulation at 
Sec.  19.308.
    Production inventories. DISCUS recommends amendment of the current 
regulation at Sec.  19.329 by changing the requirement to conduct an 
inventory from a quarterly to an annual basis. We did not adopt this 
recommendation. For inventories that involve bulk liquids in tanks, one 
inventory per year is not adequate to accurately keep track of 
quantities on hand and detect losses in a timely manner. The shorter 
time period between inventories makes it easier for both TTB and a 
proprietor to reconcile any discrepancies and thereby protect the 
revenue. This requirement has been retained in the proposed regulations 
at Sec.  19.312.
    Receipts of beer. The current regulation at Sec.  19.312 provides 
that fermented material to be used in the production of spirits may 
include beer if it is produced at a brewery contiguous to the distilled 
spirits plant. Thus, under current regulations beer may only be 
received at a distilled spirits plant from a brewery that is contiguous 
to the plant. However, in 1997, Public Law 105-34 amended the IRC at 26 
U.S.C. 5222(b)(2) by removing the requirement that beer may only be 
received from contiguous brewery premises. Instead, 26 U.S.C. 
5222(b)(2) now provides that fermented material to be used in the 
production of distilled spirits may include beer conveyed without 
payment of tax from brewery premises and beer which has been lawfully 
removed from brewery premises upon determination of tax. This provision 
has been incorporated into the proposed regulations at Sec.  19.296.
Subpart M--Storage of Distilled Spirits
    Under the current regulations in part 19, the storage of distilled 
spirits is covered at subpart L. In these proposed regulations, issues 
related to the storage of distilled spirits will be covered under 
subpart M.
    In its comments on part 19, DISCUS recommends several changes to 
the regulations that govern the storage of distilled spirits. Below is 
a summary of the recommended changes and TTB's evaluation of those 
recommendations.
    Tanks. The current regulation at Sec.  19.342(b) states that if 
``spirits or wines are being deposited in a partially filled tank in 
storage on bonded premises, simultaneous withdrawals may not be made 
therefrom unless the flow of spirits or wines into and out of the tank 
is being measured by meters or other devices approved by the 
appropriate TTB officer which permit a determination of the quantity 
being deposited and the quantity being removed.'' DISCUS recommends 
that this subparagraph be deleted. We agree, and we have deleted this 
subparagraph from the proposed regulations because we consider this to 
be a common-sense issue rather than an issue that needs to be spelled 
out in the regulations. In addition, we believe that the requirement to 
conduct proper gauging is sufficiently covered in the proposed Subpart 
K, Gauging.
    Filling packages from tanks. The current regulation at Sec.  19.344 
states that

[[Page 26213]]

spirits or wines in a tank must be gauged before and after filling 
packages from the tank on bonded premises. DISCUS recommends that this 
section of regulations be deleted. We disagree with this 
recommendation. This type of gauge is needed in order to properly 
account for spirits in the storage account and thereby protect the 
revenue.
    Packages dumped for mingling. The current regulation at Sec.  
19.347 states that when packages are dumped for mingling, the 
proprietor must record such mingling on a tank record or tank summary 
record. DISCUS recommends that this section be eliminated. We disagree 
because the mingling of spirits needs to be documented on a record in 
order to properly account for spirits in the storage account and 
thereby protect the revenue.
    Mingling spirits or wines held in tanks. The current regulation at 
Sec.  19.349 states that when spirits of less than 190[deg] of proof or 
wines are mingled in a tank, the proprietor must perform a gauge and 
record the gauge on the tank record. DISCUS recommends that this 
section be deleted. We disagree because the result of such mingling 
needs to be gauged and documented on a record in order to account for 
spirits in the storage account.
    Storage inventories. The current regulation at Sec.  19.353 
requires each warehouseman to take a physical inventory of all spirits 
and wines in tanks at the close of each calendar quarter. DISCUS 
recommends that this requirement be changed to an annual inventory. We 
did not adopt this recommendation. One inventory per year is not 
adequate to accurately keep track of the quantity of spirits and wines 
on hand and detect losses in a timely manner. The shorter time period 
between inventories makes it easier for both TTB and a proprietor to 
reconcile any discrepancies and thereby protect the revenue.
Subpart N--Processing of Distilled Spirits
    Under the current regulations, processing operations other than 
denaturation and manufacture of articles is covered at subpart M. In 
these proposed regulations, the processing of distilled spirits will be 
covered under proposed subpart N. Denaturation of spirits and 
manufacture of articles will be covered under proposed subpart O.
    In its comments on part 19, DISCUS recommends several changes to 
the regulations that govern the processing of distilled spirits. Below 
is a summary of its recommended changes and TTB's evaluation of those 
recommendations.
    Receipt of spirits. DISCUS recommends amendment of the current 
regulation at Sec.  19.372(b) by adding a sentence allowing the 
shipper's gauge for bulk spirits to be used as the receiving gauge. We 
did not adopt this proposal. This suggested change would eliminate the 
receiving gauge for transfers in bond of bulk spirits and there would 
be no basis for determining whether a loss of spirits occurred during 
the shipment, thereby posing a jeopardy to the revenue.
    Bottling tanks. The current regulation at Sec.  19.382 requires 
that spirits be bottled from bottling tanks. However, TTB can authorize 
bottling from original packages or special containers if the proprietor 
files a notice with TTB explaining such need. DISCUS recommends that 
language be inserted into this section that would allow liqueurs to be 
bottled from a tank truck or tote without our prior approval. TTB has 
previously approved several requests for the bottling of liqueurs 
directly from tank trucks or totes because this is a reasonable method 
for handling products such as liqueurs and we adopted this 
recommendation in the proposed regulation at Sec.  19.352.
    Alcohol content and fill. The current regulation at Sec.  19.386 
requires that proprietors conduct proof and fill checks of bottled 
spirits at regular intervals and record the results of those tests. 
These tests are conducted to ensure that the actual proof and fill of 
bottled spirits agree with the alcohol content and quantity stated on 
the label. DISCUS recommends that proprietors no longer be required to 
record the results of those tests as required by Sec.  19.386(c). We 
did not adopt this recommendation in the proposed regulations. We 
believe that the recording of the proof and fill checks is important 
because it documents whether the proprietor is properly conducting the 
tests as required by the regulation.
    Completion of bottling. The current regulation at Sec.  19.387 
requires that when the contents of a bottling tank are not completely 
bottled at the end of the day, the proprietor must make entries on the 
bottling and packaging record covering the total quantity bottled that 
day. DISCUS recommends that this requirement be deleted from the 
regulations. We did not adopt this recommendation. The bottling and 
packaging record represents a record of bottling and packaging activity 
at the plant and the record should reflect the bottling and packaging 
activity that takes place on a daily basis.
    Bottles on the bottling line at the end of the work day. In its 
comments on part 19, DISCUS states that when the bottling of a 
particular product run is not completed by the end of the day and is to 
be resumed on the following work day, Sec.  19.388(a)(1) requires 
removal of all bottles on the line and packing them in cases that must 
be sealed. DISCUS recommends that TTB allow proprietors to keep filled 
bottles on the line at the end of the work day, if the same sized 
product will be produced on the next bottling shift. DISCUS states that 
proprietors can save substantial amounts of money if this proposal is 
adopted in the regulations. After careful consideration, we believe 
that this proposal is reasonable because it will save both time and 
expense for proprietors without jeopardizing the revenue. Therefore, we 
are proposing this change in the proposed regulation at Sec.  
19.358(b).
    Remnants. The current regulation at Sec.  19.389 covers remnant 
bottles that remain after the completion of bottling. Remnants are the 
few bottles that may remain after completion of bottling. This 
regulation requires that notations be made on the bottling record 
regarding remnant bottles. In their proposal, DISCUS recommends that we 
delete some of the recordkeeping provisions that relate to remnant 
bottles. Their suggestion is reasonable because it will eliminate 
paperwork for the proprietor without jeopardizing the revenue. We are 
proposing this change in the proposed regulation at Sec.  19.359.
    Filling packages. The current regulation at Sec.  19.390 requires 
that spirits filled into packages on processing premises be gauged and 
the results recorded on a package gauge record. DISCUS recommends that 
this requirement be eliminated. We did not adopt this recommendation 
because without such a gauge, there would be no record of the amount of 
spirits filled into packages.
    Daily summary record. The current regulation at Sec.  19.400 
requires that a daily summary record of bottling and packaging be 
prepared as required by Sec.  19.751. DISCUS recommends that this 
section be deleted. While no specific reason was given, this 
recommendation to delete Sec.  19.400 appears to be part of the general 
proposal by DISCUS to eliminate all daily records. We did not adopt 
this recommendation. Our reasons for maintaining daily records are 
explained in our discussion of Subpart V, Records and Reports.
    While we did not retain Sec.  19.400 as a separate section in the 
proposed regulations, it has been combined with the current regulation 
at Sec.  19.384, Preparation of bottling or packaging

[[Page 26214]]

record. The new combined section will now appear at Sec.  19.354.
    Bulk inventories. The current regulation at Sec.  19.401 requires 
that the proprietor conduct a physical inventory of bulk wine and 
spirits in the processing account at the close of each calendar 
quarter. DISCUS recommends that this requirement be changed to an 
annual inventory. We did not adopt this recommendation. One inventory 
per year is not adequate to accurately keep track of the quantity of 
spirits and wines on hand and detect losses in a timely manner. The 
shorter time period between inventories makes it easier for both TTB 
and a proprietor to reconcile any discrepancies and thereby protect the 
revenue.
    Inventory of bottled and packaged spirits. The current regulation 
at Sec.  19.402 requires that the proprietor conduct a physical 
inventory of bottled and packaged spirits twice each year. DISCUS 
recommends that this requirement be changed to once a year. We did not 
adopt this recommendation. There is already an allowance in the current 
regulation at Sec.  19.402 whereby the proprietor may request 
permission to conduct a single inventory each year. TTB believes that a 
single inventory may be adequate for some plants, but it is not 
adequate for others. Approval to take a single inventory may be 
obtained provided the proprietor maintains accurate records and an 
annual inventory will not make protecting the revenue more difficult. 
To require only one inventory per year in all cases in the regulations 
would weaken TTB's control and protection of the revenue in those 
plants where more than one inventory per year is desirable.
    Variations in fill. The current regulation at Sec.  19.386 provides 
criteria for slight variations in the alcohol content and the fill of 
bottled distilled spirits that may occur during bottling operations. 
Acceptable variations in alcohol content (proof) are well defined and 
very specific in the regulation at Sec.  19.386(b). However, this is 
not the case for variations in fill. As stated in Sec.  19.386(b), the 
proprietor must rebottle, recondition, or relabel spirits if the bottle 
contents do not agree with the label, ``except for such variation as 
may occur in filling conducted in compliance with good commercial 
practice with an overall objective of maintaining 100 percent fill for 
spirits bottled.'' We believe that this criteria could be improved and 
we propose to establish a standard whereby there must be approximately 
the same number of overfills and underfills for each lot bottled and in 
no case may the quantity in a bottle vary by more than plus or minus 
two percent from the quantity stated on the label. This new 
clarification appears in the proposed regulation at Sec.  19.356(b).
Subpart O--Denaturing Operations and Manufacture of Articles
    Under the current regulations in part 19, denaturing operations are 
covered under subpart N. In these proposed regulations, denaturing 
operations will be covered under proposed subpart O. In their 
individual responses to Notice No. 870, DISCUS and Equistar Chemicals 
proposed changes to the regulations governing denaturation. Below is a 
discussion of the recommended changes and TTB's evaluation of those 
recommendations.
    Gauge for denaturation. The current regulation at Sec.  19.454 
states that the measurement of spirits and denaturants shall be made by 
volume, weight, approved meter, or, when approved by the Director, by 
other devices or methods. In its markup of part 19, submitted in 
response to Notice No. 870, DISCUS recommends that the term 
``approved'' meter be deleted. We believe it is important to still 
require that distilled spirits plants use measurement devices that are 
accurate, and although we propose deleting the word ``approved'' as 
recommended by DISCUS, we are proposing to change the regulation to 
allow for the use of an ``accurate mass flow meter'' in the proposed 
regulation at Sec.  19.383. As discussed earlier in this notice, TTB 
proposes to allow for the use of ``accurate mass flow meters,'' without 
prior approval by TTB, if they meet certain criteria for accuracy.
    Denatured spirits inventory. DISCUS recommends the amendment of the 
regulation at Sec.  19.464 by changing the requirement to conduct an 
inventory from quarterly to annually. We did not adopt this 
recommendation in the proposed rule. The shorter time period between 
inventories makes it easier for both TTB and a proprietor to reconcile 
discrepancies and thereby protect the revenue.
    Denaturation and article manufacture. In Notice No. 870, ATF 
advised that under Sec.  19.454 gauging is required before and after 
denaturation. This prevents a distilled spirits plant from conducting 
denaturation and article manufacture in a single, unified process 
because the proprietor must gauge the spirits after denaturation and 
before making an article. In Notice No. 870, ATF proposed to amend the 
current regulation at Sec.  19.454 to provide proprietors with greater 
flexibility to conduct denaturation and article manufacture in a 
single, unified process. ATF also proposed to provide a prescribed 
method of computation to accurately determine the quantity of denatured 
spirits used and produced.
    Equistar Chemicals wrote in support of the proposal to allow for a 
unified process for denaturation and article manufacture. However, the 
company suggested that the regulations continue to allow for 
measurements by volume, meter, or other approved methods, and it 
suggested alternative language for Sec.  19.454. Equistar's suggestion 
is included in these proposed regulations with some modification; i.e., 
we will not prescribe a weight calculation as the sole means for 
determining the quantity of specially denatured alcohol produced when 
denaturation and article manufacture occur in a single process. These 
changes appear in the proposed regulations at Sec.  19.383.
    Filling containers from tanks. In its comments on Notice No. 870, 
Equistar recommends amendment of the current regulation at Sec.  
19.462, Filling of containers from tanks. This regulation requires 
companies to record a gauge measurement both before and after 
withdrawing spirits from a tank. Equistar suggests that the regulations 
eliminate the requirement for the first gauge measurement and simply 
allow the second, after-withdrawal gauge measurement to serve as the 
starting measurement for the second withdrawal. This proposal is 
reasonable because a single gauge may serve both purposes, and we are 
proposing to amend the regulations at Sec.  19.389 to reflect that 
change.
Subpart P--Transfers, Receipts, and Withdrawals
    Proposed subpart P will cover several issues, including transfers 
in bond, receipts from customs custody, withdrawals without payment of 
tax, withdrawal free of tax, samples of spirits, and securing of 
conveyances. Sections of the current regulations related to withdrawal 
on determination and payment of tax have been moved to proposed Subpart 
I, Distilled Spirits Taxes. Below is a discussion of several changes to 
the regulations that we are proposing in the new subpart P.
    General. We propose to add a new ``General'' section to the 
regulations that will identify the subject matter covered in the new 
subpart P. This new section appears in the proposed regulations at 
Sec.  19.401.
    Consignee premises. The current regulation at Sec.  19.510, 
Consignee premises, contains several references to Form 703. The Form 
703 was formerly used for the transfer in bond of wine, but it is now 
obsolete. References to the

[[Page 26215]]

Form 703 have been removed from the proposed regulations at Sec.  
19.407, Consignee premises.
    Receipt of Transfers in Bond by Consignees. The current regulation 
at Sec.  19.510 requires that when spirits, denatured spirits, or wines 
are received by transfer in bond, the consignee is required, among 
other things, to examine the conveyance, check the seals for tampering, 
gauge, and record the receipt of the shipment. TTB has always 
interpreted this section to mean that when the shipment arrives at the 
consignee premises or the carrier has completed its transportation of 
the shipment, such as when a rail carrier delivers a tank car to a rail 
siding on or adjacent to the plant premises, the transfer in bond is 
complete and the consignee must gauge and record the shipment as 
received.
    However, during the course of some recent on-site field audits, TTB 
has discovered a number of instances in which distilled spirits plant 
proprietors failed to timely gauge and record the receipt of bulk 
distilled spirits transferred in bond. Some proprietors have chosen to 
apply an alternate interpretation to the term, ``received,'' as used in 
the regulation, and they believe that they can delay required gauges 
and recordkeeping until after testing and formally accepting title to 
the spirits, which may take several weeks or longer after the date of 
actual delivery. In other words, some industry members have decided 
that the physical arrival of a shipment does not constitute receipt of 
the shipment, and they believe that they may decide when the shipment 
is ``received.''
    TTB believes that the meaning of the current regulation is clear 
and that the term ``received'' means that the shipment has physically 
arrived at its destination. In fact, the language of the current 
regulation also uses the phrase ``upon arrival at his premises''.
    However, in order to further clarify the meaning of the regulation, 
the proposed regulation at Sec.  19.407, which governs actions to be 
taken by a consignee upon receipt of a shipment, has been amended to 
emphasize the ``arrival'' of a shipment at the consignee's plant or at 
a location which represents the final destination for the carrier. 
Thus, it should be clear that shipments that physically arrive at the 
consignee's plant or rail sidings at or near the consignee's plant have 
been received and must be recorded as such. As proposed, the amended 
regulation at Sec.  19.407 will use the following phrase to describe 
the time when the shipment is received, ``[U]pon arrival of an in bond 
shipment at the consignee's premises or at the destination point 
specified in the carrier's transportation documents, the consignee must 
* * *.'' TTB believes that this amended language will clarify the 
current meaning of the regulation.
    Determination of tare. The current regulation at Sec.  19.503 
discusses determination of tare when packages are to be individually 
gauged for withdrawal from bonded premises. In the proposed 
regulations, this section has been moved to Subpart K, Gauging, and now 
appears at Sec.  19.288.
    Disposition of excess spirits. In the current regulation at Sec.  
19.539, there are instructions for Government agencies regarding the 
disposition of excess spirits that were withdrawn from a distilled 
spirits plant free of tax. This section has been deleted from the 
proposed regulations because these instructions are properly covered in 
27 CFR 20.246 and 22.176.
    Securing of Conveyances. The current regulation at Sec.  19.96 
requires that securing devices used on conveyances in which spirits are 
transferred in bond, or withdrawn free of tax or withdrawn without 
payment of tax, require approval by the appropriate TTB officer before 
use. However, securing devices that meet the criteria described in 
Sec.  19.96 do not require prior approval by TTB. Currently, the 
securing devices that do not require prior approval by TTB include cap 
seals and ball-strap-type (railroad) seals. The proposed regulation at 
Sec.  19.441 has been amended to also allow for the use of locking 
security cables without prior approval by TTB.
Subpart Q--Return of Spirits to Bonded Premises and Voluntary 
Destruction
    Under the current regulations in part 19, issues relating to the 
return of spirits to bonded premises and voluntary destruction are 
covered under subpart U. In these proposed regulations, these subjects 
will be covered in a new subpart Q. Below is a discussion of several 
changes to the regulations that we are proposing in the new subpart Q.
    Imported spirits. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 amended the IRC 
at 26 U.S.C. 5008(c)(1) by allowing a credit or refund of tax to be 
granted for imported bottled spirits that are returned to a distilled 
spirits plant. The proposed regulation at Sec.  19.452 provides that a 
proprietor may return tax paid or tax determined spirits to bonded 
premises that were tax paid upon importation through U.S. Customs and 
Border Protection. As discussed earlier in this notice, conforming 
changes were also made in Subpart J, Claims.
    Returns to bond. The new subpart Q has been substantially revised 
to make clearer the types of spirits, denatured spirits, and articles 
that may be returned to bonded premises. In addition, we propose to 
replace several sections of regulations with a chart for easier 
reference and use. We have incorporated Sec. Sec.  19.683 through 
19.686 of the current regulations into the proposed chart at Sec.  
19.454.
    Voluntary destructions. In its suggested changes to part 19, DISCUS 
recommends that the section of regulations dealing with voluntary 
destructions at Sec.  19.691 include a subparagraph that references the 
filing of claims. We did not include this recommendation in the 
proposed regulations because the filing of claims is already covered in 
the new subpart J of the proposed regulations.
Subpart R--Losses and Shortages
    Under the current regulations in part 19, losses and shortages are 
covered in subpart Q. In the proposed regulations, these subjects will 
be covered in a new subpart R. In its comments on part 19, DISCUS 
recommends several changes affecting the regulations governing losses 
and shortages. Below is a summary of the suggested DISCUS changes and 
TTB's evaluation of those recommendations.
    Losses in general. DISCUS recommends the elimination Sec.  19.561 
of the current regulations because it is redundant with the statute. 
TTB agrees that this section of the regulations repeats provisions 
covered in the IRC. However, the regulations in part 19 are intended to 
provide users with a comprehensive and complete guide to the 
requirements for operating a distilled spirits plant. TTB does not 
consider it appropriate to require readers of these regulations to 
reference both the IRC and the regulations when seeking guidance on an 
issue. Therefore, the information provided in the current regulations 
at Sec.  19.561 will appear in the proposed regulations at Sec.  
19.461.
    Determination of losses in bond, loss of spirits from packages. 
DISCUS recommends that the current regulations at Sec. Sec.  19.562 and 
19.563 be moved to the claims subpart within part 19. We disagree with 
this suggestion. These sections deal with the determination of losses 
in bond and are appropriately located in the subpart for losses and 
shortages.
    Loss of spirits from packages. DISCUS recommends amendment of the 
current regulation at Sec.  19.563 by replacing a reference to the 
regulation at Sec.  19.561(b) with a reference to the IRC at 26 U.S.C. 
5008(a)(1)(A). Apparently, they recommended this change because they 
had earlier proposed to eliminate

[[Page 26216]]

Sec.  19.561 from the regulations altogether. Since we did not 
eliminate Sec.  19.561, (now proposed Sec.  19.461), there is no need 
to replace the reference to it with a reference to the statute.
    Losses after tax determination. DISCUS recommends elimination of 
Sec.  19.564, Losses after tax determination, because it is redundant 
with the statute and other rules, and it recommends the transfer of 
part of the text to Sec.  19.43, Claims relating to spirits lost after 
tax determination. In the proposed regulations, we have retained this 
section at Sec.  19.464; however, we have substantially shortened it, 
and it now refers to subpart J where claims for losses after tax 
determination are covered. TTB proposes to continue this provision 
because it is inappropriate to require readers of these regulations to 
reference both the IRC and the regulations when seeking guidance on an 
issue.
Subpart S--Containers and Marks
    Proposed subpart S covers requirements for containers and marks 
that are covered in the current regulations at subpart R. In the new 
subpart S, much of the information regarding containers and marks has 
been rearranged and put into a more logical order. In addition, we 
propose several amendments to the regulations governing containers and 
marks.
    Industrial versus nonindustrial. The current regulations in subpart 
R list requirements that apply to spirits for ``industrial'' use and 
separate requirements that apply to spirits for ``nonindustrial'' use. 
However, the terms ``industrial'' use and ``nonindustrial'' use are not 
explained within subpart R. The proposed regulations in subpart S 
define those terms in a new section which appears at Sec.  19.472.
    Tanks, pipelines. In its comments on part 19, DISCUS proposes that 
the current regulations at Sec.  19.586, Tanks, and Sec.  19.587, 
Pipelines, be deleted because they are redundant with other sections of 
the regulations. We agree that they are redundant, and propose such 
deletion in the proposed regulations.
    Filling containers. In the current regulation at Sec.  19.582, 
there is a limitation on filling containers during processing 
operations. This regulation limits filling to containers of not more 
than 10 gallons. We deleted this limitation in the proposed regulation 
at Sec.  19.474 because we foresee instances where a processor may have 
a need to fill containers in excess of 10 gallons. In addition, the 
current regulation at Sec.  19.583, imposes a 10-gallon limitation for 
the filling of containers with Specially Denatured Alcohol (SDA). We 
are not aware of any reason for this limitation, and in the proposed 
regulation at Sec.  19.475 we propose deleting the size reference 
because SDA may be filled into containers with a larger capacity.
    Marks on packages of tax-paid industrial spirits. In Notice No. 
870, ATF proposed to amend the regulation in Sec.  19.605 by requiring 
that proof, tare, and proof gallons be marked on packages of spirits 
withdrawn on determination of tax. In its response to Notice No. 870, 
DISCUS opposes this proposal because it would be burdensome on 
proprietors that ship to manufacturers of nonbeverage products. DISCUS 
also states that the information required in ATF's proposed Sec.  
19.605 is already required under Sec.  19.749, Bottling and packaging 
record, and Sec.  19.769, Package gauge record. After consideration of 
the DISCUS comments, we did not include this proposal from Notice No. 
870 in this new proposed rule.
Subpart T--Liquor Bottle, Label, and Closure Requirements
    Under the current regulations in part 19, issues relating to liquor 
bottles and label requirements are found in subpart S and issues 
relating to closure requirements are found in subpart T. In the 
proposed regulations, these subjects will be covered in the new subpart 
T. Below is a summary of the changes that we propose to make in the new 
regulations.
    Scope. The current regulation at Sec.  19.631, Scope, states that 
the regulations in Sec. Sec.  19.632 through 19.639 only apply to 
bottles with a capacity of 200 ml or more unless it is specifically 
stated that the section applies to bottles of less than 200 ml. In our 
revision of the subpart, we deleted several sections of regulations, 
and the only sections that remain apply to all bottle sizes. Therefore, 
the ``scope'' section of the proposed regulations at Sec.  19.631 is no 
longer needed and has been deleted.
    Bottles authorized. The current regulation at Sec.  19.632 states 
that liquor bottles, including bottles of less than 200 ml, must 
conform to the standards of fill in 27 CFR part 5. This section was 
rewritten and deletes the reference to 200 ml because there are no 
special rules that apply to bottles of less than 200 ml. As proposed, 
the new regulation at Sec.  19.511 simply states that all liquor 
bottles for domestic purposes must conform to the standards of fill at 
27 CFR part 5.
    Distinctive liquor bottles. We have rewritten the current 
regulation at Sec.  19.633 to remove the reference to bottle sizes less 
than 200 ml. The requirements of this section apply to all bottle sizes 
and now appears in the proposed regulations at Sec.  19.513.
    Receipt and storage of liquor bottles. The current regulation at 
Sec.  19.634 provides rules for the receipt and storage of liquor 
bottles. We could find no consumer or revenue protection reason to 
retain this section, and we deleted it from the proposed regulations.
    Bottles to be used for display purposes. The current regulation at 
Sec.  19.635 provides recordkeeping rules for those instances in which 
liquor bottles are provided for display purposes. We could find no 
reason to treat these bottles differently than others so we are 
proposing to delete this provision from the proposed subpart. Records 
of receipt and use of all liquor bottles are covered in the proposed 
regulation at Sec.  19.603.
    Bottles for testing purposes. We propose to delete the current 
regulation at Sec.  19.636. As stated above, we could find no reason to 
retain this as a separate section of regulations. Records of receipt 
and use of liquor bottles are covered in the proposed regulation at 
Sec.  19.603.
    Bottles not constituting approved containers. We rewrote the 
current regulation at Sec.  19.637 to remove the reference to bottle 
sizes less than 200 ml because there are no special rules that apply to 
bottles of less than 200 ml. This section applies to all bottle sizes 
and now appears at proposed Sec.  19.512.
    Disposition of stocks of liquor bottles. We deleted the current 
regulation at Sec.  19.638 in the proposed regulations. We could find 
no consumer or revenue protection reason to retain this as a separate 
section. Records of receipt, use, and disposition of liquor bottles are 
covered in the proposed regulation Sec.  19.603.
    Use and resale of liquor bottles. We deleted the current regulation 
at Sec.  19.639 in the proposed regulations. We could find no consumer 
or revenue protection reason to retain this as a separate section. 
Records of receipt, use, and disposition of liquor bottles are covered 
in the proposed regulation Sec.  19.603.
    Statements required on labels under an exemption from label 
approval. The current regulation at Sec.  19.642 contains a general 
requirement whereby labels that are exempt from label approval must 
contain certain items of information. The regulations at Sec. Sec.  
19.643 through 19.650 discuss those specific items of information. 
Further, most of the text in

[[Page 26217]]

Sec. Sec.  19.643 through 19.650 mirrors text found in 27 CFR part 5.
    In our proposed regulation at Sec.  19.517, we have merged most of 
the information in the current regulations at Sec. Sec.  19.642 through 
19.650 and created a section which lists the specific information that 
must appear on a label exempt from label approval. Further, we propose 
to no longer publish in one part of the regulations identical 
provisions from other parts of the regulations. Thus, we propose 
stating that the mandatory information under Sec.  19.517 must conform 
to specific, cited sections of 27 CFR part 5 and Sec.  19.518 of part 
19 without duplicating the actual text of those regulations in Sec.  
19.517.
    Closures. The current regulations at Sec. Sec.  19.661 and 19.662 
contain the closure requirements that apply to each bottle or container 
of spirits having a capacity of one gallon or less. Under the current 
regulations, distilled spirits containers must have a closure that 
leaves a portion of the closure on the container when opened. In 
addition, the closure must be constructed in such a manner that it must 
be broken to gain access to the contents. These regulations implement 
the IRC at 26 U.S.C. 5301(d). DISCUS proposes that the closure 
requirement at Sec.  19.662 be amended to allow for closures that are 
removed completely if the closure shows when it has been subject to 
tampering.
    In our proposed regulation at Sec.  19.523, we require that the 
container have a closure that must be broken to gain access to the 
contents. However, we have deleted the requirement that a portion of 
the closure remain on the container when opened. This particular 
feature of the current regulation is not a requirement of the IRC at 26 
U.S.C. 5301(d). Further, we have received several requests for an 
alternate method or procedure from this particular requirement, and we 
see no continued need for this feature on the closure.
    Labels for export and Puerto Rico. In the current regulations at 
Sec. Sec.  19.395 and 19.396, we discuss the label requirements that 
apply to spirits for export and spirits for shipment to Puerto Rico. 
These requirements have been incorporated into our proposed regulations 
at Sec. Sec.  19.519 and 19.520.
Subpart U--Reserved
    We propose to reserve subpart U for possible future use.
Subpart V--Records and Reports
    The current regulations in part 19 require that the proprietor of a 
distilled spirits plant maintain a comprehensive system of records 
relating to operations at the plant. The primary aim of this records 
system is to account for all taxable spirits and products that are 
produced, received, stored, processed, and removed from the plant. 
Further, the regulations require that the proprietor account for 
taxable products by maintaining a system of records arranged into 
separate accounts within each plant. Depending on the scope of 
operations conducted at the plant, this records system may include a 
production account, a storage account, a processing account, and a 
denaturation account. In addition, there are a number of daily records 
and summary records prescribed for activities occurring within each 
account. These recordkeeping requirements are based on the IRC at 26 
U.S.C. 5146, 5201, 5207, 5211, 5291, 5555, 5603, 6001, 6011, and 6061.
    Under the current regulations, recordkeeping and report 
requirements are covered in subpart W. In the proposed regulations, 
these subjects will be covered in a new subpart V.
    We are proposing several amendments to the regulations covering 
recordkeeping and reporting requirements for distilled spirits plants. 
Some of the proposed amendments are based on recommendations made by 
DISCUS. Other proposed amendments are the result of TTB's internal 
review of the current recordkeeping and report requirements for 
distilled spirits plants.
    DISCUS Recommendations. The following is a summary of the 
recordkeeping changes proposed in the petition submitted by DISCUS.
    <bullet> Commercial records. DISCUS recommends an increased 
reliance on the commercial records that are maintained by distilled 
spirits plants as opposed to the detailed government records that are 
currently required in subpart W. In its petition for the revision of 
part 19, DISCUS asserts:

    The Bureau's responsibility to protect the revenue can be 
fulfilled by reliance on commercial records maintained by DSPs in 
the ordinary course of business or summaries of such records, 
typically computerized, which show ``what goes in'' and ``what goes 
out'' of the plant.

Further, in its markup of part 19, DISCUS proposes the deletion of a 
substantial number of the records currently required by subpart W.
    <bullet> Elimination of separate accounts. Closely related to its 
proposal to increase the use of commercial records, DISCUS also 
proposes the elimination of the three separate accounts currently 
required in subpart W. DISCUS asserts:

    Records of activities not impacting upon ``what goes in'' and 
``what goes out'' are unnecessary and thus would not be required. 
These include, inter alia, records of gauges, measurements of 
product, and movements at each interim step of the plant's 
operations.

In support of this proposal, DISCUS submitted numerous proposed 
amendments to the recordkeeping requirements in subpart W involving the 
elimination of many of the current recordkeeping requirements and 
replacing those requirements with a recordkeeping system based on a 
single DSP account for all spirits.
    <bullet> Daily versus monthly records. Under the current 
recordkeeping regulations, a distilled spirits plant proprietor is 
required to record each activity or transaction as it occurs, summarize 
those activities on a daily basis, and then report those activities in 
a monthly summary report. DISCUS proposes that DSPs no longer be 
required to record information on a daily basis. Instead, they propose 
that information be recorded on a monthly basis. In its petition, 
DISCUS states:

    Other unnecessary and burdensome recordkeeping regulations also 
would be modified. For example, ordinary business records and 
summaries used for Part 19 compliance would not be required to show 
information on a daily basis, but instead generally on a monthly 
basis.

DISCUS asserts that these changes would not have an adverse effect on 
TTB's ability to audit operations at DSPs.
    <bullet> Format, storage, and reproduction. In regard to the 
format, storage, and reproduction of records, DISCUS states:

    Under this modernized regulatory scheme, proprietors no longer 
would be required to maintain information in any prescribed format, 
would be able to store records at any of the proprietor's 
facilities, and would not need prior approval from the Bureau to 
reproduce records.

DISCUS recommends that the regulations governing format, storage, and 
reproduction of records at 27 CFR 19.721 and 19.723 be amended.
    TTB's Proposed Changes to the Regulations. In response to the 
recommendations made by DISCUS and based on TTB's analysis of the 
current recordkeeping requirements, we propose several amendments to 
the regulations in the new proposed subpart V.
    <bullet> Restructuring and plain language changes. One of the first 
changes that we propose is to restructure and reorder much of the 
information in subpart V. For example, recordkeeping information that 
was contained within some of the longer sections within the subpart has 
been divided-up into shorter, individual sections within the subpart. 
We believe this change will make for easier reader

[[Page 26218]]

access. We have also incorporated plain language principles into our 
rewriting of the subpart to make the revised regulations easier to read 
and understand.
    <bullet> Commercial records. As a general principle, TTB agrees 
with increased reliance on the commercial records maintained by a DSP, 
as opposed to records that are specifically created to satisfy 
government recordkeeping requirements. We also agree that the 
proprietor's commercial records should contain most of the information 
necessary to track the receipt and disposition of spirits as well as 
certain key transactions within the plant. With this principle in mind, 
we state in the proposed regulation at Sec.  19.572 that required 
records may consist of documents created in the ordinary course of 
business rather than records created to expressly to meet the 
requirements of this part, if those documents:
    (1) Contain all of the details that this part requires;
    (2) Are consistent with the general standards of clarity and 
accuracy; and
    (3) Can be readily understood by TTB personnel.
    Separate accounts. The current regulations require that a 
proprietor maintain a system of records arranged into separate 
accounts. This may include a production account, a storage account, a 
processing account, and a denaturation account, as applicable. DISCUS 
recommends that the recordkeeping regulations be substantially 
abbreviated and provide for a single account at the DSP.
    In our review of the IRC requirements regarding the ``records'' 
that must be maintained by a DSP under 26 U.S.C. 5207, we find that a 
DSP must keep records of ``production activities,'' ``storage 
activities,'' ``denaturation activities,'' and ``processing 
activities.'' Also, 26 U.S.C. 5207 provides a list of required records 
that must be maintained for each of these activities. Thus, we modeled 
the current DSP recordkeeping regulations after 26 U.S.C. 5207, and we 
propose to continue to require that records be maintained with a 
separate account for each activity.
    Further, the requirement to maintain separate accounts within a DSP 
is specifically addressed in the legislative history of the Trade 
Agreements Act of 1979 (Pub. L. 96-39), which implemented the current 
system for operating distilled spirits plants. The legislative history 
of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 states in part:

    The new all-in-bond system will substantially simplify the 
qualification and use of distilled spirits plant premises, by 
eliminating the requirement that separate facilities, for the 
various distilling operations be established and maintained within a 
plant. Since the tax under the all-in-bond system will be determined 
at the conclusion of the distilled spirits operations, there is no 
longer any need for these physical delineation and separation 
requirements. Under the all-in-bond system, these separate 
activities will be accounted for only by recordkeeping accounts such 
as for production, storage, processing and finished goods. Tanks, 
vats, rooms or buildings may be used for multiple purposes, with the 
type and identification of the spirits being maintained by the 
appropriate records.

    Thus, the legislative history of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 
clearly shows that while Congress established the all-in-bond system 
with its efficiencies, Congress intended to maintain a system of 
separate recordkeeping accounts for the different operations within a 
distilled spirits plants.
    Based on the language of the IRC and the legislative history of the 
Trade Agreements Act of 1979, we propose to continue the requirement to 
establish separate accounts within the DSP. However, we also propose to 
eliminate any current recordkeeping requirements and items of 
information that are not necessary for the protection of the revenue or 
that do not aid in the tracking of spirits for consumer protection 
purposes.
    <bullet> Daily versus monthly records. As discussed earlier, DISCUS 
recommends that proprietors no longer be required to show information 
in their records on a daily basis. Instead, DISCUS proposes that 
information be shown on a monthly basis. After careful consideration, 
we decided against making this proposal. TTB would be unable to audit 
activities at a plant if only monthly summaries of activities are 
available. To continue to audit activities at the plants, TTB needs 
access to the daily transaction records. Thus, daily records must 
continue to be maintained.
    <bullet> Format, storage, and reproduction. The proposed 
regulations do not require that records be maintained in any particular 
format or media. Required records may be kept on paper, on microfilm or 
microfiche, or on a computer or other electronic media. The only 
requirement is that records must be readily retrievable in hard-copy 
format for review by TTB officers as necessary. Further, we have 
eliminated the requirement at Sec.  19.725 to obtain TTB approval to 
reproduce required records.
    <bullet> Computer-generated reports and forms. Over the past 
several years, TTB has approved several alternate methods or procedures 
that allow companies to submit computer-generated paper reports and 
forms. DISCUS recommends that this option be extended to all DSPs. TTB 
has no objection to receiving computer-generated reports and 
transaction forms. Accordingly, the proposed regulation at Sec.  19.634 
states that TTB will accept both computer-generated reports of 
operations and transaction forms that are made using a computer printer 
on plain white paper and that match the TTB report or form. Further, 
use of these reports and forms will not have to be pre-approved by TTB 
if they conform to the following standards:
    (1) The computer-generated report or form must approximate the 
physical layout of the corresponding TTB report or form, although the 
typeface may vary;
    (2) The text on the computer-generated report or form and each line 
entry must exactly match the official TTB report or form; and
    (3) Each penalty of perjury statement specified for the TTB report 
or form must be produced in its entirety.
    <bullet> Electronic submission of forms. Closely related to the 
subject of computer-generated reports is the matter of electronic 
submission of forms and electronic signatures. We addressed this issue 
in a separate rulemaking action. On October 10, 2003, TTB issued 
Treasury decision T.D. TTB-5 (68 FR 58600, October 10, 2003) in which 
we allow for the submission of certain forms to TTB electronically 
through a TTB-approved electronic document receiving system. We believe 
that by providing this option to submit certain forms electronically, 
we can substantially reduce the costs associated with submitting and 
maintaining paper documents.
    <bullet> Location of records. Formerly, the IRC at 26 U.S.C. 5207 
required that records be kept on the premises of the distilled spirits 
plant where the operations covered by the records are conducted. This 
section of law was amended in 1997 by Public Law 105-34 and IRC section 
5207 no longer requires that records be maintained at the plant. 
Accordingly, the proposed regulation at Sec.  19.573 allows required 
records to be maintained at either the distilled spirits plant where 
operations or transactions occur or a central recordkeeping location. 
However, when records are to be kept at a central recordkeeping 
location, the proposed regulations at Sec.  19.574 will require that 
they be made available at the plant premises during inspections and 
audits.
    <bullet> Transfer record for shipments from customs custody. Notice 
No. 870 advised that the transfer record for spirits being received 
from customs

[[Page 26219]]

custody is mentioned in Sec.  19.770 in a way that implies that the 
transfer record would be prepared under Sec.  19.770. However, 27 CFR 
27.138 prescribes the information for the transfer record covering such 
transfers, and that information is different in several ways from the 
information required for domestic transfers by Sec.  19.770. Notice No. 
870 proposed to amend Sec.  19.770 to clarify that the record required 
for transfer of spirits from customs custody must be prepared in 
accordance with Sec.  27.138.
    DISCUS does not comment on this proposal, and we incorporated this 
proposed change into the new, proposed regulation at Sec.  19.621(c).
    <bullet> Miscellaneous changes. In its part 19 mark-up, DISCUS 
proposes the elimination of Sec.  19.775, Record of securing devices, 
and Sec.  19.776, Record of scale tests. We agree with this 
recommendation, and these sections have been deleted from the proposed 
regulations. In addition, we propose to eliminate Sec.  19.726, 
Authorized abbreviations to identify spirits. We see no need to 
prescribe the abbreviations used by proprietors on forms or records.
    <bullet> Reports. Currently, distilled spirits plant proprietors 
submit monthly reports of operations. These reports include: Monthly 
Report of Production Operations, TTB F 5110.40; Monthly Report of 
Storage Operations, TTB F 5110.11; Monthly Report of Processing 
Operation, TTB F 5110.28; and Monthly Report of Processing (Denaturing) 
Operations, TTB F 5110.43. DISCUS recommends that the monthly reports 
be changed to quarterly reports and also suggested that three of the 
reports be merged into a single report.
    We disagree with this recommendation. Our Office of Field 
Operations (FO) relies on monthly submission of detailed information 
for its pre-audit analysis and monitoring of plant operations. FO finds 
that having separate reports, rather than a merged report, is in the 
best interests of protecting the revenue because its staff is better 
able to assess specific operations within the distilled spirits plant 
and identify specific operations for particular attention during an 
audit. In addition, TTB recently simplified the submission of monthly 
report data with the implementation of TTB Pay.gov, and this 
simplification should address some of the concerns raised by DISCUS.
Subpart W--Production of Vinegar by the Vaporizing Process
    Under the current regulations, production of vinegar by the 
vaporizing process is covered at subpart X. In these proposed 
regulations, we cover the production of vinegar under proposed subpart 
W. DISCUS does not recommend any changes to the regulations in this 
subpart, and we did not make any substantive changes to these 
regulations.
Subpart X--Distilled Spirits for Fuel Use
    Under the current regulations, distilled spirits for fuel use is 
covered in subpart Y. In these proposed regulations, this subject will 
be covered under a new subpart X. Proposed subpart X will cover the 
requirements for establishing and operating a distilled spirits plant 
that will produce, process, store, use, or distribute distilled spirits 
exclusively for fuel use.
    DISCUS does not propose any changes to this subpart. However, TTB 
proposes to make several changes to the regulations in subpart X. 
Similar to the changes made in other subparts, we have rearranged the 
information in subpart X into a more logical order. Also, we combined 
some sections to provide more clarity, added new sections, and 
renumbered the regulations within this subpart.
    Definitions. We amended the definitions that appear in the current 
regulations at Sec.  19.911, Meaning of terms, by deleting or replacing 
terms that no longer apply. We also deleted several terms that are 
defined in the proposed regulations at Sec.  19.1, Definitions. The 
definitions for this subpart appear in the proposed regulations at 
Sec.  19.662.
    Letterhead applications. In the proposed regulations, we now 
include an allowance for letterhead applications and letterhead notices 
for changes affecting permits.
    Bonds. In the proposed regulations at Sec. Sec.  19.699 and 19.700, 
we provide information that explains bonds and sureties in more detail. 
We also provide an improved explanation of how the amount of the bond 
must be computed.
    Bonds for some small plants. The IRC, at 26 U.S.C. 5181(c)(3), 
provides that no bond is required for an ``eligible distilled spirits 
plant'' and that such plants may nonetheless receive shipments of 
spirits ``in bond'' under 26 U.S.C. 5212. An ``eligible distilled 
spirits plant'' is defined in 26 U.S.C. 5181(c)(4) as ``a plant which 
is used to produce distilled spirits exclusively for fuel use and the 
production from which does not exceed 10,000 proof gallons per year.'' 
This definition requires a plant to produce distilled spirits in order 
to be an ``eligible distilled spirits plant.''
    Although the Bureau formerly interpreted 26 U.S.C. 5181(a)(1) to 
require that all alcohol fuel plants must produce distilled spirits, 
this interpretation has been amended, and the Bureau now holds that a 
person may establish an alcohol fuel plant solely for the receipt and 
processing of distilled spirits for fuel use. Nevertheless, such a 
plant does not meet the definition of ``eligible distilled spirits 
plant'' quoted above. Therefore, a plant that would only receive and 
process distilled spirits and has no production capability must have a 
bond, regardless of size in order to be eligible to receive spirits 
``in bond'' under 26 U.S.C. 5212. The proposed regulations at 
Sec. Sec.  19.673, 19.699, and 19.700 will now provide for the bonding 
of small alcohol fuel plants that do not produce distilled spirits for 
fuel use.
    Importing spirits. TTB allows persons qualified as an alcohol fuel 
producer under the 26 U.S.C. 5181 to receive imported alcohol from 
customs custody. However, such importations are not covered in the 
current regulations in subpart Y. In the proposed regulations, we added 
a new section at Sec.  19.742 that covers the transfer of spirits from 
customs custody to an alcohol fuel plant. This new section incorporates 
the procedures for importation of spirits that were discussed in Notice 
No. 870 and Industry Circular 80-6, ``Distilled Spirits for Fuel Use''.
    Application for transfer of spirits in bond. 26 U.S.C. 5212 
provides for the transfer in bond of bulk distilled spirits between 
bonded premises without payment of tax. In addition, 26 U.S.C. 
5005(c)(1) provides that the consignee proprietor of a distilled 
spirits plant is liable for the tax on all distilled spirits that are 
in transit to the consignee's premises from the time of removal from 
the consignor's premises pursuant to an application made by the 
consignee of the shipment.
    Based upon the provision within IRC section 5005(c)(1), which 
assigns liability for the shipment to the consignee based upon an 
application made by the consignee, distilled spirits plant proprietors 
qualified under 26 U.S.C 5171 are required to file an Application for 
Transfer of Spirits and/or Denatured Spirits in Bond on TTB F 5110.16 
and receive authorization from TTB prior to the transfer of spirits in 
bond. This requirement appears in the current regulations at Sec.  
19.506.
    The application by the consignee proprietor on TTB F 5100.16 is 
filed in triplicate with TTB's Director, National Revenue Center. If 
the application is approved, the Director of our National Revenue 
Center will complete Part II on all copies of the form, retain one copy 
of the form, and return the remaining

[[Page 26220]]

copies to the applicant. The applicant will deliver one of the approved 
copies to the consignor and retain one copy for his files. The approved 
application remains in effect until the bond terminates or where there 
is less than a maximum bond, the approved application will terminate 
when the penal sum of the bond is changed.
    TTB's current regulations governing alcohol fuel plants do not 
require that the consignee proprietor submit an application to receive 
spirits in bond on form TTB F 5100.16, Application for Transfer of 
Spirits and/or Denatured Spirits in Bond. This appears to be an 
oversight in the current regulations and represents a jeopardy to the 
revenue because the law at 26 U.S.C. 5005(c)(1) assigns tax liability 
for the shipment to the consignee only when the spirits are shipped 
``pursuant to an application made by him.''
    Therefore, we propose to amend the regulations governing transfers 
in bond involving alcohol fuel plants and require that the proprietor 
of an alcohol fuel plant who wishes to receive spirits by transfer in 
bond must file an application with TTB on form TTB F 5100.16 and 
receive approval from TTB prior to the transfer. This requirement 
appears in the proposed regulations at Sec. Sec.  19.403, 19.405,

IV. Regulatory Analyses and Notices

Paperwork Reduction Act

    The collections of information contained in the regulations 
proposed by this notice have been previously reviewed and approved by 
the Office of Management and Budget in accordance with the Paperwork 
Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3507) under control numbers: 1513-
0013, 1513-0014, 1513-0020, 1513-0030, 1513-0038, 1513-0039, 1513-0040, 
1513-0041, 1513-0044, 1513-0045, 1513-0046, 1513-0047, 1513-0048, 1513-
0049, 1513-0051, 1513-0052, 1513-0056, 1513-0080, 1513-0081, 1513-0083, 
1513-0088, and 1513-0113. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a 
person is not required to respond to, a collection of information 
unless it displays a valid control number assigned by OMB.

Regulatory Flexibility Act

    The Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., provides that 
whenever a Federal agency proposes regulations that may have a 
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, 
the agency must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis.
    The provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act relating to an 
initial and final regulatory flexibility analysis (5 U.S.C. 603 and 
604) are not applicable to notices of proposed rulemaking when a final 
rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial 
number of small entities. This proposed rulemaking proposes to restate 
existing regulations in plain language, to make certain variations 
currently granted to individual plants available to all plants, and to 
adopt certain suggestions made by industry associations to reduce the 
burdens of regulatory compliance. This proposed rulemaking proposes to 
reduce the burden on members of the distilled spirits industry, 
including small businesses. Accordingly, it is hereby certified that a 
final rule, if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact 
on a substantial number of small entities and a regulatory flexibility 
analysis is not required.
    We have submitted a copy of this proposed rule to the Chief Counsel 
for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration in accordance with 26 
U.S.C. 7805(f).

Executive Order 12866

    We have determined that this notice of proposed rulemaking is not a 
significant regulatory action as defined in Executive Order 12866. 
Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required.

Executive Order 13132

    Executive Order 13132, entitled ``Federalism'' (64 FR 43255, August 
10, 1999), requires Federal agencies to ensure ``meaningful and timely 
input by State and local officials in the development of regulatory 
policies that have federalism implications.'' We certify that this 
proposed rule does not have federalism implications. This proposed rule 
will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the 
relationship between the National Government and the States, or on the 
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of 
Government.

processor, TTB will notify the manufacturer to stop manufacturing the 
product until the formula is changed to make the product unfit for 
beverage use and the change is approved by the appropriate TTB officer. 
However, the provisions of this paragraph will not prohibit products 
which are unfit for beverage use from use in small quantities for 
flavoring drinks at the time of serving for immediate consumption.

Sec.  19.19  Discontinuance of storage facilities.

    If TTB determines that a proprietor's bonded storage facility for 
spirits is unsafe or unfit for use, or causes excessive waste or loss 
of spirits, TTB can require that the proprietor discontinue using the 
facility. Further, TTB can require the transfer of the spirits stored 
in the facility to another storage facility. The transfer will take 
place at such time and under such supervision as TTB may require, and 
will be at the expense of the owner or warehouseman of the spirits. If 
the owner or warehouseman fails to transfer the spirits within the 
prescribed time or to pay the expense of the transfer, as ascertained 
and determined by the appropriate TTB officer, the spirits may be 
seized and sold. TTB will first apply the proceeds of such sale to the 
payment of the taxes due on the spirits and then to the cost and 
expense of the sale and removal, and the remaining balance, if any, 
will be paid over to the owner or warehouseman.

(26 U.S.C. 5236)

TTB may withdraw the approval to use the alternate method or procedure 
if TTB finds that the revenue is jeopardized, that the alternate method 
or procedure hinders effective administration of the laws or 
regulations, that the proprietor has violated any of the conditions 
imposed by TTB, or that the circumstances that gave rise to the need 
for the alternate method or procedure no longer exist.
    (c) Retention. The proprietor must retain each alternate method or 
procedure approval as part of the proprietor's records and must make 
the approval available for examination by TTB officers upon request.

from a weather or other natural event or from an accident or other 
event not involving an intentional act on the part of the proprietor.
    (b) Approval. The appropriate TTB officer may approve in writing 
the use of an emergency method or procedure if the proprietor

    (3) Will afford the same security and protection to the revenue as 
intended by the regulations; and
    (4) Will not hinder the effective administration of this subpart.
    (c) Terms of emergency method or procedure approval and use.
    (1) The proprietor may not use an emergency method or procedure 
until the application has been approved by TTB except when the 
emergency method or procedure requires immediate implementation to 
correct a situation that threatens life or property. In a situation 
involving a threat to life or property, the proprietor may implement 
the corrective action while concurrently notifying the appropriate TTB 
officer by telephone of the action and filing the required written 
application. Use of the emergency method or procedure must conform to 
any conditions specified in the approval.
    (2) The proprietor must retain the emergency method or procedure 
approval as part of the proprietor's records and must make the approval 
available for examination by TTB officers upon request.
    (3) The emergency method or procedure will automatically terminate 
when the situation that created the emergency no longer exists. TTB may 
withdraw the approval to use the emergency method or procedure if TTB 
finds that the revenue is jeopardized, that the emergency method or 
procedure hinders effective administration of the laws or regulations, 
or that the proprietor has failed to follow any of the conditions 
specified in the approval. When use of the emergency method or 
procedure terminates, the proprietor must revert to full compliance 
with all applicable regulations.

methods of governmental supervision (necessary for the protection of 
the revenue) over plants. For this purpose, the appropriate TTB officer 
may, with the approval of the proprietor thereof, designate any plant 
for such operations. Any waiver granted under this section must be in 
writing and signed by the appropriate TTB officer. The waiver will 
identify the provisions of law and/or regulations waived and the period 
of time during which the waiver will be effective. The appropriate TTB 
officer may terminate the waiver if he or she determines that the 
waiver jeopardizes the revenue.

(26 U.S.C. 5554)


Sec.  19.32  Experimental distilled spirits plants.

    (a) General. The appropriate TTB officer may authorize the

    (a) Bond required. Any person who plans to establish and operate a 
distilled spirits plant must provide TTB with one or more bonds on form 
TTB F 5110.56, Distilled Spirits Bond. TTB will not approve a 
registration or allow a person to operate a distilled spirits plant 
until the applicant has provided the necessary bonds. If a proprietor 
fails to pay any liability covered by the bond, TTB may seek payment 
from the proprietor, from the surety (see Sec.  19.153) or from both 
the proprietor and the surety. The types and penal sums of bonds 
required will depend upon the type and size of the operations that the 
proprietor will conduct.
    (b) Bond terms and conditions. The terms and conditions of a 
distilled spirits bond require that the proprietor comply with all 
provisions of law and regulations relating to activities covered by the 
bond, and to pay all taxes imposed by 26 U.S.C. Chapter 51, including 
taxes on unexplained shortages of bottled distilled spirits. The bond 
will further specify that the proprietor will pay all penalties 
incurred, or fines imposed, for violations of law and regulations 
relating to activities covered by the bond. The specific terms of the 
required bond(s) are stated on form TTB F 5110.56.
    (c) Corporations and controlled subsidiaries. For purposes of this 
subpart, the term ``corporation'' includes a Limited Liability Company 
(LLC) in any jurisdiction where the law authorizes such a business 
organization to operate. Whenever used in this subpart, the term 
``controlled subsidiary'' means a corporation (or LLC) in which more 
than 50 percent of the voting power is controlled by a parent 
corporation.

(26 U.S.C. 5173, 5551)


Sec.  19.152  Types of bonds.

    (a) Basic Bonds. There are two basic types of bonds: the operations 
bond, and the withdrawal bond.
    (1) Operations bond. An operations bond covers the tax liability 
for a variety of operations at a distilled spirits plant, along with 
any penalties incurred and fines imposed for violation of the law and 
regulations relating to activities covered by the bond.
    (2) Withdrawal bond. A withdrawal bond covers the tax liability for 
tax determined distilled spirits withdrawn from the bonded premises on 
a tax deferred basis.
    (b) Other bonds. In addition to the basic operations and withdrawal 
bonds, several variations of these bonds are available:
    (1) An adjacent wine cellar bond covers operations at a distilled 
spirits plant and an adjacent bonded wine cellar;
    (2) An area bond covers operations at two or more distilled spirits 
plant and any adjacent bonded wine cellars; and
    (3) A unit bond covers both operations and withdrawals at one or 
more distilled spirits plants and operations at any adjacent bonded 
wine cellars.

Sec.  19.153  Bond guaranteed by a corporate surety.

    (a) Corporate surety. A company that issues bonds is called a 
``corporate surety.'' Proprietors must obtain the surety bonds required 
by this subpart from a corporate surety approved by the Secretary of 
the Treasury.
    (b) How to find an approved surety. The Department of the Treasury 
publishes a list of approved corporate surety companies in Treasury 
Department Circular No. 570, ``Companies Holding Certificates of 
Authority as Acceptable Sureties on Federal Bonds and as Acceptable 
Reinsuring Companies''. Circular 570 is published annually in the 
Federal Register. The most current edition of the circular is posted at 
the website of the Financial Management Service, Department of the 
Treasury at <A HREF="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/leaving.cgi?from=leavingFR.html&log=linklog&to=http://www.fms.treas.gov/c570">http://www.fms.treas.gov/c570</A>. Printed copies of Circular

[[Page 26244]]

Sec.  19.154  Bond guaranteed by deposit of securities.

    (a) General. As an alternative to the corporate surety bond under 
Sec.  19.153, a person can file a bond that guarantees payment of the 
liability by pledging one or more acceptable negotiable securities. 
These securities must have a par value (face amount) equal to or 
greater than the penal sums of the required bonds. The pledged 
securities are held in the Federal Reserve Bank in a safekeeping 
account with TTB as the pledgee. Should the proprietor fail to pay one 
or more of the guaranteed liabilities, TTB can take action to sell the 
deposited securities to satisfy the debt. Pledged securities will be 
released if there are no outstanding liabilities when the bond is 
terminated. (See Sec.  19.170.)
    (b) Acceptable securities. Only public debt obligations of the 
United States, the principal and interest of which are unconditionally 
guaranteed by the United States Government, are acceptable for the 
purpose described in paragraph (a) of this section. The Department of 
the Treasury and certain other United States Government agencies issue 
debt instruments that are acceptable as collateral, such as Treasury 
notes and Treasury bills. Savings bonds, certificates of deposit and 
letters of credit are not acceptable. A list of securities acceptable 
as collateral in lieu of surety bonds is available from the Bureau of 
the Public Debt, Office of the Commissioner, Government Securities 
Regulations Staff. Current information and guidance from the Bureau of 
the Public Debt may be found at <A HREF="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/leaving.cgi?from=leavingFR.html&log=linklog&to=http://www.publicdebt.treas.gov">http://www.publicdebt.treas.gov</A>.

of surety filed with TTB in which an agent or officer executed the bond 
or consent on behalf of the surety must be supported by a power of 
attorney authorizing the agent or officer to execute the bond or 
consent of surety. The power of attorney assures TTB that the person 
who signed the bond on behalf of the surety has the legal authority to 
obligate the surety.
    (b) Form of power of attorney and endorsement. A power of attorney 
will be prepared on the surety's own form, and must be executed under 
the surety's corporate seal. If the power of attorney submitted is 
other than a manually signed original, it must be accompanied by a 
certification from the surety that the power of attorney is valid.
    (c) Additional documentation. The appropriate TTB officer 
authorized to approve and accept the bond may require additional 
evidence of the authenticity of signatures and the authority of persons 
signing on behalf of the surety to execute the bond or consent.

(31 U.S.C. 9304, 9306)


Sec.  19.157  Disapproval of bonds and consents of surety.

    (a) Grounds for disapproval. The appropriate TTB officer may 
disapprove any bond or consent of surety required by this part if the 
principal or any person having ownership, control or responsibility for 
actively managing the business has been previously convicted, in a 
court of competent jurisdiction of:
    (1) Any fraudulent noncompliance with any provision of any law of 
the United States relating to internal revenue or customs taxation of 
spirits, wines, or beer, or if the offense was compromised by payment 
of penalties or otherwise, or
    (2) Any felony under a law of any State or the District of 
Columbia, or the United States, prohibiting the manufacture, sale, 
importation, or transportation of spirits, wine, beer, or other 
intoxicating liquor.
    (b) Appeal. If the appropriate TTB officer disapproves a bond or 
consent of surety, the person giving the bond may appeal the 
disapproval to the Administrator, who will hear the appeal. The 
decision of the Administrator will be final.

Sec.  19.162  Operations bond for distilled spirits plant and adjacent 
bonded wine cellar.

    (a) One bond satisfying two requirements. A proprietor who operates 
a bonded wine cellar that is adjacent to the proprietor's distilled 
spirits plant, may file a single operations bond to cover the 
operations of the distilled spirits plant and the bonded wine cellar. A 
proprietor who files this type of bond satisfies the requirement in 26 
U.S.C. 5173 for an operations bond covering the distilled spirits plant 
and the requirement in 26 U.S.C. 5354 for a bond covering wine and 
spirits possessed at, and in transit to, the bonded wine cellar. (The 
proprietor may still have to obtain a supplemental bond for the wine 
cellar to cover liabilities resulting from deferred payment of tax. See 
the second sentence of 26 U.S.C. 5354.)
    (b) One bond combining terms and coverage of separate bonds. An 
operations bond filed under paragraph (a) of this section must contain 
the same terms and conditions that would be in separate bonds for the 
distilled spirits plant and for the bonded wine cellar. The proprietor 
may not allocate or divide the penal sum between the distilled spirits 
plant and the bonded wine cellar. The total amount of the bond must be 
available to satisfy any liability incurred under the terms of the bond 
at either facility.
    (c) Persons qualified for a single bond. A proprietor may choose to 
file a single operations bond for a distilled spirits plant and 
adjacent bonded wine cellar only if:
    (1) Such distilled spirits plant is qualified under subpart D of 
this part for the production of distilled spirits; and
    (2) Such wine cellar and distilled spirits plant are operated by 
the same person (or in the case of a corporation,

[[Page 26245]]

by such corporation and its controlled subsidiaries).

(26 U.S.C. 5173, 5351, 5354)


Sec.  19.163  Area operations bond.

    (a) Area operations bond covering multiple locations. A person who 
operates more than one distilled spirits plant within the geographical 
area serviced by the National Revenue Center, may submit to TTB an area 
operations bond covering the operations of any two or more such plants 
and any bonded wine cellars that are adjacent to such plants and which 
otherwise could be covered by an operations bond. Area operations bonds 
filed under this section will be in lieu of the operations bond 
requirements for single distilled spirits plants under Sec. Sec.  
19.161 and 19.166 and must contain the same terms and conditions as 
those contained in separate bonds filed for single distilled spirits 
plants. Any person who files an area operations bond may not allocate 
or divide the penal sum of the area operations bond between the 
separate locations and the total penal sum of the bond must be 
available to satisfy liability incurred at any of the covered 
locations.
    (b) Area operations bonds filed by corporations. An area operations 
bond may only cover distilled spirits plants and adjacent bonded wine 
cellars that are operated by the same person. For purposes of this 
section, a corporation and its controlled subsidiaries are considered 
to be one person. Further, a controlled subsidiary is a corporation in 
which more than 50 percent of the voting power is controlled by the 
parent corporation. Consequently, an area operations bond may cover 
distilled spirits plants and adjacent bonded wine cellars operated by a 
parent corporation and one or more of its controlled subsidiaries. The 
name of each corporation that operates a covered facility must appear 
on the bond as a principal, whether the operating corporation is the 
parent or a subsidiary. The bond must bear an authorized signature for 
each operating corporation appearing on the bond.

(26 U.S.C. 5173)


Sec.  19.164  Withdrawal bond.

    (a) Requirement for a withdrawal bond. If a person intends to 
withdraw spirits from a distilled spirits plant upon determination of 
the taxes due on the spirits but before payment of the tax, the person 
must provide TTB with a withdrawal bond for the distilled spirits 
plant. The withdrawal bond must guarantee payment of any taxes due on 
distilled spirits withdrawn from bonded premises up to the amount of 
the bond. Such bond will be in addition to the operations bond, and if 
the distilled spirits are withdrawn under the withdrawal bond, the 
operations bond will no longer cover liability for payment of the tax 
on the spirits withdrawn. For purposes of this section, a person 
includes a corporation, together with all of its controlled 
subsidiaries, and a controlled subsidiary has the same meaning as in 
Sec.  19.163(b).
    (b) One bond covering multiple plants. A person who operates more 
than one distilled spirits plant within the geographical area serviced 
by the National Revenue Center, may submit to TTB a single withdrawal 
bond that covers withdrawals from all such distilled spirits plants 
within that geographic area.
    (c) Penal sum of bonds--(1) Penal sum of a bond covering a single 
plant. A person who files a withdrawal bond for a single plant must 
compute the penal sum of such bond in accordance with Sec.  19.166. If 
the penal sum of such bond is less than the maximum amount, withdrawals 
from the plant may not exceed the penal sum.
    (2) Penal sum of bond covering multiple plants. A person who files 
one withdrawal bond to cover two or more distilled spirits plants must 
compute the required penal sum for each plant individually in 
accordance with Sec.  19.166. The penal sum of the withdrawal bond must 
be equal to, or greater than, the total of the minimum amounts required 
for the individual plants. The bond must show the amount of coverage 
allocated to each individual plant as well as the total penal sum for 
all plants. If the portion of the penal sum allocated to a particular 
plant is less than the maximum amount prescribed in Sec.  19.166 for a 
single plant, withdrawals from that plant must not exceed the amount of 
the penal sum allocated to that plant. The allocation of the penal sum 
notwithstanding, the entire penal sum of the bond must be available to 
satisfy all liability for tax on withdrawals from any and all of the 
covered plants.

(26 U.S.C. 5173)


Sec.  19.165  Unit bonds.

    (a) Unit bond covering operations and withdrawals. If a person is 
otherwise required to file bonds for both operations at one or more 
distilled spirits plants and withdrawals from one or more distilled 
spirits plants, the person may instead submit a single unit bond that 
provides all of the guarantees that would otherwise be provided by 
separate operations and withdrawal bonds. The unit bond may also 
provide coverage for operations at adjacent bonded wine cellars.
    For purposes of this section, a person includes a corporation, 
together with all of its controlled subsidiaries, and a controlled 
subsidiary has the same meaning as in Sec.  19.163(b).
    (b) Required penal sum--(1) General. A person must determine the 
penal sum for the unit bond by separately calculating in accordance 
with Sec.  19.166, and then totaling, the amounts needed to cover 
operations and withdrawals at each individual plant covered by the 
bond. The penal sum for the unit bond must not be less than the sum of 
the minimum penal sums that would be required if each of the plants had 
its own bond.
    (2) Allocation between operations and withdrawals. A unit bond must 
show separately the amount of coverage provided for operations 
(including operations at each adjacent bonded wine cellar if 
applicable) and for withdrawals at each distilled spirits plant covered 
by the bond.
    (3) Tax liability must not exceed allocated penal sum. If the 
amount of the penal sum allocated to operations at, or withdrawals 
from, a particular plant is less than the maximum amount prescribed in 
Sec.  19.166 for a single plant, the tax liability for operations at, 
or withdrawals from, that plant must not exceed that allocated amount.
    (4) Total penal sum available for each plant. Even when the penal 
sum of a unit bond is allocated among multiple plants, the bond must 
provide that the total penal amount of the bond will be available to 
satisfy any liability incurred under the terms and conditions of the 
bond at any plant covered by the bond.

(26 U.S.C. 5173)


Sec.  19.166  Required penal sums.

    A person must determine the penal sums for the various bonds 
required by this subpart according to the following table:

(26 U.S.C. 5173)


Sec.  19.167  Increase of bond coverage.

    (a) When required. If the penal sum of a bond is less than the 
maximum amount specified by Sec.  19.166, and liabilities increase to 
the point where they exceed the bond coverage, the proprietor must 
increase the amount of the bond to cover the increased liability. The 
proprietor must increase the bond coverage either by replacing the 
existing bond with a new, larger bond that covers the entire liability, 
or by supplementing the existing bond with a separate strengthening 
bond in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) Strengthening bonds. A strengthening bond is a second bond with 
the same surety as on the original bond which covers the increased 
liability. A strengthening bond must show both its execution date and 
its effective date. TTB will not accept a strengthening bond if it 
contains any term or condition that is a release, or could be 
interpreted as a release, from liability under any former bond, or that 
limits the liability of any bond to less than its full penal sum.

(26 U.S.C. 5173)


Sec.  19.168  Superseding bonds.

    (a) General. In any of the circumstances outlined in paragraphs (b) 
through (d) of this section, the proprietor must replace an existing 
bond with a new bond. A new bond that replaces another bond is called a 
superseding bond.
    (b) Surety company no longer acceptable. The proprietor must file a 
superseding bond if the surety on the proprietor's current bond becomes 
insolvent or if the surety is removed from the list of approved 
sureties in Treasury Circular 570. TTB may also require the filing of a 
superseding bond if any other contingency affecting the validity or 
efficiency of the bond arises.
    (c) Change of control. An executor, administrator, assignee, 
receiver, trustee, or other person acting in a fiduciary capacity, 
continuing or liquidating the business of the principal on a bond, must 
either provide TTB with a superseding bond, or obtain consent from the 
surety on each existing bond when assuming control of the business.
    (d) Termination of bond by surety. If the surety applies to 
terminate a bond under Sec.  19.171, and the proprietor wishes to 
continue the activity covered by the bond, the proprietor must file a 
superseding bond that becomes effective on or before the termination 
date of the existing bond. The superseding bond must show both its 
execution date and its effective date.

(26 U.S.C. 5173, 5175, 5176, 5551)


Sec.  19.169  Effect of failure to furnish a superseding bond.

    (a) Operations bond. A person may not operate a distilled spirits 
plant without an operations bond. If a person does not submit an 
acceptable superseding operations bond when required to do so under 
Sec.  19.168, the person must immediately discontinue the activities to 
which the lapsed bond coverage relates upon lapse of the existing bond 
coverage.
    (b) Withdrawal bond. A person who does not submit an acceptable 
superseding withdrawal bond when required to do so under Sec.  19.168 
may not withdraw distilled spirits from the bonded premises on a 
deferred basis. Upon lapse of the existing bond coverage the person 
must pay the tax at the time of withdrawal, except in the case of 
distilled spirits withdrawn free of tax or withdrawn without payment of 
tax under 26 U.S.C. 5214 or withdrawn exempt from tax under 26 U.S.C. 
7510.
    (c) Unit bond. A person who does not provide an acceptable 
superseding unit bond when required to do so under Sec.  19.168 must 
immediately discontinue the business or distilled spirits operations to 
which the lapsed bond coverage relates. Upon lapse of the existing bond 
coverage the person must also pay the tax at the time of withdrawal, 
except in the case of distilled spirits withdrawn free of tax or 
withdrawn without payment of tax under 26 U.S.C. 5214 or withdrawn 
exempt from tax under 26 U.S.C. 7510.

(26 U.S.C. 5173, 5175, 5176)


Sec.  19.170  Termination of bonds.

    Liability under operations bonds, withdrawal bonds, and unit bonds 
may be terminated for future withdrawals, future production, or future 
deposits as set forth below:
    (a) On application by the surety. A surety may terminate a bond by 
filing a notice as provided in Sec.  19.171;

[[Page 26248]]

    (b) By replacement of the bond. A principal may terminate an 
existing bond by replacing it with a superseding bond approved by TTB;
    (c) By discontinuing withdrawals. A principal may terminate a 
withdrawal bond by notifying TTB that the principal has stopped making 
withdrawals covered by the bond, if the bond was filed solely as a 
withdrawal bond; or
    (d) By discontinuing the business. A principal may terminate a bond 
by notifying TTB that the principal has discontinued business.

(26 U.S.C. 5173)


Sec.  19.171  Surety notice of relief from bond liability.

    (a) Notice to principal. A surety on a bond may, at any time, 
notify the principal in writing that the surety desires to be relieved 
of liability under the bond.
    (b) Notice to TTB. A surety on a bond may, at any time, notify the 
appropriate TTB officer in writing that the surety desires to be 
relieved of liability under the bond. The notice must specify the date 
after which the surety desires to be relieved of liability. In the case 
of a withdrawal bond, the date specified in the notice must be at least 
ten days after the notice is received by the appropriate TTB officer. 
In the case of an operations bond or unit bond, the date specified in 
the notice must be at least 90 days after the notice is received by the 
appropriate TTB officer. When a surety files a termination notice with 
TTB, the surety must include either an acknowledgement from the 
principal that the principal is aware that the surety is terminating 
the bond or proof that the surety has served the principal with notice 
of its intent to terminate the bond.
    (c) Effect of notice. The bond coverage will end as of close of 
business on the date specified in the notice, provided the surety 
timely filed a proper and complete termination notice, and the surety 
does not withdraw its termination notice in writing prior to the 
termination date. The surety will be released from future liability 
under the bond to the extent set forth in Sec.  19.172.

(26 U.S.C. 5173, 5175, 5176)


Sec.  19.172  Relief of surety from bond liability.

    A surety who has provided proper notice under Sec.  19.171 will be 
relieved from liability under the bond in question as set forth below:
    (a) Operations or unit bond. When a superseding bond is submitted, 
the surety will be relieved of future liability related to production 
and deposits that take place after the effective date of the 
superseding bond. However, the surety remains liable for the tax on all 
distilled spirits or wines produced, or for other liabilities incurred, 
during the term of the bond. Further, if a superseding bond is not 
submitted, the surety will remain liable under the bond for all spirits 
or wines that are on hand or in transit to the bonded premises or 
bonded wine cellar on the date specified in the notice. The liability 
of the surety will continue until all such spirits or wines have been 
lawfully disposed of, or until a new bond has been submitted by the 
principal covering the spirits or wine.
    (b) Withdrawal or unit bonds. The surety will be relieved from 
liability for withdrawals made after the date specified in the notice, 
or upon the effective date of a new bond if one is given.

(26 U.S.C. 5173, 5176)


Sec.  19.173  Release of pledged securities.

    Securities that are pledged and deposited with TTB under Sec.  
19.154 will only be released by TTB in accordance with the provisions 
of 31 CFR Part 225. The appropriate TTB officer will not release 
pledged securities prior to termination of the liability under the bond 
for which they were pledged. When the appropriate TTB officer is 
satisfied that the pledged securities may be released, the official 
will set a date or dates on which a part or all of the securities may 
be released. At any time prior to the release of the securities, the 
appropriate TTB officer may extend the date of release for any 
additional length of time deemed necessary.

(26 U.S.C. 5006, 5204, 5505)


Sec.  19.183  Scale tanks.

    (a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section, 
if the proprietor uses a tank to determine the distilled spirits tax 
imposed by 26 U.S.C. 5001, the tank must be mounted on scales and the 
contents of the tank must be determined by weight. The scale tank also 
must be equipped with a suitable device so that the volume of the 
contents can be quickly and accurately determined.
    (b) The requirement to mount tanks on scales does not apply to 
tanks having a capacity of 55 gallons or less. Such tanks may be moved 
onto an accurately calibrated scale when a tax determination gauge 
needs to be made.

(26 U.S.C. 5006, 5204, 5505)


Sec.  19.184  Scale tank minimum graduations.

    (a) The beams or dials on scale tanks used for tax determination 
must have minimum graduations not greater than the following:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                               Minimum
              Quantity to be weighed (pounds)                 graduation
                                                               (pounds)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[Page 26249]]

    (2) 5 percent of the total capacity of the weighing tank scale.
    (c) The weighing of lesser quantities for determination of tax may 
be authorized by the appropriate TTB officer where the beam of the 
scale is calibrated in \1/2\ pound or 1 pound graduations and it is 
found by actual test that the scales are accurate at each graduation.
    (d) Lots of spirits weighing 1,000 pounds or less shall be weighed 
on scales having \1/2\ pound graduations.

(26 U.S.C. 5006, 5204, 5505)


Sec.  19.185  Testing scale tanks for accuracy.

    (a) A proprietor who uses a scale tank for tax determination must 
ensure the accuracy of the scale through periodic testing. Testing of 
the scale must be conducted at least every 6 months and whenever the 
scale is adjusted or repaired.
    (b) A proprietor also must test, at least once a month, the 
gallonage represented to be in a scale tank against the gallonage 
indicated by volumetric determination of the contents of the tank. 
However, if the scale is not used during a month, it is only necessary 
to verify against the volumetric determination when the scale is next 
used. The proprietor must make the volumetric determination in 
accordance part 30 of this chapter. If the variation exceeds .5 percent 
of the quantity shown in the tank, the proprietor must take appropriate 
action to verify the accuracy of the scale.
    (c) If the appropriate TTB officer determines that a scale may be 
inaccurate, the proprietor must test the accuracy of the scale.

(26 U.S.C. 5006, 5204, 5505)

Package Scale and Pipeline Requirements


Sec.  19.186  Package scales.

    Proprietors must ensure that scales used to weigh packages are 
tested at least every 6 months and whenever they are adjusted or 
repaired. However, if a scale is not used during a 6-month period, it 
is only necessary to test the scale prior to its next use. Scales used 
to weigh packages that hold 10 wine gallons or less must indicate 
weight in ounces or hundredths of a pound.

(26 U.S.C. 5204)


Sec.  19.187  Pipelines.

    All pipelines, including flexible hoses, that are used to transfer 
spirits, denatured spirits, articles, and wines must be constructed, 
arranged, and secured so as to ensure protection of the revenue and 
permit ready examination. The appropriate TTB officer may approve 
pipelines that cannot be readily examined if they pose no jeopardy to 
the revenue.

(26 U.S.C. 5178)

Measuring and Proofing Equipment Requirements


Sec.  19.188  Measuring devices and proofing instruments.

    (a) General. A proprietor of a distilled spirits plant must have 
accurate instruments and equipment at the plant for determining the 
proof and volume of spirits.
    (b) Instruments. The hydrometers and thermometers that a proprietor 
uses to gauge spirits must show subdivisions or graduations of proof 
and temperature as specified in part 30 of this chapter. Proprietors 
must frequently test their hydrometers and thermometers to ensure their 
accuracy. If an instrument appears to be in error, the proprietor may 
not use the instrument until it is tested and certified as accurate by 
the manufacturer or another qualified person.
    (c) Meters. A proprietor may use an accurate mass flow meter to 
measure the volume of bulk spirits. A mass flow meter used for tax 
determination of bulk spirits must be certified by the manufacturer or 
other qualified person as accurate within a tolerance of +-0.1%. A mass 
flow meter used for all other required gauges of bulk spirits must be 
certified by the manufacturer or other qualified person as accurate 
within a tolerance of +-0.5%. The proprietor must make corrections for 
the temperature of the spirits being measured in conjunction with the 
volumetric measurement of spirits by mass flow meter. The proprietor 
must also test mass flow meters at least every 6 months to ensure that 
they are accurate within the required tolerances.

(26 U.S.C. 5204)

Other Plant Requirements


Sec.  19.189  Identification of structures, areas, apparatus, and 
equipment.

(26 U.S.C. 5178)


Sec.  19.190  Office facilities for TTB use.

    (a) When required by the appropriate TTB officer, the proprietor 
must provide a secure cabinet equipped for locking for use by TTB.
    (b) If one or more TTB officers are assigned to a distilled spirits 
plant to supervise operations on a continuing basis, the proprietor 
must provide a suitable office at the plant for the exclusive use of 
the TTB officers in performing their duties. The appropriate TTB 
officer will determine if the office facilities are suitable.

(26 U.S.C. 5178)


Sec.  19.191  Signs.

    The proprietor must place and keep a conspicuous sign on the 
outside of the place of business showing the name of the proprietor and 
the business, or businesses, in which engaged.

(26 U.S.C. 5180)


Sec.  19.192  Security.

    (a) General. The proprietor of a distilled spirits plant must 
provide adequate security measures at the plant in order to protect the 
revenue.
    (b) Buildings. The buildings, rooms, and partitions must be 
constructed of substantial materials. Doors, windows, or any other 
openings to the building must be secured or fastened during times when 
distilled spirits plant operations are not being conducted.
    (c) Outdoor tanks. Outdoor tanks containing spirits, denatured 
spirits, or wine must be individually locked or locked within an 
enclosure when they are not in use.
    (d) Indoor tanks. Indoor tanks containing spirits, denatured 
spirits, or wines, or the rooms or buildings in which such tanks are 
housed, must be equipped so that they may be secured.
    (e) Approved locks. Locks meeting the specifications prescribed in 
paragraph (f) of this section must be used to secure:
    (1) Outdoor tanks used to store spirits, or an enclosure around 
such tanks;
    (2) Indoor tanks used to store spirits, or the door from which 
access may be gained from the outside to the rooms or buildings in 
which such tanks are housed; and
    (3) Any doors from which access may be gained from the outside to 
rooms or buildings containing spirits stored in portable bulk 
containers.

[[Page 26250]]

    (f) Specifications for locks. Locks meeting the specifications in 
this section or other locks that have been approved for use by the 
appropriate TTB officer are approved locks for the purpose of 26 U.S.C. 
5682.
    (1) General. The following are the specifications for approved 
locks:
    (i) A corresponding serial number on the lock and on the key,

    (iv) A captured key feature (the key may not be removed while the 
shackle is unlocked);
    (v) A tumbler with at least 5 pins; and
    (vi) A lock and key containing no bitting data.
    (2) Other approved locks. If the proprietor wishes to use locks of 
an unusual design, which do not meet the specifications in paragraph 
(f)(1) of this section, the proprietor must submit an example or 
prototype of the lock to the appropriate TTB officer, with a request 
that the lock be approved for use. The appropriate TTB officer will 
evaluate the lock and determine whether the lock should be approved for 
use.
    (3) Master key systems. Master key locking systems using approved 
locks may be used at the option of the proprietor.
    (g) Additional security. Whenever the appropriate TTB officer finds 
that the construction, arrangement, equipment, or protection is 
inadequate, additional security (such as fences, flood lights, alarm 
systems, and guard services) must be provided or changes in 
construction, arrangement, or equipment must be made to the extent 
necessary to protect the revenue.

(26 U.S.C. 5178, 5202, 5682)


Sec.  19.193  Breaking Government locks.

    TTB may assign TTB officers to a distilled spirits plant and 
utilize controls, such as Government locks, if TTB determines that such 
measures are necessary to effectively supervise operations at the 
plant. The proprietor may not remove such Government locks without the 
authorization of the appropriate TTB officer, except when a person or 
property is in imminent danger from a disaster or other emergency. If 
the proprietor must remove Government locks under such circumstances, 
the proprietor must ensure that security measures are taken to prevent 
illegal removal of spirits. In addition, the proprietor must notify the 
appropriate TTB officer as soon as possible of the action taken and 
within 5 days of removing the locks submit a written report describing 
the emergency and the action taken.

(26 U.S.C. 5202)

Subpart H--Special (Occupational) Tax


Sec.  19.201  Liability for special (occupational) tax.

    (a) General liability for tax. Special tax is an occupational tax 
imposed by the IRC, and TTB is responsible for collecting this tax. A 
proprietor of a distilled spirits plant must file a special tax return 
and pay a special (occupational) tax at the rate specified in Sec.  
19.202. The proprietor must pay this tax on or before the date of 
commencing business as a distilled spirits plant, and thereafter every 
year on or before July 1. When a proprietor first commences business, 
the tax liability will be computed from the first day of the month in 
which the business starts through the following June 30. Thereafter, 
the tax must be computed for the entire year (July 1 through June 30).
    (b) Suspension of tax. During the period from July 1, 2005, through 
June 30, 2008, the rate of the tax referred to in paragraph (a) of this 
section is zero. However, the proprietor must still register by filing 
the special tax return on form TTB F 5630.5 during this suspension 
period even though the amount of tax due is zero. During the suspension 
period, as at other times, the special tax return is due on or before 
the proprietor commences business and on or before July 1 of each year 
thereafter.

(26 U.S.C. 5081, 5142, 5143)


Sec.  19.202  Special (occupational) tax rates.

    During the period from July 1, 2005, through June 30, 2008, the 
rate of the tax is zero. At all other times, there are two rates of 
special tax for distilled spirits plants. The rate depends upon the 
gross receipts of the business. The annual rates are:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                               Then the
                            If--                              annual tax
                                                              rate is--
------------------------------------------------------------------------
the taxable-year gross receipts are less than $500,000,....         $500
the taxable-year gross receipts are $500,000 or more,......       $1,000
------------------------------------------------------------------------

(26 U.S.C. 5081)


Sec.  19.203  Eligibility for the reduced rate.

    (a) General. Except during the suspension period described in Sec.  
19.201(b) when the tax rate is zero, 26 U.S.C. 5081(b) provides for a 
reduced tax rate of $500 per year for small proprietors. A proprietor 
is eligible to pay the reduced rate as a small proprietor if the 
proprietor's total gross receipts for the income tax year that most 
recently ended are less than $500,000. All gross receipts must be 
included, not just the gross receipts of the activity subject to 
special tax. Further, proprietors of new businesses that have not yet 
begun a taxable year, as well as proprietors of existing businesses 
that have not yet ended a taxable year, who commence a new activity 
subject to special tax, may qualify for the reduced rate in the initial 
tax year if gross receipts for the business (or the entire controlled 
group, if the proprietor is a member of a controlled group) were under 
$500,000 during the income tax year that most recently ended. If the 
proprietor is a member of a controlled group, the rules under paragraph 
(b) of this section will apply.
    (b) Controlled Group. If the proprietor is a member of a controlled 
group, the controlled group will be treated as a single taxpayer for 
the purpose of determining gross receipts under paragraph (a) of this 
section. A controlled group is defined in subpart D of part 70 of this 
chapter.
    (c) Special rules for gross receipts. For any taxable year shorter 
than 12 months, the proprietor must project annual gross receipts for a 
12 month period. To make this projection, the proprietor must multiply 
gross receipts for the short period by 12 and divide the result by the 
number of months in the short period. Gross receipts for any taxable 
year will be reduced by returns and allowances made during that year 
under 26 U.S.C. 448(c)(3).

(26 U.S.C. 448, 5061, 5081)


Sec.  19.204  Exemption for alcohol fuel producers.

    Some alcohol fuel producers are exempt from special tax. For 
further information, see subpart X of this part.

(26 U.S.C. 5081, 5181)


Sec.  19.205  Locations subject to tax.

    (a) A proprietor must pay special (occupational) tax, or must 
register during the suspension period described in Sec.  19.201(b), for 
each place of business at which an occupation subject to special tax is 
conducted. A ``place of business'' means the entire office, plant, or 
area of the business in any one location under the same proprietorship. 
Passageways, streets, highways, rail crossings, waterways, or 
partitions dividing the premises are not sufficient separation to 
require additional special tax, if the premises are otherwise 
contiguous.
    (b) A proprietor does not incur additional special tax liability, 
and is not required to register during the

[[Page 26251]]

suspension period described in Sec.  19.201(b), for the sale of liquor 
made at a location other than the distilled spirits plant premises 
described on the notice of registration, Form 5110.41, if the location 
where such sales are made is the same place of business as described in 
paragraph (a) of this section.

(26 U.S.C. 5081, 5113, 5142, 5143)


Sec.  19.206  Liability as a wholesale or retail dealer.

    (a) General. A proprietor of a distilled spirits plant shall be 
subject to or exempt from a liquor dealer's special (occupational) tax 
as provided in part 31 of this chapter.
    (b) Exemption for sales by a proprietor of a distilled spirits 
plant. A proprietor of a distilled spirits plant is not required to pay 
special tax, or to register during the suspension period described in 
Sec.  19.201(b), as a wholesale or retail dealer in liquor because of 
sales at the principal place of business, or at the distilled spirits 
plant, of liquor that at the time of sale is stored at the distilled 
spirits plant or which had been removed and stored in a taxpaid 
storeroom operated in connection with the distilled spirits plant. Each 
proprietor of a distilled spirits plant may have only one exemption 
from a dealer's special tax payment or dealer's registration for each 
distilled spirits plant. The proprietor may designate, in writing to 
the appropriate TTB officer, that the principal place of business is 
exempt from dealer's special (occupational) tax or registration; 
otherwise, the exemption will apply to the distilled spirits plant.

(26 U.S.C. 5113)


Sec.  19.207  Special tax returns.

    (a) Form. A proprietor must file TTB F 5630.5, Special Tax 
Registration and Return, in order to:
    (1) Pay special (occupational) tax when the tax is due, or
    (2) Register during the period July 1, 2005, through June 30, 2008, 
when the tax is suspended.
    (b) Information for the return or registration. A proprietor must 
follow the instructions on the Special Tax Registration and Return, TTB 
F 5630.5 providing all the required information including:
    (1) The name as the taxpayer;
    (2) The trade name(s) (if any) of the business(es) subject to 
special tax;
    (3) The employer identification number (see Sec.  19.210);
    (4) The exact location of the place of business, by name and number 
of building or street or if these do not exist, by some description in 
addition to the post office address. In the case of one return for two 
or more locations, the address shown will be the principal place of 
business (or principal office, in the case of a corporate taxpayer);
    (5) The class(es) of special (occupational) tax to which the 
proprietor is subject, or to which the registration relates during the 
suspension period referred to in paragraph (a)(2) of this section; and
    (6) Ownership and control information: that is, the name, position, 
and residence address of every owner of the business and of every other 
person having power to control the management and policies with respect 
to the activity subject to special tax. For purposes of this section, 
an owner includes every partner of a partnership and every person 
owning 10% or more of the stock of a limited liability company or 
corporation. However, the ownership and control information required by 
this paragraph does not need to be stated if the same information has 
been previously provided to TTB in connection with a permit 
application, and if the information previously provided is still 
current.

(26 U.S.C. 6151, 7011)


Sec.  19.208  Multiple locations and multiple tax classes.

    A proprietor subject to special (occupational) tax, or required to 
register during the suspension period referred to in Sec.  19.201(b), 
for the same period at more than one location or for more than one tax 
class, must:
    (a) Prepare, sign and file one special tax registration and return 
on TTB F 5630.5;
    (b) Include any applicable tax payment, to cover all locations and 
classes of tax;
    (c) Prepare, in duplicate, a list identified with the proprietor's 
name, address (as shown on Form 5630.5), employer identification 
number, and period covered by the return. The list shall show, by 
States, the name, address, and tax class of each location for which 
special tax is being paid, or for which registration is being made 
during the suspension period described in Sec.  19.201(b). The original 
of the list will be filed in accordance with instructions on the 
return, and the copy shall be retained at the proprietor's principal 
place of business (or principal office, in the case of a corporate 
taxpayer) for the period of three years from the last day of the return 
period.

(26 U.S.C. 6151, 7011)


Sec.  19.209  Signing special tax returns.

    (a) Ordinary returns. The proprietor must sign all tax returns. The 
individual must sign the return of an individual proprietor. A general 
partner must sign the return for a partnership. An officer of a 
corporation will sign the return for a corporation. In each case, the 
person signing the return will designate his or her capacity as 
``individual owner,'' ``general partner,'' or, in the case of a 
corporation, the title of the officer.
    (b) Fiduciaries. A receiver, trustee, assignee, executor, 
administrator, or other legal representative who continues the business 
of a bankrupt, insolvent, deceased, or other person, must indicate the 
fiduciary capacity in which the person is acting.
    (c) Agent or attorney in fact. If a return is signed by an agent or 
attorney in fact, the signature must be preceded by the name of the 
principal and followed by the title of the agent or attorney in fact. A 
return signed by a person as agent will not be accepted unless a power 
of attorney authorizing the agent to perform the act is filed with the 
TTB office with which the return is filed.
    (d) Perjury statement. Form TTB F 5630.5 must contain or be 
verified by a written declaration that the return has been executed 
under the penalties of perjury.

(26 U.S.C. 6061, 6062, 6063, 6064, 6065)


Sec.  19.210  Employer identification number.

    (a) Requirement. A proprietor must enter the employer 
identification number (EIN) assigned to the proprietor by the Internal 
Revenue Service on the special tax return, including any amended 
return, filed under this subpart. Failure to enter the assigned EIN on 
the return may result in a $50.00 penalty for each occurrence as 
specified in Sec.  70.113 of this chapter.
    (b) Application for employer identification number. Each proprietor 
who files a special tax return, who has not already been assigned an 
employer identification number, must file IRS Form SS-4 to apply for 
one. The proprietor will apply for and be assigned only one employer 
identification number, regardless of the number of places of business 
for which the proprietor is required to file a special tax return. The 
proprietor must apply for an employer identification number no later 
than 7 days after the filing of the taxpayer's first special tax 
return.

(26 U.S.C. 6109)


Sec.  19.211  Issuance, distribution, and examination of special tax 
stamps.

    (a) Issuance of special tax stamps--(1) General. Except as provided 
in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, TTB will issue to the proprietor a 
special tax

[[Page 26252]]

stamp upon filing a properly executed TTB F 5630.5, Special Tax 
Registration and Return, along with any applicable tax. If the return 
covers multiple locations, TTB will issue one appropriately designated 
stamp for each location listed on the attachment that Sec.  19.208 
requires, but showing, as to name and address, only the name of the 
proprietor and the address of the proprietor's principal place of 
business (or principal office in the case of a corporate taxpayer).
    (2) Exception for suspension period. During the suspension period 
described in Sec.  19.201(b), when registration is required but no tax 
is due, TTB will not issue a special tax stamp.
    (b) Distribution of special tax stamps for multiple locations. On 
receipt of the special tax stamps, the proprietor will verify that 
there is one stamp for each location listed on the attachment to form 
TTB F 5630.5. The proprietor will designate one stamp for each location 
and will type on each stamp the address of the business conducted at 
the location for which that stamp is designated. The taxpayer will then 
forward each stamp to the place of business designated on the stamp.
    (c) Examination of special tax stamps. The proprietor will keep all 
stamps denoting payment of special tax available at the location for 
which designated for inspection by appropriate TTB officers during 
business hours.

(26 U.S.C. 5146, 6806)


Sec.  19.212  Change in name.

    If there is a change in the corporate or firm name, or in the trade 
name, as shown on Form 5630.5, the proprietor will file an amended 
special tax return as soon as practicable after the change, covering 
the new corporate or firm name, or trade name. No new special tax is 
required to be paid. The proprietor will attach the special tax stamp 
for endorsement of the change in name except if the change occurs 
during the suspension period described in Sec.  19.201(b).

(26 U.S.C. 5143, 7011)


Sec.  19.213  Change in proprietorship.

    (a) General. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, 
if there is a change in the proprietorship of a distilled spirits 
plant, the successor must file a new special tax return, pay a new 
special tax, and obtain the required special tax stamps. However, if 
the change in proprietorship occurs during the suspension period 
described in Sec.  19.201(b) when no tax is due and no stamp is issued, 
the successor is only required to file a new special tax return.
    (b) Exception. Persons having the right of succession provided for 
in paragraph (c) of this section may carry on the business for the 
remainder of the period for which the special tax was paid (or for 
which registration was made during the suspension period described in 
Sec.  19.201(b)), without paying a new special tax, if within 30 days 
after the date on which the successor begins to carry on the business, 
the successor files a special tax return on form TTB F 5630.5, which 
shows the basis of succession.
    (c) Right of succession. Under the conditions listed in paragraph 
(b) of this section, the right of succession will pass to certain 
persons as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                              The following person may
              In the case of:                 succeed to the tax stamp:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Death of the taxpayer.....................  The widowed spouse or child,
                                             or executor, administrator,
                                             or other legal
                                             representative of the
                                             taxpayer.
Succession of spouse......................  A husband or wife succeeding
                                             to the business of a living

Insolvency................................  A receiver or trustee in
                                             bankruptcy, or an assignee
                                             for benefit of creditors.
Withdrawal from partnership...............  The partner or partners
                                             remaining after death or
                                             withdrawal of a member.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (d) Failure to register. Except during the suspension period 
described in Sec.  19.201(b), a person who is a successor to a business 
for which the special tax has been paid and who fails to register the 
succession is liable for the special tax computed from the first day of 
the calendar month in which the successor began to carry on the 
business. During the suspension period, a failure to register the 
succession may result in a penalty under 26 U.S.C. 5603(b).

(26 U.S.C. 5143, 7011)


Sec.  19.214  Change in location.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, if there 
is a change in location of a taxable place of business, the proprietor 
will, within 30 days after the change, file an amended special tax 
return covering the new location. The proprietor will attach the 
special tax stamp or stamps, for endorsement of the change in location. 
No new special tax must be paid. However, if the proprietor does not 
file the amended return within 30 days, the proprietor must file a new 
special tax return, pay a new special tax, and obtain a new special tax 
stamp.
    (b) If the change in location occurs during the suspension period 
described in Sec.  19.201(b) when no tax is due and no special tax 
stamp is issued, the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section 
still apply, except with regard to attachment of a special tax stamp 
and payment of a new special tax. During the suspension period, a 
failure to comply with paragraph (a) of this section may result in a 
penalty under 26 U.S.C. 5603(b).

(26 U.S.C. 5143, 7011)

Subpart I--Distilled Spirits Taxes


Sec.  19.221  Scope.

    This subpart covers the taxation of distilled spirits and the 
procedures for payment of taxes by proprietors of distilled spirits 
plants. Issues covered in this subpart include: tax rates, liability 
for tax, tax determination, return periods, filing of tax returns, 
forms of payment, electronic fund transfers, and credits under 26 
U.S.C. 5010.

(26 U.S.C. 5001)

Basic Provisions of Tax Law Affecting Spirits


Sec.  19.222  Basic tax law provisions.

    (a) Distilled spirits tax. 26 U.S.C. 5001 and 7652 impose a tax on 
all distilled spirits produced in, or imported into or brought into, 
the United States at the rate prescribed in section 5001 on each proof 
gallon and a proportionate tax at a like rate on all fractional parts 
of a proof gallon. For the current rate of tax see 26 U.S.C. 5001.
    (b) Products containing distilled spirits. All products of 
distillation, by whatever name known, which contain distilled spirits, 
on which the tax imposed by law has not been paid, and any alcoholic 
ingredient added to such products, are considered and taxed as 
distilled spirits.
    (c) Wines with high alcohol content. Wines containing more than 24 
percent of alcohol by volume are taxed as distilled spirits.
    (d) Attachment of the tax. Under 26 U.S.C. 5001(b), the tax 
attaches to distilled spirits as soon as the substance comes into 
existence as such, whether it be subsequently separated as pure or 
impure spirits, or be immediately, or at any subsequent time, 
transferred into any other substance, either in the process of original 
production, or by any subsequent process.
    (e) Alcohol tax is a lien on spirits. Under 26 U.S.C. 5004, the tax 
becomes a first lien on the distilled spirits from the time the spirits 
come into existence as such. The conditions under which the first lien 
terminates are described in 26 U.S.C. 5004.
    (f) Tax credit for eligible wines and eligible flavors. Under 26 
U.S.C. 5010, a

[[Page 26253]]

credit against the tax imposed on distilled spirits by 26 U.S.C. 5001 
or 7652 on each proof gallon of alcohol derived from eligible wine, or 
from eligible flavors which do not exceed 2\1/2\% of the finished 
product on a proof gallon basis is allowed at the time the tax is 
payable as if it constituted a reduction in the rate of tax.
    (g) Effective tax rates. Where credit against the tax is desired, 
the proprietor liable for the tax must establish an effective tax rate 
in accordance with Sec.  19.246. The effective tax rate established 
will be applied to each withdrawal or other taxable disposition of the 
distilled spirits.

(26 U.S.C. 5001, 5004, 5010, 7652)


Sec.  19.223  Persons liable for tax.

    (a) Distilling. Under 26 U.S.C. 5005, the distiller of spirits is 
liable for the tax and each proprietor or possessor of, and person in 
any manner interested in the use of, any still, distilling apparatus, 
or distillery, shall be jointly and severally liable for the tax on 
distilled spirits produced. However, a person, not an officer or 
director of a corporate proprietor, owning or having the right of 
control of not more than 10 percent of any class of stock of that 
proprietor, is not liable by reason of the stock ownership or control. 
Persons transferring spirits in bond are relieved of tax liability if:
    (1) The proprietors of transferring and receiving distilled spirits 
plant premises are independent of each other and neither has a 
proprietary interest, directly or indirectly, in the business of the 
other, and
    (2) No person liable for the tax on transferred spirits retains any 
interest in the spirits.
    (b) Storage on bonded premises. Under 26 U.S.C. 5005(c) each person 
operating bonded premises will be liable for the tax on all spirits 
while the spirits are stored on the premises, and on all spirits which 
are in transit to the premises from the time of removal from the 
transferor's bonded premises, pursuant to an approved application. 
Liability for the tax continues until the spirits are transferred or 
withdrawn from bonded premises as authorized by law, or until the 
liability for tax is relieved under the provisions of 26 U.S.C. 
5008(a). Claims for relief from liability for spirits lost are covered 
in subpart J of this part. Voluntary destruction of spirits in bond is 
covered in subpart Q of this part.
    (c) Withdrawals without payment of tax. Under 26 U.S.C. 5005(e), 
any person who withdraws spirits from the bonded premises of a plant 
without payment of tax, as provided in 26 U.S.C. 5214, will be liable 
for the tax on the spirits from the time of withdrawal. The person will 
be relieved of any liability at the time the spirits are exported, 
deposited in a foreign-trade zone, used in production of wine, 
deposited in a customs bonded warehouse, laden as supplies upon or used 
in the maintenance or repair of certain vessels or aircraft, or used 
for certain research, development or testing, as provided by law.
    (d) Withdrawals free of tax. Persons liable for tax under paragraph 
(a) of this section, are relieved of the liability on spirits withdrawn 
from bonded premises free of tax under this part, at the time the 
spirits are withdrawn.
    (e) Withdrawn from customs custody without payment of tax. Under 26 
U.S.C. 5232(a) when imported distilled spirits in bulk containers are 
withdrawn from customs custody and transferred to the bonded premises 
of a distilled spirits plant without payment of the tax imposed on 
imported distilled spirits by 26 U.S.C. 5001, the person operating the 
bonded premises of the distilled spirits plant to which spirits are 
transferred will become liable for the tax on the spirits upon their 
release from customs custody, and the importer will thereupon be 
relieved of liability for the tax.

(26 U.S.C. 5005, 5066, 5232)

Requirements for Gauging and Tax Determination


Sec.  19.225  Requirement to gauge and tax determine spirits.

    Before withdrawing distilled spirits from bond, the proprietor must 
gauge the spirits and determine the tax that is due on the spirits. 
This requirement applies to all spirits on which the tax will be either 
prepaid or deferred.

(26 U.S.C. 5006, 5204, 5213)


Sec.  19.226  Gauges for tax determination.

    There are several acceptable methods that a proprietor may use when 
gauging spirits for tax determination.
    (a) Cases. If spirits are withdrawn from the bonded premises in 
cases, the proprietor must gauge the spirits based on the contents of 
the cases. The proprietor will determine the number of proof gallons of 
spirits in cases as provided in part 30 of this chapter. The proprietor 
must convert metric units of measure to U.S. units according to Sec.  
19.579.
    (b) Packages. If spirits are withdrawn from the bonded premises in 
packages on the basis of an individual package gauge, each package must 
be gauged unless the tax is to be determined on the production or 
filling gauge. When gauging the packages, the proprietor must prepare a 
package gauge record as specified in Sec.  19.619 and attach it to the 
record of tax determination that is required by Sec.  19.611.
    (c) Tanks. The proprietor must use weight, or an accurate mass flow 
meter and proof as prescribed in Sec. Sec.  19.284 and 19.285, to gauge 
bulk spirits in tanks that are to be withdrawn on determination of tax. 
The proprietor must record the elements of the gauge on the record of 
tax determination. As an alternative, the proprietor may record gauge 
elements on a separate gauge record, and attach the gauge record to the 
record of tax determination.

(26 U.S.C. 5204, 5213)


Sec.  19.227  Determination of the tax.

    After gauging, the proprietor must determine the tax on the spirits 
to be removed from the bonded premises. The proprietor must use the tax 
rate prescribed in 26 U.S.C. 5001 to calculate the tax, unless the 
product is eligible for a reduced effective tax rate as provided in 26 
U.S.C. 5010. If the product is eligible for a reduced effective tax 
rate, the proprietor may use that rate to determine the tax. The 
proprietor must record the results of each tax determination in a 
record of tax determination as required by Sec.  19.611.

(26 U.S.C. 5213)

Rules for Deferred Payment and Prepayment of Taxes


Sec.  19.229  Deferred payment and prepayment of taxes.

    There are two basic methods of paying the tax on distilled spirits 
withdrawn from bonded premises: deferred payment and prepayment.
    (a) Deferred payment. Under the deferred payment system, the 
proprietor may withdraw spirits from bond after tax determination but 
before payment of tax. The excise tax paid is based on the amount of 
spirits removed from bond during each return period. In order to pay 
taxes under the deferral system, the proprietor must file a withdrawal 
bond or unit bond. For detailed information regarding return periods 
and filing requirements under the deferred system see Sec. Sec.  
19.234, 19.235 and 19.236.
    (b) Prepayment. Under the prepayment system, the proprietor must 
pay the distilled spirits tax after tax determination but before 
withdrawal of the spirits from bonded premises. See Sec.  19.230 for 
conditions that require prepayment of taxes.

(26 U.S.C. 5061)

[[Page 26254]]

Sec.  19.230  Conditions requiring prepayment of taxes.

    Under certain conditions, the proprietor must prepay the distilled 
spirits tax on form TTB F 5000.24, Excise Tax Return, before removing 
spirits from the bonded premises. Those conditions are:
    (a) When the proprietor has not given TTB a withdrawal bond or a 
unit bond;
    (b) When the proprietor has posted a withdrawal or a unit bond, but 
defaults on any payment of tax under this section, and the tax payment 
remains in default. The proprietor must continue to prepay the tax 
until the appropriate TTB officer decides that allowing them to make 
deferred tax payments again will not jeopardize the revenue;
    (c) When the proprietor receives a notice from the appropriate TTB 
officer that the tax must be prepaid. Such notice may be issued to the 
proprietor if--
    (1) The proprietor fails to maintain records required by this part 
to substantiate the correctness of his tax returns; or
    (2) The proprietor fails to comply with any other provision of this 
part; or
    (d) When the proprietor's withdrawal bond, or the withdrawal 
coverage under their unit bond, is for less than the maximum penal sum. 
The proprietor must prepay the tax to the extent that a withdrawal 
would cause the outstanding tax liability to exceed the limits of 
coverage under the bond. See Sec.  19.231 if the bond is for less than 
the maximum penal sum.

(26 U.S.C. 5213, 5555)


Sec.  19.231  Accounting for bond coverage.

    When a proprietor furnishes a withdrawal bond or a unit bond to 
cover the tax on spirits withdrawn on determination of tax, and such 
bond is in less than the maximum penal sum, the proprietor must 
maintain an account for the bond to ensure that outstanding tax 
liabilities do not exceed the penal sum of the bond. The account must 
charge the bond for the amount of liability incurred on each withdrawal 
on determination of tax and, credit the bond for each payment of tax 
made with a return and for authorized credits taken on a return. If the 
balance of the bond account reaches zero, the proprietor may no longer 
defer tax payments for taxable withdrawals. Where the bond is for less 
than the maximum penal sum and has been allocated among two or more 
plants, the proprietor must maintain an account at each plant for that 
part of the penal sum allocated to each plant.

(26 U.S.C. 5173, 5201)

Requirements for Filing Tax Returns


Sec.  19.233  Filing prepayment returns.

    When the proprietor is required to prepay the tax prior to 
withdrawal of spirits from the bonded premises, he must prepay the tax 
with a return on form TTB F 5000.24, Excise Tax Return, and include the 
remittance with the return. The proprietor may prepay tax for one or 
more withdrawals with a single prepayment return on form TTB F 5000.24. 
The proprietor will note the serial number of the form TTB F 5000.24, 
and the date and time of the prepayment on the individual record of tax 
determination. The proprietor may not remove spirits from the bonded 
premises until the tax has been paid.

(26 U.S.C. 5061)


Sec.  19.234  Filing deferred payment returns.

    A proprietor must pay the tax on spirits withdrawn from bond for 
deferred payment of tax by filing a return on form TTB F 5000.24, 
Excise Tax Return. The proprietor must execute and file form TTB F 
5000.24, for each return period, even when no tax is due for a 
particular return period. The proprietor of each bonded premises must 
pay the full amount of distilled spirits tax determined for all spirits 
released for withdrawal from the bonded premises on determination of 
tax during the period covered by the return (except spirits on which 
tax has been prepaid).

(26 U.S.C. 5061)


Sec.  19.235  Deferred payment return periods--quarterly and 
semimonthly.

    (a) Two types of return periods. The IRC provides for two different 
return periods for those taxpayers who pay their taxes on a deferred 
basis: quarterly and semimonthly. Small taxpayers who meet certain 
criteria are eligible to use quarterly return periods and pay their 
taxes on a quarterly basis. Larger taxpayers must use semimonthly 
return periods and pay their taxes on a semimonthly basis.
    (b) Quarterly return period. Effective January 1, 2006, a taxpayer 
who reasonably expects to be liable for not more than $50,000 in taxes 
with respect to distilled spirits imposed by 26 U.S.C. 5001 and 7652 
for the current calendar year, and who was liable for not more than 
$50,000 in such taxes in the preceding calendar year, may choose to use 
a quarterly return period. However, the taxpayer may not use the 
quarterly return period procedure for any portion of the calendar year 
following the first date on which the aggregate amount of tax due from 
the taxpayer during the calendar year exceeds $50,000, and any tax 
which has not been paid on that date will be due on the 14th day after 
the last day of the semimonthly period in which that date occurs.
    (c) Semimonthly return period. Except in the case of a taxpayer who 
qualifies for, and chooses to use, quarterly return periods as provided 
in paragraph (b) of this section, all other taxpayers must use 
semimonthly return periods for deferred payment of tax. The semimonthly 
return periods will run from the 1st day through the 15th day of each 
month, and from the 16th day through the last day of each month, except 
as otherwise provided in Sec.  19.277.
    (d) Definitions. For purposes of this section, the following terms 
have the meanings indicated:
    Reasonably expects. When used with reference to a taxpayer, 
reasonably expects means the taxpayer was not liable for more than 
$50,000 in taxes the previous year and there is no other existing or 
anticipated circumstance known to the taxpayer (such as an increase in 
production capacity) that would cause the taxpayer's liability to 
increase beyond that limit.
    Taxpayer. A taxpayer is a person who is liable for excise tax 
imposed with respect to distilled spirits by 26 U.S.C. 5001 and 7652 
under the same Employer Identification Number as defined in 26 CFR 
301.7701-12.

(26 U.S.C. 5061)


Sec.  19.236  Due dates for returns.

    (a) Semimonthly returns. Except when payment is pursuant to a 
quarterly return as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, where 
the proprietor of bonded premises has withdrawn spirits from such 
premises on determination and before payment of tax, the proprietor 
must file a semi-monthly tax return covering such spirits on form TTB F 
5000.24, Excise Tax Return, and remittance, as required by Sec. Sec.  
19.238, 19.239 or Sec.  19.240, not later than the 14th day after the 
last day of the return period, except for returns filed for September 
as provided in Sec.  19.237. If the due date falls on a Saturday, 
Sunday or legal holiday, the return and payment are due on the 
immediately preceding day that is not a Saturday, Sunday or legal 
holiday, except as provided in Sec.  19.237(c).
    (b) Quarterly returns. Where the proprietor of bonded promises has 
withdrawn spirits from such premises on determination and before 
payment of tax, and the proprietor uses quarterly return periods as 
provided in Sec.  19.235(b), the proprietor must file a quarterly 
return covering such spirits on form TTB F 5000.24, and remittance, as

[[Page 26255]]

required by Sec. Sec.  19.238, 19.239 or Sec.  19.240, not later than 
the 14th day after the last day of the quarterly return period. If the 
due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the return and 
remittance will be due on the immediately preceding day which is not a 
Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.

(26 U.S.C. 5061)


Sec.  19.237  Special rule for semimonthly filers for the month of 
September.

    (a) Returns required for September. If the proprietor is required 
to file semimonthly returns as provided in Sec.  19.235(c), there are 
three return periods during the month of September. The first 
semimonthly return period is from the first day through the fifteenth 
day of the month and the return with remittance is due by the 29th of 
September. The second semimonthly return period for the month of 
September is divided into two payment periods. The exact dates of these 
periods depends upon whether the proprietor remits tax payments by 
electronic fund transfer (EFT).
    (1) Taxpayments by EFT. If the proprietor remits tax payments by 
EFT, the two payment periods for the second half of September are from 
the 16th through the 26th, and from the 27th through the 30th. The 
return on form TTB F 5000.24 and remittance for the period September 
16-26 is due on or before September 29. The return on form TTB F 
5000.24 and remittance for the period September 27-30 is due no later 
than October 14.
    (2) Taxpayment other than by EFT. If the proprietor is not required 
to pay the distilled spirits tax by EFT, the two payment periods for 
the second half of September are from the 16th through the 25th and 
from the 26th through the 30th. The return on form TTB F 5000.24 and 
remittance for the period September 16-25 is due on or before September 
28. The return on Form 5000.24 and remittance for the period September 
26-30 is due no later than October 14.
    (b) Amount of payment: Safe harbor rule--(1) EFT Taxpayers. The 
proprietor satisfies the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section if by September 29 the amount paid is at least 11/15ths (73.3 
percent) of the tax liability incurred in the semimonthly return period 
for September 1-15, and the proprietor also pays any underpayment of 
tax resulting from the use of the safe harbor rule on or before October 
14.
    (2) Other than EFT taxpayers. The proprietor satisfies the 
requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of this section if the amount paid by 
September 28 is at least 2/3rds (66.7 percent) of the tax liability 
incurred in the semimonthly return period for September 1-15, and the 
proprietor also pays any underpayment of tax resulting from the use of 
the safe harbor rule on or before October 14.
    (c) Last day for payment. If the required tax payment due date for 
the return period September 16-25 (non-EFT taxpayers) or September 16-
26 (EFT taxpayers), falls on a Saturday or legal holiday, the 
proprietor's return and remittance are due on the immediately preceding 
day. If the required tax payment due date falls on a Sunday, the 
proprietor's return and payment are due on the immediately following 
day.
    (d) Example. Payment of tax for the month of September.
    (1) Facts. X, a proprietor required to pay taxes by electronic fund 
transfer, incurred tax liability in the amount of $30,000 for the first 
semimonthly period of September. For the period September 16-26, X 
incurred tax liability in the amount of $45,000, and for the period 
September 27-30, X incurred tax liability in the amount of $2,000.
    (2) Payment requirement. X's payment of tax in the amount of 
$30,000 for the first semimonthly period of September is due no later 
than September 29. X's payment of tax for the period September 16-26 is 
also due no later than September 29. X may use the safe harbor rule to 
determine the amount of payment due for the period of September 16-26. 
Under the safe harbor rule, X's payment of tax must equal $22,000.00, 
11/15ths of the tax liability incurred during the first semimonthly 
period of September. Additionally, X's payment of tax in the amount of 
$2,000 for the period September 27-30 must be paid no later than 
October 14. X must also pay the underpayment of tax, $23,000.00, for 
the period September 16-26, no later than October 14.

(26 U.S.C. 5061)


Sec.  19.238  Payment by mail.

    The proprietor must file each return on form TTB F 5000.24 in 
accordance with the instructions printed on the form. If the proprietor 
submits the return by U.S. mail, the official postmark of the U.S. 
Postal Service stamped on the cover in which the return is mailed will 
be considered to be the date of delivery of the remittance. If the 
postmark on the cover is illegible, the proprietor will bear the burden 
of proving when the postmark was made. If the proprietor sends the 
return with or without remittance by registered mail or certified mail, 
the date of registry, or the date of the postmark on the sender's 
postal receipt for certified mail, will be treated as the date of 
delivery of the return and also of the remittance, if included.

(26 U.S.C. 6302)


Sec.  19.239  Form of payment.

    (a) General. The proprietor must pay the tax due on spirits when 
filing a return on form TTB F 5000.24, Excise Tax Return. The 
remittance for the tax must accompany the return and may be in any form 
that is authorized by Sec.  70.61 of this chapter and acceptable to the 
appropriate TTB officer. Exception: This does not apply to payments 
that must be made by electronic fund transfer (EFT). For EFT payments 
see Sec.  19.240.
    (b) Consequences of default. If a check or money order tendered in 
payment of taxes is not paid on presentment, or where the taxpayer is 
otherwise in default in payment, then any remittance made during the 
period of default must be either in cash or by an acceptable certified 
instrument. The proprietor must continue to pay in cash or by certified 
instrument as long as the proprietor remains in default, and until the 
appropriate TTB officer finds that accepting a check will not 
jeopardize the revenue.
    (c) Certified instruments. Acceptable certified instruments include 
certified checks, cashier's checks or treasurer's checks drawn on any 
bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of the United States, 
or under the laws of any State, Territory or possession of the United 
States, or a money order, as provided in Sec.  70.61 of this chapter.
    (d) Payment of taxes. The proprietor must make checks or money 
orders payable to ``Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau''.

(26 U.S.C. 5061, 6311)


Sec.  19.240  Payment of tax by electronic fund transfer.

    (a) General--(1) Criteria requiring ETF payment. Under certain 
conditions, a proprietor may not make payments by cash, check, or money 
order. Instead, the proprietor must use the services of a commercial 
bank to pay tax on distilled spirits tax by electronic fund transfer 
(EFT). Payments must be made by EFT in the current calendar year if the 
proprietor, as a taxpayer, was liable for five million dollars or more 
in taxes on distilled spirits during the prior calendar year. For the 
purpose of determining whether the proprietor is subject to this 
requirement, the proprietor must use the total amount of tax liability 
on distilled spirits incurred under this part and parts 26 and 27 of 
this chapter (gross tax liability). Gross tax liability includes the 
distilled spirits tax on all taxable withdrawals of spirits, taxable 
importations of spirits, as well

[[Page 26256]]

as tax on spirits brought into the United States from Puerto Rico and 
the Virgin Islands during the calendar year. This figure includes taxes 
incurred at any and all premises at which the proprietor conducts 
regulated activities. The proprietor may not net out or adjust for any 
drawback, credits or refunds of tax that are allowed. Overpayments made 
in excess of actual tax liability will not be included in the gross tax 
liability figure.
    (2) Controlled group. If the taxpayer is a member of a controlled 
group, the controlled group is treated as a single taxpayer when 
calculating liability of five million dollars or more in distilled 
spirits taxes during the prior calendar year. A controlled group is a 
related group of taxpayers and is defined in subpart D of part 70 of 
this chapter.
    (3) Separate return and payment for each DSP. When the proprietor 
makes payments by EFT, the proprietor must file a separate return, form 
TTB F 5000.24 and make a separate EFT payment for each DSP from which 
spirits are withdrawn upon determination of tax.
    (b) Requirements--(1) Notice to TTB. If the proprietor's gross tax 
liability is five million dollars or more in one calendar year, the 
proprietor must notify the appropriate TTB officer of this fact not 
later than January 10 of the following year. The proprietor must use 
the total amount of tax liability incurred under this part and parts 26 
and 27 of this chapter to determine whether he must make this 
notification. Exception: this notice requirement does not apply if the 
proprietor already pays tax on distilled spirits by EFT. The notice 
shall be an agreement to make payments by EFT.
    (2) Separate EFT for each return. For each return filed in 
accordance with this part, the proprietor will direct the bank to make 
an EFT to the Treasury Account for the amount of the tax reported due 
on the return. The proprietor must give instructions to the bank early 
enough for the EFT to be made to the Treasury Account by no later than 
close of business on the last day for filing the return as prescribed 
in Sec.  19.236 or Sec.  19.237, as appropriate.
    (3) Discontinuing EFT payments. If the proprietor pays tax by EFT 
and has a gross tax liability of less than five million dollars in 
distilled spirits taxes during a calendar year, combining tax 
liabilities incurred under this part and parts 26 and 27 of this 
chapter, payment by EFT will be optional in the following year. The 
proprietor may continue to remit tax payment by EFT as provided in this 
section, or the proprietor may remit taxpayment using any acceptable 
method as set forth in Sec.  19.239. If the proprietor decides to stop 
paying tax by EFT, the proprietor must give the appropriate TTB officer 
written notice of that decision. The proprietor must attach a written 
notice to the first return on form TTB F 5000.24 filed using a method 
of payment other than EFT. Such notice must state that tax is not due 
by EFT because the proprietor's tax liability during the preceding 
calendar year was less than five million dollars. The proprietor must 
further state that future tax payments will be filed with the returns 
on form TTB F 5000.24.
    (c) Remittance--(1) Identifying EFT payments. When the proprietor 
completes the return on form TTB F 5000.24, the proprietor must 
indicate on the form that the tax was paid by EFT. The proprietor must 
file the completed form TTB F 5000.24 with TTB as directed by the 
instructions on the form.
    (2) Credit for payment. TTB will credit the proprietor as having 
made a tax payment when the Treasury Account receives the EFT. TTB 
considers the EFT to be received by the Treasury Account when the EFT 
is paid to a Federal Reserve Bank.
    (3) Record of payment. When a proprietor directs a bank to make an 
EFT as required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section, any transfer data 
record furnished to the proprietor as part of normal banking procedures 
will serve as the record of payment. The proprietor will retain this 
document as part of the required records.
    (d) Failure to make a taxpayment by EFT. The proprietor will be 
subject to a penalty imposed by 26 U.S.C. 5684, 6651, or 6656 for 
failure to make a required EFT tax payment before close of business on 
the last day for filing.
    (e) Procedure. Upon receipt of a notice filed pursuant to paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section, the appropriate TTB officer will provide the 
proprietor with a copy of the TTB Procedure entitled ``Payment of Tax 
by Electronic Fund Transfer''. This publication outlines the procedure 
that the proprietor must follow when preparing returns and payments by 
EFT as required by this part. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) will 
provide instructions for submitting the EFT payments that must be made 
to CBP.

(26 U.S.C. 5061, 6302)

Requirements for Employer Identification Numbers


Sec.  19.242  Employer identification number.

    The proprietor must enter the employer identification number (EIN) 
assigned to him by the Internal Revenue Service on each form TTB F 
5000.24, Excise Tax Return, filed with TTB. Failure to enter the 
assigned EIN on form TTB F 5000.24, may result in a $50.00 penalty for 
each occurrence as specified in Sec.  70.113 of this chapter.

(26 U.S.C. 6109, 6723)


Sec.  19.243  Application for employer identification number.

    (a) Use Form SS-4. The proprietor must obtain an employer 
identification number (EIN) by filing an application with the Internal 
Revenue Service (IRS) on Form SS-4. Form SS-4 is available from the 
local IRS Center, from the IRS District Director, the IRS Web site at 
<A HREF="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/leaving.cgi?from=leavingFR.html&log=linklog&to=http://www.irs.gov">http://www.irs.gov</A> or from TTB's National Revenue Center. The 
proprietor may file this form with IRS by mail, telephone, or fax by 
following the instructions on the form.
    (b) Time limit. If the proprietor has not already received, or 
applied for, an EIN at the time that the first return on form TTB F 
5000.24, Excise Tax Return, is filed, the proprietor must file such 
application for an EIN not later than seven days from the date of 
filing the form TTB F 5000.24.
    (c) One EIN only. Each proprietor must obtain and use only one EIN, 
regardless of the number of places of business for which the proprietor 
is required to file a tax return under this subpart.

(26 U.S.C. 6109)

Effective Tax Rates


Sec.  19.245  Tax credits under 26 U.S.C. 5010.

    (a) The distilled spirits tax. Sections 5001 and 7652 of the IRC 
impose a tax on all distilled spirits produced in, or imported into, or 
brought into the United States at the rate prescribed in section 5001 
of the IRC.
    (b) Tax credits. Section 5010 of the IRC provides a credit for the 
wine and flavors content in distilled spirits products. These credits 
effectively reduce the rate of excise tax paid on distilled spirits 
products that contain eligible wines and eligible flavors. As a result, 
the alcohol derived from eligible wine is taxed at the rates specified 
for wine in 26 U.S.C. 5041, and the alcohol derived from eligible 
flavors is not taxed to the extent that it does not exceed 2\1/2\ 
percent of the alcohol in the product. This results in an effective tax 
rate on the distilled spirits product that is lower than the rate 
prescribed in 26 U.S.C. 5001.
    (c) Eligible wine and eligible flavor. The credit for the wine and 
flavor content of a distilled spirits product is allowable only if the 
wine or flavor contained in the product is an ``eligible wine'' or an 
``eligible flavor''. To determine whether a wine or flavor is

[[Page 26257]]

eligible, refer to the definitions in Sec.  19.1, and 26 U.S.C. 5010.
    (d) Application of effective tax rates. Section 19.246 describes 
how the proprietor should compute the effective tax rate for each 
distilled spirits product containing eligible wine or eligible flavor. 
Sections 19.247 through 19.250 set forth several different methods that 
the proprietor may use in applying the effective tax rates to taxable 
removals of products from the proprietor's bonded premises.

(26 U.S.C. 5010)


Sec.  19.246  Computing the effective tax rate for a product.

    (a) How to compute effective tax rates. In order to determine the 
effective tax rate for a distilled spirits product containing eligible 
wine or eligible flavor, the proprietor must first determine the total 
excise taxes due on the product from all sources including distilled 
spirits, eligible wine, and alcohol from eligible flavors in excess of 
2 \1/2\ percent of the total proof gallons in the product. Then, the 
proprietor must determine the total number of proof gallons of alcohol 
in the product regardless of the source. By dividing the total tax 
(numerator) by the total number of proof gallons (denominator) the 
proprietor will arrive at the effective tax rate for the product in 
dollars per proof gallon. The proprietor will compute the effective tax 
rate according to the following formula:
    (1) Numerator. The numerator will be the sum of:
    (i) The proof gallons of all distilled spirits used in the product 
(exclusive of distilled spirits derived from eligible flavors), 
multiplied by the tax rate prescribed by 26 U.S.C. 5001;
    (ii) The wine gallons of each eligible wine used in the product, 
multiplied by the tax rate prescribed by 26 U.S.C. 5041(b)(1), (2), or 
(3), that would be imposed on the wine but for its removal to bonded 
premises. Three different tax classes of wine are eligible for the tax 
credit. The proprietor will have to repeat this step for each different 
tax class of eligible wine used; and
    (iii) The proof gallons of all distilled spirits derived from 
eligible flavors used in the product, multiplied by the tax rate 
prescribed by 26 U.S.C. 5001, but only to the extent that such 
distilled spirits exceed 2\1/2\ percent of the denominator prescribed 
in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
    (2) Denominator. The denominator will be the sum of:
    (i) The proof gallons of all distilled spirits used in the product, 
including distilled spirits derived from eligible flavors; and
    (ii) The wine gallons of each eligible wine used in the product, 
multiplied by twice the percentage of alcohol by volume of each, 
divided by 100.
    (b) Rounding numbers--(1) Proof gallons. When determining the 
effective tax rate, the proprietor must express quantities of distilled 
spirits, eligible wine, and eligible flavors to the nearest tenth of a 
proof gallon.
    (2) Tax rates. The proprietor may round the effective tax rate to 
as many decimal places as the proprietor deems appropriate, provided 
that the rate is expressed no less exactly than the rate rounded to the 
nearest whole cent. The proprietor must be consistent and round the 
effective tax rates for all products to the same number of decimal 
places. When rounding, if the number to the right of the last decimal 
place to be kept is less than five, it will be dropped, if it is five 
or over, a unit will be added.
    (c) Example. The following is an example of the use of the formula.

                              Batch Record
------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Distilled spirits.........................  2249.1 proof gallons.
Eligible wine (14% alcohol by volume).....  2265.0 wine gallons.
Eligible wine (19% alcohol by volume).....  1020.0 wine gallons.
Eligible flavors..........................  100.9 proof gallons.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                            [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TP08MY08.001
                                            
(26 U.S.C. 5010)


Sec.  19.247  Use of effective (actual) tax rates.

    (a) Select method of applying tax rate. The proprietor may choose 
to apply an effective tax rate to taxable removals of distilled spirits 
products in accordance with Sec. Sec.  19.248, 19.249, or 19.250. Any 
proprietor who does not elect one of these options must establish an 
effective tax rate for each batch of distilled spirits product on which 
a claim for tax credit for alcohol derived from eligible wine or 
eligible flavor will be made. The proprietor must compute the effective 
tax rates for these products in accordance with the instructions in 
Sec.  19.246.
    (b) Record tax rates used. The proprietor must record the effective 
tax rate used on the dump or batch records for the products as required 
by Sec.  19.598. The proprietor must record the serial numbers of cases 
of product removed at each rate on the record of tax determination or 
other related record. The proprietor must keep these records available 
for inspection by TTB officers.

(26 U.S.C. 5010, 5207)


Sec.  19.248  Standard effective tax rate.

    (a) Establishing a standard effective tax rate for a product. The 
proprietor may establish a permanent standard effective tax rate for 
any eligible distilled spirits product, rather than calculate a 
separate effective tax rate for each batch of product made. If the 
proprietor elects to use this option, the

[[Page 26258]]

proprietor must determine the permanent standard effective tax rate 
based on the least quantity and the lowest alcohol content of eligible 
wine or eligible flavors used to manufacture the product. Thus, the 
permanent standard effective tax rate is the highest tax rate that 
would apply to the product because it is based on a batch with the 
least amount of alcohol from eligible wine and flavors that qualify for 
the credit under 26 U.S.C. 5010. By using this method the proprietor 
forgoes the possible use of a lower tax rate in exchange for the 
convenience of using a permanent standard effective tax rate that does 
not have to be recomputed for each batch of product made. The 
proprietor must keep a permanent record of the standard effective tax 
rates established for each product, in accordance with Sec.  19.615.
    (b) Batches subject to a higher tax rate. Whenever the proprietor 
manufactures a batch of the product with a lesser quantity or lower 
alcohol content of eligible wine or eligible flavor, this will result 
in a higher tax rate on the product since the product will have less 
alcohol qualifying for the credit under 26 U.S.C. 5010 and a higher 
percentage of alcohol taxable at the rate published in 26 U.S.C. 5001. 
In such instances, the proprietor must keep the cased goods segregated 
from other completed cases of the same product subject to the permanent 
standard effective tax rate for that product. The proprietor must 
determine the tax rate for the non-standard batch in accordance with 
Sec.  19.247.
    (c) TTB review of standard tax rates. If the appropriate TTB 
officer finds that the use of this procedure jeopardizes the revenue, 
or causes administrative difficulty, the proprietor upon notification 
from TTB must discontinue use of this procedure.
(26 U.S.C. 5010, 5207)


Sec.  19.249  Average effective tax rate.

    (a) Establishing an average tax rate. The proprietor may establish 
an average effective tax rate for any eligible distilled spirits 
product based on the total proof gallons in all batches of the same 
composition which have been produced during the preceding 6-month 
period and which have been or will be bottled or packaged, in whole or 
in part, for domestic consumption. At the beginning of each month, the 
proprietor must recompute the average effective tax rate so as to 
include only the immediately preceding 6-month period. The proprietor 
must show the average tax rate established for a product in the record 
of average effective tax rates as prescribed in Sec.  19.613.
    (b) TTB review of average effective tax rates. If the appropriate 
TTB officer finds that the use of this procedure jeopardizes the 
revenue, or causes administrative difficulty, the proprietor upon 
notification from TTB must discontinue use of this procedure.

(26 U.S.C. 5010, 5207)


Sec.  19.250  Inventory reserve account.

    (a) The proprietor may establish an inventory reserve account for 
any eligible distilled spirits product by maintaining an inventory 
reserve record as prescribed by Sec.  19.614. The effective tax rate 
applied to each removal or other disposition will be the effective tax 
rate recorded on the inventory reserve record from which the removal or 
other disposition is depleted. With an inventory reserve account, the 
proprietor will tax pay removals on a first-in first-out basis 
regardless of which lot of product is actually removed.
    (b) If the appropriate TTB officer finds that the use of this 
procedure jeopardizes the revenue, or causes administrative difficulty, 
the proprietor upon notification from TTB must discontinue use of this 
procedure.

(26 U.S.C. 5010, 5207)

Assessment of Taxes by TTB


Sec.  19.253  Assessment of tax on spirits not accounted for or 
reported.

    The proprietor is required by law to properly account for and 
report all spirits that he produces. TTB will assess the proprietor for 
the tax on the difference between the quantity reported and the 
quantity actually produced.

(26 U.S.C. 5006)


Sec.  19.254  Assessment of tax for losses or unauthorized removals.

    (a) Lost or destroyed in bond. TTB will assess the proprietor for 
the tax on spirits, denatured spirits or wines in bond that are lost or 
destroyed if:
    (1) The proprietor is liable for the tax on spirits, denatured 
spirits or wines in bond, and the proprietor fails to file a claim for 
remission of the tax on spirits, denatured spirits, or wines that are 
lost or destroyed in bond as provided in Sec.  19.263(a), or
    (2) The proprietor files a claim for such loss or destruction but 
the claim is denied. Exception: The provisions of this section do not 
apply to spirits, denatured spirits or wines on which the tax is not 
collectable due to the provisions of 26 U.S.C. 5008(a) or (d), or 26 
U.S.C. 5370, as applicable.
    (b) Unauthorized removal from bond.
    (1) TTB will assess the proprietor for the tax on any spirits, 
denatured spirits or wines in bond that are removed from bonded 
premises other than as authorized by law.
    (2) TTB will assess the proprietor for tax on spirits or denatured 
spirits lost from casks or other packages as described in 26 U.S.C. 
5006(b) if the proprietor does not pay the tax upon demand by the 
appropriate TTB officer.

(26 U.S.C. 5006, 5008, 5370)

Additional Tax Provisions


Sec.  19.256  Tax on wine.

    (a) Imposition of tax. All wine (including imitation, substandard, 
or artificial wine, and compounds sold as wine) produced in or imported 
into or brought into the United States is subject to tax pursuant to 26 
U.S.C. 5041 or 7652. The proprietor may be liable for wine taxes under 
26 U.S.C. 5362(b)(3) for wine that is transferred in bond to the 
proprietor's distilled spirits plant. The proprietor may not remove 
wine from the bonded premises of a distilled spirits plant for 
consumption or sale as wine. (See 26 U.S.C. 5362.)
    (b) Liability for tax. Except as otherwise provided by law, the 
proprietor is liable for the tax on wine transferred in bond to the 
proprietor's distilled spirits plant from a bonded wine cellar or from 
another distilled spirits plant until the proprietor uses the wine in 
the manufacture of a distilled spirits product or properly disposes of 
the wine as provided elsewhere in this part.

(26 U.S.C. 5041, 5362, 7652)


Sec.  19.257  Imported spirits.

    The proprietor will incur a tax liability greater than the internal 
revenue tax imposed by 26 U.S.C. 5001(a)(1), if spirits originally 
imported for nonbeverage purposes are transferred from customs custody 
to TTB bonded premises pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 5232, and the proprietor 
subsequently decides to withdraw the spirits for beverage purposes. If 
the spirits would have been subject to a higher duty had they been 
imported for beverage purpose, the proprietor must pay a tax equal to 
the difference between the higher duty and the duty actually paid. 
Proprietors will refer to this additional tax as ``additional tax--less 
duty'' and pay it at the same time and in the same manner as the 
distilled spirits excise tax. Proprietors must compute the amount of 
``additional tax--less duty'' owed by applying this rate to the total 
quantity of proof gallons withdrawn. The proprietor must make a 
separate entry on the tax return labeled

[[Page 26259]]

``additional tax--less duty'' and show the amount of tax due.

(26 U.S.C. 5001)

    The additional tax imposed by 26 U.S.C. 5001(a)(8), on imported 
spirits withdrawn from customs custody without payment of tax and later 
withdrawn from bonded premises for beverage purposes, and the related 
provisions of Sec.  19.257, are not applicable to Puerto Rican or 
Virgin Islands spirits brought into the United States and transferred 
to bonded premises under the provisions of this part.

Subpart K--Gauging


Sec.  19.281  Scope.

    This subpart covers gauging, which is the determination of the 
quantity and the proof of distilled spirits. Topics covered in this 
subpart include: the general requirements for gauging; when gauges are 
required at distilled spirits plants; and special rules that apply to 
the gauges performed at distilled spirits plants. For additional 
requirements and procedures governing gauging, see part 30 of this 
chapter, Gauging Manual.


Sec.  19.282  General requirements for gauging and measuring equipment.

    A proprietor is required to perform periodic gauges of the spirits, 
wines, and alcoholic flavorings at the plant. A proprietor must have 
accurate and readily usable gauging and measuring equipment as required 
by this part and part 30 of this chapter. At any time, TTB may require 
that the proprietor's gauges be performed in the presence of, and be 
verified by, a TTB officer. In addition, TTB may disapprove the use of 
any equipment, or the proprietor's means of gauging, if TTB finds that 
it is not sufficiently accurate or suitable for the gauges and 
measurements to be made.

(26 U.S.C. 5006, 5204)

Required Gauges


Sec.  19.283  When gauges are required.

    The proprietor must gauge spirits, wine, and alcoholic flavoring 
materials when they are:
    (a) Produced and entered for deposit;
    (b) Filled into packages from storage tanks;
    (c) Transferred or received in bond;
    (d) Transferred between operational accounts;
    (e) Mixed in the manufacture of a distilled spirits product;
    (f) Mingled under Sec.  19.329;
    (g) Reduced in proof before bottling;
    (h) Voluntarily destroyed;
    (i) Removed or withdrawn from bond;
    (j) Tax determined;
    (k) Returned to bond;
    (l) Denatured; or
    (m) When required by a TTB officer.

(26 U.S.C. 5204, 5559)

Rules for Gauging


Sec.  19.284  Quantity determination of bulk spirits.

    (a) Gauge of spirits in packages. When determining the quantity of 
bulk spirits in packages, the proprietor must determine the quantity by 
weight as provided in part 30 of this chapter.
    (b) Bulk Gauge for Tax Determination. When determining the quantity 
of bulk spirits for determination of tax or when performing a 
production gauge that will be used for tax determination, the 
proprietor must determine the quantity by weight as provided in part 30 
of this chapter or by an accurate mass flow meter. For tax 
determination purposes, an accurate mass flow meter is a mass flow 
meter that has been certified by the manufacturer or other qualified 
person as accurate within a tolerance of +/-0.1%.
    (c) Volumetric determination. Except as provided in paragraphs (a) 
and (b) of this section, in all other instances when the proprietor is 
required to gauge bulk

[[Page 26261]]

spirits in bond, the proprietor may determine the quantity by either 
weight or volume. When the proprietor determines the quantity by 
volume, the proprietor must measure the spirits by using:
    (1) A tank or bulk conveyance for which a calibration chart is 
provided, with the calibration charts certified as accurate by persons 
qualified to calibrate tanks or bulk conveyances; or
    (2) An accurate mass flow meter. For purposes of this paragraph, an 
accurate mass flow meter is a mass flow meter that has been certified 
by the manufacturer or other qualified person as accurate within a 
tolerance of +/-0.5%; or
    (3) Another device or method when approved by the appropriate TTB 
officer.

(26 U.S.C. 5559)


Sec.  19.285  Proof determination of distilled spirits.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, when the 
proprietor is required to gauge distilled spirits, the proprietor must 
determine the proof in accordance with the procedures prescribed in 
part 30 of this chapter, Gauging Manual.
    (b) Use of Initial proof. After a proprietor has determined the 
proof of distilled spirits in accordance with the procedures in part 30 
of this part, a proprietor may use the initial determination of proof 
when required to make a later gauge at the same plant. However, a 
proprietor must determine the proof again when:
    (1) A bottling tank gauge is required by Sec.  19.353;
    (2) A gauge for tax determination is required by Sec.  19.226; or
    (3) In any case where the proof may have changed.

(26 U.S.C. 5559)


Sec.  19.286  Gauging of spirits in bottles.

    When gauging spirits in bottles, the proprietor may determine the 
proof and quantity from case markings and label information if the 
bottles are full and there is no evidence that tampering has occurred.

(26 U.S.C. 5204, 5559)


Sec.  19.287  Gauging of alcoholic flavoring materials.

    Generally, alcoholic flavoring material must be gauged when dumped. 
However, when received from a manufacturer in a closed, nonporous 
container such material may be gauged by using the proof shown on the 
container label or a related statement of proof from the manufacturer. 
When the proof is determined from a label or manufacturer's statement, 
the proprietor will test a sufficient number of samples to verify the 
accuracy of the proof so determined. TTB may require that alcoholic 
flavoring materials be gauged by the methods provided in part 30 of 
this chapter.

(26 U.S.C. 5204, 5559)


Sec.  19.288  Determination of tare.

    When packages are to be individually gauged for withdrawal from 
bonded premises, the actual tare must be determined in accordance with 
part 30 of this chapter.

(26 U.S.C. 5204)


Sec.  19.289  Production gauge.

    (a) General requirements for production gauges. A proprietor must 
gauge all spirits by determining the quantity and proof as soon as 
reasonably possible after production is completed. Except as otherwise 
provide in this section, a proprietor may determine the quantity by 
volume or by weight, by an accurate mass flow meter, or when approved 
by the appropriate TTB officer, by other devices or methods that 
accurately determine the quantities. If caramel is added to brandy or 
rum, the proof of the spirits must be determined after the addition. 
Spirits in each receiving tank will be gauged before any reduction in 
proof and both before and after each removal of spirits. The gauges 
must be recorded in the records required by Sec.  19.585.
    (b) Tax to be determined on production gauge. If the tax is to be 
determined based on the production gauge, all transaction records must 
be marked ``Withdrawal on Production Gauge.'' A proprietor may 
determine the tax based on the production gauge if the spirits are:
    (1) Weighed into bulk conveyances or metered using an accurate mass 
flow meter;
    (2) Uniformly filled by weight or an accurate mass flow meter into 
metal packages; or
    (3) Filled by weight or an accurate mass flow meter into packages 
for immediate withdrawal from bonded premises with the details recorded 
on a package gauge record in accordance with Sec.  19.619.
    (c) Tax not to be determined on production gauge. If spirits are 
drawn from the production system into barrels, drums, or similar 
portable containers of the same rated capacity and the containers are 
filled to capacity, and the tax is not to be determined on the basis of 
the production gauge, the gauge may be made by:
    (1) Weighing in a tank, converting the weight into proof gallons, 
and determining the average content of each container;
    (2) Measuring volumetrically, in a calibrated tank, converting the 
wine gallons determined into proof gallons, and determining the average 
content of each container;
    (3) Converting the rated capacity into proof gallons to determine 
the average content of each container. Rated capacity will be 
determined from specifications of the manufacturer. The proprietor will 
determine the rated capacity of used cooperage; or
    (4) Determining by an accurate mass flow meter or a device or 
method approved under paragraph (a) of this section, the total quantity 
filled into containers, and determining the average content of each 
container.
    (d) Records of production gauge. For the production gauge, 
fractional proof gallons will be rounded to the nearest one-tenth and 
the average content and the number of packages filled will be used in 
computing the quantity produced. The actual proof gallons in each 
remnant container must be shown. As provided in Sec.  19.618, a 
separate gauge record will be prepared for each lot of packages filled 
(see Sec.  19.485) and for each removal by pipeline or bulk conveyance 
for deposit in bond on the same plant premises. The gauge record will 
show ``Deposit in storage'' or ``Deposit in processing.'' If spirits 
are to be transferred in bond or withdrawn from bond, the production 
gauge will be made on the form or record required by this part 
(accompanied by a package gauge record, if required).

(26 U.S.C. 5204, 5211)

Subpart L--Production of Distilled Spirits


Sec.  19.291  General.

begin or resume operations before the time specified in the notice.
    (b) Suspending operations. If a proprietor intends to suspend 
production operations for a period of 90 days or more, the proprietor 
must file a letterhead notice with the appropriate TTB officer 
specifying the date on which operations will be suspended.
    (c) Discontinuing reports. A proprietor is not required to prepare 
or file reports of production operations under subpart V of this part 
for periods during which production operations are suspended.

(26 U.S.C. 5221)

Rules for Receipt, Use, and Disposal of Materials


Sec.  19.293  Receipt of materials.

    When a proprietor receives certain materials on bonded premises, 
the proprietor must determine the quantity received and record those 
quantities in the records prescribed by subpart V of this part. This 
requirement applies to:
    (a) Fermenting materials;
    (b) Distilling materials (including nonpotable chemical mixtures 
containing spirits); and
    (c) Spirits, denatured spirits, articles, and spirits residue for 
redistillation.

(26 U.S.C. 5201, 5222, 5223)


Sec.  19.294  Removal of fermenting material.

    Material received for use as fermenting material may be removed 
from or used on bonded premises for other purposes. The proprietor must 
keep a record of use or removal as provided in subpart V of this part.

(26 U.S.C. 5201)


Sec.  19.295  Removal or destruction of distilling material.

    (a) Distilling material. Generally, a proprietor may not remove 
distilling material from bonded premises before it is distilled. 
However, a proprietor may remove mash, wort, wash or other distilling 
material:
    (1) To plant premises, other than bonded premises, for use in any 
business authorized under Sec.  19.55;
    (2) To other premises for use in processes not involving the 
production of spirits, alcohol beverages, or vinegar by the vaporizing 
process; or
    (3) For destruction.
    (b) Residues. A proprietor may remove the residue of distilling 
material not introduced into the production system from the premises if 
the liquid is extracted from the material before removal and the liquid 
is not received at any distilled spirits plant or bonded wine cellar. A 
proprietor may return residue of beer used as distilling material to 
the producing brewery. A proprietor may destroy distilling material 
produced and wine and beer received for use as distilling material.
    (c) Records. A proprietor must keep a record of removal or 
destruction as provided in subpart V of this part.

(26 U.S.C. 5222, 5370)


Sec.  19.296  Fermented materials

    Fermented materials that a proprietor intends to use in the 
production of spirits must be:
    (a) Produced on the bonded premises where used;
    (b) Received from a bonded wine cellar in the case of wine;
    (c) Beer received from a brewery without payment of tax, or beer 
that was removed from a brewery upon determination of tax; or
    (d) Apple cider exempt from tax under 26 U.S.C. 5042(a)(1).

(26 U.S.C. 5201, 5222, 5223)


Sec.  19.297  Use of materials in production of spirits.

    A proprietor may produce spirits from any suitable material in 
accordance with the proprietor's statements of production procedure in 
the notice of registration. Materials from which alcohol will not be 
produced may be used in production only if the use of the materials is 
described in the approved statements of production procedure. The 
distillation of nonpotable chemical mixtures as described in Sec.  
19.36 will be deemed to be the original and continuous distillation of 
the spirits in such mixtures and to constitute the production of 
spirits.

(26 U.S.C. 5172, 5178)

Rules for Production of Spirits


Sec.  19.301  Distillation.

    The distillation of spirits must be done in a continuous system. 
Distilling operations are continuous when the spirits are moved through 
the various steps of production as quickly as plant operation will 
permit. The proprietor may move the product through as many distilling 
or other production operations as desired, provided the operations are 
continuous. The collection of unfinished spirits for the purpose of 
redistillation is not considered to be a break in the continuity of the 
distilling procedure. However, the quantity and proof of any unfinished 
spirits must be determined and recorded before any mingling with other 
materials or before any further operations involving the unfinished 
spirits outside the continuous system. Before the production gauge, 
spirits may be held only as long as reasonably necessary to complete 
the production procedure.

(26 U.S.C. 5178, 5211, 5222)


Sec.  19.302  Treatment during production.

    During production, the proprietor may purify or refine the spirits 
by using any material that will not remain in the finished product. 
Juniper berries and other natural aromatics or their extracted oils may 
be used in the distillation of gin. Spirits may be percolated through 
or treated with oak chips that have not been treated with any chemical. 
The proprietor must destroy or so treat any materials used in treatment 
of spirits, and which do not remain in the spirits, so as to preclude 
the extraction of potable spirits.

(26 U.S.C. 5201)


Sec.  19.303  Addition of caramel to rum or brandy and addition of oak 
chips to spirits.

    A proprietor may add caramel that has no material sweetening 
properties to rum or brandy in packages or tanks prior to production 
gauge. A proprietor may add oak chips that have not been treated with 
any chemical to packages of spirits prior to or after the production

(26 U.S.C. 5201)

Rules for Redistillation


Sec.  19.314  General.

    Distillers or processors may redistill spirits, denatured spirits, 
articles, and spirits residues. Some redistillation requires an 
approved formula on form TTB F 5100.51, Formula and Process for 
Domestic and Imported Alcohol Beverages, as specified in Sec. Sec.  
5.26 and 5.27 of this chapter.

(26 U.S.C. 5223)


Sec.  19.315  Receipts for redistillation.

    (a) A proprietor may receive and redistill spirits or denatured 
spirits that:
    (1) Have not been removed from bond;
    (2) Have been withdrawn from bond on payment or determination of 
tax and returned to bond under subpart Q of this part;
    (3) Have been withdrawn from bond free of tax or without payment of 
tax and returned to bond under subpart T of this part; or
    (4) Have been abandoned to the United States and sold to the 
proprietor without the payment of tax.
    (b) A proprietor may also receive and redistill:
    (1) Recovered denatured spirits and recovered articles returned 
under Sec.  19.454, and
    (2) Articles and spirits residues received under Sec.  19.454.

(26 U.S.C. 5201, 5215, 5223, 5243)


Sec.  19.316  Redistillation.

    (a) TTB has established standards of identity for the various 
classes and types of distilled spirits. Those standards are found in 
part 5 of this chapter. If a proprietor intends to redistill spirits, 
the proprietor must ensure that the redistillation process does not 
cause the distillate to be become ineligible for designation in the 
class or type of spirits that the proprietor intends to produce. 
Therefore, spirits must not be redistilled at a proof lower than that 
allowed for the class and type at which the spirits were originally 
produced, unless the redistilled spirits are to be:
    (1) Used in wine production;
    (2) Used in the manufacture of gin or vodka; or
    (3) Designated as alcohol.
    (b) In order to preserve the class and type of spirits during the 
redistillation process, different kinds of spirits must be redistilled 
separately, or with distilling material of the same kind or type as 
that from which the spirits were originally produced. However, this 
restriction does not apply when:
    (1) Brandy is redistilled into ``spirits-fruit'' or ``neutral 
spirits-fruit''. In this case the resulting distillate must not be used 
for producing wine;
    (2) Whiskey is redistilled into ``spirits-grain'' or ``neutral 
spirits-grain'';
    (3) Spirits originally distilled from different kinds of material 
are redistilled into ``spirits-mixed'' or ``neutral spirits-mixed''; or
    (4) The spirits are redistilled into alcohol.
    (c) All spirits redistilled after the production gauge will be 
treated the same as if the spirits had been originally produced by the 
redistiller. Spirits recovered by redistillation of denatured spirits, 
articles, or spirits residues may not be withdrawn from bonded premises 
except for industrial use or after denaturation. Otherwise, all 
provisions of this part and 26 U.S.C. Chapter 51 applicable to the 
original production of spirits will be applicable to the redistillation 
of spirits. Nothing in this section affects any provision of this 
chapter relating to the labeling of distilled spirits.

    Additional information regarding labeling requirements is found in 
subpart T of this part and part 5 of this chapter.

(26 U.S.C. 5201)


Sec.  19.356  Alcohol content and fill.

    (a) General. At representative intervals during bottling 
operations, a proprietor must examine and test bottled spirits to 
determine whether the alcohol content and quantity (fill) of those 
spirits agree with what is stated on the label or the bottle. A 
proprietor's test procedures must be adequate to ensure accuracy of 
labels on the bottled product. Proprietors must record the results of 
all tests of alcohol content and quantity (fill) in the record required 
by Sec.  19.600.
    (b) Variations in fill. Quantity (fill) must be kept as close to 
100 percent fill as the equipment and bottles in use will permit. There 
must be approximately the same number of overfills and underfills for 
each lot bottled. In no case will the quantity contained in a bottle 
vary by more than plus or minus two percent from the quantity stated on 
the label or bottle.
    (c) Variations in alcohol content. Variations in alcohol content, 
subject to a normal drop that may occur during bottling, must not 
exceed:
    (1) 0.25 percent alcohol by volume for products containing solids 
in excess of 600 mg per 100 ml;
    (2) 0.25 percent alcohol by volume for all spirits products bottled 
in 50 or 100 ml size bottles; or
    (3) 0.15 percent alcohol by volume for all other spirits and bottle 
sizes.
    (d) Example. Under paragraph (c) of this section, a product with a 
solids content of less than 600 mg per 100 ml, labeled as containing 40 
percent alcohol by volume and bottled in a 750 ml bottle, would be 
acceptable if the test for alcohol content found that it contained 
39.85 percent alcohol by volume.

(26 U.S.C. 5201, 5301)


Sec.  19.357  Completion of bottling.

    When the contents of a bottling tank are not completely bottled at 
the close of the day, the proprietor must make entries on the bottling 
and packaging record covering the total quantity bottled that day from 
the tank. Entries must be made not later than the morning of the 
following business day unless the proprietor maintains auxiliary or 
supplemental records as provided in Sec.  19.580.

(26 U.S.C. 5201)


Sec.  19.358  Cases.

    (a) On completion of bottling, a proprietor must place filled 
bottles with properly affixed closures in cases. A proprietor may only 
fill cases with the same kind, size, and proof of spirits. Normally, 
the cases must be sealed; however, cases may be temporarily retained on 
bonded premises without being sealed pending the affixing to bottles of 
any required labels, State stamps, or seals. Unsealed cases must be 
marked in accordance with subpart S of this part, and segregated from 
other cases until sealed. All cases must be sealed and marked as 
provided in subpart S of this part before removal from the bonded 
premises.
    (b) Filled bottles may remain on the bottling line at the end of 
the workday if the identical product will be bottled on the next 
bottling shift and if adequate security measures are in place to 
prevent theft.

Subpart O--Denaturing Operations and Manufacture of Articles


Sec.  19.381  General.

    This subpart covers the denaturation of spirits and the manufacture 
of articles by proprietors of distilled spirits plants. Denatured 
spirits are distilled spirits that have been rendered unsuitable for 
beverage use by the addition of specific amounts of approved denaturing 
materials. For purposes of this subpart, articles are products that 
contain denatured spirits and that are made in accordance with this 
subpart or part 20 of this chapter. Proprietors who are qualified under 
this part as processors may make denatured spirits and articles in 
accordance with the provisions of this subpart. Additional requirements 
regarding the distribution, use, and standards for denatured spirits 
are set forth in parts 20 and 21 of this chapter.

Rules for Denaturing Spirits and Testing Denaturants


Sec.  19.383  Gauge for denaturation.

    (a) General. A proprietor must gauge spirits before denaturation 
and after denaturation and must record each gauge in the record of 
denaturation required by Sec.  19.606(b). However, a proprietor is not 
required to gauge either spirits that are dumped from previously gauged 
containers or spirits that are transferred directly to mixing tanks 
from gauge tanks where they were gauged. Measurements of spirits and 
denaturants may be made by volume, weight, accurate mass flow meter, or 
by any other device that has been approved by the appropriate TTB 
officer.
    (b) Denaturation and article manufacture in a single process. When 
a proprietor both denatures spirits and manufactures articles in a 
single, unified process, the proprietor may, in place of the procedure 
specified in paragraph (a) of this section, gauge the spirits before 
and after denaturation in the following manner:
    (1) Gauge the spirits to be denatured by volume, weight, accurate 
mass flow meter, or other device or method approved by the appropriate 
TTB officer;
    (2) Gauge the denaturants to be used by volume, weight, accurate 
mass flow meter, or other device approved by the appropriate TTB 
officer; and
    (3) Compute the number of wine gallons of denatured spirits 
produced, and enter this figure in the record required by Sec.  
19.606(b). In calculating the amount of denatured spirits produced, the 
proprietor must not include in the calculation the amount of additional 
chemicals or denaturants used for article manufacture.

(26 U.S.C. 5204, 5241)


Sec.  19.384  Adding denaturants to spirits.

    (a) When making denatured spirits, a proprietor must mix the 
denaturants and spirits only in packages, tanks or bulk conveyances and 
only on bonded premises. A proprietor must thoroughly mix the 
denaturants with the spirits to ensure that all of the spirits are 
effectively denatured.
    (b) If a proprietor wishes to use another method of mixing 
denaturants and spirits not prescribed in this subpart, the proprietor 
must submit to the appropriate TTB officer a written application for 
approval of the alternative method in accordance with Sec.  19.27. TTB 
may require that the proprietor submit additional information, 
including a flow diagram or other graphic representation of the 
alternative method, in support of the application.

(26 U.S.C. 5242)


Sec.  19.385  Making alcohol or water solutions of denaturants.

    If a proprietor uses a denaturant that is difficult to dissolve in 
spirits at normal working temperatures, that is highly volatile, or 
that becomes solid at normal working temperature, the proprietor may 
liquefy or dissolve the denaturant in a small amount of spirits or 
water prior to its use in the production of denatured spirits. However, 
the proof of the denatured spirits produced must not fall below the 
proof required by the approved formula. In addition, if alcohol is used 
as a solvent, the proprietor must include this additional alcohol in 
calculating the total quantity of spirits denatured in the batch.

(26 U.S.C. 5242)


Sec.  19.386  Adjusting pH of denatured spirits.

    A proprietor may add trace amounts of acidic or caustic chemical 
compounds to adjust or neutralize the pH of denatured spirits. However, 
a proprietor may not adjust the pH with any substance that will 
counteract or reduce the effect of the denaturants. A proprietor who 
adjusts the pH of denatured spirits must keep a record of the 
adjustment with reference to the formula number of the treated 
denatured spirits. The record must include the kinds and quantities of 
chemical compounds used for each batch of denatured spirits treated.

(26 U.S.C. 5241, 5242)


Sec.  19.387  Ensuring the quality of denaturants.

    (a) Testing. Proprietors must ensure that the materials they 
receive for use in denaturing conform to the specifications prescribed 
in part 21 of this chapter. In addition, the appropriate TTB officer 
may require that a proprietor test the quality of denaturants at any 
time.
    (b) Sampling denaturants. Proprietors must use good commercial 
practice when taking samples of denaturants for quality assurance 
testing. Samples of denaturants must be representative of the lot being 
sampled.
    (c) Third party testing. A proprietor may employ an outside 
laboratory or other appropriate third party to test samples of 
denaturants. In the case of a third party test, the proprietor must 
obtain a copy of the analysis or statement of findings signed by the 
chemist who performed the test. On request, the proprietor must provide 
to the appropriate TTB officer samples of denaturants for quality 
control testing in a Government laboratory.
    (d) Substandard denaturants. If TTB or a proprietor finds that a 
material does not conform to the specifications for a denaturant 
prescribed in part 21 of this chapter, the proprietor must immediately 
terminate use of the substandard material as a denaturant. However, the 
proprietor may continue to use the material as a denaturant after 
treating or reprocessing the substandard material to correct the 
deficiency and bring the material into conformity with the applicable 
specifications.

bond.
    (b) Storage methods. A proprietor may store denatured spirits on 
bonded premises in any appropriate tank, package or container 
authorized for filling with denatured spirits. The proprietor must 
store containers of denatured spirits in a manner that allows for easy 
inspection and inventory of the denatured spirits by TTB officers. A 
proprietor must store portable containers of denatured spirits within a 
building or structure that protects the spirits from unauthorized 
access. A proprietor may apply to the appropriate TTB officer for 
authorization to store containers of denatured spirits in an 
alternative manner in accordance with Sec.  19.27.
    (c) Tank Records. A proprietor must maintain a record for tanks in 
which denatured spirits are stored in accordance with Sec.  19.606.

spirits produced under different formulas on bonded premises for 
immediate redistillation at the same plant or at another plant subject 
to the provisions of Sec. Sec.  19.314, 19.315, and 19.316.

(26 U.S.C. 5241, 5242)


Sec.  19.392  Converting denatured alcohol to a different formula.

    (a) General. A proprietor may convert specially denatured alcohol 
(SDA) from one formula of SDA to another formula of SDA if the 
resultant mixture contains only alcohol and the denaturants listed for 
an approved SDA formula and in the correct concentrations, as set forth 
in part 21 of this chapter. Such converted SDA may be used only as 
authorized in part 21 of this chapter.
    (b) Converting SDA to SDA Formula No. 1--(1) All SDA other than SDA 
Formulas No. 3-A and No. 30. A proprietor may convert any SDA, other 
than SDA produced under Formulas No. 3-A and No. 30, into SDA Formula 
No. 1 by adding methyl alcohol and any one of the other alternative 
denaturants listed in Sec.  21.32 of this chapter in accordance with 
the formulation prescribed in that section.
    (2) SDA Formulas No. 3-A and No. 30. SDA Formulas No. 3-A and No. 
30 specify more methyl alcohol than is specified for SDA Formula No. 1. 
Therefore, in order to convert SDA produced under Formulas No. 3-A or 
No. 30 into SDA under Formula No. 1, a proprietor must first add a 
sufficient amount of ethyl alcohol to the SDA in question to bring the 
methyl alcohol content to the proportion prescribed for SDA Formula No. 
1. After adjusting the proportion of methyl alcohol, the proprietor 
must add the specified amount of any one of the other alternative 
denaturants listed in Sec.  21.32 of this chapter.
    (c) Converting SDA to SDA Formula No. 29. A proprietor may convert 
any SDA into SDA Formula No. 29 by adding the amount of acetaldehyde or 
ethyl acetate specified in Sec.  21.56 of this chapter. However, due to 
the presence of other denaturants from the original formula, SDA under 
Formula No. 29 that has been converted from another SDA formula may be 
used only as authorized in Sec.  21.56(b) but not in the manufacture of 
vinegar, drugs or medicinal chemicals, and the conditions governing use 
provided in Sec.  21.56(c) will apply.
    (d) Other conversions of SDA. If a proprietor wishes to make an SDA 
formula conversion other than one authorized in paragraph (a), (b), or 
(c) of this section, the proprietor must obtain approval from the 
appropriate TTB officer prior to the conversion.
    (e) Conversions to completely denatured alcohol. A proprietor may 
convert any SDA from a formula that does not contain methyl alcohol or 
wood alcohol to any one of the completely denatured alcohol (CDA) 
formulas prescribed in subpart C of part 21 of this chapter, by adding 
the denaturants specified for CDA.

the spirits transferred in each truck each day. The consignor must 
retain a copy of each shipping and delivery order. After lading the 
last truck for the day, the consignor must retain one copy of the 
single transfer record and one copy of any accompanying document and 
forward the original single transfer record and accompanying document 
to the consignee.
    (d) Packages. When a consignor transfers spirits in packages, the 
consignor must weigh each package except in the following 
circumstances:
    (1) When transferring the spirits in a secured conveyance;
    (2) When the consignor has securely sealed the individual packages; 
or
    (3) When the appropriate TTB officer waives this requirement upon a 
finding that there will be no jeopardy to the revenue.
    (e) Temporary serial numbers. When packages are weighed at the time 
of shipment, the consignor must assign temporary serial numbers to the 
packages and show for each package its gross shipment weight on a 
package gauge record prepared in accordance with Sec.  19.619. A copy 
of the package gauge record must accompany each original or copy of the 
transfer record.
    (f) Bulk conveyances and pipelines. When a consignor transfers 
spirits, denatured spirits, or wines in bulk conveyances or by 
pipelines, the consignor must gauge the spirits, denatured spirits, or 
wines and record the quantity determined on the transfer record 
required under Sec.  19.620 or Sec.  24.309 of this chapter. The

    A consignor may reconsign an in-bond shipment of spirits, denatured 
spirits, or wines prior to, or upon, arrival of the shipment at the 
premises of the consignee for any good faith reason. The consignor may 
reconsign the shipment to himself or to another consignee who is 
qualified to receive the shipment and has an adequate bond. In either 
case, an Application for Transfer of Spirits and/or Denatured Spirits 
in Bond on TTB F 5100.16 must have been previously approved for the new 
consignee, except that an approved form TTB F 5100.16 is not required 
for the transfer of wine. The bond of the new consignee will cover the 
shipment while in transit after reconsignment. When a consignor 
reconsigns a shipment, the consignor must prepare a new transfer record 
prominently marked with the word ``Reconsignment''. The consignor must 
also notify the original consignee that the transfer has been 
cancelled.

[[Page 26271]]

Sec.  19.407  Consignee premises.

    (a) General. A proprietor who receives spirits, denatured spirits, 
or wines by transfer in bond is the ``consignee'' of the shipment for 
purposes of this part. Upon arrival of an in-bond shipment at the 
consignee's premises or at the destination point specified in the 
carrier's transportation documents, the consignee must:
    (1) Examine each conveyance to determine whether the securing 
devices, if any, are intact upon arrival. If the securing devices are 
not intact, the consignee must immediately notify the appropriate TTB 
officer before removal of any spirits from the conveyance;
    (2) Determine, record, and report any losses as required by subpart 
R of this part;
    (3) Acknowledge receipt of the shipment on the transfer record as 
required by Sec.  19.621 or Sec.  24.309 of this chapter and retain the 
original of the transfer record and any accompanying documents for his 
files. Retained copies of transfer records will become deposit records 
for purposes of this part; and
    (4) Identify separately any spirits that were produced at an 
alcohol fuel plant. Those spirits may not be withdrawn, used, sold or 
otherwise disposed of for other than fuel use.
    (b) Packages. When a consignee receives spirits in packages, the 
consignee must weigh each package. The consignee must record the 
receiving weight of each package on the accompanying package gauge 
record or on a list according to temporary package serial numbers 
prepared by the consignor. A copy of the package gauge record or list 
must remain with the original transfer record. However, the consignee 
is not required to weigh each package when:
    (1) The transfer is made in a secured conveyance and the securing 
devices are intact on arrival;
    (2) The individual packages were sealed by the consignor and are 
intact on arrival; or
    (3) The requirement for weighing the packages at the consignor 
premises has been waived under Sec.  19.405(d)(3).
    (c) Bulk conveyances and pipelines. When a consignee receives 
spirits, denatured spirits, or wines by bulk conveyance or by pipeline, 
the consignee must:
    (1) Make a gauge and record the results on the transfer record in 
accordance with Sec.  19.621 or Sec.  24.309 of this chapter. However, 
the appropriate TTB officer may waive the gauging requirement for 
receipts by pipeline upon a finding that there will be no jeopardy to 
the revenue; and
    (2) Ensure that each conveyance is empty and has been thoroughly 
drained.

Sec.  19.411  Recording gauge.

    (a) Receipts into storage. When a proprietor receives into the 
storage account packages of spirits from customs custody, the 
proprietor must use the last official gauge to compute and record the 
average content of the packages received in the storage records 
required under Sec.  19.590. That gauge also will constitute the basis 
for entries on the package summary records required under Sec.  19.591. 
If the last official gauge indicates a substantial variation in the 
contents of the packages, the proprietor must group the packages into 
lots according to their approximate contents and assign a separate lot 
identification to each group of packages, based on the date the 
packages were received on bonded premises.
    (b) Receipts into processing. When a proprietor receives into the 
processing account packages of spirits from customs custody, the 
proprietor must determine the proof gallons of spirits received in each 
package. The determination may be made by using the last official 
gauge.

the required marks are placed on the packages and for preparing the 
required deposit records.
    (c) Exception. A proprietor is not required to place or ensure the 
placement of prescribed marks on packages when the spirits will be 
removed from the packages within 30 days after receipt at the distilled 
spirits plant. However, the proprietor must still assign package 
identification numbers or package serial numbers for use on deposit

    (5) The size and the proof of the sample, if known; and
    (6) The name and address of the consignee, if the spirits are

Securing Conveyances


Sec.  19.441  Securing of conveyances.

    (a) Construction for securing. When the securing of a conveyance is 
required by this part, the conveyance must be constructed so that all 
openings, including valves, may be closed and secured.
    (b) Approval of securing devices. Seals, locks or other devices on 
conveyances used to transport taxpaid spirits, denatured spirits 
transferred in bond, or denatured spirits withdrawn free of tax do not 
require approval by TTB. On the other hand, all seals, locks, or 
devices used on conveyances in which spirits are transferred in bond, 
withdrawn free of tax, or withdrawn without payment of tax, require 
approval by the appropriate TTB officer before use. However, cap seals 
at least 3/4 of an inch in diameter, ball-strap-type (railroad) seals 
with a strap at least 5/16 of an inch wide, and locking security cable 
with at least 1/16 of an inch cable may be used on conveyances without 
approval by TTB. Such seals must:
    (1) Be made of durable materials;
    (2) Bear the plant registration number or the name, or readily 
recognizable abbreviation of the name, of the proprietor;
    (3) Bear a serial number, including letter prefixes or suffixes, 
that will not be repeated within the following six month period;
    (4) Be durably and legibly marked; and
    (5) Be constructed to show evidence of tampering.
    (c) Furnishing and affixing securing devices. The proprietor must 
furnish and affix any seals, locks or other devices used on 
conveyances. However, TTB may require any conveyance in which spirits 
are transferred in bond, withdrawn free of tax, or withdrawn without 
payment of tax, to be secured by a device furnished by TTB and affixed 
by a TTB officer. The securing of a conveyance will be done:
    (1) As soon as the conveyance is loaded for shipment; and
    (2) In such a manner that access to the contents of the conveyance 
cannot be gained without leaving evidence of tampering.

Subpart Q--Return of Spirits to Bonded Premises and Voluntary 
Destruction


Sec.  19.451  Scope.

    The IRC allows a proprietor of a distilled spirits plant to return 
distilled spirits, denatured spirits, and articles to the bonded 
premises of that plant under certain conditions. This subpart covers 
the types of returns allowed, sets forth the procedures that the 
proprietor must follow when returning these products to bonded 
premises, and prescribes rules for voluntary destruction on or off 
bonded premises.

Conditions for Return of Spirits to Bond


Sec.  19.452  Return of taxpaid spirits to bonded premises for 
destruction, denaturation, redistillation, reconditioning, or 
rebottling.

    (a) Allowable returns. A proprietor may return spirits to bonded 
premises if the spirits were taxpaid or tax determined by him, by 
another distilled spirits plant proprietor, or by an importer upon 
importation through U.S. Customs and Border Protection. However, under 
section 5215(a) of the IRC the proprietor may return such spirits to 
bond only for one of the following reasons:
    (1) Destruction, in accordance with Sec.  19.459;

[[Page 26275]]

    (2) Denaturation, in accordance with subpart O of this part;
    (3) Redistillation, in accordance with subpart L of this part;
    (4) Reconditioning; or
    (5) Rebottling.
    (b) Dump and gauge of returned spirits. The proprietor must 
immediately dump spirits returned to bonded premises under this section 
unless the spirits are returned in the sealed metal drums in which they 
were withdrawn. The proprietor must gauge spirits returned under this 
section upon their receipt. The proprietor may gauge spirits in bottles 
based upon the case markings and label information in accordance with 
Sec.  19.286.
    (c) Claims for credit or refund of tax. A proprietor may file a 
claim under Sec.  19.264 for credit or refund of tax on spirits 
returned to bonded premises under this section. In addition to the 
information specified in Sec.  19.264, a proprietor filing a claim for 
credit or refund of tax must have on file at the plant where spirits 
are returned to bond the following documentation for each lot of 
spirits returned:
    (1) Documentation that establishes the amount of tax for which the 
claim for credit or refund is filed. If the spirits contain eligible 
wine or eligible flavors, the proprietor must have on file a copy of 
the record of tax determination as prescribed by Sec.  19.611, or other 
documentation that establishes the rate of tax that was paid on the 
product. In lieu of establishing the actual effective tax rate of the 
product, the proprietor may claim a credit or refund based on the 
lowest effective tax rate applied to the product; and
    (2) Credit memoranda or comparable financial records evidencing the 
return of each lot of spirits.
    (d) Applicability of IRC Chapter 51. All provisions of Chapter 51 
of the IRC and of this part that apply to spirits under TTB bond also 
apply to spirits when returned to bond under this section.

(26 U.S.C. 5008, 5010, 5201, 5207, 5215)


Sec.  19.453  Return of bottled spirits for relabeling or reclosing.

    A proprietor may return bottled distilled spirits to his bonded 
premises for relabeling or reclosing. When bottled spirits are returned 
for relabeling or reclosing, the proprietor may not claim credit or 
refund of tax on the returned spirits, and no tax will be due on their 
subsequent removal. The proprietor must relabel or reclose the bottles 
immediately and must promptly remove the spirits from bonded premises. 
The provisions of Sec.  19.363 apply to relabeling and reclosing 
performed under this section.

(26 U.S.C. 5215)


Sec.  19.454  Other authorized returns to bonded premises.

    In addition to the returns to bonded premises specified in 
Sec. Sec.  19.452 and 19.453, there are other distilled spirits 
products that a proprietor may return to his bonded premises. These 
other products, the purposes for which they may be returned, and the 
conditions for their return are listed in the table below. All of these 
products must be gauged upon receipt.

this section. There is no tax liability on spirits, denatured spirits, 
articles, or wines destroyed in accordance with this section.
    (b) Wine notice. A proprietor may destroy wine held on bonded 
premises only after the proprietor has filed a notice of intent to 
destroy with the appropriate TTB officer stating the kind and quantity 
of wine to be destroyed and the date and manner in which the wine is to 
be destroyed. The wine may be destroyed after the filing of the notice.
    (c) Gauging. A proprietor must gauge all spirits, denatured 
spirits, articles, or wines to be destroyed. The proprietor may 
establish the gauge of spirits in bottles on the basis of legible case 
markings and label information in accordance with Sec.  19.286. The 
proprietor must individually count bottles in partial cases.
    (d) Destruction off bonded premises. If a proprietor intends to 
remove spirits, denatured spirits, articles, or wines from bonded 
premises in order to destroy them at a location off bonded premises, 
the proprietor must file a consent of surety to cover the removal. When 
the destruction takes place off plant premises, the proprietor must 
comply with applicable Federal, State, and local environmental laws and 
regulations.
    (e) Record of destruction. The proprietor must record the 
destruction of spirits, denatured spirits, articles, or wines as 
provided in Sec.  19.617.

(26 U.S.C. 5008, 5370)

Subpart R--Losses and Shortages


Sec.  19.461  Losses and shortages in general.

    (a) Allowable losses and shortages. Except as otherwise provided in 
paragraph (b) of this section, TTB will not collect tax on spirits, 
denatured spirits, or wines that are lost, destroyed, or otherwise 
unaccounted for while in bond, and if the tax has already been paid, 
TTB will refund the tax.
    (b) Exceptions. TTB will collect the tax in the case of:
    (1) Theft, unless the appropriate TTB officer finds that the theft 
occurred without connivance, collusion, fraud or negligence on the part 
of the proprietor, owner, consignor, consignee, bailee, or carrier, or 
any employee or agent of any of them;
    (2) Voluntary destruction carried out other than as provided in 
subpart Q of this part;
    (3) An unexplained shortage of bottled spirits.
    (c) Burden of proof. When it appears that a theft occurred, the 
burden of proof will be on the proprietor or other person liable for 
the tax to establish to the satisfaction of the appropriate TTB officer 
that the theft did not result from connivance, collusion, fraud, or 
negligence on the part of the proprietor, owner, consignor, consignee, 
bailee, or carrier, or any employee or agent of any of them.
    (d) Claims. Claims for losses and shortages allowable under this 
section must be filed in accordance with the provisions of subpart J of 
this part.
    (e) Limitations. TTB will abate, remit, credit, or refund taxes on 
spirits, denatured spirits, or wines lost by theft only to the extent 
that the claimant is not indemnified against, or recompensed for, the 
taxes paid or owed.

(26 U.S.C. 5008, 5370)


Sec.  19.462  Determination of losses in bond.

    (a) Times for determining losses. A proprietor must determine at 
any of the following times whether a loss of spirits, denatured 
spirits, or wines has occurred:
    (1) Each time a tank or bulk conveyance is emptied;
    (2) Upon discovery of an accident or an unusual variation in a 
gauge; and
    (3) When required to take a physical inventory.
    (b) Losses from theft, tampering, or unauthorized voluntary 
destruction. Whenever any spirits, denatured spirits, or wines are lost 
or destroyed in bond, whether by theft, tampering, or unauthorized 
voluntary destruction, the proprietor may elect voluntarily to pay the 
tax on the quantity lost. If the

[[Page 26277]]

proprietor does not elect to pay the tax, the proprietor must promptly 
report the loss or destruction to the appropriate TTB officer. TTB may 
require that the proprietor file any claim for relief from the tax in 
accordance with Sec.  19.263.
    (c) Missing packages. When a proprietor cannot locate or otherwise 
account for any packages of spirits, denatured spirits, or wine 
recorded as deposited on bonded premises, the proprietor must promptly 
report that fact to the appropriate TTB officer. In such case the 
proprietor must either pay the tax on the lost spirits, denatured 
spirits, or wines or file a claim for relief from the tax in accordance 
with Sec.  19.263.
    (d) Excessive in-transit losses. A proprietor must promptly report 
excessive in-transit losses to the appropriate TTB officer. As a 
general rule, when spirits, denatured spirits, or wines are received in 
bond in bulk conveyances TTB will consider as excessive a loss that 
exceeds one percent of the quantity consigned. However, in the case of 
transcontinental transfers of wine in bond, TTB will consider as 
excessive only a loss in excess of two percent of the quantity of wine 
consigned.
    (e) Excessive storage losses. A proprietor must pay the tax on 
excessive storage account losses of spirits unless the proprietor files 
a claim for remission in accordance with Sec.  19.263 and TTB allows 
the claim under Sec.  19.268. TTB will consider a storage account loss 
as excessive when the quantity of spirits lost during a calendar 
quarter from all storage tanks and stored bulk conveyances exceeds 1\1/
2\ percent of the total quantity contained in the tanks and stored bulk 
conveyances during the calendar quarter.

(26 U.S.C. 5008, 5370)


Sec.  19.463  Loss of spirits from packages.

    (a) Tampering or theft. The appropriate TTB officer may require 
that a proprietor pay the tax on any loss caused by tampering or theft 
of spirits from packages in storage unless the proprietor establishes 
to the satisfaction of the appropriate TTB officer that the loss was 
not due to connivance, collusion, fraud or negligence on the part of 
the proprietor. As a general rule, the tax will be assessed on the 
quantity of spirits that represents the difference between the quantity 
originally entered in the package and the quantity remaining after 
discovery of the tampering or theft. However, if the proprietor can 
show that the package had already sustained normal storage losses 
before the tampering or theft occurred, the proprietor may exclude the 
amount of the normal storage losses from the quantity to be taxpaid.
    (b) Alternative method of tax assessment. If tampering or theft has 
occurred at a proprietor's plant and the proprietor has failed to use 
effective controls to prevent it, the appropriate TTB officer may use 
an alternative to the general method of tax assessment specified in 
paragraph (a) of this section. In this case, the appropriate TTB 
officer may assess on each package showing evidence of tampering or 
theft an amount equal to the tax on 5 proof gallons of spirits.

(26 U.S.C. 5006)


Sec.  19.464  Losses after tax determination.

    If a proprietor sustains a loss of spirits after tax determination 
but prior to completion of physical removal of the spirits from bonded 
premises, the proprietor may file a claim in accordance with subpart J 
of this part.

(26 U.S.C. 5008)


Sec.  19.465  Shortages of bottled spirits.

    (a) Determination of shortage. The determination of whether an 
unexplained shortage of bottled distilled spirits exists must be made 
by comparing the spirits recorded as being on hand to either the 
results of the physical inventory required by Sec.  19.372 or the 
results of any other complete physical inventory taken by the 
proprietor. When the recorded quantity is greater than the quantity 
determined by physical inventory, the difference is an unexplained 
shortage. The proprietor must adjust his records to reflect the results 
of the physical inventory.
    (b) Payment of tax on shortage. A proprietor must pay the tax on 
any unexplained shortage of bottled distilled spirits:
    (1) Immediately on a prepayment return on TTB F 5000.24, Excise Tax 
Return; or
    (2) On a deferred payment return on TTB F 5000.24 for the period 
during which the shortage was determined.

(26 U.S.C. 5008)

Subpart S--Containers and Marks


Sec.  19.471  General.

    The proprietor of a distilled spirits plant must comply with the 
container and marking requirements that apply to both industrial and 
nonindustrial spirits. This subpart covers those requirements. For the 
requirements that apply to articles made with denatured spirits, see 
part 20 of this chapter. For the requirements that apply to wine, see 
part 24 of this chapter.

(26 U.S.C. 5206)


Sec.  19.472  Need to determine use of spirits: industrial or 
nonindustrial.

    Many of the container and marking requirements set forth in this 
subpart are based on the intended use of the spirits, that is, whether 
they are for ``industrial'' or ``nonindustrial'' use. For purposes of 
this subpart, the terms ``industrial'' use and ``nonindustrial'' use 
refer to the uses specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
    (a) Industrial use. The word ``industrial'' when used with 
reference to the use of spirits has the same meaning as in Sec. Sec.  
1.60 and 1.62 of this chapter. Those uses are as follows:
    (1) Free of tax by, and for the use of, the United States or any 
governmental agency thereof, any State, any political subdivision of a 
State, or the District of Columbia, for nonbeverage purposes;
    (2) Free of tax for nonbeverage purposes and not for resale or use 
in the manufacture of any product for sale--
    (i) For the use of any educational organization described in 26

learning;
    (ii) For any laboratory for use exclusively in scientific research;
    (iii) For use at any hospital, blood bank, or sanitarium (including 
use in making analysis or test at such hospital, blood bank, or 
sanitarium), or at any pathological laboratory exclusively engaged in 
making analyses, or tests, for hospitals or sanitariums; or
    (iv) For the use of any clinic operated for charity and not for 
profit (including use in compounding of bona fide medicines for 
treatment outside of such clinics of patients thereof);
    (3) Free of tax, after denaturation of such spirits in the manner 
prescribed by law for--
    (i) Use in the manufacture of ether, chloroform, or other definite 
chemical substance where such distilled spirits are changed into some 
other chemical substance and do not appear in the finished product; or
    (ii) Any other use in the arts and industries (except for uses 
prohibited by 26 U.S.C. 5273(b) or (d)) and for fuel, light, and power; 
and
    (4) The use of distilled spirits for experimental purposes and in 
the manufacture of--
    (i) Medicinal, pharmaceutical, or antiseptic products, including 
prescriptions compounded by retail druggists;
    (ii) Toilet preparations;
    (iii) Flavoring extracts, syrups, or food products; or
    (iv) Scientific, chemical, mechanical, or industrial products, 
provided such products are unfit for beverage use.

[[Page 26278]]

    (b) Nonindustrial use. The word ``nonindustrial'' when used with 
reference to the use of spirits refers to any use not listed as an 
``industrial'' use in paragraph (a) of this section. Nonindustrial uses 
include the following:
    (1) For beverage purposes;
    (2) In the manufacture, rectification, or blending of alcoholic 
beverages; or in the preparation of food or drink by a hotel, 
restaurant, tavern, or similar establishment; or as a medicine; and
    (3) Distilled spirits in containers with a capacity of 1 wine 
gallon or less, other than anhydrous alcohol and alcohol that may be 
withdrawn from bond free of tax.

(26 U.S.C. 5206, 5301)

Requirements for Containers


Sec.  19.473  Authorized containers.

    (a) General. A proprietor may only use containers that are 
authorized under this part for use in containing, storing, 
transferring, conveying, removing, or withdrawing spirits or denatured 
spirits.
    (b) Approval of other containers. The appropriate TTB officer may 
approve the use of another type of container for a particular purpose 
in place of a type of container specifically authorized in this part 
for that purpose if the use of that container:
    (1) Will provide protection to the revenue equal to or greater than 
that provided by the authorized container; and
    (2) Will not hinder the effective administration of this part.
    (c) Approval of other container materials. The appropriate TTB 
officer may approve the use of a container made of a material other 
than one prescribed in this subpart if he finds the other material to 
be suitable for the intended purpose. If the appropriate TTB officer 
approves another material for a container, the approval may also 
specify how the container must be constructed, protected, marked, and 
used.

(26 U.S.C. 5002, 5206, 5212, 5213, 5214, 5301)


Sec.  19.474  Spirits for nonindustrial use.

    (a) Containers. A proprietor may fill spirits for nonindustrial use 
into packages or into other containers that are filled during 
processing operations, if consistent with the provisions of part 5 of 
this chapter.
    (b) Bottles and labels. The provisions of subpart T of this part 
and part 5 of this chapter govern the liquor bottles and labels that a 
proprietor must use in bottling spirits for nonindustrial domestic use.
    (c) Cases. If spirits for nonindustrial use are in containers with 
a capacity of one gallon or less the proprietor must place the 
containers in cases constructed to afford reasonable protection against 
breakage.

(26 U.S.C. 5206, 5212, 5301)


Sec.  19.475  Spirits for industrial use.

    (a) Containers. A proprietor may fill denatured spirits or other 
spirits for industrial use into suitable containers. The proprietor 
must ensure that all containers for spirits that will be used in food

health and safety laws and regulations.
    (b) Encased containers. A proprietor may encase unlabeled 
containers of denatured spirits and other spirits for industrial use in 
wood, fiberboard or similar material if:
    (1) The cases are constructed so that the surface, including the 
opening of the container, is not exposed;
    (2) Required marks are applied to an exterior surface of the case;
    (3) The case is constructed so that the portion containing marks 
will remain attached to the inner container until all the contents have 
been removed; and
    (4) A statement reading, ``Do not remove inner container until 
emptied'' or a statement of similar meaning appears on the portion of 
the case bearing the marks.
    (c) Cases. With the exception of encased containers covered in 
paragraph (b) of this section, if the containers for denatured spirits 
and spirits for industrial use have a capacity of not more than 1 
gallon, the proprietor must place the containers in cases that provide 
reasonable protection against breakage.

(26 U.S.C. 5206, 5301)


Sec.  19.476  Packages.

    A proprietor may use packages on bonded premises for original entry 
of spirits, and for packaging from tanks, storing, transferring in 
bond, and withdrawing spirits and denatured spirits from bonded 
premises. Packages must be constructed so as to be capable of secure 
closure.

(26 U.S.C. 5206)


Sec.  19.477  Use of bulk conveyances.

    If a bulk conveyance meets the construction requirements of Sec.  
19.478 or is approved under Sec.  19.473(b), a proprietor may use the 
bulk conveyance on bonded premises for the original entry of spirits, 
and for filling from tanks, storing, transferring in bond, and 
withdrawing taxpaid spirits and denatured spirits. A proprietor may use 
such a bulk conveyance to withdraw spirits free of tax, in accordance 
with the provisions of this part, for use of the United States or to a 
specified consignee if so authorized by the appropriate TTB officer 
under Sec.  19.473(b). A proprietor may also use such a bulk conveyance 
to withdraw spirits without payment of tax, in accordance with the 
provisions in this part, for any one of the following purposes:
    (a) Export, as authorized under 26 U.S.C. 5214(a)(4);

    (a) Construction. The following standards apply to bulk conveyances 
authorized by this part:
    (1) If the conveyance consists of two or more compartments, each 
compartment must be constructed or arranged so that the emptying of any 
compartment does not provide access to the contents of any other

denatured spirits. A proprietor must refrain from using, or discontinue 
use of, any conveyance

[[Page 26279]]

found by him or by the appropriate TTB officer not to meet the 
applicable requirements.

(26 U.S.C. 5206, 5212, 5213, 5214)


Sec.  19.479  Restrictions on dispositions of bulk spirits.

were not filled into wooden packages at the time of production gauge. 
When spirits have been mingled in accordance with Sec.  19.326, the 
proprietor may use only a producer name associated with any portion of 
the mingled spirits on packages filled with such mingled spirits.

(26 U.S.C. 5206)


Sec.  19.485  Package identification numbers in production and storage.

    (a) General. A proprietor must mark with a lot identification 
number each package of spirits filled during production or storage 
operations. The lot identification number shows when the package is

they are transferred in bond in an unsecured conveyance or gauged after 
tampering within the storage account.

(26 U.S.C. 5206)


Sec.  19.486  Change of packages in storage.

    When a proprietor transfers spirits from one package to another as 
permitted in Sec.  19.325, the proprietor must give the new package the 
same package identification number and marks as the original package. 
The proprietor must also prepare and sign a label to be affixed to the 
head of each new package. The label must be in the following form:

package identification No. --------, were transferred from a -------- 
[kind of cooperage: barrel or drum], on -------- [Date], -------- 
[Proprietor]

(26 U.S.C. 5206)


Sec.  19.487  Kind of spirits.

    (a) Designation. The designations of kind of spirits required for 
packages filled on bonded premises must be consistent with the classes 
and types of spirits set forth in part 5 of this chapter subject to the 
following exceptions or conditions:
    (1) A proprietor may designate as ``Alcohol'' spirits distilled at 
more than 160[deg] proof, which lack the taste, aroma, and other 
characteristics generally attributed to whisky, brandy, rum, or gin, 
and which are substantially neutral in character. When alcohol so 
designated is withdrawn on determination of tax, the designation

[[Page 26280]]

must consist of the word ``Alcohol'' preceded or followed by a word or 
phrase that describes the material from which the alcohol was produced;
    (2) The designation for vodka, neutral spirits, or gin must include 
a word or phrase that describes the material from which the spirits 
were produced;
    (3) A proprietor may designate as ``Spirits'', preceded or followed 
by a word or phrase that describes the material from which the spirits 
were produced, those distilled spirits that are distilled at less than 
190[deg] proof which lack the taste, aroma, and other characteristics 
generally attributed to whisky, brandy, rum, or gin. However, the 
proprietor may not designate such spirits as ``Spirits grain'' or 
``Grain spirits'';
    (4) A proprietor must designate spirits distilled from fruit at or 
above 190[deg] proof, if intended for use in wine production, as 
``Neutral Spirits-Fruit'', preceded or followed by the name of the 
fruit from which the spirits were produced;
    (5) A proprietor may designate as ``Whisky'' spirits distilled at 
not more than 160[deg] proof from a fermented mash of not less than 51 
percent rye, corn, wheat, malted barley, or malted rye grain, packaged 
in reused cooperage, provided that the designation is further qualified 
with the words ``Distilled from rye mash'' (or bourbon, wheat, malt, or 
rye malt mash, as the case may be). However, spirits designated as 
``Whisky'' must, if distilled from a fermented mash of not less than 80 
percent corn, carry the designation ``Corn Whisky.''
    (b) Change of designation. After written application to, and 
approval of, the appropriate TTB officer, a proprietor may at any time 
before their withdrawal from bonded premises, change the original 
designation for spirits to a new designation properly describing the 
spirits in accordance with the provisions of this section.
    (c) Other designations. If a proprietor proposes to produce spirits 
for which a designation has not been prescribed in this section or in 
part 5 of this chapter, the proprietor must first make written 
application to the appropriate TTB officer for a designation for such 
spirits, and the proprietor must then designate the spirits 
accordingly.
    (d) Spirits for nonindustrial use. A proprietor may not treat the 
provisions of this section as constituting authorization to apply 
designations to spirits withdrawn for nonindustrial use if those 
designations do not conform to the requirements of part 5 of this 
chapter.

notice to the appropriate TTB officer. The proprietor must identify 
remnant cases by placing the identifier of the last full case followed 
by the letter ``R'' on the remnant case. When there is a change in the 
name, or trade name of the proprietor, all series in use may be 
continued. However, if there is a change in proprietorship, a new

same State, and where that ``straight whisky'' is bottled by or for 
that proprietor, the label for the ``straight whisky'' may contain, in

percent-alcohol-by-volume in the units of measurement of the foreign 
country, provided that the proprietor maintains a record of the 
equivalent units as required for labels of spirits bottled for domestic 
consumption.
    (d) Waiver. The appropriate TTB officer may waive the requirement 
to show any information required by this section, other than the kind 
of spirits, upon a showing that the country to which the spirits are to 
be exported prohibits the showing of such information. In regard to 
kind (class and type) of spirits, the appropriate TTB officer may waive 
the designation required by Sec.  5.22 of this chapter, only to the 
extent that the label need not bear the word ``diluted'' for distilled 
spirits bottled below the minimum bottling proof, and provided that 
this is in accordance with the rules of the country to which the 
product is to be exported.

proprietor must maintain. In general, a proprietor is responsible for 
recording activities and transactions related to the three primary 
operational accounts at a plant: production, storage, and processing. A 
proprietor's records must show receipts in each account, movement from 
one account to another, transfers in bond, and withdrawals of spirits, 
denatured spirits, articles, or wines. The types of records that a 
proprietor must keep include:
    (a) All individual transaction forms, records, and summaries that 
are specifically required by this part;

[[Page 26284]]

    (b) All supplemental, auxiliary, and source data that a proprietor 
uses to compile required forms, records, and summaries, and to prepare

proprietors to keep their records in any particular format or medium. 
For example, a proprietor may keep required records on paper, on 
microfilm or microfiche, or on a computer or other electronic medium, 
so long as the records are readily retrievable in hard-copy format for 
review by TTB officers as necessary. The required records may consist 
of documents created in the ordinary course of business, rather than 
documents created expressly to meet the requirements of this part, 
provided that those documents:
    (a) Contain all of the relevant information required under this 
part;
    (b) Are consistent with the general standards of clarity and 
accuracy; and
    (c) Can be readily understood by TTB personnel.

(26 U.S.C. 5207)


Sec.  19.573  Location of required records.

    A proprietor may keep the records required by this part at the 
distilled spirits plant where operations or transactions occur or at a 
central recordkeeping location maintained by the proprietor. If a 
proprietor keeps the required records at any location other than the 
distilled spirits plant where operations or transactions occur, the 
proprietor must notify the Director, National Revenue Center, of the 
location where the records are kept.

(26 U.S.C. 5207)


Sec.  19.574  Availability of records.

    The records required by this part must be available for inspection 
by the appropriate TTB officer during normal business hours. If a 
proprietor keeps the records at a location other than the distilled 
spirits plant where operations or transactions occur, the proprietor 
upon request must make them available at the distilled spirits plant 
premises undergoing a TTB audit or inspection. The records must be 
produced within two days of the request except that data accumulated on 
cards, tapes, discs, or other accepted record media must be retrievable 
within five business days. Applicable data processing programs must be 
made available for examination if requested by any authorized TTB 
officer.

(26 U.S.C. 5207)


Sec.  19.575  Retention of records.

    A proprietor must retain any records required by this part for a 
period of not less than three years from the date of the record or the

    When liters are converted to wine gallons, the proprietor must 
multiply the quantity in liters by 0.264172 to determine the equivalent 
quantity in wine gallons. If cases contain the same quantity of spirits 
of the same proof in metric bottles, the proprietor must convert the 
cases to U.S. units by multiplying the liters in one case by the number 
of cases to be converted, as follows:
    (a) If the conversion from liters to U.S. units is made before 
multiplying by the number of cases, the quantity in U.S. units must be 
rounded to the sixth decimal; or
    (b) If the conversion is made after multiplying by the number of 
cases, the quantity in U.S. units must be rounded to the nearest 
hundredth. Once converted to wine gallons, the proprietor must 
determine the proof gallons of spirits in cases as provided in Sec.

Changes to Permit Information


Sec.  19.683  Changes affecting permit applications.

    (a) General. If there is a change relating to any of the 
information contained in, or considered a part of, the application on 
form TTB F 5110.74, Application and Permit for an Alcohol Fuel Producer 
Under 26 U.S.C. 5181, the proprietor must amend the information 
previously submitted within 30 days of the change unless another time 
period is specified in this subpart.
    (b) Amended TTB F 5110.74. Except when a letterhead application or 
letterhead notice procedure is followed under this subpart, the 
proprietor must submit an amended application to the appropriate TTB 
officer on form TTB F 5110.74 within 30 days of a change referred to in 
paragraph (a) of this section if the change affects the terms and 
conditions of the permit.
    (c) Letterhead applications. For the changes specified in 
Sec. Sec.  19.685(c), 19.686, and 19.690 of this subpart, the 
proprietor may submit a letterhead application to the appropriate TTB 
officer for a change instead of filing an amended form TTB F 5110.74. A 
letterhead application must be on letterhead signed by an authorized 
representative of the permit holder. The letterhead application must 
identify the alcohol fuel plant to which the application applies. The 
letterhead application change is subject to TTB approval. The 
appropriate TTB officer may, at any time, require that the proprietor 
submit an amended application on form TTB F 5110.74 if administrative 
difficulties occur as a result of the letterhead application.
    (d) Letterhead Notices. For the changes specified in Sec. Sec.  
19.687 and 19.695 of this subpart only a letterhead notice to the 
appropriate TTB officer is required. A letterhead notice must be on 
letterhead signed by an authorized representative of the permit holder. 
A letterhead notice does not require approval action by TTB. The 
appropriate TTB officer may, at any time, require that the proprietor 
submit an amended application on form TTB F 5110.741 if administrative 
difficulties occur as a result of the letterhead notice.

(26 U.S.C. 5172, 5271, 5181)


Sec.  19.684  Automatic termination of permits.

    (a) Permits not transferable. An alcohol fuel plant permit is not 
transferable and, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this 
section, will automatically terminate if:
    (1) The operations that are authorized by the permit are leased, 
sold, or transferred to another person; or
    (2) The permit holder is dissolved on a date certain or upon an 
event specified by the laws of the State where the permit holder 
operates.
    (b) Corporations. In the case of a corporation holding a permit 
under this subpart, if actual or legal control of that corporation 
changes, directly or indirectly, whether by reason of change in stock 
ownership or control (in the permittee corporation or in any other 
corporation), by operation of law, or in any other manner, the permit 
may remain in effect until the expiration of 30 days after the change, 
whereupon the permit will automatically terminate. However, if 
operations are to be continued after the change in control, and an 
application for a new permit is filed within 30 days of the change, the 
outstanding permit may remain in effect until final action is taken on 
the new application. When final action is taken on the application, the 
outstanding permit will automatically terminate.

(26 U.S.C. 5181, 5271)


Sec.  19.685  Change in type of alcohol fuel plant.

    (a) Small plants. If the proprietor of a small plant intends to 
increase production (including receipts) to more than 10,000 proof 
gallons of spirits per calendar year, the proprietor must first obtain 
an amended permit by filing an application for a medium plant or a 
large plant, as appropriate, under Sec.  19.675 or Sec.  19.676. If any 
of the required information is already on file with TTB, that 
information may be incorporated by reference in the new application. 
The proprietor must also provide a new or strengthening bond in 
accordance with Sec. Sec.  19.699 and 19.700.
    (b) Medium plants. If the proprietor of a medium plant intends to 
increase production (including receipts) to more than 500,000 proof 
gallons of spirits per calendar year, the proprietor must first obtain 
an amended permit by filing an application for a large plant under 
Sec.  19.676. If any of the required information is already on file 
with TTB, that information may be incorporated by reference in the new 
application. If the penal sum of the proprietor's current bond is below 
the amount specified for the new production level, the proprietor must 
obtain a new or strengthening bond in accordance with Sec.  19.700.
    (c) Curtailment of activities. A proprietor of a medium or large 
plant who curtails operations to a level whereby the proprietor is 
eligible to requalify as a small or medium plant may so qualify by 
submitting a letterhead application to the appropriate TTB officer for 
approval. If the appropriate TTB officer approves the application, the 
proprietor automatically will be relieved of those regulatory 
requirements that apply only to the superseded qualification. In 
addition, in the case of a change to small plant status, the proprietor 
may be allowed to terminate the bond in accordance with the procedure 
set forth in Sec.  19.170 of this part.

(26 U.S.C. 5172)


Sec.  19.689  Continuing partnerships.

    (a) If there is a death or insolvency of a partner in the business 
that holds a permit under this subpart, the surviving partner or

(26 U.S.C. 5172, 5173, 5181, 5271)

Alternating Proprietorship


Sec.  19.692  Qualifying for alternating proprietorship.

    (a) General. A proprietor may alternate use of an alcohol fuel 
plant or part of an alcohol fuel plant with one or more proprietors 
qualified under this subpart. In order to do so, each proprietor must 
file and receive approval of the applications and bonds required by 
this subpart. Each proprietor must also conduct operations and keep 
records in accordance with this subpart. Where operations by 
alternating proprietors will be limited to part of an alcohol fuel 
plant, that part must be suitable for qualification as a separate 
alcohol fuel plant.
    (b) Qualifying documents. Each person desiring to operate an 
alcohol fuel plant as an alternating proprietor must file the following 
with the appropriate TTB officer:
    (1) An application on form TTB F 5110.74, Application and Permit 
for an Alcohol Fuel Producer Under 26 U.S.C. 5181, to cover the 
proposed alternation;
    (2) A diagram of the premises, in duplicate, showing the 
arrangement for the alternation of the premises. Where operations by 
alternating proprietors are limited to parts of an alcohol fuel plant, 
a diagram designating the parts that are to be alternated must be 
submitted. A diagram must be submitted for each arrangement under which 
the premises will be operated. The diagram must be in sufficient detail 
to establish the boundaries of the alcohol fuel plant or any part of it 
that will be involved in the alternation;
    (3) Evidence of an existing operations bond (if any), consent of 
surety, or new operations bond to cover the proposed alternation of 
premises; and
    (4) Any additional information required by the appropriate TTB 
officer.

(26 U.S.C. 5171, 5181, 5271)


Sec.  19.693  Operating requirements for alternating proprietorships.

    (a) Alternation journal. Once the applications submitted under 
Sec.  19.692 have been approved by the appropriate TTB officer, the 
alcohol fuel plant, or parts of the alcohol fuel plant, may be 
alternated. The outgoing and incoming proprietor must make entries in 
an alternation journal when the alcohol fuel plant, or parts of it are 
alternated. The outgoing and incoming proprietor must enter the 
following information in the alternation journal:
    (1) Name or trade name of the proprietor;
    (2) Alcohol fuel plant permit number;
    (3) Date and time of alternation;

may be transferred to the incoming proprietor or may be retained by the 
outgoing proprietor in areas, rooms, or buildings to be alternated when 
the areas, rooms, or buildings are secured with locks, the keys to 
which are in the custody of the outgoing proprietor. Whenever operation 
of the areas, rooms, or buildings is to be resumed by a proprietor 
following suspension of operations by an alternating proprietor, the 
outgoing proprietor (except the proprietor of a small plant not 
required to file a bond) must furnish a consent of surety on form TTB F 
5000.18 to continue in effect the operations bond covering his 
operations. The proprietor must do this prior to alternating the 
premises.

Discontinuance of Business and Permit Suspension or Revocation


Sec.  19.695  Notice of permanent discontinuance.

    When a proprietor permanently discontinues operations as an alcohol 
fuel plant, the proprietor must file a letterhead notice with the 
appropriate TTB officer along with the following:
    (a) The original copy of the alcohol fuel plant permit and the 
proprietor's request that the permit be cancelled;
    (b) A written statement disclosing whether or not all spirits,

covering the discontinued operations, with the report marked, ``Final 
Report.''

(26 U.S.C. 5172, 5181, 5271)


Sec.  19.697  Permit suspension or revocation.

    TTB may begin proceedings to revoke or suspend an alcohol fuel 
plant permit in accordance with the procedures in part 71 of this 
chapter if the appropriate TTB officer has a reason to believe that a 
person holding a permit:
    (a) Has not in good faith complied with the provisions of 26 U.S.C. 
Chapter 51 or the regulations issued thereunder;
    (b) Has violated the conditions of the permit;
    (c) Has made any false statement as to any material fact in the 
application for the permit;
    (d) Has failed to disclose any material information required to be 
furnished under this part;
    (e) Has violated or conspired to violate any law of the United 
States relating to intoxicating liquor;
    (f) Has been convicted of any offense under Title 26, U.S.C., 
punishable as a felony or of any conspiracy to commit such offense; or
    (g) Has not engaged in any of the operations authorized by the 
permit for a period of more than 2 years.

(26 U.S.C. 5271)

Bonds


Sec.  19.699  General bond requirements.

    (a) Operations bond. Any person who plans to establish a large 
plant, a medium plant, or a small plant without production operations 
must provide an operations bond on form TTB F 5110.56, Distilled 
Spirits Bond, in duplicate, with the original permit application. If a 
proprietor fails to fails to pay any liability covered by the bond, TTB 
may seek payment from the proprietor, from the surety on the bond, or 
from both the proprietor and the surety. Additional provisions 
applicable to bonds for alcohol fuel plants are found in subpart F of 
this part Sec. Sec.  19.155 through 19.157 and Sec. Sec.  19.167 
through 19.173.
    (b) Corporate surety. A company that issues bonds is called a 
``corporate surety.'' Proprietors must obtain the surety bonds required 
by this subpart from a corporate surety approved by the Secretary of 
the Treasury. The Department of the Treasury publishes a list of 
approved corporate sureties in Treasury Department Circular No. 570, 
``Companies Holding Certificates of Authority as Acceptable Sureties on 
Federal Bonds and as Acceptable Reinsuring Companies.'' Circular No. 
570 is published annually in the Federal Register. The most current 
edition of the circular is posted at the website of the Financial 
Management Service, Department of the Treasury, at <A HREF="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/leaving.cgi?from=leavingFR.html&log=linklog&to=http://www.fms.treas.gov/c570">http://
www.fms.treas.gov/c570</A>. Printed copies of Circular No. 570 are 
available for purchase from the Government Printing Office.
    (c) Alternative to a corporate surety. A proprietor may also 
guarantee payment under a bond without using a corporate surety, by 
filing a bond that guarantees payment of the liability by pledging and 
depositing one or more acceptable negotiable securities having a par 
value (face amount) equal to or greater than the penal sums of the 
required bonds. Should the proprietor fail to pay one or more of the 
guaranteed liabilities, TTB may take action to sell the deposited 
securities to satisfy the debt. Pledged securities will be released to 
the proprietor if there are no outstanding liabilities when the bond is 
terminated; the provisions of Sec.  19.173 apply to the release of 
pledged securities under this subpart. A list of securities acceptable 
as collateral in lieu of surety bonds is available from the Bureau of 
the Public Debt, Office of the Commissioner, Government Securities 
Regulations Staff. Current information and guidance from the Bureau of 
the Public Debt Web site may be found at <A HREF="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/leaving.cgi?from=leavingFR.html&log=linklog&to=http://www.publicdebt.treas.gov">http://

(26 U.S.C. 5173, 5181)


Sec.  19.700  Amount of bond.

    A proprietor must determine the penal sum of the bond based on the 
total quantity of distilled spirits that will be produced and received 
during a calendar year. The method for computing required bond amounts 
is as follows:
    (a) Small plants without production operations. A proprietor who 
operates a small plant that receives not more than 10,00 proof gallons 
of spirits per year and does not conduct bona fide production 
operations must provide a bond with a penal sum of $1,000.
    (b) Medium plants. A proprietor who operates a medium plant that 
produces and receives more than 10,000 but not more than 20,000 proof 
gallons of spirits per year must provide a bond with a penal sum of at 
least $2,000.00. The proprietor must increase the penal sum of the bond 
by $1,000 for each additional 10,000 gallons, or fraction of 10,000 
gallons, that he will produce and receive over 20,000 gallons. The 
maximum bond for a medium plant is $50,000.00, representing the penal 
sum applicable to 500,000 proof gallons. The following table provides 
examples of required minimum bond amounts:

             Annual Production and Receipts in Proof Gallons
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                More than                  But not over   Amount of bond
------------------------------------------------------------------------
10,000..................................          20,000          $2,000
20,000..................................          30,000           3,000
90,000..................................         100,000          10,000
190,000.................................         200,000          20,000
490,000.................................         500,000          50,000
------------------------------------------------------------------------


[[Page 26300]]

    (c) Large Plants. A proprietor who operates a large plant that 
produces and receives more than 500,000 but not more than 510,000 proof 
gallons of spirits per year must provide a bond with a penal sum of at 
least $52,000.00. The proprietor must increase the penal sum of the 
bond by $2,000 for each additional 10,000 gallons, or fraction of 
10,000 gallons, that he will produce and receive over 510,000 gallons. 
The maximum bond for a large plant is $200,000,00. The following table
