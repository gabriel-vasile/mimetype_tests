Pliocene conditions on the Russian Plain can be reconstructed from data
provided by many researchers over the past 50 years. Palynological studies
were carried out  on the Russian Plain by Drs. E. Ananova, V. Grichuk, N.
Shchekina, S. Syabray, N. Kovalenko, Yu. Iosifova and many others; plant
macrofossils were studied by A. Negru; and faunal research was done by E.
Korotkevich (large mammals), V. Topachevsky and R. Krasnenkov (small
mammals), G. Karmishina (ostracodes), L. Il'ina (gastropods), L.
Nevesskaya and A. Chepalyga (mollusks). Paleoclimatic estimates were
obtained from the modern climatic ranges of Pliocene plant taxa following
the climagram methodology of V. Grichuk (1985).<P>

Pliocene deposits of the south-central and southeastern Russian Plain are
correlated with the stratigraphical sequence of the circum-Black Sea
region, which in turn is correlated (on the basis of faunal and
paleomagnetic data) with the Mediterranean stratigraphical framework.
Pliocene stratigraphy of the Don Plain is not worked out in detail, as the
sediments of the age are usually of fluvial origin, and thus their
distribution is discontinuous, and detailed intercorrelations are
impossible. Generally the Pliocene deposits of this region are subdivided
into the Usmanskaya and Krivoborskaya suites, which in turn include a
number of subdivisions. The sediments are mainly sands, loams and clays.
The deposits of three fluvial cycles can be found within the Krivoborskaya
suite, the middle one corresponding to the Caspian Akchagylian stage and
the upper one to the Caspian Apsheronian stage (Nalivkin, Sokolov, et al.,
1986).<P>

Pliocene deposits in the southeastern Russian Plain are more widespread
than on the Don Plain. Sediments of Pontian age (early Pliocene,
approximately 5.4 - 4.7 Ma) are found in the southwest of Astrakhan
district and in Kalmykiya, where they are represented by limestones and
clays with interbedded sands and shells (the Novorossiysk substage). These
sediments contain rare shells of Congeria sp. and a variety of ostracodes:
Cyprideis torosa, Bakunella guriana and others. These deposits were
probably formed in a brackish water shallow inlet of the Pontian marine
basin.<P>

Continental deposits of the Pliocene on the southeastern Russian Plain
(the Kushumskaya suite) are more widespread and accumulated from late
Miocene through the early and middle Pliocene time. These layers overlie
eroded deposits of varying ages and origins and underlie Akchagylian
marine layers.<P>

Upper Pliocene deposits in this region are mainly of marine origin and are
related to a transgressions of the Caspian Sea. The Akchagylian stage
(poorly dated, but estimated to range from 3.5 - 2.0 Ma) is subdivided into
three substages on the basis of mollusk and ostracode faunas and on
palynological data. The Apsheronian stage (about 2.0 - 0.7 Ma) is thought
to  be a part of Pliocene in this region, although some researchers regard
it as a part of Eopleistocene.  Apsheronian deposits are very widespread
and are represented both by marine and continental facies.<P>

At the beginning of Pontian time, the Zanklian transgression united all
the marine basins of southern Europe, including the Caspian Sea. At the
end of the early Pontian (~5.0 Ma) there was a major regression, and the
Caspian Sea lost its connection to the Black Sea.  During the early
Pontian in the southwestern region, forest and forest-steppe vegetation
dominated under warm and rather dry climatic conditions (estimated mean
January temperature was 3° C, and that of July 24° C). In the Don River
basin steppe vegetation was predominant at this time, and only riparian
forests existed in this region (Populus tremula, Alnus incana, A.
glutinosa, etc.). Unfortunately the modern climatic ranges of these
species are too broad to estimate paleotemperatures from this area. The
southeastern part of the Russian Plain was occupied by forest-steppe and
steppe vegetation.  The climate was rather warm, as indicated by the
presence of thermophilous mollusks and ostracodes.  Caspian Sea surface
temperatures were estimated from strontium isotopes on Unio and Valvata
shells to range between 11° and 22° C, which is characteristic of the
subtropical zone (N. Yasamanov, pers. comm.).<P>

During the middle Pliocene (the Kimmerian stage of the Black Sea regional
stratigraphy), marine basins occupied only the depressions of the Black
and Caspian Seas. In the circum-Black Sea region broad-leaved forests with
thermophilous elements were widespread.  The reconstructed temperatures
for the interval from 4.0 to 4.2 Ma are the warmest of the Pliocene, and
at the end of Kimmerian the area of forest cover was reduced due to drier
climatic conditions. Faunal assemblages also changed, as animals typical
of open landscapes, such as Equus and Paracamelus, appeared.<P>

Middle Pliocene deposits are scattered on the south-central Russian Plain,
and palynological data are sparse. The lower Kimmerian fauna in this
region includes steppe species (Cricetulus, Spalax, etc.). Later in the
Kimmerian faunal assemblage became more heat-loving and included some
tropical elements. Its composition also included characteristic forest
inhabitants (for example, Pliopetaurista), which may imply more moist
conditions. Terrestrial mollusk faunas also point to warm climatic
conditions: thermophilous species of the forest-steppe zone were present,
along with several subtropical taxa (Striatura, Hawaia, and five species
of Gastropoda). Based on these data, the lower Kimmerian can be regarded
as the warmest part of the Pliocene.<P>

At the beginning of the middle Pliocene steppe landscapes dominated by
Chenopodiaceae were prevalent in the southeastern Russian Plain.  During
late Kushum time, steppe vegetation was partly replaced by forest-steppe
and forest.  Along with coniferous forests, broad-leaved vegetation was
widespread, with different species of Ulmus, Celtis, Juglans, Pterocarya,
Liquidambar and others.  The climate remained warm (mean January
temperature = ~ 1° C, July temperature = ~ 20° C) and became more humid.
Farther to the south on coast of the Caspian Sea, shells of the heat-
loving mollusks Unio and Valvata were found in the layers of the same age,
confirming the interpretation of a warm middle Pliocene.<P>

The Caspian Sea regressed to near its modern level in the beginning of the
late Pliocene (a continuation of the lowering of sea level that began in
Kimmerian time), and a river pattern similar to that of today was
established. A reduction of forest cover took place during the Kujalnik
stage in the northern Black Sea region, and forest-steppe vegetation was
replaced by steppe. The flora was very similar to that of today, and only
the presence of rare pollen grains of exotic taxa allow us to consider
these layers to be of Pliocene age.  Clearly the climate became drier and
cooler during the late Pliocene.<P>

During the early Akchagylian substage (corresponding to the Kujalnik) in
the Don river basin, steppe vegetation existed with patches of riparian
forests. The middle Akchagylian is marked with cooling which is reflected
in a spread of Betula (arboreal pollen spectra are dominated by Betula in
these deposits), and micromammal faunal assemblages confirm the existence
of dry open landscapes. A new stage of forest expansion indicates that
warming took place later in the middle Akchagylian. More humid conditions
allowed broad-leaved trees such as Quercus and Tilia to grow in this
region, and thermophilous mollusks, including Striatura, Hawaia,
Parmacella and others, were identified in deposits of this age.<P>

Profound cooling occurred in late Akchagylian time, when exotic
thermophilic taxa died out. The northern part of Don River basin was
occupied by forest-steppe vegetation, while the southern part had steppe
vegetation. These interpretations from pollen data are confirmed by fauna
assemblage that contain the steppe taxa Equus stenonis, Paracamelus and
Struthio. The final part of late Pliocene on the Don Plain is
characterized by temperate climate and forest-steppe vegetation.<P>

On the southeastern Russian Plain, late Pliocene vegetation was dominated
by steppe and forest-steppe. Coniferous trees were more common than broad-
leaved ones in the forests, and the flora included a small number of
subtropical elements than in Kushum time. The paleobotanical data suggest
that mean January temperature was about 0°C, and that of July was about
20°C. The ostracode assemblages include paleoarctic taxa such as Candona
and Iliocypris, indicating cooler water conditions than occurred earlier
in the Pliocene.<P>

The middle part of the Akchagylian was the warmest within the late
Pliocene; vegetation was dominated by mixed coniferous-broadleaved
forests, and heat-loving taxa of mollusks were abundant in the Caspian
Sea.  Mean January temperature was about 2°C, that of July 21°C.<P>

In the late Akchagylian a new cooling took place, marked by the spread of
coniferous forests of Pinus, Picea and Tsuga. The flora became more
depauperate than earlier, and increasing aridity is interpreted from a
spread of the steppe vegetation at the end of Akchagylian time. During the
final part of the Pliocene (the Apsheronian stage) further cooling and
drying occurred on the southeastern Russian Plain, and steppe vegetation
became dominated by Artemisia and Chenopodiaceae associations.<P>

In general, for any stage within the Pliocene the same pattern can be
observed: greater continentality and aridity in the east than in the west.
Overall, since the time of maximum warmth during the middle Pliocene
Kimmerian stage a similar pattern toward greater continentality and
aridity through time can be seen in any given subregion of the southern
Russian Plain. The climatic oscillations on the background of this general
trend can be seen more clearly by time sequence of landscape change in the
southeastern Russian Plain. The middle Pliocene (early Kimmerian) time can
be regarded as the climatic optimum of the Pliocene in the southern
Russian Plain.<P>

For the warm global climates of the Pliocene, the highest amplitude
climatic fluctuations were expressed in the eastern, more continental,
part of the southern Russian Plain.  In contrast, under the cold global
climates of the late Quaternary, climatic fluctuations were greater in
western Europe than in the east.
