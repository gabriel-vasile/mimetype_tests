the

barometer seems to swing from liberal to conservative. People are faced

use acceptable? And if so, for who? Is abortion permitted? Was there
contraception? Who is an acceptable marriage partner for who? When the

Although there

during

exhibited a
considerable amount of temperance. The women rarely drank wine, at

knowledge of
alcohol
before contact with Europeans. In what is now Arizona, both the Pima
(Akimel
O&#8217;odham) and Papago (Tohono O&#8217;odham) people did make versions of wine
out of
saguaro cactus. The alcohol content was between three and four percent,
much
lower than the wine of grapes drunk in Europe (Mancall 1995:132). It
had
significant nutritional value and large amounts had to be drunk to
achieve
intoxication. The beverage provided a good source of comparably safe
liquid
where water was not easy to find. The Pima and Papago peoples made
large
quantities of saguaro wine in July, after the harvest of the first
crops. They
would have a saguaro ceremony and all of the adults would drink large
amounts
of the wine. The belief was that just as they were saturating their
bodies with
the wine the earth would be saturated with rain. North of the Rio
Grande, use
of alcohol outside of ceremony was infrequent.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>Thus &#8220;drinking etiquette&#8221; was not developed among the
native peoples

of Alcohol in New Spain was common among both the Spanish settlers and
the
natives. The Franciscans introduced to California what was known as the
mission
grape in 1767, and small quantities of surplus wine were given to
travelers
starting in the early 1800's (Viola and Margolis 1991:60-61).<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Pima and Papago drinking patterns changed
greatly after the onset of new diseases and much warfare between .
Indians who
had previously restricted drinking to ceremonious occasions changed
their
patterns. The arrival of the Europeans allowed distilled beverages to
be
introduced into their diets. To this day tribes continue to incorporate
alcohol
into their<span style="">&nbsp; </span>religious ceremonies (Mancall
1995:132-133). However, during colonial times taverns and inns turned
drinking
alcohol into a social pastime. Brandy and wine imported from Spain and
Mexico
made drinking alcohol less of a strictly religious act among the
Indians.
Although Spanish bureaucrats and clergy did not approve of Indians
increased
alcohol consumption, not all colonists condemned drinking among the
natives.
One observer noted when Indians &#8220; assemble at their festivals, the
whole tribe
bring eatables, and they sing and dance till they get drunk and are
tired and
so they freely pass a happy time&#8221; (Mancall 1995: 132-133). When Padre
Catala
and Padre Viader of mission Santa Clara were asked in 1814 of the
natives on
the mission, &#8220;What kind of fermented drinks do they use? Are they
useful or
harmful to them? Explain also the ingredients and types of these
drinks.&#8221; They
replied, &#8220;They have no fermented drink and their only beverage is
water. The
same is true at all other missions except at Carmel where they have
learned to
drink wine, whiskey and mescal. They get tipsy, even intoxicated by
chewing
tobacco and this is very harmful to their chests The missionaries at
Santa
Barbara replied, &#8220;These Indians have no fermented drinks whatever of
their own
but they hanker after ours wherefore we keep them securely hid&#8221; (Geiger
and
Clement 1976: 89).</big></font></big></p>

1800, crown officials tried to restrict the types and quantities of
alcohol
that were imported. There were difficulties with this from the onset.
In 1776, <i>Commisionado</i>
Morago at the Pueblo of San Jose received an order to put an end to
drunken
behavior in the town. In Santa Barbara <i>Alferez </i>Jose Joaquin
Maitorena
held a hearing regarding complaints of drinking, gambling and fighting

sentenced to 100 lashings and forced to work six years as a <i>presidario</i>

area
such as <i>Nicotiana attenuate</i> and <i>N. bigelovii </i>were
used. Tobacco
was used ceremoniously and may not have been considered an indulgence
as it was
in Spain. The dried leaves were smoked out of a tapering tube of
steatite, and
that usually had a mouthpiece of bird bone (Grant 1978). The Chumash
also
&#8220;chewed a confection of wild tobacco and lime, which when chewed,
strengthens
them as they say; but if they go to excess, it intoxicates them<span
 style="font-family: Symbol;"><span style="">&frac14;</span></span>&#8221;
(Englehardt 1932:18). The Ohlone hunters always chewed tobacco while
approaching the game as they thought that by altering their
consciousness, they
also made the prey &#8220;drunk and less wary&#8221;(Margolin 1978: 33-34). When an
Ohlone
woman is child-bearing, her husband must give up meat, salt and tobacco

believed
that the events in datura induced visions would come true (Kroeber
1908:65).
However not all shamans used datura. Kroeber writes, &#8220;It is said by the
Cahuilla that the amount of extract of the root that is drunk must be
judged by
a man experienced in its use, and that a number of deaths have resulted
from
taking excessive quantities&#8221; (Kroeber 1908:66).<span

rhythmic sounds, fasting, and drugs. Hallucinations were believed to

brought shamans to another world to find lost souls and bring them back
before
the person who lost them died or got ill.(Bean 1992: 75) The drugs were
in form
of plant roots, stems, leaves, flowers and seeds. Sometimes Mushrooms
containing psilocybine, which is an agent that causes auditory and
visual
hallucinations, were used. Flowering plants such as members of the
morning
glory family, legumes, mints were also believed to have visionary

Spain during the eighteenth century, the Bourbons passed the <i>Royal
Pragmatica</i> of 1716 which was applied to the colonies in 1718. In
regards to
marriage, this decree stated that &#8220;parental consent for youths under
the age of
twenty-five [be obtained] to marry, and it upheld the parent&#8217;s right to
oppose
their children&#8217;s choice of mate.&#8221; However, parental consent was not
required of
&#8220;Mulatos, Negros, Coyotes and similar races&#8221; in the Americas because of
the
difficulty of finding parents (Bouvier 2001: 113-114). The Spanish
Crown
encouraged inter-ethnic marriages on the frontier, like it had done in
New
Spain; soldiers who married converted natives were promised land and
other
incentives (ibid.: 114-115).</big></font></big></p>

Ohlone
people of the San Francisco Bay area, virginity before marriage was not
demanded or expected (Margolin 1978: 84). Marriage between two native
peoples
was very casual in comparison to Catholic marriage practices and laws.
According to the missionaries at San Miguel, in pre-mission times, if a
native
couple loved each other, they would be considered married. The
fianc&eacute; sometimes
would ask the consent of the parents and would have to give the bride&#8217;s
family
a quantity of beads as payment (Bouvier 2001: 112-113). Similar
accounts have
been documented by missionaries throughout California stating that
marriage
between natives was relaxed and hardly required matrimonial ceremonies

of the native peoples of California before contact practiced polygamy
(Hurtado
1999: 2). However, polygamy was usually restricted to leadership and
the
acquisition of wives was for practical, rather than purely sexual,
means. In
the San Francisco area, it was reported by H.D. Richardson, an early
California
pioneer, that the chiefs &#8220; &#8216;possessed eleven wives, the subchiefs nine,
and the
warriors two wives or as many more as they were able to care for&#8217; &#8221;
(Bouvier
2001: 111). He also wrote that this many wives was essential in times
of war
when the wives would care for and recover the wounded from the
battlefield.
However, not all tribes had as many as eleven wives; the coastal Miwok
chiefs
often had only two (ibid.: 111). </big></font></big></p>

marriage at will. Both men and women were able to divorce one another
(ibid.:
112). Within the Chumash culture of Southern California women initiated
sex and
ridiculed, even divorced, inadequate partners (Hurtado 1999: 4).
Adultery,
however, was usually not taken lightly. Among the Gabrieli<span

people, men could exchange their wives and the women had to submit.
However, it
was not permissible for women to engage in sexual relations outside

the pre-contact era, the native people had punishments for
inappropriate
behavior. If a woman among the Gabrieli<span
 style="font-family: Symbol;"><span style="">_</span></span>o people of
Southern
California was caught engaging in sexual relations outside her
marriage, her
husband could kill her or injure her. However, such harsh punishment
was not
usually acted out; the husband usually &#8220; &#8216;informed the wife&#8217;s paramour
[or
lover] that <i>he was at liberty to keep her</i>&#8217; &#8221; and then the
wronged
husband took the lover&#8217;s wife instead (Bouvier 2001: 112). While the
Gabrieli<span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span style="">_</span></span>os
were normally content to give away the adulterous wife and take the
lover&#8217;s
wife in her place, the Chumash people actually executed women for
adultery.
According to Fernando Librado Kitsepawit, a Chumash Indian born in
1804, &#8220; &#8216;if
a woman was unfaithful, she was sentenced to be shot three times with
arrows by
an executioner. On such occasions they would seat the woman down before
the
people and execute her&#8217; &#8221; (ibid.: 113). Death was also the punishment
for
adulterous women within the Nisenan, Konkow, and Maidu tribes (Hurtado
1999:
88). Other inappropriate behavior included rape which was common during
warfare. Male natives of one group would often commit sexual assaults
on women
of their enemy tribes (Williams 2000 4[6:2]: 14).</big></font></big></p>

was an institutionalized system within many native cultures. The
priests and the
soldiers on the missions tried to purge the natives of homosexuality.
One

early days
of Mission Santa Clara. The individual was &#8220;captured and stripped
naked. For
three days the individual was forced to sweep the guardhouse and do

Another

 size="+1"><big>We
have made our best attempt to create a complete illustration of social
mores
and indulgences during the time of Anza for both the indigenous people
and
the colonists of California. However it is only an attempt. There are
gaps that
will inevitably remain unfilled due to history&#8217;s inherent bias and
failure to
recognize all people as participants with relevant perspectives. When
examining
and reflecting on the preceding information, one must keep in mind who
have
been the recorders of history and what political or social agenda they
may have
had. We are all susceptible to look at those societies who live as &#8220;the
other&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>as morally inferior to our own.
But the pendulum always swings both ways. Europe brought the practice
of
prostitution to the New World, however there is no record of native
reaction to
such a practice. Did they look on at the white men in disgust? We may
never
know. However it is clear from the many accounts available that many of
the
missionaries viewed the natives as debauched and licentious peoples.
Should we
then take this as historical fact? Or perhaps it was another way to
justify
their classification as inferior humans. History is a picture painted
from one
perspective, we must keep in mind what picture the artist is begging us
to see. <b><o:p></o:p></b></big></font></big></p>
