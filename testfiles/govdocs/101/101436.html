<P>1. As an Officer of the United States and as Secretary of the Treasury,

and pursuant to the authority vested in me as such by the Constitution

personnel of the Treasury Department to assist in protecting officers and

employees of the United States, its property, its operations and its functions

wheresoever located from unauthorized and willful interference, injury,

harm, damage, carrying away, or destruction without regard to whether such

officers and employees, property, operations or functions are those of,

or are under the jurisdiction or within the possession or control of, the

Department of the Treasury.</P>



<P>2. Assistance shall be rendered under the authority contained in this

Order only when the following conditions are met:</P>



<UL>

<P>a. There exists an emergency in which:</P>



<UL>

<P>(1) officers or employees, property, operations or functions of the

United States are threatened; and</P>



<P>(2) adequate protection cannot be provided by duly authorized local,

state, or Federal law enforcement officers; and</P>

</UL>



<P>b. There is a proper request for such assistance which includes a statement

from the requesting official that offices, employees, property, operations

or functions of the United States are threatened and adequate protection

cannot be provided by duly authorized local, state or Federal law enforcement

officers, or, in the judgment of the senior law enforcement official of

the assisting Treasury agency present, the situation can be considered

an emergency and the circumstances require that such assistance, to be

effective, be rendered without awaiting such request.</P>
