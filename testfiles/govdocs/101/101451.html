C.  Eligible employees may elect to participate in an optional
retirement plan established by the community college district board.  The
eligible employee shall make the election in writing and file the election
with the Arizona state retirement system and the disbursing officer of the
employing institution.  The eligible employee shall make the election within
ninety days of the employee's effective date of employment or, if the
employee is a member of the Arizona state retirement system on the date the
optional retirement program becomes effective, within ninety days of the
effective date of the optional retirement program.  If an employee who is a
member of the Arizona state retirement system elects to participate in an
optional retirement program within ninety days of the employee's effective
date of employment or the effective date of the optional retirement program,
the Arizona state retirement system shall transfer the employee's
contributions to the Arizona state retirement system and interest as
determined by the board of the Arizona state retirement system to the optional retirement program within the later of ninety days after the
election or ninety days after receipt by the optional retirement program of
a favorable letter of determination issued by the United States internal
revenue service.  If an eligible employee fails to make an election as
provided in this subsection, the employee is deemed to have elected to
participate in the Arizona state retirement system.  The election to
participate in an optional retirement program is irrevocable and constitutes
a waiver of all benefits provided by the Arizona state retirement system.
All eligible employees who elect to participate in an optional retirement
program shall remain participants in the optional retirement  program during
the continuance of employment with the community college district.
<p align=justify>
<p align=justify>
<p align=justify>
D.  The community college district board shall make contributions from
public monies appropriated or any other monies available for this purpose on
behalf of each participant in the optional retirement program in an amount
equal to the employer contribution prescribed in title 38, chapter 5,
article 2.
<p align=justify>
<p align=justify>
<p align=justify>
E.  Subject to subsection G of this section, each community college
district board that establishes an optional retirement program shall
establish program provisions including:
<p align=justify>
<p align=justify>
<p align=justify>
1.  Categories of employees that are eligible to elect to participate
in the optional retirement program.
<p align=justify>
<p align=justify>
<p align=justify>
2.  The employee contribution rate.  This rate may be greater than the
employee contribution rate prescribed in title 38, chapter 5, article 2.
<p align=justify>
<p align=justify>
<p align=justify>
3.  A vesting period for employer contributions, if any.  All employee
contributions that are picked up by the employer are fully vested at all
times.
<p align=justify>
<p align=justify>
<p align=justify>
4.  Restrictions on benefits, except that the optional retirement
program shall not allow a participant to withdraw employer contributions
except as retirement income payable for life or to provide for loans on
retirement income.
<p align=justify>
<p align=justify>
<p align=justify>
F.  A community college district board may elect to provide health or
long-term disability coverage to optional retirement program participants
under separate benefit plans.  The community college district board may
allocate a portion of its employer contribution that would otherwise be made
to the optional retirement program under subsection D of this section to the
separate benefit plans to provide health or long-term disability coverage.

<ADDED>
A COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT BOARD MAY SATISFY THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS SECTION BY ENTERING INTO AN INTERGOVERNMENTAL AGREEMENT WITH ANOTHER
COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT BOARD TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT'S OPTIONAL RETIREMENT PROGRAM.
</ADDED>

  The administration shall include, without limitation, the design and implementation of the plan document
establishing the optional retirement program, compliance with the
qualification requirements prescribed in subsection B of this section and
such other duties that are not inconsistent with this section as may be
delegated to the administrator pursuant to the intergovernmental agreements
entered into among the community college district boards.
<p align=justify>
<p align=justify>
<p align=justify>
H.  Although designated as employee contributions, all employee
contributions made to an optional retirement program shall be picked up and
paid by the community college district in lieu of contributions by the
employee.  The contributions picked up by a community college district may
be made through a reduction in the employees' salary or  an offset against
future salary increases, or a combination of both.  The employees
participating in the optional retirement program do not have the option of
choosing to receive the contributed amounts directly instead of the community
college district paying the amounts to the optional retirement program.  It
is intended that all employee contributions that are picked up by the
community college district as provided in this subsection shall be treated
as employer contributions under section 414(h) of the internal revenue code
and shall be excluded from the employees' gross income for federal and state
income tax purposes and are includable in the gross income of the employees
or their beneficiaries only in the taxable year in which they are
distributed.
<p align=justify>
<p align=justify>
<p align=justify>
I.  A community college district board shall not be liable to any
employee, retiree or other person for any reason relating to the community
college district board's provision of or failure to provide for an optional
retirement program or health or long-term disability coverage.

A.  The board shall establish group health and accident coverage for
eligible retired and disabled members and their dependents.  Eligible retired
and disabled members are those members who are receiving retirement benefits
from ASRS or long-term disability benefits pursuant to section 38-651.03 or
article 2.1 of this chapter and who are not eligible to obtain health and
accident insurance through their former employer.  If an insured retired or
disabled member dies before the insured member's dependent beneficiary or an
insured surviving dependent, the dependent beneficiary or insured surviving
dependent is entitled to coverage at group rates if the dependent beneficiary
or surviving dependent elects to continue in the coverage within six months
of the insured member's death and the dependent beneficiary or surviving
dependent agrees to pay the cost of the premium for group health and accident insurance.  On notification of the insured member's death, the board shall
immediately notify a dependent beneficiary or an insured surviving dependent
of the provisions of this section.
