        Inc., or Progressive Products, Inc., that they have
        engaged and are likely to engage in acts and practices
        that violate Section 5(a) of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C.
        45(a). </p>

        judicial review or otherwise challenge the validity of

        U.S.C. 2412. </p>
        <p>9. The Commission's agreement to this Order is
        expressly premised upon the truthfulness, accuracy, and

        <p align="center"><strong>Redress </strong></p>
        <p>A. Defendant Janus forever waives, releases,
        discharges, and disclaims all right, title, and interest
        in (1) all assets transferred to the Receivership estate;
        and (2) all assets now in the possession of or subject to
        the control of the Receiver, including without limitation
        the balance of account number 01102028 at the
        Cosmopolitan Bank in Chicago, Illinois. None of the
        assets described in this subparagraph shall be returned
        to the defendants, their respective successors, heirs, or
        assigns. </p>
        <p>B. Defendant Janus hereby transfers to the Receiver
        all of his right, title, and interest in all cash and
        other property now in the possession of the Receiver, and
        all property of the receivership defendants. </p>
        <p>C. Defendant Janus forever waives, releases, and
        discharges all claims that he has in any capacity against
        the Receivership defendants and all claims he has in any
        capacity against the Receiver or his agents for conduct
        undertaken through the date of entry of this Order. </p>
        <p>D. The Commission agrees to accept Defendant Janus'
        undertakings required by this Order, including the asset
        transfer described above in paragraph V(B), in full
        settlement of its claim for monetary relief against
        Defendant Janus arising from the transactions that are
        the subject of the Commission's Complaint, except as
        otherwise provided in paragraph VI. below. </p>
        <p>E. All of the Defendants' assets remaining in the
        Receiver's possession shall be used, after payment of the
        Receiver's fees and other expenses approved by this
        Court, for distribution to creditors of Defendant
        Progressive Products, Inc., if any. The Receiver shall
        submit to the Court for consideration, on notice to and
        after consultation with Plaintiff Federal Trade
        Commission, a plan to distribute the Receivership assets
        (the &quot;distribution plan&quot;). The distribution
        plan shall to the extent practicable address, among other
        things, the claims of (1) consumers who purchased any
        alcohol reducing agents from any of the named defendants
        in this matter, whether the consumers received the
        product or not; or (2) consumers who purchased from any
        of the named defendants in this matter a business venture
        involving the sale of an alcohol reducing agent. <em>Provided</em>,
        that Plaintiff Federal Trade Commission may propose to
        this Court alternative terms for the distribution plan in
        the event the Receiver and the Plaintiff do not agree
        after consultation. </p>
        <p>F. Any funds that are not distributed to consumers in
        the form of redress, distributed to trade creditors, or
        used to pay administrative costs associated with
        Receivership estate shall be paid over to the United
        States Treasury as an equitable disgorgement remedy. <em>Provided
        further</em>, that if the Receivership assets are
        insufficient to justify a distribution plan for consumer
        redress, the Federal Trade Commission or the Receiver may
        request Court approval to pay some or all of the
        available monies to the United States Treasury as an
        equitable disgorgement remedy. <em>Provided further</em>,
        that in the event a consumer redress plan is created
        pursuant to court order with respect to claims against
        any other defendant in this case, the other consumer
        redress plans may be combined or otherwise jointly
        administered, pursuant to further court order, for
        purposes of administration and distribution. The
        Commission or the Receiver may move for such
        consolidation. <em>Provided further</em>, that none of
        the assets turned over to the Receiver pursuant to this
        Order shall be returned to the Defendants. </p>
        <p>G. Consumers and other creditors shall be required to
        release and discharge the settling Receivership Defendant
        Progressive Products, Inc., only from all claims that
        arise from the business of the Receivership Defendants as
        a condition of receiving payment from the Receivership
        estate. </p>
        <p>H. The Defendants shall have no right to object to any
        aspect of the distribution plan(s) submitted by the
        Receiver and/or the Plaintiff Federal Trade Commission
        pursuant to this Order. The Defendants also shall have no
        right to object to the disposition of the assets
        transferred pursuant to paragraph V(B). </p>
        <p>I. The Defendants and the Receiver shall provide full
        and complete cooperation to the Commission and its agents
        in collecting information relevant to the preparation of
        the distribution plan described in paragraph V(E). </p>
        <p>J. This Stipulated Final Judgment and Order is not
        intended as full compensation for the Commission's claims
        as described in the Commission's complaint. This Order is
        intended to release only Defendants Janus and Progressive
        Products, Inc. The Commission expressly reserves the
        right to seek relief under any cause of action or any
        other claim of whatever kind or nature it may have or
        hereafter have against any person or persons other than
        Defendants Janus and Progressive Products, Inc. arising
        out of the conduct described in the Commission's
        complaint. </p>
        <p>K. The Commission expressly reserves its right to
        object in this action to assertions by any party of
        comparative fault principles, apportionment of damages,
        or claims for contribution and indemnity among Defendants
        Janus and Progressive Products, Inc., and the
        non-settling defendants in this action. This Stipulated
        Final Judgment and Order is not intended to permit any
        non-settling defendant to assert any claim for
        contribution, indemnity, or apportionment of damages
        where any such claim would not otherwise be allowed by
        applicable law. </p>
        <p>L. If the Commission is successful in the prosecution
        of its claims against any other defendant that is not a
        party to this Agreement, or if any other defendant that
        is not a party to this Agreement is successful in
        bringing any claim it may have against Defendants Janus
        or Progressive Products, Inc., for liability to it for
        any amount sought by the Commission or for contribution
        or indemnity for losses attributable to monetary relief
        paid to the Commission by any defendant not a party to
        this Agreement, based on any assignment of responsibility
        to each, then the Commission hereby releases and
        discharges that portion, fraction, or percentage of its
        total claims and monetary relief that may be allocated to
        Defendants Janus and Progressive Products, Inc. </p>
        <p>M. It is the intention of the Commission and
        Defendants to extinguish any potential liability on the
        part of Defendants Janus and Progressive Products, Inc.
        for contribution or indemnity which might be claimed
        against them by any non-settling defendant charged with
        common liability with Defendants Janus and Progressive
        Products, Inc. to the Commission for such claims. </p>
