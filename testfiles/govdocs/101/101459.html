BACKGROUND<br><br>                    Because these waters  have been so  thoroughly charted,<br><br>          we  merely sketch the background  insofar as is  necessary to set<br><br>          this appeal and the underlying litigation into perspective.<br><br>                                          A<br>                                          A<br><br>                    Plaintiff-appellant   Dedham-Westwood   Water  District<br><br>          (which, together  with its predecessor in  interest, Dedham Water<br><br>          Company,  we shall call "Dedham") is  a regulated public utility.<br><br>          It supplies drinking water  to some 40,000 persons who  reside in<br><br>          the  Massachusetts towns of Dedham  and Westwood.   One source of<br><br>          this water is the White Lodge Well Field.  The well field lies in<br><br>          an industrial park  along the  west bank of  the Neponset  River.<br><br>          Defendant-appellee  Cumberland  Farms Dairy,  Inc. ("Cumberland")<br><br>          operates a truck maintenance facility on the river's east bank.<br><br>                    In March  1979, Dedham  discovered that two  wells were<br><br>          contaminated with volatile organic  chemicals (VOCs).  It removed<br><br>          the wells from service, contacted the Massachusetts Department of<br><br>          Environmental  Quality  Engineering  (DEQE),  sought  alternative<br><br>          water  supplies, and  began  a  somewhat haphazard  investigation<br><br>          aimed  at   fixing  responsibility  for  the   pollution.    This<br><br>          investigation included a series of surface-water tests.<br><br><br><br><br>                                          2<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>                    In  June 1979,  Dedham began  to pump  the contaminated<br><br>          wells to  waste.  Shortly  thereafter, it hired  two consultants,<br><br>          Calgon  Corporation  and  Metcalf  & Eddy,  to  assess  treatment<br><br>          alternatives.  In early 1980, Dedham's governing board budgeted a<br><br>          sum of  money to  pay Metcalf  & Eddy  for designing  a two-stage<br><br>          treatment  plant that would deal with  both the VOC problem and a<br><br>          separate  water-quality issue.   In  July 1981,  Dedham submitted<br><br>          plans for the treatment plant to DEQE.  Before year's end, Dedham<br><br>          publicly announced  that it  would build  the treatment  plant at<br><br>          White Lodge.  <br><br>                    A  few  months prior  to  this  announcement, a  Dedham<br><br>          employee  discovered  VOCs  in  a  drainage  ditch  running  from<br><br>          Cumberland's property.   Dedham promptly hired  Geraghty & Miller<br><br>          ("G  & M"), a  firm specializing in  hydrogeology, to investigate<br><br>          the  source of  the  contamination  and  determine  the  zone  of<br><br>          capture.  In  January 1982, a  drawdown test conducted  by G &  M<br><br>          established that the Neponset River was not a barrier to the flow<br><br>          of contaminants; theoretically, contaminants could flow under the<br><br>          river and  into the well  field.   G & M  proceeded to  sink test<br><br>          wells in  and around the White Lodge field.   In July of 1982, it<br><br>          identified Cumberland  as a likely  source of pollutants.   Three<br><br>          months later, G & M reported that, in its opinion, Cumberland was<br><br>          the major cause of the White Lodge contamination.<br><br>                    The  G &  M report  heralded the  start of  the instant<br><br>          litigation.  Invoking  the Comprehensive Environmental  Response,<br><br>          Compensation,  and Liability Act  of 1980 (CERCLA),  42 U.S.C.   <br><br><br>                                          3<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          9601-9675 (1988),  and its  state-law counterpart, Mass.  Gen. L.<br><br>          Ch.  21E (1990 & Supp.  1991), Dedham sued  Cumberland in federal<br><br>          district  court.  It asserted claims  for response costs incurred<br><br>          as  a result of actual  and threatened contamination  at the well<br><br>          field.  <br><br>                    As the suit plodded toward trial, the planned treatment<br><br>          plant  was  slowed  by zoning  questions,  neighbors' objections,<br><br>          dissatisfaction on DEQE's part, and a gaggle of other roadblocks.<br><br>          After appellant  redesigned the  plant to feature  lower aerating<br><br>          towers and better  emission controls, these problems  dissipated.<br><br>          DEQE  granted a  permit.   Construction  began  in 1985  and  the<br><br>          treatment plant went on line in early 1987.<br><br>                    Appellant's  court  case progressed  more deliberately.<br><br>          It took four full years  to overcome a jurisdictional  obstacle.1<br><br>          When  the case  was  finally tried,  Dedham  did not  succeed  in<br><br>          proving that Cumberland was the source of the contamination.  The<br><br>          district court  (Tauro, J.)  entered judgment for  the defendant.<br><br>          Dedham  Water Co. v. Cumberland  Farms Dairy, Inc.,  689 F.

We  reversed,  holding that  the<br>          district court  possessed subject matter jurisdiction.   805 F.2d<br>          1074 (1st Cir. 1986).<br><br>                                          4<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          discovered   contamination,  may   nevertheless  have   posed  an<br><br>          actionable  threat  of  future  contamination,  to  which  Dedham<br><br>          responded in  an objectively reasonable  (if costly) manner.   We<br><br>          directed the district court to revisit this aspect of the matter.<br><br>          Dedham Water Co. v.

We also<br>                              ______________________       ___<br><br>          decided that a new trier should preside.  See In  re Dedham Water<br>                                                    ___ ___________________<br><br>          Co., 901 F.2d 3,  4-5 (1st Cir. 1990) (per  curiam) (interpreting<br>          ___<br><br>          D.

In the first trial, appellant was<br><br>          unable to  "prove[] that the contaminants  released by Cumberland<br><br>          Farms had migrated to the [White Lodge] wells."  EMA, 889 F.2d at<br>                                                           ___<br><br>          1149.   Dedham did not  challenge this ruling on  appeal.  Hence,<br><br>          the issue could not be resurrected during the second trial.  From<br><br>          that point forward, it had to  be taken as gospel that Cumberland<br><br>          "was not  liable for the  expenses incurred  by Dedham .  . .  in<br><br>          investigating  the  cause  of  the  pollution  to  its wells  and<br><br>          rectifying  [that pollution]."

But, polluting substances that stopped<br><br>          short  of the well field's boundary could conceivably have caused<br><br>          the appellant to incur expenses compensable under CERCLA.  Id. at<br>                                                                     ___<br><br>          1151-54, 1157-58.  If,  and to the extent that,  Cumberland posed<br><br>          such a threat,  and Dedham acted in  response thereto, Cumberland<br><br>          might be held liable.  Since the district court had neglected  to<br><br>          make a finding on this point, further proceedings were required.<br><br>                    The second  trial was perforce limited  to a resolution<br><br>          of this issue  and, if  the district court  found in  appellant's<br><br>          favor, an assessment  of damages.  The case was  redrawn to Judge<br><br>          Skinner.   After taking additional testimony,  he determined that<br><br>          appellant  had not  incurred any  response costs  as a  result of<br><br>          releases, or  the threat  of releases, attributable  to appellee.<br><br>          Dedham Water Co. v.

THE MISTAKE-OF-LAW THESIS<br><br>                    In an effort to put some flesh on the bare bones of its<br><br>          mistake-of-law thesis,  appellant develops two criticisms  of the<br><br>          judgment below.  One criticism  is relatively general; the  other<br><br>          is relatively specific.   The  gist of the  broader criticism  is<br><br>          that  the  district  court  erroneously  factored   a  subjective<br><br>          component  into  the calculus  of  decision  by considering  what<br><br><br>                                          8<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          Dedham actually knew  (or believed) about  a threat of  potential<br><br>          harm  and when Dedham actually acquired such knowledge.  The more<br><br>          particularized criticism suggests  that, regardless of whether  a<br><br>          subjective component  could  properly be  considered,  the  trial<br><br>          court's  conception of the  legal standard was  faulty because it<br><br>          slavishly  embraced a temporal standard, requiring that appellant<br><br>          prove it had  identified Cumberland as  the source of  threatened<br><br>          releases  before it  incurred the  costs  for which  recovery was<br><br>          sought.  <br><br>                    We examine these  contentions seriatim.

There is a  gaping hole in the fabric of this<br><br>          construct.<br><br>                    Appellant's theory at the second trial, as expressed in<br><br>          its  pleadings,   evidence,  and  trial  memoranda,  hinged  upon<br><br>          precisely the mixed subjective/objective approach it now reviles.<br><br>          Nothing  could  make this  point clearer  than  a reading  of the<br><br>          closing argument  given by Dedham's counsel in the district court<br><br>             a summation that  focused squarely on "what  did they know and<br><br>          when  did they know it?"

Its claim  of legal error dissolves upon  analysis of<br><br>          the  decision below and the  record upon which  that decision was<br><br>          based.  The  district  court  did  not require  appellant,  as  a<br><br>          condition  precedent to  recovery, to  have identified  the party<br><br>          responsible  for the  threat before  beginning to  incur response<br><br>          costs.   Instead, the court's focus was exactly where it belonged<br><br>            not on whether the chicken preceded the egg, or vice versa, but<br><br>          on whether Cumberland somehow,  or in some way, caused  Dedham to<br><br>          incur response costs.4   This  was precisely the  task we set  in<br>                              <br>          ____________________<br><br>               3We  have considered,  and reject  out of  hand, appellant's<br>          claim that, in addition to other enumerated response costs, it is<br>          entitled  to  certain  sums  as  "preliminary  response   costs."<br>          Appellant's Brief  at 45.   It would  serve no useful  purpose to<br>          recount  the manifold flaws that bedevil this claim.  For present<br>          purposes, it suffices to say that, without an affirmative finding<br>          of  fact causally  connecting these  costs to  a threat  posed by<br>          appellee, the claim is necessarily stillborn.<br><br>               4Appellant   also   contends  that   the   district  court's<br>          preoccupation with the chronology of events necessarily betokened<br>          an  infelicitous view  of  the law.    This contention  is  sheer<br>          persiflage.  Appellant's  initial response  was clearly  prompted<br>          by, and addressed to, its discovery of actual contamination.  The<br>          court's  point  in  considering  the  chronological  sequence  of<br>          relevant  events was to show  that no substantive  changes in the<br>          response  paradigm were made or considered even after a threat of<br>          future  releases could  reasonably have  been apprehended.   This<br>          tended to show that appellant's responses were, in their  initial<br>          formulation and ultimate enactment,  responses to the actual, not<br>          threatened, contamination.

It neither  demonstrates an error  of law (as<br><br>          opposed to a disagreement  over the facts) nor raises  a question<br><br>          of jurisprudence  sufficient to  call the legal  underpinnings of<br><br>          the court's  factbound findings  into legitimate question.

Appellant  urges us  to answer this  question in  the<br><br>          affirmative, asserting that the court erred grievously in certain<br><br>          key respects.  We are unconvinced.<br><br>                                          A<br>                                          A<br><br>                    On the merits, appellant's foray implicates the core of<br><br>          the district court's  decision.  The  court found that  appellant<br><br>          only  became aware that  Cumberland may have  released VOCs (and,<br><br>          thus,  only became  aware of the  problem posed  by a  threat, as<br><br>          contrasted to the problem posed by actual contamination) in 1981.<br><br>          Second Trial  Op., 770 F. Supp. at 42.  In consequence, the court<br>          _________________<br><br>          found  that appellant could not have begun responding to a threat<br><br>          before  that time     well after  the  treatment plant  had  been<br><br>          designed  and appellant's  overall  response  paradigm  had  been<br><br>          formulated.   Hence, appellant did  not incur any  costs to guard<br><br>          against  threats of future harm.   We believe  these findings are<br><br>          supportable. <br><br>                    The district court's characterization of the big-ticket<br><br>          item      the  treatment  plant      as  a   response  to  actual<br><br>          contamination, rather than  to threats, is  completely plausible.<br><br>          That this expenditure, and  appellant's other responses, were not<br><br>          undertaken  to  deal with  threats  is  strikingly apparent  from<br><br>          appellant's actions   or, more appropriately put,  its inaction  <br><br>          in and after 1982,  when it incorrectly identified Cumberland  as<br><br>          the  chief  culprit in  respect  to  the existing  contamination.<br><br>          Despite  the  identification  and  the  fact  that   Cumberland's<br><br><br>                                          16<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          facility  remained  in  operation,   Dedham  changed  nothing  of<br><br>          substance in its response  paradigm.  To cite but a few examples,<br><br>          there  was no evidence that the new information was considered in<br><br>          making the final design decisions for the treatment plant or that<br><br>          the plant  design was altered in  any material way.5   See Second<br>                                                                 ___ ______<br><br>          Trial Op., 770  F.

(1) The record strongly suggests that<br><br>          G &  M's tests and reports,  the earliest of which  took place in<br><br>          1982,  provided the  first  credible basis  for recognizing  that<br>                              <br>          ____________________<br><br>               5The record  demonstrates  beyond  cavil  that  the  changes<br>          actually  made in  the  design  of  the  treatment  plant,  e.g.,<br>          lowering the  height of  the aerating  towers and  providing more<br>          sophisticated emission  controls,  were effectuated  in order  to<br>          palliate  abutters'  objections  and accommodate  DEQE  requests.<br>          Those modifications  had no  relation whatever to  the perception<br>          that Cumberland posed an environmental threat.<br><br>                                          17<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          Cumberland-spawned contaminants  could pose  a threat  to Dedham.<br><br>          (2) Insofar as the  record reveals, Dedham never acted  to follow<br><br>          up  its  consultants' recommendations  for additional  tests that<br><br>          would  have   served,  among   other  things,  to   determine  an<br><br>          appropriate  response  to  threatened  releases   and  threatened<br><br>          contamination.   (3) The district court's  subsidiary findings in<br><br>          connection  with the issue of causation, such as its finding that<br><br>          appellant's  decision to build  the treatment plant  was merely a<br><br>          response to the actual contamination of its well field and not in<br><br>          any way a  response to a threat of events yet to come, were based<br><br>          largely  upon   assessments   of  witness   credibility.     Such<br><br>          assessments deserve substantial respect.  See Anthony v.

Appellant's  tale has  three  foci.    We consider  them<br><br><br>                                          18<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          sequentially.<br><br>                                          1.<br>                                          1.<br>                                          __<br><br>                    Appellant places great  weight on surface-water testing<br><br>          done in  1979.    However, the  evidence  reflects  a  legitimate<br><br>          question about  whether the  testing was conducted  in sufficient<br><br>          proximity  to Cumberland's  property to  alert appellant  at that<br><br>          early  date  to  the  possibility  of  a  threat  emanating  from<br><br>          Cumberland's facility (or, indeed,  the possibility of any threat<br><br>          at all,  wheresoever originating).  Moreover,  the district court<br><br>          received evidence, both  testimonial and documentary,  indicating<br><br>          that, even after conducting  the 1979 tests, appellant complained<br><br>          to DEQE about the  agency's failure to  locate the source of  the<br><br>          contamination.  In these,  and other, ways, the record   supports<br><br>          conflicting  inferences  about  (a) when  appellant  first became<br><br>          threat-conscious  and (b)  when its  suspicions first  focused on<br><br>          Cumberland.<br><br>                    Appellant asserts that any  amphiboly in the record was<br><br>          clarified by the testimony of its witnesses, George Johnstone and<br><br>          Gregory  Grimes.      Johnstone,  a  member  of  Dedham's  senior<br><br>          management team,  testified as to  Dedham's intent.   Contrary to<br><br>          appellant's importunings, we do not believe that the  trial court<br><br>          was  compelled to  accept Johnstone's  self-interested testimony.<br><br>          See  Anthony,  952 F.2d  at  606  ("what  an actor  says  is  not<br>          ___  _______<br><br>          conclusive  on  a   state-of-mind  issue").    Grimes,   Dedham's<br><br>          production superintendent, testified that he found  sixteen parts<br><br>          per  billion  of 1,  1, 1     trichloroethane in  a surface-water<br><br><br>                                          19<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          sample  taken   in  1979  from  a  stream   some  distance  below<br><br>          Cumberland's property.   Leaving to  one side the  fact that  the<br><br>          sample  was taken  several  hundred feet  away from  Cumberland's<br><br>          property,  neither Grimes  nor any  other witness  testified that<br><br>          this  discovery  led Dedham  to believe,  in  1979 or  1980, that<br><br>          contaminants  had been  released  in the  course of  Cumberland's<br><br>          operations.<br><br>                    We  will  not churn  the  waters.    When the  evidence<br><br>          supports conflicting inferences, the district court's choice from<br><br>          among the several  inferences cannot be  clearly erroneous.

Secretary of the  Navy, 853 F.2d 1016,  1020 (1st Cir.  1988).<br>             ______________________<br><br>          This is such a case.<br><br>                                          2.<br>                                          2.<br>                                          __<br><br>                    The  next arrow  in  appellant's quiver  consists of  a<br><br>          stipulation  entered prior to  the first trial.   Appellant reads<br><br>          this stipulation  as containing  an admission by  Cumberland that<br><br>          appellant's testing  of runoff from Cumberland's  land showed the<br><br>          presence of VOCs in 1979 or thereabouts.  The fly in the ointment<br><br>          is  that the  district  court did  not accept  either appellant's<br><br>          interpretation of the stipulation or the inference appellant drew<br><br>          therefrom.  We discern no error. <br><br>                    It is  apodictic that a stipulation should be read with<br><br>          an  eye toward effectuating  the parties'  manifested intentions.<br><br>          See  Washington  Hosp. v.  White, 889  F.2d  1294, 1299  (3d Cir.<br>          ___  _________________     _____<br><br><br>                                          20<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          1989); Wo Co.  v.

The stipulation  to which  appellant alludes,<br><br>          fairly read, represents no more than the parties' agreement about<br><br>          the provenance  and  results  of certain  chemical  tests.6    It<br><br>          requires  a   forced  reading  to   interpret  the  stipulation's<br><br>          descriptions of  the locations from  which the test  samples were<br><br>          taken as an  admission concerning  what Dedham knew  and when  it<br><br>          appreciated the implications of facts within its ken.<br><br>                    Because  the  stipulation  at  most  faintly  suggests,<br><br>          rather  than  compels, appellant's  interpretation,  the district<br><br>          court's  refusal to  accord it  decretory significance  cannot be<br><br>          faulted.   After  all, "ambiguous  provisions in  [a] stipulation<br><br>          must  be interpreted by the  factfinder, here the district court,<br><br>          as an initial matter."

There, Judge<br><br>          Bownes wrote:   "Based upon a  survey it made  of the surrounding<br><br>          surface waters,  Dedham Water believed [in  1979] that Cumberland<br><br>          Farms was the source of the contamination of White Lodge Wells #3<br><br>          and #4."   EMA, 889  F.2d at 1148.   Appellant asserts  that this<br>                     ___<br><br>          statement constitutes a  finding which the district court was not<br>                              <br>          ____________________<br><br>               6The  stipulation in  question, entitled "Stipulation  as to<br>          the  Admissibility of  Certain Test  Results," provided  that the<br>          chemical analyses  of water samples  taken from various  parts of<br>          Cumberland Farms' land, as well as from a variety of nearby wells<br>          and waterways, shall be admissible "in lieu of  other testimonial<br>          or  documentary evidence."   It  is  too cumbersome  to reproduce<br>          verbatim here.<br><br>                                          21<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          at liberty  to  ignore.   We  disagree.   The  statement    which<br><br>          appears  only  in  a  section   of  the  panel  opinion  entitled<br><br>          "BACKGROUND"    does not reflect  an adjudication of  fact by the<br><br>          EMA panel.7<br>          ___<br><br>                    It is elementary that the  "law of the case"  doctrine,<br><br>          upon  which appellant  relies, ordinarily  applies to  matters of<br><br>          law,  not to matters of evidence.   See, e.g., Gospel Army v. Los<br>                                              ___  ____  ___________    ___<br><br>          Angeles, 331 U.S. 543, 548 (1947).   The quoted sentence does not<br>          _______<br><br>          fit in  that category.    Taken in  context, the  sentence was  a<br><br>          passing reference  to a  matter not then  in issue rather  than a<br><br>          considered response to a zoetic question of  law.  Even a cursory<br><br>          reading  of  the  panel's  opinion adequately  evinces  that  its<br><br>          recital of the  factual background was  undertaken simply to  set<br><br>          the stage for understanding the legal issues thereafter discussed<br><br>          and decided in the appeal.  <br><br>                    To be sure, in a very  select class of cases, the court<br><br>          of appeals may actually find  facts   and the facts so  found may<br><br>          come under the law-of-the-case umbrella.  See Heathcoat v. Potts,<br>                                                    ___ _________    _____<br><br>          905 F.2d 367, 370 (11th Cir. 1990).  The statement relied upon by<br><br>          appellant is not within the narrow confines of this select class.<br><br>          Absent  special   circumstances,  not  present   here,  appellate<br><br>          factfinding is  permissible only  when no  other resolution of  a<br><br>                              <br>          ____________________<br><br>               7Affirming findings of fact  is, of course, a staple  of the<br>          appellate function.  That aspect of our work is not implicated in<br>          this  situation.   Appellant  does  not suggest  that  the quoted<br>          sentence was drawn from, or based upon, any finding of  fact made<br>          by  Judge Tauro in the  first trial.   Furthermore, our review of<br>          the record confirms the absence of any such correlation.<br><br>                                          22<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          factbound question would, on the compiled record, be sustainable.<br><br>          See, e.g., LaRoche  v.

The question  of what Dedham  knew and  believed in<br><br>          1979 does not come close to meeting so rigorous a criterion.<br><br>                    Because the  factual issue to which  appellant gestures<br><br>          was merely  discussed, not  decided, in  the earlier  appeal, the<br><br>          district  court was  not bound  to accept  the proposition.

CONCLUSION <br>          III.  CONCLUSION<br><br>                    We  need go no further.  The  task which we set for the<br><br>          district   court  after  the   initial  trial  was  predominantly<br><br>          factbound.   See EMA, 889 F.2d  at 1154, 1157.   In the course of<br>                       ___ ___<br><br>          the proceedings  on remand, the court  competently performed that<br><br>          task.   In so  doing, it determined,  principally as  a matter of<br><br>          fact, that appellant had  not proven an indispensable element  of<br><br>          its remaining claim:  causation.    Mindful that a party alleging<br><br>          causation must carry the devoir of persuasion with respect to the<br><br>          issue, see,  e.g., Swift v. United States, 866 F.2d 507, 509 (1st<br>                 ___   ____  _____    _____________<br><br>          Cir. 1989),  and cognizant of the deferential  standard of review<br><br>          that Rule 52(a) imports, we cannot say that the court was clearly<br><br>                              <br>          ____________________<br><br>               8These  include  several  attacks  upon  the  lower  court's<br>          subsidiary findings.  Because none have merit, we will not recite<br>          book and verse.   We do, however, offer a  representative sample.<br>          Appellant castigates  the finding that it  hired G &  M to locate<br>          the source  of the contamination  with a view  toward litigation,<br>          not  for response  or  remediation purposes.    But, the  court's<br>          conclusion is adequately  grounded in  the record.   Indeed,  the<br>          minutes  of Dedham's October 28, 1981  board of directors meeting<br>          indicate that G & M's study was intended "to recover damages from<br>          the polluters, if they can be identified." <br><br>                                          24<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          mistaken  either  in  reaching  this  result  or  in  making  the<br><br>          subsidiary  findings  of  fact  upon which  the  result  rested.9<br><br>          Because  the  district  court's  findings  are <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          satisfactorily  supported by  the  evidence and  free from  legal<br><br>          error,  the  judgment below  is  velivolant.

The<br>          state-law  claims under  Mass. Gen.  L.
