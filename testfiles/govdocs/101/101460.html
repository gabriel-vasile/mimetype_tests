        <p align="center"><strong><u>TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER</u></strong>
        </p>
        <p>Plaintiff Federal Trade Commission
        (&quot;Commission&quot;), pursuant to Sections 13(b) and
        19 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (&quot;FTC
        Act&quot;), 15 U.S.C. §§ 53(b) and 57b, and the
        Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention
        Act, 15 U.S.C. § 6101 <em>et seq.</em>, filed a
        complaint to obtain preliminary and permanent injunctive
        relief, rescission or reformation of contracts,
        restitution, disgorgement, and other equitable relief,
        and applied <u>ex</u> <u>parte</u> for both a temporary
        restraining order with asset freeze and an order to show
        cause why a preliminary injunction should not be granted
        pursuant to Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil
        Procedure. The Court has considered the pleadings,
        declarations, exhibits, and memoranda filed in support of
        the Commission's application and makes the following
        findings of fact: </p>
        <p>1. This Court has jurisdiction of the subject matter
        of this case, and there is good cause to believe it will
        have jurisdiction over all parties.</p>
        <p>2. There is good cause to believe that defendant has
        engaged in and is likely to engage in practices that
        violate Section 5 of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C.
        §&nbsp;45(a), and the Telemarketing Sales Rule,
        16&nbsp;C.F.R. Part 310, and that the Commission is
        likely to prevail on the merits of this action.</p>
        <p>3. There is good cause to believe that immediate and
        irreparable harm will result from defendant's ongoing
        violations of the FTC Act, and the Telemarketing Sales
        Rule (&quot;TSR&quot;), and that immediate and
        irreparable damage to the Court's ability to grant
        effective final relief for consumers in the form of
        monetary redress will occur from the sale, transfer,
        assignment, or other disposition or concealment by
        defendant of its assets or records unless defendant is
        immediately restrained and enjoined by Order of this
        Court. There is, thus, good cause for issuing this Order
        without prior notice to the defendant of the Commission's
        application, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
        65(b).</p>
        <p>4. Weighing the equities and considering the
        Commission's likelihood of success in its causes of
        action, this Temporary Restraining Order is in the public
        interest.</p>
        <p>5. No security is required of any agency of the United
        States for the issuance of a restraining order. Fed. R.
        Civ. P. 65(c).</p>
