Sec.  1718.50  Definitions.

    Unless otherwise indicated, terms used in this subpart are defined 
as set forth in 7 CFR 1710.2.


Sec.  1718.51  Policy.

    (a) Adequate loan security must be provided for loans made or 
guaranteed by RUS. The loans are required to be secured by a first 
mortgage lien on most of the borrower's assets substantially in the form 
set forth in appendix A of this subpart. At the discretion of RUS, this 
model form of mortgage may be adapted to satisfy different legal 
requirements among the states and individual differences in lending 
circumstances, provided that such adaptations are consistent with the 
policies set forth in this subpart.
    (b) Some borrowers, such as certain public power districts, may not 
be able to provide security in the form of a first mortgage lien on 
their assets. In these cases RUS will consider accepting other forms of 
security, such as resolutions and pledges of revenues.
    (c) RUS may require supplemental and amending mortgages to protect 
its security, or in connection with additional loans.
    (d) RUS may also require such other security instruments (such as 
loan contracts, security agreements, financing statements, guarantees, 
and pledges) as it deems appropriate.
    (e) All distribution borrowers that receive a loan or loan guarantee 
from RUS on or after August 17, 1995 will be required to enter into a 
mortgage with RUS that meets the requirements of this subpart. The 
concurrence of any other lenders secured under the borrower's existing 
mortgage may be required before the borrower can enter into a new 
mortgage.


Sec.  1718.52  Existing mortgages.

    Nothing contained in this subpart amends, invalidates, terminates or 
rescinds any existing mortgage entered into between the borrower and RUS 
and any other mortgagees.


Sec.  1718.53  Rights of other mortgagees.

    Nothing contained in this subpart is intended to alter or affect any 
other mortgagee's rights under an existing mortgage.


Sec.  1718.54  Availability of model mortgage.

    Single copies of the model mortgage (RUS Informational Publication 
1718 B) are available from the Administrative Services Division, Rural 
Utilities Service, United States Department of Agriculture, Washington, 
DC 20250-1500. This document may be reproduced.

which with the passage of time and giving of notice could become an 
Event of Default hereunder.
    PROVIDED, FURTHER, by executing this Mortgage any consent of RUS 
that the Mortgagor would otherwise be required to obtain under this 
Section is hereby deemed to be given or waived by RUS by operation of 
law to the extent, but only to the extent, that to impose such a

such transaction, no default hereunder shall have occurred and be 
continuing; (4) the Mortgagor shall have delivered to the Mortgagees a 
certificate of its general manager or other officer, in form and

effect as if such successor entity had been named as the Mortgagor

may not, except as provided in [Section 3.10] above, without the prior 
written approval of each Mortgagee, sell, lease or transfer any

Event of Default or occurrence which with the passing of time and the 
giving of notice would be an Event of Default, (2) fair market value is 
obtained for such property, (3) the aggregate value of assets so sold, 
leased or transferred in any 12-month period is less than 10% of Net

utility plant.
    SECTION 3.12. Maintenance of Mortgaged Property: (a) So long as the

and the lessee shall obligate the lessee to comply with the provisions 
of subsections (a) and (b) of this Section in respect of the leased 
facilities and to permit the Mortgagor to operate the leased facilities 
in the event of any failure by the lessee to so comply.
    (b) If in the sole judgement of any Mortgagee, the Mortgaged 
Property is not being maintained and repaired in accordance with

    (b) The foregoing insurance coverage shall be obtained by means of 
bond and policy forms approved by regulatory authorities having 
jurisdiction, and, with respect to insurance upon any part of the 
Mortgaged Property, shall provide that the insurance shall be payable to 
the Mortgagees as their interests may appear by means of the standard 
mortgagee clause without contribution. Each policy or other contract for 
such insurance shall contain an agreement by the insurer that, 
notwithstanding any right of cancellation reserved to such insurer, such 
policy or contract shall continue in force for at least 30 days after 
written notice to each Mortgagee of cancellation.
    (c) In the event of damage to or the destruction or loss of any 
portion of the Mortgaged Property which is used or useful in the 
Mortgagor's business and which shall be covered by insurance, unless 
each Mortgagee shall otherwise agree, the Mortgagor shall replace or 
restore such damaged, destroyed or lost portion so that such Mortgaged 
Property shall be in substantially the same condition as it was in prior 
to such damage, destruction or loss, and shall apply the proceeds of the 
insurance for that purpose. The Mortgagor shall replace the lost portion 
of such Mortgaged Property or shall commence such restoration promptly 
after such damage, destruction or loss shall have occurred and shall 
complete such replacement or restoration as expeditiously as 
practicable, and shall pay or cause to be paid out of the proceeds of 
such insurance all costs and expenses in connection therewith.
    (d) Sums recovered under any policy or fidelity bond by the 
Mortgagor for a loss of funds advanced under the Notes or recovered by 
any Mortgagee or any Noteholder for any loss under such policy or bond

finance construction of utility plant secured or to be secured by this 
Mortgage, or unless otherwise directed by the Mortgagees, be applied to 
the prepayment of the Notes pro rata according to the unpaid principal 
amounts thereof (such prepayments to be applied to such Notes and 
installments thereof as may be designated by the respective Mortgagee at 
the time of any such prepayment), or be used to construct or acquire 
utility plant which will become part of the Mortgaged Property. At the 
request of any Mortgagee, the Mortgagor shall exercise such rights and 
remedies which they may have under such policy or fidelity bond and 
which may be designated by such Mortgagee, and the Mortgagor hereby 
irrevocably appoints each Mortgagee as its agent to exercise such rights

the Mortgagor shall pay all costs and reasonable expenses incurred by 
the Mortgagee in connection with such exercise.

Property: The Mortgagor agrees that any Mortgagee from time to time 
hereunder may, in its sole discretion, after having given 5 Business 
days prior written notice to Mortgagor, but shall not be obligated to, 
advance funds on behalf of Mortgagor, in order to insure the Mortgagor's 
compliance with any covenant, warranty, representation or agreement of 
the Mortgagor made in or pursuant to this Mortgage or any of the Loan 
Agreements, to preserve or protect any right or interest of the 
Mortgagees in the Mortgaged Property or under or pursuant to this 
Mortgage or any of the Loan Agreements, including without limitation, 
the payment of any insurance premiums or taxes and the satisfaction or 
discharge of any judgment or any Lien upon the Mortgaged Property or 
other property or assets of Mortgagor; provided, however, that the 
making of any such advance by or through any Mortgagee shall not 
constitute a waiver by any Mortgagee of any Event of Default with 
respect to which such advance is made nor relieve the Mortgagor of any 
such Event of Default. The Mortgagor shall pay to a Mortgagee upon 
demand all such advances made by such Mortgagee with interest thereon at 
a rate equal to that on the Note having the highest interest rate but in

[[Page 221]]

no event shall such rate be in excess of the maximum rate permitted by 
applicable law. All such advances shall be included in the obligations 
and secured by the security interest granted hereunder.

shall have become obligated to pay all or any part of the principal of 
(and premium, if any) or interest on any Note held by or indebtedness 
owed to such Mortgagee or who may be affected by the lien hereby 
created, an extension of the time for the payment of such principal, 
(and premium, if any) or interest, and after any such extension the 
Mortgagor will remain liable for the payment of such Note or 
indebtedness to the same extent as though it had at the time of such 
extension consented thereto in writing.
    SECTION 3.16. Application of Proceeds from Condemnation: (a) In the 
event that the Mortgaged Property or any part thereof, shall be taken 
under the power of eminent domain, all proceeds and avails therefrom may 
be used to finance construction of utility plant secured or to be 
secured by this Mortgage. Any proceeds not so used shall forthwith be 
applied by the Mortgagor: first, to the ratable payment of any 
indebtedness secured by this Mortgage other than principal of or 
interest on the Notes; second, to the ratable payment of interest which 
shall have accrued on the Notes and be unpaid; third, to the ratable 
payment of or on account of the unpaid principal of the Notes, to such 
installments thereof as may be designated by the respective Mortgagee at 
the time of any such payment; and fourth, the balance shall be paid to 
whomsoever shall be entitled thereto.
    (b) If any part of the Mortgaged Property shall be taken by eminent 
domain, each Mortgagee shall release the property so taken from the 
Mortgaged Property and shall be fully protected in so doing upon being 
furnished with:
    (1) A certificate of a duly authorized officer of the Mortgagor 
requesting such release, describing the property to be released and 
stating that such property has been taken by eminent domain and that all 
conditions precedent herein provided or relating to such release have

conditions precedent herein provided for relating to such release have 
been complied with.

to and Defaults under Loan Agreements: The Mortgagor will observe and 
perform all of the material covenants, agreements, terms and conditions 
contained in any Loan Agreement entered into in connection with the 
issuance of any of the Notes, as from time to time amended. The 
Mortgagor will send promptly to each Mortgagee notice of any default by 
the Mortgagor under any Loan Agreement and notice of any amendment to 
any Loan Agreement. Upon request of any Mortgagee, the Mortgagor will 
furnish to such Mortgagee single copies of such Loan Agreements and 
amendments thereto as such Mortgagee may request.
    SECTION 3.18. Rights of Way, etc., Necessary in Business: The 
Mortgagor will use its best efforts to obtain all such rights of way, 
easements from landowners and releases from lienors as shall be 
necessary or advisable in the conduct of its business, and, if requested 
by any Mortgagee, deliver to such Mortgagee evidence satisfactory to 
such Mortgagee of the obtaining of such rights of way, easements or 
releases.
    SECTION 3.19. Limitations on Providing Free Electric Services. The 
Mortgagor will not furnish or supply or cause to be furnished or 
supplied any electric power, energy or capacity free of charge to any 
person, firm or corporation, public or private, and the Mortgagor will 
enforce the payment of any and all amounts owning to the Mortgagor by 
reason of the ownership and operation of the Utility System by 
discontinuing such use, output, capacity, or service, or by filing suit 
therefor within 90 days after any such accounts are due, or by both such 
discontinuance and by filing suit.
    SECTION 3.20. Keeping Books; Inspection by Mortgagee: The Mortgagor 
will keep proper books, records and accounts, in which full and correct 
entries shall be made of all dealings or transactions of or in relation 
to the Notes and the Utility Systems, properties, business and affairs 
of the Mortgagor in accordance with the Accounting Requirements. The 
Mortgagor will at any and all times, upon the written request of any 
Mortgagee and at the expense of the Mortgagor, permit such Mortgagee by 
its representatives to inspect the Utility Systems and properties and 
properties, books of account, records, reports and other papers of the 
Mortgagor and to take copies and extracts therefrom, and will afford and 
procure a reasonable opportunity to make any such inspection, and the 
Mortgagor will furnish to each Mortgagee any and all such information as 
such Mortgagee may request, with respect to the performance by the 
Mortgagor of its covenants under this Mortgage, the Notes and the Loan 
Agreements.

or incurred by the Mortgagees in connection with the acceleration shall 
have been paid to the respective Mortgagees, then in every such case 
such Mortgagees representing at least 80% of the aggregate unpaid 
principal balance of all of the Notes then Outstanding may by written 
notice to the Mortgagor, for purposes of this Mortgage, annul such 
declaration and waive such default and the consequences thereof, but no 
such waiver shall extend to

[[Page 223]]

or affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.
    SECTION 4.03. Remedies of Mortgagees: If one or more of the Events 
of Default shall occur and be continuing, any Mortgagee personally or by 
attorney, in its or their discretion, may, in so far as not prohibited 
by law:
    (a) take immediate possession of the Mortgaged Property, collect and 
receive all credits, outstanding accounts and bills receivable of the 
Mortgagor and all rents, income, revenues, proceeds and profits 
pertaining to or arising from the Mortgaged Property, or any part 
thereof, whether then past due or accruing thereafter, and issue binding 
receipts therefor; and manage, control and operate the Mortgaged 
Property as fully as the Mortgagor might do if in possession thereof, 
including, without limitation, the making of all repairs or replacements 
deemed necessary or advisable by such Mortgagee in possession;
    (b) proceed to protect and enforce the rights of all of the 
Mortgagees by suits or actions in equity or at law in any court or 
courts of competent jurisdiction, whether for specific performance of 
any covenant or any agreement contained herein or in aid of the 
execution of any power herein granted or for the foreclosure hereof or 
hereunder or for the sale of the Mortgaged Property, or any part 
thereof, or to collect the debts hereby secured or for the enforcement 
of such other or additional appropriate legal or equitable remedies as 
may be deemed necessary or advisable to protect and enforce the rights 
and remedies herein granted or conferred, and in the event of the 
institution of any such action or suit the Mortgagee instituting such 
action or suit shall have the right to have appointed a receiver of the 
Mortgaged Property and of all proceeds, rents, income, revenues and 
profits pertaining thereto or arising therefrom, whether then past due 
or accruing after the appointment of such receiver, derived, received or 
had from the time of the commencement of such suit or action, and such 
receiver shall have all the usual powers and duties of receivers in like 
and similar cases, to the fullest extent permitted by law, and if 
application shall be made for the appointment of a receiver the 
Mortgagor hereby expressly consents that the court to which such 
application shall be made may make said appointment; and
    (c) sell or cause to be sold all and singular the Mortgaged Property 
or any part thereof, and all right, title, interest, claim and demand of 
the Mortgagor therein or thereto, at public auction at such place in any 
county (or its equivalent locality) in which the property to be sold, or 
any part thereof, is located, at such time and upon such terms as may be 
specified in a notice of sale, which shall state the time when and the 
place where the sale is to be held, shall contain a brief general 
description of the property to be sold, and shall be given by mailing a 
copy thereof to the Mortgagor at least fifteen (15) days prior to the 
date fixed for such sale and by publishing the same once in each week 
for two successive calendar weeks prior to the date of such sale in a 
newspaper of general circulation published in said locality or, if no 
such newspaper is published in such locality, in a newspaper of general 
circulation in such locality, the first such publication to be not less 
than fifteen (15) days nor more than thirty (30) days prior to the date 
fixed for such sale. Any sale to be made under this subparagraph (c) of 
this Section [4.03] may be adjourned from time to time by announcement 
at the time and place appointed for such sale or for such adjourned sale 
or sales, and without further notice or publication the sale may be had 
at the time and place to which the same shall be adjourned; provided, 
however, that in the event another or different notice of sale or 
another or different manner of conducting the same shall be required by 
law the notice of sale shall be given or the sale be conducted, as the 
case may be, in accordance with the applicable provisions of law. The 
expense incurred by any Mortgagee (including, but not limited to, 
receiver's fees, counsel fees, cost of advertisement and agents' 
compensation) in the exercise of any of the remedies provided in this 
Mortgage shall be secured by this Mortgage.
    (d) In the event that a Mortgagee proceeds to enforce remedies under 
this Section, any other Mortgagee may join in such proceedings. In the 
event that the Mortgagees are not in agreement with the method or manner 
of enforcement chosen by any other Mortgagee, the Mortgagees 
representing a majority of the aggregate unpaid principal balance on the 
then Outstanding Notes may direct the method and manner in which 
remedial action will proceed.
    SECTION 4.04. Application of Proceeds from Remedial Actions: Any 
proceeds or funds arising from the exercise of any rights or the 
enforcement of any remedies herein provided after the payment or 
provision for the payment of any and all costs and expenses in 
connection with the exercise of such rights or the enforcement of such 
remedies shall be applied first, to the ratable payment of indebtedness 
hereby secured other than the principal of or interest on the Notes; 
second, to the ratable payment of interest which shall have accrued on 
the Notes and which shall be unpaid; third, to the ratable payment of or 
on account of the unpaid principal of the Notes; and the balance, if 
any, shall be paid to whomsoever shall be entitled thereto.
    SECTION 4.05. Remedies Cumulative; No Election: Every right or 
remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Mortgagees or to the 
Noteholders shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every other 
right and

[[Page 224]]

remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law, or in 
equity, or by statute. The pursuit of any right or remedy shall not be 
construed as an election.
    SECTION 4.06. Waiver of Appraisement Rights; Marshaling of Assets 
Not Required: The Mortgagor, for itself and all who may claim through or 
under it, covenants that it will not at any time insist upon or plead, 
or in any manner whatever claim, or take the benefit or advantage of, 
any appraisement, valuation, stay, extension or redemption laws now or 
hereafter in force in any locality where any of the Mortgaged Property 
may be situated, in order to prevent, delay or hinder the enforcement or 
foreclosure of this Mortgage, or the absolute sale of the Mortgaged 
Property, or any part thereof, or the final and absolute putting into 
possession thereof, immediately after such sale, of the purchaser or 
purchasers thereat, and the Mortgagor, for itself and all who may claim 
through or under it, hereby waives the benefit of all such laws unless 
such waiver shall be forbidden by law. Under no circumstances shall 
there be any marshalling of assets upon any foreclosure or to other 
enforcement of this Mortgage.
    SECTION 4.07. Notice of Default: The Mortgagor covenants that it 
will give immediate written notice to each Mortgagee of the occurrence 
of any Event of Default or in the event that any right or remedy 
described in Sections [4.02] and [4.03] hereof is exercised or enforced 
or any action is taken to exercise or enforce any such right or remedy.

          ARTICLE V--POSSESSION UNTIL DEFAULT-DEFEASANCE CLAUSE

    SECTION 5.01. Possession Until Default: Until some one or more of 
the Events of Default shall have happened, the Mortgagor shall be 
suffered and permitted to retain actual possession of the Mortgaged 
Property, and to manage, operate and use the same and any part thereof, 
with the rights and franchises appertaining thereto, and to collect, 
receive, take, use and enjoy the rents, revenues, issues, earnings, 
income, proceeds, products and profits thereof or therefrom, subject to 
the provisions of this Mortgage.
    SECTION 5.02. Defeasance: If the Mortgagor shall pay or cause to be 
paid the whole amount of the principal of (and premium, if any) and 
interest on the Notes at the times and in the manner therein provided, 
and shall also pay or cause to be paid all other sums payable by the 
Mortgagor hereunder or under any Loan Agreement and shall keep and 
perform, all covenants herein required to be kept and performed by it, 
then and in that case, all property, rights and interest hereby conveyed 
or assigned or pledged shall revert to the Mortgagor and the estate, 
right, title and interest of the Mortgagee so paid shall thereupon 
cease, determine and become void and such Mortgagee, in such case, on 
written demand of the Mortgagor but at the Mortgagor's cost and expense, 
shall enter satisfaction of the Mortgage upon the record. In any event, 
each Mortgagee, upon payment in full to such Mortgagee by the Mortgagor 
of all principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on any Note held 
by such Mortgagee and the payment and discharge by the Mortgagor of all 
charges due to such Mortgagee hereunder or under any Loan Agreement, 
shall execute and deliver to the Mortgagor such instrument of 
satisfaction, discharge or release as shall be required by law in the 
circumstances.
    SECTION 5.03. Special Defeasance: Other than any Notes excluded by 
the foregoing Sections 5.01 and 5.02 and Notes which have become due and 
payable, the Mortgagor may cause the Lien of this Mortgage to be 
defeased with respect to any Note for which it has deposited or caused 
to be deposited in trust solely for the purpose an amount sufficient to 
pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on such Note for principal 
(and premium, if any) and interest to the date of maturity thereof; 
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that depository serving as trustee for such trust 
must first be accepted as such by the Mortgagee whose Notes are being 
defeased under this section. In such event, such a Note will no longer 
be considered to be an Outstanding Note for purposes of this Mortgage 
and the Mortgagee shall execute and deliver to the Mortgagor such 
instrument of satisfaction, discharge or release as shall be required by 
law in the circumstances.

                               ARTICLE VI

                              MISCELLANEOUS

    SECTION 6.01. Property Deemed Real Property: It is hereby declared 
to be the intention of the Mortgagor that any electric generating plant 
or plants and facilities and all electric transmission and distribution 
lines, or other Electric System or Utility System facilities, embraced 
in the Mortgaged Property, including (without limitation) all rights of 
way and easements granted or given to the Mortgagor or obtained by it to 
use real property in connection with the construction, operation or 
maintenance of such plant, lines, facilities or systems, and all other 
property physically attached to any of the foregoing, shall be deemed to 
be real property.
    SECTION 6.02. Mortgage to Bind and Benefit Successors and Assigns: 
All of the covenants, stipulations, promises, undertakings and 
agreements herein contained by or on behalf of the Mortgagor shall bind 
its successors and assigns, whether so specified or not, and all titles, 
rights and remedies hereby granted to or conferred upon the Mortgagees 
shall pass to and inure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of 
the Mortgagees and shall be deemed to be granted or conferred

[[Page 225]]

for the ratable benefit and security of all who shall from time to time 
be a Mortgagee. The Mortgagor hereby agrees to execute such consents, 
acknowledgements and other instruments as may be reasonably requested by 
any Mortgagee in connection with the assignment, transfer, mortgage, 
hypothecation or pledge of the rights or interests of such Mortgagee 
hereunder or under the Notes or in and to any of the Mortgaged Property.
    SECTION 6.03. Headings: The descriptive headings of the various 
articles and sections of this Mortgage and also the table of contents 
were formulated and inserted for convenience only and shall not be 
deemed to affect the meaning or construction of any of the provisions 
hereof.
    SECTION 6.04. Severability Clause: In case any provision of this 
Mortgage or in the Notes or in the Loan Agreements shall be invalid or 
unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the 
remaining provisions thereof shall not in any way be affected or 
impaired, nor shall any invalidity or unenforceability as to any 
Mortgagee hereunder affect or impair the rights hereunder of any other 
Mortgagee.
    SECTION 6.05. Mortgage Deemed Security Agreement: To the extent that 
any of the property described or referred to in this Mortgage is 
governed by the provisions of the UCC this Mortgage is hereby deemed a 
``security agreement'' under the UCC, and, if so elected by any 
Mortgagee, a ``financing statement'' under the UCC for said security 
agreement. The mailing addresses of the Mortgagor as debtor, and the 
Mortgagees as secured parties are as set forth in Section [1.05] hereof. 
If any Mortgagee so directs the Mortgagor to do so, the Mortgagor shall 
file as a financing statement under the UCC for said security agreement 
and for the benefit of all of the Mortgagees, an instrument other than 
this Mortgage. In such case, the instrument to be filed shall be in a 
form customarily accepted by the filing office as a financing statement. 
PROCEEDS OF COLLATERAL ARE COVERED HEREBY.
    SECTION 6.06. Indemnification by Mortgagor of Mortgagees: The 
Mortgagor agrees to indemnify and save harmless each Mortgagee against 
any liability or damages which any of them may incur or sustain in the 
exercise and performance of their rightful powers and duties hereunder. 
For such reimbursement and indemnity, each Mortgagee shall be secured 
under this Mortgage in the same manner as the Notes and all such 
reimbursements for expense or damage shall be paid to the Mortgagee 
incurring or suffering the same with interest at the rate specified in 
Section [3.14] hereof. The Mortgagor's obligation to indemnify the 
Mortgagees under this section and under Section [3.04] shall survive the 
satisfaction of the Notes, the reconveyance or foreclosure of this 
Mortgage, the acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure, or any 
transfer or abandonment of the Mortgaged Property.
    IN WITNESS WHEREOF, ---------- as Mortgagor, has caused this 
Restated Mortgage and Security Agreement to be signed in its name and 
its corporate seal to be hereunto affixed and attested by its officers 
thereunto duly authorized, and UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, as Mortgagee, 
and as Mortgagee, has caused this Restated Mortgage and Security 
Agreement to be signed in its name by duly authorized persons, all as of

          Subpart C_Loan Contracts With Distribution Borrowers

    Source: 60 FR 67410, Dec. 29, 1995, unless otherwise noted.


Sec.  1718.100  General.

    (a) Purpose.The purpose of this subpart is to set forth the 
policies, requirements, and procedures governing loan contracts entered 
into between the Rural Utilities Service (RUS) and distribution 
borrowers or, in some cases, other electric borrowers.
    (b) Flexibility for individual circumstances.The intent of this 
subpart is to provide the flexibility to address the different needs and 
different credit risks of individual borrowers, and other special 
circumstances of individual lending situations. The model loan contract 
contained in Appendix A of this subpart provides an example of what a 
loan contract with an ``average'' or ``typical'' distribution borrower 
may look like under ``average'' or ``typical'' circumstances. Depending 
on the credit risks and other circumstances of individual loans, RUS may 
execute loan contracts with provisions that are substantially different 
than those set forth in the model. RUS may develop alternative model 
loan contract provisions. If it does, such provisions will be made 
available to the public.
    (c) Resolution of any differences in contractual provisions.If any 
provision of the loan contract appears to be in conflict with provisions 
of the mortgage, the loan contract shall have precedence with respect to 
the contractual relationship between the borrower and RUS with respect 
to such provision. If either document is silent on a matter addressed in 
the other document, the other document shall have precedence with 
respect to the contractual relationship between the borrower and RUS 
with respect to such matter.
    (d) Certain loan contract provisions subject to subsequent 
rulemaking.If a loan contract provision imposes an obligation or 
limitation on the borrower whose interpretation or specification is 
subject to RUS regulations or the discretion of the Administrator or 
RUS, such interpretation or specification shall be subject to subsequent 
rulemaking. Such interpretation or specification of the borrower's 
obligations or limitations may not exceed the authority granted to the 
Administrator or RUS in the loan contract provision.


Sec.  1718.101  Applicability.

    (a) Distribution borrowers.The provisions of this subpart apply to 
all distribution borrowers that obtain a loan or loan guarantee from RUS 
approved on or after January 29, 1996. Distribution borrowers that 
obtain a lien accommodation or any other form of financial assistance 
from RUS after January 29, 1996, may be required to execute a new loan 
contract and new mortgage. Moreover, any distribution borrower may 
submit a request to RUS that a new loan contract and new mortgage be 
executed. Within the constraints of time and staff resources, RUS will 
attempt to honor such requests. Borrowers must first obtain the 
concurrence of any other mortgagees on their existing mortgage before a 
new mortgage can be executed.
    (b) Other borrowers.Borrowers other than distribution borrowers may 
also submit requests for execution of a new loan contract pursuant to 
this subpart and a new mortgage pursuant to subpart B of this part. RUS 
may approve such requests if it determines that such approval is in the 
government's financial interest. If other mortgagees are on the 
borrower's existing mortgage, their concurrence would be required before 
a new mortgage could be executed.


Sec.  1718.102  Definitions.

    For the purposes of this subpart:

[[Page 229]]

    Borrower means any organization that has an outstanding loan made or 
guaranteed by the Rural Utilities Service (RUS) or its predecessor, the 
Rural Electrification Administration, for rural electrification, or that 
is seeking such financing.
    Distribution borrower means a borrower that sells or intends to sell 
electric power and energy at retail in rural areas, the latter being 
defined in 7 CFR 1710.2.
    Loan documents means the mortgage (or other security instrument 
acceptable to RUS), the loan contract, and the promissory note entered 
into between the borrower and RUS.


Sec.  1718.103  Loan contract provisions.

    Loan contracts executed pursuant to this subpart shall contain such 
provisions as RUS determines are appropriate to further the purposes of 
the RE Act and to ensure that the security for the loan will be 
reasonably adequate and that the loan will be repaid according to the

located is then participating in the national flood insurance program, 
as required by the Flood Insurance Act and any Rules, and (ii) the 
Borrower has obtained flood insurance coverage with respect to such 
building and contents as may then be required pursuant to the Flood 
Insurance Act and any Rules.
    (m) Compliance With Loan Contract and Mortgage. That the Borrower is 
in material compliance with all provisions of this Agreement and the 
Mortgage.

                     Section 4.2. Special Conditions

    The obligation of RUS to make any Advance hereunder is also subject 
to satisfaction, on or before the date of such Advance, of each of the 
special conditions, if any, listed in Schedule 1 hereto.

                    Article V--Affirmative Covenants

                         Section 5.1. Generally

    Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by RUS, while this Agreement 
is in effect, whether or not any Advance is outstanding, the Borrower 
agrees to duly observe each of the affirmative covenants contained in 
this Article:

                    Section 5.2. Annual Certificates

    (a) Performance Under Loan Documents. The Borrower shall duly 
observe and perform all of its obligations under each of the Loan 
Documents.
    (b) Annual Certification. Within ninety (90) days after the close of 
each calendar year, commencing with the year following the year in which 
the initial Advance hereunder shall have been made, the Borrower shall 
deliver to RUS a written statement signed by its General Manager, 
stating that during such year the Borrower has fulfilled all of its 
obligations under the Loan Documents throughout such year in all 
material respects or, if there has been a default in the fulfillment of 
any such obligations, specifying each such default known to said person 
and the nature and status thereof.

      Section 5.3. Simultaneous Prepayment of Contemporaneous Loans

    If the Borrower shall at any time prepay in whole or in part the 
Contemporaneous Loan described on Schedule 1, the Borrower shall prepay 
the RUS Note correspondingly in

[[Page 236]]

order to maintain the ratio that the Contemporaneous Loan bears to the 
RUS Commitment. If the RUS Note calls for a prepayment penalty or 
premium, such amount shall be paid but shall not be used in computing 
the amount needed to be paid to RUS under this section to maintain such 
ratio. In the case of Contemporaneous Loans and RUS Notes existing prior 
to the date of this Agreement under previous agreements, prepayments 
shall be treated as if governed by this section. Provided, however, in 
all cases prepayments associated with refinancing or refunding a 
Contemporaneous Loan pursuant to Article II of the Mortgage are not 
considered to be prepayments for purposes of this Agreement if they 
satisfy each of the following requirements:
    (a) Principal. The principal amount of such refinancing or refunding 
loan is not less than the amount of loan principal being refinanced; and
    (b) Weighted Average Life. The weighted average life of the 
refinancing or refunding loan is materially equal to the weighted 
average remaining life of the loan being refinanced.

Section 5.4 Rates To Provide Revenue Sufficient to Meet Coverage Ratios 
                              Requirements

    (a) Prospective Requirement. The Borrower shall design and implement 
rates for utility service furnished by it to provide sufficient revenue 
(along with other revenue available to the Borrower in the case of TIER 
and DSC) (i) to pay all fixed and variable expenses when and as due, 
(ii) to provide and maintain reasonable working capital, and (iii) to 
maintain, on an annual basis, the Coverage Ratios. In designing and 
implementing rates under this paragraph, such rates should be capable of 
producing at least enough revenue to meet the requirements of this 
paragraph under the assumption that average weather conditions in the 
Borrower's service territory shall prevail in the future, including 
average Utility System damage and outages due to weather and the related 
costs.
    (b) The average Coverage Ratios achieved by the Borrower in the 2 
best years out of the 3 most recent calendar years must be not less than 
any of the following:

TIER=1.25
DSC=1.25
OTIER=1.1
ODSC=1.1

    (c) Prospective Notice of Change in Rates. The Borrower shall give 
thirty (30) days prior written notice of any proposed change in its 
general rate structure to RUS if RUS has requested in writing that it be 
notified in advance of such changes.
    (d) Routine Reporting of Coverage Ratios. Promptly following the end 
of each calendar year, the Borrower shall report, in writing, to RUS the 
TIER, Operating TIER, DSC and Operating DSC levels which were achieved 
during that calendar year.
    (e) Reporting Non-achievement of Retrospective Requirement. If the 
Borrower fails to achieve the average levels required by paragraph (b) 
of this section, it must promptly notify RUS in writing to that effect.
    (f) Corrective Plans. Within 30 days of sending a notice to RUS 
under paragraph (e) of this section, or of being notified by RUS, 
whichever is earlier, the Borrower in consultation with RUS, shall 
provide a written plan satisfactory to RUS setting forth the actions 
that shall be taken to achieve the required Coverage Ratios on a timely 
basis.
    (g) Noncompliance. Failure to design and implement rates pursuant to 
paragraph (a) of this section and failure to develop and implement the 
plan called for in paragraph (f) of this section shall constitute an 
Event of Default under this Agreement in the event that REA so notifies 
the Borrower to that effect under section [7.1(d)] of this Agreement.

                     Section 5.5. Depreciation Rates

    The Borrower shall adopt as its depreciation rates only those which 
have been previously approved for the Borrower by RUS.

                    Section 5.6. Property Maintenance

    The Borrower shall maintain and preserve its Utility System in 
compliance in all material respects with the provisions of the Mortgage, 
RUS Regulations and all applicable laws.

                      Section 5.7. Financial Books

    The Borrower shall at all times keep, and safely preserve, proper 
books, records and accounts in which full and true entries shall be made 
of all of the dealings, business and affairs of the Borrower and its 
Subsidiaries, in accordance with any applicable RUS Accounting 
Requirements.

                    Section 5.8. Rights of Inspection

    The Borrower shall afford RUS, through its representatives, 
reasonable opportunity, at all times during business hours and upon 
prior notice, to have access to and the right to inspect the Utility 
System, any other property encumbered by the Mortgage, and any or all 
books, records, accounts, invoices, contracts, leases, payrolls, 
canceled checks, statements and other documents and papers of every kind 
belonging to or in the possession of the Borrower or in anyway 
pertaining to its property or business, including its Subsidiaries, if 
any, and to make copies or extracts therefrom.

                       Section 5.9. Area Coverage

    (a) The Borrower shall make diligent effort to extend electric 
service to all unserved persons within the service area of the Borrower

[[Page 237]]

who (i) desire such service and (ii) meet all reasonable requirements 
established by the Borrower as a condition of such service.
    (b) If economically feasible and reasonable considering the cost of 
providing such service and/or the effects on consumers' rates, such 
service shall be provided, to the maximum extent practicable, at the 
rates and minimum charges established in the Borrower's rate schedules, 
without the payment of such persons, other than seasonal or temporary 
consumers, of a contribution in aid of construction. A seasonal consumer 
is one that demands electric service only during certain seasons of the 
year. A temporary consumer is a seasonal or year-round consumer that 
demands electric service over a period of less than five years.
    (c) The Borrower may assess contributions in aid of construction 
provided such assessments are consistent with this section.

                 Section 5.10. Real Property Acquisition

    In acquiring real property, the Borrower shall comply in all 
material respects with the provisions of the Uniform Relocation 
Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (the 
``Uniform Act''), as amended by the Uniform Relocation Act Amendments of 
1987, and 49 CFR part 24, referenced by 7 CFR part 21, to the extent the 
Uniform Act is applicable to such acquisition.

               Section 5.11. ``Buy American'' Requirements

    The Borrower shall use or cause to be used in connection with the 
expenditures of funds advanced on account of the Loan only such 
unmanufactured articles, materials, and supplies as have been mined or 
produced in the United States or any eligible country, and only such 
manufactured articles, materials, and supplies as have been manufactured 
in the United States or any eligible country substantially all from 
articles, materials, and supplies mined, produced or manufactured, as 
the case may be, in the United States or any eligible country, except to 
the extent RUS shall determine that such use shall be impracticable or 
that the cost thereof shall be unreasonable. For purposes of this 
section, an ``eligible country'' is any country that applies with 
respect to the United States an agreement ensuring reciprocal access for 
United States products and services and United States suppliers to the 
markets of that country, as determined by the United States Trade 
Representative.

                Section 5.12. Power Requirements Studies

    The Borrower shall prepare and use power requirements studies of its 
electric loads and future energy and capacity requirements in 
conformance with RUS Regulations.

 Section 5.13. Long Range Engineering Plans and Construction Work Plans

    The Borrower shall develop, maintain and use up-to-date long-range

    The Borrower shall use design standards, construction standards, and 
lists of acceptable materials in conformance with RUS Regulations.

                 Section 5.15. Plans and Specifications

    The Borrower shall submit plans and specifications for construction 
to RUS for review and approval, in conformance with RUS Regulations, if 
the construction will be financed in whole or in part by a loan made or 
guaranteed by RUS.

Section 5.16. Standard Forms of Construction Contracts, and Engineering 
                  and Architectural Services Contracts

    The Borrower shall use the standard forms of contracts promulgated 
by RUS for construction, procurement, engineering services and 
architectural services in conformance with RUS Regulations, if the 
construction, procurement, or services are being financed in whole or in 
part by a loan being made or guaranteed by RUS.

               Section 5.17. Contract Bidding Requirements

    The Borrower shall follow RUS contract bidding procedures in 
conformance with RUS Regulations when contracting for construction or 
procurement financed in whole or in part by a loan made or guaranteed by 
RUS.

                     Section 5.18. Nondiscrimination

    (a) Equal Opportunity Provisions in Construction Contracts. The 
Borrower shall incorporate or cause to be incorporated into any 
construction contract, as defined in Executive Order 11246 of September 
24, 1965 and implementing regulations, which is paid for in whole or in 
part with funds obtained from RUS or borrowed on the credit of the 
United States pursuant to a grant, contract, loan, insurance or 
guarantee, or undertaken pursuant to any RUS program involving such 
grant, contract, loan, insurance or guarantee, the equal opportunity 
provisions set forth in Exhibit B hereto entitled Equal Opportunity 
Contract Provisions.
    (b) Equal Opportunity Contract Provisions Also Bind the Borrower. 
The Borrower further agrees that it shall be bound by such equal 
opportunity clause in any federally assisted construction work which it 
performs itself other than through the permanent work force directly 
employed by an agency of government.

[[Page 238]]

    (c) Sanctions and Penalties. The Borrower agrees that it shall 
cooperate actively with RUS and the Secretary of Labor in obtaining the 
compliance of contractors and subcontractors with the equal opportunity 
clause and the rules, regulations and relevant orders of the Secretary 
of Labor, that it shall furnish RUS and the Secretary of Labor such 
information as they may require for the supervision of such compliance, 
and that it shall otherwise assist the administering agency in the 
discharge of RUS's primary responsibility for securing compliance. The 
Borrower further agrees that it shall refrain from entering into any 
contract or contract modification subject to Executive Order 11246 with 
a contractor debarred from, or who has not demonstrated eligibility for, 
Government contracts and federally assisted construction contracts 
pursuant to Part II, Subpart D of Executive Order 11246 and shall carry 
out such sanctions and penalties for violation of the equal opportunity 
clause as may be imposed upon contractors and subcontractors by RUS or 
the Secretary of Labor pursuant to Part II, Subpart D of Executive Order 
11246. In addition, the Borrower agrees that if it fails or refuses to 
comply with these undertakings RUS may cancel, terminate or suspend in 
whole or in part this contract, may refrain from extending any further 
assistance under any of its programs subject to Executive Order 11246 
until satisfactory assurance of future compliance has been received from

satisfactory to RUS. The Borrower shall also furnish to RUS from time to 
time such other reports concerning the financial condition or operations 
of the Borrower, including its Subsidiaries, as RUS may reasonably 
request or RUS Regulations require.

             Section 5.20. Miscellaneous Reports and Notices

    The Borrower shall furnish to RUS:
    (a) Notice of Default. Promptly after becoming aware thereof, notice 
of: (i) the occurrence of any default; and (ii) the receipt of any

any event which with the giving of notice or the passage of time, or 
both, could become an ``Event of Default'' under the Mortgage.
    (b) Notice of Non-Environmental Litigation. Promptly after the 
commencement thereof, notice of the commencement of all actions, suits

alleged violations of such laws, or which claim personal injury or 
property damage to any person as a result of environmental factors or 
conditions for which the Borrower is not fully covered by insurance, or

the condition, financial or otherwise, operations, properties or 
business of the Borrower, or on the ability of the Borrower to perform 
its obligations under the Loan Documents.
    (d) Notice of Change of Place of Business. Promptly in writing,

included in the planned project, will exceed the lesser of 5 Megawatts 
or 30 percent of the Borrower's Equity;
    (2) Existing electric facilities or systems in service whose 
purchase price, or capitalized value in the case of a lease, exceeds ten

preceding the acquisition or start of construction of facilities.

    Section 6.3. Limitations on Changing Principal Place of Business

    The Borrower shall not change its principal place of business or 
keep property in a county not shown on a schedule to the Mortgage if the 
change would cause the lien in favor of RUS to become unperfected or 
fail to become perfected, as the case may be, unless, prior thereto, the 
Borrower shall have taken all steps required by law in order to assure 
that the lien in favor of RUS remains or becomes perfected, as the case 
may be, and, in either event, such lien has the priority accorded by the 
Mortgage.

     Section 6.4. Limitations on Employment and Retention of Manager

    At any time any Event of Default, or any occurrence which with the 
passage of time or giving of notice would be an Event of Default, occurs 
and is continuing the Borrower shall not employ any general manager of 
the Utility System or the Electric System or any person exercising 
comparable authority to such a manager unless such employment shall 
first have been approved by RUS. If any Event of Default, or any 
occurrence which with the passage of time or giving of notice would be 
an Event of Default, occurs and is continuing and RUS requests the 
Borrower to terminate the employment of any such manager or person 
exercising comparable authority, or RUS requests the Borrower to 
terminate any contract for operating the Utility System or the Electric 
System, the Borrower shall do so within thirty (30) days after the date 
of such notice. All contracts in respect of the employment of any such 
manager or person exercising comparable authority, or for the operation 
of the Utility System or the Electric System, shall contain provisions 
to permit compliance with the foregoing covenants.

Administrator, voluntarily or involuntarily sell, convey or dispose of 
any portion of its business or assets (including, without limitation, 
any portion of its franchise or service territory) to another entity or 
person if such sale, conveyance or disposition could reasonably be 
expected to reduce the Borrower's existing or future requirements for 
energy or capacity being furnished to the Borrower under any wholesale 
power contract which has been pledged as security to RUS.

     Section 6.7. Limitations on Using non-FDIC Insured Depositories

    Without the prior written approval of RUS, the Borrower shall not 
place the proceeds of the Loan or any loan which has been made or

not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or other 
federal agency acceptable to RUS.

                Section 6.8. Limitation on Distributions

any calendar year make any Distributions (exclusive of any Distributions 
to the estates of deceased natural patrons) to its members, stockholders

Distribution, the Equity of the Borrower shall be greater than or equal 
to 30% of its Total Assets; or

    Provided however, that in no event shall the Borrower make any 
Distributions if there is unpaid when due any installment of principal 
of (premium, if any) or interest on its Notes, if the Borrower is 
otherwise in default hereunder or if, after giving effect to any such 
Distribution, the Borrower's current and accrued assets would be less 
than its current and accrued liabilities.

the Secretary of the Interior pursuant to the Historic Sites Act of 1935 
and the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966.

                      Section 6.12. Rate Reductions

Default hereunder and there has been no continuing occurrence which with 
the passage of time and giving of notice could become an Event of 
Default hereunder.
    PROVIDED, FURTHER, by executing this Agreement any consent of RUS 
that the Borrower would otherwise be required to obtain under this 
Section is hereby deemed to be given or waived by RUS by operation of 
law to the extent, but only to the extent, that to impose such a 
requirement of RUS consent would clearly violate federal laws or RUS 
Regulations.

  Section 6.14. Limitations on Issuing Additional Indebtedness Secured 
                           Under the Mortgage

    (a) The Borrower shall not issue any Additional Notes under the

does not exceed the weighted average of the expected remaining useful 
lives of the assets being financed;

maturity of not less than 5 years.
    (b) The Borrower shall not issue any Additional Notes under the

average remaining life of the Notes being refinanced.
    (c) Any request for consent from RUS under this section, shall be 
accompanied by a certificate of the Borrower's manager substantially in 
the form attached to this Agreement as Exhibit C-1 in the case of Notes

               Section 6.16. Additional Negative Covenants

                     Section 7.1. Events of Default

    The following shall be Events of Default under this Agreement:
    (a) Representations and Warranties. Any representation or warranty 
made by the Borrower in Article II hereof or any certificate furnished 
to RUS hereunder or under the Mortgage shall prove to have been 
incorrect in any material respect at the time made and shall at the time 
in question be untrue or incorrect in any material respect and remain 
uncured;
    (b) Payment. Default shall be made in the payment of or on account 
of interest on or principal of the Note when and as the same shall be 
due and payable, whether by acceleration or otherwise, which shall

trustee, sequestrator or similar official, or ordering the winding up or 
liquidation of its affairs, and such decree or order shall remain 
unstayed and in effect for a period of ninety (90) consecutive days or 
the Borrower shall commence a voluntary case under any applicable 
bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter in effect, 
or under any such law, or consent to the appointment or taking 
possession by a receiver, liquidator, assignee, custodian or trustee, of

immediately preceding subsection, the dissolution or liquidation of the

execution, garnishment or attachment of such consequence as shall impair 
its ability to continue its business or fulfill its obligations and such 
execution, garnishment or attachment shall not be vacated within 30 
days. The term ``dissolution or liquidation of the Borrower'', as used 
in this subsection, shall not be construed to include the cessation of 
the corporate existence of the Borrower resulting either from a merger 
or consolidation of the Borrower into or with another corporation 
following a transfer of all or substantially all its assets as an 
entirety, under the conditions permitting such actions.

                         Article VIII--Remedies

                         Section 8.1. Generally

    Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, then RUS may pursue all 
rights and remedies available to RUS that are contemplated by this 
Agreement or the Mortgage in the manner, upon the conditions, and with 
the effect provided in this Agreement or the Mortgage, including, but 
not limited to, a suit for specific performance, injunctive relief or 
damages. Nothing herein shall limit the right of RUS to pursue all 
rights and remedies available to a creditor following the occurrence of 
an Event of Default listed in Article VII hereof. Each right, power and 
remedy of RUS shall be cumulative and concurrent, and recourse to one or 
more rights or remedies shall not constitute a waiver of any other 
right, power or remedy.

                   Section 8.2. Suspension of Advances

    In addition to the rights, powers and remedies referred to in the 
immediately preceding section, RUS may, in its absolute discretion, 
suspend making Advances hereunder if (i) any Event of Default, or any 
occurrence which with the passage of time or giving of notice would be 
an Event of Default, occurs and is continuing; (ii) there has occurred a 
change in the business or condition, financial or otherwise, of the 
Borrower which in the opinion of RUS materially and adversely affects 
the Borrower's ability to meet its obligations under the Loan Documents, 
or (iii) RUS is authorized to do so under RUS Regulations.

    To the extent allowed by law, the Borrower shall pay all costs and

connection with the enforcement of the Loan Documents or with the 
preparation for such enforcement if RUS has reasonable grounds to

                       Section 9.3. Late Payments

    If payment of any amount due hereunder is not received at the United

designate to the Borrower within five (5) Business Days after the due 
date thereof or such other time period as RUS may prescribe from time to 
time in its policies of general application in connection with any late 
payment charge (such unpaid amount being herein called the ``delinquent 
amount'', and the period beginning after such due date until payment of 
the delinquent amount being herein called the ``late-payment period''), 
the Borrower shall pay to

[[Page 243]]

RUS, in addition to all other amounts due under the terms of the Note, 
the Mortgage and this Agreement, any late-payment charge as may be fixed 
by RUS Regulations from time to time on the delinquent amount for the 
late-payment period.

                        Section 9.4. Filing Fees

and instruments as may be required by RUS in connection with this 
Agreement, including, without limitation, all documentary stamps, 
recordation and transfer taxes and other costs and taxes incident to 
recordation of any document or instrument in connection herewith. 
Borrower agrees to save harmless and indemnify RUS from and against any 
liability resulting from the failure to pay any required documentary 
stamps, recordation and transfer taxes, recording costs, or any other 
expenses incurred by RUS in connection with this Agreement. The 
provisions of this subsection shall survive the execution and delivery 
of this Agreement and the payment of all other amounts due hereunder or 
due on the Note.

                         Section 9.5. No Waiver

    No failure on the part of RUS to exercise, and no delay in 
exercising, any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor 
shall any single or partial exercise by RUS of any right hereunder 
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any 
other right.

                       Section 9.6. Governing Law

    EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT GOVERNED BY APPLICABLE FEDERAL LAW, THE LOAN 
DOCUMENTS SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE 
WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE [IN WHICH THE BORROWER IS INCORPORATED].

                      Section 9.7. Holiday Payments

    If any payment to be made by the Borrower hereunder shall become due 
on a day which is not a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the 
next succeeding Business Day and such extension of time shall be 
included in computing any interest in respect of such payment.

                         Section 9.8. Rescission

    The Borrower may elect not to borrow the RUS Commitment in which 
event RUS shall release the Borrower from its obligations hereunder, 
provided the Borrower complies with such terms and conditions as RUS may 
impose for such release and provided also that if the Borrower has any 
remaining obligations to RUS for loans made or guaranteed by RUS under 
any Prior Loan Contracts, RUS may, under Section [9.15] of this Loan 
Contract, withhold such release until all such obligations have been 
satisfied and discharged.

                   Section 9.9. Successors and Assigns

    This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the 
Borrower and RUS and their respective successors and assigns, except 
that the Borrower may not assign or transfer its rights or obligations 
hereunder without the prior written consent of RUS.

              Section 9.10. Complete Agreement; Amendments

    Subject to RUS Regulations, this Agreement and the other Loan 
Documents are intended by the parties to be a complete and final 
expression of their agreement. However, RUS reserves the right to waive 
its rights to compliance with any provision of this Agreement and the 
other Loan Documents. No amendment, modification, or waiver of any 
provision hereof or thereof, and no consent to any departure of the 
Borrower herefrom or therefrom, shall be effective unless approved in 
writing by RUS in the form of either a RUS Regulation or other writing 
signed by or on behalf of RUS, and then such waiver or consent shall be 
effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for 
which given.

                         Section 9.11. Headings

    The headings and sub-headings contained in the titling of this 
Agreement are intended to be used for convenience only and do not 
constitute part of this Agreement.

                       Section 9.12. Severability

    If any term, provision or condition, or any part thereof, of this 
Agreement or the Mortgage shall for any reason be found or held invalid 
or unenforceable by any governmental agency or court of competent 
jurisdiction, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect the 
remainder of such term, provision or condition nor any other term, 
provision or condition, and this Agreement, the Note, and the Mortgage 
shall survive and be construed as if such invalid or unenforceable term, 
provision or condition had not been contained therein.

                      Section 9.13. Right of Setoff

    Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of 
Default, RUS is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, 
without prior notice to the Borrower, to exercise rights of setoff or 
recoupment and apply any and all amounts held or hereafter held, by RUS 
or owed to the Borrower or for the credit or account of the Borrower 
against any and all of the obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter 
existing hereunder or under the Note. RUS

[[Page 244]]

agrees to notify the Borrower promptly after any such setoff or 
recoupment and the application thereof, provided that the failure to 
give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff, 
recoupment or application. The rights of RUS under this section are in 
addition to any other rights and remedies (including other rights of 
setoff or recoupment) which RUS may have. Borrower waives all rights of 
setoff, deduction, recoupment or counterclaim.

                  Section 9.14. Schedules and Exhibits

    Each Schedule and Exhibit attached hereto and referred to herein is 
each an integral part of this Agreement.

                   Section 9.15. Prior Loan Contracts

    It is understood and agreed that with respect to all loan agreements 
previously entered into by and between RUS and the Borrower (hereinafter 
being referred to as ``Prior Loan Contracts'') the Borrower shall be 
required, after the date hereof, to meet affirmative and negative 
covenants as set forth in this Agreement rather than those set forth in 
the Prior Loan Contracts. In addition, any remaining obligation of RUS 
to make additional advances on promissory notes of the Borrower that 
have been previously delivered to RUS under Prior Loan Contracts shall, 
after the date hereof, be subject to the conditions set forth in this 
Agreement. In the event of any conflict between any provision set forth 
in a Prior Loan Contract and any provision in this Agreement, the 
requirements as set forth in this Agreement shall apply. Nothing in this 
section shall, however, eliminate or modify any special condition, 
special affirmative covenant or special negative covenant, if any, 
unless specifically agreed to in writing by RUS.

            Section 9.16. Authority of Representatives of RUS

    In the case of any consent, approval or waiver from RUS that is 
required under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, such consent, 
approval or waiver must be in writing and signed by an authorized RUS 
representative to be effective. As used in this section, ``authorized 
RUS representative'' means the Administrator of RUS, and also means a 
person to whom the Administrator has officially delegated specific or 
general authority to take the action in question.

                           Section 9.17. Term

    This Agreement shall remain in effect until one of the following two 
events has occurred:
    (a) The Borrower and RUS replace this Agreement with another written 
agreement; or
    (b) All of the Borrower's obligations under the prior loan contracts 
and this Agreement have been discharged and paid.
    IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to 
be duly executed as of the day and year first above written.

            Exhibit B--Equal Opportunity Contract Provisions

    During the performance of this contract, the contractor agrees as 
follows:
    (a) The contractor shall not discriminate against any employee or 
applicant for employment because of race, color, religion, sex or 
national origin. The contractor shall take affirmative action to ensure 
that applicants are employed, and that employees are treated during 
employment without regard to their race, color, religion, sex or 
national origin. Such action shall include, but not be limited to the 
following: employment, upgrading, demotion or transfer, recruitment or 
recruitment advertising; layoff or termination; rates of pay or other 
forms of compensation; and selection for training, including 
apprenticeship. The contractor agrees to post in conspicuous places, 
available to employees and applicants for employment, notices to be 
provided setting forth the provisions of this nondiscrimination clause.
    (b) The contractor shall, in all solicitations or advertisements for 
employees placed by or on behalf of the contractor, state that all 
qualified applicants shall receive consideration for employment without 
regard to race, color, religion, sex or national origin.
    (c) The contractor shall send to each labor union or representative 
of workers with which he has a collective bargaining agreement or other 
contract or understanding, a notice to be provided advising the said 
labor union or workers' representative of the contractor's commitments 
under this section, and shall post copies of the notice in conspicuous 
places available to employees and applicants for employment.
    (d) The contractor shall comply with all provisions of Executive 
Order 11246 of September 24, 1965, and of the rules, regulations and 
relevant orders of the Secretary of Labor.
    (e) The contractor shall furnish all information and reports 
required by Executive Order 11246 of September 24, 1965, and by the 
rules, regulations and orders of the Secretary of Labor, or pursuant 
thereto, and shall permit access to his books, records and accounts by 
the administering agency and the Secretary of Labor for purposes of 
investigation to ascertain compliances with such rules, regulations and 
orders.
    (f) In the event of the contractor's noncompliance with the non-
discrimination clauses of this contract or with any of the said rules, 
regulations or orders, this contract may be cancelled, terminated or 
suspended in whole or in part and the contractor may be declared 
ineligible for further Government contracts or federally assisted 
construction contracts in accordance with procedures authorized in 
Executive Order 11246 of September 24, 1965, and such other sanctions 
may be imposed and remedies invoked as provided in said Executive Order 
or by rule, regulation or order of the Secretary of Labor, or as 
otherwise provided by law.

purchase order as the administering agency may direct as a means of

Provided, however, that in the event a contractor becomes involved in, 
or is threatened with, litigation with a subcontractor or vendor as a 
result of such direction by the agency, the contractor may request the 
United States to enter into such litigation to protect the interests of 
the United States.
