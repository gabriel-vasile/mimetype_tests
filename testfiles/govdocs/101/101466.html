<P>		<STRONG>COFFIN, <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Senior Circuit Judge</SPAN>.</STRONG> Petitioner Damon E.
Cunningham, Jr. has been a pipe fitter for Bath Iron Works in Bath,
Maine, for more than 25 years, and since 1998 has worked at the
company's East Brunswick Manufacturing Facility ("EBMF").  At the
EBMF, which is approximately 3.5 to 4 miles from BIW's main
shipyard in Bath, workers prefabricate pipe units that are
transported by truck and installed in ships at Bath.  Cunningham
injured his back at EBMF in October 1999 and subsequently sought
disability coverage under the Longshore and Harbor Workers'
Compensation Act ("LHWCA"), 33 U.S.C. §§ 901-950. An Administrative
Law Judge ("ALJ") and the Benefits Review Board ("BRB" or "Board")
denied his claim on the ground that the EBMF is not a covered work
location.</P>

<P>	In his petition for review, Cunningham asserts that the ALJ
and Board erred by too narrowly defining the reach of the statute. 
He contends that the EBMF qualifies as an area that adjoins
navigable waters.  <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">See</SPAN> 33 U.S.C. § 903(a).  Although Cunningham
presents a sympathetic case based on the nature of his employment,
we conclude that the ALJ properly determined that the LHWCA does
not presently confer benefits on employees who are injured at the
EBMF.  We therefore must deny the petition for review.</P>

<P><CENTER>I. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Background</SPAN></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	The LHWCA was enacted in 1927 to provide compensation for
maritime workers who were injured while working on navigable waters
in the course of their employment.  <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Director, Office of Workers'
Comp. Programs</SPAN> v. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Perini North River Assocs.</SPAN>, 459 U.S. 297, 311
(1983); <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Northeast Marine Terminal Co.</SPAN> v. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Caputo</SPAN>, 432 U.S. 249, 257-58 (1977).  Initially, a maritime worker was covered under the
statute only if his injury occurred while he was performing work on
the seaward side of the shore.  <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Caputo</SPAN>, 432 U.S. at 258.<A HREF="#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  In 1972,
the law was significantly amended, <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">see</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">id.</SPAN> at 261; <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Perini North
River Assocs.</SPAN>, 459 U.S. at 313, and one of the changes made is at
the heart of this case.  Rather than stopping at the water's edge,
coverage under the act was extended shoreward in recognition that
"modern technology had moved much of the longshoreman's work onto
the land," <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Caputo</SPAN>, 432 U.S. at 262 &amp; n.20; <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">see</SPAN> S. Rep. No. 92-1125, 
at 12-13 (1972); H.R. Rep. No. 92-1441, at 10-11 (1972), <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">reprinted
in</SPAN> 1972 U.S.C.C.A.N. 4698, 4707-08.  The pertinent section of the
amended statute provides as follows:</P>

<P>		[C]ompensation shall be payable under this chapter
in respect of disability or death of an employee,
but only if the disability or death results from an
injury occurring upon the navigable waters of the
United States (including any adjoining pier, wharf,
dry dock, terminal, building way, marine railway,
or other adjoining area customarily used by an
employer in loading, unloading, repairing,
dismantling, or building a vessel).</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>33 U.S.C. § 903(a).</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Among the other changes effected by the 1972 Amendments was
the addition of a requirement that the injured employee be engaged
in maritime employment.  <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">See</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Caputo</SPAN>, 432 U.S. at 263-64 &amp; n.21; 33
U.S.C. § 902(3).  Previously, a worker generally was entitled to
compensation so long as his injury occurred on navigable waters,
without regard to whether his particular job was maritime in
nature.  <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Caputo</SPAN>, 432 U.S. at 263-64.  Eligibility for coverage
under the LHWCA is thus now subject to both a "status" test and a
"situs" test.  Cunningham's status as a maritime worker is
uncontested, and we therefore must address only whether the "situs"
of his employment - the EBMF - falls within the statutory
definition.  Because Cunningham's injury occurred neither on a
navigable waterway nor on any of the specific sites listed in
section 903(a), the issue is whether the EBMF constitutes an "other
adjoining area" under the statute.</P>

<P>	As noted earlier, the EBMF is several miles from BIW's main
shipyard, which is located on the Kennebec River in Bath.  The pipe
and tin shops housed at the EBMF originally were located at the
main shipyard and were moved in 1990 because more space was needed 
for them to operate efficiently.  The work done at the EBMF is
fully integrated into BIW's shipbuilding process; since 1995, the
company has utilized a "just-in-time" system in which components 
are prefabricated in East Brunswick and delivered to Bath just
before they are needed for installation in the ships.</P>

<P>	The EBMF is one of five BIW facilities concentrated in the
same area of East Brunswick.  The complex of BIW buildings
dominates the eastern portion of Brunswick, accounting for more
acres and more employees than other land users.  Other maritime
businesses are located in East Brunswick, including a marina and
propeller shop, but the area between the Bath shipyard and BIW's
East Brunswick complex is not predominantly maritime in character. 
Based on a review of maps, photographs and testimony, the Board
reported that the area contains restaurants, motels, convenience
stores, gas stations, residences and other non-maritime uses.</P>

<P>	Although removed by several miles from the Kennebec River, the
EBMF does have proximity to salt water, at least some of which
indisputably is navigable.  At its closest point, the EBMF property
is about 1,400 feet from the navigable New Meadows River, an inlet
of Casco Bay.  The property also is crossed by a body of water
identified as Thompson Brook by BIW and described as a tidal
saltwater marsh by petitioner.  The parties debate whether that
waterway is navigable within the meaning of the LHWCA.</P>

<P>	After examining a variety of factors - including the
geography, tidal activity and history of the area, as well as the
relationship between BIW's main shipyard and the East Brunswick
site - the ALJ concluded that the EBMF is neither literally
contiguous to navigable waters nor otherwise an "adjoining area"
within the meaning of section 903(a).  The ALJ rejected
petitioner's contention that Thompson Brook is navigable, finding,
among other factors, that the waterway does not meet the
requirement that it either be currently used for commercial
purposes or reasonably capable of future commercial use.  In
evaluating whether the EBMF is an "adjoining area" in relation to
the New Meadows River, the ALJ utilized a test set out by the Ninth
Circuit in <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Brady-Hamilton Stevedore Co.</SPAN> v. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Herron</SPAN>, 568 F.2d 137,
141 (9th Cir. 1978), that focuses on the "functional relationship"
between the workplace and navigable waters.  <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">See</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">also</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Texports
Stevedore Co.</SPAN> v. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Winchester</SPAN>, 632 F.2d 504, 513-14 (5th Cir. 1980)
(en banc); <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">but</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">see</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Sidwell</SPAN> v. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Express Container Servs., Inc.</SPAN>, 71
F.3d 1134, 1138-39 (4th Cir. 1995).<A HREF="#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  The ALJ found that no
functional connection existed between the maritime work done at the
facility and the New Meadows River, and thus that the EBMF was not
covered as an extension of that waterway.  The ALJ did not address
the question whether the EBMF was an area adjoining the BIW
shipyard on the Kennebec.</P>

<P>	The Board largely agreed with the ALJ's findings, which it
deemed supported by substantial evidence and consistent with the
relevant case law.  Although the ALJ did not explicitly consider
the nexus between the EBMF and the Kennebec River, the Board's
examination of the undisputed facts and the judge's subsidiary
findings led it to conclude as a matter of law that the EBMF "is
not within the perimeter of a general maritime area around the
Kennebec River or the main shipyard."  </P>

<P>	Petitioner Cunningham asserts that the ALJ and Board decisions
were infected by numerous factual and legal errors, including
misinterpretation of the <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Herron</SPAN> "functional relationship" test,
neglect of a statutory presumption in favor of coverage, and lack
of record support for the finding that the salt marsh - the body of
water called Thompson Brook by the ALJ and the Board<A HREF="#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> - was not,
and could not be made, navigable.</P>

<P>	We review the Board's rulings of law de novo and otherwise
examine its decision to determine if it adhered to the "substantial
evidence" standard in reviewing the ALJ's factual findings.  <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Bath
Iron Works</SPAN> v. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Director, Office of Workers' Comp. Programs</SPAN>, 244 F.3d
222, 226 (lst Cir. 2001); <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Prolerized New England Co.</SPAN> v. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Benefits
Review Bd.</SPAN>, 637 F.2d 30, 35-36 (lst Cir. 1980). </P>

<P><CENTER>II. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Discussion</SPAN></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	We dispose preliminarily of petitioner's contention that we
must view this case with a bias in favor of coverage, pursuant to
33 U.S.C. § 920(a).  Section 920(a) states a presumption that "the
claim comes within the provisions of this chapter" if there is no
"substantial evidence to the contrary."  In <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Stockman</SPAN> v. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">John T.
Clark &amp; Son of Boston, Inc.</SPAN>, 539 F.2d 264, 269 (lst Cir. 1976), we
held that this provision does not govern general interpretation of
the situs requirement.  Like <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Stockman</SPAN>, this case requires us to
address "'general propositions or methods of approach,'" <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">id.</SPAN> at 270
(citation omitted), for determining when a workplace may be
classified as an "adjoining" area.  How these standards, in turn,
apply to the largely undisputed facts also requires legal judgments
about the statute's scope that we conclude are not subject to the
presumption.  <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Cf.</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Pittston Stevedoring Corp.</SPAN> v. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Dellaventura</SPAN>, 544
F.2d 35, 48 (2d Cir. 1976), <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">aff'd sub nom.</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Northeast Marine
Terminal Co.</SPAN> v. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Caputo</SPAN>, 432 U.S. 249 (1977) ("[T]he very fact that
the presumption can be overcome by substantial contrary evidence
indicates its inapplicability to an interpretive question of
general import . . . .").   </P>

<P>	We thus turn to the substantive question before us: whether
the EBMF is an "adjoining area" under section 903(a), entitling
employees working there to the LHWCA's disability coverage.  We are
mindful that Congress intended through this provision to extend the
statute's reach to employees performing maritime work away from the
water's edge and that the broad language of the 1972 Amendments
"suggests that we should take an expansive view of the extended
coverage," <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Caputo</SPAN>, 432 U.S. at 268; <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">see</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">also</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Perini North River
Assocs.</SPAN>, 459 U.S. at 315-16.</P>

<P>	This court has not yet articulated a standard methodology for
approaching the question of "adjoining area."<A HREF="#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  As noted earlier,
however, other circuits have adopted varied approaches in
evaluating whether a given workplace qualifies as an "adjoining
area" under the statute.  Both the Ninth Circuit in <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Herron</SPAN>, 568
F.2d at 137, and the Fifth Circuit in <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Winchester</SPAN>, 632 F.2d at 504,
view that phrase to describe "a functional relationship that does
not in all cases depend upon physical contiguity," <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Herron</SPAN>, 568 F.2d
at 141.  A court assessing the relationship must instead balance
all relevant circumstances.  The Ninth Circuit listed several
factors that, among others, it believed should be considered in
determining whether a site is "adjoining": </P>

<P>	the particular suitability of the site for the maritime
uses referred to in the statute; whether adjoining
properties are devoted primarily to uses in maritime
commerce; the proximity of the site to the waterway; and
whether the site is as close to the waterway as is
feasible given all of the circumstances in the case.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Herron</SPAN>, 568 F.2d at 141.<A HREF="#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></P>

<P>	The Fourth Circuit, meanwhile, adheres to a literal reading of
the statute.  In <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Sidwell</SPAN>, the court concluded that even general
geographical proximity to navigable waters was insufficient to
qualify an area as "adjoining," holding that the area must be
either "'contiguous with'" or otherwise "'touch[]' such waters." 
<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">See</SPAN> 71 F.3d at 1138-39.  If the area in question is separated from
the navigable waters by other areas, the Fourth Circuit stated, it
"simply is not 'adjoining' the waters under any reasonable
definition of that term."  <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Id.</SPAN> at 1139; <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">see</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">also</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Jonathan Corp.</SPAN> v.
<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Brickhouse</SPAN>, 142 F.3d 217, 220-22 (4th Cir. 1998).</P>

<P>	Both the ALJ and Board took the broader view espoused by the
Ninth and Fifth circuits, but nonetheless concluded that the EBMF
was not an adjoining area.  Cunningham unsurprisingly endorses the
"functional relationship" test but asserts that, in applying it,
the ALJ failed to weigh all the relevant factors, instead treating
the three-to-four-mile distance between the EBMF and the Bath
shipyard as dispositive.  The ALJ further erred, Cunningham
contends, by limiting himself to examining the EBMF's connection to
a single body of water; in Cunningham's view, a strong functional
relationship with one navigable waterway may be combined in the
calculus of factors with the facility's proximity to another
navigable waterway.</P>

<P>	Thus, Cunningham asserts that the EBMF qualifies in two ways
for LHWCA coverage.  First, he contends that the strength of the
functional relationship between BIW's main shipyard in Bath and the
EBMF outweighs any proximity issue with respect to the navigable
Kennebec River.  Alternatively, if the Kennebec is deemed to be too
far for the EBMF to "adjoin" it, the facility's strong functional
relationship with the Bath shipyard, combined with its proximity to
the New Meadows River or Thompson Brook, also balances out in favor
of coverage.  The latter approach implicates Cunningham's claim
that the ALJ erred in finding that Thompson Brook is not navigable;
he attributes that mistake to the judge's use of the more limited
admiralty definition of "navigable," rather than the broader
definition applicable to Commerce Clause claims.</P>

<P>	Because the ALJ and Board both used the functional
relationship test, which provides greater flexibility for a
claimant such as Cunningham, and we nevertheless agree with the
determination that LHWCA coverage is foreclosed in this case, we 
assume, without deciding, that the <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Herron</SPAN> functional approach is
correct.</P>

<P>	Applying this functional test, we first confront whether the
EBMF is an "adjoining area" in relation to the Bath shipyard and
the Kennebec.  Our review, of course, is limited to any lingering
legal issues and considering whether the Board properly evaluated
the ALJ's rulings under the substantial evidence test.  The
Director of the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs argues
that the Board's decision should be vacated and the case remanded
to the ALJ because the Board improperly concluded, as a matter of
law, that the distance between the EBMF and the Kennebec River
foreclosed a finding that the EBMF was an adjoining area.<A HREF="#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  The ALJ
never considered the EBMF's relationship to the Kennebec
riverfront, and the Director asserts that the ALJ - the designated
factfinder - must be given the opportunity to consider in the first
instance all relevant circumstances.<A HREF="#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></P>

<P>	We agree with the Board majority that, in light of the 
undisputed facts and the factual determinations that the ALJ did
make, a remand is unnecessary.  Moreover, contrary to Cunningham's
assertion, the Board did not base its decision simply on the
mileage between the Kennebec River and the EBMF, a rationale that
we agree would be insufficient under the test we are applying.<A HREF="#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  
The Board carefully reviewed the multiple factors of the <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Herron</SPAN>
test and concluded that the nature of the area between the EBMF and
the Kennebec waterfront, in addition to the lack of proximity,
compelled the conclusion that the EBMF was outside the perimeter of
an "adjoining area" within the meaning of section 903(a).<A HREF="#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></P>

<P>	We find neither legal nor factual error in that conclusion. 
Although the functional, "just-in-time" relationship between the
two locations could hardly be stronger, the key fact is that they
are quite clearly two separate locations.  Even if, as the Board
assumed, East Brunswick was the closest available location for
relocating the pipefitting work, it cannot reasonably be viewed as
an "adjoining" extension of the shipyard.  Rather than sharing an
"area" or neighborhood with the main facility, the EBMF is part of
a second campus for the shipyard's maritime activities.  This is
not a matter of mileage.  We could imagine a sprawling complex that
spans one or more public roadways and incorporates some non-maritime uses, but still would qualify as a single continuous
extension of the shore.  Here, however, the shipyard and the East
Brunswick complex are two separate maritime enclaves separated by
a large area of mostly unrelated business and residential
properties.  <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">See</SPAN>  <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Brown</SPAN> v. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BIW Corp.</SPAN>, 22 BRBS 384 (1989), 1989 WL
245312, *3 (reversing the ALJ after concluding that BIW's Hardings
facility, located in the same cluster of buildings as the EBMF, was
not an "other adjoining area" under section 903(a), noting that
"[t]he administrative law judge placed too much emphasis upon the
functional relationship between the Hardings facility and
employer's shipyard").   </P>

<P>	Petitioner has pointed to no case with such an extended view
of the concept of "adjoining."  We agree that there is no logical
basis for distinguishing between the maritime employees at the main
shipyard and the similarly occupied employees at the EBMF.  Both
are engaged in primary maritime activity directly relevant to the
shipyard, and both sets of employees thus have the same <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">functional</SPAN>
relationship to the navigable waters of the Kennebec.  But despite
this equivalence, and despite the Supreme Court's admonition to
broadly construe the 1972 Amendments, we are not at liberty to
ignore entirely the concept of  "adjoining."  The Supreme Court has
confirmed that the "status" and "situs" requirements are separate,
<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">see</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Perini North River Assocs.</SPAN>, 459 U.S. at 324 n.32 ("[T]he status
requirement is occupational and the situs test is geographic."),
and we may not "blur together requirements Congress intended to be
distinct," <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Herb's Welding, Inc.</SPAN> v. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Gray</SPAN>, 470 U.S. 414, 426 (1985). 
We thus find no legal error in the Board's conclusion that no
matter how much maritime activity takes place at the EBMF, and how
many additional BIW buildings surround it, the substantial expanse
of unrelated land uses between the main shipyard and East Brunswick
forecloses a finding that the one "adjoins" the other.<A HREF="#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></P>

<P>	In so concluding, we emphasize that we are not employing the
Fourth Circuit's strict "adjoining" standard or holding that <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">all</SPAN>
intervening property must be maritime in nature.  Under the
functional approach, public roadways or other non-maritime uses
that separate the subject workplace from the waterfront will not
disqualify the facility from LHWCA coverage.  <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">See</SPAN>, <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">e.g.</SPAN>, 
<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Winchester</SPAN>, 632 F.2d at 513 ("We reject the position that the
presence or absence of nonmaritime buildings between the point of
injury and the water is an absolute test for whether an injury is
covered under the LHWA.").  The suitability of the site for
maritime use and the unavailability of sites closer to the
waterfront are significant considerations, and both factors
arguably support petitioner here.  Nonetheless, even under the
flexible <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Herron</SPAN> test, for an area to "adjoin" navigable waters,
there must be at least some sense of a largely continuous
neighborhood of maritime uses, some shape of a perimeter - perhaps
broken in spots or irregular in form - that extends out from the
water's edge.   <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">See</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Winchester</SPAN>, 632 F.2d at 514, <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">quoted in</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Sisson</SPAN>
v. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Davis &amp; Sons, Inc.</SPAN>, 131 F.3d 555, 557 (5th Cir. 1998) (a
workplace can be said to adjoin navigable waters "so long as the
site is close to or in the vicinity of navigable waters, or in a
neighboring area").</P>

<P>	The Director argues that the concept should embrace a facility
that is "functionally part of the shipyard, provided a sufficient
geographic nexus exists between the facility and navigable waters." 
Whether or not a statutory amendment to this effect would improve
matters, our view is that it is too much of a stretch for
"adjoining" to make.  Beyond question, substantial evidence
supports the ALJ's implicit finding - and the Board's explicit one
- that the necessary geographical connection does not exist between
the EBMF and the Kennebec.</P>

<P>	As the Board noted, Cunningham argues that the geographic
shortcomings between the EBMF and the Kennebec River can be
overcome in the functional analysis because the EBMF is near both
the New Meadows River and Thompson Brook, the latter of which
actually crosses the EBMF property.  Cunningham asserts that both
of these waterways are navigable and that their proximity to his
workplace, together with the EBMF's functional connection with the
Kennebec, qualifies him for coverage under the LHWCA.  All three
members of the panel agree that this argument is flawed for 
reasons fully explained by the ALJ and Board, although two members
believe an alternative route to the same outcome is supported by
the statutory history and precedent.  <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">See</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">infra</SPAN> n.17. </P>

<P>	What is undisputed among the panel members is that substantial
evidence supports the ALJ's and Board's determination that Thompson
Brook is not navigable and, thus, that its adjacency to the EBMF
property can play no role in the <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Herron</SPAN> functional analysis.  The
ALJ and Board correctly determined that the applicable definition
of "navigable" derives from admiralty law, <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">see</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">generally</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Victory

<P>	The ALJ thoroughly reviewed the voluminous evidence submitted
on the issue of Thompson Brook's navigability, and the Board in
turn endorsed the ALJ's finding of non-navigability based on ample
evidence that the waterway is neither presently used for commercial
purposes nor adaptable for future commercial use.   We see no need
to repeat here Cunningham's factual contentions, as our review is
limited to ascertaining whether the Board properly applied the
substantial evidence test to the ALJ's findings.   As the Board
noted, the evidence concerning Thompson Brook's physical features
("a narrow, shallow channel of water with many sharp meandering
turns"), its lack of current commercial usage, and its location in
a "Resource Protection Zone" all point to the reasonableness of the
ALJ's conclusion.  The Board, additionally, credited the ALJ's
finding that Thompson Brook may not be considered an extension of
the navigable New Meadows River, and it rejected appellant's
contention that Thompson Brook should be deemed navigable based on
tidal activity.  We find no flaw in these judgments.<A HREF="#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>  Thus, the
EBMF may not qualify as an adjoining area based on its proximity to
Thompson Brook.</P>

<P>	The argument that the functional relationship between the EBMF
and the Kennebec can be supplemented by the geographic proximity of
the New Meadows River, which is indisputably navigable, also
founders.  The full panel agrees that the <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Herron</SPAN> analysis does not
anticipate aggregating a facility's solely functional relationship
with one waterway and its solely geographic proximity to another
non-contiguous waterway.  Here, the Board endorsed the ALJ's
determination that no functional relationship exists between the
EBMF and the New Meadows River, and we find no error in that
conclusion.  The Board relied heavily on the ALJ's finding that, in
the Board's words, "EBMF's proximity to the New Meadows River is
irrelevant" because "the evidence establishes that employer does
not own the intervening property or use the River for any reason."</P>

<P>	A workplace that fails the situs test because it is too
distant from the navigable water with which it has a functional
link is missing a critical element of the calculus; to fill that
proximity gap with a second, incidental body of water would extend
LHWCA coverage to a much wider range of locations.  At least where
the second waterway has no functional connection with the
employer's maritime activities, we find neither precedent nor logic
to support such an extension of the concept of "adjoining area."<A HREF="#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> 
The Board reached the same conclusion, noting that, under <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Herron</SPAN>
and <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Winchester</SPAN>, "the site in question must have both a geographic
and functional nexus with the same body of water."<A HREF="#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A></P>

<P> 	Whether the EBMF's relationship with the New Meadows River
may, on its own, establish situs under the <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Herron</SPAN> analysis is a
separate question and one to which we now turn.  At its closest
point, the New Meadows is 1,400 feet from the EBMF property, a
distance from navigable waters that reasonably could support a
finding of situs if other factors were similarly favorable.  Even
if the ALJ's findings against petitioner on other of the <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Herron</SPAN>
factors are debatable,<A HREF="#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> however, the lack of a functional link
between the EBMF and the New Meadows River overshadows their
impact.  As the Board noted, "[the] employer, indisputably, does
not use the New Meadows River, and thus, that waterway cannot
define an area with a functional use related to it."</P>

<P>	Because petitioner has failed to establish that the EBMF
satisfies the situs requirement in relation to any of the three
waterways at issue, he is not entitled to benefits under the LHWCA.</P>

conclusion that the EBMF's location was not particularly suited to
maritime uses because the prefabrication of pipe systems need not
"be performed on or near the water or at a maritime site," <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">id.</SPAN>
<P><A NAME="N_10_">10. </A> The interpretation of "other adjoining area" set forth in

<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guidelines for Determination of Coverage of Claims Under Amended
Longshoremen's Act</SPAN> (August 5, 1977) ("Guidelines"), is consistent
with this analysis.  The memorandum describes the relevant "area"
as "the entire, overall facility devoted to covered activities." 
The memorandum continues:</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	[I]t does not defeat coverage of a shipbuilder's injury

occurred (generally a shipyard) adjoins the water.  The
relevant "area," in short, is the entire maritime
facility involved . . . . [S]uch shipyard areas should be

<P>Guidelines, at 13-14 (emphasis in original; footnotes omitted).</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	In our view, the memorandum allows for intervening non-maritime uses outside the perimeter of the main area, but
contemplates only such minor interruptions as a fence or adjacent
public roads. 	 
<P><A NAME="N_11_">11. </A> Cunningham argues that Congress must have enacted the LHWCA
under its commerce powers, rather than as an exercise of its power
under the maritime clause of the Constitution, and that the 
broader definition of "navigable" applicable to Commerce Clause
cases thus must be used in this context.  This assertion is faulty. 
In <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Victory Carriers</SPAN>, issued before the 1972 Amendments to the
LHWCA, the Supreme Court noted that Congress had "ample power under
Arts. I and III of the Constitution to enact a suitable solution"
if it felt that "denying federal remedies to longshoremen injured
on land is intolerable," 404 U.S. at 216.  The cases cited in
support of that statement make it clear that the Court was
referring to Congress's admiralty power.  <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">See</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">id.</SPAN> at n.16; <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">see</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">also</SPAN>
<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">id.</SPAN> at 222-223 (Appendix to Opinion of Douglas, J., dissenting)
(noting that the Court had "clearly acknowledged that Congress'
constitutional maritime power does not cease at the shoreline. . .
.").</P>

<P>	Although admiralty jurisdiction in tort has traditionally been
limited to torts that took place on navigable waters, admiralty
contract jurisdiction "'extends over all contracts, (wheresoever
they may be made or executed . . .) which relate to the navigation,
business or commerce of the sea,'" <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Johnson</SPAN>, 396 U.S. at 215 n.7 
(citation omitted).  Because workers' compensation coverage
embraces both tort and contract elements, "Congress need not have
tested coverage by locality alone."  <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Id.</SPAN>  Thus, "Congress might
have extended coverage to all longshoremen by exercising its power
over maritime contracts."  <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Id.</SPAN> at 215.</P>

<P>	We think it evident that in the 1972 Amendments, Congress did
exactly what these cases said it had the power to do, namely, used
its constitutional maritime authority to extend LHWCA coverage to
additional land-based maritime employees who met both the status
and situs tests.  Cunningham's contention that the non-exclusive
nature of LHWCA relief proves that the statute must be supported by
the commerce power is simply incorrect.  State regulation may
supplement federal maritime law so long as it is "consistent with
federal maritime principles and policies."  <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Yamaha Motor Corp., USA</SPAN>
v. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Calhoun</SPAN>, 516 U.S. 199, 214-15 &amp; n.13 (1996).    
<P><A NAME="N_12_">12. </A> In defining navigable waters for purposes of admiralty
jurisdiction, the Court in <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">The Robert W. Parsons</SPAN> relied in part on
the widely quoted definition given in <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">The Daniel Ball</SPAN>, 77 U.S. (10
Wall.) 557, 563 (1870), which addressed Congress's commerce power
over navigable waters:</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Those rivers must be regarded as public navigable rivers
in law which are navigable in fact.  And they are
navigable in fact when they are used, or are susceptible
of being used, in their ordinary condition, as highways
for commerce, over which trade and travel are or may be
conducted in the customary modes of trade and travel on
water.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>This definition appeared in early cases involving both the commerce
clause power and admiralty jurisdiction, reflecting an assumption
that their scope was coextensive.  <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Adams</SPAN> v. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Montana Power Co.</SPAN>, 528
F.2d 437, 440 (9th Cir. 1975).  The Supreme Court subsequently
clarified that these were two independent sources of power, <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">see</SPAN>,
<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">e.g.</SPAN>, <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">In re Garnett</SPAN>, 141 U.S. 1, 15 (1891), but, as reflected in
<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">The Robert W. Parsons</SPAN>, accepted the "navigable in fact" test as
applicable to admiralty jurisdiction.
<P><A NAME="N_13_">13. </A> The ALJ found that Thompson Brook is not affected by tidal
activity where the brook flows across BIW's property, relying
primarily on maps and a survey conducted by an independent
consulting firm.  The survey was the subject of testimony by BIW's
expert, David Kamila, a civil engineer and land use consultant, who
also made personal observations of the site.  When asked what the
survey numbers indicated about the tidal effect on the relevant
section of Thompson Brook, Kamila testified that the "numbers tell
you that it's above the mean tide for sure."  Because the survey
showed that the lowest elevation of Thompson Brook's channel in the
relevant area was 1.55 feet higher than the average high tide at
the brook's mouth (10.9 feet vs. 9.35 feet), and because "the
height of the tide diminishes as it travels north," the ALJ
understood Kamila to state that the BIW property was beyond tidal
influence.  The ALJ thus had ample factual support for his finding.</P>

<P>	The Board, citing <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">The Robert W. Parsons</SPAN> and <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">George</SPAN>, stated
that "the tidal fluctuations of Thompson Brook are irrelevant" in
determining navigability.  <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">See</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">The Robert W. Parsons</SPAN>, 191 U.S. at
26 (it is "not the ebb and flow of the tide, but the actual
navigability of the waters" that is the test of jurisdiction);
<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">George</SPAN>, 1997 WL 573753, at *7 ("[T]he ebb-and-flow test [has] been

here.
<P><A NAME="N_14_">14. </A> We note that, when a work location has some functional link
with two reasonably proximate waterways, it may be appropriate to
look at the <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Herron</SPAN> factors relating to each of them in combination. 
This is not that case, and we do not decide the issue here.   
<P><A NAME="N_15_">15. </A> Although one Board member wrote a separate concurring and
dissenting opinion, he joined the majority on this point.
<P><A NAME="N_16_">16. </A> As noted earlier, it is at least arguable that the EBMF

<P><A NAME="N_17_">17. </A> Although it is not a basis for decision in this case, two
members of the panel believe that the lack of a functional link
between the EBMF and Thompson Brook may well be the most pertinent
rationale for rejecting situs based on their relationship.  In
their view, section 903(a) implicitly provides that an "adjoining
area" covered by the statute must qualify based on its relationship
to the navigable water upon which the employer's maritime activity
takes place.  In other words, situs analysis and the <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Herron</SPAN> test
would come into play only in relation to a body of navigable water
on which the employer conducts its primary maritime business.  In
this case, that would be only the Kennebec River.</P>

<P>	The third panel member disagrees both with the propriety of
the raising of the theory and with the substance of it.  This
member believes that a workplace that is literally contiguous to
navigable waters is by definition an "adjoining" area under section
903(a); thus, if Thompson Brook were navigable, the EBMF would meet
the LHWCA's situs requirement.</P>

<P>	In the majority's view, Congress's passage of the 1972
Amendments was a deliberate "march from the sea landward," <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Triguero</SPAN>
v. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Consolidated Rail Corp.</SPAN>, 932 F.2d 95, 100, ruling out situs

its fortuitous location near another navigable waterway, <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">see</SPAN>
<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Brickhouse</SPAN>, 142 F.3d at 222.  Such a construction would render
unnecessary any probing of the navigability of an incidental body
