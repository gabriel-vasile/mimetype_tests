<P><b><a name="statement">I. STATEMENT OF GOALS AND PURPOSES</a></b></P>

<P>The Department of Justice asset forfeiture program has three
primary goals: (1) to punish and deter criminal activity by
depriving criminals of property used or acquired through illegal
activities; (2) to enhance cooperation among foreign, federal,
state and local law enforcement agencies through the equitable
sharing of assets recovered through this program: and, as a byproduct, (3) to produce revenues to enhance forfeitures and
strengthen law enforcement.</P>

<P>To meet these goals it is essential that the program be
administered in a fiscally responsible manner which will minimize
the costs incurred by the United States while maximizing the
impact on criminal enterprises. Moreover, the integrity of the
entire forfeiture program depends upon the faithful stewardship
of forfeited property and the proceeds thereof.</P>


<P>The Law Enforcement Coordinating Committees shall promote and
facilitate the Department of Justice forfeiture program with 

federal, state and loca1 law enforcement agencies.</P>

<P>These Guidelines are not intended to create or confer any rights,
privileges or benefits on prospective or actual claimants,
defendants or petitioners. Likewise, they are not intended to
have the force of law. <U>See</U>, <U>United States </U>v. <U>Caceres</U>, 440 U.S.
§471 (1979).</P>

<p><br><p>

 
<p><b><a name="definitions">II. DEFINITIONS</a></b></P>


<P>A. <U>Adoptive Seizure</U> refers to the federal adoption and forfeiture
of property seized exclusively through the efforts of state or
local agencies. Investigative bureaus empowered by statute or
regulation may adopt such seized property for forfeiture where
the conduct giving rise to the seizure is in violation of federal
law. Forfeitures of seized property accepted in this manner have
the same effect as if the property had originally been seized by
the investigative bureau.</P>


<P>B. <U>Appraised Value</U> means the estimated fair market value at the
time of seizure of the same or similar property. For vehicles,
this will generally mean the average wholesale value in the
N.A.D.A. Appraisal Guides. For personal property, this will
generally mean estimated fair market value. For real property,
businesses and certain personn1 property, the value shall be
determined by experts qualified to make such determinations.</P>


<P>C. <U>Cash</U> means currency, negotiable instruments or securities.</P>


<P>D. <U>Department component</U> refers to agencies, divisions, offices,
sections or units of the Department of Justice.</P>

Fund as established by 28 U.S.C. §524(c)(1).</P>


<P>G. <U>Investigative bureau</U> refers to Department of Justice agencies
authorized by federal statute to investigate and enforce
forfeiture statutes. These agencies are: the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the
Immigration and Naturalization Service. It also refers to other
federal agency investigative units whose forfeitures result in
deposits into the Fund (e.g., U.S. Postal Inspection Service,
Internal Revenue Service, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and 

Firearms).</P>


<P>H. <U>Joint investigation</U> means cases in which one or more foreign,
state or local agencies participates in an investigation with a
federal law enforcement agency empowered to forfeit property.</P>


<P>I. <U>Law enforcement</U> means the investigation or prosecution of
criminal activity and the execution of court orders arising from
such activity.</P>


<P>J. <U>Net proceeds</U> means the forfeited cash or gross receipts from
the sale of forfeited property less allowable asset management
and case related expenses, third party interests and any award
based on the value of the forfeiture.</P>


<P>K. <U>Official use</U> means utilization by a law enforcement agency in
the direct performance of law enforcement activities.</P>


<P>L. <U>Property</U> means tangible persona1 and real property, other than
cash, when used in the context of the equitable transfer of
property.</P>


<P>M. <U>Seized Asset Deposit Fund</U> refers to the holding account
administered by the U.S. Marshals Service for seized cash pending
resolution of forfeiture cases.</P>

<P>N. <U>Sharing</U> means the transfer of cash, property or proceeds
realized through federal forfeitures pursuant to these 

Guidelines.</P>


<P>O. <U>State and local agencies</U> refers to state and local law
enforcement agencies.</P>


<P>P. <U>Transfer</U> and "sharing" are synonymous under these Guidelines.</P>

<p><br><p>
<P><b><a name="general">III. GENERAL PROVISIONS</a></b></P>


<P>A. Whenever reference is made to a specific Department official,
such reference shall also be deemed to include any duly
authorized person acting for that official by law, regulation or
delegation. References to the Executive Office for Asset
Forfeiture include any successor organization.</P>

<P>B. Whenever a statute, regulation or official form cited in these
Guidelines is replaced by a substantially identical one, the
citation shall be deemed to refer to the replacement.</P>


<P>C. The Deputy Attorney General or his designee may issue
supplementary and interpretative guidance to address issues that
arise under these Guidelines. The Executive Office for Asset
Forfeiture, Office of the Deputy Attorney General, shall provide
assistance to the Deputy Attorney General in the oversight and
management of the Department~s forfeiture program.</P>

<p><br><p>
<P><b><a name="federal">IV. FEDERAL RETENTION AND USE OF FORFEITED PROPERTY</a></b></P>

<P><b><a name="authorization">A. General Authorization</a></b></P>


<P>The Attorney General has the authority to retain any civilly or
criminally forfeited property for official use by any federal
agency. No seized property shall be placed into official use
until a final determination of forfeiture has been made and the
request to place the property into official use has been approved
by the appropriate official.</P>


<P><b><a name="real">B. Real Property</a></b></P>


<P>The Attorney General does not delegate his authority to place
real property into official use. A department component may
request authority to place real property into official use only
if the proposed usage of that property would be and remain
thereafter consistent with a law enforcement purpose. Transfers
of real property to other federal components may be considered,
if such transfers will serve a significant and continuing federal
purpose.</P>


<P><b><a name="cash">C. Cash</a></b></P>


<P>No forfeited cash, nor any proceeds from the sale of forfeited
property, may be transferred to or retained by any federal agency
except as provided for in Chapter X or by statute.</P>


<P><b><a name="personal">D. Personal Property</a></b></P>

<P>The Attorney General delegates his authority to place personal
property into official use in the order of priority set forth
below. Written notice to the Director, Executive Office for Asset
Forfeiture is required at the time property valued at $50,000 or
greater is placed into official use. The Director, Executive
Office for Asset Forfeiture, shall determine which agency may
place property into official use if more than one Department
component seeks to retain the same forfeited property for
official use. All property should be promptly turned over to the
local U.S. Marshal after seizure, including property intended to
be placed into official use, unless it is intended that such
property will be used in an undercover capacity.</P>

<blockquote>
<P>1. <u>Seizing Investigative Bureau</u></P>


<P>The head of the seizing investigative bureau will determine
whether to place forfeited property into official use.</P>


<P>2. <u>Other Investigative Bureaus</u></P>


<P>If the property is not equitably transferred to a foreign, state
or local agency, and the seizing investigative bureau chooses not
to place the forfeited property into officia1 use, then another
investigative bureau or the U.S. Marshals Service may, by written
request to the Director, U.S. Marshals Service, seek the transfer
of the property for its use.</P>


<P>3. <u>Other Department Components</u></P>


<P>If no investigative bureau chooses to place the property into
official use and the property has not been equitably transferred,
other Department components may, by written request to the
Director, U.S. Marshals Service, seek the transfer of the
forfeited property for its official use.</P>


<P>4. <u>Transfer of Forfeited Property to Other Federal Agencies</u></P>


<P>All requests by other <EM>federal</EM> agencies shall be referred to the
Director, U.S. Marshals Service. In exceptional circumstances,
the U.S. Marshals Service may transfer personal property suitable
for official use to a requesting federal agency which did not
participate in the acts which led to a seizure or forfeiture.</P>


<P>In all such cases, the U.S. Marshals Service shall consult with
the investigative bureau responsible, for the investigation which
led to the forfeiture. Careful consideration shall be given to
the value, of the property requested, its potential benefit to
the United States for law enforcement purposes and its impact on
the Fund.</P>


<P>A decision to grant a request for personal property with an
aggregate value of less than $25,000 shall be approved in writing
by the, Director, U.S. Marshals Service. The recipient agency
shall pay expenses incurred by the Department of Justice in
connection with the forfeiture and transfer of such property. A
report on all such transfers shall be prepared by the U.S.
Marshals Service on a quarterly basis and submitted to the
Executive Office for Asset Forfeiture.</P>


<P>A decision to grant a request for any property valued at $25,000
or more shall be approved in writing by the Director, Executive
Office for Asset Forfeiture. The recipient agency shall pay
expenses incurred by the Department of Justice in connection with
the forfeiture and transfer of such property.</P>

</blockquote>
<P><b><a name="investigative">E. Investigative Bureau and Department Component Official Use
Policies</a></b></P>


<P>Each investigative bureau and department component sha}1
promulgate internal guidelines consistent with these Guidelines
governing the placement of property into official use. Such
guidelines and any subsequent supplements or revisions shall be
filed with the Executive Office for Asset Forfeiture ten (10)
days in advance of issuance. </P>


<P>All official use guidelines shall:</P>

<blockquote>
<P>1. Prohibit the placement into official use of any seized
property prior to the entry of a final determination of
forfeiture and the appropriate approval of the request to place
the property into official use;</P>


<P>2. Require that all seized property be recorded and tracked in an
official inventory of seized property without regard to its
intended disposition;</P>


<P>3. Require that a written justification be prepared in each
instance detailing the reasons why the forfeited property was
placed into official use and that these justifications be
retained for three (3) years;</P>


<P>4. Require that a specific supervisory-level official be
responsible and accountable for the decision to place each item
of forfeited property into official use and for ensuring
appropriate official use of such property following its transfer;</P>


<P>5. Require that property placed into official use shall be
identified and tracked in an accountable property system; and</P>


<P>6. State that the property may not be transferred or retained if
it is primarily for purposes of trade or sale, or home-to-work
transportation or other uses not expressly authorized for
property acquired through the expenditure of appropriated funds.
There must be an intention to place the property into official
use for two (2) years.</P>

</blockquote>
<P><b><a name="competing">F. Competing Requests for Property for Official Use by
Investigative Bureau and Other Federal, State or Local Agency</a></b></P>


<P>When the head of an investigative bureau seeks to place forfeited
property into official use and a federal, state or local agency
has filed a request for an equitable share of that property, the
head of the investigative bureau shall consider the following
factors in making a determination regarding the disposition of
the property:</P>

<blockquote>
<P>1. The relative need of the requesting agency and the
investigative bureau for the particular property;</P>


<P>2. The uniqueness of the property and the likelihood of securing
similar property through seizures in the near future;</P>


<P>3. The relative percentage of the requesting agency's
participation in the cases in addition to the other factors
pertinent to the determination of equitable transfer;</P>


<P>4. The likelihood that the requesting agency will be eligible for
an equitable share of property from additional seizures arising
from the same investigation or from seizures in other cases in 

the near future;</P>

<P>5. The impact that a decision to place the property into official
use might have on federal, state and local relations in the
district; and</P>


<P>6. The number and value of past equitable transfers to the
federal, state or local agency.</P>

</blockquote>
<P><b><a name="payment">G. Payment of Liens on Personal Property Placed Into Federal
Official Use</a></b></P>


<P>Liens on personal property placed into official use by
investigative bureaus and the U.S. Marshals Service may be paid
from the Fund provided that:</P>

<blockquote>
<P>1. There is an intent to place the property into official use for
at least two (2) years;</P>


<P>2. The total amount to be paid from the Fund amounts to less than
one-third the appraised value of the property; and,</P>

<P>3. The total amount to be paid from the Fund is less than
$25,000.</P>

</blockquote>
<P>Requests for exceptions may be submitted in writing to the
Director, Executive Office for Asset Forfeiture.</P>

<p><br><p>
<P><b><a name="equitable">V. EQUITABLE TRANSFER OF FORFEITED PROPERTY TO PARTICIPATING 
STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES</a></b></P>


<P>Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. §881(e)(1) and 19 U.S.C. §1616a, as made
applicable by 21 U.S.C. §881(d) and other statutes, the Attorney
Genera1 has the authority to equitably transfer forfeited
property and cash to state and local agencies that directly
participate in the law enforcement effort leading to the seizure
and forfeiture of the property. Requests for equitable transfers
shall be filed in the form prescribed by the Director, Executive
Office for Asset Forfeiture.</P>


<P><b><a name="transfers">A. Equitable Transfers Generally</a></b></P>

<blockquote>
<P>1. All equitable shares shall be based on the net proceeds of the
forfeiture.</P>

<P>2. State and local investigative and prosecutive agencies may
share in forfeited cash and property and the proceeds from the
sale of forfeited property.</P>


<P>3. All property transferred to state and local agencies and any
income generated by this property shall be used for the law
enforcement purposes specified in the request.</P>


<P>4. A state or local agency may file a request for an equitable
share of cash or property where it can demonstrate that it
participated directly in the law enforcement effort that resulted
in the forfeiture.</P>


<P>5. No request shall be considered if it is submitted after sixty
(60) days following the seizure.</P>


<P>6. Cash and property shall be equitably shared with a state or
local agency only where it will increase and not supplant law
enforcement resources of the specific state or local agency that
participated in the forfeiture.</P>


<P>7. The deciding official shall ensure that the share approved has 

value that bear a reasonable relationship to the degree of direct
participation of the state or local agency in the law enforcement
effort resulting in the forfeiture, taking into account the total
value of all property forfeited and the total law enforcement
effort with respect to the violation of law on which the
forfeiture is based.</P>

</blockquote>
<P><b><a name="factors">B. Factors Governing the Amount of the Equitable Transfer</a></b></P>


<P>The amount of equitable transfer of proceeds from the sale of
forfeited property shall be based upon the <EM>net</EM> proceeds realized
from the sale of the property or liquidation of negotiable
instruments. Equitable sharing amounts shall be calculated after
the determination of any award based upon the value of the
forfeiture. Asset management expenses may be	calculated on a <EM>pro
rata</EM> basis where expenses cannot reasonably be determined for a
specific asset.</P>

<P>In determining the amount of the equitable transfer for each
participating agency, the following factors shall be considered:</P>

<blockquote>
<P>1. Whether the seizure was adopted or was the result of a joint
investigation;</P>


<P>2. The degree of direct participation in the law enforcement
effort by the state or local agency resulting in the forfeiture,
taking into account the total value of all property forfeited and
total law enforcement effort, including any related criminal
prosecution with respect to the violation of law on which the
forfeiture is based (21 U.S.C. §881(e)(3));</P>


<P>3. Whether the state or local agency originated the information
that led to the seizure and whether the agency obtained such
information fortuitously or by use of its investigative
resources;</P>


<P>4. Whether the state or local agency provided unique or
indispensable assistance;</P>


<P>5. Whether the state or local agency initially identified the
asset(s) for seizure;</P>


<P>6. Whether the state or local agency seized other assets during
the course of the same investigation and whether such seizures
were made pursuant to state or local law; and,</P>


<P>7. Whether the state or local agency could have achieved
forfeiture under state law, with favorable consideration given to
an agency which could have forfeited the asset(s) on its own but
joined forces with the United States to make a more effective
investigation.</P>

</blockquote>
<P><b><a name="sharing">C. Sharing Percentages</a></b></P>

<blockquote>
<P>1. In cases involvinq adoptive seizures that are forfeited
administratively or in uncontested judicial proceedings, the
determining official shall allocate to the United States fifteen
(15) percent of the total net proceeds realized through the
disposition of forfeited property.</P>


<P>In cases involving adoptive seizures that are forfeited in
contested judicial proceedings, the determining official shall
allocate to the United States twenty (20) percent of the total
net proceeds realized through the disposition of the forfeited
property. These amounts represent the federal equitable share
based upon its effort in forfeiting the property.</P>

<P>These sharing percentages shall be applicable to property seized
on or after September 1, 1990.</P>


<P>2. In non-adoptive cases the determining official shall allocate
to the United States at least the applicable percentages set
forth in paragraph 1.</P>

<P>3. The United States' equitable share will normally be satisfied
by the allocation of one or more of the items forfeited (or a
portion of the proceeds thereof) to tbe United States.</P>


<P>In cases where only one asset or item is forfeited and a state or
local agency requests that asset in lieu of proceeds from the
disposition of the property, the determining official shall
ensure that the United States receives its costs and equitable
share to reflect total federal participation in the forfeiture
effort. If the requesting agency is unable to pay the costs and
federal share in such a one-asset forfeiture case, the property
shall be sold by the U.S. Marshals Service and the proceeds
distributed in accordance with these Guidelines.</P>


<P>Exceptions to this requirement may be granted by the deciding
official upon assurances that (1) the requesting state or local
agency lacks funds or authority to satisfy the United States'
equitable share and costs; and (2) the forfeited item will fill a
demonstrable need of the requesting agency. Such exceptions shall
be liberally granted where the two above showings are made.</P>


<P>4. Nothing in this section shall alter the ability of the U.S.
Marshals Service to pay appropriate expenses from the Fund or to
recover costs directly from participating agencies.</P>

</blockquote>
<P><b><a name="decision">D. Decision-Making Authority</a></b></P>


<P>Sharing decisions should be made during the period when
forfeiture proceedings are being conducted. Decision-making
authority shall be as follows:</P>

<blockquote>
<P>1. <u>Administrative Forfeitures Valued at Less than $1,000,000</u></P>


<P>The head of the seizing investigative bureau shall determine the
appropriate equitable transfer of assets forfeited in a single
administrative proceeding where the appraised value of the
asset(s) is less than $1,000,000.</P>

<P>2. <u>Judicial Forfeitures Valued Less Than $1,000,000</u></P>


<P>The United States Attorney shall determine the appropriate
equitable distribution of asset(s) forfeited in a single judicial
proceeding in his or her district where the appraised value of
the asset(s) is less than $1,000,000.</P>


<P>3. <u>Administrative and Judicial Forfeitures Valued at $l,000,000
or Greater and Multi-District Cases</u></P>


<P>In the case of a single administrative or judicial proceeding
where the appraised value of the asset(s) forfeited is $1,000,000
or more and in multi-district cases, the United States
Attorney(s) shall, after consultation with the investigative
bureau(s), forward his (their) evaluation(s) and
recommendation(s) to the Deputy Attorney General or his designee
for determination.</P>


<P>4. <u>Real Property Forfeitures</u></P>


<P>The Deputy Attorney General or his designee shall approve any
equitable transfer of real property. Where appropriate, any such
transfer shall include a provision for reversion of title to the
United States if the property is not used for the agreed upon
purposes.</P>

</blockquote>

<P><b><a name="sale">VI. SALE OF SEIZED AND FORFEITED PROPERTY</a></b></P>


<P><b><a name="seized">A. Pre-Forfeiture Sale of Seized Property</a></b></P>

<blockquote>
<P>1. Pre-forfeiture sale of property (i.e., interlocutory or
stipulated sale) is favored as a means of preserving asset value
and mitigating asset management expenses.</P>


<P>2. The United States Attorney shall consult with the
investigative bureau and the U.S. Marshals Service to determine
the status of any requests for equitable transfer or petitions
for remission or mitigation prior to seeking a pre-forfeiture
sale of property pending judicial forfeiture.</P>


<P>3. Proceeds from any pre-forfeiture sale shall be promptly
deposited into the Seized Asset Deposit Fund unless otherwise
ordered by the Court.</P>

</blockquote>
<P><b><a name="forfeited">B. Sale of Forfeited Property</a></b></P>

<blockquote>
<P>1. Upon the successful completion of the forfeiture action and if
the property is not placed into official use or transferred to a
federal, state, or local agency, it shall be promptly sold and
the proceeds of sale promptly deposited in the Fund.</P>


<P>2. Investigative bureaus and the United States Attorneys' offices
shall promptly notify the U.S. Marshals Service of all relevant
facts affecting the forfeited property. Relevant facts include,

remission of forfeiture;</P>


<P>b. Orders of transfers to federal, state and local agencies;</P>


<P>c. Orders of designation for official use by Department
components if known; and,</P>

<P><b><a name="department">VII. THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ASSETS FORFEITURE FUND</a></b></P>


<P><b><a name="administration">A. Administration of the Fund</a></b></P>

<blockquote>
<P>1. The Attorney General delegates the administration of the Fund
to the Director, U.S. Marshals Service under the supervision of
the Deputy Attorney General.</P>


<P>2. The U.S. Marshals Service shall prepare annual reports on the
Fund in accordance with 28 U.S.C. §524(c)(6).</P>


<P>3. Pursuant to these Guidelines, federal agencies reimbursed by
or contributing to the Fund, shall provide information necessary

statement reflecting the current status of the Fund to the
Director, Executive Office for Asset Forfeiture.</P>


<P>5. The U.S. Marshals Service shall prepare annual budget
estimates for the Fund based on information submitted by the
requesting agencies.</P>

</blockquote>
<P><b><a name="payments">B. Payments and Reimbursements</a></b></P>


<P>Payments and reimbursements are permitted in six (6) general
categories. In any fiscal year, reimbursement for program
management expenses and investigative expenses expressly
identifled in 28 U.S.C. §524(c)(l) shall not exceed the amount
specified in the annual appropriation limitation on the Fund. The
categories listed in order of priority are as follows:</P>

<blockquote>
<P>1. <u>Asset management expenses.</u> Asset management expenses are those
expenses that are incurred in connection with the seizure,
inventory, appraisal, packaging, movement, storage, maintenance,
security and disposition (including destruction) of the asset(s).</P>


<P>Asset management expenses include payments for contract services
and the employment of outside contractors to operate and manage
properties or provide other specialized services as necessary to
dispose of such properties. If the asset is an on-going business,
the normal and customary expenses of operating the business are
asset management expenses only to the extent they are not covered
by the income of the business.</P>

<P>2. <u>Case related expenses.</u> Case related expenses are those
expenses that are incurred in connection with normal proceedings
undertaken to perfect the United States' interest in seized
property through forfeiture. This includes fees and other costs
of advertising, translation, court and deposition reporting,
expert witness, courtroom exhibit services, employment of
attorneys or other specialists in state real estate law by the
U.S. Marshals Service, travel and subsistence related to a
specific proceeding, and other related items as approved by the
Director, Executive Office for Asset Forfeiture.</P>


<P>The Director, Executive Office for Asset Forfeiture, may approve
the expenses incurred in connection with retention of foreign
counsel to gain access to information needed to conduct pre-seizure planning on identified assets, to effect a seizure of
assets or to perfect title of forfeited property in a foreign
country.</P>


<P>3. <u>Payment of qualified third party interest.</u> Qualified third
party interests are those incurred in the payment of valid liens,
secured mortgages and debts owed to qualified general creditors
pursuant to court order or a favorable ruling on a petition for
remission or mitigation of the forfeiture. This includes the
restoration of the proceeds of sale pursuant to a court order or
an administrative determination. Nothing in this section shall
preclude a departmental component from seeking reimbursement from
the state or local agency that received the property that is the
basis of the claim.</P>


<P>4. <u>Equitable sharing payments.</u> Equitable sharing payments are
those payments which represent amounts paid directly to foreign
governments or agencies and state or local agencies. Pursuant to
21 U.S.C. §881(e)(3)(a), these amounts shall reflect the degree
of participation in the law enforcement effort resulting in the
forfeiture, taking into account the total value of all property
forfeited and the total law enforcement effort with respect to
