(a)     Any transfer after the ``effective date'' which is in violation of any provision of this chapter or of any regulation, ruling, instruction, license, or other direction or authorization thereunder and involves any property in which a designated national has or has had an interest since such ``effective date'' is null and void and shall not be the basis for the assertion or recognition of any interest in or right, remedy, power or privilege with respect to such property. 
(b)     No transfer before the ``effective date'' shall be the basis for the assertion or recognition of any right, remedy, power, or privilege with respect to, or interest in, any property in which a designated national has or has had an interest since the ``effective date'' unless the person with whom such property is held or maintained had written notice of the transfer or by any written evidence had recognized such transfer prior to such ``effective date.'' 
(c)     Unless otherwise provided, an appropriate license or other authorization issued by or pursuant to the direction or authorization of the Secretary of the Treasury before, during or after a transfer shall validate such transfer or render it enforceable to the same extent as it would be valid or enforceable but for the provisions of section 5(b) of the Trading With the Enemy Act, as amended, and this chapter and any ruling, order, regulation, direction or instruction issued thereunder. 
(d)     Transfers of property which otherwise would be null and void, or unenforceable, by virtue of the provisions of this section shall not be deemed to be null and void, or unenforceable pursuant to such provisions, as to any person with whom such property was held or maintained (and as to such person, only) in cases in which such person is able to establish each of the following:

(2)     The person with whom such property was held or maintained did not have reasonable cause to know or suspect, in view of all the facts and circumstances known or available to such person, that such transfer required a license or authorization by or pursuant to the provisions of this chapter and was not so licensed or authorized or if a license or authorization did purport to cover the transfer, that such license or authorization had been obtained by misrepresentation or the withholding of material facts or was otherwise fraudulently obtained; and 
(3)     Promptly upon discovery that: (i) Such transfer was in violation of the provisions of this chapter or any regulation, ruling, instruction, license or other direction or authorization thereunder, or 

(ii)    Such transfer was not licensed or authorized by the Secretary of the Treasury, or 
(iii)   If a license did purport to cover the transfer, such license had been obtained by misrepresentation or the withholding of material facts or was otherwise fraudulently obtained; the person with whom such property was held or maintained filed with the Treasury Department, Washington, DC 20220, a report in triplicate setting forth in full the circumstances relating to such transfer. The filing of a report in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph shall not be deemed to be compliance or evidence of compliance with paragraphs (d) (1) and (2) of this section. 
(e)     Unless licensed or authorized by 500.504 or otherwise licensed or authorized pursuant to this chapter any attachment, judgment, decree, lien, execution, garnishment, or other judicial process is null and void with respect to any property in which on or since the ``effective date'' there existed the interest of a designated foreign country or national thereof.

500.205  Holding of certain types of blocked property in interest-bearing accounts. (a)     Except as provided by paragraphs (d), (e) and (f) of this section, or as authorized by the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate by specific license, any person holding any property included in paragraph (h) of this section is prohibited from holding, withholding, using, transferring, engaging in any transactions involving, or exercising any right, power, or privilege with respect to any such property, unless it is held in an interest-bearing account in a domestic bank. 
(b)     Any person presently holding property subject to the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section which, as of the effective date of this section, is not being held in accordance with the provisions of that paragraph, shall transfer such property to or hold such property or cause such property to be held in an interest-bearing account in any domestic bank within 30 days of the effective date of this section. 
(c)     Any person holding any checks or drafts subject to the provisions of 500.201 is authorized and directed, wherever possible consistent with state law (except as otherwise specifically provided in paragraph c(3) of this section), to negotiate or present for collection or payment such instruments and credit the proceeds to interest-bearing accounts. Any transaction by any person incident to the negotiation, processing, presentment, collection or payment of such instruments and deposit of the proceeds into an interest-bearing account is hereby authorized: Provided, That: 

(1)     The transaction does not represent, directly or indirectly, a transfer of the interest of a designated national to any other country or person; 
(2)     The proceeds are held in a blocked account indicating the designated national who is the payee or owner of the instrument; and, 
(3)     In the case of a blocked check or draft which has been purchased by the maker/drawer from the drawee bank (e.g., cashier's check, money order, or traveler's check) or which is drawn against a presently existing account, such bank, on presentment of the instrument in accordance with the provisions of this section, shall either:

(i)     Pay the instrument (subject to paragraphs c (1) and (2) of this section) or (ii) credit a blocked account on its books with the amount payable on the instrument. In either event, the blocked account shall be identified as resulting from the proceeds of a blocked check or draft, and the identification shall include a reference to the names of both the maker and payee of the instrument. 

(d)     Property subject to the provisions of paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, held by a person claiming a set-off against such property, is exempt from the provisions of paragraphs (a), (b) and c of this section to the extent of the set-off: Provided however, That interest shall be due from 30 days after the effective date of this section if it should ultimately be determined that the claim to a set-off is without merit. 
(e)     Property subject to the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, held in a customer's account by a registered broker/dealer in securities, may continue to be held for the customer by the broker/dealer provided interest is credited to the account on any balance not invested in securities in accordance with 500.513. The interest paid on such accounts by a broker/dealer who does not elect to hold such property for a customer's account in a domestic bank shall not be less than the maximum rate payable on the shortest time deposit available in any domestic bank in the jurisdiction in which the broker/dealer holds the account. 
(f)     Property subject to the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, held by a state agency charged with the custody of abandoned or unclaimed property under 500.561 may continue to be held by the agency provided interest is credited to the blocked account in which the property is held by the agency, or the property is held by the agency in a blocked account in a domestic bank. The interest credited to such accounts by an agency which does not elect to hold such property in a domestic bank shall not be less than the maximum rate payable on the shortest time deposit available in any domestic bank in the state. 
(g)     For purposes of this section, the term ``interest-bearing account'' means a blocked account earning interest at no less than the maximum rate payable on the shortest time deposit in the domestic bank where the account is held, provided however, that such an account may include six-month Treasury bills or insured certificates, with a maturity not exceeding six-months, appropriate to the amounts involved. 
(h)     The following types of property are subject to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section: 

(1)     Any currency, bank deposit and bank accounts subject to the provisions of 500.201; (2)     Any property subject to the provisions of 500.201 which consists, in whole or in part, of undisputed and either liquidated or matured debts, claims, obligations or other evidence of indebtedness, to the extent of any amount that is undisputed and liquidated or matured; and, 
(3)     Any proceeds resulting from the payment of an obligation under paragraph c of this section. 

(i)     For purposes of this section, the term ``domestic bank'' includes any FSLIC-insured institution (as defined in 12 CFR 561.1). 
(j)     For the purposes of this section the term ``person'' includes the United States Government or any agency or instrumentality thereof, except where the agency or instrumentality submits to the Office of Foreign Assets Control an opinion of its General Counsel that either:

(1)     It lacks statutory authority to comply with this section, or (2) the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section are inconsistent with the statutory program under which it operates.

[44 FR 11766, Mar. 2, 1979] 

500.206   Exemption of information and informational materials.
(a)     The importation from any country and the exportation to any country of information or informational materials as defined in 500.332, whether commercial or otherwise, regardless of format or medium of transmission, are exempt from the prohibitions and regulations of this part.(b)     All transactions of common carriers incident to the importation or exportation of information or informational materials, including mail, between the United States and any foreign country designated under 500.201, are exempt from the prohibitions and regulations of this part.(c)     This section does not authorize transactions related to information or informational materials not fully created and in existence at the date of the transaction, or to the substantive or artistic alteration or enhancement of information or informational materials, or to the provision of marketing and business consulting services by a person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. Such prohibited transactions include, without limitation, payment of advances for information or informational materials not yet created and completed, provision of services to market, produce or co-produce, create or assist in the creation of information or informational materials, and payment or royalties to a designated national with respect to income received for enhancements or alterations made by persons subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to information or informational materials imported from a designated national.
(d)     This section does not authorize transactions incident to the exportation of restricted technical data as defined in 799 of the Export Administration Regulations, 15 CFR parts 768 - 799, or to the exportation of goods for use in the transmission of any data. The exportation of such goods to designated foreign countries is prohibited, as provided in 500.201 of this part and 785.1 of the Export Administration Regulations.Example B1: A U.S. publisher ships 500 copies of a book to Vietnam directly from San Francisco aboard a chartered aircraft, and receives payment by means of a letter of credit issued by a Vietnamese bank and confirmed by an American bank. These are permissible transactions under this section.
Example B2: A Vietnamese party exports a single master copy of a Vietnamese motion picture to a U.S. party and licenses the U.S. party to duplicate, distribute, show and exploit in the United States the Vietnamese film in any medium, including home video distribution, for five years, with the Vietnamese party receiving 40% of the net income. All transactions relating to the activities described in this example are authorized under this section or  500.550.
Example B3: A U.S. recording company proposes to contract with a Vietnamese musician to create certain musical compositions, and to advance royalties of $10,000 to the musician. The music written in Vietnam is to be recorded in a studio that the recording company owns in the Bahamas. These are all prohibited transactions. The U.S. party is prohibited under 500.201 from contracting for the Vietnamese musician's services, from transferring $10,000 to Vietnam to pay for those services, and from providing the Vietnamese with production services through the use of its studio in the Bahamas. No informational materials are in being at the time of these proposed transactions. However, the U.S. recording company may contract to purchase and import preexisting recordings by the Vietnamese musician, or to copy the recordings in the United States and pay negotiated royalties to Vietnam under this section or 500.550.Example B4: A Vietnamese party enters into a subpublication agreement licensing a U.S. party to print and publish copies of a musical composition and to sub-license rights of public performance, adaptation, and arrangement of the musical composition, with payment to be a percentage of income received. All transactions related to the activities described in this example are authorized under this section and 500.550, except for adaption and arrangement, which constitute artistic enhancement of the Vietnamese composition. Payment to the Vietnamese party may not reflect income received as a result of these enhancements.

500.403   Termination and acquisition of the interest of a designated national. 
(a)     Except as provided in 500.525, whenever a transaction licensed or authorized by or pursuant to this chapter results in the transfer of property (including any property interest) away from a designated national, such property shall no longer be deemed to be property in which a designated national has or has had an interest unless there exists in such property an interest of a designated national, the transfer of which has not been effected pursuant to license or other authorization. 
(b)     Unless otherwise specifically provided in a license or authorization contained in or issued pursuant to this chapter, if property (including any property interest) is transferred to a designated national such property shall be deemed to be property in which there exists the interest of a designated national. 

500.404   Transactions between principal and agent. 
A transaction between any person within the United States and any principal, agent, home office, branch, or correspondent, outside the United States of such person is a transaction prohibited by 500.201 to the same extent as if the parties to the transaction were in no way affiliated or associated with each other. 500.405   Exportation of securities, etc. to designated foreign countries. Section 500.201 prohibits the exportation of securities, currency, checks, drafts and promissory notes to designated foreign countries. 500.406   Drafts under irrevocable letters of credit; documentary drafts.

[15 FR 9040, Dec. 19, 1950, as amended at 54 FR 5231, Feb. 2, 1989]
500.408   Access to certain safe deposit boxes prohibited. Section 500.201 prohibits access to any safe deposit box within the United States in the custody of any designated national or containing any property in which any designated national has any interest or which there is reasonable cause to believe contains property in which any such designated national has any interest. Attention is directed to 500.517 which authorizes access to such safe deposit boxes under certain conditions. 500.409   Certain payments to designated foreign countries and nationals through third countries. Section 500.201 prohibits any request or authorization made by or on behalf of a bank or other person within the United States to a bank or other person outside of the United States as a result of which request or authorization such latter bank or person makes a payment or transfer of credit either directly or indirectly to a designated national. 
[18 FR 2080, Apr. 14, 1953] 
500.410   Currency, coins, and postage and other stamps. Currency, coins, and postage and other stamps issued by North Korea, North Viet-Nam, Cambodia, or South Viet-Nam are merchandise of North Korean, North Vietnamese, Cambodian, or South Vietnamese origin subject to 500.204(a)(1). [41 FR 16554, Apr. 20, 1976] 500.411   Dealings abroad in commodities subject to the Regulations. Section 500.204 prohibits the unlicensed importation into the United States of commodities of North Korean, North Vietnamese, Cambodian, or South Vietnamese origin.

[41 FR 16554, Apr. 20, 1976] 
500.412   Process vs. manufacture. A commodity subject to 500.204 remains subject howsoever it has been processed. It should not be assumed that a commodity which has undergone operations other than those listed in 500.204(a)(1), has become a manufactured form of the commodity rather than a processed form thereof. In case of question, a ruling should be requested from the Office of Foreign Assets Control. Requests for rulings in the form of license applications or otherwise should include adequate technical detail. It should be noted that it is quite possible for merchandise to have North Korea, North Viet-Nam, Cambodia, or South Viet-Nam as its ``country of origin'' for Foreign Assets Control purposes while having some other country as its ``country of origin'' for marking or statistical purposes. 
[41 FR 16554, Apr. 20, 1976] 
500.413  Participation in certain development projects in Vietnam.The following examples illustrate the scope of the authorization in 500.576 for dealings in property in which Vietnam or a Vietnamese national has an interest with respect to development projects in Vietnam formally proposed or approved for execution, funding or sponsorship by a qualified international institution listed in appendix A to this part (``Qualified Projects'').
Example B 1: The Government of Vietnam (``Vietnam'') approaches a U.S. financial consulting firm (the ``U.S. Consulting Firm'') for advice on building cement plants in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. The project might be eligible for funding by the Asian Development Bank (the ``ADB''), and Vietnam wants the U.S. Consulting Firm's assistance in conducting a feasibility study for submission to the ADB. Since the project has not yet been formally proposed or approved for funding by the ADB, no involvement of the U.S. Consulting Firm is authorized pursuant to 500.576. However, had the ADB formally proposed the project in its monthly ADB Business Opportunities as a project being considered for funding, or had it funded the feasibility study, 500.576 would authorize the U.S. Consulting Firm's transactions.Example B 2: Upon ADB approval of funding for the cement plant project, a U.S. company (the ``U.S. Company'') forms a joint venture with a Vietnamese company to bid on construction of the cement plants in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. The joint venture's bid is successful, and it purchases construction equipment from the United States, financed by a U.S. bank and insured by a U.S. company. Several items are sourced from the United States during construction, including cement equipment, which is covered by a ten-year service and maintenance agreement. The joint venture agreement calls for the continued management and operation of the plants by the U.S. Company after completion, and for the insurance of the plants by a U.S. insurance company. Each of these transactions with respect to the Qualified Project is authorized by 500.576.Example B 3: The International Finance Corporation (``IFC'') offers equity investment in a Vietnamese company to finance environmental safeguards for drilling operations in offshore oil fields. Various U.S. investors, including venture capital companies, brokerage firms, and investment banks contribute capital and receive shares in the Vietnamese company. This equity investment in a Qualified Project is authorized by 500.576. The U.S. companies purchasing these shares as part of the IFC-sponsored development project may hold or resell them, including resale to other persons subject to U.S. jurisdiction. Shares acquired by entities not subject to U.S. jurisdiction may not then be purchased or repurchased by a person subject to U.S. jurisdiction.Example B 4: (a) An Indonesian company (the ``Contractor'') is a successful bidder on a Qualified Project, and hires a U.S. law firm to represent it in contract negotiations with Vietnam to build a fish processing and canning facility in Vietnam funded by the World Bank. The law firm may represent the Contractor throughout the course of the project pursuant to 500.576, once the project has been formally proposed or approved for funding by the World Bank.(b)     Once the Qualified Project is underway, the Contractor purchases equipment manufactured in France by a French company. The long-term servicing of the equipment, however, will be provided by the French company's U.S. subsidiary. The service transactions are authorized pursuant to 500.576.(c)     After the processing facility is completed, Vietnam hires a U.S. marketing firm to develop marketing strategies for the product worldwide. It further asks the marketing firm to execute the strategies it devises and to represent the product in South-East Asia, including the domestic market in Vietnam. The marketing firm in turn would hire the brokerage services of a U.S. citizen domiciled in Thailand for the sale of the product to that country. These transactions are outside the scope of 500.576, and violate 500.201, because they are not directly incident to the Qualified Project funded by the World Bank. [58 FR 68530, Dec. 28, 1993]Subpart E_Licenses, Authorizations and Statements of Licensing Policy 500.502   Effect of subsequent license or authorization.

500.505  Certain persons unblocked. (a)     The following persons are hereby licensed as unblocked nationals:(1)     Any person resident in, or organized under the laws of a jurisdiction in, the United States or the authorized trade territory who or which has never been a designated national;

It is the policy of the Office of Foreign Assets Control not to grant applications for specific licenses authorizing transactions to which the provisions of an outstanding general license are applicable. Persons availing themselves of certain general licenses are required to file reports and statements in the form and in accordance with the instructions specified in the licenses. 
(b)     Specific licenses -- (1) General course of procedure. Transactions subject to the prohibitions contained in 
Subpart B of this part which are not authorized by general license may be effected only under specific license. When an unusual problem is presented, the proposed action is cleared with the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control or such person as he may designate. 
(2) Applications for specific licenses. Applications for specific licenses to engage in any transactions prohibited by or pursuant to this part may be filed by letter with the Office of Foreign Assets Control. Any person having an interest in a transaction or proposed transaction may file an application for a license authorizing such transaction, but the applicant for a specific license is required to make full disclosure of all parties in interest to the transaction so that a decision on the application may be made with full knowledge of all relevant facts and so that the identity and location of the persons who know about the transaction may be easily ascertained in the event of inquiry. 
(3)     Information to be supplied. The applicant must supply all information specified by relevant instructions, and must fully disclose the names of all the parties who are concerned with or interested in the proposed transaction. If the application is filed by an agent, the agent must disclose the name of his principal(s). Such documents as may be relevant shall be attached to each application as a part of such application except that documents previously filed with the Office of Foreign Assets Control may, where appropriate, be incorporated by reference. Applicants may be required to furnish such further information as is deemed necessary to a proper determination by the Office of Foreign Assets Control. Any applicant or other party in interest desiring to present additional information concerning the application may do so at any time. Arrangements for oral presentation may be made with the Office of Foreign Assets Control. 
(4)     Effect of denial. The denial of a license does not preclude the reopening of an application of the filing of a further application. The applicant or any other party in interest may at any time request explanation of the reasons for a denial by correspondence or personal interview. 
(5)     Reports under specific licenses. As a condition upon the issuance of any license, the licensee may be required to file reports with respect to the transaction covered by the license, in such form and at such times and places as may be prescribed in the license or otherwise. 
(6)     Issuance of license. Licenses will be issued by the Office of Foreign Assets Control acting on behalf of the Secretary of the Treasury, acting in accordance with such regulations, rulings and instructions as the Secretary of the Treasury or the Office of Foreign Assets Control may from time to time prescribe, in such cases or classes of cases as the Secretary of the Treasury or the Office of Foreign Assets Control may determine, or licenses may be issued by the Secretary of the Treasury acting directly or through any person, agency, or instrumentality designated by him. 

(c)     Address. License applications, reports, and inquiries should be addressed to the appropriate section or individual within the Office of Foreign Assets Control, or to its Director, at the following address: Office of Foreign Assets Control, U.S. Department of the Treasury, 1500 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20220.

500.802   Unblocking. Any interested person desiring the unblocking of accounts or other property on the ground that no person having an interest in the property is a designated national may file such an application. Such application shall be filed in the manner provided in 500.801(b) and shall contain full information in support of the administrative action requested.

500.803   Decision. The Office of Foreign Assets Control will advise each applicant of the decision respecting applications filed by him.

[35 FR 4045, Mar. 4, 1970] 
500.805   Amendment, modification, or revocation. The provisions of this chapter and any rulings, licenses, authorizations, instructions, orders, or forms issued thereunder may be amended, modified, or revoked at any time. 500.806   Rulemaking. All rules and other public documents are issued by the Secretary of the Treasury upon recommendation of the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control. Except to the extent that there is involved any military, naval, or foreign affairs function of the United States or any matter relating to agency management or personnel or to public property, loans, grants, benefits, or contracts and except when interpretative rules, general statement of policy, or rules of agency organization, practice, or procedure are involved or when notice and public procedure are impracticable, unnecessary or contrary to the public interest, interested persons will be afforded an opportunity to participate in rule making through submission of written data, views, or argument, with oral presentation in the discretion of the Director. In general, rule making by the Office of Foreign Assets Control involves foreign affairs functions of the United States. Wherever possible, however, it is the practice to hold informal consultations with interested groups or persons before the issuance of any rule or other public document. Any interested person may petition the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control in writing for the issuance, amendment or repeal of any rule. 
500.807   Delegation by the Secretary of the Treasury.

(1)     Entry for consumption (including any appraisement entry, any entry of goods imported in the mails, regardless of value, or any other informal entries); 
(2)     Entry for immediate exportation; 
(3)     Entry for transportation and exportation; 
(4)     Withdrawal from warehouse; 
(5)     Transfer or withdrawal from a foreign-trade zone; or 
(6)     Manipulation or manufacture in a warehouse or in a foreign-trade zone, until either; 

(i)     A specific license pursuant to this chapter is presented; or, 
(ii)    Instructions from the Foreign Assets Control, authorizing the transaction are received. 

(b)     Whenever a specific license is presented to a director of customs in accordance with this section, one additional legible copy of the entry, withdrawal or other appropriate document with respect to the merchandise involved shall be filed with the director of customs at the port where the transaction is to take place. Each copy of any such entry, withdrawal or other appropriate document, including the additional copy, shall bear plainly on its face the number of the license pursuant to which it is filed. The original copy of the specific license shall be presented to the director in respect to each such transaction and shall bear a notation in ink by the licensee or person presenting the license showing the description, quantity, and value of the merchandise to be entered, withdrawn or otherwise dealt with. This notation should be so placed and so written that there will exist no possibility of confusing it with anything placed on the license at the time of its issuance. If the license in fact authorizes the entry, withdrawal or other transaction with regard to the merchandise, the director, or other authorized customs employee, shall verify the notation by signing or initialing it after first assuring himself that it accurately describes the merchandise it purports to represent. The license shall thereafter be returned to the person presenting it and the additional copy of the entry, withdrawal or other appropriate document shall be forwarded by the director to the Office of Foreign Assets Control, Treasury Department, Washington, DC 20220. 
(c)     Whenever a person shall present an entry, withdrawal or other appropriate document affected by this section and shall assert that no specific Foreign Assets Control license is required in connection therewith, the director of customs shall withhold action thereon and shall advise such person to communicate directly with the Office of Foreign Assets Control to request that instructions be issued to the director to authorize him to take action with regard thereto.
