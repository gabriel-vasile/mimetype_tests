(b)     No transfer before the ``effective date'' shall be the basis for the assertion or recognition of any right, remedy, power, or privilege with respect to, or interest in, any property in which a designated national has or has had an interest since the ``effective date'' unless the person with whom such property is held or maintained had written notice of the transfer or by any written evidence had recognized such transfer prior to such ``effective date.'' 
(c)     Unless otherwise provided, an appropriate license or other authorization issued by or pursuant to the direction or authorization of the Secretary of the Treasury before, during or after a transfer shall validate such transfer or render it enforceable to the same extent as it would be valid or enforceable but for the provisions of section 5(b) of the Trading With the Enemy Act, as amended, and this part and any ruling, order, regulation, direction or instruction issued hereunder.

(3)     Promptly upon discovery that: 

(i)     Such transfer was in violation of the provisions of this part or any regulation, ruling, instruction, license or other direction or authorization thereunder, or 
(ii)    Such transfer was not licensed or authorized by the Secretary of the Treasury, or

[44 FR 11770, Mar. 2, 1979]

Such prohibited transactions include, without limitation, payment of advances for informational materials not yet created and completed, provision of services to market, produce or co-produce, create or assist in the creation of informational materials, and payment of royalties to a designated national with respect to income received for enhancements or alterations made by persons subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to informational materials imported from a designated national.
(d)     This section does not authorize transactions incident to the transmission of restricted technical data as defined in section 779 of the Export Administration Regulations, 15 CFR Parts 768 - 799, or to the exportation of goods for use in the transmission of any data. The exportation of such goods to designated foreign countries is prohibited, as provided in 515.201 of this part and 785.1 of the Export Administration Regulations.(e)     This section does not authorize transactions related to travel to Cuba when such travel is not otherwise authorized under 515.560 or by specific license.

Example B1: A U.S. publisher ships 500 copies of a book to Cuba directly from Miami aboard a chartered aircraft, and receives payment by means of a letter of credit issued by a Cuban bank and confirmed by an American bank. These are permissible transactions under this section.
Example B2: A Cuban party exports a single master copy of a Cuban motion picture to a U.S. party and licenses the U.S. party to duplicate, distribute, show and exploit in the United States the Cuban film in any medium, including home video distribution, for five years, with the Cuban party receiving 40% of the net income. All transactions relating to the activities described in this example are authorized under this section or 515.550.Example B3: A U.S. recording company proposes to contract with a Cuban musician to create certain musical compositions, and to advance royalties of $10,000 to the musician. The music written in Cuba is to be recorded in a studio that the recording company owns in the Bahamas. These are all prohibited transactions. The U.S. party is prohibited under 515.201 from contracting for the Cuban musician's services, from transferring $10,000 to Cuba to pay for those services, and from providing the Cuban with production services through the use of its studio in the Bahamas. No informational materials are in being at the time of these proposed transactions. However, the U.S. recording company may contract to purchase and import preexisting recordings by the Cuban musician, or to copy the recordings in the United States and pay negotiated royalties to Cuba under this section or 515.550.Example B4: A Cuban party enters into a subpublication agreement licensing a U.S. party to print and publish copies of a musicial composition and to sub-license rights of public performance, adaptation, and arrangement of the musical composition, with payment to be a percentage of income received. All transactions related to the activities described in this example are authorized under this section and 515.550, except for synchronization, adaptation, and arrangement, which constitute artistic enhancement of the Cuban composition. Payment to the Cuban party may not reflect income received as a result of these enhancements.
[54 FR 5233, Feb. 2, 1989] 
515.207   Entry of vessels engaged in trade with Cuba.Except as specifically authorized by the Secretary of the Treasury (or any person, agency or instrumentality designated by him), by means of regulations, rulings, instructions, licenses or otherwise, (a)     No vessel that enters a port or place in Cuba to engage in the trade of goods or the purchase or provision of services, may enter a U.S. port for the purpose of loading or unloading freight for a period of 180 days from the date the vessel departed from a port or place in Cuba; and 
(b)     No vessel carrying goods or passengers to or from Cuba or carrying goods in which Cuba or a Cuban national has an interest may enter a U.S. port with such goods or passengers on board.

[45 FR 32671, May 19, 1980] 515.416   Professional research and similar activities.(a)     Section 515.560(b) sets forth the criteria by which specific licenses for transactions related to travel to, from, and within Cuba may be issued for persons who are engaging in professional research and similar activities of a noncommercial, academic nature.

(1)     Persons are considered to be engaged in professional research for purposes of this section only if they are full - time professionals who travel to Cuba to do research in their professional areas, their research is specifically related to Cuba and will constitute a full work schedule in Cuba, and there is a substantial likelihood of public dissemination of the product of their research. No transactions related to tourist or recreational travel within Cuba are authorized in connection with professional research, except those that are consistent with a full schedule of research activities.
(2)     Similar activities include attendance by professionals with an established interest in Cuba at professional meetings where research on Cuba is shared, and travel for noncommercial research purposes specifically related to Cuba by persons who are working to qualify themselves academically as professionals (e.g., certain graduate degree candidates). Study visits to Cuba in connection with pre - college or undergraduate college course work are not within the scope of the term professional research and similar activities.

(b)     Categories of travel which do not qualify as professional research or similar activities and for which specific license requests will be denied include recreational travel; tourist travel; travel in pursuit of a hobby; general study tours; general orientation visits; student class field trips; youth camps; research for personal satisfaction only; travel by fishing or bird - watching groups and similar affinity groups; and any travel for an authorized research purpose, if the schedule of activities includes free time, travel, or recreation in excess of that consistent with a full work schedule of professional research and similar activities.
(c)     A group does not fall within the scope of the term professional research and similar activities merely because some members of the group could qualify individually for specific licensing under this category. For example, a specific license authorizing travel - related transactions by a fish biologist who travels to Cuba to engage in professional research does not authorize other persons who might travel with the fish biologist but whose principal purpose in travel is to engage in recreational or trophy fishing. The fact that such persons may engage in certain activities with, or under the direction of, the professional fish biologist, such as measuring or recording facts about their catch, does not bring these individuals' activities within the scope of professional research and similar activities.
(d)     A person will not qualify as engaging in professional research or similar activities merely because that person is a professional who plans to travel to Cuba. For example, a professor of history interested in traveling to Cuba for the principal purpose of learning or practicing Spanish or attending general purpose lectures devoted to Cuban culture and contemporary life would not qualify for a specific license. A doctoral candidate in economics traveling to Cuba to undertake research for a dissertation on the Cuban economy may qualify for a specific license for activities directly related to the research, but would not be authorized to stay an extra week in Cuba in order to attend a seminar on Cuban arts and crafts.

Pursuant to 515.560(b), licenses may be issued on a case-by-case basis for travel transactions related to travel for negotiation or performance of telecommunications agreements for service between the United States and Cuba.

515.505  Certain persons unblocked.(a)     The following persons are hereby licensed as unblocked nationals.

(1)     Any person resident in, or organized under the laws of a jurisdiction in, the United States or the authorized trade territory who or which has never been a designated national;
(2)     Any individual resident in the United States who is not a specially designated national; and
(3)     Any corporation, partnership or association that would be a designated national solely because of the interest therein of an individual licensed in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section as an unblocked national.

(b)     Individual nationals of a designated country who have taken up residence in the authorized trade territory may apply to the Office of Foreign Assets Control to be specifically licensed as unblocked nationals.
(c)     The licensing of any person as an unblocked national shall not suspend the requirements of any section of this chapter relating to the maintenance or production of records.

Specific licenses for importation of goods of Cuban origin are generally not issued unless the applicant submits satisfactory documentary proof of the location of the goods outside Cuba prior to July 8, 1963 and of the absence of any Cuban interest in the goods at all times on or since that date. Since the type of document which would constitute satisfactory proof varies depending upon the facts of the particular case, it is not possible to state in advance the type of documents required. However, it has been found that affidavits, statements, invoices, and other documents prepared by manufacturers, processors, sellers or shippers cannot be relied on and are therefore not by themselves accepted by the Office of Foreign Assets Control as satisfactory proof of origin. Independent corroborating documentary evidence, such as insurance documents, bills of lading, etc., may be accepted as satisfactory proof.

Specific licenses are issued unblocking portions of such accounts blocked by reason of the residence of one spouse in Cuba in favor of the non-blocked spouse under the policy stated in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

Subpart H_Procedures 
515.801   Licensing. (a)     General licenses. General licenses have been issued authorizing under appropriate terms and conditions, many types of transactions which are subject to the prohibitions contained in 
Subpart B. All such licenses are set forth in 
Subpart E. It is the policy of the Office of Foreign Assets Control not to grant applications for specific licenses authorizing transactions to which the provisions of an outstanding general license are applicable. Persons availing themselves of certain general licenses are required to file reports and statements in accordance with the instructions specified in the licenses. 
(b)     Specific licenses -- (1) General course of procedure. Transactions subject to the prohibitions contained in 
Subpart B of this part which are not authorized by general license may be effected only under specific license. When an unusual problem is presented, the proposed action is cleared with the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control or such person as he may designate. 
(2) Applications for specific licenses. Applications for specific licenses to engage in any transactions prohibited by or pursuant to this part may be filed by letter with the Office of Foreign Assets Control. Any person having an interest in a transaction or proposed transaction may file an application for a license authorizing such transaction, but the applicant for a specific license is required to make full disclosure of all parties in interest to the transaction so that a decision on the application may be made with full knowledge of all relevant facts and so that the identity and location of the persons who know about the transaction may be easily ascertained in the event of inquiry.
(3)     Information to be supplied. The applicant must supply all information specified by relevant instructions, and must fully disclose the names of all the parties who are concerned with or interested in the proposed transaction. If the application is filed by an agent, the agent must disclose the name of his principal(s). Such documents as may be relevant shall be attached to each application as a part of such application except that documents previously filed with the Office of Foreign Assets Control may, where appropriate, be incorporated by reference. Applicants may be required to furnish such further information as is deemed necessary to a proper determination by the Office of Foreign Assets Control. Any applicant or other party in interest desiring to present additional information concerning the application may do so at any time. Arrangements for oral presentation may be made with the Office of Foreign Assets Control.
(4)     Effect of denial. The denial of a license does not preclude the reopening of an application or the filing of a further application. The applicant or any other party in interest may at any time request explanation of the reasons for a denial by correspondence or personal interview. 
(5)     Reports under specific licenses. As a condition upon the issuance of any license, the licensee may be required to file reports with respect to the transaction covered by the license, in such form and at such times and places as may be prescribed in the license or otherwise. 
(6)     Issuance of license. Licenses will be issued by the Office of Foreign Assets Control acting on behalf of the Secretary of the Treasury, acting in accordance with such regulations, rulings and instructions as the Secretary of the Treasury or the Office of Foreign Assets Control may from time to time prescribe, in such cases or classes of cases as the Secretary of the Treasury or the Office of Foreign Assets Control may determine, or licenses may be issued by the Secretary of the Treasury acting directly or through any person, agency, or instrumentality designated by him. 

(c)     Address. License applications, reports, and inquiries should be addressed to the appropriate section or individual within the Office of Foreign Assets Control, or to its Director, at the following address: Office of Foreign Assets Control, U.S. Department of the Treasury, 1500 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20220.

515.802   Unblocking. (a)     Any interested person desiring the unblocking of accounts or other property on the ground that no person having an interest in the property is a designated national may file such an application. Such application shall be filed in the manner provided in 515.801(b) and shall contain full information in support of the administrative action requested. (b)     The applicant is entitled to be heard on the application. If the applicant desires a hearing, arrangements should be made with the Office of Foreign Assets Control.

[32 FR 10847, July 25, 1967] 515.805   Amendment, modification, or revocation. The provisions of this part and any rulings, licenses, authorizations, instructions, orders, or forms issued thereunder may be amended, modified, or revoked at any time. 
515.806   Rulemaking. (a)     All rules and other public documents are issued by the Secretary of the Treasury upon recommendation of the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control. Except to the extent that there is involved any military, naval, or foreign affairs function of the United States or any matter relating to agency management or personnel or to public property, loans, grants, benefits, or contracts and except when interpretative rules, general statements of policy, or rules of agency organization, practice, or procedure are involved or when notice and public procedure are impracticable, unnecessary or contrary to the public interest, interested persons will be afforded an opportunity to participate in rule making through submission of written data, views, or argument, with oral presentation in the discretion of the Director. In general, rule making by the Office of Foreign Assets Control involves foreign affairs functions of the United States. Wherever possible, however, it is the practice to hold informal consultations with interested groups or persons before the issuance of any rule or other public document. 
(b)     Any interested person may petition the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control in writing for the issuance, amendment or repeal of any rule. 

515.807   Delegation by the Secretary of the Treasury. Any action under 515.201 which the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to take pursuant to Proclamation 3447 or the Trading With the Enemy Act may be taken by the Director, Office of Foreign Assets Control, or by any other person to whom the Secretary of the Treasury has delegated authority so to act. 
515.808   Customs procedures; merchandise specified in 515.204. (a)     With respect to merchandise specified in 515.204 (including nickel-bearing materials presumptively subject thereto) whether or not such merchandise has been imported into the United States, collectors of customs shall not accept or allow any:

(2)     Entry for immediate exportation; 
(3)     Entry for transportation and exportation; 
(4)     Withdrawal from warehouse; 
(5)     Transfer or withdrawal from a foreign-trade zone; or 
(6)     Manipulation or manufacture in a warehouse or in a foreign-trade zone, unless either: 

(i)     The merchandise was imported prior to 12:01 a.m., February 7, 1962, or 
(ii)    A specific license pursuant to this part is presented, or 
(iii)   Instructions from the Office of Foreign Assets Control, authorizing the transaction are received, or 
(iv)    The original of an appropriate certificate of origin as defined in 515.536(d) is presented. (b)     Whenever a specific license is presented to a collector of customs in accordance with this section, one additional legible copy of the entry, withdrawal or other appropriate document with respect to the merchandise involved shall be filed with the collector of customs at the port where the transaction is to take place. Each copy of any such entry, withdrawal or other appropriate document, including the additional copy, shall bear plainly on its face the number of the license pursuant to which it is filed. The original copy of the specific license shall be presented to the collector in respect of each such transaction and shall bear a notation in ink by the licensee or person presenting the license showing the description, quantity and value of the merchandise to be entered, withdrawn or otherwise dealt with. This notation should be so placed and so written that there will exist no possibility of confusing it with anything placed on the license at the time of its issuance. If the license in fact authorizes the entry, withdrawal or other transaction with regard to the merchandise the collector, or other authorized customs employee, shall verify the notation by signing or initialing it after first assuring himself that it accurately describes the merchandise it purports to represent. The license shall thereafter be returned to the person presenting it and the additional copy of the entry, withdrawal or other appropriate document shall be forwarded by the collector to the Foreign Assets Control. 

c(1) Whenever the original of an appropriate certificate or origin as defined in 515.536(d) is presented to a collector of customs in accordance with this section, an additional legible copy of the entry, withdrawal or other appropriate document with respect to the merchandise involved shall be filed with the collector of customs at the port where the transaction is to take place. Each copy of the entry, withdrawal, or other appropriate document, including the additional copy, shall bear plainly on its face the following statement: ``This document is presented under the provisions of 515.536 c of the Cuban Assets Control Regulations.'' The original of the certificate of origin shall not be returned to the person presenting it. It shall be securely attached to the additional copy required by this subparagraph and shall be forwarded by the collector to the Office of Foreign Assets Control, Treasury Department, Washington, DC 20220. Collectors may forward such documents weekly or more often if the volume warrants. 
(2) If the original of an appropriate certificate of origin is properly presented to a collector of customs with respect to a transaction which is the first of a series of transactions which may be allowed in connection therewith under paragraph (a)(6)(iv) of this section (as, for example, where merchandise has been entered in a bonded warehouse and an appropriate certificate of origin is presented which relates to all of the merchandise entered therein but the importer desires to withdraw only part of the merchandise in the first transaction), the collector shall so note on the original of the appropriate certificate of origin and return it to the importer. In addition, the collector shall endorse his pertinent records so as to record what merchandise is covered by the appropriate certificate of origin presented. The collector may thereafter allow subsequent authorized transactions on presentation of the certificate of origin. The collector shall, with respect to each such transaction, demand an additional copy of each withdrawal or other appropriate document, which copy shall be promptly forwarded by the collector to the Office of Foreign Assets Control, Treasury Department, Washington, DC 20220, with an endorsement thereon reading: 
This document has been accepted pursuant to 515.808c (2) of the Cuban Assets Control Regulations. Appropriate certificate of origin No. --  --  --  --  --  --  --  -- from (country). When the final transaction has been effected under the certificate of origin, the original shall be taken up and attached to the entry and forwarded as in this paragraph. (d)     Whenever a person shall present an entry, withdrawal or other appropriate document affected by this section and shall assert that no specific Foreign Assets Control license or appropriate certificate of origin as defined in 515.536 (d) is required in connection therewith, the collector of customs shall withhold action thereon and shall advise such person to communicate directly with the Office of Foreign Assets Control to request that instructions be issued to the collector to authorize him to take action with regard thereto. [30 FR 15371, Dec. 14, 1965, as amended at 57 FR 1388, Jan. 14, 1992] 515.809   Rules governing availability of information.

(b)     The records of the Office of Foreign Assets Control required by the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a) to be made available to an individual shall be made available in accordance with the definitions, procedures, requirements for payment of fees, and other provisions of the Regulations on Disclosure of Records of the Departmental Offices and of other bureaus and offices of the Department of the Treasury issued under 5 U.S.C. 552a and published in part 1 of this title.
