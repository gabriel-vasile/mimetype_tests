-HEAD-
    Sec. 401. Illegal exportation of war materials

-STATUTE-
    (a) Seizure and forfeiture of materials and carriers
      Whenever an attempt is made to export or ship from or take out of
    the United States any arms or munitions of war or other articles in
    violation of law, or whenever it is known or there shall be
    probable cause to believe that any arms or munitions of war or
    other articles are intended to be or are being or have been
    exported or removed from the United States in violation of law, the
    Secretary of the Treasury, or any person duly authorized for the
    purpose by the President, may seize and detain such arms or
    munitions of war or other articles and may seize and detain any
    vessel, vehicle, or aircraft containing the same or which has been
    or is being used in exporting or attempting to export such arms or
    munitions of war or other articles. The Secretary of Commerce may
    seize and detain any commodity (other than arms or munitions of
    war) or technology which is intended to be or is being exported in
    violation of laws governing such exports and may seize and detain
    any vessel, vehicle, or aircraft containing the same or which has
    been used or is being used in exporting or attempting to export
    such articles. All arms or munitions of war and other articles,
    vessels, vehicles, and aircraft seized pursuant to this subsection
    shall be forfeited.
    (b) Applicability of laws relating to seizure, forfeiture, and
      condemnation
      All provisions of law relating to seizure, summary and judicial
    forfeiture and condemnation for violation of the customs laws, the
    disposition of the property forfeited or condemned or the proceeds
    from the sale thereof; the remission or mitigation of such
    forfeitures; and the compromise of claims and the award of
    compensation to informers in respect of such forfeitures shall
    apply to seizures and forfeitures incurred, or alleged to have been
    incurred, under the provisions of this section, insofar as
    applicable and not inconsistent with the provisions hereof.
    However, with respect to seizures and forfeitures of property under
    this section by the Secretary of Commerce, such duties as are
    imposed upon the customs officer or any other person with respect
    to the seizure and forfeiture of property under the customs law may
    be performed by such officers as are designated by the Secretary of
    Commerce or, upon the request of the Secretary of Commerce, by any
    other agency that has authority to manage and dispose of seized
    property. Awards of compensation to informers under this section
    may be paid only out of funds specifically appropriated therefor.
    (c) Disposition of forfeited materials
      Arms and munitions of war forfeited under subsection (b) of this
    section shall be delivered to the Secretary of Defense for such use
    or disposition as he may deem in the public interest, or, in the
    event that the Secretary of Defense refuses to accept such arms and
    munitions of war, they shall be sold or otherwise disposed of as
    prescribed under existing law in the case of forfeitures for
    violation of the customs laws.

-STATUTE-
    (a) Bond to insure non-delivery of men, ammunition, fuel, etc.
      Whenever, during any war in which the United States is neutral,
    the President, or any person thereunto authorized by him, shall
    have cause to believe that any vessel, domestic or foreign, whether
    requiring clearance or not, is about to carry out of a port or from
    the jurisdiction of the United States, fuel, men, arms, ammunition,
    implements of war, supplies, dispatches, or information to any
    warship, tender, or supply ship of a state named in a proclamation
    issued under the authority of section 441(a) of this title, but the
    evidence is not deemed sufficient to justify forbidding the
    departure of the vessel as provided for by section 967 of title 18,
    and if, in the President's judgment, such action will serve to
    maintain peace between the United States and foreign states, or to
    protect the commercial interests of the United States and its
    citizens, or to promote the security or neutrality of the United
    States, he shall have the power, and it shall be his duty, to
    require the owner, master, or person in command thereof, before
    departing from a port or from the jurisdiction of the United
    States, to give a bond to the United States, with sufficient
    sureties, in such amount as he shall deem proper, conditioned that
    the vessel will not deliver the men, or any fuel, supplies,
    dispatches, information, or any part of the cargo, to any warship,
    tender, or supply ship of a state named in a proclamation issued
    under the authority of section 441(a) of this title.
    (b) Departure prohibited
      If the President, or any person thereunto authorized by him,
    shall find that a vessel, domestic or foreign, in a port of the
    United States, has previously departed from a port or from the
    jurisdiction of the United States during such war and delivered
    men, fuel, supplies, dispatches, information, or any part of its
    cargo to a warship, tender, or supply ship of a state named in a
    proclamation issued under the authority of section 441(a) of this
    title, he may prohibit the departure of such vessel during the
    duration of the war.
    (c) Alien seaman; bond
      Whenever the President shall have issued a proclamation under
    section 441(a) of this title he may, while such proclamation is in
    effect, require the owner, master, or person in command of any
    vessel, foreign or domestic, before departing from the United
    States, to give a bond to the United States, with sufficient
    sureties, in such amount as he shall deem proper, conditioned that
    no alien seaman who arrived on such vessel shall remain in the
    United States for a longer period than that permitted under the
    regulations, as amended from time to time, issued pursuant to
    section 168 (!1) of title 8. Notwithstanding the provisions of said
    section 168 (!1) of title 8, the President may issue such
    regulations with respect to the landing of such seamen as he deems
    necessary to insure their departure either on such vessel or
    another vessel at the expense of such owner, master, or person in
    command.

    use of the ports and territorial waters of the United States by the

    to protect the commercial interests of the United States and its
    citizens, or to promote the security of the United States, and
    shall make proclamation thereof, it shall thereafter be unlawful
    for any such submarine or armed merchant vessel to enter a port or
    the territorial waters of the United States or to depart therefrom,
    except under such conditions and subject to such limitations as the
    President may prescribe. Whenever, in his judgment, the conditions
    which have caused him to issue his proclamation have ceased to
    exist, he shall revoke his proclamation and the provisions of this
    section shall thereupon cease to apply, except as to offenses
