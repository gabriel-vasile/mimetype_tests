            EFFECTIVE DATE OF 2003 AMENDMENT BY PUB. L. 108-178        
      Pub. L. 108-178, enacting and amending notes set out below,
    effective Aug. 21, 2002, see section 5 of Pub. L. 108-178, set out
    as an Effective Date of 2003 Amendment note under section 5334 of
    Title 5, Government Organization and Employees.

                              ENACTING CLAUSE                          
      Pub. L. 107-217, Sec. 1, Aug. 21, 2002, 116 Stat. 1062, provided
    in part that: "Certain general and permanent laws of the United
    States, related to public buildings, property, and works, are
    revised, codified, and enacted as title 40, United States Code,
    'Public Buildings, Property, and Works' ".

                   LEGISLATIVE PURPOSE AND CONSTRUCTION               
      Pub. L. 108-178, Sec. 1, Dec. 15, 2003, 117 Stat. 2637, provided
    that:
      "(a) Purpose. - The purpose of this Act [see Tables for
    classification] is to improve the United States Code by making
    necessary technical changes.
      "(b) No Substantive Change. - This Act makes no substantive
    change in existing law and may not be construed as making a
    substantive change in existing law.
      "(c) Severability. - If a provision enacted by this Act is held
    invalid, all valid provisions that are severable from the invalid
    provision remain in effect. If a provision enacted by this Act is
    held invalid in any of its applications, the provision remains
    valid for all valid applications that are severable from any of the
    invalid applications."
      Pub. L. 107-217, Sec. 5, Aug. 21, 2002, 116 Stat. 1303, provided
    that:
      "(a) Purpose. - The purpose of this Act is to revise, codify, and
    enact without substantive change the general and permanent laws of
    the United States related to public buildings, property, and works,
    in order to remove ambiguities, contradictions, and other
    imperfections and to repeal obsolete, superfluous, and superseded
    provisions.
      "(b) No Substantive Change. - 
        "(1) In general. - This Act makes no substantive change in
      existing law and may not be construed as making a substantive
      change in existing law.
        "(2) Deemed date of enactment for certain purposes. - For
      purposes of determining whether one provision of law supersedes
      another based on enactment later in time, and otherwise to ensure
      that this Act makes no substantive change in existing law, the
      date of enactment of a provision restated in section 1 or 2 of
      this Act is deemed to remain unchanged, continuing to be the date
      of enactment of the underlying provision of public law that is
      being restated.
        "(3) Inconsistent laws enacted after March 31, 2002. - This Act
      restates certain laws enacted before April 1, 2002. Any law
      enacted after March 31, 2002, that is inconsistent with this Act,
      including any law purporting to amend or repeal a provision that
      is repealed by this Act, supersedes this Act to the extent of the
      inconsistency.
      "(c) References. - A reference to a law replaced by section 1 or
    2 of this Act, including a reference in a regulation, order, or
    other law, is deemed to refer to the corresponding provision
    enacted by this Act.
      "(d) Continuing Effect. - An order, rule, or regulation in effect
    under a law replaced by section 1 or 2 of this Act continues in
    effect under the corresponding provision enacted by this Act until
    repealed, amended, or superseded.
      "(e) Actions and Offenses Under Prior Law. - An action taken or
    an offense committed under a law replaced by section 1 or 2 of this
    Act is deemed to have been taken or committed under the
    corresponding provision enacted by this Act.
      "(f) Inferences. - An inference of a legislative construction is
    not to be drawn by reason of the location in the United States Code
    of a provision enacted by this Act or by reason of a caption or
    catch line of the provision.
      "(g) Severability. - If a provision enacted by this Act is held
    invalid, all valid provisions that are severable from the invalid
    provision remain in effect. If a provision enacted by this Act is
    held invalid in any of its applications, the provision remains
    valid for all valid applications that are severable from any of the
    invalid applications."

                                  REPEALS                              
      Pub. L. 108-178, Sec. 2(b), Dec. 15, 2003, 117 Stat. 2640,
    provided that: "Section 6(b) of Public Law 107-217 (116 Stat. 1304)
    [see below] is repealed insofar as it relates to the provisions
    listed below, and the provisions listed below are revived to read
    as if section 6(b) had not been enacted:
        "(1) Section 1(a) of the Act of June 30, 1949 (ch. 288, 63
      Stat. 377) [41 U.S.C. 251 note].
        "(2) Section 509(b) of the Department of Education Organization
      Act (Public Law 96-88, 93 Stat. 695) [20 U.S.C. 3508(b)].
        "(3) Public Law 101-427 (104 Stat. 927) [23 U.S.C. 101 note].
        "(4) Section 7306 of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act
      of 1994 (Public Law 103-355, 108 Stat. 3384)."
      Pub. L. 107-217, Sec. 6(a), Aug. 21, 2002, 116 Stat. 1304,
    provided that: "The repeal of a law by this Act may not be
    construed as a legislative inference that the provision was or was
    not in effect before its repeal."
      Pub. L. 107-217, Sec. 6(b), Aug. 21, 2002, 116 Stat. 1304, as
    amended by Pub. L. 108-178, Sec. 2, Dec. 15, 2003, 117 Stat. 2637,
    repealed specified laws, except for rights and duties that matured,
    penalties that were incurred, and proceedings that were begun
    before Aug. 21, 2002.

      In this section, the words "and in title III of the Federal
    Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41 U.S.C. 251 et
    seq.)" are added to provide an accurate literal translation of the
    words "this Act", meaning the Federal Property and Administrative
    Services Act of 1949. See the revision note under section 111 of
    this title. The definition of "Administrator" is omitted as
    unnecessary. The text of 40:472(i) is omitted as unnecessary
    because of the definition of "person" in 1:1.
      In clause (6), the words "the Northern Mariana Islands, the
    Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, Palau" are
    substituted for "the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands"
    because of the termination of the Trust Territory of the Pacific
    Islands. See 48:1681 note prec.

      This section is added to provide an accurate literal translation
    of the words "this Act", meaning the Federal Property and
    Administrative Services Act of 1949. In the positive law
    codification of title 40, most of the Federal Property and
    Administrative Services Act of 1949 is restated as subtitle I of
    title 40. However, title III of the Act, which is outside the scope
    of the positive law codification, remains classified to the United
    States Code as 41 U.S.C. 251 et seq. Where the words "this Act" are
    restated, substituting the words "this subtitle" does not yield an
    accurate literal translation because "this subtitle" does not
    include title III of the Act. This section does not subject any
    provision of law to title III of the Act if that provision was not
    subject to title III prior to the positive law codification of
    title 40.

      In subsection (a), the word "paramount" is omitted as included in
    "not subject to any inconsistent provision".
      In subsection (c), the words "chapter 91 of title 31" are
    substituted for "the Government Corporation Control Act (59 Stat.
    597; 31 U.S.C. 841)" in section 602(c) of the Federal Property and
    Administrative Services Act of 1949, because of section 4(b) of the
    Act of September 13, 1982 (Public Law 97-258, 96 Stat. 1067).
      In subsection (e), the text of 40:474(d)(8) is omitted because 50
    App.:1171(b) was repealed by section 53 of the Act of August 10,
    1956 (ch. 1041, 70A Stat. 641). The text of 40:474(d)(19) is
    omitted as obsolete.
      In subsection (e)(2), the words "any phase (including, but not
    limited to, procurement, storage, transportation, processing, and
    disposal) of" and "the fulfillment of" are omitted as unnecessary.
      In subsection (e)(3), the words "chapter 137 of title 10" and
    "that chapter" are substituted for "Armed Services Procurement Act
    of 1947" and "said Act" in section 602(d)(3) of the Federal
    Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, because of
    section 49(b) of the Act of August 10, 1956 (ch. 1041, 70A Stat.
    640).
      In subsection (e)(4), the words "Secretary of Defense" are
    substituted for "National Military Establishment" in section
    602(d)(4) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act
    of 1949, because of section 12(a), (g) of the National Security Act
    Amendments of 1949 (ch. 412, 63 Stat. 591) and because of
    10:113(a).
      In subsection (e)(5), the words "section 2535 of title 10" are
    substituted for "the National Industrial Reserve Act of 1948 [50
    U.S.C. 451 et seq.]" because the National Industrial Reserve Act
    was renamed "Defense Industrial Reserve Act" by section 809 of the
    Department of Defense Appropriation Authorization Act, 1974 (Public
    Law 93-155, 87 Stat. 617), and transferred to section 2535 of title
    10 by section 4235 of the Defense Conversion, Reinvestment and
    Transition Assistance Act of 1992, which was included as Division D
    in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993
    (Public Law 102-484, title XLII, 106 Stat. 2690).
      In subsection (e)(6), the words "the Munitions Board" are omitted
    because sections 1 and 2 of Reorganization Plan No. 6 of 1953 (eff.
    June 30, 1953, 67 Stat. 638) abolished the Munitions Board and
    transferred the Board's functions to the Secretary of Defense.
      In subsection (e)(8), the words "or the Department of
    Agriculture" are omitted as unnecessary because of section 1 of
    Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1953 (eff. June 30, 1953, 67 Stat.
    638). The words "the Act of August 31, 1947, Public Law 298,
    Eightieth Congress, with respect to the disposal of labor supply
    centers, and labor homes, labor camps, or facilities" are omitted
    because the intended reference is probably to the Act of July 31,
    1947 (ch. 413, 61 Stat. 694), which was repealed by section 205(a)
    of the Housing Act of 1950 (ch. 94, 64 Stat. 73).
      In subsection (e)(9), the words "an official or entity under the

    for "the Secretary of Agriculture, Farm Credit Administration, or
    any farm credit board under section 640l(b) of title 12" because
    section 5.40(a), formerly 5.26(a), of the Farm Credit Act of 1971
    (12:2001 note), repealed 12:640l, and provided that "[a]ll
    references in other legislation . . . to the Acts repealed hereby
    shall be deemed to refer to comparable provisions of [the Farm
    Credit Act of 1971 (12 U.S.C. 2001 et seq.)]".
      In subsection (e)(10), the words "Secretary of Housing and Urban
    Development" are substituted for "Department of Housing and Urban
    Development" because of 42:3532. The words "Federal Deposit
    Insurance Corporation" are substituted for "Resolution Trust
    Corporation" because under 12:1441a(m)(1), the Resolution Trust
    Corporation terminated on December 31, 1995, and was succeeded by
    the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
      In subsection (e)(11), the words "property acquired in connection
    with" are substituted for "any property acquired or to be acquired
    for or in connection with" to eliminate unnecessary words.
      In subsection (e)(12), the words "the Secretary of Energy with
    respect to atomic energy" are substituted for "the Atomic Energy
    Commission" because the Atomic Energy Commission was abolished and
    its functions were transferred to the Administrator of the Energy
    Research and Development Administration by section 104 of the
    Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 (42:5814), and the Energy
    Research and Development Administration was subsequently terminated
    and its functions transferred to the Secretary of Energy by
    sections 301(a) and 703 of the Department of Energy Organization
    Act (42:7151(a), 42:7293).
      In subsection (e)(13), the words "Secretary of Transportation"
    are substituted for "Administrator of the Federal Aviation Agency"
    in section 602(d)(14) of the Federal Property and Administrative
    Services Act of 1949 because of sections 3(e) and 6(c)(1) of the
    Department of Transportation Act (Public Law 89-670, 80 Stat. 932,
    938), because of 49:106(f) and (g), and because of 49:ch. 473. The
    words "Secretary of Commerce" are substituted for "Chief of the
    Weather Bureau" in section 602(d)(14) of the Federal Property and
    Administrative Services Act of 1949 because the office of Chief of
    the Weather Bureau was abolished and functions were transferred to
    the Secretary of Commerce by Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1965
    (eff. July 13, 1965, 79 Stat. 1318). The words "section 47301 of
    title 49" are substituted for "the International Aviation
    Facilities Act (62 Stat. 450)" in section 602(d)(14) of the Federal
    Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 because of section
    6(b) of the Act of July 5, 1994 (Public Law 103-272, 108 Stat.
    1378).
      In subsection (e)(17), the words "title 44 or any other law" are
    substituted for "the Act entitled 'An Act providing for the public
    printing and binding and the distribution of public documents'
    approved January 12, 1895 (28 Stat. 601), as amended or any other
    Act" in section 602(d)(18) of the Federal Property and
    Administrative Services Act of 1949 because of section 2(b) of the
    Act of October 22, 1968 (Public Law 90-620, 82 Stat. 1305), the
    first section of which enacted Title 44, United States Code.
      In subsection (e)(19), the words "Secretary of State" are
    substituted for "Director of the International Communication
    Agency" [subsequently changed to "Director of the United States
    Information Agency" because of section 303(b) of the Department of
    State Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1982 and 1983 (Public Law 97-
    241, 96 Stat. 291)] because of 22:6551.

      In subsection (b)(3), the words "Comptroller General" are
    substituted for "General Accounting Office" because of 31:702 and
    for consistency in the revised title.
      In subsection (d)(3), the words "For the fiscal year ending
    September 30, 1997, and thereafter" are omitted as unnecessary.
      In subsection (e)(1)(C), the words "transfer the function from
    one component of the Administration to another" are substituted for
    "from time to time, to regroup, transfer, and distribute any such
    functions within the General Services Administration" (in 40:754
    (1st sentence)) for clarity and to eliminate unnecessary words.
      In subsection (e)(2), subparagraph (A) is substituted for 40:754
    (last sentence) and subparagraph (B) is substituted for 40:486(f)
    to use more consistent terminology and to clarify the requirements
    and applicability of each provision. The words "Director of the
    Office of Management and Budget" are substituted for "Director of
    the Bureau of the Budget" in sections 106 (last sentence) and
    205(f) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of
    1949 because the office of Director of the Bureau of the Budget was
    redesignated the Director of the Office of Management and Budget by
    section 102(b) of Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1970 (84 Stat.
    2085). Section 102 of Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1970, was
    repealed by section 5(b) of the Act of September 13, 1982 (Public
    Law 97-258, 96 Stat. 1085), the first section of which enacted
    Title 31, United States Code, but the successor provision, 31:502,
    continued the designation as Director of the Office of Management
    and Budget.
      In subsection (f), the words "expenses under" are substituted for
    "subsistence, as authorized by" for consistency in the revised
    title. The words "section 5703 of title 5" are substituted for
    "section 5 of the Act of August 2, 1946 (5 U.S.C. 73b-2)" in
    section 205(g) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services
    Act of 1949 because of section 7(b) of the Act of September 6, 1966
    (Public Law 89-554, 80 Stat. 631), the first section of which
    enacted Title 5, United States Code.

                    TERMINATION OF ADVISORY COMMITTEES                
      Advisory committees established after Jan. 5, 1973, to terminate
    not later than the expiration of the 2-year period beginning on the
    date of their establishment, unless, in the case of a committee
    established by the President or an officer of the Federal
    Government, such committee is renewed by appropriate action prior
    to the expiration of such 2-year period, or in the case of a
    committee established by the Congress, its duration is otherwise
    provided by law. See section 14 of Pub. L. 92-463, Oct. 6, 1972, 86
    Stat. 776, set out in the Appendix to Title 5, Government
    Organization and Employees.

-EXEC-
                         EXECUTIVE ORDER NO. 12512                     
      Ex. Ord. No. 12512, Apr. 29, 1985, 50 F.R. 18453, which related
    to Federal real property management, was revoked by Ex. Ord. No.
    13327, Sec. 8, Feb. 4, 2004, 69 F.R. 5897, set out below.

         EX. ORD. NO. 12954. ENSURING THE ECONOMICAL AND EFFICIENT
       ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLETION OF FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS
      Ex. Ord. No. 12954, Mar. 8, 1995, 60 F.R. 13023, provided:
      Efficient economic performance and productivity are directly
    related to the existence of cooperative working relationships
    between employers and employees. When Federal contractors become
    involved in prolonged labor disputes with their employees, the
    Federal Government's economy, efficiency, and cost of operations
    are adversely affected. In order to operate as effectively as
    possible, by receiving timely goods and quality services, the
    Federal Government must assist the entities with which it has
    contractual relations to develop stable relationships with their
    employees.
      An important aspect of a stable collective bargaining
    relationship is the balance between allowing businesses to operate
    during a strike and preserving worker rights. This balance is
    disrupted when permanent replacement employees are hired. It has
    been found that strikes involving permanent replacement workers are
    longer in duration than other strikes. In addition, the use of
    permanent replacements can change a limited dispute into a broader,
    more contentious struggle, thereby exacerbating the problems that
    initially led to the strike. By permanently replacing its workers,
    an employer loses the accumulated knowledge, experience, skill, and
    expertise of its incumbent employees. These circumstances then
    adversely affect the businesses and entities, such as the Federal
    Government, which rely on that employer to provide high quality and
    reliable goods or services.
      NOW, THEREFORE, to ensure the economical and efficient
    administration and completion of Federal Government contracts, and
    by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and
    the laws of the United States of America, including 40 U.S.C.
    486(a) [now 40 U.S.C. 121(a)] and 3 U.S.C. 301, it is hereby
    ordered as follows:
      Section 1. It is the policy of the executive branch in procuring
    goods and services that, to ensure the economical and efficient
    administration and completion of Federal Government contracts,
    contracting agencies shall not contract with employers that
    permanently replace lawfully striking employees. All discretion
    under this Executive order shall be exercised consistent with this
    policy.
      Sec. 2. (a) The Secretary of Labor ("Secretary") may investigate
    an organizational unit of a Federal contractor to determine whether
    the unit has permanently replaced lawfully striking workers. Such
    investigation shall be conducted in accordance with procedures
    established by the Secretary.
      (b) The Secretary shall receive and may investigate complaints by
    employees of any entity covered under section 2(a) of this order
    where such complaints allege lawfully striking employees have been
    permanently replaced.
      (c) The Secretary may hold such hearings, public or private, as
    he or she deems advisable, to determine whether an entity covered
    under section 2(a) has permanently replaced lawfully striking
    employees.
      Sec. 3. (a) When the Secretary determines that a contractor has
    permanently replaced lawfully striking employees, the Secretary may
    make a finding that it is appropriate to terminate the contract for
    convenience. The Secretary shall transmit that finding to the head
    of any department or agency that contracts with the contractor.
      (b) The head of the contracting department or agency may object
    to the termination for convenience of a contract or contracts of a
    contractor determined to have permanently replaced legally striking
    employees. If the head of the agency so objects, he or she shall
    set forth the reasons for not terminating the contract or contracts
    in a response in writing to the Secretary. In such case, the
    termination for convenience shall not be issued. The head of the
    contracting agency or department shall report to the Secretary
    those contracts that have been terminated for convenience under
    this section.
      Sec. 4. (a) When the Secretary determines that a contractor has
    permanently replaced lawfully striking employees, the Secretary may
    debar the contractor, thereby making the contractor ineligible to
    receive government contracts. The Secretary shall notify the
    Administrator of the General Services Administration of the
    debarment, and the Administrator shall include the contractor on
    the consolidated list of debarred contractors. Departments and
    agencies shall not solicit offers from, award contracts to, or
    consent to subcontracts with these contractors unless the head of
    the agency or his or her designee determines, in writing, that
    there is a compelling reason for such action, in accordance with
    the Federal Acquisition Regulation.
      (b) The scope of the debarment normally will be limited to those
    organizational units of a Federal contractor that the Secretary
    finds to have permanently replaced lawfully striking workers.
      (c) The period of the debarment may not extend beyond the date
    when the labor dispute precipitating the permanent replacement of
    lawfully striking workers has been resolved, as determined by the
    Secretary.
      Sec. 5. The Secretary shall publish or cause to be published, in
    the Federal Register, the names of contractors that have, in the
    judgement of the Secretary, permanently replaced lawfully striking
    employees and have been the subject of debarment.
      Sec. 6. The Secretary shall be responsible for the administration
    and enforcement of this order. The Secretary, after consultation
    with the Secretary of Defense, the Administrator of the General
    Services, the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space
    Administration, and the Administrator of the Office of Federal
    Procurement Policy, may adopt such rules and regulations and issue
    such orders as may be deemed necessary and appropriate to achieve
    the purposes of this order.
      Sec. 7. Each contracting department and agency shall cooperate
    with the Secretary and provide such information and assistance as
    the Secretary may require in the performance of the Secretary's
    functions under this order.
      Sec. 8. The Secretary may delegate any function or duty of the
    Secretary under this order to any officer in the Department of
    Labor or to any other officer in the executive branch of the
    Government, with the consent of the head of the department or
    agency in which that officer serves.
      Sec. 9. The Secretary of Defense, the Administrator of the
    General Services, and the Administrator of the National Aeronautics
    and Space Administration, after consultation with the Administrator
    of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy, shall take whatever
    action is appropriate to implement the provisions of this order and
    of any related rules, regulations, or orders of the Secretary
    issued pursuant to this order.
      Sec. 10. This order is not intended, and should not be construed,
    to create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural,
    enforceable at law by a party against the United States, its
    agencies, its officers, or its employees. This order is not
    intended, however, to preclude judicial review of final agency
    decisions in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, 5
    U.S.C. 701 et seq.
      Sec. 11. The meaning of the term "organizational unit of a
    Federal contractor" as used in this order shall be defined in
    regulations that shall be issued by the Secretary of Labor, in
    consultation with affected agencies. This order shall apply only to
    contracts in excess of the Simplified Acquisition Threshold.
      Sec. 12. (a) The provisions of section 3 of this order shall only
    apply to situations in which contractors have permanently replaced
    lawfully striking employees after the effective date of this order.
      (b) This order is effective immediately.
                                                     William J. Clinton.

        EX. ORD. NO. 13327. FEDERAL REAL PROPERTY ASSET MANAGEMENT    
      Ex. Ord. No. 13327, Feb. 4, 2004, 69 F.R. 5897, provided:
      By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution
    and the laws of the United States of America, including section
    121(a) of title 40, United States Code, and in order to promote the
    efficient and economical use of Federal real property resources in
    accordance with their value as national assets and in the best
    interests of the Nation, it is hereby ordered as follows:
      Section 1. Policy. It is the policy of the United States to
    promote the efficient and economical use of America's real property
    assets and to assure management accountability for implementing
    Federal real property management reforms. Based on this policy,
    executive branch departments and agencies shall recognize the
    importance of real property resources through increased management
    attention, the establishment of clear goals and objectives,
    improved policies and levels of accountability, and other
    appropriate action.
      Sec. 2. Definition and Scope. (a) For the purpose of this
    executive order, Federal real property is defined as any real
    property owned, leased, or otherwise managed by the Federal
    Government, both within and outside the United States, and
    improvements on Federal lands. For the purpose of this order,
    Federal real property shall exclude: interests in real property
    assets that have been disposed of for public benefit purposes
    pursuant to section 484 of title 40, United States Code [now 40
    U.S.C. 541-555], and are now held in private ownership; land
    easements or rights-of-way held by the Federal Government; public
    domain land (including lands withdrawn for military purposes) or
    land reserved or dedicated for national forest, national park, or
    national wildlife refuge purposes except for improvements on those
    lands; land held in trust or restricted fee status for individual
    Indians or Indian tribes; and land and interests in land that are
    withheld from the scope of this order by agency heads for reasons
    of national security, foreign policy, or public safety.
      (b) This order shall not be interpreted to supersede any existing
    authority under law or by executive order for real property asset
    management, with the exception of the revocation of Executive Order
    12512 of April 29, 1985 [formerly set out as a note above], in
    section 8 of this order.
      Sec. 3. Establishment and Responsibilities of Agency Senior Real
    Property Officer. (a) The heads of all executive branch departments
    and agencies cited in sections 901(b)(1) and (b)(2) of title 31,
    United States Code, and the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall
    designate among their senior management officials, a Senior Real
    Property Officer. Such officer shall have the education, training,
    and experience required to administer the necessary functions of
    the position for the particular agency.
      (b) The Senior Real Property Officer shall develop and implement
    an agency asset management planning process that meets the form,
    content, and other requirements established by the Federal Real
    Property Council established in section 4 of this order. The
    initial agency asset management plan will be submitted to the
    Office of Management and Budget on a date determined by the
    Director of the Office of Management and Budget. In developing this
    plan, the Senior Real Property Officer shall:
      (i) identify and categorize all real property owned, leased, or
    otherwise managed by the agency, including, where applicable, those
    properties outside the United States in which the lease agreements
    and arrangements reflect the host country currency or involve
    alternative lease plans or rental agreements;
      (ii) prioritize actions to be taken to improve the operational
    and financial management of the agency's real property inventory;
      (iii) make life-cycle cost estimations associated with the
    prioritized actions;
      (iv) identify legislative authorities that are required to
    address these priorities;
      (v) identify and pursue goals, with appropriate deadlines,
    consistent with and supportive of the agency's asset management
    plan and measure progress against such goals;
      (vi) incorporate planning and management requirements for
    historic property under Executive Order 13287 of March 3, 2003 [16
    U.S.C. 470h-2 note], and for environmental management under
    Executive Order 13148 of April 21, 2000 [42 U.S.C. 4321 note]; and
      (vii) identify any other information and pursue any other actions
    necessary to the appropriate development and implementation of the
    agency asset management plan.
      (c) The Senior Real Property Officer shall be responsible, on an
    ongoing basis, for monitoring the real property assets of the
    agency so that agency assets are managed in a manner that is:
      (i) consistent with, and supportive of, the goals and objectives
    set forth in the agency's overall strategic plan under section 306
    of title 5, United States Code;
      (ii) consistent with the real property asset management
    principles developed by the Federal Real Property Council
    established in section 4 of this order; and
      (iii) reflected in the agency asset management plan.
      (d) The Senior Real Property Officer shall, on an annual basis,
    provide to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and
    the Administrator of General Services:
      (i) information that lists and describes real property assets
    under the jurisdiction, custody, or control of that agency, except
    for classified information; and
      (ii) any other relevant information the Director of the Office of
    Management and Budget or the Administrator of General Services may
    request for inclusion in the Government-wide listing of all Federal
    real property assets and leased property.
      (e) The designation of the Senior Real Property Officer shall be
    made by agencies within 30 days after the date of this order.
      Sec. 4. Establishment of a Federal Real Property Council. (a) A
    Federal Real Property Council (Council) is established, within the
    Office of Management and Budget for administrative purposes, to
    develop guidance for, and facilitate the success of, each agency's
    asset management plan. The Council shall be composed exclusively of
    all agency Senior Real Property Officers, the Controller of the
    Office of Management and Budget, the Administrator of General
    Services, and any other full-time or permanent part-time Federal
    officials or employees as deemed necessary by the Chairman of the
    Council. The Deputy Director for Management of the Office of
    Management and Budget shall also be a member and shall chair the
    Council. The Office of Management and Budget shall provide funding
    and administrative support for the Council, as appropriate.
      (b) The Council shall provide a venue for assisting the Senior
    Real Property Officers in the development and implementation of the
    agency asset management plans. The Council shall work with the
    Administrator of General Services to establish appropriate
    performance measures to determine the effectiveness of Federal real
    property management. Such performance measures shall include, but
    are not limited to, evaluating the costs and benefits involved with
    acquiring, repairing, maintaining, operating, managing, and
    disposing of Federal real properties at particular agencies.
    Specifically, the Council shall consider, as appropriate, the
    following performance measures:
      (i) life-cycle cost estimations associated with the agency's
    prioritized actions;
      (ii) the costs relating to the acquisition of real property
    assets by purchase, condemnation, exchange, lease, or otherwise;
      (iii) the cost and time required to dispose of Federal real
    property assets and the financial recovery of the Federal
    investment resulting from the disposal;
      (iv) the operating, maintenance, and security costs at Federal
    properties, including but not limited to the costs of utility
    services at unoccupied properties;
      (v) the environmental costs associated with ownership of
    property, including the costs of environmental restoration and
    compliance activities;
      (vi) changes in the amounts of vacant Federal space;
      (vii) the realization of equity value in Federal real property
    assets;
      (viii) opportunities for cooperative arrangements with the
    commercial real estate community; and
      (ix) the enhancement of Federal agency productivity through an
    improved working environment. The performance measures shall be
    designed to enable the heads of executive branch agencies to track
    progress in the achievement of Government-wide property management
    objectives, as well as allow for comparing the performance of
    executive branch agencies against industry and other public sector
    agencies.
      (c) The Council shall serve as a clearinghouse for executive
    agencies for best practices in evaluating actual progress in the
    implementation of real property enhancements. The Council shall
    also work in conjunction with the President's Management Council to
    assist the efforts of the Senior Real Property Officials and the
    implementation of agency asset management plans.
      (d) The Council shall be organized and hold its first meeting
    within 60 days of the date of this order. The Council shall hold
    meetings not less often than once a quarter each fiscal year.
      Sec. 5. Role of the General Services Administration. (a) The
    Administrator of General Services shall, to the extent permitted by
    law and in consultation with the Federal Real Property Council,
    provide policy oversight and guidance for executive agencies for
    Federal real property management; manage selected properties for an
    agency at the request of that agency and with the consent of the
    Administrator; delegate operational responsibilities to an agency
    where the Administrator determines it will promote efficiency and
    economy, and where the receiving agency has demonstrated the
    ability and willingness to assume such responsibilities; and
    provide necessary leadership in the development and maintenance of
    needed property management information systems.
      (b) The Administrator of General Services shall publish common
    performance measures and standards adopted by the Council.
      (c) The Administrator of General Services, in consultation with
    the Federal Real Property Council, shall establish and maintain a
    single, comprehensive, and descriptive database of all real
    property under the custody and control of all executive branch
    agencies, except when otherwise required for reasons of national
    security. The Administrator shall collect from each executive
    branch agency such descriptive information, except for classified
    information, as the Administrator considers will best describe the
    nature, use, and extent of the real property holdings of the
    Federal Government.
      (d) The Administrator of General Services, in consultation with
    the Federal Real Property Council, may establish data and other
    information technology (IT) standards for use by Federal agencies
    in developing or upgrading Federal agency real property information
    systems in order to facilitate reporting on a uniform basis. Those
    agencies with particular IT standards and systems in place and in
    use shall be allowed to continue with such use to the extent that
    they are compatible with the standards issued by the Administrator.
      Sec. 6. General Provisions. (a) The Director of the Office of
    Management and Budget shall review, through the management and
    budget review processes, the efforts of departments and agencies in
    implementing their asset management plans and achieving the
    Government-wide property management policies established pursuant
    to this order.
      (b) The Office of Management and Budget and the General Services
    Administration shall, in consultation with the landholding
    agencies, develop legislative initiatives that seek to improve
    Federal real property management through the adoption of
    appropriate industry management techniques and the establishment of
    managerial accountability for implementing effective and efficient
    real property management practices.
      (c) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or
    otherwise affect the authority of the Director of the Office of
    Management and Budget with respect to budget, administrative, or
    legislative proposals.
      (d) Nothing in this order shall be construed to affect real
    property for the use of the President, Vice President, or, for
    protective purposes, the United States Secret Service.
      Sec. 7. Public Lands. In order to ensure that Federally owned
    lands, other than the real property covered by this order, are
    managed in the most effective and economic manner, the Departments
    of Agriculture and the Interior shall take such steps as are
    appropriate to improve their management of public lands and
    National Forest System lands and shall develop appropriate
    legislative proposals necessary to facilitate that result.
      Sec. 8. Executive Order 12512 of April 29, 1985, is hereby
    revoked.
      Sec. 9. Judicial Review. This order is intended only to improve
    the internal management of the executive branch and is not intended
    to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or
    procedural, enforceable at law or in equity, against the United
    States, its departments, agencies, or other entities, its officers
    or employees, or any other person.

      In subsection (a), before clause (1), the words "under this
    subtitle" are substituted for "hereunder" because "hereunder"
    probably means under the Federal Property and Administrative
    Services Act of 1949 which is restated in subtitle I of the revised
    title (except as noted in section 111 of the revised title and the
    accompanying revision note). The words "or engage in", "or engaged
    in", "securing or", and "secure or" are omitted as unnecessary. The
    word "money" is substituted for "payment" for consistency in the
    section.
      In subsection (a)(1)(B), the words "because of each act" are
    substituted for "by reason thereof" for clarity.
      In subsection (a)(2), the words "or any Federal agency" and "or
    any Federal agency, as the case may be" are omitted as unnecessary.

    substituted for "thus secured and obtained" for clarity and to
    eliminate unnecessary words.

    "a district court of the United States" because of sections 88 and
    132(a) of title 28.
      Subsection (d)(2) is substituted for "[D]istrict courts . . .
    within whose jurisdictional limits the person, or persons, doing or
    committing such act, or any one of them, resides or shall be found,
    shall wheresoever such act may have been done or committed, have
    full power and jurisdiction to hear, try, and determine such suit"
    for clarity and to use terminology consistent with title 28,
    especially 28:1331 and 1391(b).
      In subsection (d)(3), the words "A defendant that does not reside
    and may not be found in the court's judicial district" are
    substituted for "and such person or persons as are not inhabitants
    of or found within the district in which suit is brought" for
    clarity and to use terminology consistent with title 28, especially
    28:1331 and 1391(b).

                         MESSAGE OF THE PRESIDENT                     
    To the Congress of the United States:
      I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 18 of 1950, prepared
    in accordance with the provisions of the Reorganization Act of
    1949. The plan transfers to the Administrator of General Services
    the functions of the various Federal agencies with respect to
    leasing and assigning general-purpose space in buildings and the
    operation, maintenance, and custody of office buildings. Since such
    authority is already largely concentrated in the General Services
    Administration with respect to the District of Columbia, the plan
    principally relates to the administration of these functions in the
    field.
      The transfers made by this plan will promote more economical
    leasing, better utilization of building space, and more efficient
    operation of Government-controlled office buildings. They will
    effectuate the recommendations of the Commission on Organization of
    the Executive Branch of the Government with respect to
    concentrating in the General Services Administration the
    responsibility for space allotment and the operation of Government
    buildings outside of the District of Columbia. Likewise, they will
    extend the principles laid down by the Congress in enacting the
    Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 to another
    important area of Government-wide administrative services - the
    administration of Government office buildings and general-purpose
    building space in the field.
      Within the District of Columbia, one agency, the Public Buildings
    Service of the General Services Administration, has long had the
    operation and custody of most Government buildings and the leasing
    and assignment of space for executive agencies. Thus, nearly all
    requests for building space are handled by a single organization
    which is responsible for seeing that agencies are properly and
    efficiently housed. This arrangement has proved its worth and has
    repeatedly been approved by the Congress.
      Outside of the National Capital, however, responsibility for the
    acquisition and control of building space and the operation of
    Government buildings is widely diffused. A variety of agencies
    operate and control general-purpose buildings. If quarters are not
    available in Federal buildings, each agency ordinarily does its own
    leasing. As a result, in some cases Federal agencies have
    contracted for space at high rentals at the very time that other
    agencies have been giving up surplus low-cost space.
      The assignment of space in Government-owned buildings outside of
    Washington is also divided among a number of agencies. While the
    Public Buildings Service constructs a large part of the Government
    buildings, it operates and controls the assignment of space in only
    a small proportion of them. The Post Office Department operates and
    allocates the space in post-office buildings, several hundred of
    which contain substantial amounts of office space available for
    other agencies. During and immediately after the war several other
    Federal agencies acquired office buildings in the field. As their
    activities have contracted, surplus space in many of these
    structures has become available for other uses.
      This plan concentrates in the General Services Administration the
    responsibility for the leasing and assignment of what is termed
    general-purpose building space; that is, space which is suitable
    for the uses of a number of Federal agencies. It specifically
    excludes space in buildings at military posts, arsenals, navy
    yards, and similar defense installations and space in hospitals,
    laboratories, factories, and other special-purpose buildings.
      Also, the plan excludes the Post Office Department from the
    transfer of leasing authority since the Department has a highly
    developed organization for this purpose, and it limits the transfer
    of space assignment authority in post-office buildings to the space
    not occupied by the Department. Further, it gives the needs of the
    Post Office Department priority in the assignment of space in post-
    office buildings. Thus, the plan amply safeguards the interests of
    the Post Office Department while making it possible to include the
    general office space in post-office buildings in any given city
    with other similar space under Federal control in planning and
    executing an efficient program for housing Government agencies in
    that area.
      In addition, the plan transfers to the General Services
    Administration the operation, maintenance, and custody of office
    buildings owned or leased by the Government, including those post-
    office buildings which are not used predominantly for post-office
    purposes. This will make it possible to establish a single
    organization for the operation and maintenance of Government office
    buildings in principal cities in the field as has proved desirable
    in the National Capital. Since many post offices are in fact
    primarily large office buildings, the plan includes in this
    transfer the post-office buildings which are not used predominantly
    for post-office purposes. This will relieve the Post Office
    Department of a considerable expenditure for building operation and
    maintenance which properly should not be charged against postal
    revenues.
      While the plan effects a broad transfer of functions with respect
    to leasing and assignment of space and the operation and
    maintenance of office buildings, it specifically authorizes the
    Administrator of General Services to delegate the performance of
    any part of these functions to other agencies subject to such
    regulations as he deems desirable for economical and effective
    administration. In this the plan follows the pattern adopted by the
    Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 for other
    branches of property management. In large urban centers where
    numerous Federal units are located unified administration of space
    activities by the General Services Administration will normally be
    advantageous. On the other hand, in the smaller communities it will
    no doubt be desirable to delegate the work back to the agencies
    directly affected, to be carried on under standards laid down by
    the Administrator of General Services. The plan provides ample
    flexibility for working out the most effective administrative
    arrangement for each type of situation.
      The fundamental soundness and economy of centralized
    administration of building space have been amply demonstrated in
    the National Capital. By virtue of unified control it has been
    possible since the war to accomplish far-reaching changes which
    have consolidated agencies in much fewer locations, released many
    of the rented buildings, and greatly reduced the cost of housing
    the Government establishment. Similar procedures applied in the
    larger centers of field activity should produce substantial
    savings.
      After investigation, I have found, and hereby declare, that each
    reorganization contained in this plan is necessary to accomplish
    one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the
    Reorganization Act of 1949.
      While it is not possible at this time to calculate the reduction
    in expenditures which will result from this plan, it can safely be
    predicted that it will produce substantial savings. I am confident
    that this reorganization plan will constitute a significant
    improvement in Federal business practice and will bring about an
    important increase in efficiency in housing Government agencies.
                                                         Harry S Truman.

      In subsections (a) and (b), the words "and title III of the
    Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41 U.S.C.
    251 et seq.)" are added to provide an accurate literal translation
    of the words "this Act", meaning the Federal Property and
    Administrative Services Act of 1949. See the revision note under
    section 111 of this title. Reference to title V of this Act is
    omitted as obsolete because of the Act of October 22, 1968 (Public
    Law 90-620, 82 Stat. 1238), the first section of which enacted
    Title 44, United States Code. The responsibilities of the
    Administrator of General Services under title V were given to the
    Archivist of the United States, National Historical Publications
    and Records Commission, and Advisory Committee on the Records of
    Congress.
      In subsection (a), the words "subject to chapters 33 and 51 and
    subchapter III of chapter 53 of title 5" are substituted for
    "subject to the civil-service and classification laws" because of
    section 7(b) of the Act of September 6, 1966 (Public Law 89-554, 80
    Stat. 631), the first section of which enacted Title 5, United
    States Code.
      In subsection (b), the words "under section 3109 of title 5" are
    substituted for "(not in excess of one year)" and "or organizations
    thereof, including stenographic reporting services, by contract or
    appointment, and in such cases such service shall be without regard
    to the civil-service and classification laws, and except in the
    case of stenographic reporting services by organizations, without
    regard to section 5 of title 41" for clarity and to eliminate
    unnecessary words.
      In subsection (c), the words "section 973 of title 10" are
    substituted for "section 1222 of the Revised Statutes (10 U. S. C.
    576)" in section 208(c) of the Federal Property and Administrative
    Services Act of 1949 because of section 49(b) of the Act of August
    10, 1956 (ch. 1041, 70A Stat. 640), the first section of which
    enacted Title 10, United States Code, and section 4(a)(5) and (6)
    of the Act of January 2, 1968 (Public Law 90-235, 81 Stat. 759).
    The words "personnel (including armed services personnel) from an
    executive agency other than the General Services Administration"
    are substituted for "officials, officers, and other personnel in
    other executive agencies, including personnel of the armed
    services" for clarity and to eliminate unnecessary words.
      In subsection (d), the words "On and after June 23, 1913" are
    omitted as obsolete. The word "Administrator" is substituted for
    "Secretary of the Treasury" [subsequently changed to "Federal Works
    Administrator" because of section 301 of Reorganization Plan No. I
    of 1939 (eff. July 1, 1939, 53 Stat. 1426)], and the word
    "Administration" [meaning the General Services Administration] is
    substituted for "public-buildings service" and "Office of the
    Supervising Architect" [subsequently changed to "Public Buildings
    Administration" because of section 1 of Executive Order No. 6166
    (eff. June 10, 1933) and section 303 of Reorganization Plan No. I
    of 1939 (eff. July 1, 1939, 53 Stat. 1427)], because of section
    103(a) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of
    1949 (ch. 288, 63 Stat. 380), which is restated as section 303(c)
    [303(b)] of the revised title. The words "such as supervising
    superintendents, superintendents, junior superintendents, and
    inspectors of the several classes" are omitted as unnecessary.

    over the useful life of the equipment, as determined by the
    Administrator, in consultation with the Sergeant at Arms and
    Doorkeeper of the Senate or the Chief Administrative Officer of the
    House of Representatives, as appropriate.
      (f) Transfer of Uncommitted Balances. - Following the close of
    each fiscal year, after making provision for a sufficient level of
    inventory of personal property to meet the needs of Federal
    agencies, the replacement cost of motor vehicles, and other
    anticipated operating needs reflected in the cost and capital plan
    developed under subsection (b), the uncommitted balance of any
    funds remaining in the Fund shall be transferred to the general
    fund of the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts.
      (g) Audits. - The Comptroller General shall audit the Fund in
    accordance with the provisions of chapter 35 of title 31 and report

      In subsection (a)(1)(B), the words "from time to time" are
    omitted as unnecessary. The words "Director of the Office of
    Management and Budget" are substituted for "Director of the Bureau
    of the Budget" in section 206(a)(2) of the Federal Property and
    Administrative Services Act of 1949 because the office of Director
    of the Bureau of the Budget was redesignated the Director of the
    Office of Management and Budget by section 102(b) of Reorganization
    Plan No. 2 of 1970 (eff. July 1, 1970, 84 Stat. 2085). Section 102
    of Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1970, was repealed by section 5(b)
    of the Act of September 13, 1982 (Public Law 97-258, 96 Stat.
    1085), the first section of which enacted Title 31, United States
    Code, but the successor provision, 31:502, continued the
    designation as Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
      In subsection (a)(1)(D), the words "Subject to regulations" are
    substituted for "subject to regulations and regulations" in section
    206(a)(4) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act
    of 1949 to correct an error resulting from an inconsistency between
    section 8(d)(1) and section 9(a)(2) of the Office of Federal
    Procurement Policy Act Amendments of 1983 (Public Law 98-191, 97
    Stat. 1331).
      In subsection (a)(2)(A), the words "Department of Defense" are
    substituted for "National Military Establishment" in section 206(a)
    of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949
    because the Department of Defense is deemed to succeed the National
    Military Establishment under section 12(a) and (g) of the National
    Security Act Amendments of 1949 (ch. 412, 63 Stat. 591).
      In subsection (c), the words "Comptroller General" are
    substituted for "General Accounting Office" because of 31:702 and
    for consistency in the revised title.

    notification under paragraph (1), notifies the Administrator that
    the Government of Guam intends to acquire the property under this
    section, the Administrator shall transfer such property in
    accordance with subsection (b). Otherwise, the property shall be

    Act.
      "(b) Conditions of Transfer. - (1) Any transfer of excess real
    property to the Government of Guam may be only for a public purpose
    and shall be without further consideration.
      "(2) All transfers of excess real property to the Government of

    property is compatible with continued military activities on Guam;

    condition of the property; (C) access is available to the United
    States to conduct any additional environmental remediation or

    a public purpose and can not be converted to any other use; and (E)
    to the extent that facilities on the property have been occupied
    and used by another Federal agency for a minimum of 2 years, that
    the transfer to the Government of Guam is subject to the terms and
    conditions for such use and occupancy.
      "(3) All transfers of excess real property to the Government of
    Guam are subject to all otherwise applicable Federal laws, except

        "(4) The term 'Guam National Wildlife Refuge' includes those
      lands within the refuge overlay under the jurisdiction of the
      Department of Defense, identified as DoD lands in figure 3, on

      Wildlife Refuge, Territory of Guam, July 1993' to the extent that
      the Federal Government holds title to such lands.
        "(5) The term 'public purpose' means those public benefit
      purposes for which the United States may dispose of property

      the following procedure:
          "(A) The Administrator shall notify the Government of Guam
        and the Fish and Wildlife Service that such property has been
        declared excess. The Government of Guam and the Fish and
        Wildlife Service shall have 180 days to engage in discussions

          "(C) If the parties do not reach an agreement under

        recommendations on the likelihood of resolution of differences
        and the comments of the Fish and Wildlife Service and the
        Government of Guam. If the subject property is under the
        jurisdiction of a military department, the military department
        may transfer administrative control over the property to the
        General Services Administration subject to any terms and
        conditions applicable to such property. In the event of such a
        transfer by a military department to the General Services
        Administration, the Department of the Interior shall be
        responsible for all reasonable costs associated with the
        custody, accountability and control of such property until
        final disposition.
          "(D) If the parties come to agreement prior to congressional

        shall be transmitted to the Committee on Energy and Natural

        the property, such property may not be transferred to another
        Federal agency or out of Federal ownership except pursuant to
        an Act of Congress specifically identifying such property;
        "(3) to real property described in the Guam Excess Lands Act
      (Public Law 103-339; 108 Stat. 3116) which shall be disposed of
      in accordance with such Act;
        "(4) to real property on Guam that is declared excess as a
      result of a base closure law; or

      In subsection (a), the words "Director of the Office of
    Management and Budget" are substituted for "Director of the Bureau
    of the Budget" in section 202(a)(1) (last sentence) of the Federal
    Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 because the office
    of Director of the Bureau of the Budget was redesignated the

    as (c) by the Act of August 31, 1954 (ch.1178, 68 Stat. 1051).
      In subsection (b)(2)(A), the words "chapter 91 of title 31" are

    Sec. 545. Procedure for disposal

-STATUTE-
      (a) Public Advertising for Bids. - 
        (1) Requirement. - 
          (A) In general. - Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the
        Administrator of General Services may make or authorize a
        disposal or a contract for disposal of surplus property only
        after public advertising for bids, under regulations the
        Administrator prescribes.
          (B) Exceptions. - This subsection does not apply to disposal
        or a contract for disposal of surplus property - 
            (i) under subsection (b) or (d); or
            (ii) by abandonment, destruction, or donation or through a
          contract broker.

        (2) Time, method, and terms. - The time, method, and terms and
      conditions of advertisement must permit full and free competition
      consistent with the value and nature of the property involved.
        (3) Public disclosure. - Bids must be publicly disclosed at the
      time and place stated in the advertisement.
        (4) Awards. - An award shall be made with reasonable promptness
      by notice to the responsible bidder whose bid, conforming to the
      invitation for bids, is most advantageous to the Federal
      Government, price and other factors considered. However, all bids
      may be rejected if it is in the public interest to do so.

      (b) Negotiated Disposal. - Under regulations the Administrator
    prescribes, disposals and contracts for disposal may be negotiated
    without regard to subsection (a), but subject to obtaining
    competition that is feasible under the circumstances, if - 
        (1) necessary in the public interest - 
          (A) during the period of a national emergency declared by the
        President or Congress, with respect to a particular lot of
        personal property; or
          (B) for a period not exceeding three months, with respect to
        a specifically described category of personal property as
        determined by the Administrator;

        (2) the public health, safety, or national security will be
      promoted by a particular disposal of personal property;
        (3) public exigency will not allow delay incident to
      advertising certain personal property;
        (4) the nature and quantity of personal property involved are
      such that disposal under subsection (a) would impact an industry
      to an extent that would adversely affect the national economy,
      and the estimated fair market value of the property and other
      satisfactory terms of disposal can be obtained by negotiation;
        (5) the estimated fair market value of the property involved
      does not exceed $15,000;
        (6) after advertising under subsection (a), the bid prices for
      the property, or part of the property, are not reasonable or have
      not been independently arrived at in open competition;
        (7) with respect to real property, the character or condition
      of the property or unusual circumstances make it impractical to
      advertise publicly for competitive bids and the fair market value
      of the property and other satisfactory terms of disposal can be
      obtained by negotiation;
        (8) the disposal will be to a State, territory, or possession
      of the United States, or to a political subdivision of, or a tax-
      supported agency in, a State, territory, or possession, and the
      estimated fair market value of the property and other
      satisfactory terms of disposal are obtained by negotiation; or
        (9) otherwise authorized by law.

      (c) Disposal Through Contract Brokers. - Disposals and contracts
    for disposal of surplus real and related personal property through
    contract realty brokers employed by the Administrator shall be made
    in the manner followed in similar commercial transactions under
    regulations the Administrator prescribes. The regulations must
    require that brokers give wide public notice of the availability of
    the property for disposal.
      (d) Negotiated Sale at Fixed Price. - 
        (1) Authorization. - The Administrator may make a negotiated
      sale of personal property at a fixed price, either directly or
      through the use of a disposal contractor, without regard to
      subsection (a). However, the sale must be publicized to an extent
      consistent with the value and nature of the property involved and
      the price established must reflect the estimated fair market
      value of the property. Sales under this subsection are limited to
      categories of personal property for which the Administrator
      determines that disposal under this subsection best serves the
      interests of the Government.
        (2) First offer. - Under regulations and restrictions the
      Administrator prescribes, an opportunity to purchase property at
      a fixed price under this subsection may be offered first to an
      entity specified in subsection (b)(8) that has expressed an
      interest in the property.

      (e) Explanatory Statements for Negotiated Disposals. - 
        (1) Requirement. - 
          (A) In general. - Except as provided in subparagraph (B), an
        explanatory statement of the circumstances shall be prepared
        for each disposal by negotiation of - 
            (i) personal property that has an estimated fair market
          value in excess of $15,000;
            (ii) real property that has an estimated fair market value
          in excess of $100,000, except that real property disposed of
          by lease or exchange is subject only to clauses (iii)-(v) of
          this subparagraph;
            (iii) real property disposed of by lease for a term of not
          more than 5 years, if the estimated fair annual rent is more
          than $100,000 for any year;
            (iv) real property disposed of by lease for a term of more
          than 5 years, if the total estimated rent over the term of
          the lease is more than $100,000; or
            (v) real property or real and related personal property
          disposed of by exchange, regardless of value, or any property
          for which any part of the consideration is real property.

          (B) Exception. - An explanatory statement is not required for
        a disposal of personal property under subsection (d), or for a
        disposal of real or personal property authorized by any other
        law to be made without advertising.

        (2) Transmittal to congress. - The explanatory statement shall
      be transmitted to the appropriate committees of Congress in
      advance of the disposal, and a copy of the statement shall be
      preserved in the files of the executive agency making the
      disposal.
        (3) Listing in report. - A report of the Administrator under
      section 126 of this title must include a listing and description

-STATUTE-
      (a) Policies. - The Administrator of General Services shall
    consult with the Secretary of Agriculture to formulate policies for
    the disposal of surplus agricultural commodities, surplus foods
    processed from agricultural commodities, and surplus cotton or
    woolen goods. The policies shall be formulated to prevent surplus
    agricultural commodities, or surplus foods processed from

    commodities.
      (b) Transfers to Department of Agriculture. - 
        (1) In general. - The Administrator shall transfer without
      charge to the Department of Agriculture any surplus agricultural
      commodities, foods, and cotton or woolen goods for disposal, when
      the Secretary determines that a transfer is necessary for the
      Secretary to carry out responsibilities for price support or
      stabilization.
        (2) Deposit of receipts. - Receipts resulting from disposal by
      the Department under this subsection shall be deposited pursuant
      to any authority available to the Secretary. When applicable,
      however, net proceeds from the sale of surplus property
      transferred under this subsection shall be credited pursuant to
      section 572(a) of this title.
        (3) Limitation of sales. - Surplus farm commodities transferred
      under this subsection may not be sold, other than for export, in
      quantities exceeding, or at prices less than, the applicable
      quantities and prices for sales of those commodities by the
      Commodity Credit Corporation.

    apply:
        (1) Public agency. - The term "public agency" means - 
          (A) a State;
          (B) a political subdivision of a State (including a unit of
        local government or economic development district);
          (C) a department, agency, or instrumentality of a State
        (including instrumentalities created by compact or other
        agreement between States or political subdivisions); or
          (D) an Indian tribe, band, group, pueblo, or community
        located on a state reservation.

        (2) State. - The term "State" means a State of the United

      under this section.

      (b) Authorization. - 
        (1) In general. - The Administrator of General Services, in the

        (2) Property. - 
          (A) In general. - Property referred to in paragraph (1) is

          (B) Special rule. - In determining whether the property is to

          U.S.C. 470w-7(e)(2)), including a historic light station
          conveyed under subsection (b) of that section,
          notwithstanding the number of hours that the historic light
          station is open to the public.

        (4) Exception. - This subsection does not apply to property
      transferred under subsection (d).

      (d) Department of Defense Property. -

      including maritime academies, or military, naval, Air Force, or
      Coast Guard preparatory schools.
        (2) Property usable for special interest activities. - If the
      Secretary of Defense determines that the property is usable and
      necessary for educational activities which are of special
      interest to the armed services, the Secretary shall allocate the
      property for transfer by the Administrator to the appropriate
      state agency for distribution through donation to the educational
      activities.
        (3) Property not usable for special interest activities. - If

      disposed of in accordance with subsection (c).

      (e) State Plan of Operation. - 
        (1) In general. - Before property may be transferred to a state
      agency, the State shall develop a detailed state plan of
      operation, in accordance with this subsection and with state law.
        (2) Procedure. - 
          (A) Consideration of needs and resources. - In developing and
        implementing the state plan of operation, the relative needs
        and resources of all public agencies and other eligible
        institutions in the State shall be taken into consideration.
        The Administrator may consult with interested federal agencies
        to obtain their views concerning the administration and
        operation of this section.
          (B) Publication and period for comment. - The state plan of
        operation, and any major amendment to the plan, may not be
        filed with the Administrator until 60 days after general notice
        of the proposed plan or amendment has been published and
        interested persons have been given at least 30 days to submit
        comments.
          (C) Certification. - The chief executive officer of the State
        shall certify and submit the state plan of operation to the
        Administrator.

        (3) Requirements. - 
          (A) State agency. - The state plan of operation shall include
        adequate assurance that the state agency has - 
            (i) the necessary organizational and operational authority
          and capability including staff, facilities, and means and
          methods of financing; and
            (ii) established procedures for accountability, internal
          and external audits, cooperative agreements, compliance and
          use reviews, equitable distribution and property disposal,
          determination of eligibility, and assistance through
          consultation with advisory bodies and public and private
          groups.

          (B) Equitable distribution. - The state plan of operation
        shall provide for fair and equitable distribution of property
        in the State based on the relative needs and resources of
        interested public agencies and other eligible institutions in
        the State and their abilities to use the property.
          (C) Management control and accounting systems. - The state
        plan of operation shall require, for donable property
        transferred under this section, that the state agency use
        management control and accounting systems of the same type as
        systems required by state law for state-owned property.
        However, with approval from the chief executive officer of the
        State, the state agency may elect to use other management
        control and accounting systems that are effective to govern the
        use, inventory control, accountability, and disposal of
        property under this section.
          (D) Return and redistribution for non-use. - The state plan
        of operation shall require the state agency to provide for the
        return and redistribution of donable property if the property,
        while still usable, has not been placed in use for the purpose
        for which it was donated within one year of donation or ceases
        to be used by the donee for that purpose within one year of
        being placed in use.
          (E) Request by recipient. - The state plan of operation shall
        require the state agency, to the extent practicable, to select
        property requested by a public agency or other eligible
        institution in the State and, if requested by the recipient, to
        arrange shipment of the property directly to the recipient.
          (F) Service charges. - If the state agency is authorized to
        assess and collect service charges from participating
        recipients to cover direct and reasonable indirect costs of its
        activities, the method of establishing the charges shall be set
        out in the state plan of operation. The charges shall be fair
        and equitable and shall be based on services the state agency
        performs, including screening, packing, crating, removal, and
        transportation.
          (G) Terms, conditions, reservations, and restrictions. - 
            (i) In general. - The state plan of operation shall provide
          that the state agency - 
              (I) may impose reasonable terms, conditions,
            reservations, and restrictions on the use of property to be
            donated under subsection (c); and
              (II) shall impose reasonable terms, conditions,
            reservations, and restrictions on the use of a passenger

-EXEC-
     EX. ORD. NO. 12999. EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY: ENSURING OPPORTUNITY
                   FOR ALL CHILDREN IN THE NEXT CENTURY
      Ex. Ord. No. 12999, Apr. 17, 1996, 61 F.R. 17227, provided:
      In order to ensure that American children have the skills they
    need to succeed in the information-intensive 21st century, the
    Federal Government is committed to working with the private sector
    to promote four major developments in American education: making
    modern computer technology an integral part of every classroom;
    providing teachers with the professional development they need to
    use new technologies effectively; connecting classrooms to the
    National Information Infrastructure; and encouraging the creation
    of excellent educational software. This Executive order streamlines
    the transfer of excess and surplus Federal computer equipment to
    our Nation's classrooms and encourages Federal employees to
    volunteer their time and expertise to assist teachers and to
    connect classrooms.
      Accordingly, by the authority vested in me as President by the
    Constitution and the laws of the United States of America,
    including the provisions of the Stevenson-Wydler Technology
    Innovation Act of 1980, as amended (15 U.S.C. 3701 et seq.), the
    Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, ch. 288,
    63 Stat. 377 [now chapters 1 to 11 of this title and title III of
    the Act of June 30, 1949 (41 U.S.C. 251 et seq.)], and the National
    Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996, Public Law 104-106
    [see Tables for classification], it is hereby ordered as follows:
      Section 1. Protection of Educationally Useful Federal Equipment.
    (a) Educationally useful Federal equipment is a vital national
    resource. To the extent such equipment can be used as is, separated
    into parts for other computers, or upgraded - either by
    professional technicians, students, or other recycling efforts -
    educationally useful Federal equipment is a valuable tool for
    computer education. Therefore, to the extent possible, all
    executive departments and agencies (hereinafter referred to as
    "agencies") shall protect and safeguard such equipment,
    particularly when declared excess or surplus, so that it may be
    recycled and transferred, if appropriate, pursuant to this order.
      Sec. 2. Efficient Transfer of Educationally Useful Federal
    Equipment to Schools and Nonprofit Organizations. (a) To the extent
    permitted by law, all agencies shall give highest preference to
    schools and nonprofit organizations, including community-based
    educational organizations, ("schools and nonprofit organizations")
    in the transfer, through gift or donation, of educationally useful
    Federal equipment.
      (b) Agencies shall attempt to give particular preference to
    schools and nonprofit organizations located in the Federal
    enterprise communities and empowerment zones established in the
    Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1993, Public Law 103-66 [see 26
    U.S.C. 1391 et seq.].
      (c) Each agency shall, to the extent permitted by law and where
    appropriate, identify educationally useful Federal equipment that
    it no longer needs and transfer it to a school or nonprofit
    organization by:
      (1) conveying research equipment directly to the school or
    organization pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 3710(i); or
      (2) reporting excess equipment to the General Services
    Administration (GSA) for donation when declared surplus in
    accordance with section 203(j) of the Federal Property and
    Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended, 40 U.S.C. 484(j)
    [now 40 U.S.C. 549]. Agencies shall report such equipment as far as
    possible in advance of the date the equipment becomes excess, so
    that GSA may attempt to arrange direct transfers from the donating
    agency to recipients eligible under this order.
      (d) In transfers made pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this
    section, title shall transfer directly from the agency to the
    schools or nonprofit organizations as required by 15 U.S.C.
    3710(i). All such transfers shall be reported to the GSA. At the
    direction of the recipient institution or organization, and if
    appropriate, transferred equipment may be conveyed initially to a
    nonprofit reuse or recycling program that will upgrade it before
    transfer to the school or nonprofit organization holding title.
      (e) All transfers to schools or nonprofit organizations, whether
    made directly or through GSA, shall be made at the lowest cost to
    the school or nonprofit organization permitted by law.
      (f) The availability of educationally useful Federal equipment
    shall be made known to eligible recipients under this order by all
    practicable means, including newspaper, community announcements,
    and the Internet.
      (g) The regional Federal Executive Boards shall help facilitate
    the transfer of educationally useful Federal equipment from the
    agencies they represent to recipients eligible under this order.
      Sec. 3. Assisting Teachers' Professional Development: Connecting
    Classrooms. (a) Each agency that has employees who have computer
    expertise shall, to the extent permitted by law and in accordance
    with the guidelines of the Office of Personnel Management,
    encourage those employees to:
      (1) help connect America's classrooms to the National Information
    Infrastructure;
      (2) assist teachers in learning to use computers to teach; and
      (3) provide ongoing maintenance of and technical support for the
    educationally useful Federal equipment transferred pursuant to this
    order.
      (b) Each agency described in subsection (a) shall submit to the
    Office of Science and Technology Policy, within 6 months of the
    date of this order, an implementation plan to advance the
    developments described in this order, particularly those required
    in this section. The plan shall be consistent with approved agency
    budget totals and shall be coordinated through the Office of
    Science and Technology Policy.
      (c) Nothing in this order shall be interpreted to bar a recipient
    of educationally useful Federal equipment from lending that
    equipment, whether on a permanent or temporary basis, to a teacher,
    administrator, student, employee, or other designated person in
    furtherance of educational goals.
      Sec. 4. Definitions. For the purposes of this order: (a)
    "Schools" means individual public or private education institutions
    encompassing prekindergarten through twelfth grade, as well as
    public school districts.
      (b) "Community-based educational organizations" means nonprofit
    entities that are engaged in collaborative projects with schools or
    that have education as their primary focus. Such organizations
    shall qualify as nonprofit educational institutions or
    organizations for purposes of section 203(j) of the Federal
    Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended [now
    40 U.S.C. 549].
      (c) "Educationally useful Federal equipment" means computers and
    related peripheral tools (e.g., printers, modems, routers, and
    servers), including telecommunications and research equipment, that
    are appropriate for use in prekindergarten, elementary, middle, or
    secondary school education. It shall also include computer
    software, where the transfer of licenses is permitted.
      (d) "Nonprofit reuse or recycling program" means a 501(c)
    organization able to upgrade computer equipment at no or low cost
    to the school or nonprofit organization taking title to it.
      (e) "Federal Executive Boards," as defined in 5 C.F.R. Part 960,
    are regional organizations of each Federal agency's highest local
    officials.
      Sec. 5. This order shall supersede Executive Order No. 12821 of
    November 16, 1992.
      Sec. 6. Judicial Review. This order is not intended, and should
    not be construed, to create any right or benefit, substantive or
    procedural, enforceable at law by a party against the United
    States, its agencies, its officers, or its employees.
                                                     William J. Clinton.

-STATUTE-
      (a) Definition. - In this section, the term "State" includes the
    District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the territories and
    possessions of the United States.
      (b) Enforcement and Revision of Instruments Transferring Property
    Under This Section. - 
        (1) In general. - Subject to disapproval by the Administrator
      of General Services within 30 days after notice of a proposed
      action to be taken under this section, except for personal
      property transferred pursuant to section 549 of this title, the
      official specified in paragraph (2) shall determine and enforce
      compliance with the terms, conditions, reservations, and
      restrictions contained in an instrument by which a transfer under
      this section is made. The official shall reform, correct, or
      amend the instrument if necessary to correct the instrument or to
      conform the transfer to the requirements of law. The official
      shall grant a release from any term, condition, reservation or
      restriction contained in the instrument, and shall convey,
      quitclaim, or release to the transferee (or other eligible user)
      any right or interest reserved to the Federal Government by the
      instrument, if the official determines that the property no
      longer serves the purpose for which it was transferred or that a
      release, conveyance, or quitclaim deed will not prevent
      accomplishment of that purpose. The release, conveyance, or
      quitclaim deed may be made subject to terms and conditions that
      the official considers necessary to protect or advance the
      interests of the Government.

        historic preservation, park, or recreational purposes.
          (C) Audits. - The Secretary of the Interior may periodically

        property shall, in its then existing condition, at the option
        of the Government, revert to the Government; and

    --------------------------------------------------------------------

      In subsections (b)(2), (c), and (d), the words "Secretary of
    Education" and "Secretary of Health and Human Services" are
    substituted for "Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare", as
    appropriate, because of sections 301(a)(2)(P) and (b), 507, and
    509(b) of the Department of Education Organization Act
    (20:3441(a)(2)(P) and (b), 3507, and 3508(b)).
      In subsection (b)(2), the words "the Surplus Property Act of
    1944, as amended", and the text of 40:484(k)(4)(D), are omitted
    because the relevant provisions of the Surplus Property Act of 1944
    (50 App.:1611 et seq.) have been repealed.
      In subsection (e), the definition of "States" is omitted as
    unnecessary because of 40:484(k)(1)(D), restated in subsection (a).
      In subsection (e)(4), the words "this subsection" are used to
    reflect the probable intent of Congress. In 40:484(k)(2)(C), the
    words "this subsection" should probably be "this paragraph",
    meaning 40:484(k)(2). In the revised section, the reference to
    40:484(k)(2) is translated as "this subsection" to reflect the
    restatement of 40:484(k)(2) as subsection (e) of the revised
    section.
      In subsection (h), the definition of "States", is omitted as
    unnecessary because of 40:484(k)(1)(D), restated in subsection (a).
      In subsection (h)(1)(B), the words "National Park System Advisory
    Board" are substituted for "Advisory Board on National Parks,
    Historic Sites, Buildings and Monuments" because of the amendment
    of 16:463 by section 9 of the Act of August 18, 1970 (Public Law 91-
    383), as added by section 2 of the Act of October 7, 1976 (Public
    Law 94-458, 90 Stat. 1940).
      In subsection (h)(2)(A), the words "this subsection" are used to
    reflect the probable intent of Congress. In 40:484(k)(3)(A), the
    words "this subsection" should probably be "this paragraph",
    meaning 40:484(k)(3). In the revised section, the reference to
    40:484(k)(3) is translated as "this subsection" to reflect the
    restatement of 40:484(k)(3) as subsection (h) of the revised
    section. The words "or the Surplus Property Act of 1944, as
    amended" are omitted because the relevant provisions of the Surplus
    Property Act of 1944 (50 App.:1611 et seq.) have been repealed.
      In subsection (h)(3), the words "this subsection" are used to
    reflect the probable intent of Congress. In 40:484(k)(3)(B), the
    words "this subsection" should probably be "this paragraph",
    meaning 40:484(k)(3). In the revised section, the reference to
    40:484(k)(3) is translated as "this subsection" to reflect the
    restatement of 40:484(k)(3) as subsection (h) of the revised
    section.

          (A) not appropriated from the general fund of the Treasury;
        or
          (B) appropriated from the general fund of the Treasury but by
        law reimbursable from assessment, tax, or other revenue or
        receipts.

        (2) In general. - The net proceeds of a disposition or transfer
      of property described in paragraph (1) shall be - 
          (A) credited to the applicable reimbursable fund or
        appropriation; or
          (B) paid to the federal agency that determined the property
        to be excess.

        (3) Calculation of net proceeds. - For purposes of this
      subsection, the net proceeds of a disposition or transfer of
      property are the proceeds less all expenses incurred for the
      disposition or transfer, including care and handling.
        (4) Alternative credit to miscellaneous receipts. - If the
      agency that determined the property to be excess decides that it
      is uneconomical or impractical to ascertain the amount of net
      proceeds, the proceeds shall be credited to miscellaneous
      receipts.

      (b) Special Account for Refunds or Payments for Breach. - 
        (1) Deposits. - A federal agency that disposes of surplus
      property under this chapter may deposit, in a special account in
      the Treasury, amounts of the proceeds of the dispositions that
      the agency decides are necessary to permit - 
          (A) appropriate refunds to purchasers for dispositions that
        are rescinded or that do not become final; and
          (B) payments for breach of warranty.

        (2) Withdrawals. - A federal agency that deposits proceeds in a
      special account under paragraph (1) may withdraw amounts to be
      refunded or paid from the account without regard to the origin of
      the amounts withdrawn.

      (c) Credit to Cost of Contractor's Work. - If a contract made by
    an executive agency, or a subcontract under that contract,
    authorizes the proceeds of a sale of property in the custody of a
    contractor or subcontractor to be credited to the price or cost of
    work covered by the contract or subcontract, then the proceeds of
    the sale shall be credited in accordance with the contract or
    subcontract.
      (d) Acceptance of Property Instead of Cash. - An executive agency
    entitled to receive cash under a contract for the lease, sale, or
    other disposition of surplus property may accept property instead
    of cash if the President determines that the property is strategic
    or critical material. The property is valued at the prevailing
    market price when the cash payment becomes due.
      (e) Management of Credit, Leases, and Permits. - For a
    disposition of surplus property under this chapter, if credit has
    been extended, or if the disposition has been by lease or permit,
    the Administrator of General Services, in a manner and on terms the
    Administrator determines are in the best interest of the Federal
    Government - 
        (1) shall administer and manage the credit, lease, or permit,
      and any security for the credit, lease, or permit; and
        (2) may enforce, adjust, and settle any right of the Government
      with respect to the credit, lease, or permit.

      In subsection (b)(1), the words "in the Treasury" are substituted
    for "with the Treasurer of the United States" because of section 1
    of Reorganization Plan No. 26 of 1950 (eff. July 31, 1950, 64 Stat.
    1280), restated as 31:321.
      In subsection (e), the words "or by War Assets Administration (or
    its predecessor agencies) under the Surplus Property Act of 1944"
    are omitted because the War Assets Administration was abolished and
    its functions were transferred to the General Services
    Administration by section 105 of the Federal Property and
    Administrative Services Act of 1949 (ch. 288, 63 Stat. 381).

    --------------------------------------------------------------------

      In this section, 40:490(a)(7) is omitted as obsolete because the
    pneumatic tube system referred to in the provision is no longer
    used or maintained and 40:490(a)(9) is omitted as obsolete because
    the relevant provisions of the Surplus Property Act of 1944 (50
    App.:1611 et seq.) have been repealed.
      In subsection (c)(3) and (4), the words "without regard to the
    provisions of section 278a of this title" and "which on June 30,
    1950, was specifically exempted by law from the requirements of
    said section" (in 40:490(a)(5)), and the words "without regard to
    the 25 per centum limitation of section 278a of this title" and
    "without reference to such limitation" (in 40:490(a)(8)),
    respectively, are omitted as obsolete because 40:278a was repealed
    by section 7 of the Public Buildings Amendments of 1988 (Public Law
    100-678, 40:278a).
      In subsection (c)(5), the words "Defense Industrial Reserve" are
    substituted for "National Industrial Reserve" because the National
    Industrial Reserve Act was renamed the Defense Industrial Reserve
    Act by section 809 of the Department of Defense Appropriation
    Authorization Act, 1974 (Public Law 93-155, 87 Stat. 617), and
    transferred to 10:2535 by section 4235 of the Defense Conversion,
    Reinvestment and Transition Assistance Act of 1992, which was
    included as Division D in the National Defense Authorization Act
    for Fiscal Year 1993 (Public Law 102-484, title XLII, 106 Stat.
    2690).
      In subsection (d)(3), the words "Federal Buildings Fund" are
    substituted for "Buildings Management Fund" because the fund
    established under 40:490(f)(1) is the Federal Buildings Fund and
    unexpended balances in the Buildings Management Fund were merged
    into the Federal Buildings Fund under 40:490(f)(3).
      In subsection (e), before clause (1), the words "section 501 of
    title 36" are substituted for "the Act of August 6, 1965, 70 Stat
    1049" in section 210(a)(15) of the Federal Property and
    Administrative Services Act of 1949 because of section 5(b) of the
    Act of August 12, 1998 (Public Law 105-225, 112 Stat. 1499), the
    first section of which enacted Title 36, United States Code. In
    clause (1), the words "chapters 33 and 51 and subchapter III of
    chapter 53 of title 5" are substituted for "the civil service and
    classification laws" because of section 7(b) of the Act of
    September 6, 1966 (Public Law 89-554, 80 Stat. 631), the first
    section of which enacted Title 5, United States Code.
      In subsection (f)(1)(A), the words "Defense Industrial Reserve

       FACILITATING ACCESS TO FEDERAL PROPERTY FOR SITING OF MOBILE
                             SERVICES ANTENNAS
      Memorandum of President of the United States, Aug. 10, 1995, 60
    F.R. 42023, provided:
      Memorandum for the Heads of Departments and Agencies
      Recent advancements in mobile telecommunications technology
    present an opportunity for the rapid construction of the Nation's
    wireless communications infrastructure. As a matter of policy, the
    Federal Government shall encourage the efficient and timely
    implementation of such new technologies and the concomitant
    infrastructure buildout as a means of stimulating economic growth
    and creating new jobs. The recent auctioning and impending
    licensing of radio frequencies for mobile personal communications
    services presents the Federal Government with the opportunity to
    foster new technologies and to encourage the development of
    communications infrastructure by making Federal property available
    for the siting of mobile services antennas.
      Therefore, to the extent permitted by law, I hereby direct the
    Administrator of General Services, within 90 days, in consultation
    with the Secretaries of Agriculture, Interior, Defense, and the
    heads of such other agencies as the Administrator may determine, to
    develop procedures necessary to facilitate appropriate access to
    Federal property for the siting of mobile services antennas.
      The procedures should be developed in accordance with the
    following:
      1. (a) Upon request, and to the extent permitted by law and where
    practicable, executive departments and agencies shall make
    available Federal Government buildings and lands for the siting of
    mobile service antennas. This should be done in accordance with
    Federal, State, and local laws and regulations, and consistent with
    national security concerns (including minimizing mutual
    electromagnetic interactions), public health and safety concerns,
    environmental and aesthetic concerns, preservation of historic
    buildings and monuments, protection of natural and cultural
    resources, protection of national park and wilderness values,
    protection of National Wildlife Refuge systems, and subject to any
    Federal requirements promulgated by the agency managing the
    facility and the Federal Communications Commission, the Federal
    Aviation Administration, National Telecommunications and
    Information Administration, and other relevant departments and
    agencies.
      (b) Antennas on Federal buildings or land may not contain any
    advertising.
      (c) Federal property does not include lands held by the United
    States in trust for individual or Native American tribal
    governments.
      (d) Agencies shall retain discretion to reject inappropriate
    siting requests, and assure adequate protection of public property
    and timely removal of equipment and structures at the end of
    service.
      2. All procedures and mechanisms adopted regarding access to
    Federal property shall be clear and simple so as to facilitate the
    efficient and rapid buildout of the national wireless
    communications infrastructure.
      3. Unless otherwise prohibited by or inconsistent with Federal
    law, agencies shall charge fees based on market value for siting
    antennas on Federal property, and may use competitive procedures if
    not all applicants can be accommodated.
      This memorandum does not give the siting of mobile services
    antennas priority over other authorized uses of Federal buildings
    or land.
      All independent regulatory commissions and agencies are requested
    to comply with the provisions of this memorandum.
      This memorandum is not intended to create any right, benefit or
    trust responsibility, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law
    or equity by a party against the United States, its agencies or
    instrumentalities, its officers, or any other person.
      This memorandum shall be published in the Federal Register.
                                                     William J. Clinton.

      (a) Request by Federal Agency or Instrumentality. - At the
    request of a federal agency, a mixed-ownership Government
    corporation (as defined in chapter 91 of title 31), or the District
    of Columbia, the Administrator of General Services may operate,
    maintain, and protect a building that is owned by the Federal

    Government corporation, by the corporation) and occupied by the
    agency or instrumentality making the request.
      (b) Transfer of Functions by Director of the Office of Management
    and Budget. - 
        (1) In general. - When the Director of the Office of Management
      and Budget determines that it is in the interest of economy or
      efficiency, the Director shall transfer to the Administrator all
      functions vested in a federal agency with respect to the

      naval training station, airfield, proving ground, military supply
      depot, or school) unless and only to the extent that the
      Secretary of Defense has issued a permit for use by another
      agency.
        (5) Exception for groups of special purpose buildings. - A
      transfer of functions shall not be made under this subsection for
      a building that the Director finds to be a part of a group of
      buildings that are - 
          (A) located in the same vicinity;
          (B) used wholly or predominantly for the special purposes of
        the agency with custody of the buildings; and
          (C) not generally suitable for use by another agency.

        (6) Exception for certain government buildings. - A transfer of
      functions shall not be made under this subsection for the
      Treasury Building, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing Building,
      the buildings occupied by the National Institute of Standards and
      Technology, and the buildings under the jurisdiction of the
      regents of the Smithsonian Institution.

      Ex. Ord. No. 12411, Mar. 29, 1983, 48 F.R. 13391, provided:
      By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution
    and laws of the United States of America, including Section 486 of
    Title 40 of the United States Code [now 40 U.S.C. 121], in order to
    institute fundamental changes in the manner in which Federal work
    space is managed to ensure its efficient utilization, it is hereby
    ordered as follows:
      Section 1. In order to make the Federal use of work space
    (including office space, warehouses and special purpose space,
    whether federally owned, leased or controlled) and related
    furnishings more effective in support of agency missions, minimize
    the acquisition of government resources, and reduce the
    administrative costs of the Federal government, the heads of all
    Federal Executive agencies shall:
      (a) Establish programs to reduce the amount of work space, used
    or held, to that amount which is essential for known agency
    missions;
      (b) Produce and maintain a total inventory of work space and
    related furnishings and declare excess to the Administrator of
    General Services all such holdings that are not necessary to
    satisfy existing or known and verified planned programs;
      (c) Ensure that the amount of office space used by each employee
    of the agency, or others using agency-controlled space, is held to
    the minimum necessary to accomplish the task that must be
    performed;
      (d) Manage the furniture, equipment, decoration, drapes,
    carpeting, plants and other accoutrements so that the use of all
    furnishings by the agency reflects a judicious employment of public
    moneys;
      (e) Consider, in making decisions concerning the use,
    acquisition, or disposal of work space and related furnishings, the
    effects of its actions on costs incurred by other Federal agencies;
      (f) Report all vacant work space retained for future Federal uses
    to the Administrator of General Services so that it may be made
    available for the temporary use of other Federal agencies, to the
    extent consistent with national defense requirements;
      (g) Establish a work space management plan to meet the provisions
    of this Order, including specification of the goals to be achieved
    and actions to be taken by the agency in order to improve its
    utilization of all work space and related furnishings; and
      (h) Establish information systems, implement inventory controls
    and conduct surveys, in accordance with procedures established by
    the Administrator of General Services, so that a government-wide
    reporting system may be developed.
      Sec. 2. The Administrator of General Services is delegated
    authority, to the extent not prohibited by other laws, to conduct
    surveys, establish agency-wide objectives for work space use for
    each Executive agency, and establish procedures, guidelines and
    regulations to be followed by the agencies in developing the work

    Sec. 585. Lease agreements

-STATUTE-
      (a) In General. - 
        (1) Authority. - The Administrator of General Services may
      enter into a lease agreement with a person, copartnership,
      corporation, or other public or private entity for the
      accommodation of a federal agency in a building (or improvement)
      which is in existence or being erected by the lessor to
      accommodate the federal agency. The Administrator may assign and
      reassign the leased space to a federal agency.
        (2) Terms. - A lease agreement under this subsection shall be
      on terms the Administrator considers to be in the interest of the
      Federal Government and necessary for the accommodation of the
      federal agency. However, the lease agreement may not bind the
      Government for more than 20 years and the obligation of amounts
      for a lease under this subsection is limited to the current
      fiscal year for which payments are due without regard to section
      1341(a)(1)(B) of title 31.

      (b) Sublease. - 
        (1) Application. - This subsection applies to rent received if
      the Administrator - 
          (A) determines that an unexpired portion of a lease of space
        to the Government is surplus property; and
          (B) disposes of the property by sublease.

        (2) Use of rent. - Notwithstanding section 571(a) of this
      title, the Administrator may deposit rent received into the
      Federal Buildings Fund. The Administrator may defray from the
      fund any costs necessary to provide services to the Government's
      lessee and to pay the rent (not otherwise provided for) on the
      lease of the space to the Government.

      (c) Amounts for Rent Available for Lease of Buildings on
    Government Land. - Amounts made available to the General Services
    Administration for the payment of rent may be used to lease space,
    for a period of not more than 30 years, in buildings erected on
    land owned by the Government.

      In subsection (b)(2), the words "Federal Buildings Fund" are
    substituted for "buildings management fund" because the fund

    Sec. 586. Charges for space and services

-STATUTE-
      (a) Definition. - In this section, "space and services" means
    space, services, quarters, maintenance, repair, and other
    facilities.
      (b) Charges by Administrator of General Services. - 
        (1) In general. - The Administrator of General Services shall
      impose a charge for furnishing space and services.
        (2) Rates. - The Administrator shall, from time to time,
      determine the rates to be charged for furnishing space and
      services and shall prescribe regulations providing for the rates.
      The rates shall approximate commercial charges for comparable
      space and services. However, for a building for which the
      Administrator is responsible for alterations only (as the term
      "alter" is defined in section 3301(a) of this title), the rates
      shall be fixed to recover only the approximate cost incurred in
      providing alterations.
        (3) Exemptions. - The Administrator may exempt anyone from the
      charges required by this subsection when the Administrator
      determines that charges would be infeasible or impractical. To
      the extent an exemption is granted, appropriations to the General
      Services Administration are authorized to reimburse the Federal
      Buildings Fund for any loss of revenue.

      (c) Charges by Executive Agencies. - 
        (1) In general. - An executive agency, other than the
      Administration, may impose a charge for furnishing space and
      services at rates approved by the Administrator.
        (2) Crediting amounts received. - An amount an executive agency
      receives under this subsection shall be credited to the
      appropriation or fund initially charged for providing the space
      or service. However, amounts in excess of actual operating and
      maintenance costs shall be credited to miscellaneous receipts
      unless otherwise provided by law.

      (d) Rent Payments for Lease Space. - An agency may make rent
    payments to the Administration for lease space relating to
    expansion needs of the agency. Payment rates shall approximate
    commercial charges for comparable space as provided in subsection
    (b). Payments shall be deposited into the Federal Buildings Fund.
    The Administration may use amounts received under this subsection,
    in addition to amounts received as New Obligational Authority, in
    the Rental of Space activity of the Fund.

    --------------------------------------------------------------------

      In subsection (b)(3), the words "Federal Buildings Fund" are
    substituted for "the fund" for clarity and to execute the probable
    intent of Congress. Sections 3 and 4 of the Public Buildings
    Amendments of 1972 (Public Law 92-313, 86 Stat. 218) added
    subsection (j) of 40:490 (in which the words "the fund" appear) and
    amended subsection (f) to create a fund into which "charges made
    pursuant to subsection (j)" are deposited (40:490(f)(1)(A)). That
    fund was subsequently named "Federal Buildings Fund" by section
    153(1) of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-486, 106
    Stat. 2851). If an exemption from charges is granted under
    40:490(j), "the fund" that suffers the loss of revenue is the
    Federal Buildings Fund.
      In subsection (d), the words "on and after October 6, 1992" are
    omitted as obsolete. The words "subsection (b)" are substituted for
    "section 201(j) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services
    Act of 1949, as amended (40 U.S.C. 490(j))" in section 5(a) of the
    Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, 1993, to reflect the
    probable intent of Congress. Section 201 of the Federal Property
    and Administrative Services Act of 1949 does not contain a
    subsection (j) and the intended reference was probably "section
    210(j)", which is restated in this section. The text of 40:490f(b)
    is omitted as executed.

      telecommuting center available for use by others to the extent it
      is not fully utilized by federal employees.
        (3) User fees. - The Administrator shall charge a user fee for
      the use of a telecommuting center. The amount of the user fee
      shall approximate commercial charges for comparable space and
      services. However, the user fee may not be less than necessary to
      pay the cost of establishing and operating the telecommuting
      center, including the reasonable cost of renovation and
      replacement of furniture, fixtures, and equipment.
        (4) Deposit and use of fees. - The Administrator may -

      (c) Development of Alternative Workplace Arrangements by
    Executive Agencies and Others. - 
        (1) Definition. - In this subsection, the term "alternative
      workplace arrangements" includes telecommuting, hoteling, virtual
      offices, and other distributive work arrangements.
        (2) Consideration by executive agencies. - In considering
      whether to acquire space, quarters, buildings, or other
      facilities for use by employees, the head of an executive agency
      shall consider whether needs can be met using alternative
      workplace arrangements.
        (3) Guidance from administrator. - The Administrator may
      provide guidance, assistance, and oversight to any person
      regarding the establishment and operation of alternative
      workplace arrangements.

      (d) Amounts Available for Flexiplace Work Telecommuting Programs.
    - 
        (1) Definition. - In this subsection, the term "flexiplace work
      telecommuting program" means a program under which employees of a
      department or agency set out in paragraph (2) are permitted to
      perform all or a portion of their duties at a telecommuting
      center established under this section or other federal law.

-STATUTE-
      (a) Definition. - In this section, the term "controlled space"
    means a substantial and identifiable segment of space (such as a
    building, floor, or wing) in a location that the Administrator of
    General Services controls for purposes of assignment of space.
      (b) Application. - This section applies if an agency (or unit of
    the agency), moves from one controlled space to another, whether in
    the same or a different location.
      (c) Moving Existing Furniture. - The furniture and furnishings
    used by an agency (or organizational unit of the agency) shall be
    moved only if the Administrator determines, after consultation with
    the head of the agency and with due regard for the program
    activities of the agency, that it would not be more economical and
    efficient to make suitable replacements available in the new
    controlled space.
      (d) Providing Replacement Furniture. - In the absence of a
    determination under subsection (c), suitable furniture and
    furnishings for the new controlled space shall be provided from
    stocks under the control of the moving agency or from stocks
    available to the Administrator, whichever the Administrator
    determines to be more economical and efficient. However, the same
    or similar items may not be provided from both sources.
      (e) Control of Replacement Furniture. - If furniture and
    furnishings for a new controlled space are provided from stocks
    available to the Administrator, the items being provided remain in
    the control of the Administrator.
      (f) Control of Furniture Not Moved. - 
        (1) In general. - If furniture and furnishings for a new
      controlled space are provided from stocks available to the
      Administrator, the furniture and furnishings that were previously
      used by the moving agency (or unit of the agency) pass to the
      control of the Administrator.
        (2) Reimbursement. - 
          (A) In general. - Furniture and furnishings passing to the
        control of the Administrator under this section pass without
        reimbursement.
          (B) Exception for trust fund. - If furniture and furnishings
        that were purchased from a trust fund pass to the control of
        the Administrator under this section, the Administrator shall
        reimburse the trust fund for the fair market value of the
        furniture and furnishings.

        (3) Revolving or working capital fund. - If furniture and
      furnishings are carried as assets of a revolving or working
      capital fund at the time they pass to the control of the
      Administrator under this section, the net book value of the
      furniture and furnishings shall be written off and the capital of
      the fund is diminished by the amount of the write-off.

      established under state statute, state regulation, or state-
      approved territorial agreements.

      (b) Exceptions. - 
        (1) Energy savings. - This section does not preclude the head
      of a federal agency from entering into a contract under section

        10; or

          (B) purchasing electricity from any provider if the Secretary
        finds that the utility having the applicable state-approved
        franchise (or other service authorization) is unwilling or
        unable to meet unusual standards of service reliability that
        are necessary for purposes of national defense.

        (2) Reimbursements for special services. - This subchapter does
      not preclude the Administrator of General Services from providing
      special services, not included in the standard level user charge,
      on a reimbursable basis. The reimbursements may be credited to
      the Fund.
        (3) Transfer of surplus amounts. - To prevent the accumulation
      of excessive surpluses in the Fund, in any fiscal year an amount
      specified in an appropriation law may be transferred out of the
      Fund and deposited as miscellaneous receipts in the Treasury.

      (c) Uses. - 
        (1) In general. - Deposits in the Fund are available for real
      property management and related activities in the amounts
      specified in annual appropriation laws without regard to fiscal
      year limitations.
        (2) Salaries and expenses related to construction projects or
      planning programs. - Deposits in the Fund that are available
      pursuant to annual appropriation laws may be transferred and
      consolidated on the books of the Treasury into a special account
      in accordance with, and for the purposes specified in, section
      3176 of this title.
        (3) Repayment of general services administration borrowing from
      federal financing bank. - The Administrator, in accordance with

      the Secretary of the Treasury establish, may transfer from the
      Fund an amount necessary to repay the principal amount of a
      General Services Administration borrowing from the Federal
      Financing Bank, if the borrowing is a legal obligation of the
      Fund.
        (4) Buildings deemed federally owned. - For purposes of amounts
      authorized to be expended from the Fund, the following are deemed
      to be federally owned buildings:
          (A) A building constructed pursuant to the purchase contract
        authority of section 5 of the Public Buildings Amendments of
        1972 (Public Law 92-313, 86 Stat. 219).
          (B) A building occupied pursuant to an installment purchase
        contract.
          (C) A building under the control of a department or agency,
        if alterations of the building are required in connection with
        moving the department or agency from a former building that is,
        or will be, under the control of the Administration.

      (d) Energy Management Programs. - 
        (1) Receiving cash incentives. - The Administrator may receive

      accept, from a utility, goods or services that enhance the energy
      efficiency of federal facilities.
        (3) Assignment of energy rebates. - In the administration of
      real property that the Administrator leases and for which the
      Administrator pays utility costs, the Administrator may assign
      all or a portion of energy rebates to the lessor to underwrite
      the costs incurred in undertaking energy efficiency improvements
      in the real property if the payback period for the improvement is
      at least 2 years less than the remainder of the term of the
      lease.
        (4) Obligating amounts for energy management improvement
      programs. - In addition to amounts appropriated for energy
      management improvement programs and without regard to subsection
      (c)(1), the Administrator may obligate for those programs - 
          (A) amounts received and deposited in the Fund under
        paragraph (1);
          (B) goods and services received under paragraph (2); and
          (C) amounts the Administrator determines are not needed for
        other authorized projects and that are otherwise available to
        implement energy efficiency programs.

      (e) Recycling Programs. - 
        (1) Receiving amounts. - The Administrator may receive amounts
      from the sale of recycled materials and shall deposit the amounts
      in the Fund for use as provided in paragraph (2).
        (2) Obligating amounts for recycling programs. - In addition to
      amounts appropriated for such purposes and without regard to
      subsection (c)(1), the Administrator may obligate amounts
      received and deposited in the Fund under paragraph (1) for
      programs which - 
          (A) promote further source reduction and recycling programs;
        and
          (B) encourage employees to participate in recycling programs
        by providing financing for child care.

      (f) Additional Authority Related to Energy Management and
    Recycling Programs. - The Fund may receive, in the form of rebates,
    cash incentives or otherwise, any revenues, collections, or other
    income related to energy savings or recycling efforts. Amounts
    received under this subsection remain in the Fund until expended
    and remain available for federal energy management improvement
    programs, recycling programs, or employee programs that are
    authorized by law or that the Administrator considers appropriate.
    The Administration may use amounts received under this subsection,
    in addition to amounts received as New Obligational Authority, in
    activities of the Fund as necessary.

      (b) In General. - Except as provided in subsection (c), amounts
    made available to the General Services Administration pursuant to
    section 592 of this title may not be obligated or expended to
    procure covered services by contract if an employee who was a
    permanent veterans preference employee of the Administration on
    November 19, 1995, would be terminated as a result.
      (c) Exception. - Amounts made available to the Administration
    pursuant to section 592 of this title may be obligated and expended

        (1) to establish procedures to ensure safe operation of motor
      vehicles on Government business;
        (2) to provide for proper identification of Government motor
      vehicles;
        (3) to establish an effective means to limit the use of
      Government motor vehicles to official purposes;
        (4) to reduce the number of Government-owned vehicles to the
      minimum necessary to transact public business; and
        (5) to provide wherever practicable for centrally operated
      interagency pools or systems for local transportation of
      Government personnel and property.

-EXEC-
      EX. ORD. NO. 10579. INTERAGENCY MOTOR-VEHICLE POOLS AND SYSTEMS  
      Ex. Ord. No. 10579, Dec. 1, 1954, 19 F.R. 7925, provided:
      Section 1. Purpose and general policy. (a) The purpose of these
    regulations is to establish policies and procedures under which
    interagency motor-vehicle pools or systems may be established,
    operated, curtailed, or discontinued.
      (b) The Administrator of General Services (hereinafter referred
    to as the Administrator) shall establish and provide for the
    operation of interagency motor-vehicle pools and systems for the
    purpose of providing more efficient or economical transportation of
    Government personnel and property within specific areas by motor
    vehicles or local transit systems. Pools or systems based in whole
    or in part upon use of privately-owned vehicles and facilities
    shall be preferred to Government ownership of vehicles and
    facilities to the extent that it is feasible to provide required
    motor-vehicle services of satisfactory quality and cost from
    commercial or other private sources.
      Sec. 2. Conduct of studies to determine advisability of
    establishing motor-vehicle pools or systems. (a) The Administrator
    shall select areas in which studies are to be conducted to
    determine the advisability of establishing motor-vehicle pools or
    systems. Before initiating any such study, he shall give at least
    thirty days notice to the head of each executive agency (as defined
    in section 3(a) of the Act [now 40 U.S.C. 102(4)]). The notice
    shall include a statement of the approximate geographic area to be
    studied and the date on which the study will begin.
      (b) The head of each executive agency receiving notice that such
    a study is to be made shall provide information which is required
    or pertinent. He shall also designate one or more officials in the
    field with whom members of a staff assigned by the General Services
    Administration may consult. Such designated officials shall provide
    such assigned staff with needed information and assistance,
    including reasonable opportunities to observe motor-vehicle
    operations and facilities and to examine pertinent cost and other
    records.
      Sec. 3. Determination to establish an interagency motor-vehicle
    pool or system. (a) If the Administrator determines, with due
    regard to the program activities of the agencies concerned, and on
    the basis of a study made in accordance with section 2 hereof, that
    an interagency motor-vehicle pool or system should be established,
    he shall be responsible for preparing a formal determination to
    that effect. Such determination shall include:
      (1) A description of the proposed operation, including a
    statement of the types of service and of the geographic area, and
    the agencies or parts of agencies to be served.
      (2) The name of the executive agency designated to be responsible
    for operating the pool or system, and the reasons for such
    designation.
      (3) A statement indicating the motor vehicles and related
    equipment and supplies to be transferred and the amount of
    reimbursement, if any, to be made therefor.
      (b) Each determination shall be accompanied by an analytical
    justification which shall include a comparison of estimated costs
    of the present and proposed methods of operation and a showing of
    the estimated savings to be realized through the establishment of
    the proposed pool or system. The justification shall also describe
    the alternatives considered in making the determination, and shall
    include a statement concerning the availability of privately-owned
    facilities and equipment, and the feasibility and estimated cost
    (immediate and long-term) of using such facilities and equipment.
      (c) The Administrator shall send a copy of each determination to
    each executive agency affected and to the Director of the Bureau of
    the Budget [now the Director of the Office of Management and
    Budget] (hereinafter referred to as the Director).
      Sec. 4. Transfers of records, facilities, personnel, and
    appropriations. Whenever the Administrator prepares a determination
    as set forth in section 3 of these regulations, he shall also
    prepare and present to the Director a schedule of the proposed
    transfer of such records, facilities, personnel, and appropriations
    as relate primarily to the functions which are to be transferred to
    the interagency motor-vehicle pool or system. A copy of such
    schedule shall be sent by the Administrator to each executive
    agency affected. The Director shall determine the records,
    facilities, personnel, and appropriations to be transferred.
      Sec. 5. Taking effect of determinations. Unless a greater time is
    allowed therein, any determination made by the Administrator shall
    become binding on all affected executive agencies forty-five days
    after the issuance thereof except with respect to any agency which
    appeals, or requests an exemption, from any such determination in
    accordance with section 6 of these regulations.
      Sec. 6. Review of determinations not agreed to by agencies
    affected. (a) Any executive agency may appeal or request exemption
    from any or all proposals affecting it which are contained in a
    determination. Appeals shall be submitted in writing to the
    Director with a copy to the Administrator within forty-five days
    from the date of the determination. Such appeals shall be
    accompanied by factual and objective supporting data and
    justification.
      (b) The Director shall review any determination from which an
    executive agency has appealed and shall make a final decision on
    such appeal. The Director shall make such decisions, within seventy-
    five days after he receives the appeal or as soon thereafter as
    practicable, on the basis of information contained in the
    Administrator's determination, the executive agencies' appeals
    therefrom, and any supplementary data submitted by the
    Administrator and the contesting agencies. The Director shall send
    copies of decisions to the Administrator and to the heads of other
    executive agencies concerned.
      (c) The Director's decision upon each such appeal, if it holds
    that the determination shall apply in whole or in part to the
    appealing agency, shall state the extent to which the determination
    applies and the effective date of its application. To the extent
    that the Director's decision on an appeal does not uphold the
    Administrator's determination, such determination shall be of no
    force and effect.
      Sec. 7. Compliance with determinations and decisions on appeals.
    (a) When a determination or a decision on an appeal made in
    accordance with these regulations has become effective, each
    executive agency affected shall comply therewith.
      (b) The Director shall take such actions as he deems appropriate
    to assist in securing compliance with determinations which have
    become effective. In the exercise of this authority to establish
    reserves in apportioning appropriations and funds, the Director
    shall take account of such savings as accrue from the establishment
    of inter-agency motor-vehicle pools and systems.
      (c) The executive agency which operates any pool or system
    established hereunder shall maintain accurate records of the cost
    of establishment, maintenance, and operation of any interagency
    motor-vehicle pool or system established pursuant to these
    regulations.
      (d) The Administrator shall be responsible for maintaining
    adequate reviews and controls of the economy and efficiency of all
    pools or systems established in accordance with these regulations,
    including those not directly operated by the General Services
    Administration.
      Sec. 8. Discontinuance or curtailment of service. (a) If, during
    any reasonable period, not exceeding two successive fiscal years,
    no actual savings are realized from the operation of any pool or
    system established hereunder, the Administrator shall discontinue
    the pool or system concerned.
      (b) The Administrator may discontinue or curtail a motor-vehicle
    pool or system when he determines that it is not the most
    economical method of rendering required motor-vehicle service; but
    he shall give at least sixty days notice of such intention to
    executive agencies affected and to the Director before taking such
    action.
      (c) Executive agencies affected by a pool or system for which the
    Administrator is responsible (including inter-agency pools or
    systems operated by another executive agency designated by the
    Administrator) may bring problems of service and cost to the
    attention of the Administrator, who shall assure that such problems
    receive proper attention.
      (d) Executive agencies receiving motor-vehicle services from an
    interagency motor-vehicle pool or system under these regulations
    may request discontinuance or curtailment of their participation in
    such pool or system after at least one year of participation or in
    the event that the need for the services from the pool or system
    ceases. Such requests shall be submitted to the Administrator with
    pertinent factual justification.
      (e) If the Administrator does not agree with such request and is
    unable to make arrangements which are mutually acceptable to him
    and to the head of the executive agency concerned, the agency's
    request for discontinuance or modification and the Administrator's
    reasons for not agreeing with the request shall be forwarded to the
    Director who shall be responsible for making a final and binding
    decision.
      (f) When a pool or system is discontinued or curtailed, such
    transfers of vehicles and related equipment and supplies,
    personnel, records, facilities, and funds as may be appropriate
    will be made, subject to the approval of the Director.
      Sec. 9. Motor vehicles exempted from inclusion in interagency
    motor-vehicle pools. The following-described classes of motor
    vehicles shall be exempt from inclusion in interagency motor-
    vehicle pools or systems:
      (1) Motor vehicles designed or used for military field training,
    combat, or tactical purposes, or used principally within the
    confines of a regularly established military post, camp, or depot.
      (2) Any motor vehicle regularly used by an agency in the
    performance of investigative, law enforcement, or intelligence
    duties if the head of such agency determines that exclusive control
    of such vehicle is essential to the effective performance of such
    duties: Provided, that vehicles regularly used for common
    administrative purposes not directly connected with the performance
    of law enforcement, investigative, or intelligence duties shall not
    because of such use be exempted from such inclusion.
      (3) Any motor vehicle the conspicuous identification of which as
    a Government vehicle would interfere with the purpose for which it
    is acquired and used.
      (4) Unless inclusion is mutually agreed upon by the Administrator
    and the head of the agency concerned:
      (i) Motor vehicles for the use of the heads of the executive
    agencies, ambassadors, ministers, charge d'affaires, and other
    principal diplomatic and consular officials.
      (ii) Motor vehicles regularly and principally used for the
    transportation of diplomats and representatives of foreign
    countries or by officers of the Department of State for the conduct
    of official business with representatives of foreign countries.
      (iii) Motor vehicles regularly used for the distribution and
    transportation of mails.
      (5) Motor vehicles which, because of their design or the special
    purposes for which they are used, or for other reasons, cannot
    advantageously be incorporated in an interagency motor-vehicle pool
    or system if the exemption thereof has been mutually agreed upon by
    the Administrator and the head of the executive agency concerned.
      (6) Motor vehicles exempted by an agency which has authority to
    make such an exemption under the provisions of the Act [probably
    means the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949,
    now chapters 1 to 11 of this title and title III of the Act of June
    30, 1949 (41 U.S.C. 251 et seq.)].
      Sec. 10. Optional use arrangements. Nothing in these regulations
    shall be construed as precluding the establishment or operation of
    interagency motor-vehicle pools or systems on the basis of optional
    use by executive or other Federal agencies.
      Sec. 11. Supplementary regulations. The Administrator shall,
    after consultation with the executive agencies concerned and with
    due regard to their program activities, issue such supplementary
    regulations of general applicability to the executive agencies
    concerned as are necessary for the effective and economical
    operation of pools or systems under the Act [probably means the
    Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949].

      section 602 of this title, reimbursement is required if the
      property is taken over from - 
          (A) a Government corporation; or
          (B) an agency, if the agency acquired the property through
        unreimbursed expenditures made from a revolving or trust fund
        authorized by law.

        (2) Amount. - The Administrator shall reimburse a Government
      corporation, or a fund through which an agency acquired property,
      by an amount equal to the fair market value of the property. If
      the Administrator subsequently returns property of a similar kind
      under section 610 of this title, the Government corporation or
      the fund shall reimburse the Administrator by an amount equal to
      the fair market value of the property returned.

      (b) Addition to Acquisition Services Fund. - If the Administrator
    takes over motor vehicles or related equipment or supplies under
    section 602 of this title but reimbursement is not required under
    subsection (a), the value of the property taken over, as determined
    by the Administrator, may be added to the capital of the
    Acquisition Services Fund. If the Administrator subsequently
    returns property of a similar kind under section 610 of this title,
    the value of the property may be deducted from the Fund.

    SUBTITLE I - FEDERAL PROPERTY AND ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES
    CHAPTER 13 - PUBLIC PROPERTY

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1303. Disposition of surplus real property

-STATUTE-
      (a) Definition. - In this section, the term "federal agency"
    means an executive department, independent establishment,
    commission, board, bureau, division, or office in the executive
    branch, or other agency of the Federal Government, including wholly
    owned Government corporations.
      (b) Assignment of Space or Lease or Sale of Property. - 
        (1) Actions of administrator. - When the President, on the
      recommendation of the Administrator of General Services, or the
      federal agency having control of any real property the agency
      acquires that is located outside of the District of Columbia,
      other than military or naval reservations, declares the property
      to be surplus to the needs of the agency, the Administrator - 
          (A) may assign space in the property to any federal agency;
          (B) pending a sale, may lease the property for not more than
        5 years and on terms the Administrator considers to be in the
        public interest; or
          (C) may sell the property at public sale to the highest
        responsible bidder on terms and after public advertisement that
        the Administrator considers to be in the public interest.

        (2) Review of decision to assign space. - If the federal agency
      to which space is assigned does not desire to occupy the space,
      the decision of the Administrator under paragraph (1)(A) is
      subject to review by the President.
        (3) Negotiated sale. - If no bids which are satisfactory as to
      price and responsibility of the bidder are received as a result
      of public advertisement, the Administrator may sell the property
      by negotiation, on terms as may be considered to be to the best
      interest of the Government, but at a price not less than that bid
      by the highest responsible bidder.

      (c) Demolition. - The Administrator may demolish any building
    declared to be surplus to the needs of the Government under this
    section on deciding that demolition will be in the best interest of
    the Government. Before proceeding with the demolition, the
    Administrator shall inform the Secretary of the Interior in writing
    of the Administrator's intention to demolish the building, and
    shall not proceed with the demolition until receiving written
    notice from the Secretary that the building is not an historic
    building of national significance within the meaning of the Act of
    August 21, 1935 (16 U.S.C. 461 et seq.) (known as the Historic
    Sites, Buildings, and Antiquities Act). If the Secretary does not
    notify the Administrator of the Secretary's decision as to whether
    the building is an historic building of national significance
    within 90 days of the receipt of the notice of intention to
    demolish the building, the Administrator may proceed to demolish
    the building.
      (d) Repairs and Alterations to Assigned Real Property. - When the
    Administrator, after investigation, decides that real property
    referred to in subsection (b) should be used for the accommodation
    of a federal agency, the Administrator may make any repairs or
    alterations that the Administrator considers necessary or advisable
    and may maintain and operate the property.
      (e) Payment by Federal Agencies. - 
        (1) Assigned real property. - To the extent that the
      appropriations of the General Services Administration not
      otherwise allocated are inadequate for repairs, alterations,
      maintenance, or operation, the Administrator may require each
      federal agency to which space has been assigned to pay promptly
      by check to the Administrator out of its appropriation for rent
      any part of the estimated or actual cost of the repairs,
      alterations, maintenance, and operation. Payment may be either in
      advance of, or on or during, occupancy of the space. The
      Administrator shall determine and equitably apportion the total
      amount to be paid among the agencies to whom space has been
      assigned.
        (2) Leased spaces. - To the extent that the appropriations of
      the Administration not otherwise required are inadequate, the
      Administrator may require each federal agency to which leased
      space has been assigned to pay promptly by check to the
      Administrator out of its available appropriations any part of the
      estimated cost of rent, repairs, alterations, maintenance,
      operation, and moving. Payment may be either in advance or during
      occupancy of the space. When space in a building is occupied by
      two or more agencies, the Administrator shall determine and
      equitably apportion rental, operation, and other charges on the
      basis of the total amount of space leased.

      (f) Authorization of Appropriations. - Necessary amounts may be
    appropriated to cover the costs incident to the sale or lease of
    real property, or authorized demolition of buildings on the
    property, declared to be surplus to the needs of any federal agency
    under this section, and the care, maintenance, and protection of
    the property, including pay of employees, travel of Government
    employees, brokers' fees not in excess of rates paid for similar
    services in the community where the property is situated,
    appraisals, photographs, surveys, evidence of title and perfecting
    of defective titles, advertising, and telephone and telegraph
    charges. However, the agency remains responsible for the proper
    care, maintenance, and protection of the property until the
    Administrator assumes custody or other disposition of the property
    is made.
      (g) Regulations. - The Administrator may prescribe regulations as
    necessary to carry out this section.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1304. Transfer of federal property to States

-STATUTE-
      (a) Obsolete Buildings and Sites. - 
        (1) In general. - The Administrator of General Services, in the
      Administrator's discretion, on terms the Administrator considers
      proper, and under regulations the Administrator may prescribe,
      may sell property described in paragraph (2) to a State or a
      political subdivision of a State for public use if the
      Administrator considers the sale to be in the best interest of
      the Federal Government.
        (2) Applicable property. - The property referred to in
      paragraph (1) is any federal building, building site, or part of
      a building site under the Administrator's control that has been
      replaced by a new structure and that the Administrator determines
      is no longer needed by the Government.
        (3) Price. - The purchase price for a sale under this section
      must be at least 50 percent of the value of the land as appraised
      by the Administrator.
        (4) Proceeds of sale. - The proceeds of a sale under this
      section shall be deposited in the Treasury as miscellaneous
      receipts.
        (5) Payment terms. - The Administrator may enter into a long
      term contract for the payment of the purchase price in
      installments that the Administrator considers fair and
      reasonable. The Administrator may waive any requirement for
      interest charges on deferred payment.
        (6) Conveyance. - The Administrator may convey property sold
      under this section by the usual quitclaim deed.

      (b) Widening of Public Roads. - 
        (1) Definition. - In this subsection, the term "executive
      agency" means an executive department or independent
      establishment in the executive branch of the Government,
      including any wholly owned Government corporation.
        (2) In general. - When a State or a political subdivision of a
      State applies for a conveyance or transfer of real property of
      the Government in connection with an authorized widening of a
      public highway, street, or alley, the head of the executive
      agency that controls the affected real property may convey or
      transfer to the State or political subdivision, with or without
      consideration, an interest in the real property that the agency
      head determines is not adverse to the interests of the
      Government. A conveyance or transfer under this subsection is

      In subsection (a), the words "Administrator of General Services"
    and "Administrator" are substituted for "Treasury Department" and
    "Secretary of the Treasury" in the Act of August 26, 1935 because
    of sections 301 and 303 of Reorganization Plan No. I of 1939 (eff.
    July 1, 1939, 53 Stat. 1426, 1427) and section 103(a) of the
    Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (ch. 288,

    SUBTITLE I - FEDERAL PROPERTY AND ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES
    CHAPTER 13 - PUBLIC PROPERTY

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1306. Disposition of abandoned or forfeited personal property

-STATUTE-
      (a) Definitions. - In this section - 
        (1) Agency. - The term "agency" includes any executive
      department, independent establishment, board, commission, bureau,
      service, or division of the Federal Government, and any
      corporation in which the Government owns at least a majority of
      the stock.
        (2) Property. - The term "property" means all personal
      property, including vessels, vehicles, and aircraft.

      (b) Voluntarily Abandoned Property. - Property voluntarily
    abandoned to any agency in a way that vests title to the property
    in the Government may be retained by the agency and devoted to
    official use only. If the agency does not desire to retain the
    property, the head of the agency immediately shall notify the
    Administrator of General Services to that effect, and the
    Administrator, within a reasonable time, shall - 
        (1) order the agency to deliver the property to another agency
      that requests the property and that the Administrator believes
      should be given the property; or
        (2) order disposal of the property as otherwise provided by
      law.

      (c) Forfeited Property. - 
        (1) Agency retains property. - An agency that seizes property
      that has been forfeited to the Government other than by court
      decree may retain the property and devote it only to official use
      instead of disposing of the property as otherwise provided by law
      if competent authority does not order the property returned to
      any claimant.
        (2) Agency does not desire to retain property. - If the agency
      does not desire to retain the property, the head of the agency
      immediately shall notify the Administrator to that effect, and
      the property - 
          (A) if not ordered by competent authority to be returned to
        any claimant, or disposed of as otherwise provided by law,
        shall be delivered by the agency, on order of the Administrator
        given within a reasonable time, to another agency that requests
        the property and that the Administrator believes should be
        given the property; or
          (B) on order of the Administrator given within a reasonable
        time, shall be disposed of as otherwise provided by law.

      (d) Property Subject to Court Proceeding for Forfeiture. - 
        (1) Notification of administrator. - If a proceeding has begun
      for the forfeiture of any property by court decree, the agency
      that seized the property immediately shall notify the
      Administrator and at the same time may file with the
      Administrator a request for the property for its official use.
        (2) Application for court order to deliver property. - 
          (A) In general. - Before entry of a decree, the Administrator
        shall apply to the court to order delivery of the property in
        accordance with this paragraph.
          (B) Delivery to seizing agency. - If the agency that seized
        the property files a request for the property under paragraph
        (1), the Administrator shall apply to the court to order
        delivery of the property to the agency that seized the
        property.
          (C) Delivery to other requesting agency. - If the agency that
        seized the property does not file a request for the property
        under paragraph (1) but another agency requests the property,
        the Administrator shall apply to the court to order delivery of
        the property to the requesting agency if the Administrator
        believes that the requesting agency should be given the
        property.
          (D) Delivery to seizing agency for temporary holding. - If
        application to the court cannot be made under subparagraph (B)
        or (C) and the Administrator believes the property may later
        become necessary to any agency for official use, the
        Administrator shall apply to the court to order delivery of the
        property to the agency that seized the property, to be retained
        in its custody. Within a reasonable time, the Administrator
        shall order the agency to - 
            (i) deliver the property to another agency that requests
          the property and that the Administrator believes should be
          given the property; or
            (ii) dispose of the property as otherwise provided by law.

        (3) Forfeiture decreed. - If forfeiture is decreed and the
      property is not ordered by competent authority to be returned to
      any claimant, the court shall order delivery as provided in
      paragraph (2).
        (4) When no application made. - The court shall dispose of
      property for which no application is made in accordance with law.

      (e) Retention or Delivery of Property Deemed Sale. - Retention or
    delivery of forfeited or abandoned property under this section is
    deemed to be a sale of the property for the purpose of laws
    providing for informer's fees or remission or mitigation of a
    forfeiture. Property acquired under this section when no longer
    needed for official use shall be disposed of in the same manner as
    other surplus property.
      (f) Payment of Costs Related to Property. - 
        (1) Availability of appropriations. - The appropriation
      available to an agency for the purchase, hire, operation,
      maintenance, and repair of any property is available for - 
          (A) the payment of expenses of operation, maintenance, and
        repair of property of the same kind the agency receives under
        this section for official use;
          (B) the payment of a lien recognized and allowed under law;
          (C) the payment of amounts found to be due a person on the
        authorized remission or mitigation of a forfeiture; and
          (D) reimbursement of other agencies as provided in paragraph
        (2).

        (2) Payment and reimbursement of certain costs. - The agency
      that receives property under this section shall pay the cost of
      hauling, transporting, towing, and storing the property. If the
      property is later delivered to another agency for official use
      under this section, the agency to which the property is delivered
      shall make reimbursement for all of those costs incurred prior to
      the date the property is delivered.

      (g) Report. - With the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury,
    the Administrator may require an agency to make a report of all
    property abandoned to it or seized and the disposal of the
    property.
      (h) Administrative. - 
        (1) Regulations. - With the approval of the Secretary, the
      Administrator may prescribe regulations necessary to carry out
      this section.
        (2) Other laws not repealed. - This section does not repeal any
      other laws relating to the disposition of forfeited or abandoned
      property, except provisions of those laws directly in conflict
      with this section which were enacted prior to August 27, 1935.
        (3) Property not subject to allocation under this section. -
      The following classes of property are not subject to allocation
      under this section, but shall be disposed of in the manner
      otherwise provided by law:
          (A) narcotic drugs, as defined in the Controlled Substances
        Act (21 U.S.C. 801 et seq.).
          (B) firearms, as defined in section 5845 of the Internal
        Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 5845).
          (C) other classes or kinds of property the disposal of which
        the Administrator, with the approval of the Secretary, may
        consider in the public interest, and may by regulation provide.

      In this section, the words "Administrator" and "Administrator of
    General Services" are substituted for "Director" and "Director of
    the Procurement Division of the Treasury Department of the United
    States" [subsequently changed to "Bureau of Federal Supply" by
    regulation Sec. 5.7 of subpart A of Part 5 of Title 41, Public
    Contracts, eff. January 1, 1947, 11 F. R. 13636] because of section
    102(a) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of
    1949 (ch. 288, 63 Stat. 380), which is restated as section
    303(a)(1) of the revised title.
      In subsection (a), the text of 40:304f(3) is omitted because the
    complete name of the Administrator of General Services is used the

      The Administrator of General Services may make contracts and
    provisions for the preservation, sale, or collection of property,
    or the proceeds of property, which may have been wrecked, been
    abandoned, or become derelict, if the Administrator considers the
    contracts and provisions to be in the interest of the Federal
    Government and the property is within the jurisdiction of the
    United States and should come to the Government. A contract may
    provide compensation the Administrator considers just and
    reasonable to any person who gives information about the property
    or actually preserves, collects, surrenders, or pays over the
    property. Under each specific agreement for obtaining, preserving,
    collecting, or receiving property or making property available, the
    costs or claim chargeable to the Government may not exceed amounts
    realized and received by the Government.

-STATUTE-
      (a) Stipulation of Discharge. - 
        (1) Person asserting claim entitled to benefits. - In a
      judicial proceeding under the laws of a State, district,
      territory, or possession of the United States, when property
      owned or held by the Federal Government, or in which the
      Government has or claims an interest, is seized, arrested,
      attached, or held for the security or satisfaction of a claim
      made against the property, the Attorney General may direct the
      United States Attorney for the district in which the property is
      located to enter a stipulation that on discharge of the property
      from the seizure, arrest, attachment, or proceeding, the person
      asserting the claim against the property becomes entitled to all
      the benefits of this section.
        (2) Nonapplication. - This subsection does not - 
          (A) recognize or concede any right to enforce by seizure,
        arrest, attachment, or any judicial process a claim against
        property - 
            (i) of the Government; or
            (ii) held, owned, or employed by the Government, or by a
          department of the Government, for a public use; or

          (B) waive an objection to a proceeding brought to enforce the
        claim.

      (b) Payment. - After a discharge, a final judgment which affirms
    the claim for the security or satisfaction and the right of the
    person asserting the claim to enforce it against the property,
    notwithstanding the claims of the Government, is deemed to be a
    full and final determination of the rights of the person and
    entitles the person, as against the Government, to the rights the
    person would have had if possession of the property had not been
    changed. When the claim is for the payment of money found to be
    due, presentation of an authenticated copy of the record of the
    judgment and proceedings is sufficient evidence to the proper
    accounting officers for the allowance of the claim, which shall be
    allowed and paid out of amounts in the Treasury not otherwise
    appropriated. The amount allowed and paid shall not exceed the
    value of the interest of the Government in the property.

      In subsection (a)(1), the words "territory, or possession of the
    United States" are substituted for "or territory" for consistency
    in the revised title and with other titles of the United States
    Code. The words "in his discretion" are omitted as unnecessary. The
    words "General Counsel for the department of Treasury" were
    substituted for "Solicitor of the Treasury" in section 3753 of the
    Revised Statutes because section 512(b) of the Revenue Act of 1934
    (ch. 277, 48 Stat. 759) abolished the offices of General Counsel
    and Assistant General Counsel for the Bureau of Internal Revenue
    and the offices of Solicitor and Assistant Solicitor of the
    Treasury and transferred the powers, duties, and functions of those
    offices to the General Counsel for the Department of the Treasury.
      In subsection (b), the words "in the court of last resort to
    which the Attorney General may deem proper to cause such
    proceedings to be carried", "to all intents and purposes", "and the
    same is by such judgment found to be due", and "duly" are omitted
    as unnecessary.

    agency of a State, or a person applies for the grant of an easement
    in, over, or on real property of the Government, the executive
    agency having control of the real property may grant to the
    applicant, on behalf of the Government, an easement that the head
    of the agency decides will not be adverse to the interests of the
    Government, subject to reservations, exceptions, limitations,
    benefits, burdens, terms, or conditions that the head of the agency
    considers necessary to protect the interests of the Government. The
    grant may be made without consideration, or with monetary or other

    or by proceeding in the manner that the laws applicable to the
    State may provide.
      (d) Termination of Easement. - 
        (1) When termination occurs. - The instrument granting the

      to the grantee, or its successors or assigns.
        (3) Effective date. - The termination is effective as of the
      date of the notice.

      (e) Additional Easement Authority. - The authority conferred by
    this section is in addition to, and shall not affect or be subject
    to, any other law under which an executive agency may grant
    easements.
      (f) Limitation on Issuance of Rights of Way. - Rights of way
    over, under, and through public lands and lands in the National

    in subsection (a) to enforce laws enacted for the protection of
    individuals and property, prevent breaches of the peace, suppress
    affrays or unlawful assemblies, and enforce regulations prescribed
    by the Administrator or an official of the Administration
    authorized by the Administrator for property under their
    jurisdiction. However, the jurisdiction and policing powers of
    special police do not extend to the service of civil process.
      "(c) Detail. - On the application of the head of a department or
    agency of the Government having property of the Government under
    its administration and control, the Administrator or an official of
    the Administration authorized by the Administrator may detail
    special police for the protection of the property and, if the
    Administrator considers it desirable, may extend to the property
    the applicability of regulations and enforce them as provided in
    this section.
      "(d) Use of Other Law Enforcement Agencies. - When it is
    considered economical and in the public interest, the Administrator
    or an official of the Administration authorized by the
    Administrator may utilize the facilities and services of existing
    federal law enforcement agencies, and, with the consent of a state
    or local agency, the facilities and services of state or local law
    enforcement agencies.
      "(e) Nonuniformed Special Police. - The Administrator, or an
    official of the Administration authorized by the Administrator, may
    empower officials or employees of the Administration authorized to
    perform investigative functions to act as nonuniformed special
    police to protect property under the charge and control of the
    Administration and to carry firearms, whether on federal property
    or in travel status. When on real property under the charge and
    control of the Administration, officials or employees empowered to
    act as nonuniformed special police have the power to enforce
    federal laws for the protection of individuals and property and to
    enforce regulations for that purpose that the Administrator or an
    official of the Administration authorized by the Administrator
    prescribes and publishes. The special police may make arrests
    without warrant for any offense committed on the property if the
    police have reasonable grounds to believe the offense constitutes a
    felony under the laws of the United States and that the individual
    to be arrested is guilty of that offense.
      "(f) Administrative. - The Administrator or an official of the
    Administration authorized by the Administrator may prescribe
    regulations necessary for the government of the property under
    their charge and control, and may annex to the regulations
    reasonable penalties, within the limits prescribed in subsection
    (g), that will ensure their enforcement. The regulations shall be
    posted and kept posted in a conspicuous place on the property.
      "(g) Penalties. - 
        "(1) In general. - Except as provided in paragraph (2), a
      person violating a regulation prescribed under subsection (f)
      shall be fined under title 18, imprisoned for not more than 30
      days, or both.
        "(2) Exception for military traffic regulation. - 
          "(A) Definition. - For purposes of this paragraph, the term
        'military traffic regulation' means a regulation for the
        control of vehicular or pedestrian traffic on military
        installations that the Secretary of Defense prescribes under
        subsection (f).
          "(B) In general. - A person violating a military traffic
        regulation shall be fined an amount not exceeding the amount of
        the maximum fine for a similar offense under the criminal or
        civil law of the State, district, territory, or possession of
        the United States where the military installation in which the
        violation occurred is located, imprisoned for not more than 30
        days, or both."

      The word "subtreasuries" in the 6th complete paragraph on p. 614
    of section 1 of the Act of July 1, 1898 (ch. 546, 30 Stat. 614), is
    omitted because section 1 (words in par. under heading "Independent
    Treasury") of the Act of May 29, 1914 (ch. 214, 41 Stat. 654)
    discontinued subtreasuries. The word "post-offices" in section 1 is
    omitted because section 1 of Executive Order No. 6166 (eff. June
    10, 1933) transferred administration of post office buildings to
    the Post Office Department. The words "courthouses, customhouses,
    appraiser's stores, barge offices, and other" are omitted as
    unnecessary. The words "or are in course of construction" are
    omitted as obsolete. The words "Administrator of General Services"
    are substituted for "Treasury Department" and "Secretary of the
    Treasury" [subsequently changed to "Federal Works Agency" and
    "Federal Works Administrator" because of sections 301 and 303,
    respectively, of Reorganization Plan No. I of 1939 (eff. July 1,
    1939, 53 Stat. 1426, 1427)] because of section 103(a) of the
    Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (ch. 288,
    63 Stat. 380), which is restated as section 303(c) [303(b)] of the

     PROHIBITION OF CIGARETTE SALES TO MINORS IN FEDERAL BUILDINGS AND

      Pub. L. 104-52, title VI, Sec. 636, Nov. 19, 1995, 109 Stat. 507,
    known as the "Prohibition of Cigarette Sales to Minors in Federal
    Buildings and Lands Act", required the Administrator of General
    Services and the head of each Federal agency to promulgate
    regulations, to be reported to Congress, prohibiting the sale of
    tobacco products in vending machines or distribution of free
    samples of tobacco products located in or around any Federal
    building under the jurisdiction of the Administrator or agency
    head, and provided that the appropriate congressional committees
    would promulgate regulations prohibiting tobacco sales in vending
    machines in certain congressional buildings.

        (1) Determination and award. - Compensation shall be determined
      and awarded in the proceeding and established by judgment. The
      judgment shall include interest, in accordance with section 3116
      of this title, on the amount finally awarded as the value of the
      property as of the date of taking and shall be awarded from that
      date to the date of payment. Interest shall not be allowed on as
      much of the compensation as has been paid into the court. Amounts
      paid into the court shall not be charged with commissions or
      poundage.
        (2) Order to pay. - On application of the parties in interest,
      the court may order that any part of the money deposited in the
      court be paid immediately for or on account of the compensation
      to be awarded in the proceeding.
        (3) Deficiency judgment. - If the compensation finally awarded
      is more than the amount of money received by any person entitled
      to compensation, the court shall enter judgment against the
      Government for the amount of the deficiency.

      (d) Authority of Court. - On the filing of a declaration of
    taking, the court - 
        (1) may fix the time within which, and the terms on which, the
      parties in possession shall be required to surrender possession
      to the petitioner; and
        (2) may make just and equitable orders in respect of
      encumbrances, liens, rents, taxes, assessments, insurance, and
      other charges.

      (e) Vesting Not Prevented or Delayed. - An appeal or a bond or
    undertaking given in a proceeding does not prevent or delay the
    vesting of title to land in the Government.

-STATUTE-
      (a) Requirement for Irrevocable Commitment. - Action under
    section 3114 of this title irrevocably committing the Federal
    Government to the payment of the ultimate award shall not be taken
    unless the head of the executive department or agency or bureau of
    the Government empowered to acquire the land believes that the

      (b) Authorized Purposes of Expenditures After Irrevocable
    Commitment Made. - When the Government has taken or may take title
    to real property during a condemnation proceeding and in advance of
    final judgment in the proceeding and has become irrevocably
    committed to pay the amount ultimately to be awarded as
    compensation, and the Attorney General believes that title to the
    property has been vested in the Government or that all persons
    having an interest in the property have been made parties to the
    proceeding and will be bound by the final judgment, the Government
    may expend amounts appropriated for that purpose to demolish
    existing structures on the property and to erect public buildings
    or public works on the property.

-STATUTE-
      (a) Calculation. - The district court shall calculate interest
    required to be paid under this subchapter as follows:
        (1) Period of not more than one year. - Where the period for
      which interest is owed is not more than one year, interest shall
      be calculated from the date of taking at an annual rate equal to
      the weekly average one-year constant maturity Treasury yield, as
      published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
      System, for the calendar week preceding the date of taking.
        (2) Period of more than one year. - Where the period for which
      interest is owed is more than one year, interest for the first
      year shall be calculated in accordance with paragraph (1) and
      interest for each additional year shall be calculated on the
      amount by which the award of compensation is more than the
      deposit referred to in section 3114 of this title, plus accrued
      interest, at an annual rate equal to the weekly average one-year
      constant maturity Treasury yield, as published by the Board of
      Governors of the Federal Reserve System, for the calendar week
      preceding the beginning of each additional year.

      (b) Distribution of Notice of Rates. - The Director of the
    Administrative Office of the United States Courts shall distribute
    to all federal courts notice of the rates described in paragraphs
    (1) and (2) of subsection (a).

-HEAD-
    Sec. 3131. Bonds of contractors of public buildings or works

-STATUTE-
      (a) Definition. - In this subchapter, the term "contractor" means
    a person awarded a contract described in subsection (b).
      (b) Type of Bonds Required. - Before any contract of more than
    $100,000 is awarded for the construction, alteration, or repair of
    any public building or public work of the Federal Government, a
    person must furnish to the Government the following bonds, which
    become binding when the contract is awarded:
        (1) Performance bond. - A performance bond with a surety
      satisfactory to the officer awarding the contract, and in an
      amount the officer considers adequate, for the protection of the
      Government.
        (2) Payment bond. - A payment bond with a surety satisfactory
      to the officer for the protection of all persons supplying labor
      and material in carrying out the work provided for in the
      contract for the use of each person. The amount of the payment
      bond shall equal the total amount payable by the terms of the
      contract unless the officer awarding the contract determines, in
      a writing supported by specific findings, that a payment bond in
      that amount is impractical, in which case the contracting officer
      shall set the amount of the payment bond. The amount of the
      payment bond shall not be less than the amount of the performance
      bond.

      (c) Coverage for Taxes in Performance Bond. - 
        (1) In general. - Every performance bond required under this
      section specifically shall provide coverage for taxes the
      Government imposes which are collected, deducted, or withheld
      from wages the contractor pays in carrying out the contract with
      respect to which the bond is furnished.
        (2) Notice. - The Government shall give the surety on the bond
      written notice, with respect to any unpaid taxes attributable to
      any period, within 90 days after the date when the contractor
      files a return for the period, except that notice must be given
      no later than 180 days from the date when a return for the period
      was required to be filed under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986
      (26 U.S.C. 1 et seq.).
        (3) Civil action. - The Government may not bring a civil action
      on the bond for the taxes - 
          (A) unless notice is given as provided in this subsection;
        and
          (B) more than one year after the day on which notice is
        given.

      (d) Waiver of Bonds for Contracts Performed in Foreign Countries.
    - A contracting officer may waive the requirement of a performance
    bond and payment bond for work under a contract that is to be
    performed in a foreign country if the officer finds that it is
    impracticable for the contractor to furnish the bonds.
      (e) Authority To Require Additional Bonds. - This section does
    not limit the authority of a contracting officer to require a
    performance bond or other security in addition to those, or in
    cases other than the cases, specified in subsection (b).

        (4) Period in which action must be brought. - An action brought
      under this subsection must be brought no later than one year
      after the day on which the last of the labor was performed or
      material was supplied by the person bringing the action.
        (5) Liability of federal government. - The Government is not
      liable for the payment of any costs or expenses of any civil
      action brought under this subsection.

      (c) Waiver of Right to Civil Action. - A waiver of the right to
    bring a civil action on a payment bond required under this
    subchapter is void unless the waiver is - 
        (1) in writing;
        (2) signed by the person whose right is waived; and
        (3) executed after the person whose right is waived has

-HEAD-
    Sec. 3142. Rate of wages for laborers and mechanics

-STATUTE-
      (a) Application. - The advertised specifications for every
    contract in excess of $2,000, to which the Federal Government or
    the District of Columbia is a party, for construction, alteration,
    or repair, including painting and decorating, of public buildings
    and public works of the Government or the District of Columbia that
    are located in a State or the District of Columbia and which
    requires or involves the employment of mechanics or laborers shall
    contain a provision stating the minimum wages to be paid various
    classes of laborers and mechanics.
      (b) Based on Prevailing Wage. - The minimum wages shall be based
    on the wages the Secretary of Labor determines to be prevailing for
    the corresponding classes of laborers and mechanics employed on
    projects of a character similar to the contract work in the civil
    subdivision of the State in which the work is to be performed, or
    in the District of Columbia if the work is to be performed there.
      (c) Stipulations Required in Contract. - Every contract based
    upon the specifications referred to in subsection (a) must contain
    stipulations that - 
        (1) the contractor or subcontractor shall pay all mechanics and
      laborers employed directly on the site of the work,
      unconditionally and at least once a week, and without subsequent
      deduction or rebate on any account, the full amounts accrued at
      time of payment, computed at wage rates not less than those
      stated in the advertised specifications, regardless of any
      contractual relationship which may be alleged to exist between
      the contractor or subcontractor and the laborers and mechanics;
        (2) the contractor will post the scale of wages to be paid in a
      prominent and easily accessible place at the site of the work;
      and
        (3) there may be withheld from the contractor so much of
      accrued payments as the contracting officer considers necessary
      to pay to laborers and mechanics employed by the contractor or
      any subcontractor on the work the difference between the rates of
      wages required by the contract to be paid laborers and mechanics
      on the work and the rates of wages received by the laborers and
      mechanics and not refunded to the contractor or subcontractors or
      their agents.

      (d) Discharge of Obligation. - The obligation of a contractor or
    subcontractor to make payment in accordance with the prevailing
    wage determinations of the Secretary of Labor, under this
    subchapter and other laws incorporating this subchapter by
    reference, may be discharged by making payments in cash, by making
    contributions described in section 3141(2)(B)(i) of this title, by
    assuming an enforceable commitment to bear the costs of a plan or
    program referred to in section 3141(2)(B)(ii) of this title, or by
    any combination of payment, contribution, and assumption, where the
    aggregate of the payments, contributions, and costs is not less
    than the basic hourly rate of pay plus the amount referred to in
    section 3141(2)(B) of this title.
      (e) Overtime Pay. - In determining the overtime pay to which a
    laborer or mechanic is entitled under any federal law, the regular
    or basic hourly rate of pay (or other alternative rate on which
    premium rate of overtime compensation is computed) of the laborer
    or mechanic is deemed to be the rate computed under section
    3141(2)(A) of this title, except that where the amount of payments,
    contributions, or costs incurred with respect to the laborer or
    mechanic exceeds the applicable prevailing wage, the regular or
    basic hourly rate of pay (or other alternative rate) is the amount
    of payments, contributions, or costs actually incurred with respect
    to the laborer or mechanic minus the greater of the amount of
    contributions or costs of the types described in section 3141(2)(B)
    of this title actually incurred with respect to the laborer or
    mechanic or the amount determined under section 3141(2)(B) of this
    title but not actually paid.

-STATUTE-
      (a) Payment of Wages. - 
        (1) In general. - The Comptroller General shall pay directly to
      laborers and mechanics from any accrued payments withheld under
      the terms of a contract any wages found to be due laborers and
      mechanics under this subchapter.
        (2) Right of action. - If the accrued payments withheld under
      the terms of the contract are insufficient to reimburse all the
      laborers and mechanics who have not been paid the wages required
      under this subchapter, the laborers and mechanics have the same
      right to bring a civil action and intervene against the
      contractor and the contractor's sureties as is conferred by law
      on persons furnishing labor or materials. In those proceedings it
      is not a defense that the laborers and mechanics accepted or
      agreed to accept less than the required rate of wages or
      voluntarily made refunds.

      (b) List of Contractors Violating Contracts. - 
        (1) In general. - The Comptroller General shall distribute to
      all departments of the Federal Government a list of the names of
      persons whom the Comptroller General has found to have
      disregarded their obligations to employees and subcontractors.
        (2) Restriction on awarding contracts. - No contract shall be
      awarded to persons appearing on the list or to any firm,
      corporation, partnership, or association in which the persons
      have an interest until three years have elapsed from the date of
      publication of the list.

    Sec. 3162. Waiver for individuals who perform volunteer services

-STATUTE-
      (a) Criteria for Receiving Waiver. - The requirement that certain
    laborers and mechanics be paid in accordance with the wage-setting
    provisions of subchapter IV of this chapter as set forth in the
    Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C.
    450 et seq.), the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (25 U.S.C.
    1601 et seq.), and the Housing and Community Development Act of
    1974 (42 U.S.C. 5301 et seq.) does not apply to an individual - 
        (1) who volunteers to perform a service directly to a state or
      local government, a public agency, or a public or private
      nonprofit recipient of federal assistance - 
          (A) for civic, charitable, or humanitarian reasons;
          (B) only for the personal purpose or pleasure of the
        individual;
          (C) without promise, expectation, or receipt of compensation
        for services rendered, except as provided in subsection (b);
        and
          (D) freely and without pressure or coercion, direct or
        implied, from any employer;

        (2) whose contribution of service is not for the direct or
      indirect benefit of any contractor otherwise performing or
      seeking to perform work on the same project for which the
      individual is volunteering;
        (3) who is not employed by and does not provide services to a
      contractor or subcontractor at any time on the federally assisted
      or insured project for which the individual is volunteering; and
        (4) who otherwise is not employed by the same public agency or
      recipient of federal assistance to perform the same type of
      services as those for which the individual proposes to volunteer.

      (b) Payments. - 
        (1) In accordance with regulations. - Volunteers described in
      subsection (a) who are performing services directly to a state or
      local government or public agency may receive payments of
      expenses, reasonable benefits, or a nominal fee only in
      accordance with regulations the Secretary of Labor prescribes.
      Volunteers who are performing services directly to a public or
      private nonprofit entity may not receive those payments.
        (2) Criteria and content of regulations. - In prescribing the
      regulations, the Secretary shall consider criteria such as the
      total amount of payments made (relating to expenses, benefits, or
      fees) in the context of the economic realities. The regulations
      shall include provisions that provide that - 
          (A) a payment for an expense may be received by a volunteer
        for items such as uniform allowances, protective gear and
        clothing, reimbursement for approximate out-of-pocket expenses,
        or the cost or expense of meals and transportation;
          (B) a reasonable benefit may include the inclusion of a
        volunteer in a group insurance plan (such as a liability,
        health, life, disability, or worker's compensation plan) or
        pension plan, or the awarding of a length of service award; and
          (C) a nominal fee may not be used as a substitute for
        compensation and may not be connected to productivity.

        (3) Nominal fee. - The Secretary shall decide what constitutes
      a nominal fee for purposes of paragraph (2)(C). The decision
      shall be based on the context of the economic realities of the
      situation involved.

      (c) Economic Reality. - In determining whether an expense,
    benefit, or fee described in subsection (b) may be paid to
    volunteers in the context of the economic realities of the
    particular situation, the Secretary may not permit any expense,
    benefit, or fee that has the effect of undermining labor standards
    by creating downward pressure on prevailing wages in the local
    construction industry.

      In subsection (a), the text of 40:612(2) and 612a(1) is omitted
    because the complete name of the Administrator of General Services
    is used the first time the term appears in a section. In clause
    (5)(A), the words "mixed-ownership Government corporation" are
    substituted for "mixed ownership corporation" for consistency with
    31:9101. In clause (5)(B) and (C), the words "from time to time
    hereafter" are omitted as unnecessary. In clause (6), the words
    "territories and" are added for consistency in the revised title
    and with other titles of the United States Code.
      In subsection (b), the text of 40:613(1)-(3) is omitted as
    obsolete. The reference is to section 241(g) of the Immigration and
    Nationality Act rather than to section 242(c) to reflect the
    amendment of sections 241 and 242 by sections 305(a)(3) and
    306(a)(2) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant
    Responsibility Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-208, div. C, 110 Stat.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 3305. Construction and alteration of buildings

-STATUTE-
      (a) Construction. - 
        (1) Replacement of existing buildings. - When the Administrator
      of General Services considers it to be in the best interest of
      the Federal Government to construct a new public building to take
      the place of an existing public building, the Administrator may
      demolish the existing building and use the site on which it is
      located for the site of the proposed public building. If the
      Administrator believes that it is more advantageous to construct
      the public building on a different site in the same city, the
      Administrator may exchange the building and site, or the site,
      for another site, or may sell the building and site in accordance
      with subtitle I of this title and title III of the Federal
      Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41 U.S.C. 251
      et seq.).
        (2) Sale or exchange of sites. - When the Administrator decides
      that a site acquired for the construction of a public building is
      not suitable for that purpose, the Administrator may exchange the
      site for another site, or may sell it in accordance with subtitle
      I of this title and title III of the Federal Property and
      Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41 U.S.C. 251 et seq.).
        (3) Committee approval required. - This subsection does not
      permit the Administrator to use any land as a site for a public
      building if the project has not been approved in accordance with
      section 3307 of this title.

      (b) Alteration of Buildings. - 
        (1) Authority to alter buildings and acquire land. - The
      Administrator may - 
          (A) alter any public building; and
          (B) acquire in accordance with section 3304(b)-(d) of this
        title land necessary to carry out the alteration.

        (2) Committee approval not required. - 
          (A) Threshold amount. - Approval under section 3307 of this
        title is not required for any alteration and acquisition
        authorized by this subsection for which the estimated maximum
        cost does not exceed $1,500,000.
          (B) Dollar amount adjustment. - The Administrator annually
        may adjust the dollar amount referred to in subparagraph (A) to
        reflect a percentage increase or decrease in construction costs
        during the prior calendar year, as determined by the composite
        index of construction costs of the Department of Commerce. Any
        adjustment shall be expeditiously reported to the Committee on
        Environment and Public Works of the Senate and the Committee on
        Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of
        Representatives.

      (c) Construction or Alteration by Contract. - The Administrator
    may carry out any construction or alteration authorized by this
    chapter by contract if the Administrator considers it to be most
    advantageous to the Government.

        EX. ORD. NO. 13006. LOCATING FEDERAL FACILITIES ON HISTORIC
                 PROPERTIES IN OUR NATION'S CENTRAL CITIES
      Ex. Ord. No. 13006, May 21, 1996, 61 F.R. 26071, provided:
      By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution
    and the laws of the United States of America, including the
    National Historic Preservation Act (16 U.S.C. 470 et seq.) and the
    Public Buildings Cooperative Use Act of 1976 (90 Stat. 2505) [title
    I of Pub. L. 94-541, see Tables for classification], and in
    furtherance of and consistent with Executive Order No. 12072 of
    August 16, 1978 [40 U.S.C. 121 note], and Executive Order No. 11593
    of May 13, 1971 [16 U.S.C. 470 note], it is hereby ordered as
    follows:
      Section 1. Statement of Policy. Through the Administration's
    community empowerment initiatives, the Federal Government has
    undertaken various efforts to revitalize our central cities, which
    have historically served as the centers for growth and commerce in
    our metropolitan areas. Accordingly, the Administration hereby
    reaffirms the commitment set forth in Executive Order No. 12072 to
    strengthen our Nation's cities by encouraging the location of
    Federal facilities in our central cities. The Administration also
    reaffirms the commitments set forth in the National Historic
    Preservation Act to provide leadership in the preservation of
    historic resources, and in the Public Buildings Cooperative Use Act
    of 1976 to acquire and utilize space in suitable buildings of
    historic, architectural, or cultural significance.
      To this end, the Federal Government shall utilize and maintain,
    wherever operationally appropriate and economically prudent,
    historic properties and districts, especially those located in our
    central business areas. When implementing these policies, the
    Federal Government shall institute practices and procedures that
    are sensible, understandable, and compatible with current authority
    and that impose the least burden on, and provide the maximum
    benefit to, society.
      Sec. 2. Encouraging the Location of Federal Facilities on
    Historic Properties in Our Central Cities. When operationally
    appropriate and economically prudent, and subject to the
    requirements of section 601 of title VI of the Rural Development
    Act of 1972, as amended (42 U.S.C. 3122) [now 7 U.S.C. 2204b-1],
    and Executive Order No. 12072, when locating Federal facilities,
    Federal agencies shall give first consideration to historic
    properties within historic districts. If no such property is
    suitable, then Federal agencies shall consider other developed or
    undeveloped sites within historic districts. Federal agencies shall
    then consider historic properties outside of historic districts, if
    no suitable site within a district exists. Any rehabilitation or
    construction that is undertaken pursuant to this order must be
    architecturally compatible with the character of the surrounding
    historic district or properties.
      Sec. 3. Identifying and Removing Regulatory Barriers. Federal
    agencies with responsibilities for leasing, acquiring, locating,
    maintaining, or managing Federal facilities or with
    responsibilities for the planning for, or managing of, historic
    resources shall take steps to reform, streamline, and otherwise
    minimize regulations, policies, and procedures that impede the
    Federal Government's ability to establish or maintain a presence in
    historic districts or to acquire historic properties to satisfy
    Federal space needs, unless such regulations, policies, and
    procedures are designed to protect human health and safety or the
    environment. Federal agencies are encouraged to seek the assistance
    of the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation when taking these
    steps.
      Sec. 4. Improving Preservation Partnerships. In carrying out the
    authorities of the National Historic Preservation Act, the
    Secretary of the Interior, the Advisory Council on Historic
    Preservation, and each Federal agency shall seek appropriate
    partnerships with States, local governments, Indian tribes, and
    appropriate private organizations with the goal of enhancing
    participation of these parties in the National Historic
    Preservation Program. Such partnerships should embody the
    principles of administrative flexibility, reduced paperwork, and
    increased service to the public.
      Sec. 5. Judicial Review. This order is not intended to create,
    nor does it create, any right or benefit, substantive or
    procedural, enforceable at law by a party against the United
    States, its agencies or instrumentalities, its officers or
    employees, or any other person.

-STATUTE-
      (a) Resolutions Required Before Appropriations May Be Made. - The
    following appropriations may be made only if the Committee on
    Environment and Public Works of the Senate and the Committee on
    Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives
    adopt resolutions approving the purpose for which the appropriation
    is made:
        (1) An appropriation to construct, alter, or acquire any
      building to be used as a public building which involves a total
      expenditure in excess of $1,500,000, so that the equitable
      distribution of public buildings throughout the United States
      with due regard for the comparative urgency of need for the
      buildings, except as provided in section 3305(b) of this title,
      is ensured.
        (2) An appropriation to lease any space at an average annual
      rental in excess of $1,500,000 for use for public purposes.
        (3) An appropriation to alter any building, or part of the
      building, which is under lease by the Federal Government for use
      for a public purpose if the cost of the alteration will exceed
      $750,000.

      (b) Transmission to Congress of Prospectus of Proposed Project. -
    To secure consideration for the approval referred to in subsection
    (a), the Administrator of General Services shall transmit to
    Congress a prospectus of the proposed facility, including - 
        (1) a brief description of the building to be constructed,
      altered, or acquired, or the space to be leased, under this
      chapter;
        (2) the location of the building or space to be leased and an
      estimate of the maximum cost to the Government of the facility to
      be constructed, altered, or acquired, or the space to be leased;
        (3) a comprehensive plan for providing space for all Government
      officers and employees in the locality of the proposed facility
      or the space to be leased, having due regard for suitable space
      which may continue to be available in existing Government-owned
      or occupied buildings, especially those buildings that enhance
      the architectural, historical, social, cultural, and economic
      environment of the locality;
        (4) with respect to any project for the construction,
      alteration, or acquisition of any building, a statement by the
      Administrator that suitable space owned by the Government is not
      available and that suitable rental space is not available at a
      price commensurate with that to be afforded through the proposed
      action;
        (5) a statement by the Administrator of the economic and other
      justifications for not acquiring a building identified to the
      Administrator under section 3303(c) of this title as suitable for
      the public building needs of the Government; and
        (6) a statement of rents and other housing costs currently
      being paid by the Government for federal agencies to be housed in
      the building to be constructed, altered, or acquired, or the
      space to be leased.

      (c) Increase of Estimated Maximum Cost. - The estimated maximum
    cost of any project approved under this section as set forth in any
    prospectus may be increased by an amount equal to any percentage
    increase, as determined by the Administrator, in construction or
    alteration costs from the date the prospectus is transmitted to
    Congress. The increase authorized by this subsection may not exceed
    10 percent of the estimated maximum cost.
      (d) Rescission of Approval. - If an appropriation is not made
    within one year after the date a project for construction,
    alteration, or acquisition is approved under subsection (a), the
    Committee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate or the
    Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of
    Representatives by resolution may rescind its approval before an
    appropriation is made.
      (e) Emergency Leases by the Administrator. - This section does
    not prevent the Administrator from entering into emergency leases
    during any period declared by the President to require emergency
    leasing authority. An emergency lease may not be for more than 180
    days without approval of a prospectus for the lease in accordance
    with subsection (a).
      (f) Limitation on Leasing Certain Space. - 
        (1) In general. - The Administrator may not lease space to
      accommodate any of the following if the average rental cost of
      leasing the space will exceed $1,500,000:
          (A) Computer and telecommunications operations.
          (B) Secure or sensitive activities related to the national
        defense or security, except when it would be inappropriate to
        locate those activities in a public building or other facility
        identified with the Government.
          (C) A permanent courtroom, judicial chamber, or
        administrative office for any United States court.

        (2) Exception. - The Administrator may lease space with respect
      to which paragraph (1) applies if the Administrator - 
          (A) decides, for reasons set forth in writing, that leasing
        the space is necessary to meet requirements which cannot be met
        in public buildings; and
          (B) submits the reasons to the Committee on Environment and
        Public Works of the Senate and the Committee on Transportation
        and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives.

      (g) Dollar Amount Adjustment. - The Administrator annually may
    adjust any dollar amount referred to in this section to reflect a
    percentage increase or decrease in construction costs during the
    prior calendar year, as determined by the composite index of
    construction costs of the Department of Commerce. Any adjustment
    shall be expeditiously reported to the Committee on Environment and
    Public Works of the Senate and the Committee on Transportation and
    Infrastructure of the House of Representatives.

-STATUTE-
      (a) In General. - The purposes of this chapter shall be carried
    out in the District of Columbia as nearly as may be practicable in
    harmony with the plan of Peter Charles L'Enfant. Public buildings
    shall be constructed or altered to combine architectural beauty

    streets that lie between the squares, and alleys that intersect the
    squares, may be closed and vacated if agreed to by the

      construction or alteration of a building for which amounts are
      first appropriated for a fiscal year beginning after September
      30, 1989.
        (2) National security waiver. - This section does not apply to
      a building for which the Administrator of General Services or the
      head of the federal agency authorized to construct or alter the
      building decides that the application of this section to the
      building would adversely affect national security. A decision
      under this subsection is not subject to administrative or
      judicial review.

      (b) Building Codes. - Each building constructed or altered by the
    General Services Administration or any other federal agency shall
    be constructed or altered, to the maximum extent feasible as
    determined by the Administrator or the head of the federal agency,
    in compliance with one of the nationally recognized model building
    codes and with other applicable nationally recognized codes,
    including electrical codes, fire and life safety codes, and
    plumbing codes, as the Administrator decides is appropriate. In
    carrying out this subsection, the Administrator or the head of the
    federal agency shall use the latest edition of the nationally
    recognized codes.
      (c) Zoning Laws. - Each building constructed or altered by the
    Administration or any other federal agency shall be constructed or
    altered only after consideration of all requirements (except
    procedural requirements) of the following laws of a State or a
    political subdivision of a State, which would apply to the building
    if it were not a building constructed or altered by a federal
    agency:
        (1) Zoning laws.
        (2) Laws relating to landscaping, open space, minimum distance
      of a building from the property line, maximum height of a
      building, historic preservation, esthetic qualities of a
      building, and other similar laws.

      (d) Cooperation With State and Local Officials. - 
        (1) State and local government consultation, review, and
      inspections. - To meet the requirements of subsections (b) and
      (c), the Administrator or the head of the federal agency
      authorized to construct or alter the building - 
          (A) in preparing plans for the building, shall consult with
        appropriate officials of the State or political subdivision of
        a State, or both, in which the building will be located;
          (B) on request shall submit the plans in a timely manner to
        the officials for review by the officials for a reasonable
        period of time not exceeding 30 days; and
          (C) shall permit inspection by the officials during
        construction or alteration of the building, in accordance with
        the customary schedule of inspections for construction or
        alteration of buildings in the locality, if the officials
        provide to the Administrator or the head of the federal agency -
         
            (i) a copy of the schedule before construction of the
          building is begun; and
            (ii) reasonable notice of their intention to conduct any
          inspection before conducting the inspection.

        (2) Limitation on responsibilities. - This section does not
      impose an obligation on any State or political subdivision to
      take any action under paragraph (1).

      (e) State and Local Government Recommendations. - Appropriate
    officials of a State or political subdivision of a State may make
    recommendations to the Administrator or the head of the federal
    agency authorized to construct or alter a building concerning
    measures necessary to meet the requirements of subsections (b) and
    (c). The officials also may make recommendations to the
    Administrator or the head of the federal agency concerning measures
    which should be taken in the construction or alteration of the
    building to take into account local conditions. The Administrator
    or the head of the agency shall give due consideration to the
    recommendations.
      (f) Effect of Noncompliance. - An action may not be brought
    against the Federal Government and a fine or penalty may not be
    imposed against the Government for failure to meet the requirements
    of subsection (b), (c), or (d) or for failure to carry out any
    recommendation under subsection (e).
      (g) Limitation on Liability. - The Government and its contractors
    shall not be required to pay any amount for any action a State or a
    political subdivision of a State takes to carry out this section,
    including reviewing plans, carrying out on-site inspections,
    issuing building permits, and making recommendations.

      In clause (1), the words "or 'public agencies' " are omitted as

      (a) Advances To Ensure Planning. - Notwithstanding section
    3324(a) and (b) of title 31, the Secretary of Housing and Urban
    Development may make advances to public agencies and Indian tribes -
     
        (1) to encourage public agencies and Indian tribes to maintain
      at all times a current and adequate reserve of planned public
      works the construction of which can rapidly be commenced,
      particularly when the national or local economic situation makes
      that action desirable; and
        (2) to help attain maximum economy and efficiency in the
      planning and construction of public works.

      (b) Uses of Advances. - A public agency or Indian tribe shall use
    an advance under subsection (a) to aid in financing the cost of
    feasibility studies, engineering and architectural surveys,
    designs, plans, working drawings, specifications, or other action
    preliminary to and in preparation for the construction of public
    works, and for construction in connection with the development of a
    medical center, a general plan for the development of the center.
      (c) No Future Commitment. - An advance under subsection (a) does
    not commit the Congress to appropriate amounts to assist in
    financing the construction of any public works planned with the aid
    of that advance. Outstanding advances to public agencies and Indian
    tribes in a State shall not exceed 12.5 percent of the aggregate
    then authorized to be appropriated to the revolving fund
    established under section 3503 of this title.
      (d) Requirements for Advances. - An advance shall not be made
    under subsection (a) for an individual project (including a
    regional, metropolitan, or other areawide project) unless - 
        (1) the project is planned to be constructed within or over a
      reasonable period of time considering the nature of the project;
        (2) the project conforms to an overall state, local, or
      regional plan approved by a competent state, local, or regional
      authority; and
        (3) the public agency or Indian tribe formally contracts with
      the Federal Government to complete the plan preparation promptly
      and to repay part or all of the advance when due.

      (e) Regulations. - The Secretary may prescribe regulations to
    carry out this chapter.

      mechanic, in any workweek in which the laborer or mechanic is
      employed on that work, to work more than 40 hours in that
      workweek, except as provided in this chapter; and
        (2) when a violation of clause (1) occurs, the contractor and
      any subcontractor responsible for the violation are liable - 
          (A) to the affected employee for the employee's unpaid wages;
        and
          (B) to the Government, the District of Columbia, or a
        territory for liquidated damages as provided in the contract.

      (c) Liquidated Damages. - Liquidated damages under subsection
    (b)(2)(B) shall be computed for each individual employed as a
    laborer or mechanic in violation of this chapter and shall be equal

    payment of the overtime wages required by this chapter.
      (d) Amounts Withheld To Satisfy Liabilities. - Subject to section
    3703 of this title, the governmental agency for which the contract
    work is done or which is providing financial assistance for the

    CHAPTER 37 - CONTRACT WORK HOURS AND SAFETY STANDARDS

-HEAD-
    Sec. 3703. Report of violations and withholding of amounts for
      unpaid wages and liquidated damages

-STATUTE-
      (a) Reports of Inspectors. - An officer or individual designated
    as an inspector of the work to be performed under a contract
    described in section 3701 of this title, or to aid in the
    enforcement or fulfillment of the contract, on observation or after
    investigation immediately shall report to the proper officer of the
    Federal Government, a territory of the United States, or the
    District of Columbia all violations of this chapter occurring in
    the performance of the work, together with the name of each laborer
    or mechanic who was required or permitted to work in violation of
    this chapter and the day the violation occurred.
      (b) Withholding Amounts. - 
        (1) Determining amount. - The amount of unpaid wages and
      liquidated damages owing under this chapter shall be determined
      administratively.
        (2) Amount directed to be withheld. - The officer or individual
      whose duty it is to approve the payment of money by the
      Government, territory, or District of Columbia in connection with
      the performance of the contract work shall direct the amount of -
      
          (A) liquidated damages to be withheld for the use and benefit
        of the Government, territory, or District; and
          (B) unpaid wages to be withheld for the use and benefit of
        the laborers and mechanics who were not compensated as required
        under this chapter.

        (3) Payment. - The Comptroller General shall pay the amount
      administratively determined to be due directly to the laborers
      and mechanics from amounts withheld on account of underpayments
      of wages if the amount withheld is adequate. If the amount
      withheld is not adequate, the Comptroller General shall pay an
      equitable proportion of the amount due.

      (c) Right of Action and Intervention Against Contractors and
    Sureties. - If the accrued payments withheld under the terms of the
    contract are insufficient to reimburse all the laborers and
    mechanics who have not been paid the wages required under this
    chapter, the laborers and mechanics, in the case of a department or
    agency of the Government, have the same right of action and
    intervention against the contractor and the contractor's sureties
    as is conferred by law on persons furnishing labor or materials. In
    those proceedings it is not a defense that the laborers and
    mechanics accepted or agreed to accept less than the required rate
    of wages or voluntarily made refunds.
      (d) Review Process. - 
        (1) Time limit for appeal. - Within 60 days after an amount is
      withheld as liquidated damages, any contractor or subcontractor
      aggrieved by the withholding may appeal to the head of the agency
      of the Government or territory for which the contract work is
      done or which is providing financial assistance for the work, or
      to the Mayor of the District of Columbia in the case of
      liquidated damages withheld for the use and benefit of the
      District.
        (2) Review by agency head or mayor. - The agency head or Mayor
      may review the administrative determination of liquidated
      damages. The agency head or Mayor may issue a final order
      affirming the determination or may recommend to the Secretary of
      Labor that an appropriate adjustment in liquidated damages be
      made, or that the contractor or subcontractor be relieved of
      liability for the liquidated damages, if it is found that the
      amount is incorrect or that the contractor or subcontractor
      violated this chapter inadvertently, notwithstanding the exercise
      of due care by the contractor or subcontractor and the agents of
      the contractor or subcontractor.
        (3) Review by secretary. - The Secretary shall review all
      pertinent facts in the matter and may conduct any investigation
      the Secretary considers necessary in order to affirm or reject
      the recommendation. The decision of the Secretary is final.
        (4) Judicial action. - A contractor or subcontractor aggrieved
      by a final order for the withholding of liquidated damages may
      file a claim in the United States Court of Federal Claims within
      60 days after the final order. A final order of the agency head,
      Mayor, or Secretary is conclusive with respect to findings of
      fact if supported by substantial evidence.

      (e) Applicability of Other Laws. - 
        (1) Reorganization plan. - Reorganization Plan Numbered 14 of
      1950 (eff. May 24, 1950, 64 Stat. 1267) applies to this chapter.
        (2) Section 3145. - Section 3145 of this title applies to
      contractors and subcontractors referred to in section 3145 who
      are engaged in the performance of contracts subject to this
      chapter.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 3704. Health and safety standards in building trades and
      construction industry

-STATUTE-
      (a) Condition of Contracts. - 
        (1) In general. - Each contract in an amount greater than
      $100,000 that is entered into under legislation subject to
      Reorganization Plan Numbered 14 of 1950 (eff. May 24, 1950, 64
      Stat. 1267) and is for construction, alteration, and repair,
      including painting and decorating, must provide that no
      contractor or subcontractor contracting for any part of the
      contract work shall require any laborer or mechanic employed in
      the performance of the contract to work in surroundings or under
      working conditions that are unsanitary, hazardous, or dangerous
      to health or safety, as established under construction safety and
      health standards the Secretary of Labor prescribes by regulation
      based on proceedings pursuant to section 553 of title 5, provided
      that the proceedings include a hearing similar in nature to that
      authorized by section 553 of title 5.
        (2) Consultation. - In formulating standards under this
      section, the Secretary shall consult with the Advisory Committee
      created by subsection (d).

      (b) Compliance. - 
        (1) Actions to gain compliance. - The Secretary may make
      inspections, hold hearings, issue orders, and make decisions
      based on findings of fact as the Secretary considers necessary to
      gain compliance with this section and any health and safety
      standard the Secretary prescribes under subsection (a). For those
      purposes the Secretary and the United States district courts have
      the authority and jurisdiction provided by sections 4 and 5 of
      the Walsh-Healey Act (41 U.S.C. 38, 39).
        (2) Remedy when noncompliance found. - When the Secretary,
      after an opportunity for an adjudicatory hearing by the
      Secretary, establishes noncompliance under this section of any
      condition of a contract described in - 
          (A) section 3701(b)(1)(B)(i) or (ii) of this title, the
        governmental agency for which the contract work is done may
        cancel the contract and make other contracts for the completion
        of the contract work, charging any additional cost to the
        original contractor; or
          (B) section 3701(b)(1)(B)(iii) of this title, the
        governmental agency which is providing the financial guarantee,
        assistance, or insurance for the contract work may withhold the
        guarantee, assistance, or insurance attributable to the
        performance of the contract.

        (3) Nonapplicability. - Section 3703 of this title does not
      apply to the enforcement of this section.

      (c) Repeated Violations. - 
        (1) Transmittal of names of repeat violators to comptroller
      general. - When the Secretary, after an opportunity for an agency
      hearing, decides on the record that, by repeated willful or
      grossly negligent violations of this chapter, a contractor or
      subcontractor has demonstrated that subsection (b) is not
      effective to protect the safety and health of the employees of
      the contractor or subcontractor, the Secretary shall make a
      finding to that effect and, not sooner than 30 days after giving
      notice of the finding to all interested persons, shall transmit
      the name of the contractor or subcontractor to the Comptroller
      General.
        (2) Ban on awarding contracts. - The Comptroller General shall
      distribute each name transmitted under paragraph (1) to all
      agencies of the Federal Government. Unless the Secretary
      otherwise recommends, the contractor, subcontractor, or any
      person in which the contractor or subcontractor has a substantial
      interest may not be awarded a contract subject to this section
      until three years have elapsed from the date the name is
      transmitted to the Comptroller General. The Secretary shall
      terminate the ban if, before the end of the three-year period,
      the Secretary, after affording interested persons due notice and
      an opportunity for a hearing, is satisfied that a contractor or
      subcontractor whose name was transmitted to the Comptroller
      General will comply responsibly with the requirements of this
      section. The Comptroller General shall inform all Government
      agencies after being informed of the Secretary's action.
        (3) Judicial review. - A person aggrieved by the Secretary's
      action under this subsection or subsection (b) may file with the
      appropriate United States court of appeals a petition for review
      of the Secretary's action within 60 days after receiving notice
      of the Secretary's action. The clerk of the court immediately
      shall send a copy of the petition to the Secretary. The Secretary
      then shall file with the court the record on which the action is
      based. The findings of fact by the Secretary, if supported by
      substantial evidence, are final. The court may enter a decree
      enforcing, modifying, modifying and enforcing, or setting aside
      any part of, the order of the Secretary or the appropriate
      Government agency. The judgment of the court may be reviewed by
      the Supreme Court as provided in section 1254 of title 28.

      (d) Advisory Committee on Construction Safety and Health. - 
        (1) Establishment. - There is an Advisory Committee on
      Construction Safety and Health in the Department of Labor.
        (2) Composition. - The Committee is composed of nine members
      appointed by the Secretary, without regard to chapter 33 of title
      5, as follows:
          (A) Three members shall be individuals representative of
        contractors to whom this section applies.
          (B) Three members shall be individuals representative of
        employees primarily in the building trades and construction
        industry engaged in carrying out contracts to which this
        section applies.
          (C) Three members shall be public representatives who shall
        be selected on the basis of their professional and technical
        competence and experience in the construction health and safety
        field.

        (3) Chairman. - The Secretary shall appoint one member as
      Chairman.
        (4) Duties. - The Committee shall advise the Secretary - 
          (A) in formulating construction safety and health standards
        and other regulations; and
          (B) on policy matters arising in carrying out this section.

        (5) Experts and consultants. - The Secretary may appoint
      special advisory and technical experts or consultants as may be
      necessary to carry out the functions of the Committee.
        (6) Compensation and expenses. - Committee members are entitled
      to receive compensation at rates the Secretary fixes, but not
      more than $100 a day, including traveltime, when performing
      Committee business, and expenses under section 5703 of title 5.

      In subsection (b), the text of 40:333(c) is omitted as
    unnecessary because the district courts have jurisdiction on all

    the words "guarantee" and "insurance" are added for consistency in

    title.
      In subsection (c)(2), the words "The Secretary shall end the ban"
    are substituted for "he [sic] shall terminate the application of
    the preceding sentence to such contractor or subcontractor (and to

    substantial interest)" for clarity and to eliminate unnecessary
    words. The word "thereafter" is omitted as unnecessary.
      In subsection (c)(3), the words "as provided in section 2112 of

    omitted as unnecessary.
      In subsection (d)(2), before clause (A), the words "chapter 33 of
    title 5" are substituted for "the civil service laws" because of
    section 7(b) of the Act of September 6, 1966 (Public Law 89-554, 80
    Stat. 631), the first section of which enacted Title 5, United
    States Code.
      In subsection (d)(6), the words "expenses under section 5703 of
    title 5" are substituted for 40:333(e)(3)(words after semicolon) to

      In subsection (a)(3), the words "section 841(d) of title 18" are
    substituted for "section 121(1) of title 50" because of the
    enactment of 18:ch. 39 and the repeal of the provisions classified
    to 50:121(1) by sections 1102 and 1106(a) of the Organized Crime
    Control Act of 1970 (Public Law 91-452, 84 Stat. 952, 960). The
    plural form "explosives" is used because that is the term defined
    in 18:841(d).
      In subsection (a)(4), the words "section 921(3) of title 18" are
    substituted for "section 901(3) of title 15" because of the
    enactment of 18:ch. 44 and the repeal of the provisions classified
    to 15:901(3) by sections 902 and 906 of the Omnibus Crime Control
    and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (Public Law 90-351, 82 Stat. 226,
    234).
      In subsection (e)(1)(A), the plural "explosives" is used for
    consistency with the term defined in subsection (a)(3). In
    subclause (iii), the words "by any means" are omitted as
    unnecessary.
      In subsection (e)(2)(A), the words "unless authorized to do so
    pursuant to rules adopted, or authorization given, by that House"
    are substituted for "unless such person is authorized, pursuant to
    rules adopted by that House or pursuant to authorization given by
    that House, to enter or to remain upon such floor or in such
    cloakroom, lobby, or room" to eliminate unnecessary words.

      In subsection (a), the definition of "United States" is omitted
    as unnecessary because, within 40:13f-13p, the words "United
    States" are used in the geographical sense only in 40:13n(a)(2) and
    (c) and the restatement of those provisions, in section 6121 of the
    revised title, substitutes the words "any State" for "any part of
    the United States".
      Before clause (1), the words "In this chapter, the following
    definitions apply" are substituted for "As used in sections 13f to
    13p of this title, the term - " for clarity. The terms are not used
    in 40:13a-13e, so using them chapter-wide does not expand their
    scope.
      In clause (2), the words "the Virgin Islands, Guam, the Northern
    Mariana Islands, the Federal States of Micronesia, the Marshall
    Islands, Palau, and any territory or possession of the United
    States" are substituted for "any territory or possession of the
    United States" to clarify that the provisions of the source law
    apply to those jurisdictions.
      In subsection (b), before clause (1), the words "In addition to
    the property referred to in the preceding sentence, for the
    purposes of sections 13f to 13p of this title, the Supreme Court
    grounds" are omitted as unnecessary.

      Washington metropolitan region

-STATUTE-
      Because the District of Columbia is the seat of the Federal
    Government and has become the urban center of a rapidly expanding
    Washington metropolitan region, the necessity for the continued and
    effective performance of the functions of the Government in the
    District of Columbia, the general welfare of the District of
    Columbia, the health and living standards of the people residing or
    working in the District of Columbia, and the conduct of industry,
    trade, and commerce in the District of Columbia require that to the
    fullest extent possible the development of the District of Columbia
    and the management of its public affairs, and the activities of the
    departments, agencies, and instrumentalities of the Government
    which may be carried out in, or in relation to, the other areas of
    the Washington metropolitan region, shall be coordinated with the
    development of those other areas and with the management of their
    public affairs so that, with the cooperation and assistance of
    those other areas, all of the areas in the Washington metropolitan
    area shall be developed and their public affairs shall be managed
    so as to contribute effectively toward the solution of the
    community development problems of the Washington metropolitan
    region on a unified metropolitan basis.

    SUBCHAPTER I - GENERAL

-HEAD-
    Sec. 8701. Findings and purposes

-STATUTE-
      (a) Findings. - Congress finds that - 
        (1) the location of the seat of government in the District of
      Columbia has brought about the development of a metropolitan
      region extending well into adjoining territory in Maryland and
      Virginia;
        (2) effective comprehensive planning is necessary on a regional
      basis and of continuing importance to the federal establishment;
        (3) the distribution of federal installations throughout the
      region has been and will continue to be a major influence in
      determining the extent and character of development;
        (4) there is needed a central planning agency for the National
      Capital region to coordinate certain developmental activities of
      the many different agencies of the Federal and District of
      Columbia Governments so that those activities may conform with
      general objectives;
        (5) there is an increasing mutuality of interest and
      responsibility between the various levels of government that
      calls for coordinate and unified policies in planning both
      federal and local development in the interest of order and
      economy;
        (6) there are developmental problems of an interstate
      character, the planning of which requires collaboration between
      federal, state, and local governments in the interest of equity
      and constructive action; and
        (7) the instrumentalities and procedures provided in this
      chapter will aid in providing Congress with information and
      advice requisite to legislation.

      (b) Purposes. - 
        (1) In general. - The purposes of this chapter (except sections
      8733-8736) are - 
          (A) to secure comprehensive planning for the physical
        development of the National Capital and its environs;
          (B) to provide for the participation of the appropriate
        planning agencies of the environs in the planning; and
          (C) to establish the agency and procedures requisite to the
        administration of the functions of the Federal and District
        Governments related to the planning.

        (2) Objective. - The general objective of this chapter (except
      sections 8733-8736) is to enable appropriate agencies to plan for
      the development of the federal establishment at the seat of
      government in a manner - 
          (A) consistent with the nature and function of the National
        Capital and with due regard for the rights and prerogatives of
        the adjoining States and local governments to exercise control
        appropriate to their functions; and
          (B) which will, in accordance with present and future needs,
        best promote public health, safety, morals, order, convenience,
        prosperity, and the general welfare, as well as efficiency and
        economy in the process of development.

    --------------------------------------------------------------------

      In this chapter, the word "Mayor" is substituted for
    "Commissioners" [meaning the Board of Commissioners of the District
    of Columbia] [subsequently changed to "Commissioner" [meaning the
    Commissioner of the District of Columbia] because of section 401 of
    Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (eff. Nov. 3, 1967, 81 Stat.
    951)] because of section 421 of the District of Columbia Home Rule
    Act (Public Law 93-198, 87 Stat. 789). The words "Council of the
    District of Columbia" are substituted for "Board of Commissioners
    of the District of Columbia" [subsequently changed to "District of
    Columbia Council" because of section 402(21), (28), (32), and (199)
    of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (eff. Nov. 3, 1967, 81 Stat.
    952, 953, 963)] because of sections 401 and 404(a) of the Act (87
    Stat. 785, 787).
      In subsection (b)(1)(A), the words "the Chairman of the Committee
    on Governmental Affairs of the Senate, and the Chairman of the
    Committee on Government Reform of the House of Representatives" are
    substituted for "and the chairman of the Committees of the District
    of Columbia of the Senate and the House of Representatives" in
    section 2(b)(1) of the Act of June 24, 1924 (ch. 270), because of
    Rule XXV of the Standing Rules of the Senate, as amended by Senate
    Resolution 4 (popularly cited as the "Committee System
    Reorganization Amendments of 1977"), approved February 4, 1977,
    section 1(b)(1) of the Act of June 3, 1995 (Public Law 104-14, 2:21
    note prec.), and Rule X(1)(h) of House Resolution No. 5 (105th
    Congress, January 6, 1999).
      In subsection (b)(2), the words "bona fide" are omitted as
    unnecessary.
      In subsection (b)(3), the words "except that of the members first
    appointed, the President shall designate one to serve two years and
    one to serve four years" and "The members first appointed under
    this section shall assume their office on January 2, 1975" are
    omitted as obsolete.
      In subsection (b)(4), the words "are entitled to $100 a day when
    performing duties" are substituted for "shall each receive
    compensation at the rate of $100 for each day such member is
    engaged in the actual performance of duties" to eliminate
    unnecessary words.
      In subsection (d), the words "chapters 33 and 51, and subchapter
    III of chapter 53" are substituted for "the civil service and
    classification laws" because of section 7(b) of the Act of
    September 6, 1966 (Public Law 89-554, 80 Stat. 631), the first
    section of which enacted Title 5, United States Code.
      In subsection (e), before clause (1), the words "As hereinafter
    more specifically described in sections 71c to 71g of this title"
    are omitted as unnecessary. The text of 40:71a(e)(3) is omitted as
    obsolete because the National Capital Regional Planning Council was
    abolished by section 1 of Reorganization Plan No. 5 of 1966 (eff.
    Sept. 8, 1966, 40:71b note). In clause (2), the words "in such
    capacity" are omitted as unnecessary.
      Subsection (f) is substituted for 40:71h to eliminate obsolete
    language.
      In subsection (g), the words "Said Commission shall report to
    Congress annually on the first Monday of March the lands acquired
    during the preceding fiscal year, the method of acquisition, and
    the cost of each tract" are omitted pursuant to section 3003 of the
    Federal Reports Elimination and Sunset Act of 1995 (31 U.S.C. 1113
    note). See, also, page 180 of House Document No. 103-7. The words
    "Office of Management and Budget" are substituted for "Bureau of
    the Budget" in section 13 of the Act of June 6, 1924, because the
    Bureau of the Budget was redesignated the Office of Management and
    Budget by section 102 of Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1970 (eff.
    July 1, 1970, 84 Stat. 2085). Section 102 of Reorganization Plan
    No. 2 of 1970 was repealed by section 5(b) of the Act of September
    13, 1982 (Public Law 97-258, 96 Stat. 1085), the first section of
    which enacted Title 31, United States Code, but the successor
    provision, 31:501, continued the designation as Office of
    Management and Budget.
      In subsection (h), the words "beginning in fiscal year 1998 and
    thereafter" are omitted as obsolete.

    SUBCHAPTER III - PLANNING PROCESS

-HEAD-
    Sec. 8721. Comprehensive plan for the National Capital

-STATUTE-
      (a) Preparation and Adoption by Commission. - The National
    Capital Planning Commission shall prepare and adopt a
    comprehensive, consistent, and coordinated plan for the National
    Capital. The plan shall include the Commission's recommendations or
    proposals for federal developments or projects in the environs and
    District elements of the comprehensive plan, or amendments to the
    elements, adopted by the Council of the District of Columbia and
    with respect to which the Commission has not determined a negative
    impact exists. Those elements or amendments shall be incorporated
    into the comprehensive plan without change. The Commission may
    include in its plan any part of a plan adopted by any planning
    agency in the environs and may make recommendations of collateral
    interest to the agencies. The Commission may adopt any part of an
    element. The Commission shall review and may amend or extend the
    plan so that its recommendations may be kept up to date.
      (b) Review by District of Columbia. - The Mayor of the District
    of Columbia shall submit each District element of the comprehensive
    plan, and any amendment, to the Council for revision or
    modification, and adoption, by act, following public hearings.
    Following adoption and prior to implementation, the Council shall
    submit each element or amendment to the Commission for review and
    comment with regard to the impact of the element or amendment on
    the interests or functions of the federal establishment in the
    National Capital.
      (c) Commission Response to Council Action. - 
        (1) Period of review. - Within 60 days after receiving an
      element or amendment from the Council, the Commission shall
      certify to the Council whether the element or amendment has a
      negative impact on the interests or functions of the federal
      establishment in the National Capital.
        (2) No negative impact. - If the Commission takes no action in
      the 60-day period, the element or amendment is deemed to have no
      negative impact and shall be incorporated into the comprehensive
      plan for the National Capital and implemented.
        (3) Negative impact. - 
          (A) Certification to council. - If the Commission finds a
        negative impact, it shall certify its findings and
        recommendations to the Council.
          (B) Response of council. - On receipt of the Commission's
        findings and recommendations, the Council may - 
            (i) accept the findings and recommendations and modify the
          element or amendment accordingly; or
            (ii) reject the findings and recommendations and resubmit a
          modified form of the element or amendment to the Commission
          for reconsideration.

          (C) Findings and recommendations accepted. - If the Council
        accepts the findings and recommendations and modifies the
        element or amendment, the Council shall submit the element or
        amendment to the Commission for the Commission to determine
        whether the modification has been made in accordance with the
        Commission's findings and recommendations. If the Commission
        does not act on the modified element or amendment within 30
        days after receiving it, the element or amendment is deemed to
        have been modified in accordance with the findings and
        recommendations and shall be incorporated into the
        comprehensive plan for the National Capital and implemented. If
        within the 30-day period the Commission again determines the
        element or amendment has a negative impact on the functions or
        interests of the federal establishment in the National Capital,
        the element or amendment shall not be implemented.
          (D) Findings and recommendations rejected. - If the Council
        rejects the findings and recommendations and resubmits a
        modified element or amendment, the Commission, within 60 days
        after receiving it, shall decide whether the modified element
        or amendment has a negative impact on the interests or
        functions of the federal establishment within the National
        Capital. If the Commission does not act within the 60-day
        period, the modified element or amendment is deemed to have no
        negative impact and shall be incorporated into the
        comprehensive plan and implemented. If the Commission finds a
        negative impact, it shall certify its findings (in sufficient
        detail that the Council can understand the basis of the
        objection of the Commission) and recommendations to the Council
        and the element or amendment shall not be implemented.

      (d) Resubmission Deemed New Element or Amendment. - Any element
    or amendment which the Commission has determined has a negative
    impact on the federal establishment in the National Capital which
    is submitted again in a modified form not less than one year from
    the day it was last rejected by the Commission is deemed to be a
    new element or amendment for purposes of the review procedure
    specified in this section.
      (e) Review, Hearings, and Citizen Advisory Councils. - 
        (1) Review. - Before the comprehensive plan, any element of the
      plan, or any revision is adopted, the Commission shall present
      the plan, element, or revision to the appropriate federal or
      District of Columbia authorities for comment and recommendations.
      The Commission may present the proposed revisions annually in a
      consolidated form. Recommendations by federal and District of
      Columbia authorities are not binding on the Commission, but the
      Commission shall give careful consideration to any views and
      recommendations submitted prior to final adoption.
        (2) Hearings and citizen advisory councils. - The Commission - 
          (A) may provide periodic opportunity for review and comments
        by nongovernmental agencies or groups through public hearings,
        meetings, or conferences, exhibitions, and publication of its
        plans; and
          (B) in consultation with the Council, may encourage the
        formation of citizen advisory councils.

      (f) Extension of Time Limitations. - On request of the
    Commission, the Council may grant an extension of any time
    limitation contained in this section.
      (g) Publishing Comprehensive Plan. - As appropriate, the
    Commission and the Mayor jointly shall publish a comprehensive plan
    for the National Capital, consisting of the elements of the
    comprehensive plan for the federal activities in the National
    Capital developed by the Commission and the District elements
    developed by the Mayor and the Council in accordance with this
    section.
      (h) Procedures for Consultation. - 
        (1) Commission and mayor. - The Commission and the Mayor
      jointly shall establish procedures for appropriate meaningful
      continuing consultation throughout the planning process for the
      National Capital.
        (2) Government agencies. - In order that the National Capital
      may be developed in accordance with the comprehensive plan, the
      Commission, with the consent of each agency concerned as to its
      representation, may establish advisory and coordinating
      committees composed of representatives of agencies of the Federal
      and District of Columbia Governments as may be necessary or
      helpful to obtain the maximum amount of cooperation and
      correlation of effort among the various agencies. As it considers
      appropriate, the Commission may invite representatives of the
      planning and developmental agencies of the environs to
      participate in the work of the committees.

    Sec. 8722. Proposed federal and district developments and projects

-STATUTE-
      (a) Agencies To Use Commission as Central Planning Agency. -
    Agencies of the Federal Government responsible for public
    developments and projects shall cooperate and correlate their
    efforts by using the National Capital Planning Commission as the
    central planning agency for federal activities in the National
    Capital region. To aid the Commission in carrying out this
    function, federal and District of Columbia governmental agencies on
    request of the Commission shall furnish plans, data, and records
    the Commission requires. The Commission on request shall furnish
    related plans, data, and records to federal and District of
    Columbia governmental agencies.
      (b) Consultation Between Agencies and Commission. - 
        (1) Before construction plans prepared. - To ensure the
      comprehensive planning and orderly development of the National
      Capital, a federal or District of Columbia agency, before
      preparing construction plans the agency originates for proposed
      developments and projects or before making a commitment to
      acquire land, to be paid for at least in part from federal or
      District amounts, shall advise and consult with the Commission as
      the agency prepares plans and programs in preliminary and
      successive stages that affect the plan and development of the
      National Capital. After receiving the plans, maps, and data, the
      Commission promptly shall make a preliminary report and
      recommendations to the agency. If the agency, after considering
      the report and recommendations of the Commission, does not agree,
      it shall advise the Commission and provide the reasons why it
      does not agree. The Commission then shall submit a final report.
      After consultation and suitable consideration of the views of the
      Commission, the agency may proceed to take action in accordance
      with its legal responsibilities and authority.
        (2) Exceptions. - 
          (A) In general. - Paragraph (1) does not apply to projects
        within the Capitol grounds or to structures erected by the
        Department of Defense during wartime or national emergency
        within existing military, naval, or Air Force reservations,
        except that the appropriate defense agency shall consult with
        the Commission as to any developments which materially affect
        traffic or require coordinated planning of the surrounding
        area.
          (B) Advance decisions of commission. - The Commission shall
        determine in advance the type or kinds of plans, developments,
        projects, improvements, or acquisitions which do not need to be
        submitted for review by the Commission as to conformity with
        its plans.

      (c) Additional Procedure for Developments and Projects Within
    Environs. - 
        (1) Submission to commission. - Within the environs, general
      plans showing the location, character, and extent of, and
      intensity of use for, proposed federal and District developments
      and projects involving the acquisition of land shall be submitted
      to the Commission for report and recommendations before a final
      commitment to the acquisition is made, unless the matter
      specifically has been approved by law.
        (2) Commission action. - Before acting on any general plan, the
      Commission shall advise and consult with the appropriate planning
      agency having jurisdiction over the affected part of the
      environs. When the Commission decides that proposed developments
      or projects submitted to the Commission under subsection (b)
      involve a major change in the character or intensity of an
      existing use in the environs, the Commission shall advise and
      consult with the planning agency. The report and recommendations
      shall be submitted within 60 days and shall be accompanied by any
      reports or recommendations of the planning agency.
        (3) Working with state or local authority or agency. - In
      carrying out its planning functions with respect to federal
      developments or projects in the environs, the Commission may work
      with, and make agreements with, any state or local authority or
      planning agency as the Commission considers necessary to have a
      plan or proposal adopted and carried out.

      (d) Approval of Federal Public Buildings. - The provisions of the
    Act of June 20, 1938 (ch. 534, 52 Stat. 797) shall not apply to
    federal public buildings. In order to ensure the orderly
    development of the National Capital, the location, height, bulk,
    number of stories, and size of federal public buildings in the
    District of Columbia and the provision for open space in and around
    federal public buildings in the District of Columbia are subject to
    the approval of the Commission.
      (e) Approval of District Government Buildings in Central Area. -
    Subsection (d) is extended to include public buildings erected by
    any agency of the Government of the District of Columbia in the
    central area of the District (as defined by concurrent action of
    the Commission and the Council of the District of Columbia), except
    that the Commission shall transmit its approval or disapproval
    within 30 days after the day the proposal was submitted to the
    Commission.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 8732. Acquiring land subject to limited rights reserved to
      grantor and limited permanent rights in land adjoining park
      property

-STATUTE-
      (a) In General. - The National Capital Planning Commission in
    accordance with this chapter may acquire, for and on behalf of the
    Federal Government, by gift, devise, purchase, or condemnation - 
        (1) fee title to land subject to limited rights, but not for
      business purposes, reserved to the grantor; and
        (2) permanent rights in land adjoining park property sufficient
      to prevent the use of the land in certain specified ways which
      would essentially impair the value of the park property for its
      purposes.

      (b) Prerequisites to Acquisition. - 
        (1) Fee title to land subject to limited rights. - The
      reservation of rights to the grantor shall not continue beyond
      the life of the grantor of the fee. The Commission must decide
      that the permanent public park purposes for which control over
      the land is needed are not essentially impaired by the reserved
      rights and that there is a substantial saving in cost by
      acquiring the land subject to the limited rights as compared with
      the cost of acquiring unencumbered title to the land.
        (2) Permanent rights in land adjoining park property. - The
      Commission must decide that the protection and maintenance of the
      essential public values of the park can be secured more
      economically by acquiring the permanent rights than by acquiring
      the land.

      (c) Presidential Approval Required. - All contracts to acquire
    land or rights under this section are subject to the approval of
    the President.

      In subsection (a), the text of 40:1002(a) and (b) is omitted as
    unnecessary because the complete names of the Secretary of the
    Interior and the Administrator of General Services are used the
    first time the terms appear in a section.
      In subsection (a)(3), the words "notwithstanding any other
    provision of law" are omitted as unnecessary. The words
    "Administrator of General Services" are substituted for "General
    Services Administration" because of section 101(b) of the Federal
    Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (ch. 288, 63 Stat.
    379), which is restated as section 302(a) of the revised title.
      In subsection (b), the words "January 3, 1985" are substituted
    for "the commencement of the Ninety-ninth Congress" for clarity.

    works in the District of Columbia and its environs, the Committee
    on Resources of the House of Representatives and the Committee on
    Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate shall solicit the views
    of the National Capital Memorial Advisory Commission.
      (e) Expiration of Legislative Authority. - Any legislative
    authority for a commemorative work shall expire at the end of the
    seven-year period beginning on the date of the enactment of such
    authority, or at the end of the seven-year period beginning on the
    date of the enactment of legislative authority to locate the
    commemorative work within Area I, if such additional authority has
    been granted, unless - 
        (1) the Secretary of the Interior or the Administrator of
      General Services (as appropriate) has issued a construction
      permit for the commemorative work during that period; or
        (2) the Secretary or the Administrator (as appropriate), in

      Commission, has made a determination that - 
          (A) final design approvals have been obtained from the
        National Capital Planning Commission and the Commission of Fine
        Arts; and
          (B) 75 percent of the amount estimated to be required to
        complete the commemorative work has been raised.

    If these two conditions have been met, the Secretary or the
    Administrator (as appropriate) may extend the seven-year
    legislative authority for a period not to exceed three additional
    years. Upon expiration of the legislative authority, any previous
    site and design approvals shall also expire.

    Administrator of General Services, as appropriate, shall determine
    that - 
        (1) the site and design have been approved by the Secretary or
      Administrator, the National Capital Planning Commission and the
      Commission of Fine Arts;
        (2) knowledgeable individuals qualified in the field of
      preservation and maintenance have been consulted to determine
      structural soundness and durability of the commemorative work and
      to ensure that the commemorative work meets high professional
      standards;
        (3) the sponsor authorized to construct the commemorative work
      has submitted contract documents for construction of the
      commemorative work to the Secretary or Administrator; and
        (4) the sponsor authorized to construct the commemorative work
      has available sufficient amounts to complete construction of the
      project.

      (b) Donation for Perpetual Maintenance and Preservation. - 
        (1) In addition to the criteria described above in subsection
      (a), no construction permit shall be issued unless the sponsor
      authorized to construct the commemorative work has donated an
      amount equal to 10 percent of the total estimated cost of
      construction to offset the costs of perpetual maintenance and
      preservation of the commemorative work. All such amounts shall be
      available for those purposes pursuant to the provisions of this
      subsection. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply in
      instances when the commemorative work is constructed by a
      Department or agency of the Federal Government and less than 50
      percent of the funding for such work is provided by private
      sources.
        (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, money on

      Commemorative Works Clarification and Revision Act of 2003
      provided by a sponsor for maintenance pursuant to this subsection
      shall be credited to a separate account in the Treasury.
        (3) Money provided by a sponsor pursuant to the provisions of
      this subsection after the date of enactment of the Commemorative
      Works Clarification and Revision Act of 2003 shall be credited to
      a separate account with the National Park Foundation.
        (4) Upon request of the Secretary or Administrator (as
      appropriate), the Secretary of the Treasury or the National Park
      Foundation shall make all or a portion of such moneys available
      to the Secretary or the Administrator (as appropriate) for the
      maintenance of a commemorative work. Under no circumstances may
      the Secretary or Administrator request funds from a separate
      account exceeding the total money in the account established
      under paragraph (2) or (3). The Secretary and the Administrator
      shall maintain an inventory of funds available for such purposes.
      Funds provided under this paragraph shall be available without
      further appropriation and shall remain available until expended.

      (c) Suspension for Misrepresentation in Fundraising. - The
    Secretary of the Interior or Administrator may suspend any activity
    under this chapter that relates to the establishment of a

    that fundraising efforts relating to the work have misrepresented
    an affiliation with the work or the Federal Government.
      (d) Annual Report. - The person authorized to construct a
    commemorative work under this chapter must submit to the Secretary
    of the Interior or Administrator an annual report of operations,

    designated on land the Secretary administers in the District of
    Columbia.
      (b) Plan. - A designation may be made under subsection (a) only
    if, at least 120 days before the designation, the Secretary, in
    consultation with the Commission, prepares and submits to Congress
    a plan for the site. The plan shall include specifications for the
    location, construction, and administration of the site and criteria
    for displaying commemorative works at the site.
      (c) Risk and Agreement To Indemnify. - A commemorative work
    displayed at the site shall be installed, maintained, and removed
    at the sole expense and risk of the person authorized to display
    the work. The person shall agree to indemnify the United States for
    any liability arising from the display of the commemorative work
    under this section.

               EX. ORD. NO. 13103. COMPUTER SOFTWARE PIRACY           
      Ex. Ord. No. 13103, Sept. 30, 1998, 63 F.R. 53273, provided:
      The United States Government is the world's largest purchaser of
    computer-related services and equipment, purchasing more than $20
    billion annually. At a time when a critical component in
    discussions with our international trading partners concerns their
    efforts to combat piracy of computer software and other
    intellectual property, it is incumbent on the United States to
    ensure that its own practices as a purchaser and user of computer
    software are beyond reproach. Accordingly, by the authority vested
    in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United
    States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:
      Section 1. Policy. It shall be the policy of the United States
    Government that each executive agency shall work diligently to
    prevent and combat computer software piracy in order to give effect
    to copyrights associated with computer software by observing the
    relevant provisions of international agreements in effect in the
    United States, including applicable provisions of the World Trade
    Organization Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual
    Property Rights, the Berne Convention for the Protection of
    Literary and Artistic Works, and relevant provisions of Federal
    law, including the Copyright Act.
      (a) Each agency shall adopt procedures to ensure that the agency
    does not acquire, reproduce, distribute, or transmit computer
    software in violation of applicable copyright laws.
      (b) Each agency shall establish procedures to ensure that the
    agency has present on its computers and uses only computer software
    not in violation of applicable copyright laws. These procedures may
    include:
      (1) preparing agency inventories of the software present on its
    computers;
      (2) determining what computer software the agency has the
    authorization to use; and
      (3) developing and maintaining adequate recordkeeping systems.
      (c) Contractors and recipients of Federal financial assistance,
    including recipients of grants and loan guarantee assistance,
    should have appropriate systems and controls in place to ensure
    that Federal funds are not used to acquire, operate, or maintain
    computer software in violation of applicable copyright laws. If
    agencies become aware that contractors or recipients are using
    Federal funds to acquire, operate, or maintain computer software in
    violation of copyright laws and determine that such actions of the
    contractors or recipients may affect the integrity of the agency's
    contracting and Federal financial assistance processes, agencies
    shall take such measures, including the use of certifications or
    written assurances, as the agency head deems appropriate and
    consistent with the requirements of law.
      (d) Executive agencies shall cooperate fully in implementing this
    order and shall share information as appropriate that may be useful
    in combating the use of computer software in violation of
    applicable copyright laws.
      Sec. 2. Responsibilities of Agency Heads. In connection with the
    acquisition and use of computer software, the head of each
    executive agency shall:
      (a) ensure agency compliance with copyright laws protecting
    computer software and with the provisions of this order to ensure
    that only authorized computer software is acquired for and used on
    the agency's computers;
      (b) utilize performance measures as recommended by the Chief
    Information Officers Council pursuant to section 3 of this order to
    assess the agency's compliance with this order;
      (c) educate appropriate agency personnel regarding copyrights
    protecting computer software and the policies and procedures
    adopted by the agency to honor them; and
      (d) ensure that the policies, procedures, and practices of the
    agency related to copyrights protecting computer software are
    adequate and fully implement the policies set forth in this order.
      Sec. 3. Chief Information Officers Council. The Chief Information
    Officers Council ("Council") established by section 3 of Executive
    Order No. 13011 of July 16, 1996 [set out above], shall be the
    principal interagency forum to improve executive agency practices
    regarding the acquisition and use of computer software, and
    monitoring and combating the use of unauthorized computer software.
    The Council shall provide advice and make recommendations to
    executive agencies and to the Office of Management and Budget
    regarding appropriate government-wide measures to carry out this
    order. The Council shall issue its initial recommendations within 6
    months of the date of this order.
      Sec. 4. Office of Management and Budget. The Director of the
    Office of Management and Budget, in carrying out responsibilities
    under the Clinger-Cohen Act [probably means the Clinger-Cohen Act
    of 1996, div. D (Secs. 4001-4402) and div. E (Secs. 5001-5703) of
    Pub. L. 104-106, see Tables for classification], shall utilize
    appropriate oversight mechanisms to foster agency compliance with
    the policies set forth in this order. In carrying out these
    responsibilities, the Director shall consider any recommendations
    made by the Council under section 3 of this order regarding
    practices and policies to be instituted on a government-wide basis
    to carry out this order.
      Sec. 5. Definition. "Executive agency" and "agency" have the
    meaning given to that term in section 4(1) of the Office of Federal
    Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 403(1)).
      Sec. 6. National Security. In the interest of national security,
    nothing in this order shall be construed to require the disclosure
    of intelligence sources or methods or to otherwise impair the
    authority of those agencies listed at 50 U.S.[C.] 401a(4) to carry
    out intelligence activities.
      Sec. 7. Law Enforcement Activities. Nothing in this order shall
    be construed to require the disclosure of law enforcement
    investigative sources or methods or to prohibit or otherwise impair
    any lawful investigative or protective activity undertaken for or
    by any officer, agent, or employee of the United States or any
    person acting pursuant to a contract or other agreement with such
    entities.
      Sec. 8. Scope. Nothing in this order shall be construed to limit
    or otherwise affect the interpretation, application, or operation
    of 28 U.S.C. 1498.
      Sec. 9. Judicial Review. This Executive order is intended only to
    improve the internal management of the executive branch and does
    not create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, at law
    or equity by a party against the United States, its agencies or
    instrumentalities, its officers or employees, or any other person.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 14101. Findings and purposes

-STATUTE-
      (a) 1965 Findings and Purpose. - 
        (1) Findings. - Congress finds and declares that the
      Appalachian region of the United States, while abundant in
      natural resources and rich in potential, lags behind the rest of
      the Nation in its economic growth and that its people have not
      shared properly in the Nation's prosperity. The region's uneven
      past development, with its historical reliance on a few basic
      industries and a marginal agriculture, has failed to provide the
      economic base that is a vital prerequisite for vigorous, self-
      sustaining growth. State and local governments and the people of
      the region understand their problems and have been working, and
      will continue to work, purposefully toward their solution.
      Congress recognizes the comprehensive report of the President's
      Appalachian Regional Commission documenting these findings and
      concludes that regionwide development is feasible, desirable, and
      urgently needed.
        (2) Purpose. - It is the purpose of this subtitle to assist the
      region in meeting its special problems, to promote its economic
      development, and to establish a framework for joint federal and
      state efforts toward providing the basic facilities essential to
      its growth and attacking its common problems and meeting its
      common needs on a coordinated and concerted regional basis. The
      public investments made in the region under this subtitle shall
      be concentrated in areas where there is a significant potential
      for future growth and where the expected return on public dollars
      invested will be the greatest. States will be responsible for
      recommending local and state projects within their borders that
      will receive assistance under this subtitle. As the region
      obtains the needed physical and transportation facilities and
      develops its human resources, Congress expects that the region
      will generate a diversified industry and that the region will
      then be able to support itself through the workings of a
      strengthened free enterprise economy.

      (b) 1975 Findings and Purpose. - 
        (1) Findings. - Congress further finds and declares that while
      substantial progress has been made toward achieving the purposes
      set out in subsection (a), especially with respect to the
      provision of essential public facilities, much remains to be
      accomplished, especially with respect to the provision of
      essential health, education, and other public services. Congress
      recognizes that changes and evolving national purposes in the
      decade since 1965 affect not only the Appalachian region but also
      its relationship to a nation that on December 31, 1975, is
      assigning higher priority to conservation and the quality of
      life, values long cherished within the region. Appalachia as of
      December 31, 1975, has the opportunity, in accommodating future
      growth and development, to demonstrate local leadership and
      coordinated planning so that housing, public services,
      transportation and other community facilities will be provided in
      a way congenial to the traditions and beauty of the region and
      compatible with conservation values and an enhanced quality of
      life for the people of the region, and consistent with that goal,
      the Appalachian region should be able to take advantage of eco-
      industrial development, which promotes both employment and
      economic growth and the preservation of natural resources.
      Congress recognizes also that fundamental changes are occurring
      in national energy requirements and production, which not only
      risk short-term dislocations but will undoubtedly result in major
      long-term effects in the region. It is essential that the
      opportunities for expanded energy production be used so as to
      maximize the social and economic benefits and minimize the social
      and environmental costs to the region and its people.
        (2) Purpose. - It is also the purpose of this subtitle to
      provide a framework for coordinating federal, state and local
      efforts toward - 
          (A) anticipating the effects of alternative energy policies
        and practices;
          (B) planning for accompanying growth and change so as to
        maximize the social and economic benefits and minimize the
        social and environmental costs; and
          (C) implementing programs and projects carried out in the
        region by federal, state, and local governmental agencies so as
        to better meet the special problems generated in the region by
        the Nation's energy needs and policies, including problems of
        transportation, housing, community facilities, and human
        services.

      (c) 1998 Findings and Purpose. - 
        (1) Findings. - Congress further finds and declares that while
      substantial progress has been made in fulfilling many of the

-HEAD-
    Sec. 14501. Appalachian development highway system

-STATUTE-
      (a) Purpose. - To provide a highway system which, in conjunction
    with the Interstate System and other Federal-aid highways in the
    Appalachian region, will open up an area with a developmental
    potential where commerce and communication have been inhibited by
    lack of adequate access, the Secretary of Transportation may assist
    in the construction of an Appalachian development highway system
    and local access roads serving the Appalachian region. Construction
    on the development highway system shall not be more than three
    thousand and ninety miles. There shall not be more than 1,400 miles
    of local access roads that serve specific recreational,
    residential, educational, commercial, industrial, or similar
    facilities or facilitate a school consolidation program.
      (b) Commission Designations. - 
        (1) What is to be designated. - The Appalachian Regional
      Commission shall transmit to the Secretary its designations of - 
          (A) the general corridor location and termini of the
        development highways;
          (B) local access roads to be constructed;
          (C) priorities for the construction of segments of the
        development highways; and
          (D) other criteria for the program authorized by this
        section.

        (2) State transportation department recommendation required. -
      Before a state member participates in or votes on designations,
      the member must obtain the recommendations of the state
      transportation department of the State which the member
      represents.

      (c) Addition to Federal-aid Primary System. - When completed,
    each development highway not already on the Federal-aid primary
    system shall be added to the system.
      (d) Use of Specific Materials and Products. - 
        (1) Indigenous materials and products. - In the construction of
      highways and roads authorized under this section, a State may
      give special preference to the use of materials and products
      indigenous to the Appalachian region.
        (2) Coal derivatives. - For research and development in the use
      of coal and coal products in highway construction and
      maintenance, the Secretary may require each participating State,
      to the maximum extent possible, to use coal derivatives in the
      construction of not more than 10 percent of the roads authorized
      under this subtitle.

      (e) Federal Share. - Federal assistance to any construction
    project under this section shall not be more than 80 percent of the
    cost of the project.
      (f) Construction Without Federal Amounts. - 
        (1) Payment of federal share. - When a participating State
      constructs a segment of a development highway without the aid of
      federal amounts and the construction is in accordance with all
      procedures and requirements applicable to the construction of
      segments of Appalachian development highways with those amounts,
      except for procedures and requirements that limit a State to the
      construction of projects for which federal amounts have
      previously been appropriated, the Secretary, on application by
      the State and with the approval of the Commission, may pay to the
      State the federal share, which shall not be more than 80 percent
      of the cost of the construction of the segment, from any amounts
      appropriated and allocated to the State to carry out this
      section.
        (2) No commitment or obligation. - This subsection does not
      commit or obligate the Federal Government to provide amounts for
      segments of development highways constructed under this
      subsection.

      (g) Application of Title 23. - 
        (1) Sections 106(a) and 118. - Sections 106(a) and 118 of title
      23 apply to the development highway system and the local access
      roads.
        (2) Construction and maintenance. - States are required to
      maintain each development highway and local access road as
      provided for Federal-aid highways in title 23. All other
      provisions of title 23 that are applicable to the construction
      and maintenance of Federal-aid primary and secondary highways and
      which the Secretary decides are not inconsistent with this
      subtitle shall apply to the system and roads, respectively.

      In subsection (c)(1)(A)(ii), the words "where the acquisition of
    such facilities is the most cost-effective means for providing
    increased health services" are omitted as unnecessary because of
    the more narrow requirement that the Commission find that but for
    the acquisition of the facility, the health services would not be
    otherwise provided in the area served by the facility.
      In subsection (f)(1), the words "After September 30, 1998" are
    omitted as obsolete.

    rehabilitation of housing to meet the needs of low- and moderate-
    income families and individuals, the Secretary may make grants and
    loans from the Fund, under terms and conditions the Secretary may

    Secretary or the Commission may provide amounts to the States for
    making grants and loans to nonprofit, limited dividend, or
    cooperative organizations and public bodies for the purposes for
    which the Secretary may provide amounts under this section.
      (d) Loans. - 
        (1) Limitation on available amounts. - A loan under subsection
      (b) shall not be more than 50 percent (or 80 percent for a

      title) of the cost of planning and obtaining financing for a
      project, including preliminary surveys and analyses of market
      needs, preliminary site engineering and architectural fees, site
      options, application and mortgage commitment fees, legal fees,
      and construction loan fees and discounts.
        (2) Interest. - A loan shall be made without interest, except

      county designation is in effect under section 14526 of this
      title) of expenses, incident to planning and obtaining financing
      for a project, which the Secretary considers not to be
      recoverable from the proceeds of a permanent loan made to finance
      the project.

      Secretary may make grants and commitments for grants, and may

    districts, to take maximum advantage of federal grant programs for
    which they are eligible but for which, because of their economic
    situation, they cannot supply the required matching share, or for
    which there are insufficient amounts available under the federal
    law authorizing the programs to meet pressing needs of the region,
    the Federal Cochairman may use amounts made available to carry out
    this section - 
        (1) for any part of the basic federal contribution to projects
      or activities under the federal grant programs authorized by
      federal laws; and
        (2) to increase the federal contribution to projects and

      cost of the projects or activities otherwise authorized by the
      applicable law.

      (c) Certification Required. - For a program, project, or activity
    for which any part of the basic federal contribution to the project
    or activity under a federal grant program is proposed to be made

    responsible federal official administering the federal law
    authorizing the contribution certifies that the program, project,
    or activity meets the applicable requirements of the federal law
    and could be approved for federal contribution under that law if
    amounts were available under the law for the program, project, or
    activity.
      (d) Limitations in Other Laws Inapplicable. - Amounts provided
    pursuant to this subtitle are available without regard to any
    limitations on areas eligible for assistance or authorizations for
    appropriation in any other law.
      (e) Acceptance of Certain Material. - For a supplemental grant
    for a project or activity under a federal grant program, the
    Federal Cochairman shall accept any finding, report, certification,
    or documentation required to be submitted to the head of the
    department, agency, or instrumentality of the Federal Government
    responsible for the administration of the program.
      (f) Federal Share. - The federal portion of the cost of a project
    or activity shall not - 
        (1) be increased to more than the percentages the Commission
      establishes; nor
        (2) be more than 80 percent of the cost.

      (g) Maximum Commission Contribution. - 
        (1) In general. - Subject to paragraph (2), the Commission may
      contribute not more than 50 percent of a project or activity cost
      eligible for financial assistance under this section from amounts

-STATUTE-
      A State or political subdivision of a State is not eligible to
    receive benefits under this subtitle unless the aggregate
    expenditure of state amounts, except expenditures for participation
    in the Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense
    Highways and local and federal amounts, for the benefit of the area
    within the State located in the Appalachian region is maintained at
    a level which does not fall below the average level of those
    expenditures for the State's last two full fiscal years prior to
    March 9, 1965. In computing the level, a State's past expenditure
    for participation in the Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate
    and Defense Highways and expenditures of local and federal amounts
    shall not be included. The Commission shall recommend to the
    President a lesser requirement when it finds that a substantial
    population decrease in that part of a State which lies within the
    region would not justify a state expenditure equal to the average
    level of the last two years or when it finds that a State's average
    level of expenditure in an individual program has been
    disproportionate to the present need for that part of the State.

-STATUTE-
      (a) Factors To Be Considered. - In considering programs and
    projects to be given assistance under this subtitle, and in
    establishing a priority ranking of the requests for assistance
    presented to the Appalachian Regional Commission, the Commission
    shall follow procedures that will ensure consideration of - 
        (1) the relationship of the project or class of projects to
      overall regional development, including its location in a
      severely and persistently distressed county or area;
        (2) the population and area to be served by the project or
      class of projects, including the per capita market income and the
      unemployment rates in the area;
        (3) the relative financial resources available to the State or
      political subdivisions or instrumentalities of the State that
      seek to undertake the project;
        (4) the importance of the project or class of projects in
      relation to other projects or classes of projects that may be in
      competition for the same amounts;
        (5) the prospects that the project for which assistance is
      sought will improve, on a continuing rather than a temporary
      basis, the opportunities for employment, the average level of
      income, or the economic and social development of the area served
      by the project; and
        (6) the extent to which the project design provides for
      detailed outcome measurements by which grant expenditures may be
      evaluated.

      (b) Limitation on Use. - Financial assistance made available
    under this subtitle shall not be used to assist establishments
    relocating from one area to another.
      (c) Determination Required Before Amounts May Be Provided. -
    Amounts may be provided for programs and projects in a State under
    this subtitle only if the Commission determines that the level of
    federal and state financial assistance under other laws for the
    same type of programs or projects in that part of the State within
    the Appalachian region will not be diminished in order to
    substitute amounts authorized by this subtitle.
      (d) Minimum Amount of Assistance to Distressed Counties and
    Areas. - For each fiscal year, not less than 50 percent of the
    amount of grant expenditures the Commission approves shall support
    activities or projects that benefit severely and persistently
    distressed counties and areas.

    Sec. 14525. State development planning process

-STATUTE-
      (a) State Development Plan. - Pursuant to policies the
    Appalachian Regional Commission establishes, each state member
    shall submit a development plan for the area of the State within
    the Appalachian region. The plan shall - 
        (1) be submitted according to a schedule the Commission
      prescribes;
        (2) reflect the goals, objectives, and priorities identified in
      the regional development plan and in any subregional development
      plan that may be approved for the subregion of which the State is
      a part;
        (3) describe the state organization and continuous process for
      Appalachian development planning, including - 
          (A) the procedures established by the State for the
        participation of local development districts in the process;
          (B) how the process is related to overall statewide planning
        and budgeting processes; and
          (C) the method of coordinating planning and projects in the
        region under this subtitle, the Public Works and Economic
        Development Act of 1965 (42 U.S.C. 3121 et seq.), and other
        federal, state, and local programs;

        (4) set forth the goals, objectives, and priorities of the
      State for the region, as established by the Governor, and
      identify the needs on which the goals, objectives, and priorities
      are based; and
        (5) describe the development strategies for achieving the
      goals, objectives, and priorities, including funding sources, and
      recommendations for specific projects to receive assistance under
      this subtitle.

      (b) Areawide Action Programs. - The Commission shall encourage
    the preparation and execution of areawide action programs that
    specify interrelated projects and schedules of actions, the
    necessary agency funding, and other commitments to implement the
    programs. The programs shall make appropriate use of existing plans
    affecting the area.
      (c) Local Development Districts. - Local development districts
    certified by the State as described in section 14102(a)(2) of this
    title provide the linkage between state and substate planning and
    development. The districts shall assist the States in the
    coordination of areawide programs and projects and may prepare and
    adopt areawide plans or action programs. In carrying out the
    development planning process, including the selection of programs
    and projects for assistance, States shall consult with local
    development districts, local units of government, and citizen
    groups and shall consider the goals, objectives, priorities, and
    recommendations of those bodies.
      (d) Federal Responsibilities. - To the maximum extent
    practicable, federal departments, agencies, and instrumentalities
    undertaking or providing financial assistance for programs or
    projects in the region shall - 
        (1) take into account the policies, goals, and objectives the
      Commission and its member States establish pursuant to this
      subtitle;
        (2) recognize Appalachian state development strategies approved
      by the Commission as satisfying requirements for overall economic
      development planning under the programs or projects; and
        (3) accept the boundaries and organization of any local
      development district certified under this subtitle that the
      Governor may designate as the areawide agency required under any
      of those programs undertaken or assisted by those federal
      departments, agencies, and instrumentalities.

          (A) designate as "distressed counties" those counties in the
        Appalachian region that are the most severely and persistently
        distressed; and
          (B) designate two categories of economically strong counties,
        consisting of - 
            (i) "competitive counties", which shall be those counties
          in the region that are approaching economic parity with the
          rest of the United States; and
            (ii) "attainment counties", which shall be those counties
          in the region that have attained or exceeded economic parity
          with the rest of the United States.

        (2) Annual review of designations. - The Commission shall - 
          (A) conduct an annual review of each designation of a county
        under paragraph (1) to determine if the county still meets the
        criteria for the designation; and
          (B) renew the designation for another one-year period only if
        the county still meets the criteria.

      (b) Distressed Counties. - In program and project development and
    implementation and in the allocation of appropriations made
    available to carry out this subtitle, the Commission shall give
    special consideration to the needs of counties for which a
    distressed county designation is in effect under this section.
      (c) Economically Strong Counties. - 
        (1) Competitive counties. - Except as provided in paragraphs
      (3) and (4), assistance under this subtitle for a project that is

      than 30 percent of the project cost.
        (2) Attainment counties. - Except as provided in paragraphs (3)
      and (4), amounts may not be provided under this subtitle for a
      project that is carried out in a county for which an attainment
      county designation is in effect under this section.
        (3) Exceptions. - Paragraphs (1) and (2) do not apply to -

-STATUTE-
      In this chapter, the following definitions apply:
        (1) Executive agency. - The term "executive agency" - 
          (A) means an executive agency (as that term is defined in
        section 105 of title 5) that operates at least 300 motor
        vehicles; but
          (B) does not include the Tennessee Valley Authority.

        (2) Motor vehicle. - The term "motor vehicle" means - 
          (A) a vehicle self-propelled or drawn by mechanical power;
        but not
          (B) a vehicle designed or used for military field training,
        combat, or tactical purposes, or any other special purpose
        vehicle exempted from the requirements of this chapter by the
        Administrator of General Services.

    --------------------------------------------------------------------

      In this section, the text of 40:913(2)-(4) is omitted as
    unnecessary because the complete names of the Director of the
    Office of Management and Budget, the Administrator of General
    Services, and the Comptroller General of the United States are used
    the first time the terms appear in a section.
      Before clause (1), the words "this chapter" were in the original
    "this title", meaning title XV (Secs. 15101 to 15313) of the
    Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (Public Law
    99-272, 100 Stat. 330). In clause (2)(B), the words "this chapter"
    are substituted for "this part" as the probable intent of Congress
    because title XV of the Act does not contain part designations and
    the intention was probably to refer to title XV, which is restated
    as this chapter.

-STATUTE-
      (a) Priority in Reducing Headquarters Use. - The heads of
    executive agencies shall give first priority to meeting the goals
    established by the President under section 17507(a) of this title
    by reducing the costs of administrative motor vehicles used at the
    headquarters and regional headquarters of executive agencies,
    rather than by reducing the costs of motor vehicles used by line
    agency personnel working in agency field operations or activities.
      (b) Regulations, Standards, and Definitions. - The President
    shall require the Administrator of General Services, in cooperation
    with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, to
    prescribe appropriate regulations, standards, and definitions to
    ensure that executive agencies meet the goals established under
    section 17507(a) of this title in the manner prescribed by
    subsection (a).

    --------------------------------------------------------------------

      In clause (1), the definition of "agency" as referring to the
    head of any department, agency, or instrumentality of the United
    States Government is rewritten as a definition of "federal agency"
    to avoid confusion between the role of the "agency" and the "head
    of the agency". Throughout the chapter, the words "head of the
    federal agency" are used when the source provision is referring to
    action taken by an official as opposed to the concept of the agency
    as an institution.
      In clause (3), the text of 40:795(1) and (4) is combined to
    eliminate a definition (40:795(1)) that is used only once.

    Sec. 17902. Sale of electric energy

-STATUTE-
      (a) In General. - To conserve oil and natural gas and better
    utilize coal, the head of a federal agency may sell, or enter into
    a contract to sell, to any non-federal person electric energy
    generated by coal-fired electric generating facilities of that
    agency in Alaska without regard to any provision of law that
    precludes the sale when the electric energy to be sold is available
    from other local sources, if the head of the federal agency
    determines that - 
        (1) the electric energy to be sold is generated by an existing
      coal-fired generating facility;
        (2) the electric energy to be sold is surplus to the federal
      agency's needs and is in excess of the electric energy
      specifically generated for consumption by, or necessary to serve
      the requirements of, another federal agency;
        (3) the cost to the ultimate consumers of the electric energy
      to be sold is less than the cost that, in the absence of the
      sale, would be incurred by those consumers for the purchase of an
      equivalent amount of energy; and
        (4) the sale will reduce the total consumption of oil or
      natural gas by the non-federal person purchasing the electric
      energy below the level of consumption that would occur in the
      absence of the sale.

      (b) Pricing Policies. - Federally generated electric energy sold
    by the head of a federal agency under subsection (a) shall be
    priced to recover the fuel and variable operation and maintenance
    costs of the facility generating the energy that are attributable
    to that sale, plus an amount equal to one-half the difference
    between - 
        (1) the costs of producing the electric energy by coal
      generation; and
        (2) the costs of producing electric energy by the oil or gas
      generation being displaced.

-STATUTE-
      For purposes of economy, efficiency, and conserving oil and
    natural gas, the head of a federal agency, when practicable and
    consistent with other laws and requirements applicable to that
    agency, shall endeavor to purchase electric energy from a non-
    federal person for consumption in Alaska by a facility of that
    agency when (taking into account the remaining useful life of any
    facility available to that agency to generate electric energy for
    that agency and the cost of maintaining the facility on a standby
    basis) the purchase will result in - 
        (1) a savings to other consumers of electric energy sold by
      that non-federal person without increasing the cost incurred by
      any federal agency for electric energy; or
        (2) a cost savings to the federal agency purchasing the
      electric energy without increasing costs to other consumers of
      electric energy.

-STATUTE-
      (a) Accommodation of Needs for Electric Energy. - This chapter
    does not require or authorize a federal agency to construct a new
    electric generating facility or related facility, to modify an
    existing facility, or to employ reserve or standby equipment to
    accommodate the needs of a non-federal person for electric energy.
      (b) Availability of Revenue From Sales. - Revenue received by a
    federal agency pursuant to section 17902 of this title from the
    sale of electric energy generated from a facility of that agency is
    available to the agency without fiscal year limitation to purchase
    fuel and for operation, maintenance, and other costs associated
    with that facility.
      (c) Exercise of Authorities. - The authority under this chapter
    shall be exercised for those periods and pursuant to terms and
    conditions that the head of the federal agency concerned decides
    are necessary consistent with - 
        (1) this chapter; and
        (2) responsibilities of the head of the federal agency under
      other law.

      (d) Negotiation and Execution of Contracts and Other Agreements. -
     A contract or other agreement executed under this chapter shall
    be negotiated and executed by the head of the federal agency
    selling or purchasing electric energy under this chapter.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 18301. Findings and purposes

-STATUTE-
      (a) Findings. - Congress finds that - 
        (1) affordable public transportation is essential to the
      economic vitality of the national capital area and is an
      essential component of regional efforts to improve air quality to
      meet environmental requirements and to improve the health of both
      residents of and visitors to the national capital area as well as
      to preserve the beauty and dignity of the Nation's capital;
        (2) use of mass transit by both residents of and visitors to
      the national capital area is substantially affected by the prices
      charged for mass transit services, prices that are substantially
      affected by labor costs, since more than two-thirds of operating
      costs are attributable to labor costs;
        (3) labor costs incurred in providing mass transit in the
      national capital area have increased at an alarming rate and
      wages and benefits of operators and mechanics currently are among
      the highest in the Nation;
        (4) higher operating costs incurred for public transit in the
      national capital area cannot be offset by increasing costs to
      patrons, since this often discourages ridership and thus
      undermines the public interest in promoting the use of public
      transit;
        (5) spiraling labor costs cannot be offset by the governmental
      entities that are responsible for subsidy payments for public
      transit services since local governments generally, and the
      District of Columbia government in particular, are operating
      under severe fiscal constraints;
        (6) imposition of mandatory standards applicable to arbitrators
      resolving arbitration disputes involving interstate compact
      agencies operating in the national capital area will ensure that
      wage increases are justified and do not exceed the ability of
      transit patrons and taxpayers to fund the increase; and
        (7) federal legislation is necessary under section 8 of Article
      I of the United States Constitution to balance the need to
      moderate and lower labor costs while maintaining industrial
      peace.

      (b) Purpose. - The purpose of this chapter is to adopt standards
    governing arbitration that must be applied by arbitrators resolving
    disputes involving interstate compact agencies operating in the
    national capital area in order to lower operating costs for public
    transportation in the Washington metropolitan area.

      applicable procedures.
        (3) Interstate compact agency operating in the national capital
      area. - The term "interstate compact agency operating in the

    CHAPTER 183 - NATIONAL CAPITAL AREA INTEREST ARBITRATION STANDARDS

-HEAD-
    Sec. 18303. Standards for arbitrators

-STATUTE-
      (a) Definition. - In this section, the term "public welfare"
    includes, with respect to arbitration under an interstate compact -
    
        (1) the financial ability of the individual jurisdictions
      participating in the compact to pay for the costs of providing
      public transit services; and
        (2) the average per capita tax burden, during the term of the
      collective bargaining agreement to which the arbitration relates,
      of the residents of the Washington metropolitan area, and the
      effect of an arbitration award rendered under that arbitration on
      the respective income or property tax rates of the jurisdictions
      that provide subsidy payments to the interstate compact agency
      established under the compact.

      (b) Factors in Making Arbitration Award. - An arbitrator
    rendering an arbitration award involving the employees of an
    interstate compact agency operating in the national capital area
    may not make a finding or a decision for inclusion in a collective
    bargaining agreement governing conditions of employment without
    considering the following factors:
        (1) The existing terms and conditions of employment of the
      employees in the bargaining unit.
        (2) All available financial resources of the interstate compact
      agency.
        (3) The annual increase or decrease in consumer prices for
      goods and services as reflected in the most recent consumer price
      index for the Washington metropolitan area, published by the
      Bureau of Labor Statistics.
        (4) The wages, benefits, and terms and conditions of the
      employment of other employees who perform, in other jurisdictions
      in the Washington standard metropolitan statistical area,
      services similar to those in the bargaining unit.
        (5) The special nature of the work performed by the employees
      in the bargaining unit, including any hazards or the relative
      ease of employment, physical requirements, educational
      qualifications, job training and skills, shift assignments, and
      the demands placed upon the employees as compared to other
      employees of the interstate compact agency.
        (6) The interests and welfare of the employees in the
      bargaining unit, including - 
          (A) the overall compensation presently received by the
        employees, having regard not only for wage rates but also for
        wages for time not worked, including vacations, holidays, and
        other excused absences;
          (B) all benefits received by the employees, including
        previous bonuses, insurance, and pensions; and
          (C) the continuity and stability of employment.

        (7) The public welfare.

      (c) Ability To Finance Salaries and Benefits Provided in Award. -
    An arbitrator rendering an arbitration award involving the
    employees of an interstate compact agency operating in the national
    capital area may not, with respect to a collective bargaining
    agreement governing conditions of employment, provide for salaries
    and other benefits that exceed the ability of the interstate
    compact agency, or of any governmental jurisdiction that provides
    subsidy payments or budgetary assistance to the interstate compact
    agency, to obtain the necessary financial resources to pay for wage
    and benefit increases for employees of the interstate compact
    agency.
      (d) Requirements for Final Award. - 
        (1) Written award. - In resolving a dispute submitted to
      arbitration involving the employees of an interstate compact
      agency operating in the national capital area, the arbitrator
      shall issue a written award that demonstrates that all the
      factors set forth in subsections (b) and (c) have been considered
      and applied.
        (2) Prerequisites. - An award may grant an increase in pay
      rates or benefits (including insurance and pension benefits), or

      The text of 40:1302(3) and 1303(b) is combined because 40:1303(b)
    is the only place the definition of "funding ability" is used in
    the revised chapter.

    the parties receive an arbitration award to which section 18303 of
    this title applies, the interstate compact agency and the
    employees, through their representative, may agree in writing on
    any modifications to the award. After the end of that 10-day

    under subsection (a) shall take all actions necessary to implement

    exclusive representative of the employees concerned may bring a
    civil action in a court that has jurisdiction over the interstate
    compact agency for review of the award. The court shall review the
    award on the record, and shall vacate the award or any part of the
