                  <p> This 
                    publication is the third in a series of five-year Pennsylvania 
                    farm fatality summaries. The first two publications were Pennsylvania 
                    Farm Fatalities During 1980-84 (Special Circular 319) and 
                    Pennsylvania Farm Fatalities During 1985-89 (Extension Circular 
                    390). The data summarized in this new publication come from 
                    death certificates and newspaper clippings. Information about 
                    some cases has been supplemented by other sources, including 
                    workers' compensation injury reports and police investigations. 
                    The data in this report cannot be compared directly with the 
                    data in previous reports because injury classification methods 
                    changed in 1990. These changes are explained below and in 
                    other sections of this report. 
                  </p><p> This 
                    publication introduces the Farm and Agricultural Injury Classification 
                    (FAIC) code to the general public as a way to categorize and 
                    describe fatal injury incidents associated with farms and 
                    agriculture. Because it uses the FAIC code, this report includes 
                    some cases that would have been excluded from earlier reports. 
                    For example, many cases in FAIC categories -05 to -11 would 
                    have been excluded from previous reports, even though they 
                    are of direct interest to many people concerned about preventing 
                    agricultural injury.

                  <b class="header2">Classifying farm 
                  fatalities</b><br />
                  <br />
                  Classifying unintentional agricultural fatalities is not an 
                  exact science. Because the term "agricultural" is sometimes 
                  used interchangeably with "rural" and "farm," classifying injury 
                  reports is a subjective task. Furthermore, since most farm residences 
                  are located at agricultural work sites, it often is hard to 
                  distinguish between work and nonwork injury cases, especially 
                  when the victim is a child. In addition, much of the work done 
                  on farms and in rural areas is not agricultural production, 
                  or farming. Finally, not all work on a farm is done by a farm 
                  worker. For example, an outside contractor erecting a building 
                  on a farm is certainly working on a farm, but the work is not 
                  production agriculture. It is construction work, and an injury 
                  to one of the workers should be attributed to the construction 
                  industry, not the agricultural industry.  
                  </p><p> The 
                    Farm and Agricultural Injury Classification code has been 
                    established to ensure more consistency in coding injury incidents 
                    related to farms and agriculture in Pennsylvania. It provides 
                    a rationale for consistent categorization of occupational 
                    (e.g., farming/farm production work) and nonoccupational 
                    (e.g., nonfarm production work/farm lifestyle) fatalities 
                    associated with farms and agriculture. This helps to identify 
                    situational exposures that are unique to farming and farm 
                    lifestyles. Table 1 identifies FAIC code categories and provides 
                    the number of fatality cases in each category from 1990-94. 
                    FAIC code categories are explained in the Appendix. Forty 
                    fatality cases could not be categorized because of a lack 
                    of information.

                  </p><p> There 
                    were 210 farm-related fatality incidents in the 1990-1994 
                    period. Table 1 shows that fatal injuries associated with 
                    the occupation of farming (Farm Production Work, FAIC-01) 
                    represent nearly all the cases, 103 of 105, associated with 
                    agriculture as an industry (FAIC codes -01-04). However, agricultural 
                    occupational work incidents account for only about one-half 
                    (103 of 210) of the total cases associated with farms and 
                    farm lifestyles. The remaining cases for which a FAIC designation 
                    could be made (65 of 105) are distributed throughout the categories 
                    that represent the overlap between farms as work sites, residences, 
                    and recreational areas (FAIC-05 to -11). The two categories 
                    with the majority of the remaining assigned cases (45 of 65) 
                    are associated with using farm machines, tools, buildings, 
                    etc., for nonfarm production purposes (FAIC-05, 18 cases), 
                    and with children and others being exposed to farm work site 
                    hazards (FAIC-06, 27 cases). A common FAIC-05 incident might 
                    involve a person, living on a farm or in a rural area, using 
                    a farm tractor and wagon to cut and haul firewood for personal 
                    use. A common FAIC-06 incident might involve a young child 
                    falling from a tractor while being carried as an extra rider, 
                    or a child falling through a floor opening while playing in 
                    a barn.

                  Previous 
                  reports computed the number of deaths per 10,000 farms in order 
                  to monitor progress in reducing the rate of fatal agricultural 
                  injury. As noted earlier, the recent introduction of the FAIC 
                  code prevents direct comparison between the data in this report 
                  and the data in previous reports. Therefore, this report also 
                  introduces other changes in data presentation. While deaths 
                  per number of farms is a good monitoring indicator, deaths per 
                  land in farms (LIF) is better because it more accurately reflects 
                  hazard exposures associated with farming. Table 2 presents fatalities 
                  per million acres of land in farms. The number of deaths and 
                  the death rate per million acres of LIF varied over the five-year 
                  period. As Table 2 illustrates, a one-year decrease or increase 
                  in deaths or the death rate does not indicate a trend.

                  Fatalities by cooperative extension region</b><br />
                  <br />
                  Penn State Cooperative Extension has divided the Commonwealth 
                  into four administrative regions. Figure 1 shows the counties 
                  in each region and the percentages of farm and agricultural 
                  fatalities and LIF in each region. The Southeast and West regions 
                  have slightly higher percentages of deaths than they do LIF. 
                  The largest differential is in the Central region, where the 
                  percentage of deaths was 6.7 percent less than the percentage 
                  of LIF. Tables 3 through 6 list counties by region and show 
                  the percent-ages of deaths and LIF that each county contributes 
                  toward the regional total. These tables show that some counties 
                  contribute a greater number of fatalities toward their region's 
                  totals than others. For example, in counties with at least 10 
                  fatalities, York County in the Southeast region and Butler and 
                  Westmoreland counties in the West region had approximately 
                  twice the percentage of their region's fatality cases as they 
                  did their region's LIF (Tables 5 and 6). The data also show 
                  that when a county has a large percentage of cases, it doesn't 
                  mean that the county has had more than its share of incidents. 
                  For example, Lancaster County had 18.8 percent of the cases 
                  in the Southeast region, the second highest percentage in that 
                  region, but it also had the highest percentage of the LIF in 
                  the region, with 17.3 percent of the regional total (Table 5).

                  Nearly all fatal injury incidents generate information that 
                  can be used to describe general trends and enhance understanding 
                  of when, where, how, and to whom farm and agricultural injury 
                  occurs. Such details as the victim's age, the activity he or 
                  she was engaged in, and the time the incident occurred are necessary 
                  for effective injury prevention planning. Several tables and 
                  figures are presented to give readers an overall picture of 
                  Pennsylvania farm and agricultural fatality incidents.  
                  </p><p> <b>Figure 
                    2</b> combines age groups of victims with the FAIC code categories. 
                    Appropriate information was available for 209 of the 210 cases. 
                    The graph shows the diversity of farm and agricultural fatal 
                    injury incidents while also illustrating how some types of 
                    incidents largely affect specific age groups. For instance, 
                    children 0 to 4 years of age and 5 to 9 years of age were 
                    most often killed (21 of 27 incidents) by exposure to farm 
                    work site hazards even though they were not actively engaged 
                    in farm work at the time (FAIC-06). More than twice as many 
                    senior farmers, 70 to 74 years of age, were killed during 
                    farm production work than were members of any other age group. 
                    Twenty-three farmers 70 to 74 years of age were killed during 
                    farm production work; victims 55 to 59 years of age had the 
                    next highest number of fatalities, with 11 cases. <b>Figure 
                    2</b> also shows that a substantial number of the FAIC-05 
                    incidents, 11 of 18 cases, involved people age 60 and over.

                  </p><p> Table 
                    7 shows the number of farm fatalities by three-hour intervals 
                    and by the days of the week, as well as the percentages that 
                    each contributed to the total number of incidents. Nearly 
                    two-thirds of the incidents, 62.4 percent, occurred between 
                    9:00 A.M. and 6:00 P.M. This is not surprising. When viewed 
                    in combination with the day of week data, this appears to 
                    suggest that no particular time of day or day of the week 
                    clearly stands out as a prime time for fatal injury incidents. 
                    However, combining the data from Table 7 with the data from 
                    Figure 3 brings the picture into better focus. Figure 3 shows 
                    fatality cases by the month in which they occurred. The majority 
                    of cases, 52 percent of the total, occurred during the late 
                    spring and summer months of May through August. This is the 
                    season when children and adolescents are out of school and 
                    are more exposed to farm hazards. These months also are a 
                    peak time for farm field work. The combined data from Table 
                    7 and Figure 3 suggest that fatal injuries are most likely 
                    to occur between 9:00 A.M. and 6:00 P.M. any day of the week 
                    between May and August. Injury prevention programs, strategies, 
                    and messages should target this time period.

                  </p><p> Table 
                    8 contains data for the 153 cases that were related to tractors 
                    and machinery, which accounted for 72.9 percent of the total 
                    number of incidents (210). Tractors were the major source 
                    of injury in 73.9 percent (113) of the 153 tractor and machinery 
                    incidents. The remaining 26.1 percent (40) involved a wide 
                    variety of other self-propelled and towed machines, or could 
                    not be specifically identified. Overturns accounted for nearly 
                    two-thirds of tractor-related fatalities (72 of 113, or 63.7 
                    percent). Twenty-nine tractor incidents involved people being 
                    run over; almost three-fourths of these cases (21 of 29, or 
                    72.4 percent) involved tractor operators who were run over 
                    by the tractor they were operating. The majority of these 
                    cases occurred during attempts to jump-start the tractor, 
                    or when the tractor rolled after the operator dismounted for 
                    some reason. There were no tractor power take-off (PTO) stub 
                    or other types of entanglement injuries. Nine cases (8 percent) 
                    fell into the Tractor, Other category. Three cases could not 
                    be categorized due to a lack of detailed information. 
                  </p><p> As Table 
                    8 shows, a broad array of self-propelled and towed machines 
                    are involved in a wide variety of fatality incidents on farms 
                    and in agriculture. However, bunching some cases reveals significant 
                    information for people interested in injury prevention. Eight 
                    of 16 incidents (50 percent) involving runovers by towed wagons 
                    and field machines happened either to riders on the equipment 
                    or to bystanders. Six of these eight cases (75 percent) involved 
                    children under 10 years of age, with four of the six victims 
                    between one and three years of age. The largest grouping of 
                    nontractor incidents (17 of 40, or 42.5 percent) involved 
                    machine entanglement. Nearly all the entanglements were associated 
                    with the machine's PTO shaft (seven of 17, or 41.2 percent) 
                    or with the machine's crop/material intake or processing area 
                    (nine of 17, or 52.9 percent). Another 25 percent (10) of 
                    nontractor incidents fell into the Other category, a catch-all 
                    group of incidents. The most frequent incident in this group 
                    was injury associated with the bucket on skid-steer loaders 
                    (three cases).

                    and machinery, which accounted for 27.1 percent of the total 
                    number of incidents. No single category stands out as involved 
                    most often in these incidents, and the data show that there 
                    are a number of different ways to be fatally injured. A farm 
                    structure such as a pond or silo was mentioned most often 
                    as the thing involved in the fatal incident (10 cases, or 
                    17.5 percent). This was closely followed by buildings; animals; 
                    and miscellaneous farm objects, materials, or products, each 
                    of which had 8 cases (14 percent). Four of the eight falls 
                    (50 percent) associated with buildings were falls off of a 
                    roof. Two of the remaining falls (25 percent) involved small 
                    children falling through barn hay drop openings. Eight of 
                    the 10 incidents (80 percent) involving farm structures were 
                    drownings, all occurring in farm ponds. Six of the eight (75 
                    percent) animal- related incidents were attacks and kicks 
                    by animals, including bulls (two), cows (two), a horse, and 
                    a mule. The other two incidents (25 percent) were falls from 
                    horses. 
                  </p><p> The 
                    five Motor vehicle/Struck by incidents include one vehicle/train 
                    crash; a raised truck bed falling on the victim; one crash 
                    involving two vehicles; and two farm truck drivers who had 
                    stopped along a roadway, stepped out of their trucks, and 
                    then were struck by other vehicles. Each victim was engaged 
                    in farm production work at the time of the incident. There 
                    probably are many more farm production work fatality incidents 
                    that involve motor vehicles, but go unreported.

                  </p><p> Figure 
                    4 shows fatal incidents by age groups. The data are consistent 
                    with, though not directly comparable to, previous summary 
                    reports showing that children age 14 and under and farm workers 
                    age 65 and over accounted for nearly 50 percent of the total 
                    number of cases. The two age groups accounted for 47.7 percent 
                    of the total during 1990-94; 49.7 percent during 1985-89; 
                    and 41.3 percent during 1980-84. Children age 14 and under 
                    and workers age 65 and over usually are not found in other 
                    hazardous occupations. Children age 14 and under often are 
                    untrained, inexperienced, not closely supervised, and emotionally 
                    and physically immature. On the other hand, the ability of 
                    aged workers to respond to danger often is limited as some 
                    effects of aging, such as slower reactions or decreased physical 
                    mobility, begin to have a pronounced influence on risk and 
                    hazard avoidance. On the surface, it appears that the risk 
                    of injury increases significantly at about age 70.

                  </b>Table 
                  10 has fatalities occurring to youth age 14 and under and senior 
                  farmers age 65 and over by type of incident. Tractors and machinery 
                  were associated with 19 of 31 (61.3 percent) incidents involving 
                  youth and 59 of 70 (84.3 percent) incidents involving senior 
                  farmers. While tractor and machinery incidents were the primary 
                  cause of fatal injury for both age groups, each group was affected 
                  by quite different types of tractor and machinery incidents. 
                  Only two overturn incidents involved young operators, accounting 
                  for 10.5 percent of their total tractor and machinery incidents. 
                  How-ever, senior farmers were involved in 30 overturn incidents, 
                  accounting for 50.8 percent of their total tractor and machinery 
                  incidents.

                  </p><p> Tractor 
                    runover incidents also varied considerably by age group. Youth 
                    age 14 and under were run over while being a rider in six 
                    of 14 cases (42.9 percent) or while being a bystander or on-the-ground 
                    helper in eight cases (57.1 percent). Senior farmers, on the 
                    other hand, almost always were run over while working with 
                    or around the tractor as the operator, a scenario that occurred 
                    in 14 of 16 cases, or 87.6 percent of the runover cases for 
                    their age group. In many of these cases, an operator was trying 
                    to jump-start a tractor while standing on the ground, thinking 
                    that the tractor was out of gear. There also were a number 
                    of incidents in which the tractor rolled as a senior farmer 
                    attempted to hook or unhook equipment to the tractor. In some 
                    cases the tractor was left in neutral, in others the brakes 
                    reportedly did not hold. 
                  </p><p> The 
                    three youth group incidents involving machinery other than 
                    tractors were entanglements with the machine; however, none 
                    of the entanglements involved the machine's PTO shaft. The 
                    same is not true for senior farmers. Four of seven (57.1 percent) 
                    nontractor machinery incidents involving senior farmers were 
                    entanglements with the PTO shaft. The other three incidents 
                    (42.9 percent) were entanglements in the crop/product intake 
                    or processing area. In six cases involving senior farmers, 
                    there was insufficient information to determine the specific 
                    type of machinery in the incident. 
                  <p> There 
                    were 12 incidents unrelated to tractors and machinery among 
                    the youth group, accounting for 38.7 percent of their total. 
                    There were 10 of these incidents among senior farmers, accounting 
                    for 14.3 percent of their total. Three of the 12 (25 percent) 
                    incidents involving youth were drownings in farm ponds. One 
                    child was trampled by a cow and two children fell through 
                    a barn hay drop opening. The rest of the fatalities were spread 
                    among a variety of other incident types. Nine of the 10 (90 
                    percent) incidents unrelated to tractors and machinery involving 
                    senior farmers were spread among a variety of types. An animal 
                    was involved in only one case, in which the victim was kicked 
                    by a horse. The remaining case involving a senior farmer lacked 
                    detailed information.
