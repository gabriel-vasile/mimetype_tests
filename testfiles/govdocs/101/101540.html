Full Text of Announcement

I. Funding Opportunity Description

    Purpose of Program: This program provides fellowships in areas of 
national need to assist graduate students with excellent academic 
records who demonstrate financial need and plan to pursue the highest 
degree available in their courses of study.
    Priority: In accordance with 34 CFR 75.105(b)(2)(ii), this priority 
is from the regulations for this program (34 CFR 648.33(a) and Appendix 
to Part 648--Academic Areas).
    Absolute Priority: For FY 2006 this priority is an absolute 
priority. Under 34 CFR 75.105(c)(3) we consider only applications that 
meet this priority.
    This priority is:

Areas of National Need

    A project must provide fellowships in one or more of the following 
areas of national need: Biology, chemistry, computer and information 
sciences, engineering, geological and related sciences, mathematics, 
nursing, and physics.
    Within this absolute priority the Secretary is particularly 
interested in applications that address the following invitational 
priority:
    Invitational Priority. Under 34 CFR 75.105(c)(1) we do not give an 
application that meets this invitational priority a competitive or 
absolute preference over other applications.
    This priority is:
    A nursing program that focuses on the preparation of nurse scholars 
at the PhD level for educational leadership roles. Graduates of this 
type of program will become the teachers preparing students for careers 
in nursing, and will disseminate to the public new knowledge gained 
from disciplined inquiry related to nursing and nursing education.

    Program Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1135.

    Applicable Regulations: (a) The Education Department General 
Administrative Regulations (EDGAR) in 34 CFR parts 74, 75, 77, 79, 82, 
84, 85, 86, 97, 98, and 99. (b) The regulations for this program in 34 
CFR part 648.

II. Award Information

    Type of Award: Discretionary grants, redistributed as fellowships 
to individual fellows.
    Estimated Available Funds: The Administration has requested 
$20,340,000 for new awards under this program for FY 2006. The actual 
level of funding, if any, depends on final congressional action. 
However, we are inviting applications to allow enough time to complete 
the grant process if Congress appropriates funds for this program.
    Estimated Range of Awards: $126,000-$253,000.
    Estimated Average Size of Awards: $211,000.
    Estimated Number of Awards: 96.

    Note: The Department is not bound by any estimates in this 
notice.

    Project Period: Up to 36 months.
    Stipend Level: The Secretary will determine the fellowship stipend 
for Graduate Assistance in Areas of National Need for the academic year 
2006-2007 based on the level of support provided by the graduate 
fellowships of the National Science Foundation as of February 1, 2006. 
However, the Secretary will adjust the amount, as necessary, so as not 
to exceed the fellow's demonstrated level of financial need as 
calculated for purposes of the Federal student financial aid programs 
under Title IV, part F of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended.
    Institutional Payment: The Secretary will determine the 
institutional payment for the academic year 2006-2007 by adjusting the 
previous academic year institutional payment, which is $11,822 per 
fellow, by the U.S. Department of Labor's Consumer Price Index for the 
2005 calendar year.

III. Eligibility Information

    1. Eligible Applicants: Academic departments of institutions of 
higher education that meet the requirements in 34 CFR 648.2.
    2. Cost Sharing or Matching: This program involves matching (See 34

CFR 648.40.

final performance report, including financial information, as directed 
by the Secretary. If you receive a multi-year award, you must submit an

Results Act (GPRA), three measures have been developed for evaluating 
the overall effectiveness of the Graduate Assistance in Areas of 
National Need program: (1) The percentage of fellows in the Graduate 
Assistance in Areas of National Need program who obtain a terminal 
degree in an area of national need, compared to the national average; 
(2) the percentage of fellows in the Graduate Assistance in Areas of 
National Need program from traditionally underrepresented populations 
who obtain a terminal degree in an area of national need, compared to 
the national average; and (3) the median duration of time from entering 
graduate school until degree completion compared to comparable doctoral 
students as identified annually in the Survey of Earned Doctorates.
    All grantees will be expected to submit an annual performance 
report documenting their success in addressing these performance 
measures.
