Maryland law should be sent to: John L. Wodatch, Chief, Disability 
Rights Section, Civil Rights Division, U.S. Department of Justice, 950

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
    Background: The ADA authorizes the Department of Justice, upon 
application by a State or local government, to certify that a State or 
local law that establishes accessibility requirements meets or exceeds 
the minimum requirements of title III of the ADA for new construction 
and alterations. 42 U.S.C. 12188(b)(1)(A)(ii); 28 CFR 36.601 et seq. 
Final certification constitutes rebuttable evidence, in any ADA 
enforcement action, that a building constructed or altered in 
accordance with the certified code complies with the new construction 
and alterations requirements of title III of the ADA.
    The Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development 
requested that the Department of Justice (Department) certify that the 
Maryland Accessibility Code, under .05.02.02 of the Code of Maryland 
Regulations (COMAR), as adopted pursuant to Article 83B, section 6-102 
of the Annotated Code of Maryland (together, the Maryland law), meets 
or exceeds the new construction and alterations requirements of title 
III of the ADA.
    The Department has analyzed the Maryland law and has preliminarily 
determined that it meets or exceeds the new construction and 
alterations requirements of title III of the ADA. By letter dated May 
29, 2003, the Department notified the Maryland Department of Housing 
and Community Development of its preliminary determination of 
equivalency.
    Effect of Certification: The certification determination will be 
limited to the version of the Maryland law that has been submitted to 
the Department. The certification will not apply to amendments or 
interpretations

[[Page 48940]]

that have not been submitted and reviewed by the Department.
    Certification will not apply to buildings constructed by or for 
State or local government entities, which are subject to title II of 
the ADA. Nor does certification apply to accessibility requirements 
that are addressed by the Maryland law that are not addressed by the 
ADA Standards for Accessible Design.
    Finally, certification does not apply to variances or waivers 
granted under the Maryland law. Therefore, if a builder receives a 
variance, waiver, modification, or other exemption from the 
requirements of the Maryland law for any element of construction or 
alterations, the certification determination will not constitute 
evidence of ADA compliance with respect to that element.
    Procedure: The Department will review comments received from the 
public regarding the proposed determination and, during the 60-day 
comment period, will hold an informal hearing in Maryland to provide an 
opportunity for interested persons, including individuals with 
disabilities, to express their views with respect to the preliminary 
determination of equivalency of the Maryland law. Interested parties 
who wish to testify at the hearing should contact Linda Garrett at 
(202) 353-0423 TTY or by e-mail at <A HREF="mailto:Linda.Garrett@usdoj.gov">Linda.Garrett@usdoj.gov</A>.    The hearing site will be accessible to individuals with 
disabilities. Individuals who require sign language interpreters or 
other auxiliary aids should contact Linda Garrett at (202) 353-0423 
TTY, or by e-mail at <A HREF="mailto:Linda.Garrett@usdoj.gov">Linda.Garrett@usdoj.gov</A>. A notice of at least four 
days before the hearing date would be greatly appreciated if 
individuals require sign language interpreters or other auxiliary aids.

    Dated: August 8, 2003.
J. Michael Wiggins,
Acting Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights.
