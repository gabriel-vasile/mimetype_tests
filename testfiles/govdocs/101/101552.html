SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: We announce the availability of an ITP&nbsp;
application, HCP, and EA. The EA is an assessment of the likely&nbsp;
environmental impacts associated with this Project. Copies of these&nbsp;
documents may be obtained by making a request, in writing, to the&nbsp;
Regional Office (see ADDRESSES). This notice is provided under section&nbsp;
10 of the Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) and National Environmental&nbsp;
Policy Act regulations at 40 CFR 1506.6. The Applicant's HCP describes&nbsp;
the mitigation and minimization measures proposed to address the&nbsp;
effects of the Project to the Perdido Key beach mouse.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We specifically request information, views, and opinions from the&nbsp;
public via this notice on the Federal action, including the&nbsp;
identification of any other aspects of the human environment not&nbsp;
already identified in the EA. Further, we specifically solicit&nbsp;
information regarding the adequacy of the HCP as measured against our&nbsp;
ITP issuance criteria found in 50 CFR parts 13 and 17.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you wish to comment, you may submit comments by any one of&nbsp;
several methods. Please reference permit number TE-126078-0 in such&nbsp;
comments. You may mail comments to the Service's Regional Office (see&nbsp;
ADDRESSES). You may also comment via the internet to&nbsp;
<a href="mailto:aaron_valenta@fws.gov">aaron_valenta@fws.gov</a>. Please include your name and return address in your&nbsp;

internet message. If you do not receive a confirmation from us that we&nbsp;
have received your internet message, contact us directly at either&nbsp;
telephone number listed below (see FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, you may hand-deliver comments to either Service office&nbsp;
listed below (see ADDRESSES). Our practice is to make comments,&nbsp;
including names and home addresses of respondents, available for public&nbsp;
review during regular business hours. Individual respondents may&nbsp;
request that we withhold their home address from the administrative&nbsp;
record. We will honor such requests to the extent allowable by law.&nbsp;
There may also be other circumstances in which we would withhold from&nbsp;
the administrative record a respondent's identity, as allowable by law.&nbsp;
If you wish us to withhold your name and address, you must state this&nbsp;
prominently at the beginning of your comments. We will not, however,&nbsp;
consider anonymous comments. We will make all submissions from&nbsp;
organizations or businesses, and from individuals identifying&nbsp;
themselves as representatives or officials of organizations or&nbsp;
businesses, available for public inspection in their entirety.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The area encompassed under the ITP includes a 1.05-acre parcel&nbsp;
along the beachfront of the Gulf of Mexico. The project is located on&nbsp;
the western portion of Perdido Key, a 16.9-mile barrier island. Perdido&nbsp;
Key constitutes the entire historic range of the Perdido Key beach&nbsp;
mouse.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Perdido Key beach mouse was listed as an endangered species&nbsp;
under the Act on June 6, 1985 (50 FR 23872). The Perdido Key beach&nbsp;
mouse is also listed as an endangered species by the State of Florida.&nbsp;
Critical habitat was designated for the Perdido Key beach mouse at the&nbsp;
time of listing (50 FR 23872). On December 15, 2005, we published a&nbsp;
proposed revision of critical habitat for the Perdido Key beach mouse&nbsp;
and Choctawhatchee beach mouse, and a proposed critical habitat&nbsp;
designation for the St. Andrew beach mouse (70 FR 74426).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Perdido Key beach mouse is one of eight species of the old&nbsp;
field mouse that occupy coastal rather than inland areas and are&nbsp;
referred to as beach mice. It is one of five subspecies of beach mice&nbsp;
endemic to the gulf coast of Alabama and northwestern Florida. Two&nbsp;
other extant subspecies of beach mouse and one extinct subspecies are&nbsp;
known from the Atlantic coast of Florida. As do other beach mouse&nbsp;
subspecies, Perdido Key beach mice spend their entire lives within the&nbsp;
coastal beach and dune ecosystem.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beach mouse habitat consists of a mix of interconnected habitats,&nbsp;
including primary, secondary, and scrub dunes including interdunal&nbsp;
areas. Beach mice are nocturnal and dig burrows within the dune system&nbsp;
where vegetation provides cover. They forage for food throughout the&nbsp;
dune system, feeding primarily on seeds and fruits of dune plants,&nbsp;
including bluestem (Schizachyrium maritimum), sea oats (Uniola&nbsp;
paniculata), and evening primrose (Oenothera humifusa). Insects are&nbsp;
also an important part of their diet.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beach mice along the gulf coasts of Florida and Alabama generally&nbsp;
live about 9 months and become mature between 25 and 35 days. Beach&nbsp;
mice are monogamous, pairing for life. Gestation averages 24 days and&nbsp;
the average litter size is three to four pups. Peak breeding season for&nbsp;
beach mice is in autumn and winter, declining in spring, and falling to&nbsp;
low levels in summer. In essence, mature female beach mice can produce&nbsp;
a litter every month and live about 8 months.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Several subspecies of beach mice have been listed as endangered&nbsp;
species, primarily because of the fragmentation, adverse alteration,&nbsp;
and loss of habitat due to coastal development. The threat of&nbsp;
development-related habitat loss continues to increase. Other&nbsp;
contributing factors include low population numbers, habitat loss from&nbsp;
a variety of reasons (including hurricanes), predation or competition&nbsp;
by animals related to human development (cats and house mice), and the&nbsp;
existing strength or lack of regulations regarding coastal development.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The EA considers the environmental consequences of two alternatives&nbsp;
and the proposed action. The proposed action alternative is issuance of&nbsp;
the ITP and implementation of the HCP as submitted by the Applicants.&nbsp;
The HCP will provide for: (1) Minimizing the footprint of the&nbsp;
development; (2) restoring, preserving, and maintaining onsite beach&nbsp;
mouse habitat at the project site; (3) incorporating requirements in&nbsp;
the operation of the residence that provide for the conservation of the&nbsp;
beach mouse; (4) monitoring the status of the beach mouse at the&nbsp;
project site post-construction; (5) donating funds initially and on an&nbsp;
annual basis to Perdido Key beach mouse conservation efforts; (6)&nbsp;
including conservation measures to protect nesting sea turtles and non-
breeding piping plover; and (7) funding the mitigation measures.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will evaluate the HCP and comments submitted thereon to&nbsp;
determine whether the application meets the requirements of section&nbsp;
10(a)

[[Page 48941]]

of the Act. If it is determined that those requirements are met, the&nbsp;
ITP will be issued for the incidental take of the Perdido Key beach&nbsp;
mouse. We will also evaluate whether issuance of the section&nbsp;
10(a)(1)(B) ITP complies with section 7 of the Endangered Species Act&nbsp;
by conducting an intra-Service section 7 consultation. The results of&nbsp;
this consultation, in combination with the above findings, will be used&nbsp;
in the final analysis to determine whether or not to issue the ITP.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dated: August 8, 2006.
Cynthia K. Dohner,
Acting Regional Director, Southeast Region.
