        <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>SUMMARY: 
          </b> This Interpretive Ruling and Policy Statement (IRPS) advises credit 
          unions that by adhering to the accounting principles and standards in 
          Section 2000 of the Accounting Manual, they would be in compliance with 
          the full and fair disclosure provisions of 12 C.F.R. Part 702. This 
          IRPS and a companion rulemaking have the effect of eliminating the Accounting 
          Manual for Federal Credit Unions and Data Processing Guidelines for 
          Federal Credit Unions from having the effect of rule. These actions 
          provide credit unions with greater flexibility in the area of recordkeeping.</font></p>

          INFORMATION</b></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The proposal 
          for IRPS 81-8 was issued as a companion action to the proposed deregulation 
          of the Accounting Manual for Federal Credit Unions (Accounting Manual) 
          by removing it from the incorporation by reference provisions of 12 
          C.F.R. 701.2 (46 Fed. Reg. 48940 October 5, 1981). Because of delays 
          encountered in the distribution of the Accounting Manual, the NCUA Board 
          extended the comment periods on both proposals from November 27, 1981, 
          until April 15, 1982 (47 Fed. Reg. 963 January 8, 1982, and 47 Fed. 
          Reg. 2122 January 14, 1982).</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In all, 16 
          comment letters were received from two trade associations, several credit 
          union leagues, and a number of individual credit unions. Virtually all 
          were supportive of the deregulation effort.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The majority 
          of the comments received agreed that the accounting principles and standards 
          in Section 2000 were sufficient to insure credit union compliance with 
          12 C.F.R. 702.3 (full and fair disclosure required). However, concern 
          was voiced by several commenters that certain provisions in Section 
          2030 of the Accounting Manual contradicted the intent of the deregulatory 
          effort. The commenters pointed out that while that section permits the 
          adoption of alternative accounting principles that conform to generally 
          accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the adoption of those principles 
          is effectively barred by the following statement:</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Credit unions 
          may adopt such accounting profession pronouncements provided they are 
          not inconsistent with the principles, standards and procedures set forth 
          herein or statutory or regulatory requirements.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The word "procedures" 
          in this statement implies that the procedures in the Accounting Manual 
          must be employed to ensure compliance with full and fair disclosure. 
          This language in Section 2030 of the Accounting Manual will be changed 
          at the next revision to read:</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Credit unions 
          may adopt such accounting profession pronouncements provided they are 
          not inconsistent with statutory or regulatory requirements or the principles 
          and standards set forth herein.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> A similar change 
          has been made in paragraph 2 of the IRPS.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Two commenters 
          suggested that credit unions be authorized to defer losses from the 
          sale of mortgage loans and mortgage related securities similar to the 
          treatment of such losses which is permissible for savings and loan associations. 
          The commenters recognized that such deferral is not in conformance with 
          GAAP and is not permitted by Section 2000 of the Accounting Manual. 
          Although the Agency is currently reviewing the issue of loss deferral, 
          it is a separate issue and not a part of this deregulation action.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Two commenters 
          suggested that by changing the account "Reserve for Contingencies" to 
          "Reserve for Loss Contingencies", credit unions are precluded from establishing 
          "an account for general contingencies". In those cases where a credit 
          union wishes to earmark a portion of undivided earnings for capital 
          accumulation or for some other general purpose the amounts so earmarked 
          can be recorded in Account No. 942 -- Appropriated Undivided Earnings. 
          This is a new account which was added in the recent Accounting Manual 
          revision for such uses.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Two commenters 
          suggested that the requirement to discontinue interest accrual and reverse 
          the accrual entry on loans which are delinquent 6 months or more was 
          too stringent. They suggested that the reversal should not occur until 
          the loan is determined to be a loss or until the loan is 12 months delinquent. 
          Appropriate changes to pages 2-12 and 4-79 of the Accounting Manual 
          will be made to accommodate this suggestion.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> One commenter 
          suggested several changes to Section 5000 to make the Accounting Manual 
          consistent with recent changes to Regulations Z and E. Appropriate changes 
          will be made to the Accounting Manual at a later date.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> One commenter 
          requested a further extension of 90 days on the comment period in order 
          to assess the impact on data processing which will result from changes 
          in the Accounting Manual. Although a further extension of the comment 
          period on deregulation of the Accounting Manual is not warranted, the 
          Agency will continue to accept comments and recommendations on any and 
          all parts of the Accounting Manual. Changes to the Manual will be made 
          on a regular basis and comments and recommendations will be considered 
          at those times.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In a companion 
          action, final rules have been issued that remove the Accounting Manual 
          for Federal Credit Unions (Accounting Manual) and Data Processing Guidelines 
          for Federal Credit Unions (Data Processing Manual) from incorporation 
          by reference in the National Credit Union Administration Rules and Regulations 
          under 12 C.F.R. 701.2 and 12 C.F.R. 701.14.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In October 
          1981, the Accounting Manual was extensively revised, a summary of the 
          significant changes is attached as Appendix A. Sections 1000, 3000, 
          4000, 5000, 6000, and 7000 provide guidance and offer suggestions to 
          Federal credit unions for accounting in all areas of operations. The 
          accounting principles and standards that Federal credit unions are expected 
          to follow in maintaining financial records and preparing statements 
          are contained in Section 2000.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The full and 
          fair disclosure provisions of 12 C.F.R. 702.3 define the required level 
          of disclosure needed on financial statements, require Federal credit 
          unions to select an accounting basis that is described in the Accounting 
          Manual, and instruct credit unions to prepare financial statements in 
          the manner prescribed in the Accounting Manual or equivalent financial 
          statements. This statement is to advise Federal credit unions that adherence 
          to the accounting principles and standards in Section 2000 of the Accounting 
          Manual will ensure compliance with the full and fair disclosure provisions 
          of Section 702.3. Of course, alternative accounting principles and guidelines 
          not inconsistent with statutory or regulatory requirements may also 
          satisfy these disclosure requirements. The remainder of the Accounting 
          Manual for Federal Credit Unions presents guidelines and recommended 
          procedures and practices.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> There are instructions 
          and discussions in the Accounting Manual that provide guidance for compliance 
          with statutory and regulatory requirements. For example: Section 4000 
          of the Accounting Manual discusses statutory regular reserve transfer 
          requirements of the Federal Credit Union Act and how the transfer is 
          calculated. The discussions in the Accounting Manual which relate to 
          the Federal Credit Union Act, NCUA Rules and Regulations or any other 
          statutory requirement are only summaries and Federal credit unions should 
          not interpret deregulation of the Accounting Manual as relief from those 
          rules and statutes.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Accordingly, 
          IRPS 81-8 is approved as an Interpretive Ruling and Policy Statement.</font></p>
        <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Text of 
          Statement of Interpretation and Policy</b></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 1. Full and 
          Fair Disclosure</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 12 C.F.R. 702.3(a) 
          defines full and fair disclosure as the level of disclosure a prudent 
          person would provide to a credit union member, the National Credit Union 
          Administration, or a creditor to fairly inform them of the financial 
          condition and results of operation of the credit union. The accounting 
          principles discussed in Section 2020 of the Accounting Manual provide 
          for a level of disclosure in financial reporting that will meet the 
          requirements of this Section of the regulation. Major concepts of Section 
          2020 are summarized as follows:</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> a. Going Concern 
          Concept -- Each credit union will normally maintain its accounts as 
          a "going concern" on the basis that its operations will be continued 
          indefinitely. Therefore, assets and liabilities will represent the value 
          to the credit union as a "going concern" and will not be based on liquidation 
          values. Whenever unusual circumstances indicate a limited life for a 
          credit union, e.g., if the credit union goes into a liquidation status, 
          the "going concern" concept will no longer apply. As a result, appropriate 
          modifications will be required to realistically state assets and liabilities 
          and recognize appropriate revenues and expenses. These modifications 
          would include, for example, a re-evaluation of the loan portfolio to 
          recognize possible discounts on sales of loans, an evaluation of the 
          realizable value of fixed assets in liquidation, possible adjustments 
          required in the carrying value of deferred charges and deferred income, 
          etc.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> b. Monetary 
          Basis for Accounting -- Accounts of each credit union will be stated 
          in terms of the dollar amounts involved at the time transactions occur. 
          The recording of each transaction in terms of dollar units provides 
          the best feasible indicator as to its relative impact on the overall 
          operations of the credit union. It also permits identification of the 
          amount of assets, liabilities, income or expenses represented by the 
          transaction.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> c. Consistency 
          in Accounting From Period to Period -- Consistent accounting practices 
          will normally be followed by each credit union from one accounting period 
          to the next. However, when a material change in accounting treatment 
          occurs, the facts must be disclosed on credit union financial statements, 
          including the dollar effect upon the balance sheet and the changes in 
          net income for the period.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> d. Timely Recognition 
          in Accounting Records -- Accounting transactions will be recorded on 
          a timely basis so that all material information applicable to each accounting 
          period will be shown in the records. To properly recognize in accounting 
          records and financial reports the reasonable value of assets, liabilities, 
          and shareholders' equity, each credit union will make provision for 
          estimated losses to be sustained in the collection or conversion of 
          loans and other assets by charges against current expenses. Estimated 
          amounts will be used in accruing income or expenses if actual amounts 
          are not known and cannot be readily determined. Differences between 
          the actual and estimated amounts will be absorbed in the operations 
          of the subsequent accounting period unless they are so large that they 
          seriously distort net income.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> e. Materiality 
          -- Material facts, individually and cumulatively, relating to credit 
          union financial activity must be recognized in the accounts of a credit 
          union and reported on its financial statements. A statement, fact, or 
          item is material if, giving full consideration to the surrounding circumstances 
          as they exist at the time, it is of such a nature that its disclosure, 
          or the method of treating it, would be likely to influence or to "make 
          a difference" in the judgment and conduct of a reasonable person. The 
          accumulation of many small items each of which in itself would not be 
          "material", would be "material" if the overall effect would tend to 
          influence the judgment and conduct of a reasonable person.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> f. Conservative 
          Accounting -- Each credit union will maintain its accounting records 
          on a conservative basis. It will make reasonable provisions in the accounts, 
          based on its best judgment, for potential losses on recorded assets 
          and the settlement of contingent liabilities. It will neither overstate 
          nor understate materially its assets, liabilities, revenues or expenses.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> g. Internal 
          Control -- Each credit union will adopt appropriate measures of internal 
          control to improve the dependability of its accounting records.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> h. Complete 
          Recording of Income and Expenses -- All income, expenses, gains and 
          losses will be recorded in income and expense accounts and shown on 
          the Statement of Income prepared for the accounting period. Income and 
          expense accounts will include actual and estimated loan losses, as well 
          as entrance fees, late charges and other assessments against members.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> i. Accounting 
          and Dividend Periods -- Credit union accounting periods may be monthly, 
          quarterly, semiannually, or annually depending on the period selected 
          by the credit union to close its books. Each credit union must close 
          its books at least annually. It is recommended that Federal credit unions 
          close the books at the end of each regular share account dividend period 
          unless dividends are paid more frequently than monthly. Provision must 
          be made for statutory reserve transfers and adjustments to meet valuation 
          allowance requirements when a credit union elects not to close the books 
          at the end of any dividend period except where such dividend period 
          is more frequent than monthly.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> j. Fiscal Year 
          -- The fiscal year of all Federal credit unions will begin January 1 
          and end December 31. This is a requirement of Section 110 of the Federal 
          Credit Union Act.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 2. Alternative 
          Accounting Principles Available</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Within the 
          accounting principles authorized by NCUA for use by credit unions, various 
          alternatives are provided for adoption at the option of any credit union 
          for certain types of transactions. These alternatives are designed to 
          provide the flexibility required for meaningful accounting under a variety 
          of circumstances that may be encountered by credit unions of different 
          size and scope of operations. Absolute uniformity is not required so 
          long as each credit union conforms its accounting to the authorized 
          accounting principles and standards.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The American 
          Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), the Financial Accounting 
          Standards Board (FASB), and their committees establish generally accepted 
          accounting principles (GAAP), accounting guidelines, and preferred accounting 
          treatment for various activities. Credit unions should refer to such 
          accounting profession pronouncements particularly where an activity 
          is not addressed in the Accounting Manual or other NCUA publications. 
          Credit unions may adopt such accounting profession pronouncements provided 
          they are not inconsistent with statutory or regulatory requirements 
          or the principles and standards set forth in Section 2000 of the Accounting 
          Manual.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 3. Selection 
          of an Accounting Basis</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 12 C.F.R. 702.3(b)(2)(i) 
          requires Federal credit unions to select an accounting basis as provided 
          in the Accounting Manual. The requirements of the Accounting Bases are 
          discussed in Section 2020 of the manual. Credit unions must use the 
          accrual or modified cash basis of accounting. The accrual basis is the 
          method of accounting under which liabilities and expenses are recorded 
          when incurred whether or not paid, and income is recorded when earned 
          whether or not received. Under the modified cash basis, transactions 
          are recorded when funds are received or disbursed except as described 
          below. Provision must be made to reflect: liabilities not paid when 
          due; dividends and interest refunds applicable to, but not paid in an 
          accounting period; deferred credits and charges applicable to future 
          accounting periods; estimated losses that may be sustained on loans 
          and other risk assets; and depreciation on fixed assets. The NCUA Board 
          encourages all Federal credit unions to adopt the accrual basis of accounting 
          because that method more precisely matches costs with income in accounting 
          cycles and provides for more timely recognition of changes to assets 
          and liabilities. It is also recognized by the NCUA Board that the accrual 
          method may be unnecessarily burdensome for many smaller Federal credit 
          unions. Thus, adoption of the accrual basis of accounting should be 
          subject to the following considerations:</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> a. The adoption 
          of the accrual basis of accounting is strongly recommended for credit 
          unions with assets of $2 million or more.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> b. Credit union 
          accounting should be maintained on the accrual basis by all other credit 
          unions for which such basis is deemed practicable by the board of directors.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> c. Where the 
          accrual basis is followed, a cash basis of accounting and reporting 
          may be applied to particular accounts where the results would be only 
          insignificantly different from the accrual basis. For this purpose "insignificantly" 
          refers to differences which would not be considered important for a 
          proper evaluation of the condition of, or operation of, the credit union.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> d. Credit unions 
          for which adoption of the accrual basis is not practicable will use 
          a modified cash basis of accounting.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> At the $2 million 
          asset range, operations are generally sufficient in scope to require 
          relatively advanced management techniques such as budgeting and asset/liability 
          management. To be effective, these techniques require financial data 
          and records which fully reflect the results of financial transactions 
          in appropriate accounting periods. Accordingly, the NCUA Board considers 
          accrual accounting to be a requisite of sound operations and not an 
          unnecessary burden.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 12 C.F.R. 702.3(b)(2)(ii) 
          requires the use of financial statements or equivalent format described 
          in the Accounting Manual. Section 2080 of the Accounting Manual sets 
          forth the conditions necessary to produce financial statements that 
          will meet the full and fair disclosure requirements of the regulation. 
          Major conditions are as follows:</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> a. Purpose 
          of Financial Statements</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The financial 
          statements of Federal credit unions provide the vehicle for accomplishing 
          the most important external function of the accounting process; that 
          of presenting fairly the financial position of the credit union at a 
          particular date and the results of operations for a particular period 
          in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and the 
          principles prescribed in Section 2000 of the Accounting Manual. The 
          financial statements are needed to permit management to make sound decisions 
          and effectively manage the credit union and to show how management has 
          carried out its stewardship to shareholders. In order to provide for 
          full and fair disclosure on financial statements all assets, liabilities, 
          reserves, and retained earnings, including valuation allowance accounts 
          as may be necessary to present fairly the credit union's financial position; 
          and all income and expenses necessary to present fairly the results 
          of the credit union's operations for the period covered by the report 
          must be disclosed.</font></p>

          Statement of Financial Condition and Statement of Income must be prepared 
          monthly. To provide for full and fair disclosure of financial condition, 
          a Statement of Changes in Equity should be prepared quarterly or at 
          the end of a regular share account dividend period, if the dividend 
          period is longer than quarterly. Credit unions following the accrual 
          basis of accounting should prepare a Statement of Changes in Financial 
          Position on an annual basis.</font></p>

          FCU 109E. These forms constitute the majority of the semiannual call

          provisions of 12 C.F.R. 701.13 and 12 C.F.R. 741.7 of the NCUA Rules 
          and Regulations. The required account numbers for these forms are described

          records and prepare financial statements which fully disclose their 
          financial condition. While the procedures in these sections are optional, 
          adherence to the principles and standards discussed in Section 2000 
          will ensure compliance with the full and fair disclosure requirements

          the existence of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and 
          other recognized accounting guidelines. This section indicates that 
          credit unions should rely on GAAP when the Manual does not address a 
          specific activity.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Section 2050.1.7.1

          to share accounts as savings rather than equity. The discussion included 
          in the Regular Reserve (Account No. 931) reflects the reduced transfer 
          requirements of P. L. 95-22 of April 1977. The Reserve for Loss Contingencies 
          (Account No. 933), (formerly the Reserve for Contingencies) has been

          that are known and determinable in amount. A new account, Appropriated

          to a lower rate of transfer during the same accounting period. This
