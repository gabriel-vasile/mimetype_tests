DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION

 
Direct Grant Programs

AGENCY: Department of Education.

ACTION: Notice reopening competitions or extending application deadline 
dates for certain direct grant and fellowship programs.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Secretary extends the deadline dates for the submission of 
applications for several programs. In all of the affected competitions 
the Secretary is making new awards for fiscal year (FY) 2006. The 
Secretary takes this action to allow more time for the preparation and 
submission of applications by potential applicants who have been 
affected by Hurricanes Katrina and/or Rita and are located in 
Louisiana, Texas, Alabama, Mississippi, and Florida. The reopening and 
extension of the programs or competitions are intended to help 
potential applicants compete fairly with other applicants under these 
programs.

    Note: Two of the affected programs or competitions are 
administered by the Office of Postsecondary Education and three are 
administered by the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative 
Services. You can find information related to each of these 
competitions under the ``List of Programs Affected'' in this notice.

    Eligibility: The reopening or extension of deadline dates in this 
notice applies to you if you are: (1) an institution of higher 
education, state educational agency (SEA), local educational agency 
(LEA), non-profit organization or other public or private organization 
applicant that is located in a federally-declared disaster area as 
determined by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) (see 
<a href="http://www.fema.gov/news/disasters.fema">http://www.fema.gov/news/disasters.fema</a>) and you were adversely 

affected by Hurricanes Katrina and/or Rita, or (2) an individual 
applicant who resides or resided, on the disaster declaration date, in 
a federally-declared disaster area as determined by FEMA (see 
<a href="http://www.fema.gov/news/disasters.fema">http://www.fema.gov/news/disasters.fema</a>
) and you were adversely affected by 

Hurricanes Katrina and/or Rita. You must provide a certification in 
your application that you meet one of these criteria for submitting an 
application on the Extended Deadline and be prepared to provide 
appropriate supporting documentation, if requested. If you are 
submitting the application electronically, the submission of the 
application serves as your attestation that you meet the criteria for 
submitting an application on the Extended Deadline.

Note for Individual Applicants Under Competition 84.170A, Jacob K. 
Javits Fellowship Program:

    The reopening or extension of deadline date for this competition

was adversely affected by Hurricanes Katrina and/or Rita.
