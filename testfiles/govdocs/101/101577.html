 1. Reserves and monetary base figures incorporate adjustments for discontinuities, or "breaks," associated with regulatory changes in reserve 
    requirements. (For more information, refer to table 3.)
 2. Seasonally adjusted, break-adjusted total reserves equal seasonally adjusted, break-adjusted required reserves plus unadjusted excess 
    reserves. (Also, refer to footnote 2 in table 2 and footnote 2 in table 3.)
 3. Seasonally adjusted, break-adjusted nonborrowed reserves equal seasonally adjusted, break-adjusted total reserves less unadjusted total
    borrowings from the Federal Reserve.
 4. Excess reserves NSA equals unadjusted total reserves (table 2, column 1) less unadjusted required reserves (table 2, column 3).
 5. The seasonally adjusted, break-adjusted monetary base consists of (1) seasonally adjusted, break-adjusted total reserves plus (2)
    the seasonally adjusted currency component of the money stock plus (3), for all quarterly reporters on the "Report of Transaction 
    Accounts, Other Deposits and Vault Cash" and for all those weekly reporters whose vault cash exceeds their required reserves, the 
    seasonally adjusted, break-adjusted difference between current vault cash and the amount applied to satisfy current reserve requirements. 
    (Also, refer to footnote 3 in table 2 and footnote 4 in table 3.)
 6. On June 26, 2008, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) extended credit to Maiden Lane LLC, as discussed in the notes to the Board's
    H.4.1 statistical release, "Factors Affecting Reserve Balances of Depository Institutions and Condition Statement of Federal Reserve Banks."
    Consistent with generally accepted accounting principles, the assets and liabilities of the LLC have been consolidated with the assets and
    liabilities of the FRBNY because the FRBNY is the primary beneficiary of Maiden Lane LLC.  As a consequence of this consolidation, the
    extension of credit from the FRBNY to the LLC is eliminated from the Federal Reserve's balance sheet, and, thus, the loan is not included in
    borrowed reserves.
 7. Prorated averages of biweekly averages.
 8. Averages of daily figures.

 1. Reflects actual required reserves, with no adjustments to eliminate the effects of discontinuities, or "breaks," associated with 
    regulatory changes in reserve requirements.
 2. Reserve balances with Federal Reserve Banks plus vault cash used to satisfy reserve requirements.
 3. The monetary base, not break-adjusted and not seasonally adjusted, consists of (1) total reserves plus (2) required clearing balances
    and adjustments to compensate for float at Federal Reserve Banks plus (3) the currency component of the money stock plus (4), for all 
    quarterly reporters on the "Report of Transaction Accounts, Other Deposits and Vault Cash" and for all those weekly reporters whose 
    vault cash exceeds their required reserves, the difference between current vault cash and the amount applied to satisfy current reserve 
    requirements. Currency and vault cash figures are measured over computation periods ending on Mondays.
 4. Excludes required clearing balances and adjustments to compensate for float and includes other off-balance-sheet "as-of" adjustments.
 5. Vault cash eligible to satisfy reserve requirements. It includes only vault cash held by those banks and thrifts that are not exempt
    from reserve requirements. Dates refer to the maintenance periods in which the vault cash can be used to satisfy reserve requirements.
 6. All vault cash held during the lagged computation period by "bound" institutions (i.e., those whose required reserves exceed their vault 
    cash) plus the amount of vault cash applied during the maintenance period by "nonbound" institutions (i.e., those whose vault cash 
    exceeds their required reserves) to satisfy current reserve requirements.
 7. Total vault cash eligible to satisfy reserve requirements, held by depository institutions not exempt from reserve requirements, minus the
    amount used to satisfy reserve requirements.
 8. Consists of carryover only at depository institutions maintaining reserves on the basis of two-week maintenance periods. Reflects excess (+) 
    or deficit (-) reserves eligible to be carried forward into the two-week reserve maintenance period ending on the date shown.
 9. Prorated averages of biweekly averages.
10. Averages of daily figures.

 1. Figures reflect adjustments for discontinuities, or "breaks," associated with 
    regulatory changes in reserve requirements.
 2. Break-adjusted total reserves equal break-adjusted required reserves (table 3, 
    column 3) plus excess reserves NSA (table 1, column 4).
 3. To adjust required reserves for discontinuities due to regulatory changes in 
    in reserve requirements, a multiplicative procedure is used to estimate what 
    required reserves would have been in past periods had current reserve 
    requirements been in effect. Break-adjusted required reserves are equal to 
    break-adjusted required reserves against transactions deposits.
 4. The break-adjusted monetary base equals (1) break-adjusted total reserves plus 
    (2) the (unadjusted) currency component of the money stock plus (3), for all 
    quarterly reporters on the "Report of Transaction Accounts, Other Deposits and 
    Vault Cash" and for all those weekly reporters whose vault cash exceeds their 
    required reserves, the break-adjusted difference between current vault cash and 
    the amount applied to satisfy current reserve requirements.
 5. Prorated averages of biweekly averages.
 6. Averages of daily figures.
