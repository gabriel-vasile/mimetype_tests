{description}   The Atlas II/Centaur rocket carrying the NASA/NOAA weather
                satellite GOES-L is revealed after the tower was rolled back
                before launch. The primary objective of the GOES-L is to provide
                a full capability satellite in an on-orbit storage condition, in
                order to assure NOAA continuity in services from a two-satellite
                constellation. Launch services are being provided by the 45th
                Space Wing. Liftoff is targeted to occur at the opening of a
                launch window extending from 2:27 - 5:53 a.m. EDT, a duration of
                three hours and 27 minutes. Launch will occur from Pad A at
                Complex 36 on Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.
