COMMISSION ANNOUNCEMENTS

     
STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN 104 ISSUED

     The  Commission's  Office of the Chief Accountant and  the  Division  of
     Corporation  Finance  announced today the release  of  Staff  Accounting
     Bulletin  (SAB)  No.  104,  "Revenue  Recognition."   This  SAB  updates
     portions  of  the interpretative guidance included in Topic  13  of  the
     codification  of  staff  accounting bulletins  in  order  to  make  this
     interpretive  guidance consistent with current authoritative  accounting
     guidance. The principal revisions relate to the deletion of material  no
     longer  necessary  because  of  private  sector  developments  in   U.S.
     generally  accepted  accounting principles,  and  the  incorporation  of
     certain  sections  of  the  staff's "Revenue  Recognition  in  Financial
     Statements  --  Frequently Asked Questions and  Answers"  document  into
     Topic 13.

SEC   APPROVES  NYSE  GOVERNANCE  STRUCTURE  CHANGES;  PROPOSES  MUTUAL  FUND
DISCLOSURE RULES; SOLICITS COMMENT ON FUND TRANSACTION COST ISSUES

     The  Commission  today  voted  to  approve  changes  to  the  governance
     structure of the New York Stock Exchange; to publish for comment a  rule
     proposal  that would amend mutual fund disclosure requirements regarding
     breakpoint  discounts  and front end loads; and  to  publish  a  concept
     release  to  solicit  public  comment on mutual  fund  transaction  cost
     issues.
     New York Stock Exchange Corporate Governance Proposal

     On  Nov. 7, 2003, the New York Stock Exchange filed a proposal with  the
     Commission to amend and restate its Constitution to implement  a  series
     of governance changes (SR-NYSE-2003-34).  The proposal was published for
     public comment in the Federal Register on Nov. 13, 2003.  The Commission
     voted to approve the proposal.

     The  NYSE  will make a number of revisions to its governance  structure,
     including, most significantly, the following changes:

*    Independent Board of Directors.  The Board of Directors will be reduced
     from 24-27 members to between 6-12 members, plus the Chairman of the Board
     and CEO (if different than the Chairman).  Board members (except the CEO)
     will be required to be independent of management, the members, and issuers.
  
*    Constituent Board of Executives.  The Board of Executives will  be
     created as an advisory board, consisting of the Chairman and the CEO (if
     different than the Chairman), and at least 20 but no more than 25 members who
     will serve for one-year terms.  The members of the Board of Executives will
     include representatives of the Exchange's various stakeholders, including
     member firms, institutional investors, and listed companies.
  
*    Autonomous Regulatory Office.  The position of Chief Regulatory Officer
     will be created to oversee the NYSE's regulatory function.  The Board will
     appoint the Chief Regulatory Officer, who will report directly to  the
     Regulatory Oversight & Regulatory Budget Committee.  That independent Board
     committee will exercise control over the NYSE's regulatory plan, budget and
     staffing, and recommend the compensation of senior regulatory employees.
  
*    Independent Key Board Committees.  Four Standing Committees, consisting
     only of independent directors, will be created to oversee certain critical
     functions.  These are the Nominating & Governance Committee, the Human
     Resources & Compensation Committee, the Audit Committee, and the Regulatory
     Oversight & Regulatory Budget Committee.

     Enhanced Disclosure of Mutual Fund Breakpoint Discounts

     The Commission decided to propose amendments that would require a mutual
     fund  to  provide enhanced disclosure regarding breakpoint discounts  on
     front-end  sales loads.  This enhanced disclosure would assist investors
     in understanding the breakpoint opportunities available to them.

     Some  mutual  funds  with a front-end sales load provide  discounts  for
     larger  investments.  The investment levels required to obtain a reduced
     sales  load  are commonly referred to as "breakpoints."  In  determining
     whether an investor meets a "breakpoint," funds often allow the investor
     to  use  a  "right  of  accumulation" to aggregate shares  purchased  at
     different times, in different funds within a fund family, and by  family
     members of the investor.

     An  examination  sweep of broker-dealers initiated  by  the  Commission,
     NASD,  and the New York Stock Exchange late last year revealed  that  in
     32% of the transactions that appeared to be eligible for a reduced sales
     charge, investors did not receive the full reduction to which they  were
     entitled.   The  most  frequent causes for not  providing  a  breakpoint
     discount  involved problems with rights of accumulation,  including  not
     linking  an  investor's ownership of different funds in the same  mutual
     fund  family,  shares  owned by the investor in different  accounts,  or
     shares  owned by persons related to the investor.  Following  the  joint
     examination  sweep,  NASD  formed a Joint NASD/Industry  Task  Force  on
     Breakpoints, which issued its recommendations in July of this year.

     As  a  result  of the examination sweep and the Task Force  report,  the
     Commission  is  aggressively  attacking  industry  failures  to  deliver
     breakpoint   discounts  through  both  enforcement  investigations   and
     regulatory initiatives.  The proposals would require enhanced disclosure
     by mutual funds regarding breakpoints, as recommended by the Task Force.
     The proposals would:
  
*    require a mutual fund to provide a brief description in its prospectus
     of arrangements that result in sales load breakpoints, including a summary of
     eligibility requirements, with more detailed information permitted to be in
     the statement of additional information (SAI);
  
*    require a mutual fund to describe in its prospectus the methods used to
     value accounts in order to determine whether a shareholder has met sales load
     breakpoints;
  
*    require a mutual fund to state in its prospectus, if applicable, that in
     order to obtain a breakpoint, it may be necessary for a shareholder to
     provide information and records, such as account statements, to a mutual fund
     or financial intermediary; and
  
*    require a mutual fund to state in its prospectus whether it  makes
     available on its website information regarding its breakpoints.
       
     Comments  on  the  proposed  rule  amendments  should  be  sent  to  the
     Commission within 45 days of their publication in the Federal Register.

     expense calculators at http://www.sec.gov/investor/tools/mfcc/mfcc-
     int.htm and http://www.nasdr.com/fundcalc/expense_analyzers.asp.
  
     Investors  who believe that they have not received breakpoint  discounts
     to  which they were entitled should first contact their brokers and  ask
     that  the discount be applied.  If a broker does not correct the account
     or  provide  a  satisfactory explanation, the investor  should  write  a
     letter  to  the  firm's  compliance department and  ask  for  a  written
     response.  If that response is not satisfactory, the investor can file a
     complaint  with the SEC online at http://www.sec.gov/complaint.shtml  or
     with NASD at http://www.nasdr.com/complaints_file.asp.

     Request  for  Comments on Ways to Improve Mutual Fund  Transaction  Cost
     Disclosure
     
     The  Commission  decided  to  issue a concept  release  on  mutual  fund
     transaction  costs.   The release will seek public  comment  on  whether
     mutual  funds  should be required to quantify and disclose to  investors
     the amount of transaction costs they incur; include transaction costs in
     their  expense  ratios  and  fee  tables;  provide  other  measures   or
     additional  disclosure  that  would  indicate  the  level  of  a  fund's
     transaction  costs; or some combination of the above.  In addition,  the
     release will seek comment on whether mutual funds should be required  to
     record  transaction costs or the portion of those costs  that  represent
     soft  dollar benefits as an expense in their financial statements.   The
     release   also  will  ask  for  comment  on  the  adequacy  of  existing
     requirements for board review of transaction costs.

     Comments  in  response  to the concept release should  be  sent  to  the
     Commission  within  60 days of its publication in the Federal  Register.

ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDINGS


     
COMMISSION SANCTIONS STUART WINKLER

     The  Commission  has assessed a civil money penalty of $800,000  against
     Stuart  E.  Winkler of Dannemora, New York.  Winkler was chief financial
     and  compliance officer and supervisor of operations at A.S.  Goldmen  &
     Co.,  Inc., formerly a registered broker-dealer.  Since Winkler appealed
     the initial decision of an administrative law judge only with respect to
     the  penalty  that  the  law judge assessed,  the  Commission  made  the
     remainder  of  the law judge's decision as to him final.  Thus  the  law
     judge's order barring Winkler from association with any broker or dealer
     and  issuing  a  cease-and-desist order  against  Winkler  was  declared
     effective.

     Winkler was convicted in New York of the crime of enterprise corruption.
     He  admittedly engaged in a wide variety of illegal practices  including
     manipulation,  lying  to customers and regulators,  and  falsifying  and
     destroying  records.   The Commission stated that the  $800,000  penalty
     imposed  by  the  law  judge  was warranted  since  Winkler's  egregious
     misconduct  far outweighed any mitigative factors.  (Rels. 33-8348;  34-
     48940; File No. 3-9933)

COMPLAINT FILED AGAINST DOROTHY MAHLER, JOHN BRACEWELL, III, AND PATRICIA
JONES

     The Commission announced today that it has filed a complaint in the U.S.
     District  Court for the Middle District of Tennessee against Dorothy  L.
     Mahler  (Mahler),  John W. Bracewell, III (Bracewell)  and  Patricia  L.
     Jones (Jones), all residing in Tennessee.
     
     The  complaint  alleges  that  the defendants  perpetrated  a  financial
     reporting  fraud  involving the financial statements  of  Genesco,  Inc.
     (Genesco),   a   footwear  and  accessories  company  headquartered   in
     Nashville, Tennessee.  Mahler, President of Genesco's Johnston &  Murphy
     division,   Bracewell,  a  division  vice  president,  and  Jones,   the
     division's  Director  of  Customer Care, caused  Genesco  to  improperly
     recognize  $2.8 million of sales revenue prior to the end of  a  quarter
     and  in advance of a customer's requested shipping date.  The defendants
     improperly recorded revenue in the quarter to meet sales targets for the
     quarter.   This  overstatement of sales and earnings  was  reflected  on
     Genesco's financial statements included in its Form 10-K for fiscal year
     2001.
          
     The  complaint seeks permanent injunctions enjoining defendants  Mahler,
     Bracewell,  and  Jones from further violations or  aiding  and  abetting
     violations  of  Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(5)  of  the
     Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13b2-
     1  thereunder.   The complaint further seeks disgorgement  of  all  ill-
     gotten gains with prejudgment interest against Mahler and Bracewell, the
     imposition  of  civil  penalties against Mahler and  Bracewell,  and  an
     officer  or  director bar against Mahler.   [SEC v. Dorothy  L.  Mahler,
     John W. Bracewell, III, and Patricia L. Jones, Civil Action No. 3:03-CV-
     1202 MDTN] (LR-18508; AAE Rel. 1924)

COURT  IMPOSES $164,383,744 OF DISGORGEMENT, PREJUDGMENT INTEREST  AND  CIVIL
PENALTIES AGAINST DEFENDANTS IN MASSIVE PONZI SCHEME CASE

     The  Commission announced today that on December 10 the Honorable Edward
     Rafeedie,  Senior  Judge for the U.S. District  Court  for  the  Central
     District  of  California, issued a final judgment imposing  a  total  of
     $164,383,744  in disgorgement, prejudgment interest and civil  penalties
     against four defendants in a massive Ponzi scheme that raised over  $253
     million  from  over  6,000 investors across 48 states.   Judge  Rafeedie
     ruled  for  the  Commission after a hearing on  the  issue  of  monetary
     relief.   In  his  ruling,  Judge Rafeedie rejected  the  argument  that
     defendant  Larry T. Osaki (Osaki) of Upland, California, should  not  be
     held jointly and severally liable with the two entity defendants that he
     controlled,  J.T.  Wallenbrock & Associates  (Wallenbrock)  and  Citadel
     Capital  Management Group, Inc. (Citadel).  The ruling further  rejected
     the  argument  that  defendant  Van  Y.  Ichinotsubo  (Ichinotsubo)   of
     Cerritos,  California,  a  recruiter who significantly  assisted  Osaki,
     Wallenbrock  and  Citadel  in the fraudulent  scheme,  should  not  have
     disgorgement ordered against him because he was also an investor who had
     lost money in the scheme.

     The  U.S. District Court for the Central District of California  in  Los
     Angeles  had  previously entered an order on Feb. 28, 2003,  permanently
     enjoining  Wallenbrock,  a  general  partnership  located  in  Pasadena,
     California, Osaki, Ichinotsubo and Citadel Capital, a Nevada corporation
     located  in  Pasadena, California, by consent, from  violations  of  the
     antifraud,   broker-dealer  registration  and  securities   registration
     provisions of the federal securities laws.

     Judge  Rafeedie  ordered  defendants  Osaki,  Wallenbrock  and  Citadel,
     jointly   and  severally,  to  pay  disgorgement  of  $139,418,278   and
     prejudgment  interest  of $24,270,233.  Judge Rafeedie  further  ordered
     Defendant  Ichinotsubo to pay disgorgement of $409,798 plus  prejudgment
     interest  of  $85,435.  Judge Rafeedie additionally  ordered  Osaki  and
     Ichinotsubo to each pay a third-tier civil penalty of $100,000.  It  was
     further  ordered that the Defendants make the above payments  within  30
     days  of the filing of the Order. [SEC v. J.T. Wallenbrock & Associates,

INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT RELEASES
     

HENNION & WALSH, INC., ET AL.

     The  Commission issued an order to Hennion & Walsh, Inc., et  al.  under
     Section  6(c)  of  the Investment Company Act exempting applicants  from
     Section  12(d)(3) of the Act.  The order permits certain series of  unit
     investment  trusts  to  invest up to 10.5%,  14.5%  or  34.5%  of  their
     respective total assets in securities of issuers that derived more  than
     15%  of  their  gross  revenues in their most recent  fiscal  year  from
     securities related activities.  (Rel. IC-26296 - December 17)
