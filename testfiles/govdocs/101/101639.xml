>Stockpile management is the term used to describe the industrial aspects of maintaining the&#xD;U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile and complex. Board oversight activities for this strategic area&#xD;focus on assuring that current and planned operations at the Pantex Plant in Texas, the Y-12&#xD;National Security Complex in Tennessee, and tritium operations at the Savannah River Site in&#xD;South Carolina are accomplished safely according to approved standards.&#xD;Also included in this strategic area is the DOE stockpile stewardship program, which refers to&#xD;activities carried out by DOE to ensure confidence in the safety, security, and reliability of&#xD;nuclear weapons in the stockpile, in the absence of underground nuclear weapons testing. The&#xD;Board’s oversight of the stockpile stewardship program is centered on assuring the safety of&#xD;the research, development, manufacturing, and testing activities conducted at the Los Alamos&#xD;National Laboratory in New Mexico, the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in&#xD;California, the Nevada Test Site, and Sandia National Laboratories in New Mexico and&#xD;California.&#xD;Outcome: DOE will have acknowledged, acted upon, and/or resolved the health and safety&#xD;issues raised by the Board, and the facilities are operated to approved safety standards, rules,&#xD;orders, and directives. Follow-up technical evaluations of DOE’s nuclear stockpile activities&#xD;will verify necessary improvements in safety.</OtherInformation

>With the shutdown of major weapon production activities at defense nuclear facilities in the&#xD;early 1990s, substantial quantities of plutonium, uranium, transuranic isotopes, and irradiated&#xD;fuel have remained in storage for extended periods under potentially unsafe and deteriorating&#xD;conditions. The Board’s focus in this strategic area is to aid DOE in identifying these excess&#xD;materials and in reviewing DOE’s plans/programs to stabilize the materials and place them in a&#xD;safe configuration for storage pending future programmatic use or disposition.&#xD;Board oversight in this area will include the stabilization of spent nuclear fuel at the Hanford&#xD;Site in Washington and the Savannah River Site in South Carolina, the nuclear waste programs&#xD;being conducted at the Savannah River and Hanford sites as well as the Waste Isolation Pilot&#xD;Plant in New Mexico and the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory. The&#xD;Board will also provide health and safety oversight of DOE programs to safely deactivate and&#xD;decommission facilities at the Hanford and Savannah River Sites, the Y-12 National Security&#xD;Complex in Tennessee, the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site in Colorado, and the&#xD;Fernald and Mound Sites in Ohio, and the Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore National&#xD;Laboratories in New Mexico and California.&#xD;Outcome: DOE will have acknowledged, acted upon, and/or resolved the health and safety&#xD;issues raised by the Board. Follow-up technical evaluations of DOE’s nuclear materials&#xD;management and facility disposition activities will verify necessary improvements in safety, as&#xD;DOE meets its commitments to the Board to stabilize and dispose of hazardous nuclear&#xD;materials.</OtherInformation

>To ensure that safety is addressed early in the process, the Board reviews the design and&#xD;construction of new DOE defense nuclear facilities. These facilities must be designed and&#xD;constructed in a manner that will support safe and efficient operations for 20 to 50 years. This&#xD;requires a robust design process that will ensure appropriate safety controls are identified and&#xD;properly implemented early in the process. The Board’s expectation is that the design and&#xD;construction phases of defense nuclear facilities will be accomplished under approved nuclear&#xD;codes and standards, and demonstrate clear and deliberate implementation of Integrated&#xD;Safety Management (ISM) principles and core functions.&#xD;The Board’s reviews of the design and construction of major facilities and projects in this&#xD;strategic area are resource intensive and time consuming, but they result in significant safety&#xD;improvements. In recent years, there has been an increase in the number of new DOE&#xD;projects, with 20 to 30 projects in the design and construction phase. Examples of these new&#xD;projects include the Tritium Extraction Facility, currently under construction at the Savannah&#xD;River Site; the Hanford Waste Treatment Plant, which is in the design and construction phase;&#xD;the Highly Enriched Uranium Materials Facility, which is in the design phase at the Y-12 Site;&#xD;and the Pit Disassembly and Conversion Facility, which is in the design stage at the Savannah&#xD;River Site.&#xD;Outcome: DOE will have acknowledged, acted upon, and/or resolved the health and safety&#xD;issues raised by the Board. Follow-up technical evaluations will verify necessary safety&#xD;improvements in the design and construction of DOE’s new nuclear facilities and major&#xD;modifications to existing facilities. New nuclear facility designs will meet acceptable safety&#xD;standards.</OtherInformation

>The Board’s oversight effort in this area focuses on issues where a complex-wide perspective&#xD;on health and safety issues across the DOE complex is required to identify and correct generic&#xD;health and safety problems. Under the aegis of Integrated Safety Management (ISM),1&#xD;significant resources are applied to areas such as the technical competence of DOE’s Federal&#xD;workforce, the efficiency of DOE’s line management and safety oversight, and the&#xD;development and implementation of ISM systems with particular focus on safety analyses and&#xD;controls. Key supporting functional areas are also reviewed, such as quality assurance, nuclear&#xD;criticality safety, and training and qualifications.&#xD;The Board’s reviews in this strategic area often build on data collected at the field level in the&#xD;first three areas, integrating and analyzing the results to feed back key information that can be&#xD;used to direct safety program improvement across multiple management lines. For example, at&#xD;the Board’s urging, DOE issued a quality assurance improvement plan to strengthen the&#xD;implementation of existing quality requirements for safety-related components and systems.&#xD;Similarly, the Board continues its efforts to ensure that DOE maintains a vigorous nuclear&#xD;criticality safety infrastructure to support nuclear operations. The Board has been instrumental&#xD;in driving recent DOE efforts to verify that vital safety systems have been identified throughout&#xD;the defense nuclear complex and that their condition is understood and controlled.&#xD;Outcome: DOE will have acknowledged, acted upon, and/or resolved the health and safety&#xD;issues raised by the Board. In addition, follow-up technical evaluations of DOE’s safety&#xD;programs at defense nuclear facilities will verify necessary improvements in safety, and effective&#xD;implementation of ISM principles.</OtherInformation

>Interdependency of These Four Performance Goals:&#xD;The interdependence of these four strategic areas of concentration must be understood to&#xD;appreciate the efficiency of the Board’s operating plan and corresponding organizational alignment.&#xD;“Lessons learned” from the Board’s health and safety oversight activities crosscut into each of these&#xD;four areas. Health and safety hazards identified in Nuclear Material Processing and Stabilization (Area&#xD;2) must be transferred to the Nuclear Weapon Operations (Area 1) to avoid or mitigate new&#xD;remediation issues before they happen. Likewise, the lessons learned from Nuclear Facilities Design&#xD;and Infrastructure (Area 3) must be shared with managers responsible for preparing and enforcing&#xD;health and safety-related guidance, requirements, and regulations in Nuclear Safety Programs and&#xD;Analysis (Area 4).&#xD;For example, in order to oversee safety at the Y-12 National Security Complex, the Board&#xD;must assess the safety of hazardous activities that support the nuclear weapons stockpile (Area 1). To&#xD;accomplish its general goal, the Board must also assess processing and stabilization of nuclear materials&#xD;to support facility deactivation, such as Building 9206 (Area 2), construction of new defense nuclear&#xD;facilities such as the Highly Enriched Uranium Materials Facility (Area 3), and implementation of&#xD;important safety programs such as criticality safety (Area 4).&#xD;Another example of the interdependence of the four strategic areas of concentration is the&#xD;safety oversight of the Savannah River Site. At this site, the Board must evaluate not only the safety of&#xD;nuclear material processing and stabilization activities such as disposing of high level waste (Area 2), but&#xD;also the safety of nuclear weapon support activities involving tritium operations (Area 1), the&#xD;construction of new defense nuclear facilities such as the Pit Disassembly and Conversion Facility (Area&#xD;3), and nuclear safety programs such as high level waste tank integrity inspections (Area 4).&#xD;As discussed in Strategic Area 3 above, DOE is designing and constructing many new defense&#xD;nuclear facilities that will be used to support the nuclear weapon operations and/or nuclear material&#xD;processing and stabilization. To ensure that DOE protects the health and safety of the public and the&#xD;workers, the Board must pay close attention to the design, construction, start-up and operation of these&#xD;facilities, as well as major modifications to existing facilities, including the selection of governing safety&#xD;standards and requirements.&#xD;Equally important, the Board evaluates the directives, standards, and programs governing&#xD;DOE’s safe performance of its hazardous defense nuclear activities. The Board’s first three strategic&#xD;areas of concentration heavily rely upon the implementation of specific DOE rules and directives. The&#xD;Board’s integrated, comprehensive oversight of the safety of DOE’s defense nuclear facilities requires&#xD;that the Board carefully evaluate these safety programs.&#xD;The synergy gained from constant information-sharing among the Board’s matrixed staff which&#xD;supports all four strategic areas of concentration is key to achieving the Board’s general goal.</OtherInformation
