The completed application must be submitted to PIRO. In no case shall PIRO accept an application that is not on the Western Pacific Federal Fisheries Application Form.</p>  <p>  (2) A minimum of 15 days after the day PIRO receives a complete application should be allowed for processing a permit application for fisheries under subparts C, D, E, and F of this part. A minimum of 60 days after the day PIRO receives a complete application should be allowed for processing a permit application for fisheries under subpart J of this part. If an incomplete or improperly completed application is filed, the applicant will be sent a letter of notice of deficiency.
