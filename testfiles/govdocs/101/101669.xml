BACKGROUND

Distributional limits are a necessary ingredient of the vertebrate
modeling process for gap analysis: they allow us to place bounds on
where a species is predicted to occur.  For Montana Gap Analysis
(MT-GAP), we delineated known distributions for species in two ways:
latilongs for birds, and hexagons for all other species.

Latilongs (one-degree blocks of latitude and longitude) are units that
are fairly commonly used to document species presence or absence across
a state.  The 49 latilong blocks within Montana offer the advantage
of an equal-area sampling structure, but average 7977 sq km apiece
(calculated in Albers equal-area projection).  Thus, they are likely
to overestimate a species&apos; distribution where its range extends only
partly into a latilong.

Another option that alleviates this problem is the EPA&apos;s hexagon grid
system, based on units 635 sq km in size (White et al. 1992); Montana
contains all or part of 656 hexagons.  For Montana, hexagon distribution
maps were created for amphibians, reptiles, and mammals.  However, because
of project constraints, for birds we opted to use an existing system
based on latilongs (Montana Bird Distribution Committee 1996).  Because
of this difference in units, a single bird observation is extrapolated
across a larger area than observations for other species; in essence,
amphibian, reptile, and mammal distributions are mapped at a finer
resolution.

HOW HEXAGONS WERE POPULATED

Distributional limits for amphibians, reptiles, and mammals were mapped
using the hexagon grid system (White et al. 1992).  The Montana Natural
Heritage Program (MTNHP) was contracted to compile point locations and
populate EPA hexagons as outlined by Master et al. (1994) for each
species in these taxonomic groups, and to deliver both in GIS databases:
a point coverage for species&apos; observations, and a series of INFO tables
for species&apos; status within hexagons.  What follows is a description of
MTNHP&apos;s methods, as well as notes on how data were reviewed and used for
MT-GAP.

Point observations of these terrestrial vertebrates were compiled from the
following sources: museum specimens, published literature, unpublished reports
and theses, existing MTNHP databases, wildlife observations recorded by agency
and independent biologists, and a U.S. Forest Service database on carnivores.
Sources were entered into the MTNHP bibliographic database and given a unique
identifier called SOURCECODE.  The approximately 16,000 records of herptiles
and mammals compiled came from the following sources: ca. 8600 are specimens;
ca. 800 are from published accounts; ca. 3000 are from unpublished (gray
literature) accounts; ca. 1000 are from other databases; and ca. 2500 are
from sightings by individuals.

Species observations were entered into the MTNHP Point Observation Database
(POD).  This database, currently maintained using Microsoft Access software,
stores information on the species, source (SOURCECODE), date, observer,
type of record (sighting, specimen, &apos;heard only&apos;, etc.), breeding status, and
other details of the observation.

All available locational information was also entered into POD: descriptive,
coordinate (UTM or geographic), or Public Land Survey System (PLSS, or
township/range/section).  The locational information was then assessed to
determine (a) how best (most accurately and efficiently) to generate a point
feature for that observation and (b) the precision (measured in meters) of the
locational information. For example, an observation reported to a quarter
section would have a data precision of ca. 500 meters, since a point generated
in the center of that quarter section would be at most 500 meters from the
actual location.  However, an observation with only a descriptive location
(e.g., 20 miles south of Fort Musselshell) could have a data precision of as
much as 40,000 meters.  In every case, the point feature is created in as
accurate a location as possible; so, for the above example, MTNHP staff would
measure exactly 20 miles due south from their best estimate of Fort
Musselshell&apos;s location.

Observations with descriptive locations only were mapped onto a mylar overlay
of a 1:500,000 scale map of Montana that was mounted on foam board, and the
points were later digitized.  For observations with PLSS locations, points
were digitized on-screen, using the BLM&apos;s 1:100,000 scale PLSS coverage to
guide placement of the point.  For observations with coordinate locations,
points were generated in ARC/INFO.

When this work began, the POD system already contained ca. 4700 observations
of herptiles and mammals.  Many of these had been entered by mapping point
locations onto mylar overlays of a 1:1,000,000 map of Montana, or overlays of
the various National Forest Visitor Maps that cover parts of Montana.  These
pre-GAP observations had been assigned to three precision classes, rather than
estimating the actual (im)precision in meters.  Also, for many observations,
the precision with which they were mapped, and the points generated, were
worse (a greater distance) than their inherent data precision.  For example,
a museum specimen card might say &apos;west of Highwood,&apos; but also give a PLSS
location to the section.  That point, mapped on a 1:1,000,000 mylar overlay,
would have a mapping precision of ca. 3000 meters, but a data precision of ca.
1000 meters.  So at the start of this project, MTNHP staff retrofitted all
existing observations with both their data and mapping precisions, and then
re-mapped many of those for which the mapping precision was greater (less
precise) than the data precision.  After entering the data into POD and
creating a unique point feature for all observations, MTNHP staff used an
overlay analysis to create an initial hexagon status map for each species.
Each point was first buffered by its data precision, then overlayed with
the EMAP hexagon coverage.  If a certain hexagon contained 95% or more of
the area of a buffered point, the species represented by that point was
considered &apos;confirmed&apos; in that hexagon (Table 1).  If only 80-95% of
the area occurred in one hex, that hexagon was coded as &apos;probable&apos; for
that species.  For 10-80% overlap, it was coded &apos;possible&apos;, and for less
than 10% overlap it was not coded at all.  Note that under this scheme a
single observation could result in up to seven hexagons being coded as
&apos;possible&apos; for that species. (An observation mapped in roughly the center
of a hexagon with a data precision of ca. 40 km would overlay seven
hexagons, each containing roughly 14% of its buffered area.)

_____________________________________________________________________________

TABLE 1.  Confidence levels assigned to hexagons for each amphibian, reptile,
and mammal.

1.  CONFIRMED.  &gt;95% of an observation&apos;s buffered area*** within the hexagon,
or professional estimate of greater than 95% probability that the species
occurs within the hexagon.

2.  PROBABLE.  80-95% of an observation&apos;s buffered area within the hexagon,
or professional estimate of 80-95% probability that the species occurs within
the hexagon.

3.  POSSIBLE.  10-80% of an observation&apos;s buffered area within the hexagon,
or professional estimate of 10-80% probability that the species occurs within
the hexagon.

4.  HISTORICAL. Reported prior to 1950 (status based on that &apos;historical&apos;
report could be 1, 2, or 3).

5.  EXCLUDED.  Eliminated based on professional judgment.  Mostly accidentals:
observations likely to be migrating or dispersing individuals; habitat and/or
area could not sustain the species.  Occasionally, misidentifications detected
after initial hexagon population.

*** &apos;Buffered area&apos; means the area created by buffering the point location
for each observation by its data precision, as expressed in meters (i.e., the
more imprecise the data, the larger the precision and the larger the buffered
area).
________________________________________________________________________________

It is important to keep in mind just what the words &apos;probable&apos; and
&apos;possible&apos; mean in this context. There are no uncertain records in
POD -- observations which are questionable as to species are not entered.
The uncertainty, and hence the use of &apos;probable&apos; and &apos;possible&apos; vis-a-vis
hard (POD) data, relates only to locational accuracy.  In the example above,
the species was definitely observed (i.e., is confirmed) somewhere in that
7-hexagon area; but one cannot say with certainty in which particular hexagon
it occurred.

The result of this analysis was an intermediate data file that contained a
record for each POD-point/hexagon overlap.  That file was then queried to
retrieve the best record (&apos;confirmed&apos; better than &apos;probable&apos; better than
&apos;possible&apos;) for each species in each hexagon, and data from that record were
entered into the INFO files STATUS.DATA and SOURCE.DATA.  Each are matrices
of Montana&apos;s 656 hexagons (records) by its 148 mammals and herptiles (fields).
The STATUS.DATA file was then used to produce draft maps for each species that
showed its status in each hexagon.  The SOURCE.DATA file contained the unique
identifier, or SOURCECODE, for the source of the observation that supported
that species&apos; status in that hexagon.  For game animals, digital distribution
data from the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife &amp; Parks (MTFWP) was also
used to create additional species/hexagon overlap records.  These records have
as their source &quot;DFWP_9705&quot;.

The draft hexagon status maps were then subjected to in-house review at MTNHP.
Mammals were reviewed by J. Reichel, P. Hendricks, and P. Feigley; amphibians
and reptiles by J. Reichel, P. Hendricks, B. Maxell, and C. Peterson.
Reviewers used their personal knowledge of the species and published range
maps for Montana and adjacent areas to update the hexagon distributions based
on professional judgment.  For amphibians and reptiles, where documented
locations tended to be sparse, the following rules were used:

1.  Extensions of a species&apos; range beyond documented locations were made
conservatively unless: a) published records in adjacent states and territories
suggested a continuous range to the state border; b) published articles, theses,
or dissertations with reliable records suggested a range extension; or c) as a
function of computer processing, hexagons adjacent to a confirmed hexagon were
included when a modeled habitat type was continuous across the confirmed
hexagon and its neighbor.

2.  Hexagons within the known range of a species were included liberally, even
without documented presence.  The assumption was made that the modeling process
would later eliminate unlikely habitat within the range (e.g., exclusion of a
mountain range).

For more information on amphibians and reptiles, please see Appendix 3.1 in
Redmond et al. (1998), and also individual species accounts in Hart et al.
(1998).

A variety of sources were consulted when editing hexagon maps for mammals,
including maps (MTFWP atlas of ungulate and mountain lion distributions) and
published information (Hoffmann and Pattie 1968, Banfield 1974, Turner 1974,
Hall 1981, Clark and Stromberg 1987, Smith 1989, Pattie and Hoffmann 1992,
Buskirk et al. 1994, Groves et al. 1997).  Also, for all species, input was
sought from knowledgeable individuals.  In addition, T. Kohley (WY-GAP) was
consulted on hexagon population for wide-ranging mammals and bats.

Hexagons were edited to better reflect species&apos; known or expected distributions.
For some wide-ranging mammals, this meant overriding actual location data (see
definition for Status 5, Table 1). Examples include observations of wolverine
(Gulo gulo) in the Billings vicinity, and of moose (Alces alces) along the
Yellowstone River in eastern Montana, near the North Dakota border.

Based on in-house review by MTNHP, additional species/hexagon overlap records
were created and stored in a separate data file.  These records generally
raised the status of a species in a particular hex.  For example, suppose
species A in hexagon 1 was ranked as &apos;possible&apos; based on actual observations
entered into POD; but the reviewer felt that its status was at least &apos;probable&apos;
in that hex.  He or she would create that new record (species A in hexagon 1 =
&apos;probable&apos;), and attach his or her personal SOURCECODE to that record.
Occasionally, reviewers wanted to overwrite observation data based on transient,
dispersing or migrating individuals.  If so, he or she could create a new record
as above that would essentially erase POD-based records when generating the
hexagon status files.

All of these editing changes were then added to the species/hexagon overlap
records generated from POD data and a final query was run to retrieve the best
record for each species in each hexagon and appropriately code the STATUS.DATA
and SOURCE.DATA files.  Note that additional observations were being entered
into POD, and existing POD data were being remapped, while the review process
was occurring.  Because of this, in some cases reviewers&apos; records that
elevated a &apos;possible&apos; to &apos;probable&apos; were in turn superseded by newer POD data
that confirmed the species&apos; presence in a hexagon.

Later, once data had been passed to MT-GAP staff, these species-hexagon range
maps were again reviewed, this time for MT-GAP by biologists from around the
state.  Reviewers were given the opportunity to make changes to individual
hexagon occurrences if they questioned the assigned codes.  They were also
given the opportunity to add new locations to the database.

Species-hexagon range maps were then ready to be used as inputs to the final
vertebrate modeling process.  It should be noted that this is the only manner
in which these particular maps were used for MT-GAP.  Maps of species richness
within hexagons were created after distributions were predicted, and do not
reflect sums based on hexagons at this stage.  See Redmond et al. (1998) for more
information.

THE GIS DATABASE

HEXGRID is one of the primary inputs to the vertebrate modeling process
for MT-GAP.  It is a 90 m ARC/INFO grid (raster file) that maps
distributions for 144 amphibian, reptile, and mammal species by hexagon.
Of these 144 species, 135 were included in the vertebrate modeling
process.  The other 9, including species that are either exotic,
extirpated, or potentially occurring in the state, were not modeled.

In HEXGRID, each species is identified by its element code, a unique
identifier defined by The Nature Conservancy. Within the GIS database,
144 separate items (i.e., element codes) indicate each species&apos; presence
within each of 656 hexagons in the state, using the 7 codes above.
Hexagons are identified by the VALUE and HEX_ID items (which are
identical and therefore somewhat redundant).

For more information on the MT-GAP modeling process, please refer to the
Montana Gap Analysis Final Report (Redmond et al. 1998).  Habitat accounts,
species distribution maps, references, and modeling rules are found in the
Montana Atlas of Terrestrial Vertebrates (Hart et al. 1998).  Both are
available digitally in Adobe Acrobat PDF format.

each species within each hexagon (based on the locational accuracy
of a reported observation, professional judgment, or both).  See
Table 1 in the abstract above.  Initial hexagon population was
based only on actual observations; furthermore, any questionable
observations were not used to populate hexagons.  However, because
reported observations for many species are sparse and patchy, species
presence within hexagons was also assessed based on professional

acquire INFO files that indicate the likelihood that each
amphibian, reptile, or mammal is found in each hexagon.
Populating hexagons was an iterative process, so several
copies were acquired over time; the final version was
acquired in April 1998.

CREATE HEXAGON GRID:  Download ARC/INFO export file from EPA ftp site.
Import data to an ARC/INFO coverage, then project from geographic
coordinates to Albers equal-area projection.  At this point, the
coverage contains all hexagons for the Lower 48 states.  Identify
hexagons that overlap with the Montana border and put them in a
separate coverage.  Convert to grid format, using &quot;setmask&quot; and
&quot;setwindow&quot; commands so that the grid&apos;s extent and pixel increment
match all other MT-GAP grids.  Attach attributes to the grid using
the JOINITEM command (relate item = HEX_ID).

UPDATE: modify/update database slightly to make more suitable for
MT-GAP purposes, e.g., ensure match between element codes in the
hexagon database and those downloaded from TNC webpage in November
1997.  Incorporate species observations reported and comments made by
biologists from around the state during the expert review process.
Modify INFO data table HEXSOURCE.DAT so that changes suggested by
reviewers can be tracked.

<attrdef>
ELCODE is a generic name for the remaining set of 144 attributes
(one per species; see below).  Attribute names are element codes
(used by The Nature Conservancy) for each species; they identify
confidence levels for species occurrence in each hexagon.  For
example, AAAAA01080 indicates confidence levels per hexagon for
the long-toed salamander.  Not all species in the hexagon database
were included in the MT-GAP modeling process; some are exotic in
the state, etc.

Definitions for actual attribute values can be found in Table 1
in the abstract.  They are also provided at the end of the list
below, which links attribute names (i.e., element codes) with
scientific and common names for each species:

<attrlabl>ELCODE</attrlabl>
<attrdef>
ELCODE is a generic name for the remaining set of 144 attributes
(one per species, just as outlined above for HEXGRID.VAT).
As above, these attribute names are element codes for each species.
Element codes identify the source of the data provided for each
hexagon so that users can differentiate between observations
recorded in the original database provided by MTNHP (MTNHP_HEX)
and updates made during the MT-GAP review process.
</attrdef>
<attrdefs>none</attrdefs>
<attrdomv>
<udom>
Actual attribute values are source codes as defined by MTNHP
(and by The Nature Conservancy as a whole).  Based on instructions
obtained from MTNHP on 12/3/96, source codes are generally
determined by the following 12-digit structure: 1) source type;
2-3) year; 4-6) first three letters of author&apos;s last name;
7-8) tie-breaker (usually indicates the entry number for that
author in that year); 9-10) state; and 11-12) nation.  For
example, &quot;P98GAP01MTUS&quot; indicates source type = person,
year = 1998, author = GAP (short for GAP reviewers in this
instance), tie-breaker = 01 (the first entry in 1998 for GAP),
state = Montana, and nation = USA.

Source types include: A (article in journal or chapter in book);
B (book); F (field survey); I (illustrations and photos); J
(relevant journal titles, not to be used for articles appearing
in journals); M (maps and remote sensing); N (non-standard
published documents, including occasional papers, conference
proceedings, etc.); 0 (organizations, agencies, institutions,
or collections); P (person whose individual knowledge or expertise
constitutes the basis for the source); S (specimen); U (unpublished
materials including unpublished theses and dissertations); and E
(electronic sources such as internet homepages or email messages).

A complete list of source codes is unavailable, but users can
identify hexagons based on professional judgment as those with
source codes beginning with &quot;P&quot;.  For example, &quot;P97FEI01MTUS&quot;
indicates a professional judgment call made by P. Feigley in
1997.  All comments made by MT-GAP reviewers are denoted by
&quot;P98GAP01MTUS&quot;, as outlined above.
