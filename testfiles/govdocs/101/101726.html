    problems (BVPs). Given an interface problem, it is decomposed into several standard local
    boundary value problems that are coupled at the interface points. Meanwhile, a nonlinear
    equation involving the interface points is formulated from the interface conditions. The
    advantages of this approach are that the boundary conditions for each local problem can
    easily be selected by considering the natural physical requirements and that each of the
    local problems can be solved independently by standard numerical BVP techniques. </td>

    Fortran 77 programs intended for execution on machines with vector or shared-memory
    multitasking capabilities. In particular, the tool provides support for the task of
    modifying existing programs, written originally for serial execution, so that they perform
    well on advanced-architecture machines. The operation of VecPar77 is divided into two
    separately invoked phases. In Phase 1, two kinds of Fortran program analysis are
    performed: syntactic/semantic analysis to detect errors and anomalous constructions in a
    program, and Do-loop parallelization analysis. In Phase 2, VecPar77 acts as a specialized
    Fortran-intelligent editor, enabling a user to apply source-to-source transformations
    aimed at producing Fortran that compiles into code in which the number of references to
    main memory is reduced. VecPar77 is a direct descendent of Toolpack. It was created by a
    project jointly supported by the Numerical Algorithms Group, Inc., and the Department of
    Commerce and Community Affairs of the State of Illinois. </td>

    <td valign="top" width="75%">The authors describe a collection of software tools that
    analyze and transform Fortran programs. The analysis tools detect parallelism in blocks of
    code and are primarily intended to aid in adapting existing programs to execute on
    multiprocessors. The transformation tools are aimed at eliminating data dependencies,
    thereby introducing parallelism, and at localizing arithmetic in registers, of primary
    interest in adapting programs to execute on machines that can be memory bound (common for
    machines with vector architectures). The tools are unified conceptually by their use of a
    set of conditions for data independence; these conditions have been implemented so as to
    combine tool analysis with user/tool interaction. Included are timing results from
    applying the tools to programs intended for execution on two machines with different
    architectures--a Sequent Balance and a CRAY-2. The tools are written in Fortran in the
    tool-writing environment provided by Toolpack and are easily incorporated into a Toolpack

    is to aggregate the transformations and to apply them in a blocked fashion, thus achieving
    algorithms that are rich in matrix-matrix operations. These reductions typically are a
    preliminary step in the computation of eigenvalues or singular values. The authors
    demonstrate how the initial reduction to tridiagonal or bidiagonal form may be pipelined
    with the divide-and-conquer technique for computing the eigensystem of a symmetric matrix
    or the singular value decomposition of a general matrix to achieve algorithms that are

    <td valign="top" width="75%">The author describes techniques for the automatic generation
    of self-scheduling parallel programs. A high-level language is used to express both
    concurrent components of applications and scheduling algorithms. Partitioning and data
    dependency information are expressed by simple control statements. An automatic
    source-to-source transformation takes application code, control statements, and scheduling
    routines and generates a new program that can schedule its own execution of a parallel
    computer. The approach has several important advantages compared to previous proposals. It
    generates programs that are portable over a wide range of parallel computers. There is no
    need to embed special control structures in application programs. Finally, the use of a
    high-level language to express applications, load-balancing algorithms, and
    transformations facilitates the development, modification, and reuse of parallel programs.

    collection and tracing intraprocessor collection to permit individual processors to

    Reference Counting collection and the communication algorithms required to support a

    expression of complex algorithms, provide portability across different classes of machine,
    and allow reuse of existing sequential code. The authors have previously proposed
    bilingual programming as a basis for such tools. In particular, they have proposed the use
    of a high-level concurrent programming language (such as Strand) to construct parallel
    programs from (possibly pre-existing) sequential components. Here they report on an
    applications study intended to evaluate the effectiveness of this approach. They describe
    experiences developing both new codes and parallel versions of existing codes in
    computational biology, weather modeling, and automated reasoning. The bilingual approach
    encourages the development of parallel programs that perform well, are portable, and are
    easy to maintain. </td>

    <td valign="top" width="75%">The authors describe an approach to parallel program
    development based on the use of algorithmic motifs: useful parallel program structures
    that users can combine with application-specific routines to construct parallel programs.
    Key features are the use of a high-level concurrent programming language and automated
    source-to-source transformations to implement motifs. These features support the
    construction of new motifs from old by both modification and composition. This is turn
    encourages an exploratory programming style, in which programmers experiment to develop
    good parallel implementations of applications. The use of a high-level language encourages
    the user to view libraries implementing motifs as archives of expertise that can be
    consulted, modified, and extended when developing parallel programs. Examples of the
    approach are given. </td>

    This capability permits rapid experimentation with alternative structures and leads to
    both portable and scalable code. Although simple, the concepts form a sufficient basis for
    the construction of powerful programming tools. Both concepts and tools have been applied

    properties of a combustion front that propagates in the axial direction along the surface

    metallic powders, which combine upon ignition in a one-step chemical reaction. The
    reaction is accompanied by a melting process, which in turn enhances the reaction rate.
    The combustion products are in the solid state. The reaction zone, inside which the
    melting occurs, is modeled as a front that propagates along the surface of the cylinder.
    The different modes of propagation that have been observed experimentally (such as single-
    and multiheaded spin combustion and multiple-point combustion) are explained as the
    results of bifurcations from a uniformly propagating plane circular front. The stability

    retaining the ability to safely capture the numerical rank. The method uses incremental
    condition estimation and restricted pivoting in a forward pass to compute an approximation

    structure of the problem at hand. In a second pass, the algorithm of Chan is used to
    refine the estimates for the numerical rank and null space. Numerical experiments show

    Condition Estimation for Sparse Matrices,'' MCS-P106-0989.</td>
    <td valign="top" width="75%">Incremental condition estimation provides an estimate for the
    smallest singular value of a triangular matrix. In particular, it gives a running estimate
    of the smallest singular value of a triangular factor matrix as the factor is generated
    one column or row at a time. An incremental condition estimator for dense matrices was
    originally suggested by Bischof. In this paper the scheme is generalized to handle sparse
    triangular matrices, especially those that are factors of sparse matrices. Numerical
    experiments on a variety of matrices demonstrate the reliability of this scheme in
    estimating the smallest singular value. A partial description of its implementation in a
    sparse matrix factorization code further illustrates its practicality. </td>
