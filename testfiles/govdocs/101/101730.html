National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants:
Revision of Source Category List and Schedule for Standards Under
Section 112 of the Clean Air Act

AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

ACTION: Notice of revisions to the list of categories of major and area
sources and revisions to the promulgation schedule for standards.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: This notice publishes revisions to the list of categories of
major and area sources and revisions to the schedule for the
promulgation of standards for sources of hazardous air pollutants
(HAPs). Required under section 112(c) and (e) of the Clean Air Act
(CAA), the source category list and schedule for standards constitute a
significant part of EPA's agenda for

[[Page 63026]]

regulating stationary sources of air toxics emissions. The list and
schedule were most recently published in the Federal Register on
February 12, 1998 (63 FR 7155).
    Today's notice meets the requirement in section 112(c)(1) to
publish periodically, but at least once every 8 years, a list of all
categories of sources reflecting revisions since the initial list was
published. Several of the revisions identified in today's notice have
previously been published in actions associated with proposing and
promulgating emission standards for individual source categories, and
public comment has been taken in the context of those actions. Some of
the revisions in today's notice have not been reflected in any previous
notices and are being made without public comment on the
Administrator's own motion. Such revisions are deemed by EPA to be
without need for public comment based on the nature of the actions.
Today's notice also announces some anticipated actions.

EFFECTIVE DATE: November 18, 1999.

ADDRESSES: Docket No. A-90-49, containing supporting information used
in development of this notice, is available for public inspection and
copying between 8 a.m. and 5:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, excluding
legal holidays. The docket is located in EPA's Air and Radiation Docket
and Information Center, Waterside Mall, Room M-1500, 401 M Street, SW.,
Washington, DC 20460, or by calling (202) 260-7548. A reasonable fee
may be charged for copying docket materials.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Docket

    The docket for this action is A-90-49. The docket is an organized
file of all the information submitted to or otherwise relied upon by
the Agency in the development of this revised list of categories of
sources and revised schedule for standards. The principal purpose of
this docket is to allow interested parties to identify and locate
documents that serve as a record of the process engaged in by the
Agency to publish today's revision to the initial list and schedule.
The docket is available for public inspection at the EPA's Air and
Radiation Docket and Information Center, which is listed in the
ADDRESSES section of this notice.

    In addition to being available in the docket, an electronic copy of
today's notice is also available through the Technology Transfer
Network (TTN). Following signature, a copy of the notice will be posted
on the TTN's policy and guidance page for newly proposed or promulgated
rules http://www.epa.gov/ttn/oarpg. The TTN provides information and
technology exchange in various areas of air pollution control. If more
information regarding the TTN is needed, call the TTN HELP line at
(919) 541-5384.

I. What is the History of the Source Category List and Schedule?

    The CAA amendments of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-549) require, under section
112, that EPA list all categories of major sources emitting HAPs and
such categories of area sources warranting regulation, and promulgate
national emission standards for HAPs (NESHAP) to control, reduce, or
otherwise limit the emissions of HAPs from such categories of major and
area sources. Pursuant to the various specific listing requirements in
section 112(c), we published on July 16, 1992 (57 FR 31576), a list of
174 categories of major and area sources--referred to as the ``initial
list''--for which we would develop emission standards. Following this
listing, pursuant to requirements in section 112(e), on December 3,
1993 (58 FR 63941), we published a schedule for the promulgation of
emission standards for each of the 174 listed source categories.
    When we publish notices that affect actions relating to individual
source categories, it is important to reflect the resultant changes on
the list and schedule. On June 4, 1996 (61 FR 28197), we published a
notice that referenced all previous listing and schedule changes and
consolidated those actions, along with several new actions, into a
revised source category list and schedule. We published a subsequent
notice on February 12, 1998 (63 FR 7155), which again updated the list
and schedule; and on May 17, 1999 (64 FR 26743), we published a notice
which announced scheduling changes for promulgating standards. You
should read these previous notices for information relating to
development of the initial list and schedule and subsequent changes.

II. Why is EPA Issuing This Notice?

    This notice announces all list and schedule changes, as well as
proposed changes, that have occurred since we last updated the list on
February 12, 1998 (63 FR 7155) and the schedule on May 17, 1999 (64 FR
26743). There are also a few anticipated future actions which are being
announced in this notice; however, the proposed and anticipated actions
are not reflected in Table 1 at the end of today's notice since these
changes are tentative and are not being effected by this notice. We are
announcing these possible future actions to give the reader the maximum
notice of likely future actions. The list of changes, along with the
affected source categories, are listed below:

    The source category list and promulgation schedule, updated to
include today's actions, as well as actions from previous notices, are
presented in Table 1. Table 1 also includes Federal Register citations
for notices related to the source categories (Table 1 omits proposal
notices once a rule or rule amendment has been promulgated). Source
categories for which revisions have been made in today's notice are
marked in Table 1 for ease in discerning where revisions have been
made.
    For general descriptions of source categories listed in Table 1,
the reader is referred to Docket No. A-90-49 (EPA-450/3-91-030,
entitled ``Documentation for Developing the Initial Source Category
List''), and the Federal Register notice for the first revision of the
source category list and schedule (61 FR 28197; June 4, 1996). For
subsequent changes to descriptions of source categories for which a
rule has been promulgated, the reader is advised to consult Table 1 for
the citation of the Federal Register notice which will include the
amended definition and corresponding rule applicability.

III. What Are the Revisions EPA is Making to the Source Category
List and Schedule?

    The following sections describe revisions to the source category
list since the February 12, 1998 notice and the schedule since the May
17, 1999 notice, as well as proposed and anticipated future actions.

A. Changes to Source Category Names

    We are renaming the following source categories so that the names
better describe the source category:
    1. ``Tire Production'' is renamed ``Rubber Tire Manufacturing.''
    2. ``Plywood/Particle Board Manufacturing'' is renamed ``Plywood
and Composite Wood Products.''
    3. ``Baker's Yeast Manufacturing'' is renamed ``Manufacturing of
Nutritional Yeast'' to clarify the scope as well as distinguish it from
the regulation of bakeries (63 FR 55812).
    4. ``Paint Stripper Users'' is renamed ``Paint Stripping
Operations.''
    5. ``Chromium Refractories Production'' is renamed ``Refractories
Manufacturing.'' Due to source testing that confirmed major sources of
HAP emissions (i.e., greater than or equal to 10 tons per year (tpy) of
a single HAP or 25 tpy aggregate HAPs) from several types of refractory
manufacturing, we have determined that this source category should be
expanded to include several types of refractory manufacturing.
    6. ``Flat Wood Paneling (Surface Coating)'' is renamed ``Wood
Building Products (Surface Coating).''
    7. ``Ferroalloys Production'' is renamed ``Ferroalloys Production:
Silicomanganese and Ferromanganese.'' We have determined that these are
the only alloy types covered by the rule.
    8. ``Steel Pickling--HCl Process'' is renamed ``Steel Pickling--HCl
Process Facilities and Hydrochloric Acid Regeneration Plants.'' We have
decided, for informational purposes, that ``Hydrochloric Acid
Regeneration Plants'' should be added to the title since the rule
affects spent acid regeneration in addition to steel pickling
processes.
    9. ``Stationary Internal Combustion Engines'' is renamed
``Reciprocating Internal Combustion Engines.''
    10. ``Stationary Turbines'' is renamed ``Combustion Turbines.''
    11. ``Rocket Engine Test Firing'' is renamed ``Rocket Testing
Facilities.''

B. Correction to a Previous Notice

    This Federal Register notice announces one change to correct the
name of the Fume Silica Production source category. This source
category is one of the 174 source categories initially listed on July
16, 1992 (57 FR 31576). The name is being changed to correct a
typographical error. The correct name of this source category is
``Fumed Silica Production.''

C. Changes to the Promulgation Schedule

    In the December 3, 1993 notice (58 FR 63941), we scheduled the
initially listed source categories for regulation such that 50 percent
(87 of 174) would be promulgated by November 15, 1997. Consequently, to
continue to satisfy the numerical and temporal requirements of CAA
section 112(e)(1), any change that would delay the deadline for a
source category scheduled for regulation by November 15, 1997, must be
offset by a corresponding shifting of a source category from the
November 15, 2000 regulatory timeframe to the November 15, 1997
timeframe.
1. Pulp and Paper Production
    We are changing the schedule for Pulp and Paper Production, which
we included in the initial source category schedule in December 1993,
from November 15, 1997 to November 15, 2000. The Pulp and Paper
Production maximum achievable control technology (MACT) standard (40
CFR part 63, subpart S), applicable to pulping, bleaching, and paper
making operations, was promulgated on April 15, 1998. The MACT standard
for chemical recovery combustion sources at kraft, soda, sulfite and
stand-alone semichemical pulp mills (40 CFR part 63, subpart MM) was
also proposed on April 15, 1998. To address comments received on the
April 15, 1998 proposal, we anticipate the need to issue a supplemental
notice to the proposal before we can promulgate the standard.
Consequently, we are rescheduling the Pulp and Paper Production source
category for the November 15, 2000 regulatory timeframe, which will
allow us time to address issues raised by comments received on the
April 15, 1998 proposal.
2. Aerosol Can-Filling Facilities and Antimony Oxides Manufacturing
    To ensure that we meet the CAA section 112(e)(1) scheduling
requirements, we are countering the Pulp and Paper Production source
category scheduling change by moving two source categories, Aerosol
Can-Filling Facilities and Antimony Oxides Manufacturing, forward to
the November 15, 1997 regulatory timeframe. This move more than meets
the statutory requirement of promulgation of 50 percent of the
initially listed source categories by November 15, 1997. We are also
delisting these two source categories in actions under subsection E of
this section, ``Deletion of Source Categories.''

D. Addition of Source Categories

    Pursuant to section 112(c)(5), the Administrator may at any time
add categories to the initial source category list based on the same
criteria used to develop the initial list. Section 112(c)(5) also
states that the Administrator shall promulgate standards to regulate
HAP emissions from these added categories and subcategories within 10
years after enactment of the CAA amendments of 1990 (i.e., by November
15, 2000) or within 2 years after the date on which the category or
subcategory was listed, whichever is later.
    In response to new information, today's notice reflects the listing
of Cellulosic Sponge Manufacturing as a source category because it
contains facilities meeting the CAA section 112(a)(1) major source
criteria. This source category includes facilities that manufacture
cellulosic sponges using the viscose process. The HAPs are emitted from
the xanthation,

[[Page 63028]]

regeneration/washing, and salt recovery processes. The HAPs that are
emitted from these processes include carbon disulfide and carbonyl
sulfide. Pursuant to section 112(c)(5), this category is scheduled for
standards promulgation by November 16, 2001. You should refer to
subsection H of this notice for a discussion of the anticipated
subsumption of this source category into a broader cellulose source
category.
    With respect to the Clay Products source category, EPA anticipates
replacing the existing source category with four new source categories.
The Clay Products source category comprises four distinctly different
types of processes and products which will form the bases of the new
source categories. Those four anticipated source categories are: Brick
and Structural Clay Products Manufacturing, Ceramics Manufacturing,
Clay Minerals Processing, and Lightweight Aggregate Manufacturing. Each
of these source categories has unique emissions characteristics,
emissions controls, and economic considerations. We expect to propose
and promulgate separate MACT standards for each of the anticipated four
source categories. When each of the standards is proposed, that
proposal will add the new source category to the source category list.
The public will then have an opportunity to comment on adding these
source categories in conjunction with the MACT proposal. Pursuant to
section 112(c)(5), these source categories will be scheduled for
promulgation by November 15, 2000, the same date that the original Clay
Products source category was scheduled for promulgation.
    Today's notice also involves one other anticipated action to add a
source category named ``Wet-Formed Fiberglass Mat Production.'' During
the development of the Asphalt Roofing Manufacturing and Asphalt
Processing MACT standards, industry representatives alerted EPA about
the wet-formed fiberglass mat manufacturing industry, and its
relationship to the asphalt roofing production industry and companies.
We determined that wet-formed fiberglass mat manufacturing facilities
have the potential to be major sources. We have decided to develop a
separate MACT standard for the wet-formed fiberglass mat industry
because the production processes and pollutant emissions are different
from the asphalt roofing manufacturing and the asphalt processing
industries. We anticipate proposing a MACT standard for Wet-Formed
Fiberglass Mat Production in late 1999. That MACT proposal will add the
source category to the source category list, at which time the public
will have an opportunity to comment on adding this source category. We
will be scheduling this source category for MACT promulgation by 2
years after the date of listing of the source category, as specified in
section 112(c)(5) of the CAA.

E. Deletion of Source Categories

    The Administrator may, where appropriate, delete categories of
sources on the Administrator's own motion or on petition. In today's
notice, we are deleting two source categories, Aerosol Can-Filling
Facilities and Antimony Oxide Manufacturing, on the Administrator's own
motion. As discussed in the initial list notice (57 FR 31576), we
included these categories on the list because at the time, we believed
there were either major sources in each category, or sources collocated
on the premises of major sources. As such, CAA section 112(c)(1)
requires that we list these source categories. In today's notice, we
are deleting these source categories because available data indicate
that there are no major sources in either source category.
    This section does not include categories of sources which are being
removed from the list by way of subsumption into other listed
categories. Subsumption is not a deletion, but rather an action to
combine source categories on the list. See subsection H of this section
for information on source categories being subsumed into other listed
source categories.
1. Aerosol Can-Filling Facilities
    The Aerosol Can-Filling Facilities source category was initially
listed in July 1992 and was based on an industry survey performed by
EPA in 1987 which indicated that several fillers emitted HAPs in excess
of major source levels. The HAPs included methyl chloroform (also known
as 1,1,1-trichloroethane), methylene chloride (also known as
dichloromethane), tetrachloroethylene (also known as
perchloroethylene), and trichloroethylene. Work on the rule development
for aerosol can-filling began in 1997. Because the information that
supported the initial listing was limited and more than 10 years old,
new data was obtained.
    A comprehensive list of both custom and captive fillers, which
totaled 149 fillers, was obtained from industry trade associations. The
EPA's Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) for 1997 was then accessed. Reports
were obtained for 35 of the 149 fillers. We do not believe that the
non-reporting fillers emit HAPs in appreciable quantities. A facility
is not required to complete EPA Form R (Toxic Chemical Release
Inventory Reporting Form) if it manufactures or produces less than 12.5
tpy or uses less than 5 tpy of any chemical or chemical category on the
Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA) section 313 toxic
chemicals list.
    The HAPs reported included methyl chloroform, methylene chloride,
methanol, methyl ethyl ketone, tetrachloroethylene, toluene,
trichloroethylene, and xylene. Of the 35 reporting fillers, only one
reported emitting HAPs at more than major source levels (10.3 tons of
dichloromethane) in 1997. That filler was subsequently contacted to
obtain a copy of its 1998 Form R. That report indicates that 7 tons of
dichloromethane (the highest HAP emitted) and 14 tons of combined HAPs
were emitted in 1998. The filler has since committed, through its Title
V permit, to a federally enforceable requirement that caps HAP
emissions to less than 10 tpy for any single HAP and 25 tpy for any
combination of HAPs.
    In summary, there are no major sources in this source category.
Consequently, we are removing this category from the list of major
source categories selected for regulation.
2. Antimony Oxides Manufacturing
    The source category consists of four sources engaged in the
production of antimony oxide, a white, crystaline powder used mainly as
a flame retardant in plastics and textiles. Manufacturing processes
include oxidation of antimony ingots or crude antimony oxide in kiln-
type furnaces followed by radiative cooling and collection of refined
product oxide in baghouses. The initial listing of Antimony Oxides
Manufacturing as a major source category was based on the calculation
which assumed that 1 percent of the annual production of antimony oxide
in 1987 (20,700 metric tons) was released to the atmosphere.
    Since the initial listing, we have visited all four sources and
reviewed permit conditions to estimate emissions. In addition, two of
the sources performed stack tests to quantify their actual emissions of
antimony. Based on the above information, it is our conclusion that no
antimony oxides manufacturing facility emits antimony compounds
approaching major source levels. Our best estimate for the highest
emitting source is less than 6 tpy. Estimates for the other three
sources range from about 20 pounds per year to 3 tpy. Therefore, since
there are no major sources in this category, we are removing it from
the list.

[[Page 63029]]

F. Reassignment of a Source Category to a Different Industry Group

    On the initial source category list, the Rocket Testing Facilities
source category was categorized under the Miscellaneous Processes
industry group. The Rocket Testing Facilities source category includes
facilities that fire rocket engines to determine performance
specifications or compliance with other functional standards. The
category includes, but is not limited to, test firing of solid and
liquid fuel rocket engines. Therefore, this source category more
appropriately belongs under the Fuel Combustion industry group. The
movement of this source category will have no effect on the
promulgation date of the MACT standard.
    Today's notice also updates the source category list to reflect the
movement of the Tetrahydrobenzaldehyde Production source category from
the Miscellaneous Processes industry group to the Production of Organic
Chemicals industry group. You should refer to subsection H of this
notice to learn more about the subsumption of this source category.

G. Changes to the Scope of a Source Category

    Today's action serves to broaden the Boat Manufacturing source
category to include boats that are constructed of aluminum. In the data
gathering process for the Boat Manufacturing source category, we found
that there was a similarity in some types of emission points between
boats made of synthetic material and boats made of aluminum. In
addition, data gathered for aluminum boat painting operations indicate
that these operations would be addressed more appropriately in the Boat
Manufacturing source category, rather than in the Miscellaneous Metal
Parts Coating source category. Broadening the scope of the Boat
Manufacturing source category to include the manufacturing of aluminum
boats will not result in any change of schedule for this source
category.

H. Subsumptions of Source Categories

    Today's notice updates the source category list to reflect the
subsumption of eleven previously listed source categories under the
Agricultural Chemicals Production industry group into a single source
category, and also broadens the scope of that category to include a
number of other pesticide active ingredient (PAI) production operations
that were not included on the initial source category list. For further
information, you should refer to a June 23, 1999, notice (64 FR 33549),
which promulgated the MACT standard for PAI production. The eleven
source categories subsumed were: 4-Chloro-2-Methylphenoxyacetic Acid
Production, 2,4-D Salts and Esters Production, 4,6-Dinitro-o-Cresol
Production, Butadiene-Furfural Cotrimer (R-11) Production, Captafol
Production, Captan Production, Chloroneb Production, Chlorothalonil
Production, Dacthal Production, Sodium Pentachlorophenate Production,
and Tordon (tm) Acid Production. In developing the proposed PAI MACT
standard (61 FR 57602, November 10, 1997), we decided not to set MACT
for each individual source category, but to aggregate them under the
same source category. Data gathered from the PAI production industry
indicated that the process equipment, emission characteristics, and
applicable control technologies were sufficiently similar for the broad
group of sources such that it was appropriate for EPA to regulate them
under a single MACT standard.
    Today's notice updates the source category list to reflect the
subsumption of the Tetrahydrobenzaldehyde Production source category
into the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturing source category. For
more information, you should refer to a May 12, 1998 notice (63 FR
26078), which promulgated amendments to the Synthetic Organic Chemical
Manufacturing Industry NESHAP (commonly known as the Hazardous Organic
NESHAP (HON)).
    You should refer to a November 7, 1996 notice (61 FR 57602) and the
February 12, 1998 source category notice (63 FR 7155), to learn about
an anticipated listing action involving the subsumption of a number of
source categories into one source category called the ``Miscellaneous
Organic Chemical Processes'' source category. We are now considering
combining the source categories into two new source categories instead
of one. The two new source categories would be called the
``Miscellaneous Organic Chemical Processes'' source category and the
``Miscellaneous Coating Processes'' source category. The scope of the
Miscellaneous Organic Chemical Processes source category would also be
broadened to cover more organic chemical processes, in addition to the
process already listed. Each of these source categories is scheduled
for promulgation no later than November 15, 2000; thus, the two new
source categories would also be scheduled for that regulatory
timeframe. The proposal notices for those MACT standards will serve as
the official action to combine and rename the new source categories.
The public will have an opportunity to comment on actions as part of
those MACT proposals.
    We also refer the reader to a December 14, 1998 notice (63 FR
68832), which announced combining two source categories, Amino Resins
Production source category and Phenolic Resins Production source
category, into a single new source category called ``Amino/Phenolic
Resins Production'' for purposes of efficiency in rulemaking.
    Today's notice involves another anticipated action regarding the
combining of the seven categories related to cellulose production into
two source categories called, ``Cellulose Ethers Production'' and
``Miscellaneous Viscose Processes.'' We are considering the combining
of Carboxymethylcellulose Production and Cellulose Ethers Production
into the Cellulose Ethers Production. We are also considering the
combining of four existing source categories into a new source category
called, ``Miscellaneous Viscose Processes.'' This newly defined source
category would subsume the Rayon Production source category, Cellulose
Food Casing Manufacturing source category, Cellophane Production source
category, and Cellulosic Sponge Manufacturing source category. Each of
these source categories is scheduled for promulgation no later than
November 15, 2000; thus these two newly defined source categories would
also be scheduled for that regulatory timeframe. The proposal notices
for those MACT standards will serve as the official actions to combine
the source categories and to name the newly defined source categories.
The public will have the opportunity to comment on those actions as
part of the Miscellaneous Cellulose Production MACT proposal.

IV. Is This Action Subject to Judicial Review?

    The CAA section 112(e)(3) states that the determination of
priorities for promulgation of standards for the listed source
categories is not a rulemaking and is not subject to judicial review,
except that, failure to promulgate any standard pursuant to the
schedule established under section 112(e) shall be subject to review
under section 304 of the CAA. Section 112(e)(4) states that,
notwithstanding section 307 of the Act, no action of the Administrator
listing a source category or subcategory under section 112(c) shall be
a final Agency action subject to judicial review, except that any such
action may be reviewed under section 307 when the Administrator issues
emission standards

[[Page 63030]]

for such pollutant or category. Therefore, today's notice is not
subject to judicial review.

V. Is EPA Asking for Public Comment?

    Prior to issuance of the initial source category list, we published
a draft initial list for public comment (56 FR 28548, June 21, 1991).
Although we were not required to take public comment on the initial
source category list, we believed it was useful to solicit input on a
number of issues related to the list. Indeed, in most instances, even
where there is no statutory requirement to take comment, we solicit
public comments on actions we are contemplating. Section 112(e)(3)
required that we offer opportunity for public comments on the initial
source category schedule, which we published as a draft in a September
24, 1992 notice and subsequently published in final form on December 3,
1993. We have decided, however, that it is unnecessary to solicit
additional public comment on the revisions reflected in today's notice.
Where we believe it is useful to solicit input on certain actions, we
will offer interested parties an opportunity to provide comments on
proposed individual MACT standards.

VI. Administrative Requirements

    Today's notice is not a rule; it is essentially an information
sharing activity which does not impose regulatory requirements or
costs. Therefore, the requirements of Executive Order 13045 (Protection
of Children from Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks),
Executive Order 13084 (Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal
Governments), Executive Order 13132 (Federalism), the Regulatory
Flexibility Act, the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act,
and the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act do not apply to today's notice.
Also, this notice does not contain any information collection
requirements and, therefore, is not subject to the Paperwork Reduction
Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.
    Under Executive Order 12866 (<a href="http://www.epa.gov/fedrgstr/eo/eo12866.htm">58 FR 51735</a>, October 4, 1993), a
regulatory action determined to be ``significant'' is subject to OMB
review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines
``significant'' regulatory action as one that is likely to lead to a
rule that may either (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100
million or more, or adversely affect a sector of the economy,
productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or
safety, or State, local or tribal governments or communities; (2)
Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action
taken or planned by another agency; (3) Materially alter the budgetary
impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the
rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) raise novel legal
or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order.
    Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, OMB considers
today's notice a ``significant regulatory action'' within the meaning
of the Executive Order. For this reason, this action underwent review
by the OMB.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
<SUP>a</SUP> Only sources within any category located at a major source shall be
  subject to emission standards under CAA section 112 unless a finding
  is made of a threat of adverse effects to human health or the
  environment for the area sources in a category. All listed categories
  are exclusive of any specific operations or processes included under
  other categories that are listed separately.
<SUP>b</SUP> This schedule does not establish the order in which the rules for
  particular source categories will be proposed or promulgated. Rather,
  it requires that emissions standards pursuant to CAA section 112(d)
  for a given source category be promulgated by the specified date.
The markings in the ``Statutory Promulgation Date/Federal Register
  Citation'' column of Table 1 denote the following:
 (A): final amendment to a final rulemaking action
 (a): proposed amendment to a final rulemaking action
 (C): correction (or clarification) published subsequent to a proposed
  or final rulemaking action
 (F): final rulemaking action
 (N): notice to announce general information, such as an Agency
  decision, availability of new data, administrative updates, etc.
 (P): proposed rulemaking action
 (R): reopening of a proposed action for public comment
 (S): announcement of a stay, or partial stay, of the rule requirements
 Moved: the source category is relocated to a more appropriate industry
  group
 Subsumed: the source category is included within the definition of
  another listed category and therefore is no longer listed as a
  separate source category
 Renamed: the title of this source category is changed to a more
  appropriate title
 Deleted: the source category is removed from the source category list
<SUP>c</SUP> The Publicly Owned Treatment Works (POTW) Emissions source category
  had a statutory deadline for regulatory promulgation of November 15,
  1995, as established by CAA section 112(e)(5). However, for purposes
  of determining the 18-month period applicable to the POTW source
  category under section 112(j)(2), the promulgation deadline was
  November 15, 1997. This latter date is consistent with the section
  112(e) schedule for the promulgation of emissions standards, as
  published in the Federal Register on December 3, 1993 (58 FR 63941).
<SUP>d</SUP> Equipment handling specific chemicals for these categories or subsets
  of these categories is subject to a negotiated standard for equipment
  leaks contained in the Hazardous Organic NESHAP (HON), which was
  promulgated on April 22, 1994. The HON includes a negotiated standard
  for equipment leaks from the SOCMI category and 20 non-SOCMI
  categories (or subsets of these categories). The specific processes
  affected within the categories are listed in Section XX.X0(c) of the
  March 6, 1991 Federal Register notice (56 FR 9315).
<SUP>e</SUP> A finding of threat of adverse effects to human health or the
  environment was made for each category of area sources listed.
