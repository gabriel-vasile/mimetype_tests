National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants;
Revision of List of Categories of Sources and Schedule for Standards
Under Section 112 of the Clean Air Act

AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

ACTION: Notice of revisions to list of categories of major and area
sources, and revisions to promulgation schedule for standards.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: This notice publishes revisions made or which have been
proposed to the list of categories of sources of hazardous air
pollutants (HAP) and the corresponding schedule for the promulgation of
emission standards. Required under Sections 112 (c) and (e) of the
Clean Air Act, the source category list and the schedule for standards
constitute a significant part of the EPA's agenda for regulating
stationary sources of air toxics emissions. The ``list'' and
``schedule'' were most recently published in the Federal Register on
June 4, 1996 (61 FR 28197).
    Today's notice meets the requirement in Section 112(c)(1) to
publish from time to time a list of all categories of sources,
reflecting revisions since the list was published. Several of the
revisions identified in today's notice have already been published in
actions associated with listing and promulgating emission standards for
individual source categories, and public comment has already been taken
in the context of those actions. Some of the revisions in today's
notice have not been reflected in any previous notices, and are being
made without public comment on the Administrator's own motion. Such
revisions are deemed by EPA to be without need for public comment,
based on the nature of the actions. Other revisions have been only
proposed as of today's date, but are reflected nevertheless to be
inclusive of all list and schedule actions of probable interest to the
reader.

EFFECTIVE DATE: February 12, 1998.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background

    The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-549) require,
under the revisions to Section 112, that the Agency list categories of
sources emitting HAP and promulgate national emission standards for
hazardous air pollutants (NESHAP) in order to control, reduce, or
otherwise limit the emissions of HAP from such categories of major and
area sources. Pursuant to the various specific listing requirements in
Section 112(c), the Agency published on July 16, 1992 (57 FR 31576) a
list of 174 categories of major and area sources--referred to as the
``initial list''--that would be henceforth subject to emission
standards. Following this listing, pursuant to requirements in Section
112(e), on December 3, 1993 (58 FR 63941) the Agency published a
schedule for the promulgation of emission standards for each of the 174
listed source categories. The schedule for standards organized the
source categories into groups of four separate timeframes with
promulgation deadlines of November 15, 1992, November 15, 1994,
November 15, 1997, or November 15, 2000. The reader is directed to
these two notices for information relating to development of the
initial list and schedule.
    Following these publications, several list and schedule actions
were effected through publication of specific Federal Register notices.
For example, on November 12, 1993 (58 FR 60021), the Agency listed
marine vessel loading operations as a category of major sources, with
standards to be promulgated, pursuant to Section 112(c)(5), by the year
2000. As another example, on September 8, 1994 (59 FR 46339), the
Agency promulgated standards for HAP emissions for industrial process
cooling towers. This latter action did not revise the list or schedule,
per se, but specifically delineated rule applicability by defining the
affected sources within the listed category. The Agency believes that
defining rule applicability and affected sources as part of standard
setting constitutes an important aspect of list revision. As was stated
in the initial list notice (57 FR 31576):

    the Agency recognizes that these descriptions [in the initial
list], like the list itself, may be revised from time to time as
better information becomes available. The Agency intends to revise
these descriptions as part of the process of establishing standards
for each category. Ultimately, a definition of each listed category,
or subsequently listed subcategories, will be incorporated in each
rule establishing a NESHAP for a category

    As more notices were published that effected actions relating to
individual source categories, it became important to examine the
resultant change on the list and schedule. On June 4, 1996 (61 FR
28197), the EPA published a notice that referenced all previous listing
and schedule changes and consolidated those actions, along with several
new actions, into a revised source category list and schedule. A
subsequent notice was published on July 18, 1996 (61 FR 37542) which
corrected typographical errors in the June 4 notice.
    Section 112(e)(4) states that, notwithstanding Section 307 of the
Act, no action of the Administrator listing a source category or
subcategory under Section 112(c) shall be a final Agency action subject
to judicial review, except that any such action may be reviewed under
Section 307 when the Administrator issues emission standards for such
pollutant or category. Therefore, today's list is not a final Agency
action and is not subject to judicial review.
    Prior to issuance of the initial source category list, the EPA
published a draft initial list for public comment (56 FR 28548; June
21, 1991). Although the EPA was not required to take public comment on
the initial source category list, it believed it was useful to solicit
input on a number of issues related to the list. Indeed, in most
instances, even where there is no statutory requirement to take
comment, EPA solicits public comment on actions it is contemplating.
The EPA has, however, decided that it is unnecessary to solicit
additional public comment on the revisions reflected in today's notice
because interested parties have already had, or will have in the
future, the opportunity to provide comments on many of the revisions in
the context of individual actions relating to proposing and
promulgating emissions standards.

II. Description of Individual List and Schedule Revisions

    The revised source category list and regulatory schedule,
reflecting all actions up to today's date, are presented in Table 1.
This table incorporates the entire listing of source categories listed
to this date, including those listed on the initial list as well as
those listed subsequently either through a specific Federal Register
notice or the June 4, 1996 revision notice. Table 1 also includes the
updated schedule for establishing emission standards under Section 112
for the listed categories, including rule proposal or promulgation
Federal Register citations (Table 1 omits proposal notices once a rule
has been promulgated). Table 1 is formatted so that the reader can at
once see all categories of major and area sources that have been listed
to date, the associated schedule for standards and rulemaking notices,
and any revisions effected by or reflected in today's notice. Source
categories and/or schedules for standards in Table 1 that are revised
from the previous listing notices are marked (i.e., as revisions ``as
of Today'') for ease in discerning where revisions have been made.
    The following sections describe the actions that are being effected
by or reflected in this notice that are new since the June 4, 1996
publication.

A. Addition of Categories of Sources

    The Administrator is obligated to list any category of major
sources. Section 112(a) defines ``major'' source as any stationary
source or group of stationary sources, emitting or having the potential
to emit, considering controls, 10 tons per year of one HAP or 25 tons
per year of two or more HAP.
    Today's notice reflects the February 6, 1998 listing (63 FR 8288)
of a new category of major sources, Natural Gas Transmission and
Storage. This new source category is a result of dividing the initially
listed Oil and Natural Gas Production major source category into two
separate major source categories. Thus, the Oil and Natural Gas
Production source category remains on the list of categories, but part
of its original applicability is being covered by the new Natural Gas
Transmission

[[Page 7157]]

and Storage source category. Since this new category is a subset of an
originally listed major source category, it is not subject to the
scheduling requirements of Section 112(c)(5); but rather, is subject to
the November 15, 1997 deadline originally set for the Oil and Natural
Gas Production source category. The reader is referred to the above
cited Federal Register notice for more information concerning the
proposed rule applicability of these two source categories.
    An ``area'' source is a stationary source of HAP that is not a
major source. The Agency may list and regulate categories of area
sources pursuant to a number of authorities in Section 112. The
authorities are all discretionary and/or require some sort of finding
or determination by the Administrator. The Agency believes that any
such area source listing action should therefore be subject to public
comment and is consequently not being taken in today's notice.
    However, the February 6, 1998 action described above, which divides
the ``Oil and Natural Gas Production'' category into two major source
categories, also proposed to add two area source categories to the list
as part of that regulatory action. Since final action has not yet been
taken on the proposal to list these two area source categories, the
list of categories in today's notice does not reflect the addition of
these two source categories. If final action is taken to add these area
source categories to the list, that action will be reflected in future
consolidated list publications.
    The reader is also referred to a June 20, 1997 notice (62 FR 33625)
that proposes the listing of three source categories, pursuant to the
requirements of Section 112(c)(6). Once listed, these source categories
will be subject to emission standards under Section 112(d)(2) and (4)
of the Act.

B. Delineation of Standard Applicability and Affected Sources Through
Standard Promulgation

    Emission standards have been promulgated under Section 112 for
several source categories since the source category list and schedule
were last published. Table 1 identifies the Federal Register cite for
each of these notices. These actions are cited in today's notice
because they revise the list in that they delineate rule applicability
by defining the affected sources within the listed category.

C. Proposed Delineation of Standard Applicability and Affected Sources
Through Standard Proposal

    Emission standards have been proposed under Section 112 for several
source categories since the source category list and schedule were last
published. These actions are cited in today's notice as they propose to
revise the list by delineating rule applicability by defining the
affected sources within the listed category. The reader is referred to
Table 1 to obtain the Federal Register citations for these categories
of sources.

D. Subsumption of Listed Source Categories Into Other Listed Source
Categories

    Today's notice specifies one action involving subsumption of two
previously listed source categories into a single source category. The
Hydrogen Cyanide Production and Sodium Cyanide Production source
categories will be combined into a new major source category, called
Cyanide Chemicals Manufacturing. Since facilities produce sodium
cyanide and hydrogen cyanide in the same process train (i.e., using the
same or linked equipment), it is more sensible to have facilities
subject to only one rule rather than two separate rules for different
parts of their process. As a result, two source categories are
aggregated into one category without compromising the intent of the
original source category listing notice.
    The reader is also referred to a November 7, 1996 notice (61 FR
57602) to learn about an anticipated listing action involving the
subsumption of a number of source categories into one source category,
called the Miscellaneous Organic Chemical Processes source category.
Each of the anticipated subsumed categories are scheduled for standards
promulgation no later than November 15, 2000; thus, the new source
category would be also scheduled for that regulatory timeframe.
    The reader is also referred to a November 10, 1997 notice (62 FR
60566) which proposes subsumption of the eleven categories listed in
the Agricultural Chemicals Industry Group into one combined source
category, Pesticides Active Ingredients Production. The Pesticides
Active Ingredient source category is scheduled for standards
promulgation by November 15, 1997.

E. Deletion of Categories of Sources

    The Administrator may delete categories of sources on the
Administrator's own motion or on petition. One source category--Nylon 6
Production--which was previously determined to be a major source
category is being deleted from the list on the Administrator's own
motion in today's notice. A second category--Cyanuric Chloride
Production--is being deleted on the Administrator's own motion because
no major source produces cyanuric chloride as a product. Today's notice
contains no deletions of categories as a result of petition.
    The reason for deleting Nylon 6 Production is that available data
indicate that the category contains no major sources. Specifically, the
only pollutant which has ever been considered a HAP that is emitted by
the Nylon 6 production process is caprolactam. On June 18, 1996 (61 FR
30816), the Agency removed caprolactam from the Section 112(b)(1) list
of HAP. Consequently, this category emits no HAP and is therefore
removed from the list of source categories.
    The reason Cyanuric Chloride Production is being deleted is that
the EPA has determined that cyanuric chloride is an unstable
intermediate product and as such does not exist as a production
category. Therefore, it was erroneously included on the initial list of
source categories.
    This section does not include categories of sources which are being
deleted from the list by way of subsumption into other listed
categories. See Section II.D of this notice for information on these
categories.
    In the near future EPA expects to publish a notice announcing its
intent to regulate certain solid waste incineration units under Section
129 of the Act rather than Section 112. Currently, the Section 112
source category list includes some solid waste incineration units. The
source category list and schedule will be updated following
finalization of any such change. Sources expressly excluded from
regulation under Section 129(g)(1) will remain on the Section 112 list.

F. Moving Standards Promulgation Deadlines for Source Categories

    The Agency may revise the regulatory schedule for standards
associated with a listed source category, heeding the limitations in
Section 112. As was stated in the notice issuing the schedule for
standards (58 FR 63941; December 3, 1993), ``* * * as new information
comes available, the EPA may identify changes to the schedule that
would facilitate greater achievement of the prioritizing criteria of
section 112(e).''
    The December 3, 1993, notice scheduled the initially listed source

[[Page 7158]]

categories for regulation such that exactly 50 percent (87 out of 174)
were scheduled by November 15, 1997. Consequently, in order to continue
to satisfy the numerical and temporal requirements of Section
112(e)(1), any change to occur that would delay the deadline for a
source category scheduled for regulation by November 15, 1997, must be
offset by a corresponding shifting of a source category from the
November 15, 2000, regulatory timeframe forward to the November 15,
1997, timeframe.
    Today's notice effects three actions (affecting seven source
categories) whereby circumstances support a change to the schedule for
standards.
1. Reinforced Plastic Composites Production and Phosphate Fertilizers
Production
    Reinforced Plastic Composites Production is delayed from November
15, 1997, to November 15, 2000, following the determination that its
regulatory development should be conducted in parallel with that of the
Boat Manufacturing source category, which is scheduled for standards
promulgation by November 15, 2000. Correspondingly, the regulatory
schedule for the Phosphate Fertilizers Production is moved up in time,
from November 15, 2000, to November 15, 1997.
    The change of schedule for Reinforced Plastic Composites Production
will promote consistency with the development of the Boat Manufacturing
NESHAP. The applicability and recordkeeping/reporting requirements for
these standards needs to be coordinated due to an overlap in the
coverage of the source categories. In addition, moving back the
Reinforced Plastic Composites Production regulatory timeframe allows
the EPA the time it needs to carry out additional data gathering to
develop the rule. Specifically, the EPA is planning a source test
program to provide data needed for one of the subcategories of
Reinforced Plastic Composites Production.
    Because the standard for the Phosphate Fertilizers Production
Category is already proposed (61 FR 68430), it will be far ahead of its
initial regulatory deadline and therefore can be used in place of the
Reinforced Plastic Composites Production category in order to meet the
statutory requirement of completion of 50 percent of the initially
listed source categories by November 15, 1997.
2. Chlorine Production and Phosphoric Acid Manufacturing
    This notice also announces the change of schedules for the source
categories of Chlorine Production and Phosphoric Acid Manufacturing.
The schedule for Chlorine Production, which was included in the initial
source category schedule in December 1993, is being changed from
November 15, 1997, to November 15, 2000. The schedule for Phosphoric
Acid Manufacturing, published in that same notice (58 FR 63941;
December 3, 1993), is being changed from November 15, 2000, to November
15, 1997.
    Moving Chlorine Production to the 10-year bin would allow the EPA
the time it needs to carry out additional data gathering to develop the
proposal. Specifically, the Chlorine Institute and its US based mercury
cell chlor-alkali producers are voluntarily committed to attaining a 50
percent reduction in the deliberate use and release of mercury from US
based chlor-alkali facilities by the year 2005. Given the timing of
these future actions, the Agency has determined that moving Chlorine
Production into the 10-year bin is prudent to avoid requirements that
are incompatible with the voluntary reductions.
    Because the standard for the Phosphoric Acid Manufacturing category
has already been proposed, it will be far ahead of its 2000 deadline
and therefore can be used to meet the statutory requirement to complete
regulation of half the original source category list in 7 years.
3. Cyanide Chemicals Manufacturing, Marine Vessel Loading Operations,
and Secondary Lead Smelting (Area Source Category)
    This notice also announces a change of schedule for the newly
designated Cyanide Chemicals Manufacturing category and the Secondary
Lead Smelting area source category and the Marine Vessel Loading
Operations category. As noted above, the Hydrogen Cyanide Production
category and the Sodium Cyanide Production category (which have now
been combined into the Cyanide Chemicals Manufacturing category) were
scheduled for regulation by November 15, 1997. The Secondary Lead
Smelting area source category and the Marine Vessel Loading Operations
major source category were added after publication of the initial
source category list, and therefore scheduled for regulation by
November 15, 2000, pursuant to Section 112(c)(5) of the Act. Moving
forward the regulatory deadlines for these two regulated categories in
exchange for the Cyanide Chemicals Manufacturing category constitutes
an equal trade of two categories previously scheduled for November 1997
with two categories previously scheduled for November 2000.
Consequently, the requirement to regulate 50 percent of the initially
listed categories by November 15, 1997, is preserved.

G. Descriptions of Categories of Sources

    For general descriptions of source categories listed in Table 1,
the reader is referred to Docket No. A-90-49, Item No. IV-A-55 (EPA-
450/3-91-030, entitled ``Documentation for Developing the Initial
Source Category List''), and the Federal Register notice for the first
revision of the source category list and schedule (61 FR 28197; June 4,
1996). For subsequent changes to descriptions of source categories for
which a rule has been promulgated, the reader is advised to consult
Table 1 for the citation of the Federal Register notice which will
include the amended definition and corresponding rule applicability.

III. Administrative Requirements

A. Docket

    The docket for this regulatory action is A-90-49. The docket is an
organized and complete file of all the information submitted to or
otherwise considered by the Agency in the development of this revised
list of categories of sources and revised schedule for standards. The
principal purpose of this docket is to allow interested parties to
identify and locate documents that serve as a record of the process
engaged in by the Agency to publish today's revision to the initial
list and schedule. The docket is available for public inspection at the
EPA's Air and Radiation Docket and Information Center, which is listed
in the ADDRESSES section of this notice.

B. Regulatory Requirements

1. General
    Today's notice is not a rule; it is essentially an information
sharing activity which does not impose regulatory requirements or
costs. Therefore, the EPA has not prepared an assessment of the
potential costs and benefits pursuant to Executive Order 12866, nor an
economic impact analysis pursuant to Section 317, nor a regulatory
flexibility analysis pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub.
L. 96-354, September 19, 1980), nor a budgetary impact statement
pursuant to the Unfunded Mandates Act of 1995. Also, this notice does
not contain any information collection requirements and, therefore, is
not subject to the

Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.
2. Executive Order 12866 and Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
Review
    Under Executive Order 12866 (<a href="http://www.epa.gov/fedrgstr/eo/eo12866.htm">58 FR 51735</a>; October 4, 1993), the
Agency must determine whether a regulatory action is ``significant''
and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the
Executive Order. The Order defines ``significant'' regulatory action as
one that is likely to lead to a rule that may either (1) have an annual
effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and
materially affect a sector of the economy, productivity, competition,
jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local or
tribal governments or communities; (2) create a serious inconsistency
or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another
agency; (3) materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements,
grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of
recipients thereof; or (4) raise novel legal or policy issues arising
out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in the Executive Order.
    Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, it has been decided
that this is a ``significant regulatory action'' within the meaning of
the Executive Order. For this reason, this action underwent review by
the OMB.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;SUP&gt;a Only sources within any category located at a major source shall be
  subject to emission standards under Section 112 unless a finding is
  made of a threat of adverse effects to human health or the environment
  for the area sources in a category. All listed categories are
  exclusive of any specific operations or processes included under other
  categories that are listed separately.
&lt;SUP&gt;b This schedule does not establish the order in which the rules for
  particular source categories will be proposed or promulgated. Rather,
  it requires that emissions standards pursuant to Section 112(d) for a
  given source category be promulgated by the specified date.
The markings in the ``Promulgation Date/Federal Register Citation''
  column of Table 1 denote the following:
(A): final amendment to a final rulemaking action.
(a): proposed amendment to a final rulemaking action.
(C): correction (or clarification) published subsequent to a proposed or
  final rulemaking action.
(F): final rulemaking action.
(N): notice to announce general information, such as an agency decision,
  availability of new data, administrative updates, etc.
(P): proposed rulemaking action.
(R): reopening of a proposed action for public comment.
(S): announcement of a stay, or partial stay, of the rule requirements.
Moved: the source category is relocated to a more appropriate industry
  group.
Subsumed: the source category is included within the definition of
  another listed category and therefore is no longer listed as a
  separate source category.
Renamed: the title of this source category is changed to a more
  appropriate title.
Deleted: the source category is officially removed from the source
  category list.
&lt;SUP&gt;c Sources defined as electric utility steam generating units under
  Section 112(a)(8) shall not be subject to emission standards pending
  the findings of the study required under Section 112(n)(1).
&lt;SUP&gt;d The Publicly Owned Treatment Works (POTW) Emissions source category
  has a statutory deadline for regulatory promulgation of November 15,
  1995, as established by Section 112(e)(5) of the Clean Air Act.
  However, for purposes of determining the 18 month period applicable to
  the POTW source category under Section 112(j)(2), the promulgation
  deadline is November 15, 1997. This latter date is consistent with the
  Section 112(e) schedule for the promulgation of emissions standards,
  as published in the Federal Register on December 3, 1993 (58 FR
  63941).
&lt;SUP&gt;e Equipment handling specific chemicals for these categories or subsets
  of these categories are subject to a negotiated standard for equipment
  leaks contained in the Hazardous Organic NESHAP (HON), which was
  promulgated on April 22, 1994. The HON includes a negotiated standard
  for equipment leaks from the SOCMI category and 20 non-SOCMI
  categories (or subsets of these categories). The specific processes
  affected within the categories are listed in Section XX.X0(c) of the
  March 6, 1991 Federal Register notice (56 FR 9315).
&lt;SUP&gt;f A finding of threat of adverse effects to human health or the
  environment was made for each category of area sources listed.
