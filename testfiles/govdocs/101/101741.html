One can findin that part of his book various clearly stated and inspiring ideas concerningunity of science and the program of reduction of scientific theories tothe more fundamental ones, eventually to physics. In a very sober way Bialkowskidiscusses some traps of the reductionist program, clearly defines threenotions of reduction, and undertakes several other points of considerablemethodological significance. Grzegorz Bialkowski was one of the eminentPolish physicists. Till his death in 1990, he was the Rector of the WarsawUniversity. The book whose fragment is to be discussed was published inPolish.

Steven Weinberg defendsthe, what he calls, deep reductionism en collects arguments to show thatthis deep reductionist is the most important and fruitful of scientificmethodologies. Steven Weinberg is Nobel Price of Physics and author ofthe celebrated &quot;The First Three Minutes'.

Perhaps now, better than atthe beginning, we are able to understand and appreciate what physics is.The time is ripe for a summary. It cannot be an inventory of achievementsof this discipline, for this would require writing this book anew. I wantto dwell on the role that physics plays in our cognitive system as a whole.In one of the introductory chapters of the first volume of this book, Ihave already mentioned expansionism, the insatiability of physics, by whichfrom the very beginning physics entered more and more vigorously onto thedomains explored by other natural sciences. The beginning of physics isthe beginning of that process. Thus, the old Aristotelian physics dividedthe Universe onto two essentially different parts. To abolish that view,it was necessary to show the identity of laws as well as the congruityof phenomena taking place in the two fundamental parts of the AristotelianUniverse separated by the sphere of the Moon.</P><P>That was the task undertaken primarily by Mechanics. The observationsof eminent and reliable Renaissance astronomers, such as Tycho de Brahe,Pavel Heinzel and Elias Camerarius allowed Kepler to formulate phenomenologicallaws which, in turn, open the way to the Newtonian gravitation theory.That was the first great triumph of physics and one may wonder if its essenceis not the subsumption of a great part of astronomy to physics. One shouldnot think that the &quot;intrusion&quot; of physics into the world of astronomytook place only in mechanics. It suffices to read in Galileo's dialoguedescription of (entirely earthly) experiments that serve to demonstrateto Simplicio that the Moon by no means is a polished crystal ball as wasstubbornly maintained by Middle Age Aristotelians but that its surfaceis coarse, full of clods that disperse rather than reflect light. Whata wonderful observation and proof (not to be ignored) that a mirror placedon a white coarse wall will be perceived as darker not as lighter thanthe wall, unless it just casts on us a sheaf of reflected light.</P><P>The principle of unity of matter explicitly formulated by Giordano Bruno,but intuitively shared by many, plays here the key role. Presenting theparts of his &quot;Cena de le Cenari&quot; (&quot;The Ash Wednesday Supper&quot;)Bruno wrote: </P><UL><P>The fourth demonstrates that the constituents of matter of the Earthare the same as that of other worlds which are the bodies of other starsand hence it is childish to be of another opinion.</P></UL><P>Thus, according to Bruno, there are no such two different elements as&quot;earthness&quot; and &quot;heavenness&quot; but all over the universethe matter is the same. Only the discoveries of Fraunhofer, Kirchoff andothers, who were able to demonstrate that the atmosphere of the Sun (aswell as other stars) contain the same elements as those present on Earth,provided full observational confirmation of Bruno's cosmological principle.Bruno himself had almost no evidential support for his principle. Rightlythen, still in the nineteenth century, Comte could maintain that the chemicalcomposition of heavenly bodies will remain for humans an enigma forever.Rightly, because at that time there were no signs of any possibility whatsoeverto approach that problem and the mind set of positivists did not go farbeyond the facts then available. But, at the same time, this demonstratesthe narrowness of positivism. As Weinberg has pointed out in his beautifulbook &quot;The first three minutes&quot; the fully objectivist approachmay not be the best receipe for developments of science. It may pay toignore doubts and follow the conclusions from once accepted premises, regardlessof where they lead us.</P><P>On the other hand, observations of the spectra of stars and star cloudscontributed to the development of physics by providing it with new experimentaldata. One of them was the discovery of helium with the help of spectroscopy,first in the photosphere of the Sun and only later on Earth (that explainsthe origin of the term &quot;helium&quot; -a Sun element). Throughout thelast centuries and decades it has become more and more obvious that theuniverse is a physical laboratory of sorts. The phases of matter one maydiscover in the Cosmos may not be easy to produce on Earth. Besides, thevery scale of the phenomena taking place in the Cosmos allows us to observehow they are influenced by the gravitational field, whose role can be rightlyappreciated in those circumstances. Surely, only someone who knows thesecrets of &quot;m&eacute;tier&quot;, who is acquainted with the rightexperimental techniques, is able to reach information from that laboratory,to formulate reliable interrelations and to interpret them in a correctway. The same is true in nuclear physics or in the physics of rigid bodies;also their development requires the right methodology. Astronomy has becomephysics of cosmic entities. Thus, the universality of physical laws indeedextends to the whole universe.</P><P>In order to acknowledge the unity of the universe, one has had to learnthe laws that govern large scale natural phenomena taking place on ourglob in its atmosphere, hydrosphere and lithosphere. One could not forevertrust to Zeus the responsibility for tempests, Poseidon for sea currentsand Hades for volcanoes. The investigations started at a time difficultto reconstruct. When William Gilbert published his treatise on magnets,part of his concern was the Earth's magnetism already known for a for longtime. Soon, Benjamin Franklin explained the nature of tempests. Since thattime several centuries have passed and somebody, who reads about eitheran unexpected earthquake or tornado or -- on a less dramatic scale -- onewho is disappointed that the weather forecast has turned out to be wrongonce more, may not realize how great a progress was made in learning thosephenomena and how complex they are. Our inability to forecast geophysicalphenomena is caused by numerous factors; in the first place our poor knowledgeof such processes as the formation of clouds or the influence of the stateof the ionosphere on atmospheric phenomena etc. On the other hand, we donot have a sufficiently precise data base system on both the present andpast geophysical events on the global scale, which is partially due toour incomplete knowledge of the origin and evolution of our planet. Thirdly,at last, one may be afraid that if one were able to make use of both therelevant general laws and the necessary information about the initial andboundary conditions (such as e.g. the activity of the Sun and the intensityand composition of cosmic radiation) it would turn out that the resultingsystem of equations is extremely complicated. It will not be easy to tellfrom all the factors it includes, those which are more and which are lessimportant. What is worse, the actual course of events may possibly dependon some allegedly inessential disturbing factors (e.g. the shape of theseashore line, an eruption of a volcano or a huge forest fire). Instabilityof solutions caused by small, on average inessential, disturbances whichnevertheless affect the concrete singular course of events may result inruling out any possibility of any forecasts other than statistical. Butthat was a digression. One way or another, nobody doubts that the onlyway to learn the large scale processes characteristic of our planet isto apply the laws of physics to our environment which is still unknowneven though it is so close to us.</P><P>The advance of electrodynamics, and especially quantum mechanics hasopened entirely new perspectives for physics. I have already mentioned,that the progress of physics has allowed us to understand many phenomenaand techniques of fundamental significance for chemistry such as electrolyticdissociation, diffusion, transformation of phases of matter, or the structureof molecules. Still, the basic achievement is accounting for the natureof valence and chemical binding. At present, the theory of the hydrogenmolecule is so advanced that there is no doubt that we understand thisquantum system quite well. And, apart from some specific methods of calculations,what makes it possible are in principle only Coulomb's law, Schr&ouml;dinger'sequation and Pauli's exclusion principle. Of course, the greater the numberof bodies that participate in a specific phenomenon the more complex isthe task of accounting for that phenomenon. Thus for instance the propertiesof lithium are more intelligible than those of lead or californium. Forthe same reason we understand the molecule of hydrogen better than thatof water and the latter better than the protein molecule of any specifickind. However, one should not expect to discover in chemistry, at leastnot in its foundational part, any laws characteristic for this disciplineonly, all these laws are derivable from the basic properties of matter.In principle, the laws of physics suffice to explain the structure of chemicalsubstances and the kinetics of chemical reactions, even though, in practice,we may not be able to derive that structure from the basic laws. However,nobody seeks to explains the motion of water running from an outlet byresorting to the general laws of hydrodynamics and still nobody doubts,that these laws account for the characteristic of that motion.</P><P>Going towards still more complicated structures, we encounter livingcreatures and their parts. This area is covered by biological investigations.The role of physics has considerably increased also here. The relevanceof physics for the traditional biological disciplines of descriptive andtaxonomic nature is small. Physics can say a little about ecological problemseither. But the domains formed more recently, genetics in the first placeand, to a fairly large extent, also physiology are more and more penetratedby physics. Indirectly, that results in its growing significance for medicineand psychology, regardless of whether the psychological issues are approachedby examining physiological phenomena underlying human psyche or in theway typical for be- haviorism.</P><P>One may ask what are both the general reasons and symptoms of that expansionof physics. I see several.</P><P>To begin with, physics supplies all the other natural sciences withboth the most general and the most basic laws of nature, thus serving astheir foundations. One cannot imagine any theory of living organisms withoutthermodynamic, theory of vision without both optics and knowledge aboutabsorption of light by matter. One cannot imagine accounting for the processesof polymerization without knowledge of intermolecular forces. With qualificationsdefined by physics itself, those basic and general laws of physics arevalid always and all over. </P><P>Another reason for the growing significance of physics for the naturalsciences is undoubtedly the fact that it serves as an attractive methodologicalpattern. Throughout the short period of its &quot;scientific stage&quot;,physics has made progress so huge and so unquestioned that it is only naturalto conjecture that this success may somehow be linked to the method ofinquiry adopted in physics. This method consists in: a combination of atomisticanalysis with the empiricist resort to reality, a presentation of theseresults in quantified form, and, finally, rational argumentation and generalizations.The quantitative nature of physics is especially appealing to ones imaginationand it is most often adopted in other branches of science. In a way moreor less cognizant and more or less justified by both the nature and theachieved stage of a given discipline, the natural sciences seek to followthe pattern of physics.</P><P>The above leads to the third reason for proliferation of physics toother disciplines, but seemingly more 'technical' and less important thanthe others. In their search for quantitative laws, natural sciences mustresort to measurement. But all the measuring instruments are operatingon the base of physical laws and measure physical quantities. The number,the outcome of measurement, not just that of counting elements (say allthe animals within a certain region), is in natural science a physicalquantity. Still, quite understandably, for the researcher in specific naturaldiscipline other than physics, it is not a physical quantity that is measured.Rather, the quantity in questions is merely a measure of a phenomenon characteristicof his own discipline. Nevertheless, if, say, one applies an encephalogramto examine the electric activity of the brain, one actually measures somephysical magnitude. If one carries out the spectral analysis of a samplein order to learn its chemical composition one again measures some physicalquantity. One may say that for natural sciences physics is a gateway tothe world of quantitative laws.</P><P>There is an important consequence of the above fact. Since every measurementis a measurement of a physical quantity, that quantity becomes a factorof quantitative analyses, and consequently, as one may expect, resultsin tendency to translate terms characteristic of specific natural sciencesinto the language of physics. This language is the language one must applywhen one executes measurements. Obviously, it would be a mistake to thinkthat since there is such a translation the phenomena explored by a givendiscipline entirely reduce to physical ones. One should not confuse semanticand ontological issues. Nevertheless, the temptation toward identifyingthe examined phenomena with some physical ones will surely manifest itself,if not otherwise then as a tendency toward revealing complementarity ofcognition in the relevant disciplines. It is difficult to say what mightbe the final outcome of that process.</P><P>Does physics have any chance to become a universal science in whichall the other natural disciplines will dissolve? Such a program of physicalisationand reductionism has its own partisans and representatives, but it alsohas its declared enemies. It was advocated in a very strong way by therepresentatives of neopositivism who promoted the idea of &quot;unifiedscience&quot;. But on this issue, I believe, one should preserve a soberskepticism.</P><P>It is worth dwelling for a while on what it means to reduce one scientificdiscipline to another. The ambiguity of the idea may result in confusion.One of the possible explications is the following. Imagine two scienceswirology and femology. The latter can be reduced to the former, if, firstly,all its terms can be uniquely assigned to some terms of wirology. and,secondly, the laws of femology translated in this well defined way becomelaws of wirology. If this is the case, one is entitled to say that femologyis a branch of wirology, even though, for some historical and perhaps accidentalreasons it has been stated in a separate language. If one does not wantto go that far, one may maintain that femology provides wirology with aspecific interpretation of some of its laws which may happen to be useful.</P><P>This is how geometry and algebra are linked. After the invention byDescartes of the analytic method, the notions and the laws of geometrybecame notions and laws of algebra. For instance, instead of using thenotion of a circle one may use the equation of a circle; a point becomesan ordered set of three numbers (or n numbers in a n-dimensional space).The reader is surely aware that such links between different branches ofscience are not what we are interested in. Reduction of the kind we havediscussed is lacking in something essential, namely in accounting for theproperties of the whole by the properties of its constituents. It can becalled logical reduction, and we have in mind one that can be called atomistic.</P><P>Let me start with a commonplace. Any whole, unless it is a set of elementsindependent from one another (actually, to some extent also in this case),has some properties which are not those of its components. The strongerthe dynamical constraints among the elements the more distinct are theproperties of the whole they form. About no molecule of water can one saythat it is liquid, about no atom of oxygen and no atom of hydrogen combinedin a molecule can one say that they have an electric dipole moment, aboutno electron or proton of an atom can one say that they are electricallyneutral and that their dimension is of order 10<SUP>-10</SUP>m. Actually,the fact that combining parts into a whole always results in the emergenceof some new properties is known from everyday experience and does not needappeal to the laws of the microworld. But what does it mean to explainthe properties of a whole by the properties of its parts?</P><P>Let us consider a very simple example: an atom of hydrogen. The lightestatom of hydrogen has a single proton as its nucleus, while the nuclei ofheavy hydrogen, deuterium, consist of one proton and one neutron. In orderto form a theory of the hydrogen atom we have to know the relevant generallaws of physics, in this case those of quantum mechanics. This will notsuffice, however. One has to specify which isotope of hydrogen is to beexamined, for the pattern of the energy spectrum depends on the mass ofthe nucleus, on its spin, magnetic momentum and on other properties. Inother words the theory of the hydrogen atom presupposes familiarity withboth general laws of physics and properties of parts of the atom. One mayalso state this claim in somewhat converted form as follows. In order todetermine the properties of the whole one has to know not only the propertiesof its parts but also the general laws of physics which are independentof those properties. The same applies to a molecule of hydrogen. Besidesthe relevant properties of singular atoms, we have to know laws of physicsin order to know that the molecule will perform some rotations in spaceand some oscillations along the axis linking the two atoms. The physicallaws in question do not apply to single atoms! In general, the course ofa phenomenon is not determined by physical laws only or by the &quot;fabricdata&quot; only. In many cases the situation is still more complex, foran essential role can be played by either the initial conditions or eventhe whole history of the system (the history is essential already for phenomenasuch as ferromagnetism). This role can also be played by the boundary conditionswhich determine the behavior of the system in its environment. For instance,in order to form a theory of the hydrogen atom, if we want the atom tobe stable, we must request that its electron is not able to separate tounlimited distance unless it is supplied with additional energy not lowerthan the energy of ionization.</P><P>We are now approaching the gist of the matter. The presently known lawsof physics do not determine all those conditions in which they are applied.For instance, neither the value of mass nor that of charge of an electronfollow from the law of physics. Perhaps -- in accordance with Mach's principle-- if the number of protons (more generally if the distribution of mass)were different, the electron's mass would also be different. The key questionis then whether and to what extent the laws of physics determine the universeconsistent with them. Is the universe in which we live the only possibleuniverse? Would it be possible, preserving the laws of the universe, tochange, if not arbitrarily then almost arbitrarily, the data concerningthe fabric of a system, and its initial and boundary conditions. Todaywe cannot answer these questions. </P><P>The situation then is as follows. One can say about femology that itis reducible to wirology in the atomistic sense of the word if (a) thelaws of wirology suffice to fully account for the properties of the elementsof femological systems, (b) by resorting to the laws of wirology one isable to account for the behavior of femological systems sufficiently well.Thus, whatever is specific for femology becomes stated as a class of conditionsthat tell us how laws of wirology should be applied. The atomistic reductionwould have a chance to be tantamount to logistic reduction only if ouruniverse, ruled by the laws of wirology, were the only possible universe.</P><P>Let us ask then whether there is any chance to prove feasibility ofthe doctrine of atomistic reduction for natural science as a whole. I amafraid, that task encounters two obstacles.</P><P>The first one is perhaps purely technical. The complexity of systemsone has to examine when one moves from physics to chemistry is so greatthat it is practically impossible to perform the calculations which couldrender the ultimate proof of reducibility of chemical phenomena to physicalones. This state of affairs, even more acute in the case of biology, haveforced the two disciplines to invent various phenomenological models whichdescribe phenomena they examine in a sufficiently adequate way, but withoutreducing them to any elementary events. It does not mean that those modelscan never be stated in physical terms -- that may happen -- but if it doesmean, the models may still be detached from the prime principles of physics.For instance, I can imagine that someday the behavior of a cell will bedescribed by an equation stated in terms of thermodynamic, electrodynamicsand mechanics in a way consistent with the theory of chemical transformations.However, I hardly can imagine that such an equation can be derived fromthe basic physical laws.</P><P>In this way, we arrive at a type of reduction of a somewhat less restrictivekind which can be called semantic. In this case femology has its own lawswhose reduction to atomistic laws of wirology remains an open questionbut the laws of femology can be fully for- mulated in the language of wirology.If so, the relation of femology to wirology would resemble that of an islandto the continent which are not linked (perhaps temporarily only) by anyisthmus.</P><P>Most likely, however, even a reduction of the above kind will not alwaysbe possible. In order to meet any doubt, let me discuss an example drawnfrom physics. As I have already noticed in chapter 11 of vol. 1, one ofthe still open problems is the derivation of the laws of behavior of complexesformed from many molecules (atoms) from the laws of behavior of atoms.In other words, the problem that remains open is that of basing statisticalphysics on mechanics. Still we know how to translate thermodynamical termsinto mechanical terms. For instance, as was proved, temperature correspondsto the average kinetic energy of the molecule. This fact is fairly recent,for it was established about 130 years ago. Could one imagine that thermodynamicswas part of physics before it was discovered? The answer must be 'yes'.But why? I believe this for two reasons. Firstly, up to some technicaldetails, the methodology of thermodynamical investigations was the sameas that of mechanics: measurements, equations, atomistic reasoning ( inthermodynamics one can examine and one does examine the properties of systemsby examining the properties of subsystems), etc. Secondly, it was commonlytaken for granted that there were no thermodynamical phenomena which couldnot be examined without going beyond standard physical methodology. True,the theory of caloric was a very special physical theory, but the researchersdealing with it could and should apply the same methods as were appliedin other domains of physics. Thus, reduction of perhaps a less restrictivekind is methodological reduction, the one which take place when it turnsout that femological investigations can be carried out by appealing toexactly the same methodology as applied in wirology.</P><P>I guess that various misconceptions of reductionism may result eitherfrom confusing various notions of reduction or from the view that the hierarchyof those notions serves merely to indicate the direction of successivetransformations in science which must lead from lower to higher forms ofreduction , i.e. from methodological via semantic and logical up to atomistic.But such transformations need not exist.</P><P>There is another difficulty I can see, perhaps hypothetical only, whichmay impede the reductionist program. In order to make my view easier tofollow, I shall use a fairly realistic example. For students of the structureof the atomic nucleus, the deuteron -- a two nucleons system -- has beena paradigmatic case. Since there were thousands of papers on deuteriumpublished, it is reasonable to believe that the deuteron structure is wellknown. That structure can be explained by admitting forces of a specialkind acting between the two nucleons. It seems evident that the knowledgeof the interactions between the two nucleons can be expanded to the caseof three nucleons. There are two nuclei consisting of three nucleons: tritium,i.e. H<SUP>3</SUP><SUB>1</SUB> and He<SUP>3</SUP><SUB>2</SUB>. Unfortunately,physics has not been able to develop a conclusive theory of these nuclei.One of the reasons has been insufficient knowledge about the forces actingin such systems. One does not know whether forces acting among the threecomponents of those nuclei are tantamount to the forces acting betweenall the three pairs of nucleons (the nucleons A and B, B and C, and C andA)? Or perhaps there are some additional forces which engage all threeparticles A, B and C at the same time? The point is that one cannot learn3 body forces by analyzing two-nucleon systems; even our excellent knowledgeof the deuteron is irrelevant here, because those forces -- if any -- haveno chance to manifest themselves in such a system.</P><P>One may suggest a still simpler, though less 'clean' example. If oneexamines the deuteron from the point of view of its inner construction,one is able to see only nuclear forces. In that case the proton's chargeis irrelevant, even though one knows that in a system such as an atom ofdeuterium the proton can be active electromagnetically. But to demonstratethat, one must make the system more complex.</P><P>Looking at the things from a somewhat more general perspective, we seethat it is conceivable that some tiny elements of matter are capable ofinteractions which may take place if and only if those elements becomeconstituents of a sufficiently complex structure. Please note, that thisis no 'revitalization of vitalism'; no rejection of atomistic, or evensemantic reduction is intended. The potential abilities in question aresupposed to be part of the characteristic of elements of matter and itsuffices to combine those elements (which, in principle, should be feasible)in order for those properties to automatically reveal themselves. Sinceour investigations of simpler structure do not allow us to learn anythingabout those abilities, our dealing with more complex structures resultsin discovering some qualities characteristic of the latter that are neitherpresent nor reducible to the qualities of simpler structures. Personally,I do not think that anything in chemistry or biology suggests that we chanceto encounter the above situation. Still I have mentioned that perhaps onlytheoretical possibility because it should certainly not be ignored.</P><P>I would summarize the situation as follows. Attractive as it is forthe uniformity of its vision, the program of physicalization of naturalsciences may not be, and most likely will never be, feasible. It will notbe feasible for technical but presumably (with various question marks)also substantial reasons. If so, the significance of physics for othernatural sciences will keep growing but the latter will never completelyloose their independence.</P><P>A separate issue is the relation between physics and the social sciencesand humanities. It seems to me that the differences between these two kindof scientific investigations are rather essential. Needless to say, likephysics, also human and social sciences seek to learn facts in a reliableway. The facts are than separated, and one looks for the most significantamong them, singles them out and leaves the remaining ones aside. Takinginto account the facts of special significance, one looks for regularitieswhich account, at least in a rough way, for the examined processes andtheir outcomes. Going deeper into the structure of non-natural scienceswe notice various new elements. To begin with, one becomes struck by themultiparametricity of phenomena (which is considerably greater than evenin geophysics). The number of variables which &quot;a priori&quot; areto be taken into account is enormous. The characteristics of soil and climate,of the hydrological system, demographic and economical factors, the endowment(of both biological and social nature) of the inhabitants occupying theexamined region, the relevance of tradition and of socially accepted systemsof values, such evasive factors as the sense of social discipline included,and finally the capaci- ties and achievements of eminent promoters of bothculture and history of the community, supplemented perhaps by some elementsof their individual biographies... Which of all of these variables deserveto be focused upon and taken into account? Which should be the criteriaapplied for deciding the question? In natural sciences we know how to settlethis issue. We examine many copies of the same system, change the variablewhich we suspect to be of greater significance than the others and observethe outcome. But this is possible neither in social nor in human sciences.They, especially the latter, deal with unique systems with no copies available.There was only one Adam Mickiewicz, only one Poland, and as we are moreand more inclined to believe, only one human civilization. So, we cannotas easily experiment with them as with the objects examined by naturalsciences. But suppose, we can do that. Then, it will turn out that thereare some other features which make social sciences and humanities differentfrom natural science. There is no doubt that social consciousness is oneof factors that determines social behavior. On the other hand social andhuman sciences are part of that consciousness. In other words those sciencesare kind of social introspection. But reliability of introspection as aresearch method of psychology is questioned. One argues that one cannotbe aware of a process taking place in one's mind without affecting it.For similar reason social sciences can be a source of self-confirming hypothesesand forecasts.</P><P>The unique character of a phenomenon does not exclude a statisticalapproach. For instance, each family is different from any other. Still,one may estimate how many families have such and such income, how manyof them end in divorce, etc. Obviously, investigations of that kind areof considerable significance. Quite often, however, it is not a statisticalregularity but a specific singular course of events which matters for us.Geophysics is able to tell the average temperature in July, but when planningmy vacations I want to know the July temperature in a more exact way. Asociologist may tell me that, say, 10% of marriages end in divorce everyyear, but I may want to know the chances of divorce of my own marriagewithin the next ten years. Statistics smoothes out all the inputs from'accidental' factors whose appearance result in in- stability of individualevents. But we are often concerned with exactly those individual eventsfor they matter for us especially.</P><P>Finally, here in the last and perhaps the most important point. Theworld of social sciences and humanities is the human world and the humanworld is the world of values. In natural sciences values, even economical,are left aside. The only value sought to be imple- mented is epistemicvalue, that is truth. On the other hand, in social sciences the role ofvalues is enormous. Even the issues to be examined depends on the acceptedsystems of values. That explains why, Mickiewicz has attracted many morestudies than other poets considered to be of secondary significance. Also,this fact directly affects the process of investigations, the researcheris forced to accommodate himself to the socially accepted hierarchy ofvalues in the community to which (s)he belongs.</P><P>Obviously, one may try to apply the reductionist approach to a valuesystem and seek to explain it by biological factors. The deepest one (eventhough unpleasant) attempt of the kind is sociobiology. The proponentsof this approach claim that the behavior of all the organisms, and thesocial interdependencies among them are completely determined by their(one may say -- blind) will of survival and reproduction. There are severalthings, partially related to our previous discussion on reductionism, whichare to be said on this topic. It seems entirely obvious that the geneticmaterial alone does not fully determine the fate and the development ofan organism. The crop from a properly fertilized lot will be larger thanthat from a lot left idle. The 'gene mechanics' must then take into accountall the relevant biological matter as well as initial and boundary conditions.And, what are those conditions in the case of humans? Presumably we allagree that for each person, one of the most important factors are the person'spast history, the environment in which (s)he both have been raised andis being raised (for this process never ends) and eventually the stageof the person's consciousness, moral consciousness in particular, determinedby those factors. Is there any room left for free will? How to act is quitea different question. But the elements of consciousness of both privateneeds and socially accepted rules of behavior should necessarily be takeninto account as part of those conditions which are relevant for the behaviorof a given person. On many occasions, genetic considerations determineonly the likelihood of the appearance of a specific trait in the phenotype.If even the size of people is not fully determined genetically (for ifit were otherwise, we would not be able to understand why from generationto generation people are taller), then, to even a larger degree, this appliesto intellectual faculties of humans and their systems of beliefs.</P><P>Incidentally, the idea to explain human behavior in purely biologicalterms (even though its fruitfulness is beyond any doubt) leaves many questionsunanswered. The most important one is why (since the genetic material ofhumans is essen- tially the same throughout many centuries) the patternsof both behavior and of life evolve within the same or even shorter spansof time so quickly. One may suspect that sociobiology is of a scientificnature only to some extent, being at the same time a certain research programand a certain ideology.</P><P>Since, as one may guess, any road from physics to the human world mustlead through biology, and the conjecture that biology will eventually beable to account for social phenomena seems to be very unlikely, one shouldbe that much skeptical of the role of physics in this context. The processof physicalisation will stop at that juncture where physiology of the brainand that of the neurological system changes into psychology. </P><P><HR WIDTH="100%"></P><H1><A NAME="REDUX"></A>REDUCTIONISM REDUX</H1><H2>Steven Weinberg</H2><PRE>  NATURE'S IMAGINATION:  THE FRONTIERS OF SCIENTIFIC VISION  edited by John Cornwell,  introduction by Freeman Dyson,  Oxford University Press,  212 pp., 23.00USD</PRE><P>It used to be traditional for college courses on the history of philosophyto begin around 600 BC with Thales of Miletus. According to later writers,Thales taught that everything is made of water. Learning about Thales,undergraduates had the healthy experience of starting their study of philosophywith a doctrine that they knew to be false.</P><P>Though wrong. Thales and his pre-Socratic successors were not just beingsilly. They had somehow come upon the idea that it might be possible toexplain a great many complicated things on the basis of some simple anduniversal principle - everything is made of water, or everything is madeof atoms, or everything is in flux, or nothing ever changes, or whatever.Not much progress could be made with such purely qualitative ideas. Overtwo thousand years later Isaac Newton at last proposed mathematical lawsof motion and gravitation, with which he could explain the motion of theplanets, tides, and falling apples. Then in the &quot; Opticks &quot;,he predicted that light and chemistry would someday be understood &quot;by the same kind of reasoning as for mechanical principles&quot;, appliedto &quot; the smallest particles of nature&quot;.</P><P>By the end of the nineteenth century physicists and chemists had succeededin explaining much of what was known about chemistry and heat, on the basisof certain assumed properties of some ninety types of atoms - hydrogenatoms, carbon atoms, iron atoms, and so on. In the 1920s physicists beganto be able to explain the properties of atoms and other things like radioactivityand light, using a new universal theory known as quantum mechanics. Thefundamental entities to which this theory was applied were no longer theatoms themselves but particles even more elementary than atoms - electrons,protons, and a few others - together with fields of force that surroundthem , like the familiar fields that surround magnets or electric charges.</P><P>By the mid-1970s it had become clear that the properties of these particlesand all other known particles could be understood as mathematical consequencesof a fairly simple quantum theory, known as the &quot;standard model &quot;.The fundamental equations of the standard model do not deal with particlesand fields, but with fields of force alone; particles are just bundlesof field energy. From Newton's time to our own we have seen a steady expansionof the range of phenomena that we know how to explain, and a steady improvementin the simplicity and universality of the theories used in these explanations.</P><P>Science in this style is properly called reductionist. In a recent articlein these pages (1) Freeman Dyson described reductionism in physics as theeffort &quot;to reduce the world of physical phenomena to a finite setof fundamental equations&quot;. I might quibble over whether it is equationsor principles that are being sought, but it seems to me that in this descriptionDyson has caught the essence of reductionism pretty well. He also citethe work of Schroedinger and Dirac on quantum mechanics in 1925 and 1927as &quot;triumphs of reductionism. Bewildering complexities of chemistryand physics were reduced to two lines of algebraic symbols&quot;.</P><P>You might have thought that these illustrious precedents would inspirea general feeling of enthusiasm about the reductionist style of scientificresearch. Far from it. Many science kibitzers and some scientists todayspeak of reductionism with a sneer, like postmodernists talking about modernismor historians about Whig historiography. In 1992 John Cornwell, the directorof a project at Jesus College, Cambridge, on the sociology of science,convened a group of well-known scientists and philosophers to meet thereto discuss reductionism. It was at this symposium that Dyson gave the talkon which his eloquent NEW YORK REVIEW article was based. The collectedpapers of this symposium, NATURE'S IMAGINATION(2), contains articles withtitles such as &quot;Must mathematical physics be reductionist?&quot; (RogerPenrose), &quot;Reductive megalomania&quot; (Mary Midgley), and &quot;Memoryand the individual soul: against silly reductionism&quot; (Gerald Edelman).A review of this book by the mathematician John Casti, in NATURE, callsthese the &quot;good guys in the white hats&quot; as opposed to the unreconstructedreductionists at the meeting like the chemist Peter Atkins and the astronomerJohn Barrow.</P><P>Casti is a fellow of the Santa Fe Institute, a haven for non-reductionistscience. Dyson himself remarks that he has a &quot;low opinion&quot; ofreductionism. (Coming from Dyson, this really hurts. He played a majorrole in the development of quantum field theory, which has been the basisof the reduction of all of elementary particle physics to the standardmodel.) What has gone wrong? How has one of the great themes in intellectualhistory become so disreputable?</P><P>One of the problems is a confusion about what reductionism is. We oughtfirst of all to distinguish between what (to borrow the language of criminallaw) I like to call grand and petty reductionism. Grand reductionism iswhat I have been talking about so far - the view that all of nature isthe way it is (with certain qualifications about initial conditions andhistorical accidents) because of simple universal laws, to which all otherscientific laws may in some sense be reduced. Petty reductionism is themuch less interesting doctrine that things behave the way they do becauseof the properties of their constituents: for instance, a diamond is hardbecause the carbon atoms of which it is composed can fit together neatly.Grand and petty reductionism(3) are often confused because much of thereductive progress in science has been in answering questions about whatthings are made of, but the one is very different from the other.</P><P>Petty reductionism is not worth a fierce defense. Sometimes things canbe explained by studying their constituents - sometimes not. When Einsteinexplained Newton's theories of motion and gravitation, he was not committingpetty reductionism. His explanation was not based on some theory aboutthe constituents of anything, but rather on a new physical principle, thegeneral principle of relativity, which is embodied in his theory of curvedspacetime. In fact, petty reductionism in physics has probably run itscourse. Just as it doesn't make sense to talk about the hardness or temperatureor intelligence of individual &quot;elementary&quot; particles, it is alsonot possible to give a precise meaning to statements about particles beingcomposed of other particles. We do speak loosely of a proton as being composedof three quarks, but if you look very closely at a quark you will findit surrounded with a cloud of quarks and antiquarks and other particles,occasionally bound into protons; so at least for a brief moment we couldsay that the quark is made of protons. It is grand reductionism ratherthan petty reductionism that continues to be worth arguing about.</P><P>Then there is another distinction, one that almost no one mentions,between reductionism as a program for scientific research and reductionismas a view of nature. For instance, the reductionist view emphasizes thatthe weather behaves the way it does because of the general principles ofaerodynamics, radiation flow, and so on (as well as historical accidentslike the size and orbit of the earth), but in order to predict the weathertomorrow it may be more useful to think about cold fronts and thunderstorms.Reductionism may or may not be a good guide for a program of weather forecasting,but it provides the necessary insight that there are not autonomous lawsof weather that are logically independent of the principles of physics.Whether or ot it helps the meteorologist to keep it in mind, cold frontsare the way they are because of the properties of air and water vapor andso on which in turn are the way they are because of the principles of chemistryand physics. We don't know the final laws of nature, but we know that theyare not expressed in terms of cold fronts or thunderstorms.</P><P>One can illustrate the reductionist world view by imagining all theprinciples of science as being dots on a huge chart, with arrows flowinginto each principle from all the other principles by which it is explained.The lesson of history is that these arrows do not form separate disconnectedclumps, representing science that are logically independent, and they donot wander aimlessly. Rather, they are all connected, and if followed backwardthey all seem to branch outward from a common source, an ultimate law ofnature that Dyson calls &quot;a finite set of fundamental equations&quot;.We say that one concept is at a higher level or a deeper level then anotherif it is governed by principles that are further from or closer to thiscommon source. Thus the reductionist regards the general theories governingair and water and radiation as being at a deeper level than theories aboutcold fronts or thunderstorms, not in the sense that they are more useful,but only in the sense that the latter can in principle be understood asmathematical consequences of the former. The reductionist program of physicsis the search for the common source of all explanations.</P><P>As far as I can tell, Dyson's objections are entirely directed at reductionismas a research program rather than as a world view. He regrets that Einsteinand (in later life) Oppenheimer were not interested in something as excitingas black holes, and blames this on their belief that &quot;the only problemworthy of the attention of a serious theoretical physicists was the discoveryof the fundamental equation of physics&quot;. This is pretty mild criticism.Dyson does not question the value of the discovery of the fundamental equations(how could he), but only tells us that there are other things in physicsto think about, like black holes. This is like a prohibitionist who isagainst gin because, good as it is , it distracts people from orange juice.And I am not sure that Dyson is even entirely right about Einstein andOppenheimer as examples of the danger of the appeal of reductionism.</P><P>I recall as a Princeton graduate student going to seminars at the Institutefor Advanced Study, where Dyson was a professor and Oppenheimer the director.I</P><P>Oppenheimer always sat in front and carried on a detailed technicaldialogue with the speaker, whatever the topic might be. He certainly seemedinterested in everything what was going on on physics, not just at thereductive forefront. In fact, even in the 1920s and 1930s, when he wasdoing his best research, Oppenheimer's work had much less to do with findingfundamental equations than with calculating the consequences of existingtheories. By the time I met him, Oppenheimer's own research had prettywell ended, and I can believe that he explained this even to himself inthe way that is cited by Dyson; but I suspect that the truth is that hehad just become too famous and too busy to have time for research.</P><P>Einstein is another story. He had never immersed himself the way Oppenheimerdid in the physics research of others. The physicist-historian Gerald Holtonshowed some years ago that Einstein was not significantly influenced bythe specific experimental results of Michelson and Morley that is oftendescribed as the crucial clue that led to special relativity. I think thatEinstein objected to black holes not because he found them uninterestingbut rather for precisely the reason that I and many others find them interesting;they suggested an incompleteness in his beloved general theory of relativity.Physics in the reductive style had served Einstein magnificently well untilthe 1920s, and he was not so much wrong in trying to continue in this veinas he was in assuming that the appropriate subjects for fundamental researchwould continue to be what they had been in his youth: gravitation and electromagnetism.He became narrow, endlessly pursuing the false goal of unifying gravitationand electromagnetism, and cut off from exciting work on cosmic rays andelementary particles and quantum field theory that eventually led to theunification of the standard model. His real mistake is one we all risk:he became old.</P><P>Much of the criticism of reductionism is really only criticism of reductionismas a program for research. A good example is an argument by the moral philosopherMary Midgley. In her article in the collection based on the Jesus Collegesymposium, she asks &quot; What, for instance, about a factual statementlike 'George was allowed home from prison at last on Sunday'? How willthe language of physics convey the meaning of 'Sunday'? or 'home' or 'allowed'or 'prison'? or 'at last'? or even 'George'?&quot; This criticism wouldstrike home if there were physicists who were trying to use physics forsuch a purpose, but I don't know of any.</P><P>It is not just that (as enphasized in this symposium by Atkins and thephilosophers Paul and Patricia Churchland ) prison and people and thunderstormsare too complicated for us to be able to predict their behavior by followingthe motion of the elementary particles of which they are composed. It isalso a matter of what interests us. The buzzword here is &quot;emergence&quot;.As we deal with more and more complicated systems, we see phenomena emergefrom them that are much more interesting than a mountain of computer printoutdescribing the motion of each particle in the system ever could be. Mindis a phenomenon that emerges from the biology of complicated anomalies,just as life is a phenomenon that emerges from the chemistry of complicatedmolecules. We are interested in whether George is happy to be out of jailin a way that is different from our interest in his nerve cells, and weare interested in his nerve cells in a way that is different from our interestin the electrons and protons and neutrons of which they are composed. Butphenomena like mind and life do emerge. The rules they obey are not independenttruths, but follow from scientific principles at a deeper level; apartfrom historical accidents that by definition cannot be explained, the nervoussystems of George and his friends have evolved to what they are entirelybecause of the principles of macroscopic physics and chemistry, which inturn are what they are entirely because of principles of standard modelof elementary particles.</P><P>It is not so much that the reductionist world view helps us to understandGeorge himself as that it rules out other sorts of understanding. Everyfield of science operates by formulating and testing generalizations thatare sometimes dignified by being called principles or laws. The libraryof the University of Texas has thirty-fife books with the title &quot;Principlesof Chemistry&quot; and eighteen books with the title &quot;Principles ofPsychology&quot;. But there are no principles of chemistry that simplystand on their own, without needing to be explained reductively from theproperties of electrons and atomic nuclei, and in the same way there areno principles of psychology that are free-standing, in the sense that theydo not need ultimately to be understood through the study of the humanbrain, which in turn must ultimately be understood on the basis on physicsand chemistry. Henry Bergson and Darth Vader notwithstanding, there isno life force. This is invaluable negative perspective that is providedby reductionism.</P><P>I suppose Midgley might retort that she doesn't know any anti-reductionistphilosophers who think that there are free-standing principles of psychology.Maybe not, though many of our fellow citizens still think that George behavesthe way he does because he has a soul that is governed by laws quite unrelatedto those that govern particles or thunderstorms. But let that pass. Infact, I suspect that Midgley shares the world view of grand reductionism,but holds it &quot;not honesty to have it thus set down&quot;.</P><P>At any rate, Midgley has to reach in some peculiar directions in hersearch for horrible examples of reductionism. One of her targets is B.F.Skinner,the late arch-behaviorist and master pigeon trainer. I share her dislikeof Skinner's refusal to deal with consciousness in his work. But why doesshe quote him in a critique of reductionism? I am not aware that Skinnerthought very much about science like evolutionary biology or neurologywhich might provide reductive explanations for principles of psychology.I always thought that Skinner's problem was not reductionism, but positivism,the doctrine that science should concern itself only with what can be directlyobserved, like behavior. Positivism generally leads away from reductionism;for instance, at the beginning of this century it led the influential Viennesephysicist-philosopher Ernst Mach to reject the idea of atoms, because theycould not be directly observed.</P><P>Perhaps I do know why Midgley chose Skinner as a reductionist villain.Skinner excluded consciousness from his view of the mind, and consciousnessposes the greatest challenge to reductionism. It is difficult to see howthe ordinary methods of science can be applied to consciousness, becauseit is the one thing we know about directly, not through the senses. PeterAtkins gave a splendid in-your-face reductionist polemic at Jesus Collegewhich I thoroughly enjoyed reading. &quot;Scientists, with their implicittrust in reductionism, are privileged to be at the summit of knowledge,and to see further into truth than any of their contemporaries&quot;. Give'em hell, Peter! But it seems to me that Atkins is not sufficiently sensitiveto the problems surrounding consciousness. I don't see how anyone but Georgewill ever know how it feels to be George. On the other hand, I can readilybelieve that at least in principle we will one day be able to explain allof George's behavior reductively, including what he says about how he feels,and that consciousness will be one of the emergent higher-level conceptsappearing in this explanation.</P><P>In their articles in the symposium report the neuroscientists GeraldEdelman and Oliver Sacks make what I think is too much of the supposedantireductionist implications of new ideas about the brain. In his articlewritten with Giulio Tononi, Edelman describes his &quot;Theory of NeuronalGroup Selection&quot;, according to which the brain doesn't operate accordingto a preset program, but rather to one that evolves through a sort of naturalselection during the life of the organism. He then argues in another articlein this collection that &quot;the kind of reductionism that doomed thethinkers of the Enlightenment is confused by evidence that has emergedboth from modern neuroscience and from modern physics. I have argued thata person is not explainable in molecular, field-theoretical, or physiologicalterms alone. To reduce a theory of individual's behavior to a theory ofmolecular interactions is simply silly.... Even given the success of reductionismin physics, chemistry, and molecular biology, it nonetheless becomes sillyreductionism when it is applied exclusively to the matter of the mind&quot;.</P><P>Edelman is a very distinguished scientist, and his &quot;neural Darwinism&quot;may well be a great advance in the theory of the mind; but when he discussesthe basis of a scientific world view, I don't see what is the big differencebetween natural selection over millions of years producing a mental operatingsystem that is fixed at birth or natural selection proceeding over millionsof years and then continuing for a few decades after birth. Neural Darwinismmay rule out some reductionist theories of the mind of the sort that arebased on analogies with artificial intelligence, but it does not rule outthe hope of other thoroughly reductionist views of mentality.</P><P>When Edelman says that a person cannot be reduced to molecular interactions,is he saying anything different (except in degree) than a botanist or ameteorologist who says that a rose or a thunderstorm cannot be reducedto molecular interactions? It may or may not be silly to pursue reductionistprograms of research on complicated systems that are strongly conditionedby history, like brains or roses or thunderstorms. What is never sillyis the perspective, provided by reductionism, apart from historical accidentsthese things ultimately are the way they are because of the fundamentalprinciples of physics.</P><P>Roger Penrose strayed some time ago from his successful research inmathematical physics to think about the mind. As in his earlier books,he argued at the Jesus College symposium that &quot; classical [that is,prequantum] physics seems incapable of explaining a phenomenon so deeplymysterious as consciousness&quot;. I gather that Edelman agrees with Penrosebecause he finds the determinism of classical physics uncongenial. Determinismis logically distinct from reductionism, but the two doctrines tend togo together because the reductionist goal of explanation is tied in withthe determinist idea of prediction; we test our explanations by their powerto make successful preductions. This must be what Edelman means when hespeaks of modern physics (i.e., quantum mechanics) as refuting Enlightenmentideas of reductionism.</P><P>Of course, everything is ultimately quantum-mechanical; the questionis whether quantum mechanics will appear directly in the theory of mind,and not just in the deeper-level theories like chemistry on which the theoryof the mind will be based. Edelman and Penrose might be right about this,but I doubt it. It is precisely those systems that can be approximatelydescribed by pre-quantum classical mechanics that are so sensitive to initialconditions that, for practical purposes, they are unpredictable. In quantummechanics isolated systems are governed by an equation (the Schroedingerequation) whose solutions are strictly speaking fully deterministic, neverchaotic. The famous uncertainties in the positions and velocities of particlesdiscovered by Heisenberg do not arise in isolation systems but only whenwe let such a system interact with a measuring apparatus.</P><P>There is another reason for some of the opposition to reductionism,and specifically to the perspective provided by grand reductionism. Itis that this perspective removes much of the traditional motivation forbelief in God. This is especially true, for example, of one of the greatreductionist episodes in the history of science: first Darwin and Wallaceexplained the evolution of adaptation as a consequence of heredity andnatural selection; then twentieth-century biologists explained heredityas a result of genes and mutations; and then Crick and Watson explainedthe genetic mechanism as a consequence of the structure of the DNA molecule,which with a large enough computer could be explained as a solution ofthe Schroedinger equation.</P><P>Vaclav Havel has described the corrosion of religious faith as a reasonfor his own reservations about much of science. In a 1987 article(4) hecomplained that &quot;abolishes as mere fiction even the innermost foundationof our natural world; it kills God and takes his place on the vacant throne....'Then, last year, in a widely quoted speech he added that &quot;we may knowimmeasurably more about the universe than our ancestors did, and yet itincreasingly seems that they knew something more essential about it thanwe do, something that escapes us.&quot;(5)</P><P>On the other hand, some people are attracted to reductionist sciencefor the same reason. This is an old story. Thales' ocean had no room forPoseidon. In Hellenistic times the cult leader Epicurus adopted the atomistictheory of Democritus as an antidote to belief in the Olympian gods. I thinkthat Midgley is absolutely right in arguing that scientists are often drivenin their work by motives of this sort. Of course, none of this bears onthe question of whether the reductionist perspective is correct. And sincein fact it is correct, we had all better learn to live with it.</P><P>There is one limitation of the scientific world view that I am gladto acknowledge. Science may be able to tell us how to explain or to getwhat we value, but it can never tell us what we ought to value. Moral oraesthetic statements are simply not of the sort which it is appropriateto call true or false. I think Midgley would agree, but I am not sure whetherAtkins would, and certainly many others would not. According to the Britishpress, the Bishop of Edinburgh recently argued that, since people are geneticallypreconditioned toward adultery, the Church should not condemn it. Whateveryou think of adultery, it is simply a non sequitur to draw moral lessonsfrom genetics. Ronald Reagan made the same silly mistake when he arguedthat abortion should be banned because science has not yet decided whetherthe fetus is alive. Whatever definition of life scientists may find convenient,and at whatever point in pregnancy a fetus may start to match that definition,the question of the value we should place on (say) a newly fertilized humanegg is one that is entirely open to individual moral judgment. (Not thatthis is the only issue in the debate over abortion, or even the one thatnecessarily motivates opponents of abortion.) Science can't even justifyscience; the decision to explore the world as it is shown to us by reasonand experiment is a moral one, not a scientific one.</P><P>None of the participants in the symposium at Jesus College seems tohave addressed the really urgent problem confronting reductionism: Is itworth what it cost? After all, there are many competing reasons for doingscience. Some research (e.g., medicine, much of chemistry) is done forpractical purposes, or for use in other fields. Some of it (e.g., medicineagain, especially psychiatry and psychology, human evolution) is done becausewe are naturally interested in ourselves. Some of it deals with things(e.g., the mind again, black holes, superconductivity) that are so weirdand impressive that we can't help trying to understand them. Some researchis done because we suspect the phenomena that we study (e.g., superconductivityagain, turbulence, sex ratios in animal populations) will have explanationsthat are mathematically beautiful. All of these types of research competefor funds with research that is done because it moves us closer to thereductionist goal of finding the laws of nature that lie at the startingpoint of all chains of explanation.</P><P>The problem facing science is not (as most of the Jesus College symposiastsseem to think) that the reductionist imperative is putting the rest ofscience at risk. Few if any of us who are interested in the search forthe laws of nature doubt the validity of the other motives of search. (Isuspect that eventually I will come to feel that research on cancer orheart disease is more important than anything else.) The problem is thatsome people, including some scientists, deny that the search for the finallaws of nature has its own special sort of value, a value that also shouldbe taken into account in deciding how to fund research.</P><P>At present, the search for final explanations takes place chiefly inelementary particle physics. But research on elementary particles has becomevery expensive, because the laws of nature are revealed more clearly inthe collisions of particles in high-energy accelerators than in what isgoing on around us in everyday life. Cosmology is also important here.As John Barrow reminded the symposium, in order to understand the worldwe need to know not only the laws of nature but also the initial conditions.Some theories hope that the initial conditions may ultimately be derivedfrom the laws of nature, but we are a long way from that goal. Cosmologicalresearch too is very expensive, requiring observatories like Hubble andCOBE and AXAF that are carried above the earth's atmosphere on artificialsatellites.</P><P>For budgetary reason this sort of research is slowly coming to a haltin the US. The Supercollider project was canceled, partly because the argumentsthat such research is best done at existing laboratories or through internationalcollaboration; but the same Congress that killed the Supercollider wenton to cut research funding ot other national laboratories, and the presentCongress has shown no eagerness to cooperate with Europe in building theirnext accelerator near Geneva, the Large Hadron Collider.</P><P>In the debates over these funding decisions, an important part was andis played by scientists, including some physicists, who oppose spendingfor elementary particle physics. In part, these scientists take this positionbecause they hope to see this money spent on research in their own fields,a hope that was disappointed when the funds saved by canceling the Supercolliderdisappeared into the general budget. But also at work is a perfectly sincerelack of appreciation of the reductionist tradition in science, a traditionthat in our time is embodied in the physics of elementary particles andfields. It is good that reductionism is discussed by talented people likethose who met at Jesus College, but I wish that their discussion couldhave been more to the point.</P><P><FONT SIZE=-1>(1) Freeman Dyson, &quot;The Scientist as Rebel&quot;,The New York Review, May 25, 1995,pp. 31-33.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE=-1>(2) This book contains interesting articles on the foundationof mathematics and on the other subjects, which I will not discuss herebecause I want to concentrate on reductionism in the natural sciences.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE=-1>(3) Grand and petty reductionism correspond more or lessto what the evolutionary biologist Ernst Mayr has called &quot;theory reductionism&quot;and &quot;explanatory reductionism&quot; in his article &quot;The limitsof Reductionism&quot;, Nature 331 (1987), p.475.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE=-1>(4) &quot;Politics and Conscience&quot;, in Vaclav Havel,or Living in Truth (Faber and Faber, 1987), p.138.
