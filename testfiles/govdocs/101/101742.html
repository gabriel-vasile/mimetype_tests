These terms and definitions are used to classify observable or inferred facts or events, and to assign values for properties in descriptions. The vocabulary makes pre-defined terms available to apply in descriptions without having to reconstruct the entire description denoted by the vocabulary term. Terms within a controlled vocabulary may be <i>atomic</i> or <i>analyzable</i>. The atomic terms are irreducible in the database environment; they are either numbers, or terms defined by narrative text. The text definition is meant for a human user, and is not amenable to automated analysis. Analyzable terms are specified by combinations of properties and relationships according to some formal description structure Analyzable terms may be compared, using the values of the properties in their formal description. The atomic terms in a vocabulary may represent complex concepts that could be represented by description schema. Implementation of formal descriptions for terminology associated with a concept allows users to develop alternate or more specific terminology for concepts that may interoperate with other systems by using automated description comparisons (Description Logic).</p><p class="text">The unifying feature of the NGMDB is a common conceptual model and terminology  system. To function as a part of the NGMDB, individual databases must conform  to, or interoperate with, the common conceptual model and shared terminology.  The simplest route to NGMDB conformance is to use the standard science vocabularies.  If desired, users can build their own vocabularies, but in order to be NGMDB  conformable, user-defined vocabularies will need to: 1) define the scope of  their vocabulary; 2) provide text definitions of each vocabulary term; 3) build  formal definitions rooted in the standard science vocabulary, using description schema from the common conceptual model, and a standard, well documented syntax; and 4) provide a correlation of each term with the most specific subsuming term from the standard vocabulary.</p><p class="h1">INTRODUCTION</p><p class="text">Science language vocabularies are being constructed for use in the National Geologic  Map Database (NGMDB), a distributed, federated information system that is planned  for integrating geologic data provided by state and federal geological surveys.  The goal is to provide geologic data to users in government, business and academia  in a consistent data structure, using consistent descriptive terminology. A  conceptual model referred to as NADM&ndash;C1, proposed as a standard data structure  for geologic map data, has been developed by the Data Model Design Team of  the North American Data Model Steering Committee (NADMSC) and is under review  (Data Model Design Team, 2003). The National Geologic Map Database Project  will use this model as a foundation for database development. A Science Language Technical Team of the NADMSC has developed a draft science language that is currently in review as well (<a href="http://geology.usgs.gov/dm/steering/teams/language/charter.shtml" target="_blank">http://geology.usgs.gov/dm/steering/teams/language/charter.shtml</a>), and the NGMDB will use this vocabulary with extensions as necessary. The use of a clearly defined vocabulary, with definitions developed to avoid ambiguity in the use of terms, is essential for consistent communication of science concepts to a wide variety of data users with varying geologic expertise.    </p><p class="text">Implementation of any geoscience information system requires a collection of  science language terms and definitions to populate descriptions of rocks, geologic  units, and structures (Giles and others, 1997). A collection of terms, their  definitions, and relationships between the terms (especially hierarchical relationships)  are referred to here as a controlled vocabulary or terminology system (de Keizer  and Abu-Hanna, 2000, de Keizer and others, 2000). The data model implemented  by a database dictates the kinds of controlled vocabularies required to actually populate the database. For example, the NADM&ndash;C1 models &lsquo;WeatheringCharacter&rsquo; as a property of a geologic unit. This property is specified by a term from a science language vocabulary, thus requiring a controlled vocabulary of terms that specify different weathering character values. Controlled vocabularies are used to populate fields in a database in order to make possible the clear and unambiguous communication of database content. The fundamental difficulty is the variability in usage of many common geoscience terms. Consider the various usages of the term &lsquo;shale&rsquo;:</p><ul class="text">  <li> &ldquo;Shale is a laminated or fissile claystone or siltstone....To those claystones    which are neither fissile nor laminated but are blocky or massive, the term    mudstone may be applied.&rdquo; (Pettijohn, 1957, p. 341) </li>  <li>&ldquo;Shale...is rock that    splits parallel to bedding into thin flakes or plates.&rdquo; (Williams and others,    1954, p. 316);</li>  <li>&ldquo;In this book, the author uses the term shale for all sedimentary rocks    composed dominantly of mud-size (&lt;0.6 mm) particles.&rdquo; (Boggs, 2001, p. 153). </li>  <li>&ldquo;A widely used and often loosely used field term for mudstone which shows a conspicuous fissility on weathering. It is somewhat unsatisfactory in that the weathering state must play a part in its recognition and it cannot be consistently used in comparing rock at outcrop with, say, that of a borehole core&rdquo; (Collinson and Thompson, 1989, p. 54). </li>  <li>According to Potter and others (1980, table 1.2), &ldquo;mudshale&rdquo; and &ldquo;clayshale&rdquo; are terms restricted to rocks that are laminated (&lt;10 mm) and that have specific ranges of clay-size constituents: 33&ndash;65% (mudshale) and 66&ndash;100% (clayshale); </li>  <li>&ldquo;Shale is the term used for fissile mudrock and, more generally, for the entire class of fine grained sedimentary rocks that contain substantial quantities of clay minerals.&rdquo; (Blatt and others, 1980, p. 374). These authors emphasize fissility as a core    requirement for the definition of shale (also see Folk, 1968).</li></ul><p class="text"> It should be apparent that the use of shale as a rock name in a database, without  some connection with the definition of shale the user is implying, does not  communicate unambiguously what kind of rock is being described. Standardized  terminology is being developed in order to avoid these sorts of problems.</p><p class="text"> In  this paper, the NADM conceptual data model (NADM&ndash;C1) is first reviewed because  it defines the framework within which the NGMDB science language is being developed.  Then the design of the NGMDB science language is described.</p><p class="h1">NADM CONCEPTUAL MODEL</p><p class="text">The NADM&ndash;C1 for geologic map information, version 1.0 (Data Model Design Team,    2003) is designed to be a technology-neutral conceptual model that can form    the basis for a web-based interchange format using evolving information technology    (such as Extensible Markup Language, or XML), and for the design of database implementations that can interoperate using the interchange format. The intended purpose is to allow the sharing of geologic information independent of logical and physical implementations. NADM&ndash;C1 is a model of geoscience concepts and the relationships between them, with special emphasis on concepts related to information presented on geologic maps (Richard, 1999 and in press; Brodaric and Gahegan, 2000; Brodaric and Hastings, 2002; Soller and others, 2002).          </p><p class="text">The top level of NADM&ndash;C1 is &lsquo;NADMUniverse,&rsquo; representing all concepts in the model. Three subclasses of NADMUniverse are represented: GeologicConcept, Metadata, and GeologicRepresentation (fig. 1). The metadata part of NADM&ndash;C1 is outside the scope of this paper and will not be discussed. Concept names in the text written using the Courier font refer to NADM&ndash;C1 model elements, and concept names in plain text refer to geoscience concepts in general. The term &lsquo;concept&rsquo; as used here represents the notion of any mental phenomena that human beings use in their internal representation of the world. Webster&rsquo;s dictionary (<a href="http://www.m-w.com/%00" target="_blank">http://www.m-w.com/</a>) uses the terms &lsquo;idea&rsquo; and &lsquo;object of thought&rsquo; to convey the meaning of &lsquo;concept.&rsquo;GeologicConcept includes concepts specific to the domain of geoscience knowledge. Figure 1 shows a generalized version of the modeled GeologicConcept hierarchy. The top-level concept that pertains to geologic maps and geologic information (loosely defined) is called GeologicConcept. The names in the boxes beneath the major concept names represent additional concepts that inherit from GeologicConcept. In other words, GeologicStructure is a GeologicConcept and Contact is a GeologicStructure and, therefore, a GeologicConcept.</p><table cellpadding="4">  <tr>    <td width="600"><img src="../graphics/richard1/fig1.gif" width="600" height="397" alt="High-level geologic concept hierarchy for NADM–C1.

A geologic vocabulary is a collection of controlled concepts,  referred to here as terms. Each of these is associated with a preferred name,  and terms are usually organized in some logical fashion such as a hierarchy.  The preferred name for a controlled concept in any particular vocabulary provides  a standard means of identifying the associated GeologicConcept in that context,  and can be thought of as a proxy for the collection of property values and relationships specified in the definition of the controlled concept. Examples of geologic vocabulary include a collection of standard rock types, a stratigraphic lexicon, or a geologic time scale.              </p><p class="text">A description is a collection of property values and relationships that apply  to some thing (in the most general sense), specifying the nature of the thing  such that it may be identified. A term from a science language vocabulary implies  the properties and relationships specified in its normative description. The  normative description may be a simple body of text, in which case the controlled concept is not computationally analyzable. Other normative descriptions may be specified by a description scheme that establishes the properties and relationships that may be assigned values to build a description. Such descriptions may be analyzed using software inference tools to determine subsumption and class membership relationships. For example, a rock is defined as &lsquo;a compound material that is consolidated&rsquo;. The description scheme for compound material specifies that (among other things) a compound material has a &lsquo;consolidation degree&rsquo; property. This property is specified by a term from the consolidation degree terms vocabulary. Given a collection of compound material descriptions, all instances of rock could be identified by selecting for those with a consolidation degree property value that is &lsquo;consolidated&rsquo; or some term that is a child of &lsquo;consolidated&rsquo; (such as &lsquo;strongly indurated&rsquo;).</p><p class="text"> Geologic vocabularies play a central role in the application of NADM&ndash;C1 for storing geologic information. Terms from geologic vocabularies are used to classify observable or inferred facts or events (phenomena), and to describe them by assigning values for various properties (fig. 2). Controlled vocabularies of rock names, kinds of geologic structures, or geologic units (stratigraphic lexicon) are used to classify observations to be recorded in a database. The vocabulary makes the definitions of controlled concepts available to apply in other descriptions without having to reconstruct the entire description denoted by the term. For example, in the description of a geologic unit, a constituent may be identified simply as &lsquo;granite&rsquo;&mdash;a term from a standard lithology vocabulary, which has an associated normative description that follows the description scheme for a compound material as specified in the NADM&ndash;C1 model. Because the controlled term &lsquo;granite&rsquo; is linked to a description, no other data entry is necessary in order to infer that the properties of &lsquo;granite&rsquo; (consolidation, color, composition, etc.) apply to some part of the geologic unit. The NADM&ndash;C1 model identifies numerous geologic properties that are used in description or definition of geologic concepts. Each of these properties requires an associated vocabulary of terms to specify possible values for that property in a database.</p><table cellpadding="4">  <tr>    <td width="500"><img src="../graphics/richard1/fig2.jpg" width="500" height="323" alt="Relationship between NADM–C1 conceptual model and science language.

GeologicVocabulary is a model element      representing a controlled vocabulary or terminology system that contains      the words used to enumerate important phenomena and to specify property      values in formal descriptions; for example, a lithology lexicon is a collection      of terms (science language, vocabulary) that correspond to different kinds    of compound Earth materials.</td>  </tr></table><p class="text">As an example, consider the following text from a published geologic report:</p><blockquote>  <blockquote>    <blockquote>      <p class="text"> &ldquo;The diabase is typically dark gray or greenish gray. It [grain size] ranges from aphanitic to coarse-grained, and the coarser grained diabase has ophitic texture.&rdquo; (Peterson, 1962)</p>    </blockquote>  </blockquote></blockquote><p class="text"> In this sentence, the term diabase identifies a rock type that must be defined  in some controlled vocabulary if it is to convey a precise meaning. The description  here specifies three properties&mdash;color, grain-size, and fabric. The values for  these properties is given using terms &ldquo;dark gray&rdquo; or &ldquo;greenish gray&rdquo; for color, &ldquo;aphanitic&rdquo; and &ldquo;coarse-grained&rdquo; specifying a grain-size range, and &ldquo;ophitic&rdquo; specifying a fabric or relationship between mineral grains in the rock. These terms would have to be defined in a controlled vocabulary in order to have unambiguous meaning in a database.</p><p class="h1">DESIGN OF NGMDB TERMINOLOGY</p><p class="text">The NGMDB terminology system design consists of three parts. First is the actual  list of terms that encompass the range of concepts that will be represented  in the information system. Second is a specification of how descriptions are  constructed to define concepts within the system. These description schema  are defined by a conceptual data model that identifies the objects, properties,  and relationships inherent in concepts to be represented in a database. The  NGMDB science language uses description schema from the NADM&ndash;C1 (Data Model Design Team, 2003) model, along with some extensions to that model. For example, the description of the thickness of a lithostratigraphic unit includes the following properties: 1) reported minimum thickness; 2) reported maximum thickness; 3) typical thickness reported or interpreted; 4) source of typical thickness (field geologist, person who parsed the map legend, or other); 5) reported unit of measure; 6) original free text description or, for new data, a summary text description; 7) comments and/or processing notes from the person who parsed the legend; and 8) reference to a spatial extent (such as a rock body, borehole, outcrop, some part of a quadrangle). The description scheme also specifies the cardinality for each attribute (required, optional). The third part of the terminology system is the collection of definitions for terms included in the system.                    </p><p class="text">The NGMDB terminology will attempt to follow the criteria of non-vagueness, non-ambiguity,  and non-redundancy (de Keizer and Abu-Hanna, 2000). Non-vagueness prescribes that definitions of vocabulary terms must be sufficient to identify a particular concept. Non-ambiguity prescribes that definitions must address exactly one term. Non-redundancy specifies that a description has only one corresponding most-specific term. Because the NGMDB is intended to be useful to a wide variety of users, definitions of terms must be intelligible to non-geologists. In short, definitions of terms need to be clear, unambiguous, and non-overlapping.                    </p><p class="text">The NGMDB science language is a concept vocabulary. The identity of a controlled  concept (represented by a term from the vocabulary) is based on its definition,  not the actual word used. The preferred name or term associated with the concept  in the vocabulary is a label for the concept used in human communication. Each  controlled concept has these properties:</p><ul class="text">  <li>Unique identifier </li>  <li>Name (a term) </li>  <li>Definition </li>  <li>Tracking (information on source of term)</li></ul><p class="text">Hierarchical arrangement of concepts is fundamental to many aspects of human  thinking (Murphy and Lassaline, 1997). Most of the concepts that geologists  use have a hierarchical structure, from very general to very specific; and  for any observation or interpretation, terms consistent with the geologist&rsquo;s level of confidence are used. Hierarchical relationships between complex concepts are non-unique. For example, bedding partings in a sedimentary rock are a kind of planar structure and a kind of sedimentary structure. Multiple hierarchies may be defined, each valid and useful in some context. Implementation of the science language should include support for multiple explicitly defined hierarchies (Brodaric and others, 2002). For terms that have formal definitions constructed in the information system, description logic inference tools can determine hierarchy based on subsumption relationships between the normative descriptions.</p><p class="h2">Terms</p><p class="text"> Terms (controlled concepts) within a controlled vocabulary may be <i>atomic</i> or  <i>analyzable</i>. The atomic terms are irreducible in the database environment; they  are either  numbers, or terms defined by narrative text. The text definition is meant to  convey the meaning of a term to a human user, but is not amenable to automated  analysis other than a simple string or number comparison of the identifier for the term. In the example given above, atomic terms specify color (dark gray) and fabric (ophitic). Another example would be terms used to describe outcrop character, such as &ldquo;bouldery&rdquo; or &ldquo;ledgy&rdquo;.                          </p><p class="text">Analyzable terms are specified by a linked collection of properties and relationships  according to some formal description structure (description schema, see below).  Analyzable terms may be compared on the basis of the values of the properties  in their formal description. In the above example from Peterson (1962), the  grain-size property is specified using analyzable terms &ldquo;aphanitic&rdquo; and &ldquo;coarse-grained&rdquo;. These terms correspond to some quantitative range of particle diameters in  the rock, commonly specified by a minimum and maximum diameter for the size-range  represented by each term. The description associated with an analyzable grain  size term might thus consist of a minimum diameter property and a maximum diameter  property, each specified by a length property. The length property might in  turn be specified by a description that includes a quantity property and a  measurement unit property. The atomic concepts in this description would be  the numbers that specify quantity, and terms that specify measurement systems  (millimeters, inches, etc.).                          </p><p class="text">The atomic terms in a vocabulary may be conceptually simple, but in many cases,  atomic terms may represent complex concepts that could be represented by description  schema. The choice of when to model and implement the description of a complex  concept or to represent the concept using an atomic term is based on the usefulness  of having an analyzable description. Implementation of formal descriptions for terminology associated with some concept allows users to develop alternate terminology, or more specific terminology, for the concept that may be integrated with other terminology systems that use the same description scheme for that concept. The granularity (level of detail) of terms in a vocabulary must be considered in the design of a practical terminology system. A vocabulary consisting only of atomic terms is relatively simple to implement, but is difficult to extend and customize. Such a vocabulary would probably be limited to more general terminology because of the difficulty in defining specialized terminology in such a way that it will gain acceptance. All hierarchical relationships would have to be explicitly represented. Processing queries in such a system would be relatively simple, and could probably be done using Structured Query Language(SQL). Systems in which formal descriptions are constructed for terms would allow users to customize terminology without losing the ability to integrate their data with others. Hierarchical relationships based on subsumption could be determined using description-logic inference software. The descriptions would still have to be based on a common terminology, but at a conceptually simpler level, for which wide agreement on definition is easier to attain. The cost is that such systems are more difficult to implement, and the query processing might require logical analysis of descriptions well beyond the capability of SQL databases, necessitating a logic-based inference processor.</p><p class="h2">Description Schema</p><p class="text">A description schema is a specification of the properties associated with a concept,  and its relation to other concepts. Particular instances of the concept are  characterized by particular values for these properties and relationships.  The NADM&ndash;C1 model includes description schemes for major geoscience concepts: materials, geologic units, and structures. Figure 3 shows a simplified version of the NADM&ndash;C1 description scheme for EarthMaterial. This scheme is the template for description of any material component of the Earth. An abstract class named CompoundMaterial represents materials that are aggregates of particles, and includes rocks and unconsolidated material. The scheme allows any material to be described by color, chemical composition, age, genesis (geologic history), or physical property attributes. A compound material (a rock) is described as an aggregation of constituent parts, each of which may be any Earth material. Some attributes are specific to compound materials, such as the degree of consolidation and description of the void spaces between particles. Some attributes are specific to constituents (an occurrence of an Earth material as part of a compound material), namely the proportion that the constituent forms in the aggregation, and a role property that specifies the relationship of the constituent to the whole aggregate material (for example, phenocryst, groundmass, matrix, framework, etc.). Finally, there are attributes that may apply to either individual constituents or to the aggregate as a whole, such as fabric and particle geometry. For instance, plagioclase may be a constituent as phenocrysts, with a grain size (part of particle geometry, see below) of 2&ndash;5 mm. Alternatively, a particular sandstone (compound material) may be described as fine-grained (a grain size attribute, part of the particle geometry group of properties).</p><p class="text"> Properties may be specified using atomic terms from a geologic vocabulary. For  instance, consolidation degree in figure 3 may have an associated hierarchical  vocabulary of atomic terms (fig. 4). Other properties may themselves have analyzable  structure, with descriptions of property values in terms of other (generally  simpler) properties. In this case, a vocabulary may be thought of as a collection  of property descriptions, with a corresponding term for each description. The  terms from this vocabulary effectively specify property values from the corresponding description.                          </p><table cellpadding="4">  <tr>    <td width="550"><img src="../graphics/richard1/fig3.jpg" width="550" height="401" alt="Schema for description of EarthMaterial from NADM–C1.

Particle  size may be specified quantitatively in a variety of ways. In figure 5, the  simple approach of specifying a maximum and minimum grain diameter is the description  scheme for a quantitative particle size description (QuantitativePSD). Each  diameter is in turn a measured quantity, for which the description scheme specifies  a numeric quantity and a measurement unit (determined by an atomic term from  a vocabulary of measurement unit systems). The table in the lower left of the  figure provides an example of four quantitative particle size descriptions.  Several terminology systems have been proposed for specifying particle size  in rocks. Terms from one of these systems may be used to populate a qualitative (terminological) particle size description (QualitativePSD in fig. 5). The table in the lower right of figure 5 includes several terms from one vocabulary for particle size (Wentworth, 1922). Each of these terms has a corresponding quantitative particle size description; thus they are analyzable terms.</p><table cellpadding="4">  <tr>    <td width="600"><img src="../graphics/richard1/fig5.jpg" alt="Particle size description.

S. Geological Survey, and perhaps by interested business and academic collaborators.  Sheth and Larson (1990) discuss the general framework and some approaches to  such information systems. The NGMDB system will be distributed because data  are created and managed by different agencies. The system is federated in that  all nodes on the system will interoperate using a common conceptual model and  a shared terminology. Individual nodes may implement the conceptual model and standard terminology directly, or may implement something different and interoperate with the network using a software transformation between their local data model and the common, conceptual data model. The common conceptual model will include NADM&ndash;C1, with extensions for description of geologic units and inclusion of feature level metadata.                                  </p><p class="text">Because the unifying feature of the NGMDB is the common conceptual model and  shared terminology, to function as a distributed system each agency&rsquo;s database must conform to, or interoperate with, the common conceptual model and shared terminology. The simplest route to NGMDB conformance is to use the standard science vocabularies. If desired, users can modify the NGMDB standard vocabulary or build their own vocabularies. In order to be considered NGMDB-conformant, user-defined vocabularies likely will need to:</p><ol class="text">  <li> Define the scope of their vocabulary or (terminology) </li>  <li> Define terms in a human-intelligible form      (text) </li>  <li>Build formal definitions rooted in the standard science vocabulary,      using description schema from the common conceptual model, and a standard,      well documented syntax. A standardized format is necessary but has not    yet been determined. </li>  <li>Provide a correlation of each term in      the vocabulary with the most specific subsuming term from the standard    vocabulary.</li></ol><p class="text">The NGMDB Science Language is now under development, and will be made publicly  available to facilitate implementation of conformant databases. The NGMDB terminology is intended to include:</p><ol class="text">  <li> Vocabularies for all geologic properties identified in the NADM&ndash;C1 data model </li>  <li> Hierarchical vocabularies for classifying rocks and unconsolidated materials,      geologic structures, and geologic processes (EarthMaterial, GeologicStructure      and GeologicProcess from NADM&ndash;C1) </li>  <li>Terminology required for the NGMDB relational database implementation of NADM&ndash;C1 (for example, vocabulary for measurement units) </li>  <li>Terminology for additional phenomena, properties, and metadata deemed necessary      by collaborators in NGMDB prototype projects (such as engineering properties).</li></ol><p class="text"> Figure 6 shows the framework for some of the vocabularies that eventually will  be needed for the National Geologic Map Database. Clearly, development of these  vocabularies is an ambitious goal that will take some time to achieve. Fortunately,  other efforts are underway that share the same objectives, particularly the  science language activities of the North American Data Model Steering Committee  Science Language Technical Team (SLTT), this volume; <a href="http://geology.usgs.gov/dm/steering/teams/language/charter.shtml" target="_blank">http://geology.usgs.gov/dm/steering/teams/language/charter.shtml</a>, and the Cyberinfrastructure For The Geosciences (GEON) project, a large, National                                    Science Foundation-funded effort to develop  cyberinfrastructure for geological sciences. Development of NGMDB science language        is thoroughly integrated                                with science language development by the SLTT.  Draft        language developed by                              the SLTT                                    is being incorporated directly into the draft    NGMDB science language vocabularies. The National Geologic Map database project      is actively                    exploring avenues                                of collaboration with GEON to accelerate development        of formal geologic                          vocabularies for use in                                    the construction of geologic information  systems. </p><table cellpadding="4">  <tr>    <td width="900"><img src="../graphics/richard1/fig6.gif" alt="Framework of geologic vocabularies that will be important for the National Geologic Map Database.
