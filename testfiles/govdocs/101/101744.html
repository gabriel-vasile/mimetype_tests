    <td valign="top" width="75%">In this document, we are concerned with the effects of data
    layouts for nonsquare processor meshes on the implementation of common dense linear
    algebra kernels such as matrix-matrix multiplication, LU factorizations, or eigenvalue
    solvers. In particular, we address ease of programming and tunability of the resulting
    software. We introduce a generalization of the torus wrap data layout that results in a
    decoupling of &quot;local&quot; and ``global'' data layout view. As a result, it allows
    for intuitive programming of linear algebra algorithms and for tuning of the algorithm for
    a particular mesh aspect ratio or machine characteristics. This layout is as simple as the
    proposed HPF layout but, in our opinion, enhances ease of programming as well as ease of
    performance tuning. We emphasize that we do not advocate that all users need be concerned
    with these issues. We do, however, believe that, for the foreseeable future,
    &quot;assembler coding&quot; (as message-passing code is likely to be viewed from a HPF
    programmers' perspective) will be needed to deliver high performance for computationally
    intensive kernels. As a result, we believe that the adoption of this approach not only
    would accelerate the generation of efficient linear algebra software libraries but also
    would accelerate the adoption of HPF as a result. We point out, however, that the adoption
    of this new layout would necessitate that an HPF compiler ensure that data objects are
    operated on in a consistent fashion across subroutine and function calls. </td>

    partitioning problem. The algorithm is based on an island model where multiple independent
    subpopulations each run a steady-state genetic algorithm on their own subpopulation and
    occasionally fit strings migrate between the subpopulations. Tests on 40 real-world set
    partitioning problems were carried out on up to 128 nodes of an IBM SP1 parallel computer.

    Davis-Putnam procedure for the propositional satisfiability problem. It also describes
    code that takes statements in first-order logic with equality and a domain size n then
    searches for models for size n. The first-order model-searching code transforms the
    statements into set of propositional clauses such that the first-order statements have a
    model of size n if and only if the propositional clauses are satisfiable. The
    propositional set is then given to the Davis-Putnam code; any propositional models that
    are found can be translated to models of the first-order statements. The first-order
    model-searching program accepts statements only in a flattened relational clause form
    without function symbols. Additional code was written to take input statements in the
    language of OTTER 3.0 and produce the flattened relational form. The program was
    successfully applied to several open questions on the existence of orthogonal quasigroups.

    say x = 0, of the finite integration interval. In the absence of a singularity, this error
    is described by the classical Euler-Maclaurin summation formula, which is an asymptotic
    expansion in inverse integer powers of m. When an integrable singularity (x**alpha with
    alpha &gt; -1) is present, Navot's generalization is valid. This introduces negative
    fractional powers of m into the expansion. Ninham has generalized this result to
    noninteger alpha satisfying alpha less than -1. In this note, we extend these results to
    all alpha by providing the nontrivial extension to negative integer alpha. This expansion

    express the update of the orthogonal transformation matrix in terms of block

    <td valign="top" width="75%">Automatic differentiation (AD) is a technique for generating
    efficient and reliable derivative codes from computer programs with a minimum of human
    effort. Derivatives of model output wit respect to input are obtained exactly. No
    intrinsic limits to program length or complexity exist for this procedure. Calculation of
    derivatives of complex numerical models is required in systems optimization, parameter
    identification, and systems identification. We report on our experiences with the ADIFOR
    (Automatic Differentiation in Fortran) tool on a two-dimensional groundwater flow and
    contaminant transport finite-element model, ISOQUAD, and a three-dimensional contaminant
    transport finite-element model, TLS3D. Derivative values and computational times for the
    automatic differentiation procedure are compared with values obtained from the divided
    differences and handwritten analytic approaches. We found that the derivative codes
    generated by ADIFOR provided accurate derivatives and ran significantly faster than
    divided-differences approximations, typically in a tenth of the CPU time required for the
    imprecise divided-differences method for both codes. We also comment on the benefit of
    automatic differentiation technology with respect to accelerating the transfer of general
    techniques developed for using water resource computer models, such as optimal design,
    sensitivity analysis, and inverse modeling problems, to field problems. </td>

    grid points where error contributions are large (near vortex centers). In this way the
    total number of grid points required to accurately capture vortex configurations is
    reduced. The authors have developed scalable libraries for adaptive mesh refinement and
    partitioning on two-dimensional triangular grids. They also present a new geometric
    partitioning algorithm that strives to minimize communication cost by ensuring good
    partition aspect ratios. The paper includes computational results showing the efficiency

    automatic differentiation tool are compared for efficiency and applicability to problems
    involving large numbers of design variables. A vector implementation on a CRAY Y-MP
    computer is compared with a coarse-grained parallel implementation on an IBM SP1 computer,
    employing a Fortran M wrapper. The SDs are computed for a swept transport wing in
    turbulent, transonic flow; the number of geometric design variables varies from 1 to 60,
    with coupling between a wing grid generation program and a state-of-the-art, 3-D

    For a small number of design variables, the CRAY Y-MP implementation is much faster. As

    in terms of compute speed, job turnaround time, and total memory available for solutions

    efficient and reliable derivative codes from computer programs with minimal human effort.
    Derivatives of model output with respect to input are obtained exactly. No intrinsic
    limits to program length or complexity exist for this procedure. Calculation of
    derivatives of complex numerical models is required in system optimization, parameter
    identification, and systems identification. We report on our experiences with the ADIFOR
    (automatic Differentiation of Fortran) tool on a two-dimensional groundwater flow and
    contaminant transport finite-element model, ISOQUAD, and a three-dimensional contaminant
    transport finite-element model, TLS3D. Derivative values and computational times for the
    automatic differentiation procedure are compared with values obtained from the divided
    differences and handwritten analytic approaches. The automatic differentiation tool ADIFOR
    produced derivative codes that calculated exact derivatives in typically almost an order
    of magnitude less CPU time than what is required for the imprecise divided differences
    method for both the two- and three-dimensional codes. We also comment on the benefit of
    automatic differentiation technology with respect to accelerating the transfer of general
    techniques developed for using water resource computer models (such as optimal design,
    sensitivity analysis, and inverse modeling problems) to field applications. </td>

    systems of nonlinear equations and nonlinear least squares problems, using a new class of
    methods called tensor methods. It is intended for small to medium-sized problems, say with
    up to 100 equations and unknowns, in cases where it is reasonable to calculate the
    Jacobian matrix or approximate it by finite differences at each iteration. The software
    allows the user to select between a tensor method and a standard method based on a linear
    model. Moreover, the software proves two different global strategies, a line search and a
    2D trust region approach. Test results indicate that, in general, tensor methods are
    significantly more efficient and robust than standard methods on small and medium-sized
    problems in iterations and function evaluations. </td>

    for massively parallel computation. Parallel solution of the sparse matrices that arise
    from such meshes has been studied heavily, and many good algorithms have been developed.
    Unfortunately, many of the other aspects of parallel unstructured mesh computation have
    gone largely ignored. We present a set of algorithms that allow the entire unstructured
    mesh computation process to execute in parallel---including adaptive mesh refinement,
    equation reordering, mesh partitioning, and sparse linear system solution. We briefly
    describe these algorithms and state results regarding their running time and performance.
    We then give results from the 512-processor Intel DELTA for a large-scale structural
    analysis problem. These results demonstrate that the new algorithms are scalable and
    efficient. The algorithms are able to achieve up to 2.2 gigaflops for this unstructured

    <td valign="top" width="75%">This paper introduces tensor methods for solving large sparse
    systems of nonlinear equations. Tensor methods for nonlinear equations were developed in
    the context of solving small to medium-sized dense problems. They base each iteration on a
    quadratic model of the nonlinear equations, where the second-order term is selected so
    that the model requires no more derivative or function information per iteration than
    standard linear model-based methods, and hardly more storage or arithmetic operations per
    iteration. Computational experiments on small to medium-sized problems have shown tensor
    methods to be considerably more efficient than standard Newton-based methods, with a
    particularly large advantage on singular problems. This paper considers the extension of
    this approach to solve large sparse problems. The key issue that must be considered is how
    to make efficient use of sparsity in forming and solving the tensor model problem at each
    iteration. Accomplishing this turns out to require an entirely new way of solving the
    tensor model that successfully exploits the sparsity of the Jacobian, whether the Jacobian
    is nonsingular or singular. We develop such an approach and, based upon it, an efficient
    tensor method for solving large sparse systems of nonlinear equations. Test results
    indicate that this tensor method is significantly more efficient and robust than an
    efficient sparse Newton-based method, in terms of iterations, function evaluations, and
    execution time. </td>

    <td valign="top" width="75%">When given a set of properties or conditions (say, three)
    that are claimed to be equivalent, the claim can be verified by supplying what we call a <em>circle
    of proofs</em>. In the case in point, one proves the second property or condition from the
    first, the third from the second, and the first from the third. If the proof that 1
    implies 2 does not rely on 3, then we say that the proof is pure with respect to 3, or
    simply say the <em>proof is pure</em>. If one can remember the three properties or
    conditions in such a way that one can find a circle of three pure proofs---technically,
    each proof pure with respect the condition that is neither the hypothesis nor the
    conclusion---then we say that a <em>circle of pure proofs</em> has been found. Here we
    study the specific question of the existence of a circle of pure proofs for the thirteen
    shortest single axioms for equivalential calculus, subject to the requirement that
    condensed detachment be used as the rule of inference. For an indication of the difficulty
    of answering the question, we note that a single application of condensed detachment to
    the (shortest single) axiom known as P4 (also known as UM) with itself yields the
    (shortest single) axiom P5 (also known as XGF), and two applications of condensed
    detachment beginning with P5 as hypothesis yields P4. Therefore, except for P5, one cannot
    find a pure proof of any of the twelve shortest single axioms when using P4 as hypothesis
    or axiom, for the first application of condensed detachment must focus on two copies of
    P4, which results in the deduction of P5, forcing P5 to be present in all proofs that use
    P4 as the only axiom. Further, the close proximity in the proof sense of P4 when using as
    the only axiom P5 threatens to make impossible the discovery of a circle of pure proofs
    for the entire set of thirteen shortest single axioms. Perhaps more important than our
    study of pure proofs, and of a more general nature, we also present the methodology used
    to answer the cited specific question, a methodology that relies on various strategies and
    features offered by W. McCune's automated reasoning program OTTER. The strategies and
    features of OTTER we discuss here offer researchers the needed power to answer deep
    questions and solve difficult problems. We close this article with some challenges and
    some topics for research and with a sample input file and some proofs for study. </td>

    requirements needed to achieve 30 to 40% efficiency of MPPs. We analyzed a scalable

    network bandwidth must be at least 2.3 GB/s. This configuration results in 30 to 40%

    This version of the model can run on many different massively parallel computers
    (including a cluster of workstations). The model has been implemented and run on the IBM
    SP and Intel multiprocessors using a columnwise decomposition that supports irregularly
    shaped allocations of the problem to processors. This strategy will facilitate dynamic
    load balancing for improved parallel efficiency and promotes a modular design that
    simplifies the nesting problem. All data communication for finite differencing,
    inter-domain exchange of data, and I/O is encapsulated within a parallel library, RSL.
    Hence, there are no sends or receives in the parallel model itself. The library is
    generalizable to other, similar finite difference approximation codes. The code is
    validated by comparing the rate of growth in error between the sequential and parallel
    models with the error growth rate when the sequential model input is perturbed to simulate
    floating point rounding error. Series of runs on increasing numbers of parallel processors

    direction (which coincides with the affine scaling direction on the central path) gives a
    very accurate approximation to the direction to the minimum. Second, a long step along the
    Newton direction is possible without violating the inequality constraints. </td>
