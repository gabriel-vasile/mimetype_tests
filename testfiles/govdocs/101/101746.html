10 CFR Ch. I

Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions

AGENCY: Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

ACTION: Semiannual regulatory agenda.

_______________________________________________________________________

SUMMARY: The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is publishing its 
semiannual regulatory agenda in accordance with Public Law 96-354, 
``The Regulatory Flexibility Act,'' and Executive Order 12866, 
``Regulatory Planning and Review.'' The agenda is a compilation of all 
rules on which the NRC has recently completed action or has proposed or 
is considering action. This issuance updates any action occurring on 
rules since publication of the last semiannual agenda on May 13, 2002 
(67 FR 34212).

ADDRESSES: Comments on any rule in the agenda may be sent to the 
Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 
Washington, DC 20555-0001, Attention: Rulemakings and Adjudications 
Staff. Comments may also be hand delivered to the One White Flint North 
Building, 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville, Maryland, between 7:30 a.m. 
and 4:15 p.m., Federal workdays. Comments received on rules for which 
the comment period has closed will be considered if it is practical to 
do so, but assurance of consideration cannot be given except as to 
comments received on or before the closure dates specified in the 
agenda.

    The agenda and any comments received on any rule listed in the 
agenda are available for public inspection and copying for a fee at 
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Public Document Room, One White 
Flint North, 11555 Rockville Pike, Room O-1F21, Rockville, 
Maryland.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: For further information concerning NRC 
rulemaking procedures or the status of any rule listed in this agenda, 
contact Michael T. Lesar, Chief, Rules and Directives Branch, Division 
of Administrative Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555-0001, telephone 301-415-
7163 (e-mail: mtl@nrc.gov). Persons outside the Washington, DC, 
metropolitan area may call, toll-free: 1-800-368-5642. For further 
information on the substantive content of any rule listed in the 
agenda, contact the individual listed under the heading ``Agency 
Contact'' for that rule.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The information contained in this semiannual 
publication is updated to reflect any action that has occurred on rules 
since publication of the last NRC semiannual agenda on May 13, 2002 (67 
FR 34212). Within each group, the rules are ordered according to the 
Regulation Identifier Number (RIN).

    The information in this agenda has been updated through 
September 13, 2002. The date for the next scheduled action under 
the heading ``Timetable'' is the date the rule is scheduled to be 
published in the Federal Register. The date is considered tentative 
and is not binding on the Commission or its staff. The agenda is 
intended to provide the public early notice and opportunity to 
participate in the NRC rulemaking process. However, the NRC may 
consider or act on any rulemaking even though it is not included in 
the agenda.

    The NRC agenda lists all open rulemaking actions. Five rules 
affect small entities, one of which may potentially have a 
``significant economic impact on a substantial number of small 
entities'' as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

    Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 13th day of September 2002.

For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC)                 Proposed Rule Stage

_______________________________________________________________________

4239. FITNESS FOR DUTY PROGRAMS

Priority: Substantive, Nonsignificant

Legal Authority: 42 USC 2201; 42 USC 5841

CFR Citation: 10 CFR 26

Legal Deadline: None

Abstract: The proposed rule would amend the Commission's regulations to 
ensure compatibility with the Department of Health and Human Services 
guidelines, reduce unnecessary regulatory burden in some areas, clarify 
the Commission's original intent of the rule, and improve overall 
program effectiveness and efficiency. These revised requirements would 
reduce the industrywide annual cost for all licensees to comply with 
part 26 by approximately $15 million. The rulemaking will address the 
Regulatory Review Group items on audit frequency and annual submittal 
of data. This rulemaking would also address the petition for rulemaking 
submitted by the Virginia Electric and Power Company (VEPCO) (PRM-26-
1). In

[[Page 75634]]

addition, this rulemaking subsumes a previously separate rulemaking, 
Reduction in the Scope of Random Fitness-For-Duty Testing Requirements 
for Nuclear Power Reactor Licensees (part 26)(RIN 3150-AG62). Because 
of the subsumption of this rulemaking and other issues raised in 
response to the earlier proposed rule, a new proposed rule will be 
published.

4240. LESSONS LEARNED FROM DESIGN CERTIFICATION

Priority: Substantive, Nonsignificant

Legal Authority: 42 USC 2201; 42 USC 5841

CFR Citation: 10 CFR 52

Legal Deadline: None

Abstract: The proposed rule would amend the Commission's requirements 
for early site permits, standard design certifications, combined 
licensees for nuclear power plants, and for other licensing processes. 
The amendments are based on the NRC staff's experience with the 
previous design certification reviews and on discussions with 
stakeholders about the early site permit (ESP), design certification, 
and combined license (COL) processes. This action is expected to 
improve the effectiveness of the licensing processes for future 
applicants. The rulemaking also would make conforming clarifications 
and corrections to the NRC's regulations.
The NRC is proposing to reorganize 10 CFR part 52 to establish a 
separate section for each of the seven licensing processes currently 
described in 10 CFR part 52 (early site permits, early site reviews, 
standard design certification, standard design approvals, combined 
licenses, manufacturing licenses, and duplicate design licenses). The 
purpose of this reorganization is to clarify that each licensing 
process has equal standing. In addition, several subparts would be 
reserved for future licensing processes. No substantive changes are 
intended by the incorporation of current appendices M, N, O, and Q into 
the new subparts in 10 CFR part 52.
The NRC is also proposing to retitle 10 CFR part 52 as Additional 
Licensing Processes for Nuclear Power Plants to clarify that the 
licensing processes in 10 CFR part 52 are in addition to and supplement 
the two-step licensing process in 10 CFR part 50 and the license 
renewal process in 10 CFR part 54, and are not limited to the early 
site permit, standard design certification, and combined license 
processes as the current title implies.
The proposed rule would amend section 52.1 to clarify that all seven 
licensing processes are within the scope of 10 CFR part 52. Sections 
within current appendices M, N, O, and Q would also become new sections 
of the revised part. In addition, the proposed rule would reserve 
sections for future licensing processes. In doing so, the NRC hopes to 
convey that 10 CFR part 52 is the preferred location in 10 CFR for 
nuclear power plant licensing processes. The proposed rule subsumed the 
rulemaking, Standardized Plant Designs, Early Review of Sites 
Suitability Issues; Clarifying Amendments (RIN 3150-AE25), that would 
remove redundant appendices M, N, O, and Q from part 50. The part 52 
rulemaking plan (SECY-98-282) was approved by the Commission on January 
14, 1999.

4241. PERFORMANCE-BASED, RISK-INFORMED FIRE PROTECTION

Priority: Substantive, Nonsignificant

Legal Authority: 42 USC 2201; 42 USC 5841

CFR Citation: 10 CFR 50

Legal Deadline: None

Abstract: The proposed rule would address the Commission's direction 
provided in the staff requirements memorandum dated April 1, 1999, to 
establish a performance-based, risk-informed alternative to the NRC's 
existing reactor fire protection requirements through the adoption of 
an industry consensus standard: NFPA 805, Performance-Based Standard 
for Fire Protection for Light Water Reactor Electric Generating Plants. 
The rulemaking plan had been on hold until fall 2001, at which time the 
Nuclear Energy Institute endorsed the rulemaking effort. The schedule 
was reinitiated through an EDO memorandum to the Commission dated 
October 9, 2001. Draft rule language was posted for public comment on 
the NRC Rulemaking Forum Web site on December 20, 2001. Draft proposed 
rule language was posted on the NRC Rulemaking Forum Web site on April 
2, 2002, and again on May 30, 2002, for public information. The 
proposed rule package was provided provided to the Commission on July 
15, 2002 (SECY-02-132).

Priority: Substantive, Nonsignificant

Legal Authority: 42 USC 2201; 42 USC 5841

CFR Citation: 10 CFR 40

Legal Deadline: None

Abstract: The proposed rule would amend the Commission's regulations to 
require NRC approval for transfers from licensees of unimportant 
quantities of source material (less than 0.05 percent by weight) to 
persons exempt from licensing requirements. The objective of this 
proposed action is to ensure that the regulations regarding transfers 
of materials containing low concentrations of source material are 
adequate to protect public health and safety.

licensed nuclear facilities and the transportation of certain types of 
nuclear material. The proposed revisions would change several event 
notification and security reporting requirements to conform, where 
appropriate, to the event reporting requirements in part 50 for 
independent spent fuel storage installation (ISFSI) and monitored 
retrievable storage (MRS) facility licenses to more closely align them 
with those of nuclear reactor facilities. In addition, the proposed 
revisions would change the requirements for when written follow-up 
reports on safeguards events must be submitted. This change would 
affect power reactors, ISFSI's and several other categories of 
facilities that produce, possess, or transport spent fuel or special 
nuclear material. The changes would reduce, consolidate, and remove 
some licensee reporting notifications and lengthen the reporting period 
for other notifications. Some new requirements would also be added to 
permit NRC to effectively carry out its regulatory responsibilities and 
respond to public and media inquiries during emergencies. Overall, the 
proposed changes would help the NRC and its licensees to better focus 
their efforts on the most safety-significant issues and to communicate 
timely information on recent and ongoing events.

Abstract: The proposed rule would amend the Commission's regulations to 
establish thresholds for the control of working hours to ensure that 
working hours in excess of the thresholds are controlled through a 
risk-informed deviation process. This rule would provide significantly 
greater assurance that worker fatigue does not adversely affect the 
operational safety of nuclear power plants. This rulemaking would also 
address a petition for rulemaking submitted by Barry Quigley (PRM-26-

Abstract: The proposed rule would amend the Commission's regulations to 
ensure that decommissioning trust agreements are in a form acceptable 
to the NRC to increase assurance that decommissioning funds will be 
available for their intended purpose, especially in light of economic 
deregulation and restructuring of the electric utility industry. Based 
on past experience with the NRC approval of the transfer of the 
operating licenses of the Three Mile Island Unit 1 and Pilgrim Nuclear 
Power Stations, the staff believes that this rulemaking would expedite 
similar transfers in the future. The staff also intends to develop 
guidance by revising Regulatory Guide 1.159, Assuring the Availability 
of Funds for Decommissioning Nuclear Reactors, that will specify more 
fully the provisions of the decommissioning trust agreements. The final 
rule was submitted to the Commission on May 5, 2002.

4248. RELEASING PART OF A POWER REACTOR SITE OR FACILITY FOR 
UNRESTRICTED USE

Priority: Substantive, Nonsignificant

Legal Authority: 42 USC 2201; 42 USC 5841

CFR Citation: 10 CFR 2; 10 CFR 20; 10 CFR 50

Legal Deadline: None

Abstract: The proposed rule would amend the Commission's regulations by 
adding a new section that would identify the criteria and regulatory 
framework that a licensee would use to request NRC approval for a 
partial site release. The rulemaking would provide additional assurance 
that residual radioactivity would meet the radiological criteria for 
license termination, even if parts of the site were released before a 
licensee submits its license termination plans. The rulemaking would 
clarify that the radiological criteria for unrestricted use apply to a 
partial site release. The rulemaking would not provide for a partial 
site release under restricted conditions. Also, the rulemaking would 
provide for a Subpart 2 hearing if a license amendment involving a 
partial site release is challenged.
The rulemaking would fill a gap identified during the NRC's 
consideration of a technical specification amendment request for the 
Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station to remove a restriction on the 
sale or lease of property within the exclusion area. During the Oyster 
Creek review, the NRC staff concluded that it is possible for a reactor 
licensee to sell land that would reduce the size of its site before the 
license termination criteria would specifically apply to the release of 
the property. If the sale does not involve the transfer of licensed 
material, it would not require NRC approval under current regulations. 
Currently, the NRC must consider changes to the site boundary of a 
reactor site on a case-by-case basis to ensure adequate protection of 
the public and the environment. Because several reactor licensees have 
expressed interest in selling parts of the sites before they receive 
approval of their license termination plans, the NRC staff believes the 
issues should be resolved generically by rulemaking.

Abstract: New editions of the ASME BPV and OM Codes are issued every 
three years and addenda to the editions are issued annually. It has 
been the Commission's policy to update 10 CFR 50.55a to incorporate by 
reference the ASME Code editions and addenda. The ASME publishes code 
cases for Section III and Section XI quarterly, and code cases for the 
OM Code annually. Code cases are generally alternatives to the 
requirements of the ASME BPV Code and the OM Code. It has been the NRC 
staff's practice to review these code cases and find them either 
acceptable, conditionally acceptable, or unacceptable for use by NRC 
licensees. These code cases are then listed in periodically revised 
regulatory guides (RGs), together with information on their 
acceptability. Footnote 6 to 10 CFR 50.55a refers to the RGs listing 
code cases determined by the NRC staff to be ``suitable for use.'' No 
specific data or revision of the RGs is indicated in footnote 6 to 10 
CFR 50.55a. In the past, these RGs have not been approved by the Office 
of the Federal Register for incorporation by reference in the Code of 
Federal Regulations. To address this matter, the staff is proposing 
that the use of ASME Code Cases be approved through a rulemaking 
incorporating by reference the applicable RGs. Thus, NRC-approved code 
cases would be accorded the same legal status as the corresponding 
requirements in the ASME BPV Code and OM Code which are already 
incorporated by reference in the NRC's regulations.

Abstract: The proposed rule would amend the Commission's regulations by 
addressing uranium fuel cycle environmental data (Table S-3) and the 
environmental effects of transportation of fuel and waste data (Table 
S-4). In section 51.51, the environmental data would be reestimated and 
reflect changes in the structure and activities of the fuel cycle and 
the availability of better data. Estimates of releases of Radon-222 and 
Technetium-99 would be added to Table S-3. The addition of a specific 
value for Radon-222 would address the outstanding portion of petition 
for rulemaking PRM-51-1, submitted by the New England Coalition on 
Nuclear Pollution. To provide immediate relief to the petitioner's 
request, the Commission published a final rule on March 14, 1997 (42 FR 
13803), that removed the original value for Radon-222 from Table S-3 so 
that it then became subject to case-specific litigation. It was 
anticipated that the Commission would add a specific value for Radon-
222, but the Commission deferred action until a general updating of 
Table S-3 is undertaken. For section 51.52, the environmental impact 
estimates would be reestimated to reflect the use of more highly 
enriched fuel and discharge of more highly irradiated fuel from a 
reactor; longer onsite storage; and changes in transportation modes, 
transport to retrievable storage sites and a permanent repository 
rather than reprocessing facilities, packaging technology, and 
regulatory standards. The reestimates would incorporate current 
research information and computer codes.
This rulemaking would result in current and more accurate estimates of 
the environmental impact of licensing a new plant, and would eliminate 
the requirement to review the contribution to environmental impacts 
from Radon-222 and Technetium-99 in individual plant reviews. This rule 
is being reissued as a proposed rule and would update the initial 
rulemaking effort to address newly emerging issues and research.

Abstract: The proposed rule would conform the Commission's regulations 
pertaining to the availability of official records to existing case law 
and agency practice. The amendment would address the circumstances 
under which proprietary, personal privacy or other confidential 
information submitted to the NRC by applicants, licensees, or others 
may be returned upon request. The rule would reaffirm that 10 CFR 
2.790(c) provides submitters of information a qualified right to have 
their information returned upon request. This rule would inform the 
public of four additional circumstances where information would not be 
returned to the applicant, that is, (1) when submitted to an advisory 
committee governed by the Federal Advisory Committee Act; (2) when 
captured by a Freedom of Information Act request; (3) when publicly 
relied upon or revealed by the Commission in an open Commission meeting 
under the Government in the Sunshine Act; and (4) when obtained during 
the course of an investigation conducted by the NRC Office of 
Investigations. The

[[Page 75640]]

proposed rule would also clarify requirements on submittals to the NRC 
for identification of confidential information sought to be withheld 
from public disclosure. Further, the proposed amendment would address 
the NRC's procedures for handling copyrighted information, including 
reproduction and distribution according to normal agency practice.

Abstract: The advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) was 
published to request public comment, information, and recommendations 
on contemplated amendments to the Commission's regulations governing 
the release of radionuclides from licensed nuclear facilities into 
sanitary sewer systems. The Commission believes that by incorporating 
current sewer treatment technologies the contemplated rulemaking would 
improve the control of radioactive materials released to sanitary sewer 
systems by licensed nuclear facilities. The NRC and the Environmental 
Protection Agency are conducting a joint survey of sewage treatment 
plants to evaluate the extent of reconcentration due to release of 
radioactive material into sewage systems. The need for and the extent 
of a rulemaking will be evaluated pending the result of the survey and 
the associated dose assessment. This rulemaking would also address a 
petition for rulemaking submitted by the Northeast Ohio Sewer District 
(PRM-20-22).

Abstract: The NRC has issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking 
(ANPRM) to invite early input from affected parties and the public on 
the issues associated with the advance notification of Indian tribes of 
spent fuel shipments. The Department of Energy (DOE) has indicated that 
it intends to comply with NRC's physical protection requirements for 
shipments under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act; however, its current 
practices conflict with NRC regulations. For example, DOE already has 
asked for and will continue to ask for exemptions from the shipment 
itinerary information requirements of foreign research reactor fuel. 
DOE, as a courtesy, provides Indian tribes with notification of spent 
fuel shipments. NRC's current regulations do not address notification 
of Indian tribes. Further, DOE has developed a satellite tracking 
system to monitor the status of spent fuel shipments at all times. 
Distribution of this status information to parties other than 
governors' designees is not compatible with NRC regulations. A 
rulemaking plan was approved by the Commission on February 2, 2001.

Abstract: The advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) invited 
comments, advice, and recommendations from interested parties on the 
contemplated rulemaking that would provide an alternative, risk-
informed approach for special treatment requirements in the current 
regulations. Special treatment requirements are requirements imposed on 
structures, systems, and components (SSCs) that provide additional 
confidence that these SSCs are capable of meeting design basis 
functional requirements. The contemplated risk-informed approach would 
categorize SSCs and vary the associated regulatory treatment based on 
the SSC's safety significance. This action is a result of the 
Commission's continuing efforts to risk-inform its regulations. The 
staff plans to provide the Commission with a proposed rule package in 
September 2002.

4262. INTEGRATED RULEMAKING FOR DECOMMISSIONING NUCLEAR POWER REACTORS

Priority: Substantive, Nonsignificant

Legal Authority: 42 USC 2201; 42 USC 5841

CFR Citation: 10 CFR 50

Legal Deadline: None

Abstract: A staff requirements memorandum dated June 23, 1999, directed 
the NRC staff to consider an integrated, risk-informed decommissioning 
rule rather than individual rulemakings to address emergency 
preparedness, insurance, safeguards, operator staffing, and backfit for 
nuclear power plants that are being decommissioned. SECY-99-168 dated 
June 30, 1999, recommended that the integrated approach be approved and 
outlined staff plans for pursuing such a rulemaking. Accordingly, the 
staff has subsumed previous rulemaking activities in the areas of 
emergency planning, insurance, safeguards, operator staffing, and 
backfit into one integrated rulemaking effort. This rulemaking would 
apply to licensees who certified, pursuant to 10 CFR 50.82(a), that 
they have permanently ceased facility operation(s) and have permanently 
removed fuel from the reactor vessel. The Commission approved this 
approach in an SRM dated December 21, 1999. This rulemaking would also 
address a petition for rulemaking submitted by the North Carolina 
Public Utility Commission (PRM-50-57).
In SECY-00-145, dated June 28, 2000, the NRC staff recommended a 
decommissioning rulemaking plan in the areas of emergency planning, 
insurance, safeguards, operator staffing, and backfit (the integrated 
decommissioning rulemaking plan). The rulemaking plan relied on a draft 
decommissioning risk study as a basis for its recommendations. The 
Commission returned the rulemaking plan to the staff for rework in 
September 2000, based on changes to the decommissioning risk study 
findings. The decommissioning risk study, NUREG-1738, was issued in 
January 2001. After assessing the findings in the risk study, the staff 
presented a policy options paper to the Commission, SECY-01-0100, dated 
June 4, 2001, that provided options and made recommendations on issues 
to be addressed in the integrated rulemaking. Following the terrorist 
events of September 11, 2001, the NRC staff recommended and the 
Commission approved the withdrawal of SECY-01-0101 because of the 
likely changes in the staff's position on decommissioning plant 
safeguards. The decommissioning policy position will be revisited when 
a broad-scope NRC safeguards policy is developed in response to 
potential terrorist acts at nuclear facilities. The schedule for the 
integrated rulemaking cannot be determined at this time.

4276. [bull] COST RECOVERY FOR CONTESTED HEARING INVOLVING U.S. NATIONAL 
SECURITY INITIATIVES

Priority: Substantive, Nonsignificant

Legal Authority: 42 USC 2201; 42 USC 5841

CFR Citation: 10 CFR 170

Legal Deadline: None

Abstract: The final rule amends the Commission's regulations to allow 
recovery of costs associated with contested hearings involving U.S. 
Government national security-related proceedings through licensing or 
other regulatory service fees assessed to the affected applicant or 
licensee. The amendment is a special exemption to the Commission's 
longstanding policy of not charging this type of fee for contested 
hearings and instead recovering the costs through the annual fees 
assessed to licensees within the affected class.

4277. [bull] LIST OF APPROVED SPENT FUEL STORAGE CASKS: HI-STORM 100 
REVISION

Priority: Substantive, Nonsignificant

Legal Authority: 42 USC 2201; 42 USC 5802

CFR Citation: 10 CFR 72

Legal Deadline: None

Abstract: The NRC is amending its regulations revising the Holtic 
International HI-STORM 100 cask system listing within the list of 
approved spent fuel storage casks to include Amendment 1 to Certificate 
of Compliance Number 1014. This rule was originally published as a 
direct final rule (under RIN 3150-AG97), on March 27, 2002 (67 FR 
14627). Because the NRC received a significant adverse comment on the 
direct final rule, the rule was withdrawn (June 7, 2002; 67 FR 39260). 
The significant adverse comment related to concern with (1) 
interactions between the non-fuel hardware and the fuel, and (2) the 
absence of documentation of NRC's analysis to accept the storage of the 
non-fuel hardware. The NRC addressed these comments in a final rule 
published on July 15, 2002 (67 FR 46369).
