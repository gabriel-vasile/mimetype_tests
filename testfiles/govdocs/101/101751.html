  <b><font size="4">Robots in Extreme Radiation Environments, Presented by Charles 
  Neveu</font></b><br>
  <b>1) Why can't internal combustion engines be used in environments containing 
  radioactive dust? </b><br>
  a. Because their filters become contaminated and must be treated as radioactive 
  waste<br>
  b. Because the radioactive dust inhibits the engine from igniting properly<br>
  c. It's too dangerous to try to use anything kind of combustion electronics 
  in any radioactive environment</p>
<p><b>2) Why do high-radiation robots need such heavy tethers? </b><br>

  tether is necessary to ensure that the robot will be pulled back and returned 
  safely.<br>
