<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - August 28-29, 2002</H3>
<P>On August 28-29 the Subcommittee on Standards and Security held the first of
several hearings planned for 2002 and the first-half of 2003 on Patient Medical
Record Information (PMRI) terminologies. The Subcommittee's intent is to make
recommendations next year to the Secretary for next steps related to national
standards in this area. The first day's focus was on the scope of these efforts
and criteria; the second day included discussions with public, private, and
federal consortia on issues of interoperability, PMRI standards, and
terminologies as well as further discussions about issues related to
replacement of ICD-9-CM with ICD-10-CM and ICD-10-PCS, recommendations for next
steps, and a white paper the Subcommittee prepared to the Secretary concerning
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) issues and
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, version 4<I> (</I>DSM-4). During the first
day, the Subcommittee heard 14 presentations and held discussions on
terminology standards. The second day, eight presenters testified on
coordination of ongoing national healthcare standards initiatives, standards
implementation in the United Kingdom (U.K.), and transitioning to new code sets
</P>
<P><B>Agenda Item: Overview</B></P>
<P>Mr. Blair noted the testifiers would provide feedback on the Subcommittee's
proposed scope and whether the criteria for selection were appropriate,
pragmatic, realistic and sufficient. Both were derived from the Committee's
July 2000 report to the Secretary that set forth priorities for going forward
with PMRI standard recommendations and a set of 10 recommendations including
the selection of standards. The report also addressed accelerating development
of PMRI standards and guiding principles for selection as well as other
guidances the Subcommittee applied to PMRI terminology. In February 2002, the
Committee applied these guiding principles to the selection of PMRI message
format standards and made recommendations. </P>

<P>Dr. Chute applauded the preliminary criteria and validatedthe Committee's
efforts on creating multi-purpose roles, recognizing terminologies, outlining
reasonable starting domains, and collating common criteria. He reviewed
motivational issues associated with development of terminology in patient
medical records supporting his recommendations for augmenting the criteria and
scope. Noting a major purpose of a terminology was to capture symptoms,
findings, events and interventions with sufficient detail and specificity to
use them in decision support, information retrieval and recognition, Dr. Chute
emphasized keeping these use cases separate from their format and structure. In
parallel with detailed specific nomenclatures, he noted the need to aggregate
this information characteristically by way of high-level classifications, thus
enabling accurate, reproducible groupings of information for various purposes,
including fiscal reimbursement management issues. Dr. Chute proposed rethinking
the notion of a continuum of terminology from a detailed nomenclature to a
classification into a more broadly based one-size-no-longer-fit-all approach. 
</P>
<P>Noting the idea that an underlying nomenclature could have detailed specific
patient information and extend along a common continuum to higher level
classifications or groups had been perceived as a fairly linear, uniform and
single-dimensional problem, Dr. Chute proposed a more complex use case with
needs in decision support and error detection, public health and surveillance,
reimbursement and management, outcome and epidemiology. He suggested publishing
proposed aggregation logics as a component of their attached classifications.
Dr. Chute concluded that, whatever they did, they'd confront significant
challenges. He said the impact on vendors would be considerable and everyone
would have to select from what was available today or supporting development
along lines of content, authoring environments, and newly described aggregation
and description logics.</P>
<P>American Nurses Association (ANA) recommended renaming the
&quot;Procedures&quot; category &quot;Interventions&quot; and categorizing
terminologies by multiple dimensions accounting for domain coverage, primary
purpose and the terminologies' underlying semantic structure. Dr. Bakken
identified an expanded list of data nursing codes and advised that the criteria
for selection of PMRI terminologies be tailored to the terminologies and
include documented testing of reliability, validity and clinical utility. She
emphasized clarifying criteria related to each type of semantic structure,
especially clinically specific (concept-oriented) terminologies. Dr. Bakken
stressed the importance of identifying terminology characteristics or abilities
from those provided by models or supporting software. And she noted that a
reference terminology model (ISO, 2002) that integrated nursing concepts and
enabled ANA to meet the notion of finely detailed clinical specifications and
rules engines that support the description logic was proposed as a draft
International Standard. </P>
<P>Dr. Price said the U.K.'s National Health Service (NHS) had taken more
centralist control of implementation to achieve aggressive targets for 2005.
NHS had remained committed to a single comprehensive scheme (i.e., SNOMED CT)
since 1992 and invested $3,000,000 in 2002 to lay the foundation for
implementation. Dr. Price offered suggestions for classification of
terminologies that fit NHS' worldview and noted NHS believed the provision of
extension, subset and mapping mechanisms addressed counter-arguments to
comprehensive schemes. Dr. Price said a global business model needed to be
open, contributory, non-predatory and underpinned by central (government)
support. He emphasized that terminology wasn't an end in itself, but was needed
to add value.</P>
<P>Dr. Nelson addressed a number of areas that needed strengthening
(terminologies, atomic concepts, relationships, priorities, pricing and the
maintenance process) and encouraged the Subcommittee to recognize distinct uses
of the terminology rather than focus on a continuum. He encouraged them to
consider terminologies in terms of the level of discourse and areas covered.
Observing that the level of discourse determined atomicity, Dr. Nelson noted
the difficulty of defining atomic concepts when the level kept changing and
suggested what they sought was a post-coordinated expression for anything
greater than their current level of discourse. He emphasized that terminologies
had to have representational integrity and that the biggest priority was
patient safety. </P>
<P>Medicomp's biggest challenge was the human interface and concept processing
at a clinical, rather than strictly terminological level that accommodated the
clinical thought process without interfering with it. He said a hierarchy of
pre-coordinated concepts enabled assignment of predictable properties and that
the combination of fully expressed clinical concepts and predictable properties
gave software developers the means to build applications for clinical
documentation and decision support at the point of care. Mr. Lareau urged the
Subcommittee to accommodate terminology needs of healthcare providers at the
point of care. He emphasized the importance in defining the scope of PMRI
terminologies to consider the role of the patient. Considering priorities for
the selection process, Mr. Lareau noted much of the healthcare reimbursement
structure was based on diagnosis, procedure, drug and laboratory codes, and
changes in terminology requirements for these systems might be significant. He
said terminologies directly affecting current, widely implemented processes
should have highest priority to avoid push back from vendors. Mr. Lareau
suggested the Subcommittee consider that terminologies might require fully
expressed combinatorial clinical concepts in order to be actionable at the
point of care and shouldn't be limited to purely atomic terms.</P>

<P>Considering PMRI terminologies, Dr. Berglund noted convergence could imply
combining multiple systems (doubtful at this time) or enabling interworking
between systems and interoperation. Noting code sets weren't the same as data
sets and message formats differed from codes, he advised considering them
separately, based on their criteria. Noting HL7 and X12N weren't code sets, but
specifications for messaging formats, he suggested distinguishing them from
codes in terminologies. Dr. Berglund identified other groups and terminologies
for the Subcommittee to consider. Noting standards for messaging, diagnosis,
and procedure codes were specified and widely used, he advised giving them
priority for PMRI selection. He urged expeditiously specifying the move to
ICD-10-CM. Citing the need for clinically specific codes to represent more
detailed information, he recommended giving them first priority among groups
without specified standards. Drug and nursing codes were also needed. A single
standard might not be feasible and continued use of different systems might be
reasonable. Discussing changes to preliminary criteria for selection of PMRI
terminologies, Dr. Berglund said different criteria were needed for different
groups or subsets; selection criteria for messaging formats and data sets
should differ from those for terminologies, and classification systems intended
to aggregate should have different criteria than clinically specific code
systems. </P>
<P>Dr. Brown said the Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA) found the
organization of some of the PMRI terminologies subsets variable and suggested a
domain orientation for a schema. He also questioned the &quot;convergence&quot;
subset. DVA believed a single terminology wouldn't serve all needs and
convergence was more likely to occur as incremental steps among interlocking
terminologies with complementary content. Noting the administration's need for
DVA-specific codes, Dr. Brown said DVA and Department of Defense (DoD) had
standards that could be integrated into the proposed interlocking set of
complimentary terminologies and he recommended that resources be devoted to
developing those code sets as needed. DVA believed interlocking terminology
sets relating to the domains of medications, laboratory and problems should
have highest priority. Dr. Brown identified additional criteria for selecting
PMRI terminologies. DVA didn't believe market place acceptance equated to the
types of aggregation or quality needed at the point of contact, and new
developments should be encouraged if they supported decision-making, patient
care quality and safety. Discussing the relationship to other terminologies,
Dr. Brown said semi- and automated mapping were the goal and explicit semantic
models were a step toward achieving that mapping. He noted aggregation's
importance in managing assets and doing population studies. Dr. Mike Lincoln
added that mapping was critically important for the DVA's HDR program. </P>
<P>Capt. Kelly said DoD could live with the grouping of the subsets of PMRI
terminologies, but he added that grouping weren't as critical as the need to
play well together. He noted that DoD used CDT-3 as its dental standard and
would prefer CDT-3 to CDP-2. And he pointed out to the Subcommittee that the
lack of an accepted standard for identifying individuals and their key role
(patient, provider) impeded progress toward implementing a PMRI. While DoD had
difficulty understanding what was meant by the convergence code set, Capt.
Kelly agreed that message and clinically specific code sets were most
important. DoD encouraged use of repeatable model-based processes and tools to
create and define terminologies, concepts, and relationships between concepts.
Capt. Kelly said relationships among concepts should not only be explicitly
defined, internally consistent, and non-redundant--but, also, model based. DoD
encouraged future development of complex terminology using model-based
development. While DoD didn't believe the ANSI umbrella of organizations was
essential, Capt. Kelly said it added credibility and structure and DoD
supported the ANSI consensus process for voting/balloting on the acceptance of
new versions of a standard.</P>
<P>Observing that the categorizations of the terminologies the testifiers were
asked to talk about seemed self-expressed by the terminology developers, Dr.
Elkin suggested a more appropriate way. He noted five speakers alluded to
similar issues and their need for these levels of details for underlying
clinical knowledge, aggregations for DRGs, clinical codes, ICD and a network
view. Dr. Elkin said he saw that network view as the decision support that
indicated where on the linear scale one wished to be. He noted a tradeoff
between complexity and expressivity with compositional systems. Dr. Elkin
recommended adding several new terminologies. He noted that clinical
terminologies were becoming robust enough for clinical use. And he pointed out
that there was an ANSI standard, ASTM E2087, for creating the right sets of
quality indicators for determining PMRI terminologies. </P>
<P>Dr. Elkin emphasized that terminologies should be evaluated within their
purpose and scope. He noted the importance of knowing what terminologies were
pre-mapped to, could and couldn't map to. He said normalization of content
assured that the same terms or concepts within the terminology would be
identified. Normalization of semantics assured there wasn't semantic overlap
between semantic operators, preventing semantic drift. With multiple
hierarchies, it was important to determine if consistency of view supported
explicit uncertainty. How evolving definitions were supported over time also
was important to meaning; so was ensuring that representational form didn't
influence the usefulness of the terminology or hierarchies. Dr. Elkin also
posed a number of questions around purpose and scope. </P>
<P>Dr. Spackman concurred that, from a user perspective, there were two main
ways to categorize PMRI terminologies: comprehensive, integrated clinical
terminologies and other clinical terminologies of limited scope. Users needed a
comprehensive, integrated whole. Their requirements should be prioritized and
terminologies should be grouped according to that perspective. Recalling
testifiers didn't understand &quot;convergence,&quot; but advocated
interlocking, Dr. Spackman suggested they were the same: work that had to be
done to meet the user requirement for interoperability. He outlined five main
categories of user requirements for PMRI terminology and said they couldn't be
met by merely a collection of complementary PMRI terminologies but required an
integrated whole. He identified a number of reasons why integration was
necessary. Considering cost as a criterion, Dr. Spackman noted that without an
integrated terminology, the opportunity and incremental costs of system
development and maintenance were orders of magnitude greater. The quality of
health care was linked to an ability to mobilize technology and an assumption
of interoperability that they didn't have without an integrated standard PMRI
terminology.(Vendor opinion -- delete)</P>
<P>Dr. Spackman illustrated with a diagram how SNOMED CT served as a convergent
terminology and others either fully or partially integrated or mapped from it.
He acknowledged that SNOMED needed to be integrated with the core reference
terminology. He agreed on the need to map core clinical concepts to
classifications and proposed building subsets and extensions to support linkage
or modeling of domain- and use-limited terminologies. He urged the Committee to
focus on continuous improvement and deployment of a core. Dr. Spackman told the
Committee it could make major steps forward if it required a proven maintenance
infrastructure, prevented analysis paralysis and disruption of a forward trend
with industry and providers. The marketplace was moving to deploy SNOMED CT and
he said clinicians, researchers and the public could reap the benefits. </P>

</UL>
<P>Dr. Campbell recounted how 10 years ago the Institute of Medicine portrayed
the computer-based patient record, a vision resting upon a model with
deliverables requiring coded or control terminology for functionality.
Considerable work was done on messaging interoperability, and associated
reference terminologies and technologies emerged. Dr. Campbell hoped they'd
discuss today the path to achieving that vision, by creating what the
Subcommittee termed semantic interoperability. Dr. Campbell suggested the path
began by looking not just at available codes, but the architectures employing
them. He encouraged considering adopting a model comprised of three layers, the
core being the clinical and the outer layer the external or public/ government
layer. The core was a reference terminology and its deliverables were decision
support that could be shared. The second layer was comprised of modeled code,
legacy term sets, and other systems necessary to the clinical function of the
CPR, modeled on a negotiated basis with a clinical reference core, within the
construction of an information model. The third layer was administrative and
governmental layer, with interfaces and a variety of users with important but
primarily non-clinical needs for CPR data. </P>
<P>The core convergence reference terminology was designed to be comprehensive
across everything needed for multidisciplinary clinical care. Its primary
editorial policies were clinical. Preferably, it was maintained by an SDO with
clinical professional societies overseeing its sophisticated clinical content.
Layer two's features were modeled codes that integrated important clinical
terminology and served departmental, special purpose, messaging systems,
professional and interface terminologies. Features were constructed using the
reference core, but modeled into the context and behavior required based upon
the original legacy owner's meaning values. A dialogue between the reference
terminology and modeled code sets was essential for a successful model. Layer
three was code sets required for administration, finances, billing and
epidemiology. It followed editing rules promulgated by organizations needing
them, was maintained in a different way, and held to other standards. Dr.
Campbell proposed three major priorities: (1) a collaborative strategy to
define a core reference terminology to serve clinical medicine, (2)
establishing knowledge-based solid mapping from the reference core to the third
layer, and (3) instituting changes in clinical content coverage within layer
two. Dr. Campbell offered observations about criteria for code or terminology
selection in each layer. And he noted that, from an administrative perspective,
completeness was at the third layer, while clinically, completeness was in the
inner two layers holding the reference terminology and its cooperating model
systems. </P>
<P>Dr. Campbell suggested that core reference terminology developers must have
cooperative agreements with layer two developers so content and editorial
evolution were orderly and cohesive. He suggested that the Subcommittee
consider development of reference information for definition of complex and
content-laden concepts and identifying an SDO to maintain the model.
Considering concept orientation, Dr. Campbell noted the Committee had done much
to address reference terminology issues. Noting many of those criteria couldn't
be applied to layer three, because they had no control over those
terminologies, he emphasized that reference terminology relationships within
the core must be sufficient in definition and scope to support clinical
guideline implementation. Dr. Campbell believed core terminologies provided
domain content to support complete clinical reference terminology and layer two
terminologies modeled, defined, and enhanced important legacy and departmental
classifications and terminologies. Both mapped to layer three terminologies to
support reimbursement and statistical classifications. </P>
<P>Ms. Haber remarked on a historical disconnect of data collection priorities
and methods. She noted NCI had an inheritance of legacy systems. Achieving
connectivity between established mission critical systems involved complex
issues of data conversion, storage, and retrieval. Health information models
changed with cancer and healthcare shifting emphasis from treatment to
prevention, rapid transformation of disease models to genetic and molecular
classifications, and the pace of change in science, technology and methodology.
Vocabulary content and structure had to quickly reflect these advances while
permitting identifications and retrievals from earlier systems and vocabulary
versions.</P>
<P>Noting the challenge of addressing knowledge systems at the broader level of
standardized PMRI, Ms. Haber said linking related concepts in the fields of
population, genetics, developmental therapies, and disease was essential to
NCI's mission and this ongoing transformation meant any proposed information
model not incorporating the assumption of frequent change would fail.
Vocabulary standards had to insure adaptability of a terminology or information
model to incorporate intellectual content changes. The capability, commitment,
and funding to support frequent and regular cycles and the flexibility of a
terminology structure to map readily to other major component vocabularies were
perhaps even more important indicators of the ultimate success of a standard
vocabulary than its contents.</P>
<P>Ms. Haber recommended that the PMRI selection process accord priority to
terminology development efforts linked to and integrated with related clinical
document architecture, format, and messaging standards (e.g., HL7 vocabulary
standards development process). She added that vocabulary sources should have
explicit, defined, and regular processes for technical and content quality
review and assurance. </P>
<P>Dr. Overhage found the categorization of codes the Committee proposed in its
August 2000 report to the Secretary difficult to work with in terms of
segregating out queries to aid in analyzing these domains. Dr. Overhage advised
it was more useful to take an object-oriented or entity approach. Whatever they
did with these terminologies, both the clinical processes and other uses of the
data had to be pulled together. In discussing terminologies, Dr. Overhage noted
they often talked about multiple things. Typically, at least three levels or
subdomains of terminologies were conceptually needed for any domain. Commenting
on criteria for viewing different terminologies, Dr. Overhage noted they'd
heard one criterion was the terminology be relatively inexpensive to acquire
and implement. He emphasized the importance of acceptance in the marketplace.
Some ways to prioritize were by: the quantity of electronically available data,
relative global value of that domain or data, and terminologies that were
&quot;good enough places to start.&quot; He said the Logical Object Identifier
Numerical Coding System (LOINC) was a potential candidate terminology, at least
for the laboratory domain, and reviewed ways it succeeded. Dr. Overhage
emphasized the importance of keeping terminology domains conceptually pure and
clinical processes connected. Mapping could be a partial, always risky and
difficult-to-maintain answer. Differentiating concepts and structures was
another way. </P>
<P>Two years ago AMA commissioned a study identifying a comprehensive list of
core clinical data elements for electronic medical record systems. Mr. Beebe
recommended the Committee prioritize the PMRI terminologies based on current
use, practical applications and marketplace acceptance, as well as each
system's benefits. AMA believed the criteria were acceptable, however Mr. Beebe
said the criteria should be divided into essential and desirable, and different
domains should be considered. He noted the four criteria derived from the PMRI
guiding principles applied to PMRI terminologies. AMA believed that PMRI
terminology maintainers should meet the guiding principles expected of current
maintainers of the selected standards. Mr. Beebe suggested development of PMRI
standards must focus on market acceptance and clinical needs. He noted the
Committee's responsibilities were fundamentally different than for HIPAA
administrative transactions: no federal legislation required implementation of
PMRI standards or code sets that applied to such standards.</P>
<P><B>Discussion on Terminology</B></P>
<P>Dr. Cohn noted the Subcommittee had a day in October and a day in December
for more input and will schedule time in 2003. They intended to have a letter
for the Secretary by the June meeting. Whether they had a draft by their
March-April deadline depended on the complexity of the information gathering. 
</P>
<P>Mr. Blair noted they'd heard testimony on the scope, including suggestions
for a different perspective, and feedback on criteria for selection,
priorities, and whether everything should be ANSI-accredited. The testimony
didn't diverge much from the criteria for selection, though it might be divided
into different categories and Mr. Beebe considered it an editorial of
desirables. Mr. Blair will shape the hard-copy testimony into a matrix and
clarify Dr. Overhage's and Dr. Campbell's models and information. The
Subcommittee will review the input in October. They'd heard testimony on the
scope and criteria for selection. Mr. Blair noted they had to decide how and
when to gather information from terminology developers so they could match it
against criteria. He noted many issues were more complex than with the message
format standards and they'd need assistance from a consultant with medical
terminology expertise. In October they'd identify criteria and further
questions. November-December, they'd hear from terminology developers.
January-March, users will testify. Hopefully, in March-April they'd look at a
draft. </P>
<P>Dr. Cohn addressed the business case. Themes included lab terminology and
drugs. The next hearing might provide an update on the DVA-NLM-FDA effort.
Other pieces were what payers, providers and vendors considered high-value and
an IOM activity looking at patient safety data standards they'd hear about this
fall. Dr. McDonald suggested sending the mailing to developers of the codes as
well as message developers. Mr. Blair will compile a derivative of the
testimony and a draft of the questionnaire to look at in October. </P>
<P>Given the testimony, Dr. Cohn suggested they'd end up with more insight on
potential criteria and approach than the issues of scope and high value. Dr.
Yasnoff agreed that business case issues for vocabulary were more difficult;
whatever their recommendations, expenditures would be much larger than for
message format standards. He suggested a business consultant do a formal
analysis of the business case for development and maintenance of a PMRI
terminology and user cost of implementation. Dr. Yasnoff noted several business
cases. </P>
<P>Though long-term benefits were hard to quantify, Mr. Augustine predicted
that standard terminology would be increasingly important with health care
inflation in double digits and baby boomers eligible for Medicare. Dr. Cohn
asked Mr. Augustine to work on this model. Mr. Blair noted the business case
wasn't just the cost in expenses and maintenance, but also value. Dr. Yasnoff
suggested recounting how much DVA and DOD spent developing vocabularies; costs
that standardized terminology could avoid. Dr. Steindel noted they'd review a
lot of this data in the CHI initiative. He predicted that much of the business
case's justification would be the non-quantifiable opportunity costs of not
doing this. Mr. Augustine said another way to bolster the business case, though
it too wasn't quantifiable, was with examples of what could be done: instead of
referencing ICD-9-CM and Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes (an inexact
science), one could see physician practice patterns in the aggregate across the
health system, bolstering opportunities technologically on the research side
and for fine-tuning reimbursement systems.</P>
<P>Dr. McDonald revisited the question of the Subcommittee's end game. He
believed they were talking about turning text into codes, which assumed either
extensive labor activity or progress in natural language processing, and
proposed considering both in this analysis. Dr. Cohn suggested considering the
issue of short-term versus long-term and dealing with Dr. McDonald's point
about things ambiguous and uncertain. Dr. McDonald observed finding slots for
what moved around was less of a leap. Noting people were making large
investments in longer-range solutions, Dr. Cohn said a case could be made for
cost-and-time effective ways to provide more decision support or data capture
capability. Dr. McDonald concurred, but rather than entail huge changes in
process or spend substantial funds before anyone succeeded, he encouraged using
vocabularies richly. Mr. Blair recalled that during the decision process on
message format standards, an extremely compelling point was how vendors and end
users had invested heavily in HL7. Dr. McDonald agreed the Subcommittee should
hear their testimony. </P>
<P>Dr. Steindel addressed the scope of the letter. NHS spent over 13 years
developing the U.K.'s terminology model and the system's first round of testing
was still a year away. The Subcommittee was told only one terminology was
&quot;out there&quot;; Dr. Steindel asked where the good-use cases were. He
emphasized the need to determine what to concretely propose in the letter and
models, noting CHI grappled with that question and that they'd heard about low
hanging fruit. </P>
<P>Dr. Steindel noted Dr. Campbell had just introduced his way of looking at
terminology and the informatics community hadn't had time to discuss how it fit
in with everything else. He suggested the Subcommittee do as they'd intended
and define criteria for a questionnaire aimed at people developing
terminologies, and ask vendors how to meet selection criteria. Dr. Steindel
said they needed to determine the extent of overlap and confirm these groupings
made sense. He said the Subcommittee might want to devote time to discussing
all they'd heard. Dr. Cohn proposed that they needed to hear from vendors and
potential users, ensuring everyone thought the same and shared priorities. He
agreed that, based on what they'd heard, a strong business case had to be
associated with everything. He suggested they might decide tomorrow to leverage
what they learned CHI might be doing. </P>
<P>Dr. Yasnoff emphasized that a more formal approach to the business case was
an essential underpinning to making the right recommendations and provided a
rationale and substantial backing for those choices. Dr. Fitzmaurice summarized
what he'd heard: overall the criteria were right, most candidate codes had
usage and, depending on scope, there'd be different criteria for various
aspects, everybody said start either with labs or drugs, they'd heard much
about economics of terminologies, a vision of interoperability was built on
terminology adding value to databases and value added to legacy systems as one
mapped to research, syntheses or clinical practice guidelines, nursing codes
could be used to improving health care processes, determining the value of
mapping, many criteria dealt with quality of codes and terminologies,
terminologies weren't independent in the long run, timeliness was an issue, and
the value (relative to cost) of a piecemeal versus whole terminology approach. 
</P>
<P>Mr. Blair noted that Dr. Campbell and others proposed, even with a
stair-step approach, giving priority to the clinically specific core. He'd
heard Dr. Campbell propose an alternate way of organizing the scope model. Dr.
Fitzmaurice depicted it as having everything that helped care for a patient in
the middle; beyond that were departments organized around taking care of
patients. Outside that was administration and infrastructure. Mr. Blair agreed.
He added that Dr. Campbell had looked at the scope the Subcommittee offered as
a starting point and responded that his representation was a better way to
view, organize and prioritize. Dr. Fitzmaurice saw many relationships in Dr.
Campbell's inner core. Dr. Fitzmaurice reflected that the vision around the
table of what they wanted to do with terminology and codes was constant. But he
suggested the time it would take to describe and show relationships would be
best spent following a piecemeal approach choosing standards and building the
core. Dr. McDonald noted they were about to pick ICD-10- PCS, a clinical code
set; operationally, this next year they'd be piecemealing. Dr. Fitzmaurice
encouraged using Dr. Campbell's model as a concept with a piecemeal approach to
individual standards, and not worry about it fitting into Dr. Campbell's center
core. </P>
<P>Dr. Steindel recalled Dr. Overhage's comments that Dr. Campbell's model
could be built in pieces and looked at from a structural point of view of how
select parts fit together in the various layers. Dr. Steindel contended that
Dr. Campbell's model required a way of thinking they weren't prepared for. It
had many places to hang concepts, but he didn't know where the hooks were, only
that there were things he could put on them. Ms. Greenberg concurred it would
be premature to embrace. She questioned the underlying assumption that
components in the external layer lacked clinical meaning or utility; Dr.
McDonald agreed that many administrative components were rich with clinical
data. Ms. Greenberg said, right now, there was only one reference terminology,
and many could embrace consistency and some reference terminology with either
mapping or models. Dr. Steindel agreed, adding he wasn't sure there was a third
layer. Dr. Yasnoff depicted the model with reference terminology at the core
and a layer around it of compound concepts and terms from the reference
terminology. The third layer was aggregations of simple and compound concepts
into higher-level terms. He suggested the Subcommittee ask others to look at
the model and convey their view of its utility, significance and value at the
next meeting. Dr. Cohn agreed that other testifiers' comments might be useful. 
</P>
<P>Dr. McDonald cautioned that political/social decisions might not create what
they wanted. He suggested some things (e.g., ICD-9-CM) were ripest and used
everywhere. Expressing concern that the Committee had said in a previous letter
that the HL7 RIM should be the core, Dr. McDonald urged they resolve where the
first modeling occurred and bless level three components already making
progress. </P>
<P>Dr. Cohn said the Subcommittee had to contemplate the core model and
whether, as Dr. McDonald queried, it was the HL7 RIM or this conceptual model.
They'd talked a lot about terminology versus information models, but still
needed a way to describe the core model that helped everyone. While the HL7 RIM
might be the information model, Mr. Blair noted Dr. Campbell proposed
considering a semantic interoperability model. He recalled that the
Subcommittee indicated in its message format recommendations that all other
message format standards had to coordinate or harmonize with the HL7 RIM,
because interoperability was driven by the RIM for message format securities.
He noted they had to discuss whether all terminology should be derivatives of
the HL7 RIM. </P>
<P>Dr. McDonald said the question was whether they decided the vocabulary fit
together in some abstract sense or chose a process identifying what was sent
and where and ensured there were places in the vocabulary model describing what
went there. Mr. Blair noted Dr. Overhage felt, pragmatically, they'd move
faster if they determined the terminologies needed to be clinically specific
and drove down from the RIM; Dr. Campbell was saying other health care
information objectives besides messaging benefited from his model. Dr. Elkin
suggested there were two options for merging the information and terminology
models that allowed semantic interoperability: either they agreed to be
non-overlapping and coordinated or, wherever they overlapped, they had to be
identical. Dr. McDonald cautioned about assuming success with the model
building on its own with vocabularists, noting they had to think about object
structures and what made messages interoperable. </P>
<P>Dr. McDonald noted a database was needed to connect the vocabularies
together. Members discussed gaining input from HL7's vocabulary SIG, Jim
Cimino, and RIM. The next step was to standardize vocabulary, which could get a
lot of &quot;bang for the buck.&quot; They still had to decide who provided
that standard, but scope should be decided based on the law, what was already
done, and what came next. Mr. Blair agreed, but expressed concern about a sense
of urgency to move parallel with semantic interoperability. Dr. Cohn asked if
the answer was to at least do one and as much of the other as possible. Dr.
McDonald queried whether the Committee should standardize this or encourage the
industry to provide it. He noted messages needed common vocabulary notes and
fields, so all machines could use them. Once they got down to the right
terminology, Dr. Steindel noted there was agreement. He recalled Dr. Elkin
saying the information and terminology models overlapped. Part of the
terminology model fit into, but wasn't covered, in the information model. They
needed a &quot;grammar&quot; on how to combine those bits. Dr. McDonald noted
grammar could be inserted, but most places sought bigger code. </P>
<P>Dr. Steindel encouraged suspending the information-versus-terminology-model
mindset, emphasizing a continuum and the reality that some things (e.g., Dr.
Campbell's medical guidelines project and CDC's public health case definitions)
had to be combined to realize all the expressions. Noting they'd hear in
October about an interface piece and opportunities, but adding that the
profession had talked about this a long time and that the next day a
coalescence of groups would be looking to them to get something on paper,
members discussed listening to all the ideas and then, drawing upon abstract
principles and &quot;a boot strap,&quot; propose a scope. Members discussed the
need for a consultant to compile and analyze feedback from terminology
developers and provide an appropriate business analysis. Mr. Blair asked for
names of people who met the criteria. </P>
<P>Observing that people worked on standards development and other healthcare
initiatives from a broad range of perspectives and might not be familiar with
other initiatives out there, Mr. Blair and Dr. Steindel provided a quick
glimpse at organizations that promoted, developed and coordinated healthcare
information standards. Everyone encountered different terms (electronic health
records, electronic patient records, computer-based patient records) and some
definitions were based on usage and experience, rather than academic specific
definitions easily referenced. HIPAA used patient medical record information.
Some private sector major SDOs were noted, along with initiatives involved in
facilitating, promoting or coordinating standards in the private sector, as
well as participating government agencies. Mr. Blair presented a time line and
posed questions, including whether new standards or healthcare initiatives
addressed: (1) new problems and approaches, (2) known problems with a new
perspective, (3) problems with new methods or technologies, (4) known problems
with greater industry support or energy. Other major questions were how these
standards initiatives related to others and how they fit into the National
Health Information Infrastructure (NHII) that the Committee and other
organizations proposed and worked on in similar initiatives.</P>

</UL>
<P>Dr. Hammond said the public-private collaborative, Connecting for Health's,
purpose was to catalyze specific actions that rapidly cleared the way for an
interconnected, electronic health information infrastructure. He identified
three basic components: accelerating adoption of clinical data standards,
sharing best practices for secure and private transmission of medical
information, and understanding what health care consumers need and expect from
an interconnected, electronic health information infrastructure. Through
Connecting for Health, people from previously independent, vertical silos of
activity were talking and engaging as they defined the process of producing,
collecting and using data for healthcare in a way usable for multiple purposes.
Recognizing this was a huge, difficult task requiring priorities, they
crosswalked priority data needs to the operable standards while initiating work
on strategies to move other standards into play to deliver required data to all
stakeholders. </P>
<P>Next steps for the Data Standards Working Group include: accelerating
adoption of required data standards under development, articulating the need
for standards not underway, making recommendations about terminology,
developing strategies to clear barriers and accelerate adoption of a priority
&quot;operable set&quot; of standards, and articulating the road to
interoperability. Connecting for Health's interactions with PMRI include
providing a forum for data users, systems developers, and clinical care
providers; engaging in a dialogue about possible/doable/desirable and
developing consensus; and facilitating adoption and rapid implementation of six
data standards.</P>
<P>Identifying three interlocking HL7 standards he considered mature enough to
use: the Reference Information Model (RIM); the Data Interchange Model; and
level 1 of Clinical Documents, Dr. Hammond discussed how standards fit together
and that understanding how they merged made it possible to produce standards
more powerful than any viewed independently. Dr. Hammond noted plans for
addressing gaps. He said standards groups and experts actively collaborated
through overlapping involvement and communication with other initiatives. Many
people realized the problem needed to be dealt with and most were moving in the
same direction. Dr. Hammond suggested the Committee had a responsibility to
help them work together and avoid redundancy. </P>
<P>The Consolidated Health Informatics Initiative (CHI), a government-wide
initiative focused on health information interoperability standards in the
federal healthcare arena, originated in GCPR, which the Subcommittee serves as
an advisor. Some 20 partnering agencies, including agencies within HHS as well
as DVA, DoD, the Department of State and Social Security, participate. About
100 medical, technical, policy and management experts are involved. CHI's goal
was to establish federal health information interoperability standards as the
basis for electronic health data transfer in every activity and project inside
all health-related federal agencies. CHI sought to work with SDOs and industry
to identify and get sign-off on mature standards. Dr. Kolodner expressed he
hoped the federal government's adoption would create a tipping point and the
private sector, judging those standards will be around and even more widely
accepted, will voluntarily adopt them. He discussed a complementary activity,
HealthePeople federal, and how DVA and DoD committed to activities that,
ultimately, will result in their repositories of data for beneficiaries being
based on the same standards and data models and the ability to exchange
information as appropriate. </P>
<P>Ms. Love observed that health data systems formed the physical foundation of
NHII and that often data wasn't a line item of high priority in state budgets.
She noted limitations in the Uniform Hospital Discharge Dataset (UHDDS) upon
which many states base their reporting systems. States had 50 versions of the
UB-92 format adapted to their individual needs. National Association of Health
Data Organizations (NAHDO) identified high priority data elements for the
states and worked with the Public Health Data Standards Consortium and states
to integrate a national standard that reflected what states collected. Noting
states worked to supplement weaknesses of the UB-92 and that the claims
attachment was mandated by HIPAA, Ms. Love suggested it offered an opportunity,
near term, to understand how clinical data elements could be automated,
captured and sent to a government agency. </P>
<P>Ms. Love discussed lessons NAHDO learned with administrative data that
applied to mining and extracting data from the medical record, noting that the
magnitude now faced would be greater: (1) state laws varied and members
creatively addressed privacy and confidentiality concerns, (2) data wasn't
perfect, but with concerted effort improved over time, (3) data collection
priorities weren't without cost, the business case had to be made and everyone
had to work together, (4) defining how data would be collected and used built
trust, (5) analytic infrastructure was critical, (6) who paid was a huge
concern for data agencies, and (7) comparability across provider systems and
states had to be addressed.</P>
<P>Ms. Love expressed confidence in technical solutions and bringing everything
together, saying it boiled down to leadership, building trust and money. Ms.
Love encouraged the Committee to continue defining minimum core data needs for
external reporting. She advised it was critical that the Committee frame a
message at the state level about the societal good of clinical information to
the public. And she recommended linking the Public Health Data Standards
Consortium's recommendations with the Committee. Ms. Love pleaded to make
administrative outpatient data development and standardization a priority
across HHS. </P>
<P>Mr. Reese said the founders of National Alliance for Health Information
Technology (NAHIT) believed it was time for the field to engage in the
standards discussion. CEOs and COOs of provider organizations realized patient
safety couldn't be solved without the integration of complex computer systems
and that employee recruiting and retention required computerization and
workflow management in order to improve daily work life. Capacity management
was another factor: more efficiency and precision were needed to gain
throughput and better integrate hospitals, rehab facilities, long-term and home
care. Mr. Reese identified issues driving healthcare leadership in the field to
pay attention to standards issues and provide AHA with support to spawn the
national alliance. </P>
<P>Mr. Reese described experiences, which enabled Sentara to better utilize
labor distribution and provide standardized nomenclature within the health
system, and led it to become a founding member of NAHIT. Mr. Reese observed
that the work being done by the various committees and everything listed that
day wasn't on the CIO's radar screens. He suggested the Subcommittee
&quot;follow the money.&quot; When a standard was developed, it was the CIO who
purchased the multi-million dollar system and told the provider which standard
to deliver. Once CIOs understood what to buy, they'd enforce the standard at
the local level. Mr. Reese said having the standards (and CIOs who understood
them) would result in a major cost reduction and increase efficiency at the
operational level. NAHIT was interested in standards related to bar coding,
patient identification, communication and application systems. Its mission was
to mobilize the field and assist in the implementation of standards; NAHIT
convened the payers, providers, IT manufacturers and supply chain; took out
small projects that could succeed; and led the field to recognize its role and
responsibility in the adoption of standards. Mr. Reese said NAHIT was committed
to a consensus approach and its strength lay in bringing the field together
where they could educate people like himself about the standards and what had
to be done. He reiterated that healthcare leadership had to resolve issues of
patient safety, retention and recruiting and capacity of management. </P>
<P>Dr. Overhage discussed the e-Health (eHI) initiative and its foundation to
bring together public and private sector stakeholders, promote and coordinate
national adoption of health data standards and system interoperability, and
meet clinical and public health needs. Dr. Overhage described the Public
Private Collaboration for Public Health, an eHI initiative that develops and
communicates strategies to efficiently and securely capture and transmit
standardized electronic data of public health importance. Dr. Overhage said
critical success factors include: public and private sectors working closely
together, leveraging expertise and competencies; focus on specific,
well-defined, highly visible needs for public health data; data largely already
in electronic formats and likely to be converted and transmitted quickly;
aligning efforts and needs with existing funding; leveraging the work of
experts and &quot;those in the trenches&quot; and building upon lessons learned
and best practices; involving key stakeholders; driving usage of standards and
strategies through implementation and demonstration projects; and aligning
efforts with national incentives, </P>
<P>Dr. Overhage noted key areas requiring additional development or
implementation and lessons the initiative learned. eHI's model of rapid
short-term intensive efforts focused on specific problems demonstrating
significant results in a modest time scale and that the industry was ready for
early implementation steps. eHI demonstrated the value of bringing together
multiple stakeholders in a public-private collaboration committed to working
with others through overlapping involvement that leveraged complementary
skills, knowledge and expertise. Dr. Overhage emphasized ongoing, open
communication and concrete alignment of activities. He said the Committee could
assist by: continuing to create a clear, consistent message about
&quot;operable&quot; standards and terminologies to adopt near term,
encouraging and supporting demonstration projects, and developing a model for
migration to a PMRI standards-based environment. He noted it was vital that
migration strategy become a critical factor in how everyone thought about
things.</P>
<P><B>Agenda Item: Comments about standards Implementation in the United
Kingdom</B></P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Colin Price, M.D., <I>National Health Service Information Authority,
U.K.</I></B></LI>
</UL>
<P>Dr. Price summarized NHS's decade worth of national health information
technology strategies based on: the patient as center of operational clinical
systems, IT supporting clinical care while secondarily deriving information to
optimize cost effectiveness, and managing expectations about IT's outputs and
benefits. NHS's current focus is on implementing key targets with centralized
management and standardization, while recognizing industry's key role. NHS's
separate standards approval mechanism relies on evidence of live
implementation, plans for managing human behavioral change management aspects
of the new standard, and evidence of stakeholder engagement. Dr. Price
emphasized that standards integration remained a significant challenge. </P>
<P>Dr. Price emphasized that standards needed to be interoperable and noted the
challenge that presented. NHS considered CT implementation a bridge between
yesterday and today. Dr. Price said the foundation had set business objectives
for implementing the standards and intended to make this product suitable for
key initiatives, particularly short-term strategic requirements. NHS aimed to
manage the supply chain around this standard (engaging with end users,
political groups, managers using secondary information, and suppliers),
integrate with other standards and complete the standards approval process. Dr.
Price noted business issues had to be addressed around distributing the
standard and terminology, and producing and costing a formal, long-term
implementation plan. He stressed the importance of determining who was
responsible for performance managing implementation. Dr. Price estimated the
cost of upgrading the U.S. clinical system to SNOMED would account for only 20
percent of the implementation costs; amending legacy data and primary care
records would require the rest. In planning, NHS assessed the value of its
primary care data, the extent it would formally be migrated and archived, and
the implications. Dr. Price described Evaluating and Rollout of Terminology in
Clinical Applications (EARTICA), which oversees rolling out SNOMED. He said
implementating a standard across NHS took a year and cost about $3 million.</P>

NHII as the society's long-term public policy initiative. Its NHII task force
evaluated initial projects including creating an inventory of existing
technologies and practices, developing a gap analysis on what needs to be
created and a HIMSS version of NHII. </P>
<P><B>Panel 5: Issues in Transitioning to New Code Sets</B></P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Jim Daley, <I>HIPAA program Director, Blue Cross Blue Shield of South
Carolina</I></B></LI>
<LI><B>James Cross, M.D., <I>National Medical Director, Medical Policy and
National Transplants, Aetna</I></B></LI>
</UL>
<P>Mr. Daley said diagnosis and procedure codes were the cornerstones of health
care administrative systems and wholesale change had to be approached
cautiously, so potential impact could be evaluated and code changes didn't
result in unintended, adverse consequences. A recent report from the General
Accounting Office (GAO) raised concerns about ICD-10-PCS implementation
challenges and the associated financial burden on the industry. Clinical codes
underpinned virtually everything in the system and change to ICD-10 would
impact payment, medical policies, and quality improvement programs while
benefiting design, fraud, and abuse detection. Anticipated code sets costs
approached Y2K costs for transactions. Neither the costs nor benefits were
fully demonstrated. Mr. Daley cautioned that in-house and packaged software
would be impacted. Reimbursement and contracting procedures, care management
policies, and training forms could require change. Payer software including
interfaces would need carefully coordinated updates, and logic built into many
applications that directly interrogated specific code values would add to the
complexity. A fully functioning crosswalk had to be available and a change of
this magnitude required extensive testing. </P>
<P>Modifying diagnosis and procedure coding would impact the heart of the
reimbursement process. AMA projected 8.4 million physicians' contracts and fee
schedules would require renegotiation. Mr. Daley estimated hospitals would have
to renegotiate 140,000 contracts. Procedures would require review and potential
modification because of new diagnosis and procedure coding. Extensive training
would be required. Even with a suitable crosswalk, maintaining dual-coding
structures would be, at best, cumbersome, and ability to capture historical
data or review utilization information would be difficult. Many concerns had to
be resolved. BCBSA recommended there should be no migration until initial HIPAA
mandates were successfully implemented and a thorough impact analysis,
including cost/benefits of migrating or not migrating as well as transitional
considerations were analyzed and alternatives assessed. </P>
<P>While use of ICD-10 codes for medical diagnosis and procedure coding had
been debated for years, Dr. Cross said what hadn't been assessed was the
potential cost and administrative burden of moving to a new, complicated coding
structure. He urged the Subcommittee to thoroughly consider associated costs
and complexities, cautioning that changing to ICD-10 for diagnosis and
inpatient procedure codes would result in a tremendous burden, especially for
physicians. The GAO report analyzing whether a single coding system should be
adopted for all inpatient and outpatient medical procedures noted difficulties
switching to ICD-10-PCS and stated &quot;the design and logic of 10-PCS raised
concerns about potential challenges in its implementation.&quot; Aetna
concurred with the GAO report's conclusions on the potential administrative and
financial burdens of changing to ICD-10. Dr. Cross urged the Committee to
conduct a detailed analysis of the cost of this change before deciding and
noted the ultimate consideration was that all costs would be passed on to
consumers already experiencing a significant rise in health care costs. </P>
<P><B>Discussion: Standards and Security Issues - Draft Recommendations for
Code Sets</B></P>
<P>Noting the Subcommittee held a number of hearings on this complex,
contentious issue and it was hard to tease apart diagnosis and procedures, Dr.
Cohn outlined options: a letter recommending putting the two together, moving
to an NPRM or NOI, doing nothing now, or further deliberation (which wouldn't
be for months). They'd heard the industry preferred implementing together, but
also that staggering made conceptual sense, and that additional studies of
implementation costs and benefits were needed before an NPRM or NOI. </P>
<P>Mr. Daley said ICD-10's increased specificity could identify conditions to
help expedite payment, care management, fraud and abuse protection. BCBSA was
concerned about the complexity and degree of impact. AAHP worried about
administrative and financial costs of dealing with additional complexity.
Noting Dr. Cohn asked for a cost/benefit study, Mr. Blair emphasized including
providers from the standpoint of improving patient outcomes, clinical research,
and information hospital administrators needed to improve the cost structure.
He noted they'd heard that the cost/benefit for the payer sector wasn't enough.
</P>
<P>Dr. McDonald reported that the written comments (two-and-a-half for;
three-and-a-half against) left him cynical. AHA's studies boiled down to 100
charts evaluated by CMS's contractors. Dr. McDonald called for an independent
reviewer's detailed numerics. Nellie Leon-Chisen said AHA believed ICD-10-PCS
was sufficient for inpatient hospital reporting. Recalling Dr. McDonald's
observation at the June meeting that physicians weren't clamoring for more
codes but wanted guidance, Kathryn Serkes, speaking for the Association of
American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS), noted physicians wanted to address
issues of audits, prosecutions, and fraud. Mr. Beebe reported that AMA
contracted with PricewaterhouseCoopers for a cost/benefit analysis of different
scenarios for the inpatient setting or achieving a single procedure coding
system. Mr. Augustine pointed out that managed care and payers were good at
collecting and analyzing data ahead of the curve. Noting their progress
utilizing medical and disease management, he said he'd like to see more
information or put what they had into a better format.</P>
<P>Dr. McDonald said he wouldn't be opposed to an NOI with these caveats, but
expressed concern about acting on the basis of 100 sample records. Dr. Cohn
proposed a letter to the Secretary, noting the need for a cost/benefit analysis
within six months. Meanwhile the Subcommittee could collect similar data. Ms.
Brooks predicted that, if the Committee did an NOI or NPRM, hospitals would do
their own independent studies. An NPRM would force government to analyze the
cost and calculate a projection the industry would read carefully and respond
to through several iterations. Ms. Brooks also anticipated that, with
ICD-10-PCS, hospitals would continue to code what they did today under DRGs,
even though more codes could be used for internal purposes. </P>
<P>Ms. Trudel explained that a NOI provided a view of potential issues, laid
out options, and, being in the Federal Register, drew wide public comment.
After assessing that input, an NPRM could present options and solicit further
comment. An NOI wouldn't require a full-fledged impact analysis. Ms. Greenberg
cautioned that an NPRM had to follow an NOI before doing a final rule and would
delay the process. They'd heard concerns about how much longer organizations
could continue with codes 25 years old that couldn't be updated and reflected
antiquated terminology discarded by the rest of the world. She noted Ms. Trudel
had pointed out that they could accomplish everything in an NPRM that they
might with an NOI <I>and</I> force the Department to do the impact or
cost/benefit analysis. </P>
<P>Dr. McDonald said, with the knowledge they had now, he'd go with an NPRM.
Mr. Augustine reiterated a preference for an NPRM with options for an impact
analysis and adopting both, one, or a future approach. Noting an NOI could tie
the General Counsel's hands, Ms. Trudel proposed recommending specific concerns
and issues, including cost/benefit analysis and documented testing of actual
coding using real-life charts. Mr. Blair concurred with Dr. McDonald's concerns
about broader, more comprehensive testing. Testifiers reiterated the need for
the business case and Mr. Blair said he wanted to ensure that case was across
the board and broader than cost/benefit for payers. An NPRM would allow for the
cost/benefit issues and additional testing. He expressed concern over further
delay. Dr. McDonald said making the wrong decision fast wouldn't help. Mr.
Blair pointed out that they'd be able to draw upon negative feedback. Dr.
McDonald said he'd looked: there were 7,000 more codes available in ICD-9-CM,
Volume 3 and ways to code for another year. Ms. Brooks noted a write up on the
issue of extending existing codes. She reported that the way the tree added
alphanumeric digits didn't get at the root of the structure's problem. She
recalled public meetings 10 years ago with the ICD-9-CM Coordination
Maintenance Committee exploring ways to expand the four digits. People had been
adamantly against it. </P>
<P>Dr. Cohn noted Mr. Blair proposed an NPRM. With the right caveats, Dr.
McDonald opted for an NOI. Dr. Cohn said key issues were differences between
mechanisms (e.g., NPRMs and NOIs), open issues needing resolution, and
uncertainty over a solution. They were talking multiple things. He asked if
members wanted a letter expressing concerns and next steps or to recommend an
NOI or NPRM. Mr. Augustine reiterated the possibility of an NPRM, with the
option of implementing separately or both internally. Mr. Blair noted they'd
discussed caveats and testing. Dr. Fitzmaurice cautioned against stretching
this beyond when many members remained at the table. Though an NPRM might solve
some problems, he understood Dr. McDonald's concern about ensuring the right
decision and he acknowledged an NOI was appealing. But an NPRM would force the
government to do an impact or benefit/cost analysis before making comments and
framed issues so people could comment and trust government to follow that NPRM
and turn out a good final rule. Dr. Fitzmaurice said he was sensitive to the
time an NPRM took, but it had worked with other HIPAA standards and everybody
agreed they needed information. He concurred with Ms. Trudel who'd urged the
Subcommittee not to tie the hands of the Department, but encouraged it to
provide enough information to make a better recommendation at another time. 
</P>
<P>Ms. Trudel reiterated that the Subcommittee had four alternatives: do
nothing, recommend a specific code set, hold more hearings, or do additional
analysis using the Administrative Procedural Act process to gain input and
involvement--CMS would decide on an NOI, NPRM, open town hall meeting, or
industry forum announced in the Federal Register. Dr. McDonald said he'd stop
short of an NPRM. Ms. Greenberg said they'd heard, &quot;Go with diagnosis
first.&quot; At the last hearing, they'd been told, &quot;Go with 10-PCS and
10-CM together.&quot; Dr. McDonald said he didn't consider ICD-10-CM much
different, but expressed concern about PCS. Ms. Greenberg noted some European
countries had seven years experience with the diagnosis codes and many had
implemented ICD-10 and clinical modifications; 10-PCS hadn't been available.
Mr. Blair noted an NOI didn't set the process in a bound time line. With an
NPRM, people weren't so vulnerable to open-ended delay and might determine if
their direction was misguided, incomplete or incorrect. Dr. McDonald noted
CMS's enthusiasm for moving with ICD and PCS, but emphasized that a hundred
cases didn't indicate anything. Dr. McDonald said he was interested in
comparisons, not continuous improvement, and wouldn't make decisions on any
process change in his hospital based on that data. </P>
<P>Dr. Zubeldia considered issues about ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes, ICD-10-PCS
institutional procedures, and ICD-10-PCS for professional (not recommended)
quite different and advised separate NOIs or NPRMs. He favored the NPRM because
it forced government to make an impact analysis, and he stressed there had to
be separate analyses for procedure and diagnosis codes, as well as procedure
codes for professional services. Another issue was whether adoption should be
synchronized. Observing that even today's testifiers weren't as concerned about
implementing diagnosis codes as procedure codes, Dr. Zubeldia voted for the
NPRM with the caveat that components be addressed separately. Mr. Blair
endorsed an NPRM with Dr. McDonald's caveat about testing. Mr. Blair observed
that Dr. Zubeldia's suggestion to separate sections in the NPRM for ICD-10-PCS,
ICD-10-CM, and other pieces was similar to their first draft with the deadline
of no sooner than October 2005. Noting the NPRM process failed to identify
problems with the NDC code, Theresa Dalmer, BCBSA, cautioned that an
operational date of 2005 was ambitious. She doubted that in 60 days they'd get
the information needed to accurately anticipate impact. Noting comments about
impact on hospitals emphasized evaluating across the industry, Ms. Dalmer noted
many players didn't look at the Federal Register or NPRMs and would have to be
reached in other ways. </P>
<P>Mr. Blair suggested extending the 60-day response period to 90 or 120 days.
He envisioned the NPRM establishing a mechanism that formally solicited
comments and drew in the business case. Dr. Zubeldia expressed concern that an
impact analysis might not reflect private industry's view. Recalling that AMA
might do its own impact analysis, he asked how the process could reflect
private industry analyses. Dr. Fitzmaurice noted perspectives submitted as
comments to the NPRM had to be considered. Dr. Zubeldia pointed out that
comments didn't have to be published in the final rule; he suggested the
government could informally publish a white paper before the NPRM depicting its
impact analysis alongside private industry's analysis, and putting both in the
NPRM. Other analyses could be referenced and points of agreement stated. Ms.
Greenberg clarified that the rule-making process went through numerous segments
of government; publishing prior to the NPRM didn't make sense because one
couldn't go through that vetting process. </P>
<P>Mr. Augustine agreed with Dr. Zubeldia's original proposal of an NPRM, but
separated out aspects. Dr. Zubeldia emphasized that the industry needed to see
the government's and other impact analyses before evaluating the NPRM. He
supported an NOI. Dr. Zubeldia proposed that the government do a full impact
analysis, compare it with private analyses, and move expediently to rule
making. He advocated an NPRM, if required for an impact analysis, and
pre-publishing preparatory work for the NPRM. The staff said that wasn't
possible. Mr. Blair suggested extending the public comment period. Dr. Cohn
reminded everyone that they were a subcommittee of an advisory body to HHS and
limited in what they could do. Members discussed whether the Committee could
contract for an impact analysis. Mr. Augustine said he'd prefer doing their own
impact analysis before taking the next step. Dr. Fitzmaurice proposed a study
with hard coders double coding. </P>
<P>Ms. Greenberg said the Subcommittee could commission a parallel study; it
wouldn't accomplish what the NPRM would, but they could hold hearings about
other studies. But she cautioned that was no different than delaying a few more
years and didn't inform the field. Dr. McDonald advised that, given the time
frame, a NOI was more sensible because it generated studies. Dr. Cohn recorded
a vote for an NPRM, with one negative. Members discussed asking the Secretary
to inform the public of their intent and urging industry to perform its own
impact and cost/benefit studies before any NPRM. Reflecting on Mr. Blair's
desire for full industry appraisal, Ms. Greenberg suggested commissioning a
study that &quot;quantified&quot; benefits. Mr. Augustine cautioned that was
extremely difficult. Members approved the direction of the original document. A
revision will be distributed before the next meeting. Dr. McDonald was assured
that he'd have an opportunity to discuss his minority opinion to the full
Committee. Dr. Cohn explained he'd abstained because this dealt with procedure
coding, as well as diagnosis codes; he said he wouldn't give an opinion to the
Committee. Noting the implementation date recommended in the document seemed
impossible, Dr. Cohn suggested thinking about it as they moved forward. </P>
<P><B>Discussion: DSM-IV</B></P>
<P>Dr. Cohn noted the Secretary received letters from the American Psychiatric
Association (APA) requesting that DSM be named a code standard for use in
psychiatry and mental health and that APA become the designated standards
maintenance organization (DSMO). The Subcommittee's initial view was that these
activities should be separate. Typically, DSMOs maintained transactions, not
diagnostic criteria. And the Department received no comments recommending
adoption of DSM-IV, though they'd heard concern that, once ICD-9-CM was the
standard for diagnosis reporting, mental health couldn't use the diagnostic
criteria in DSM. Dr. Cohn sought members' and APA's perspective. If there was
agreement, the Subcommittee would draft a letter to the Secretary for review at
the next meeting stating continued use of DSM-IV diagnostic criteria that
crosswalked to ICD-9-CM codes didn't pose a conflict with code sets adopted
under HIPAA and that adoption of diagnostic criteria used to establish
diagnosis was outside HIPAA's scope. APA expressed concern that, without DSM-IV
encoded in the HIPAA statute, the default descriptor would be the ICD-9-CM
glossary and definitions. The Subcommittee will ask the Department's General
Counsel if the concept of diagnostic criteria was, indeed, separate and
distinct from the HIPAA code sets. </P>
<P>Ms. Trudel recalled that Dr. Cohn had indicated the DSMOs were specific to
the transaction standards and not clinical code set maintainers. Dr. Darrel
Regier, Director, Research, APA, agreed the issue was the code set and
mechanism necessary for a publicly approved code maintenance organization.
APA's counsel, Robert Charrow, clarified that there were two issues: the scope
of the regulatory provision and the legal impact of a single official code set
that had no diagnostic criteria. Eliminating DSM-IV as an official code set had
profound implications on 675 state laws and, once HIPAA was effective, the
informal crosswalk wouldn't be viable. Dr. Cohn said the Subcommittee's main
concern was that the crosswalk between DSM and ICD was appropriate and people
could continue to use diagnostic criteria. Members and staff were searching for
a reasonable, speedily implementable solution. Dr. Cohn cautioned against hopes
that this could be done with an NPRM before HIPAA was implemented, but he
assured everyone that the Subcommittee believed there was a solution. The next
step was obtaining CMS's legal counsel's review. Hopefully, lawyer-to-lawyer
discussions would resolve this by the Subcommittee's next breakout session. Ms.
Trudel will work within CMS and the Subcommittee will continue the
conversation. </P>

<H3>DETAILED HEARING SUMMARY</H3>
<P><B>Day One</B></P>
<P><B>Agenda Item: Overview</B> </P>
<P>Mr. Blair thanked everyone who'd come to help the Committee get the right
start on identifying and selecting PMRI terminologies and making
recommendations to HHS. He noted the testifiers previously received questions
focusing on: (1) feedback on the proposal and whether it ought to encompass
different areas or was too large or small, and (2) whether the criteria for
selection were appropriate, pragmatic, realistic and sufficient. Mr. Blair said
the scope and criteria for selection were derived from the Committee's July
2000 report to the Secretary that set forth priorities for going forward with
PMRI standard recommendations and a set of ten recommendations, including the
selection of standards. Mr. Blair pointed out that the report also addressed
accelerating development of PMRI standards and guiding principles for selection
in general terms and other guidances the Subcommittee sought to apply to PMRI
terminology. In February 2002, the Committee applied these guiding principles
to the selection of PMRI message format standards and set forth
recommendations. The July 2000 report is available on the NCVHS Web site. </P>
<P><B>Panel 1: Terminology </B></P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Christopher G. Chute, M.D., Dr.PH, <I>Professor of Medical Informatics,
Mayo Clinic Foundation</I></B><I></I></LI>
</UL>
<P>Dr. Chute applauded what had been done in terms of preliminary criteria and
acknowledged that the Committee had created multi-purpose roles and recognition
for terminologies, outlined reasonable starting domains, and faithfully
collated widely acknowledged common criteria. Dr. Chute reviewed motivational
issues associated with development of terminology in patient medical records to
support his recommendations for augmenting the criteria and scope. He noted
that a major purpose of a terminology was to capture symptoms, findings, events
and interventions with sufficient detail and specificity to enable their use in
decision support, information retrieval, recognition and other familiar
applications. He emphasized the importance of keeping use cases separate from
their format and structure. He added it was important to remember that, in
parallel with these detailed specific nomenclatures they might accommodate in
patient medical records, a need would persist to aggregate this information
characteristically by way of high-level classifications. Thus they had to
enable accurate and reproducible grouping of this information for a variety of
purposes, including but not limited to fiscal reimbursement management types of
activities: public health, surveillance and statistical issues. Dr. Chute said
they could imagine this continuum through various and increasing levels of
aggregation or groupings, and cluster like conditions or events into small
groupings or accommodate broad groups of related concerns in the context of
these higher level classifications or aggregations. </P>
<P>Dr. Chute indicated that view-and-use cases had implications on the notion
of grouping an organization. He proposed that they rethink the notion of a
historical model of this continuum of terminology from a detailed nomenclature
to a classification in a more broadly based context: a
one-size-no-longer-fit-all approach. Historically (since 1996 national
terminology symposia work), the idea that an underlying nomenclature could have
detailed specific patient information and extend along a common continuum to
higher level classifications or groups was perceived as a fairly linear,
uniform and single dimensional problem. Examples were the evolving detailed
clinical nomenclatures, the intermediate classification of ICD and its
relatives, and higher-level groupings of DRGs. Dr. Chute proposed confronting a
more complex use case with needs in decision support and error detection,
public health and surveillance, reimbursement and management, outcome and
epidemiology. Regarding this field of findings, events and interventions as an
instance of a patient record, Dr. Chute said it was probable and plausible to
reaggregate this patient in a variety of contexts, using diverse rules to
achieve distinct classification contexts. </P>
<P>Noting it was improbable that a single classification or set of rule bases
could accommodate the spectrum of use cases encountered in classification, Dr.
Chute suggested imagining rules for a cascading set of groups or criteria and
levels of aggregation within a common rule base. He noted these use cases and
their spectrum of context had implications for criteria used for specifying and
developing terminologies internationally that could be simplistically
accommodated into two notions of description logics he termed their sibling
aggregation (the old rule-based mechanisms by which clinical events could be
intelligently aggregated into higher-level classifications) logics. He proposed
publishing these aggregation logics that Dr. Spackman and others proposed as
components of their attached classifications; e.g., if ICD-10-CM were the
acknowledged content for public health and/or reimbursement criteria, the rules
and logic by which specific detailed clinical observations, events and
interventions could be aggregated into higher level ICD rubrics would be a
component of a published ICD content, not a characteristic of a mapping element
associated with an underlying terminology.</P>
<P>Whatever they did, Dr. Chute concluded they'd confront significant
challenges (e.g., the human interface problem--how physicians, nurses and other
health providers interacted with the terminology remained a considerable
challenge and burden, particularly in face of time costs and the existing
provider burden). Similarly, the impact on vendors developing health
information systems would be considerable as they confronted the challenge of
incorporating relatively complex and sophisticated representations of patient
information into underlying products. And everyone would be confronted with
selecting from what was available today or supporting development along the
lines of content, authoring environments and newly described aggregation and
description logics. Dr. Chute added that the Committee might consider an
additional criterion for the organization of terms in the context of their
various aggregation levels and these families of associated classifications and
logics. He suggested incorporating as criteria for consideration of well-formed
terminologies their behavior and opportunity to participate in description
logics as definitions of their underlying content, as well as supporting
aggregation logics that enabled their higher-level aggregation into appropriate
classifications and groups among the discriminating criteria considered for
terminology.</P>
<P><B>Panel 1: Terminology </B></P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Suzanne Bakken, RN, DNSc, FAAN, <I>Alumni Professor of Nursing and
Professor of Medical Informatics, Columbia University</I></B><I></I></LI>
</UL>
<P>Speaking on behalf of ANA, Dr. Bakken noted that some subsets of PMRI
terminologies were designated by domain coverage (e.g., nursing) while others
were categorized by area of the healthcare process (e.g., diagnoses and
procedure) or purpose (e.g., SNOMED CT was classified convergence). ANA
recommended renaming the &quot;Procedures&quot; category
&quot;Interventions,&quot; reflecting the diversity in the coded activities,
and categorizing terminologies by multiple dimensions that took into account
their domain coverage, primary purpose and the underlying semantic structure of
the terminologies. Dr. Bakken noted her written statement included an expanded
list of data nursing codes and that the Omaha System and Perioperative Nursing
Data Set (PNDS) were incorporated into the Unified Medical Language System
(UMLS). Noting that DEEDS was included in the PMRI terminologies, Dr. Bakken
suggested the Subcommittee consider including the Nursing Minimum Data Set and
International Classification of Nursing Practice, an international product
recognized by ANA. </P>
<P>Addressing priorities, Dr. Bakken remarked that terminologies supporting
PMRI were essential in promoting patient safety and improving healthcare
quality, multidisciplinary care and communication; she recommended that these
terminologies include codes related to pharmacy, laboratory, diagnoses,
interventions, and outcomes. Dr. Bakken advised that the criteria for selection
include documented testing of reliability, validity and clinical utility. She
noted a number of terminologies the Subcommittee referenced referred to those
notions. She said the criteria required modification so that they were
appropriate for the different types of terminologies. ANA originally used a
single set of criteria for its recognition process, but as terminological
science evolved they found that wasn't sufficient to recognize the types of
terminology products submitted and developed criteria to address data sets,
classifications and nomenclatures. Dr. Bakken emphasized the importance of
clarifying the criteria that related to each type of semantic structure,
particularly in relationship to the notion of clinically specific
terminologies, which implied these were concept-oriented terminologies.</P>
<P>Dr. Bakken supported Dr. Chute's observations about the relationships among
terminologies, noting it was important to clarify what were terminology
characteristics or abilities rather than roles or abilities potentially
provided by models or supporting software. Dr. Bakken noted that the
International Council of Nurses (which includes ANA) and the International
Medical Informatics Association's (IMIA) Nursing Informatics Special Interest
Group sponsored a work item within the International Standards Organization
(ISO) on developing a reference terminology model that integrated nursing
concepts. The model, which Dr. Bakken said enabled ANA to meet the notion of
finely detailed clinical specifications and rules engines that support the
description logic, is proposed as a draft International Standard (ISO, 2002).
ANA believed that PMRI terminology developers didn't need to be ANSI
accredited, but should be affiliated with an ANSI-accredited organization
(e.g., terminology registration with HL7). Meetings should be open, with timely
public notification, and the voting/balloting process should be published and
accommodate public comment and appeal. Criteria should incorporate existing
ISO, ANSI standards processes and definitions.</P>
<P><B>Panel 1: Terminology </B></P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Colin Price, MBA, Mphil, FRCS, <I>National Health Service Information
Authority, U.K.</I></B> </LI>
</UL>
<P>Dr. Price characterized U.K.'s NHS as a diverse and currently unstable
environment. The government had a huge commitment to NHS IT and faced a general
election in about three years. In order to achieve aggressive targets for 2005,
NHS was taking a more centralist control of implementation,
&quot;ruthlessly&quot; applying standards and a more controlled approach to
industry procurement.</P>
<P>In the 1980s, multiple commercial terminology development schemes appeared
within primary care in the NHS. In 1988, the clinical professions endorsed the
READ Codes. NHS purchased the READ Codes in 1990 and produced Clinical Terms
(CT), version 3 in 1995. Public inquiries into the READ Codes led to a review
of terminology options. Five options were considered: (1) don't use a standard
terminology, (2) continue using READ Codes, (3) an off the shelf alternative
(e.g., SNOMED), (4) collaborate with SNOMED, or (5) utilize another
collaboration. In 1999 NHS agreed with CAP to develop SNOMED CT. CT was
released in 2002 and NHS invests heavily in evaluating and implementing
foundation programs.</P>
<P>Dr. Price noted five high-level terminology implementation goals:
nation-wide roll out, multi-purpose use (direct and indirect care),
multi-professional uptake (doctors, nurses, allied health), multiple
environments (primary care, hospitals, community), and extensibility for
patient access and social care. Clinical information systems begin using SNOMED
CT in April 2003.</P>
<P>In describing NHS's experience in classifying terminologies, using a
comprehensive terminology and mapping it to formal classifications, Dr. Price
reiterated Dr. Chute's comments about a continuum from direct to indirect
patient care purposes. He noted that SNOMED CT, through its reference
properties, picked up more of the indirect care functions. </P>
<P>Dr. Price said arguments for comprehensive schemes included: (1) the
advantages of the single provider organization (unambiguous problem-owner,
single focus for change requests and user support), (2) inherent
interoperability (avoids overlapping--duplicated--content), (3) supports
uniformity of file and code structures (strong support for vendor community)
and (4) economies of scale in support and education, cross mapping to
classifications, maintenance (especially QA) and distribution. However Dr.
Price noted monopoly (or oligopoly) concerns, potential unresponsiveness to
changing requirements, the large size structurally might require subsets,
specialist requirements might be constrained by the uniform structure, and the
difficulty of establishing wide editorial input. Arguments for interoperability
included: (1) schemes closer to user purposes and expertise, (2) a strong sense
of professional ownership and commitment, (3) rapid adoption of suitable
existing schemes, and (4) increased responsiveness to change requests.
Arguments against interoperability included: the financial overhead in
maintaining interoperability (structural properties, release synchronization),
a tendency for scope creep towards comprehensiveness that compounds
interoperability issues (e.g., LOINC in moving from LUD to clinical LOINC
picked up contents of other schemes). Dr. Price reported that a survey NHS
conducted this year indicated that 50 percent of terminology experts anticipate
multiple interoperable schemes within 10 years; 25 percent predict a single
global scheme by then. </P>
<P>Discussing the criteria for selection, Dr. Price said the technical
properties weren't normally controversial, but well-rehearsed desiderata backed
up by academic and standards work. He noted that end users considered many
advanced technical features to be fairly superfluous for short-and-medium-term
requirements. Dr. Price added that market forces (supply and demand for
terminology), financial structure, and long-term viability of provider were
important considerations in NHS's development and review of the business case
for investment in terminology. Dr. Price noted NHS end-users expressed little
real demand for terminology, a fact reflected in limited commercial supply of
large comprehensive schemes. He also commented on a lack of clarity about
scope, purpose and benefits and a perception that any benefits from adopting a
national terminology would be governmental and central rather than local.
Commercially aggressive business models were viewed as non-viable; intellectual
property terminologies were only considered valuable if people were willing to
pay for them. </P>
<P>In terms of financial structuring, Dr. Price advised that the Subcommittee's
general criteria (timely updates, flexible and adaptive, relatively
inexpensive) were mutually exclusive. Based on NHS's experience developing READ
Codes version 3 and its investment in SNOMED, Dr. Price predicted any new
endeavor required 20-30 million dollars of start-up capital. A guaranteed
income stream (hard money) of about $l5 million annually would be needed to
maintain a global comprehensive terminology. Dr. Price said an aggressively
commercial venture probably couldn't sustain the financial requirements; a
non-commercial structure was needed.</P>
<P>Dr. Price emphasized the importance of the long-term viability of providers.
The costs of switching terminology (migrating databases, reporting arrangements
and protocols) were potentially high and any low-viability model was high risk.
Open contributorship models with subscriptions to cover costs, a national
support level, a core product as &quot;public good&quot; within the subscribing
community, extensions to core and subsets for local needs offered the best
advantages.</P>
<P>Dr. Price reiterated that NHS had remained committed to using a single
comprehensive scheme (now SNOMED CT) since 1992, and were investing $3,000,000
in 2002 to lay the foundations for implementation of the NHS. NHS believed that
the provision of extension, subset and mapping mechanisms addressed many of the
counter-arguments to comprehensive schemes. A global business model needed to
be open, contributory, non-predatory and underpinned by central (government)
support. Dr. Price emphasized that terminology wasn't an end in itself, but was
needed to add value.</P>
<P><B>Panel 1: Terminology</B></P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Stuart J. Nelson, M.D., <I>Head, Medical Subject Headings, National
Library of Medicine</I></B><I></I> </LI>
</UL>
<P>Dr. Nelson concurred with much of Dr. Chute's validation of the
Subcommittee's effort, while addressing areas that needed strengthening:
terminologies, atomic concepts, relationships, priorities, pricing and the
maintenance process. Building upon Dr. Chute's description of a continuum of
information terminologies ranging from high-level aggregation of information
and groupings for reimbursement down to the patient level, Dr. Nelson expressed
concern about another level below clinical, particularly in light of the
increased information in genetics. Rather than focusing on a continuum, Dr.
Nelson encouraged the Subcommittee to recognize distinct uses of the
terminology.</P>
<P>Dr. Nelson agreed that the best way to organize the Subcommittee's
consideration of terminologies was to view them both in terms of the level of
discourse and areas covered. Addressing the notion of an atomic concept, he
pointed out that the level of discourse determined atomicity and the
granularity of discussion. He agreed with Dr. Bakken that the areas of coverage
in terminologies considered shouldn't be split out according to the professions
engaged. Although he termed them procedures, rather than interventions, he
acknowledged these were different areas that could be looked at as coverage. 
</P>
<P>He proposed a number of additions of vocabularies including the RxNorm
project, two other pharmacy knowledge-based vendors (MediSpan and Micromdex),
International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O), International
Classification of Primary Care (ICPC), new efforts by dermatologists to
organize patient observations, taxonomy of organisms and anatomy.</P>
<P>Noting that the level of discourse determined atomicity, Dr. Nelson
commented on the difficulty of defining atomic concepts when the level of
discourse kept changing. Observing that one could describe things in fine
detail, yet never completely define them, he suggested atomic concept was a
myth. What one could convey was the level of discourse with which something was
expressed, and whether it was a pre- or post-coordinated expression. Dr. Nelson
suggested that what they were trying to say was that they wanted a
post-coordinated expression for anything at a greater level of detail than
their current level of discourse. He contrasted human tolerance for ambiguity
in terminology with computational needs, and noted Zipf's Law stating that the
names of things talked about frequently get shorter, becoming atoms. At the
level of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), names were
shorter than on a clinical level.</P>
<P>Dr. Nelson said Dr. Chute's comments about descriptive and aggregative
logics clearly described relationships with other terminologies. A major
difficulty for developers was that many terminology systems had sets of rules
that were humanly understandable, but weren't expressed in a way
computationally achievable. He emphasized the need to make sure that mapping
wasn't vulnerable to obfuscation for remuneration or &quot;gaming.&quot;
Terminologies had to have representational integrity, so things could only be
said one way. Dr. Nelson cautioned that when considering reference
terminologies one had to be aware of the implications of changes in the
reference terminology on other terminologies that referred to them and how such
changes were propagated.</P>
<P>Dr. Nelson observed that, while it was a nice first order approximation to
say terminology was independent of the system and interface, in the long run it
was dependent. Noting the problem of character sets and special characters
reserved for the operating system, he suggested there had to be some set of
open standards when using terminologies with multiple vendors that defined
exactly what the terminology would and would not do, and what the systems were
and weren't allowed to do.</P>
<P>Remarking that the biggest priority was patient safety, Dr. Nelson said the
data suggested that, with computerized physician order entry, errors could be
halved on laboratory and drug orders. Another priority was a problem list,
describing procedures and interventions on a successful array. He emphasized
that other problems had to be solved before achieving a complete patient
description.</P>
<P>Dr. Nelson said maintenance had to be quick, timely, responsive to user
needs, and actively seek input with rapid turnaround minimizing local update
penalty. He called for a set timetable for revisions and an organized review
process. Remarking that he didn't think it possible to do vocabulary
development on a consensus basis, Dr. Nelson advocated picking the
&quot;quintessential middle child,&quot; who listened to everybody, understood
the engineering, and let him or her struggle it out. Perfection wasn't
possible, but if you let responsible people do the job and respond to the
users, you could judge whether they did a good job. He emphasized the need for
an open, organized review process with input from all interested parties.</P>
<P>Dr. Nelson also observed that in the competitive environment price was
marginal cost and the marginal cost of providing terminology for one more
provider wasn't high. He noted pricing could also be based on the value added
to the system by the terminology (a hard thing to measure) or the alternative
cost of somebody else doing it.</P>
<P><B>Panel 1: Terminology </B><I></I></P>
<UL>
<LI><B>David Lareau, <I>Chief Operating Officer, Medicomp Systems</I></B></LI>
</UL>
<P>Mr. Lareau said the biggest challenge for Medicomp (a developer of tools for
documentation and clinical decision support at the point of care for 24 years)
has been what Dr. Chute called the human interface challenge. Working with
clinicians, Medicomp has been continually challenged to address dynamics of the
clinician-patient encounter. A major part of that challenge was to determine
how to accommodate the clinical thought process without interfering or changing
it. Medicomp found that clinicians process &quot;clinical concepts&quot; versus
individual or &quot;atomic&quot; terms, and the relationships between them, in
order to determine a diagnosis and what Dr. Bakken called intervention. Mr.
Lareau said his responses to the Subcommittee's questions came from this
experience and the way these concepts were processed.</P>
<P>To illustrate the importance of concept processing at a clinical, versus
strictly terminological level, Mr. Lareau gave the example of a patient with
chest pain radiating to the left arm, as opposed to the back. The clinician
might reasonably suspect the diagnosis of angina and, absent other findings,
order an electrocardiogram or cardiac stress test. Even though terminologically
quite similar (many of the same words were used), the concept of chest pain
radiating to the back might reasonably lead a clinician to suspect a diagnosis
of aortic dissection. Questioning about recent trauma or an order for imaging
studies might be appropriate, but a cardiac stress test wouldn't be in order.
Mr. Lareau presented another example to further illustrate the significance of
fully expressed clinical concepts at the point of care. Although many of the
same terms and some of the same secondary concepts were used, neck pain
radiating to the left arm might indicate not angina or aortic dissection but a
nerve problem originating in the neck, for which cervical spine imaging studies
might be appropriate. Two examples included the concept of radiating chest
pain; another pair included pain radiating to the left arm, but Mr. Lareau
pointed out that all three indicated very different medical problems and
required the fully expressed concept in order to be actionable at the point of
care.</P>
<P>To enable efficient point of care use of these concepts, Medicomp organized
them into a hierarchical structure. This hierarchy of pre-coordinated concepts
enabled assignment of predictable properties to each concept (e.g., its
relevance to various diagnoses). With chest pain radiating to the back, this
concept had higher relevance to aortic dissection than with chest pain
radiating to the left arm, although both inherited the properties of their
hierarchical grandparent, chest pain.</P>
<P>The combination of fully expressed clinical concepts and predictable
properties for use by software applications gave software developers the means
to build applications for clinical documentation and decision support usable
and actionable at the point of care. Medicomp recognized that more granular
terminologies might be more appropriate for other uses (e.g., research) and
acknowledged that mapping between terminologies must be a priority for all
terminology standards developers.</P>
<P>Mr. Lareau suggested the Subcommittee give careful consideration to
accommodating terminology needs of healthcare providers at the point of care.
He noted that the organization of the subsets of PMRI terminologies could be
reflected by either establishing an additional subset for point-of-care or
human-interface terminologies or, in a more radical change, including
point-of-care terminologies as a separate type of convergence terminology.</P>
<P>Medicomp believed that, for action, information from the encounter had to
converge at the data storage layer and point of care. The value of a very
granular atomic convergence terminology for research outcome studies and other
analyses was clear. However, even in a large population, outcomes were improved
one patient at a time, a process in which the patient/clinician encounter was a
primary component. At the moment, information had to converge in a way that was
actionable and didn't unduly interfere with the clinical thought process or
lead to decreases in clinician productivity.</P>
<P>Mr. Lareau emphasized that it was important in defining the scope of PMRI
terminologies to consider the role of the patient. As use of the Internet
expanded, patients increasingly became involved in the management of their own
health care (this was already seen in the vendor base of Medicomp's licensees)
and terminology standards had to allow for appropriate levels of participation
by patients, as well as clinicians. </P>
<P>In terms of priorities for the selection process, Mr. Lareau noted that
existing investments in billing, laboratory and pharmacy systems total in the
billions of dollars for equipment, software, and training processes already in
place. Much of the healthcare reimbursement structure was based on the use of
diagnosis, procedure, drug and laboratory codes. The effect of any change in
terminology requirements for these systems might be significant, requiring
extensive modifications to existing applications and reimbursement criteria.
Payers, providers, healthcare enterprises and application developers had to be
given sufficient lead time to implement changes.</P>
<P>From Medicomp's perspective, highest priority should be given to
terminologies directly affecting current, widely implemented processes in order
to avoid push back from vendors: diagnosis and procedure, drug and laboratory
codes. Message-specific codes (e.g., HL7) should be next. Dr. Lareau emphasized
that developers needed a firm understanding of how their systems will be
required to communicate within NHII as well as sufficient lead time to
implement the new standards. Although critical for patient safety, drugs and
laboratory orders, Mr. Lareau noted convergence and point-of-care terminologies
were neither as widely implemented nor critical to processes currently in
place. And he suggested it could be premature to select convergent standards
without having in place the points from which they converge.</P>
<P>Medicomp found the criteria for terminologies comprehensive and appropriate.
But Mr. Lareau suggested the Subcommittee consider that terminologies might
require fully expressed combinatorial clinical concepts in order to be
actionable at the point of care and shouldn't be limited to purely atomic
terms.</P>
<P>Mr. Lareau cautioned that the balloting process required of ANSI standard
developers and the consensus process could inhibit the ability to distribute
terminology updates to end users in a timely fashion and advised that it not be
an absolute requirement. But he said terminology developers should be
encouraged to maintain a practice of timely and public notification of
standards development meetings. He agreed with Dr. Bakken that developers
should be affiliated with an ANSI standard group, such as HL7. Medicomp
believed it was important that all terminology standards developers actively
participate in mapping efforts and provide tools to other terminology
developers for cross mapping.</P>
<P><B>Discussion</B></P>
<P>Dr. Price clarified that in a survey NHS undertook last spring 123
terminology experts described their global pictures of terminology deployment
in advanced health economies (e.g., the U.S. or European Community). Over half
predicted in five years there will still be multiple, impossible schemes. In 10
years, over half expect to have multiple, interoperable schemes; 25 percent
believed there will be a single global scheme. </P>
<P>Noting he sensed from Dr. Price's discussion that, in the U.K., the business
case was perceived as primarily helping the government administer the health
care system, whereas Mr. Lareau said it had to help the physician at the point
of care, Dr. Cohn asked about the business case. Dr. Price said NHS invested
tens of millions of dollars over the last decade in terminology efforts and,
for probative reasons, had to put together business cases on structured, formal
grounds including strategic, economic, commercial, financial and project
management cases. Tomorrow he'd tell how NHS combined central initiatives that
had structured business cases with local implementation initiatives that
resulted in business cases tailored to local requirements.</P>
<P>Mr. Lareau remarked that the publication of the <I>1997 Evaluation and
Management Physical Exam Guidelines</I> provided the impetus for providers to
avoid down coding and the clinical business case became a reimbursement
business case. Nurses and PAs using point-of-care tools at the front end of the
intake process to manage patients with a problem-oriented view of the record
got better information with less clinician time. Individual providers looked on
additional requirements for data collection as a drain on their time (the one
non-renewable resource in the patient care environment) and were protective of
it. There was tremendous cultural resistance toward the patient chart becoming
open to anyone and standardization of codes at the point of care. The premise
that this would help them provide better clinical care had to be proven over
time with other methods of payback. </P>
<P>Mr. Augustine commented that his organization, Gambro Healthcare, was
implementing a pseudo EMR with electronic signature and that the behavioral
component was the most difficult part of the change. He asked what methods Mr.
Lareau found useful. Observing that the change was radical and providers needed
peer support, Mr. Lareau said Medicomp defined an appropriate number of
clinical champions (people who could say, &quot;I did this, you could do
it.&quot;) in each enterprise who identified low hanging fruit. Implementation
of standardized protocols for routine events previously done by the physician
or a PA (e.g., systems reviews, gathering a history, and seeding the record for
the clinician) led to early paybacks.</P>
<P>Noting one criterion was timeliness (how quickly a developer identified new
terminologies, corrections, additions or extensions and incorporated and made
them available to the industry), Mr. Blair asked about the response time
terminology developers needed to update terminologies and get new terms into
their terminology sets. Mr. Lareau said Medicomp had to publish at least twice
a year a full, updated, quality-assurance tested terminology set. Medicomp had
published quarterly, but vendors said they didn't have resources to go to sites
every 90 days. So Medicomp went to a six-month model, and reserved sections of
its terminology cross linked to other terminologies updated monthly. New terms
(not changes of existing terms or synonymy) were available as down loads,
controlled by the vendor, in the six months between release dates. Additions to
vocabularies were easy, but modifications were tough and took longer because
one had to go back and reflect those changes in previous records. The current
model for the RxNorm project strove to support physician order entry and
eliminate the local update penalty by having FDA approved products in the
RxNorm form within a week. Dr. Nelson suggested asking vendors and system
developers about a reasonable time frame for modification of terminologies on a
national basis, but agreed with Mr. Lareau that it would be six months to a
year.</P>
<P>Dr. Price said the READ Code release cycle changed from every three months
to bi-annually four years ago. Occasionally a specific code was published
between releases (e.g., a meningitis C vaccination campaign was unexpectedly
introduced for undergraduate students). Drug releases were monthly and Dr.
Price remarked that people might not be able to prescribe when a drug came on
the market between releases without advance notice. But he noted local codes
could be added and converted to formal READ Codes with the next cycle. Ms.
Bakken observed that the time frame depended upon how rapidly domain content
changed. Implicit in everyone's remarks was the realization that
technology-based terminology services had to be available to local users
between official updates.</P>
<P>Dr. Chute noted any answer was a function of the use case. Any time somebody
couldn't act for lack of a terminology, as Dr. Price alluded, was one character
of use case. But he said that was a modestly small category of dependency;
typically, one had the option of free text opt-outs or local terminology
additions. Another dimension to consider was the complexity of update.
Soliciting terms from users, reviewing, vetting and accommodating them in a
probationary context and incorporating them into a terminology that, in turn,
was distributed and incorporated into systems was a long process. And putting a
singular date or time frame on any aspect could be misleading.</P>
<P>Recalling that Dr. Price said start up took, $20-to-$30 million and possibly
$15 million a year in maintenance costs, Dr. Fitzmaurice said he inferred from
the U.K.'s decision to join with SNOMED that the cost of supplying vocabulary
to one more doctor was slight compared to costs for the initial doctors, but
that it took a large market to amortize that fixed cost at the beginning and
spread maintenance costs. He asked if vocabulary might cost so much to build
and maintain over time that no one segment of the market could support it and
government would have to take collective action--or if the value still had to
be determined over time.</P>
<P>Dr. Price said the U.K.'s approach recognized start-up costs were huge. He
cautioned the Subcommittee not to underestimate marginal costs of bringing on
new users, particularly when bringing on a new-user group specialty. Adding
additional users required distribution and training, educational and health
tech support, and increased the number of requests processed for modifications
as well as the terminology. If one didn't have a centralist, collectivist
approach to managing the national terminology problem, whichever approach was
adopted had to manage the interoperability issues between the multiple
terminologies in a way that enabled capitalizing on them for central
information-sharing requirements.</P>
<P>Dr. Nelson said his own estimate of start-up costs for a vocabulary
concurred with Dr. Price's, but the National Library of Medicine (NLM) had
experience in maintaining vocabulary and disagreed. While he didn't see his
front-end private practice beating down the doors for vocabularies, Dr. Nelson
noted the potential for the common good and recommended, as a citizen, that
this was an appropriate area for government to act. He said the first big win
in computer applications in medicine was when people realized they'd save 20
minutes on the phone by getting lab results on their computer. He suggested
they were looking at the next big win and, as Mr. Lareau advised, they should
keep asking how this helped practitioners. Conscientious practitioners would
respond to physician order entry because it would improve patient safety, but
the longer it took and the less tangible the results, the harder it was for
individuals or institutions to justify a major investment in terminology.</P>
<P>Asked about the role of government and the large fixed and maintenance
costs, Mr. Lareau estimated fixed costs to start a terminology at 10-to-15
million dollars; maintenance costs possibly were lower. But, as the terminology
became widely used, the responsibility for quality assurance and cross mapping
and the distribution and deployment costs rose, becoming more of a burden than
maintenance. Noting providers had been burned by computer systems that they had
to be replaced every three-or-four years, Mr. Lareau suggested that one of the
most important things government could do was provide standards. From the
perspective of someone who developed a terminology and distributed it through
vendors, DoD's announcement that it would use CHCS2 made the code set
sustainable. When the Committee published the recommendations and the Secretary
adopted the terminology standards, some of the providers' reluctance would
dissipate.</P>
<P>Dr. McDonald questioned whether starting a terminology set was even
plausible today. The American Chemical Abstract had all the chemicals, and
other places covered a lot of these contents. He asked if it would be easier if
they started with them. Dr. Nelson said the number he'd agreed with already
accounted for them.</P>
<P>Dr. Cohn reflected on the issue of scope. They'd seen a variety of different
terminologies covering different domains and he questioned the word
&quot;atomic.&quot; In recognizing this variety of needs, the Committee could
nibble off domain by domain or look for larger things that might cover more
domains. He asked what advice the panelists would give the Committee. </P>
<P>Dr. Bakken said she wouldn't encourage the Subcommittee to look at single
purpose terminologies that didn't cover the greater threats from the
perspective of discipline or across the care studies. Considering patient
safety and health care policy led to a multidisciplinary perspective. Dr. Chute
observed that one of the notions of a web of aggregating concepts was that the
source from which these high-level classifications were aggregated would be
multidisciplinary and, ideally, interoperable and interlocking. The question
became what domain one chose for the most targets. Dr. Chute reiterated that
they were dealing with a continuum interoperability issue and that these
domains blend and merge to enumerate almost silo notions of domain sources. He
suggested that might be a reasonable starting point, but doubted it was where
they wanted to end up. Dr. Nelson agreed with Dr. Chute that it wasn't
unreasonable to say there were low hanging fruit and one could establish single
domain vocabularies. But he also noted that other standards that were
high-level codes on procedures (e.g., ICD) couldn't be approached without human
intervention for mapping and that rules needed to be established. </P>
<P>Mr. Lareau commented that, from a practical standpoint, it would be
difficult to define that overarching, multidisciplinary home everything will
map to in a short time period. While that was the goal, from a real world
distribution perspective one had to start with domains widely implemented and
used so people had lead time to implement domain changes.</P>
<P><B>Panel 2: Terminology </B></P>
<UL>
<LI><B>David Berglund, M.D., M<I>edical Officer, National Center for Health
Statistics</I></B> </LI>
</UL>
<P>In considering the scope of the PMRI terminologies, Dr. Berglund noted the
frame of reference the Subcommittee provided the testifiers was based on a
diagram showing different areas connecting contiguous to convergence, which was
represented as SNOMED CT. He noted one issue was what was meant by convergence
and how this differed from clinically specific codes. Convergence could imply
combining multiple systems into one. Dr. Berglund doubted that it was feasible
at this time to use just one system, even SNOMED CT that had a lot of content.
On the other hand, convergence could refer to enabling interworking between
different systems and interoperation. It could be things such as the capability
to use a reference terminology as a basis for creating formal definitions for
code sets, with support for mapping to other systems. For current purposes, Dr.
Berglund suggested that SNOMED CT be considered with the clinically specific
group, rather than separated into its own group.</P>
<P>Dr. Berglund observed that message specific and other codes might be out of
scope based on the definition of terminologies. Code sets weren't the same as
data sets and message formats were different than codes. He suggested
considering them separately, based on different criteria. And he asked about
the extent to which message specific codes were already covered in other NCVHS
recommendations. Other new groups and terminologies Dr. Berglund identified for
the Subcommittee to consider included medical literature classification and the
Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), though he added it wasn't clear the latter was
in scope for PMRI representation. He noted the UMLS Metathesaurus was widely
used, mainly in research settings, for mapping between different systems that
represent PMRI and might meet some needs described under convergence, though it
was based on mapping between terminologies rather then being a terminology
itself. Dr. Berglund pointed that the Generalized Architecture for Languages
Encyclopaedias and Nomenclatures (GALEN) could be considered either with
clinically specific codes or convergence. Released under an open license that
allowed free use through the non-profit organization OpenGALEN, one of its
advantages was a sophisticated ability to use Galen Representation And
Integration Language (GRAIL) language to combine terms. Dr. Berglund also noted
that HL7 and X12N weren't really code sets but specifications for messaging
formats and it was helpful to distinguish them from codes in terminologies.</P>
<P>Noting that standards for messaging and diagnosis and procedure codes were
already specified and widely used, Dr. Berglund advised acting on these first
for PMRI selection. He emphasized that it was important that these standards
remain current and urged expeditiously specifying the move to ICD-10-CM. Citing
the need for clinically specific codes to represent more detailed information,
he recommended giving them first priority among the groups without specified
standards. Drug codes were needed and fast changes in this domain were a
potential issue. Considering that it might not be feasible to have a single
standard, Dr. Berglund said continued use of different systems might be
reasonable. He noted nursing codes were also needed for more detailed tracking
of patient care.</P>
<P>In discussing changes to the preliminary criteria for selection of PMRI
terminologies, Dr. Berglund noted different criteria were needed for different
groups or subsets of terminologies. Selection criteria for messaging formats
and data sets should be different from those for terminologies. And
classification systems intended to aggregate should have different criteria
than clinically specific code systems. Noting that many selection criteria were
based on Cimino's desiderata, Dr. Berglund pointed out that those desiderata
were intended for controlled terminologies with multiple purposes and that many
of these criteria were best applied only to clinically specific group of codes.
</P>
<P>Dr. Berglund advised that the compositional approach or non-semantic
identifiers, while important for clinically specific codes, weren't necessary
for other categories. He said characteristics of the group of terminologies had
to be considered in deciding appropriate criteria. And he noted criteria
specifying relationship with existing and proposed HIPAA standards in working
with message formats and mapping with administrative standards was important
for the consistency needed for subsequent standards specified to interoperate
with the current standards. Convergence was also an issue if it was considered
to be related to interoperability.</P>
<P>Dr. Berglund said the criteria should not encourage terminology developers
to be ANSI accredited. However, timely, public notification of open meetings
for standards development activities were important. Dr. Berglund didn't
believe it was necessary to use an ANSI consensus process for voting/balloting
of new standards: consensus could be difficult to reach, thwarting timely
maintenance, and conflicting interested parties could push for opposing
changes, stalling the update process, and the technical nature of the standards
would limit the usefulness and the benefit of voting. Established processes for
updates for established standards should be continued.</P>
<P>Dr. Berglund noted that CAP was an ANSI-accredited standard developer and
the SNOMED CT structure was a proposed ANSI standard. Even if SNOMED CT was
made an ANSI standard, Dr. Berglund said he didn't see a reason to require that
all the terminologies being considered be distributed using this structure. He
said licensing for proprietary terminologies should ideally be reasonable and
nondiscriminatory, which might require that the costs for licensing be
transparent. Dr. Berglund said another consideration was whether it might be
reasonable in some areas to use one standard for some purposes and another for
other purposes (e.g., drugs). He pointed out that it was preferable to
recognize such issues before mandating a standard, rather than rescinding it.

<P><B>Panel 2: Terminology </B><I></I></P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Steven H. Brown, M.D., <I>Department of Veterans Affairs</I></B><I></I> 
</LI>
</UL>
<P>Dr. Brown said DVA found the organization of some PMRI terminologies subsets
(e.g., clinically specific codes) quite variable in how they were composed and
suggested a better schema would be a domain orientation: pharmacy, laboratory,
diagnosis coding, history and physical exam terms. Dr. Brown questioned the
&quot;convergence&quot; subset. DVA believed a single terminology wouldn't
serve all needs and considered convergence more likely to occur as a series of
incremental steps with interlocking terminologies and complementary content, as
suggested by Dr. Chute. </P>
<P>Dr. Brown noted the administration's need for DVA-specific codes (e.g.,
eligibility, military periods of service, disability codes). DVA and DoD had
standards to meet these needs that could be integrated in the proposed
interlocking set of complimentary terminologies. DVA recommended that resources
be devoted to developing these code sets as needed.</P>
<P>The DVA believed that interlocking terminology sets relating to the domains
of medications, laboratory and problems should have highest priority. Dr. Brown
said there was an immediate need for this core medical data for decision-making
that, in a structured format, could directly impact patient safety and care.
Other high priority items included smaller, targeted vocabulary sets critical
for the DVA Electronic Medical Record (e.g., DNR/DNI and advanced directives). 
</P>
<P>Dr. Brown identified several criteria for selecting PMRI terminologies: (1)
timely update process responsive to field requests (there was a large local
update penalty and DVA had to supply terminology responsive to field need in
order to have standardization), (2) relatively inexpensive to acquire and
maintain (open source when possible), (3) centralized, standardized terminology
services, (4) flexibility to adapt to change processes and technologies, (5)
relative vendor independence; address intellectual property issues
forthrightly, (6) meet informational and computational needs for a healthcare
terminology--terminology should have clearly defined purpose and scope and fit
into an interlocking set of complimentary terminologies required for
convergence. DVA did not believe market place acceptance equated to the types
of aggregation or quality needed to provide care at the point of contact; Dr.
Brown said new developments should be encouraged if they support
decision-making, patient care quality and safety. He echoed Dr. Nelson's view
of atomic concepts, emphasizing the domain of discourse and that the issue was
pre- and post- coordination. Each surface form should have a unique meaning,
but one meaning per concept was implied. </P>
<P>Discussing the relationship to other terminologies, Dr. Brown said automated
and semi-automated mapping was the goal and explicit semantic models were an
important step towards achieving that mapping. He echoed Dr. Chute's thoughts
on aggregation, noting its importance in managing assets and doing population
studies. Dr. Lincoln remarked that mapping was critically important for the
DVA's HDR program. He noted that DoD spent $11.7 million to map 31 sites at the
CHDS-1 facilities to the 3M Healthcare Data Dictionary. Terminologies that
could support automated mapping would be a big plus.</P>
<P>In terms of implementation practices, Dr. Brown said the tools were added
value, but not a necessary criterion for selection. He suggested adding
explicit semantic models capable of formal representation and best terminology
practices (e.g., ASTM 2087). DVA believed that non-proprietary import and
export formats should be supported. Intellectual property issues needed to be
addressed. Additions or deletions from PMRI terminologies should never put
patient data at risk. There should be explicit and scalable models of cost and
opportunities for future migration. DVA was highly supportive of collaboration
between government, academic, and industry partners regarding ANSI. Dr. Brown
said that while it wasn't necessary for all terminology developers to be ANSI
standard developers, he agreed with other panelists that the open process was
critically important. He said an ANSI consensus process would be good.</P>
<P><B>Panel 2: Terminology </B></P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Brian Kelly, MC, USN, <I>Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense
(Health Affairs), the Department of Defense</I></B> </LI>
</UL>
<P>Capt. Kelly, a practicing neurology critical care doctor, said DoD could
live with the grouping of the subsets of PMRI terminologies. He agreed that
these were interlocking, interconnected standards and terminology sets and that
what others said about the domains made sense from a clinical standpoint.
However, he said grouping wasn't as critical as the fact that they all needed
to play well together. He noted that DoD used CDT-3 as its dental standard and
preferred that to CDP-2. And he pointed out that the lack of an accepted
standard for identifying a person in his or her key role (patient, provider)
impeded progress toward implementing a PMRI.</P>
<P>Capt. Kelly said that while DoD had difficulty understanding what was meant
by the convergence code set, he agreed that the message and clinically specific
code sets were most important. DoD frequently used the drug, diagnosis, and
procedure code sets. He said the selected categories were most in need of
consensus, would result in timelier and more effective information sharing, and
were the codes most frequently used. DoD ranked the nursing and other code sets
lower only because these code sets were used less frequently in their
facilities and mostly on the inpatient side.</P>
<P>DoD encouraged the use of repeatable model-based processes and tools to
create and define terminologies, concepts, and relationships between concepts,
particularly for the more complex groups. Selected criteria could be focused
and emphasized for these specific groups (e.g., the use of model-based
processes and tools should be considered for the message-specific codes and
convergence groups). Capt. Kelly emphasized that his staff felt strongly that
this was key to developing the more complex code sets and maintaining
appropriate linkages between them. He added that the relationships among
concepts should not only be explicitly defined, internally consistent,
non-redundant, but also model based.</P>
<P>DoD encouraged future development of complex terminology using model-based
development. Capt. Kelly said that while DoD didn't believe it was absolutely
essential, the ANSI umbrella of organizations added credibility and structure
to the process. He concurred that open meetings were a good process. DoD didn't
feel that ANSI accreditation for well-established terminology and simple code
sets was critical, but in general supported the ANSI consensus process for
voting/balloting on the acceptance of new versions of a standard.</P>
<P>Capt. Kelly encouraged the Committee to closely follow the other federal and
private sector health activities in the standards arena being done by all the
standards development organizations (SDOs), the Consolidated Health Informatics
initiative, the eHI initiative, American Hospital Association (AHA) and AMA.

<P><B>Panel 2: Terminology </B></P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Peter L. Elkin, M.D., FACP, <I>Associate Professor of Medicine and
Medical Informatics, Mayo Clinic Foundation</I></B> </LI>
</UL>
<P>Dr. Elkin shared a perspective gained from chairing the ASTM Standard
Committee on Controlled Health Terminologies, serving as vice chair of efforts
to standardize health informatics within ASTM, and working within HL7 as
co-chair of the Templates Group. He remarked that the categorizations of the
terminologies they were asked to talk about seemed self-expressed by the
terminology developers, and he suggested there was a more appropriate way. He
noted five speakers alluded to similar issues and their need for these levels
of details for underlying clinical knowledge, aggregations for DRGs, clinical
codes, ICD and a network view. Dr. Elkin saw that network view as the decision
support that indicated where on the linear scale one wished to be. For
instance, if one was designing ICD from scratch, one would pick the purposes
for using ICD, note different factors putting pressure on the system, thus
entering into the decision rules for selecting the level of granularity from
the underlying detailed nomenclature. He noted a tradeoff between complexity
and expressivity with compositional systems.</P>
<P>Dr. Elkin recommended adding several new terminologies: the Foundation Model
of Anatomy from the University of Washington, the Dermatology Lexicon Project
sponsored through NIAMS at the University of Rochester, the Patient Safety
Coding System contracted for development by the Agency for Healthcare Research
and Quality (AHRQ), and the Gene Ontology created by the Gene Ontology
Consortium.</P>
<P>Responding to the charge of creating the right sets of quality indicators
for determining PMRI terminologies, Dr. Elkin noted ANSI standard, ASTM E2087.
He advised that clinical terminologies were becoming robust enough for clinical
use. Examples had already been cited, and he said he was confident there'd be
more. He noted competing philosophies on how these should be done; usually
there was a cost for purchasing terminologies and always a user cost. Dr. Elkin
emphasized that the quality of the terminology directly affected its
usefulness. </P>
<P>Dr. Elkin said terminology developers cared about the standards because they
stipulated the features associated with quality and, hopefully, gave direction
for performing high quality evaluations of their terminologies. He added that
terminology users and purchasers also should care because the general
philosophy, now, was caveat emptor. Terminology standards assisted users in
evaluating both terminologies and the strength of the evidence presented to
support their use.</P>
<P>The general characteristics clearly indicated that terminology should be
concept oriented. Dr. Elkin agree with Dr. Brown that this was probable and
meant they should be non-redundant, non-ambiguous, non-vague and have internal
consistency. Dr. Elkin emphasized that all these terminologies should be
evaluated within their purpose and scope. He noted that the coverage of the
terminology wasn't in the criteria, but was central to its usefulness. </P>
<P>Dr. Elkin emphasized the importance of knowing what these terminologies
pre-mapped to and to what they were intended to--and couldn't be--mapped.
Systematic or human-readable definitions were needed along with formal
computer-readable definitions. Relationships needed to be explicit and the
rules of subsumption clearly supported. One needed to know what was intended as
a reference terminology and if the atomic portion was identifiable. Colloquial
(e.g., interface, status or local terminologies) had to be sustained. Dr. Elkin
observed that, with compositional systems that had the expressivity to
represent the full breadth of medicine, it was important when immersed in
compositional terminologies to realize the need for robust, structured
underpinnings in order to avoid unrecognized ambiguity. Dr. Elkin emphasized
the importance, compositionality, of: how that was done, how one made atomic
and composite concepts, specified pre- and post-coordinated terms and the rule
base and types of atomic and pre-coordinated subsets allowed and supported
within the terminology.</P>
<P>He said normalization of content assured that exactly the same terms or
concepts within the terminology were specified in a way that they'd be seen as
the same. Normalization of semantics assured there was no semantic overlap
between different semantic operators within the terminology, preventing
semantic drift. With multiple hierarchies, it was also important to determine
if consistency of view supported explicit uncertainty. How evolving definitions
were supported over time was essential to meaning. So was making sure that
representational form (e.g., the identifiers) didn't influence the usefulness
of the terminology or hierarchies.</P>
<P>Dr. Elkin noted a number of points about maintenance were well covered
within the site of the criteria, but he advocated adding more context-free
identifiers and persistence of identifiers. He reiterated the need for
historical tables: confirming the meaning and semantics of terms at the time
they were stored in the record clarified the meaning for longitudinal record
clarity and identity purposes.</P>
<P>He said there needed to be clearer version control and obsolescent marking.
Redundancy needed to be recognized and people had to be encouraged to work
toward language independence. Terminology developers wanted to update on an
annual basis, while users invariably wanted overnight updates. They settled on
updating the standard at least every three months. Remarking on the need for
criteria for evaluation, Dr. Elkin noted many criteria were basically good
methods for gaining generalizable results.</P>
<P>Dr. Elkin posed a number of questions around purpose and scope. What was the
clinical area of intended and primary usage? Was persistence use expected? Did
the terminology have longitudinality? What degree of automatic inferencing was
intended to facilitate evaluations and mapping? What was the user/developer
extensibility? How was natural language (the user interface most commonly used)
supported? Were other functions (specific physician support or linkage to post
marketing surveillance systems) intended? What was the current status--was it
finished work or a product release? Was it ongoing or something to be evaluated
at this point and at what level?</P>
<P>Dr. Elkin noted there were a number of measures of quality in terms of how
people utilized tools available within the terminology when the value of the
terminology was interlinked with those tools (e.g., the precision and recall of
the terminology within its context). Measures included whether it was
influenced by a standard search engine with the mapping process, did it have
usability, and had it been tested. Was it feasible: had it been tested in real
world environment and was that feasibility demonstratable. How closely did it
align to the clinical environment? And the validity and generalizability of any
studies were linked to their gold standard, relevance, blinding, randomization,
test location, sample size, and personnel.</P>
<P>Mayo Clinic believed that following ANSI standards gave higher quality
terminologies and promise of improved clinical care through a better
understanding of practice and increased availability of decision support at the
point of care. Currently a technical specification in ISO, terminology
developers in about 20 countries in ISO utilized the ANSI standard. It was the
HL7 criteria for use and used by NIH through the Office of the Director for
selection of their drug terminology.</P>
<P><B>Panel 2: Terminology </B></P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Kent Spackman, M.D.<I>, Ph.D., Editor and Scientific Director, College
of American Pathologists, SNOMED</I></B> </LI>
</UL>
<P>Reinforcing what Dr. Price said earlier, Dr. Spackman reflected that, from a
user perspective, there were only two main ways to categorize or group PMRI
terminologies: comprehensive, integrated clinical terminologies and other
clinical terminologies of limited scope. Limited scope clinical terminologies
might be domain limited (drugs, nursing, devices, emergency departments) or
use-limited (messaging, bar codes, reimbursement, user-interface).
Fundamentally, users of terminologies needed a comprehensive, integrated role. 
</P>
<P>Dr. Spackman advised that the way to categorize or group these terminologies
should be derived from the users' perspective. User needs and requirements
should be listed and prioritized. And in selecting PMRI terminologies the
Committee should recommend the development of an integrated whole, tested
against the requirements with a revision/updating to meet them. </P>
<P>Recalling many testifiers said they didn't understand what
&quot;convergence&quot; meant, but emphasized a need for interlocking, Dr.
Spackman suggested they were talking about the same thing. Fundamentally, work
had to be done to meet the user requirement for interoperability. Dr. Spackman
termed that work convergence.</P>
<P>Dr. Spackman urged the Subcommittee to consider the requirements of software
developers and vendors, IT support staff, clinicians and other end-users. He
noted many users said the terminology wasn't useful in and of itself. He
explained that SNOMED CT was developed and tested with user requirements as the
guiding criteria, with input from an industry advisory group; convergent
terminology groups in nursing, pharmacy and pathology; alpha testing of the
structure and content by 42 organizations in six countries; Kaiser, HCA, U.K's
NHS and other large enterprises; and publication of methods for feedback on the
Web and in peer reviewed forums. Dr. Spackman asserted another criterion that
hadn't been emphasized was evidence that the software vendor community
acknowledged the terminology's value by its widespread licensing and intent to
use it. </P>
<P>He pointed out that this wasn't a one-way passive process. As vendors
developed systems using SNOMED CT, the International Editorial Board actively
solicited and responded to their feedback. Requirements and priorities were
closely followed; a direct result of SNOMED's recognition of the importance of
vendor and user requirements. </P>
<P>Dr. Spackman outlined five main categories of user requirements for PMRI
terminology: (1) requirements for patient records and software applications,
(2) general requirements for a terminology, (3) software implementation,
support and maintenance requirements, (4) requirements specific to certain user
communities, and (5) requirements determined by realm-specific strategic
imperatives. User requirements for patient records and software applications
included: the general requirements for a terminology--the desiderata, software
implementation support and maintenance requirements, requirements specific to
particular user communities, and requirements determined by realm specific
strategic imperatives. Recalling Dr. Price's references to the NHS's strategic
imperatives for cancer and heart disease, Dr. Spackman anticipated the need
within the U.S. to be responsive to realm specific strategic imperatives. He
noted that all the user requirements for PMRI terminology were posted on the
Web. </P>
<P>He said PMRI terminology developers in general should be accredited SDOs and
required, if not formally accredited, to at least provide an open consensus
process for input to revisions and update. An ANSI process (e.g., the canvass
or accredited standards committee process) met this need. CAP was an ANSI
accredited SDO and the structure of SNOMED CT was proposed and validated as an
ANSI standard by the canvass process. SNOMED was in the process of revising the
standard based on feedback and were following the open process for that
structure standard.</P>
<P>Dr. Spackman focused the Subcommittee's attention on the pitfalls of
approaching this as only a process of selection that presumed that picking some
grouping or subgroup of the PMRI terminologies listed would somehow meet users'
needs. Dr. Spackman said he saw no evidence that users' needs could be met by
merely a collection of PMRI terminologies. Rather, users' needs required an
integrated whole. He said selection of a small group of complementary
terminologies appeared to &quot;satisfice&quot; (a term he said was coined by
Herb Simon that meant obtaining an outcome that wasn't optimal, but good
enough). But he noted this left significant needs unmet and, from the user
perspective, wasn't enough. </P>
<P>Dr. Spackman identified a number of reasons why integration was necessary.
Many different types of concepts had to be linked to each other (e.g.,
procedures use particular devices requiring linkage or interlocking,
terminologies dealing with allergies had to link to drugs and substances one
could be allergic to). Common concepts occurred across clinical and
professional domains. And many different uses and users relied on the same
information (e.g., documentation, decision support, reimbursement, research and
quality related activities). </P>
<P>Considering cost a criterion, Dr. Spackman said, from a national
perspective, it was far cheaper to develop an integrated terminology. Without
an integrated terminology, the opportunity and incremental costs of system
development and maintenance were orders of magnitude greater. He noted that
public policy makers had a sense of urgency about this that echoed the
experience and perspective of colleagues in the U.K. He noted Representative
Nancy Johnson told NAHIT that if the industry didn't standardize terminology,
government would. Dr. Spackman said the quality of health care at this moment
linked to an ability to mobilize technology and an assumption of
interoperability. </P>
<P>In the absence of an integrated standard PMRI terminology, Dr. Spackman said
they didn't have interoperability. He recommended choosing the &quot;best of
breed&quot; immediately. He noted SNOMED was consistently rated No. 1 by
independent third parties. NLM solicitation cited SNOMED as &quot;the only
source capable of providing the necessary services.&quot; He advised that the
failure of a good faith negotiation effort between NLM and CAP shouldn't deter
NCVHS from recommending this choice that met users' needs and was in the best
interest of health care.</P>
<P>Dr. Spackman emphasized that CAP stood ready to work collaboratively to
achieve an integrated, requirements-driven terminology solution. Major
collaborations included Kaiser Permanente, which used SNOMED CT to roll out an
electronic health record system throughout its program. Other Kaiser clinical
systems already used SNOMED. Noting Dr. Price mentioned had reported that,
subject to successful development and testing, after April 1, 2003 any NHS
computerized information system being developed to support any clinical
information system would use SNOMED CT, Dr. Spackman said CAP considered SNOMED
to have the best track record in developing and delivering what users needed in
a clinical terminology. </P>
<P>Dr. Spackman illustrated with a diagram how SNOMED CT served as a convergent
terminology and others either fully or partially integrated or mapped from
SNOMED CT (e.g., it was possible to take NIC, NOC, NANDA and other nursing
terminologies and integrate the concepts within the structure of SNOMED CT).
Formal agreements with those nursing terminologies explicitly dealt with
intellectual property issues and enhanced this converged integrated whole. In
terms of relative size compared to other terminologies, ICD-9-CM, CPT for
procedures, ICDO within the morphology section, or some of the nursing
terminologies, each represented a small piece in the mosaic of interlocking
pieces within SNOMED.</P>
<P>Dr. Spackman acknowledged that SNOMED needed to be integrated with the core
reference terminology: clinically specific codes (e.g., LOINC), drug codes
(e.g., virtual clinical drugs, U.S. proprietary/clinical drugs in FDA/VA), and
nursing codes (e.g., PNDS, NIC and NOC). He also agreed on the need to map the
core clinical concepts to classifications: CPT-4, ICD-9-CM, CDT-2 and -3, and
ICIDH-2. Dr. Spackman proposed building subsets and extensions to support
linkage or modeling of domain- and use-limited terminologies and urged the
Committee to focus its energy and resources on continuous improvement and
deployment of a core versus fragmented development.</P>
<P>Dr. Spackman advised the Committee that it could make major steps forward if
it required a proven maintenance infrastructure, prevented analysis paralysis
and disruption of a forward trend with industry and providers for &quot;the
perfect&quot; or &quot;the promise&quot; of something unproven. He said the
marketplace was moving to deploy SNOMED CT now so clinicians, researchers and
the public could reap the benefits (interoperability, reduced medical errors,
and improved quality of the nation's health) sooner rather than later. </P>
<P><B>Discussion</B></P>
<P>Dr. McDonald asked how many vendors had made license agreements, how much
they spent on fees for SNOMED, and how many incorporated it. Dr. Spackman said
they all licensed it for both development and deployment. Some had licenses
since January; many didn't. An initial license was $3,000. There was a cost for
deployment in various medical centers. Dr. Spackman said those costs were low
and reasonable. Dr. McDonald countered that some costs he'd received from
SNOMED weren't low. Dr. Spackman replied that some costs mentioned publicly in
this forum were orders of magnitude out of scale. </P>
<P>Noting the first panel said developing terminology cost
$15,000,000-$20,000,000 and maintenance was $15,000,000 or less per year, Dr.
Steindel asked if the panelists considered that reasonable. Capt. Kelly (used
Capt thoughout before, should be consistant) said DoD tried hard not to develop
DoD-specific medical terminologies because it was so expensive, but he couldn't
confirm the cost. Dr. Berglund also couldn't verify terminology development
costs, but he acknowledged they could be significant and expressed hope
development could be done without that level of expense. Dr. Elkin said honest
benchmarking needed to be done, but two things could make the process much less
expensive. Automated tools could generate description logic. Once they had
atomic content, many, if not the lion's share, of the description logic could
be generated algorithmically, decreasing costs exponentially. Mayo Clinic also
favored a model originally developed in the Government Computer-based Patient
Record (GCPR) process that used teams of modelers to initiate creation of
terminologies. Mayo created editorial boards, giving credit (e.g., being editor
of a journal) to junior faculty in academic units that were experts in the
field. and costs were defrayed. Dr. Elkin noted such strategies could advance
careers while decreasing costs of terminological development for any
organization or group.</P>
<P>DVA believed having good tools that employed common technologies (e.g.,
description logics) could reduce costs. Dr. Lincoln recalled Dr. Elkin
recommended benchmarking terminology development costs. DVA began preliminary
efforts with the GCPR. Dr. Brown asked if they were trying to fit everything
into the terminology. He noted they'd said that wasn't a likely approach, and
he suggested they might agree on a way to decide (e.g., periods of service, PNR
codes). But he didn't think one figure could be applied, because the jobs were
different.</P>
<P>Dr. Spackman understood Dr. Price's estimate to be based on a global
integrated terminology that met the needs of U.K., Canada, U.S., Australia and
New Zealand, with translations to other languages. Dr. Spackman advised that
about $10,000,000 per year was the order of magnitude for maintenance. Anything
beyond that was fine-tuning what one did and when, needs met and priorities. 
</P>
<P>Asked to comment on other testifiers' suggestion that tools for description
logic could lower costs, Dr. Spackman said CAP had used description logic tools
for development of terminologies since 1996. CAP also used those tools with
Kaiser and in training modelers; the focus was integration and
interoperability. If that focus wasn't needed, he said a description logic
foundation for the terminology might not be required and it would be easier to
add things. Committing to an integrated clinical terminology that had a formal
logical foundation and used description logic increased the cost because, given
the complexity, it took about six months for a reasonably intelligent,
well-informed clinician to use description logic in a clinical terminology and
become a productive modeler. Improving the tools could make the job easier, but
committing to using them engendered much of the cost of building an integrated
solution. </P>
<P>Mr. Blair reflected that one new thought from this panel was that, while the
cost of developing a terminology was important to consider and reflected in
licensing, royalty agreements or federal payments, all that could be blindsided
by the fact that a far larger cost to vendors and users was implementation. Mr.
Blair asked whether the panelists' found the criteria for selection of
standards incomplete (aside from license fees, they didn't indicate
implementation costs) and about their perception of those relative costs and
what factors, tools and aids a terminology developer might provide to reduce
them. </P>
<P>Dr. Spackman noted they'd focused a lot of attention on building predictable
structures vendors could import into their systems. Structures wouldn't change
release to release. Vendors were given a well-tested set of specifications for
how the terminology would be delivered and the functions of the different
pieces. They'd also focused on how to make the terminology implementable.
Special subsets of the terms and descriptions focused on a particular realm had
to be added for primary care physicians. Dr. Spackman said the vendor community
tested SNOMED and fed back that they'd really appreciate additional features
(e.g., a compendium of the different concepts terms could refer to and the
preferred concept in any search application). SNOMED was developing indirect
response to feedback from the software implementers to ease transition from
just a set of codes and terms to an implemented interface. SNOMED also drew on
experiences of colleagues in the U.K. Dr. Price had mentioned that CT, version
3 didn't receive widespread uptake and that they'd learned their lesson and
SNOMED CT overcame those barriers. SNOMED focused on and considered part of the
integrated terminology whether: one implemented as a big bang or
a-piece-at-a-time, exactly how implementation took place, and how one migrated
users' legacy data. Dr. Spackman said any one who thought this was about
putting a code next to a term had a narrow view of the integrated terminology
task.</P>
<P>Capt. Kelly replied that the important thing was to pick the best standard
and move quickly. Getting to common standards would enable interoperability of
all information systems among federal and civilian health care agencies more
than anything else and decrease total life-cycle costs. Capt. Kelly clarified
that he wasn't saying that they shouldn't strive for the lowest possible
licensing fees, but that those fees would be a small percentage of the
implementation costs. He advised the Subcommittee to look at the qualitative
benefit of standard data, which he said was at the epicenter of all patient
safety initiatives and qualitative ways for improving health care. He cautioned
that it was far more important to pick the best standard and shortsighted to
not pick one because of cost.</P>
<P>Dr. Elkin said he took the question to be about the human factors that might
influence the cost of implementation. He suggested that sound application of
human factors engineering principles, and user center design--both in the
terminology and tool intended to use it--could greatly affect the cost of
implementation, which the group agreed was the bulk of the terminology cost.
Dr. Elkin added a downstream cost he considered most important: inaccurate or
ambiguous data harmed systems, decision-support efforts, and individuals
entrusted to their care.</P>
<P>Dr. Lincoln said DVA also saw tangible benefit in standards and migrating
its legacy systems to new terminology standards was a significant issue. With
even a free standard, DVA faced substantial migration costs. He remarked that
Dr. Brown wrote a paper about the cost of a free computerized PMRI implementing
CPRS at Nashville. Pointing out that much of the cost was for mapping and
converting a legacy system sensibly to the target information system
environment, he advised having the terminology provide tools and methods.
Noting the mapping issue DVA faced with its health data repository and DoD
faced with its CHCS2 clinical data repository were significant, he emphasized
that a way to ameliorate them would be good. Dr. Brown said he'd submit the
paper, adding that DVA had experience mapping to LOINC in its laboratory
environments; implementation costs varied depending upon where one was and was
going. DVA was given a directive to map LOINC across 128 consolidated Vista
sites and lab technicians spent a couple weeks at each site. Dr. Brown said DVA
already had a fairly compatible lab system, so it wasn't a terribly painful
implementation. He estimated it added up to about five FTE. </P>
<P>Dr. McDonald remarked that the implementation they'd heard described covered
a broad spectrum. It cost about a nickel to implement the new version of CPT
(insert the disk and it loaded): others they discussed (e.g., using an
extremely detailed set of codes instead of English) were radical, expensive,
and uncertain developments. Getting all the narrative text and coding meant
care providers had to make many distinctions and more code levels. Dr. McDonald
suggested that if they came up with codes the industry might embellish tools as
they had elsewhere (e.g., an industry sprang up and created hierarchies and
linkages around NDC). He proposed determining the code and letting the industry
construct other knowledge bases on it.</P>
<P>Dr. Elkin noted Dr. Mc Donald's comment could be construed to convey that
clinical specific terminologies weren't a good idea. Although it was unlikely
Pickless would solve the interspace problem for defining concepts within the
detailed health record, Dr. Elkin believed that natural language processing and
post processing techniques could do that without a radical change in practice.
Dr. Mc Donald assured them that he hadn't meant to imply that. Dr. Spackman
agreed with Dr. Elkin that there was a nearer end of the spectrum directly
connected to the benefits expected from the additional information, but he
added that even that level of implementation would be extremely costly.</P>
<P>Noting both DoD and DVA had a history of developing components for
electronic patient records, Dr. Fitzmaurice asked (1) about any collaboration
between DVA and DOD in the development of vocabulary and applications, (2) if
they'd considered using SNOMED to collaborate for sharing physician's notes and
lab and drug information data so a DVA physician treating a former military
patient could see information from best medical episodes, and (3) whether
they'd thought about using SNOMED to collaborate. Dr. Lincoln said most of the
DVA/DOD collaboration in data interchange involved Federal Health Information
Exchange. DVA didn't use SNOMED as part of its electronic medical record. Most
of DVA's current files for drugs, labs, and person demographics were developed
in house, similar to CHCS files. Others (CPT, ICD, and Lexicon Utility files)
were based on national standards. DVA was mapping files not based on national
standards (e.g., document titles) to emerging standards to allow
interoperability between DVA facilities, vista sites and, hopefully DoD. DVA
hadn't looked at SNOMED for that. Capt. Kelly reported that DoD had worked with
DVA on an initial mapping of their data standards and there was fairly good
agreement on many common standards. Both actively participated in CHI (which
would be discussed the next day) and DoD hoped to be a &quot;poster child&quot;
in terms of sequential adoption of various standards. DoD hadn't made a
commitment about SNOMED CT; CHCS-2 used a 3M health data dictionary.</P>
<P>Dr. Berglund reiterated that he'd like to see licensing be reasonable and
non-discriminatory for proprietary standards and transparent licensing costs.
He asked if anyone could estimate the cost for licensing SNOMED for as broad a
use as collaboration between DVA and the DoD. Dr. Spackman said he didn't know
how big DVA and DoD were or have licensing fee figures available, but that
Diane Ashman would know. Dr. Berglund said he believed CAP was moving to be
more transparent in its licensing.</P>
<P>Mr. Blair said that when they talked about using the cost of a terminology
as criteria for evaluation and eventual recommendation, he thought he'd heard
that they should look at implementation costs in addition to licensing. He
asked if the criteria for selection should be expanded. Dr. Spackman advised
that the implementation cost of a good standard would be influenced most by
what came with the terminology and assisted implementation, begging Dr. Mc
Donald's question. Were they talking about the Subcommittee making a
recommendation about codes with a name attached and leaving the rest to the
industry--or were they talking about doing what Dr. Spackman viewed necessary
and accompanying those codes and strings with assistance for implementers, so
implementation costs were lowered by a central effort that met common needs?
Mr. Blair asked if he was saying to add implementation costs to the criteria.
Dr. Spackman replied that implementation costs weren't directly connected to
only the selection of a set of codes; potential savings were connected to other
things a terminology could provide. He encouraged the Subcommittee to consider
the ability to provide them as a criterion.</P>
<P>Dr. Berglund noted implementation costs could be significant and varied,
depending upon the users and what they already had. It was difficult to get an
accurate across-the-board estimate. Though abstract and hard to sort out, how
much the benefits of implementation mitigated the cost was another factor to
take into account. Dr. Lincoln reported that DVA looked at four categories of
costs: acquisition, implementation, maintenance and migration (federal statute
required that data be retained 75 years). </P>
<P>Dr. Elkin agreed with Mr. Beebe: one could grasp this better by dividing it
into practical examples of what implementation costs might be. He suggested
studying the cost of adding colloquial terms to the terminology, changes in
reference terminology, and integrating terminology into the medical record
along with training. Noting they'd talked a lot about cost and that health care
consumed 11 percent of the gross domestic product (17 percent by 2010, given
current health care inflation), Dr. Cohn said they had to be concerned about
the value proposition for anything they recommended. Dr. Mc Donald remarked
that the challenge of cost in this domain was that, for this standard to be
workable, everybody had to use the same code: those who provided the code had a
monopoly. Cost was important because there would be political kickback if they
did that without competing vendors, where costs worked out in a wash. But they
sought common or interlocking codes and so, probably, didn't want competing
vendors. If he was a vendor and told he had to use a given code system and
could be charged anything, Dr. Mc Donald said he'd object. Dr. Cohn assured
everyone that he wasn't saying they didn't need to be sensitive.</P>
<P><B>Panel 3: Terminology </B></P>
<UL>
<LI><B>James R. Campbell, M.D.,<I> Professor of Internal Medicine, University
of Nebraska Medical Center; Medical Director of Clinical Information Systems,
Nebraska Health System</I></B> </LI>
</UL>
<P>Dr. Campbell explained that he practiced medicine at the University of
Nebraska, was an editorial board member of SNOMED, participated in HL7 and
LOINC, and vended terminology services to some 10 enterprises within Last Word
Software. Ten years ago the Institute of Medicine painted their vision of the
computer-based patient record. That vision rested upon a model with a number of
deliverables that clearly required coded or control terminology to create
functionality. At the time, most coding systems were primarily billing,
administrative, and epidemiological systems; since then, several coding systems
had grown to a large enough mass that they could be considered clinically
comprehensive. A great deal of work had been done on messaging interoperability
and associated reference terminologies and technologies had emerged.</P>
<P>Dr. Campbell said he hoped they'd propose today to discuss the path whereby
they achieved the institute's vision, preferably by creating a scenario where
cohesive, comprehensive clinical reference terminology could be available to
share knowledge between computers--what the Subcommittee called semantic
interoperability. Noting a number of publications documented substantial
investments in reference terminology creation and development, Dr. Campbell
said the question was how to go from listing the terminologies the Subcommittee
presented to creating what delivered that vision.</P>
<P>Dr. Campbell suggested that path began by looking, not just at the number of
codes available, but also at the architecture for employing them. He encouraged
the Subcommittee to consider adopting a slightly different model of how to
organize and maintain codes for the computer-based patient record. He depicted
a model comprised of three layers. Going from the center to the outside, one
went from the clinical to the external (or public/ government) layer.
Deliverables for the core layer were shared decision support. The core was a
reference terminology brought together from resources available today from
American standards developers.</P>
<P>However, Dr. Campbell noted reference terminologies couldn't provide
complete clinical coverage for computer-based patient record systems. Other
special interests and departmental systems had to be included in the
overarching clinical structure (e.g., many nursing concepts and associated care
processes historically had been poorly represented in reference terminology
systems and had to be brought out). So the second layer in this model comprised
of modeled code or legacy term sets, or other systems necessary to the clinical
function of the CPR, was modeled on a negotiated basis with a clinical
reference core, within the construction of an information model. Dr. Campbell
defined an information model as an agreed upon set of definitions that took
core reference concepts and modeled more complex or context-rich concepts. An
example from that morning was the question of an order. An order might be
modeled as an ordered set of a number of reference terminology codes, but the
agreement about an order's basic structure was modeling that took the reference
terminology into the broader arena of the entire clinical record. The third
layer was the administrative and governmental layer, with interfaces and a
variety of users who had important needs for the CPR data that weren't
primarily clinical. </P>
<P>The core convergence reference terminology was designed to be comprehensive
across all that was needed for multidisciplinary clinical care. Its primary
editorial policies were clinical. That was its goal and how it was maintained
and developed. Dr. Campbell suggested that, over time, it had to be edited
(based upon feedback from guideline organizations that used the material to
implement knowledge in running clinical systems) to ensure it delivered
knowledge. Preferably, it was maintained by an SDO with a hand off to clinical
professional societies who took over its increasingly sophisticated clinical
content.</P>
<P>The features of the layer two set were modeled codes that integrate
important clinical terminology. These terminologies weren't designed to be
comprehensive (e.g., nursing term sets were never designed as an entire medical
record, but were an important part of the CPR). This layer served departmental,
special purpose, messaging systems, professional and perhaps interface
terminologies that made the CPR easier to use. Everything within this layer was
constructed using the reference core, but modeled into the required context and
behavior based upon meaning values from the original legacy owners. These two
layers had to be maintained in negotiation; a dialogue between the reference
terminology and modeled code sets was essential.</P>
<P>Layer three was code sets required for administration, finances, billing and
epidemiology. Fundamentally not patient care oriented, they follow editing
rules promulgated by organizations that need them. (The purposes of ICD-9-CM
were not precisely the purposes of clinical care.) The reference agency that
managed these code sets basically controlled their content. Dr. Campbell
suggested, relative to what others suggested that day, that this layer probably
was maintained in a different way and held to other standards than the internal
clinical layers, which followed basic concepts of how a reference terminology
was maintained. </P>
<P>Dr. Campbell proposed three major priorities: (1) setting up a collaborative
strategy to define a core reference terminology that could serve clinical
medicine, (2) establishing knowledge-based solid mapping from the reference
core to the third layer (if clinical data didn't yield necessary administrative
and billing data in a relatively seamless way it wouldn't be acceptable in the
American marketplace and vendors needed solid mapping to install and maintain
computer systems), and (3) instituting changes in clinical content coverage
that found within layer two. Dr. Campbell disagreed with previous speakers and
believed it was important to converge nursing terminology with the rest of
clinical care, creating a universal multidisciplinary clinical care model.
Based on efforts initiated by the Institute of Medicine's projects on error
reduction, he suggested that the drug information sets (e.g., Multum, First
Data Bank) be given priority for early instantiation into the model layer. </P>
<P>Though it had gone unrecognized in recent years, Dr. Campbell observed that
when SNOMED RT was released, LOINC and SNOMED basically converged, at least in
the laboratory area. He suggested that convergence be fostered so that SNOMED
CT, LOINC, and NLM's Rx Norm project could be considered as the logical
candidates for realizing a core reference terminology in a short time frame.
Noting that because of negotiation with NHS and its interest in maintaining its
clinical project resource system, SNOMED planned to maintain a national
clinical formulary for UK, Dr. Campbell suggested that considered a part of the
strategy in this core reference terminology.</P>
<P>Dr. Campbell pulled the ICNP codes for nursing into the second layer,
because a number of nursing colleagues referenced their importance in terms of
convergence. He also mentioned ICBO and ICPC under medicine. He noted ICBO was
subsumed within SNOMED and shouldn't represent much of a problem, though the
primary care area was poorly represented in many systems. ICPC was mentioned
most often in reference to expanded codes for primary care.</P>
<P>Referencing the three-layered model and his suggestions about which codes
should go into each layer, Dr. Campbell offered observations about criteria for
code or terminology selection for each layer. While agreeing that it would be
great if this were free, he pointed out that often free didn't cut it in terms
of function. He balanced that statement with the added criterion that core
reference terminology developers must have a business model that organized and
funded timely evolution, distribution, and perpetual maintenance of the
terminology. </P>
<P>Considering clinical scope and organization, Dr. Campbell said the question
of completeness only made sense looking at two layers. From the administrative
perspective, completeness was in the third layer. In the clinical sense,
completeness was in the inner two layers that held the reference terminology
and its cooperating model systems. Approaching it that way, Dr. Campbell
suggested that core reference terminology developers must cooperate within
their negotiated domains to produce complete clinical concept definitions and a
cohesive semantic network defining all central domains of the clinical practice
record. He said the most pragmatic thing was to direct SNOMED, LOINC, and the
Clinical Drugs Project to cooperate, decide where to develop and how to
interact, and collaborate in an orderly way, because that was the fastest way
to reach their goal.</P>
<P>Considering next interaction between the core and second layer, Dr. Campbell
suggested that core reference terminology developers must have cooperative
agreements with layer two developers so that content and editorial evolution
were orderly and cohesive. Remarking that all of this implied an overarching
information model for what they were doing existed within the inner two layers,
Dr. Campbell suggested that the Subcommittee consider as an added item to their
work task that a reference information for definition of complex and
content-laden concepts be developed, and an SDO be identified to maintain this
model, which was necessary for proper interaction between the inner two
clinical layers.</P>
<P>Considering concept orientation, Dr. Campbell noted that much of what the
Committee had done addressed issues of the reference terminologies. He
suggested that many of those criteria couldn't be applied to layer three,
because they had no control over those terminologies. But he encouraged the
Subcommittee to consider what relationships were supported within the core,
because these ultimately became part of the knowledge base used to deliver
clinical decision support. Therefore, he emphasized that reference terminology
relationships within the core must be sufficient in definition and scope to
support clinical guideline implementation. They probably didn't need the most
complicated models in order to be successful with the decision support they
could implement. But they obviously had to have a good subsumption hierarchy
and probably needed a modest number of additional relationships. .</P>
<P>Dr. Campbell identified his assumptions for each layer. He believed core
terminologies provided domain content to support complete clinical reference
terminology. Layer two terminologies modeled, defined, and enhanced important
legacy and departmental classifications and terminologies. Both mapped to layer
three terminologies to support reimbursement and statistical classifications.
Dr. Campbell noted he'd agreed that maintenance releases must be timely, but he
added that varied with different portions of the terminology. And he emphasized
the need for a sound business model. He also suggested that core reference
terminology developers collaborate to have domain content reviewed and
regularly edited by clinical professional societies. And he advised that the
core reference terminologies should be maintained by an open editorial process
in conjunction with professional societies, preferably within an ANSI
accredited SDO. Referencing three terminologies he'd recommended that were
international in scope, Dr. Campbell also suggested considering proper and
useful relationships with international standards such as were happening in
SNOMED CT. </P>
<P><B>Panel 3: Terminology </B></P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Margaret W. Haber, R.N., OCN, <I>Technical Information Specialist,
Division of Cancer Information Products and Systems, Office of Communications,
National Cancer Institute</I></B> </LI>
</UL>
<P>Ms. Haber served as the coordinator and project officer for efforts related
to both division- and institute-level vocabulary development, including the
disease and drug terminology for NCI Thesaurus, a controlled reference
terminology to sort NCI's vocabulary needs from basic and translational
research to clinical care. CIPS Division was responsible for the production of
Physician Data Query, which was NCI's database of evidence-based review
summaries on cancer treatments, screening, prevention, genetics, and supportive
care. As providers of information at the institute level, NCI also worked
cooperatively with the NCI Center for Bioinformatics on NCI Thesaurus and NCI
Metathesaurus, institute-level and meta vocabulary environments that were core
components of the Center's Enterprise Vocabulary Services.</P>
<P>Ms. Haber said the issue of specifications and standards for PMRI and
related terminologies acutely concerned NCI, which was both a user and provider
of vocabularies related to NCI's diverse missions. Ms. Haber remarked on a
historical disconnect of data collection priorities and methods, with
information housed in discrete systems, and coded using different vocabularies
for portfolio management, clinical care, research, public and provider
information, and epidemiology. She noted there also were significant
differences in the meanings attached to particular terms in the vocabularies. 
</P>
<P>Ms. Haber reported that NCI had an inheritance of legacy systems. Achieving
connectivity between established mission critical systems involved complex
issues of data conversion, storage, and retrieval, especially for retrospective
research. Barriers included not only disparate electronic systems, but also, at
times, the lack of an electronic system. Ms. Haber noted that health
information models were also changing with cancer and healthcare shifting from
an emphasis on treatment to prevention. Even more fundamental was the rapid
transformation of disease models from traditional to the new genetic and
molecular classifications. She noted the pace of change in science, technology,
and methods. Vocabulary content and structure had to quickly reflect these
advances in order to remain useful, while still permitting identification and
retrieval of artifacts tagged and coded using earlier systems and vocabulary
versions.</P>
<P>Ms. Haber said NCI approached these issues with Enterprise-level initiatives
to integrate both intra and extramural data resources in collaboration with
outside partners such as the clinical trials cooperative groups. The Center for
Bioinformatics was developing tools and technologies to support these efforts,
including a cancer data standards repository for standard meta data for
clinical cancer research. The Center also collaborated with CIPS OC to develop
NCI Thesaurus. Ms. Haber said that effort was spurred by the realization that
linking related concepts in the fields of population, genetics, developmental
therapies, and disease was essential to NCI's mission.</P>
<P>Ms. Haber said the rapid evolution of information models in cancer mirrored
the challenge of addressing knowledge systems at the broader level of
standardized PMRI. For the NCI, this fundamental and ongoing transformation
meant that any proposed information model not incorporating the assumption of
frequent change would fail. Rapid changes in information models and
technological capabilities meant that standards development had to anticipate
the future evolution of PMRI. Vocabulary standards had to insure the
adaptability of a terminology or information model to incorporate intellectual
content changes. Ms. Haber emphasized that the capability, commitment, and
funding to support frequent and regular cycles and the flexibility of a
terminology structure to map readily to other major component vocabularies were
perhaps even more important indicators of the ultimate success of a standard
vocabulary than an examination of its contents. </P>
<P>HIPAA requires portability, accessibility, and security of data, and hence,
calls for standardized interchange of information across systems. Stable,
reliable, and consistent meanings of vocabularies and codes are a fundamental
component of this requirement. Integrated coding vocabularies are also
essential to building and expanding the NHII, public, private, cooperative, and
federal eHealth, and other related efforts to provide structures and
information resources for personal, provider, and public health data needs.</P>
<P>In examining vocabularies being considered as standards, Ms. Haber advised
it would be instructive to have a table showing coverage of the various
vocabulary and code sets by content domain, as several (e.g., ICD, LOINC and
SNOMED) had crossover content. She said providers should be asked to indicate
depth and breadth of coverage, as well as other quality indicators for each
domain. She noted the omission of some vocabularies necessary to provide
coverage in special domain areas (e.g., ICD-0-3 for oncology reporting). </P>
<P>Ms. Haber recommended that the PMRI selection process accord priority to
terminology development efforts linked to and integrated with related clinical
document architecture, format, and messaging standards such as the HL7
vocabulary standards development process. She noted representatives from major
divisions of NCI would more actively participant in the standards activities of
HL7 as they realized that an inclusive, collaborative process offered the best
opportunity to leverage the power of multiple developers. Cooperative endeavors
at the federal level (e.g., NLM's Rx Norm and the DVA's National Drug File
Reference Terminology developed in cooperation with FDA, NLM and NCI) might
also serve as models for collaborations.</P>
<P>Under the category of General Criterion, Ms. Haber added that vocabulary
sources should have explicit, defined, and regular processes for technical and
content quality review and assurance. She emphasized again under maintenance,
the necessity of a consistent, reliable, rapid update process sensitive to the
changing needs of the national health community. Content control and regular
review by domain experts was essential for usability and validity and should be
a hallmark of every specialized vocabulary or vocabulary domain. She said PMRI
terminology developers should be encouraged to be accredited as ANSI standard
developers. While market acceptance of well principled terminologies could
create de facto standards, she said standards that purported to serve the needs
of a diverse community ought to be open to community involvement.</P>
<P>Ms. Haber said PMRI terminologies couldn't be examined without looking at
tools available to create and maintain them, and the integrity of the mappings
between them. She noted accurate mapping often was a task as complex and as
much an intellectual product as the vocabulary. She added that ownership,
maintenance, and integrity of mappings between major required recording
vocabularies for PMRI should be as explicit as requirements for maintaining
terminologies. And she noted a lack of sophisticated tools for these tasks was
another barrier to integration.</P>
<P><B>Panel 3: Terminology </B></P>
<UL>
<LI><B>J. Marc Overhage, M.D., PhD; <I>LOINC; Senior Investigator, Regenstrief
Institute for Health Care; Regenstrief Institute; Associate Professor of
Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine; Public-Private Sector
Collaboration for Public Health, eHealth Initiative Foundation</I></B> </LI>
</UL>
<P>Dr. Overhage's testimony drew on his experiences over the last 10 years
building a regional electronic medical records system, a microcosm of the tasks
the Committee was charged with undertaking. He said he found the
categorizations of codes proposed in the Committee's Scope of PMRI Terminology
Table in its August 2000 report to the Secretary difficult to work with in
terms of segregating out questions to be asked in order to appropriately
analyze these domains. Dr. Overhage advised it was more useful to take an
object-oriented or entity approach on whether these correspond to specific
terminologies individually or portions of larger terminologies. He suggested it
was more useful to think about units, orders, medications, allergies, clinical
observations or results than aggregated or nursing codes and that this approach
kept concepts more closely aligned. One often encountered the same concept
labeled differently in other terminologies (e.g., adverse drug events). He also
said this approach promoted reuse of the data. Whatever they were going to do
with these terminologies, both the clinical processes and other uses of the
data had to be pulled together. Whether that happened through mappings or other
approaches, it was critical that the concepts be carried forward from the
clinical processes in a faithful way.</P>
<P>Dr. Overhage emphasized that in talking about terminologies they often
talked about more than one thing. He pointed out that for any particular
domain, typically at least three levels or subdomains of terminologies were
conceptually needed. First were questions or variables: e.g., glucose
concentrations measured in serum, a Glasgow coma score assessed by an emergency
room physician, or a discharge diagnosis encoded by a hospital discharge clerk.
Second were answers, concepts or results. Sometimes numeric (e.g., the value of
the glucose concentration) or free text (e.g., portions of a document); often
these were coded as well; e.g., names of organisms or simply
&quot;positive&quot; or &quot;negative.&quot; In the third subdomain were
batteries of codes bundled for convenience (e.g., electrolytes, test elements
belonging to study members 1325, or vital signs).</P>
<P>Commenting on the criteria for looking at these different terminologies, Dr.
Overhage noted they'd heard a lot that day about cost being a critical barrier
and he noted one criterion was that the terminology be relatively inexpensive
to acquire and implement. He also emphasized the importance of acceptance in
the marketplace. Free didn't necessarily insure quality or value; acceptance
and use were a barometer of how good or useful a terminology might be.
Additional criteria to consider included: (1) that these terminologies reflect
clinical realities (e.g., combination drugs), rather than being conceptually
pure, (2) codes should be context-free, as several presenters noted, (3)
compositional strategies needed to be consistent across the adopted
terminologies and (4) consistency with an overall information model such as the
HL7 RIM.</P>
<P>Dr. Overhage suggested that one way to prioritize was to look at the
quantity of electronically available data: what could they take advantage of
today? Another factor was the relative value of that particular domain or type
of data on a global basis. For an individual patient or need, particular data
was critical, but certain things were valuable across many domains and uses. A
third factor was the availability of terminologies that were &quot;good enough
places to start.&quot;</P>
<P>Laboratory results, which already reside in electronic databases in most
institutes, were targets for using those criteria and widely applicable for
patient care. One potential candidate terminology was LOINC, designed to
provide a universal identifier for observations, so information from different
sources could be combined in one electronic medical record system or research
management database. LOINC addressed all three subdomains, dealing primarily
with batteries and questions (variables or observations--serum glucose or blood
culture, batteries such as the SF36 set of questions for patient status
assessment, a comprehensive metabolic panel or a collection of laboratory tests
to assess the patient's overall metabolic state). LOINC started out in 1995
with 4,000 entries, today there are over 31,000 entries. </P>
<P>Dr. Overhage reviewed ways LOINC had succeeded. Government and other
organizations had adopted it. Large pharmaceutical organizations and consortia
considered LOINC an appropriate tool, and CDISC, a collaboration of large
pharmaceutical groups for reporting clinical trials data, had incorporated
LOINC as the key standard. Large reference laboratories utilized LOINC both as
a tool for sharing data with clients and for resolving internal mapping
problems as they purchased and consolidated services from regional labs.
Kaiser, Partners of Boston, Columbia Presbyterian and other large health care
systems and managed care organizations used LOINC to aggregate data from many
sources. LOINC was successful with instrument vendors and test developers,
labeling at the source as tests were defined and developed. And LOINC had been
translated into multiple languages and adopted as the standard for a variety of
initiatives throughout the world.</P>
<P>Dr. Overhage emphasized the importance of keeping terminology domains
conceptually pure and clinical processes connected. Mapping could be a partial
(but always risky and difficult to maintain) answer. Another way to do that was
to differentiate concepts and structures: e.g., an adverse drug event as an
occurrence of some clinical finding associated with a drug wasn't new or
different, but a relationship rather than a concept. Dr. Overhage reiterated
that LOINC satisfied many of the criteria, at least for the laboratory domain. 
</P>
<P><B>Panel 3: Terminology </B></P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Michael Beebe,<I> Director, CPT Editorial and Information Services,
American Medical Association</I></B> </LI>
</UL>
<P>Mr. Beebe said AMA believed that a patient's medical record should include
sufficient information for physicians and other appropriate health care
professionals to assess previous treatment, ensure continuity of care, decide
upon further treatments and clinical activities, and avoid unnecessary or
inappropriate tests or therapy. The medical record was the primary source of
information for a patient's overall health care, meeting all clinical, legal,
and administrative requirements. PMRI was medical and health care data about an
individual, including facts, observations, interpretations, plans, actions, and
outcomes. This description applied to either paper or electronic formats and
the strictest protections of patient privacy must apply to such information.
Comparable and accurate PMRI would assist in realizing the clinical utility of
such information and enhance its value for clinical research and
epidemiological purposes. At the same time, Mr. Beebe noted efforts to enhance
comparability and computer operability must not detract from the fundamental
clinical purpose of such information that focus, first and foremost, on the
needs of patients, their physicians and other health care professionals in the
institutions and facilities where they receive their care. </P>
<P>AMA believed that terminology supporting PMRI should be comprehensive and
include all the clinical terms used by members of the health care team involved
in record writing. Despite the need for sufficient terminology breadth to
accomplish all the varied purposes of PMRI, AMA asserted that terminology
selected be limited to discrete, non-overlapping functional areas, with one
terminology per area. AMA was also concerned about accurate, consistent
implementation of terminologies. Standard implementation guidelines for
terminologies were essential for uniform national application of the code sets.
Mr. Beebe said the purpose of administrative simplification wouldn't be
achieved if health plans and providers implemented and interpreted medical data
code sets as they saw fit. AMA recognized the limitations on the human element
of code application and was concerned about the need for education on all the
code sets or the development of computerized tools to achieve semi-automation
in applying the codes. AMA believed that terminology supporting PMRI should be
able to be cross-referenced with other terminology now and in the future. </P>
<P>Two years ago AMA commissioned a study conducted by Medical Systems
Development identifying a comprehensive list of core clinical data elements for
electronic medical record systems. The data elements identified were derived
from a large number of resources including uniform data sets, accrediting and
licensing agency requirements, industry standards, selected electronic medical
records literature, and electronic medical records vendor system
specifications. Mr. Beebe said the components of an electronic medical record
that most concerned practicing physicians were the core clinical data elements
and he noted that practice management software vendors continued to fall short
in the development of their products. AMA believed the core clinical data
elements (e.g., patient identification and demographic data; special patient
health conditions; allergies; immunizations; health promotion/disease
prevention; past medical history; family and social history; laboratory and
other diagnostic orders and results; therapeutic services and procedure orders
and results; medications prescribed and results) were similar to the
object-oriented model put forward by Dr. Overhage. Mr. Beebe recommended the
Committee prioritize the PMRI terminologies based on current use, practical
applications and acceptance in the marketplace, as well as benefits of the
system. </P>
<P>AMA believed that the criteria identified were acceptable towards selecting
appropriate PMRI terminologies, however Mr. Beebe said it should be divided
into essential and desirable criteria, as well as having consideration given to
domains. He said the four criteria derived from the PMRI guiding principles
(market acceptance; interoperability; comparability of data; and ability to
support data quality, accountability, and integrity) should also apply to PMRI
terminologies. As the Committee stated, market acceptance was primary because
it identified standards that were implementable, cost justified, and flexible
enough to meet the needs of most relevant marketplaces. Mr. Beebe pointed out
that CPT procedure codes: (1) were maintained and updated by the AMA since 1966
and had yearly updates; (2) many products that incorporate CPT had been
licensed, involving over 350 vendors; (3) physicians and many other health care
professionals use CPT almost exclusively for reporting all health care claims;
(4) One hundred percent of health care institutions use CPT; (5) all healthcare
third-party payers that process medical claims use CPT, as well as CMS, the
Department of Justice, DoD, the Indian Health Service (IHS), 42 state
government agencies and Puerto Rico; (6) CPT codes had been used by the
Medicare Program since 1983 and associated with RBRBS since 1992; (7) CPT was
used internationally in South Africa, Mexico, England, New Zealand, Hong Kong,
Belgium, Canada, Italy, Latvia, and Venezuela--translations for Japan and
Israel were underway; and (8) CPT was working on achieving greater
interoperability by developing a formal data model using description logic and
subsumption hierarchies that Mr. Beebe noted were mentioned often that day.</P>
<P>AMA believed that all coding systems adopted as HIPAA standards should have
an open updating process and any interested party should be able to submit
proposals for additions and modifications. In addition, a responsible panel or
committee of experts representative of a broad cross-section of relevant
stakeholders should maintain the terminology. AMA didn't believe it was
necessary for PMRI terminology developers to be ANSI accredited, however, the
organization maintaining the code set should ensure continuity and efficient
updating of the standard over time. AMA believed that PMRI terminology
maintainers should meet the guiding principles expected of current maintainers
of the selected standards. These standards include: (1) improve the efficiency
and effectiveness of the health care system by leading to cost reductions or
quality improvements; (2) meet needs of the health data standards user
community, particularly health care providers, health plans and health care
clearinghouses; (3) be as consistent and uniform (e.g., data element names,
definitions, codes and privacy/security requirements) as possible; (4) have low
additional development and implementation costs relative to their benefits; (5)
be supported by an ANSI-accredited standard setting organization or other
public or private organization that ensures continuity and efficient updating;
(6) have timely development, testing, implementation and updating procedures to
achieve administrative simplifications faster; (7) be technologically
independent of computer platforms and transmission protocols except when they
are explicitly part of the standard; (8) be precise, unambiguous, and simple as
possible; (9) keep data collection and paperwork burdens as low as feasible;
(10) and incorporate flexibility to adapt more easily to changes in the health
care infrastructure (new services, organizations and provider types) and IT. 
</P>
<P>A recent study commissioned by AMA found that seven-out-of-ten physicians
indicated that they and their staff needed more information about transaction,
privacy and security standards. And 72 percent of responding physicians didn't
believe HIPAA would save their practice money. Although AMA had long held that
increased use of electronic financial and administrative transactions could
increase the efficiency of physicians' practices, as well as the health care
system overall, Mr. Beebe said the survey indicated physicians were frustrated
with impending HIPAA regulations. He suggested development of PMRI standards
build on this lesson by focusing on market acceptance and clinical needs. He
said AMA understood that the responsibilities of NCVHS were to evaluate and
recommend PMRI and applicable terminology. However, he emphasized that NCVHS's
responsibilities on this issue were fundamentally different than those for
HIPAA administrative transactions: no federal legislation required
implementation of PMRI standards or the code sets that would apply to such
standards.</P>
<P>Mr. Beebe advised keeping in mind that if used uniformly, PMRI standards
must first and foremost meet the needs of the clinicians where care was
provided. Standardized terminology could be extremely beneficial to the primary
users, the physicians providing medical care to patients. Other uses (e.g.,
research and fraud detection) were secondary. Therefore, he said HIPAA
standards for transactions in privacy and security should be implemented and
demonstrated to be effective before PMRI standards were established.</P>
<P><B>Discussion</B></P>
<P>Dr. Campbell clarified that the core was to be a reference terminology that
supported all basic types of clinical care (e.g., diagnoses, assessments,
findings, symptoms, procedures). Layer two would bring in departmental or
special needs and converge with the core. He noted these concepts could end up
forming a fairly complex model: it might take eight different attributes to
specify an order (i.e., the procedure or result code specified the action
intended and when it started, stopped and its frequency). That information
model defined how the reference core related to the definition of the order in
the second layer. But Dr. Campbell emphasized that the entire inner two layers
would be consistent; internally they'd share many attributes.</P>
<P>Asked if it having that core in layer one was necessary for a good PMRI, Dr.
Campbell replied that pragmatically they were at a point where they'd developed
a critical mass. It would be imprudent to abandon that investment in American
SDO development. Dr. Campbell encouraged moving forward. </P>
<P>Mr. Blair said he was excited by Dr. Campbell's and Dr. Overhage's
presentations and that the Committee needed to look to both to see how to go
forward. He asked about conflicts and compatibilities and if they thought their
visions were mutually exclusive or whether Dr. Campbell's layered model might
be one dimension complemented by another that embodied Dr. Overhage's model.
Dr. Overhage said the two visions weren't inconsistent and could be
complementary. He pictured Dr. Campbell as having the world in the inner layer
of his core model. Dr. Overhage said he broke that down into different domains
that could be sorted, categorized and analyzed, asking where were they today
and identifying migration issues (e.g., drugs were almost always represented in
NDC codes, but every laboratory system had different codes for laboratory
results and there were few commonalities. </P>
<P>Dr. Campbell said he didn't think Dr. Overhage and he differed in basic
ways. He'd detected in Dr. Overhage's presentation flavors of editorial
perception that grew out of the HL7 RIM, which he said was a legitimate way to
look at how to structure the information system. Relative to the information
model he'd referenced, HL7 RIM was designed to determine the appropriateness of
the construction of HL7 message packages and Dr. Campbell pointed out that it
had to change. He suggested that the information model he described had to
occur in negotiation with the standards developers and focus on developing this
broader set of definitions of a wide variety of constructions where HL7 hadn't
much interest. HL7 had been responsible for a lot of message interoperability,
but hadn't looked at much semantic interoperability. Dr. Campbell personally
believed they had to head towards semantic interoperability if they were to
achieve intelligent clinical information systems.</P>
<P>Ms. Haber noted that HL7 had extended beyond simply messaging. HL7 was
looking at comprehensive vocabulary building and clinical document architecture
efforts to collaborate on clinical trials information. She said HL7 was a place
to look for integrated vocabulary concern and development. </P>
<P>Noting the discussion about the different contracts, Dr. McDonald clarified
that HL7 was very interested in vocabulary, but that was still undefined. He
emphasized that considering vocabularies in terms of a particular message
structure was a strong idea, because it kept one from wandering into spaces
that didn't exist or no one cared about. Dr. McDonald said he wasn't
disagreeing with Dr. Campbell's model per se: dealing with things people really
did kept one honest. One could test and see if they worked.</P>
<P>To emphasize that difference, Dr. Campbell referenced a project underway
with IDX aimed at creating an environment where they could transport guidelines
from one institution and computer system to others. Semantic interoperability
required these features and they were trying to do them today. Dr. McDonald
said he didn't disagree with the theory. Semantic interoperability was what
people meant when they said they had messages, but they needed standards codes
in them. Coming back to a model and seeing how something fit in a field and if
it worked in real life was a good way to test ideas.</P>
<P>Dr. Cohn remarked that level two seemed to be a heterogeneous grouping of
code and data sets. Dr. Campbell explained that, as Dr. McDonald often
insisted, the computer-based patient record had a far broader range of
components than they were sometimes willing to account for. They shared many
elements and the question was how to bring them together in a model that
unified. With a computer information system that knew the relationship between
what one ordered and the result, order sets could become customized,
problem-oriented data displays. The information model was created in the second
layer and, with the various terminologies cooperating, one ended up with a
modeled environment entirely consistent throughout the clinical layer. Dr. Cohn
said he understood the model, but not why many other elements were there.
Acknowledging there were &quot;funny&quot; neighbors, Dr. Campbell gave an
example. He served as a middleware vendor of interface terminology for other
IDX sites using SNOMED, maintaining entrance terminology in order to do
physician problem list recording which was simply provided by creating
pre-coordinated concepts. SNOMED's goal wasn't to create every concept known to
man; compositional environments focused on that. </P>
<P>Dr. Cohn said he was confused by the way Dr. Overhage described LOINC; he'd
thought the identifier accompanied the results coming back; usually one didn't
know analities when ordering. He asked if they were saying this wasn't the
answer, but the question. Dr. McDonald replied that one thought of a question
as a synonym for a variable or a parameter (e.g., the OBX segment of HL7, the
variable, could be sugar glucose, diastolic blood pressure, the Glasgow coma
score, or a survey instrument question). The question was connected to an
answer, whereas a variable had a value. Calling the result a question with an
answer returned was synonymous and perhaps easier for non-technical people to
grasp. </P>
<P>Referencing Mr. Beebe's written testimony (&quot;Therefore, the AMA believes
the government should limit its focus to broad recommendations for medical
terminology framework with the specific code sets maintained by the private
sector&quot;), Dr. Fitzmaurice said he didn't think anyone had a problem with
the private sector maintaining code sets. But he wondered if Mr. Beebe meant
the government should limit its focus to broad recommendations, rather than
mandate a particular terminology, code set or functions when it interacted with
the private sector. Mr. Beebe said he meant the Committee should make
recommendations for criteria, rather than specific code sets. Dr. Fitzmaurice
contended that the Secretary would be better served if one of the Committee's
functions were to make specific recommendations about codes sets or
terminologies. Mr. Beebe replied that, if the criteria were specific enough,
code sets that went with the criteria would be implied. Dr. Fitzmaurice said
that was like wiring it to a particular terminology or code set. Mr. Beebe
agreed.</P>
<P>Recalling that Mr. Beebe had singled out criteria for selecting PMRI message
format standards that the Subcommittee hadn't thought could quantify, Mr. Blair
asked which ones Mr. Beebe wanted brought back and how they might quantify or
measure them, noting uncertainty about that was why the Subcommittee left them
out. Mr. Beebe said he believed many of the more practical elements on the list
of HIPAA guiding principles should be relevant for PMRI standards, because they
dealt with basic issues of market acceptability and clinical context used by
physicians and other health care providers on a day-to-day basis for patient
care. He agreed with Dr. McDonald that they shouldn't go into more ephemeral
notions outside of what was currently done, but needed to pay attention to
practical, rubber-meets-the-road issues. Mr. Beebe clarified that providers and
payers weren't charged for transactions from hospitals. AMA charged a flat rate
of $50 for the data file and $10 per user for licensees. Information about
volume discounts was on the Internet. </P>
<P>Dr. Steindel said one of the most fascinating things he'd heard was Dr.
Campbell's idea about looking at things. He asked what was contained in the
core; how it related to layer two; how much of layer two was subsumed in the
core; and how much of the relationship between the core and layer two was
contained in the information model. Dr. Campbell recounted recent discussions
with the nursing associations where they defined a goal as a finding they
wanted to observe at some future point, possibly related to a specific
intervention. From that, one could construct a semantic model detailing
attributes, evaluation dates, procedures, and responsibilities. Dr. McDonald
noted HL7 models explicitly defined goals that way. Dr. Campbell said standards
organizations had discussed this widely. It was an example of how a concept
from a nursing domain negotiated its definition with a reference core. The
legacy terminology (goals that were part of past nursing terminology efforts)
could be modeled and incorporated with legacy terminology as part of the
convergent terminology systems. Dr. Campbell said they had a way to build goals
for new care plans--ones that didn't require as many new elements, but created
the context that linked those elements together.</P>
<P>Dr. Steindel remarked that this went along with what Ms. Greenberg had said
about the linking between clinical document architecture and the structure in
which the message was sent, and the way in which context could make terminology
less ambiguous. Dr. Campbell noted a constant tension between SDOs and these
schemes, which were really context-ridden situations. All could be served, but
they had to come to some agreement about their definitions.</P>
<P>Dr. Fitzmaurice asked Dr. Campbell if he saw the core layer as being equal
to RIM. He also recommended that, when an SDO developed a standard, it map
itself to the core and then back out to the function in level two. Dr. Campbell
said he'd deleted that from the requirements list, because the reference
terminology model was created as part of the process. The most mature candidate
reference terminologies were enabled and encouraged to collaborate.</P>
<P>Asked why some classifications were in the second layer and others in the
third, Dr. Campbell explained that both Dr. Overhage and he were pragmatic. A
pragmatic that separated some classifications was whether they had any
realistic likelihood to manage their content. ICD obviously had its own
existence and purposes. ICPC was meant to be classifications of activities for
primary care. Primary care doctors reported that some things in ICPC weren't
well represented in SNOMED. But Dr. Campbell suggested that, if there was a
dialogue between SNOMED and ICPC and definitions, they could come within the
core and better serve primary care physicians. Ms. Greenberg noted there was
also a dialogue between ICD and ICPC and comparability between DSM and ICD. Dr.
Campbell said another reason for a line between the second and third layers was
that some things were primarily necessary for the clinical environment. One
could argue whether ICPC was necessary; Dr. Campbell believed it seemed
logical.</P>
<P>Mr. Blair said he had the impression that there was a conceptual difference.
He suggested that HL7 had developed a RIM that enabled it not only to develop
new messages, but also improve interoperability for messages. That was its
purpose and, in doing that, one drilled down to the semantic level for greater
specificity. But Dr. Campbell started with a core purpose of semantic
interoperability. Dr. Campbell indicated a need for harmonization or mapping
between RIM and the core of his semantic interoperability construct. Mr. Blair
pointed out that might be different than drilling down from the HL7 RIM.</P>
<P>Dr. Campbell agreed: from the standpoint of semantic interoperability to
support guidelines, a disease or disorder should have attributes of what caused
it and what organ it affected. Those were common inferences and one might want
to reference all streptococcal cases, whether impetigo or strep pneumonia,
pneumonia, or endocarditis. If the core reference model's definitions included
an etiology attribute, those categories were supported readily. Vendors didn't
have to add that knowledge. Dr. Campbell noted HL7's interest was different.
HL7's driving interest in their model of assessments, data records they
connected to, and fields was to ensure that one could look at an HL7 message
for an order and know when any element wasn't included. RIM clearly indicated
what should be part of that construction. </P>
<P>Noting skepticism, Dr. Campbell said HIPAA requirements could create more
work than they could do. But he added that the Committee had the ability to
nudge that next step forward, because many in the vendor community were waiting
for clarity about the tools they would use.</P>
<P>Dr. Overhage differed with Dr. Campbell's timing, believing they had an
opportunity to nudge interoperability near term by agreeing on how to code at
least conceptual elements. He said trying to get to the shared knowledge
representation in five years was ambitious, and he pointed out that they didn't
have to be intimately tied together. He suggested thinking of spoke radiating
out from the center of Dr. Campbell's three-layered model, the core convergent
reference terminology, which conceptually segregated the data. Problems,
symptoms and diagnoses might be one of those wedges represented in existing
established reference terminologies (e.g., nursing, ICPC, ICD-9). Dr. Overhage
agreed that, to the extent possible, they wanted to separate clinical and
administrative uses and not be unnecessarily bound by administrative uses,
though sometimes these might be prudent. He said he wasn't convinced that the
most important thing, near term, was to build the knowledge base that tied
everything together. He'd be happy when that came, but he didn't believe
progress had to be held up to include it.</P>
<P>Dr. Campbell concurred. In 1992, they had semantic networks and
30,000-40,000 concept nodes. Semantic networks within this model now had
400,000 nodes. Content had substantially changed. </P>
<P>Dr. McDonald commented on two distinctions he heard in what Dr. Campbell
said. He'd talked about how with real knowledge independent of the patient data
one concluded connections. Dr. McDonald applauded that, noting they could do
it. The other distinction was in the semantic node model: by making
connections, one could create anything without a database. Dr. McDonald
cautioned that the codes in specific fields had to be interoperable or
remappable in order for a message to be interoperable. He said they had to pay
attention to overlap in the models, because there was a model within the
semantic and they didn't necessarily fit unless developed tightly. </P>
<P>Dr. McDonald used the goal in HL7, which was modeled as a test result or
question, as an example. He cautioned that, if they weren't careful, they could
end up with a great vocabulary system and database model akin to the message
model.</P>
<P>Contending that Dr. McDonald argued at the fringes of the compositional
network, Dr. Campbell reiterated that the network already had expanded. Dr.
McDonald said they couldn't assume that with either theory, but had to get
things rubbing together. He contended that was why Dr. Overhage's idea about
concentrating on a particular reference model and how this network worked
within that context got there faster.</P>
<P>Dr. Elkin observed that most the discussions were galvanized by a
concentration on existing artifacts (e.g., LOINC, SNOMED, ICD) and positioning
them to reach a conclusion. But he asserted they needed to think about the
abstract pieces they had to put together to make this work and see if existing
artifacts helped solve the problem. With an atomic reference terminology,
they'd think about core concepts that couldn't be divided further within the
base terminology that represented core concepts within health.
Pre-coordinations within that terminology were above that. A unique identifier
meant a particular concept, but could be made up of two or more other concepts
within that terminology. Medical knowledge hung on some of these facts: e.g.,
colon cancer, which could be a malignant neoplasm of the colon, came together
and meant exactly the same thing. However, things needed to be said about colon
cancer (e.g., a diagnosis by finding a polyp on endoscopy) that couldn't be
said separately about other things. The LSCT trial indicated they couldn't
clearly pre-coordinate a terminology large enough to represent all they might
need to say. Post-coordination had the same format and formalism as
pre-coordination, but didn't exist within the terminology and had to be made up
with multiple codes. </P>
<P>Dr. Elkin said this system of interaction had perfect places to hang
interface or colloquial terminologies they'd discussed (e.g., the one Dr.
Campbell used in IDX) that might not be totally mappable to a reference
terminology. Dr. Elkin emphasized that Dr. Campbell's terminology was mappable.
Those codes functioned as interface terminology and could be within the
framework without changing anything about the model of the system it worked
under. As one built semantic interoperability with this model, and looked at
the information model in the world and coded it by the exact same terminology,
one found a seamless transition between the world one lived in (the information
model) and what it needed to represent (the terminological model). Dr. Elkin
said this formed a continuum and basis for going forward. He suggested that
every one of today's products had a piece of what they needed--and in other
ways was flawed. Understanding that provided the best opportunity to move
forward.</P>
<P>Dr. Carol Bickford, speaking for the American Nurses Association, remarked
on the need for a code set for the public health environment (particularly in
light of the bioterrorism initiatives) and discussions about supporting pieces.
She pointed out that a concept of wellness and health was missing. Noting the
focus on pathology, she encouraged the Subcommittee to be more expansive and
not necessarily describe today's world, but push the envelope so whatever
structure was put in place supported new knowledge and relationships.</P>
<P>Dr. Spackman mentioned that the Context Working Group within SNOMED
recognized interactions between what could be defined with the core reference
terminology model and other architectures that could make assertions about a
patient in a record: e.g., HL7 RIM, CEN EV13606 standard, or Open GAR. SNOMED
terminology could indicate knee pain, but couldn't convey knee pain present in
this patient, at this time, in this record. That had been considered the
responsibility of the record or message architecture. The group recognized a
responsibility on the part of the terminology standard and these messaging
standards to identify overlapping areas, have a formal structure both could
translate representations to, and coordinate with all these models.</P>
<P><B>Discussion on Terminology</B></P>
<P>Dr. Cohn noted the Subcommittee had one day of the October hearings and a
day in December for more input. They'd schedule more time in 2003. The intent
was to have a letter for the Secretary by the June meeting. Members noted it
took at least two meetings to develop a letter and there would be two-three
sets of hearings before June; they had until March or April for a draft.
Whether they had a draft by then depended on the complexity of the information
gathering. The Subcommittee will check schedules for the first-half of 2003. 
</P>
<P>Mr. Blair noted they'd heard testimony on the scope, including suggestions
for a different perspective, and feedback on criteria for selection,
priorities, and whether things should be ANSI-accredited. He recalled that the
testimony didn't diverge much from the criteria for selection, though it might
be divided into criteria for different categories and Mr. Beebe considered it
an editorial of desirables. Mr. Blair will shape the hard-copy testimony into a
matrix and dig deeper into Dr. Overhage's and Dr. Campbell's models and clarify
information with both. The Subcommittee will review the input in October.
They'd heard testimony on the scope and criteria for selection, and Mr. Blair
noted they had to decide how and when to gather information from terminology
developers so they could match it against criteria. He remarked this would be
more demanding than with the message format standards; many issues were more
complex and they'd need assistance from a consultant with medical terminology
expertise. In October they'd identify criteria and further questions. But Mr.
Blair asserted that the most important questions might not be answered without
having someone with terminology expertise follow-up with personal or telephone
interviews and pull that input together in a digestible way. In
November-December, they'd hear from terminology developers; January-March,
they'd hear from users. Hopefully, in March-April, they'd begin looking at a
draft. </P>
<P>Acknowledging he wasn't clear yet that they had scope or focus, Dr. Cohn
addressed the business case. They'd heard several themes, including lab
terminology and drugs. The next hearing might provide an update on the
DVA-NLM-FDA effort. Other pieces were what payers, providers and vendors
considered the high-value and an IOM activity looking at patient safety data
standards they'd probably hear about this fall.</P>
<P>Dr. McDonald suggested sending the mailing to developers of the codes as
well as message developers; they already had a template and could wrestle with
criteria between meetings. Mr. Blair agreed that could get much of the
information and the consultant could follow-up. Noting they'd hear about price
if they made this a required standard, Dr. McDonald suggested looking at the
cost for a 300-bed hospital with 500 patients. Mr. Blair will compile a
derivative of the testimony and a draft of the questionnaire to look at in
October, e-mailing them in advance if possible. </P>
<P>Given the testimony, Dr. Cohn suggested they'd have more insight on
potential criteria and approach than the issue of scope and high value. Dr.
Yasnoff agreed that business case issues for vocabulary were more difficult;
whatever their recommendations, expenditures would be much larger than for
message format standards. He suggested a business consultant do a formal
analysis of the business case for development and maintenance of a PMRI
terminology and user cost of implementation. Dr. Yasnoff noted several business
cases (e.g., adoption by health plans or providers). Much of the testimony
indicated a single vocabulary would be better than if everyone developed their
own, but Dr. Yasnoff said quantitation could bolster the recommendations. </P>
<P>Though hard to quantify its long-term benefits, Mr. Augustine said standard
terminology would be increasingly important with health care inflation in
double digits and baby boomers eligible for Medicare. Dr. Cohn asked Mr.
Augustine to work on this model. Mr. Blair noted the business case wasn't just
the cost in expenses and maintenance, but also value. Dr. Yasnoff suggested
recounting how much DVA and DoD spent developing vocabularies--costs that could
be avoided with a standardized terminology. Dr. Steindel noted they'd be
reviewing a lot of this data assisting CHI. He predicted that much of the
business case's justification would be the non-quantifiable opportunity costs
of not doing this. Mr. Augustine said another way to bolster the business case,
though it also wasn't quantifiable, was with examples of what could be done
(e.g., physician guidelines): instead of referencing ICD-9 and CPT codes (an
inexact science), one could see physician practice patterns in the aggregate
across the health system, bolstering opportunities both technologically on the
research side and for fine-tuning reimbursement systems.</P>
<P>Dr. McDonald revisited the question of Subcommittee's end game. He believed
they were talking about turning text into codes, which assumed either extensive
labor activity (not likely to be welcomed by a health care industry trying to
reduce costs) or progress in natural language processing, and he proposed
considering both in this analysis. Dr. Cohn suggested considering the issue of
short-term versus long-term and dealing with Dr. McDonald's point about things
ambiguous and uncertain. Dr. McDonald observed finding slots for what moved
around was less of a leap. Noting people were making large investments in
longer-range solutions, Dr. Cohn said a case could be made for cost-and-time
effective ways to provide more decision support or data capture capability. Dr.
McDonald concurred, but instead of entailing huge changes in process or
spending substantial funds before anyone succeeded, he encouraged using
vocabularies richly. </P>
<P>Mr. Blair recalled that during the decision process on message format
standards, an extremely compelling point heard from vendors and end users was
how they'd invested heavily in HL7. Dr. McDonald agreed the Subcommittee should
hear their testimony. </P>
<P>Dr. Steindel addressed the scope of the letter. Dr. Price had said NHS spent
over 13 years developing the U.K.'s terminology model and the system's first
round of testing was still a year away. The Subcommittee was told there was
only one terminology &quot;out there&quot;; Dr. Steindel asked where the
good-use cases were. He emphasized the need to determine what to concretely
propose in the letter and models, noting CHI grappled with that question and
that they'd heard about low hanging fruit that might lead to recommendations. 
</P>
<P>Dr. Steindel noted Dr. Campbell had just introduced his way of looking at
terminology and the informatics community hadn't had time to discuss how it fit
in with everything else. He suggested the Subcommittee do as they'd intended
and define criteria for a questionnaire for people developing or thinking about
terminologies, and ask vendors how to meet these selection criteria. Dr.
Steindel said they needed to determine the extent of overlap and ask if these
groupings made sense. He said the Subcommittee might want to devote time to
discussing all they'd heard. Dr. Cohn proposed that they needed to hear from
vendors and potential users, ensuring everyone thought the same and shared
priorities. He agreed that, based on what they'd heard, a strong business case
had to be associated with everything. And he suggested that they might decide
tomorrow to leverage what they learned CHI might be doing. </P>
<P>Dr. Yasnoff emphasized that a more formal approach to the business case was
an essential underpinning to making the right recommendations and provided a
rationale and substantial backing for those choices. Dr. Fitzmaurice summarized
what he'd heard: overall the criteria were right, most candidate codes had
usage and, depending on scope, there'd be different criteria for various
aspects, everybody said start either with labs or drugs, they'd heard much
about economics of terminologies, a vision of interoperability was built on
terminology adding value to databases and value added to legacy systems as one
mapped to research, syntheses or clinical practice guidelines, nursing codes
could be used to improving health care processes, determining the value of
mapping, many criteria dealt with quality of codes and terminologies,
terminologies weren't independent in the long run, timeliness was an issue, and
what was the value (relative to cost) of a piecemeal versus whole terminology
approach?</P>
<P>Mr. Blair noted Dr. Campbell and others proposed, even with a stair-step
approach, giving priority to the clinically specific core. His understanding
was that Dr. Campbell proposed an alternate way of organizing their scope
model. Dr. Fitzmaurice depicted it as having everything that helped care for a
patient in the middle; beyond that were departments organized around taking
care of patients. On the outside was administration and infrastructure. Mr.
Blair agreed. He added that Dr. Campbell had looked at the scope the
Subcommittee offered as a starting point and responded that his representation
was a better way to view, organize and prioritize. Dr. Fitzmaurice said he saw
a lot of relationships in Dr. Campbell's inner core. Mr. Blair concurred, but
he questioned how they'd evaluate whether other terminologies mapped or related
to it if they wound up their evaluation of standards and still didn't know what
the core was.</P>
<P>Dr. Fitzmaurice said he saw many relationships in Dr. Campbell's inner core.
Dr. Fitzmaurice reflected that the vision around the table of what they wanted
to do with terminology and codes was constant. But he suggested the time it
would take to describe and show relationships could be best spent following a
piecemeal approach choosing standards, until they'd built up the core. Dr.
McDonald noted they were about to pick ICD PCS, a clinical code set;
operationally, this next year they'd be piecemealing. Dr. Fitzmaurice said they
should feel comfortable using Dr. Campbell's model as a concept with a
piecemeal approach to individual standards and not worry it fitting into Dr.
Campbell's center core. Mr. Blair said he'd be uncomfortable making that
decision until they pulled everything together and examined it carefully. </P>
<P>Dr. Steindel recalled Dr. Overhage's comments that Dr. Campbell's model
could be built in pieces and looked at from a structural point of view of how
select parts fit together in the various layers. He contended that Dr.
Campbell's model required a new set of thoughts they weren't prepared for. It
had many places to hang concepts, but he didn't know where the hooks were, yet
he knew there were things he could put on them. Ms. Greenberg concurred it
would be premature to embrace. She questioned an underlying assumption that
components in the external layer didn't have clinical meaning or utility; She
said that wasn't necessarily true for ICF. Dr. McDonald agreed that many
administrative things were rich with clinical data. Ms. Greenberg said
essentially, right now, there was only one reference terminology, and many
could embrace consistency and some reference terminology with either mapping or
models. Dr. Steindel agreed, adding that he wasn't sure there was a third
layer. The distinction between what Dr. Campbell put there as administrative
code sets or components in billing blurred, as Ms. Greenberg had noted, with
what went in the second layer. Rephrasing Dr. Campbell's, &quot;Does it map to
a reference terminology?,&quot; Dr. Steindel asked, &quot;Could it?&quot;</P>
<P>Dr. Yasnoff depicted the model with reference terminology at the core and a
layer around it formed of terminologies consisting of compound concepts and
terms from the reference terminology. The third layer consisted of aggregations
of simple and compound concepts into higher-level terms. He suggested the
Subcommittee ask other vocabulary people to look at the model and convey their
view of its utility, significance and value at the next meeting. Dr. Cohn
agreed that asking others that testified to comment might be useful.</P>
<P>Dr. McDonald clarified that the compositional/non-compositional in Dr.
Yasnoff's comment weren't accurate: the core had RxNorm as the clinical drug as
well as SNOMED and LOINC and each had things compositional. Dr. McDonald
cautioned that political/social decisions might not create what they wanted to
move forward. He suggested some things (e.g., ICD-9-CM) were ripest and used
everywhere. Expressing concern that the Committee already said in its previous
letter that HL-7 RIM should be the core, Dr. McDonald urged they resolve where
the first modeling occurred. Vocabulary modeling was independent; working
piecemeal or stepwise was the only way to make progress with other modeling. He
encouraged blessing things in level three that already were making progress. 
</P>
<P>Dr. Cohn said the Subcommittee had to contemplate the core model and
whether, as Dr. McDonald queried, it was RIM or this conceptual model. They'd
talked a lot about terminology versus information models, but needed a way to
describe the core model that helped everyone. Mr. Blair said Dr. Campbell
seemed to propose, while RIM might be the information model, considering a
semantic interoperability model. He recalled that the Subcommittee indicated in
its message format recommendations that all other message format standards
needed to coordinate or harmonize with RIM, because they felt interoperability
was driven by RIM for message format securities. He said they needed to discuss
whether that meant all terminology should be derivatives of RIM. </P>
<P>Dr. McDonald suggested the question was whether they decided the vocabulary
fit together in some abstract sense or chose a process identifying what was
sent and where and ensured there were places in the vocabulary model describing
what went there. Mr. Blair noted Dr. Overhage felt, pragmatically, they'd move
faster if they determined the terminologies needed to be clinically specific
and drove down from RIM; Dr. Campbell was saying other health care information
objectives besides messaging benefited from his model. Dr. Elkin suggested
there were only two options for merging the information and terminology models
that allowed semantic interoperability: either they agreed to be
non-overlapping and coordinated or they overlapped and, at those points, had to
be identical. Dr. McDonald cautioned about assuming success with the model
building on its own and vocabularists, noting they had to think in terms of
object structures and what made messages interoperable. Vocabularies had to be
standardized, focusing on key pivotal vocabulary fields and others like patient
ID. Some could be dealt with fairly rapidly. Additional vocabulary would be
needed as they got into details.</P>
<P>Dr. McDonald noted a database was needed to help connect the vocabularies
together. Members discussed gaining input from HL7's Vocabulary SIG, Jim
Cimino, and RIM. The next step was to standardize vocabulary, which could get a
lot of &quot;bang for the buck.&quot; They still had to decide who provided
that standard, but scope should be decided based on the law, what was already
done, and what came next.</P>
<P>Mr. Blair agreed but expressed concern that there was also a sense of
urgency to move in parallel with semantic interoperability. Dr. McDonald
clarified that in his view the messages didn't work because they didn't have
standard codes and so lacked semantic interoperability. That required a lot of
mapping, making it hard to communicate outside one's organization. Dr. McDonald
said a perfect analogy for this knowledge tree was what the community pharmacy,
First Data Bank, did with a code that hadn't been very useful until First Data
let people aggregate it differently (e.g., &quot;Was it Medicare
approved?&quot; &quot;Was it generic?&quot;) He predicted that, if they got
these base codes done, there'd be a flowering of opportunities to aggregate,
classify and identify specific connections and relationships. Mr. Blair noted
the need for a balance. Dr. Cohn asked if the answer was to at least do one,
and as much of the other as possible. Dr. McDonald queried whether to
standardize this or encourage the industry to provide it. And he noted messages
needed common vocabulary notes and fields, so all machines could use them.</P>
<P>Dr. Cohn added that, preferably, this meant there was some agreement on how
all these things fit together, so everyone's retrievals matched. Dr. McDonald
concurred that, in different worlds, this external information (e.g., glucose
is a carbohydrate) would be tremendously useful, because one could do logic on
it. Dr. Cohn said they were in agreement. </P>
<P>Once they got down to the right terminology, Dr. Steindel said there was
agreement. He recalled Dr. Elkin saying the information and terminology models
overlapped. Part of the terminology model fit into, but weren't covered, in the
information model. They needed a &quot;grammar&quot; on how to combine those
bits so it fit. Dr. McDonald noted grammar could be inserted, but most places
sought bigger code. </P>
<P>Dr. Steindel encouraged suspending the information-versus-terminology-model
mindset, emphasizing a continuum and the reality that some things (e.g., Dr.
Campbell's medical guidelines project and CDC's public health case definitions)
had to be combined to realize all the expressions. Noting they'd been told that
in October they should hear about an interface piece and opportunities, but the
profession had talked about this a long time and the next day a coalescence of
groups would look to them to get something on paper, members discussed
listening to all the ideas the next day and then, drawing upon abstract
principles and &quot;a boot strap,&quot; propose a scope. Ms. Burke-Bebee read
the law stating HIPAA directed NCVHS to study the issues and report no later
than July 6, 2000. Members discussed the need for a consultant to compile and
analyze feedback from terminology developers and provide an appropriate
business analysis. They considered possibly having two people: one with
expertise in medical terminologies who could render an objective, equitable
analysis and another (who didn't need the expertise) to write the
recommendations. Mr. Blair asked for names of people who met their criteria. 
</P>
<P><B>Day Two</B></P>
<P>Observing that people worked on standards development and other healthcare
initiatives from a broad range of perspectives and might not be familiar with
other initiatives, Mr. Blair and Dr. Steindel provided a quick glimpse at
organizations that had promoted, developed and coordinated healthcare
information standards. Everyone encountered different terms (electronic health
records, electronic patient records, computer-based patient records) and some
definitions were based on usage and experience, rather than easily referenced
academic specific definitions. HIPAA used patient medical record information.
Some private sector major SDOs were noted, along with initiatives involved in
facilitating, promoting or coordinating standards in the private sector, as
well as participating government agencies. Mr. Blair presented a time line and
posed questions, including whether new standards or healthcare initiatives
addressed: (1) new problems and approaches, (2) known problems with a new
perspective, (3) problems with new methods or technologies, (4) known problems
with greater industry support or energy. Other major questions were how these
standards initiatives related to others and how they fit into the NHII that the
Committee and many other organizations had proposed and worked on in similar
initiatives.</P>
<P><B>Panel 4: Coordination of Ongoing National Healthcare Standards
Initiatives</B></P>
<UL>
<LI><B>William E. Hammond, Ph.D,<I> Professor, Duke University, Connecting for
Health</I></B> </LI>
</UL>
<P>Dr. Hammond said the vision of the public-private collaborative, Connecting
for Health, was that providers, those responsible for population health,
researchers, reimbursers, auditors and, most importantly, consumers, would have
ready access to timely, relevant, reliable and secure healthcare information
through an interconnected, electronic health information infrastructure to
drive healthcare at reduced cost. Connecting for Health consisted of practicing
clinicians, hospitals and health systems, employers and third-party payers,
federal government agencies, healthcare IT suppliers, academic and research
institutions, national standards groups, manufacturers, consumer and patient
groups. </P>
<P>Dr. Hammond said the purpose of Connecting for Health was to catalyze
specific actions that rapidly clear the way for an interconnected, electronic
health information infrastructure. He identified three basic components: (1)
accelerating the rate of adoption of clinical data standards, (2) sharing best
practices for secure and private transmission of medical information, and (3)
actively working to understand what health care consumers will need and expect
from an interconnected, electronic health information infrastructure. </P>
<P>Connecting for Health was organized into three working groups: a Data
Standards Working Group chaired by Dr. Hammond, a Privacy and Security Working
Group, and a Personal Health Working Group. The latter two were still being
defined. A steering group will help players from each group access others and
ensure they were on track and that the pieces fit. The Data Standards Working
Group was organized into: a Consensus Committee that dealt with the standards
per se; an Implementation Committee, chaired by Dr. Overhage, that looked at
getting these standards into the world and in use (recognizing the prominence
of legacy systems, that pathways had to be developed, and that creating
standards was a continuous process and a national pathway had to be built in);
and the Policy Committee that interacted with the consumers of the
data--government organizations, third-party payers and others that would use
this information. </P>
<P>Dr. Hammond explained that the Data Standards Working Group developed and
applied criteria, identifying &quot;operable&quot; standards sets. Some
standards already had reached a level of maturity and were usable. In other
cases work was underway. Other groups had to consider who'd develop those
standards. An adoption process looked at the levers for adoption. How and who
would pay for implementation and recognition of required maintenance were other
considerations. Dr. Hammond said all these efforts were surrounded by barriers
that Connecting for Health sought to identify and muster mobilization to
overcome. </P>
<P>Connecting for Health held its first meeting July 31-August 1, 2002.
Criteria were developed and applied to a standards set, identifying standards
that had reached the level of maturity usable in today's systems. Overlapping
data needs of key &quot;data consumers&quot; (e.g., practicing clinicians and
providers, patients, payers, regulators, and public health--priority data
classes&quot;) were identified. Dr. Hammond said the most exciting thing about
Connecting for Health was that people were talking to each other from what had
been independent, vertical silos of activity, engaging together as they defined
the process of producing, collecting and using that data for healthcare in a
way that was usable for multiple purposes. Recognizing that this was a huge,
difficult task requiring priorities, they crosswalked these priority data needs
to the operable standards so they could move immediately. Work was also
initiated on strategies to move standards into play to deliver required data to
all stakeholders.</P>
<P>Dr. Hammond outlined next steps for the Data Standards Working Group: (1)
vet results of the kick-off meeting with other Connecting for Health working
groups, the steering group, and other key stakeholders, (2) identify next steps
to move the process, (3) accelerate adoption of required data standards whose
development was underway, (4) articulate the need for required standards not
yet underway, (5) articulate recommendations related to terminology, (6)
develop actionable, practical strategies to clear barriers and accelerate
adoption of a priority &quot;operable set&quot; of standards, and (7)
articulate the road to interoperability. Dr. Hammond noted this involved
identifying whose responsibility it was to do the next step, recognizing
several groups of players: the standards producers, vendor community, and
healthcare producers as well as healthcare consumers. The goal was to
articulate the road to interoperability.</P>
<P>Connecting for Health's interactions with PMRI include: (1) providing a
forum where data users, systems developers, and clinical care providers become
informed, engage in a dialogue about the art of the possible, doable and
desirable, and develop a consensus on standards and strategies to move adoption
to a broad range of stakeholders and (2) facilitating broad scale adoption and
rapid implementation of six data standards: terminology, business rules,
clinical templates, clinical documents (beyond the header level where there was
more detail specification, dealing marginally with templates contained in the
body of the document), guidelines /decision support, and interconnected health
information infrastructure/EHR. Noting that throughout his career he'd believed
that, if they had a terminology everybody used, they could do wondrous things,
Dr. Hammond said they were approaching a point where the necessity for a single
terminology might drive a solution to many problems. Observing that, even with
standards, people did what they wanted, he noted the need for business rules
that defined, clearly, the data collected, how it was collected, and how this
was put into the standard. Remarking that text streams were beautiful for
flexibility, but terrible because one could do whatever one wanted, he said
Connecting for Health aimed to address those gaps by identifying the criteria. 
</P>
<P>Dr. Hammond said clinical documents were at three levels: the first level
being simply the document. Level 2 held more detail specification dealing
marginally with templates contained in the body of the document. Level 3 was a
fully structured document in which each component was retrievable. Dr. Hammond
mentioned three standards he considered mature enough to use: RIM, the data
interchange model, and level 1 of clinical documents. He pointed out that none
of these standards were isolated; all were interlocked (e.g., terminology
standards had to be carefully linked to a data model). In discussing standards
requiring accelerated attention, he emphasized how standards fit together and
that it was understanding how they merged that made it possible to produce a
standard more powerful than any viewed independently.</P>
<P>Dr. Hammond said plans for addressing gaps included: (1) establishing
criteria for assessing options in each gap area, (2) developing recommendations
where options exist, (3) recommending and encouraging the undertaking of
strategies for developing standards where none exist, and (4) identifying
resources to accelerate the development of standards. Noting that most the
standards they were considering came out of volunteer efforts and
&quot;catch-when-catch-can&quot; time, Dr. Hammond said they needed to resolve
that if they were going to move ahead. </P>
<P>Dr. Hammond said the relationship to other standards initiatives was also an
issue. Standards groups and experts were represented across all of Connecting
for Health's groups and existing standards were the basis for their
recommendations. They actively collaborated through overlapping involvement and
communication with other initiatives. Many people had discovered a problem
needed to be dealt with and most were moving in the same direction. Dr. Hammond
suggested that the Committee had a responsibility to help those groups work
together and not be redundant in their activities. He said Connecting for
Health's and the Committee's major contribution was their willingness to make
decisions and endorse what they believed were the solutions to these problems.

<P><B>Panel 4: Coordination of Ongoing National Healthcare Standards
Initiatives</B></P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Rob Kolodner, M.D. <I>Chief Information Officer, Department of Veterans
Affairs</I></B> </LI>
</UL>
<P>Dr. Kolodner provided information about CHI, a government-wide initiative
focused on health information interoperability standards in the federal
healthcare arena and originated in GCPR, to which the Subcommittee served as an
advisor. CHI's vision was for federal government healthcare agencies to achieve
the health information interoperability needed through IT truly leveraged with
information sharing policies, standards and practices established as the basis
for electronic data transfer and all activities and projects among federal
agencies and departments. Some 20 partnering agencies including agencies within
HHS as well as DVA, DoD, the Department of State and Social Security
participated. About 100 medical, technical, policy and management experts were
involved.</P>
<P>Dr. Kolodner noted CHI had four work elements: (1) adopt health information
interoperability standards (a vocabulary that included specific health data
models and communication standards), (2) assure alignment with HIPAA
administrative transaction records and data sets, (3) assure alignment with
HIPAA security and privacy solutions (while these solutions weren't in its
scope, CHI would pick up and use them, and (4) foster change in the medical
sharing culture so information could be moved appropriately and handled in more
aggregate form and ways that protected privacy. </P>
<P>GCPR focused on moving information between three agencies: DVA, DoD and IHS
and work elements that were the focus of CHI. CHI's goal was to establish
federal health information interoperability standards as the basis for
electronic health data transfer in every activity and project inside all
health-related federal agencies. Beyond these federal agencies, the effort was
voluntary. CHI looked to work with the SDOs and industry to identify mature
standards and get sign-off, hopefully soon, by all the agencies. He noted that
Dr. Hammond remarked that some standards were almost ready while others needed
help getting started. Dr. Kolodner said CHI was particularly interested in
starting with those that related to information already available that could be
used immediately and following up as health information systems in the provider
arena for DVA, DoD, HHS and others matured and could use them. CHI was also
interested in information reported to FDA, Social Security or CMS.</P>
<P>Dr. Kolodner said standards identified for future acquisitions in government
would be required for future acquisitions for all agencies. He said the hope
was that the federal government's adoption would create a tipping point and the
private sector, judging those standards would be around a while and likely to
be even more widely accepted, would voluntarily adopt them, He said at some
point CHI would ask the Subcommittee to consider whether this also became a
practice of HIPAA. He emphasized that what they really wanted to do outside the
federal government was to look to a positive, attractive model, rather than
anything mandatory. </P>
<P>Noting that the Committee already indicated it would be advisory to CHI, Dr.
Kolodner mentioned other ways members could assist the initiative: (1)
providing periodic guidance and feedback regarding CHI's directions and plans,
(2) helping CHI focus on areas needing new standards, (3) helping
&quot;market&quot; the need for adopted standards to the public and private
sector, and (4) partnering with and/or supporting CHI and participating
agencies. </P>
<P>Dr. Kolodner discussed a complementary activity to CHI: HealthePeople,
noting that this strategy that DVA had proposed was about health and
individuals, not just medical and agencies. He said the initiative received a
boost in October of 2001 in a meeting sponsored by the Institute of Medicine
and Kaiser Permanente that identified the need for a robust set of
communication standards and a model health information system that was
demonstratably doable in order to realize IOM's goal of being paperless by
2010. Dr. Kolodner emphasized that the strategy was federal and national and
aimed at achieving a variety of high-performance health information standards
(including architectural, security and technical) that supported and had an
impact on the health systems used by providers across all places of care,
including at least one with public ownership for entities serving the poor.
Collaboratively developed by both public and private sectors, it was a broad
spectrum involving consumers and providers, payers and regulators and met all
those entities' and sectors' needs. </P>
<P>While HealthePeople federal, which encompassed federal agencies that were
healthcare providers, and the broader, next-generation, public-private Healthy
People concept weren't the same systems, Dr. Kolodner noted their designs,
architecture and capabilities were remarkably similar. By converging over time,
the same standards could be incorporated and used for interoperability. Within
and, in some cases, beyond the federal sector, activities would merge, leading
to convergence toward national standards in high-performance information
systems. In HealthePeople federal, DVA and DoD committed to activities that,
ultimately, will result in their repositories of data for beneficiaries being
based on the same standards and data models and the ability to exchange
information as appropriate. In addition to complementarity at the data or
software level, they aimed to identify all areas where converging efforts and
developing common software was possible, reasonable and met their needs.</P>
<P><B>Panel 4: Coordination of Ongoing National Healthcare Standards
Initiatives</B></P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Denise Love, <I>Executive Director, National Association of Health Data
Organizations </I></B> </LI>
</UL>
<P>Ms. Love noted that health data systems were the physical foundation of NHII
and that, in many cases, data wasn't a line item of high priority in state
budgets. Rather than work to expand and improve state healthcare data, often
NAHDO had to work to assure the survival of state health care data collection.
Over 40 in-patient hospital discharge data systems were maintained by state
health data agencies. Thirty-nine states had legislative mandates; about a
dozen state systems collected voluntarily. A state health data agency or
private sector organization might implement a discharge data system and
statewide data collection. The patient's healthcare encounter triggered the
event and the abstract from hospital financial systems included patient
demographic, diagnostic, procedure and reimbursement information reported to
the state agencies.</P>
<P>Many states based their reporting systems on UHDDS, finding these data a
source of low-cost, population-based health care utilization data that provide
large numbers of observations. These data were used increasingly as sources for
policy and market evaluation, quality improvement, research, and public health
purposes. Ms. Love noted limitations: (1) lack of clinical data elements from
the medical record, (2) diagnostic and procedure coding inconsistencies, and
(3) 50 state formats of a standard. But she added that, with the help of many
in the room over the last 20 years, the science was catching up and they better
understood and could overcome limitations. Discharge data support national
initiatives such as the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) led by
AHRQ. Twenty-nine states currently participate in that initiative. </P>
<P>Ms. Love explained that NAHDO was a non-profit, membership and educational
organization created in the mid-1980s to help states improve the uniformity and
comparability of that data and make it publicly available and timely for more
cost, quality and access purposes. NAHDO brought together federal, state and
private sector interests to strengthen and expand health care data reporting
interstate. NAHDO provided technical assistance to states and advocacy to
assure the survival and improvement of their healthcare systems.</P>
<P>Ms. Love emphasized that NAHDO members weren't solely focused on data, but
were all in the information business. She noted there were no federal funding
sources for healthcare utilization data and states relied on general
appropriations, which could affect how that data system was implemented. One of
NAHDO's priorities was to expand emergency department data reporting. Ms. Love
said that for marginal costs, states with in-patient data had the capacity to
increase non-in-patient data collection without imposing undue burdens on the
providers. Noting that HIPAA brought people together, Ms. Love said NAHDO was
part of e-health initiatives, Markle Foundation, and other initiatives they'd
discussed. </P>
<P>She reported that NAHDO worked actively to fill data gaps and promote
uniformity. States had to negotiate with providers and priorities of provider
communities differed: the states had 50 versions of the UB-92 format adapted to
their individual needs. NAHDO worked with states to document if a claim didn't
serve those needs, the data priorities, data elements collected that they could
live without, and how best to bring everyone into the structure of a national
standard. NAHDO identified data elements that were high priority for the states
and worked with the Public Health Data Standards Consortium, the New York State
Department of Health and other states to integrate a national standard for
public health and research reporting that resembled a claim, but more truly
reflected what states collected.</P>
<P>Noting another gap, Ms. Love said states worked hard to supplement
weaknesses of the UB-92. Some states manually abstracted from the medical
record into the discharge data abstract. NAHDO worked with the HL-7 claims
attachment to bridge EDI and X12-N with HL-7 and the medical record. Noting
that the claims attachment was mandated by HIPAA, she suggested it could
provide an opportunity near term to understand how clinical data elements could
be automated, captured and sent to a government agency. A NAHDO representative
participated in the HL-7 claims attachment work group.</P>
<P>NAHDO was actively involved with the Public Health Data Standards Consortium
in identifying priority data elements and data gaps for inclusion in the
legally defined standards process. NAHDO worked with organizations across the
public health and research community to determine how the Health Care Service:
Data Reporting Guide would identify data gaps and build the business case for
public reporting of emerging data fields and elements.</P>
<P>Ms. Love emphasized that the critical data gap at the state level was
outpatient data. Most healthcare was delivered in non-patient settings, but
physician data systems weren't capable of reporting all the data needed. Ms.
Love said NAHDO continued to help states expand their data-reporting continuum
to include ambulatory surgery and ED data. </P>
<P>Ms. Love cautioned that taking data that 20 years ago was considered
proprietary and turning it into a public good wasn't an easy process. She
discussed lessons NAHDO had learned with administrative data that applied to
mining and extracting data from the medical record, noting that the magnitude
they faced would be greater. </P>
<P>Privacy and confidentiality were a major issue in the states. State laws
varied and NAHDO members creatively addressed those concerns at their state
level. </P>
<P>There was no perfect data, but, with concerted effort, data improved over
time. Members worked closely with others to gain a sense of &quot;how good was
good enough to move forward.&quot; </P>
<UL>
<LI>Data collection priorities weren't without cost. Providers were very
concerned about the burdens imposed on them for public reporting, the business
case for those priorities needed to be made, and everyone needed to work
together. </LI>
<LI>One key for building trust was defining how the data would be collected and
used with the data suppliers </LI>
<LI>Analytic infrastructure was critical; a wealth of data wasn't enough:
people had to understand data, know how to put it together and communicate it. 
</LI>
<LI>Who pays (e.g., state government, providers) was a huge concern for all
data agencies in the days of workforce cuts and other public agency woes. </LI>
</UL>
<P>Comparability across provider systems and states had to be addressed. </P>
<P>Noting she was impressed, as always, with Dr. Hammond and the work many in
the room had done, Ms. Love expressed confidence that the technical solutions
were there and that this was an opportunity to bring everything together. She
emphasized that it all boiled down to leadership, building trust, and money.
Leadership was needed to prioritize data development activities to achieve
early success in PMRI implementation and encourage standardized terminology and
data structure priorities in order to develop a key set of clinical data
elements easily abstracted from any electronic medical record system. Ms. Love
encouraged the Committee to continue defining minimum core data needs for
external reporting. She offered her cadre of state health data agency experts
to help NCVHS work groups and subcommittees assure that public health had a
voice in the national standards process and that state data agencies, which
face unique and technical-political-social challenges, were brought into the
conversation. She advised it was critical that the Committee frame a message at
the state level about the societal good of clinical information to the public.
She recommended linking the Public Health Data Standards Consortium's
recommendations with the Committee. Ms. Love validated the work of a group of
unfunded volunteers that built national business cases for X12-N priority data
development. Reiterating that NAHDO was committed to helping states expand
their current data collection efforts, she pleaded to make administrative
outpatient data development and standardization a priority across HHS. </P>
<P><B>Panel 4: Coordination of Ongoing National Healthcare Standards
Initiatives</B></P>
<UL>
<LI><B><I>Bert Reese, Vice President/Chief Information Officer, Sentara
Healthcare, National Alliance for Health Information Technology</I></B></LI>
</UL>
<P>Mr. Reese noted NAHIT was still in its infancy. Its bylaws were still in
draft form; the Board hadn't been appointed, and no subcommittees were formed.
The founders (all members of AHA) were providers, payers, IT technical services
companies, and vendors who believed it was time for the field to engage in the
standards discussion. Mr. Reese said he'd been a CIO for 30 years, 21 of them
with Sentara Healthcare, a $1.6- billion-per-year company that included 6
hospitals, 12 nursing homes, and 175 employed physicians. Also a payer and a
durable medical equipment company, Sentara had 14,000 employees, home health
and air ambulance services. Mr. Reese said he came from the field and this was
his first exposure to any discussions about standards and it was enlightening.
He said he was starting to understand the difficulty and complexity of
healthcare transactions, adding that he thought the reluctance of healthcare
leadership in the field to fix the standards' problem was changing. Healthcare
challenges drove the provider/payer leadership to go after the standards
issues. CEOs and COOs of provider organizations realized patient safety
couldn't be solved without the integration of complex computer systems and that
employee recruiting and retention (a lack of clinical job skills had led to an
epidemic) required computerization and workflow management in order to improve
the daily work life of clinicians, physicians, nurses and other key personnel.
Mr. Reese said another factor was capacity management: there weren't enough
physical plants on-line to treat all the boomers. More efficiency and precision
were needed to gain throughput with hospitals and better integration between
them, rehab facilities, long-term and home care. Mr. Reese identified issues
that drove healthcare leadership in the field to pay attention to standards
issues and provide AHA with support to spawn the national alliance. </P>
<P>Mr. Reese described Sentara's experience that led it to become a founding
member of NAHIT. Sentara had six hospitals, but only one set of non-negotiable
screens at the hospital information system level done collaboratively by the
medical staff. Nurses floated between organizations where the processes
represented by the computer system were exactly the same, enabling Sentara to
better utilize labor distribution. Sentara also standardized the charge of
Description Master, providing standardized nomenclature within the health
system. The data could be pulled from the actual clinical transactions that
deduce disease management. Once physicians agreed on an appropriate protocol of
care and development guidelines, it was entered in the computer system and
ordering pathway and was immediately available to all hospitals and caregivers.
</P>
<P>Mr. Reese noted that Sentara presented a challenge in that, although it
considered HL-7 and HIPAA good starting points, it didn't see them as
standards, but as guidelines. He reported there was too much flexibility in
interpretation within those standards, but acknowledged it was a great step and
that the Committee was moving forward. Mr. Reese observed that all the work
being done by the various committees and everything listed that day wasn't on
the CIOs's radar screens. CIOs discussed doing business between computer
systems, but never discussed the standards because they didn't know them. He
suggested the Subcommittee &quot;follow the money.&quot; Once a standard was
developed, it was the CIO who purchased the multi-million dollar system and
told the provider which standard to deliver. Once CIOs understood what to buy,
they'd enforce that standard at the local level. And the marketplace would
respond to the market. </P>
<P>Mr. Reese said about 400-computer systems drove Sentara's health system. He
said having the standards (and CIOs who understood them) would result in a
major cost reduction and increase efficiency at the operational level. That was
why Sentara and NAHIT's other founders were impassioned about participating and
learning to partner with the community.</P>
<P>Noting NAHIT was interested in standards related to bar coding, patient
identification, communication and application systems, Mr. Reese suggested that
bar coding the name tag of the person administering drugs, the patient's ID,
and the med could enable someone who wasn't an R.N. to administer an oral solid
(e.g., Tylenol) if the computer system acted as a safety net--freeing the nurse
to do what she was licensed to do and easing the recruiting/retention issue. 
</P>
<P>Mr. Reese noted the primary business of a whole set of companies was to step
in the void where there were no standards (e.g., offering Enterprise-wide
Master Patient Index) providing patient identification. Similarly, Sentara was
spending $600,000 on interoperability issues to use an interface engine from a
third party whose primary piece of technology served as a broker between
computer systems. Mr. Reese noted that standards could eradicate these issues. 
</P>
<P>NAHIT's mission was to mobilize the field and assist in the implementation
of standards. Mr. Reese said NAHIT's direction was straightforward: convene the
payers, providers, IT manufacturers and supply chain and then take out small
projects that could be successful and see if they could get the field to
recognize it had a role and responsibility in the adoption of standards.</P>
<P>He said NAHIT didn't consider themselves legislative, but an augmentation to
other processes, &quot;although they probably didn't understand all of
them.&quot; He said NAHIT was committed to a consensus approach and that
strength lay in bringing the field together in a particular environment where
they could educate folks like him about the standards and what had to be done.
He reiterated that healthcare leadership had to resolve issues of patient
safety, retention and recruiting and capacity of management as they moved
forward. NAHIT would work with the Committee and everyone designated.</P>
<P><B>Panel 4: Coordination of Ongoing National Healthcare Standards
Initiatives</B></P>
<UL>
<LI><B>J. Marc Overhage, MD, PhD,<I> eHealth Initiative Foundation's
Public-Private Sector Collaboration for Public Health; Investigator,
Regenstrief Institute; Associate Professor of Medicine, Indiana University
School of Medicine</I></B></LI>
</UL>
<P>Dr. Overhage discussed the eHI initiative and its foundation for eHI's
efforts to bring together public and private sector stakeholders, promote and
coordinate the national adoption of health data standards and system
interoperability, and meet clinical and public health needs. EHI's membership
represented healthcare providers, delivery systems, healthcare information
technology (IT) suppliers, payers, non-profit organizations and professional
societies, pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers, physician
organizations, research and academic institutions. Its primary mission was to
drive improvement in the quality, safety and cost- effectiveness of healthcare
through IT. Its strategic priorities were to: increase awareness of the role of
IT in driving greater quality, safety and cost effectiveness, lay the
foundation for an &quot;interconnected, electronic, health information
infrastructure&quot; by promoting the adoption of clinical data standards and
enhanced connectivity, and build the case for public and private sector
economic incentives for better quality healthcare enabled by IT. </P>
<P>As an example of initiatives eHI undertook to accomplish its aims, Dr.
Overhage described the Public Private Collaboration for Public Health. The
collaboration's purpose was to: develop and communicate strategies to
efficiently and securely capture and transmit standardized electronic data of
public health importance, facilitate that transmission by building upon and
integrating recommendations within CDC's National Electronic Disease
Surveillance System (NEDSS), leverage existing provider healthcare information
systems and data sources to enhance public health surveillance processes and
achieve results applicable in six to 12 months. </P>
<P>Dr. Overhage said eHI was undertaking projects that yielded results that
were usable, visible and instructive in short periods of time, then
repositioning and taking the next step. In doing this, they hoped to lay the
foundation for further development of NHII. </P>
<P>Dr. Overhage identified critical success factors: the public and private
sectors worked closely together, leveraging complementary expertise and
competencies; a focus on supporting specific, well-defined, highly visible
needs for data in public health; a focus on data that, for the most part, was
already in electronic formats and more likely to be converted and transmitted
quickly; aligning efforts and data needs with existing funding sources; and
leveraging the work of experts and &quot;those in the trenches&quot; already
performing this work and building upon lessons learned and best practices;
involving key stakeholders including those that produce and use data and data
enablers in the middle transferring the data; driving usage of standards and
strategies through implementation and demonstration projects; and aligning
efforts with national incentives (e.g., NCVHS).</P>
<P>The broad set of collaborators include federal entities, state and local
public health agencies and partner organizations, healthcare technology
suppliers, healthcare providers and provider groups, holders of large sources
of healthcare data, academic and research institutions, standards
organizations, and non-profit associations. The Public-Private Sector
Collaboration included members and non-members of eHI, but volunteers within
seven working groups focused on architecture, chief complaint data, orders,
security, lab and microbiology results performed considerable work. The Joseph
H. Cantor Foundation, CDC and the eHI initiative provided financial support. 
</P>
<P>Dr. Overhage reported that, since its inception in November of 2001, eHI:
(1) proposed additions to CDC's <I>Implementation Guide for Transmission of
Laboratory Based Reporting Information</I>, including standard formats and
specification of data types that hadn't been addressed; (2) looked at
alternative methods and responsibility models for integration brokering
functions; (3) considered a conceptual framework for specifying components of
microbiology results reporting; (4) summarized the scope, methods and findings
of sites currently performing syndromic surveillance; and (5) identified focus
areas for demonstration projects. Dr. Overhage observed that the
industry/private sector collaboration was incredibly valuable: organizations
freely shared data and results, enabling a highly leveraged activity. </P>
<P>Dr. Overhage said that over the next 30-60 days eHI would release
implementation guides for lab results, microbiology results, orders and chief
complaint data. Other next steps include promoting widespread adoption of the
standards and strategies through communications, education, outreach targeted
to providers, labs and public health agencies. Noting the huge investment, last
year, by state and local health departments to address these problems, Dr.
Overhage emphasized that it was critically important these weren't dispersed
into diverse projects that didn't supplement and build on each other, but were
focused into leveraging standards and health information in a consistent way
and that success stories were showcased to build and sustain momentum. </P>
<P>eHI supported use of the PMRI standards and terminology as the standards for
implementation and its use was consistent with the Committee's recommendations:
e.g., HL-7.2x as the format for orders, chief complaint data, laboratory and
microbiology results. </P>
<P>Dr. Overhage noted key areas that required additional development or
implementation: (1) existing terminologies didn't support concepts important
for public health surveillance (e.g., chief complaint data) and some available
and well-defined terminologies had limited implementation (e.g., LOINC), (2) as
Mr. Reese had noted, implementation guides were needed, (3) standardized
approaches to defining and communicating rules associated with data usage
(e.g., Dwyer Tables that list laboratory test result identifiers using LOINC
codes associated with diseases or conditions of public health interest--a
positive chlamydia DNA probe might indicate an infection with chlamydia), and
(4) while full adoption of PMRI standards and terminologies might take
significant time, current data could be leveraged near term through integration
strategies (e.g., format converters and code translators).</P>
<P>He noted the initiative had learned a number of key lessons. eHI's model of
rapid short-term intensive efforts focused on specific problems in public
health had demonstrated that it could produce significant results in a modest
time scale and that the healthcare industry was ready to move to early
implementation steps. Noting they'd already heard that day about Connecting for
Health and other activities underway, Dr. Overhage said eHI also demonstrated
the value of bringing together multiple stakeholders in a public-private
collaboration committed to working with other organizations through overlapping
involvement that leveraged complementary skills, knowledge and expertise. Dr.
Overhage emphasized ongoing, open communication and concrete alignment of
activities. He said the Committee could assist the initiative by: (1)
continuing to create a clear, consistent message that there was a set of
&quot;operable&quot; standards and terminologies that could and should be
adopted near term, (2) encouraging and supporting demonstration projects (eHI
considered this particularly important in order to identify critical issues
that might not otherwise be anticipated, demonstrate that the venture could
work and value could be achieved, apply lessons learned to shaping future
recommendations), and (3) developing a model for migration to a PMRI
standards-based environment. Dr. Overhage emphasized that, as they worked with
healthcare providers and information system vendors, it was particularly
important that migration strategy emerged as a critical factor in how everyone
thought about things. </P>
<P><B>Agenda Item: Comments about standards Implementation in the United
Kingdom</B></P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Colin Price, M.D., <I>National Health Service Information Authority,
U.K.</I></B></LI>
</UL>
<P>Dr. Price explained that over the last 10 years the U.K.'s NHS had at least
two major strategies and two revisions of the latest strategy for implementing
an IT for healthcare for England. The first major IT strategy for NHS dated
from 1992 and ran about six years. It was based, as all NHS strategies have
been, on (1) the patient as the center of operational clinical systems and (2)
a focus on using IT to support clinical care rather than epidemiology, while
recognizing that information captured to support care should be secondarily
derived into trying to optimize cost effectiveness in an environment that then
perceived health IT as a fairly expensive luxury and (3) managing expectations
about the outputs and benefits of IT. A new national strategy published in
1998, <I>Information for Health</I> (IFH), was introduced as an information
strategy for the modern NHS to be implemented locally. Many of the standards
would be developed nationally, but responsibility for implementation,
performance managing, and achieving targets would be met at the local level
where family practice primary care was delivered. A seven-year strategy
designed to run through 2005, it was updated at the beginning of last year with
an augmented document, <I>Building the Information Core for Implementing the
NHS Plan</I>. Concern early in 2002 that many targets within the original
strategy weren't adequately met led to rethinking implementation and another
document, <I>Delivering 21<SUP>st</SUP> Century IT in the NHS</I>. All
documents are available on NHS's website. </P>
<P>Dr. Price said IFH strategy (originally envisaged as a longitudinal
electronic health record cradle-to-grave, with episodic electronic patient
records for particular episodes of care in acute hospitals) still formed the
basis of most of NHS's intentions and aimed for life-long electronic health
records for the entire population. Collections would have round-the-clock
on-line access to records and information about best practices to enable
decision making and improve clinical care. Seamless care was to be ensured as
patients moved through general practitioners, hospitals, and community services
including chiropractic, podiatry, physical therapy, etc. NHS also sought to
provide health planners and managers with the information they needed and fast,
convenient public access to information, including accessing information
resources for particular conditions, performance of individual hospitals,
provider units and practitioners and one's own records. Dr. Price said he
didn't believe there was any difference between these principles and those
emerging from deliberations around U.S. intentions for health IT. </P>
<P>Sir John Patterson, Head of Research, Analysis and Information, U.K.
Department of Health, reported directly to the Junior Minister and oversaw a
number of bodies including two particularly concerned with information
management: Information Authority (IA), a quasi-independent special health
authority established by an act of Parliament had about 850 employees and an
annual budget of some $160 million, excluding local implementation costs of the
health IT strategy. The Information Policy Unit (IPU) commissioned items of
work from IA. Both determined a budget and project plan leading to development
of a robust business case. Dr. Price noted both bodies were part of a broader
framework for modernizing NHService, the NHS Plan, which included e-government
and a probability framework. He noted that John Patterson had expressed
interest in the DVA system as an example of what a national electronic record
might look like. </P>
<P>Dr. Price explained that NHS was a diverse organization and that, following
the original game plan, some 300-400 local organizations produced
implementation strategies to suit their priorities. Given the variety of legacy
infrastructures and systems, this local strategy approach was meant to ensure
that NHS wasn't too prescriptive centrally, so people could capitalize on what
was appropriate and already in place. People developed plans to show how IFH
targets would be met and integrate different components of the health delivery
environment, acute hospital sector, and community. Dr. Price said that over the
last few years, clinical governance, an umbrella term for performance
management within the clinical environment, was seen as crucial to many of
these initiatives. He noted NHS always sought assurance that local steps were
taken to enhance the quality of locally held data from which centrally required
information was derived.</P>
<P>In April, 300 new primary care trusts pulled together the 9,000 general
practices in England and their 30,000 care physicians. Twenty-eight new
strategic health authorities replaced eight previous regional health
authorities. Family doctors received new contractual arrangements. Dr. Price
said uncertainty and turf warring created an interesting and difficult
environment in which to implement a national IT strategy. A general election in
three-four years and the government's heavy commitment to NHS IT and many
targets around clinical messaging, electronic records and booking in 2005 led
NHS to review its implementation approach and consider providing local
communities with, at the least, stronger guidance to ensure that local strategy
development conformed to the central template.</P>
<P>Dr. Price said there was also a need for NHS to shift to a more centralist,
aggressive approach to standardization. He noted the U.S. health IT environment
seemed to engage better with industry and suppliers. NHS chose an approach
where a small number of prime service providers subcontract with other
suppliers to deliver, in various domains, the components of the strategy and
wanted to specify the standards that prime service suppliers imposed on
subcontractors. <I>Delivering 21<SUP>st</SUP> Century IT</I> set out the
standards for the life-long health record service, which was the high-level
macro architecture for the national strategic program. A Director General would
oversee procurement, the application portfolio, some of the changed management
and new working practices. Dr. Price also noted the need to integrate with
e-government and the IT industry, deliver compliant open systems and political
applications, phase the approach and--a first priority and the basis of
<I>Delivering 21<SUP>st</SUP> Century IT</I>--specify the standards for an
electronic patient record system.</P>
<P>Three key targets for 2005 were electronic prescribing, a patient's ability
to electronically book an appointment with a specialist in his primary care
physician's hospital, and the new personification of the life-long electronic
health record--Integrated Core Record Service. Essential foundation services
underneath this included consent, confidentiality and authentication. Dr. Price
identified consent, security and confidentiality as the biggest barriers to
making progress in electronic record demonstration evaluation work (e.g.,
identifying, centrally, who was the owner of a particular problem). Technical
things needed to be put in place (e.g., re-procuring extra bandwidth in NHS's
intranet). And data and data interchange standards based on open technology
were needed.</P>
<P>Noting that IFH acknowledged that in the mid-1990s there wasn't a
disciplined approach for agreeing on national clinical data standards for NHS,
Dr. Price said their solution had been to create committees. The main decision
making body was the Information Standards Board (ISB). Three subsidiary Boards
oversaw clinical, technical, and management information standards. Industry,
through a computer suppliers association, was represented on all four Boards. A
fourth component dealt with knowledge management and making details of the
standards available. Dr. Price said NCVHS most paralleled the main ISB. </P>
<P>Dr. Price said that in approving any standard the Board wanted to see a user
requirements document detailing its particular purpose. The Board also needed a
specification. Standards approval was an independent process undertaken outside
development; ISB wasn't part of either the IPU or IA. There had to be at least
one successful implementation before a standard could be considered as a draft;
the Board wanted to see at least three other implementations before approving a
full standard. Dr. Price emphasized that becoming a standard was an ongoing
process of conformance testing and monitoring. As Dr. Hammond had said,
standards changed and needed to be updated. </P>
<P>He commented on the range of international standards available to choose
from when adopting an NHS standard (e.g., the European committee, CEN , ISO,
and HL-7). He said HL-7 was generally seen as the strategic direction for
standard setting within NHS. Noting there were other involvements (IEEE,
Corbamed), Dr. Price said NHS considered industry's commitment to HL-7
important and was keen to continue working with definitive ISOs. </P>
<P>Dr. Price said a major headache for NHS was integrating standards and
systems. Implementing electronic booking, messaging, and electronic records was
underway. Standards were being developed in parallel. He envisioned that, in
many cases, there'd be a point when new sets of standards converged with
emerging systems. While acknowledging the logic of putting systems development
on hold until the standards were in place, Dr. Price pointed out that there
were reasons not to do so.</P>
<P>He emphasized that standards needed to be interoperable and noted the
challenge that presented. The only way to approve a draft standard was to have
it developed and tested in a live setting. Re-engineering the standards or
systems around them downstream was perceived as potentially costly and might
also invalidate any evaluation work done around the performance of the
application using the standard or the validity of the standard. </P>
<P>NHS considered CT implementation as a bridge between yesterday and today.
Dr. Price said the foundation had set business objectives for implementing the
standards for the financial year and intended to refine this product, as
necessary, making it suitable for key initiatives, particularly short-term
strategic requirements. NHS wanted to manage the supply chain around this new
standard, engaging with end users, political groups, managers who'd use
secondary information, and engaging with suppliers (including prime service
providers) NHS also wanted to integrate it with other standards, getting it
through the standards approval process and on to a full standard. Being a
public sector body and because standards change and the world moves on, Dr.
Price said they had to establish a fairly minimalist, ongoing evaluation
mechanism to check that, in using the standard, benefits continued to be
delivered. He noted business issues had to be addressed around distributing the
standard and terminology and producing and costing a formal, long-term
implementation plan. Because the primary care community used an existing de
facto standard that was the early version of the systems, migration support was
another issue embodied in NHS's business objectives. </P>
<P>Noting the range of choices in looking at the organizational focus for
implementing the standard for family doctors, Dr. Price stressed the importance
of determining who was responsible for performance managing implementation and
who'd &quot;carry the cannon.&quot; Currently, NHS considered that
responsibility rested with the 28 new strategic health authorities. Remarking
on what to do in moving from existing systems to new ones, Dr. Price speculated
that the cost of upgrading the U.S. clinical system to run with SNOMED, rather
than READ Codes would only account for 20 percent of the implementation costs.
Doing something with 15-years-worth of legacy data and 50,000,000 primary care
records would account for the other 80 percent. As part of their planning
process, NHS assessed the value of all of its primary care data and worked out
the extent it should formally be migrated and archived and the implications. 
</P>
<P>Dr. Price discussed the program that oversaw rolling out SNOMED. EARTICA had
two streams. An evaluation program looked at migration issues and had a
multi-professional quality assurance component, ADVENT, that kicked off
implementation in primary care. Two small projects dealt with allied health and
social terms. Another foundation program picked up business issues and a
business case around SNOMED to augment the development case: getting it through
formal, government gateway processes for large scale IT projects, developing a
long term implementation plan, putting in place a long-term evaluation
mechanism, and a stream to use in implementing and integrating this new
terminology, making sure it cross mapped to the 55 data sets currently under
development in the NHS, to ICD-10, and to the procedure classification, OBCS-4
so they could derive secondary data. Dr. Price said implementing a new standard
across NHS that put in place extensions for U.K.-specific drugs and
administration terms would take a year and cost about $3,000,000.</P>
<P><B>Agenda Item: Comments about Healthcare Information and Management Systems
Society</B></P>
<UL>
<LI>Dave Roberts, <I>Public Policy Director, </I>Healthcare Information and
Management Systems Society </LI>
</UL>
<P>Mr. Roberts outlined HIMSS' five ongoing national initiatives. In its fourth
year, Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise was a five-year project done in
coordination with the Radiological Society of North America to improve systems
interoperability for sharing patient data by promoting coordination of
established communication standards (e.g., HL-7 and DICOM) to address specific
integration needs.</P>
<P>HIMSS also worked closely with other associations including Coalition for
Health Information Policy (comprised of HIMSS, American Medical Informatics
Association, and American Health Information Management Association) and
Electronic Health Initiative. HIMSS was also a founding member and on the
Coordinating Committee of National Alliance of Health Information Technology. 
</P>
<P>In August, HIMSS merged with CPRI-Host with the goal of making the
electronic medical record ubiquitous in healthcare. HIMSS will also sponsor a
field hearing February 11 in Seneca, California made up of industry experts and
congressional staff on whether the federal government should mandate an
electronic health record. At its June Board of Directors meeting, HIMSS
unanimously adopted NHII as the society's long-term public policy initiative.
Its NHII task force evaluated initial projects including creating an inventory
of existing technologies and practices, developing a gap analysis on what needs
to be created and a HIMSS version of NHII. Mr. Roberts said HIMSS was available
to assist in standardizing the terminology used throughout this area and
identifying or reaffirming the relative attributes of terms. </P>
<P><B>Discussion</B></P>
<P>Dr. Kolodner explained that the HealthePeople strategy built on activities
in DVA. DVA was involved with and maintained ongoing dialogues with many public
entities mentioned today and strove to implement what was ready. He suggested
they'd heard a web of connections across these efforts. He also noted they'd
heard that a group underrepresented at the table was the individual
practitioners who held most the key information about individuals. </P>
<P>Dr. Hammond said he thought the level of cooperation between groups was
higher than ever. Many people worked together in four or five different
settings. Ideally, he reflected, they'd all work together in one setting. But
each organization started off with its constituency funding for its own purpose
and met up with others similarly inclined. He proposed finding a neutral way to
satisfy each group's needs, so the work was done only once. </P>
<P>Recalling they'd seen a bullet highlighting the need to inform, Dr. Hammond
said most people didn't know what was happening in this world. Even those
involved weren't aware of everything, which was why it seemed necessary to
participate in each activity. He noted that side communications at this meeting
already promoted a level of working together beyond today. The intent was
there; only the process was needed. Pointing out that the U.K. solved this
problem by having an &quot;information authority,&quot; Dr. Hammond suggested a
similar authority might help put everything together. </P>
<P>Dr. Overhage agreed that Dr. Kolodner's description of a web of
communication was how things worked today. He noted that the e-health
initiative work group had struggled with what to use for a drug vocabulary;
once a high need was identified, a viable solution appeared. He said e-health
avoided duplicating what others did, but took advantage of leverage to enhance
communications. He depicted e-health as focusing on leveraging what was
happening in industry that added value to what was done. Industry groups
working with e-health routinely said they'd like to help, but didn't know what
to do. E-health tried to leverage assets by building collaborations and actions
that otherwise might not be possible.</P>
<P>Dr. McDonald remarked that e-health had a strong public health volunteerism
slant; there was a lot of crossover for people in the governmental agencies and
things Dr. Kolodner described and HL-7 served as a mixer. Noting he approved of
how HIMSS described their role, Dr. McDonald said he'd always tried to merge
organizations. One could only go to so many meetings, and many weren't
necessary. He expressed uncertainty about the alliance, which seemed focused on
bar codes and appeared to not overlap or offer crossover. </P>
<P>Dr. Cohn said he, too, tried to put order into this. Dr. Overhage had talked
about basic elements for moving forward. Dr. Hammond had identified things to
accelerate and implement. CHI offered a set of issues about making things real.
Dr. Cohn said he was struck by Mr. Reese's comments as a CIO and reminded that,
in some ways, they were successful. Using an analogy about electrical plugs and
sockets, Dr. Cohn said he wasn't sure it was Mr. Reese's responsibility to know
that he needed version 2.X of HL-7 and specific implementation and mechanisms.
But he believed Mr. Reese did need assurance that, when he bought something, it
did all he needed and was interoperable. Dr. Cohn said, personally, he'd demand
that of the marketplace.</P>
<P>Mr. Reese suggested that the fault lay at the feet of innovation. Innovation
occurred in clinical areas where computerization was used to help out the
patient safety agenda and Mr. Reese pointed out that innovative phases of
development always involved a lack of standards and trial and error. The
marketplace hadn't prevailed because innovation had reined healthcare (e.g.,
the clinical diagnostic computing equipment: MRIs and CT scans) into the
administrative support systems. Mr. Reese cautioned that, standards they might
curb innovation. He said it was a matter of balance: at some point, someone had
to say, &quot;Let's make that electrical socket this way.&quot;</P>
<P>Dr. McDonald responded that he could get everything he wanted clinically in
an HL-7 message at all five major hospitals in his city. The only problem was
on the coding side. Dr. McDonald suggested that Sentara was more HL-7
standardized than Mr. Reese thought. Dr. Cohn reflected that they could have
all the data in the world and, without a plan for using it, people to help and
people willing to share the data, they'd only create a great edifice without
value for either public health or policy.</P>
<P>Ms. Love remarked that for 20 years NAHDO believed the trickle-down theory
of standards solved problems. Recalling what they'd heard about healthcare
authority in the U.K., she noted the states had about 39 healthcare authorities
or commissions that made data policy. She questioned how they'd: get everyone
on board, get their message to those helping to make data policy, and inform
the Department of Health about new data sets collected.</P>
<P>Dr. Kolodner suggested the question was how they got a messaging standard
that stabilized (e.g., the plug and socket). The problem with terminology was
that they were changing the electricity or forms transmitted. He predicted
that, as medical knowledge advanced, this would be the nature of medicine far
into the future. As the explanation of disease changed, terms wouldn't be
stable and had to be updated (e.g., from peptic ulcer as hyperacidic to an
infectious condition). But much of what was communicated didn't change as
rapidly and could be put in place. Dr. Cohn commented that, while they talked
in the HIPAA world about not changing the message standards often, code sets
changed frequently. He suggested this might be a similar distinction. </P>
<P>Dr. Fitzmaurice complimented the testifiers on doing a remarkable job
educating their constituencies and partners. Noting he'd seen a lot of
interlocking directorates, he asked if the organizations planned to:
participate in SDOs and work groups to get the standards their constituents
could use, join in the standards coordinating efforts, fund jointly among
constituents and agencies specific standards development and implementation
activities, and demand standards of interoperability in purchases that nudged
the market where they wanted it to be.</P>
<P>Ms. Adair clarified that members of the CHI council and staff would continue
to participate in SDOs, which was an effective way of making their needs known
at the threshold. Coordination between groups was one reason CMS came to
today's hearing; they hoped to come away with a sense of how, as
representatives of the federal healthcare sector, to hold forums with other
groups. Ms. Adair clarified that CHI believed its function was to adopt the
standards for this federal healthcare sector. Dr. Kolodner suggested that this
was where the allusion to a related federal activity came in. If there was
federal adoption of a standard (e.g., LOINC) then DVA, DoD, and any other
health service in the provider organizations could work together at that
systems application level, HealthePeople federal, to collaborate and leverage
the investment each made to move it forward. Ms. Adair observed that, in
talking about sharing applications, one had to consider that an application was
the personification of one's business rules and see where those rules aligned.
She noted standards, vocabulary and messaging weren't necessarily business
rules, but how one moved. </P>
<P>Dr. Fitzmaurice said CHI had given good answers to questions others would
ask as they measured each organization's successes. Remarking that there'd
never been a time when there was so much common vision, he said they had a good
base of education to move on. Ms. Adair said CHI's intent was to look at what
NCVHS brought forward and not recreate any wheels, but build off what was out
there.</P>
<P>Mr. Reese said NAHIT's view was more finite. He described NAHIT as the
&quot;traction&quot; point in the process representing the market. Noting it
had the necessary environments and, more importantly, the providers, payers,
technology companies and supply chain &quot;all in the room,&quot; Mr. Reese
said NAHIT sought to participate in standard development and testing. Dr.
Fitzmaurice concurred that producers, purchasers and vendors would drive the
standards. SDOs wanted demand for what they produced. Speaking personally, Mr.
Reese observed that sometimes &quot;adult supervision&quot; was also required.
He predicted that as purchasers recognized various organizations had developed
standards that were generally acceptable, they'd push providers to meet them. 
</P>
<P>Dr. Hammond said Connecting for Health's intent was to cover that spectrum
and identify, influence and endorse in specific terms what they meant to
accomplish, recognizing that, when a link was missing, one always couldn't do
what one wanted. The other part of the problem, Dr. Hammond said, was that most
people misunderstood how to create a standard. There were multiple ways.
Microsoft provided as many standards as one wanted quickly, they'd seen what
one got with that process. The government could create standards fast. In the
open, consensus world of the consumer, a different process involved users of
systems, providers of care, and vendors vested in what they had, but willing to
change when connected with the user community's demands. Dr. Hammond emphasized
that had to be staged; there had to be motivation. When something worked,
people didn't change it just because there was a new technology. Dr. Hammond
said interface engines permitted living in a bracket, instead of a line, of
time. He said this was a piece of what Connecting for Health did.</P>
<P>Dr. Hammond said he firmly believed that standards used by the public
(either by requirement or encouragement) had to be free, available and used for
the marketplace. But he cautioned that nobody fully understood how much it cost
to create standards. Repeatedly, people discovered a need and, if the current
standard didn't support it, moved to create a new one, rather than fix the old.
Dr. Hammond said they had to change that mind set.</P>
<P>He noted that people also misinterpreted what the standard meant. Dr.
Hammond remarked that Dr. McDonald and he had used HL-7 for a number of years
to transmit entire patient records, in both in- and out-patient care settings.
Dr. Hammond acknowledged that he controlled both sides and knew how to
interpret them, which was critical in making this work. He noted this went
beyond the messaging and involved a conformance agreement among the players.
Creating the perfect messaging standard didn't guarantee interoperability;
other pieces had to be there. Dr. Hammond emphasized that they couldn't do only
one thing and expect it to resolve everything. A suite of standards was needed
to make all of this work. He said they were getting there.</P>
<P>Mr. Scanlon remarked that, to the extent each initiative focused on the same
standards, the same people would be involved and, hopefully, have agreement on
the basic suite. He noted a couple of items focused on technology, rather than
standards. Mr. Reese's bar coding and others were IT applications that,
presumably, reflected the hospital's priorities for technology investments. 
</P>
<P>Asked where he saw the capital coming for hospitals to make these
transitions and changes, Mr. Reese said he wasn't sure about the capital for
standard development, but the capital for a vendor to adopt a standard would
come from the purchase agreements. He said one of the responsibilities of the
alliance and of HIMSS was to ensure that they understood the standard and
conveyed it to their membership. Once there was consensus about what was good
for their communities, money would flow from purchases. Mr. Reese noted that
when he bought software or a PAC system he collaborated with 10-15 CIOs,
determining which version of what interface worked best. He spent as much time
evaluating systems interoperability as he did the actual application. HIMSS,
CHIMES, HI-C and other professional organizations coordinated within the
alliance. CHIMES and HIMSS had other agenda items; Mr. Reese expressed hope the
alliance only had one: the field's adoption of standards. </P>
<P>Mr. Blair reflected that his experience over the last five years on NCVHS
evaluating, selecting and recommending standards to become part of HIPAA was
sobering; while they'd held to their sense of urgency, it took them much longer
than they'd thought. Message format standards were done; vocabulary standards
only begun. While trying to pull together a direction for NHII, NCVHS was still
selecting HIPAA PMRI standards. Responding to how long it took to get through
the cycle with a notice of proposed rule making (NPRM) and final rules, Mr.
Blair noted the Committee had recommended that HHS indicate guidelines along
with incentives to accelerate standards. Mr. Blair said he sensed in the day's
presentations (and the fact that there was a bill in the House of
Representatives and at least one more about to be introduced in the Senate
along with efforts in the Executive Branch) an urgency to move healthcare into
the information age and reap the benefits of the paradigm shift. He asked if
this urgency translated into a desire that the federal government be more
aggressive, as England had become: not only accelerating things faster, but
taking more of a leadership role and going towards mandates rather than
guidelines--or if acceleration should be left to the private sector. </P>
<P>Dr. Hammond said his answer was different today than several years ago. The
government produced standards, but on its own. To some extent, the government
had a free ride, watching the private community develop standards and
commenting on the slowness without engaging. Suggesting they'd reached the
point of public-private collaboration and engagement, Dr. Hammond called for a
partnership, not only in funding, but also in expertise and defining needs. He
noted that creating standards was a multi-staged task. The first step was
gaining necessary technical expertise. The next steps were broadening the
community, cutting off sharp edges, polishing the process and closing gaps.
With funding, this could happen rapidly. He also emphasized the importance of
the community-at-large's buy-in and ownership, noting this included vendors,
government and regulators, providers of care and consumers. Dr. Hammond
asserted that they knew enough to accelerate this process and still retain
openness: it was one thing to hand down a standard as a mandate and quite
another when that standard was created through an open process. Observing that
healthcare was a partnership, Dr. Hammond said the private community welcomed
the public community's involvement. Once people began working together, they
forgot who they represented and where they came from. They were a group solving
a problem. </P>
<P>Dr. Overhage recalled Dr. Kolodner's use of the phrase &quot;tipping
point.&quot; He said they were on the precipice and people were poised: Mr.
Reese had said vendors would implement whatever the market requested; people
paying the bills said they were ready to request what was needed, but didn't
know what to ask for; federal agencies said they'd love to get everything in a
standardized way. The challenge was to provide confidence and a nudge. </P>
<P>Ms. Love remarked that the &quot;hammer&quot; of a mandate got people to the
table but, when the bottom line linked to savings and it clearly was in
everyone's best self-interest, people voluntarily and rapidly standardized
around a specific transaction. Mandates were a tool, so long as they had
incrementalism. Ms. Love cautioned it wasn't clear whether they were mandating
standardizing certain transactions, business case information needs, or
everything in the medical record. Mr. Blair explained that Congress directed
that certain HIPAA standards be mandated. Executing that mandate was a powerful
tool, but getting to the final rule was a lengthy process. Noting that, while
one might go faster with guidelines, one had less authority, Mr. Blair asked
for the testifiers sense of a balance. Ms. Love advised that, so long as there
was a dialogue between users and collectors, a mandate was a viable tool. Dr.
Cohn clarified that, with HIPAA, they dealt with capabilities as well as
standards: mandating that entry systems throughout the country use a standard
was different than anything they'd thought about. </P>
<P>Dr. Price observed that most the benefits came from the fact that they were
adopting a standard. Noting an instance where people pressed ahead with a
project using edifact technology they knew to be effectively obsolete, because
a change management and benefit realization program used those standards and
they imagined migrating downstream, Dr. Price cautioned about a perception that
potential benefits of standardization had been lost due to lead time. </P>
<P>Dr. Yasnoff said the need to coordinate the standards initiatives was clear
from the testimony. He asked what the government's role should be: what should
it do to facilitate coordination either in general or among these
organizations. Ms. Adair said she believed it was on a voluntary basis. CHI's
pan was to have the federal agencies stipulate standards they would build into
their target architectures so everyone knew what they were moving towards. CHI
hadn't envisioned the implication to legacy systems (cost and questionable
benefit) that Dr. Price indicated. Ms. Adair clarified that CHI's approach was
more in line with Dr. Kolodner's tipping approach. Dr. Yasnoff explained that
he was referencing Dr. Hammond's point about various initiatives all, in their
own way, attempting to coordinate. He asked if, as Dr. Hammond phrased it,
making sure all the energy was focused in one direction was a role for the
government. Ms. Adair noted that many federal participants involved in a number
of other projects sat on the CHI council. CHI hoped that, through this
&quot;cross-fertilization,&quot; messages would get out about what was going on
and there'd be a feedback loop and a realization that people were working in a
similar direction to reflect their business needs. While they might not make
all the same choices, Ms. Adair expressed confidence they'd get to the
interoperability that was their goal. </P>
<P>Mr. Reese said what he'd look for as an operator was that someone had an
inventory of all the standards they strove to do and ensured that groups were
formed to work on each, knew their status and who worked on them, and
participated in breaking any bottlenecks. If that was the role of the
government, so be it. Ms. Love said she'd like the government to solve the
unique identifier problem. </P>
<P>Anticipating tremendous impact from this project, Dr. McDonald agreed that
the government stating what it would use would be a tipping force and a
rallying cry. He said such an approach would be especially brilliant because
they couldn't mandate in America. Interface engines were a
$300,000,000-$400,000,000-a-year business because everybody used standards, but
not correctly. Reflecting on how hard it was to standardize, Dr. McDonald noted
that, although mandated by law, 40 years later the metric system still wasn't
standard in America. And it took 50 years to get color TVs in half the homes or
build an interface system. </P>
<P>Noting that the U.K. was a small environment with a different way to manage
that America could take lessons from, Dr. McDonald asked if physicians in the
U.K. knew READ code numbers by heart, as they did CPT numbers. Dr. Price said
physicians knew some five character alphanumeric READ Codes, but he doubted
they'd remember the SNOWMED-64-bit, unsigned integer. </P>
<P>Mr. Scanlon said they assumed in the U.S. that the suite of HIPAA standards,
including privacy and security, was more or less a platform for the next wave
of standards. The mandate was kind of a double-edged sword, because everyone
wasn't motivated to implement some of the standards, even though they were
presumably industry standards. The HIPAA experience had been instructive,
albeit it was a mandated, regulatory kind of approach for what was being
envisioned here in terms of strategies. They'd thought they were adopting their
own standards, but upon reflection they might not be as standard as they'd
thought. They'd received a lot of push back from colleagues. Mr. Scanlon asked
how one made this assessment about where they really were and what the
likelihood was.</P>
<P>Mr. Reese said officially he thought HIPAA was a good thing, if it worked.
Unfortunately, it got ground down and some of the advantages in the original
legislation were being watered down as it went through the iterations. From an
operator's perspective, a whole industry had sprung up around clearinghouses
that worked like a big interface engine and pushed the data out to the target
payer. When they'd started down the road with HIPAA, Mr. Reese said they'd
counted on financial advantages. He said he'd constantly been in a battle to
learn and wasn't aware of how the standards were developed. Then he'd gone into
a do-nothing mode of because there was so much public uproar that he'd have
wasted millions of dollars if he'd remediated the Sentara environment to
reflect the original version of the HIPAA legislation. Mr. Reese applauded
HIPAA, saying he'd thought it was a good idea that would make a difference and
reduce costs, but now he questioned whether they'd get the benefit they
originally thought.</P>
<P>Noting Dr. Overhage mentioned standardizing what Dr. Yasnoff interpreted as
business rules (e.g., the Dwyer Tables), Dr. Yasnoff asked if he felt the HL-7
guidelines group addressed this issue sufficiently. Dr. Overhage said he hadn't
seen much of the guidelines group's work, but found in the public-private
collaborative business rules or business data maintenance without a home. He
suggested the Committee create a base for them. One challenge was determining
whether there might be a standard for representing them. Dr. Overhage said this
wasn't HL-7's usual modus operandi and he doubted it could populate the
standard with content. He noted someone had to determine who owned content that
was of broad interest and national value. Dr. Yasnoff suggested the Committee
might want to investigate what they'd heard further.</P>
<P>Dr. Hammond commented that there were all kinds of business rules. He
recommended that the Committee encourage CMS to develop a machine-readable
standard format for business rules as part of its care plan and reimbursement
strategy, so programs could be built to interact with them. He remarked that
what made standards so important was that the healthcare system had been pushed
about as far as it could: there was a shortage of human resources and a need to
replace them--the next advantage was the cost containment gained from
automation. Dr. Hammond emphasized that business rules might be one of the most
important things done with the standard. </P>
<P>Dr. Hammond pointed out that the standards community hadn't engaged the
clinical specialty groups. HL-7, clinical trials, and pediatrics had some
activities. But the community needed to identify and bring together these
people and engage them in providing content.</P>
<P>Dr. Cohn said that, unlike Dr. Hammond's description of coordination, he'd
heard groups trying to deal with acceleration and implementation (i.e., how to
get things out of an HL-7 committee and used). He noted commonality of interest
and agreement about areas needing work and decisions and said he believed
government could serve as the tipping point, providing direction and guidance.
And he noted the need for industry input to ensure government didn't wind up
having one standard and private industry another. Dr. Cohn remarked that saying
NHII was only as good as its weakest link might be close to the truth. He noted
Mr. Blair extended the question of identifying standards to how to encourage
the healthcare industry, already in relatively dire financial straits, to
implement functionality with the standards. </P>
<P>Ms. Greenberg recalled that at the June meeting the full Committee asked the
groups to return in September and then looked to the Subcommittee to accelerate
that, which led to today's panel. While she didn't feel it necessary to repeat
this in a month for the full Committee, Ms. Greenberg noted the need to report
this discussion and partner with these activities throughout next year. Dr.
Cohn said he'd heard about good activities and suggested a progress report at
the following full Committee meeting in November. Ms. Adair said she felt she'd
received an assignment to return in September and would report that their
conversation brought people together interested in moving in the same
direction. </P>
<P><B>Panel 5: Issues in Transitioning to New Code Sets</B></P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Jim Daley, <I>HIPAA program Director, Blue Cross Blue Shield of South
Carolina</I></B></LI>
</UL>
<P>Mr. Daley noted the new national standards for health care transactions and
code sets were adopted to simplify benefits administration and introduce
greater savings and fewer hassles to consumers, health plans and health care
providers. BCBSA fully supported those goals. He said the cornerstones of
health care administrative systems were the diagnosis and procedure codes.
While current Transactions and Code Sets Rule could be viewed as the equivalent
of resurfacing a building's exterior, Mr. Daley said moving to ICD-10 diagnosis
and procedure coding was comparable to replacing the building's internal
framework. Wholesale change had to be approached cautiously, so potential
impact could be evaluated and code changes didn't result in unintended, adverse
consequences.</P>
<P>A report aired in March 2000 described migration to ICD-10 as the &quot;most
significant overhaul of the medical coding system since the advent of
computers.&quot; A recent report from GAO raised concerns about ICD-10-PCS
implementation challenges and the associated financial burden on the industry.
The report referenced an example of the complexity of migrating to ICD-10:
under ICD-9 a single code (code 36.91) designated coronary vessel aneurysm
repair while ICD-10-PCS generated 180 corresponding codes. Diagnosis and
procedure codes were used throughout the industry to classify symptoms,
treatments or services; perform reimbursement functions; and conduct
statistical analysis for health care training or rating. Clinical codes were
the underpinning of virtually everything in the health care system and change
to ICD-10 would impact payment, medical policies, and quality improvement
programs while benefiting design, fraud, and abuse detection.</P>
<P>Given the vast differences between ICD-10-CM, ICD-10-PCS and currently used
code sets, Mr. Daley said implementation of ICD-10 code sets would present
tremendous challenges to the health care community, including the direct impact
associated with being able to use the codes, and impact associated with
transitioning between coding schemes.</P>
<P>The anticipated cost of the code sets approached Y2K costs for transactions.
Neither the costs nor benefits were fully demonstrated. Noting significant
transitional issues came amid initial HIPAA standards implementation, Mr. Daley
cautioned that in-house and packaged software would be impacted. Reimbursement
and contracting procedures, care management policies, and training forms might
require change. The payer software, including interfaces between software built
in house and vendor packages, would need carefully coordinated updates, and
logic built into many applications that directly interrogated specific code
values would add to the complexity of accommodating ICD-10. A fully functioning
crosswalk had to be available and changes of this magnitude required extensive
testing. Optical character recognition programs and voice response units would
need adjustment. Provider software used for scheduling, billing, claim
submission, financial performance and intensive care ER activity would all be
impacted by ICD-10. Packaged software would require changes to screens, logic
reports, and databases. Software vendors would need sufficient lead time to
update applications, negotiate with clients and roll out new releases to
support its sites.</P>
<P>Mr. Daley noted that modifying diagnosis and procedure coding would impact
the heart of the reimbursement process based on knowing the patient's condition
and how it was treated. DRGs, APCs and line pricing would require attention.
AMA projected 8.4 million physicians' contracts and fee schedules would require
renegotiation. Mr. Daley estimated hospitals would have to renegotiate 140,000
contracts. The impact on providers would include fee schedules, contracts, new
software, learning to use new coding changes, and documentation to determine
appropriate codes to use with the increased specificity. Mr. Daley said
employers and members might experience an impact, and if the new ICD-10 codes
impacted the amount billed for a particular visit, consumers' coinsurance
payments could change. Administrative services, which only contracted ASO when
the customer was self-funded, could see reduced payments shrink their bottom
line.</P>
<P>Mr. Daley added that procedures would require review and potential
modification because of new diagnosis and procedure coding. Extensive training
would be required, resulting in potential for incorrect coding during this
period. Even though HIPAA didn't apply to paper, provider visit sheets listing
codes and paper claims and requisition forms for tests within hospitals would
need adjustment. Trend analysis utilization management and other areas would
have to resolve how to relate statistics coded under ICD-9 to those coded under
ICD-10. Payers and providers would need systems and processes to manage both
ICD-9 and -10 code structures during the transition. Even with a suitable
crosswalk, maintaining dual-coding structures would be, at best, cumbersome,
and ability to capture historical data or review utilization information would
be difficult. Ability to perform retrospective audits and other reviews relied
on comparison between historical and current claims. Payers needed accurate
utilization data in order to determine rates for their customer accounts.</P>
<P>Mr. Daley identified concerns that needed to be resolved: (1) would
information systems be required to support dual standards during transition or
would a hard cut-over date be acceptable, (2) how would archived data that
might be needed for legal purposes and audits be treated, (3) if HIPAA didn't
apply to paper claims, could providers continue to use ICD-9 coding for an
indefinite period, meeting the potential ongoing need to accommodate dual
coding standards. Mr. Daley noted this could also impact certain electronic
transactions (e.g., what would be the status of paper claims with ICD-9 coding
if the transaction standards called for ICD-10 code). Other considerations
included a potential for increased fraud during this cut-over period as
everyone was still unfamiliar with the codes. Noting that, even if everything
were honest, it would be difficult to determine if fraud occurred for another
reason, Mr. Daley said patient treatment hopefully wouldn't be hindered, but
any confusion about the coding structure could result in potential implications
for care management. Also noting that costs and benefits hadn't been fully
studied, Mr. Daley said an industry-wide evaluation of the potential downstream
impacts had to be done.</P>
<P>BCBSA recommended that there should be no migration until the initial HIPAA
mandates were successfully implemented and a thorough impact analysis,
including cost/benefits of migrating or not migrating as well as transitional
considerations were analyzed and alternatives assessed. Mr. Daley emphasized
that this was a big change with high impact, risks, and costs. Implications
hadn't been fully defined. Mr. Daley urged the Committee to approach with
caution.</P>
<P><B>Panel 5: Issues in Transitioning to New Code Sets</B></P>
<UL>
<LI><B>James Cross, M.D., <I>National Medical Director, Medical Policy and
National Transplants, Aetna</I></B></LI>
</UL>
<P>Dr. Cross, testifying on behalf of Aetna and the American Association of
Health Plans, noted the use of ICD-10 codes for medical diagnosis and procedure
coding was debated for years. The primary reasons given for changing to the new
coding system were concerns that ICD-9-CM codes might be inadequate and didn't
provide sufficiently detailed IFH care research and statistical analysis. What
hadn't been fully assessed was the potential cost and administrative burden of
moving to a new, complicated coding structure. Dr. Cross urged the Subcommittee
to thoroughly consider costs and complexities associated with the proposed
migration to ICD-10.</P>
<P>Currently, codes contained in Volumes 1 and 2 of ICD-9-CM were used for
diagnosis coding in most inpatient and outpatient settings. Volume 3 included
procedure codes used in inpatient institutional settings (i.e., hospitals).
There were separate procedure coding systems for other health care settings,
primarily the Current Procedural Terminology, Fourth Edition (CPT-4) developed
by the AMA and used in physicians' offices and other outpatient institutional
settings (e.g., ambulatory surgical centers).</P>
<P>While CPT-4 procedure codes continued to be used in many outpatient
settings, the proposed migration to ICD-10 would require use of ICD-10-PCS for
procedure coding for inpatient institutional settings. Dr. Cross noted that the
Committee was considering recommending use of ICD-10-CM for all diagnosis
coding. However, he cautioned that a change to ICD-10 for diagnosis and
inpatient procedure codes would result in a tremendous burden, especially for
physicians, because of costs and complexity associated with such a major
change.</P>
<P>Migration to ICD-10 diagnosis and procedure codes would result in a
substantial increase in the number of fields used for the coding process and a
significant change to a system requiring both numbers and letters. For example,
current diagnosis codes were a numeric system (with supplementary letter codes)
using a minimum of three and a maximum of five digits. ICD-10 diagnosis codes
combined letters and numbers and used a minimum of three and a maximum of six
digits. Current ICD-9-CM procedure codes were numeric with a minimum of three
digits and a maximum of four digits, while ICD-10-PCS procedure codes were
alphanumeric with seven required digits. As a result, the number of possible
codes increased dramatically. As CMS explained during earlier hearings,
ICD-9-CM, Volume 3 contained fewer than 4000 codes, but the current draft of
ICD-10-PCS contained 197,769 codes. And CMS reported that number of procedure
codes could be expanded with development of new medical technologies. </P>
<P>Changes to ICD-10 also would increase the complexity of the coding process.
Migration would require substantial physician and hospital staff training,
significantly adding to administrative costs. Switching to ICD-10 also would
increase the amount of time physicians and administrative support staff must
devote to the coding process. Currently, physicians and administrative support
staff utilized a four-digit numeric code to designate procedures. With a change
to ICD-10-PCS, there would be more fields in the code; all of them would have
to be completed for an accurate, useful code. Physicians would have to provide
additional and more specific information in the medical record on procedures
used and were likely to be more &quot;hands-on&quot; in the coding processes.
Administrative staffs would spend more time coding and might require more
frequent consultation with medical staff to determine exactly which procedures
were performed.</P>
<P>A coding change would also have significant impact on health care payers
(e.g., insurers, managed care plans, employers and government programs as well
as business partners--billing and claims service vendors and health care
clearinghouses). Migration to ICD-10 would impact these entities' multiple
systems. Existing hardware systems (e.g., computer mainframes and optical
scanning systems) would have to be updated or replaced in order to process
additional fields. New claims and other transactions forms would have to be
developed and extensive software revisions required to incorporate the ICD-10
codes into payment and claims systems. Payment methodologies would have to be
modified to account for new codes. Dr. Cross said that ICD-10-PCS, a tool for
reporting procedures, wasn't a reimbursement methodology because it didn't
include &quot;global&quot; codes necessary for payment adjudication systems.
While ICD-10-PCS provided detailed and separate codes for every step of a
medical procedure (e.g., heart surgery), it had no mechanism allowing the
combination of codes related to reimbursement. New payment related codes had to
be created and agreed upon using a combination of the individual ICD-10-PCS
codes. </P>
<P>A recent GAO report analyzing whether a single coding system should be
adopted for all inpatient and outpatient medical procedures included a
discussion of the merits and disadvantages of changing to ICD-10-PCS. While
indicating that ICD-10-PCS provided greater coding specificity, the report
noted difficulties switching to ICD-10-PCS and stated &quot;the design and
logic of 10-PCS raised concerns about potential challenges in its
implementation.&quot; In some cases, ICD-10-PCS's specificity created a
significantly greater number of codes for certain sets of similar procedures
that might reduce coding accuracy. Dr. Cross noted that ICD-10-PCS was also a
departure from the design and logic of ICD-9-CM, Volume 3; the existing health
care administration system would need to be changed significantly to
accommodate the new code set, imposing additional financial costs and
administrative burden on a health care industry already undertaking changes to
comply with the adopted HIPAA standard code sets.</P>
<P>Aetna supported the conclusions outlined in the GAO report on the potential
administrative and financial burdens of changing to ICD-10-PCS. Dr. Cross said
it was crucial to conduct a study of the potential cost of this change before
making a decision to migrate to ICD-10 for diagnosis, procedure coding or both.
The financial impact on government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid and
on private sector payers was unclear. The ultimate consideration must be that
all costs would be passed on to consumers already experiencing a significant
rise in health care costs. Dr. Cross urged NCVHS to make a more detailed
analysis.</P>
<P><B>Discussion: Standards and Security Issues - Draft Recommendations for
Code Sets</B></P>
<P>Asked if any organization in the US used ICD-10-PCS or had experience with
it, Dr. Cross said he didn't believe ICD-10-PCS was in practical use within at
least the commercial industry, and ICD-10 international was a totally different
system. Pat Brooks said versions of draft ICD-10-PCS were available on the CMS
home page since 1998. Another draft would be available this year. Germany might
make a decision to implement ICD-10-PCS and other countries had translated it.
Ms. Brooks pointed out that, although ICD-10-PCS was in the public domain, it
was still in development and shouldn't yet be used. Dr. Cross commented that
before anyone used it agreement was needed; otherwise it would be a one-way
street. Ms. Brooks noted a conversion table between ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-PCS was
on the home page.</P>
<P>Nellie Leon-Chisen, representing AHA, said that with the shortage of coders
and more work she doubted that many hospitals double coded, but when ICD-10-PCS
was made available for testing a number of hospitals volunteered to double code
for a short period of time and submitted their comments to 3M and CMS. The
majority said it was easy to learn and use and they liked it. Ms. Trudel said
that the previous testimony appeared to fly in the face of what the
Subcommittee heard about ICD-10 and ICD-9-CM over the past months: a number of
people testified that ICD-9-CM was &quot;broken&quot; and that there was a
finite amount of time before it ceased to be specific enough to meet some needs
just mentioned.</P>
<P>Mr. Daley said for reimbursement purposes BCBSA didn't go down to the
granular level of detail one might for research and other statistics and it
reimbursed based on ICD-9-CM and had done okay with that system. </P>
<P>Dr. Cross said the challenge with ICD-9-CM was that it hadn't been utilized
by practicing providers (e.g., physicians without the coding expertise or time
to code at a higher level) as much as it could in the detail it already
provided. With ICD-9-CM one could use a relatively generic valid code, using
three digits and not necessarily have to increase the specificity by going down
to the last two digits. Many ICD-9-CM submissions weren't as specific as they
could be. Often, particularly with laboratories, just getting the diagnosis on
the claims submission was troublesome. But Dr. Cross said Aetna had a wealth of
data; if the practicing community appropriately used ICD-9-CM, it gave more
than enough specificity. The challenge was to use ICD-9-CM in information that
could change administration and impact health care outcomes.</P>
<P>Dr. Cross said at some point they'd run out of code combinations they'd like
to have in ICD-9-CM. His major concern wasn't ICD-10-CM ( diagnosis), but
ICD-10-PCS (procedure) coding. He advised that if they implemented ICD-10 they
implement it in phases. He recommended doing ICD-10-CM for diagnosis first,
rather than more complicated procedure coding linked to reimbursement logic,
because then the industry and practicing physicians would get used to the
methodology. Dr. Cross said the challenge was how to move from a CPT-4
environment into the ICD-10-PCS reimbursement and coding logic at odds with the
goal of the statistical reporting environment.</P>
<P>Recalling that Dr. Cross mentioned physicians had difficulty with
ICD-10-PCS, Ms. Brooks noted ICD-10-PCS wasn't developed to replace CPT for
physicians' office use, but was meant to replace ICD-9-CM procedures in
hospitals. Dr. Cross said that depended on the HIPAA standards picked in terms
of the coding logic; they could use ICD-10-PCS and allow CPT-4 coding to take
place. Mr. Daley noted another concern was that the original proposal was to
move to a single procedure coding system. The reimbursement and payer community
lacked knowledge of what ICD-10-PCS was all about and didn't know what the
impact might be. He said further study might find it wasn't so bad; the GAO
report seemed to support that concept, but they needed to study it. Mr. Daley
expressed fear of a mandate and emphasized that they needed to know what they
were doing if they made a recommendation.</P>
<P>Ms. Pickett clarified that the ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes were up to five
digits and mandatory; Medicare and other payers required that a three- or
four-digit code couldn't be used when a five-digit code existed. Mr. Daley
added that a payer organization needed to interrogate all of them, but could
give a general idea of the condition and pay based on the procedure. Asked what
alternatives he was suggesting, Mr. Daley replied that the plans hadn't
discussed any, but he said they needed to look at ICD-9-CM: ICD-9-CM didn't
have any alphas except for V&amp;E codes. He questioned whether anyone had
pursued modifying ICD-9-CM, Vol. 3 for a new technology, and suggested a
variety of things could be investigated. </P>
<P>Dr. Cohn remarked that ICD-10-PCS had about 180,000 codes for hospital,
surgical, and procedures, but typically people were paid based on DRGs, which
were heavily diagnosis with a bit of procedure attached; what already existed
was collapsed into fewer categories. Dr. Cohn asked if anyone foresaw an
upcoming human issue where use of anything this granular would allow CMS to do
something the Subcommittee should consider. Ms. Brooks noted that last year's
proposed notice of the DRG indicated changes people wanted made and Congress
had asked CMS to be more responsive to new technology and do a quicker job of
updating the code system and being more specific. CMS had laid out a number of
new technology issues (would they keep ICD-9-CM and do the best they could,
make up a new system, or move to ICD-10-PCS) and the bottom line was, without
room for DRGs, they couldn't be responsive to Congress's mandate.</P>
<P>Ms. Brooks said if they went to ICD-10-PCS it would be in the transition
year. CMS would take the ICD-10-PCS codes with the existing conversion table
and put back codes that affected DRG. So, the first year, new DRGs wouldn't
have a payment impact. CMS would map the new coding system over the old one.
CMS wasn't planning to double the number of DRGs, but as they responded to
hospitals' need to be more specific they would sometimes utilize more codes. 
</P>
<P>Responding to the issue about aneurysm repair, Ms. Brooks confirmed that
ICD-9-CM only had one code for that repair, but she noted it couldn't convey a
particular part of the body. ICD-10-PCS had a number of codes because they told
what you were doing. Ms. Brooks said sometimes there were more codes, but still
only one was selected. In CMS's experience with testing, ICD-10-PCS codes
didn't lead to more codes, but to more information on the bill.</P>
<P>Noting the speakers mentioned impacts on fee schedules, Ms. Greenberg said
she understood that ICD-9-CM, Volume 3, for which ICD-10-PCS would be a
replacement, wasn't used in physician fee schedules. Ms. Brooks concurred.
ICD-9-CM wasn't used by any private insurance carriers for fee schedules. Most
fee schedules were for payments like lab fee, durable medical equipment, and
physician fee schedules that used CPT and wouldn't be replaced. Ms. Trudel
explained that, because HIPAA standards went into effect before these decisions
were made, the only possible use of ICD-9-CM procedure codes was inpatient
hospital. Dr. McDonald asked if insurance companies used ICD-9-CM procedure
codes to decide anything but what they paid the hospitals. Ms. Greenberg said
the codes affected DRG. Fee schedules applied to physician services in
hospitals, but those were based on CPT; fee schedules didn't apply to inpatient
hospital costs. </P>
<P><B>Discussion: Standards and Security Issues - Draft Recommendations for
Code Sets</B></P>
<P>Dr. Cohn recounted that the Subcommittee held a number of hearings on this
relatively complex, contentious issue and that it was hard to tease diagnosis
and procedures apart. Dr. Cohn outlined options: a letter recommending putting
both together, moving to an NPRM or NOI, doing nothing, or further Subcommittee
deliberation (which wouldn't be for months). They'd heard conflicting testimony
that the industry preferred to implement together but staggering them made
conceptual sense. They'd also heard additional studies of implementation costs
and benefits had to be done before an NPRM or NOI. </P>
<P>Mr. Daley said, in certain conditions, ICD-10's increased specificity could
identify which conditions helped expedite payment, care management, fraud and
abuse protection. BCBSA was concerned about the complexity and degree of
impact. AAHP worried about the administrative and financial costs of dealing
with additional complexity. Noting Dr. Cohn asked for a cost/benefit study, Mr.
Blair said he wanted to include providers and improving patient outcomes,
clinical research, and information hospital administrators needed to improve
the cost structure. He noted testifiers indicated that the cost/benefit for the
payer sector wasn't generous enough. </P>
<P>Dr. McDonald reported that the written comments (two-and-a-half for;
three-and-a-half against) left him cynical. AHA's studies boiled down to 100
charts evaluated by CMS's contractors. Dr. McDonald called for an independent
reviewer's detailed numerics.</P>
<P>Nellie Leon-Chisen said AHA believed ICD-10-PCS was sufficient for inpatient
hospital reporting. Recalling Dr. McDonald's observation at the June meeting
that physicians weren't clamoring for more codes but wanted guidance, Kathryn
Serkes, speaking for AAPS, noted physicians wanted to address issues of audits,
prosecutions, and fraud. </P>
<P>Mr. Beebe reported that AMA contracted with PricewaterhouseCoopers for a
cost/benefit analysis of different scenarios for the inpatient setting or
achieving a single procedure coding system. </P>
<P>Mr. Augustine pointed out that managed care and payers were good at
collecting and analyzing data ahead of the curve. He remarked on their progress
utilizing medical and disease management and said he'd like to see more
information or put what they had into a better format.</P>
<P>Dr. McDonald said he wouldn't be opposed to an NOI with these caveats, but
expressed concern about acting on the basis of 100 sample records. Dr. Cohn
suggested a letter to the Secretary, noting the need for a cost/benefit
analysis within six months. Meanwhile the Subcommittee could collect similar
data. </P>
<P>Ms. Brooks predicted that, if the Committee did an NOI or NPRM, hospitals
would do their own independent studies. An NPRM would force government to
analyze the cost and calculate a projection the industry would read carefully
and respond to through several iterations. </P>
<P>Ms. Trudel explained that a NOI provided a view of potential issues, laid
out options, and, being in the Federal Register, drew wide public comment.
After assessing that input, an NPRM could present options and solicit further
comment. An NOI wouldn't require a full-fledged impact analysis. Ms. Greenberg
cautioned that an NPRM had to follow an NOI before doing a final rule and would
delay the process. Delay wasn't always a negative; an NOI for the unique
identifier led to a mandate not to proceed. But they'd heard concerns about how
much longer organizations could continue with codes 25 years old that couldn't
be updated and reflected antiquated terminology discarded by the rest of the
world. She noted Ms. Trudel had pointed out that they could accomplish
everything in an NPRM that they might with an NOI <I>and</I> force the
Department to do the impact or cost/benefit analysis. </P>
<P>Ms. Brooks predicted that, with ICD-10-PCS, hospitals would continue to code
what they did today under DRGs, even though more codes could be used for
internal purposes. </P>
<P>Dr. McDonald said , with the knowledge they had now, he'd go with an NPRM.
Mr. Augustine reiterated a preference for an NPRM with options for an impact
analysis and adopting both, one, or a future approach.</P>
<P>Noting an NOI could tie the General Counsel's hands, Ms. Trudel proposed
recommending specific concerns and issues, including cost/benefit analysis and
documented testing of actual coding using real-life charts.</P>
<P>Mr. Blair concurred with Dr. McDonald's concerns about broader, more
comprehensive testing. Testifiers reiterated the need for the business case and
Mr. Blair said he wanted to ensure that case was across the board and broader
than cost/benefit for payers. He expressed concern over further delay.
Consensus that implementation wouldn't be until two years after October 2003
already meant compliance and adoption couldn't happen before October 2005. With
an NOI, that date might slip uncontrollably later. An NPRM would allow for the
cost/benefit issues and additional testing. Dr. McDonald said making the wrong
decision fast wouldn't help. Mr. Blair replied that they could draw upon
negative feedback.</P>
<P>Dr. McDonald said he'd looked: there were 7,000 more codes available in
ICD-9-CM, Volume 3, and ways to code another year. Ms. Brooks noted a write up
on the issue of extending existing codes. She noted the way the tree added
alphanumeric digits didn't get at the root of the structure's problem. She
recalled public meetings 10 years ago with the ICD-9-CM Coordination
Maintenance Committee that explored ways to expand the four digits. People had
been adamantly against it. </P>
<P>Dr. Cohn noted Mr. Blair proposed an NPRM. With the right caveats, Dr.
McDonald opted for an NOI. Dr. Cohn said key issues were differences between
mechanisms (e.g.,, NPRMs and NOIs), open issues needing resolution, and
uncertainty about a solution. They were talking multiple things. He asked if
members wanted a letter expressing concerns and next steps or to recommend an
NOI or NPRM. Mr. Augustine reiterated the possibility of an NPRM, with the
option of implementing separately or both internally. Mr. Blair noted they'd
discussed caveats and testing. Dr. Fitzmaurice cautioned against stretching
this beyond when many members remained at the table. Though an NPRM might solve
some problems, he understood Dr. McDonald's concern about ensuring the right
decision and he acknowledged an NOI was appealing. But an NPRM would force the
government to do an impact or benefit/cost analysis before making comments and
framed issues so people could comment and trust government to follow that NPRM
and turn out a good final rule. Dr. Fitzmaurice said he was sensitive to the
time an NPRM took, but it worked with other HIPAA standards and everybody
agreed they needed information. He concurred with Ms. Trudel who'd urged the
Subcommittee not to tie the hands of the Department, but encouraged it to
provide enough information to make a better recommendation at a future time. 
</P>
<P>Ms. Trudel reiterated that the Subcommittee had four alternatives: do
nothing, recommend a specific code set, hold more hearings, or do additional
analysis using the Administrative Procedural Act process to gain input and
involvement--CMS would decide on an NOI, NPRM, open town hall meeting, or
industry forum announced in the Federal Register. Dr. McDonald said he'd like
to stop short of an NPRM.</P>
<P>Ms. Greenberg said today they'd heard, &quot;Go with diagnosis first.&quot;
The last hearing, they were told, &quot;Go with ICD-10-PCS and ICD-10-CM
together.&quot; Dr. McDonald said he didn't consider ICD-10-CM much different,
but expressed concern about ICD-10-PCS. Ms. Greenberg noted some European
countries had seven years experience with the diagnosis code and many had
implemented 10 or clinical modifications; 10-PCS hadn't been available. </P>
<P>Noting his hesitancy when Dr. McDonald held a different view, Mr. Blair
suggested the plus for an NOI was it didn't set the process in a bound time
line; the downside was delays. With an NPRM, people weren't so vulnerable to
open-ended delay and might determine if their direction was misguided,
incomplete or incorrect. Dr. McDonald noted CMS's enthusiasm for moving with
ICD-10-PCS as fast as possible, but emphasized that a hundred cases didn't
indicate anything. Dr. McDonald said he was interested in comparisons, not
continuous improvement, and wouldn't make decisions on any process change in
his hospital based on that data. With 280 million Americans and a trillion
dollar budget, more should be invested in the solidity of the data used in
decision-making. </P>
<P>Dr. Zubeldia considered issues about ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes, ICD-10-PCS
institutional procedures, and ICD-10-PCS for professional use (not recommended)
quite different and advised separate NOIs or NPRMs. Noting issues were
different for each, after everything they'd heard he said he favored the NPRM
because it forced government to make an impact analysis. But he stressed there
had to be separate analyses for procedure and diagnosis codes, as well as
procedure codes for professional services. An additional issue was whether
adoption should be synchronized. Observing that even today's testifiers weren't
as concerned about implementing diagnosis codes as procedure codes, Dr.
Zubeldia voted for the NPRM, with the caveat that components be addressed
separately. </P>
<P>Reiterating that an NPRM would allow them to surface issues and correct
where they were misguided, Mr. Blair endorsed it with Dr. McDonald's caveat
about testing. Mr. Blair observed that Dr. Zubeldia's suggestion to separate
sections in the NPRM for ICD-10-PCS, ICD-10-CM, and other pieces was similar to
their first draft with the deadline of no sooner than October 2005.</P>
<P>Reminding everyone that the NPRM process hadn't identified problems with the
NDC code that they only began to understand later, Theresa Dalmer, Blue Cross
and Blue Shield Association, cautioned that identifiers and modification to the
transactions and code sets were also being done and an operational date of 2005
was ambitious. She questioned that in 60 days they'd get the information needed
to accurately anticipate impact. Noting comments about impact on hospitals
emphasized evaluating across the industry, Ms. Dalmer noted many players didn't
look at the Federal Register or NPRMs. They'd have to reach out in other ways. 
</P>
<P>Mr. Blair suggested extending the 60-day response period to 90 or 120 days.
He envisioned the NPRM extending not only a time frame that could be changed by
public testimony and critiques, but also establishing a mechanism that formally
solicited comments and drew in the business case. Dr. Zubeldia expressed
concern that an impact analysis might not reflect private industry's view.
Recalling Mr. Beebe mentioned that AMA might do its own impact analysis, he
asked how the process could reflect private industry impact analyses. Dr.
Fitzmaurice noted perspectives submitted as comments to the NPRM had to be
considered. Dr. Zubeldia pointed out that comments didn't have to be published
in the final rule; he suggested before the NPRM the government could informally
publish a white paper depicting its impact analysis alongside private
industry's analysis, putting both in the NPRM. Ms. Greenberg noted WEDI's
impact analysis was highly referenced in the NPRM on transactions and code
sets. Other analyses could be referenced and points of agreement stated. Asked
if the government could publish its impact analysis independent of and prior to
the NPRM, Ms. Greenberg clarified that the rule-making process went through
numerous parts of the government; publishing prior to the NPRM didn't make
sense, because one couldn't go through that vetting process. </P>
<P>Mr. Augustine agreed with Dr. Zubeldia's original proposal of an NPRM, but
separated out aspects. Dr. Zubeldia emphasized that the industry needed to see
the government's and other impact analyses before evaluating the NPRM. He
encouraged going for the NOI if they could get all the extra things done. </P>
<P>Dr. Zubeldia proposed that the government do a full impact analysis, compare
it with private analyses, and move expediently as possible to rule making. He
advocated doing an NPRM, if required to do an impact analysis, pre-publishing
it before the NPRM. The staff said that wasn't possible. Mr. Blair suggested
extending the public comment period. Dr. Cohn reminded everyone that they were
a subcommittee of an advisory body to HHS and limited in what they could do.
Members discussed whether the Committee could contract for an impact analysis.
Mr. Augustine added that he'd prefer doing their own impact analysis before
taking that next step, if they could do it themselves and ensure it happened in
a timely manner. Dr. Fitzmaurice suggested a study with hard coders double
coding and comparing 2,000-5,000 forms, acknowledging that probably was beyond
NCVHS's resources. </P>
<P>Ms. Trudel reiterated their four options. She noted Dr. Zubeldia and Mr.
Augustine voted for further study. Ms. Greenberg said the Subcommittee could
commission a parallel study; it wouldn't accomplish what the NPRM process
would, but they could hold hearings about other studies. But she cautioned that
was no different than delaying another few years and didn't inform the field.
Dr. McDonald advised that, if feasible given the time frame, a NOI was more
sensible because it generated studies. Ms. Greenberg reiterated that a NOI
added years to the process. Dr. Cohn recorded a vote in favor of going forward
with an NPRM, with one negative.</P>
<P>Members discussed asking the Secretary to inform the public of their intent
and urging industry to perform its own impact and cost/benefit studies in
advance of release of any NPRM. Reflecting on Mr. Blair's desire for full
industry appraisal, Ms. Greenberg suggested commissioning a study that
&quot;quantified benefits. Mr. Augustine cautioned that was extremely
difficult. </P>
<P>Members approved the direction of the original document. A revision will be
distributed before the next meeting. Dr. McDonald was assured that he'd have an
opportunity to discuss his minority opinion to the full Committee. Dr. Cohn
explained he'd abstained because this dealt with procedure codes as well as
diagnosis codes, and wouldn't give an opinion to the Committee. Noting the
implementation date recommended in the document seemed impossible, Dr. Cohn
suggested thinking about it as they moved forward.</P>
<P><B>Discussion: DSM-IV</B></P>
<P>Dr. Cohn noted the Secretary received letters from APA requesting that
DSM-IV be named a code standard for use in psychiatry and mental health and
that APA be named the DSMO. Staff had prepared drafts backgrounding issues and
potential recommendations. The initial view was these activities should be
separate; typically, DSMOs maintained transactions rather than diagnostic
criteria. The Department received no comments from the industry recommending
adoption of DSM-IV during the 60-day comment period for the transactions and
code sets NPRM. But they'd heard concern that, once ICD-9-CM was the standard
for diagnosis reporting, mental health couldn't use the diagnostic criteria in
DSM-IV. The Subcommittee's interest was that mental health professionals and
psychiatrists could continue using the diagnostic criteria in DSM, as well as
crosswalks between DSM-IV to ICD-9-CM. Dr. Cohn sought members' and APA's
perspective. If there was agreement, the Subcommittee or staff would draft a
letter to the Secretary for review at the next meeting stating continued use of
DSM-IV diagnostic criteria that crosswalked to ICD-9-CM codes didn't pose a
conflict with code sets adopted under HIPAA and that adoption of diagnostic
criteria used to establish diagnosis was outside HIPAA's scope. </P>
<P>Dr. Darrel Regier, Director, Research, APA and Executive Director, the
American Psychiatric Institute for Research and Education, conveyed APA's
concern that the legal interpretation of a code set had to be addressed by
HHS's Office of General Counsel. APA's counsel, Mr. Robert Charrow, evaluated
this after APA received concerns and concluded that, according to 45 CFR
162.103's definition, without DSM-IV encoded in the HIPAA statute, the default
descriptor would be the ICD-9-CM glossary and definitions. The Subcommittee
will ask the Department's General Counsel if the concept of diagnostic criteria
was, indeed, separate and distinct from the HIPAA code sets and whether that
made a difference in what the Committee's view might be. Dr. Regier said the
law explicitly acknowledging DSM-IV criteria as the descriptor for the code
numbers would advance things considerably. </P>
<P>Turning to non-legal issues, Ms. Trudel recalled that Dr. Cohn had indicated
the DSMOs were specific to the transaction standards and not clinical code set
maintainers. AMA's CPT Editorial Panel and CMS weren't DSMOs and the
participants didn't have clinical code set expertise and modified the
transaction standards. Beyond this threshold issue, the discussion was about
the clinical code sets. Dr. Regier agreed that the issue was the code set and
mechanism necessary for a publicly approved code maintenance organization. Mr.
Charrow clarified that there were two issues: the scope of the regulatory
provision and the legal impact of a single official code set that had no
diagnostic criteria. He emphasized that eliminating DSM-IV as an official code
set had profound implications on 675 state laws and that, once HIPAA was fully
effective, the informal crosswalk would no longer be viable. </P>
<P>Clarifying that the Subcommittee's main concern was that the crosswalk was
appropriate and people could continue to use diagnostic criteria, Dr. Cohn said
they were searching for a reasonable, speedily implementable solution and the
lawyers would advise if this provided a viable option. He cautioned against
hopes that this could be done with an NPRM before HIPAA was implemented, but he
assured everyone that the Subcommittee wanted this to turn out right for
practitioners and believed there was a solution. The next step was obtaining
CMS's legal counsel's review. Hopefully, lawyer-to-lawyer discussions would
resolve this by the Subcommittee's next breakout session. Dr. Regier said
there's likely to be a court challenge. Dr. Cohn said Ms. Trudel will work
within CMS and the Subcommittee will continue the conversation. The meeting
adjourned at 4:15 p.m.</P>
