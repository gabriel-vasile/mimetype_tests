Monday Morning Sept 16th 1844 {1844/09/16}
					In consequence of protracted ill health having determined to take a voyage at sea, I this morning set sail from New London in the ship Morrison Capt. Green between the hours of eight & nine A.M. We had light winds from the North, and as the ship proceeded slowly out of the harbor, we were accompanied for a short distance by Major Williams, the Rev'd  Mr. Bingham formerly a missionary to the Sandwich Islands and Mr. Andrew M Frink. Mr. Chesebrough. My brother Albert. Mr. Thos Fitch & Richard Chapel. several of my pupils & Augustus Williams accompanied us as far as Montauk & returned in the Pilot Boat. In the Afternoon the wind died away, the vessel rolled considerably, and most of us who had never been at sea, had a touch of sea sickness. In the passage through the Race Mr. Chesebrough pointed out to us the neighboring islands, bays head lands &c &c & related many interesting historical facts, & personal anecdotes connected with them. Our friends left us between five & six P.M. a short distance East of Montauk to return to the city with the Pilot. During the evening the wind was so light that we made but little progress & the Captn thought of anchoring

to prevent our stranding on the southern shore of Long Island. Between 10 & 11 in the evening the wind breezed up from the N.W. and we preceded on our course. At 2 o'clock in the morning Montauk Light was just visible in the distant horizon & shortly after it entirely disappeared

The crew this morning are busily employed in setting up the rigging, preparing whaling geer, fixing the boats &.c. &.c.  All is life & activity excepting with a portion of the raw hands who like myself are enduring the horrible sufferings attendant upon sea sickness.
Last evening about sunset the entire crew were summoned on deck & arranged in a semicircle around the main hatchway, with the Capt & first & second mates in the centre. They were then divided into starboard & larboard watches, by the mates, each choosing in succession his man until all are taken. It is customary for the 2nd Mate to commence the selections, as was the case in the present instance. The Captn accounted for this, by remarking that formerly it was usual for the chief officer to head one watch & have the first choice by virtue of his

[end of page log343_004.gif]

office; that this part of his duty is now assigned to the 2nd mate, & that the privilege accompanies the transfer of the crew for four boats were then selected to be headed by the Captn and the 1st 2nd & 3d mates. The choice was commenced by the Capt'n & followed by the mates in order of rank, each choosing a man and following the selection in the same succession until the requisite number for each boat was completed. The usual compliment is six consisting of the Capt and one of the mates, a Boatsteerer & four seamen. In attacking a whale the Capt or mate stands in the stern & steers with a large oar, & the Boatsteerer row in the bow of the boat until they approach near the animal. He then ships his oar, seizes his harpoon & as soon as sufficiently near darts it into the back of the monster. He then changes places with the Capt or mate & takes the steering oar whilst the superior officer with the lance in hand stands at the bow, ready to plunge it into the heart or the nearest vital parts of the whale as soon as he appears again on the surface.

nearly S.E. During the forenoon it was S.E. by S. This afternoon it has been E by S. the wind from the N.E. & N. had been very fresh - This afternoon almost a gale - There has also been a tremendous sea & the vessel has rolled excessively. This has greatly aggravated our sea sickness & increased its almost intolerable sufferings. During the night the wind blew with such violence as to induce the Capt to take in sail & lie to. Observed latitude 39ø 45' N.

Fresh wind from the N. a tremendous swell. The vessel rolling frightfully so as almost to throw one from his birth. a horrid nausea attended with violent retching & vomiting, severe headache these with their whole train of accompanying ills, are introducing me to some of the pleasures of seafaring life. Our Capt complains that the rigging was not half set up at home, & states that we are in a very unfit condition to encounter a storm. I was surprised at this, as I had been told the vessel should be thoroughly prepared to ride out a gale even at the very outset of the voyage

The Captain thinks we are now crossing the Gulph Stream. The sea as the sailors say is very cross - vessel still rolling prolongs the sufferings of our seasick crew - Quite a number of the men were never before at sea & some of them from the interior of the country are sadly disappointed in the "modus operandi" on ship board. My sea sickness begins to abate, but it leaves me with a dull pain in the head which almost unfits me for any effort either bodily or mentally - Nevertheless I keep up my spirits walk the deck nearly the whole time, converse with the Capt & the men and do almost any thing to divert

Pleasant with the wind about N.E. or N.N.E. - This morning discovered a whaling vessel bound Westward approaching us. Hoping to have an opportunity to send letters I commenced writing, but the Capt coming in, informed me that she would pass some distance from us & that we could not speak her without considerable delay - I accordingly discontinued my writing - The Captain thought she was what

This is the first sabbath I ever spent on the Ocean - So much of the time as my dizziness & headache would permit I have employed in reading the scriptures in meditation & prayer - To day & repeatedly before this I have commended myself & my shipmates to the watchful care and protection of him who rules the winds & the waves & directs all events

Fresh gales from E. by S. throughout the day. For the first time since we sailed, our attention this afternoon was excited by the cry from masthead "there she blows,, - Where? was the prompt and earnest enquiry of the Captain - about two points on the lee bow three or four miles off the instant reply - What is it? asked the Capt. Can't tell certain, but guess it is a Finback. Look sharp & let us know when he blows again - His whaleship however appeared no more. no observation -

This morning the man at mast head discovered a school of Blackfish (as the whalemen term them)  - They were near the ship & though the sea was rough & the wind fresh the Capt ordered the boats to be lowered & pursuit to be made - I solicited & obtained the privilege of going in the boat with the Capt - We ran a half a mile or more and at one time were quite near them, but suddenly they disappeared & we saw there no more. In returning to the

			Sabbath Sept 29th 1844 {1844/09/29}
Comparatively a pleasant day though the sea has been quite rough - Passing the forenoon engaged in reading Nelson on the prophecies respecting the destruction of Babylon & Tyre & examining the prophecies themselves. In the afternoon whilst reading from the same book to the Capt'n on the Poop deck & endeavoring to explain some difficulties which he had felt in respect to certain passages in the Old Testament, he happened to cast his eye astern & noticed an unusual movement in the water, which he thought to be caused by a sperm whale which had just gone down Immediately he called to it the attention of the mate at the mast head, who in a short time announced a school of sperm whales near by - Instantly the boats were lowered & pursuit made. The Captain's boat approached one

[end of page log343_014.gif]

but the Boatsteerer missed him - soon after he struck another but the harpoon drew & thus they lost him - One of the other boats also darted at another and missed him - Having thus gallied or frightened the school the boats returned to the ship unsuccessful - In an hour or two the whales were again seen near by - Pursuit was again made & at this time the Capt succeeded in killing a small female whale. This was then towed to the ship & secured by fastening a large chain around the tail just above the flukes - One of the mates also fastened to a larger whale, but lost him in consequence of the drawing of the iron - This was doubtless owing to the fact that it was not thrown with sufficient energy. The Boatsteerer is a melancholy victim of intemperance. His powers both of body & mind are greatly impaired by his excesses. During the whole time that he has been on board his limbs have trembled, like those of a palsied person; and he daily walks the deck & ascends the rigging with all the moderation of an infirm octogenarian. The mate attributes the loss of the whale entirely to his fault; and states that he had one of the best opportunities in the world, but that he threw the iron 

[end of page log343_015.gif]

more like a dead than a live person. Upon the supposition that this animal would have afforded thirty barrels of oil, which is doubtless sufficiently low, the ship has sustained a loss of about $900 in consequence of this man's drunkenness. Soon after securing the whale along side, a large merchant ship from Liverpool bound to New Orleans approached & spoke us; enquired our longitude &c. The Captn requested him to report us with one sperm whale.

			Monday September 30th {1844/09/30}
The crew during the night have been occupied in preparing to "cut in,, & the ship has been lying to. The cutting in has commenced. The whale is fastened along side the gangway, a staging is suspended by ropes over the side of the vessel, & upon this stands a man with a sharp cutting spade attached to a long handle. He commences by cutting a circle around the body of the whale near the joint of the neck or at least as far as possible before rolling it over; parallel to this first section at a distance of 3 1/2 feet another circle is cut through the blubber

[end of page log343_016.gif]

& then a third section is made across the two first in a line with the body. A deep hole is then made through the blubber a short distance from this cross section & equidistant from the other two, sufficiently large to receive a very strong hook of great size. Into this the hook is then thrust & by means of strong tackles attached to the mainmast this blanket of blubber is torn off from the body - the cutting is continued in circles oblique to the line of the body, the carcass rolling over in the water as the sheet lengthens. When this sheet of the blubber has been elevated as far as the geer will permit a large opening is cut into it, into which are inserted a huge strap & thimble & then secured by a wooden toggle about 3 feet long & four or five inches in diameter. The hook is no longer used, the strap & thimble supplying its place. The blubber is thus rolled off in large blanket pieces, from six to ten feet in length & deposited in the blubber rooms beneath the main hatch. The head is cut off & hoisted aboard, in one entire mass before the blubber is taken from the body. In case the head is too large to be raised at once it is cut into pieces & received separately. The whale having

[end of page log343_017.gif]

thus been divested of its covering of fat the carcass is permitted to float away and become the prey of birds & sharks. Quite a number of the latter have been swimming near the ship all the morning. They are very bold, swimming directly up to the whale whilst the men are at work upon it, & throwing themselves nearly out of the water in order to seize either the blubber or the men. In one instance, whilst one of the men was in the water endeavoring to insert the hook into the blubber, a shark was upon the point of seizing his leg, when he was prevented & almost instantly killed by a smart stroke from the Captain's cutting spade. The business of cutting in having been completed, the ship was again put on her course. This afternoon the crew have been employed in cutting up & boiling the blubber. Wind E.N.E.

During the 2nd Mate's watch last night a vessel was discovered approaching the ship. At first the mate thought it would pass some distance from us, but as she neared us he perceived her steering so directly upon us that he was obliged instantly to put down the helm in order to avoid coming in contact - The crew of the other vessel did not seem to notice ours & without altering their course passed us within speaking distance - Have just visited the sick in the Forecastle; find one of them improving, though still complaining of pain in the head & sickness at the stomach - the other thinks himself no better - has much pain in the side - great weakness - sick at the stomach so as to be unable to keep down his food &c.

food provided  for the crew - He seems to have come to the wrong place to recover from such a disease; though it may be the means of his restoration provided the disorder be not too deeply seated - Another of the patients named [blank space] formerly  a lieutenant in the [blank space]  is suffering from the effects of intemperance - He is the nephew of the late Commodore Rodgers of New London and was once a young man of much promise - He was degraded from office in consequence of his habits, and from that time seems to have pursued the downward career of a reckless drunkard. Though apparently not exceeding forty, he has already the tottering tremulous step of old age. Since leaving port, he has been under the influence of stimulating drinks until at length these failing, his physical energies sink from exhaustion - He is now confined to his bed, the helpless victim of his excessive indulgences.

Discovered this morning a steam vessel bound Westward. She passed within a few miles of us about 4. o'clock, and at sunrise was nearly out of sight. We supposed she was on her way to the West Indies. 
About 11 o clock a large school of what the Whalemen term Cowfish, appeared under the bows of the vessel. Mr. Raymond our second mate seeing a harpoon immediately stationed himself upon the martingals & in a few moments one of the fishes emerging directly under him he succeeded in plunging the instrument through his body.  It was soon drawn out of the water by the crew, a rope secured around him just above the flukes & thus hauled on deck. It proved to be a male, about seven feet & nine inches in length, & in the largest part about three feet in circumference. The blubber (which was from one half to three fourths of an inch in thickness) was taken off & tried & yielded about two gallons of oil. The liver, the heart and the flesh, after being properly prepared, were reserved to be cooked for the officers & men. This animal

Rose a little after three this morning and went on deck for the purpose of ascertaining whether the men were awake at their posts. Enquired of one of the crew if they did not sometimes drop asleep & thus neglect to keep a good lookout, and he replied that the mate frequently came around to see that the watch were all wide awake & ready for action. I have felt somewhat anxious since we came so near encountering a ship a few nights ago, & have repeatedly related to the men on the top gallant forecastle the accidents of this kind with which I have become acquainted, with the view of exciting them to greater vigilance. For several days past Capt Green has been expecting  to come into the N.E. Trade winds, and at one time about a week ago, he thought he had taken them, but was disappointed - to day he feels confident that we have certainly reached them, though instead of blowing from the N.E. their direction at present is South of East of about E by S. -
This morning early, we crossed the tropic of Cancer & are now within the limits of the torrid zone. The north Star and others of the arctic regions are gradually approaching the horizon, & already the stars of the Dipper in Ursa Major in the lower

part of their revolution are invisible. I watch them with increasing interest from night to night, regarding them as old & intimate friends, whom I must soon bid adieu for a considerable season. My regret at loosing their society for a period is however much diminished by the anticipation of cultivating a pleasant acquaintance with their antarctic brothers and sisters in the opposite hemisphere. These are already presenting themselves in the southern sky, and I am beginning every night to grow more & more familiar with their countenances. At two o. clock this afternoon Capt G. took a lunar and we worked it out together. he showing me his method of doing it by Turner's Tables. He also worked the Longitude by both of our Chronometers with the view of comparing the results. The weather this forenoon was somewhat squally, this afternoon pleasant. Wind from the East and East by South Our course has been South by East, or South 1/2 East.  We are now within two days sail of the Cape Verde Islands & as the Capt thinks some of stopping to obtain fresh supplies, I shall write two or three letters in the hope of meeting with an opportunity to send them home, though I regard the prospect as very small.

					Thursday October 16th 1844 {1844/10/16}
We have now been a month & two days upon the ocean. We have seen quite a number of vessels some of which appeared to be bound toward our native land, but have been able to speak but one. We occasionally speculate and converse upon our speculations respecting the events that have transpired at home since we sailed. Capt G. sometimes wishes he could see the Major & Mr. Havens an hour or two & tell them about the ship & the crew especially respecting the mast, which he fears will fail him in cutting in whales, and the Cook & Cooper who are far from being the men he could desire.  We should be very glad to know what has occurred in the political world, whether the states that have had their elections have gone for Clay & Frelinghuysen or not, & the present prospects of the parties. But of this and of everything interesting in the progress of science, Literature, Commerce, & Religion, both in our own country & in the whole civilized world we must be content to remain ignorant a long time. Of our friends too, their health & welfare, the execution of their plans of voyages & travels, of the churches & ministers of our City, especially of the event of the sickness Mr. Boies whom we left

to all human appearances at the point of death, of the result of the Town election on the Grammar School, of the continuance or departure of Mr. Demond my successor, of the Teachers in the other schools, of all the numerous variety of domestic & family occurrences, of marriages, births, sickness & deaths, of all these and of countless other things in a greater or less degree interesting to our feelings, we must also be satisfied to remain entirely ignorant.  We are now separated from home by a distance of more than three thousand miles & we are increasing that distance at the rate of nearly two hundred miles per day. It is however a source of consolation to know that no increase of distance, nor even infinite space itself can in the least retard or obstruct the delightful mental communion of mutual friends. By imagination we can thus instantly annihilate distance & could we but transfer our bodily senses with our thoughts, as the advocates of mesmerism pretend to do, our intercourse consisting no longer of mere visions of fancy, would assume the character of actual reality.  As from time to time my thoughts suddenly recur to friends at home. I am forcibly reminded of the beautiful lines of Cowper - "How fleet is a thought of the mind, 
compared with the speed of its flight, 
The tempest itself lags behind, 
And the swift winged arrows of light,,

With these excursions of fancy, with conversation, with singing & reading & study when my feelings permit I contrive to relieve the tedium of the voyage. One of our invalids has so far recovered as to be on duty, during his watch, the other two seem to be very little if any better. Rodgers has contrived to prolong the injurious effects of liquor upon his system by means of other stimulants such as Laudanum Opium &c. His limbs are so affected with inflammatory rheumatism as to confine him to his bed. Church the other of the two, says that he has has one or two instances of hemorrhage, as he supposes from the lungs within a day or two past. His stomach also continues very weak so as to be unable to digest any but the simplest food. His sleep too is very bad, being unusually short and unrefreshing. Still he does not seem to have the countenance of a consumptive man, or at least not of a confirmed victim of that disease & I tell him to keep as much possible in the open air, endeavor to regain his appetite & the vigor & tone of his stomach & he will entirely recover -

Rose this morning at 4 o. clock - found the captain & men on the lookout for the Island of St. Anthony one of the Cape Verdes which according to our calculations yesterday we expected to see about 5 o clock. At that very time the Capt and first mate both discovered what they judged to be land though at first it had very much the appearance of a cloud. Day light however soon removed all doubt & revealed to us the veritable island of his saintship, looming up from a quarter to half a mile high, to appearance, composed almost entirely of naked rock & sand and presenting to the eye of the beholder a prospect as dismal barren & uninviting as any Catholic monk or Saint could desire.  We sailed along the west side of it about ten miles distant. I examined it with the spyglass but could not discover a single spot of green composed either of trees or grass & could not conjecture how a single individual could find sustenance upon it. As however we passed the southern point, I could perceive the Island extended several miles towards the east & that the land was less elevated. In that part therefore I supposed that portions of it might be capable of

						Saturday October 19th {1844/10/19}
Early this morning we made Brava another of the Cape Verde Islands. We approached it on the Western side, rounded the south west point & brought the ship to under lee of the land. About 10 o. clock A.M. accompanied the Captain & 2nd mate in going ashore. The sea was quite rough & the boat so violently tossed by the waves as to render me exceedingly dizzy. On landing & for some time after I was scarcely able to walk. We found on arriving a motley collection of between one & two hundred natives, composed of men and women & children extending along the shore in small groups all furnished with articles which they were eager to sell. These consisted of oranges, Lemons, bananas, Pumpkins, squashes, melons & sugar Cane. Very little of the fruit was yet ripe, & most of it appeared to be of inferior quality. Of live stock there were only a small number of hens & diminutive swine. Two ships had arrived before ours, viz. the H Thompson Capt Andrews from New London, & the La Fayette Capt Smith from New Bedford. The Henry T.  was clean. The other had taken fifteen barrels. The commanders were both on the shore endeavoring to traffick with the natives. They were greatly dissatisfied with the prices, & especially with the exorbitant duties upon the articles which they wished to exchange. These were no less 

[end of page log343_035.gif]

than $5 for a barrel of sperm oil & $1.50 for a bag of old bread. The shore of that part of the Island upon which we landed consisted almost entirely of an uninterrupted  chain of abrupt precipices & cliffs rising from the surface of the sea to a height varying from 70 or 80 to 150 or 200 feet. between these towering rock & the edge of the water there were in some places declivities some eight or ten rods in width & defiles leading back into the interior. It was upon one of these declivities that we landed. Stretched along the shore at short intervals, were six or eight low miserable huts with stone walls & thatched roofs. One of these was the Custom House. Here we found the Collector of the Port & Consul's agent - here the Capt entered the vessel & paid the customary Port Charges. In the present case, these were four dollars. The commander of the above mentioned ships that had arrived before us had each brought on shore a sick sailor to be discharged. The benefit of these & in accordance with the provisions of the law, they left $40 each in the hands of the agent to be sent to the consul at Porto Praya the capital of the group. The invalids also were sent

[end of page log343_036.gif]

to the same place to be under the care of the Consul until an opportunity occurred for their returning home. 
		After wandering along shore a short time & taking a cursory survey of the natives & their commodities I returned to one of the huts procured pen & ink & wrote to my friends. Opportunities for forwarding letters from these Islands to the U. States are comparatively rare but I thought it best to avail myself in the present instance of a mere chance. The room in which I wrote served at least for the time the fivefold purpose of grog shop, counting room, Hospital, pig-sty & Hen coop.  The pigs, however were only occasional visitors & the hens were kept there temporarily for sale. Whilst engaged in writing the Capt called & informed me that two of our boat's crew viz. Christopher Chapman & John Pera had run away. He stated also that the agent had sent a man in search of them with the view of apprehending them before the ship should be ready to sail, but that he should not wait in case they were not found. Having dispatched my letters and deposited them in the Custom house, in charge of the Collector.

[end of page log343_037.gif]

He informed me that a Packet sails from Brava to Porto Praya every 3 or 4 days and that our letters will be sent there to morrow afternoon. 
				The Capt in the meantime had purchased 13 pigs & small hogs & 8 hens at an expense of nearly $20, being about equal in price to the same animals at home. Their fruit was more reasonable. Very large bunches of bananas could be procured for 25 cents. Oranges for 6 or 8 cents a dozen & lemons for a less price. After purchasing a quantity of these I wrote two certificates for the agent (he not being able to write English, though speaking it intelligibly) importing that the had made diligent search for the runaway seamen, but had not been able to find them. There he signed in the name of the Consul & gave them to Capt Green as an indemnity against loss for not restoring these men to the port form which we sailed. Capt G. having made arrangements for taking two of the natives as substitutes for the deserters the agent demanded the sum of $4 each for the privilege in accordance with the laws of the Islands. This the Capt declined paying. We then started for the ship with our supplies of fruit & fowls, the

[end of page log343_038.gif]

swine having been previously sent aboard.  The men whom we had engaged with a company of their friends immediately ran along the shore a distance of a quarter of a mile or more from the Custom House & stopped upon a projecting rock waiting the arrival of our boat. The sea being rough, it was dangerous approaching the rock & the Capt therefore beckoned the new recruits to plunge in & swim to the boat. This they did without the least hesitation &  soon were alongside & helped aboard. Both had claimed to be skillful rowers. To test the truth of their assertions they were required immediately to ply the oar - one of them who had made great pretensions appearing very  awkward, was ordered instantly to swim ashore - This done, the Capt made signs for another to come who knew how to handle the oar. Accordingly another plunged in & was soon aboard. This one passing the ordeal of trial we started again for the ship with our boat's crew now complete. the Capt having thus practiced quite a novel and ludicrous method of shipping seamen. In this manner the deficiency occasioned by the elopement of the two renegades was supplied and the expense of paying eight dollars for 

[end of page log343_039.gif]

the privilege, avoided. The men thus shipped know not the lay they are to receive & they came on board without chest or trunk or any other clothing than the hat shirt and trousers they happened to be wearing when we first saw them. They had no opportunity to return & bid adieu to their friends & one of them at least had not the remotest thought of leaving home an instant before he plunged fearlessly into the ocean & by that single act separated himself from his kindred & native land a long but an unknown period of time. The facility & promptness with which the sons of these Islanders there abandon their sea-girt homes can scarcely find their equal in any other part of the world. Even the daring spirit of emigration so characteristic of our own far farmed Yankee land must here yield the palm.
			The ship being several miles from shore & the sea running very high, I was exceedingly sick whilst returning & my stomach so exhausted by violent retching & vomiting as to be scarcely able to bear the simplest kind of gruel. Having reached our vessel between 5 & 6 o. clock P.M. we immediately set sail & are now steering

The atmosphere as we approach the equatorial region of rains & calms, begins to assume a more hazy & misty appearance than it had north of the Tropic. Whether this is only occasional I cannot say, though I suppose not. As in almost every thing else pertaining to a sea life thus far I have been agreeably disappointed, so I  expect to be in respect to the so much talked of heat & rains & calms of the Equinoctial. Yesterday afternoon we spoke the Levant

a whaling ship from Sag harbor. Capt'n Havens. he soon after at the invitation of Captain G. cam on board & remained and took tea with us. He is bound to the North West Coast by the way of Cape Horn with the view of fishing on the coast of Chili for Sperm Whales. He felicitates himself upon having one of the tidiest & best cooks that ever sailed the ocean. We can hardly avoid envying him the acquisition. To be under the necessity for months in succession of receiving one's food from the hands of a cook whose known habits & personal appearance are sufficient almost to induce an individual with a keen appetite to endure a long fast rather than eat is to day the very least, a serious evil. butt unfortunately, such is our case. This however is almost the only thing in any voyage thus far, in which I have been unpleasantly disappointed. I think therefore I have no reason to complain of my  lot, but on the contrary much reason to be grateful. This afternoon , according to an arrangement made last evening with Capt Havens, Capt G. & myself took tea on board of the Levant - The ship George from New Bedford, Swift Master, happening to be near, the Capt also joined us, so that we had quite a pleasant "gam,, as the whalemen style such a party. These vessels had taken

no oil & one of them had not even seen a whale except a solitary Finback. The G. too  is bound to the N. West by way of Cape Horn. Capt swift informed us that he had on board his vessel a large volume containing the voyages of several of the most distinguished navigators that have explored the North Pacific. It also contained maps or charts of all the principal bays together with accounts of the natives along the coasts, their habits customs &c.  The charts of the principal whaling bays he very politely offered to copy himself & present to Capt G. if he would come on board his vessel to morrow afternoon - This the Capt intends to do if the weather permits.  We found every thing on board the Levant in excellent order. The cool's galley appeared very neat & well supplied with cooking utensils, our own sadly contrasting with it in both these respects. The Capt treated us with excellent Lemonade & we afterward sat down to a very good supper prepared in good style. We have just returned to our ship & are sorry to lean from the mate that during our absence he discovered the fore topmast Tressel Trees to be broken.

Captain G. and part of the officers & crew have been occupied for the most of the day, in endeavoring to support the broken Tressel Trees. They have so secured the parts by means of chains & ropes, that they think they will hold for some months. They have also discovered that the foremast is decayed near one of the cheeks or hounds. The hound itself, and also one of the foremast Tressle trees are somewhat decayed. The decayed parts they have cut & chiseled out & filled up the cavities with salt. It is unfortunate that these defects were not discovered at home, as the expenses of repairs in foreign ports are generally exorbitantly high - Towards evening Captn G. spoke the Kingston Capt Elles from Fair haven & took supper on board of her in company with Capt Swift of the George. After tea he went on board of the G & obtained the charts which the Capt promised him yesterday - He also obtained the schedule of a voyage of a N.Bd Whaler that took 2600 Bls in one season on the N.W. and other valuable information

He represents the Dr. as having been a great & good man & as having been eminently instrumental in promoting revivals of religion and in bringing forward the great benevolent enterprises of the present day. The honor of originating these enterprises or rather the societies by which they have been so signally advance is universally conceded to Samuel J. Mills; but in presenting their claims to Pastors & churches & in advocating measures & efforts essential to their success Dr. G. bore a conspicuous part. In turning the tide of Unitarianism in Boston & in laying the foundation for the establishment of the numerous orthodox churches now flourishing in that city he did more perhaps than any other man. In restoring prosperity & efficiency to Williams College, in endowing it with funds, erecting its edifice, & in securing for it public confidence & patronage, he also stands preeminent. As an eloquent & popular Preacher in the time during which he was engaged in the ministry he had but few equals. With these great & distinguished excellence, he had of course his faults.

Have been somewhat surprised and agreeably disappointed thus far in finding the weather cool & comfortable since entering the region of the tropics. The thermometer in the shade has scarcely exceeded eighty degrees & this temperature relieved as it has been by the sea - breeze, has not been in the least uncomfortable. The officers however inform me that when it is clear & calm for any considerable length of time, when near the line, the heat is generally oppressive, although at a great distance from land.
			During several nights past have watched for the North Star, but have been unable to see it in consequence of clouds near the horizon. The last time I noticed it was in latitude 8øÿNorth. The mates sure me they have observed it as low as 3ø North. I believe it is never visible  on the line on account of the mist always hanging above the horizon. the stars have so changed their positions as we have approached the Equator as to give the heavens a very unusual appearance. Those constellations which I have been accustomed to see in the North are for the most part invisible, and these which at home are in the Zenith or seen in the South appear now far to the north.

							Since the severe squall mentioned under date of Oct 29th {1844/10/29} we have had for the greater part of the time, steady, light winds from the S.S.E. varying occasionally a point or two from that direction. These must be the South East Trades As it is not unusual to meet them in that latitude being about 4ø North. They have driven us farther West than we could have wished. Navigators bound into the Southern Ocean make it a point to cross the line as far to the East as possible in order to avoid contact with the eastern portion of South America. The South East Trades propel vessels so far to the West after crossing the Equator as to render this precaution necessary. It is on this account better to cross in about 20ø W Long. We however shall not probably be able to effect it under 25ø or 26ø West Longitude.

Of all creatures, man seem least affected by the reception of favors, and least susceptible of emotions of gratitude.

The eastern point of South America is now only 9ø West of us, & 1/2 ø South; yet if the trades bear Easterly as far as usual we shall have no difficulty in passing it. 
		last evening some of our fresh hands learning that we were about to cross the line enquired of the steward if he thought we should be able to see it. Their inexperience & credulity had, as it appears been imposed upon by the old seamen until they had been indicated to believe that the thing was really possible. It is however no slight reflection both upon their education & discernment that they could suffer themselves to be thus duped. I am happy to learn from Captain G. that since he has had charge of a vessel he has entirely prohibited all those cruel & foolish tricks that are sometimes played upon novice on first passing the Equator. I allude to the

practice of initiating them into the mysteries of old Neptune, by compelling them to drink large quantities of salt water; blindfolding them & shaving with an iron hoop with lather of slush & tar; sending them aloft to look out for the line; plunging them into casks of water, or if the weather permit by dragging them along side with a rope around their waist. Thus & similar fooleries are still practiced, to some extent on board many ships. though in general the custom is going into disuse & will doubtless soon be entirely abandoned.

together with the inability to do any thing ourselves seem greatly to have cooled the zeal of those amongst us who were warm politicians when at home. I have thought of proposing to have the ballot box circulated amongst the crew, but in consequence of the little interest manifested by the Captain and officers, have concluded to relinquish the purpose.

The Capt possesses an old but nicely constructed English instrument & prides himself upon his superior tact in using it, and apparently with justice. This afternoon have assisted the Capt in adjusting & correcting the rate of one of our chronometers, which we found considerably out of the way on approaching St Anthony a few days since.

This our officers inform me is invariable the case in the regions. Our course to day has been south West by South. Two sails in sight this afternoon & evening.

Have spent the greater part of the day in perusing tracts and in reading. Mr. Barnes excellent commentary on Hebrews. never before have my feelings been so deeply impressed with the exalted rank & character of our blessed Savior & his infinite condescension in effecting the redemption of our sin ruined race. I was also particularly interested in his remarks respecting the agency of angels in accomplishing this great work. To the heart of the desponding Christian encompassed with difficulties & trials, how cheering is the fact that these blessed spirits "with superior intelligence benevolence & power,, are ever present to lend their heavenly aid. What a dignity is thus conferred upon 

[end of page log343_059.gif]

The humble followers of Christ, to be always placed under the guardian care & protection of these angelic Beings.  That this is the doctrine of the Bible may be abundantly proved by numerous facts & statements recorded upon its sacred pages. Angels are there represented as rejoicing over the conversion of a single sinner that repenteth. The little ones composing Christ's little flock on earth are expressly assured by the savior himself that their angels are always standing before the throne of our Father in Heaven. For what other purpose but to receive their commission to fly on errands of mercy to those thus committed to their care? "Are they not all ministering spirits sent forth to minister unto them who shall be hers of salvation,,?- An innumerable company of the heavenly host sang jubilee over the plains of Bethlehem on account of the birth of Christ to the consequent redemption of man. Glory to God, peace on earth & good will to man were the united themes of their song. How lively how deep must be their interest in our welfare, where at the same breath they celebrate the praised of Jehovah in the highest & congratulate our race upon the prospect of pardon & reconciliation to be purchased by the voluntary humiliation & suffering of the new born Redeemer --- 
Angels too repeatedly came to succor the Man

Christ Jesus & will they not for the same reason succor his needy children? they came to comfort & strengthen the weak, to instruct & enlighten the ignorant, to deliver the opprest, to rescue the prisoner, and to console the afflicted under the old dispensation & at the commencement of the new and why should they not continue the same friendly offices still? They came to convey the soul of the dying Lazarus to Abraham's bosom, & may not dying Christians now expect they will perform the same kind act for them? The necessity with us remaining the same, the benevolence of God & of angels remaining the same, is it not almost infidel to doubt that their acts of mercy will still continue the same? The Poet in the following beautiful lines takes this for granted & surely they contain nothing of poetic license by only sober scripture truth. 

	"And is there care in heaven? and is there love
	In heavenly spirits to these creatures base,
	That may compassion of their evil move?
	There is; - else much more wretched were the case
	Of men than beasts; But O! The exceeding grace
	Of Highest God that loves his creatures so, 
	and all his works with mercy doth embrace,
	That blessed angels he sends to and fro,
	To serve to wicked man to serve his wicked foe!

[end of page log343_061.gif]

	"How oft do they their silver bowers leave,
	To come to succor us that succor want!
	How oft do they with golden pinions cleave
	The yielding skies like flying pursuivant
	Against foul fiends to aid us militant!
	They for us fight, they watch and duly ward
	And their bright squadrons round about us plant;
	And all for love and nothing for reward;
	O why should heavenly God to men have such regard,,
(Quoted by Mr. Barnes from Spenser's . F.Q. B.II. Canto VIII. 1.2.)
But if in view of the fact that angels are thus commissioned to aid us in our times of need we have reason to admire the "exceeding grace of Highest God,, and wonder that he "should have such  regard to man,, how much higher reason have we for wonder and admiration in view of the fact that he has sent his only Son the second Person of the blessed Trinity, the Brightness of his glory and the express Image of himself to purchase our salvation by his death? Well may we unite with the Apostle in ascription of highest praise for the exceeding richness of God's grace in the unspeakable gift (as he terms it) & ever thank him who hath thus made us meet to  be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light, delivering us from the power of darkness and translating us into his kingdom. Surely the inference of the same apostle is also first that with him he will

Whilst conversing this afternoon, with Captain G. upon the character of Christ & especially upon his incarnation he remarked that he always

[end of page log343_063.gif]

felt that he should have entered the world in some other manner than that of being born of woman. He afterward alluded to the statements of Jews & infidels respecting the character of Mary the mother of Jesus & seemed to think that although these charges were false, yet it was humiliating if not degrading for a divine being to be subjected to all the unpleasant infirmities of human infancy. After answering his objections in the best way that I could I turned to the closing versed of the 2nd Chapter of Hebrews & commencing with the 14th verse read to the close. I afterward read the excellent remarks of Mr. Barnes in commenting upon those verses, proving as it appeared to me in the most satisfactory manner the wonderful propriety of our Savior's  thus assuming human nature. It was thus and only by thus being made like unto his brethren that he could be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God to make reconciliation for the sins of the people. It was by thus suffering in human nature, tempted in all points as we are that he could also best sympathize with & succor us in our temptations. We know it is a principle of humanity that in order to be fully qualified to sympathize either in the joys or sorrows of other we must have been in

[end of page log343_064.gif]

 similar situations & have experienced similar trials ourselves. It is an old rule of rhetoric that a speaker must first weep himself before he can expect others to weep.


The same thought is this beautifully expressed by Dido in the 1st Book of the Aeneid. 
	"Me quoque per mullos similis fortuna labores 
	Tactatam, hae demum voluit consistere terra.
	Non ignana mali miseris succurrere disco.,,
					AEn. I. 628

	"For I myself like you have been distressed.
	Till heaven afforded me this place of rest,
	Like you an alien in a land unknown,
	I learn to pity, worse so like my own.,, 
It was therefore fitting that the Great High Priest the Mediator, the Intercessor, the Savior of men, show thus be qualified to enter into our joys & lessons - It is thus that
	"Touched with a sympathy within
	He knows our feeble frame
	he knows what sore temptations mean
	For he has felt the same.,,
There was also a peculiar propriety in his being born of woman - She had been first in the transgression, had had the principal agency in the introduction of sin & death into the

[end of page log343_065.gif]

world & had done it through the deception of Satan that had the power of death;  it was therefore singularly just & proper that she should also be the principal agent in introducing the messiah. The great propriatory sacrifice for sin the conqueror of death, & the destroyer of the Devil. God also had promised this honor to that sex in the declaration that the seed of the woman should bruise the serpent's head - Thus Milton represents Michael as explaining the passage to Adam.
	"Whom the gentlest Jesus call who shall quell
	The adversary serpent and bring back
	Through the world wilderness long wandered man
	Safe to eternal Paradise of rest. 
	.................................the like shall sing

Our fine weather & fresh Trade Winds still continue. have been philosophizing to day upon the cause of our having constantly either clouds or a smoky hazy atmosphere near the horizon whilst generally there are thin white clouds scattered at considerable intervals over the firmament. I have consulted no writer on meteorology upon the subject & know not whether any explanation has been attempted. Indeed I know not whether I ought to rely upon my own limited observation & the statements of our Officers (some of whom have been at sea twelve or fourteen years) as evidence of the uniformity of the fact. But assuming this to be the case I will here record the results of my own reflections subject of

[end of page log343_070.gif]

course to be changed or modified by future observation or investigation. It is I believe an admitted aft that whenever the wind blows steadily for any considerable length of time in one direction near the surface of the earth there is always an upper current blowing in the opposite direction. These currents  of course are of different temperature. Upon the borders of these is the region of clouds & mists - The warm atmosphere of the lower stratum uniting with the cold of the upper moisture is constantly given out and a portion of the air at this elevation is uniformly more or less misty. In accordance with the principle of perspective the observer in looking overhead, in in the vicinity of the zenith might not notice these misty appearances, as he then looks directly through only a think portion; but as his eye approaches the horizon the numbers of strata through which he looks is very greatly increased & of course the misty & cloudy appearance will increase in the same proportion. This seems to correspond with the fact. This cause in this case being uniform the phenomenon with also be uniform. The vision is thus intercepted by clouds & mists near the horizon for the same reason that the sight of an observer is obstructed in looking obliquely at a row of trees or posts

[end of page log343_071.gif]

though it is scarcely obstructed at all in looking perpendicularly. The trade winds blow constantly wither form the N.E. or S.E. according to their position in respect to the Equator; The upper currents blowing with equal uniformity in the opposite direction. A fact in evidence of this I have witnessed today viz. clouds flying near the surface toward the N.W. whilst higher up thin hazy clouds were proceeding in a S.E. course. This being generally the case within the Tropics, a constant cause is thus afforded for the supposed effect above described. These effects will however be varied by the causes which produce variations in the trades - The trades sometimes change their direction several points, sometimes blow with  considerable impetuosity at others subside into a calm, sometimes are attended with clouds & rain, though for the most part the weather is clear - sometimes comes in irregular bursts & squalls though generally they blow with great uniformity in respect to velocity. Of course the clearness or obscurity of the atmosphere near the horizon will also vary to some extent with these other variation, whilst the general fact remains the same.

This forenoon we had squalls accompanied with rain. A little before noon it broke away so as to enable us to obtain an altitude of the sun & work out latitude. Found ourselves  very nearly under the sun our persons at noon scarcely casting any shadow at all. In sweeping with the quadrant, found the altitude least at the north our latitude of course being greater than the declination. Our zenith distance accordingly changes its direction & instead of being north as it has been since leaving home it becomes south & the sun bears north. In calculating the Latitude we now add the zenith distance & declination instead of subtracting the less from the greater of them as we have hitherto done - In conversing with one of the crew a few evenings since, he related the following fact which occurred on board a whaling

[end of page log343_073.gif]

vessel in which he sailed a year or two since. They were on the voyage home from Ferdinand Noronha a small island off the coast of Brazil in 4 øÿS Latitude. The vessel belonged in Provincetown on Cape Cod & was commanded by Captn Small. She has cruised during the summer for sperm off the West coast of Africa, South of the line. Thence they sailed to Noronha, which they left on the 11th of September 1843 {1843/09/11}bound to Massachusetts. They crossed the line on the 14th {1843/09/14} after which they had calms & made but very little progress until after the equinox on the 22nd {1843/09/22}. Capt S. having been south of the line whilst the sun was north. had of course a south zenith distance & a north declination & in obtaining his latitude had taken the difference between them. But not understanding the subject, although he supposed he must add them after the 22nd of September {1843/09/22} & accordingly did so. His ideas had probably become confused by the changes that had occurred very nearly at the same time. He had crossed the line thus changing his latitude, he had passed north of the line thus changing the direction of his zenith Distance, & the sun had crossed the line thus changing its declination. At all events after the 22nd he commenced & continued to add his declination & zenith distance in calculating

[end of page log343_074.gif]

his latitude. The consequence was that he mad progress homeward in his Log book much more rapidly than he did in fact. The first thing however that troubled him was his Longitude. His latitude being too great affected his calculations for finding the ship's time, making that too small & of course his longitude too great. At length after a great deal of trouble with his chronometer. he concluded the instrument was very inaccurate & therefore entirely abandoned its use. According to his calculations it place them as far west as Lake Ontario - Not knowing how to work a Lunar, he was entirely unable to find out where he was - At last he asked the assistance of his mates & time of his crew who had given little attention to Navigation, but they could afford him no relief. Supposing however their latitude correct they continued to sail North Westerly, keeping a sharp look out for land. Thus he kept on until his calculations placed him in 44ø 11' N or more than 2 degrees north of his place of destination. He then changed his course and was steering South West for Cape Cod light when it occurred to him that he had mad a mistake in thus adding instead of subtracting the declination. this discovery solved the whole mystery. at the time it was made 

[end of page log343_075.gif]

he was actually in 29ø north & was heading direct for Bahama Banks. The intense anxiety of the crew occasioned by their total ignorance of their situation was now removed. To add to their distress during this season of gloomy doubt they had encountered a storm which had carried away all their topmasts; & they had also been upon short allowance both in water and provisions. However in a few days after getting upon their right course & repairing their broken masts they were further relieved by speaking a vessel which furnished them with supplies in due time after undergoing much suffering & incurring great danger from their own & their officers' ignorance of navigation, they arrived at home in safety. The name of the barque in which the above occurred is the Spartan. She still sails from T. After relating the substance of this account to our officers, Capt G. mentioned an instance of a similar mistake. An individual having the charge of a vessel, added in this manner for some time, when he should have taken the difference of the declination and Zenith Distance. But finding his calculations gave him greater headway than the light wind he was then having could possibly

[end of page log343_076.gif]

do, he was led to suspect discover and correct the error before it occasioned any mischief. Mr. Watrous the First Mate, also related the case of a similar blunder committed by a man now master of a whaling ship out of New London. In this instance however it was immediately corrected by comparing the work with that of another person who had performed it accurately. Other cases of lamentable ignorance in Sea Captains have been related to me.

Thursday last our cook was taken suddenly ill with violent pains in the back. Being unable to perform his duty, the Capt appointed a colored man for his substitute. After a trial of one or two meals, it appearing that he knew nothing of the business, he was summarily ejected from office & his place supplied by another. I am sure that if ship owners and agents realized how much waste of provision, how much of unpleasant feeling, how much repining (to say

nothing of oaths & excoriations) are occasioned by having a diseased filthy & ignorant cook, they would be specially careful to ship a skillful & tidy man for that important office. Certainly if they were under the necessity of living for a single week in the style that some crews live for years, they would never again be instrumental in consigning their fellow being to such privations & sufferings. if they possessed any thing of the spirit which prompts men to "do unto others as they would have others do unto them.,, Seldom does a day pass in which I am not compelled to listed to complaints respecting our food. As to myself I have as little to say as possible. I would most gladly induce all to submit patiently to their lot & be grateful for their daily food, let it be cooked as it may. For my own part, if it be not poisoned I can eat it with contented & cheerful feelings. But it is painful to see others dissatisfied & to hear details of culinary operation so destitute of cleanliness as to render it improper to record them.

Since last evening we have had almost constant rain with fresh wind from the N.E. Our S.E. trade, as we have progressed southward seems gradually to have changed its course to the Northward, until now we are in the midst of a chilly N.E. rainstorm, very similar to a genuine New England North Easter. 
		I had written thus far this afternoon & having laid aside my pen for a few moments was about resuming it again when my attention was suddenly aroused by a noise on deck, followed instantly by the shrill, earnest & rapid commands of Captain G. "Hard down your wheel, hard down your helm, brace up the mizzen top-sail, haul out the spanker, brace up the foretopsail & haul up the mainsail.,, These orders were given with that tone of voice which indicated wither imminent & instant danger, or something of great importance at stake - I rushed from my stateroom immediately on deck & found the whole crew running with all possible dispatch to the designated ropes. The uncommon solemnity depicted upon the countenance of the officers & sailors & the unusual energy & promptness with which orders were obeyed

[end of page log343_083.gif]

increased my apprehension of impending peril. Not having learned the cause of these sudden movement my first impressions were that we were encountering a vessel, or running upon an unknown rock or shoal, but upon enquiring, as soon as possible, of one of the men what is the matter, I received for an answer "a man overboard,, . Running instantly upon the poop deck I endeavored to get sight of the individual; but in vain; the sea was quite rough, the wind blowing strong accompanied with rain & fog & the vessel making headway at the rate of eight or nine knots an hour. In a few moments the ship being brought to, the Captain's boat was lowered & Mr Watrous the First Mate & five men put off in hope of rescuing their unfortunate shipmate from a watery grave. After rowing near the wake of the vessel until it was difficult to see the boat from the ship, the Captain ordered colors raised as a signal for their return. There began to be the danger of loosing the whole boats crew, if they should continues the search any longer. After an absence of from half to three fourths of an hour they were then compelled to relinquish further seeking & come back with the melancholy tiding that he could not be found. 

[end of page log343_084.gif]

the individual lost was a colored seaman from Colchester Conn, a young, healthy, & athletic man about twenty two years of age. His name was Richard Francis. Mr. Ransom one of our Boatsteerers, who has know him from a boy, represents him as belonging to a respectable colored family residing near Newton's Pond in Colchester. he thinks his parents are living, or at least that his father is. He also states that for about four years past, Richard had lived with Deacon Newton, of the Revd Mr. Arnold's Church in that place. This was his first & as it has proved his last voyage at sea. In speaking of his character this evening Mr. Watrous remarked that he was as good a seaman as any one on board among the fresh hands; that he was "handy obedient & peaceable,,.
	The foretop gallant sail having been cleaned up, he and Dan Dodge were sent up about 4 o. clock this afternoon to furl it. He went out on the yard upon the windward side & called upon dodge to pull hard upon the sail. At that moment the wind blew it against him in such a manner as to knock him backwards off the yard and the vessel rolling far to the windward at the same time, he was thrown into the sea some fifteen or twenty feet from the sip, striking with 

[end of page log343_085.gif]

his side upon the surface. It is supposed that he was hurt by the fall, as he was heard to halloo for help but once or twice, and appeared to find it very difficult to keep upon the surface, though he is believed to have been a good swimmer. As the stern of the ship passed him he was heard to cry from the steerage windows & was seen with his head under water struggling to reach the surface. The Captain also saw him when about two or three ship lengths off, throwing his arms out of the water over his head. These movements were more similar to the convulsive efforts of a drowning man, than to those of a person in the act of swimming. The boat having been hauled up and properly secured, the ship again resumed her course, & the men returned to their several posts with feelings of deep regret at the loss of their comrade. Though with the consolation of having done all that was possible for his preservation. The Captain remarked at the tea table, that if Major Williams himself, (one of the principal owners of the ship) had been in a similar situation he could have done more more to save him. He having lived so long in a pious family I for a time indulged the hope that he might have been a Christian, but on enquiring 

[end of page log343_086.gif]

of Dodge I regret to learn that whatever may have been his former character whilst on board he has been habitually profane, and that in ascending the rigging just before his fall he had given utterance to a variety of oaths and curses, having almost literally left the world with the prayer of the swearer upon his lips. It was only on Thursday  last that being much displeased because the Captain had put him into the galley in place of our sick cook, he gave vent to his wrath in a volley of awful oaths & curses. He cursed the ship & everything on board; he wished that she might sink and himself and all on board be drowned & be damned in hell. One of his shipmates replied that id he wished to be drowned so much, he could easily throw himself overboard, & spare the rest of the crew who would doubtless prefer to live.

The rain still continues & the wind since dark seems to have increased. our light sails were all taken in early in the evening & the topsail close reefed. At this moment (1/2 past 2) there is a very  heavy swell & the vessel pitches & rolls exceedingly. We are making rapid progress southward, and our climate is changing with our latitude. Our season corresponds to the middle of May at home. Our days are rapidly increasing in length being affected both by the increase of declination and latitude. The thermometer to day has stood at 68ø Morning, noon & night. The Barometer has gradually sunk from 29.7 inches to 29.56. The wind N.E. throughout the day - nothing in sight.

Last night the vessel rolled so violently as almost to throw me out of my birth. WE have no experienced so much of a storm since leaving home, & with the exception of the two or three days following our departure we have not had so tremendous a swell. For a day or two after leaving Montauk we were unable to take our food at the table & obliged to sit down on the cabin floor with our dishes in our

[end of page log343_089.gif]

laps as the only means of preventing them from being broken. The captain remarked at the time that he did not recollect that he had ever encountered a worse sea in his life and that there must have been a severe storm just before we  came out. On peaking to the Kingston which sailed about a week before us, Capt Ellis informed us that he had very hard blow the day or two after he left, which continued for two or three days & that with difficulty his vessel escaped injury. Upon hearing this we thought it quite providential that we were delayed as we should probably have lost our topmasts in consequence of the imperfect condition of the rigging. 
							To day the storm has moderated & this afternoon the wind is light. The weather  has been cloudy & foggy with little rain. Broke away so as to enable us to compute our latitude & longitude with imperfect horizons, but now at evening still remains very foggy thermometer at 67ø above zero - Barometer has fallen to 25.4 inches - Wind during the greater part of the day N.W.

I saw for the first time this morning what the whalemen denominate Gonies communally called Albatrosses. In the course of the day several of them have been seen flying around the ship. This bird to appearance when on the wing is about the size of a goose - its body is white - Its wings brown broad & long. It has short legs with large webbed feet. Those seen to day were not sufficiently near to enable one to examine them minutely - Should I be fortunate enough to catch one as I hope to do I will give a more particular description of the species. Some time last night amidst the rolling of the vessel, the strap of the starboard foretop gallant backstay parted. Several of the crew have been occupied a considerable portion of the day in repairing it.

Two months to day since we sailed. one thirteenth of our original number have already left us, two by desertion and one by drowning. How long our present number will remain unbroken God only can determine. Our times are in his hand alone and the events of his providence are frequently reminding us that in disposing of them he acts according to his sovereign pleasure. It is the part of wisdom in us to profit by these admonitions & thus he prepared for the summons whenever he may deem it best to call us hence.

At day light this morning the Island of Tristan de Acunha was in sight though probably more than a hundred miles off. The weather has been pleasant but the air mild & agreeable and entirely free from the chilly feeling of yesterday - Winds during the forenoon very light & from the S.E. In the afternoon changed to the Westward. Employed to day in opening my trunks & airing my clothes, found they were getting mouldy & that they should have been opened before - Two vessels on our weather bow have been in sight all day- Capt G. has been observing them with his glass & he thinks one of them is the Pembroke from N. London Captn Tate. We have been steering for the island, where we shall stop to take some fresh fish if the weather will permit. It is less than 18 days since we crossed the line & now within a few hours sail of Tristan, if favored with a mind Evening delightful & sky beautiful, days lengthening rapidly- sufficiently light to read at 4 in the morning & 8 in the evening - Have made but little progress.

				Tuesday November 19th {1844/11/19}
Early this morning one of the vessels seen yesterday was near at hand - Capt G. set his signal & in a few moments Capt Tate of the barque Pembroke came aboard. he has experienced hard fortune, been out 16 months & obtained but 450 bls whale. He feel very desirous to fill his vessel & appears to have done every thing in his power to effect it. For months in succession he has not seen the spout of a whale. he has been cruising about the Islands here one or two months without any success. Appears melancholy in view of the prospect yet determined to do his utmost. In the forenoon whilst Capt G & T were having a social "gam,, I wrote to mother & Mr Havens. After dinner as the ship had approached within a few miles of the shore of Tristan a party sufficient to man two boats made preparations for a fishing excursion. The vessel being brought to I joined one of the boat's crew, & we put off for the shore - We secured our boat by making fast to the long strings of kelp which grows near the shore & floats upon the surface. We used pork for bait at first & afterwards portion of the fish we took. We caught

[end of page log343_095.gif]

in great abundance fish weighing from one to five lbs each. The largest part of those thus obtained were of a kind somewhat resembling our poggy in form though darker in color & of greater size. A few mackerel and one long thin fish, with large jaws & long sharp teeth called by the seamen Berricouta were taken. An animal called the crawfish very much resembling our lobster in appearance & size though without claws for holding & tearing its food, abounds in these waters. We caught only one of them on account of the roughness of the sea. When smooth, by simply opening a fish, securing it to your line & dropping it to the bottom, you may draw up four or five at a time they holding on to the fish as it rises slowly to the surface. The retain their hold with such firmness as will allow you to lift them into the boat where they are easily shaken off. After we had taken in all some five or six hundred fish on returning to the ship we found on board Capt Reed of the ship Candace 25 1/2 months out. he had been upon the North West Coast, but in consequence

[end of page log343_096.gif]

of insubordination among his crew had there captured but two whales, although finding them very abundant. The crew refused to preform duty or as least evaded it by every means in their power apparently with the express design of defeating the success of the voyage. At length by various means he has rid himself of all that started with him in the forecastle with the exception of two individuals. Has has now on board 1400 bls & intends not to return until he is full. Within a week he has taken two whales. He states that the crew had become offended with the first mates, and some of them in one instance attempted to throw him overboard. They pretended at the time that they were only in a frolic & really had no evil designs, that they were intoxicated &c. &c. Capt R. however seems confident that they were guilty & thinks their subsequent conduct in refusing to announce the appearance of whales & the boatsteerers neglecting to fasten a confirmation of his opinion. The Mate's boat crew afterward when even a mile of two from shore deserted the boat & escaped by swimming to the land. At least this is the statement as I understood it. He believes moreover that a considerable portion of the crew concerted a regular meeting

[end of page log343_097.gif]

with the intention of getting rid of the officers & taking possession of the ship, and that this plot has been devised early in the voyage & during its progress gradually matured. In respect to the manner in which he thought it to have been defeated, I did not learn. Such for substance is the representation of the Captain. The men of course will give an entirely different shade to the picture. On of the deserters who arrived at home in time to ship in the Morrison & now acts in the place of Rodgers as Boatsteerer, professes to be totally ignorant of any such plan. He alleges personal abuse from the mate as the only cause of his running away. 
				I have given a detailed account of these particulars, considering them a fair specimen of the difficulties with which whaling Captains are compelled to struggle on account of the reckless character of their crews. I am fully persuaded that whaling agents ought to be much more careful than they seem to be in respect to the men they ship. It is doubtless difficult if not impossible always to obtain good seamen, but still they might at least with proper care procure much better ones than they in may instances, do. This is

[end of page log343_098.gif]

certainly the fact if the statements of these officers contain anything of truth. One of them in reflecting upon the negligence of agents is this particular; expressed his belief that they would actually ship a dead man if by any contrivance he could be made to appear alive. I am aware that it is no easy matter for agents to obtain accurate information as to the character of the men they employ. They are obliged to rely mainly upon their own statements. In the cast of the apparently useless man now in the Morrison, if the fact could have been previously ascertained, they would not have been accepted. [begin mistake mark] Some E.G. that shipped as ordinary seamen and thus obtained a better lay, scarcely knew enough of a ship to distinguish the starboard from the larboard side, or the helm from the capstan, and now when only two months out, are not half as serviceable as some of the raw hands. They have been obliged also to receive instruction in steering & in the names & positions of the ropes in the same manner as the "green horns" [end mistake mark] Some of them were worn out inebriates, that seem incapable of exertion except under the influence of artificial stimulus. Some had been sick for months before they shipped. One has not done a day's work on board & in case he does not get well, he gets his passage to the

[end of page log343_099.gif]

Sandwich Islands, his outlay & forty dollars to pay his board there, out of the owners; and his other expenses there after the above sum is exhausted & his passage home, are paid by the U.S. Government. Capt Tate mentioned the case of a sick man who managed in this way repeatedly, for the sake of an easy living and making money. He shipped, obtained money &.C. in advance from the agents, was sick all the way to the Western Islands, left they by the Capt in the care of the Consul, sent back to the U.S. at the expense of the Government, and in less than a month after his arrival, as in New London where he shipped, again went through the same farce, was left again at the same Islands in care of the same consul. He however recognized him & threatened him with legal penalty if guilty of such conduct in future. he of course plead that he thought himself well when he shipped the 2nd time, though he was in reality sick. 
			Whist taking supper this evening in company with Capt Reed & Tate the Barque Iris of N. London Haynes Master came along side & spoke us. At the invitation of Capt. G  Capt H came on board & spent

[end of page log343_100.gif]

 two or three hours with us - Thus we had quite a party form home & enjoyed much pleasure in receiving and imparting information in regard to mutual friends & acquaintances - I was forcibly reminded of the mine in the favorite piece of musing entitled "Ship Ahoy,,. Though intended only to describe the speaking of a vessel & though the style of address in our case differed form the one these represented, yet the sentiments of the song are appropriate to our circumstances.
	"When o'er the silent seas alone
	For days and nights we've cheerless gone,

	Some sunny morn a sail to meet.
	Sparkling on deck is every eye

	But soon, too soon, we part in pain

The Iris has been out for months but is clean & under the necessity of procuring lamp oil form the Candace. These vessels had spoken several ship that sailed before us & we learned many particulars respecting their officers & crews - I was particularly gratified to hear from Capt Reed that he spoke the barque Dove about 3 weeks since that the Capt & crew were well that Capt D. was much pleased with his men, that two or three of them had hopefully become pious since sailing &c. &c. That he also had sent home about 70 barrels of sperm oil & had taken at least one whale since. 
		There were other things respecting one or two of our New London Captains & their deportment at this Island, that were painful to hear - Captains F & S. of the Bengal and the Jason were represented to have been intoxicated  much of the time whilst stopping here. At Brava also we were informed that Capt S. quarreled & fought with the natives & in the fray was very severely beaten & bruised himself. This is too often the way in which our enlightened & Christian country is represented in foreign ports by the conduct of our seamen.

About 10 o. clock this morning as Capt G. was walking upon the poop deck he discovered a large school of sperm whales some three miles distant. As soon as the vessel could be put into a proper position, the boats were lowered & pursuit made. The whales were numerous but very shy & going rapidly to the Windward - After a long 

[end of page log343_103.gif]

pull the Capt & 2nd mate both got fast-  With very great difficulty & after being towed entirely out of sight of the ship Capt G. succeeded in killing his, but the mate's was lost by the drawing of the iron. The three boats of the mates then took the dead whale in tow & the Capt returned to the ship. he was greatly offended with Byrne the ship keeper for not tacking ship & making as much as possible for the boats. He then endeavored to make progress in that direction but has been prevented from accomplishing much y the lightness of the winds & calms. The boats will therefore be obliged to tow the whale a distance of some ten or twelve miles. This, with the swell then upon the sea, will be exceedingly laborious. They have not got the whale along side as yet, and it is impossible to tell what distance they are from us, though their lights have been visible for some time. As it is near 10 o. clock at night I shall retire without making any longer to see the booty. The weather to day  has been pleasant. During the forenoon the wind was S.W. - This afternoon variable with alternate calms - Thermometer averaging 60ø - Barometer 29.75

					Thursday Nov 21st 1844 {1844/11/21}
Found all hands this morning engaged in preparing to "cut in,, the whale. Learn that the boats did not reach the ship until about midnight. Both officers & men are exceedingly tired & their limbs are very sore. They rowed about fourteen hours in succession without refreshment. Some of them were so much exhausted as to be unable to sleep during the short time they had their watch below. Much of this labor & suffering the Capt attributes to the carelessness & unfaithfulness of the ship-keeper. Had he tacked ship frequently & kept the boats in sight the distance necessary to tow would have been much less - Instead of this, however he continued four hours upon one tack & all their time was increasing instead of diminishing the distance from the boats. 
			But notwithstanding their exhaustion they are all hard at work this morning. The whale is somewhat larger than the one first taken by us - The operation in taking off the blubber is the same as in the former case. The animal is secured along the gangway. a staging is suspended over the dice at each end with ropes to prevent the cutter from falling. The Capt occupies one & the first mate the other - After cutting around

[end of page log343_105.gif]

and starting the first blanket of blubber, but before hoisting it on boar, the entire head which in the present instance is ten feet long & six & a half in diameter is severed form the body and deposited on deck & firmly secured. This is done by inserting a very large iron hook deep into the blubber near the end of the lower jaw. Where it is sufficiently tenacious to sustain the whole mass. This again is attached to a very strong tackle & fall connected with the windlass where a power adequate to raise it is easily applied. After this securing the head the, the blubber is rapidly stripped off in blankets & stowed away in the blubber room. The whole work was accomplished before breakfast, though in consequence the hour was delayed longer than usual.
				The next operation consists in cutting the blubber into what are termed horse pieces. These are portions from 10 to 18 inches long  & form 3 to 6 inches thick. These again are placed upon the mincing horse & there gut into this slices with a large knife called a mincing knife. The mincing horse (by the way) is simply a piece of pine plank placed across a large hogs head into which the slices fall. From

[end of page log343_106.gif]

This they are transferred to the try kettles where they are subjected to a heat sufficient to turn them to crisp & extract the whole of the oil. From the kettles the oil is bailed out into the cooler & thence is strained into the deck pot from which it is dipped into the casks. These after the oil has become entirely cool & settled as much as it will are again filled up & the hoops have been thoroughly driven, they are there stored in the hole. 
						The weather this forenoon has been pleasant, but the wind quite fresh from the N.W. with considerable swell. The ship however has not rolled much during the process of cutting in & the Captain thinks she will do well in this respect. It has been amusing to watch the operations of the numerous sea fowl which frequent these southern waters whilst the business of fleecing the whale has been going on a flock of more than forty albatrosses of the size of the largest domestic geese are swimming close around eagerly devouring with their huge bill every fragment of the blubber that happens to get loose. They seem to be very tame, approaching so near to the men as to be easily caught by the hand. They however have doubtless learned by experiences that the

[end of page log343_107.gif]

workers are too much engaged on such occasion to trouble them. A keen appetite also doubtless contributes much to embolden them as even the most timid animals are rendered courageous by hunger. Fixing a noose in the end of a fish line I dropped it over the head of one that was swimming by the side of the vessel & drew it on deck for the purpose of inspecting its formation more closely. It has very large webbed feet short & large legs, a body of the fore & size of a very large goose, a short tail, very long wings with three joints making three parts. The outer portions are furnished with quills somewhat longer & larger than those of a goose - When extended the winds from tip to tip will measure from eight to twelve feet. It walks  with difficulty & very awkwardly on deck rolling its body from side to side a great distance as it alternately lifts and puts down its sprawling feet. I observed nothing of the looseness alluded to by Olmstead in the folding of its wings. In the specimens we have had on board, they appeared as compact when folded as those of any other water fowl when standing erect it is a noble looking bird & exhibits its awkwardness only in its gait. It bill is about

[end of page log343_108.gif]

six inches long and 7/8 of an inch broad. The upper mandible is hooked & at the extremity turning downwards in such a manner as greatly to facilitate its tearing off the flesh of floating carcasses of dead fish or securing the living ones upon which it prays. On account of the very thick coat of feathers & down with which its body is covered its appearance is much larger than the actual size. But to my eye the description of Olmstead which represents its apparent size as immense, and twice that of a common goose is to day the least extravagant. The power of its bite is very great, as the marks upon mu flesh can fully testify, but  I doubt its sufficiency to sever a man's finger at a single effort as supposed by O. Of those around the vessel this morning the greater proton have white bodies with a few brown feathers near the tail upon the back their wings are white upon the lower surface but dark grey or brown upon the upper. Other are entirely brown - some are of a darkish gray mingled with white & others again are entirely black or dark brown - a very few are entirely white, both in wings and body. In rising from the surface like all sea foul it heads to the windward, spreads out its wings & runs along

[end of page log343_109.gif]

upon the sea some distance before it is able to lift itself above the water. But when once it fairly quits the dank,, & rising on its broad pennons "soars the air sublime,, or "skims over the hearing billows,, its movements are extremely easy & graceful. It seems to sail upon the atmosphere rather than fly & seldom finds it necessary to flap its wings in order to keep itself above. Its voice resembles a hoarse growling more than any thing else to which I can compare it. I have sometimes thought it was somewhat like the harshest notes of the common duck - Amongst the very numerous flock of sea birds that collected around the ship this morning there were many of a species called by whalemen the speckled haglet or cape pigeon. This is a very pretty bird, with variegated plumage and is about the size of a common tame pigeon. It has webbed feet & swims upon the surface as readily as the duck. For more than a week past they have followed the vessel in considerable numbers, instantly lighting & devouring whatever has been thrown overboard by the cook or steward. There were also many black divers promptly plunging into the sea & seizing the sinking fragments of the blubber or whale flesh. There were also

[end of page log343_110.gif]

others called by whalemen "stinkers,, 



These are about the size of a small hen & resemble them somewhat in form. They are of a dark brown color




There were in addition to these Mollymauks and sea gulls - these last are about the size & form of the killdee. Their color is white & their voice is similar to that of our shore gulls at home - In addition to these the was a dirty black looking bird called by whalemen Old Horse the size of a large Pelican.  To this whole horde of hungry harpies the carcass of the captured whale afford an ample repast. As soon as it was let loose from the ship and floated off a short distance, it was completely covered with the various species each greedily devouring its share & when miles off its place could easily be recognized by those already upon it, or by the clouds of new comers that were hovering around.
		The head of the sperm whale affords oil somewhat more valuable

[end of page log343_111.gif]

than the blubber on account of it containing  a greater proportion of spermaceti and is usually kept separate. after separating the blubber in the blubber room, the head is cut into three pieces. The upper part containing what the whalemen call the case is severed form the remainder by a section commencing near the spout hole in the end of the nose & extending to the other end of the head, deepening more & more as it extends further back. The case which is a large cavity in the upper part is next opened & pure spermaceti bailed out. In quantity, this varies according to the size & condition of the animal - the largest are said to contain ten or eleven barrels  & the smallest that are taken less than 1/2  a barrel. in the one we have taken the quantity is about a barrel. A large triangular piece having the whole front of the head for its base its sides running back to a vertex near the shoulder is next cut out & is denominated by whalemen the junk. It is apparently all pure fat, yet when cutting it up, laminae or divisions of considerable thickness are found which contain no oil. These are thrown overboard as useless. They somewhat resemble whit leather in animals & are called white horse by the whalemen. The third division contains

[end of page log343_112.gif]

the lower portion of the head the jaws and parts attached to them. the oily matter is carefully separated from the jaws & they are then thrown overboard as useless. In the present instance the teeth being small no attempt was made to preserve them - In the case of large animals this is sometimes done. 
		The head of a large sperm whale is so bulky & heavy that it is impossible to hoist it on board at once. It is therefore cut into into parts whilst lying alongside - the part containing the case is severed from the remainder, the case is opened and the spermaceti bailed out the fat portion preserved as are as possible and the remainder of the upper part permitted to float away and sick - the junk is then hoisted entire. 
		The spermaceti found in the case is liquid & appears to be of nearly the same consistency with the best purified oil sold in the shops at home  - It is of a whitish color when first taken from the animal but is rendered somewhat dark by being boiled - It is necessary to boil or scald it  in order to preserve it from putrefying

[end of page log343_113.gif]

If permitted to stand in a cask until it gets cold it becomes hard like tallow - What purpose this large reservoir of liquid fat subserves in the economy of the animal I am unable to say. I have repeatedly conversed with the Captn and officers, and also with several of the crew upon the subject, but they seem to have no idea whatever of its use to the whale - Its use to them they perfectly understand & with that they are entirely satisfied - It has occurred to me since learning that sperm whales are sometimes captured having little or nothing in their case that it might be a kind of "corps de reserve,, kept against exigency, and that the animal can draw upon this when deprived of food. The analogy of the Camel's hump & the fat of bears occurred to me as illustrations. It is known that the hump of the Camel during long journey in the desert in which he is scantily supplied with food diminishes in size, the fatty matter of which it is composed going to supply the waste of the system. So the fat of bears during the winter season sustains the life of

the animal. In reflecting upon the uses of the spermaceti in the case of the sperm whale. It occurred to me that it might be designated by the creator to subserve a similar purpose in the animal economy - But whether this conjecture has any foundation in fact I have no means of ascertaining.

The Island which we left on Tuesday are called by the whalemen Trustine Islands a corruption of Tristan De Acunha. Inaccessible & Nightingale. They are between 40 & 50 miles apart. The two latter are small & rocky & uninhabited. Tristan near which we took our fish is I suppose so called from Tristan De Cunha a somewhat distinguished navigator of the 16th century, who was probably the Discoverer. It is I should judge from appearances several miles in circumference at least 8 or 10 - Its height is said to be 1 1/2 miles & it any be seen in a clear day nearly

Rose a little after 4 & walked on deck for exercise. The wind during the night has changed to the North East, but is still quite moderate. The sky is partially covered with clouds & the atmosphere somewhat chilly. Thermometer at sunrise 57ø above zero. This temperature on shore would doubtless be very comfortable, but in consequence of the dampness of the sea air over one needs either warm clothing or vigorous action to avoid the disagreeable sensation of coldness. I resort to the latter method as more conducive to the improvement of my health.
			Have spent the day in reading Barnes' notes on Hebrews & Nelson's cause & cure of Infidelity. Was particularly pleased with his short chapter in answer to objections on the resurrection of the body. The principal one seems to be the impossibility of the fact, in consequence of the same particles of matter becoming in process of time portions of numerous other bodies. In reply he chows that identity as we use language does not require the constant existence of the same particles of matter. That in the course of life out bodies are entirely changed  a great number of times, that they are changing every moment, and yet we

[end of page log343_117.gif]

and the bible speak of them as the same. He refers to 1st Cor 15th "Sown in dishonor,, "raised in glory &.c.,, - God produces brilliant things from materials the very opposite - Thus diamond, from charcoal by different arrangement of matter - How Much of the present body enters the resurrection body is not revealed. Imaged forth by germination seed, wheat &c. portion decays, remains in the earth, another portion rises, forms the blade &c. - so in the resurrection - Of all the particles that have constituted the body from infancy to old age, God has not informed us which he will take to form the resurrection body - Every moment of our lives we have a different body, composed of materials brought from the very ends of the earth. The air the ocean the north, the south, the east, the west, all the elements of nature, unite in furnishing us with daily, hourly, constant supplies of matter for new bodies, & yet from birth to death both in the language of scripture & of common life, they are always the same. Why then strain & force the bible & its figurative allusions upon the subject of the resurrection, to teach a doctrine or rather mode of fulfilling a doctrine which is obviously absurd & impossible? The matter which

[end of page log343_118.gif]

shall compose my body at death may in the progress of time constitute a part of a million of other human bodies & yet the resurrection of the body as taught in the bible be true. In the body given me on that dread day when 
				"The angel of God Revealed in flaming fire shall appear blazing and lifting up his hand on high by him that lives forever, swear, that time shall be no more; and blowing the last trumpet proclaim, awake ye dead, arise the God of Judgment comes,,
				There will be something which will indicate its identity with the body I now possess. It will be as truly the same whether composed of the same particles or not, as the bodies of any men now living are the same they possessed a year or a month ago. The bible describes many great revolution & changes both physical & moral in highly figurative language - The conversion of a sinner E.G. is a new birth, a new creation a resurrection a transformation from gloomy darkness into marvelous light &c. &c. - So doubtless in the present instance the language is equally figurative. It describes a change of state. Then that have died exist no longer as disembodied spirits. A body suited in its qualities & capacities for the new state it is about to assume is prepared for

[end of page log343_119.gif]

the residence of the returning spirit, and there will exist such a relation between this last & the former corruptible one as shall fully justify the scripture terms that describe it as a resurrection of the body. Possibly Deo sunt omnia -

This morning the "Stormy winds,, do indeed blow & the "bellows tremendously swell,, but our stout ship with skillful guidance, seems to plough her foaming way in safety onward. It is pleasant at such a time though the pleasure is mingled with something of dread, to gaze upon the wild waves commotion and listen to old ocean's roar, as I have this morning done, for hours in succession. I can sympathize with the feeling described by Charlotte Elizabeth in her "personal Recollections,, which prompted her to beg for the privilege of being lashed to the mast that she might be able to behold and admire the awful sublimities of a terrific storm at sea. No scene can be more adapted to direct one's thoughts
		"from nature up to nature's God,, .
Nothing on earth can be better calculated to fill the mind of the beholder with the most vivid impressions of the infinitude the eternity & omnipotence of the Creator. It is then that we feel our own weakness & littleness and spontaneously ask, who but a God of infinite perfections could create "this great & wide sea wherein are things creeping innumerable both small & great; where go the ship,, & where playeth "leviathan

[end of page log343_121.gif]

"highest of living creatures,,? Who but such a being can shut it up with doors when it breaks forth, & make clouds the garment thereof & thick darkness a swaddling band for it; & for it set bars & say hitherto shalt thou come, but no further and here shall thy proud waves be stayed,,? Who but he can "command & raise the stormy winds which lift up the waves thereof & cause the mariners now to mount up to the heavens, & now again to go down to the depths; so that their should are melted because of trouble,, ?
		As for hours I walked the deck and gazed upon these wonders, the descriptions of the ocean which I had read were brought back fresh to my memory & I continued to repeat them to myself, until compelled by the violence of the rain & storm to retreat below. Those thus recurring to my mind were from various authors & I changed and accommodated them & blended them together according as my own fancy or the circumstance of my case seemed to dictate.

Strange pastime takest & shakest thy mighty sides
Indignantly - the pride of navies fall, 
And on thy shore men of a thousand tribes, 
Polite & barbarous, trembling stand, amazed,
And think vast thoughts of ruin, boundlessness, 
Omnipotence, infinitude, eternity,
Exerting all the soul to take thy great idea in

I wantoned with thy breakers - they to me 
Were a delight: and if the freshening sea
Made them a terror - Twas a pleasing fear,

"After the storm expect a calm,, says the proverb & so we find it. Old ocean must have a siesta, or a nap, after exertions so violent as those he yesterday put forth. If the figure may be allowed having allayed the winds, dispersed the clouds & brought back the day old Neptune seems now to be rocking himself to sleep. But though it may be very soothing to him it is torturing & harassing to us at least to as many as have received bruises & falls by being tossed about by the violent rolling & surging of the vessel. The commotion of yesterday & the calm of to day forcibly remind one of the beautiful line in the first book of the Aeneid, 
	Interca magno misceri murmure pontum, 
	Emisanque himen sensit Neptunus et imis 
	Stagna refusa vadis. Graviten commotus et alto 
 	Prospiciens, sunma placidum caput extulit unda.
	Eurum as se Lephyrumque vocatl dehine taliafatur
	Tantane vos generis lemuit fiducia vestri?
	Fam caeluim terrangue meo sine mumine venti,
	Misecre, st tantas audetis tollere moles?
	maturate fugam,................................................
	Sic ait et dicto citius tumida equora placat;
	Collectasque fugat nubes, solemque reducit. 
				Thus translated by Dryden

	Meantime imperial Neptune heard the sound
	Of raging billows breaking on the ground. 
	Displeased, and fearing for his watery virgin
	He reared his awful head above the main,
	Serene in majesty - there rolled his eyes 
	Around the space of earth, and seas, and skies. 
	He summoned Eurus & the Western blast, 
	And first an angry glance on both he cast, 
	There thus rebuked - "Audacious wind! from whence 
	This bold attempt, this rebel insolence!
	It is for you to ravage seas and land
	Unauthorized by any supreme command?
	To raise such mountains on the troubled main?,,
...........................................................................................
	He spoke, and while he spoke he smooth'd the sea, 
	Dispell'd the darkness and restored the day. 
In this manner does heathenism ascribe 
the raising & allaying of Ocean's storms to supernatural power - But the heathen's blindness inputs the one to a malignant & enraged deity, and the other to a deity benevolent & propitious. The Christian on the contrary, guided by the light of God's Word, recognizes the same kind of hand divine in the storm & in the ensuing calm,
	He raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth
	up the waves of the deck.
	He too maketh the storm a calm , so that

The rest of Ocean after a storm is finely alluded to by Mrs. Sigourney in her beautiful description of Niagara - Indeed much of the poem is very appropriate to the ocean & the "rainbow on the forehead,, & the "cloud mantled around the feet,, and the "voice of thunder,, are as really though not as constantly in the one as in the other. 
	"Flow on forever, in thy glorious robe
	Of terror and of beauty. Yea, flow on.
	Unfathomed and resistless. God hat set
	His rainbow on thy forehead : and the cloud
	Mantled around thy feet power to speak of Him
	Eternally - bidding the lip of man

	The insect-trump that tells her trifling joys,

	Of thy tremendous hymn. Proud Ocean shrinks
	Back from thy brotherhood, and all his waves 
	Retire abashed. For he hath need to sleep
	Sometimes like a spent laborer, calling home
	His boisterous billows from their vexing play
	To a long, dreary calm :
	The morning stars that hailed creation's birth,
	Heard thy hoarse anthem, mixing with their song

By the rainbows on the forehead as referred to the ocean might be meant those that are sometimes formed in the spray of the billows on a clear & windy day. I have gazed upon them or hours in succession, admiring their exquisite though transient beauty. They vanish in a moment & are succeeded by new ones in turn. The cloudy horizon & roaring of the ocean explain the others. Weather today more or less hazy. The crew have amused themselves catching porpoises of which several schools have been around the ship. They have had remarkable success having captured eight in all. They resemble the whale in several respects - like

That they are furnished with blow or spout holes and come to the surface to breathe & like that their bodies are covered with blubber. The blubber varies in thickness with the size & condition of the animal, but usually is from 1/2 to 3/4 of an inch. Like the whale also, the female porpoise suckles her young & is provided with organs upon her belly appropriate to this office. One of those caught this morning contained a perfect young animal nearly two feet in length. For more than a fortnight now the crew have been furnished with porpoise meat, a fresh one having been caught every two or three days during this period. The liver and heart resemble in taste those of swine & the flesh is of a red color like beef & when well cooked forms a very palatable dish. Most of those caught to day have been of a species called by the whalemen Right whale Porpoises from their resemblance to that animal, in having a smooth back without fins or humps. They are an elegantly formed & beautiful fish varying from five to eight feet in length. The others captured to day were of a kind called by whalemen Fin Back porpoises, from their having a dorsal fin like that species of the Whale. The right whale porpoise is of a [blank space] color on the back & white on the belly. The color of the fin back species is

About 8 1/2 o. clock this morning the man at mast head reported a right whale blowing a short distance ahead. The boats were soon lowered & pursuit made. The whale came up near the boat of the second mate; The instant however he began to approach him, for the purpose of striking, his whaleship took the alarm, suddenly dove and disappeared almost with the rapidity of lightning. When he again made his appearance he was so far to the windward & going so rapidly, that all further thought if capturing him was abandoned & the boats returned to the ship. 
Whilst at dinner this noon, another right whale was announce on or two points upon the windward bow. Dinners were suddenly dispatched, boats down & pursuit made.

Having chased him about in all directions for nearly four hours without getting fast officers & men returned to the ship tired & disappointed - As soon as a boat approached the whale, it would immediately sink & escape & then soon appear again in another place. Again they would pursue in the hope of success & again fail - Thus were they tantalized hour after hour, until their patience was completely exhausted. Such are the trials & vexations to which whalemen are constantly subjected. To make the matter still worse, instead of enduring them with patience & thus becoming better for their trouble, they make them the occasion of the most dreadful outbursts of profanity. One of our officers remarked this evening that he has sworn to day as much as two whales were worth.

Last evening after returning from their fruitless chase the crew were occupied until sunset in driving the hoops of the casts and in stowing down the oil obtained from the last whale. It amounts to about twenty three barrels, and with the other, makes thirty eight of sperm, which we have taken during the passage. 
				About 11 o. clock last night the wind changed to the N.E. about the same time it commenced raining. In the course of the night the wind veered to the N.W. - This morning early it blew fresh from the N.W. attended with fog & rain. Since yesterday noon I notice the barometer has fallen from 29.8 inches to 29.2. this is 1/5 of an inch lower than it has been since we set sail. A sudden fall of the Barometer is usually a precursor of a severe storm, and yet at the present time 1/2 past nine A.M. there is every appearance of pleasant weather. The wind is just at this moment blowing freshly from the W. the clouds are breaking away & the sun beginning to shine forth in all his brilliancy.

the appearance of the sky & the ocean - Notwithstanding every thing looks fair to me. Captn G. predicts bad weather in consequence of certain clouds which skirt the Western horizon. These he styles "Double Headers,,. They consist of a range of black clouds, extending from the west towards the south, near the surface of the ocean, and are capped above with white ones, which shoot up their towering heads one over the other like abrupt precipice. He assures me that he has found them an infallible sign of a heavy blow. As we stood gazing upon them in admiration of their beauty, he exclaimed "no painter on earth can paint like that,,. Upon enquiring how the Barometer stood I informed him that it was unusually low. He added in reply that though the clouds were not so dark & threatening as he had sometimes seen them yet he should be mistaken if we did not have a high wind before long.
					Five o. clock P.M. Immediately after the above conversation I left the deck & retired to my stateroom about 10 o. clock. In a very few moments my attention was suddenly arrested by the loud & earnest command of the Captn

"Hard up your wheel,, "hard up,, "Clew up the mizzen topsail,, &c. &c. - Running instantly upon the poop-deck I witnessed such a scene as I never before beheld - The sea in the rear of the ship was one entire sheet of white foam. The clouds & mists appeared to have descended to the very surface & to be approaching us, almost with the velocity of lightning. Before the orders could be fully obeyed the storm in all its fury was upon us. Our staunch ship, as if endued with intelligence, seemed to tremble at the onset. It burst upon us at first in the form of a tornado from the South West. So sudden was its appearance & so rapid its progress that though the Capt had been constantly watching the clouds in that direction, there was but barely time, after discovering it to get the ship fairly before it & to commence securing the topsails, before it reached us. The Scene that followed I cannot describe. The roaring of the wind, the whistling & snapping of 
the rigging, the creaking of the masts & spars, the violent flapping of the vent & shivered sails, the bursting of bands & braces the sundering of straps & sewings, the commotion of the sea, the white spray flying in clouds from the summits of the waves, the plunging of the ship, the billows in copious

floods dashing over her bows, the loud and earnest commands of the Captain & officers their prompt execution by the crew, the excited and anxious countenance of the men at the helm, the very serious but resolute aspect of all on board, all this and much more presented or occurring in rapid succession, cannot be adequately portrayed in language and can be duly appreciated only by an actual witness on the spot. For more than  four hours we drove dead before the storm, its impetuosity scarcely seeming to abate at all during the whole time. Very soon after it struck us, the Parral Seizing & strap upon the main-topsail yard parted and at the same time the larboard brace band at the end of the yard broke. The yard & sail then blew off from the topmast, some five or six feet, and every moment for more than half an hour we expected to see them break away & go overboard. The fore topmast staysail was also very soon torn into flitters. The men having furled the mizzen Topsail, the Foresail & foretopsail and clewed up and secured the mainsail, Mr. Hatch the fourth mate disregarding the imminent danger of either being thrown off the loose & flying spar, or of going overboard

with it ventured out upon the yard & secured a strong strap firmly around the end. To this he fastened the lift & the foot Brace xxx xxx xxxxx.  The yard having been drawn back & secured to the mast with great difficulty & labor, the sail was clewed up & close reefed. It ought perhaps be stated that the yard was thus got back & made fast as well as circumstance permitted before Mr. H. went out & put on the strap. In doing this he also made use of the maintopgallant sheet as a foot-rope pin this manner diminishing the danger as much as possible. This having been dispatched, a small sail called the main spencer was hoisted & under that & the close reefed main topsail the ship was hove to about three o. clock this afternoon.
				9 o. clock in the evening - For about six hours we have now been lying to the vessel heading W.N.W. the gale is still very strong and the sea high. At times it appears to blow as violently as at the commencement of the storm. In several instances our firm ship has careened so far as to dip a considerable portion of her bulwarks beneath the water, thus admitting it copiously though her port holes. The wind continues to blow principally from the S.W. as at first During the greater part of the afternoon there have been broken flying

[end of page log343_139.gif]

clouds, but occasionally the sky has been almost entirely clear. There was a little rain at the beginning of the blow, but it did not continue long. The Captain has repeatedly remarked that he never knew the wind to blow harder & that an individual insight go to sea twenty years without encountering a storm equal to this in impetuosity. Indeed at times it seemed almost impossible for it to blow more violently. A considerable portion admiring and at the same time dreading the awful grandeur of the scene. With one of our own distinguished poets I can unite in thus addressing the ocean
		"I too have seen thee on thy surging path
		When the swift tempest met thee: thou didst dash
		Thy while arms high in heaven as if in wrath,
		Threatening the angry sky; Thy waves did last 
		The laboring vessel, and with deadening crash
		Rush madly forth to scourge its groaning sides;
		Onward thy billows came to meet and clash
		In a wild warfare till the lifted tides
		Mingled their yeasty tops where the dark storm-cloud rides.,,

The violence of the wind gradually abated during the latter part of  last night. This forenoon the weather was clear and the wind moderate. All the crew have been engaged in repairing damages. They set the foresail unbent the maintopsail, took it down & put in a new lining, a considerable part of the old having been blown off in the gale. They also fitted the maintopsail yard & secured it in the best possible manner. In the afternoon bent on the maintopsail & set it.

					Sabbath Evening December 8th 1844 {1844/12/08}
We have had a delightful day. have spent the greater portion of it in studying the description of the priesthood of our Savior as recorded in the epistle to the Hebrews. Have attended particularly to the comparison instituted between Christ as our "Great High Priest,, and the High Priest of the Mosaic Economy. How exalted the advantages of the Christian above the Jews, in consequence of the great superiority of his High Priest to theirs. Through faith in the blood of Jesus we with boldness or with the utmost freedom are invited to enter the "Holy of Holies,, ourselves & present our petitions at the "Mercy Seat,,. Under the old dispensation the High Priest alone could enter there. We can do it at all times; He but once a year. We, everywhere & without regard to circumstances. He on in one place and with the utmost circumspections in regard to external appearance. His sacrifice must be presented often; Ours has been once for all. He a sinner like his fellow mortals; Our High Priest did no sin & was without guile. He continued by another a few years & was then succeeded by another mortal like himself; ours exists forever. His offering availed only for purifying the

Outward man; that of ours affects the conscience and the heart. 
		"Jesus my great High Priest,
		Offer'd his blood and died;
		My guilty conscience seeks
		No sacrifice beside:
		His powerful blood did once atone,
		And now it pleads before the throne.,,
Have just returned from the after deck which is my promenade, where I have been contemplating the beauties of the ocean. The twilight, the scattered clouds & the sky just beginning to be studded over with the "glittering host,,. I also sang as peculiarly appropriate to my circumstances the beautiful hymn beginning
		"How sweet the light of sabbath eve,
		How soft the sunbeams ling'ring there:
		For these blest hours, the world I leave,
		Wafted on wings of praise & prayer.,,
It was indeed a delightful scene, and admirably adapted to arouse to ecstasy the soul of every one capable of relishing the beauties of creation. As I gazed around, another favorite hymn occurred spontaneously to my mind, which I could not refrain from repeating to myself
		Lord! When my rapture thought surveys

A sabbath Evening like this has been finely described by a poet of our own native state in the following lines
	"How calmly sinks the parting sun!
	yet twilight lingers still;
	And beautiful as dreams of heaven
	it slumbers on the hill;
	Earth sleeps with all her glorious things,
	Beneath the Holy spirit wings
	And rendering back the hues above
	Seems resting in a trance of love.
	And yonder western throng of clouds, 
	Retiring from the sky
	So calmly move so softly glow
	They seem to Fancy's eye
	Bright creatures of a better sphere,
	Come down at noon to worship here,
	And from their sacrifice of Love
	returning to their home above.
	-------------------------------
	The spirit of the holy eve 
	Comes through the silent air

[end of page log343_147.gif]

	To feelings hidden spring and makes
	A gush of music there;
	And the fair depths of ether beam 
	So passing fair, we almost dream
	That we can rise and wander through
	Their open paths of trackless blue.
	---------------------------------------
	Each should is filled with glorious dreams,
	Each pulse is beating wild;
	And thought is soaring to the shrine
	Of glory undefiled;
	And holy aspirations start
	Like the blessed angels from the heart
	And bind - for earth's dark ties are riven - 
	Our spirits to the gates of heaven.,,
During the greater part of the day it has been almost calm. I distributed amongst the men this morning a quantity of the Sailor's Magazines & have been gratified to see so many engaged in reading them. Though the wind was very light last night yet according to our chronometers we have made considerable progress in the last twenty four hours.

This morning the wind blew fresh from the N.W. having sprung up during the latter part of the night. It continued throughout the forenoon to increase gradually, raising at the same time a heavy sea & driving us on at the rate of 8 or 9 knots an hour. This afternoon until 3 o. clock it was squally & rainy. between 3 & 4 it cleared away & the wind sprung up fresh from the S.W.

During the voyage the Capt and some of the officers have repeatedly remarked "well we shall have a change in the weather & wind at the change of the moon.,, The question too is often asked at the table in case we are having calms or light head winds when does the moon quarter or full or change as the case may be. I have freely expressed my entire unbelief in respect to lunar influence upon wind & weather & have been met with the reply you cannot convince an experienced seaman that the moon does not effect such changes - In consequence of this I have concluded for my own satisfaction to keep particular account of the state of the wind & weather about the lulls quarters & changes of the moon. Last night the moon changed about 10 o. clock. Previous to that it was blowing quite freshly from the S.W. Soon after 10 the wind died away & during the rest of the night & the whole of to day it has been almost a perfect calm. The sky has been clear & the air mild & pleasant. Thermom 70ø barom 29.63.

Having noticed a query in Barretts "Geog. of the Heavens,, which interested me I proposed it to the men in the steerage and also to the officers in the Cabin at breakfast this morning. It was this, "How could it happen to a person having sailed Easterly around the world on his return to have six Sundays in the month of February?. Another connected with it is this "how after sailing around in a Westerly course could he have but three Sundays in the above month? The general principle all seemed readily to understand, but no one explained the particular manner in which the case must occur - E.G. In the first of the questions it must be granted that it be in leap year, that the month with the man commences on the sabbath & that he must have continued his reckoning uniformly on without changing it from the commencement of his voyage; upon these conditions he has five sabbaths on shipboard & if he arrives at home the last day of the month at evening the next day at home he will find to be Sunday the last of February, thus he will have the six. Taking the other direction & supposing the month to commence on Monday it may be easily seen how 

[end of page log343_151.gif]

he could have but three sabbaths if he reached home on the last Saturday of the month - In this case he would find the next day at home would be Monday. Vide Burritt's Geog &.c. Art Earth -

For more than a month past we have seen occasionally large flocks of small whitish or light brown birds flying in the neighborhood of the ship. they are called whale birds by the officers and men and are said to be furnished with an apparatus in the mouth through which they suck their food similar to the bone of the right whale. They are also said to live upon the same small animals floating in the water that the whale feeds upon. From this they derive their name - they are seen hundreds in a flock flying near the surface & occasionally alighting

[end of page log343_152.gif]

on the water for a moment & then rising again. They have long wings, but their bodies I should think are not much larger than those of the common house martins - Their backs and the upper parts of their wings appear to be of a light brown color, the entire under side both of wings & body appear to be white. I have noticed at times whole acres of whale feed floating near the surface & apparently extending down a considerable depth. Upon this I suppose the above described & also other oceanic birds live. This feed when seen at a distance (which is the only may that I have yet seen it) gives to the water a peculiar color, of a reddish cast or perhaps a greenish red. It consists of an infinite number of small animals, which are commonly called shrimps. Should I be so fortunate as to obtain any of these I will give a more particular account of them. 
	As mentioned at the close of yesterday's journal the Barometer began to fall last evening at the same time it became cloudy & the wind from the N.N.E. grew stronger. It continued to increase through the night & the rain fell in torrents accompanied with sharp lightning. About 4 o. clock this morning it changed to the N.W. & in the course of the forenoon

A day or two since the Capt on examining the clothing of Richard Francis who was unfortunately lost overboard on the 13th of last month {1844/11/13}, found an unfinished letter addressed to his parents - By this it appears that he had both father & mother brothers and sisters living. In it he strongly regrets having come to sea & expresses his sorrow that he has not taken Deacon Newton's advice & so remained at home.

So in respect to the stars, the constellations which at home are seen in the far south appear as unnatural when beheld in the North. The Captain remarked this afternoon that he had become so used to these scenes in South Latitude that they appear to him as natural as those a the North.

					Sabbath evening Dec 15th 1844 {1844/12/15}
This morning gave the men in the forecastle another package of the seaman's Magazines. Have spent most of the day in reading Barnes on the Hebrews committing to memory the 118th Psalm, and in perusing Baxter's Saint's Rest. In Hebrews I paid particular attention to the commencement of the sixth chapter & especially to the 4th 5th & 6th verses. This passage as explained by Mr. B. teaches the actual impossibility of restoration to the Divine favor in case a real Christian should apostatize. The reason & explanations he gives seem to me conclusively to show that his mode of interpreting this much controverted portion of the Epistle is correct. At the same time however he full believes the scripture doctrine that no truly regenerate person who really loves God & sincerely believes upon the atonement of Christ for forgiveness, who takes heart felt delight in prayer & in the perusal of the sacred oracles will ever wholly & perseveringly apostatize. 
		Having been in the practice of committing select portion of the Bible, I was induced to choose this the 118th Psalm from having read that Luther in his afflictions & trials derived great comfort from frequently

[end of page log343_157.gif]

rehearsing & singing it over to himself. And certainly nothing could be better adapted to afford encouragement to the Christian in such circumstances, than the precious truths it contains. In Baxter I have read and as I hope with profit to myself, his excellent chapter on self examination & have endeavored to comply with his directions & earnest exhortations. I can sincerely join with the pious Newton in saying
	Tis a point I long to know
	Oft it causes anxious thought
	Do we love the Lord or no?

Between 11 & 12 a large school of blackfish were discovered near the ship - before the boats could be lowered they passed along under the bows of the ship so near that they could have easily been harpooned from the martingale. the boats pursued killed & captured two these were hoisted aboard whole & the blubber taken off in strips about 5 or 6 inches wide & extending the whole length of the fish. Those captured measured about 14 feet in length & in the largest part about 7 or 8 in circumference. The blubber varies in thickness from an inch to an inch and a half. 
				This animal as before mentioned is a species of the whale. It lives upon the same food as the sperm whale. It is furnished with a blow hole. Like that & also with a very large quantity of oily matter in the

head. These were both females & had teats about as large as those of a swine one on each side of the opening in the latter part of the belly. The males are generally larger than the females sometimes measuring more than twenty feet in length. They yield according to their size 
 from 10 or 15 to 50 or 60 gallons of oil. Their color is black with the exception of a strip of white along the belly. The flesh somewhat resembles beef in appearance and is quite palatable when cooked in a proper manner. The best portions of those hooked to day were preserved for the crew. We had supper of it this evening & shall probably make it supply the place of salt beef & pork for four or five days. We have had in this respect a greater variety of food than I anticipated. By means of fresh fish porpoises & black fish, we have been able thus frequently to change sea fare which in general consists of one unvarying round of salt beef & pork - 
Our course to day has been S.E. by S. by compass but the variation carries us but little south of east - Wind N. for the most part. Observ Lat. 40ø 32' S.

We are now in the longitude of the Crozet Islands & only 7ø or 8ø north of them. As it was three months yesterday since we left home & as we have not yet accomplished half our voyage the Captn has concluded not to visit the whaling ground in the vicinity of those islands, but hurry forward as fast as possible. He has been greatly disappointed in not finding whales between Trustines & this place & frequently alludes to his hard luck in the strongest terms of dissatisfaction. He keeps the best possible lookout at masthead, sometimes standing there for hours himself, but all hitherto in vain. We have in fact seen but 4 or 5 right whales & those so extremely wary that it was impossible to strike them. He also thinks the prospect of finding any at the Crozets in case he should go there extremely small. He often tells me he would almost as lieve die as to be obliged to go home without getting oil e.g. without getting the ship nearly or quite full. I tell him if his owner & friends could see how faithful he was they would at least attach no blame to him. He has himself raised & captured all the whales that we

have as yet taken & he also killed one of the blackfish caught yesterday. I also tell him by the way of consolation that the purpose is all that is in his power, that the circumstances are beyond his control, & though he is no great admirer of the muses, I sometimes quote poetry in confirmation of the correctness of any remarks on the present instance, leaving the application entirely to the case in hand.

	Thy purpose firm is equal to the deed:

The Barometer fell again last night & this morning stood at 29.4 inches. The wind continued very high from the West throughout the night, but to day it has blown a perfect gale. The sea has run mountains high & the white combers have frequently dashed copious floods over the lofty sides of our stalwart ship. We have driven on almost dead before it under double reefed main & fore topsails & fore sail having all others snugly furled. The scene from the poop deck has been grand indeed. As far as the eye could reach in all directions it was a vast panorama of raging waters. Thus to behold the huge billows rolling majestically onwards one after another separated by chasms yawning wide & deep having their summits all capped with white foam, which ever & anon is breaking & dashing wildly down their sides is truly a sublime spectacle and is witnessed in its perfection only by those

As I stood upon the deck enjoying the sight, I was interested in noticing with what remarkable facility the Albatross the cape pigeon & stormy petrel encounter such a storm. They seem in fact to enjoy the commotion of the elements as such a time with the highest zest - Amidst the very fury of the winds when one could scarcely stand on deck, they apparently with perfect ease seen to cut their way through the liquid air, skimming over the surface of the waves & with the utmost nicety adapting their motions to the ever varying undulations of the sea. 
The petrels above mentioned have been our constant companions  for more than two months. They are found dispersed over every part of the ocean thousands of miles from land & in every zone of the earth. They are almost forever in the wing & are seemingly incapable of fatigue. I have never seen them light upon the surface except for a moment to procure some particle of floating food. Not having had the good fortune to capture any of the species for the purpose of minute examinations. I am indebted to Olmstead's

Incidents of a Whaling Voyage,, for the following description which so far as my observation extends is strictly accurate. They are in size a very little larger than the common barn swallow. They have a dark brown glossy plumage with a fringe of white feathers upon their backs near the tail. Their nostrils unite in a single tube upon the upper mandible of the bill & like other sea birds they are web footed. By sailors they are styled Mother Carey's Chickens & were former regarded by them with superstitious awe. The appearance of these birds in great numbers was supposed to be indication of the coming storm,, & on this account they received the maledictions of the mariner. To this the poet alluded in the closing part of the following very graphic description

been much interested & instructed in continuing the perusal of Mr. Barnes' commentary on the Hebrews - Also have read a part of the prophecies of Jeremiah & a portion of Baxter. The portion of Hebrews to which I have particularly attended is the 7th chapter in which the apostle institutes a comparison between Melchisedek & Christ. In accordance with the opinion of Josephus Mr. Barnes supposes Melchisedek to have been a pious Canaanitish prince endued with unusual knowledge & wisdom. That he was king of Jerusalem or of a city & people situated where Jerusalem was afterward builded. He was both Priest & king - in rank therefore superior to Abraham who was neither. His genealogy is not given & thus he is said to be "without father or mother or descent,, no account of his birth or death is found in Scripture & therefore he is said to be without "beginning of days or end of life,,. He "abideth a priest continually,, because there is no account of his ceasing to exercise the priestly office. Other priests discontinued at a particular age or their office ceased with their death. His priesthood not limited by age & as there is no mention of his death, it in a certain sense, may be said to be continual. In the same manner

[end of page log343_169.gif]

he explains the difficult expression in verse 8th ver "of whom it is witnessed that he liveth,, as equivalent to saying the record is that he lived - there is no notice of his death - no account of any preceding or succeeding him therefore in contrast with the Levitical priesthood he may be called a perpetual priest, and though in reality dead, yet in regard to the matter in hand it is the same as if he were still alive. To him as his superior Abraham the great father of the Jewish Nation paid tithes, and by this act he as the ancestor of the Levitical community acknowledges his inferiority to one who was declared to be like the Messiah, or who was of the same order. In these particularly Christ who was a High Priest after the order of or of the same rank as Melchisedek, was consequently superior to the Levitical High Priest. A new order of priesthood superior to the old, implied defects in the old - implied also new laws and abrogation of the old - In this manner the ceremonial law not being adapted in its nature to the new & more exalted priesthood of Christ, ceases to be binding  and is virtually repealed. Christ moreover is superior to the Levitical High Priest because he was set apart to the office by the solemn oath of Jehovah but the Aaronick high priest received the office

by virtue of descent according to the law of Moses & without the confirmation of an oath. he is on this account made Surety of a better testament or covenant than the old one. The old was confined to a single nation was loaded with rites & ceremonies, was in its nature merely typical in itself not capable of purifying the conscience & was transitory & changing. The new extends to the whole race, is simple & easy in its terms free from oppressive rites, reaches the heart & conscience & is permanent & eternal. As our Great High Priest Christ is exactly fitted to our wants. I am a great sinner, he perfectly holy himself has become my surety or bondsman that no injury shall be done to the divine government by saving me from the just penalty of my sins. Holy wise & benevolent laws I have violated times & ways almost beyond number; Strict justice demands my eternal Punishment God's laws must be honored if I Jewish, He come in between me & strict justice and with his one great sacrifice satisfies the claims of broken laws & says "go in peace thy sins are forgiven thee.,, I am the victim of suffering & sorrow, He is kind & compassionate & pities my woes - I am ignorant he has in himself all the

Yeah he will accompany me entirely through the valley convey me safe over the Jordan of death & plant my feet firm on Canaan's shore. Will may I exclaim with the poet,

About 5 o. clock this morning a dead whale was discovered by the 3rd Mate whilst at masthead. A boat was soon lowered & on approaching it, it , it was found to be a small sperm whale which had been dead about four days. It had one harpoon in its body & it had also been deeply lanced. Doubtless the animal was killed & afterward abandoned wither on account of the fog or darkness or some such cause. It was soon along side and the blubber &c taken in & stowed into casks in the course of the forenoon. It was about the size of the one we captured on the 2nd Sabbath after we set sail. I took more particular notice of the manner of dividing the head in the instance than in the others & found my former account somewhat inaccurate. the head is cut into four pieces instead of three when it is hoisted on board entire. The lower jaw with the fat & blubber attached constitutes one piece. The upper jaw & skull bones &c. another. The junk another, & the top containing the case another. The junk also does not extend back so near to the neck joint or back part

[end of page log343_174.gif]

of the head as is represented in the previous description. Usually it does not extend more than one half or two thirds of the length of the head; though this depends upon the manner of cutting it, as there appears to be no natural division separating it from the other parts. 
			Having differed in opinion from the officers respecting the size of the Albatross, they thinking that Olmstead's description representing it twice as large as a goose correct, I caught & weighed one to day for the sake of ascertaining the case. The one which I captured was somewhat above the ordinary size, though by no means the very largest. It weighed alive 19 1/2 lbs & measured from tip to tip of its wings 10 1/2 feet. When standing erect it was about two feet in height. Its body was covered with an exceeding dense coat of feathers & down especially upon the breast. When divested of these I presume its size would be diminished more than one half. I suppose the very largest domestic geese when fat will weigh nearly as much as this, but ordinarily I am inclined to think they would not much exceed one half the weight. During the

Whilst we were sleeping last evening our friends at home were spending Christmas, our present longitude making our day about 10 hours earlier than theirs. Our yesterday was spent amid the perfumes of "dead whale, and instead of having an extra dinner &.c. of roast turkey and the kindred luxuries we dined on pork & beans. The crew however seemed in very good spirits & cheerfully toiled throughout the day to secure the prize so providentially thrown in their way - Last night about 11 o. clock we mad the Island of St. Pauls. The wind being somewhat a head we were not able to reach it until 9 1/2 o. clock this morning. About 10 the 1st & 2nd mates with their

boats & crews & myself started for the shore on a fishing excursion. The wind blowing violently from the N.E. we were obliged to keep under lee of the island & for some hours could find no kept to which to fasten our boats. At length succeeding in this we caught in the afternoon about 3 barrels of most excellent fish - They were of various kinds & sized. The largest weighing 10 to 20 lbs each resembled our cod fish. A smaller species weighing from 3 to 10 lbs each resembled in color & shape our poggies. They were extremely fat & when cooked this evening for supper we found them truly delicious - there was also a smaller kind of blue fish weighing from 2 to 5 lbs. each - Another with yellow sides weighing from 5 to 10 lbs each - another with striped sides resembling our striped bass about the same weight of the last mentioned. Two or three small sharks were taken & one small red fish somewhat resembling those kept for curiosities at home. Had the weather been favorable we could have taken three times as many. I was desirous to have the capt remain another day

but he was unwilling. The barometer was low & the weather boisterous and threatening & in case any accident should occur he was apprehensive that he might be censured. We left the Island there fore this evening about 8 o. clock & are now rapidly progressing Eastward under a stiff N.W. wind. the Island of St. Pauls which we have thus left is about   [blank space] miles in circumference - It arises abruptly from the midst of the ocean & towers upward to the height of about [blank space] feet. it bank on the southern side are high & steep, to all appearance 30 or 40 feet above the surface. It seemed impossible to effect a landing upon any part which fell under and observation . The surface was covered with green grass  & well adapted for grazing - some of our party were confident that they heard the lowing of cattle & saw a hut which had the appearance of being occupied. Apart of the land was black & probably had been burnt over for the purpose of destroying old stubble & bushes - The Cat's informs me that there is a bay on one side of the island where boats can enter & land with ease & that

it abounds with excellent craw fish or south sea lobsters. There is also a boiling spring near the shore in the bay where fish can be easily cooked in a few moments.

About midnight last night the wind changed from N.W. to the south and in 2 or 3 hours after it cleared off & became cooler. This forenoon it was clear & the wind very fresh. The barometer has been low throughout the day averaging about 29.45 inches - this afternoon the win increased to a gale. About 4 1/2 o. clock a sever squall arose. just as it commenced we ran into a school of large sperm whales. They were near the ship blowing leisurely & seeming if conscious that they could not be injured by us in the 

[end of page log343_179.gif]

midst of such a tempest. The Captn had the ship put in a state of preparation to lower the boats but the wind at this moment blowing very violently it was utterly impossible to effect any thing - With great reluctance therefore we were compelled to let the whales go unmolested. About 5 1/2 o. clock we shipped a very heavy sea which dashing up the side of the vessel lifted the starboard railing lifted the starboard railing forward the gangway six inches from its place for a distance of 12 or 15 feet. The Capt remarked that we had encountered but one single blow of any considerable degree of violence since leaving home, in which something pertaining to the ship had not given away. Some of these I have recorded, but others have omitted. E.G. on Sunday the 15th {1844/12/15}the day before our mizzen topsail burst the larboard martingale G    parted during a strong breeze from the N.E. - Also in a squall that occurred about 3 o. clock P.M. on Thursday the 19th {1844/12/19} ins. one of the iron bolts to the main topmast stay broke. These accidents though somewhat frequent are comparatively trifling.

I forgot to mention in my journal of Wednesday last that whilst Mr Chapel the 3rd mat was cutting up a portion of the blubber belonging to the head of the whale which we found dead that morning he discovered a stone about the size of a small walnut imbedded deep in the fat. He presented the stone to me to preserve as a memento of a singular fact. It may have been taken with its food & by some means got through the other parts of the animal from the internal organs to the place where it was found, or it any have been forced through the skin by external violence & in the course of time penetrated to the position from which it was cut out - Wind to day south Westerly & violent with high sea - Course South easterly by compass - Barom 29.45 inches - Thermom 55ø

[end of page log343_181.gif]

is in doubt in respect to the Island at which we stopped on Thursday last, whether it was the northernmost or southernmost of the two. Both appear to be called St. Pauls & both sometimes Amsterdam. But to distinguish them whalermen call the northernmost Amsterdam & the southernmost St. Paul's. On Wednesday whilst we were cutting in & boiling the ship he thinks might have drifted to the Northward. It was so cloudy and rainy both that day & Thursday that we were not able to get observations for lat. or lon. The Island which we made at 11 o. clock in the evening bore in a different direction from what he supposed St. Paul's should have borne, judging from our situation on Tuesday & our subsequent course. Another thing which leads him to think it was Amsterdam is the fact that yesterday noon our latitude placed us 7 miles north of St. Pauls whereas with the course we steered during the night & forenoon we should have been considerably to the south of it in case that was really the one we left Thursday evening. The

[end of page log343_182.gif]

Island at which we fished was at the time so completely enveloped in fog that it could not be recognized from its appearance by those of the crew that has previously visited it. The probability however is strong that it was Amsterdam. The crew last evening secured the rail that was started up by the sea yesterday, but this morning we shipped another which tore it up again - they have again bolted it down as firmly as possible this afternoon. The officers informed me last night that they discovered a comet in the west early in the evening & came in to call me but found I had retired & did not disturb me. One of them states that he saw it last Sunday night, but did not think to mention it to any one. I went out about 10 o. clock last evening & on learning the fact that it had been visible, I endeavored to see it, but the moon shining brightly in the east & the mist in the west rendered it impossible - Shall try to obtain a view to night though the sky at present is very unpromising - We have cloudy chilly weather here much of the time -

at 4 o. clock this morning a ship was discovered a few miles astern of our vessel. After about an hour, another was seen near the first. About 7 o. clock the Capt ordered the foresail to be drawn up in token of a desire to speak them. In the course of an hour they both approached and spoke us & at the invitation of Captain Greene the Captains both came on board and spent the day with us. The ships proved to be the Champion, Capt Sanford, from New Bedford, and the Armata, Capt Hull from New London. The Champion sailed in June & has about 950 Bls, the Armata in August and has taken six whales making about 300 or 350 bls. They report having seen a large number of ships bound East, some of these they spoke & others they heard from. The Columbia Capt Kelley is reported with 8 whales, the Hibernia J. Smith 4 do. - Com.

I have spent the day in reading the life of Baxter which I commenced a few days since & in the study of Hebrews. Some of the more important incidents in the personal history of that eminently holy man I will here record for the purposes of impressing them deeply upon my memory -  He was born in 1615 {1615/00/00}- His father a truly pious man, early taught him religious truth & trained him up in the habits of reading the scriptures & other good books. Yet to some extent like most youths he was guilty of lying, stealing, gluttony, gambling or playing games for money, novel reading, scurrilous & low conversation, pride & irreverence to parents. He sometimes stole away on the Sabbath & joined with wicked associated in dancing around a may pole or beneath a tree in accordance with the custom of the times. At the age of 15 his attention was particularly turned to the subject of personal piety. But he never knew the time when he became a Christian. A book entitled "Bunny Resolutions,, one called "Sibb's bruised Reid,, and a work on "repentance & the art of Living,, were under the teaching of the Holy Spirit, the means of his conversion. He was prepared to enter the university either at Cambridge or at

[end of page log343_185.gif]

Oxford, but concluded to pursue a private cause in preference to either. He was early afflicted with bleeding at the lungs, & before the age of 21 expected soon to die of consumption. Between the ages of 21 & 22 he was ordained to preach the gospel. He commenced preaching whilst he had charge of an Academy, but soon relinquished teaching on being invited to settle in another place - His constant ill health has a great effect in increasing his piety. In 1640 {1640/00/00} when less than 25 he was settled at Kidderminster. During the civil war in 1643 {1643/00/00}& 1644 {1644/00/00} he was absent from his people & a part of the time served as Chaplain in Colonel Whalley's regiment. (This one of the Regicides that afterward died in this country) When about 27 or 28 years old he was confined to his chamber by sickness for a period of 4 months during which time he wrote the principal part of the "Saints Rest.,, After his recovery he resumed his charge at Kidderminster where he preached with the happiest results for more 

[end of page log343_186.gif]

than 14 years. During 6 of these years he also practiced medicine & always gratis. As a pastor he was exceedingly faithful & laborious. The probable secret of his great success was following his people to their homes. During this period he also wrote & published about 60 different works some of which were quite extensive. Though living in the time of the administration of the Commonwealth under Cromwell he preferred a monarchy & was therefore favorable to the restoration after the death of that great & distinguished man. Though not opposed to a moderate Episcopacy he could not conscientiously subscribe the oath of conformity enacted during the reign of Charles. At the time of the restoration in 1660 {1660/00/00}Baxter left Kidderminster & went to London. having acquired great celebrity both as a preacher and writer, he was appointed by the new parliament on occasion of a public fast, to preach before them. Soon after he also was appointed to preach a thanksgiving sermon at St. Paul's before the Lord Mayor & Aldermen of London in prospect of the immediate reestablishment of monarchy. His moderate views

[end of page log343_187.gif]

however were not acceptable to partisans on either side & both sermons were of course unpopular. Amongst a number of distinguished Presbyterian ministers he was appointed in June 1660 {1660/06/00}one of the Chaplains in ordinary to the king. he endeavored to secure free toleration & religious liberty for all sects, and especially to effect a union between Episcopalians & Presbyterians. For this purpose he held conferences with the restored King & his ministers, but all to no purpose. At this time he was offered a bishopric by the Lord Chancellor but declined the acceptance. At the savory Conference he endeavored to effect a union between the different religious sects but was unsuccessful. In 1662 {1662/00/00} by the act of uniformity he with 2000 other ministers who could not conform was ejected from his parish & his salary. after this being prevented from public preaching he resided for a few years at Acton near London & was engaged in writing & publishing books tract &.c. - here he acquired the esteem & confidence of that great & good man Sir Matthew Hale. During the dreadful Plague

[end of page log343_188.gif]

& destruction fire which broke out in London in the years 1665 {1665/00/00}& 1666 {1666/00/00} he was very active with his pen, writing short tracts, handbills &.c. suitable to the times, & publishing & scattering them freely amidst the tens of thousands that died meekly. These were productive of great good. Though he desisted from public preaching he was in the habit of preaching in his own private house on the sabbath. At length he was tried for this as a violation of the act of uniformity & as a punishment imprisoned for six months. For many years subsequent to this he was persecuted tried & subjected to bonds & fines &.c. for teaching in a private way, the gospel of Christ. In this manner his books and property were to a great extent taken from him, or he was compelled to sell or secret them in order to preserve them. At length he was tried for sedition on account of sentiments contained in his paraphrase of the new Testament before the Notorious Jefferies. On the 29th of June 1685 {1685/06/29}, when 70 years old, as the result of this mock trial he was condemned in a fine of 500 marks, sentenced to lie in prison until he paid it, and bound to his good behavior for seven years. unable to pay the fine himself

[end of page log343_189.gif]

and knowing if his friends should do it for him, he would be the subject to the repetition of the same thing, he concluded to go to prison where he remained nearly two years. At the expiration of that time the fine was remitted. In the early part of his ministry he seems to have concluded never to marry but in the year 1662 {1662/00/00} when about 48 years old he changed his mind for the better & married Miss Charlton, an excellent lady with whom he lived as happily as his cruel persecutions would permit until her death in 1681 {1681/00/00}. In all his trials she proved a help meet indeed - In prison she cheered him with her presence, in sickness she administered relief, in times of doubt & despondency she encouraged & sustained him by her cheerful patience. For more than four years before his death he labored in connection with the Rev'd Mr. Sylvester preaching as much as his health would permit & writing the remainder of the time. At length worn out with his untiring efforts & protracted disease, he entered the heavenly rest December 8th 1691 {1691/12/08} in the 77th year of his age. Since the times of the Apostles very few if any men have accomplished more than he for the advancement of Christ's

	In Hebrews I have read the 8th chapter with Barnes' Notes. In this chapter the apostle     enters upon the discussion of the most important point in the whole epistle I.E. that the priesthood of Christ, having reference to a higher & better covenant or dispensation, is performed in heaven & that he has entered into the true tabernacle there. He compares the two covenants or arrangement which God made with men in regard to salvation & shows the superiority of the new to the old; He also shows that the old with all its types & shadows is soon to pass away, but the new is to continue forever.

						Tuesday December 31st 1844 {1844/12/31}
This is the closing day of the year. It has been truly an eventful year to me. During the greater portion of it I have been a sufferer from sickness & though still very unwell I think there is reason to believe that I am convalescent. It is my earnest desire to improve the affliction to my spiritual welfare in accordance with that purpose of my benevolent maker who chastises his "children for their profit that they might be partakers of his holiness.,, In some degree I trust this effect has already been produced. I am deeply conscious of having come very far short of the faithful performance of my duties during the year thus drawing to a close. Yet God has been very merciful to me. I think I can say with the Psalmist "it is good for me that I have been afflicted,,. So far as I know my friends have been blessed with health & with all the bounties of an indulgent providence. I have abundant reason, both with reference to them & myself  also to say with the Psalmist "bless the Lord o my soul & forget not all his benefits who

redeemeth thy life from destruction who crowneth thee with loving kindness and tender mercies,,. O that myself  and all my dear absent friends were more sensible of our obligations to God. How great is our debt & how poorly do we cancel it. It is daily yea momentarily increasing & at such a ratio as to render all efforts to liquidate it utterly fruitless. It is in vain to attempt it & and all we can do is to go deeply sensible of our utter inability & throw ourselves at the foot of the cross & beseech God for Christ's sake to forgive us the whole.

these again on earth is known only to God. he knows all that is before me both during the present year & all subsequent whether in time or eternity. I think too that I am willing to refer all to him & to his decision, both in respect to myself & friends. God reigns, let the earth & especially  let Christians on earth rejoice. It should be enough for them that such a being is upon the throne. 
That this resignation to his will this rejoicing is my earnest desire & prayer. Should my life be spared & health be restored, I am deeply sensible that my whole soul should overflow with gratitude to him. O how humble, how self-denying how meek, how pure, how spiritually minded, how faithful how zealous, how like my blessed Savior should I be. Lord grant that this may be the case. O spare the lives of my dear friends & permit me again to behold their faces in the flesh, but above all prepare them & me for thy kingdom above.

of the past year in accordance with the sentiments of a favorite poet.
	"Tis greatly wise to talk with our past hours
	And ask them what report they bore to heav'n
	And how they might have borne more welcome news.
	Their answers form what men experience call;
	If wisdom's friend, her best; if not, worst foe;
	O reconcile them! kind experience cries,, - 
In respect to the answers of my past hours during the year just closed, I cannot avoid deeply regretting that they are not more in harmony with the dictates of true wisdom. During my whole future life whether long or short I would faithfully improve every hour I would
	Part with precious time as with money, sparing;
	Pay no moment but in purchase of its worth;
	And what its work, ask death beds; they can tell
	I would "part with it as with life, reluctant; big
	With higher aimed still nearer the great mark
	Of men and angels; virtue more divine,,.
O had I been this faithful to redeem every moment of time, how different my attainments in holiness would have been. I tremble at the thought of any longer living at such a distance from my God. O that he would draw me to himself by the sweet but

Powerful influences of his spirit. 
	"O for a closer walk with God 
	A calm and heavenly frame
	A light to shine upon the road
	That leads me to the lamb.,,
Would that during the coming year and my  future life all love of the world might be totally eradicated from my heart, "all selfishness extirpated - pride banished - unbelief removed - all idols dethroned - every thing hostile to holiness and opposed to the divine will crucified; that holiness to the Lord might be engraved on my heart and evermore characterize my conversation.,,
i would look to Jesus for aid; "Lord! if thou wilt thou canst make me clean,, - 
	"Jesus my only hope, thy blood can cleanse
	My deepest stains and purify my soul
	From all its native and contracted guilt;
	In that clear fountain of immortal life
	Let me be cleansed and thoroughly sanctified.
	I come, a helpless miserable wretch, 
	And throw myself and all my future hopes 
	On mercy infinite; reject me not

This afternoon Capt G went on board the Armata to have a social "gam,, with Capt Hull. His mates & some of his men came

aboard & took supper with us - Amongst these there were two brothers of Mr. Chapel our 3d mate. Thus to meet his brothers & find them alive & well was a source of great gratification to him, especially as one of them had narrowly escaped losing his life by the violence of a whale. One of the harpoons which had been thrust into the animal was in some way thrown out & striking his leg above the knee cut & tore the flesh nearly to the bone. Had it gone but a little high it would probably have killed him. One of the Armata's men had also fallen from the foretopsail yard, but striking on deck he had providentially not been very badly injured. they informed us of a sad accident on board the Phenix, Capt Skinner. Daniel Tinker the 3d mate had also fallen from the foretopsail yard & had broken his arm in several places, his leg also in different places & cut a place in his side. Though still living it was doubtful whether he would recover. 
						Sunday evening, for the first time I had an opportunity for a few moments of seeing the comet above alluded to. I endeavored to ascertain in what constellation & in what stars it was situated, but it was so soon obscured by

Clouds as to render this impossible. Its bearing from us was about S.W. and it was nearly 5 hours behind the sun.

Last evening for the first time I had a fair view of the comet. It was seen nearly a fortnight ago, but the sky has been more or less cloudy every evening since. Last night it was very clear. It is seen in the S.W. about 60 degrees above the horizon at dark & with its tail inclining slightly to the north in a direction opposite to the sun. The nucleus was easily seen. It set last evening  a little before midnight. It would appear to be receding from the sun from the fact that it sets later & later every night. At least this is so if the statement of the officers is correct that when first discovered it was some nearer the horizon at dark than it is as present.
				We have had fresh wind to day from the N.W. & cloudy weather. Barometer falling. At present 4 P.M. it stands at 29.35 - Appearances seem to indicate high wind & rough weather nothing to be seen of the Armata. Capt. G. thinks favorably

of the sailing capacities of the Morrison with fair & fresh wind since comparing her speed with the A. on Monday e.g. with double reefed topsails & no top gallant sails we outsailed the A with all her sails spread & doing her utmost to keep with us. On Wednesday Captn Hull said that he should not fear to wage a thousand dollars that the M would beat any ship out of New London at least when sailing before the wind with a strong breeze.
						We have fully satisfied ourselves that the Island at which we took our fish last week was Amsterdam, the northernmost of the two. Captain Hull & Sanford has both been at Amsterdam & they describe the part of it where we stopped as being black, and as apparently having been burnt over. They also confirm the statement of Captain Greene respecting St Paul's being inhabited by a small colony. The Latitude of Amsterdam is 37ø 52' S.

having fallen under my own observation that part of course will only apply to the one at which we stopped. I have not been able to learn much respecting it from the officers or crew. It seems however to be the general opinion amongst them that the island is somewhat larger than St. Paul's & the Capt thinks it more fertile. Upon the side where we fished the banks were steep & high as described under date of Dec 26th {1844/12/26}. There is however lowland upon one side where there is a reef or beach upon which the George from New London was wrecked a few years ago by Capt Destin. There is reason to believe that it is inhabited as well as St. Pauls. A light was seen upon it by the crew of the Armata. As a fishing ground it is considered superior to the other.

it stood at 29.2 inches the same as during the violent gale which we encountered sometime since. The wind however though fresh & strong & causing a rough sea has not been as violent by any means as we expected. The Capt has kept the topsails reefed in anticipation of a hard blow - At noon the barometer fell to 29.1 1/2 inches which is lower than it has been since we left home - But at the present time viz. three o. clock P.M. the weather looks fair & the wind  though strong is not violent. Thus far we are disappointed in our expectations of a severe gale. I suggested as a solution of the case at noon that we might be on the borders of such a gale & by our situation might escape the fury of the storm, though the barometer accurately indicates its existence.

9 o. clock in the morning. The barometer last evening continued to fall still lower until it stood at 28.9 inches. Between 6 o. clock & midnight the weather became cloudy & the atmosphere very moist & foggy and in the course of the night there was considerable rain. At the same time the wind changed to N.W. & gradually increased in violence. At the present time (9 A.M.) we are in the midst of a strong gale accompanied with a rough sea. The Capt last evening, not able to account for the state of the barometer and the comparative pleasantness of the weather seemed confident that some injury had been done to the instrument, by which the rising of the mercury had been prevented. The whole difficulty, however is now explained. The great dampness accompanying the storm accounts for the fact that the fluid falls so much lower than it did in the former gale, at which the sky was mostly clear. We are now under close reefed topsails, with the wind N.W. Barom. 28.8 inches - Thermom 57ø above zero off the S.W. coast of New Holland and steering E.S.E. by compass.

after  12 o. clock last night Mr. Chapel came to my stateroom & informed me that two of the men had just fallen from the forecastle deck & apparently had been seriously injured - Their name were Kirby & Turner. I went immediately forward & ascertained that Kirby on going on the forecastle to keep a lookout had been suddenly knocked back by the flapping of the foresail, & in endeavoring to save himself from falling he had jumped on deck. But in doing this he struck upon Turner who was standing below, & knocked him down & injured him slightly. he himself, however, was thrown with great violent upon his side on the hard deck & so severely shocked that it was a half hour or more before he could be brought to his senses. Upon my first seeing him  he appeared entirely insensible. At my suggestion a vessel of cold water was dashed into his face, when he instantly sprang & showed symptoms of life. he gradually came to, after that & to day with the  exception of soreness on the hip and shoulder appears to be nearly recovered. We feared that he might have been injured internally, but it would seem

Yesterday & last evening until midnight the Capt ventured to scud under close reefed topsails. About 12 o. clock the winds endanger the boats; the foresail & foretopsail were therefore furled and the ship made to lie to until 7 o. clock this morning. During the night the vessel rolled so excessively as to render it almost impossible to sleep in our berths. We shipped several tremendous seas, but providentially sustained no greater injury than to lose a barrel of porpoise oil which broke away from its lashings on deck & dashed about until the head was stove in. The waster also poured through the window in the steward's pantry and damaged a small quantity of flour and other provisions. Some injury also was done by the breaking of crockery, and I had the misfortune to lose my pitcher in my stateroom, by its being thrown out of its place & broken by the shock. In the course of the day the gale has gradually subsided & this evening it is comparatively moderate. Barometer at midnight last evening stood at 28.7 inches the greatest depression we have had since we sailed.

I notice that it is asserted in Olmstead's Natural Philosophy that dew does not fall upon the ocean. During our voyage in several instances after clear & cool nights I have observed the deck & rails of the ship & the bottoms of the boats coved with copious moisture, which appeared to me exactly to resemble dew. Conversing with Mr. Watrous the first Mate upon the subject, he states that he has frequently seen heavy dews in mid ocean after clear & cool nights & no doubt whatever of the frequent occurrence of the fact. Capt G. has observed them often on soundings, but seems not so confident of having seen them a very great distance from land - In the cases above mentioned we were several hundred miles at least from any land. I may perhaps be mistaken in respect to its being dew & it seems to be that the moisture alluded to is deposited upon a different principle from that of dew, yet my present impression is that the statement in the book is inaccurate. yesterday we noticed a ship ahead - To day we have overtaken her & are surprised to find her the Armata Capt Hull - We supposed  him to be at least a hundred miles astern. he run all night during the gale whilst we were lying to, and

The extreme depression of the mercury in our barometer for some days  past had led us to suspect some accident had occurred to it, but  Capt Hull informed us last evening that his also has been very low, lower indeed than he ever knew it before. We have indeed had bad weather the greater part of the time during this low state, high winds, gales & great dampness, still I should not be surprised to find that in parts of the ocean contiguous to us these have been very much more than here.

I have felt so unwell to day that I have omitted the Bible class exercise which I commenced in the Forecastle last Sabbath. I have spent most of the time in reading "Baxter's Call to the unconverted,, and also a portion of the "Saints rest,,. I know of no uninspired books which are so well adapted to promote spiritually as the practical works of Baxter. O that I possessed more of the spirit & character of that holy man & like him could constantly walk by faith & not by sight.

Since Wednesday last we have made on the whole but little progress -much of the time we have had either lights winds or calms or head winds. The weather with the single exception of Thursday has been cloudy & foggy, the dun appearing but a short time each day - I have been desirous of having clear sky, that I might complete the examination of the southern constellations. In the two months or more that we have been in southern latitudes the pleasant evenings have been like "angel's visits,, few & far between. My opportunities for examining the heavens have consequently been very limited. As we are now near 50ø South Latitude our days of course are long. It is nearly light enough to read at 3 o. clock in the morning & at 9 in the evening, and the twilight continues nearly throughout the night. The appearance of the sun & moon when on the meridian far in the north is at least to one unaccustomed to it quite singular. The moon, now about full is above the horizon but a few hours & at it's greatest elevation seems to be not more than two or three hours high & is very far to the north -

Last evening we discovered a ship and made for her with a view of speaking her, but a sudden squall prevented - this morning we approached and spoke her - she proved to be the Mary from New Bedford Capt Corey. he states that he has seen numerous whales in this neighborhood. Just before our speaking him his boat lowered & struck a right whale only a short distance from his ship. In a few moments we passed near the boats & saw them lance the whale and a short distance from his ship. in a few moments we passed near the boats & saw them lance the whale & saw the animal spout blood repeatedly - happened to be in my stateroom during the operation of lancing but coming on deck immediately after I witnessed the spouting of blood & saw the water far around deeply tinged with the purple streams flowing copiously from the deep would of the dying monster. Soon after Capt G. raised a whale from the poop deck; the boats were soon lowered & pursuit made, but having chased it until nearly noon, they found it impossible to get fast & therefore returned to the ship - this afternoon Capt G went to mast head & saw another but it soon disappeared

A little after 4 o. clock this afternoon the Capt returned to the ship with the news that they had killed two whales. The one seen at noon

 led them off a great distance where they fell in with three others of which they succeeded in capturing two - Of these the Capt struck one, and Mr Chapel the other. About eight o. clock this evening they got one alongside & secured him and the boats are now towing the other but are still at considerable distance from the ship. They will not probably reach us before  10 or 11 o. clock. The wind having subsided into a perfect calm we can do nothing by way of working the vessel towards them.

About 11 o. clock last evening the 2nd whale above mentioned was secured along side. The men were very much exhausted having rowed constantly for 11 hours in succession. The weather being pleasant & the wind light, the Capt permitted the whole crew with the exception of the four or five to sleep the remainder of the night. Before 5 o. clock this morning they commenced the operation of "cutting in,,. Before 7 bells

[end of page log343_216.gif]

at half past & which is the signal for breakfast, one of them was nearly dispatched, and the 2nd was finished in about 2 1/4 hours. Immediately after the last piece of blubber was secured whales were again announced the boats lowered & pursuit made, but without success. Again at dinner another was raised & soon after pursued but without  success. Those which we "cut in,, this morning were of the species denominated right whale. They were between forty & fifty feet in length and I should think between 10 & 12 feet in diameter in the largest part of the body. They were nearly equal in size. The shape is in many respects different from that of the sperm whale. They have no hump like the sperm , but have back nearly straight with the exception of a slight elevation near the spout holes situated about one fourth or one fifth of the length of the animal from the end of the head. They are furnished with two spout holes instead of one as in the sperm. These are situated as mentioned above some distance from the extremity of the head upon the back one on each side of the ridge of the back. The sperm whale on the contrary has but one & this is located near the end of 

[end of page log343_217.gif]

the head a little to the left of the ridge of the back - The right whale has no teeth & feeds upon a species of shrimp found floating in very great abundance in some parts of the ocean. The sperm has teeth & feeds upon squid and similar animals - Their habits also differ in important respects. The right whale usually remain under water less time than a Sperm and of course comes more frequently to the surface to blow - sometimes as often as once in 10 or 15 minutes - the sperm whale remain below the surface from 1/2 and hour to an hour, before he ascends for the same purpose. In feeding the right whale drop or opens the upper & front parts of his immense lips & forces his way through the feed, thus taking a great quantity into the cavity. This is filtered through the narrow interstice of the bone & received upon the enormous tongue ( by which I  suppose it to be slightly crushed & then swallowed) In cutting in the right whale a chain is first attached to one of the fins by which the animal is secured in place & kept near the surface. One of the lips is next cut

[end of page log343_218.gif]

off & hoisted aboard - After this either the scalp with the bone or the throat with the tongue is taken in according as it may be most convenient - The remaining lip is then taken and finally the throat & tongue or scalp & bone. The head having thus been secured in four parts the remaining blubber is taken in blanket pieces. The business of cutting into horse pieces  mincing, and boiling out is the substantially the same in both kinds. In conversing with the Capt & officers since writing the above respecting the use which the right whale makes of its tongue in feeding I find it to be their opinion that it does not crush its food at all & only employ its tongue in deporting the food from the water. Forcing the latter out between the openings and the bone &.c. - Thus after sailing nearly two months and over thousands of miles without seeing the spout of a right whale, we have fallen unexpectedly & suddenly amongst them and captured two at the first onset. The Capt had almost relinquished the hope of obtaining a right whale before  reaching the Islands-

At 9 o. clock this morning my attention was excited by a noise on deck. Going immediately upon the poop deck I saw at a distance of about half a mile a large whale in the act of breaching (as the whalemen term it) i.e. throwing his body out of the water nearly the entire length. Mr. Watrous the First Mate was close in pursuit. After throwing himself out of water 6 or 8 times the whale lay still upon the surface, when the boat approached & made fast. In an hour or two the

The mates had the precaution to attach the drags to the lines - these consist of square pieces of fine plank about a foot square with a line fastened through the center these when secured to the harpoon line greatly retard the progress of the whale. also show where he is when he submerges - After running below as long as possible he came up much exhausted & the Capt happening to be near approached & killed him .

In weight I should think the tongue would equal that of 3 or 4  large horses - The length of the arch containing the bone was nearly 2 feet - the longest pieces of bone were nearly 7 feet - the blubber was very fat & measured from 8 to 12 inches in thickness - Weather to day pleasant - wind fresh from the S.W.

Yesterday (Monday) we crossed the meridian opposite London - Having sailed East we of course have gained 12 hours upon Greenwich time. In order to avoid confusion in respect to the dates of places at which they may touch & also in using the tables of the nautical almanack, it is customary for navigators sailing east to give two days in succession the same name & the same ordinal number. Otherwise their dates will disagree with those of the port into which they may enter, & their calculation for Lat & Long. will also be erroneous. Captains of vessels are sometimes ignorant of this fact & make no alteration in their dates on crossing the meridian of 180ø whether bound East or West. The first time Capt Greene sailed around the world, he was ignorant of the matter and continued his reckoning as usual until (after doubling Cape Horn) he came near to St. Thomas an Island off the Eastern Coast of South America - He there fell in with another vessel whose dates disagreed with his. From the Capt of this vessel he learned how to remedy the difficulty In this way, we shall have two Mondays & eight days this week - foggy wind N.E. Steer S.E. 			Observ lat. 47ø 10' S.

hoped also to be able to see Raivavai or High Island on the other side, but the distance was too great. Where Tubuai was first observed it had the appearance of being composed of two separate Islands, as described in Ellis's Polynesian Researches, but as the vessel approached nearer, we could see that the elevated parts were united by a longer portion of land.  When opposite the island we were not probably more than 20 or 25 miles distant - It has been in sight on out Larboard side nearly all day - Last evening we had squalls accompanied with very sharp lightning. To day for the most part has been pleasant with the exception of flying clouds - Wind E.S.E. & rather light - Course N.W. Bowditch puts the latitude of Tubuai 23ø 25' S.

At 2 o. clock this morning the Island of Tahiti was discovered bearing about North - Its appearance was that of two Islands as described by Ellis - We coasted along the western shore for the purpose of passing between that & the Island of Eimeo[?] - Whilst at breakfast about 1/4 before 8 o. clock the Boatsteerers & shipkeeper surprised us greatly by rushing suddenly on deck  calling for water & saying the sail-room was on fire. Though the fire had already burnt several quite large holes through different sails & had burnt off some 15 or 20 of the stop ropes, still it was extinguished in a few minutes. Had it burnt a half an hour longer, without being discovered, in the opinion of the Capt & all the officers the ship must have been lost. Mr. Raymond the 2nd Mate with a few of the men, about 6

Upon a deliberate examination of the whole affair in a council of all the officers of the ship, the Capt in the course of the forenoon came to the conclusion that Philip Tully put the light into the sail room with the intention of burning the ship - some of the evidence I will state as another time - Philip was accordingly put in irons on suspicion of being the culprit. After this it - being calm, I went ashore with the Capt on Tahiti at a small mission station near the isthmus called Papar.

I intended to mention the fact before this, that soon after leaving Tahiti we caught several Bonettos or skipjacks as seamen call them - One was taken early in the morning & cooked immediately - All in the Cabin ate of it without experiencing any harm - Two others that were captured soon after the first were exposed to the sun for a few hours & then hung up over night in the Pantry, where the moon could not shine upon them.

3rd & 4th mates were seized with pains in the head & stomach - Their faces became red & purple, their heads & eyes swelled & they felt dizzy & sick at the stomach - They were soon relieved by drinking a small quantity of rum. The Capt, 2nd Mate, myself & the steward all partook of the same fish, and suffered no injury. I noticed in the journal of Tyerman & Bennet a statement of similar facts & an allusion to the common opinion that the poisonous qualities are imparted to these fish by the rays of the moon - In the present instance it would seem that the moon could have had no influence in producing such an effect. Olmstead thinks the poison is confined to particular parts of the fish & accounts for the fact that some are poisoned whilst others escape by supposing the individuals to partake of different portions. The injurious effects I believe are never lasting, nor very serious, at least in the case of the Bonetto. I am not acquainted with facts sufficient to hazard an opinion but it occurs to me that difference of constitution might perhaps have something to do in salving the difficulty - As in poisonous vines & vegetables some individuals are unaffected, whilst other suffer greatly. Perhaps also when taken fresh from the water & cooked immediately they are free from

I mentioned under the date of Sunday February 23d {1845/02/23}that I would at another time record some of the evidence upon which the Capt & officers decided to confine Philip Tully in irons. At the Trustine Islands Captn Reed has told Philip that one or two of the crew of the Canada had testified that he was the Ringleader and Plotter of the mutiny & other disorders on board his ship & that when he (Philip) arrived in the U.S.A. he should have him tried upon these charges. He also informed him that a statement of the case & depositions of witness had been sent home some time previous. Philip was much troubled with this intelligence & repeatedly conversed with the Boatsteerers & his shipmates upon the subject. In some of the conversations he said he should not return in the Morrison if he could help it. A short time before we reached Tahiti, Philip had quarreled & fought with Davis in the Forecastle. They bruised each others eyes & faces in such

[end of page log343_240.gif]

a manner as to carry the marks for several days. The Capt threatened to flag Philip if he should be concerned in another such a row - he had previously ascertained that he began the fight. After being thus threatened he told Dodge and I believe several others that the Capt would not whip him but once if he did at all. Philip had been at Tahiti before & knew that foreign vessels were frequently there - he also knew that it would be very difficult for him to run away at the Sandwich Islands without being apprehended. If he applied for a discharge he had reason to expect a refusal. We were now within a few miles of the shore & the weather calm & pleasant. There would be no difficulty in all getting safe ashore in the boats if the ship were destroyed. He would then have a good opportunity to ship aboard of some English or French vessel & thus avoid returning to the U.S. - A strong motive was therefore presented for setting fire to the ship - The getting out of the flour & obtaining the lamp at that early hour suggested the plan. Suddenly adopting it (as we suppose) when Mr. Raymond & the others were all out of the after hole & where they could not see him, he opened the door of the sail room, placed the lamp under a pile of sails & instantly closed it again - Some of the

[end of page log343_241.gif]

facts & statements before the council of Officers are the following - Mr. Raymond stated that he sent Philip into the steerage after the lamp, but having effected what he wished, without after using it, he ordered him to take it back again & hang it in its place. Rodgers the Boatsteerer was lying awake in the steerage; he saw Phil take down the lamp & carry it toward the run but did not see him return it. One of the men in the Forecastle (viz. Jared Rodgers) however states that he saw him take the lamp along the passage toward steerage but did not see him carry it in & hang it up as directed - The door of the sail room was closed. It was quite a distance from the hole & the way to it was obstructed by quite a number of casks. It was therefore a very inconvenient place to set the lamp, as he must first climb over tool chests, empty hogsheads & other lumber before reaching it. It could not therefore have been set in there just for a moment, with the design of taking it out afterward and restoring it to its place. The fact also that the door was shut closely after putting it under the pile of canvass in such a manner that the blaze of the lamp came immediately in contact with it is abundant proof that it was not done accidentally. The smell of burning

[end of page log343_242.gif]

cloth was perceived by Joseph Champlain at the Wheel, full half an hour before the discovery. He did not however mention it to any one. At 7 1/2 o. clock the boatsteerer sat down to breakfast - Whilst eating they were annoyed by the strong smell of burning cloth. They searched repeatedly but could not find the cause - At length they left the table & made a more thorough examination - On applying his hands to the door of the sail room Benjamin Hanson perceived it to be quite hot & immediately upon opening it the flames burst out and extended up to the cabin floor. Water was instantly applied & the fire extinguished. On charging Philip Tully with the crime his conduct & conversation to say the least were not such as we should expect from an innocent man - He begged to be discharged, used impudent language to the Capt, said he thanked God that nobody saw him put the lamp there, admitted that if he placed the lamp there, he did it with the intention of burning the ship, yet he asserted his own innocence. there was no other person on board (to our knowledge) who could be under the influence of a motive to commit such an act, so powerful as he. In

[end of page log343_243.gif]
 
respect to Byrne the shipkeeper & one or two others who were probably inimical to the Capt the facts in the case exempted them almost entirely from suspicion. I ought to mention that the remark of Philip that he should never return in the Morrison if he could avoid it & that the Capt would not flog him but once, were made know to us after the decision of the council to put him in irons. In this decision the Capt & all of the officers were unanimous - Mr. Raymond supposed that the time during which Philip put the lam into the sail room was immediately after taking out the flour - he Mr. R. & the other men there came upon deck leaving Philip & Jared Rodgers to put things in order, replace the steerage stairs &.c. &.c.- before coming up himself he directed Jared Rodgers to take the scoop & hang it up. Whilst R was doing this, he supposes Philip put the lamp into the sail room.

On Tuesday Feb 25th {1845/02/25}whilst the ship was lying off and on Capt G. myself as the principal witnesses went ashore at Papeet Bay with the intention of surrendering Philip Tully into the hands of the American Consul. At first the acting consul engaged to take charge of him & accordingly the Capt sent back the boat to obtain him. I would remark here that Mr. Black the Am Consul died a short time before we reached the Island - he appointed a substitute before his death & this substitute being absent on a distant port of the island had left an American Sea Captain to act in his stead. Soon after Capt G. had sent off for Philip the Vice Vice Consul discovered that he could not take him unless the ship came into the harbor & stopped a day or two

[end of page log343_245.gif]

and two men as witnesses also be left to be sent home with the accused. To this the Capt would not consent & therefore decided to take P. along with us to the Sandwich Islands - Where Philip was brought into the by & along side of the India where Capt G. & myself happened to be at the time & found he was not to be left he begged very earnestly that the Capt would permit him to go aboard of either the French or the English naval that was lying at anchor nearby. This was asking permission to do the very thing which we supposed he intended to do in case he had succeeded in burning the ship - Of course it corroborated our suspicions of his guilt. 
					I will have mention a few facts relating to the condition in which we found Tahiti. The French had taken possession. The Queen had left & gone to Raiatea. A large French man of war a Frigate & a French war steamer were lying at anchor in the bay. Also an English war steamer. French officers French Catholic priests & French Soldiers crowded the narrow streets or alleys as they may more properly be called and

[end of page log343_246.gif]

occupied a large number of the houses. Fewer French stores, bakeries, eating houses, Grog shops, &.c. were established - The English Consul had retired from Tahiti having sailed as we were informed  a week or two previous for the Sandwich Islands ) The French were erecting a large stone building ( I presume) for the purpose of a depot for ship stores &.c.&.c. - The better class of the natives especially those friendly to the Queen & the English had fled to the mountain & fortified themselves by erecting mud forts in the midst of their rocky fastness. There had been one or two skirmishes between the natives & the French Troops- In the last of these one of the English missionaries was killed. matter being in this condition, nothing scarcely is cultivated by the natives & the little that is produced or brought from the neighboring Islands commands an exorbitant price - the trade in this is also forestalled by the purveyors for the French Troops - At Papeete I was disappointed in finding every thing so much in the state of nature - There was little or no cleaned land. No fields of sweet potatoes, or Taro, or Sugar Cane or Indian Corn or yams were to be seen-  A few mud huts ( as we should call them) scattered along the shore constitute the whole settlement.

[end of page log343_247.gif]

Wild mountains & groves of the Breadfruit Vi orange, guava & various other tropical trees covering the level ground extending  a short distance from the sea, make up the remainder. Marks of filth & idleness appear at every step. In short there was nothing interesting or beautiful but the natural scenery & even this was far below my expectation. Ellis in his Polynesian researches so far as he describes the external appearance seems to be accurate, so also Tyerman & Bennett. And yet the entire impression which I obtained from reading these works (derived perhaps in part from their glowing accounts of the moral changes in the character of the natives) was too favorable. in particular the mountains were more naked & lofty & constituted a greater portion of the land than I expected. the level soil & the cultivated lands were less extensive. This also was true of Eimeo As a sample of the prices of articles, take the following. Fowls fifty cents each - Ducks 75 cents. Hogs from 8 to 10 or 12 dollars - very small pigs from one to two dollars - sweet potatoes & bread fruit not to be obtained for any price, or at least only in very small quantities without sending expressly for them to a great

distance. A small loaf of bread 12 1/2 cents - other things except some few spontaneous fruits in the same proportion. 
		We found at anchor here several Whalers E.G. the India Capt Miller about 120 Sperm & 40 or 50 bls right whale. Neptune Capt Oat 100 bls whale & the Jefferson Capt Harris 2 right whales - also the Congress and Millwood of New Bedford & the Mercury of Stonington also spoke the Thybee of Stonington standing off & on 450 bls. Those at anchor were repairing taking in water &.c. - Also saw some of the crew of a New Bedford whaler (name forgotten) wrecked a week or two previous, in going in to Raiatea one of the Society Islands. These were waiting for a passage home.

During last night the wind changed to  S. by W. and this morning early it blew strong from the S.W. attended with squalls. It gradually increased until 9 or 10 o. clock A.M. when it blew a fresh gale from S.S.W. - in this manner it has continued through the day driving in on at a rapid rate. We must now at 9. P.M. be nearly opposite the North end of Hawaii, but so far to the East that we have not seen it. Weather somewhat cloudy with occasional squalls - Course this forenoon N.W. by W.

Last evening the wind gradually subsided until it became almost a perfect calm - This continued for several hours - About 4 o clock this morning a very light wind sprang up from the N.W. directly in the eye of our course - This held us till 9 or 10  o. clock A.M. obliging us to steer S. Westerly upon one tack and N. Easterly upon the other. The remainder of the day has been nearly calm with occasional light breezes from the West permitting us to head North. We are greatly surprised to meet with such weather here. We are still opposite the North end of Hawaii but so far East as to be unable to see land. 
For three or four weeks past we have seen almost every day schools of flying fish around the ship, but scarcely anything else has been visible - But one spout of a whale has been observed & that of a finback

Yesterday the sun crossed the line. In obtaining our latitude we therefore now add the correction for the difference of longitude to the declination & add also the true declination thus obtained to the North Zenith distance. 
			Last night & throughout the entire day to day we had very pleasant weather with scarcely a breath of wind. Occasionally a very gentle breeze would spring up from the Eastward. We are still off the North end of Hawaii but unable to see it, having made in the last 24 hours only 8 miles northing & 10 of Westing.

Between 6 & 7 o. clock this morning we made the Island of Maui bearing a little North of West (say W. by N.) and some 30 miles distant. The portion of the Island first seen was the Eastern point - During the day we have been approaching it & at the same time coasting Northerly along its Eastern shore. At 7 o. clock this evening we are off the North end and but a few miles from the passage between Maui & Morokai, which last Island has also been in sight nearly all the Afternoon. We have thus missed of seeing Hawaii in consequence of being having been so far to the East. The weather this forenoon was quite pleasant, this afternoon cloudy - Wind light from the N.E. - course about N.N.W. or thereabout - Spoke this evening the ship Liverpool of N. Bedford & the ship Arab both New Bedford Erie of Fair Haven both bound to Maine.

Last night with a fair but moderate breeze we ran down the passage between Morokai & Maui. This morning before it was light we were within a few miles of the Anchorage opposite Lahaina. At sunrise we we counted about 40 vessels at anchor. Soon after, the wind died away & we made little or no progress until it sprang up this afternoon about 1 o. clock. We were then able to beat in against both wind & tide & came to, in the port of Lahaina about 1/2 past 4 o. clock. Opposite to this at a distance of about      miles is the small & barren island of Ranai. In coming down the passage we repeatedly had an indistinct view of of Hawaii. A few miles ahead was the isle of Kahulawe. In the distance at the Westward was Oahu. Thus six out of the ten comprising the group were seen by us in the space of an hour. 
We found 5 or 6 New London vessels at anchor. Captn Rice of the Isaac Hicks soon came on board and informed us that he had letters for us on board his vessel. He also mentioned the death of

the U.S. England & France for procuring the acknowledgement of the independence of this government. He stated as a reason for their going that unjust & oppressive exactions to the amount of nearly $30,000 had been made upon the King at different times by the Consul agents of the above mentioned governments. Difficulties also were frequently occurring between foreigners & the native authorities of which the consuls would take advantage to make unreasonable demands - In order to compel the king to compliance they would threaten to send home for vessels of war to some & take possession of the Islands. Or if vessels of war belonging to any of the above nations were stationed in the Pacific they threatened to send for them. In this manner Mr. Dudois the French Consul subsequently sent for Capt. Laplace. Mr. Charlton the English Consul & Jones the American at different times had made similar threats & in one instance one of these had even shaken his fist in the face of the King. With a view of terminating these troubles Mr. Richards secretly confirmed with the king and 

[end of page log343_274.gif]

a few of the chiefs upon the subject of an embassy to the above governments. At length the measure was resolved upon & himself & Halilio selected for Commissioners. To prevent those Consuls from writing to their Governments & thus endeavoring to defeat their object, they departed secretly, their business and departure having been known only to the king & a few confidential friends. They sailed from Lahaina in a small vessel belonging to a Capt. Bernard chartered by the Government on the 18th of July 1842 {1842/07/18}. At first they steered Northward until they passed considerable leeward the limits of the N.E. Trade winds where meeting with the variable winds they directed their course towards the coast of California. In thirty days they reached the coast just as their wood & water both exhausted - These had already failed them once or twice before but they had been providentially supplied wither by speaking other vessels, or by picking up driftwood. On approaching the coast he observed the well known but remarkable change in the color of the water. For many miles before coming upon

sounding the ocean was of a deep green color in appearance. They also saw numerous immense schools of small fish called sardines. Each school seemed to contain myriads & the surface of the water appeared actually to be alive with them. these were of the species that are packed by the French in tin cases or boxes & usually sold at very high prices as a great delicacy. 
They also observed a very singular sea-plant - It grew where the water was quite deep, perhaps in some areas a hundred feet  - the stock near the root was not more than an inch in diameter & nearly solid, but toward the surface it gradually became larger & more hollow. At the surface some of the stalks were three or four inches in diameter - The leaves were 15 or 20 feet long & from three or four to 9 or 10 inches wide & perfectly transparent & their texture very delicate. They came to on the coast at a place called St. Barbara. It was dangerous remaining there any length of time and being also Saturday, Mr. Richards & Halilio both labored hard during the whole day cutting wood, filling

the water cask &.c. in order to avoid spending the sabbath in so much unpleasant a place - Leaving St. B. they in a short time ran down the coast & entered the bay near Mazatlan. They here encountered a very violent squall by which their vessel & lives were greatly endangered - At one time they were driven within only a few feet of a very rocky shore, upon which had they struck probably all would have been lost. But having escaped this they at length reached Mazatlan in safety. Mazatlan is situated

This evening Mr. Richards continued the narrative of his journey. They were detained at Mazatlan eleven days engaged in obtaining their passports & procuring mules - They were furnished with two mules each, one for riding & the other for conveying their baggage. Their baggage was transported in trunks lashed securely to the backs of the animals. The trunks were also carefully covered with leather to prevent their being wet in fording rivers. He remarked that Mazatlan though having a very warm & sultry climate was comparatively healthy. The same was true of all places upon the Western coast of Mexico & South America compared with those of the same latitude upon the Eastern. For several days after setting out they passed over low & level land, abounding in swamps & marshes infested with gnats & musketoes & containing but very few inhabitants. The country also in that part has no roads & they pursued their course by means of the mule paths. They were attended with a guide who

[end of page log343_280.gif]

also acted as interpreter, with a cook & two men to take care of the mules. In a few days they arrived at San Blas a roadstead at the mouth of the river Santiago. This is a small place & is the port for Kepic a considerable city 60 miles in the interior. He represented Kepic as containing about 60,000 inhabitants. Most of the business in Mexico except mining is carried on by foreigners from the U.S. or from Europe. This was the case at this place. The merchants & manufacturers were almost all from abroad - Here they witnessed a very great procession  supposed to contain 50 or 60 thousand people on the occasion of removing an image of the Virgin Mary form one Cathedral to another - numbers crawled upon their hands & knees in honor of the image - From this place they proceeded to Guanaxuato[?] - (Respecting the pronunciation of this work be remarked that x in Mexican is sounded like our h. The name therefore is pronounced Gwnawhato). This is the greatest mining city in all Mexico. Its site is very rough & uneven & the whole surface is completely undermined by the excavations of the

workers. They visited the mines descending the principal shaft which is 1800 feet in depth - The ore is found in the rocks & is obtained by blasting - the fragments are broken by long poles with iron heads falling upon a kind of hopper made of very stout bulls hide perforated with holes - through these the fine fragments pass into a receiver below. From this they are transferred to a mill or some other machine in which they are thoroughly pulverized. The dust is then placed in a large pile in a safe enclosure, quicksilver & a small quantity of salt mixed with it & the whole compound thoroughly stirred up & wet with large quantities of water. In this state the entire mass remains a month or more until all the metal both gold & silver is united with the quicksilver. After this the whole is transferred into large vats where the dust not containing metal is washed out & drained off & a black conglomerate mass left deposited at the bottom.

This evening our School was honored by a visit from his majesty Kamehameha 3d accompanied by his Royal Highness the Premier whose name is John Young. They spent about an hour in social & agreeable conversation with Teachers & pupils. they could both speak English ( though quite imperfectly) so that I was able to converse with them to some extent. John Young is the son of the English sailor of the name of Young who assisted Kamhamha 1st in his wars. He was made Chief by the King & his descendants are now among the dignitaries of the nation. The present Premier is a fine looking & apparently an intelligent man - His complexion is considerably lighter than that of the race generally, thus evincing his foreign origin. He has recently been promoted to the office of Premier by his majesty the king. On the death of the late premier Puma, the selection of her succession according to the Constitution devolved upon the King. The King appears to be an amiable & agreeable man. In point of intelligence, I am told he is about equal to the best specimen of the

The scenery from the summit is truly beautiful, equal I think to anything I ever beheld. that of the valley as you approach the Kings place about 4 miles from the village, is also very rich - Upon further acquaintance I find that my first impressions of the Island were too unfavorable.

The soil is highly fertile & if well cultivated would doubtless sustain a population 10 or 12 times as great as it now does - I was pleased to hear the music of birds in the shrubbery & on the sides of the mountains as I walked along the narrow footpath.

This is the anniversary of the restoration of these Islands to the present King by Admiral Thomas two years since - In consequence of the misrepresentations of the British Consul, they were seized by Lord George Paulet & held under English rule for about six months; but on the arrival of a superior officer, they were again restored - The day has been observed as a season of fasting & prayer for the divine blessing upon the nation. This evening a large audience assembled at the native church under the care of Mr. Armstrong, & were addressed by his majesty the King, the Governor of this Island, by Mr. Wiley the Secretary for Foreign affairs by Mr. Armstrong & Mr. Richards - With the exception of Mr. Wiley's address they were all in the native language & of course unintelligible to me - Mr. Wiley's was in English & translated into native by Dr. Judd. He dwelt particularly upon the need of industry among the people.

We left home about 10 o. clock & arrived at the summit not far from 1 o. clock P.M.  The ascent was very steep & difficult.

His church is situated in the Northern part of the Town - It is constructed of adobies or bricks of sun dried earth, & covered with a grass roof. it is of great size, furnished with eight doors, & would accommodate two or three thousand hearers. It was so filled to day that a considerable number sat upon the mats on the floor & others stood around the windows on the outside. This was probably an unusually large audience, as many of Mr. Armstrong's people were present, he having no meeting to day in consequence of repairs going on in his church. this evening heard the Rev Mr. Damon preach an excellent sermon on drunkenness.

This evening Mr. Richards addressed the pupils continuing his account of his voyages & travels - he gave us some account of the remarks of Halilio upon various subjects. "Fishes in France (said H.) have legs and spend much of their time on land. They have great skill in music & spend the evening in singing for the people,, (In this remark he alludes to frogs which he regarded as a kind of fish. They grind their flour by wind & sails, but send their ships to sea without either - Some men talk with their hands, some write with their feet Houses (i.e. cars) with 40 or 50 people in them are seen travelling around the country so swift that a dog cannot overtake them; and one may travel very fast whilst sitting still on a house. Talk with their hands & write with their feet  (alluding to the deaf & dumb, & persons who having lost their hands had acquired the art of writing with their feet)
They burn black rocks instead of wood, and carry thunder & lightning about the streets as we do shows for the amusement of the people. People in Europe always love their Chiefs greatly after they are dead & the French are now building a house for Napoleon at an expense of $500,000. Water is so hard that you can walk or

					Sabbath February 8th 1846 {1846/02/08}
This morning the Revd Mr. Damon delivered a discourse upon the institution of the Sabbath. His text was in Genesis 2nd Chapter 2nd & 3d verses. He showed that the sabbath was appointed immediately after the creation of man & consequently was not a merely Jewish institution as maintained by Dr. Paley, but was designed for the whole human race. In applying the principle of the discourse to the business of whaling he said that neither owners nor Captains had any right to require their men to whale on the sabbath. In doing so they committed sin, so also did the seamen in thus violating the day though at the command of their officers. This evening he has been preaching upon the traffick in ardent spirits, though occasionally he included all intoxicating drinks. His text was from Habakkuk 2nd 15th "Woe unto him that giveth his neighbor drink, that pulleth thy bottle,, &.c. - He applied the doctrine of the text to the wholesale & retail venders & maintained there was no difference in their guilt.

The native was suspected to have maimed some of the cattle of Mr. Torbert and in attempting to seize him a scuffle ensued in which Mr. T. was thrown down - the native then ran away, but when at a distance of 10 or 2 rods Mr. T. ordered Mr. F to shoot him in the legs. He accordingly fired but the ball entered the lower part of the body & occasioned his death in the course of one or two days.
