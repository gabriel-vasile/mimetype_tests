<b><p>
	Objective:	</b>To prepare teachers to use the instructional materials
developed in conjunction with the New Explorers videotape of the same name and
introduce students, particularly minorities, to science as a career
possibility.
 <b><p>
	Description:	</b>Teachers have developed instructional materials to extend the
educational impact of <i>From Beneath the Ashes,</i> a videotape in the New
Explorers series.  Third, fourth and fifth grade students are able to
participate in related science activities, go on a field trip to Fermilab and
learn about the prairie from an interdisciplinary approach.  Workshops for
teachers and field trips for students are offered. 
<b><p>
Application Deadline:</b>  September 1 for fall workshop, January 1 for winter
workshop.  <p>

<b><p>
	Objective:	</b>To give students direct experience with the phenomena and
principles of science and technology.
<b><p>
	Description:	</b>Teachers attend a workshop to become familiar with basic
research principles used at Fermilab through the interactive learning stations
of the Leon M. Lederman Science Education Center and through interactive
classroom activities.  The classroom activities use a collection of traveling
learning tools which is available on loan to schools.  Teachers are able to
provide for their students a depth of insight and involvement with science that
cannot be matched in most regular classroom programs.  At least one teacher
from each school must attend the workshop in order to reserve the collection of
traveling learning tools.  Over 250 teachers have been trained in the
workshops; one teachers conduct the workshop.

<b>
	Objective:	</b>To enhance the teacher's astronomy background and increase the
use of inquiry-based astronomy materials in third through fifth grade
classrooms. 
<b><p>
	Description:	</b>Participants spend a Friday evening and all day Saturday
involved in hands-on activities designed to familiarize them and ultimately
their students with principles of astronomy.  Telescope basics are covered and
participants make their own telescope.  Also, participants receive a set of
activities and materials so workshop experience can be transferred directly
into the classroom with a minimum of expense and preparation time.  The
workshop incorporates a night sky observation session and presentation at the
Waubonsie Valley High School Planetarium to acquaint participants with such
topics as the coordinate system of the sky, seasonal changes of the sky,
locating familiar objects and constellations, the phases of the moon and the
movements of the planets.
<b><p>
Application Deadline:</b>  Call for current information.

	Objective:	</b>To provide educational support to schools and school districts.

<b><p>
	Description:	</b>Fermilab's Outreach Coordinator works with schools, either
individually or in groups, to design programs that support local science
education enhancement efforts.  Activities may include inservice plans,
consultation on curriculum and instructional projects, support for interaction
between educators and scientists and engineers, and programs for students.

<b><p>
	Objective:	</b>To support and enhance existing science education, introduce
science role models,  encourage students to study science, to demonstrate to
students how what they learn in school is applied in business and to reinforce
the importance of appropriate life skills in the business world.
<b><p>
	Description:	</b>Fermilab collaborates with a school district to provide
inservice opportunities for teachers and science experiences for students,
particularly those underrepresented in the fields of science, engineering and
technology.  Currently, partnerships exist with Simmons Middle School, Aurora
School District #131; Gary School, West Chicago School District #34; and Hubble
Middle School, Wheaton-Warrenville School District #200.
