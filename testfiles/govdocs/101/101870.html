        <p class="byline">By CHRIS COXE and GARY FITZPATRICK</p>
        <p>&quot;The Map Library in Transition,&quot; a two-day conference held
          at the Library last October, explored the future of map libraries and
          the ways in which the &quot;digital revolution&quot; in cartography
          and geography is changing the very nature of map libraries and the
        services they provide. </p>
        <p> Cosponsored by the Congress of Cartographic Information Specialists
          Associations and the Library's Geography and Map Division, the conference
          was also designed to provide map librarians with information about
          automated Geographic Information Systems (GIS) so that they can begin
          planning for the impact this method will have on cartographic and geographic
          information. </p>
        <p> GIS allows the user to work with many layers of geographic information
          and is revolutionizing the possibilities for map making. In addition
          to selecting the data they will work with, users can create an endless
          variety of maps by redefining the geographic area, the scale, the symbology
          and coloring, and the algorithms by which data are analyzed. </p>
        <h2>Keynote Speakers</h2>
        <p> Four keynote speakers touched on several themes that pervade discussions
          about map libraries and GIS today. </p>
        <p> Barbara Adele Fine, president of the Map Store Inc., in Washington,
          D.C., is worried about the future for marketing of paper map products.
          She observed that all major U.S. map producing firms have turned to
          GIS-based solutions for their cartographic production. Once their data
          bases are built, it is logical to expect these firms to market many
          products in electronic form that are now available only in paper, circumventing
          more traditional outlets like map stores. Consequently, many specialized
          paper map products may become more difficult to find. </p>
        <p> David Beddoe, the Washington, D.C., regional manager for Environmental
          Systems Research Institute Inc., focused on the ability of GIS systems
          to work with information that in the past would never have been a part
          of a map library. He pointed out that any form of information that
          has a geographic component, such as a ZIP code, address, or county
          name, can be displayed in map form in a GIS. Map libraries will, therefore,
          find themselves working with data sets from a wide range of disciplines. </p>
        <p> &quot;The ability to analyze virtually any type of information in
          a cartographic environment is one of the driving forces behind the
          rapid growth of the GIS industry,&quot; Mr. Beddoe said. </p>
        <p> &quot;Geographic Information in the Research Library of the 21st
          Century&quot; was the topic addressed by Larry Carver, director of
          the Map and Imagery Laboratory in the library of the University of
          California at Santa Barbara. With GIS, said Mr. Carver, &quot;it is
          clear that there will be no hours of service, and access to information
          will be more important than ownership of it.&quot; </p>
        <p> Librarians will still have a role to play in such an environment,
          however, according to Carver: &quot;It is important that map librarians
          conserve resources by coordinating the collecting of digital data and
          the conversion of existing paper maps.&quot; Map librarians still need
          to be involved in GIS evaluation, testing, production and training,
          Mr. Carver added. </p>
        <p> The final keynote speaker, Ronald Abler, executive director of the
          Association of American Geographers, described the  &quot;Essential
          Skills for GIS Competency in the Year 2000.&quot; </p>
        <p> Dr. Abler pointed out that most curricula now offer only a single
          GIS course that is too focused on a single application or software
          package. He said he expects this approach to change, with the focus
          shifting to manipulation, analysis, and decision making. </p>
        <p> &quot;In 10 years,&quot; he said, &quot;network navigation will be
          an absolutely essential skill for geographers and cartographers.&quot; </p>
        <h2>Participants' Concerns</h2>
        <p> Other participants in the two-day conference made their own points
          about how the digital revolution is challenging map librarians. </p>
        <p> Chris Baruth, from the American Geographical Society Collection at
          the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, said that libraries with high
          space requirements and information systems that are not well understood
          are already vulnerable. The logical solution to this problem, digital
          cartography, often requires more expensive equipment than these libraries
          can generally afford. </p>
        <p> As GIS is more heavily used in map libraries, the focus on maps shifts
          from their form to their function. Map libraries allow people to view
          maps as artifacts (form) or as carriers of spatial information (function).
          With GIS, map libraries will be used less for their form and more for
          their function. </p>
        <p> Focusing on the function of map libraries instead of the form means
          that the library can be anywhere that a personal computer can connect
          to it. Thornton P. McGlamery of the University of Connecticut said
          the map library is &quot;not just in the basement anymore.&quot; A
          Local Area Network (LAN) becomes the file server on a network, thereby
          connecting information held in the library with anyone on the LAN. </p>
        <p> The number of users on digital networks is increasing skyrocketing
          All these users will eventually be able to access geographic information
          held in libraries around the world from their own homes through a network
          such as Internet. Mr. McGlamery asked, &quot;Will anyone come to the
          map library anymore?&quot; </p>
        <p> People will continue to visit map libraries, but for different reasons.
          With GIS in place, people will go to map libraries more often for training
          and archival curiosity than for data research. </p>
        <p> GIS is growing fast, but most of these developments in the digital
          revolution have yet to be implemented. According to a survey by the
          Congress of Cartographic Information Specialists Associations, reported
          at the conference by Alberta Wood of Memorial University in St. John,
          Newfoundland, only 46 percent of American academic libraries currently
          hold digital data. The most frequently cited reason for the absence
          of digital data is lack of funds. </p>
        <h2>Geography and Map Plans for GIS</h2>
        <p> Although the Library of Congress is also operating under budgetary
          constraints, the funding of electronic initiatives is a priority for
          the institution. Ralph Ehrenberg, chief of the Library's Geography
          and Map Division, discussed four initiatives under way in the division. </p>
        <p> The first is to develop GIS reference capability by creating a systems
          specialist position and acquiring the needed software. This will allow
          the division to create maps on demand for Congress. </p>
        <p> Second, the division plans to use GIS technology to create graphic
          indexes for more than 2 million of the almost 4 million maps in the
          Geography and Map Division that lack bibliographic control. Those already
          cataloged will be integrated into the system as well. </p>
        <p> The third initiative is to assist in establishing and distributing
          standards for digital data. This will be done by working closely with
          the Federal Geographic Data Committee, an interagency group working
          to coordinate the production and dissemination of digital spatial data
          in the federal government. </p>
        <p> Finally, the Geography and Map Division wants to establish a center
          for GIS. This would involve converting the division from a paper environment
          to an electronic one to extend its service to users beyond its congressional
          constituency. </p>
        <h2>Group Discussions</h2>
        <p> During the evening of the first day, attendees met in four groups
          to discuss various themes raised during the conference. They covered
          such issues as the hardware and software that is needed to equip a
          map library to handle spatial data sets, the training that will be
          needed to become conversant with this new discipline, communicating
          the needs of the map library to library directors and administrators
          and defining the inventories and services of the future map library.
          The results of these sessions were shared at the closing portion of
          the conference. </p>
        <h2>Federal Agencies and GIS</h2>
        <p> On the second day of the conference, attendees had the chance to
          discuss the role of digital spatial data with key officials of federal
          agencies, including the Government Printing Office, the U.S. Geological
          Survey, the Census Bureau and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
          Agency. The representatives of these cartographic agencies all noted
          that production of many basic types of paper maps, such as topographic
          quadrangles and nautical charts, will be supplanted by digital data
          sets by the end of this century. The Census Bureau, for instance, relied
          completely on digital mapping to govern the collection of data for
          the 1990 census. </p>
        <h2>GIS Demonstrations</h2>
        <p> Compelling demonstrations of the power of GIS were given by a number
          of federal agencies on the second day of the conference. The Environmental
          Protection Agency, the Census Bureau, the Agriculture Department and
          several units of the Defense Department showed ways in which they use
          GIS. From these exhibits, it was clear that GIS is an important tool
          in understanding environmental issues and regulating activities that
          can have an impact on it. </p>
        <p> The conference, organized by Christopher Baruth of the American Geographical
          Society Collection at the University of Wisconsin- Milwaukee, and Gary
          Fitzpatrick of LC's Geography and Map Division, concluded with an &quot;open
          microphone&quot; for conference attendees and a final summary by Edward
          Dahl of the National Archives of Canada. Although many frustrations
          had been expressed about the complexity of dealing with GIS in a library
          setting, attendees agreed that important concepts had been discussed
          and that the conference was the largest assembly yet dedicated to this
          issue. </p>
