	  <h1>Why Explore?</h1>	
	  <p><strong>1834 - Hassler's Guiding Principle</strong></p>
	  <p>Ferdinand Hassler, founder of the United States Coast Survey, lived his
	    life by the precept that it was &ldquo;the duty of every man to be honest
	    and to do good.&rdquo; Hassler&rsquo;s philosophy of life is as pertinent
	    today as it was nearly 200 years ago and serves as a driving force for the
	    men and women engaged in ocean exploration and other scientific endeavors.
	    In Hassler, F. R. 1834. Principal Documents Published by F.R. Hassler, New
	    York, printed by William van Norden. p.1.</p>
	  <p><strong>1843 - Forbes Challenges All to Prove Him Wrong and Thus Sells the Study
	    of the Sea</strong></p>
	  <p>&quot;... I have put forward several generalizations which to many may
	    appear to be founded on inductions drawn from too limited a number of facts.
	    The objection is to a certain extent true.... In the present state of the
	    subject speculation is unavoidable, and indeed necessary for its advancement.
	    If it be as important as the author believes, further researches are imperatively
	    called for; and since this branch of inquiry , as at present conducted,
	    may be said to have originated entirely with the British Association, he
	    hopes that through encouragement afforded by that body, other and abler
	    observers may be induced to enter the field, one in which the laborers require
	    support, involving as it does time, expense and personal risk. Should the
	    officers of the Navy and the members of the Yacht Clubs take an interest
	    in the subject, much might be done through their aid. To the surveying service
	    the author from experience looks forward confidently for most valuable observations.
	    Since questions of importance to navigation and commerce are intimately
	    connected with this inquiry, it is not too much to look forward eventually
	    to government for its support....&rdquo; In &ldquo;Report on the Mollusca
	    and Radiata of the Aegean Sea, and on their distribution , considered as
	    bearing on Geology.&rdquo; (1843) by E. Forbes. Published in Report of the
	    Thirteenth Meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science
	    Held at Cork in August 1843 Published by john Murray, London. p. 179.<br />
	    1859 - The Joy of Discovery</p>
	  <p>&quot;The difficulties which attend the inquiry add to the zest of the
	    research; and there is a charm in traveling mentally over the hills and
	    valleys buried inaccessibly beneath their thick atmosphere of brine, unbreathable
	    by mortal lungs ....But, beneath the waves, there are many dominions yet
	    to be visited, and kingdoms to be discovered; and he who venturously brings
	    up from the abyss enough of their inhabitants to display the physiognomy
	    of the country, will taste that cup of delight, the sweetness of whose draught
	    those only who have made a discovery know. Well do I remember the first
	    day when I saw the dredge hauled up after it had been dragging along the
	    sea-bottom at a depth of more than one hundred fathoms.&rdquo; In &ldquo;The
	    Natural History of the European Seas&rdquo; (1859) by E. Forbes, posthumously.
	    Published by John Van Voorst, London. p. 10-11.</p>
	  <p><strong>1923 - On the Challenger Expedition</strong></p>
	  <p>&quot;It has been said that the Challenger expedition will rank in history
	    with the voyages of Vasco da Gama, Columbus, Magellan, and Cook. Like these,
	    it added new regions of the globe to our knowledge, and the wide expanses
	    thus opened up for the first time &mdash; the floors of the oceans ----
	    were vaster than the discoveries of any previous exploration.&rdquo; In
	    Founders of Oceanography and Their Work (1923) by Sir W. Herdman. Published
	    by London, E. Arnold &amp; Co. p. 46.</p>
	  <p><strong>1923 - The Excitement of Discovery</strong></p>
	  <p>&quot;At first when the dredge came up, every man and boy who could possibly
	    slip away, crowded round it, to see what had been fished up. Gradually,
	    as the novelty of the thing wore off, the crowd became smaller and smaller
	    ... and as the same tedious animals kept appearing from the depths in all
	    parts of the world, the ardour of the scientific staff even abated somewhat,
	    and on some occasions the members were not all present at the critical moment,
	    especially when this occurred in the middle of dinner-time, as it had an
	    unfortunate propensity of doing. It is possible even for a naturalist to
	    get weary of deep-sea dredging. Sir Wyville Thomson&rsquo;s enthusiasm never
	    flagged, and I do not think he ever missed the arrival of the net at the
	    surface.&rdquo; Professor Moseley in &ldquo;Notes of a Naturalist on the
	    Challenger, p. 501. As quoted by Sir William Herdman in Founders of Oceanography
	    and Their Work (1923). Published E. Arnold &amp; Co., London. p. 48.</p>
	  <p><strong>1926 - British Pride</strong></p>
	  <p>&quot;The publicity given to the Challenger Expedition created an emulative
	    spirit among other nations; hence the United States and Germany followed
	    suit almost immediately. One or two other nations then took up the research.
	    Sir George Nares&rsquo; Arctic expedition started before the return of the
	    Challenger. Peary&rsquo;s work north of Greenland, and Nansen&rsquo;s great
	    drift in the Fram across the Polar Sea, developed ocean research in new
	    fields and led to attention being directed to the only unexplored region
	    left -- viz., the Antarctic continent. Whilst England through Scott, Bruce,
	    and Shackleton took the leading part in commencing to chart the Antarctic
	    continent, many other nations have contributed to ocean research in southern
	    latitudes.&ldquo;Thus in the past fifty years man has for the first time
	    in history set himself to explore thoroughly the globe he lives on. That
	    the ocean has received good attention is proved by the fact that up to 1912
	    about 6,000 soundings have been made in depths greater than 1,000 fathoms.
	    Of these, 491 were in depths greater than 3,000, and 46 in depths greater
	    than 4,000 fathoms.&rdquo; In Nature Notes for Ocean Voyagers (1926) by
	    A. Carpenter and D. W. Barker, 2nd edition. Published by Charles Griffin,
	    London. p. 2.</p>
	  <p><strong>1926 - Communication with Our Sister Planets</strong></p>
	  <p>William Beebe on the excitement of ocean exploration: &quot;When ... we
	    realize the possibilities of deep sea life still unknown to us, every haul
	    of the dredge should be welcomed by an expectant enthusiasm equaled in other
	    fields only by the possible hope of communication with our sister planets.&quot; In
	    The Arcturus Adventure by (1926) William Beebe. Published by G. P. Putnam's
	    Sons, New York. p. 363.</p>
	  <p><strong>1932 - Planning and Important Routine in Ocean Exploration</strong></p>
	  <p>&quot;The story of the expedition is a record of diligent and continuous
	    application to duty on a pre-arranged schedule. But few passages will be
	    found describing the wonders or terrors of the deep, and but few romantic
	    pages of brilliant exploits of physical daring - for the simple reason that
	    the cruise was carefully planned to avoid digressions that might interrupt
	    the discharge of important routine. How faithfully and loyally the plans
	    and observations were carried out by each and every one concerned on board
	    the vessel is abundantly evidenced by the vast number of observations made,
	    samples collected, and data derived, the discussion of and the interpretations
	    from which are real contributions to the physics of the Earth - geophysics.&rdquo; In
	    the foreword to The Last Cruise of the Carnegie (1932) by J. Harland Paul.
	    Foreword written by John A. Fleming. Published by the Williams and Wilkins
	    Co., Baltimore. p. xvii.</p>
	  <p><strong>1932 - The Value of Knowledge of the Oceans</strong></p>
	  <p>&quot;Aside from its importance to many branches of science, a knowledge
	    of the oceans has a practical value for mankind. The intelligent development
	    of our fishing industries, the laying of oceanic cables, the proper construction
	    of harbor-works, oceanic commerce and navigation, as well as long-range
	    weather forecasting, are all dependent on an understanding of the ocean.&rdquo; In
	    The Last Cruise of the Carnegie (1932) by J. H. Paul. Published by The Williams
	    and Wilkins Co., Baltimore. p. 36.</p>
	  <p><strong>1932 - Enormous Areas Still Unexplored</strong></p>
	  <p>&quot;The configuration of the ocean-floor is of great interest to seismologists
	    studying the movements of the Earth&rsquo;s crust. Oceanographers are also
	    able to explain certain peculiarities of ocean currents by the contour of
	    the ocean-bed. But enormous areas are still unexplored.&rdquo; In The Last
	    Cruise of the Carnegie (1932) by J. H. Paul. Published by The Williams and
	    Wilkins Co., Baltimore. p. 40.</p>
	  <p><strong>1932 - The Ocean Planet</strong></p>
	  <p>&ldquo;&quot;o indicate how large a part of the Earth is covered by the
	    oceans, we might call attention to the fact that a whole hemisphere, with
	    its center near New Zealand, would have only one-tenth of its area as dry
	    land! And the average depth of the seas is over two miles.&rdquo; In The
	    Last Cruise of the Carnegie (1932) by J. H. Paul. Published by The Williams
	    and Wilkins Co., Baltimore. p. 36.</p>
	  <p><strong>1934 - The Society of Wonderers</strong></p>
	  <p>&quot;Instead of gazing down through water buckets and glass-bottomed boats,
	    in addition to watching the fish milling about in aquariums, get a helmet
	    and make all the shallows of the world your own. Start an exploration which
	    has no superior in jungle or mountain; insure your present life and future
	    memories from any possibility of ennui or boredom, and provide yourself
	    with tales of sights and adventures which no listener will believe - until
	    he too has gone and seen, and in turn has become an active member of the
	    Society of Wonderers under-sea.&quot; In Half Mile Down by (1934) by William
	    Beebe. Published by Cadmus Books, E. M. Hale and Company, Chicago. p. 86.</p>
	  <p><strong>1948 - The Ocean and the Moon I</strong></p>
	  <p>&quot;Man&rsquo;s perpetual curiosity regarding the unknown has opened
	    many frontiers. Among the last to yield to the advance of scientific exploration
	    has been the ocean floor. Until recent years much more was known about the
	    surface of the moon than about the vast areas that lie beneath three-fourths
	    of the surface of our own planet.&rdquo; In Submarine Geology (1948) by
	    F. P. Shepard. p. 1.</p>
	  <p><strong>1951 - Mystery of the Sea</strong></p>
	  <p>&quot;We can only sense that in the deep and turbulent recesses of the
	    sea are hidden mysteries far greater than any we have solved.&rdquo; In
	    The Sea Around Us (1951) by R. Carson. p. 133. Oxford University Press,
	    New York.</p>
	  <p><strong>1951 - The All Encircling Sea</strong></p>
	  <p>&quot;Eventually man, too, found his way back to the sea. Standing on its
	    shores, he must have looked out upon it with wonder and curiosity, compounded
	    with an unconscious recognition of his lineage. He could not physically
	    re-enter the ocean as the seals and whales had done. But over the centuries,
	    with all the skill and ingenuity and reasoning powers of his mind, he has
	    sought to explore and investigate even its most remote parts, so that he
	    might re-enter it mentally and imaginatively. &ldquo;He fashioned boats
	    to venture out on its surface. Later he found ways to descend to the shallow
	    parts of its floor, carrying with him the air that, as a land mammal long
	    unaccustomed to aquatic life, he needed to breathe. Moving in fascination
	    over the deep sea he could not enter, he found ways to probe its depths,
	    he let down nets to capture its life, he invented mechanical eyes and ears
	    that could re-create for his senses a world long lost, but a world that,
	    in the deepest part of his subconscious mind, he had never wholly forgotten.</p>
	  <p>&quot;And yet he has returned to his mother sea only on her own terms.
	    He cannot control or change the ocean as, in his brief tenancy of earth,
	    he has subdued and plundered the continents. In the artificial world of
	    his cities and towns, he often forgets the true nature of his planet and
	    the long vistas of its history, in which the existence of the race of men
	    has occupied a mere moment of time. The sense of all these things comes
	    to him most clearly in the course of a long ocean voyage, when he watches
	    day after day the receding rim of the horizon, ridged and furrowed by waves;
	    when at night he becomes aware of the earth&rsquo;s rotation as the stars
	    pass overhead; or when, alone in this world of water and sky, he feels the
	    loneliness of his earth in space. And then, as never on land, he knows the
	    truth that his world is a water world, a planet dominated by its covering
	    mantle of ocean, in which the continents are but transient intrusions of
	    land above the surface of the all-encircling sea.&rdquo; In The Sea Around
	    Us (1951) by R. Carson. p. 15. Oxford University Press, New York.</p>
	  <p><strong>1953 - The Siren Songs of the Ocean Bed</strong></p>
	  <p>&quot;... those who have once listened to the siren songs of the ocean
	    bed never return to land.&quot; In The Undersea Adventure (1953) by Philippe
	    Diole. Published by Julian Messner, Inc., New York. p. 4.</p>
	  <p><strong>1961 - Humankind's Survival and the Sea</strong></p>
	  <p>&quot;Knowledge of the oceans is more than a matter of curiosity. Our very
	    survival may hinge upon it.&rdquo; President John F. Kennedy, Jr., March
	    1961 message to Congress.</p>
	  <p><strong>1966 - Waters of the Global Sea</strong></p>
	  <p>&quot;As man continues to break away from his Earth, as interplanetary
	    travel becomes a reality and we earthlings are able to view our planet from
	    the vast reaches of space, we will realize just how much of the earth is
	    in fact covered with the waters of the global sea.&rdquo; In Deep Challenge
	    (1966) by H. B. Stewart. Published by Van Nostrand, NJ. p. 1.</p>
	  <p><strong>1966 - One Global Sea</strong></p>
	  <p>&quot;If in the past we have been prone to limit our geographical thinking
	    to the land areas, we have been equally guilty of thinking of the ocean
	    as something other than a single world-girdling sea. Such phrases as &ldquo;the
	    seven seas&rdquo; and &ldquo;the oceans&rdquo; imply that, in addition to
	    the seven continents, there are several separate and distinct oceans or
	    seas. The sea is, in fact, one global sea.&rdquo; In Deep Challenge (1966)
	    by H. B. Stewart. Published by Van Nostrand, NJ. p. 6.</p>
	  <p><strong>1966 - The Lure of the Unknown</strong></p>
	  <p>&quot;Probably the greatest enticement for those who today are devoting
	    their lives to the study of the sea is the lure of the unknown, the challenge
	    of the undiscovered, the thrill of discovery on what is truly the last frontier
	    on earth.&rdquo; In Deep Challenge (1966) by H. B. Stewart. Published by
	    Van Nostrand, NJ. p. 7.</p>
	  <p><strong>1966 - The Last Great Challenge of Exploration</strong></p>
	  <p>&quot;Only the ocean remains as the last great unexplored portion of our
	    globe; so it is to the sea that man must turn to meet the last great challenge
	    of exploration this side of outer space.&rdquo; In Deep Challenge (1966)
	    by H. B. Stewart. Published by Van Nostrand, NJ. p. 9.</p>
	  <p><strong>1966 - The Interaction of Ocean and Atmosphere</strong></p>
	  <p>&quot;Perhaps, to man, the most important interdependence of the sea and
	    the land is through their interaction with the overlying atmosphere.&rdquo; In
	    Deep Challenge (1966) by H. B. Stewart. Published by Van Nostrand, NJ. p.
	    11.</p>
	  <p><strong>1966 - Lewis and Clark Comparison I</strong></p>
	  <p>&ldquo;The condition of our maps of the deep sea, however, is about comparable
	    to the maps of North America at the time of the Lewis and Clark Expedition
	    at the beginning of the Nineteenth Century.&rdquo; In Deep Challenge (1966)
	    by H. B. Stewart. Published by Van Nostrand, NJ. p. 13.</p>
	  <p><strong>1966 - Last Great Untapped Resource</strong></p>
	  <p>&quot;Man, in his typical wasteful way, has managed to consume his natural
	    resources on land at a rate that is already making him turn to the sea as
	    his last great relatively untapped resource on earth.&rdquo; In Deep Challenge
	    (1966) by H. B. Stewart. Published by Van Nostrand, NJ. p. 14.</p>
	  <p><strong>1966 - The Potential of the Self-Renewing Resources of the Sea</strong></p>
	  <p>&quot;Today man is a hunter of food in the sea, even as his ancestors were
	    hunters of food on land. On land, however, he has by now learned to raise
	    livestock and to farm his fields. He has become a farmer rather than a hunter.
	    Not until he becomes a farmer of the seas, until he is as well versed in &lsquo;aquaculture&rsquo; as
	    he now is in agriculture, will he begin to realize the great potential of
	    the self-renewing food resources of the global seas.&rdquo; In Deep Challenge

	  <p><strong>1966 - The Necessity to Understand the Sea</strong></p>
	  <p>&quot;But the influence of the sea on man&rsquo;s daily life and on his
	    future well-being is so great and still so poorly comprehended that the
	    sea must be explored, studied, and understood so that it can be taken into
	    account more intelligently whenever man is faced with any problem relating
	    to his physical environment.&rdquo; In Deep Challenge by (1966) H. B. Stewart

	  <p><strong>1969 - The International Decade of Ocean Exploration</strong></p>
	  <p>&quot;The term &lsquo;International Decade of Ocean Exploration&rsquo; can
	    be interpreted very broadly.... A broad statement of the basic objectives
	    of the Decade was developed as follows:</p>
	  <p>To achieve more comprehensive knowledge of ocean characteristics and their
	    changes and more profound understanding of oceanic processes for the purpose

	    of descriptive products such as those described by the National Academy
	    of Sciences Committee on Oceanography in its suggestions for ocean-wide
	    surveys, or those produced by the Environmental Science Services Administration
	    Coast and Geodetic Survey in its SEAMAP program.&rdquo; In An Ocean Quest
	    - The International Decade of Ocean Exploration (1969) National Academy
	    of Sciences. National Academy of Sciences, Washington DC. p. 42.</p>
	  <p><strong>1984 - The New Frontier</strong></p>
	  <p>&quot;The ocean floor is the new frontier of earth exploration.&rdquo; In &quot;Deep-Sea
	    Hot Springs and Cold Seeps&rdquo; (1984) by M. G. Gross. Published in &ldquo;Oceanus&rdquo;,
	    Vol. 27, Number 3, Fall 1984, p. 3.</p>
	  <p><strong>1984 - Lewis and Clark Comparision II</strong></p>
	  <p>&quot;Thus our exploring of the ocean floor in the newly proclaimed Exclusive
	    Economic Zone is comparable to Lewis and Clark exploring the west.&rdquo; In &quot;Deep-Sea
	    Hot Springs and Cold Seeps&quot; (1984) by M. G. Gross. Published in Oceanus,
	    Vol. 27, Number 3, Fall 1984, p. 3.</p>
	  <p><strong>1998 - The Last Unexplored Frontier</strong></p>
	  <p>&quot;The ocean remains as one of Earth&rsquo;s last unexplored frontiers.
	    It has stirred our imaginations over the millenia and has led to the discovery
	    of new of new lands, immense deposits and reservoirs of resources, and startling
	    scientific findings. The presence of the human eye and the human ability
	    to sample and to conduct experiments from the coastal regions to the deep
	    ocean abyss has provided answers to questions on critical issues as global
	    change, waste disposal, mineral deposits, and the creation of life itself.
	    In spite of the development of new technologies, comparatively little of
	    the ocean has been studied. The leadership role of the United States has
	    been eroded by a gradual decrease in funding support in spite of public
	    opinion polls that indicate that ocean exploration is more important than
	    space studies. As exciting and enlightening as ocean discoveries have been,
	    they will pale in comparison to future discoveries.&rdquo; In &ldquo;Executive
	    Summary: The Legendary Ocean - The Unexplored Frontier&quot; in Year of
	    the Ocean Discussion Papers (March 1998). U.S. Department of Commerce, the
	    Under Secretary for Oceans and Atmosphere: Office of the Chief Scientist,
	    NOAA, U.S. Department of Commerce. p. L-2.</p>
	  <p><strong>1998 - Future Ocean Exploration</strong></p>
	  <p>&quot;Ocean exploration gives mankind a sense of human progress and heritage.
	    It provides the experience and knowledge necessary to undertake stewardship
	    of the ocean and its resources, and thus sets a course for future generations
	    to navigate. What lies ahead is still unknown. Whatever it is, however,
	    will be influenced by what is found through tomorrow&rsquo;s exploration &ndash; and,
	    will likely be different than today&rsquo;s predictions!&rdquo; In &quot;Executive
	    Summary: The Legendary Ocean - The Unexplored Frontier&quot; in Year of
	    the Ocean Discussion Papers (March 1998). U.S. Department of Commerce, the
	    Under Secretary for Oceans and Atmosphere: Office of the Chief Scientist,
	    NOAA, U.S. Department of Commerce. p. L-12.</p>
	  <p><strong>2001 - The Ocean and the Moon II</strong></p>
	  <p>&quot;We know what the surface of the moon is better than we know what
	    the surface of the sea floor is.&rdquo; James Gardner, as quoted by M. Barber
	    in &ldquo;Hydrographic crew surveys underwater quake damage&rdquo; in the
	    Seattle Post-Intelligencer Reporter (March 21, 2001).</p>
