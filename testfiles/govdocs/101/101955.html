                Note: this Situation Report updates previous Central Asia Task 
                Force Situation Reports and Fact Sheets. <br>
                <br>
                <b>BACKGROUND</b><br>
                Two decades of war in Afghanistan, including a decade-long Soviet 
                occupation and ensuing civil strife, left Afghanistan impoverished 
                and mired in an extended humanitarian crisis. Government infrastructure, 
                including the ability to deliver the most basic health, education, 
                and other social services, collapsed. Severe restrictions by the 
                Taliban, including a restriction on women working outside the 
                home, added to the impact of poverty, particularly on the many 
                households lacking able-bodied adult men. A devastating regional 
                drought compounded the crisis, drying up wells, parching agricultural 
                land, killing off livestock, collapsing rural economies, and eventually 
                exhausting the coping mechanisms of many ordinary Afghans, forcing 
                them to leave their homes in search of food and water. </p>
              <p>International relief agencies, with support from the United States 
                (U.S.), have long been active in providing humanitarian assistance 
                to the Afghan people, even during the restrictive years of the 
                Taliban. On October 7, 2001, a Coalition-led military campaign 
                against al-Qaeda and Taliban forces began, and by December 2001, 
                the Taliban had collapsed. The new Afghan Interim Authority (AIA) 
                was sworn in on December 22, 2001, increasing humanitarian access 
                to the country and beginning the process of reconstruction. Tens 
                of thousands of refugee and internally displaced families have 
                started to return to their homes to assist in the rebuilding. 
                The U.S. Agency for International Development's Disaster Assistance 
                Response Team (USAID/DART), which began its emergency coordination 
                work in response to the regional drought in June 2001, continues 
                to assess the humanitarian needs of vulnerable Afghans, and to 
                monitor the relief programs of its implementing partners.</p>

              <p> <b>CURRENT SITUATION</b><br>
                Overview. The first phase of the Loya Jirga process continued 
                this week, as 11 more districts convened to select representives. 
                Outbursts of factional fighting were reported in several areas 
                of the country. Insecurity and the crisis of refugees waiting 
                in no man's land continues at the Chaman border crossing. On April 
                23, heavy rains in Badghis Province caused flooding, killing two 
                and disrupting programs of assisted return. Locust eradication, 
                supported by USAID/OFDA, continued in the north of the country. 
                In Maslakh camp in Herat, food aid distribution switched from 
                wheat bags to daily rations, as returns accelerated. International 
                agencies have assisted in the return of more than 90,000 internally 
                displaced person (IDPs) since January, with 51,000 of these returns 
                made to nine northern provinces. The polio immunization campaign 
                last week exceeded the initial targeted number of vaccinations, 
                due to a larger than expected returnee population. </p>
              <p>Political/Military. The first phase of the Loya Jirga process 
                continued this week, as 11 more assemblies (shuras) convened to 
                select district representives in the provinces of Badakshan, Balkh, 
                Kunduz, Bamiyan and Kapisa. These representatives will in turn 
                meet at the end of May to select their district's delegation to 
                the Loya Jirga, to be held June 10-16 in Kabul. Over the coming 
                weeks, each of the county's 381 districts will hold shuras. Eventually, 
                1,051 Afghans will be chosen to attend the Loya Jirga, with an 
                additional 450 seats reserved for various Afghan institutions 
                and groups. Members of the Special Independent Commission for 
                the Convening of the Emergency Loya Jirga traveled to Pakistan 
                and Iran this week to organize the selection process for 100 seats 
                that are reserved for Afghan refugees. The first woman district 
                representative was selected this week in Balkh Province.</p>
              <p>Security. According to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees 
                (UNHCR), the AIA mission dispatched by Chairman Hamid Karzai to 
                investigate persecution of minority Pashtuns in northern Afghanistan 
                reported that the situation had improved. UNHCR is dispatching 
                its own staff to monitor the situation in Badghis, Faryab, Balkh, 
                Jawzjan, Samangan, Baghlan, Kunduz, and Takhar provinces. Authorities 
                in Herat Province reportedly changed guards at Maslakh camp in 
                response to allegations of harassment of Pashtun IDPs.</p>
              <p>Outbursts of factional fighting were reported in several areas 
                of the country. On April 24, fighting broke out in Khost city 
                between rival provincial police officials, killing three and injuring 
                several others. On April 23, the United Nations Assistance Mission 
                in Afghanistan (UNAMA) reported that UNHCR was forced to delay 
                return plans for IDPs to Laghman Province, due to armed clashes 
                that killed two people in the provincial capital Mehtar Lam. On 
                April 21, UNAMA reported ongoing factional fighting in Daikundi, 
                Uruzgan Province causing disruption to the polio vacccination 
                campaign. According to UNHCR, factional tension in Nimruz Province 
                continues to delay the opening of the Milak-Zaranj border crossing 
                with Iran. The U.N. World Food Program (WFP) reported that threats 
                targeted at U.N. staff reduced WFP movements to a minimum in the 
                eastern provinces.<br>
                <br>
                On April 22, three mortar rounds exploded near U.S. troops stationed 
                in Gardez, Paktia Province, according to a U.S. military spokesman. 
                No injuries were reported. On April 20, British military officials 
                reported a suspected assassination plot against Zahir Shah, the 
                recently returned former king, in which the potential killers 
                planned to pose as journalists. On April 19, a French soldier 
                was wounded during a gun battle between the International Security 
                Assistance Force (ISAF) and four unidentified men who had been 
                engaged in suspicious activity near the Kabul airport control 
                tower, officials from ISAF reported. </p>
              <p>Mercy Corps recently notified UNHCR that it will stop its distribution 
                of UNHCR-supplied non-food items to camps in the Chaman border 
                area at the end of April due to a generally poor security situation, 
                a lack of UNHCR protection officers in the area, and a concern 
                about the overall UNHCR strategy for dealing with the crisis. 
                Mercy Corps provides assistance to 75,000 of the 85,000 camp residents 
                in the area. According to UNHCR, there are 40,000 Afghans in no 
                man's land waiting to enter Pakistan at the Chaman border crossing 
                outside the Killi Faizo transit camp. Other NGOs have similarly 
                announced plans to withdraw from the Chaman area because of insecurity.</p>
              <p>On April 19, a spokesman for the U.S. military announced that 
                its personnel in Afghanistan will modify their clothing when conducting 
                relief work to include identifiable articles, patches, or pins 
                distinguishing them from NGO humanitarian workers. The new policy 
                follows a request to the U.S. by humanitarian organizations expressing 
                concern that humanitarian workers could be targeted if mistaken 
                for soldiers.</p>
              <p>Flood. According to UNAMA, on April 23 the heaviest rains in 
                five years in Badghis Province caused flooding in Qala-i-Naw and 
                Ab Kamari districts, killing two, leaving five missing, and resulting 
                in the destruction of 500 homes and shops. In Qala-i-Naw and eight 
                surrounding villages, the flooding affected some 1,200 people, 
                with another 3,000 Afghan IDP and refugee returnees temporarily 
                stranded at the Qala-i-Naw reintegration center on their journey 
                home. The road between Herat and Qala-i-Naw, a major supply route 
                to Badghis Province, was initially cut off by flooding, but is 
                now passable, though heavily damaged. Several lesser roads to 
                surrounding villages have been destroyed. Non-governmental Organizations 
                (NGOs), such as the International Rescue Committee (IRC) and World 
                Vision, have responded to the flooding by providing 800 tents, 
                4,000 blankets, 2,000 family packs, 2,000 pieces of clothing, 
                4,000 sleeping bags, 300 soap bars, and 30 metric tons (MTs) of 
                food. The U.N. World Health Organization (WHO) and Medecins Sans 
                Frontieres (MSF) have provided emergency medical supplies. A WFP 
                assessment of flood-affected areas found 80 percent of irrigated 
                land submerged by floodwaters, jeopardizing the upcoming harvest. 
                UNAMA reported that humanitarian assistance in the region is sufficient 
                to meet the relief needs of victims of the flood. </p>
              <p>Locusts. UNAMA reports that locusts have been hatching in Baghlan, 
                Samangan, and Kunduz provinces, traditional locust areas in what 
                is the most severe case of infestation in 30 years. In Faryab, 
                Takhar, and Badakshan provinces, eggs have not yet begun to hatch 
                due to the higher altitude, and in Jowzjan Province, egg beds 
                were destroyed this year by sandstorms. The U.N. Food and Agriculture 
                Organization (FAO), with USAID/OFDA support and in cooperation 
                with the AIA, local authorities, and international organizations, 
                is coordinating a program of manual and chemical eradication to 
                minimize damage to crops. Manual eradication involves digging 
                trenches around the infested areas, herding the locusts in, and 
                burying them. Up to 20,000 Afghan volunteers are active in the 
                effort. The manual operation will be followed up by chemical spraying, 
                especially in rocky or inaccessible areas.</p>
              <p>Food Aid and Logistics. Since October 2001, WFP, with support 
                from USAID, has delivered 430,586 MT of food into Afghanistan, 
                of which 342,651 MT has been distributed throughout the country, 
                assisting some 6.6 million food-insecure Afghans.</p>
              <p>WFP has conducted more than 60 rapid assessment missions in Afghanistan 
                over the past few weeks. The findings indicate an increased need 
                for food aid in the pre-harvest hunger period of April, May and 
                June. WFP reported that malnutrition persists, the sale of household 
                assets continues, and more children are being pushed into the 
                labor market to support their families. WFP's target is to provide 
                280,000 MT of food assistance to an estimated nine million people 
                until the harvest in July. </p>
              <p>According to WFP, the final distribution of bags of wheat at 
                Maslakh Camp near Herat took place last week. In the future, IDPs 
                remaining in the camp will receive daily bread supplied by WFP 
                bakeries inside the camp, as well as oil and pulses, and porridge 
                for the children. IDPs choosing to return to their homes from 
                the camp will receive a reintegration package including 100 kgs 
                of wheat, 50 kgs of seeds, 40 kgs of fertiliser, and 30 high-energy 
                biscuits.</p>
              <p>More than 100,000 of the most vulnerable people in central Nuristan 
                Province in the east will receive a distribution of three months' 
                food aid, following the completion of a WFP survey in the area. 
                The survey revealed that over 90 percent of the total population 
                possess less than one jerib of land and have lost roughly half 
                its livestock. Cereal production this year failed in this area. 
                Some 40,000 people are scheduled to receive food aid next week 
                through food-for-work projects.</p>
              <p>IDPs and Refugees. UNHCR, the AIA, and the NGO community are 
                preparing for the anticipated return this summer of up to 1.2 
                million Afghan refugees and IDPs (approximately 400,000 refugees 
                from Pakistan, 400,000 refugees from Iran, and 400,000 IDPs in 
                Afghanistan). According to UNHCR, more than 353,000 Afghans have 
                been assisted in returning home in the eight weeks since UNHCR 
                and the AIA began their voluntary repatriation program in coordination 
                with neighboring governments.</p>
              <p>UNHCR reports that more than 327,000 Afghans have returned from 
                Pakistan since its program began March 1. Ninety percent of the 
                returnees pass through the Takhtabaig voluntary repatriation center 
                near Peshawar, Pakistan. An estimated 40 percent are destined 
                for urban centers in Afghanistan. There are three official border 
                crossing points, at Nawa Pass and Torkham in the north and Spin 
                Boldak in the south. UNHCR reported that 39.0 percent of the returnees 
                from northern Pakistan are going back to Nangarhar Province in 
                eastern Afghanistan, 38.7 percent to Kabul Province, 5.7 percent 
                to Parwan Province in central Afghanistan, 3.5 percent to Jowzjan 
                Province in the north, 2.9 percent to Laghman Province in the 
                east, and 9.2 percent to other provinces. This week a record number 
                of Afghans were processed through the Puli-Charki returnee distribution 
                center outside Kabul. Some 21 percent of the Afghan refugees from 
                southern Pakistan are returning to Kunduz Province in the north, 
                20 percent to Kabul, and 16 percent to Kandahar Province in the 
                south. The NGO Mercy Corps reports that up to 90 percent of the 
                returnees arriving in Kandahar Province are only transitting the 
                area, while the remaining few are settling in Kandahar city. The 
                rural areas in the south are not reporting large numbers of returns.</p>
              <p>According to UNHCR, more than 17,000 Afghans have returned from 
                Iran through the northern Islam Qala crossing point at Dogharun 
                since its program began on April 9. Each day at the Soleimankhani 
                center in Tehran, more than 1,000 Afghans refugees are registering 
                to leave Iran and return home. UNHCR is working to identify a 
                second registration site in Tehran. Other centers in Iran are 
                located in Mashad, Zahedan, Qom, Esfahan, Kerman, Shiraz, Yazd 
                and Arak. An estimated half of the returnees are traveling to 
                Herat Province, around 20 percent to Kabul, and the remainder 
                to Ghazni, Kunduz, Loghar and Wardak provinces. The Milak-Zaranj 
                border crossing in the south remained closed due factional unrest 
                in Nimruz Province, although UNHCR reported this week that the 
                crossing may open shortly.</p>
              <p>Afghan refugees in Turkmenistan, estimated to number 6,000, are 
                also being assisted in returning home. UNHCR reported that 18 
                refugees returned home from Turkmenistan this week, ahead of the 
                anticipated rate of 50 per month.</p>
              <p>The International Organization for Migration (IOM), through its 
                completed program of voluntary return from the islands of the 
                Pyandj River along the Tajik-Afghan border, assisted 8,918 Afghans 
                to make the short journey by barge back to Kunduz Province.</p>
              <p>IOM and UNHCR have assisted the return home of more than 90,000 
                IDPs since January, with 51,000 of these returns being made to 
                nine northern provinces. IOM this week completed the return of 
                14,625 IDPs from the old Soviet compound in Kabul to the Shomali 
                Plain. Since April 1, IOM in Mazar-e-Sharif has assisted 11,958 
                persons to return to their homes in northern Afghanistan, bringing 
                the total number of IDPs returned from camps in and around Mazar-e-Sharif 
                to 29,306.</p>
              <p>In Herat, IOM has assisted 34,525 IDPs from Maslakh, Shaidayee 
                and Rawzabagh IDP camps and from the former Central Policlinic 
                in the centre of Herat to return to their homes in Herat and Badghis 
                provinces. An additional 20,000 IDPs living in Maslakh Camp have 
                registered with IOM to return home.</p>
              <p>From the central Bamiyan Province, more than 2,000 mostly ethnic 
                Hazara Afghans have returned to 13 villages in the Shaighan Valley, 
                Baghlan Province since April 22, following a campaign to clear 
                area villages of land mines and unexploded ordnance. Over the 
                coming days, UNHCR and its partners expect to return 7,500 persons 
                from Bamiyan during the first phase of a three phase operation.</p>
              <p>This week, the first group of 2,000 IDPs began moving out of 
                their tents at Hesar Shahi camp near Jalalabad, home to nearly 
                24,000 Afghans who fled war and drought. Some 13,000 camp residents 
                have expressed a desire to return home immediately, some 3,600 
                said they would like to return at a later date, while 7,300 said 
                they did not want to leave. The IDPs are returning to their villages 
                in Kabul, Nangarhar, and Kunar Province. Returns to Laghman Province 
                had to be put on hold due to security concerns in the region.</p>
              <p>On April 18, some 585 IDPs left the southeastern border town 
                of Spin Boldak for Ghazni and Paktika provinces, despite continuing 
                reports of instability <br>
                in parts of these provinces. IDP camps in Spin Boldak currently 
                shelter 40,000 Afghans.</p>
              <p>Health. With USAID/OFDA support, the United Nations Children's 
                Fund (UNICEF) oversaw a three-day nationwide polio vaccination 
                campaign April 16-18 targeting 5.8 million children younger than 
                five years old, with the aim of eradicating the disease in Afghanistan 
                by the end of 2002. Some 40,000 medics and volunteers trained 
                by the AIA Ministry of Health and WHO went door-to-door seeking 
                out children, with teams also operating at refugee and IDP camps, 
                border crossings, and airports. Initial data from days one and 
                two in major cities, such as Kabul and Mazar-e-Sharif, indicate 
                that the number of vaccinations administered exceeded the target 
                goal, due to a larger than expected returnee population. All districts 
                around Gardez and Khost cities were covered, despite military 
                action in that area. In Daikundi, Uruzgan province the immunization 
                effort was hampered by factional fighting. The next national immunization 
                campaign is scheduled to take place on May 26-28. </p>
              <p><b>USG HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE</b></p>
              <p>Background. On October 4, 2001, Assistant Secretary of State 
                for South Asian Affairs Christina B. Rocca redeclared a complex 
                humanitarian disaster in Afghanistan for FY 2002. To date, FY 
                2001 and FY 2002 USG humanitarian assistance for Afghans is provided 
                by USAID/OFDA, Food for Peace (USAID/FFP), Democracy &amp; Governance 
                (USAID/DG), Office of Transition Initiatives (USAID/OTI), United 
                States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Department of State's

                in neighboring countries.</p>
              <p>On March 26, 2002, U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan Robert P. Finn 
                issued a disaster declaration due to the earthquake in Baghlan 
                Province. USAID/OFDA responded by providing an additional $25,000 
                in Disaster Assistance Authority to ACTED, one of many USAID-funded 
                grantees who are providing humanitarian assistance to the affected 
                population.</p>
              <p>In Tajikistan, on October 10, 2001, U.S. Charg&eacute; d'Affaires 
                James A. Boughner declared a disaster due to drought, and requested 
                funds for a seed and fertilizer distribution program. USAID/OFDA 
                responded by providing $998,180 through the U.S. Embassy to Cooperative 
                for American Relief Everywhere (CARE) for the purchase and distribution 
                of winter wheat seeds and fertilizer.</p>
