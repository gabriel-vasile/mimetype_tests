The average pressure for the month was ve hi her than usual at land stations in the Britis Isles, w h e on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States, as well as in the West Indies, the Bermudas, and Azores, it was not far from the normal. The number of days on which fo was observed was
land and above in the waters adjacent to the west coast of Ireland, while it was comparatively rare over the middle section of the steamer lanes. June is ordinarily characterized by uiet weather, and,
was no exception to the general rule, although in the t.wo 5-depee squares between latitudes 40" and 45" sild
lonptudes 40" to 50" gales were reported on three days, whwh is considerably above the normal for that region. They were also observed on two days in the northwestern section of the Gulf of Mexico, due to the tropical disturb- ance that occurred in the last decade of the inon th, which will be referred to later. From the 1st to the 5th moderate weather was the rule over practically the entire ocean, with fog over the Grand Banks on the 1st and 2d and in the vicinity of the British Isles on the 3d and 4th. The observer of the British S. S. War Mehtur stated that on the Ist, while oil the southeast coast of Florida, escevsive refraction was observed in the strongest part of the Gulf Stream, tem- perature of the air SO F., water 79" F. On the 6th there was a well-developed LOW of liniit,ed extent, central near latitude 39" N., longitude iiSo W. It moved slowly eastward during the nest 24 hours,

On the 14th a few vessels in the western section of the ocean recorded gales, although moderate weather pre- vailed for the most part. On the 17th two vessels about 200 miles west of Swan Island re orted easterly gales, although no storm logs
The daily weather map for the 17th shows a slight depression in the southern part of the Gulf of Mexico, that afterwards develo ed into a severe tropical dis- turbance, as shown on d a r t s IX, X and XI for June 20, 21, and 22 respectively. According to ress reports this storm caused a great

The violence of the weather increased, and E y 4 a. m. on the 22d it was raining so hard that it was impossible to see niore than a ship's length, the force of the wind being 10.

Suddenly, at about 10 a. m., the wind decreased in force, showing that the center of the hurri- cane was near, the barometer reading 28.93 inches.

The calm lasted only a short time, as by 10:20 the wind began to blow from the west, steadily increasing until it reached a

At Dutch Harbor pressure was below normal by some 0.30 inch during the h t decade, above normal b about
0.12 inch during the second decade, and below <y 0.36

inch during the last decade. At Honolulu it was below normal by 0.04 inch duri the first and second d e d e ' and approximately normfin the last. At Midway b land it was below normal for the periods 1-5 end 18.17
by about 0.08 inch in each instance, and above nond on other days, the average plus departure being 'some
0.06 inch. As will be seen these pressure1departures)indicate al-
most a normal degree of atmospheric fluctuation for June and offer ver little in the way of explanation for the
toward the end of the month. So far as known no typhoons occurred during the month, although it is possible that the one which struck
Manila on July 5 may have been in existence at the end of June. At the beginnin of the month a moderate depreseion was central neq t E e Bonin Islands. During the 2d and 3d it moved slowly north-northeastward and developed somewhat, causin northerly to easterly gales to the east
of Bering Sea on the 5th. The American four-masted bark, Moshulu, Capt. F. 0. Parker, Manila for San Francisco, encountered this gale
on the 3d in latitude 39' 04' N., longitude 155' 25 E. The wind set in from ESE. and backed to NE.; highemt force 10; barometer at noon of 3d, 29.37 inches. The Nosh& lost her fore lower topsail, mizzen upper topeail, and jib in this gale.' This depression was followed by another of moderate character which caused a fresh easterly gale in the Yellow Sea on the 4th. The latter depression does not appear to have develo ed.
On the 5th &ere were evidences of a large but rather shallow depression between Dutch Harbor and Midway Island. By the following day it had developed same-
low as 29.16 inches in the southern part of the %z
what to the northeastward with barometer re
Alaska accompanied by a fresh SE. gale. This deprea- sion moved ve slowly and still covered the same watere
the British Columbian coast, in advance of the rising
pressure in the re 'on of the Aleutians. The Japanese 8 S. Sum Mum, Capt. M. Machida, Yokohama (May 28) for Seattle, had this gale from the 6th to 8th. Second Officer and Observer, S. Mitomi, fur- nishes the following report:
Gale began on the 6th, wind SW.; lowest barometer, 29.16 inchm at 0 a. m., same date, in latitude 51' 55/ N., longitude 145' 30' w.; end of gale on the Sth, wind SE.; high& force, 9, SE.
Prior to the passing of this depreasion the North Pacilia anticyclone had not attained the normal development for June. Its crest during this month is located in about latitude 37' N., longitude 147' W., with a mntral isobar of 30.25 inches. Up to the 13th, there was only a weak anticyclone between the Hawaiian Islands and the Lower California Peninsula. With the passing of the depression 'ust referred to, however, this area was rein- forced by the rising pressure over the Aleutians, thereby causing the center to shift to the northwestward to about the U E U ~ position, where it remained to the end of the
month. During the last half of the month two moderate deprea- sions moved slowly across the northern art of the oman.
