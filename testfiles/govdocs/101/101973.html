<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>BEFORE THE SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE</STRONG></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>ON COLLECTION ABUSES OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE</STRONG></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>APRIL 28, 1998</STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Mr. Chairman, my name is Earl Epstein.  I am a practicing lawyer and a member of
a small law firm in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  I appreciate the invitation to testify before
this Committee.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	For the past 35 years I have been engaged in the private practice of tax law and
during that period of time have represented numerous taxpayers before the Internal Revenue
Service.  Of particular importance today is my experience in representing taxpayers who
have been subject to collection proceedings by the Collection Division of the Internal
Revenue Service.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	As I am sure you are aware, the stated "Mission" of the Internal Revenue Service is
"…to collect the proper amount of tax revenue at the least cost; serve the public by
continually improving the quality of our products and services; and perform in a manner
warranting the highest degree of public confidence in our integrity, efficiency, and fairness."
The Services' "Statement of Principles" goes on to say that administration should be
conducted " with great courtesy and considerateness…should never try to overreach, and
should be reasonable within the bounds of law and sound administration."  These statements
of principle are well publicized and can be found posted in Internal Revenue Service waiting
rooms around the country.  Unfortunately, taxpayers and their advocates have not always
found these principles to be followed with any degree of consistency by the Collection
Division.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	By these remarks I do not mean to suggest that all Internal Revenue Service Agents
harass taxpayers, nor do I mean to suggest that all lie or overreach.  Indeed, most IRS
personnel that I have dealt with over the years are hardworking, honest people who give
their best efforts to administer a confusing and difficult system in a fair and honorable
manner.  However, it is also clear to me that harassment and overreaching by the Collection
Division of the Internal Revenue Service is far from isolated and that, indeed, it could not
continue at the rate that I have seen over the years without institutional approval of these
practices, whether that be an active approach or by passive approval. </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Following your hearings on abuses of the Internal Revenue Service last year I was
somewhat chagrined at the contention of the Service that reports of their misbehavior were
"exaggerated examples of rare instances of inappropriate actions."  This has not been my
experience with the Collection Division.  In that context I would like to relate to you just a
few examples of the kind of unfortunate experiences which I have faced in my years of
practice before the Collection Division of the Internal Revenue Service:</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT FACE="Symbol"></FONT><FONT FACE="Symbol">·	</FONT><FONT FACE="Symbol"></FONT>Just a few months ago the Internal Revenue Service filed a lien against a joint
bank account held by a husband and wife as tenants by the entireties.  The debt
for taxes, however, was only that of the husband.  Under Tennessee state law,
which applies in this instance, the lien is improper and may only be filed against
the survivorship interest of the husband, not the present interest of the wife in the
joint account.  The controlling case issued by the Tennessee Supreme Court was
cited to the Collection Division in Memphis.  Nevertheless they refused to
release the lien, thereby placing a hold on the funds of the wife, my client, which
she sorely needed to feed her children.  Short of litigation, which was not
economically feasible in this instance, nothing could be done to persuade the
collection people in Memphis to release the lien. </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Symbol">	</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Symbol"></FONT><FONT FACE="Symbol">·	</FONT><FONT FACE="Symbol"></FONT>About two years ago a Collection Agent, attempting to collect unpaid withholding
tax, told my client that he could pay the tax by a check from the attorney
representing him at that time and that, if he would do so, he would receive credit
against his personal withholding tax liability.  After the payment was made as
directed, the Collection Agent instead credited the payment to the corporate debt,
rather than the personal liability of the taxpayer.  When I later brought this
matter to the attention of the agent, he denied his promise to credit the personal
liability and then, when I confronted him with his oral agreement, he laughed
and told me that "it wasn't in writing." This forced my client to pay an additional
$30,000 in tax with no recourse under the law.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Symbol">	</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Symbol"></FONT><FONT FACE="Symbol">·	</FONT><FONT FACE="Symbol"></FONT>A few years ago a Collection Agent appeared in my office and told my secretary
that he wanted to consult with me on a personal matter.  When I  invited him into
my office he proceeded to identify himself as an agent of the Collection Division
of the Internal Revenue Service and demanded access to my files on one of my
clients, a clear violation of the attorney client privilege and clearly not a
consultation on a "personal matter." When I asked him why he had lied to my
secretary he merely laughed and told me that "sometimes we have to do that." Of
course, I threw him out of my office and wrote to the Commissioner of Internal
Revenue to report his action.  I was later advised by the office of the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue that the Agent received an unspecified
disciplinary action.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Symbol">	</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Symbol"></FONT><FONT FACE="Symbol">·	</FONT><FONT FACE="Symbol"></FONT>Some years ago I represented a woman who owned and operated a small beauty
shop.  The Collection Division had placed a lien on her shop for unpaid taxes of
approximately $175 and proceeded to sell her shop equipment at auction, thereby
putting her out of business and embarrassing her in front of her customers and
friends.  At the auction she had displayed to the Collection Agent her canceled
check with which she had paid the claimed tax.  The agent refused to listen to her
and proceeded with the sale.  Subsequently I was retained as her counsel.  I
obtained copies of the computer records of her account from the Internal
Revenue Service and was able to show how they had made an erroneous double
entry of the tax due on their computer system, thereby making it seem that the
taxpayer owed tax when, in fact, this was not the case.  Although the Service
acknowledged the error to me, they refused to make any effort to make my client
whole, even refusing to repay the excess tax which they had collected by the sale
of her property on the grounds that the Statute of Limitations had expired on the
refund.  Since the amount did not justify the expense of a refund action in the
United States District Court, and since the law at that time did not permit an
award of damages, there was little I could do for her other than to write to her
Congressman to describe to him what had occurred.  As a result of that letter a
private bill was  introduced in the House of Representatives which would have
permitted her to bring an action against the United States for damages in order
to compensate her for her loss.  Unfortunately, the bill died in committee.  She
was never compensated and never received an apology. Her only solace was her
ability to display the draft of House Bill to her friends.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Symbol">	</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Symbol"></FONT><FONT FACE="Symbol">·	</FONT><FONT FACE="Symbol"></FONT>For years a particular Collection Agent in Philadelphia lied to me repeatedly on
a number of cases.  In order to protect the guilty I will refer to him as Agent
"M".  I reported his actions to his supervisor on each occasion.  On at least one
case he was thereafter removed from the case and another agent assigned. 
Nevertheless Agent "M" appeared again and again on cases I was handling and
was obviously never sufficiently reprimanded or dismissed for his conduct.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Symbol">	</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Symbol"></FONT><FONT FACE="Symbol">·	</FONT><FONT FACE="Symbol"></FONT>Some years ago I represented a taxpayer who had been severely harassed by the
Government over a period of some ten years, first by bringing two criminal
actions against him, both of which were dismissed by the Court, and then
bringing a civil action against him alleging income tax fraud, to collect tax on the
very allegations which were the subject of the dismissed criminal suits.  The
matter was brought to the United States Tax Court.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Symbol">	</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Symbol">	</FONT>In an effort to settle the Tax Court case we submitted an Offer in<STRONG> </STRONG>Compromise 
along with the required statement of assets and liabilities, executed under
penalties of perjury.  Our friend, Agent "M" then instituted a criminal
investigation against my client but refused to tell me why he had done so, or on
what grounds he felt a crime had been committed. In a hearing to quash a
subpoena issued against my client a Judge of the United States District Court in
Philadelphia forced Agent "M" to disclose the grounds of the criminal
investigation. It turned out that Agent "M" had decided on his own that my client
had failed to list a number of stocks on the Offer in Compromise submission and
therefore proceeded to push the criminal investigation for lying under oath on the
Offer form.  When informed of the grounds of his investigation I was able to
easily produce the stock certificates in the name of my client as custodian for his
children under the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act, thereby showing that my client
had no legal right to the stocks and did not own them.  As a result, my client had
not lied under oath on the Offer in Compromise submission.  Agent "M" had no
compunction about harassing my client on false grounds which could have been
easily explained had he been forthright and open in his dealings with me.  My
client, of course, had to bear the cost of these proceedings.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Symbol">	</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Symbol">	</FONT>During the course of the previously described hearing in the District Court,
Judge Norma Shapiro Court ordered Agent "M" to cease all efforts at collection
and investigation and specifically forbade the agent from any contact with the
taxpayer or his family pending a ruling by the Court on the validity of the claim
which, of course, she later determined to be invalid.  Blatantly ignoring the order
of the Court, Agent "M" visited the home of the taxpayer's 80 year old mother
at five AM the next morning, threatened her, and demanded entrance to search
her garage.  When the Court was advised of his actions Judge Shapiro severely
reprimanded Agent "M" in open court.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Symbol">	</FONT></P>

<P>When the civil fraud case was eventually tried in the United States Tax Court,
the Court found for the taxpayer and criticized the Internal Revenue Service,
stating that the actions of the Government could well have been viewed as a
personal vendetta against him.  But, of course, that criticism, although welcomed
by the taxpayer, did nothing to repair the damage that years of harassment caused
him, nor did it compensate him for the cost of two criminal trials, one
suppression hearing, and a Tax Court trial. <SUP></SUP><A HREF="#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A> </FONT></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT SIZE="-1">		In 1977 the Congress amended the Consumer Credit Protection Act to include
a new section known as the "Fair Debt Collection Practices Act." <SUP></SUP><A HREF="#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A>  That Act provides for a
standard of conduct for debt collectors of "consumer debt", is designed to prevent "abusive,
deceptive, and unfair debt collection practices…" <SUP></SUP><A HREF="#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A>  and provides for civil penalties and
damages for violation of the Act. <SUP></SUP><A HREF="#N_4_"><SUP>(4)</SUP></A>  Among other things it regulates the kind and place of
communications with the debtor <SUP></SUP><A HREF="#N_5_"><SUP>(5)</SUP></A>, defines and prohibits false or misleading representations
<SUP></SUP><A HREF="#N_6_"><SUP>(6)</SUP></A>, and defines and prohibits unfair practices <SUP></SUP><A HREF="#N_7_"><SUP>(7)</SUP></A>. Unfortunately, the Act does not cover actions
by an officer or employee of the United States to the extent that collecting any debt is in the
performance of his official duties. <SUP></SUP><A HREF="#N_8_"><SUP>(8)</SUP></A>  This exclusion is unfortunate in that, by implication, it
permits an employee of the Internal Revenue Service to engage in "abusive, deceptive and
unfair debt collection practices" that is prohibited in the private sector.  </FONT></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT SIZE="-1">	I would urge this Committee to give careful consideration to legislation making
the Internal Revenue Service subject to the same rules of conduct which the Congress has
imposed on the private sector, an interesting sidelight of which is a requirement of annual
reports to the Congress assessing the extent to which compliance is being achieved. <SUP></SUP><A HREF="#N_9_"><SUP>(9)</SUP></A> </FONT></P>
