<h4 align="center">STATEMENTS FROM THE SUPREME COURT<br>
REGARDING THE DEATH OF CHIEF JUSTICE WILLIAM H. REHNQUIST<br>
September 4, 2005</h4>

<br>
<p>Statement of Justice John Paul Stevens:</p>

<p>William Rehnquist's independent, impartial, and dedicated leadership of the Supreme Court has been an inspiration to those of us privileged to serve with him - and to the entire Nation as well. Charles Evans Hughes, a great Chief Justice whom he particularly admired, would have been proud of the example he set as the leader of the Court. He was truly the first among equals in discharging his judicial duties in a prompt, scholarly and fair manner. He was a good friend, maintaining his sense of humor and proportion throughout the difficult period that marked his most recent service. We shall miss him.</p>

<br>
<p>Statement of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor:</p>

<p>William Rehnquist will go down in history as one of the great Chief Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States. He steered the Court along a path of responsibility and careful analysis throughout his 19 years as Chief Justice. He led the Court with firm principles but with a light touch. He never lost his sense of humor and he was able to secure the cooperation and admiration of all of the Justices for the years in which he served. He will be sorely missed.</p>

<br>
<p>Statement of Justice Antonin Scalia:</p>

<p>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist led a philosophically diverse group of Justices through 19 years in which public attention was focused upon the Supreme Court to an unprecedented degree. His keen intellect and sound judgment commanded the respect of his colleagues, and his personal qualities of considerateness and fairness won their affection. His death is a loss to the Court, to all the federal judiciary that he headed for so long, and to the Nation. It is a double loss for me; he was my friend long before he was my Chief. May he rest in peace.</p>

<br>
<p>Statement of Justice Anthony Kennedy:</p>

<p>William Rehnquist was a warm, compassionate, decent man; a brilliant jurist; and a Chief Justice of superb and historic stature.  In his personal relations he was unpretentious to the point of being casual, almost as if to put friends and colleagues at ease with his vast knowledge of history, remarkable grasp of the law, and a mind so precise he was at once formidable and delightful.  He was a skillful presiding officer of exemplary fairness.  He loved his family.  The American people can be grateful to them for the distinguished public service William Rehnquist gave to the Court and to our Nation.</p>

<br>
<p>Statement of Justice Clarence Thomas:</p>

<p>Virginia and I were deeply saddened to learn of the death of the Chief Justice. We will miss him deeply as a friend and as a colleague. He was a good man who epitomized fairness, dignity, and strength of character. Our thoughts and prayers continue to be with his family.</p>

<br>
<p>Statement of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg:</p>

<p>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist was the fairest, most efficient boss I have ever had.  Speaking of his role in a 2002 address, he said: "[T]he Chief Justice has placed in his hands some of the tools which will enable him to be <I>primus</I> among the <I>pares</I> but his stature will depend on how he uses them." In his leadership of the U.S. Judiciary and his superintendence of the Supreme Court, William H. Rehnquist used to great effect the tools Congress and tradition entrusted to him.  A plain speaker without airs or affectations, the Chief fostered a spirit of collegiality among the nine of us perhaps unparalleled in the Court's history.  He regarded an independent judiciary as our country's hallmark and pride, and in his annual reports, he constantly urged Congress to safeguard that independence.  On the obligation key to judging, he cautioned that a judge steps out of the proper judicial role most conspicuously and dangerously when the judge flinches from a decision that is legally right because the bottom line is not the one "the home crowd wants."  I held him in highest regard and affection, and will miss him greatly.</p>

<br>
<p>Statement of Justice Stephen G. Breyer:</p>

<p>The Chief Justice was a brave, intelligent man deeply committed to maintaining the rule of law and preserving an independent judiciary.</p>

<p>He understood the Court and its history. He administered the Court, as he did the judicial system, effectively and with great fairness. He never allowed disagreements about the law to become personal and the Court followed his example. I much admired his personal and legal strength. I shall greatly miss him.</p>
