<p><strong>Introduction</strong>

<p>Good morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee.  My name is Daniel J. Wiles and I
am the Deputy Associate Chief Counsel (Domestic Field Service), Office of Chief Counsel,
Internal Revenue Service.  In this capacity, I oversee the Service's litigation efforts and practice
in the area of Domestic taxation.  This includes supervisory oversight of the Counsel's appellate
litigation practices and its Action on Decision program.  I appreciate the opportunity to be here
today to discuss H.R. 1544, the Federal Agency Compliance Act.  

<p>This bill would amend the Administrative Procedures Act by (1) requiring an agency to adhere to
the court of appeals' precedent in cases appealable to that circuit and (2) limiting an agency's
discretion to relitigate legal issues in federal courts.  

<p>While H.R. 1544 reflects an approach that is, in large part, consistent with the Internal Revenue
Service's current policy with respect to litigation, we do not think it would be desirable to enact
this bill into law for a number of reasons.  

<p>In brief, we are concerned that the legislation would limit administrative judgment and flexibility
and could create more -- rather than less -- litigation and uncertainty.

<p>I would like first to provide an overview of the role of litigation within the context of tax
administration and how the Office of Chief Counsel approaches that litigation.  I will then
discuss our concerns with H.R. 1544.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>Role of Litigation in Tax Administration</strong>

<p>To understand the role of litigation in tax administration, it is important first to understand the
mission of the Internal Revenue Service.  The mission of the IRS states that:

<p>The purpose of the Internal Revenue Service is to collect the proper amount of tax revenue at the
least cost; serve the public by continually improving the quality of our products and services; and
perform in a manner warranting the highest degree of public confidence in our integrity,
efficiency, and fairness.

<p>This mission is further reflected in our Statement of Principles of Internal Revenue Tax
Administration, which is as follows:

<p>The function of the Internal Revenue Service is to administer the Internal Revenue Code.  Tax
policy for raising revenue is determined by Congress.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>With this in mind, it is the duty of the Service to carry out that policy by correctly applying the
laws enacted by Congress; to determine the reasonable meaning of various Code provisions in
light of the congressional purpose in enacting them; and to perform this work in a fair and
impartial manner, with neither a government nor a taxpayer point of view.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>At the heart of administration is interpretation of the Code.  It is the responsibility of each person
in the Service, charged with the duty of interpreting the law, to try to find the true meaning of the
statutory provision and not to adopt a strained construction in the belief that he or she is
"protecting the revenue." 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The revenue is properly protected only when we ascertain and apply the true meaning of the
statute.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Service also has the responsibility of applying and administering the law in a reasonable,
practical manner.  Issues should only be raised by examining officers when they have merit,
never arbitrarily or for trading purposes.  At the same time, the examining officer should never
hesitate to raise a meritorious issue.  It is also important that care be exercised not to raise an
issue or to ask a court to adopt a position inconsistent with an established Service position.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Administration should be both reasonable and vigorous.  It should be conducted with as little
delay as possible and with great courtesy and considerateness.  It should never try to overreach,
and should be reasonable within the bounds of law and sound administration.  It should,
however, be vigorous in requiring compliance with law and it should be relentless in its attack on
unreal tax devices and fraud.

<p>This philosophy -- of collecting the proper amount of tax revenue by correctly interpreting the
Code -- is as important in litigation as in other tax administration activities.  Over 30 years ago,
the Office of Chief Counsel provided the following guidelines for litigation:

<p>A detailed tax code does not provide all the answers.  Many questions arise for the first time in
litigation.  The position taken must represent the interpretation the Service wants because it is the
best and most reasonable, the interpretation that makes the maximum contribution to a sound,
wise tax system, not only immediately but over the long run.  Our responsibility to adopt the
proper position in litigation cannot be shifted to the courts.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>********

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In addition to insuring that litigation positions conform with ruling policy, it is important that
legal positions urged in litigation reflect the same "largeness of attitude" that the Commissioner
and Chief Counsel have stated should be used in performing the ruling or interpretative function 
. . . . It is natural for the lawyer responsible for litigating a case or  supervising its litigation to
want to urge whatever arguments will support the Government.  However, because a case is in
litigation does not justify taking a position which would not be taken had the question been
presented for a ruling.

<p>Chief Counsel Order 1964-7.  We continue to follow this philosophy today.

<p>It is also important to put into context both the amount of litigation in the system and the way we
handle that litigation.  Litigation is never our first choice in resolving a dispute.  We recognize
that it is an expensive and uncertain process and should be used only when absolutely necessary.  

<p>To put the amount of litigation in perspective, over 200 million tax returns are filed each year.  In
fiscal year 1995, approximately 2.1 million examinations were conducted and all but about
68,000 of these cases were resolved at the examination stage.  The vast majority of these
remaining 68,000 cases were settled without litigation.  On average, only about 29,000 Tax
Courts petitions and about 800 refund suits are filed each year.<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> The Tax Court tries and decides
only about 1,200 to 1,500 cases each year; the district courts and Claims Court write about 160
opinions a year in tax cases.  Even while pending in court, the vast majority of these disputes are
settled.  Taxpayers and the government choose to appeal only about 250-275 Tax Court and 

<p>refund cases each year while the government appeals only about 50 of these cases a year.

<p>Any decision to appeal a case is made only after considerable review.  Within the Office of Chief
Counsel, the recommendation to appeal or not to appeal is made by one of the three Associate
Chief Counsel (the one with subject matter jurisdiction over the issue) in consultation with the
Treasury General Counsel.  This recommendation is initially reviewed by the Assistant Attorney
General for the Tax Division of the Department of Justice who makes an independent
recommendation to the Solicitor General.  The final decision to appeal is made by the Office of
the Solicitor General, after taking into account these recommendations.  This process is designed
to ensure that the decision to appeal is reviewed by senior level officials at the IRS and the
Department of Justice who are not involved in the case at the trial level.  

<p><strong>IRS' Action on Decision Program</strong>

<p>The foregoing statistics, which have remained relatively constant in recent years, show that the
government initiates only a limited number of appeals.  Nevertheless, in some cases where the
decision is made not to pursue further appeals (including appeals to the Supreme Court), the
issue may be significant to tax administration and indirectly affect numerous other taxpayers.  In
these instances, it is important that the Service communicate its planned future actions with
respect to these issues.  The Service may do this by issuing what we call an "Action on Decision"
(AOD).  An AOD lets Internal Revenue Service agents, Chief Counsel lawyers, and taxpayers
know whether the IRS will litigate the issue again in that court or another court.  

<p>The Action on Decision program was created in the 1920's and has been only slightly modified
over the intervening 70 years.  Under our current guidelines (a copy of which has been provided
to the Committee) in significant cases, the Chief Counsel's office issues an Action on Decision
which states whether the IRS position on the court decision is one of acquiescence, acquiescence
in result only, or nonacquiescence.

<p>Acquiescence means that the Service accepts the holding of the court in a case and will follow it
nationwide in disposing of cases with the same controlling facts.  It does not indicate approval or
disapproval of the reasons assigned by the court for its conclusions.  

<p>Acquiescence in result only means that the Service accepts the holding of the court in a case and
that the Service will follow it nationwide in disposing of cases with the same controlling facts. 
However, it indicates disagreement or concern with some or all of the reasons assigned by the
court for its conclusions.  

<p>Nonacquiescence signifies that, although the decision was not appealed or was not reviewed by
the Supreme Court, the Service does not agree with the holding of the court and will not follow it
nationwide in disposing of other taxpayers' cases.  If a nonacquiescence AOD is issued with
respect to an opinion of a circuit court, the AOD will state whether or not the Service will follow
the holding of the court on that issue in cases that are appealable to the court that issued the
adverse decision.   

<p>The decision whether to issue an AOD is made at the same senior IRS level as the decision to
recommend appeal; that is, by the Associate Chief Counsel with jurisdiction over the subject
matter.  While considering the issuance of an AOD, the Associate Chief Counsel must also
consider whether changes are needed in IRS rulings and regulations because of the court decision
or whether the issue may be resolved by administrative changes rather than further litigation.  A
decision to issue an AOD is frequently made only after coordination with the Treasury
Department, Office of Tax Policy and the Department of Justice.      

<p><strong>Intracircuit Relitigation</strong>

<p>It is the longstanding general policy of the Office of Chief Counsel to follow the decisions of the
courts of appeals.  Even where it is determined that an opinion of a court of appeals will not be
followed nationwide, the stated nonacquiescence policy of the Office of Chief Counsel is that "as
a general rule, with respect to opinions of an appellate court, the Service will follow the holding
of the circuit court in case[s] appealable to that circuit due to the binding nature of that opinion in
lower courts."  Chief Counsel Directives Manual (35)(12)11.(4). 

<p>In the time available to prepare this testimony, I asked my staff to quickly survey the AODs
issued in the last 10 years.  A preliminary count indicated that the Service issued a total of 200
AODs covering 247 issues during this period.  In the majority of these AODs, the Service
accepted the decision of the court and indicated that it would follow that decision in disposing of
other cases nationwide.  Even where we did not do that, we generally decided to follow that
opinion in that circuit. 

<p>One example of this policy is the AOD the Service issued with respect to <u>Security Bank of
Minnesota v. Commissioner</u>, 994 F.2d 432 (8th Cir. 1993), AOD 

<p>1995-14.  In this AOD, the Service disagreed with the opinion of the court and announced that it
would litigate the issue presented by the case again, but only in circuits <u>other</u> than the Eighth
Circuit.  A number of banks which could appeal cases to the Eighth Circuit wished to follow the
decision in <u>Security Bank</u> and change their methods of accounting.  To allow taxpayers in the
Eighth Circuit to avail themselves of the method of accounting permitted by <u>Security Bank</u>, the
Service issued Notice 95-57, 1995-2 C.B. 337, which allowed the taxpayers to automatically
change their methods of accounting to that desired. 

<p>In limited situations however, the Service will issue an AOD indicating that it will relitigate an
issue in the same circuit which had issued the adverse opinion.  Over the last 10 years, our quick
survey found only six cases<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a> in which this exception to our general practice was implicated.

<p>      In three of the six cases, the Service believed that litigation could proceed even in the
deciding circuit because the precedent could be distinguished on, or limited to, its facts.<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a>  

<p> In two of the six cases, the procedures required by  these decisions would have been
administratively difficult and burdensome.<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a> Moreover, if the Service's position was ultimately
upheld, any contrary treatment for taxpayers in those circuits would have resulted in dramatically
inconsistent treatment of similarly-situated taxpayers in different areas of the country.<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a>  We
were convinced that other courts would not agree with those initial decisions, and the Service
position was ultimately upheld by the Supreme Court.  <u>Bufferd v. Commissioner</u>, 113 S. Ct. 927
(1993). 

<p> The remaining case also involves an issue in which we anticipate review by the Supreme
Court, but such review has not yet occurred.<a href="#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>We believe that the decisions to continue litigation in these exceptional instances were
appropriate to promote sound tax administration.<strong></strong>

<p><strong>Intercircuit Relitigation</strong> 

<p>The IRS carefully reviews all court of appeals opinions adverse to the government and considers
whether the opinion reflects a persuasive view of the law that should be adopted as the Service
position.  If we believe that the opinion is not correct, we may determine to litigate the issue in
other circuits. As explained above, although Service nonacquiescence is generally not intended to
direct relitigation in the same court of appeals, it is intended to direct relitigation in other circuits. 
 

<p>Given the decision of Congress to have 13 separate courts of appeals, intercircuit conflict is
probably inevitable and, in some ways, beneficial.  Relitigation in other courts may present a
fresh, independent look at the issue which may result in an opinion more consistent with the
correct interpretation of the statute.  The Internal Revenue Service is charged with administering
the tax laws uniformly for taxpayers across the country.  In those rare situations where the
Service believes that a Supreme Court decision is required to provide final resolution of an issue,
intercircuit relitigation is often necessary to obtain Supreme Court review.  The inherent structure
of the 13 judicial circuits and the IRS's responsibility to ensure federal tax uniformity require IRS
litigation decisions to balance these competing factors.

<p>An alternative to the current judicial structure that might ensure greater tax uniformity with less
relitigation has been proposed on a number of occasions in the past.  This alternative has
focussed upon the possibility of having a single national court of appeals for tax cases.  However,
while this proposal has often been discussed, it has never obtained significant support and has
never been enacted.  The consensus has been that there are significant advantages to multi-circuit
litigation of tax cases.  Commenting on this proposal and summarizing a number of independent
analyses of multi-circuit litigation, the American Bar Association, Section on Taxation, Report of
the Task Force on the Civil Litigation Process concluded:

<p>Part of the genius of our system of circuit appellate reports is the opportunity for reconsideration
of an issue already decided in one circuit by another appellate court free of the constraints of the
doctrine of <u>stare decisis</u>.  This opportunity for an issue to be ventilated in more than one circuit
may be especially important in tax cases.  The first appellate review of a tax issue may be
shortsighted, distorted by a particular record or omission of an argument, or simply mistaken. . . . 
Only after the initial decision may the importance of the matter become apparent -- along with
different circumstances or other new material indicating that the initial decision did not take into
account all relevant considerations. 

<p>(Nov. 1, 1989, at 18-19).  We agree with this statement.

<p>It has been suggested by some that there is a "two circuit rule" or a "three circuit rule" before the
Service will accept or concede a position (<u>i.e.</u>, that the Service will concede a position only after
it loses in two or three circuits).  The Service has no such rule.  We look at each situation
individually and consider the best course of action for each.  On some issues, the Service
concedes after a loss in a single court; on other issues, the Service will concede only after the
Supreme Court has addressed the issue.  <strong>Reasons We Do Not Support H.R. 1544 </strong>

<p>As we noted at the outset, the design and the intent of H.R. 1544 is substantially consistent with
the litigation philosophy of the Office of Chief Counsel and the Internal Revenue Service as
reflected in our published guidelines and longstanding practice.  However, the Service does not
support H.R. 1544 because we believe that in order to further sound tax administration we need
the flexibility to exercise judgment in determining the most appropriate litigation strategy for
each individual case.  This legislation would replace our ability to exercise this judgment with a
set of prescribed rules.  

<p>This bill also does not address taxpayer appeals which are the greatest cause of repetitive
litigation; the proposal would not limit taxpayer appeals regardless of the number of court of
appeals decisions favorable to the government position.  Neither would the proposal ensure the
uniform interpretation of legislation.  For example, it would require government concession of
issues even where three or more circuits supported the government view, if three circuits did not
support that view.  

<p>  Also, a particular statutory provision or complementary provisions may affect parties to the
same transaction in different ways.  This proposal, especially with regard to multi-circuit
relitigation, assumes that a decision of a court is either completely in favor of, or adverse to, the
interests of taxpayers at large.  However, in the Internal Revenue Code there are numerous
reciprocal provisions that affect different taxpayers in opposite ways.  In a given transaction, the
application of the law may be tax-beneficial to one taxpayer (e.g., a deduction) and
correspondingly tax-detrimental to another (e.g., taxable income).  Further, the controlling
circuits for these taxpayers are often different.  Thus, for a given transaction, it is possible for
both taxpayers to prevail at appellate levels notwithstanding the theoretical impossibility that
both opinions could be correct.  The "three circuit rule" of the proposed legislation could mean
that the government would be forced to honor both contrary decisions if each garnered support of
three circuits.  

<p>Another concern with the proposal is that it does not take into account the fact that appeals in tax
cases, unlike appeals in other civil cases, may frequently arise simultaneously in different
circuits.  This may happen, for example, when the Tax Court consolidates cases with a common
issue that are appealable to different circuits.  Other times, new cases enter the appellate stream
before decisions are rendered by appellate courts in earlier appeals.  It is uncertain whether the
"three circuit" rule will be applied based upon the coincidence of which circuits decide their
cases first, and thus, the "three circuit" rule would likely cause confusion and be difficult to
administer. 

<p>More generally, we note also that the bill implicitly allows for judicial review of an agency's
decision to continue intracircuit litigation.  Thus, we believe that this proposal would likely
create more litigation than it prevents as the opposing parties offer differing meanings of the
terms of the bill as well as the scope of the precedent itself.  For example, proposed section
707(b) would allow intracircuit litigation when it is "not certain whether [the matter] will be
subject to review by the court of appeals that established the precedent . . . ."  However, appellate
venue in tax cases is never absolutely determinable until the taxpayer files a petition or complaint
in a particular federal court.<a href="#N_7_"><sup>(7)</sup></a>  Of course, as noted above, venue is possible in the Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit regardless of residence or place of business.  If the bill is enacted,
there will be litigation as to whether the venue was nevertheless "certain" before the filing of the
petition or complaint.

<p>Likewise, the scope of existing precedent is frequently the central argument on the merits of
subsequent cases on similar issues.  The proposed legislation will shift the focus away from the
substantive issues in a particular case and to the issue of whether there is existing precedent in
the circuit that precludes relitigation.  The other exceptions are also likely to increase (rather than
decrease) controversy.  Finally, it is probably not possible to state exceptions in objective terms
that will encompass all the legitimate rationales that exist, or may in the future exist, to justify
intracircuit  litigation or litigation in more than those circuits.  Nor will these objective
exceptions meaningfully substitute for the judgment that is applied by the Office of Chief
Counsel, the Tax Division of the Department of Justice and the Office of the Solicitor General
today in deciding whether individual cases should be appealed.

<p>We believe, there are already adequate managerial controls in place to ensure that the
government's decisions to appeal in tax cases further the goals of sound tax administration.  The
Service's decision to nonacquiesce in a court of appeals decision is made only after extensive
coordination.  Also, the Solicitor General's office must approve all appeals; it is our experience
that recommendations for further appeals after an adverse decision are subject to very careful
scrutiny.  The justification would typically be based on the importance of the legal issue and
chances of success of continued appeals.  The existence of favorable precedents of other courts or
split decisions may also be significant.  These factors, however, are not specifically recognized as
relevant in the proposed legislation.

<p>Finally, the Internal Revenue Code already contains a sanction designed to prevent unjustifiable
litigation on the part of the Internal Revenue Service.  IRC section 7430, Awarding of Costs and
Certain Fees, provides that the prevailing party in an administrative or court proceeding against
the United States may be awarded administrative and litigation costs.  This would apply when
the taxpayer is the prevailing party and the position of the United States was deemed "not
substantially justified."  In initially approving this legislation, Congress noted that it <u>was</u>
generally justifiable to relitigate in order to seek a circuit conflict.  Nevertheless, it would not be
justifiable to continue litigation where it is not justifiable in both fact and law.  Under the
Taxpayer Bill of Rights 2, it is the Service's burden to show that its position is justifiable.  

<p>The specific remedy of IRC section 7430, in combination with the overall structure for review
and control of decisions to appeal, ensures that litigation is pursued only in meritorious cases. 
H.R. 1544 will add little to this process but may well result in additional litigation over
compliance with the bill itself.  This ancillary litigation will do nothing to resolve the merits of
the Service's position or determine whether that position was substantially justified.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>

<p>Before the Service decides to relitigate an adverse decision, it considers the significance of the
decision to taxpayers across the country, its impact on tax administration, the benefits of
uniformity and costs of relitigation, the importance of the issue, and the relative merits of both
sides of the issue.  Thus, the Service's litigation decisions reflect a carefully balanced judgment
taking into account relevant factors and competing interests.  We do not believe H.R. 1544 is an
appropriate substitute for the conscientious exercise of informed judgment based on the
circumstances of each particular situation.

<p>Mr. Chairman, that concludes my remarks.  I would be happy to answer any questions.
