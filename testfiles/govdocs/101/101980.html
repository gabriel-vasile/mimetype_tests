Child care has become the norm for young children in the United States. In

1995, 59 percent of children who were 5 years or younger were in nonparental

care arrangements on a regular basis (Hofferth, Shauman, Henke, and West,

1998). This care typically began at early ages and lasted substantial hours:

with 44 percent of infants under the age of 1 year were in nonparental care

for an average of 31 hours a week. In the late preschool years, 84 percent

of 4- to 5-year-olds were recorded as being in child care for an average

of 28 hours per week. The use of nonparental care in the United States is

expected to grow even further as welfare reform is fully implemented (Vandell,

1998).

<P>

It is within this framework of widespread and early-age use that questions

about child care quality have been raised. Among child care researchers,

the established view is that child care quality contributes to children&#146;s

developmental outcomes, higher quality care being associated with better

developmental outcomes and poorer quality care being associated with poorer

outcomes for children (Clarke-Stewart and Fein, 1983; Phillips, 1987). This

view is reflected in Michael Lamb&#146;s (1998) comprehensive critique of

child care research that was published in the <CITE>Handbook of Child

Psychology</CITE>. Lamb concluded, based on extant research, that:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

  &#147;Quality day care from infancy clearly has positive effects on

  children&#146;s intellectual, verbal, and cognitive development, especially

  when children would otherwise experience impoverished and relatively

  unstimulating home environments. Care of unknown quality may have deleterious

  effects.&#148; (p. 104)

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

A similar conclusion was drawn in a review prepared for the Rockefeller

Foundation (Love, Schochet, and Meckstroth, 1996):

<BLOCKQUOTE>

  &#147;The preponderance of evidence supports the conclusion of a substantial

  positive relationship between child care quality and child well-being. Evidence

  for this relationship encompasses multiple dimensions of quality and diverse

  indicators of children&#146;s well-being.&#148; (p. 3)

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

This view, however, is not uniformly held. Some researchers and policy makers

have begun to question the conventional wisdom regarding child care quality

(Besharov, 2000; Blau, 1999c; Scarr, 1998). Sandra Scarr (1998), for example,

has concluded that:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

  &#147;Widely varying qualities of child care have been shown to have only

  small effects on children&#146;s concurrent development and no demonstrated

  long term impact, except for disadvantaged children.&#148; (p. 95)

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

A major goal of the current report is to evaluate the research evidence from

which these claims and counterclaims are drawn. We then analyze the argument

for public intervention to improve the quality of child care, especially

for children from lower income-families.

<P>

A careful review of the literature indicates that reviewers often draw on

the same research studies, but interpret findings differently. These different

interpretations are based, in part, on where the reviewers have &#147;set

the bar.&#148; Some researchers place more weight on studies that include

observational assessments of child care quality and that measure psychological

processes using multiple strategies (NICHD Early Child Care Research Network,

1994). These same investigators tend to place less emphasis on the necessity

of large, nationally representative samples. Although the investigators believe

that it is important to assess and control for selection biases, they worry

more about overcontrol than undercontrol in their analyses. In contrast,

others (see Besharov, 2000; Blau, 1999c, in press) have emphasized the importance

of large, nationally representative samples and the need to have sufficient

controls in the statistical analyses. These investigators have placed greater

credence on information obtained from nationally representative surveys,

even if studies lacked observational assessments of child care quality or

objective measures of child performance.

<P>

An additional factor contributing to different conclusions about child care

quality is how heavily reviewers weigh the importance of concurrent vs. long-term

findings. As can be seen on Tables <A HREF="table1.htm">1</A>,

<A HREF="table2.htm">2</A>, and <A HREF="table3.htm">3</A>, the research

literature describing concurrent associations between child care quality

and child performance is larger and findings are more consistent than the

research literature that tests for longer-term effects. A number of factors

may contribute to the more mixed picture for long-term effects, including

measurement problems and lack of control for experiences during the intervening

period. A better consensus about realistic and reasonable expectations about

effect sizes also is needed (McCartney &amp; Rosenthal, in press).

<P>

Thus, a variety of factors must be considered if we are to determine whether

associations between child care quality and children&#146;s developmental

outcomes are large enough for parents, researchers, and policy makers to

care about, and whether effects warrant public or private expenditures to

improve quality. In an effort to address these broad issues, we pose five

specific questions:

  <A NAME="measures">HOW IS CHILD CARE QUALITY MEASURED?</A>

</H2>

<P>

A critical issue in evaluating the research evidence is consideration of

how child care quality is measured. Researchers have measured quality in

various ways: by observing process, by recording structural and caregiver

characteristics, by assessing health and safety provisions. Child care processes

refer to actual experiences that occur in child care settings, including

children&#146;s interactions with caregivers and peers and their participation

in different activities. Sometimes process measures are global scores that

combine experiences across several areas that include health and safety

provisions, interactions with caregivers, and age-appropriate materials.

Other process measures target specific activities or experiences, such as

language stimulation by caregivers. Structural and caregiver characteristics

refer to features such as child:adult ratio, group class size, caregiver

formal education, and caregiver specialized training related to children.

Structural and caregiver characteristics are conceptualized as more distal

indicators of child care quality. Health and safety provisions refer to both

health-promoting practices, such as hand-washing, and safety in the classroom

and on playgrounds.

<H3>

  Process Quality

</H3>

<P>

One well-known process measure is the Early Care Environment Rating Scale

(ECERS, Harms and Clifford, 1980). This measure is composed of 37 items that

evaluate seven aspects of center-based care for children ages two and a half

to five years. These areas are personal care routines, furnishings, language

reasoning experiences, motor activities, creative activities, social development,

and staff needs. Detailed descriptors are provided for each item and each

item is rated as inadequate (1), minimal (3), good (5), and excellent (7).

The ratings, according to the scale developers, are based on a minimum of

a two-hour block of observation in the classroom. The Infant/Toddler Environment

Rating Scale (ITERS, Harms, Cryer, and Clifford, 1990) is a related measure

that assesses process quality in centers for children younger than two and

a half years. The 35 items of the ITERS also are organized under seven domains

and are rated on 7-point scales.

<P>

These same investigators have developed a 32-item observational measure,

the Family Day Care Rating Scale (FDCRS), to assess process quality in child

care homes (Harms and Clifford, 1989). Some items parallel items on the ITERS

and the ECERS, but other items are unique because the instrument &#147;tries

to remain realistic for family day care home settings by not requiring that

things be done as they are in day care centers&#148; (p. 1).

<P>

As can be seen on Tables <A HREF="table1.htm">1</A>,

<A HREF="table2.htm">2</A>, and <A HREF="table3.htm">3</A>, these measures

are used widely in child care research. The measures have important strengths,

including having good psychometric properties and being relatively easy to

use reliably. Their widespread use means that cross-study comparisons are

possible. These measures also have some limitations. The global composite

score combines features of the physical environment, social experiences,

and working conditions for staff. Some of these areas may well have greater

influences on children&#146;s intellectual functioning or social-emotional

well-being than others. The composite score may underestimate effects relative

to more targeted scales. A second limitation is that these measures are

setting-specific. As a result, they cannot be used as interchangeable measures

of quality, meaning that it is not possible to make simple comparisons across

types of care or to combine scores in omnibus analyses that look at quality

effects across different types of care. A third limitation is that these

measures are not appropriate for assessing in-home care given by nannies

or grandparents.

<P>

The Observational Record of the Caregiving Environment (ORCE) was developed

to address these limitations (NICHD Early Child Care Research Network, 1996,

in press-a). Because psychological theory and research have indicated the

central role of experiences with caring adults for children&#146;s well-being

and development, the ORCE focuses on this domain. Both time sampled behavioral

counts of caregiver actions (e.g., responds to vocalization, asks questions,

speaks negatively) and qualitative ratings of those behaviors over time to

characterize caregivers&#146; behavior with individual children are collected

during a minimum of four 44-minute observation cycles spread over a two-day

period. At the end of each 44-minute cycle, observers use 4-point ratings

scaled from 1 = &#147;not at all characteristic&#148; to 4 = &#147;highly

characteristic&#148; to describe caregiver behavior. A positive caregiving

composite score is created by obtaining a mean score across scales over all

of the ORCE cycles at a given age period. Higher scores indicate caregivers

who are more sensitive and responsive to a child&#146;s needs, who are warm

and positive, who are cognitively stimulating, and who are not detached or

hostile. Unlike the ECERS, ITERS, or FDCRS, the ORCE can be used in all types

of child care and with children across the first five years. Age-appropriate

behavioral descriptors for caregivers&#146; behaviors with infants, toddlers,

and preschoolers are provided.

<P>

Another commonly used process measure is the Caregiver Interaction Scale

(Arnett, 1989) that rates teachers&#146; sensitivity during interactions

with children. This 26-item measure yields three scores (sensitivity&#151;warm,

attentive, engaged; harshness&#151;critical, punitive; detachment&#151;low

levels of interaction, interest, or supervision) which are combined to create

an overall caregiver quality score. The ratings are made after two 45-minute

observations conducted on two separate occasions by two separate observers.

<P>

The Assessment Profile (Abbott-Shim &amp; Sibley, 1992a, 1992b) assesses

different aspects of quality, namely features related to health and safety,

physical facilities, and individualized child services. Different forms of

the instrument are available for child care homes and centers. These forms

list individual items that are viewed as exemplars of (a) healthy, safe settings,

(b) rich physical environments, and (c) settings that meet the needs of adult

staff. Individual items are scored using a yes/no format, with &#147;yes&#148;

designating items that were either observed or reported by staff. These items

can be scored reliably (see NICHD Early Child Care Research Network, 1996).

Caregivers have been observed to offer more positive caregiving in settings

that receive higher Profile scores (NICHD Early Child Care Research Network,

1996, in press-a).

<P>

The CC-HOME Inventory is a measure of process quality that uses a checklist

approach to create a quality score across multiple domains, including the

health and safety of the physical environment, variety of experiences, and

materials (NICHD Early Child Care Research Network, 1996). Derived from Bradley

and Caldwell&#146;s well-known assessment of the quality of the home environment,

45 items are scored on a yes/no basis and then summed (alpha = .81). In one

study, children who attended better-quality child care homes as measured

by the CC-HOME Inventory obtained higher Bayley scores at 24 months and higher

school readiness and language comprehension scores at 36 months, in comparison

to children who attended poorer-quality child care homes (Clarke-Stewart,

Vandell, Burchinal, O&#146;Brien, and McCartney, 2000).

<P>

Other measures have been less successful in providing reliable and valid

assessments of process quality. For example, Lamb and colleagues failed to

find concurrent associations between child care quality and child functioning

in their study of child care in Sweden (Broberg, Hwang, Lamb, and Bookstein,

1990). One factor that likely contributed to the lack of significant relations

was problems with their quality measure. The Belsky-Walker Checklist (Broberg

et al., 1990) asks observers to check off if 13 positive events (e.g., caregiver

provided verbal elaboration, caregiver gives heightened emotional display;

signs of positive regard ) and 7 negative events (e.g., child cries; child

aimless; caregivers in non-child conversations) occur at least once during

3-minute observation intervals. This 3-minute time observation frame was

substantially longer than the 10- to 30-second intervals recommended for

recording social interactions (Yarrow and Zahn-Waxler, 1979). Consequently,

the checklist may have failed to detect meaningful distinctions in caregiver

behavior because the time interval was too long to detect meaningful differences.

This checklist underscores the challenge of designing and assessing process

quality. Detecting relations between process quality and child outcomes requires

robust measures.

<H3>

  Structural and Caregiver Characteristics

</H3>

<P>

A second approach to describing child care quality is in terms of their

structural and caregiver characteristics. Characteristics such as child:adult

ratio, group class size, caregiver formal education, and caregiver specialized

training are viewed as more distal contributors to quality environments.

Structural and caregiver characteristics are the only quality indicators

obtained in survey studies such as the National Child Care Survey (Hofferth,

Brayfield, Deich, and Holcomb, 1991), the National Household Education Survey

(Hofferth et al., 1998), and the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (Blau,

1999-c). Structural and caregiver characteristics have been collected in

addition to process-oriented measures in studies such as the Cost, Quality

and Outcome Study, thereby permitting relations between these characteristics

and process quality to be evaluated.

<P>

Relations between structural and caregiver characteristics and process quality

are well-documented in the research literature. <A HREF="table1.htm">Table

1</A> is a compilation of the studies conducted in the United States that

have considered this issue. The table includes information regarding sample

size, type of care setting, the structural and caregiver characteristics

that were measured, the process quality measures that were collected, and

findings that were obtained. As indicated in <A HREF="table1.htm">Table 1</A>,

some studies have considered bivariate relations between structural and caregiver

characteristics, and process quality using Pearson correlations and t-tests.

Other studies (Blau, in press; NICHD Early Child Care Research Network, 1996,

in press-a; Phillipsen, Burchinal, Howes, and Cryer, 1997) utilized multiple

regression techniques in an effort to isolate the relative impact of different

characteristics. As documented on the table, the multivariate results are

consistent with the bivariate and global composite analyses. As is evident

in <A HREF="table1.htm">Table 1</A>, studies have considered both global

composites of structural and caregiver characteristics and individual factors

in relation to process quality (Howes, 1990; Vandell and Powers, 1983).

<P>

When child:adult ratios are lower, caregivers spend less time managing children

in their classrooms and children appear less apathetic and distressed (Ruopp,

Travers, Glantz, and Coelen, 1979). When child:adult ratios are lower, caregivers

offer more stimulating, responsive, warm, and supportive care (Clarke-Stewart,

Gruber, and Fitzgerald, 1994; Howes, 1983; NICHD Early Child Care Research

Network, 1996, in press-a; Phillipsen et al., 1997; Volling and Feagans,

1995). Ratios also are associated with global process quality scores (Burchinal,

Roberts, Nabors, and Bryant, 1996; Howes, Phillips, and Whitebook, 1992;

McCartney, et al., 1997; Scarr, Eisenberg, and Deater-Deckard, 1994; Whitebook,

Howes, and Phillips, 1990). For example, in a study of 414 children who resided

in three states, Howes et al. (1992) determined that &#147;good&#148; and

&#147;very good&#148; scores on the ITERS and ECERS were more likely in infant

classrooms with ratios of 3:1 or less, in toddler classrooms with ratios

of 4:1 or less, and in preschool classrooms with ratios of 9:1 or less. More

than half of the infant classrooms with ratios higher than 4:1 and preschool

classrooms with ratios higher than 5:1 received scores that were categorized

as &#147;inadequate.&#148;

<P>

Group size also has been considered in relation to process quality. In

simultaneous multiple regressions that included group size, ratio, caregiver

education, and caregiver specialized training, the NICHD Study of Early Child

Care (1996; in press-a) determined group size to be uniquely associated with

positive caregiving. Similarly, Ruopp et al. (1979) reported group size to

predict caregiver behavior even when child:adult ratio was controlled. In

these studies, caregivers were more responsive, socially stimulating, and

less restrictive when there were fewer children in their classrooms. These

relations also are observed in child-care homes (Elicker, Fortner-Wood, and

Noppe, 1999; Stith and Davis, 1984).

<P>

Caregivers&#146; formal education and specialized training also are related

to quality of care. Caregivers who have more formal education (NICHD Early

Child Care Research Network, 1996; Phillipsen et al., 1997) and more specialized

training pertaining to children (Arnett, 1989; Berk, 1985; Howes, 1983, 1997)

offer care that is more stimulating, warm, and supportive. Highly educated

and specially trained caregivers also are more likely to organize materials

and activities into more age-appropriate environments for children (NICHD

Early Child Care Research Network, 1996). These settings are more likely

to receive higher scores on the global quality scales such as the ECERS,

ITERS, ORCE, and CC-HOME (Clarke-Stewart, et al., 2000; Howes and Smith,

1995; NICHD Early Child Care Research Network, 1996, in press-a).

<P>

Repeated-measure analyses conducted for children in the NICHD Study of Early

Child Care at 15, 24, and 36 months ascertained that group size and child:adult

ratios were stronger predictors of process quality for infants, whereas caregiver

educational background and training were stronger predictors of process quality

for preschoolers (NICHD Study of Early Child Care, in press-a). These relations

do not appear to be an artifact of restricted ranges. The standard deviations

for caregiver formal education and caregiving training were similar at different

assessment points. Standard deviations for ratio and group size increased

for older children. The differential patterns, then, suggest the merits of

an age-related strategy for improving process quality. Ratios and group size

may be more critical for infant care; caregiver training and education may

be more critical for preschoolers.

<P>

Caregiver wages is another factor associated with process quality (Howes,

Phillips, and Whitebook, 1992; Scarr et al., 1994). See

<A HREF="table1.htm">Table 1</A>. In the Three-State Study, Scarr et al.

reported teacher wages to be the single best predictor of process quality.

In analyses of the Cost, Quality, and Outcome data set, Phillipsen et al.

(1997) determined lead teachers wages to significantly predict scores on

the ECERS and the Arnett sensitivity scales.

<P>

Although much of the research literature has reported significant relations

between structural and caregiver characteristics, and process quality, Blau

(in press) has cautioned that these associations may be the result of

uncontrolled factors that are confounded with the structural and caregiver

characteristics. He argues that these confounding factors might include center

policies, curriculum, and directors&#146; leadership skills. To address this

perceived shortcoming, Blau conducted secondary analyses on 274 child care

centers that were part of the Cost, Quality, and Outcomes Study. In his first

set of analyses, Blau conducted regressions to determine if individual structural

and caregiver characteristics were associated with process quality when other

factors (teacher, family, center characteristics) were controlled. His findings

were consistent with other reports. When child:adult ratios were larger,

ITERS and ECERS scores were lower. When caregivers had attended college or

training workshops and when caregivers had college degrees in fields related

to child care, ECERS scores were higher.

<P>

Blau then tested relations between structural-regulable characteristics and

process quality using a more stringent fixed-effects model that included

center as a control variable. This fixed-effects approach was possible because

two classrooms were typically observed in each center. In centers in which

there were both infants and preschoolers, one classroom of each type was

observed. In centers serving only preschoolers, two preschool classrooms

were selected randomly. When center was controlled along with type of classroom

(infant vs. preschool), relations between structural and caregiver features

and process quality were reduced. Blau interprets this reduction to mean

that unobserved center characteristics account for the previously reported

relations between structural factors and process quality. Our concern, however,

is that the center fixed-effect control is inappropriate. As Blau himself

noted, this approach requires within-center variability in the structural

characteristics. It is unlikely that classrooms in the same center are highly

variable in terms of caregiver training, ratio, or group size, especially

given that the model also controlled for type of classroom (infant/toddler

vs. preschool). The inclusion of the specific center as a control variable

resulted in an underestimation of effects.

<H3>

  Health and Safety Indicators of Quality

</H3>

<P>

Global process quality measures such as the ECERS, CC-HOME, and Profile

Assessment include health and safety indicators as a component of process

quality. Research conducted in the medical and public health arenas has focused

more exclusively on these indicators in relation to children&#146;s physical

health and safety. More hygienic practices by staff and children (Niffenegger,

1997; St. Sauver, Khurana, Kao, and Foxman, 1998) are associated with fewer

respiratory illnesses and other infectious diseases. These practices include

frequent handwashing after diapering, before meals, and after nose wiping.

Child injuries in child care settings are most likely to occur on playgrounds

and are most due to falls from climbing equipment (Briss, Sacks, Addis, Kresnow,

and O&#146;Neil, 1995; Browning, Runyon, and Kotch, 1996). Height of the

equipment and lack of an impact-absorbing surface under the equipment have

been consistently identified as the factors most highly associated with injuries

that required medical treatment. The North Carolina Smart Start initiative

was successful in improving the safety of child care centers with playground

improvement grants (Kotch and Guthrie, 1998).

The weight of the research evidence demonstrates significant relationships

</H2>

<P>

There are substantial challenges for researchers and policy makers who seek

to answer questions about the effects of child care quality on children&#146;s

development. One well-acknowledged difficulty is the absence of well-controlled

experiments in which children are randomly assigned to child care that varies

in quality. Instead, investigators have studied children whose families and

child care settings are willing to participate. This examination of naturally

occurring child care, as opposed to more controlled experiments, poses challenges

for researchers and policy makers (Blau, 1999c; Lamb, 1998; NICHD Early Child

Care Research Network, 1994; Vandell and Corasaniti, 1990). These challenges

are related to family/child selection biases and to restricted variability

in quality scores. Before reviewing research findings pertaining to effects

of quality, we briefly describe common strategies for addressing these research

challenges.

<H3>

  Methodological Challenges

</H3>

<P>

<I>Family/Child Selection Biases</I>. The possibility that families differ

in their child care choices is a topic of interest in its own right (NICHD

Early Child Care Research Network, 1997; Singer, Fuller, Keiley, and Wolf,

1998). It also is a critical issue for investigators who are interested in

ascertaining the effects of child care on children (Howes and Olenick, 1986;

Vandell, 1997). The problem is that ostensible &#147;effects&#148; of child

care quality may be artifacts of family characteristics that are confounded

with child care quality. As a result of this concern, it has become standard

practice for researchers to incorporate family selection factors into their

analyses. As is evident in Tables <A HREF="table2.htm">2</A> and

<A HREF="table3.htm">3</A>, almost all studies conducted in recent years

have included controls for family characteristics.

<P>

As an example of this strategy, the NICHD Study of Early Child Care has utilized

three criteria for identifying family variables that are then used as selection

controls in analyses: (1) the family characteristic is significantly related

to child care, (2) the family characteristic is related to the child outcome

of interest, and (3) the family characteristic is not highly related to other

family factors. The third criterion is applied to reduce collinearity among

family characteristics.

<P>

At one level, concern about family selection bias is clearly merited. There

is evidence, for example, that type and quality of child care are related

to parents&#146; education and income (see <A HREF="#fig1">Figure 1</A>).

<P>

<A NAME="fig1"><IMG SRC="fig1.gif" WIDTH="632" HEIGHT="455" ALT="Figure 1. Child Care Usage by Maternal Education and Family Income During the Child's First Three Years."

    BORDER="0" ALIGN="CENTER"></A>

<P>

Parents who have higher incomes and more education are more likely to place

their children in centers that have higher ECERS scores, lower child:adult

ratios, and better-trained teachers (Blau, 1999c; Peisner-Feinberg and Burchinal,

1997). Children with more sensitive mothers are more likely to be placed

in care arrangements that offer more positive caregiving experiences (NICHD

Early Child Care Research Network, 1997). Children whose home environments

are more cognitively stimulating and more emotionally supportive are more

likely to be placed in child care settings that are stimulating and supportive

(NICHD Early Child Care Research Network, in press-b). These family factors,

if not controlled, may masquerade as child care effects.

<P>

At another level, however, selection effects do not appear to be as large

as initially thought. In the Cost, Quality, and Outcomes Study, for example,

the correlation between maternal education and the ECERS was .24; the correlation

between family income and the ECERS was .09. In the NICHD Study of Early

Child Care, correlations between maternal education and ORCE positive caregiving

ratings were .11 at 6 months, .14 at 15 months, .22 at 24 months, and .19

at 36 months. Correlations between family income and ORCE positive caregiving

were typically lower than these figures. These relatively modest associations

between child care quality and family factors suggest that selection effects

are not substantial, at least within the range of studies that have been

conducted. In the future, selection effects may be greater as welfare reform

is fully implemented and the numbers of children in child care increase.

<P>

<I>Variability in Child Care Quality</I>. The ability to detect child care

quality effects also is dependent on obtaining sufficient variability in

quality scores. Obviously, if there is no variation in quality, it is not

possible to detect variations associated with quality. If quality is sampled

within a truncated range, effects associated with quality are reduced and

larger samples are needed to detect differences. One reason that the Swedish

studies have not detected quality effects may be the restricted range of

the quality scores that were sampled, coupled with relatively small sample

sizes (Broberg, Wessels, Lamb, and Hwang, 1997; Lamb, Hwang, et al., 1988).

These same issues are pertinent to child care research in the United States,

when restricted ranges of quality are sampled and sample sizes are small.

<P>

<I>Control for Prior Child Adjustment</I>. A third challenge is determining

when and how to control appropriately for prior child adjustment in examinations

of child care effects. Some researchers have argued that stronger tests of

child care quality require controls for prior child adjustment. Such controls

could be used successfully in studies of after-school programs that controlled

for children&#146;s adjustment prior to entry into the programs (Vandell

and Posner, 1999). Controls for prior child adjustment in studies of early

child care quality are more difficult. Children typically begin child care

during their first year of life, prior to the time that robust and reliable

measures of child cognitive, language, and social adjustment can be administered.

Using measures of child adjustment collected at some later period, after

substantial child care experience has accrued, does not make sense because

these measures may well be a reflection of the effects of quality to that

point. By controlling for child adjustment scores that were already affected

by quality, we may be eliminating (or at least minimizing) the very quality

effects that are of interest. This potential confounding of child care quality

and child adjustment scores means that fixed-effects models that control

for prior (or concurrent) child adjustment must be applied with caution.

<H3>

  The Conceptual Model

</H3>

<P>

With these methodological challenges in mind, we turn to the conceptual framework

that guides our evaluation of child care quality. This model is presented

in <A HREF="#fig2">Figure 2</A>.

<P>

<A NAME="fig2"><IMG SRC="fig2.gif" WIDTH="610" HEIGHT="399" ALT="Figure 2. A Conceptual model of Relations Between Chld Care Quality and Children's Developmental Outcomes."

    BORDER="0"></A>

<P>

A central feature in the model is an awareness that children are not randomly

assigned to child care. Child care quality is expected to be related to family

characteristics including demographic, psychological, and attitudinal

differences. Because these family characteristics&#151;income, parental

education, maternal sensitivity, stimulating and supportive home

environments&#151;also can predict children&#146;s developmental outcomes,

it is necessary to control for them. Otherwise, quality effects may be

overestimated or underestimated. As shown in the model, research also needs

to take into account other child care parameters, such as amount of care

and type of care, that may be confounded with quality or that may contribute

independently to child outcomes.

<P>

Children&#146;s developmental outcomes are considered in relation to process

quality and in relation to structural and caregiver characteristics.

Specifically, the model posits that process quality is directly related to

child developmental outcomes. Structural and caregiver characteristics are

posited to be indirectly related to child outcomes, through their influence

on process quality. It is expected that structural and caregiver characteristics

also directly influence child outcomes in ways that are not mediated through

the available measures of process quality. In the sections that follow, research

findings pertaining to this model are considered in terms of concurrent relations

between child care quality and children&#146;s development, and in terms

of longer-term associations between child care quality and child adjustment.

<H3>

  Concurrent Associations between Process Quality and Child Outcomes

</H3>

<P>

<A HREF="table2.htm">Table 2</A> is a summary description of results from

empirical studies that examined relations between process quality and child

developmental outcomes. The description includes sample size, child&#146;s

age at the time of the concurrent assessments, the measures of process quality

that were used, the measures of structural quality that were used, the controls

(if any) for family factors, the child developmental domains that were

considered, and a summary of findings.

<P>

As is evident is <A HREF="table2.htm">Table 2</A>, some of the available

research focuses on relations between process quality measures and child

behavior in the child-care setting. Other research considers relations between

process quality and child behavior outside of child care. The former set

of studies provide descriptions of children&#146;s immediate reactions to

caregiving experiences that are emotionally supportive and cognitively enriching

versus experiences that are less supportive and enriching. These studies

yield firsthand evidence about children&#146;s reactions to care of varying

quality. The latter set of studies considers whether reactions to quality

experiences are evident in children&#146;s behavior in other settings.

<P>

<I>Process Quality and Children&#146;s Behavior in Child Care</I>. Several

investigators have delineated systematic relations between process quality

and children&#146;s behavior in the child care setting (see

<A HREF="table2.htm">Table 2</A>). For example, controlling for child gender

and family socioeconomic status, children appear happier in child care settings

where activities are developmentally appropriate and caregivers are more

involved (Hestenes, Kontos, and Bryan, 1993). Children show more intense

negative affect when their caregivers are less involved with them. Children

display closer and more secure attachment relationships with their caregivers

when the caregivers are more positive and responsive to the children&#146;s

needs (Elicker et al., 1999; Howes et al., 1992; Howes and Smith, 1995).

<P>

Associations between caregiver-child interactions and children&#146;s

interactions with peers also have been reported (see

<A HREF="table2.htm">Table&nbsp;2</A>). Children who have more positive

interactions with their caregivers and more secure relationships with their

caregivers appear more prosocial and positively engaged with their classmates

(Holloway and Reichart-Erickson, 1988; Howes et al., 1992; Kontos and

Wilcox-Herzog, 1997). Children who have opportunities to participate in

activities such as art, blocks, and dramatic play demonstrate greater cognitive

competence during their free play (Kontos and Wilcox-Herzog, 1997). Taken

together, these studies suggest that experiences associated with better quality

foster competent performance in the child care setting. By the same token,

children are less likely to display competent behavior in child care settings

characterized by lower process quality.

<P>

<I>Process Quality and Children&#146;s Behavior in Other Settings</I>. The

next issue is whether process quality is related to children&#146;s behavior

in other settings. Several studies (see

<A HREF="table2.htm">Table&nbsp;2</A>) have found higher quality child care

is associated with better performance on standardized language tests, even

when family characteristics are controlled (Burchinal et al., 1996; Dunn,

Beach, and Kontos, 1994; Goelman, 1988; McCartney, 1984; NICHD Early Child

Care Research Network, in press-b; Peisner-Feinberg and Burchinal, 1997;

Schliecker, White, and Jacobs, 1991). These relations are evident when the

process measure is a global score such as the ITERS, ECERS, or FDCRS, and

when the process measure focuses more narrowly on caregiver language stimulation.

It is notable that associations between process quality and language performance

are evident for child care that occurs in both centers and homes.

<P>

Children&#146;s performance on standardized cognitive tests also has been

linked to concurrent process quality. Infants who attend centers with higher

ITERS scores receive better scores on the Bayley Mental Development Inventory

than infants in poorer quality centers (Burchinal et al., 1996). Similarly,

children who attend centers that have higher ECERS scores receive higher

scores on the CBI intelligence scale (Dunn, 1993). The Cost, Quality, and

Outcome Study reported that higher ECERS scores were associated with better

scores on the reading subtest of the Woodcock-Johnson (Peisner-Feinberg and

Burchinal, 1997).

<P>

Finally, process quality is related to children&#146;s social and emotional

functioning. High-quality care as measured by the ECERS is related to greater

child interest and participation, whereas poorer process quality is associated

with heightened behavior problems (Hausfather, Tohari, LaRoche, and Engelsmann,

1997; Peisner-Feinberg and Burchinal, 1997). The Bermuda Study (Phillips,

McCartney, and Scarr, 1987) found higher ECERS scores to predict both caregiver

and parent reports of children&#146;s considerateness and sociability, and

caregiver reports of children&#146;s higher intelligence and task orientation

and less anxiety.

<P>

Although the majority of studies (see <A HREF="table2.htm">Table&nbsp;2</A>)

have reported significant relations between process measures of quality and

concurrent child functioning, it should be noted that there are exceptions.

Scarr and colleagues did not find relations between process quality and

children&#146;s social outcomes (McCartney et al., 1997). Measurement problems

may have contributed to the lack of findings. For example, observers were

only moderately reliable on the measures of quality, with exact agreement

of 55&#150;58 percent between sites on the ITERS/ECERS. Cross-site reliability

in the classroom observations of children&#146;s social behavior (a key dependent

variable) also was poor to moderate, with kappa coefficients ranging from

.40 to .76. The likelihood of detecting associations may have been hampered

by unreliable measurements.

<H3>

  Concurrent Associations between Structural and Caregiver Characteristics,

  and Child Outcomes

</H3>

<P>

There has been a longstanding interest in structural and caregiver

characteristics in relation to children&#146;s developmental outcomes, in

part because the structural and caregiver characteristics are easier to measure

and to monitor than process quality. An early study&#151;the National Day

Care Study (Ruopp et al., 1979)&#151;included a clinical trial in which 3-

and 4-year-olds were randomly assigned to 29 preschool classrooms with different

child:adult ratios and levels of staff education. Two levels of ratio (5.4:1

vs. 7.4:1) were contrasted along with three levels of staff education (B.A.,

Associate of Arts, or less than an A.A. in early childhood education). Child

behaviors were assessed at the beginning of the intervention and 9 months

later. Children assigned to classrooms with fewer children obtained greater

gains on measures of receptive language, general knowledge, cooperative behavior,

and verbal initiations, and exhibited less hostility and conflict in their

interactions with others than did children assigned to classrooms with larger

numbers of children. Children whose assigned teachers had more education

and training achieved greater gains in cooperative behavior, task persistence,

and school readiness than children whose teachers had less education and

training.

<P>

Correlational studies also have reported concurrent associations between

child:adult ratio and children&#146;s language, cognitive, and social

functioning. Infants who attend centers with smaller child:adult ratios are

found to have better receptive and expressive language skills than children

who attend centers with larger child:adult ratios (Burchinal et al., 1996;

Vernon-Feagans, Emanuel, and Blood, 1997). Lower child:adult ratios also

are associated with higher Bayley scores (Burchinal et al., 1996) and with

better social knowledge and social behaviors (Holloway and Reichhart-Erickson,

1988).

<P>

Teachers&#146; education and training also are related concurrently to child

performance and adjustment. Burchinal et al. (1996) report that infants have

better expressive language skills when their caregivers are better educated.

Preschoolers&#146; receptive language skills are higher when caregivers have

at least an Associate of Arts degree in a child-related field (Howes, 1997).

Children whose caregivers have degrees in child-related fields received higher

CBI intelligence scores than children with less-educated caregivers (Dunn,

1993). Caregiver education and training in child care homes are similarly

related to children&#146;s performance on standardized cognitive measures

(Clarke-Stewart et al., 2000).

<P>

Observations of children&#146;s experiences in classrooms and child care

homes suggest why these relations might occur. Children are more likely to

engage in language activities, complex play with objects, and creative activities

in their classrooms when teachers have bachelor degrees in child-related

fields (Howes, 1997). Toddlers are more likely to talk with their caregivers

and to engage in complex play when classrooms have smaller child:adult ratios

(Howes and Rubenstein, 1985). Toddlers are more likely to cry and to have

their actions restricted in classrooms in which group sizes are larger (Howes

and Rubenstein, 1985). In child care homes, positive caregiving is more likely

when group sizes are smaller, caregivers are more educated, and caregivers

have more specialized training pertaining to children (Clarke-Stewart et

al., 2000).

<P>

An alternative research strategy has been to consider aggregated structural

and caregiver characteristics. For example, the NICHD Study of Early Child

Care (NICHD Early Child Care Research Network, 1999a) assessed four structural

and caregiver characteristics (child:staff ratio, group size, caregiver

specialized training in child development or early childhood education, and

caregiver formal education) in terms of guidelines recommended by the American

Public Health Association. The investigators then summed the number of structural

and caregiver characteristics that met recommended guidelines, resulting

in summed scores of 0 to 4. At 24 months, 10&#150;12 percent of classrooms

met all four standards, whereas 34 percent of the classrooms did so at 36

months. At 24 months, 9 percent of the observed centers met none of the

recommended standards; 3 percent of the centers met none of the standards

at 36 months.

<P>

Associations between the number of child care standards that were met and

child outcomes were then tested, with family income and maternal sensitivity

controlled (see <A HREF="tables4-13.htm#t4">Table&nbsp;4</A>). Children who

attended centers that met more recommended guidelines had fewer behavior

problems at 24 and 36 months, and higher school readiness and language

comprehension scores at 36 months. There were significant linear trends between

the number of recommended standards that were met and children&#146;s concurrent

adjustment.

<P>

Analyses also compared children who were enrolled in classrooms that met

a given individual standard with children whose classrooms did not meet that

standard (see <A HREF="tables4-13.htm#t5">Table&nbsp;4</A>). At 24 months,

children displayed fewer behavior problems and more positive social behaviors

when centers met the recommended child:adult ratio. At 36 months, children

whose caregivers had specialized training or who had more formal education

exhibited fewer behavior problems and obtained higher school readiness and

language comprehension scores.

<H3>

  Longer-Term Associations between Process Quality and Child Developmental

  Outcomes

</H3>

<P>

Investigators also have considered longer-term associations between process

quality and children&#146;s developmental outcomes. A compilation of these

studies can be found in <A HREF="table3.htm">Table 3</A>. Included in the

table are studies that considered relations between earlier child care

experiences and later adjustment. To our knowledge, there are no published

accounts that relate early child care quality to children&#146;s adjustment

beyond middle childhood. <A HREF="table3.htm">Table 3</A> presents information

regarding sample size, controls for family factors, descriptions of the quality

measures, descriptions of the child outcomes, and specific findings.

<P>

Findings on this issue have been reported by the NICHD Study of Early Child

Care. Extensive information about the children, the families and child care

was collected during home visits (1, 6, 15, 24, and 36 months), child care

visits (6, 15, 24, and 36 months), and laboratory assessments (15, 24, and

36 months). Phone interviews were conducted every 3 months to track hours

and types of child care. Children who were in nonmaternal care for more than

10 hours a week were observed in that care. The investigators (NICHD Early

Child Care Research Network, 1998; 1999b; in press-b) asked if cumulative

positive caregiving (the average of ORCE positive caregiving ratings collected

during visits at each observation) is related to child developmental outcomes

at 24 and 36 months. Mental development at 24 months was assessed in the

laboratory with the Bayley. School readiness was measured using the Bracken

School Readiness Scale, a scale that assesses knowledge of color, letter

identification, number/counting, shapes, and comparisons. Expressive language

skills and receptive language skills were measured at 36 months using the

Reynell Developmental Language Scales. Mother and caregiver reports of child

behavior problems were obtained using composite scores from the Child Behavior

Checklist and the Adaptive Social Behavior Inventory. Peer skills were assessed

during a videotaped semistructured play situation with a friend.

<P>

Relations between cumulative positive caregiving and child development were

tested in analyses that controlled for child and family factors (child gender,

maternal education, family income, maternal psychological adjustment, home

quality assessed by Bradley and Caldwell&#146;s HOME scale and videotaped

observations of mother-child interaction) and other aspects of child care

(time in center and total hours in care from 3 to 36 months).

<A HREF="tables4-13.htm#t6">Table 6</A> summarizes findings from regression

analyses and resultant partial <U>r</U>s that indicated effect sizes. As

shown, the quality of child care during the first 3 years was related to

children&#146;s school readiness, expressive language, and receptive language

at 3 years. Also shown on <A HREF="tables4-13.htm#t6">Table 6</A> are comparisons

of children in high-quality and low-quality child care (defined with quartile

splits), using the same covariates. This extreme group approach yielded

<U>d</U> statistics. Effect sizes using this extreme group approach were

significant for measures of school readiness, expressive language, and receptive

language at 36 months.

<P>

In order to evaluate the magnitude of these findings, the NICHD investigators

conducted parallel analyses that tested relations between quality of the

home environment during the first 3 years and the child developmental outcomes

(using the same covariates), and relations between child care hours during

the first 3 years and child developmental outcomes (using the same covariates).

<A HREF="tables4-13.htm#t6">Table 6</A> presents these effect sizes as well.

Effects associated with quality of the home environment (the cumulative composite

scores created from the Bradley and Caldwell HOME scale and mother-child

interaction ratings) were roughly twice the size of the child care quality

score. Effects associated with child care hours were substantially smaller

than effects associated with child care quality. The NICHD investigators

argued that these findings suggest effects of child care quality assessed

longitudinally to age 3 years were neither huge nor trivial, but were large

enough to be meaningful. It also should be noted that these effect sizes

are likely to be a conservative estimate because of the selective participation

by higher-quality settings. If the poorest quality child care settings refused

to allow observations to be conducted, the range of quality scores would

be truncated, resulting in smaller effect sizes.

<P>

Longer-term findings obtained from the Otitis Media Study (Burchinal, Roberts,

Riggins, Zeisel, Neebe, and Bryant, in press) are consistent with those reported

in the NICHD study. In that study, hierarchical linear models were tested.

Observations of classroom quality obtained annually over a 3-year period

were used to predict children&#146;s adjustment up to age 3 years. Higher-quality

child care over time was associated with better cognitive development, better

receptive and expressive language skills, and better functional communication

skills over time, controlling for child gender, family poverty status, and

home environment quality.

<P>

A limitation with both of these reports is that children were studied only

to age 3. Thus, it cannot be ascertained if early effects are harbingers

of later differences or if these effects dissipate by the time that children

enter grade school. As additional findings from these ongoing investigations

become available, they can be used to identify conditions under which early

child care quality differences are maintained or dissipate.

<P>

In the meantime, the Cost, Quality, and Outcomes Study has information that

is relevant to this issue (Peisner-Feinberg et al., 1999). Started in 1993,

observations were conducted in child care centers located in four

states&#151;California, Colorado, Connecticut, and North Carolina&#151;that

varied in licensing standards. Centers were evenly distributed in each state

into nonprofit and for-profit programs. Within the eligible programs, 509

preschool classrooms and 224 infant/toddler classrooms were studied. Process

quality was rated using the ECERS or ITERS, the Caregiver Interaction Scale

(Arnett, 1989), and the Teacher Involvement Scale (Howes and Stewart, 1987).

Quality indicators were combined into a single process quality composite.

<P>

A subsample of children was followed through 2 years of child care and the

first 3 years of formal schooling (kindergarten through second grade). Children

were assessed for receptive language skills, reading ability, and math skills.

Child care and school teachers rated the children&#146;s cognitive/attention

skills, sociability, and problem behaviors each year. Longitudinal hierarchical

linear models examined relations between the child care quality composite

collected at age 4 (Time 1) and children&#146;s developmental outcomes through

grade 2. In all analyses, selection factors (maternal education, child&#146;s

gender and ethnicity) were controlled statistically.

<P>

Children who were enrolled in higher-quality child care classrooms as

preschoolers were found to have better receptive language skills. Effect

sizes for receptive language were moderate for the preschool period (.60

and .51 for the 2 years preceding school entry), more modest in kindergarten

(.30), and not significant in second grade. Child care quality also was related

to children&#146;s math skills. Children who were enrolled in higher-quality

child care had better math skills prior to school entry and during kindergarten

and second grade, with modest effect sizes across the years (.20&#150;.29).

The relation was stronger for children whose mothers had less education.

In further analyses that controlled for the quality of the elementary school

classroom, the relations between child care quality and children&#146;s math

skills were maintained. It is notable that a similar finding was obtained

in research conducted in Sweden. Broberg et al. (1997) found that process

quality assessed using the Belsky and Walker checklist at 16, 28, and 40

months predicted better math skills at age 8, even after controlling for

child and family factors.

<P>

Other research has considered longer-term associations between child care

quality and children&#146;s social-emotional outcomes. Howes (1990) focused

on one particular aspect of process quality, child care socialization practices,

in relation to children&#146;s subsequent developmental outcomes.

Caregivers&#146; involvement and investment in child compliance were measured

during naturalistic observations in the child care setting. Having a more

involved and invested caregiver during the first 3 years was associated with

kindergarten teachers&#146; reports that the children had fewer behavior

problems and better verbal IQs.

<P>

<I>Alternative Views</I>. As shown in <A HREF="table3.htm">Table 3</A>, some

investigators have not found relations between child care quality and later

developmental outcomes. For example, Chin-Quee and Scarr (1994) did not find

evidence of long-term effects in a longitudinal follow-up of the Bermuda

study. In the initial study, concurrent associations were reported between

process quality as measured by the ECERS and child developmental outcomes

(McCartney, 1984; Phillips et al., 1987). In the follow-up study, teachers

rated social competence (peer relations and cooperative behavior) and academic

achievement for 97 of the original sample of 166, when children were in grades

1 and 2 (Time 2) and grades 3 and 4 (Time 3). Associations between the quality

indicators during the preschool years and competence at school were tested

with hierarchical regressions in which parental values, age of entry into

care, and total amount of child care before school entry were controlled.

Neither the global quality score nor the specific measures of caregiver language

predicted children&#146;s social competence and academic achievement at Time

2 or Time 3.

<P>

A longitudinal follow-up of children who participated in the Three-State

Study also failed to detect long-term effects (Deater-Deckard, Pinkerton,

and Scarr, 1996). In this project, assessments of child care quality were

first obtained in 363 classrooms located in 120 centers in three states (Georgia,

Virginia, Massachusetts) when 718 study children were infants, toddlers,

and preschoolers. Process quality ratings were obtained by pulling items

pertaining to teacher-child interaction from the ECERS and ITERS and the

Assessment Profile (a process measure scored for presence or absence of specific

items). Four years later, follow-up assessments were conducted for 141 of

the original sample. Multiple regressions controlled for child (child adjustment

at Time 1, age at Time 2, child gender) and family characteristics (SES,

a composite of parenting stress and low emotional support, maternal endorsement

of harsh discipline practices). The child care quality measure was a composite

of the ITERS/ECERS, the Assessment Profile that measures physical facilities,

caregiver training and education, and caregiver wages. In these analyses,

the child care quality composite score at Time 1 did not predict changes

in children&#146;s behavior problems or social withdrawal at Time 2.

<P>

Although Scarr (1998) has argued that these studies demonstrate that child

care quality has little or no long-term impact on children&#146;s development,

the findings must be interpreted with caution. Both studies are based on

the assumption that a quality assessment obtained at one point in time is

an adequate and accurate representation of child care quality. Single assessments

might be sufficient if care arrangements and quality are stable; however,

a single observation is not adequate if care is unstable or changing. In

the Bermuda sample, Chin-Quee and Scarr (1994) reported that half the children

experienced one, two, or three arrangements during the intervening period,

and half experienced more than three arrangement changes. In the Three-State

study, no information about child care quality in the intervening four years

was collected. In both studies, it is difficult to interpret the meaning

of the null findings in light of no information about child care quality

across early childhood. Stronger, more valid tests of the effects of child

care quality need to take into account cumulative quality and the pattern

of quality over time.

<P>

The lack of long-term relations in the Three State Study may also reflect

limitations in the assessment of process quality. Only moderate interobserver

agreement was reported across the three research sites&#151;.58 for the ECERS

and .55 for the ITERS (McCartney et al., 1997). Lower relations between process

quality and child outcomes would be expected when process quality scores

are less reliable.

<H3>

  Longer-Term Associations between Structural and Caregiver Characteristics

  and Child Outcomes

</H3>

<P>

Other studies have considered relations between structural and caregiver

characteristics in relation to children&#146;s subsequent developmental outcomes

(see <A HREF="table3.htm">Table 3</A>). Howes (1988), for example, examined

structural and caregiver characteristics at 3 years in relation to

children&#146;s first-grade adjustment. Quality in 81 centers was defined

in terms of five areas: teacher training, child:adult ratio, group size,

a planned curriculum, and space. Higher-quality care met recognized standards

in all five areas; medium-quality care met standards on three or four dimensions,

and low-quality care met three or fewer standards. During the intervening

period, the 87 children attended the same university lab school, meaning

that they experienced classes with the same or similar structural and caregiver

characteristics.

<P>

In analyses that controlled for maternal work status, family structure, and

maternal education, Howes found that children who had attended higher-quality

child care programs prior to enrollment in the university school had fewer

behavior problems and better work habits as compared to children who had

attended lower quality programs. Additionally, boys who had attended

higher-quality centers received better first-grade teacher ratings of academic

performance compared to other boys.

<P>

Using a different sample of 80 children who were enrolled in center-based

care, Howes (1990) examined relations between a structural quality composite

(child:adult ratio, caregiver training, caregiver stability) measured at

18, 24, 30, and 36 months, and children&#146;s kindergarten adjustment.

High-quality care was defined as ratios of 4:1 or less for children who were

<U>&lt;</U> 2 years and 7:1 for children &gt; 2 years, caregivers with 12

units of college-level child development courses, and no more than two different

primary caregivers in the prior year. Low-quality care was defined as ratios

of 6:1 or higher for children who were 2 years or less and ratios of 10:1

for children who were older than 2 years, caregivers with no formal child

development training, and more than two primary caregivers in the prior year.

<P>

Associations between structural quality in the first 3 years and children&#146;s

later preschool and kindergarten adjustment were tested, controlling for

a family socialization composite and a family demographic composite. Children

with a history of poor-quality child care during the first 3 years were rated

by their preschool teachers as being more difficult and by their kindergarten

teachers as being more hostile. The children also engaged in less social

pretend play and displayed less positive affect in their preschool classroom.

<P>

Recent research from the Otitis Media Study has focused on specific structural

and caregiver characteristics in relation to subsequent child developmental

outcomes (Burchinal et al., in press). The researchers initially recruited

89 children who were 4 to 9 months of age for a study of the effects of otitis

media on children&#146;s development. Children attended 27 centers that varied

in quality. Child care quality was assessed annually using the ECERS and

ITERS. Children whose child care classrooms met recommended guidelines for

child-staff ratios exhibited better receptive language and functional

communication skills over time as compared to children whose classrooms did

not meet recommended ratio guidelines, controlling for child gender, family

poverty, and cognitive stimulation and emotional support in the home. Caregiver

education also predicted children&#146;s adjustment, but only for girls:

Girls whose caregivers had at least 14 years of education (with or without

early childhood training) had better cognitive and receptive language skills

over time compared to girls whose caregivers had fewer than 14 years of

education, controlling for the family factors.

<P>

Blau (1999c) also has examined structural and caregiver characteristics in

relation to children&#146;s subsequent developmental outcomes. For these

analyses, he used secondary data obtained from the National Longitudinal

Survey of Youth (NLSY), an ongoing nationally representative study of 12,652

youth begun in 1979. Beginning in 1986, information about children of the

female respondents was collected. Mothers also provided information about

their children&#146;s primary child care arrangements&#151;the number of

children cared for in the group, the number of adult care providers in the

arrangement, and whether the main caregiver had specialized training in early

childhood education or child development. Blau then averaged these maternal

reports of structural and caregiver characteristics through age 2 and for

ages 3&#150;5 years. Children completed the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test

(PPVT), a measure of receptive language skills, at 3 years or older. Mothers

reported on children&#146;s behavior problems at 4 years or older. Children

completed math and reading subscales of the Peabody Individual Achievement

Test (PIAT) at 5 years or older.

<P>

Simple correlations revealed statistically significant, but small, associations

between mothers&#146; reports of caregiver training when the children were

in infant/toddler care and the children&#146;s later performance. Children

whose mothers reported that their caregivers had more specialized training

obtained higher math and receptive language scores. When type of care was

controlled, these associations continued to be significant. Blau then asked

if these structural and caregiver factors uniquely predicted child performance

in a regression model that included 64 additional child care and family

variables. These controls included number of arrangements that were used,

hours per week in care, months per year in care, paid cash for care, cost

of care, center care, family day care home, relative care, child gender,

cognitive stimulation, emotional support, Hispanic ethnicity, black ethnicity,

grandmother worked when mother was 14, mother&#146;s education,

grandmother&#146;s education, fraction of mother&#146;s preschool years her

mother was present, fraction of mother&#146;s high school years her father

was present, month of pregnancy in which mother first received prenatal care,

child&#146;s birth order, Catholic, child received well-care visit in first

quarter, mother&#146;s age, mother&#146;s age at birth of child, siblings

in various age groups, and fraction of pregnancy during which mother worked.

In ordinary least squares regression analyses, relations between maternal

reports of caregiver training and children&#146;s math and receptive language

scores were no longer evident when these other variables were controlled.

From these analyses, Blau concluded:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

  &#147;There seems to be little association on average between child care

  inputs experienced during the first three years of life and subsequent child

  development, controlling for family background and the home environment.&#148;

  (p. 20)

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

Blau&#146;s conclusion does not appear warranted, for several reasons. First,

his analyses relied on maternal reports of structural and caregiver

characteristics. Questions can be raised about whether mothers can provide

this information accurately, especially retrospectively. Unfortunately, Blau

provides no evidence regarding the accuracy of these reports. In order to

estimate the accuracy of mothers&#146; concurrent reports of structural and

caregiver characteristics, we turned to the NICHD Study of Early Child Care

data set, which included both mothers&#146; and caregivers&#146; reports

of group size and child-adult ratio. These reports were compared to

observers&#146; independent counts of ratio and group size during 2-day visits.

The mean correlation between mothers&#146; and caregivers&#146; reports of

group size for children in centers was .55 (range = .51 to .63). The mean

correlation between maternal reports of child:adult ratio and observed ratios

was .33 (range = .27 to .42). These figures suggest that mother concurrent

reports can be viewed as moderately reliable. Maternal retrospective reports

of group size and ratio appear to be considerably less reliable. In other

studies, near-zero correlations were obtained between observational assessments

of group size and child-adult ratio when children were age 4 years (Vandell

and Powers, 1983) and maternal retrospective reports of these same structural

variables 4 years later (Vandell, Henderson, and Wilson, 1988).

<P>

To our knowledge, there are no data available from which the accuracy of

maternal reports of caregiver training can be evaluated. We suspect, based

on our own personal experiences, that mothers are less likely to know about

caregiver training than about group size and ratio, which they can observe.

Taken together, we believe that the lack of precision in the mothers&#146;

reports in the NLSY result in an underestimation of effects associated with

structural and caregiver characteristics.

<P>

Blau also adopted a stringent, perhaps unrealistic, test for long-term effects.

Child outcomes were assessed a minimum of 2 years after mothers reported

structural and caregiver characteristics, and the lag appears to have averaged

5 years or more because children were reported to be, on average, 8 years

of age when outcomes were assessed. Interestingly, there was some evidence

of longitudinal associations when shorter time lags were considered (even

though mothers&#146; reports were used). For example, significant relations

were found between maternal reports of child:adult ratios and caregiver training

during the first 3 years and behavioral adjustment and math scores for children

who were less than 9 years of age. Relations were not evident for very long

time period, i.e., children who were older than 9 years. Smaller group sizes

during the preschool period (3&#150;5 years) were associated with higher

scores on math, reading, and language performance. Lower child:staff ratios

were associated with fewer behavior problems. The long lag between the infant

quality reports and the child outcome assessments is further complicated

by the omission of quality reports during the older preschool years, resulting

in an underestimation of effects associated with child care quality.

<P>

<I>Conclusions</I>. Structural and caregiver characteristics have been found

to be associated with children&#146;s academic, cognitive, behavioral, and

social development. Smaller group sizes, lower child-caregiver ratios, and

more caregiver training and education appear to have positive effects on

these important developmental outcomes. Future work might address threshold

levels for these child care characteristics, or the point at which further

improvements in structural quality do not yield additional developmental

benefits for children.

<H3>

  An Economist&#146;s Interpretation of the Link between Child Care Quality

  and Child Outcomes

</H3>

<P>

The traditional approach of those working in the field of developmental

psychology is to use standardized regression coefficients in hierarchical

regression models. These seem quite different from the methods employed by

economists, but the full model used is a standard OLS regression model, and

the standardized coefficients can be converted into the nonnormalized

coefficients more traditional in the economics discipline. Doing so allows

us to address the question of the expected change in developmental outcomes

of children were quality to be improved based upon standard OLS estimates

(see Hanushek and Jackson, 1977).

<P>

Using estimates based on NICHD data, we perceive that the quality of child

care can indeed make a difference. <A HREF="tables4-13.htm#t7">Table 7</A>

reports on the cognitive and language results for the NICHD samples at ages

15 months, 24 months and 36 months (NICHD Early Child Care Research Network,

in press-b). Three outcome measures are used: for the younger two ages, the

Bayley, CDI vocabulary production, and CDI vocabulary comprehension tests

are used; for the oldest age group (36 months) the Bracken school readiness,

Reynell expressive language and Reynell verbal comprehension tests are used.

(See above for a more detailed discussion of these tests.) In addition to

the measures of child care quality, the model includes measures of parental

background, quality of the home, the child care setting, and time spent in

child care. These are an attempt to minimize the role of parental selection

of child care in order to capture the effects of child care quality differences

on measures of child development.

<P>

Two models are presented for each age group and outcome measure. The first

tests for the effects of the child care quality using a cumulative score

of positive caregiving rating, while the second adds a specific measure of

language stimulation. Caregivers&#146; behaviors were assessed during four

44-minute observations over two half-days at 6, 15, 24, and 36 months. These

were combined into the cumulative positive caregiving rating.

<P>

We converted the standardized coefficients reported in NICHD (in press-b),

into nonstandardized coefficients. <A HREF="tables4-13.htm#t7">Table 7</A>

only reports those for child care quality that are statistically significant

at the 5 percent level. Combining these with the measures of quality and

reinterpreting the standardized coefficients indicates the following effects.

<P>

The expected improvement in the CDI vocabulary production test for toddlers

aged 15 months, when their care quality shifts from one standard deviation

below the mean to one standard deviation above, is nearly 7 points, or 24

percent; if the shift is from the minimum score (5) to the maximum (20) in

caregiver rating, the estimated gain is 18 points. (Note that the standard

deviation is 2.9, within a range of 5&#150;20.) For the vocabulary comprehension

score, shifting from one standard deviation below the mean leads to an expected

increase of 8 points; and moving a child from the minimum score to the maximum

score in caregiver rating is expected to increase a child&#146;s score by

21.6 points, or 55 percent of the mean.

<P>

At age 24 months, statistically significant changes are registered for the

Bayley test and the sentence comprehension test. The Bayley estimates produce

an expected increase of about 5 points when the shift is from one standard

deviation below the mean to one above. The sentence comprehension results

produce an expected increase of 7 points. A shift from the lowest caregiver

to the highest increases expected performance on the vocabulary test by about

40 percent relative to the mean, but only about 13 percent in the case of

the Bayley test. (Note that for the 24 month olds the standard deviation

is 2.9 as well, and the range is the same as that for those 15 months old,

5&#150;20.) The expected changes are larger for those aged 36 months than

for those aged 24 months.

<P>

For the Bracken school readiness test at age 36 months, a shift from one

standard deviation below the mean on the caregiving rating to one above is

expected to lead to an increase of 6.9 points. (Note that the caregiver rating

has a larger range for those aged 36 months, 7&#150;28, while the standard

deviation is 3.3.) The same shift in caregiver quality is expected to lead

to a 5-point increase in the expressive language score and an 8.6 point increase

in the verbal comprehension score, relative to the mean. A shift from the

lowest rating to the highest for caregiver rating is expected to result in

a shift of about 50 percent relative to the mean for each of these three

outcomes. These estimates give us some sense of the magnitude of the possible

changes in children&#146;s outcomes as a result of improvements in positive

caregiver rating.

<P>

We can do a similar exercise with the second measure of quality, language

stimulation. This measure is added to the regression in an alternative

specification. In most cases the addition of this measure reduces the estimated

impact of positive caregiving. (Because language stimulation is a major component

of caregiving quality, this is not surprising.) We simulate the impact of

language stimulation only for ages 15 months and 24 months, where it is

statistically significant for all three of the child development outcome

measures.

<P>

For children 15 and 24 months of age, having a child care arrangement in

which more language stimulation is provided can play a small but significant

role in improving all three of the outcome measures. For children of 15 months,

simulating an improvement in caregiver language stimulation from one standard

deviation below the mean to one above increases performance on the Bayley

test by nearly four points, by 12 points on the CDI vocabulary production

test and by about 9 points on the CDI sentence comprehension test. At 24

months of age, a child exposed to a level of language stimulation one standard

deviation below the average is expected to gain about 5 points on the Bayley

test, or about 4 percent relative to the mean, were the child moved to an

arrangement with a rating one standard deviation above the norm, or by 61

units (about one third of the full range of 0&#150;180). The same child would

be expected to gain 12 points on the CDI sentence comprehension test, or

nearly 30 percent relative to the mean. And the same child would be expected

to gain about 9 points on the CDI vocabulary production test, or about 20

percent relative to the mean.

<P>

The NICHD group also estimated models with both concurrent and lagged quality

measures (NICHD, in press-b). Their results suggest that the cumulative impact

of child care quality may be far greater than the concurrent impact. In

<A HREF="tables4-13.htm#t8">Table 8</A> we provide two examples, one for

children at 24 months of age using caregiver quality measures at 15 and

15&#150;24 months, and one at 36 months of age using quality measures from

15&#150;24 months and 36 months. Only those quality measures which are

statistically significant at the 5 percent level are reported. Similar measures

for language stimulation are chosen as the cognitive outcome measure. Both

sets of results suggest that there is a lagged effect of language stimulation

and that the cumulative effect of exposure to higher levels of language

stimulation appears to be greater than the concurrent impact alone. In the

case of those aged 24 months, the converted results suggest that a child

who was in a child care arrangement over this entire period that was one

standard deviation below the mean (calculated at both 15 and 24 months) is

simulated to gain about 30 points on a CDI vocabulary production test if

moved to one above the mean. Looking at only the concurrent language stimulation,

an increase of 11 points, or about one-third of the full cumulative gain,

is simulated. In the case of 36 those aged months, we find that both language

stimulation and overall caregiver quality are significantly associated with

performance on the Reynell vocabulary comprehension test measured at 36 months,

and that only the lagged measure of language stimulation is statistically

significant among the two lagged measures of quality. Among these 36-month-olds,

we simulate a combined gain of 11 points on the Reynell vocabulary test if

the child moved from one standard deviation below the mean on both quality

measures to one above the mean over the entire period from 15 months to 36

months. This far exceeds the simulated increase if only the contemporary

measures were modified. The respective means of the outcome measures are

shown on the table.

<P>

The magnitudes of simulated change are large, but the resulting changes are

also rather large, suggesting that caregiver quality can significantly influence

these outcomes. All of these estimates are subject to the usual caveat that

the underlying estimates may not be causal. We should also note that the

measures of quality are based on limited observation, so that the effect

captured is likely to underestimate the true effect of quality.

<H3>

  Other Outcomes

</H3>

<P>

We now briefly review the findings from a small set of early childhood

intervention studies that look at such long-term outcomes as criminal activity,

earnings, and the use of cash welfare assistance. The Syracuse Family Development

Research Program was a small program that enrolled slightly more than 200

children and followed them for 5 years. It was one of the earlier programs,

beginning in 1969. The intervention included infant and preschool enrollment

in Syracuse University&#146;s preschool program as well as direct provision

of information on raising children, nutrition, etc. to the parents. The follow-up

analysis found that by age 15, 6 percent of the experimental group had been

referred to probation as compared to 22 percent of the controls. Through

based on very small numbers, the very large differences provide some evidence

that the combined interventions had a positive effect on the reduction of

crime (Lally, Mangione and Honig, 1988).

<P>

Perhaps the best-known early intervention project is the Carolina Abecedarian

Project (Campbell and Ramey, 1995; Ramey, Campbell, and Blair, 1998; Ramey

et al., in press). This clinical trial began at 6 weeks postpartum and included

(1) a randomized control group (n = 23) that received family support social

services, pediatric care, and child nutritional supplements, (2) an experimental

group (n = 25) that received the services of a high-quality center-based

intervention for the first 5 years and additional educational support services

from kindergarten to grade two, (3) an experimental group (n = 24) that received

only the early intervention, and (4) an experimental group (n = 24) that

received only the K-2 educational support. IQ scores at 8 years and 12 years

were significantly higher for preschool participants than for other children.

Furthermore, children who had participated in the preschool program had higher

scores on tests of reading and mathematics achievement at 8 and 12 years.

They were less likely to be retained a grade at ages 8, 12, and 15, and they

were also less likely to be placed in special education. The most recent

follow-up report from this research team (Early Learning, Later Success:

the Abecedarian Study, 1999) included findings to 21 years. Intervention

children were reported to be older, on average, when their first child was

born and to have been more likely to attend a four-year college.

<P>

The Perry Preschool Project (Schweinhart, Barnes, Weikart, et al., 1993)

involving 123 black children has reported long-term follow-up to 27 years.

The experimental group consisted of 45 children who entered the preschool

program at age 3 and an additional 13 who entered at age 4, attending a half-day

center-based program and receiving teacher home visits. The researchers report

that the experimental group had a somewhat lower probability of ever being

arrested by age 27 (57 versus 69 percent), but a larger difference in the

average number of lifetime arrests by age 27 (2.3 versus 4.6). Differences

in the proportion receiving public assistance by age 27 were also large:

15 compared to 32 percent. Mean earnings were far higher for the experimental

group than the control group at age 27: monthly reported mean earnings were

$1,219 for experimentals, $766 for controls.

<P>

Participation in the Chicago Child-Parent Centers (CPC) also has been related

to long-term beneficial effects (Reynolds et al., 2000). This project has

followed the educational and social development of 1,539 African-American

(93 percent) and Hispanic (7 percent) children as they grew up in high-poverty

neighborhoods in central city Chicago. Some of the children (n = 989)

participated in government-funded (Title I) early childhood programs in

1985-1986, whereas others did not (n = 550). A rich array of data, including

surveys from teachers, parents, school administrative records, standardized

tests, and the children themselves have been collected since that time. Children

who participated in the CPC preschool programs obtained significantly higher

math and reading achievement test scores at 5, 8, and 14 years, even after

controlling for family risk status, child gender, and later program

participation. At age 20, participants in the CPC were more likely to have

completed high school and to have low rates of juvenile crime.

<P>

Even though only a few studies have followed children into adulthood, it

is notable that all find some evidence of long-term gains.

<H3>

  <A NAME="maternal-employment">Does Child Care Quality Affect Maternal

  Employment?</A>

</H3>

<P>

In much of the existing literature linking parental employment and child

care, the primary issue is the affordability of care and the elasticity of

response to child care costs. In this sense one can see the potential for

a trade-off between quality of care and labor force participation, in that

higher-quality care is likely to be more costly. A parent facing that higher

cost may decide to forgo or limit employment or to elect lower-quality and

less costly care (Scarr, 1998). Maume (1991) found that a $10 increase in

the weekly cost of child care was associated with a 1.6 percent increase

in the probability of exiting employment within a year. A slightly earlier

study by Blau and Philip (1989) also provided evidence that an increase in

the cost of care was associated with an increased probability of a mother

leaving the labor force.

<P>

Quality of care may influence employment in several ways: parents may be

reluctant to leave their child in a low-quality, unsafe environment or with

adults who do not provide a stimulating or warm environment for their child.

This may be a particular problem for lower-income families, who have more

limited choices of providers. In contrast, a safe, warm, stimulating environment

may encourage employment and longer hours of work. Parents may also be more

effective employees if they do not have concerns about the environment in

which their children spend a good part of each working day. Having well-cared-for

children may also lead to employees with higher productivity than those whose

children are left in less satisfactory environments. Parents may also be

more likely to be on time to work and less likely to miss time from work

if their children are cared for in a safe, warm and stimulating environment.

<P>

<I>Evidence</I>. There is limited evidence on whether higher-quality care

has positive impacts on parental employment, because there have been few

studies. The available evidence suggests that among low-income women,

higher-quality child care may increase employment, stability of employment,

and hours of work. See <A HREF="tables4-13.htm#t8">Table 8</A> for detail

on these studies.

<P>

Meyers (1993) has explored how a mother&#146;s perception of the quality

of her child&#146;s care and the convenience of the child care arrangement

affected her labor market progress in the JOBS program. The results show

that a mother&#146;s perception of the safety of her child&#146;s care

arrangement and the trustworthiness of the provider were significant predictors

of the mother&#146;s continued participation in the JOBS program and in labor

force participation more generally. Mothers also responded to the ratio of

children to staff: those mothers who reported that the ratio of the children

to adults in their care arrangement exceeded professionally recommended standards

were more than twice as likely to drop out of the program than mothers who

reported that their child&#146;s care arrangement met the standard.

<P>

Additional evidence that quality plays a role in women&#146;s labor force

participation comes from another experiment: the Teenage Parent Demonstration.

As reported in Ross and Paulsell (1998), among the group of first-time teenage

welfare recipients whose members were randomly assigned to the program, which

required employment, job training or schooling, nearly a third reported that

the quality of child care was a problem that led them to stop working or

to change hours and/or activities. Ross and Paulsell interpret this to mean

that &#147;Mothers who are required to work as a condition of receiving welfare

benefits may try to manage with lower-quality child care than they would

in the absence of such a requirement, but this low-quality care may be the

reasons that mothers interrupt their employment activities.&#148; (p. 40)

<P>

Brooks-Gunn et al. (1994) evaluated an early intervention program, the Infant

Health and Development Program, in terms of its impact on mothers&#146;

employment. This experiment focused on low-birthweight infants and used random

assignment to an intervention program that provided center-based child care

when the child was 2 to 3 years of age. The authors report that mothers in

the intervention group were significantly more likely to be working than

women in the control group. Effects were particularly pronounced for mothers

with a high school degree or less schooling. Similar beneficial effects of

high- quality child care on mothers&#146; subsequent educational achievement

were evident in the high-risk sample that participated in the Abecedarian

clinical trials (Ramey et al., in press). Benasich, Brooks-Gunn, and Clewell

(1992) report qualitatively similar results for several other early intervention

programs (pp. 41&#150;42).

<P>

Other evidence (see Hofferth, 1999) that child care quality can influence

labor market participation can be found in research studies that differentiate

formal arrangements from informal arrangements. These analyses show that

parents miss work more often and are late more often if they use informal

arrangements. The big difference seems to be the stability of the

arrangement&#151;an element of quality.

  <A NAME="quality">WHAT IS THE QUALITY OF CARE IN THE UNITED STATES? </A>

</H2>

<P>

The evidence reviewed above indicates that child care quality has meaningful

effects on children and their parents. Our next question considers the quality

of the care that is available in the United States. One part of this question

is a determination of whether high-quality care (of the sort that fosters

positive developmental outcomes) is the norm or the exception. The flip side

of this question is a determination of the likelihood that children are in

poor-quality care that can impair development. Unfortunately, at the current

time it is not possible to provide a definitive response to these questions,

because observations of process quality have not been conducted for a nationally

representative sample of children. In the absence of such a report, we must

reply on existing data from multisite studies that provide suggestions about

the distribution of quality of care in the United States.

<P>

The Cost, Quality, and Outcomes Study (Helburn et al., 1995) provides a

perspective on center-based care. ECERS assessments were conducted in 398

centers located in four states that varied in economic health and child care

regulations. In that study, 12 percent of the centers received ECERS scores

lower than 3, indicating care that was less than minimal quality, and 15

percent received ECERS scores higher than 5, indicating good-quality care.

The remainder of the centers were evenly divided between those receiving

scores in the 3s (37 percent) and scores in the 4s (37 percent). This

distribution of quality scores in the observed settings, however, may be

an optimistic view. The observed centers represented only 52 percent of the

eligible centers; the remainder declined to participate. It seems likely

that the nonobserved settings offered care that was lower in quality.

<P>

The Relative and Family Day Care Study (Kontos, Howes, Shinn, and Galinsky,

1995) provides a perspective on quality of care in homes. FDCRS scores were

obtained in 226 child care homes and relative care settings in three communities.

Minority race, low-income, and nonregulated home settings were over sampled

so that the investigators could study the effects of these factors on observed

quality. In that study, 34 percent of the child care homes received FDCRS

scores of less than 3 and were described as &#147;inadequate,&#148; 58 percent

were &#147;adequate/custodial,&#148; and 8 percent were &#147;good.&#148;

These unadjusted quality estimates are probably negatively biased, because

two of the three states (Texas and North Carolina) have less stringent

regulations for child care homes than other states and because nonregulated

and low-income settings were over sampled.

<P>

Perhaps the best available estimate of process quality for children 3 years

or younger is provided by the NICHD Study of Early Child Care. Observations

were conducted in nine states (Arkansas, California, Kansas, Massachusetts,

North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin) and included

urban, suburban, and rural communities. The distribution of child care

regulations in those states paralleled those in the United States. Observations

were conducted in all types of nonmaternal care settings, including grandparents,

in-home caregivers, child care homes, and centers. A total of 612 child care

settings were assessed at 15 months, 630 child care settings at 24 months,

and 674 child care settings at 36 months.

<P>

The study sample of 1,364 families was drawn from hospitals at the 10 research

sites and included ethnic minorities (24 percent), mothers without a high

school education (10 percent), and single-parent households (14 percent)

as well as white, middle-class and two-parent households. At 15 months, 17

percent of the households had incomes below established poverty levels

(income-to-needs ratio &lt; 1.0). An additional 18 percent of the sample

had incomes near poverty (income to needs ratio 1.0 &#150;1.99) (NICHD Early

Child Care Research Network, 1997). The sampling plan yielded a large and

diverse sample, but it is not nationally representative. The sampling plan

also did not include adolescent mothers (3.8 percent of the potential families

in the hospitals), mothers who did not speak English (4.4 percent), and infants

of multiple births, with obvious disabilities, or extended hospital stays

postpartum (7.7 percent of the births).

<P>

Results from the NICHD Study of Early Child Care observations (NICHD Early

Child Care Research Network, in press-a) are summarized in

<A HREF="tables4-13.htm#t9">Table 9</A>. ORCE ratings less than 2 indicate

poor-quality care. Scores of 2 to less than 3 indicate fair-quality care.

Scores equal to 3 but less than 3.5 indicate good-quality care, and scores

of 3.5 or higher indicate excellent-quality care. Care was most often judged

to be only fair in quality. Relatively little care was observed at the extremes,

with 6 percent of the settings offering poor quality care and 11 percent

of the settings offering excellent care. Poor-quality care was more likely

in centers serving infants and toddlers than in centers serving older children

(10 percent versus 4 percent).

<P>

An extrapolation to the quality of care in the United States was derived

by applying NICHD observational parameters, stratified by maternal education,

child age, and care type to the distribution of American families documented

in the National Household Education Survey

(1998).<SUP><A HREF="#2">(2)</A></SUP>&nbsp; This stratification was needed

because the NICHD investigators determined that variations in process quality

were associated with these three factors. Based on the numbers of children

of particular ages using specific different types of care, positive caregiving

was estimated to be of poor quality for 8 percent of children under 3 years

in the United States, fair quality for 53 percent, good quality for 30 percent,

and excellent quality for 9 percent. These distributions suggested to the

investigators that care is &#147;neither outstanding nor terrible, but plenty

of room for improvement [remains].&#148;

<P>

The quality of child care in the United States also can be estimated based

on reports of structural and caregiver characteristics. Drawing on empirical

research and advice from professionals in the field, organizations such as

the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Public Health Association

(1992) have established age-based guidelines for group size and child:adult

ratio. For example, the recommendations for child:adult ratios are 3:1 for

children from birth to 24 months, 4:1 for children from 25 to 30 months,

5:1 for children from 31 to 35 months, 7:1 for 3-year-olds, and 8:1 for

4-year-olds.

<P>

<A HREF="tables4-13.htm#t10">Table 10</A> lists regulations for child:adult

ratio and group size for each of the 50 states as compiled by the Center

for Career Development in Early Care and Education (1999). It is clear that

very few states have regulations as strict as those recommended by professional

organizations. For example, only three states have the recommended 3:1 ratio

for infants, and only one state has the recommended 3:1 ratios for 18-month-olds.

Two states have ratios consistent with the recommended 5:1 ratio for 3-year-olds.

Some states are at substantial odds with the recommended standards. For example,

eight states have child:adult ratios of 6:1 for infants. There is a similar

failure to meet recommended group size standards, with 20 states having no

regulations pertaining to group size.

<P>

Another way of estimating the quality of care in the United States is to

consider reports of structural and caregiver characteristics. One nationally

representative survey, the Profile of Child Care Settings (Kisker, Hofferth,

Phillips, and Farquhar, 1991), obtained this information in 1990 from child

care centers, early education programs, and licensed child care homes. According

to the Profile, the average child:adult ratio was 4:1 for infants under 1

year of age, 6:1 for 1-year-olds, and 10:1 for preschoolers. This report

indicates that the average center and child care home in 1990 did not meet

standards for child:adult ratios that have been linked to higher quality.

In contrast, the Profile of Child Care Settings found that caregivers tended

to be well educated and to have specialized training pertaining to children.

Nearly half of all teachers reported that they had completed college (47

percent) and an additional 13 percent reported a two-year degree. Most of

the remaining teachers had a Child Development Associate (CDA) (3)credential

(12 percent) or some college experience (15 percent). Only 14 percent did

not have any education beyond high school. Ninety percent of the teachers

in child care centers reported that they had received at least 10 hours of

in-service training.

<P>

The Profile survey found that regulated child care home providers had less

formal education and training than teachers in centers. Approximately 11

percent of regulated home providers reported that they had completed college;

34 percent had no schooling beyond high school. About two-thirds had received

specialized in-service training. This study represents the best available

information regarding structural and caregiver characteristics from nationally

representative samples. The survey is dated, however, in that the data were

collected in 1990, so the reports may not reflect current structural and

caregiver characteristics.

<P>

Published reports from two additional national surveys are less useful for

this issue. The National Child Care Survey,1990, and the National Household

Education Survey, 1995, collected information from parents regarding child:adult

ratios and caregiver training. The published reports from these surveys (Hofferth

et al., 1991; Hofferth et al., 1998), however, did not present ratio and

group size information separately by children&#146;s age. As a result, it

is not possible to use the reports to evaluate the percentage of child care

settings that meet (or fail to meet) standards for infants, toddlers, and

preschoolers that are set differently. A second limitation of these reports

is that parents may not be accurate respondents of these quality parameters.

<P>

A third source of evidence pertaining to structural and caregiver characteristics

is the NICHD Study of Early Child Care (NICHD Early Child Care Research Network,

1999a). In that study, child:adult ratios were observed at regular intervals

and caregivers reported their educational background and specialized training.

The percentage of center classrooms that met the AAP and APHA recommendations

for child:adult ratio and group size is shown on

<A HREF="tables4-13.htm#t12">Table 12</A>. Also shown are the percentage

of classrooms in which caregivers had at least some college and specialized

training. As indicated, 36 percent of the infant classrooms were observed

to have the recommended child:adult ratios of 3:1. Fifty-six percent of

caregivers in infant classrooms had received specialized training during

the preceding year; 65 percent of infant caregivers had some college courses.

Proportions were similar for toddler care (the 15- and 24-month-olds). When

compared to figures reported in the Profile of Child Care Settings, the NICHD

figures suggest that there has been some decline in the educational background

and training of child care staff during the 1990s.

<P>

The decrease in caregiver education and training may be related to the generally

low wages in the child care field (see <A HREF="#fig3">Figure 3</A>).

<P>

<A NAME="fig3"><IMG SRC="fig3.gif" WIDTH="640" HEIGHT="440" ALT="Figure 3. Median Earnings of Highest and Lowest Paid Teachers or Assistants Relative to Full-Time Wages of Women 25+; 1992, 1997."

    BORDER="0"></A>

<P>

In 1997, child care teachers averaged $7.50&#150;$10.85 per hour, or

$13,125&#150;$18,988 per year, when they were employed for a 35-hour week

and a 50-week year. Wages for assistant teachers were $6.00 to $7.00 an hour

(or $10,500&#150;$12,250 per year). <A HREF="#fig1">Figure 1</A> shows salaries

for lower-paid and higher-paid child care workers relative to the median

salaries of women 25+ by level of education for both 1992 and 1997. The figure

shows the low salaries of child care workers relative to other occupations

and indicates that there has not been any improvement in terms of the relative

salaries over the 1992&#150;1997 time period for most levels of education.

While high school graduates who were child care teachers or assistants could

only earn between 73 and 85 percent of the salaries they might expect to

receive elsewhere, the relative salaries were far lower relative to the median

for women with more schooling. A child care teacher with a B.A. degree could

expect to earn between 52 and 75 percent of the median salaries across all

occupations. Current child care salaries are not consistent with attracting

and keeping providers who have the level of education and training that research

suggests is needed to structure emotionally supportive and cognitively

stimulating learning environments.

<P>

The generally low salaries earned by child care staff also appear to be a

factor contributing to high staff turnover in the child care field (see

<A HREF="#fig4">Figure 4</A>).

<P>

<A NAME="fig4"><IMG SRC="fig4.gif" WIDTH="618" HEIGHT="433" ALT="Figure 4. Staff Turnover by Prior Year's Wages."

In 1997, 27 percent of teachers and 39 percent of assistants left their jobs

  <A NAME="econ">IS THERE A PERSUASIVE ECONOMIC ARGUMENT TO JUSTIFY PUBLIC

  INTERVENTION TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF CHILD CARE? </A>

</H2>

<P>

Market failure is defined as a &#147;a situation in which a market left on

its own fails to allocate resources efficiently&#148; (Mankiw, 1998, p. 10).

Wherever market failure exists, public sector intervention may improve the

performance of that sector of the economy. In the child care sector, market

failure stems from two sources: lack of information and the existence of

externalities (effects beyond the primary consumers). Regarding the first,

a major problem is the absence of information on the part of parents, including

information on the quality of child care, sometimes on the availability of

care, and often on the net costs of alternative arrangements. Related to

this lack of information is the difficulty in capturing process quality by

measuring observable differences in structural quality. Even information

on the structural quality differences is not easily obtained a priori, and

the cost of acquiring information can be high.

<P>

One difficulty in providing information to parents is that much of this market

is made up of small providers. Parents may know something about the child

care used by their neighbors, but very little about other types or providers

of care. Parents report being unsure about how to go about evaluating child

care quality. Child care convenience also is of considerable concern to parents

limiting their search to care in particular small geographical areas. This

way of thinking about market failure is quite similar to that of medical

providers. The problem may be particularly acute for lower-income families

and for families who need care for evening or weekend employment (Vandell,

1998).

<P>

The second major cause of market failure is the existence of externalities.

The benefits of quality care accrue not just to the parent(s) but also to

the child and to society more generally. Parents may take all or part of

the benefit to their child into account, but not benefits that are external

to the family. Such benefits include lower costs for subsequent schooling

(reduced probability of grade retention and special education, for example),

future reductions in crime, increased productivity that results in higher

productivity for others, payment of higher taxes, and possibly lower costs

for social services. Improving child care quality may affect grade school

classrooms by increasing the proportion of children in the class who have

strong language and cognitive skills. By the same token, poor-quality child

care may undermine grade school classrooms by increasing the numbers of children

with academic and social deficits. Unsafe and unhealthy child care may result

in reduced productivity for others, when parents are absent from their jobs,

caring for injured or ill children. Adding these benefits to the parent&#146;s

demand for higher-quality care should shift the demand curve for quality

care to the right (that is, increase demand for higher-quality care at every

price).

<P>

There may also be a third cause of market failure, an imperfect capital market.

Parents of young children tend to have low incomes relative to their permanent

income, but may face borrowing constraints that reduce their ability to pay

for high-quality care.

<P>

Justification for government intervention may also be based on distributional

or equality-of-opportunity goals. This may be especially relevant today,

in view of the requirement that most low-income single parents work. The

core argument here is that if high-quality child care can provide gains in

cognitive ability, school readiness, and social behavior, children in low-income

families should be given an opportunity to benefit from such experiences

just as high-income children benefit. Parents with limited earnings do not

have the private means to purchase high-quality child care for their children.

Government subsidies are necessary if equal opportunity for high-quality

care is to be afforded children in low-income families. The other side of

this argument is that if subsidies are not provided, parents with limited

incomes will use poor-quality care, including multiple arrangements, which

may be detrimental to the safety of their children, may increase family stress,

and may result in children with reduced opportunities. A subsidy (or direct

provision of care) for children in low-income families could also complement

the Earned Income Tax Credit and serve as an employment-related income subsidy

(see Council of Economic Advisers, 1997).

<P>

There are additional issues regarding availability of child care for families

with very low incomes and/or unusual and nonflexible hours of work. According

to several studies:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

  &#147;The structure of low-wage work and its lack of fit with the structure

  of more formal child care options restricts the access of low-income families

  to child care centers and many family day care homes. Data from the National

  Child Care Survey indicate that one-third of working-poor mothers (incomes

  below poverty) and more than one-fourth of working-class mothers (incomes

  above poverty but below $25,000) worked weekends&#148; (Hofferth, 1995).

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

Yet only 10 percent of centers and 6 percent of family day care homes reported

providing weekend care. Almost half of working-poor parents worked on a rotating

or changing schedule, further restricting these families&#146; child care

options to more flexible arrangements made with relatives, friends, and

neighbors.

<P>

The features of low-wage work appear to promote reliance on multiple providers

as a way of patching together child care to cover parents&#146; nonstandard

and shifting work hours (Siegel and Loman, 1991). Meyers added that irregular

and unpredictable work schedules led to disruptions in child care for the

families in her study of the California GAIN program (Meyers, 1993). Deborah

Phillips wrote (1995)

<BLOCKQUOTE>

  &#147;In sum, when selecting child care, many working-poor and low-income

  families must choose from a seriously constrained set of options. They face

  a set of obstacles that derive primarily from the structure of low-wage jobs

  and from the meager incomes that these jobs provide. Their low incomes enable

  them to afford only free care by relatives and friends or very inexpensive

  care; their nonstandard and often rotating work hours restrict them to

  arrangements with flexible and weekend or evening hours of operation. These

  factors may also lead to greater reliance on multiple providers and expose

  young children to shifting child care arrangements.&#148;

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

This lack of stability and frequent changing is itself a measure of poor

quality of care.<A HREF="#3"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A>

<P>

The market failure components argue for government intervention in improving

child care. They all lead the authors of this report to believe that the

demand for high-quality care is too low. And because demand is too low,

compensation is too low, resulting in better-trained providers tending to

seek employment in other spheres. This results in a decline in quality unless

intervention occurs. Intervention can take many forms.

<P>

The arguments behind the need for a role for government (including subsidies

for child care) is quite similar to those for primary schooling. Traditionally,

the amount of schooling provided has heavily depended on the public sector.

For children up to the age of 16, or older in some states, schooling is

mandatory, and is provided by the public sector. In the cases of elementary

and secondary education, public colleges and universities, the price charged

tends to be far below the marginal cost of schooling. Evaluation of the

appropriate level of public investment in education requires an analysis

of all returns to schooling, including nonmarket and external effects. For

example, greater education may lead to social cohesion and may enable one

to use new technologies; it may reduce the probability of criminal acts,

reduce the probability of application and receipt of transfers, and it may

increase savings rates. (For more on this see Wolfe and Zuvekas, 1997 and

Michael, 1982.)

<P>

Many of the benefits of child care are like those of primary schooling, because

child care is early childhood education. These early childhood educational

experiences affect children&#146;s readiness for primary schooling in the

same way that primary schooling affects children&#146;s readiness for secondary

schooling. In both cases many benefits are external to the child and family.

The community at large would benefit from the cognitive, language, and behavioral

competencies that are associated with higher-quality child care. The argument

for equality of opportunity is similar as well.

<P>

A high-quality child care system also is needed if welfare reform is to succeed.

The recent change in welfare policy, establishing work requirements, means

that more parents, particularly single parents, are working, because work

is their only potential source of income. Requiring work means that more

parents must find child care for their children. Given this increase in demand,

the issue of child care quality becomes even more important. Unfortunately,

as described in earlier sections, much of the child care in the United States

is not of high quality. Over 60 percent of children under the age of 3 are

receiving care in which positive caregiving is not characteristic. Only 10

percent are in care settings that are described as excellent.

A wide variety of approaches might be used to improve child care.

the various links between interventions and quality, taking into account

<P>

Most of the interventions would be included in the elements of the left column.

These include the provision of information, licensing requirements, placement

activities, subsidies to compensate child care workers, training programs

for providers, tuition subsidies for students who enroll in early childhood

education, increased tax credits to cover the cost of care for lower- to

middle-income families, incentive payments to individual teachers and assistants

who remain in the same center for a minimum of 3&#150;4 years, and even direct

provision of care. In the longer run, we need research to help better identify

those factors that best improve the quality of child care. In essence, we

need better understanding of the production of high-quality care, which may

differ for children of different backgrounds.

<P>

The minimum roles for the public sector are as providers of information on

available slots, hours of operation, structural quality features, costs of

care and education, and training of personnel. The government might also

establish a certification program to certify providers who met certain

requirements. Minimum standards need to be strengthened in many states.

Incentives might be offered to providers who meet certain requirements. Other

government activities to increase the availability of high-quality care include

operation of training programs and covering the cost of instructors and

facilities for these programs. Information on the successful completion of

such programs could be disseminated by the public sector as part of its

information activities.

<P>

A more ambitious role designed to increase the pool of well-qualified individuals

who enter (and remain) in the field of early childhood education would be

some form of tuition subsidy for those willing to major in this field. There

is a long tradition of such programs when shortages are feared; examples

include nursing education and medical school. An alternative might be a college

loan forgiveness program based on years spent as a child care provider following

college, or Associate degree completion. Another approach to increasing the

pool of qualified providers is to raise salaries. This seems especially important

given the relatively low salaries in child care compared to other occupations

(see <A HREF="#fig1">Figure 1</A> and the discussion of the

<A HREF="#fig7">figure</A> above). Such increases might result from increased

information to parents, tax credits to parents, and the expansion of subsidy

programs or direct payment to providers by the public sector. An innovative

program might reward the stability of providers by paying a bonus after some

specified period of years.

<P>

Current programs to improve child care quality exist and might be replicated

or expanded. For example, a broad-based community initiative in North Carolina

(Smart Start) has been successful in improving child care quality (Bryant,

Maxwell, and Burchinal, 1999). This initiative, established by the governor

of North Carolina in 1993, is a partnership between state government, local

communities, service providers, and families. Twelve county partnerships

were initially selected based on competitive review to receive funds for

new and improved child care services. Data to evaluate the effectiveness

of the initiative were obtained in 1994 and 1996 from over 180 child care

centers in 12 counties. Local quality improvement activities (in 1996) were

distributed as follows: training workshops (83 percent), funds to attend

training activities (53 percent), on-site consultation or technical assistance

(58 percent), higher child care subsidy rates (35 percent), increased subsidies

for meeting higher standards (29 percent), funds to improve quality by purchasing

new equipment (70 percent), funds to improve quality by purchasing new

educational materials (63 percent), funds to achieve higher licensing level

(26 percent), funds to achieve national accreditation (13 percent), funds

to improve services for children with disabilities (11 percent), teacher

substitute pool (20 percent), transportation services (18 percent), lending

library (51 percent), and provider compensation programs (35 percent). The

mean number of improvement activities per center was 5.3 in 1994 and 5.8

in 1996, with a range of 0 to 14 activities each year. In both years, ECERS

scores were significantly related to the number of local quality improvement

activities in which individual centers participated. In addition, process

quality was significantly higher in 1996 than in 1994. Only 14 percent of

centers were rated as good quality in 1994. In 1996, this figure was 25 percent.

Participation in the Smart Start initiative also was related to a significant

increase in the percentage of centers that obtained the higher-level Associate

of Arts licensure credential.

<P>

Other efforts to improve quality might be to mandate certain minimum

requirements. These can take the form of reducing child:adult ratios, reducing

group sizes, establishing and enforcing safety regulations, and education

and training. An example of such regulations is a model standard that applies

to small family home caregivers. The National Health and Safety Performance

Standard (American Public Health Association and American Academy of Pediatrics,

1992) states that one small family caregiver who does not have an assistant

&#147;shall not care for more than six children, including no more than two

children under age 2. These numbers include the caregiver&#146;s own children

under the age of six. If any child under age 3 is in care, there shall be

no more than four children, including the caregiver&#146;s own children under

the age of six. If only children under age 2 are in care, there shall be

no more than three children, including those of the caregiver&#148; (Chapter

1, Staffing).

<P>

We also have training programs for providers of child care. The Department

of Labor, Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training, West Virginia Child Care

Development Specialist Registered Apprenticeship Program offers child care

apprentices 4,000 hours of supervised on-the-job training and 300 hours of

classroom instruction. The child care providers earn their salaries while

they are in the program and receive incremental wage increases as their skill,

ability, and knowledge increase. The DOL reports that employers report almost

no turnover among child care providers and that providers remain highly satisfied

with their careers

(<A HREF="http://www.dol.gov/dol/wb/public/childcare/child3.pdf">www.dol.gov/dol/wb/public/childcare/child3.pdf</A>).

<P>

Private employers may sometimes directly or indirectly provide resource and

referral services. Some employers contract with private agencies to assist

employees in learning about the range of child care options. The government

could encourage such activities by providing subsidies or tax credits to

firms if they provide such assistance. An example of this is the program

at the Virginia Mason Medical Center which offers child/family resource and

referral services.

<P>

Recent reports suggest that although some federal funds are available to

improve access to higher-quality care among lower-income families, some states

have not made these funds available or have set up programs that result in

low take-up rates. According to &#147;Access to Child Care for Low-Income

Working Families&#148; released in October 1999, 1.5 million children of

14.7 million (about 10 percent) in low-income households were receiving child

care subsidies. The major source of funds is the Child Care and Development

Fund (CCDF), a federal program that provides funds to states to subsidize

child care. According to federal law, children living in families with incomes

up to 85 percent of median income in the state could be eligible, but states

have set lower limits (http://www.acf.dhhs.gov/news/ccreport.htm). The levels

set and the take-up rates differ across states. The report details coverage

in each state and take-up rates. Expanding eligibility to the federal maximum

level and/or encouraging take-up of the existing subsidies through outreach

are ways to increase the demand for high-quality care.

<P>

Data aggregated from state agencies indicate that the child care arrangement

most frequently chosen by parents receiving direct federal subsidies is

center-based care (Phillips, 1995), see <A HREF="#fig8">Figure 8</A>.

<P>

<IMG SRC="fig8.gif" WIDTH="596" HEIGHT="409" ALT="Figure 8. Children Served, by Federal Program and Type of Provider."

    BORDER="0">

<P>

This evidence indicates that families do respond to available subsidies.

The profile of arrangements used by these low-income parents is strikingly

different from that used by all low-income families. Siegel and Loman (1991)

found, as well, that AFDC families in Illinois showed different distributions

of child care use based on whether they received a child care subsidy and

which subsidy they received. Families receiving a child care benefit that

reimbursed them for their child care costs 30 to 60 days after they had incurred

these costs were discouraged from using child care options they could not

afford with their disposable income. Their patterns of use were similar to

those of unsubsidized, low-income families. In contrast, families who received

subsidies through programs that either subsidized providers directly or enabled

the families to pay providers when fees were due showed substantially higher

rates of reliance on center-based and formal family day care arrangements.

<P>

Subsidies can help low-income families gain access to the same range of quality

options that are available to higher-income families. The Urban Institute&#146;s

survey of resource and referral agencies in six communities provides evidence

that the quality of care received by subsidized children was as high as that

for higher income, fee-paying children, as perceived by resource and referral

staff (Phillips, 1995).

<P>

Another approach that could be combined with subsidies for very young children

would be to provide universal coverage for child care (or coverage for children

whose parents worked more than 20 hours per week) for pre-school-age children.

Such a program could expand existing prekindergarten programs to a full day

and include after-school care. These programs could be established for 3-

and 4-year-olds through a combination of direct provision through a local

school district, existing community-based programs, and vouchers that would

be accepted by certified providers. Part of the costs of this care would

be offset by eliminating tax credits and current government subsidies for

3- and 4-year-olds. States and local communities would decide on the details

of the provision of care, and financing would be shared across levels of

government. Part of a coordinated, high-quality child care system for toddlers

also might include community- and school-based centers and family day care

networks. Because of the necessary low child:adult ratios (and their attendant

expense), part of a coordinated child care policy for infants might include

vouchers that would allow a parent to stay home and care for the infant during

the first year.

<H3>

  Assessment of the Cost of Improving Quality

</H3>

<P>

As we suggested, analyses that shed light on the developmental benefits of

child care characteristics for children is an important element of the answer

to our question. A related task involves determining the levels of investment

necessary to achieve improved quality. Although this topic has not received

the same level of attention in the literature as the overall relationship

between quality of care and child outcomes, several studies consider the

financial costs of increasing structural measures of quality. Though subject

to limitations that affect the extent to which one may apply these findings

to the current system of child care, this research provides useful information

on the relationship between the quality of child care and cost.

<P>

The U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO, 1990) report and Powell and

Cosgrove&#146;s (1992) summary of and addendum to this GAO research include

estimated cost functions for the provision of child care as well as a model

of the factors that affect wages of care providers. The modeled cost function

allows the authors to examine the direct influences of input prices; center

characteristics, including structural measures of quality; and geographical

location on center total variable cost. This use of multiple regression analysis

allows the authors to estimate the effect of changing such factors as the

child-adult ratio on center total costs, after controlling for other relevant

factors such as group size, location, and average education of providers.

By also modeling the elements of wage determination, the authors capture

the indirect effect of changes in child care characteristics on the wages

of providers. The results from both models are then combined to examine direct

and indirect effects of quality changes on total variable costs.

<P>

Data on child care centers from a 1989 GAO survey of 265 early childhood

education centers accredited by the National Associate for the Education

of Young Children (NAEYC) were used in both

studies.<SUP><A HREF="#4">(4)</A></SUP>&nbsp; The survey, administered to

program directors via questionnaire, included questions of center

characteristics, costs, value of in-kind donations received, staff

characteristics and compensation. The survey includes several structural

measures that allow the authors to estimate the costs associated with changing

the following quality measures: the average number of children per teaching

staff member; average number of children in groups of four-year-olds; average

education of staff in years; average experience of staff in years; and the

staff turnover rate.<SUP><A HREF="#5">(5)</A></SUP>

<P>

The authors find statistically significant relationships between center total

cost and structural measures of child care quality. For the adult-child ratio,

they find that an improvement in the quality of care achieved by decreasing

the average ratio by one, for example from 11:1 to 10:1, is associated with

increased costs of roughly 4.5 percent. The authors note that the average

center in their data, one with 50 children and an annual per child cost of

$6,500, which reduces the child-to-staff ratio from 11:1 to 10:1, faces an

increase in annual cost per child of

$306.<A HREF="#6"><SUP>(6)</SUP></A>&nbsp; A related measure, average group

size, had a small but statistically insignificant effect on total costs.

<P>

Changes in cost resulting from improving staff education and experience are

estimated using the estimated cost and wage functions to capture total direct

and indirect effects. The authors find that a one-year increase in average

education of the teaching staff is statistically significantly associated

with a 3.4 percent increase in total costs, which includes a 5.8 percent

increase in wages. Similarly, increasing average teacher experience by one

year is significantly associated with a reduction in center total costs of

0.6 percent, including an estimated increase in wages of 2.3 percent. This

implies that increasing staff experience is associated with an increase in

quality as well as a slight reduction in average center total costs. There

is also evidence of a relationship between turnover rates and total

costs&#151;the departure of an additional 10 percent of the center&#146;s

teaching staff increases costs by 6.8 percent.

<P>

These studies have several limitations. First, they rely on data that are

more than ten years old. If the relationships estimated in their model have

changed since 1989, these estimates will differ from what we would expect

to find using current data. Changes in quality made now may affect total

costs in a different manner.

<P>

Also, the data include only accredited centers. If these centers have cost

functions that systematically differ from unaccredited centers, the estimated

results will not apply to those centers. If, for example, one is most concerned

with improving poor quality child care, and such care is more likely to be

found in unaccredited centers, these estimates may not provide an accurate

depiction of the costs of doing so. The sample also only includes data for

care of 4- and 5-year-old children. Because of differences in providing care

for other age groups, the relationship between improving quality and costs

for centers that provide care for other age groups may

vary.<A HREF="#8"><SUP>(7)</SUP></A>&nbsp; Finally although the sample includes

data from many states, 70 percent of the centers surveyed were in the South

and the Midwest. The results therefore may not be nationally representative.

<P>

Helburn (1995) estimates a similar cost function using data collected as

a part of the Cost, Quality, and Child Outcomes in Care Centers (CQO) study.

The CQO study, conducted in 1993&#150;1994, included data from 401 child

care centers (749 classrooms) in four states. The data, collected through

classroom observation and interviews with program directors, include information

on center characteristics, program quality and staff qualifications,

compensation, and turnover. Helburn estimates center total costs as a function

of staff wages at different education levels, hours of child care provided,

physical size of the center, volunteer hours, region of the country, for-profit

status, and quality measures.<A HREF="#9"><SUP>(8)</SUP></A>

<P>

This research also indicates statistically significant relationships between

cost and quality. Increasing center quality by 25 percent (from mediocre

to good) is associated with increases in total variable costs of approximately

10 percent, or $346 per child per year. The authors define quality using

an index similar to the ECERS measure of quality of care. Using the ECERS

7-point scale, the mean value of this index in their sample is 4.0, which

ranks between fair and good. They estimate that the increase in total variable

costs associated with increasing the measure of quality by 25 percent to

5.0, a rating of good quality, will be approximately 10 percent. Given an

average size of 60 children per center, the increase in quality is expected

to result in an increase in costs of approximately $20,700 per

year.<A HREF="#9"><SUP>(9)</SUP></A>

<P>

Helburn notes that this analysis assumes that wages are held constant during

the quality-changing process. The model specifically implies that wages for

particular quality-levels of staff (here measured by years of education)

are set in the labor market and centers pay the going wage. If, however,

high-quality centers pay higher than market wages to attract the most qualified

providers, or to increase productivity and/or lessen the chance of turnover

among existing workers, then estimated costs will understate true costs.

<P>

Although this study considers all types of centers, not accredited centers

only, it has similar limitations to the GAO and Powell and Cosgrove studies.

That is, the data used are not as recent as would be desired, and the results

from the four-state sample are not nationally representative.

<P>

Although all three studies have limitations, the estimates do provide information

on the nature of the relationship between child care costs and quality. As

such this research serves as a useful starting point for further consideration

of this topic. The importance of developing cost estimates suggests that

future work incorporating current and nationally representative data will

serve as an important source of information for evaluating public policy

strategies designed to improve the quality of child care. We have discovered

one likely source of such estimates in research currently being conducted

by Richard Brandon at the University of Washington and Lynn Kagan at Yale

University. The authors are developing a detailed simulation model to estimate

costs of improving child care using varied measures of quality. This research,

which the authors estimate will be completed by the fall of 2000, will provide

valuable additional information

<P>

None of these studies include the investment that is likely to be the least

expensive approach to improving quality: caregiver training, including in-service

training. There are a variety of training programs that have been offered

to formal and informal caregivers. The evidence above suggests that

better-trained caregivers give higher-quality care. We do not know enough

about the content or length of these programs to be able to definitively

discuss their cost. Curriculum and materials are readily available (see for

example the materials available from Teaching Strategies, Inc.) One program

suggests that a 12-workshop series would enhance caregiver&#146;s skills

in areas that range from safety through cognitive development and communication

skills.

  <A NAME="conclu">CONCLUSIONS </A>

</H2>

<P>

We conclude this report by returning to primary questions raised in the report:

Does child care quality matter? Does child care quality need to be improved,

and can it be improved? Is there an economic justification for public

intervention to improve the quality of child care, especially for children

from lower-income families? Our answer to each of these questions is

&#147;yes.&#148;

<H3>

  Does Child Care Quality Matter?

</H3>

<P>

Our review of the research literature indicates that child care quality

&#147;matters&#148; at several levels. In terms of children&#146;s everyday

experiences, children appear happier and more cognitively engaged in settings

in which caregivers are interacting with them positively and in settings

in which child:adult ratios are lower. There also is evidence of concurrent

relations between child care quality and children&#146;s performance in other

settings. Children who attend higher-quality child care settings (measured

by caregiver behaviors, by physical facilities, by age-appropriate activities,

and by structural and caregiver characteristics) display better cognitive,

language, and social competencies on standardized tests and according to

parents, teachers, and observers. Finally, there is evidence that child care

quality is related to children&#146;s subsequent competencies. The relationship

is more evident when cumulative measures of child care quality are analyzed,

rather than one-time assessments, and when quality and child outcome measures

have strong psychometric properties.

<H3>

  Does the Quality of Child Care Need to Be Improved, and Can It Be Improved?

</H3>

<P>

Two general approaches to measuring child care quality were described in

this report. Process quality refers to children&#146;s experiences in child

care settings. Some process measures focus specifically on caregivers&#146;

behaviors with children. Others include global ratings that incorporate physical

facilities and age-appropriate child activities as well as caregiver behavior

into their evaluation. Multisite studies suggest considerable need for

improvement of process quality in the United States. Although less than 10

percent of process quality has been categorized as &#147;inadequate&#148;

or &#147;poor,&#148; most settings have been characterized as only

&#147;fair&#148; or &#147;minimal.&#148; These observations indicate the

need for systematic efforts to improve a substantial portion of child care

in the United States.

<P>

A second way of measuring child care quality is in terms of structural and

caregiver characteristics, such as child:adult ratio, group sizes, teacher

formal education, and teacher specialized training. There is an extensive

research literature linking structural and caregiver characteristics to process

quality. A review of regulatory standards in the 50 states shows that few

states have adopted standards that are consistent with the recommendations

of professional organizations. Furthermore, reports from nationally

representative surveys indicate that average group sizes and ratios exceed

recommended standards. Recent evidence suggests a decline in the educational

background of staff during the 1990s, perhaps as a result of low wages. Thus,

it appears that child care structural and caregiver characteristics are in

need of improvement. They can be improved if additional resources are allocated.

This could occur through a combination of increased subsidies for care,

especially to low-income families; federal standards and/or increased state

standards for both physical settings and caregiver training and child:staff

ratios, improved information to parents on the quality of providers, and/or

direct provision or expansion of child care in schools.

<H3>

  Is There an Economic Justification for Public Intervention to Improve the

  Quality of Child Care, Especially for Children from Lower-Income Families?

</H3>

<P>

Market failure, the presence of externalities, and an argument for equality

of opportunity all call for public sector intervention in the child care

market. The primary form of market failure is the lack of information for

parents regarding quality of care which is tied to the difficulty in measuring

quality, the lack of availability of high quality care, and the need for

child care for irregular hours such as weekend and late shifts.

<P>

Benefits of quality child care accrue to other members of society, including

all children in schools with children who had child care; taxpayers, who

are likely to save in costs of future schooling by reduction in special education

and grade retention; employers, who benefit from more productive employees;

and citizens, who gain in terms of future reductions in crime and use of

transfer programs. Subsidizing child care for low-income families is also

consistent with the goals of the 1996 welfare reform and an ideology that

wishes to encourage and reward work. Finally, to the extent that high-quality

child care provides benefits to children and their families, there is an

argument for providing equal opportunity for such programs to children in

low-income families.

<P>

According to the study by the National Academy (Phillips, 1995) low-income

families &#147;are more likely to rely on relatives and less likely to rely

on center-based arrangements. . . Grandparents are an especially prominent

source of child care for low-income, preschool-age children: 17 percent are

cared for mainly by grandparents; 29 percent get some care from a grandparent.

The child care arrangements of low-income families also vary greatly by household

type and parental employment status. . . Single employed mothers rely to

a much greater extent on non-relative arrangements (notably family day care

homes and centers) than do other types of low-income families. In addition,

among low-income families, about 24 percent of children under age 5 are in

more than one supplemental arrangement on a regular basis (Brayfield et al.,

1993). Reliance on multiple arrangements varies, however, from 14 percent

of low-income preschoolers with two parents to 31 percent of those in

single-mother families and 45 percent of those in employed, single-mother

families&#148;(Phillips, 1995, Chapter 2).

Connelly and Kimmel (2000) use a merged sample from the 1992 and 1993 SIPP

panels which include child care questions from June through December 1994.

They examine the choice of child care of full-time vs. part-time employed

mothers, married and single. <A HREF="tables4-13.htm#t13">Table 13</A> shows

their prediction, by marital status, of the marginal effects of the included

variables on the probability of choosing among the 3 modes of child care

for single employed mothers. The first panel uses a single predicted price

for child care and the second includes three predicted prices of care. For

single mothers, the predicted conditional probability of full-time employment

is a significant predictor of child care. As has been suggested by earlier

research, single mothers who are working full-time are more likely to use

center-based care. This also leads to the conclusion that as more mothers

enter full-time employment after leaving welfare, the utilization of center-based

care over other types of care will increase. The reported results also show

that women with more education are more likely to use center-based care or

home-based care and that women on AFDC who receive more dollars are somewhat

more likely to use center-based care and less likely to use relative care.

Somewhat surprisingly, single mothers with higher predicted wages appear

more likely to use relative care or home-based care than center care. The

authors explain this by hypothesizing that higher-wage jobs are more likely

to be positions that require more flexibility than center care can provide

in terms of pick-up and drop-off times and the care of sick children.

<A NAME="8">8)</A>&nbsp; The relationship between structural measures of

quality and total variable costs are also tested, but there is no evidence

of statistically significant relationships. The authors note that their index

measure of quality may be a theoretically superior measure insofar as the

structural characteristics capture only a portion of the &#147;true&#148;

measure of quality. They argue that this is the case if the unobserved center

quality characteristics are correlated with other independent variables.
