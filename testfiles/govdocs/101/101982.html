              <p><span class="subheading">Statement of Justice
               John Paul Stevens:</span></p>
              <p> William Rehnquist's independent, impartial, and dedicated
                 leadership of the Supreme Court has been an inspiration to those
                 of us privileged to serve with him&#151;and to the entire Nation
                 as well. Charles Evans Hughes, a great Chief Justice whom he
                 particularly admired, would have been proud of the example he
                 set as the leader of the Court. He was truly the first among
                 equals in discharging his judicial duties in a prompt, scholarly,
                 and fair manner. He was a good friend, maintaining his sense
                 of humor and proportion throughout the difficult period that
               marked his most recent service. We shall miss him.</p>
              <p><span class="subheading">Statement of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor:</span></p>
              <p>                 William Rehnquist will go down in history as one of the great
                 Chief Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States. He
                 steered the Court along a path of responsibility and careful
                 analysis throughout his 19 years as Chief Justice. He led the
                 Court with firm principles but with a light touch. He never
                 lost his sense of humor and he was able to secure the cooperation
                 and admiration of all of the Justices for the years in which
               he served. He will be sorely missed.</p>
            <p><span class="subheading">Statement of Justice Antonin Scalia:</span></p>
              <p>                 Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist led a philosophically diverse
                 group of Justices through 19 years in which public attention
                 was focused upon the Supreme Court to an unprecedented degree.
                 His keen intellect and sound judgment commanded the respect
                 of his colleagues, and his personal qualities of considerateness
                 and fairness won their affection. His death is a loss to the
                 Court, to all the federal judiciary that he headed for so long,
                 and to the Nation. It is a double loss for me; he was my friend
            long before he was my Chief. May he rest in peace.</p>
              <p><span class="subheading">Statement of Justice Anthony Kennedy:</span></p>
              <p>                 William Rehnquist was a warm, compassionate, decent man; a brilliant
                   jurist; and a Chief Justice of superb and historic stature.
                   In his personal relations he was unpretentious to the point
                   of being casual, almost as if to put friends and colleagues
                   at ease with his vast knowledge of history, remarkable grasp
                   of the law, and a mind so precise he was at once formidable
                   and delightful. He was a skillful presiding officer of exemplary
                   fairness. He loved his family. The American people can be
                   grateful to them for the distinguished public service William
                   Rehnquist gave to the Court and to our Nation.</p>
              <p><span class="subheading">Statement of Justice Clarence Thomas:</span></p>
              <p>                 Virginia and I were deeply saddened to learn of the death of
                   the Chief Justice. We will miss him deeply as a friend and
                   as a colleague. He was a good man who epitomized fairness,
                   dignity, and strength of character. Our thoughts and prayers
                   continue to be with his family.</p>
              <p><span class="subheading">Statement of Justice Ruth Bader 
            Ginsburg:</span></p>
              <p> Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist was the fairest, most efficient
                 boss I have ever had. Speaking of his role in a 2002 address,
                 he said: &ldquo;[T]he Chief Justice has placed in his hands
                 some of the tools which will enable him to be <em>primus</em> among the
                 <em>pares</em> but his stature will depend on how he uses them.&rdquo; In
                 his leadership of the U.S. Judiciary and his superintendence
                 of the Supreme Court, William H. Rehnquist used to great effect
            the tools Congress and tradition entrusted to him.</p>
              <p>                 A plain speaker without airs or affectations, the Chief fostered
                 a spirit of collegiality among the nine of us perhaps unparalleled
                 in the Court's history. He regarded an independent Judiciary
                 as our country's hallmark and pride, and in his annual
                 reports, he constantly urged Congress to safeguard that independence.
                 On the obligation key to judging, he cautioned that a judge
                 steps out of the proper judicial role most conspicuously and
                 dangerously when the judge flinches from a decision that is
                 legally right because the bottom line is not the one &ldquo;the
                 home crowd wants.&rdquo; I held him in highest regard and affection,
            and will miss him greatly.</p>
            <p><span class="subheading">Statement of Justice Stephen G. Breyer:</span></p>
            <p>              The Chief Justice was a brave, intelligent man deeply committed
                to maintaining the rule of law and preserving an independent
              judiciary.</p>
            <p> He understood the Court and its history. He administered the
                Court, as he did the judicial system, effectively and with great
                fairness. He never allowed disagreements about the law to become
                personal and the Court followed his example. I much admired
                his personal and legal strength. I shall greatly miss him. </p>
