CLIMATOLOGICAL SUMMARY FOR DETROIT - JULY 2002
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE DETROIT/PONTIAC MI        
400 PM EDT THU AUG 1 2002

...FREQUENT HOT WEATHER PRODUCES THE 8TH WARMEST JULY ON RECORD
   AND THE 9TH WARMEST MONTH ON RECORD...
...DRY WEATHER FIRST HALF GIVES WAY TO WET WEATHER SECOND HALF.... 
...NOTABLE SUMMER DRY SPELL VISITS MID JUNE TO MID JULY...

JULY'S WEATHER CONTINUED THE TREND OF LATE JUNE WITH TEMPERATURES 
ABOVE TO WELL ABOVE NORMAL. THE UPPER RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE THAT
OSCILLATED BACK AND FORTH OVER THE COUNTRY LATE SPRING INTO EARLY
SUMMER...BEGAN TO HOLD AND BUILD MORE STEADILY FROM THE ROCKIES TO
THE EAST COAST. THIS RIDGE RETREATED TO NEAR THE WEST COAST ONLY 
BRIEFLY AT TIMES AND THUS...ALLOWED JUST GLANCING BLOWS OF COOLER
AIR TO FILTER DOWN. THE AVERAGE TEMPERATURE FOR JULY OF 76.5 DEGREES
/+3.0/ TIED WITH JULY 1952 FOR 8TH WARMEST JULY IN DETROIT SINCE 1870. 
IN ADDITION...THAT 76.5 DEGREE AVERAGE MADE THE NINTH SPOT FOR WARMEST 
MONTHS EVER IN DETROIT (TIED WITH JULY 1952 AND AUGUST 1947). 

RIGHT OFF THE GET GO...THE MONTH STARTED OFF HOT AND SULTRY AS 
TEMPERATURES PUSHED WELL INTO THE NINETIES THROUGH THE FOURTH OF 
JULY. HIGH TEMPERATURES IN THE MID 90S DURING THOSE FIRST FOUR DAYS 
CAME WITHIN TWO OR THREE DEGREES OF THE DAILY RECORD HIGHS /98-100/. 
A BACKDOOR COLD FRONT SLID THROUGH THE REGION ON THE 5TH AND BROUGHT 
REFRESHINGLY COOLER TEMPERATURES (HIGH OF 80) BUT WITH LITTLE FANFARE 
IN THE WAY OF RAIN. 

THE WARM TO HOT WEATHER...FREQUENTLY ACCOMPANIED BY OPPRESSIVE 
HUMIDITY...RETURNED AND BASICALLY CONTINUED THROUGH MUCH OF JULY 
WITH ONLY BRIEF REPRIEVES. HIGH TEMPERATURES REACHED 90 OR BETTER 
12* TIMES DURING THE MONTH...MORE THAN DOUBLE THE NORMAL /5/. THE 
RECORD NUMBER OF 90 DEGREE OR BETTER DAYS FOR JULY OCCURRED...NOT 
SURPRISINGLY...DURING OUR HOTTEST MONTH EVER RECORDED...JULY 1955.
THE AVERAGE TEMPERATURE THAT MONTH WAS 79.1 AND TEMPERATURES REACHED 
90 OR BETTER ON 17 DAYS. SO FAR THIS YEAR...18 DAYS HAVE RECORDED 
A 90 OR BETTER (ON AVERAGE WE HAVE 12). WHAT MADE THE HEAT EVEN WORSE 
THIS JULY WAS THE LACK OF RAIN FROM THE 1ST THROUGH 17TH WITH ONLY 
.16 OF AN INCH FALLING AT DETROIT METRO AIRPORT. LOOKING FURTHER BACK... 
FROM MID JUNE /18TH/ THROUGH MID JULY /17TH/... JUST ABOUT A THIRD OF 
AN INCH /.32/ FELL IN THE NOTABLE DRY SPELL. TAKE NOTE HOWEVER...A DRY 
SPELL (LESS THAN .50 INCH OF RAIN IN A TWO TO FOUR WEEK PERIOD) IS MORE 
THE NORM THAN NOT IN SOUTHEAST MICHIGAN DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS. WHAT 
MADE THIS DRY SPELL WORSE...HOWEVER...WAS: 1) THE HEAT THAT ACCOMPANIED 
IT...2) ITS TIMING (DURING MAXIMUM GROWING SEASON AND ESPECIALLY AFTER 
A DIFFICULT START) AND...3) THE FOUR WEEK DURATION WHICH MADE THIS DRY 
SPELL EVEN MORE PRONOUNCED WITH SOME AREAS ACTUALLY REACHING MODERATE 
DROUGHT CONDITIONS. IT IS ALSO INTERESTING THAT VIRTUALLY THE SAME DRY 
PATTERN OCCURRED LAST SUMMER AND WAS ALSO ACCOMPANIED BY ABOVE NORMAL 
TEMPERATURES. IRONICALLY...DURING LAST SUMMER'S DRY SPELL (JUNE 24TH-
JULY 28TH)...WE ALSO RECEIVED JUST .32 OF AN INCH OF RAIN.

WITH DRY WEATHER DOMINATING THE FIRST HALF OF THE MONTH...SEVERE 
WEATHER WAS NEGLIGIBLE BUT...ALONG WITH THE RAINFALL...BEGAN TO PICK 
UP DURING THE SECOND HALF. A SMALL CLUSTER OF STRONG TO SEVERE STORMS 
LOCALLY KNOCKED DOWN SOME TREES IN LIVONIA AND WARREN DURING THE 
AFTERNOON OF THE 18TH. ALSO ON THE 18TH...A STORM WITH VERY HEAVY RAIN 
WAS RESPONSIBLE IN DUMPING OVER AN INCH /1.05/ AT METRO AIRPORT AND 
THUS...STARTED TO RELIEVE THE DRY CONDITIONS. A MORE SUBSTANTIAL 
CONVECTIVE OUTBREAK TOOK PLACE AHEAD OF A RATHER STRONG COLD FRONT FOR 
LATE JULY ON THE 22ND. WHILE LINES OF STRONG TO SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS 
PLOWED THROUGH THE REGION INTERMITTENTLY THROUGH THE DAY...THE MAIN 
BLAST OF SEVERE WEATHER OCCURRED FROM MID AFTERNOON INTO EARLY EVENING. 
WIDESPREAD REPORTS OF HAIL AND WIND DAMAGE WERE RECEIVED WITH HAIL UP 
TO AN INCH IN DIAMETER AND WINDS GUSTS OF BETWEEN 50 TO 70 MPH. SEVERAL 
TREES AND POWER LINES WERE DOWNED CREATING SCATTERED POWER OUTAGES. 
THAT STRONG FRONT WAS FOLLOWED BY A RATHER COOL MORNING (ESPECIALLY
WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE HOT MONTH)...WHEN THE TEMPERATURE FELL TO 57 ON
THE 24TH. THIS 57 WAS JUST FIVE DEGREES ABOVE THE RECORD LOW /52/ AND
THE LOW HERE AT THE NWS IN WHITE LAKE FELL TO 50.
 
SOME MORE ISOLATED STRONG TO SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OCCURRED ON THE 28TH 
AND 29TH WITH THE MOST NOTABLE OVER MACOMB AND ST CLAIR COUNTY ON THE
28TH. A STORM INTENSIFIED TO A CLASSIC SUPERCELL AND DEVELOPED A WEAK 
TORNADO /F0/ NEAR NEW HAVEN AS IT MOVED ACROSS NORTHERN MACOMB INTO 
SOUTHERN ST. CLAIR COUNTY. THE STORM DID JUST A LITTLE DAMAGE TO TREES 
SINCE THE TOUCHDOWN WAS BRIEF AND THE FUNNEL WEAK.
