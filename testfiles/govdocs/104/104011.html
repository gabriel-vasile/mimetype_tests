Thursday 18 Jan:
=================

Lionel and myself were in the tunnel this morning to install the motors at
A1 and A2. I had enough time to test the motors of D1, D2, A2 up, A2 in,
A2 out, and A1 up. I moved D1 two times in and out, D2 four times in and
out, and A1 and A2 two times out and one time in (all the tested pots are
left in the out position now). Only D2 shows big problems. It can move in
without problem but it is difficult to move it out... The last third part
is problematic, and was becoming worse and worse. On the first test it was
stuck at high speed about 5 times, and going to low speed cures the
problem even if the motor seems to have already some difficulties at low
speed. On the fourth test, it was stuck about 20 times... I guess we
should get D2 put apart and dismounted. All the other tests were fully
successful and the pot moves in and out at high speed without any problem
at all.


Friday 19/01
=============

This afternoon, Carlos, Lionel and myself went into the tunnel after we
managed to get some keys... before, we tested one bunch of ribbon cables
we took away from the tunnel yesterday at P1. In this bunch, only 3 cables
were good and 7 bad.

In the tunnel, we finished testing the motors at A1, A2 and all the arms
are working properly. We left the pots in the OUT position. Before we
started to move the pots, we called Doug who wanted to check if the vacuum
changes when we are moving the pots, and he said that he noticed that
yesterday when we were moving A2. One interface board was also tested in
the tunnel for the dipoles and was found to work properly. Also, the
number of turns was found to be correct. We finished by tested the
remaining ribbon cables on the A1, A1, dipoles side:

- the 5 cable bunch: 2 cables were bad (connectors broken), the bunch has
been brought back to LAB 3

- the 8 cable bunch was already almost removed from the cable tray, and 2
cables were bad (bad connector, and a short circuit), it has also been
brought to LAB 3

- the 10 cable bunch has been tested, 8 cables are good, one cable has a
broken connector, and one cable has no connection on channel 1. This cable
has been left in the tunnel since it can be used as a 8 cable bunch fro the
dipole. It needs to be labeled.This is the only bunch remaining in the
tunnel now.

We also gave 20 more ribbon cables to Bob Jones for repair, and I told him
that this task is more urgent than the other one. Starting one Monday, two
technicians will work on this.

Here is a short update of what happened in the tunnel. Lionel and I were in
the tunnel. We finished installing the motors on P1 and P2 (only P1 down is
not installed), and all of them are tested. All pots are moving fine without
any problems. All the pots were left in OUT position, except of course P1
DOWN which has not been tested. The encoders have also been installed on P1.

We also tested the remaining bunch of ribbon cables in the tunnel which is
going to P2, and found 8 good cables and 2 bad (one wire connected to
ground). So, we decided to leave it there and we labelled as RC-35-1...8.
The wrong cables are still in the tunnel (16C20021 and 16C20026) but have no
usual label RC-**-#, sothat they could not be used later on. We also
labelled the other bunch of 8 good cables going to D1-D2 as RC-36-1...8. In
this bunch there are also two bad cables (16C20483, and 16C20486 with
respectively a broken connctor, and a dead wire), whichhave also no usual
label to identify them.

This evening, we also brought another basket of ribbon cables into the
tunnelusing Doug's truck, which was not easy (it took us 2.5 hours). Thsi
means that the ribbon cables are the tunnel now and ready to be installed
starting next Monday.

Here is the shift schedule for next week. The main aim of next week will
be the installation of the ribbon cables in the tunnel.
Please let me know if the dates are not ok for you.

========================================================================
Friday 2 February   |  Mike                    |  Christophe
                    |  Molina ?                |  Lionel
========================================================================

PS; these  shifts will be mainly in the tunnel. People should meet in the 
    Tevatron control room at about 12:30 to exchange keys. I will also try
    to meet Viktor and Molina on Monday sothat we could disuss about the
    shift. You can phone me at 8598.

Now, there is already one bunch of 8 cables (RC-36...) going to the
dipoles, and one bunch of cables going to P2 (RC-35...). 
So, what remains to be pulled:
- to D1, D2: 1 bunch of 8 cables
- to A1: 1 bunch of 9 cables
         2 bunches of 8 cables
         1 bunch of 7 cables
- to A2: 1 bunch of 9 cables
         2 bunches of 8 cables
         1 bunch of 7 cables
- to P1: 4 bunches of 8 cables
- to P2: 2 bunches of 8 cables
         1 bunch of 7 cables

Another good news: we checked this afternoon that two cables will be
enough for the dipoles, so this means we save two bunches. In other words,
we will probably have enough cables to have ribbon cables to all detectors
and in addition 4 bunches for the collsion hall, since the reapirs made by
Bob Jones are perfect now!

Here are the cable lengths needed for the LMB cables in the tunnel. This
is based on Petra's e-mail describing the overall plan, and measurements I
made in the tunnel.

Dipole Repairs
---------------

This morning Eduardo and I re-worked the dipole pots in the tunnel. For
both D1 (Macacao) and D2 (Guajara) we dis-assembled the inner arm, removed
the grease on the piston (plunger), removed the burrs on the nut gear,
sanded the burrs on the nut gear, applied the molykote grease, and
re-assembled the pot arms. Both arms had burrs on the nut gear but D1 had
less than the usual amount of burring that I have found on my other
repairs. 

After re-assembling, both arms were moved in and out twice at fast speed
without getting stuck and without the motor haning up. This motion test
was with the castle at atmospheric pressure. The castle will be pumped
down sometime in the next few days and we must test them again under
vacuum.


P1 & P2 testing
---------------

This afternoon Sergio and I installed 1 motor on the top arm of the P1 pot
(Matinada) and tested the top arm. It moved out in slow speed, then in and
out in fast speed OK without sticking.

We also installed 4 motors on the P2 pot (Laranjeries) and tested the top
arm which had some trouble with sticking. The first time out the P2 pot
got stuck twice near the out position. Each time simply stopping and
restarting the motor was enough to start the pot moving again. The pot
then moved in at fast speed OK. The second time out at fast speed the pot
got stuck again about 2 mm from the full out position. Stopping and
restarting the motor was enough to start the pot moving again. After this
the pot was moved in and out at fast speed three times without sticking.

The other three arms of the P2 pot have not been tested yet. In the tunnel
we left: the driver and local control switch box, 1 motor without a
coupler, and the tool box. We also ran out of screws to attach any more
motors so we will need more of these. There were three "new" couplers
which do not fit and I have these in my office for now. (These are the
ones that do not have the middle section of the coupler machined out so
the shaft on the castle and the shaft on the motor cannot be placed close
enough together to attach the motor.)


ANDREW

Today (01/25/01) we had a couple FPD meetings to discuss plans between now
and March 1.  The current accelerator plan is to run from March 1-31 with
protons only in the beginning working towards collisions by Mar 31, with
NO ACCESSES during this time period! Our main plan is to get the cables
and pot electronics installed and tested. Everyone (but me!) has been
working very hard laying cables, and a major milestone was acheived
Tuesday as the ribbon cables were layed in the collision hall, hours
before the D0 detector was due to  begin roll in. Congrats to everyone who
made this possible. The baking is done, and the motors are being installed
to test the pots, this should finish tomorrow. Ribbon cabling will
continue next week (as Bob Jones group is now repairing broken connectors
at a good rate), with electronics installation to follow soon after.  The
black cables for the PMT's will arrive in about two weeks and be layed
right after. In the next week or so electronics installation will begin.
The goal is to complete this by mid-February to allow for a couple weeks
of testing the pot motion and improving the online  programs.  We need to
have our ORC review some time in February as well!

Some of the key issues are deciding on a pre-multiplexor arrangement of
rack monitors and power boxes and smoke detectors. We would like to only
attach the drivers to the power boxes and would favor having smoke
detectors only at A2 and P2 if allowed. We need to understand the number
of smoke detectors required and how we will manage this with limited rack
monitors.  We would like to be able to move at least 12 pots if all 18 is
not possible (others would be moved periodically during accesses to keep
them  going smoothly). This is one of the first items of discussion upon
Mario's arrival. I would propose a video meeting Monday 1-3 in doghouse
with Christophe, Lionel, Eduardo, Mario (+me) to discuss this and high
voltage, that would leave Molina+Sergio free for shift. Eduardo is working
on setting up the HV and determining missing cables, and fan outs, and
hopes to have this done before he leaves in mid-Feb.

Some work items:

1) Lionel should prepare a list of electronics installation tasks with
   estimated manpower and time required. This should include time for
   testing.  He will send this around for comment.  

2) Lionel will prepare a no-smoke detector RM proposal and a 2 smoke
   detector RM proposal and verify that we have the correct 1553 cable to
   make these proposals work. He will also cound power boxes (we believe
   we have 5 of the 9 needed, and other 4 should have been made by Rick).

3) Carlos+Molina will check the HV and green cable situation in the 
   tunnel. Carlos will give an inventory of engineering cables to be
   reused.

4) We need a total list of unaccounted for cables, with Eduardo and
   Christophe's help, so we can buy, borrow, or steal the rest and give 
   one final cable list to Bob Jones by the middle of next week, and not
   keep bothering him one cable at a time!

5) Victor is working on the amplifier testing plan and will consult with
   Mario upon his arrival.  Ideally all the amplifiers would be tested and
   installed before March 1, but some can be installed after April 1 if
   necessary--we should at least have enough for D1,D2,P1up and P2up by
   Mar. 1.  We may not have the low voltage supplies to run the amplifiers
   anyway.  One of the other first day priorities of Mario is to identify
   appropriate Low voltage supplies for quick purchase. As soon as we know
   the price, I will try to find  money for this.

6) We also need to purchase connectors for cartridges, and for joining
   ribbon cables. I need Mario+Lionel to identify the types of connectors
   so we can determine price, and find the money to order them right away.

7) Christophe is preparing estimates of the remaining ribbon cable
   preparing and laying manpower

8) Mike is preparing estimates of the black cable laying manpower, both in
   the tunnel and through the detector. A bigger whole needs to be made to
   accommodate our cables in the detector.

9) Other cartridges need to be assembled along with new pseudodetectors.

10) Two new  detectors need final assembly and to be installed in
    cartridges. Al boxes have not been completed by Phill yet--maybe
    within two weeks.

Other items:

Remaining drivers+LVDT's are scheduled to arrive last week in February. It
will be close to see if we can install these before Mar. 1, some time
should be left available the last couple days in Feb for this.  The driver
crates for D,P1,P2,A1 should be installed, and the last 4 drivers would go
in A2, so the crate should be ready to receive them. LVDT's should also be
installed last on the A2 castle and on A horizontal pots and Pout pots.

New stronger couplers should arrive in early February.  It is possible
that they may need to be machined, since some of the last set of couplers
had a slight obstruction in the middle making them ineffective. I will
call Berg to check on this.

AFE news:

The AFE boards are significantly delayed.  Latest estimates have them
available as early as May 1 and as late as July 1.  Given these estimates
and the lateness of our AFE interface, we are preparing for the likelihood
of commissioning without AFE boards.  We had significant discussion about
the diversion of resources required to do this.  Right now our main action
will be approx 2 day effort to divert 4 bunches of ribbon cables (P1out
P2out A1in A2in) and lay them instead from PW08 to the Small control
room.  This would allow us to hook up to any castle with detectors in them
and read them out with the Feras (fast ADC's). Carlos is teaching Molina
about the standalone daq, which we will resurrect in March if needed. 
Carlos+Jon Streets would be available by email, and Mario and Gilvan would
be in town to aid with this. Carlos verified that the timing is okay, if
we use green cables from PW08 to small control room for PMT's (other
option would be to use short cables from MCH to SCR, but this may not be
allowed--I will check). 12 ~200 ft green cables will be required for
this--a more precise distance from Mike+Carlos would be good. These cables
must be found prepared labelled+layed as well. *Carlos please check
timing. This would require replacing 200 ft green by 160 black+perhaps 100
green--I think this is still ok.
