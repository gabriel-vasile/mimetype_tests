~ the negative statement was removed; in requests A8 and Bli the diffi-

culties caused by common words used in a technical sense prompted selection

of one or two synonyms for the given words; and in two requests keypunching

errors which preserved hyphenated words were correctede  These six modifi-

cations are all thought to represent reasonable demands that would be made

to users of an operational systeme

        These 21+ requests are now processed together with the 12 requests

for which no modification was made; they are described as "}~B~d Modified";

a total of 36 results because request Al is split into two.  Comparison of

retrieval performance of the modified with the original unmodified requests

is made for six retrieval runs in Figures 16 and 17.  All precision recall

curves for the hand modified requests show them to be superior over the whole

performance range, with increases in precision at most recall values of more

than 5%, and in the middle recall ranges of nearly 10%.

        Using the Abstract thesaurus result for analysis, the six requests

that were quite severely modified did not perform very well, only Bil was

notably improved, and some of the others received a worse performance.  Of

the seventeen requests that had triply weighted important words, ten were

improved, five has a worse performance, and two remained unaffected.  Four

of the ten that were improved are shown in Figure 18, and the two that were

worsened by the greatest amounts are given in Figure 19, with rank positions

for all the relevant and normalized measures.

        It is of interest to note that at present these hand modifications

do produce a superior result to the relevance feedback process described

elsewhere (3].  Figure 20 includes a comparison, using an evaluation tech-

nique that differs from the plots in Figures 16 and 17 in order to achieve

a fully user-oriented evaluation (4,5).  Further work on relevance feedback
