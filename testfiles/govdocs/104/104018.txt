sp-comm : My main complaint is that this 2000+ supercomputer is being
used in a broad user based time-share envionment as 10-20
clusters. The factional use with > 512 (0r even >256) is to small.
We are paying dearly for unsued connectivity and the system is not
being used properly. For the same hardware price, NERSC could
be a \"cluster center\" offering 3-5x more FLOP\'s per year. The users
need a computer center with more capacity (not capabiity). If we
had a \"cluster center\", a machine like seaborg could be freed up
the it\'s best use....codes that need and can used > 1024 (or2048)
ps.   The expansion ratio (turn-around time/actual run time) has
much improved this year (generally below 2 and used to be often
> 10); but next year seaborg is going to be overloaded again
t3e-comm : With the demise of the T3E seaborg loading is going to get worse.
pvp-comm : With the demise of the PVP, the loading of seaborg is going to get
worse....there is now no place to run the vector codes
