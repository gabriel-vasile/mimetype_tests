And, of course, telemetry, voice, and TV could all be selected from different sites.  Also bear in mind that there could be three uplinks - CSM, LM and EASEP/ALSEP. The 9m stations (CRO, HAW, GWM on this longitude) were generally used for the EASEP/ALSEP support.&quot;]<p>[As detailed in Hamish Lindsay's book </i>Tracking Apollo to the Moon<i>, the Moon rose at Honeysuckle Creek at about 108:43; and it was the Honeysuckle TV downlink that was used at the time of Neil's &quot;one small step&quot;  at 109:24:48.  Much of the TV downlink for the rest of the EVA was received thru the radio astronomy dish at Parkes, Australia.  Goldstone continued to handle uplink responsibilities until the present handover.]<p>[According to the relevant page from the <a href="A11_Saxon_log_16.jpg" title="image" target="new">HSK log kept by John Saxon</a>, the GDS-to-HSK uplink handover was done at 05:42 GMT, which corresponds to a Ground Elapsed Time (GET) of 112:10.

Can you give us some idea of how you're progressing on the PLSS doffing and preparation for Depress?<blockquote><i>[Once they have doffed the PLSSs and have gotten unnecessary gear packed away in a trash bag, they will depressurize the cabin and jettison the PLSSs and the trash.]</i></blockquote><b><a name="1122056">112:20:56</a></b> Aldrin: Roger, Houston.  Tranquility Base.  We're in the process of using up what film we have, and I'm just getting ready to change the primary <a href="../alsj-LM-ECS.html" target="new">ECS</a> canister.  Over.<blockquote><i>[They are finishing up magazines 37/R, taking AS11-37-5460 to 5555, and 39/Q, taking AS11-39-5792 to 5839.  Journal Contributor Bob Farwell has selected frames from Magazine 37/R for a <a href="a11postpan37.jpg" title="image" target="new">pan</a> covering both windows.  Note that Farwell's construction involves a certain amount of artistic license because neither Neil or Buzz actually had an unrestricted view from side to side, as shown by pans assembled from Magazine 39/Q images for the <a href="a11.cdrwin_bw.jpg" title="image" target="new">CDR window</a> and the <a href="a11.lmpwin_bw.jpg" title="image" target="new">LMP window</a>.  Exercising a bit more artistic license, Farwell has created an <a href="a11postpan37ex.jpg" title="image" target="new">enhanced version</a> by using pre-EVA image AS11-37-<a href="images11.html#5452" target="new">5452</a> to fill the a gap in the post-EVA coverage below Neil's window.  Finally, Farwell, modified Figure 10.12 from the Lunar Sourcebook to provided a <a href="a11-postmap.jpg" title="image" target="new">rough comparison with the assembled pan</a>.  Farwell has provided a fuller <a href="AS11-Farwell.pdf" target="new">discussion of the assembled pan and related items</a>.]<p>[Frame <a href="images11.html#5480" target="new">5480</a> shows the view out Buzz's window, including the flag and the TV camera.  Note the cluster of boulders in the background.  These may have been ejected from West Crater.]<p>[All the photos taken at this time are out the forward windows except AS11-37-5506 to 5509 which are photos of Earth taken out the rendezvous window over Neil's head.  These may be the Earth photos that Neil remembers taking - rather than AS11-40-5923 and 5924, the two taken out on the surface, probably by Buzz.  Note that none of these photos have <a href="../alsj-reseau.html" target="new">reseau crosses</a>, indicating that they were taken with the IVA Hasselblad.  The EVA Hasselblad was purposefully left outside.] <p>[Aldrin, from the 1969 Technical Debrief - &quot;This period was prolonged a bit to try to make as much use of the film remaining.  I think we probably took more pictures than we should have in an effort to make sure that we covered each particular window as thoroughly as possible and with as wide a range of settings as we could before we proceeded to jettison the camera.&quot;]<p>[During the 1991 mission review, we talked a little about the post-EVA window pan.] <p>[Aldrin - &quot;Look at how the dust kicked up around here (near the flag and the TV camera beyond).  It makes it really darker, as viewed from this angle which is sort of out to the front and the right (that is, northwest out Buzz's window).&quot;] <p>[Jack Schmitt has hypothesized that, during the landing, the LM engines sweep away a lot of the very fine dust and leave behind a surface with a disproportionate number of small rock fragments sticking up.  These reflect more sunlight than the normal surface would, making it look brighter than normal.  Certainly, from orbit, the areas around the landed LM's are brighter than the surrounding countryside.  Then, when the crew walks around near the LM, they stir up the soil and return it to something closer to its normal condition.  Against the abnormally bright background, then, the disturbed soil looks dark.  In support of his contention, Jack notes that, at geology stations far from the LM, disturbed soil doesn't look dark.] <p>[I asked how the horizon looked.] <p>[Armstrong - &quot;The horizon looks close.  But, because it's hilly you're probably not seeing all the horizon you could see.An intermediate hill is probably cutting it out.  It wasn't mountainous in our area; it was flat.  But there were still crater rims and so on that probably affected how far out the observable horizon was.&quot;]</i></blockquote><b>112:21:14</b> McCandless: Roger, Tranquility.  We'd like to hold off as long as possible on the lithium hydroxide canister.  Make that one of the last things you do in getting ready for the Depress, if you can.  Over.<p><b>112:21:31</b> Aldrin: Roger.  We're planning on doing that.  I was just wondering how much longer we want to wait, though.  We've probably got another half an hour's worth of picture taking, and I guess we could run through an eat cycle and then change the canister, and then Depress.  Over.<p><b>112:21:56</b> McCandless: Roger.  That sounds fine to us.<p><b>112:22:02</b> Aldrin: Well, it'll be a little crowded in here for a while.<p><b><a name="112:22:06">112:22:06</a></b> McCandless: Oh, we don't mind a bit!  (Pause)<blockquote><i>[If they eat before they do the depress and equipment ejection, they will have to take their helmets off.  There is little spare room in the cabin and, with two rock boxes, the LEVAs, the helmets, and the PLSSs in the cabin with them, they will be cramped  for space.  Of course, on the last three missions, the crews took their suits off between EVAs and the cabin was even more crowded.  Fortunately, lunar gravity is weak enough that there is no discomfort in standing for hours at a stretch and, consequently, much of the gear can be piled - more or less out of the way - on the engine cover.] <p>[Armstrong, from the 1969 Technical Debrief - &quot;There was still a full truckload of equipment inside that cockpit at the end of the EVA.  It's just a bunch of stuff, and I was glad that we were able to get rid of a lot of it and finish the jettison before we started our sleep period.  With all that stuff in the cockpit, there's really no place left for people to relax.&quot;] <p>[Crews on the later missions had <a href="../LM10f1-6Hammocks.jpg" title="image" target="new">hammocks</a> which helped solve the crowding problem during the rest period.] <p>[Armstrong, from the 1969 Technical Debrief - &quot;The post-EVA checklist went very well.  It was well planned, and we went precisely by the pre-planned route with possibly a few exceptions.  They...probably took about the same or a little more time than we expected.  Of course, the time period that we took while we were waiting for the canister (replacement) before starting the repressurization was comparably long.  We had to put an eat period in there, as I remember, and took a lot of pictures.&quot;] <p> [Aldrin, from the 1969 Technical Debrief, discussing the LiOH canister change - &quot;We elected to leave the helmets on because, at this point, there was so much stuff rattling around inside the cabin that they would have added just one more bulky item.  The primary canister change proceeded quite well to the point of inserting the new canister.  I ran into a minor problem in getting it to rotate fully so that I could get the cover on.  When it finally did seat itself properly, I can't for sure identify what I did differently from the times it didn't seem to rotate.  That seemed to be what was stopping the cover from going on completely - the fact that, when the canister was inserted, I couldn't seem to rotate it as much as I thought it should have been rotated.&quot;] <p>[The LiOH canisters go into the inboard face of the <a href="../alsj-LM-ECS.html" target="new">ECS</a> unit behind Buzz.  He had to face the rear of the spacecraft to do the change, but could do it with his right hand.  It is not clear when, exactly, Buzz did the canister change.  He and Neil did eat prior to doing the depress and jettison and did, of course, take their helmets off for at least a little while. They reported that they were finished eating at <a href="#1131752" target="new">113:17:52</a>.  At some point, Buzz takes AS11-37-<a href="images11.html#5528" target="new">5528</a>, which is an excellent portrait of Neil in his Snoopy cap.  Neil also took some photos of Buzz - AS11-37-<images11.html#5530" target="new">5530</a> to<images11.html#5534" target="new">5534</a>, unfortunately all dominated by the bright window behind Buzz.

I need a very precise position, because I can only do a decent job of scanning maybe one of those grid squares at a time.The area that we've been sweeping (this is, the area covered by the various estimated positions) covers 10's and 20's and 30's of them.<p><b>112:35:00</b> McCandless: Roger.

How's the fuel coming?<p><b>112:35:18</b> McCandless: Roger.  There's no problem fuel-wise.  It's just that there seems to be a limit to the number of P22's and the number of grid squares you can search.  Over.<p><b>112:35:32</b> Collins: Rog.  Well, I'll continue this maneuver, then, to roll 82, pitch 218, yaw zero, if that's okay with you, and do a P52 in that attitude.  And that'll be the sleep attitude.<p><b>112:35:48</b> McCandless: Roger.  That's fine with us.  And P52 in that attitude.  (Pause)  Roger.  A P52 and then the sleep attitude.<blockquote><i>[Very  Long Comm Break] <p>[As the Command Module - or the LM, for that matter - orbits the Moon, it remains in an inertial attitude.  That is, the spacecraft axis remains fixed relative to the stars, but not to the lunar surface.  Because the Moon doesn't move terribly far in its orbit around Earth during a rest period, the spacecraft attitude relative to Earth doesn't change very much either and, if need be, Houston can wake Mike from his sleep during any of the front side passes.]</i></blockquote><b>112:43:46</b> McCandless: Tranquility Base, this is Houston.

Thank you, Bruce.  If you...(Listens)  Go ahead.<p><b>114:33:59</b> Garriott: Tranquility, Houston.  First question here is how your best estimate of the yaw of the LM as compared to the nominal pre-flight plan.  Over.<p><b>114:34:16</b> Armstrong: (Sounding congested)  We're yawed 13 degrees left on the ball, and I think that's probably about right.  Looking at the shadow and so on, we're probably about 13 degrees left of the shadow.<p><b>114:34:31</b> Garriott: Roger.  That's 13 degrees left of the shadow.<blockquote><i>[That is, the spacecraft is facing about 13 degrees south of west.] <p>[Aldrin, from the 1969 Technical Debrief - &quot;I want to inject a thought about spacecraft location in respect to lunar surface working conditions.  Putting the area of the MESA in shadow also put the (TV) cable in the shadow.  The white cable, being covered with a little bit of this powdery stuff and being in the shadow, was very difficult to observe.  Consideration should be given to keeping any cable or small object out in sunlight whenever possible.  It leads one to think that, if you're going to yaw one way or the other, it's preferable to put your working areas out into the sunlight.&quot;] <p>[The unintended left yaw put the MESA farther into the LM shadow than it would have been otherwise.] <p>[Armstrong, from the 1969 Technical Debrief - &quot;We discussed - pre-launch, on a number of occasions - whether we wanted to yaw specifically for lighting at touchdown.  There are obviously a lot of advantages, but I was very reluctant to do any fancy maneuvering on the first lunar touchdown for selected yaw for lighting considerations.  I figured we'd just take what we got; and we paid for that later, because we had a lot of operations in the shadow during the EVA that would have been easier had we had better lighting.&quot;]<p>[Readers should note that this quote differs from the one originally transcribed by NASA.  Neil provided the correction in 1995.]</i></blockquote><b>114:34:35</b> Garriott: And, next question relates to the depth of the bulk sampling that you obtained near the first part of the EVA and any changes in composition that you might have observed during the bulk sampling interval.  Over.<p><b>114:35:02</b> Armstrong: I'm not sure I understand that question, but we got a good bit of the ground mass in the bulk sample plus a sizable number of selected rock fragments of different types.  (Pause)<p><b>114:35:22</b> Garriott: Roger, Neil.  One of the implications here is the depth from which the bulk sample was collected.  Did you manage to get down there several inches or nearer the surface?  Over.<p><b>114:35:37</b> Armstrong: We've got some down from as much as 3 inches.  In the area where I was looking at variation with depth in the bulk sample, there really wasn't appreciable difference, and I didn't run into any hard pan.Later on, or at some other times and other areas, why, I'd get down just a short distance, an inch or two, and couldn't go any further.<p><b>114:36:06</b> Garriott: Roger.  Believe we understand down as deep as 3 inches, did not hit any hard bed, and no significant changes in composition to that depth.  Next question.The second SRC was packed rather hurriedly due to the time limitation, and wonder if you would be able to provide any more detailed description of the samples which were included in the second SRC.  Over.<p><b>114:36:40</b> Armstrong: We got two core tubes and the solar wind and about half of a big sample bag full of assorted rocks which I picked up hurriedly from around the area.  I tried to get as many representative types as I could.<p><b>114:37:09</b> Garriott: Roger, Neil.  Next topic here relates to the rays which emanate from the DPS (Descent Propulsion System) engine burning area.We're wondering if the rays emanating from beneath the engine are any darker or lighter than the surrounding surface.  Over.  (Pause)<p><b>114:37:42</b> Aldrin: The ones that I saw back in the aft end of the spacecraft appeared to be a good bit darker.  Of course, as viewed from the aft end, why, they did have the Sun shining directly on them.It seemed as though the material had been baked somewhat and also scattered in a radially-outward direction, but in that particular area, this feature didn't extend more than about 2, maybe 3 feet, from the skirt of the engine.  Over.<p><b>114:38:24</b> Garriott: Roger.  Understand that near the aft end - out to the east - that the rays did appear darker.  I understand, Buzz, that these were...(that) this was the appearance of the material which had been uncovered by the rays that appeared darker for 2 or 3 feet extending outward.  Is that correct?<p><b>114:38:49</b> Aldrin: No.  I wouldn't say it was necessarily material that had been uncovered.  I think some of the material might have been baked or in some way caused to be more cohesive and perhaps flow together in some way.I don't know.  Now, in other areas, before we started trampling around out front, why, we could see that (some) small erosion had taken place in a radially-outward direction; but it had left no significant mark on the surface other than just having eroded it away.Now, it was different right under the skirt itself.  It seems as though the surface had been baked in a streak fashion, and I think a couple of pictures on film will show this.But that didn't extend out very far.  Over.<p><b>114:39:48</b> Garriott: Roger, Tranquility.  And this baked appearance that you described, at least the suggestion is that it was due to the heat of the engine at any rate.  Next subject, did...<p><b>114:40:01</b> Aldrin: I believe so.<p><b>114:40:02</b> Garriott: Roger.  Next subject, did either of the solar panels on the PSE touch the surface of the Moon during deployment?  Over.<p><b>114:40:19</b> Aldrin: I think that two corners did touch since, when it was deployed, both of them didn't come out at the same time.It unfolded a little unevenly, and of course, the terrain that it was on was a little bit...(was) not quite as level as I would like to have it.And I think that two corners did touch to about 1 inch, no, three-quarters to a half an inch deep;  and maybe along the bottom, it might have been maybe 3 inches, leaving a small triangular coating on two of the corners;and I think these are on the western ones.  Over.<p><b>114:41:06</b> Garriott: Roger.  Understand the description there.  And the next subject, on the two core tubes which you collected, how did the driving force required to collect these tubes compare?  Was there any difference?  Over<p><b><a name=1144127>114:41:27</a></b> Aldrin: Not significantly.  I could get down about the first 2 inches without much of a problem, and then as I would pound it in about as hard as I could do it,and the second one took two hands on the hammer, and I was putting pretty good dents in the top of the extension rod, and it just wouldn't go much more than...I think the total depth might have been about 8 or 9 inches.  But even there, for some reason it didn't seem to want to stand up straight.In other words, I'd keep driving it in and it would dig some sort of a hole but it just wouldn't penetrate in a way that would support it and keep it from falling over, if that makes any sense at all.  It didn't really to me.  Over.<blockquote><i>[Buzz's troubles with the core tubes were caused by the design of the tube.The top few centimeters of the lunar soil - consisting of relatively recent ejecta from craters near and far - can be quite loose and, in anticipation that the soil would be loose to considerable depth, the core tubes were designed with an internal bevel which compacted the soil entering the tube as Buzz hammered it into the ground.However, the in-place soil actually becomes quite compact at only a few inches depth because of shaking induced by countless small impacts.Consequently, once Buzz had pushed the tubes in a short way, he encountered soil which was already at near maximum density and the entrance to the tube quickly became blocked.Other designs - a small diameter tube with an exterior bevel and a large diameter, thin-walled tube with no bevel - worked beautifully on the other missions.]</i></blockquote><b><a name="1144222">RealAudio Clip</a></b>( <a href="a11a1144222.ra" target="new">6 min 38 sec</a> )<p><b>114:42:22</b> Garriott: Roger, Buzz.  I think I've got the picture.  You indicate that (there was) little difference between the two samples and that in each case you got down about 2 inches without any problemsand then had to continue hammering rather vigorously in order to continue driving it in to a total depth of 8 or 9 inches, and even at that point the rods did not want to stay vertical, that they'd tend to fall over on you even after pounding in that far.  Is that correct?<p><b>114:42:59</b> Aldrin: Yeah.  That's about it.  It wasn't a rapid change in resistive force.And, also, I noticed when I took the bit off that the material was quite well packed, a good bit darker, and the way it adhered to the core tube gave me the distinct impression of being moist.  Over.<blockquote><i>[I suggested that by &quot;moist&quot; Buzz might have been referring to the fact that lunar dust clings to almost anything it comes in contact with.] <p>[Aldrin - &quot;That plus maybe a little more perception of the color, because you're looking at particles rather than a surface.  Maybe that makes it look darker.  When it's a surface, maybe the reflection tends to lighten it up, in the Sun.'Moist' was about the best I could grab hold of.&quot;] <p>[Armstrong - &quot;It didn't imply any moisture.  It had to do with the reflective characteristics and, also, maybe the slumping...Actually, I don't think we've mentioned earlier that you could have fairly steep walls.&quot;] <p>[Small trenches dug by later crews would retain virtually vertical walls.] <p>[I asked if the tongs or the scoop retained a coating of dust after they scraped it through the surface] <p>[Armstrong -(After much thought) &quot;I don't remember.  Certainly the boots did.&quot;] <p>[Aldrin - &quot;Yeah, if there's anything that it can grab a hold of, the stuff seems to stay there.&quot;]</i></blockquote><b>114:43:23</b> Garriott: Roger.  Understand the general impression of being moist as it packed in the core tube.  Next question:  we did copy your comments prior to the EVA of your general description of the area.We wonder if either of you would have any more lengthy description or more detailed description of the general summary of the geology of the area.  Over.<p><b>114:44:01</b> Armstrong: Yeah, let's...We'll postpone our answer to that one until tomorrow.  Okay?<blockquote><i>[Neil answers the question at 123:10:32.]</i></blockquote><b>114:44:08</b> Garriott: Yes, indeed.  That'll be fine.<blockquote><i>[Aldrin - &quot;I'm just kind of wondering about that kind of question because, once you've taken panorama pictures,(the question) makes me feel a little inadequate trying to describe something in a subjective way when you've got very objective data.  So, is the question, do you suppose, in case the photos and you don't make it back?  That they want to know what you're subjective description is?&quot;] <p>[Armstrong - &quot;They had TV panoramas.&quot;] <p>[Aldrin - &quot;I feel imposed on, I'll tell ya, by those questions.  I like to be an expert in an area before I get put on the spot.&quot;] <p>[Armstrong - &quot;I don't think there's anything sinister.  (Animated)  I just think those geology guys just couldn't wait to get more detail and just wanted more information!&quot;]</i></blockquote><b>114:44:10</b> Garriott: Just a couple more here, and I think these may not be quite as lengthy as number 7 there.  Can you estimate the stroke of the primary and secondary struts?  Over.<p><b>114:44:31</b> Armstrong: Well, I can do it like this, Owen.  About all the struts are about equally stroked, and the height from the ground to the first step is about 3 feet or maybe 3 and 1/2 feet, huh?<blockquote><i>[I asked if they saw any distinct evidence of stroking.] <p>[Aldrin - &quot;They weren't going to bounce back, I don't think.  Weren't they crushable?&quot;] <p>[Armstrong - &quot;They weren't springs.  They were honeycomb inside and they took a permanent set.  We probably knew what the unstroked length was, but we probably had seen that someplace in time.I think that what I said here was the best way to put it.  We touched so gently that we sure didn't do much.&quot;] <p>[I mentioned that there is a lot of bantering on other missions about possible landing gear stroking and that it's impossible to tell how much is banter and how much is fact.  Neil did not reply.]</i></blockquote><b>114:44:52</b> Garriott: Roger.  Understand, Neil.  Next topic.  Just after landing, you pointed out that there was a hill to the west along the <a href="../alsj-LM-Coord.jpg" title="image" target="new">plus-Z</a> axis from the LM.Are there any large rocks in that direction that might block the solar array (on the seismometer) during the sunset.(That is,) as sunset approaches in your locality, are there any large rocks that might tend to obscure the array?  Over.<p><b>114:45:32</b> Aldrin: No.  I don't believe so.  I think that it's about as level as any other areas that we chose.<p><b>114:45:46</b> Garriott: Roger.  I...<p><b>114:45:47</b> Aldrin: There's nothing large, anyway, that's going to get in the way.<p><b>114:45:50</b> Garriott: Roger.  Copy.  That's also the way it appeared from the television, I think.  And now the final question.You commented, Neil, that on your approach to the landing spot, you had passed over a football-field-sized crater containing rather large blocks of solid rock perhaps 10 to 15 feet in size.Can you estimate the distance to this football(-field)-sized crater from your present position?  Over.<p><b>114:46:25</b> Armstrong: I thought we'd be close enough so that when we got outside we could see it's rim back there;  but I couldn't.  But I don't think we're more than a half mile beyond it.  That is, a half mile west of it.<p><b>114:46:45</b> Garriott: Roger.  So you estimate your present position less than half a mile approximately west of this large crater.  Over.<p><b>114:46:56</b> Armstrong: That's correct.<blockquote><i>[The distance back to West Crater is about 500 meters or about 0.3 miles, rather than 0.5 miles.] <p>[During the following discussion, we were looking at <a href="a11psrf3-3.jpg" title="image" target="new">Figure 3-3</a> from the <a href="a11psr.html" target="new">Preliminary Science Report</a>, a high-resolution mosaic of Lunar Orbiter photos of the site.  Figure <a href="a11mrf5-08.jpg" title="image" target="new">5-8</a> in the Mission Report is a grainier version of the same image.] <p>[Armstrong - &quot;That (West Crater) was a big dude!  See, Buzz could not see it, because he was on the right side.  On the LM, between the right and left crew positions,there's a panel that goes out so that either crew member can only see forward and out his side, but not to the other side.  So we came over the (north side of) big West Crater, which looked enormous, humongous...To me it looked like a football stadium - you know, a circular football stadium - about that size.And he couldn't see it!  (Chuckling)  He couldn't appreciate that at all!  We were coming right into the northeast slopes of it.And there were a lot of big boulders on that slope.  A generally undesirable landing area for the first one.  Geologically interesting, but not a good place to land.&quot;] <p>[I asked if West Crater had been named prior to the mission.] <p>[Armstrong - &quot;I don't think so.  I was considerably west of where we were intending to land, so it wasn't one of the those craters that we'd been looking for in the approach path.&quot;] <p>[Aldrin - &quot;It's east of where we landed, so why did it get the name West Crater?  Who named it West Crater?&quot;] <p>[Armstrong - &quot;I don't know.&quot;] <p>[I noted that the <a href="images11.html#flownLAM2" target="new"> landing ellipse</a> (about 19 km by 5 km) contains perhaps two or three dozen craters bigger than West Crater, although it's one of the largest in the southwest quadrant of the ellipse.] <p>[Armstrong - &quot;You can see from this picture (meaning <a href="a11mrf5-08.gif" title="image" target="new">figure 5-8</a>), it does look like it's a somewhat more sharp-edged crater than this one, which is more weathered.&quot;] <p>[Aldrin - &quot;Now, where's the Cat's Paw?  Wasn't it out in front of us?  'Cause we saw it on lift-off.&quot;] <p>[The Cat's Paw is a cluster of craters directly west of the landing ellipse.  The eastern most point is at L.0/2.0 on the far left on map <a href="images11.html#flownLAM2" target="new">LAM-2</a> and is about 5.6 km from the landing site at about J.65/7.52.  It is also shown in a labeled version of overhead photo AS11-37-<a href="A11LBL5447.jpg" title="image" target="new">5447</a>.  Finally, in the post-landing panorama taken out Buzz's window ( <a href="a11pan5454-58.jpg" title="image" target="new">123k</a> ), the hill on the horizon beyond the tip of the LM shadow and the similarly-sized hill farther to the right are part of the Cat's Paw rim, as can be seen in a <a href="a11det5882-82a.jpg" title="image" target="new">comparison</a> of a detail from 5447 with portions of frames AS11-40-<a href="images11.html#5882" target="new">5882</a> and <a href="images11.html#5882a" target="new">5882a</a> from Buzz's plus-Z pan.  The sector encompassed by the yellow lines in each image is about 25 degrees.  I have not attempted to correlate the 'hills' seen from the landing site with specific features in the overhead view.] <p>[Armstrong - &quot;I don't think we ever knew this one (meaning West Crater) was here.&quot;]<p>[At at <a href="a11.launch.html#1235523" target="new">123:55:23</a>, about a half hour before LM liftoff, Ron Evans tells Mike that the LM is &quot;just west of West Crater, Juliet 0.5, 7.7.  Over.&quot;  This suggests that the crater had been named before the flight; but I am unaware of any pre-flight map that would provide confirmation.]<p>[Finally, we have the following from the Crew Observations chapter of the <a href="a11psr.html" target="new">Apollo 11 Preliminary Science Report</a> - &quot;This crater was later identified as one we had informally called West Crater during our prelaunch training.&quot;]<p></i></blockquote><b>114:46:58</b> Garriott: Okay.  Well, that takes care of the questions from our geologists for tonight, and unless you have something else, that'll be all from us for the evening.  Over.<p><b>114:47:12</b> Armstrong: Okay.  Thank you.<blockquote><i>[Comm Break]</i></blockquote><b>114:49:01</b> Garriott: Tranquility Base, Houston.

Will you verify that the disk with messages was placed on the surface as planned, and also that the items listed in the flight plan - all of those listed there - were jettisoned.  Over.<p><b>114:52:48</b> Armstrong: All that's verified.<p><b>114:52:51</b> Garriott: Roger.  Thank you, and I hope this will be a final good night.<p><b>114:52:57</b> Armstrong: Okay.<blockquote><i>[Armstrong - &quot;I think what he (Garriott) was referring to was the silicon disks that had the replicas of all the messages to the United States from various world leaders.&quot;]<p>[Aldrin - &quot;That was in the packet.&quot;] <p>[At 115.50, Public Affairs reports that the Surgeon doesn't believe that Neil is closer to sleep than &quot;dozing&quot;.  Buzz is not being monitored.  In orbit, Collins is sound asleep.  At 119.50, Public Affairs reports that Neil has not been sleeping.  His heart rate occasionally drops into the 50s - the &quot;sleep range&quot; - but does not stay low.] <p>[I asked if there were any comments they wanted to make about the sleep period.] <p>[Armstrong - &quot;We had one pump...&quot;] <p>[Aldrin - &quot;I don't remember being troubled too much by the noise.&quot;] <p>[Armstrong - &quot;I think it was my position (that) was bothered by the noise more than yours, because you were on the floor - right? - and I was on the engine cover with a loop that'd I rigged up of some kind to hold my legs, hanging from something up there.And my head was back to the rear of the cabin and there was a glycol pump or a water pump or something very close to where my head was.But the temperature control was probably the most troublesome.&quot;] <p>[I speculated that the back of the cabin was small enough that Neil's legs would have hung over the front, then we found Buzz's statement at <a href="a11.launch.html#1214102" target="new">121:41:02</a> indicating that Neil had used one of the <a href="../restraints.jpg" title="image" target="new">waist tethers</a> to keep his legs suspended.] <p>[Armstrong - &quot;Yeah, I suspended them.  I rigged up a loop to hold my legs.  And the other thing was (that) the Earth was coming through the AOT (Alignment Optical Telescope).  (Chuckling)  We had blinds over the windows and so on, but the Earth was coming through the AOT.  We were all settled down and we realized that we still had a light source coming from something.

It seems a little hokey for a nation to be sending people to the Moon...&quot;] <p>[The following is a section of the Technical Debrief subtitled 'General Lunar Surface Fatigue'.] <p>[Armstrong, from the 1969 Technical Debrief - &quot;I wasn't tired at all.  I worked real hard at a high workload right there near the conclusion (of the EVA) when I was pulling the rock boxes up.We knew that was going to be hard, plus the fact that we were racing around a little bit towards the end, trying to get everything thrown into boxes and getting all the pieces put together.I expect my heart rate ran up pretty good right there (it peaked just below 160 beats per minute), but I had a lot of energy and reserve at that point, because we had been sort of taking it easy all through the EVA.&quot;] <p>[Prior to the final burst of activity, neither Neil nor Buzz had a workload comparable with those regularly undertaken by later crews.  The purpose of the Apollo 11 EVA was to demonstrate that useful work could be done and grab a few samples; but, with the landing accomplished, their main job was to get home safely and there was no point in pushing limits and risking fatigue for the all-important launch and rendezvous.] <p>[Armstrong, from the 1969 Technical Debrief - &quot;Everything was, with a few exceptions, accomplished with a comfortable workload.We didn't have to work hard throughout the whole timeline, and I knew I could afford to race around there for 5 or 10 minutes without jeopardizing the operation at all.They called for a status check (a veiled request that he slow down) and I gave them one and we proceeded, but there wasn't a problem with respect to available energy and reserve.&quot;] <p>[Aldrin, from the 1969 Technical Debrief - &quot;I think that the fact that you're well cooled off enables you to absorb a fair amount in an increase of activity before it manifests itself.The oxygen flow rate concerned me a little bit pre-flight because I found, in doing some fairly strenuous exercise in the thermal vacuum chamber, that the first indication I got was that there was not quite enough circulation of oxygen to breathe.It tended to get a little stuffy in the helmet.  (Here, Buzz changes the subject to the workload involved in launch and rendezvous)I think all of us who have been through this business (in the simulators) know a good bit about the pace of activities following insertion (into lunar orbit),which is rather leisurely taken.  However, you can get wrapped around the axle doing a lot of different things that aren't required (in a normal launch and rendezvous) - many of them are doing things just to say you can add more and more solutions.Therefore, to carry out a minimum-rendezvous effort is not, as I would see it, a very tiring task to look forward to after descent and a prolonged EVA.I think we would have been fully capable of carrying out a lift-off and rendezvous (right after the EVA, had one been required).&quot;] <p>[Armstrong, from the 1969 Technical Debrief - &quot;We handled one.&quot;] <p>[Aldrin, from the 1969 Technical Debrief - &quot;You just are not going to get any sleep while you're waiting for it to be completed, but you're certainly not going to be completely bushed chasing yourself around the cockpit.  With the automatic radar, lift-off and rendezvous are fairly leisurely exercises.  I guess I'd have more concern about Mike's ability to continue, because he's quite active moving back and forth and doing a lot of manual tasks with the sextant that we didn't have to do.&quot;] <p>[<a name"RestComments">Armstrong, from the 1969 Technical Debrief</a> - &quot;We cleaned up the cockpit and got things pretty well in shape.  This took us a while, and we planned to sleep with our helmets and gloves on for a couple of reasons.  One is that it's a lot quieter with your helmets and gloves on, and then we wouldn't have any mental concern about the ECS and so on having two loops working for us there.&quot;] <p>[Aldrin, from the 1969 Technical Debrief - &quot;We wouldn't be breathing all that dust.&quot;] <p>[Armstrong, from the 1969 Technical Debrief - &quot;That was another concern.  Our cockpit was so dirty with soot, that we thought the suit loop (filtered oxygen going directly from the ECS to the suit and then back again) would be a lot cleaner.&quot;] <p>[Aldrin, from the 1969 Technical Debrief - &quot;I guess the question is:  can you keep it cleaner?  I guess you could keep it a little cleaner, but there are so many things going in and out that it's almost impossible to avoid getting a significant amount of lunar material in there.&quot;] <p>[The Apollo 12 crew had an even worse problem with dust and, for the remaining missions, the solutions that seemed to help were (1) dusting each other off as thoroughly as possible with a house-paint-sized brush before going up the ladder;  (2) stomping their feet on the ladder to get more dust off the boots and lower legs; and (3) putting the suit legs into spare <a href="../alsj-JettBag.html" target="new">jettison bags</a> between the EVAs.] <p>[Armstrong, from the 1969 Technical Debrief - &quot;A couple of comments with respect to going to sleep in the LM.  One is that it's noisy; and two is that it's illuminated.We had the window shades up (that is, covering the windows) and light came through those window shades like crazy.  They're like (photographic) negatives and a lot of light will shine through.&quot;] <p>[Aldrin, from the 1969 Technical Debrief - &quot;You can't see what's going on outside, but you can come quite close to it.&quot;] <p>[Armstrong, from the 1969 Technical Debrief - &quot;For example, you can see the horizon out there through the window shades.  There's that much light that comes through.&quot;] <p>[There is no discussion of the window shades in the Apollo 11 Mission Report.  However, the fact that none of the other crews reported problems with light coming in suggests that the shade design was modified to use a more opaque material.] <p>[Armstrong, from the 1969 Technical Debrief - &quot;The next thing is that there are several warning lights that are very bright and can't be dimmed.  The next thing is that there are all those radioactive illuminated display switches in there. Third, after I got into my sleep stage and all settled down, I realized that there was something else shining in my eye.  It turned out to be that the Earth was shining through the AOT (Alignment Optical Telescope) right into my eye.It was just like a light bulb.  If I had thought of that ahead of time, we could have put the Sun filter on or something that would have cut that light out.The next problem we had was temperature.  We were very comfortable when we completed our activities and were bedded down.Buzz was on the floor and I was on the ascent engine cover.  We were reasonably comfortable in term of temperature.We had the (LM cooling) water flowing and the suit (oxygen) loop running.  We had to have the suit loop running because our helmets were closed.After a while, I started to get awfully cold, so I reached in front of the fan and turned the water temperature to full up - Max increase.  It still got colder and colder.Finally, Buzz suggested that we disconnect the water, which I did.I still got colder.  Then, I guess, Buzz changed the temperature of the air flow in the suit.&quot;] <p>[The cabin temperature through the rest period was in the range of 61 to 62 degrees Fahrenheit or about 16 degrees Celsius.] <p>[Aldrin, from the 1969 Technical Debrief - &quot;Yes.  We fell victim to a time constant.  Once we noticed it going bad, there wasn't anything we could do about it.In addition, because we were trying to minimize our activities and stay in some state of drowsiness, we didn't want to get up and start stirring around, because it would be that much harder to get back to that same state again.  So we tried to minimize our activity.  We underestimated how much light was coming in through the windows.  There must have been a significant amount of light and heat coming in and just being reflected off the surface.We had no feel for what gas-flow setting we should have had, because we'd been on the cooling all the time up to that point while moving around I'm not sure that there's much control over that anyway.  We finally disconnected the oxygen flow.&quot;] <p>[Armstrong, from the 1969 Technical Debrief - &quot;But that requires that you take your helmet off, so that you can breathe when you turn the suit disconnects (that is, shut off the flow from the ECS into the suits). This means that it gets noisy again, and all you hear is a glycol pump and stuff like that. This was a never-ending battle to obtain just a minimum level of sleeping conditions, and we never did.  Even if we would have, I'm not sure I would have gone to sleep.&quot;] <p>[Aldrin, from the 1969 Technical Debrief - &quot;I don't know who was on Biomed at the time (it was Neil), but I feel that I did get a couple of hours maybe mentally fitful drowsing.  I'll have to say that I think I had the better sleeping place.  I found that it was relatively comfortable on the floor, either on my back with feet up against the side, or with my knees bent (and his feet on the floor, the cabin width being insufficient for him to stretch out).  Also, I could roll over on one side or the other.  I had the two OPSs stacked up at the front of the hatch, so there was ample room on the floor for one.  But there wasn't room for two.&quot;] <p>[Aldrin, from the 1969 Technical Debrief - &quot;To cut down on the light level, we're just going to have to do something with the window shades to make them more effective.  I think sleeping with the helmet on will keep the cooling down and is probably a good, reasonable way to go as long as you're going to keep the suit on.Unless some change is made, we'd never even think about taking the suits off.&quot;] <p>[Collins, from the 1969 Technical Debrief - &quot;Apollo 12 is planning to take their suits off.  With the longer stay-time and a couple of EVAs, they're planning to take their suits off.&quot;] <p>[Aldrin, from the 1969 Technical Debrief - &quot;I think they ought to think a little more about it.  I don't know what the temperature would be in there.I got the impression that it was a lot cooler outside the suit than it would have been inside.  I don't feel that having the suit on in one-sixth g is that much of a bother.It's fairly comfortable.  You have your own little snug sleeping bag, unless you have some pressure point somewhere.  Your head in the helmet (which has a pad at the back of the head) assumes a very comfortable position.Even out of the helmet, you don't have to worry about what you're leaning against.  Your head doesn't weigh that much, and will very comfortably pick just about any position.  I just don't see the real need for taking the helmets off.&quot;] <p>[Armstrong, from the 1969 Technical Debrief - &quot;I didn't mind sleeping on the engine cover.  I didn't find it that bad.  I made a hammock out of a waist tether - which I attached to some structure handholds - to hold my feet up in the air and in the middle of the cockpit.This kept my feet up about level with or a little higher than my torso.&quot;] <p>[Aldrin, from the 1969 Technical Debrief - &quot;Well, you were back out of the mainstream of the light, except for the AOT.  I think we could fix that up and obtain a more horizontal position or the capability to roll from one side to the other.That's just something that has to be worked out.  It wasn't satisfactory.  If we had known then what we know now, we could have preconditioned the cabin a little bit better (in terms of temperature).  We needed to start at a warmer level by turning the water off, thereby storing a small amount of heat.&quot;] <p>[Armstrong, from the 1969 Technical Debrief - &quot;That's just one of those areas that didn't occur to us.  It clearly needs some more work.&quot;] <p>[Ultimately, the Apollo 12 crew decided not to take their suits off between the two EVAs.  However, they took their helmets off, kept the flow of cooling water off, and strung up <a href="../a12/a12.hammocks.jpg" title="image" target="new">hammocks</a> to sleep in.They did not report any problems with noise, excess light, or cold temperatures keeping them from sleep.  Neither of them slept more than three hours, but the brief sleep was due to a poor fit of Pete Conrad's suit that was causing him sufficient discomfort that he and Al Bean had to get up early and fix it. The Apollo 14 crew had the same sort of arrangements as the 12 crew but found that they had trouble getting their heads into comfortable positions, perhaps because of the rigid neckrings. In addition, their spacecraft had landed with a significant tilt and, when they were in a drowzy state, the tilt produced a sensation that the LM was about to tip over.  That sensation kept them both awake. Starting with Apollo 15, the astronauts got out of their suits after each EVA and it made a world of difference. They were able to get comfortable in the hammocks and, on the whole, they slept soundly.  Some of them felt more excitement about the situation than the others did and had trouble falling asleep but, all of them slept soundly for at least a few hours each rest period, and woke up refreshed and ready to go back to work. Neil and Buzz and the other early crews demonstrated the obvious - that it was possible to accomplish a great deal with limited rest.  And the later crews demonstrated that simple additions to the equipment list - and confidence in the suit that let them take it off and put it back on three times - made it possible to get adequate rest at a small cost.]</i></blockquote><hr><CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="90%" ><TR align=center><TD><A HREF="../frame.html" target="_parent">Journal Home Page</A> </TD><TD><A HREF="a11j.html">Apollo 11 Journal Index</A> </TD><TD><a href="a11.launch.html"> The Return to Orbit </a></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><!--  508 TEAM 2001  --></body></html>
