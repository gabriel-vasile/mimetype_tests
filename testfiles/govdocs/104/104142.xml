		   <p>I was born March 9, 1923 in Northern Maine and grew up in a town called Madawaska. I am a descendant of French immigrants who settled in Acadia (Nova Scotia) and Quebec. When I was drafted in March 1943 I had been working as a radio technician at Wright Patterson Air Base Ohio. We were installing IFF (Identification-Friend or Foe) radar equipment on A-20 Boston Bombers and one certain converted B-24 Bomber. This was not a normal B-24 because it was furnished with overstuffed chairs and a bed. We later learned that this B-24 had flown President Roosevelt to Casablanca to meet with Winston Churchill and General DeGaule.</p>
		   <p>I trained at Fort Monmouth, NJ. On some very new communication equipment called Radio Relay. I rose to the rank of T Sgt. In charge of a five man team trained to provide Radio Relay communications for Army commanders during WWII. We made up the 980th Signal Service Company; a unit of some 200 men, consisting of telephone and radio technicians. My team consisted ofthe following:</p>
		   <p>Billy Crow Marion, LA. He had been a teacher</p>
<p>Joe Barnes Smyrna, GA</p>
<p>Bob Eller Smithfield, TN. Very quiet. "YEP" was a whole paragraph Bob Sanakov Brooklyn, NY He was the youngest</p>
<p>Henry Wright, Kentucky, We called him "Stump jumper"</p>
		   <p>Our equipment was designed to bridge the communications gap between military units without their having to lay miles and miles of wire. Army commanders simply needed to run a telephone cable from their headquarters a few miles to our installation and we would establish telephone communications with minutes of receiving the cable. Our radio equipment operated on high frequencies and required our antennas to be on whatever high ground was available nearby.</p>
		<p>One morning at 6 AM after an all night exercise in the New Jersey snow and only two hours sleep, we were called out in formation. The Company Commander wanted to tell us that we had performed well during the night but at one installation he had found that "Someone had peed in the snow" . We felt that the captain had not exercised good judgment here and so the next day we all marched down to the IG's office and in a week we had a new captain.  While at Ft. Monmouth, I met and married Anna Patricia Monahan but it was not long before I had to move out with my company.</p>
		   <p>Following our training at Fort Monmouth, NJ, we traveled 13 days by ship convoy to England in May 1944 where we were settled in a field near Tidworth in the south of England. A couple of weeks later we saw flight upon flight of aircraft flying overhead and we assumed that the invasion for France was on. Someone came up with a portable radio and the BBC confIrmed it for us.</p>
				<p>It was about three weeks later that our company got its orders to move out. Meanwhile we were put to work "waterproofIng" our trucks and other vehicles in the event we would have to disembark in a few feet of water to get to the beach. At Portsmouth we loaded our vehicles on a Landing Ship Tank (LST) and traveled in a small convoy to Utah Beach in Normandy. The trip was uneventful except for a couple of "Buzz Bombs" overhead but we were told that they are not a danger to us as long as they are noisy---and they kept on going. We landed very dry on Utah Beach and in a pull-aside area designed for this, we stripped the waterproofIng off our vehicles.</p>
				<p>We were assigned an apple orchard near the town of Carentan and parked our half ton trucks with all our team's equipment under the trees to provide natural camouflage. We then proceeded to dig our two man foxholes and pitch our pup tent over them. The Ninth Tactical Air Corps had a landing strip with P-47s a couple of miles away and at night we were "entertained" by watching the ack-ack shells exploding above as the German Luftwaffe tried to knock out the airstrip and the planes. One of those nights the ack-ack was successful in knocking out a German two engine Junger bomber. Through the open end of my pup tent I saw this big ball of fIre coming straight down toward us and I said a quick prayer that it would continue on past us and it did. It crashed in a fIeld If4 mile away and then all was quiet. The next morning as I was cleaning up our foxhole I noticed a hole in my pup tent at the head end. Inside I found a jagged piece of ack-ack shrapnel roughly two inches in all three dimensions. It had landed about 6 inches from where my head had been! Apparently it was not my time.</p>
			<p>One quiet night as I was Sgt. Of The Guard we heard a lot of noise across the small road from our company area. It was obvious to me that another unit was moving in that other fIeld and after an hour or so everything became quiet once again. Then all of a sudden gunshots were heard and bullets came whizzing by overhead. My guards and I hit the deck and we heard a voice say [stuttering], "e, e, e, e Is t.t.thaat y,y,ou, Willie?" I hollered over, "One more shot and we'll fIre back!" All became quiet again.  The next morning we learned that a company of Negro soldiers had moved in across the street. That was before the services were integrated and all soldiers were black and all their officers were white.</p>
				<p>The American sector of the Normandy front was stymied near the key city of St. Lo only 9 miles from our location. One July morning while we were in line for breakfast, American bombers came over our heads. Then came fIghter planes and more bombers. It was like D Day all over again. They were still coming over when we were at lunch. We could feel the ground shaking when they dropped their bombs. Unfortunately some of their bombs also fell on US troops by accident. Sadly, we also saw a few of those big bombers get hit and plummet down to earth. That was the start of the breakthrough for the US First Army.</p>
				<p>About the last week of July an American civilian drove into our compound. He turned out to be one of two civilian engineers from Fort Monmouth, NJ where our very specialized equipment had been developed. He said he was very happy to find us because we had been scheduled to operate our communication systems across the channel for the invasion but nobody knew where we were! The two engineers operated the systems during and after D Day, he said.</p>
				<p>He asked for and obtained permission to take a team and much equipment to go with him to an undisclosed location. Our Captain decided that my team would be IT and we followed this man on a road west.</p>
				<p>We arrived at a place that our civilian decided would be the place for our main installation. Then, acting in complete command, he told me to set up the main station and keep one man with me to operate it. Then he assigned a different area for each one of the other team members and led them to those locations. He had talked our captain out of enough equipment to set up four more installations and he set it up so that each installation would have one technician and a few Infantrymen to help and provide security. Then he gave me and the other four technicians what frequencies we would be operating on. I have to admit I had not the slightest idea what the heck was going on.</p>
		   <p>I kept Bobby Sanakof with me. He was the youngest team member at 18, from Brooklyn NY and who had obviously led a sheltered life. As the "Old Man" of 21 I decided to take him under my wing. After the others left with our head civilian Bobby and I set up our station and we connected the telephone cable that was delivered to us. Then we dug our foxhole as we had done earlier and pitched our pup tent over it. Our hole was 18-24 inches deep by 6 feet and 3 feet wide. All the time we were doing this we notice that there were other troops across the fence from us and they were all laughing at us for digging in. They had no foxholes.</p>
		   <p>Later that night we were awakened by a lot of clatter on the road across the field from us. We tried to go back to sleep but were startled again by a lot of loud noises that we identified as tracked vehicles, airplanes, bombs and ack-ack. Looking out from our pup tent opening I saw our two antenna masts swaying back and forth from the bombs being dropped by the German bombers. Fortunately the antennas stayed up thanks to the well positioned guy wires we had installed</p>
			<p>All of a sudden the noise stopped and we tried to go back to sleep. It wasn't easy because all the troops across the fence from us were noisily digging foxholes for themselves!  We later learned that these troops were a Headquarters Company of some sort and that we were just south of the Cherbourg Peninsula.</p>
			<p>The next morning we found two dead horses at the other side of the field from us and according to the scuttlebutt we learned that French General LeClerc's Second Armored Division units were the ones traveling down that road and Gerry got wind of it somehow.</p>
			<p>Later that morning I heard a voice coming over our clear channel. I recognized it as the voice of Billy Crow. He could not tell me where he was but when I told him I could barely hear him I asked him how many mast sections he had up he said, "One". I started to chew him out for having only one 5 foot mast section up but he told me, "OK but it might get shot down". I learned later that he was on the Brest peninsula and his antenna was peaking over a hill and the Germans were on the other side. I also learned later that he had been assigned to a Combat Command (several tanks, half tracks and supporting vehicles) and that they had gone as far as the Brest Peninsula!</p>
			<p>The big news also was that we were all part of and advanced thrust by the US Third Army commanded by Major General George S. Patton!  WE WERE PART OF BLOOD 'N GUTS'S ARMY!!  Then it started. We heard many, many tanks and other vehicles traveling down the road to the west of us. Then I was told by a Master Sgt. in the Chief Signal Officer's tent to knock down our station and move to a given new location. He asked me where I wanted to set up our installation in that area. (We needed to be on high ground and I had topical maps available.) I gave him an answer and we tore down the station, loaded it on the truck and got in line down the Avaranche Gap.</p>
			<p>I found out that I was attached to Third Army HQ and my men were scattered at Corps, Division and Combat Commands. As we traveled down the western coast of Normandy I saw my first dead enemy. He was a very young boy in a Whermach [sic.] uniform and he was draped over the turret of a Panzer tank that had been knocked out. He could not have been as old as I was (21). I could not help thinking what his mother would think if she saw him there, dead.  We moved fairly frequently and the phone calls came telling me where the next HQ was to be. As the need arose, more manpower and equipment was provided to me so that I could cover all the demands that were placed on me for communications.</p>
			<p>Soon we were near LeMans and things slowed down. From the situation map that I got to see from time to time at HQ, our advance units were now engaged at the Falaise Gap where a large number of German units were caught between us and the advancing First US Army units from the north. Tens of thousands of the enemy were killed, wounded and captured at Falaise. I later learned that during this battle near LeMans a close friend and neighbor of mine from Madawaska, Maine was killed when his P-47 was shot down. His name was Onias Martin.</p>
			<p>Our station in this area was very close to the Third Army HQ and security was not a problem so I decided to go to church one Sunday morning. The small village nearby had a small Catholic Church that probably dated back to the 16th century. I attended Mass and received communion. However, after Mass I decided that I wanted to talk to the priest and I stayed behind. We met out in the courtyard and this young priest was so overcome to see a real live American soldier who was not only a Catholic but he also spoke French! He became very excited and told me to wait there and not go away. A few minutes later he came up with a dark bottle that he called "Calvados". Not being familiar with "Adult Beverages" at that time I thanked him and took the bottle back to the station. This bottle had obviously survived the German occupation and therefore had to be very precious.</p>
			<p>I left that bottle at the site and since we were close to Army HQ and security was not a problem I decided that as many as possible should have a good hot meal. I got a volunteer to stay at the station and the rest of us went down and enjoyed our fIrst hot meal in a few weeks. Upon our return we found our volunteer flat on the ground totally passed out. The contents of the bottle was down only about 2 inches.. I had our friend taken to a cold spring at the other end of the field and the guys were successful in reviving him so he could get a good night's sleep.</p>
			<p>The next morning I received a call to send another team to a Combat Command. I guess I felt that the one who would cause me the least embarrassment in the future was the one who over enjoyed the Calvados so I elected him to go with the Combat Command. He stayed with this outfit all through the campaign, and on VE Day he was in Pilsen, Czechoslovakia.</p>
			<p>Once the Falaise Gap battle was finished and we had captured many German soldiers the way was cleared for Third Army. We were in position to take advantage of the soft underbelly of the German forces in France and so we traveled at speeds never before experienced in any war at any time. It was not long before I had stations at Lucky (Third Army Code Name) Rear, Lucky, and Lucky Forward. Within a day or so I would move Lucky Rear and leapfrog it to Lucky forward 50 or more miles away. I soon learned that when the Chief Signal Officer called and told me, "Cut your communications to the rear" it meant two things; 1. Patton was telling Bradley and Ike, "Don't call me; I'll call you...later."  2. Then I had to tear down Lucky Rear and leapfrog it ahead of Lucky Forward.</p>
			<p>The powers that be decided that this successful communications outfIt needed an officer to head it and so they assigned a 2nd Lt. to guide us into the future. Enter Lt. McDermott from Pennsylvania. He was a telephone man and he admitted that he knew nothing about the radio end of this business. He just told me to go on doing what I was doing. He gave me a free reign.</p>
			<p>At one stage I worked 36 hours non-stop moving stations, assigning new operating frequencies, relocation move instructions and delivering gasoline, mail and food to the troops. It was a very exciting time for a 21 year old boy from Aroostook County in Maine. By this time I was a Technical Sgt. instead of a T. Sgt. We stopped finally at Verdun. I was exhausted. I had eaten only K Rations during this time and I was hungry. Lt. McDermott and I sat down it an old WWI shell crater, started a fire and opened up a Ten-In-One ration box. A Ten-In-One ration is meant to be three meals for ten men for one day. We cooked the breakfast and ate that. Then we cooked the lunch and ate most of that. By this time we were completely full and could not eat any more. We laid back and took a much needed nap. Some time later I felt a tug at my shoulder. I looked up to see a small boy and with him was his mother and two small girls. My guys had sent her to me because they could not understand her French and they knew that I could. They were a...</p>
			<p>[gap in text]</p>
			<p>course, but when the mother handed me a cherry pie she had made for us I had to fake happiness. I was so full I did not think I could swallow one more piece of food. However, knowing something of the culture of France, I knew that I had to have a piece of that pie right away and act as if it was the best pie I had ever eaten. That I did and the woman was very happy. What was left of our lOin 1 ration box was the supper meal that consisted of large cans of English beef stew which none of us ever liked. I gave her all these and a few more items of food. She was so very happy to get all these things. I thought she would never stop telling me, "Merci, merci beaucoups." She asked me if we had any laundry that she would be happy to do that for us. We gave her a few items and she went home happy. She pointed out her house down the hill and said that if ever the Germans came back she would hang a sheet out of her window as a warning to us.</p>
			<p>We were close to the Army HQ in Verdun but then the situation changed. All of a sudden we were running short on gasoline and the tank guys were complaining that they needed more fuel for their tanks. We still had to maintain communications so we drained the gasoline tanks on our trucks to keep the generators going. I could not help thinking that if we had been subjected to a counterattack by the Germans we would be running west with all our might.</p>
			<p>So what was that all about? It seems from history that British General Bernard Montgomery (with some pressure from Churchill) had talked Ike into a paratroop drop into Arnheim, Holland and all the "petrol" Monty needed was diverted to him. Of course this served Monty well because it took the public attention away from Patton and diverted it to Monty. There was only one big problem with that. The raid on Arnheim was ill planned, ill executed and was a complete disaster. A large number of Aussie, New Zealander and American boys were lost. I believe that had we not been stopped at this point we could have been in Berlin by the end of September or early October.</p> 
			<p>Instead our HQ was deployed into a holding pattern in Nancy, a few miles south. We were put into much better quarters than we had seen thus far. We were in what had been a school or other public building and our installation operated on a large generator that supplied the entire Third Army HQ. Our work was minimal. And we enjoyed ourselves. I even took the time to go to a public bath and take a very welcome, warm, soapy beeeautiful bath; my first since Normandy, and here it was September.</p>
			<p>To the northeast of Nancy was a mountain with a giant cave. The Germans had installed inside the cave a large 240 mm canon on rails. At night they would roll this artillery piece to the mouth of the cave and lob shots into Nancy. Their accuracy was not that good so we did not worry about it. We adopted a fatalistic attitude and went about our activities as if that gun was never there. They never hit anything close to us but one night they did knock off the comer of second story of a house that was being used by General Patton as his living quarters. He was not in the building at the time and the shell turned out to be a dud and did not explode. The damage was minimal. The Air Force (new name by this time) tried to knock out that cave but was not successful.</p>
			<p>Someone in the Chief Signal Officer's office decided that I deserved a 3 day pass and arranged for me to ride the mail truck to Paris. It came as a complete surprise to me but there was no way I was going to refuse it, so off I went. The trip to Paris took over 6 hours and I arrived I learned that there was a USO setup where I could get a room and a meal. I got a night's sleep and the next morning I walked around seeing the sights. I knew that some of my 980th Signal Service Company buddies had an installation on top ofthe Eiffel tower so I decided to go see them. I operated the electrical elevator all the way to the top were those guys surprised to see me! They were attached to Ike's Supreme Headquartes Allied Expeditionary Forces (SHAEF). The view from the top of the tower is really great. One can see all around the city of Paris and almost to the Normandy beach.  I walked all over the city, sightseeing and that night I went to the Follies Bergere. When the show started I was surprised to see an entire chorus line of beautiful young women who were completely bare bosomed!  I had to live over 21 years before I would see this spectacle. After another good night's sleep at the USO it was time to get in the mail truck again and head back to Nancy.</p>
			<p>After several weeks (I did not carry a calendar) I was told that Lucky Forward would move to a location past Metz and close to the German border. The name of the town is St. AvoId. I selected a hill a few miles from the HQ site and with whatever crew I had left, set up my station and waited. Later that night we still had not received our cable from HQ and I was patiently wandering around the area when all of a sudden the sky to the north of us lit up like the Fourth of July. I guessed that it was about 50-80 miles away and I thought, "Well, Our 'Fly Boys' have hit another German ammo dump". More patient waiting and then, quite a while later, a voice came over our clear channel. It was Lt. McDermott with orders to knock down my station and meet him at xxyy location. I questioned him about why the change in plans but the more I questioned the more irritated he became with me so I decided to follow orders. It was the fIrst direct order I received from him after all this time. Up until then I had called all the shots.</p>
			<p>So with little light to work by we knocked down the station, loaded it in the truck and took off, driving with only "cats eyes" instead of headlights. We arrived at our rendezvous early the next morning and that is when I learned that the Germans had counterattacked north of Luxembourg and our Third Army was heading there. Patton's favorite 4th Armored Division had the right of way on the highway north and we were to follow immediately behind. It was the beginning of our part ofthe Battle Of The Bulge. I learned later that it was December 16,1944.</p>
			<p>My crew and I caught a few winks and when it was time we followed in convoy all the way to Luxembourg. Upon arrival there we were informed that there might be German paratroopers dressed in American Army uniforms dropping in on us. We were given the password for the night and proceeded to set up our stations. I now had the men and equipment that had been in Nancy with me. One crew went to a small town just over the border into Belgium. That was the 4th Armored's base. Then I had units at other Corps and Division HQ's. The cable from Lucky came quickly that night and we established communications all around and posted guard for the night. If we encountered any unrecognized "GI" we were ready to query him, not only with the password but also with, "Who is the catcher for the New York Yankees? Who is the shortstop?" "Who won the National League Pennant this year?" We were sure the German soldiers would not know the answers to those questions.</p>
			<p>Our stay in Luxembourg was uneventful for us but when the weather cleared, the Air Force was able to help defend Bastonge while the 4th Armored Division, with support from one of my units for communications, rescued that beleaguered town. That was the beginning ofthe end of The Battle Ofthe Bulge. The German army, the Whermach had expended most of its remaining resources in one desperate, dying thrust ordered by Herr Hitler himself it is very doubtful that they could have engaged in that battle had General Patton not been stopped at Verdun and Nancy and many American lives would have been saved.  While in Luxembourg Lt. McDermott was awarded the Bronze Medal. I felt it was not deserved but military officers take care oftheir own.</p>
			<p>Early in January we received orders to start moving again. As we crossed into Germany to the city of Trier no more did we see smiling faces greeting us. We now were the invading enemy and the expression on the faces ofthe populace made us know it. We felt no ill feelings against the civil populace but they did not reciprocate toward us.  We crossed the Rhine River on a Pontoon bridge near Oppenheim, a town just North of Frankfort. Lucky HQ was to be situated in Frankfort so I selected a high mountain, not too far away for our installation site. After giving the location to the office ofthe Chief Signal Officer I set off with my crew to our location. On the way we passed through a small village but there was not a human being to be seen.</p>
			<p>After setting up our radio network we settled down to wait for the cable to reach us. I posted guards and we took turns getting some shuteye. Surprisingly by morning we still did not have a cable. Then we heard an armored vehicle come up the road. The officer in charge was completely dumfounded when he saw us and our equipment at this site. He explained that they had just captured a group ofSS officers and soldiers in that village below. That explained why our cable crew had not been able to get by. I guess the Germans viewed us as too small a unit for them to risk disclosure of their position so they let us go by unharmed. Whatever, soon we had our cable and we were in business again. With this high elevation we were able to communicate over quite long distances.</p>
			<p>It took us a week or so to bring in some outlying stations and consolidating our network but then we were off and running once again. This time we were on a straight path for Berlin. Traveling was swift because we were using the German Autobahn. That was the fIrst freeway we had seen and it made traveling so much more comfortable. It was also great to see as we were traveling East, entire battalions of unarmed German soldiers were marching in formation in the opposite direction. Rather than face the Russian army at the eastern front they preferred to surrender to the Americans.</p>
			<p>It wasn't long before I was told that the next site for Lucky HQ would be the town of Weimar. I remembered that town from my high school history books as the capital of the German republic after Germany's surrender in WWI. When we arrived at our hilltop near Weimar were happy to see that it had a monumental tower honoring Otto Von Bismark on it. What it meant to us was that we did not have to erect our antenna masts. We simply hung our antennas on the tower and we were in business in no time at all.</p>
			<p>I had picked up a small radio along the way and that night we turned it on to Armed Forces Radio. We got in at the middle of a program and heard a English man describing the scene of what appeared to be a prison. He described naked bodies in piles and a row of crematoriums and we assumed that the scene had to be somewhere in the Pacific Theater because we felt that only the Japanese could mistreat human beings that badly.</p>
			<p>The next morning after we had received our cable and communications was established I decided to scout around the area. About 1000 feet away from our installation I came across a compound next to a large building. There were piles of German rifles and other military supplies in the courtyard and an area to one side contained in a barbed wire fence. Not realizing what I had found I went inside building and talked to a Major at a desk. He told me that this was Buchenwald, a German concentration camp. He pointed to a table containing several devices that appeared to be torture tools. He also directed me to a lamp on the table and told me that the lampshade had been made from the skin of a man's back. I had heard about that lamp on our radio. Ilsa Koch, the camp commander's wife had it made especially for her. I had to touch that lampshade to convince myself that I was not having a bad dream. For this and other atrocities she was known to have caused, Ilsa was later named, "The Bitch of Buchenwald."</p>
			<p>I asked the Major if I could be allowed to tour the inside ofthe fenced camp and he said I could but he appeared quizzical as to why anyone would want to.  The barbed wire gate was open and as I went in I was greeted by a short English-speaking gentleman who turned out to be the gentleman we had heard on the radio the night before! I never did understand why he was in that place. With him was a man who spoke no English. He was a Russian pilot who had been shot down over Germany. As I looked around I could not help noticing that these two men were the only ones who were well fed. I asked to look around and the British gentleman offered to be my guide. The few walking people I saw were nothing but cadavers. Their ribs and knees were bulging out from the lack of flesh covering them. Their sleeping quarters consisted of wooden shelves about 18 inches apart onto which they crawled to sleep. There was no padding and the shelves went from floor to the 7 foot ceiling, every 18 inches. Some of the people had light blankets. This was the barracks for the men and I was told there was another smaller one for women.</p>
			<p>Around the comer was a bank of three incinerators some of which still had skull and rib bones inside. The most revolting scene was close to these incinerators. It was a farm wagon that was loaded with naked male emaciated bodies piled like four foot cordwood; a layer of four in one direction and the next 90 degrees in the other direction. Some but not all of these bodies had holes in the skull apparently from a bullet. I then visited the latrine building but not for long. The stench was so strong I came very close to vomiting.  I went back to our installation and told the guys what I had seen. I picked up my camera and a few chocolate bars from our K-rations and ask-edthem if some of them wanted to come to see what I had seen. I got no takers.</p>
			<p>Inside the fenced area once again I looked around for someone to give the chocolate bar to. I found one man sitting down next to a building sunning himself He was emaciated just like the corpses I had seen. He wore short black pants and a Whermach jacket and when I gave him the candy he said, "Danke". As I walked away I turned around with my camera to see if he was enjoying the chocolate bar. Instead I saw him put it in the breast pocket of his jacket and I took his picture. I learned later what he already knew; that his system was so unaccustomed to solid food he could not have eaten that candy if he wanted to. They had to feed those prisoners broth and gruel for about three months before they could digest solid food. Years later my son David named that picture, "The Chocolate Soldier".  I had nightmares about Buchenwald for six months after I was discharged.</p>
			<p>Some time later we were on the move once again leapfrogging our stations as we had in France. However we were grateful that someone decided that we needed security forces for our relay stations that were out on hills and exposed to anyone who would do us harm. So one morning in came a truck and four Belgian soldiers. They had seen the atrocities that the Germans had committed in their country and they were ready to shoot down anyone who spoke German or appeared German. I had to restrain them a few times by reminding them that our mission was communications and not armed combat. It was their mission, I told them, to make sure that nobody interfered with our mission.</p>
			<p>When we reached Regensburg we quartered ourselves in a nice building that we learned had been Whermach officers quarters. Inside the building Lt. McDermott found a beautiful Swiss made surveyor's transit in a wooden box. It looked brand new like it had never been used. Somehow, I think he was able to send that home. For my part, I found an officer's dress sword and scabbard complete with lion heads and swastikas. I carried that booty in my duffle bag for the duration until I returned home.</p>
			<p>While traveling from Weimar to Regensberg, it was obvious that we were not heading toward Berlin. Instead we were going in a SE direction. The powers that be had preordained that General Patton would not be the first one in Berlin. Instead President Roosevelt and Churchill had agreed to allow Stalin's army to be first to enter the city.  April 12 we got word that President Franklin Delano Roosevelt died at his small home in Warm Springs, GA. VP Harry Truman became President and surprised the world with his strength in foreign policy. Would that he had been at Yalta!</p>
			<p>By this time German resistance was essentially non-existent. The armaments we saw by the side of the roads consisted of horse drawn vintage cannon complete with dead horses. Munich was just a pile of rubble. Our Air Force had done a very thorough job of demolishing that city. The streets we traveled through had been cleared by the Combat Engineers with bulldozers that simply pushed all the debris to both sides of the street to open it up for traffic.</p>
			<p>Finally we learned of the German surrender on May 8, 1945. It was President Truman's 61 st birthday. In few days we arrived at our destination; Bad Toltz, Bavaria. I found a doctor's estate on a hill and set up my installation inside a small studio building next door and installed the antennas on the roof of the house.</p>
			<p>The family was very friendly and they spoke English as well as French. Part of their roots came ftom Switzerland. The doctor's practice had been in Dresden and he told me he could not understand why the allies had bombed that city since it was not a military target. I said I did not know the answer to his question but I asked if he had he heard of the residential cities in England (Coventry &amp; others) that had been bombed by the German Air Force? He had not heard of it, he said. He did give me a warning that proved to be very accurate. He said that the US should be very wary of the Russians. He said they will sign any treaty that comes along but quickly disregard it when it suits them. For openers, not too long afterward we had the Berlin Blockade.</p>
			<p>While in Bad Toltz I got word ftom the Chief Signal Officer that General Patton would grant me a field commission if I were to agree. Apparently they also notified my company commander back at Ike's HQ because he came bouncing in on his jeep one day and talked me into staying ''with your old buddies" and he would put me in for a field commission. I fell for it and went back to the rear with him. True to his word, the papers were filed and we sat down to wait. A week later word came down that all field commissions were frozen. Had I stayed with Third Army I probably would have had the commission the next day and Patton would have had the papers filed after the fact.</p>
			<p>By this time all units of our company had been recalled to the company and conventional communications established for all military units in Europe.  The orders to move westward was a good sign to us. We were sure that meant that we were going home. We all had more than enough "points" to qualify for going home and that's where we wanted to go. The "Flyboys" in the Air Force did get to fly home and if they did not have enough points they at least got two weeks off at home before having to fly to the Pacific Theater.</p>
			<p>We traveled leisurely in convoy back to France and then turned south. That was a strange twist of events for us that we did not understand. We went through Lyon and down close to Marseille where we finally stopped and made camp out in the desert. Rumors flew as to what we were waiting for and the one that prevailed was that our ship to take us home was on its way.</p>
			<p>Nearby was an irrigation ditch and we used it to cool offftom the hot July sun. It was not clear water. It contained a lot of silt and sand but we couldn't care less. It was a welcome relief  Someone got wind of the fact that a few miles away were the ruins of a Roman amphitheater at a village called ArIes. Charlie Eiper, the oldest member of our company, and I decided to look into that. It was a real erie feeling being there in a place where gladiators fought to the death and perhaps Christians were fed to the lions.</p>
			<p>Finally our ship came and we were on our way. I had someone take my picture with Gibraltar in the background. We continued west and were grateful for that. We were sure we were on the way home.</p>
			<p>Several days later we saw land some distance away and we were told that it was Puerto Rico. We naturally wondered why we were so far south of New York. Could we be heading for New Orleans (we kept hoping?)</p>
			<p>A day or so later we heard an announcement over the ship's PA system that US planes had dropped an atomic bomb over Japan. "What is an atomic bomb?", we asked. Nobody on board knew so the crew fed us every news bulletin as they were broadcast on the radio. It was August 5, 1945.</p>
			<p>Another day past [sic.] and we were outside the entrance to the Panama Canal. .. ..not a good omen! But they made it pleasant for us going through the canal. They had an Army Sgt. On the P A system who gave us a complete rundown on all the points of interest and the statistics on all the locks.</p>
			<p>Once out on the Pacific Ocean we continued west. Soon we were told that a second atomic bomb had been dropped on Japan and we still did not know what an atomic bomb was. However we kept going and eventually we pulled in to a place called Hollandia harbor where we dropped off mail and picked up supplies and fuel. I was sitting on deck writing a letter when the announcement came over the P A system that General MacArthur was on Battleship Missouri in Tokyo harbor getting the Japanese surrender signature. It was September 2, 1945, V.J. Day!!</p>
			<p>So now the war was over and here we were halfway across the world without a paddle! From Hollandia we sailed north to Manila. As we entered Manila Bay we heard President Truman over the P A system making a speech saying to the American people that they should be patient about getting their sons and fathers back home. He said that it would take time to get shipping organized to bring us all back to the States. Here we were on a ship all ready to go but orders had to be cut and it would take time. When we looked around we counted no less than 50 ships of all description sitting high in the water, empty. Government and military matters cannot react as fast as we like them too.</p>
			<p>We had been at sea 45 days.  We were put in a tent compound outside the city where we stayed for three months.  To keep us from being bored they gave us work. Troops invading Luzon had piled their supplies alongside the roads and they needed to be moved into supply depots that had been set up. It became our job to load these materials onto trucks so they could be hauled away. In its supreme wisdom the Army decided that we should do this work in the evening on swing shift. During graveyard and day shifts they had Phillipino Army guards assigned to protect these supplies. However every evening when we arrived for work, there were always some boxes of supplies missing that had been there the previous night. We soon learned that military supplies were showing up on the black market in Manila. Strange way for saying "Thank You for liberating our country."</p>
			<p>In October or November the island of Okinawa was hit with a very strong hurricane that caused a lot of damage to the natives and to the military stationed there. We were south of that hurricane but close enough to feel the effects of it. For a while we thought all our tents would be blown away.</p>
<p>Finally, in December we were told that our ship had come in and we boarded a Navy AP A and bid Manila goodbye.</p>
<p>Several days later we were in sight of the Hawaiian Islands and suddenly a "Battle Stations alarm was sounded. A sailor had spotted a floating mine at a distance. The skipper moved our ship to a safe distance and some Navy personnel tried shooting at some ofthe tentacles that protruded from that mine. Of course the ship was bobbing up and down and so was the target so hitting it was not all that easy. Of course every time they shot and missed they would get a loud raspberry from all the Army personnel, but when they fInally hit it and blew it up a very loud cheer and a round of applause went up.</p>
<p>It was toward the end of December when we pulled in under the Golden Gate and to an Army camp at Pittsburgh, CA to wait for a train to take us East and home. It was at this camp that I got the biggest surprise of the war. One Sunday after Mass, I was in line for lunch when someone tapped me on the shoulder. I turned around to see Harvey Lacombe, my very close friend from Madawaska, ME. We had been friends since the second grade in this small town. What a surprise to see him! He had been stationed in SE Asia in the Air Force and we had corresponded several times during the war.</p>
<p>Our trains fmally came and I arrived back at Bradley Beach, NJ on New Years Eve and I was fInally reunited with my bride, Ann. Now we could start our lives together. Ann had continued her voice lessons while I was away. She had a very good soprano voice and I enjoyed hearing her sing.</p>
<p>The word was out on the GI Bill and the opportunities for that college education that I had so dearly dreamed about. I had done some research and the very best engineering school in my estimation was Rennselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, NY. So after a grand tour to Maine, Massachusetts and Niagara Falls to visit my family we ended up in Troy and I started my long awaited college studies.</p>
<p>We lived in Army barracks buildings that were converted into apartments for married veterans. While at RPI our daughters Peggy ('47) and Chris (' 49) were born.

After college I worked for DuMont TV as a District Service Manager out of St. Louis, covering fIve states helping TV servicemen with any service problems they had. Later I did the same job for Sylvania from the Chicago office. While in St. Louis our son, David ('51) was born and Dan came to us in '53 while in Gary, Indiana.</p>
<p>As the family was growing it became apparent that the constant travel was not a good way to raise that family so I requested a move to the new production plant in Batavia, NY.  I was given the position of Manager of In-Plant Quality Control. I had the responsibility for production line and assembly operations. We bought a house and settled down. Son Peter was born in Batavia.</p>
<p>Two years later I received a job offer from Aerojet General Corp. in Azusa, CA. This was a company deeply involved in rockets and other aerospace projects. The money was much better than I was making and so we made another move.</p>
<p>I started working at Aerojet as a Quality Engineer in January, 1947.  I was given several projects that involved electrical components. I had to review drawings and cause to have prepared quality planning in the manufacture of those devices. This equipment included an Infrared Gunsight for the F-104 fighter jet and Reactor Rod Controls for submarine nuclear reactors.</p>
<p>In 1959 I was asked by my boss to follow him to the Sacramento, CA plant to work of Polaris and Minuteman missile programs. Once again the money incentive was very good so I moved my family one more time. The job was that of ChiefInspector over all the inert (non-explosive) manufacturing areas ofthe plant. That included Receiving Inspection and 18 Quality Control representatives at vendor plants around the country. The plant manpower was building up and my initial staff of93 eventually grew to over 225.</p>
<p>One thing lead to another and I then was moved to the job of Manager of Reliability and later Program Manager over the Minuteman Second Stage Production Program.</p>
<p>Son Jon was born in 1961 and we built a new house. I thought we had fmally arrived but in 1996 Ann and I broke up and after a while a divorce decree was granted.</p>
<p>In 1969 I married Ludelle (Powell) Hudson and accepted an offer ftom Thiokol Corporation in Brigham City, Utah. At Thiokol I worked as a Program Manager on a number of programs such as Minuteman, Automobile Airbag, Waste Treatment, SRAM, and fmally P AM-DII which was a solid propellant rocket motor used to place satellites into geosychronous orbit around the earth. I retired March 31, 1988 and have remained in Brigham City. Aside ftom work I was active in the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks rising to the top office in my lodge of Exalted Ruler. A few years later I was made an officer of the Grand Lodge as District Deputy, Grand Exalted Ruler.</p>
<p>In retirement I have enjoyed cruises, golf and working on Habitat for Humanity projects and as a volunteer tax counselor for senior citizens. Ludelle died of cancer in 1998. Betty and Ray Johnson ftom Sacramento, were very good ftiends of ours for over 20 years. Ray died in 1995 and after Ludelle's death, Betty and I were married in 1999.</p>
<p>Finally, I have been three quarters around the world and one thing I have learned for sure. There is no better place in the world to live than the Good Old USA.  But we all have a responsibility to keep it that way. WE MUST KEEP IT FREE. FREEDOM IS NOT FREE. WE MUST WORK TO KEEP US FREE!</p>
