                  <speaker>Kelly Parker</speaker>
                  <p>Good morning. Today is May 19th, 2007, and my name is Kelly Parker. I'm conducting an oral interview at the Denver School of Court Reporting in Colorado in Westminster, and I'll be conducting the interview with Bob Fischer. He's my interviewee. And the court reporter is Erin Valenti. Okay. So you said -- I was reading here on your bio that you actually started as -- you were asked to join the military.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Robert Fischer</speaker>
                  <p>I was -- I was in the Maryknoll Seminary studying to be a priest in the summer of 1948. And I found out by February that I liked girls better. So I went home, and I'm home in February. And my buddies were in the Navy Reserve, a few of them. And I, you know, went back to college. And I was playing basketball and all kinds of fun. And they said, Well, come down to the Reserve; we need a softball pitcher. And my nickname in high school was Hands. I said, You get paid to go on the Reserve? Yeah, you get paid to go on the Reserve. So I went from being a softball pitcher in my hometown Naval Reserve to becoming a corporal in the Marine Corps. (A cell phone rang.)</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Kelly Parker</speaker>
                  <p>I can't believe that is ringing. Okay.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Robert Fischer</speaker>
                  <p>No. I wound up -- the Naval Reserve wound up to be a real boon, because the commander of the Reserve, Redmond Reilly (ph), asked me after about one year -- he played third base. So -- we -- he said, Well, why don't you go to the Naval Academy? And I said, Who, me? And his comment was classic -- his response was classic. He said, They're all like you. And he was absolutely right. We were all the same when we got there, except for a couple admirals' sons and stuff like that.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Kelly Parker</speaker>
                  <p>What does that mean, "all the same"?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Robert Fischer</speaker>
                  <p>All the other guys were just like I was. We all came from similar backgrounds -- little towns, big towns, cities. And we were no different. Some were a little smarter than others, but we were all similar to each other. You know, don't say, Me, go there? You know, no, you can go there; you can handle it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Kelly Parker</speaker>
                  <p>Yeah. Yeah.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Robert Fischer</speaker>
                  <p>So I wound up there. And I decided to go into the Marine Corps because I hated whaleboats and rowing up and down the Severn River in the cold, sloppy stuff. And then I spent years in the Marine Corps riding boats and barfing all over the ocean. And then I wound up -- I wound up working my way -- I was a career Marine, thirty years. I went the whole route and never looked back.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Kelly Parker</speaker>
                  <p>So -- boy, you went through all my questions.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Robert Fischer</speaker>
                  <p>Oh, no. I got lots more to tell you.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Kelly Parker</speaker>
                  <p>I'm sure you do. So do you recall your first days in the service, specifically boot camp, what it was like?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Robert Fischer</speaker>
                  <p>Well, my -- my Reserve time was more fun than anything else. We played softball and basketball. We had great ball teams in those days. And I -- I -- all I remember is having a lot of fun for about a year and a half. And then I said, Okay, the Academy sounds good. So I went to Minneapolis and -- in the Reserve, active Reserve up there. I went to Wold-Chamberlain -- W-O-L-D Chamberlain Airfield, where I had to put in 27 weekend meetings and go to the Northwestern Prep School for the academy to get my math and my sciences up. And I went to Minneapolis for about seven months to get ready to take the Academy exam and managed to pass it, and I wound up at the Naval Academy in the summer of 1951. And that was my first boot camp. Now, if you've never been a plebe at the Naval Academy -- and I don't even want to discuss that with women, because it's wild. We had no women, no girls. And boot camp -- it was boot camp. It was harassment for 13 full months. I mean, you did everything that you could imagine that was humiliating, degrading. Because the objective at Annapolis is to try to wash you out. So we lost -- out of a 1,200 -- 1,100-man starting class, we wound up with 749. That many dropped out. Not today. It's a lot easier today. But it was pretty rough. And I went through lots of boot camps after that. I went through Marine Corps officer training at Quantico as the brand-new second lieutenant, and that gets wild. Then I went to seven Army schools: Airborne, Ranger, jungle school, adviser schools, special forces. I went the whole route. And then -- it was all good. But -- but it was -- it all came to pass because my father, who was a German -- first-generation German from Frankfurt, Germany, was a building contractor. And had he not prepped me ruggedly for what -- working in the roughest of the roughest -- the concrete, the blocks, the hog carrying, the whole nine yards -- I was ready for everything. It was all easy. Even the jungles of Vietnam were easy after my father's summer training, all-year training.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Kelly Parker</speaker>
                  <p>That's incredible.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Robert Fischer</speaker>
                  <p>Yeah. I give him a lot of credit.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Kelly Parker</speaker>
                  <p>So --</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Robert Fischer</speaker>
                  <p>I do remember my first --</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Kelly Parker</speaker>
                  <p>Did anybody make you --</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Robert Fischer</speaker>
                  <p>Yes.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Kelly Parker</speaker>
                  <p>Yes. Those stories in boot camp where they -- they make you crawl up trees backwards or -- what's the craziest thing that --</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Robert Fischer</speaker>
                  <p>Well, getting locked in a locker -- and your foot locker's the size of that table over there. And you get put in that in Annapolis right off the bat. Lock you inside there, and then they smoke through the thing. And then you're --</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Kelly Parker</speaker>
                  <p>Are you kidding?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Robert Fischer</speaker>
                  <p>Oh, no. You play handball in the shower with the lights off with your roommate in full sweat gear. And then you run unbelievable miles. But the Marine Corps training, which is what I welcomed, that's very rugged training. That's -- that's intense physical training, obstacle courses, ice-cold fox holes at Quantico, climbing through jungles. You name it, I've done it. I've been in all the training: Ranger, jumping out of airplanes having my parachute not open. All kinds of stuff.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Kelly Parker</speaker>
                  <p>What was your favorite?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Robert Fischer</speaker>
                  <p>My favorite training?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Kelly Parker</speaker>
                  <p>Did you enjoy jumping out of planes or --</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Robert Fischer</speaker>
                  <p>Well, the sensation. It was something to be done. I never missed -- I always missed the drop zone, so I was not a good paratrooper. I always landed in an irrigation field, a farmer's orchard. I went through an apple tree in Yucaipa, California. I had lots of -- my favorite training was -- I think was the naval gunfire and air spot training on San Clemente Island off of California where we were plunked out there for a week, just dropped in with some sea rations. And then they brought the ships in and we call-fired it to learn how to fire -- call gunfire from the Navy ship and targets from the beach. And then we lived off of goat and abalone. To heck with the sea rations. We also trained to be air observers, so I got the full flight gear and all that. And I was an air spotter. And then I -- we put that to good use in Vietnam, as well as aboard the 7th Fleet Flagship, where I commanded the Marines in the 7th Fleet Flagship in southeast Asia. I got all over. And I studied for guerilla wars. I had an extensive career. So --</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Kelly Parker</speaker>
                  <p>What is the -- what's that you brought?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Robert Fischer</speaker>
                  <p>That's my book I wrote about my experience as an Vietnamese Marine adviser.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Kelly Parker</speaker>
                  <p>I was reading that that --</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Robert Fischer</speaker>
                  <p>Some of us were selected -- just very few of us were selected to become advisers, covans, to the Vietnamese Marine Corps. I brought this to give to you, because this has all the pictures. This has the whole story of being an adviser from the time that I went to Vietnam. And I trained for it. I had to train for it at Fort Bragg. And we -- we spoke -- we were taught the language by real pretty little Vietnamese girls wearing their Ao dais. And now I know why the Vietcong fought so valiantly, because they went out in the field to fight rather than stay home with Ba, the wife. Ba was pretty tough, and they were tough little teachers too.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Kelly Parker</speaker>
                  <p>Really?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Robert Fischer</speaker>
                  <p>Oh, yeah. They were very, very tough. And then we learned all the skills of an adviser. We even delivered babies. And all -- bacshi, doctors. There'd be doctors and all kinds of stuff.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Kelly Parker</speaker>
                  <p>Really?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Robert Fischer</speaker>
                  <p>Well, you have to. You have to learn to do wounds. And it was -- that's the most -- that's the most interesting experience I had, because that was my tour in Vietnam with the Vietnamese Marine Corps. And you're just by yourself with 800 Vietnamese Marines, unless you got a lieutenant sometimes. And the stories are all in here -- they're pretty wild -- of what we did, what happened. And the survival -- you probably should know the Marine Corps was easy compared to being an adviser, because we had no food; we had no rations. We had nothing. We lived off the land and we drank the filthy stream water, which is how I got Agent Orange. Our motto was don't go near the kitchen, because you don't want to see what they caught that afternoon out in the jungle and are cooking up that night. They'd chop it up in little squares that big. And if you had rice and your rice hadn't run out in a week or gone rotten, then you had that little bit of food. So I lost 65 pounds --</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Kelly Parker</speaker>
                  <p>Oh, my gosh.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Robert Fischer</speaker>
                  <p>-- and 6 inches off my waist in six months.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Erin Valenti</speaker>
                  <p>I have a question. What exactly is an adviser?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Robert Fischer</speaker>
                  <p>An adviser is an American trained -- in all services we had advisers. It's an American trained to go over and provide military training for the Vietnamese units. We've done it with Koreans. We've done it all over the world. Special forces teams -- you're literally training them to become an equivalent of the U.S. Marines. That type of thing. They called us covan, C-O-V-A-N, which is trusted friend or -- or adviser. We were the covans. That's in my book.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Kelly Parker</speaker>
                  <p>Do you feel like they trusted you, like they accepted you as --</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Robert Fischer</speaker>
                  <p>Well, that's interesting. There were 25 of us in 1966. And they had to trust you, because we were their only resource for medevacs, artilleries, air support, helicopters, artillery, joint unit coordination. They had to come to trust you somewhat. But some were not trusted. Some couldn't make it in the field, so they were sent back up to the headquarters to become flunkies. And you had to earn your way. That's what my book's about. You had to earn your way with them and gain their respect. Not just in combat, but just in general. And they're extremely -- they're extremely difficult people. I equate this in the sense -- you'll love this. I say it's like a woman having a 30-day PMS and you've got to deal with it. That's how they are. They're that sensitive, and they're always looking for something wrong with you.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Kelly Parker</speaker>
                  <p>So you really have to prove yourself?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Robert Fischer</speaker>
                  <p>Well, you have to. And most -- most of those that were selected, most of us that went over were probably considered fast learners, top level of the Marine Corps. We had already proven ourselves in the Marine Corps. But some washed out. We lost more of our covans, or advisers, to illness over there than we did to being shot or wounded. Because you could get sick very easy, liver flukes. I had amoebic dysentery for seven months. And it's rough. It's pretty rough. And you dealt with it. That's how you lose all your weight. So I'm going to go back over and lose it again. Try it again. So -- yeah. It's -- it's a very unique experience. And it's the most defining period of my life. That's a little bit of it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Kelly Parker</speaker>
                  <p>I know. I know. So since you were such a high level officer, did you really see any field combat or -- when you were training these troops?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Robert Fischer</speaker>
                  <p>Well, she can't write it from the book here, but I developed in Vietnam -- I was all over Vietnam. I made the biggest operation of the war, which was called Junction City, in February of '67 where we had hundreds of Army helicopters take us into the Cambodian border --</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Kelly Parker</speaker>
                  <p>Is that what they call the --</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Robert Fischer</speaker>
                  <p>That's the Ho Chi Minh -- well, that was in Cambodia; but that's the Ho Chi Minh Trail. We were clear -- we were cleaning 75 miles of the Ho Chi Minh Trail where we thought there would be North Vietnamese in their camps and everything else. Well, there were. There were lots of camps. But unfortunately, when you go out in a big operation they already know from inside intelligence. They had -- they had agents on the staffs in Saigon, and they knew everything on our big operations. Only the small operations were truly effective. But we found dozens of North Vietnamese camps. Interesting enough, that's where we'd get our food and rice. They were better at cooking than we were. They had the supply system off the docks in Saigon from our own supplies better than we had. Our rice would run out in five days and it would rot, and then we're living off whatever -- if we get fish out of a stream. Or if we could find a B-52 crater that had water in it, fresh water, we would lower a Vietnamese -- young Vietnamese soldier, Marine, down there with 20 or 30 canteens hanging on him. And then we'd sink him down in the water until all -- he and the canteens stopped bubbling. When they all stopped bubbling, we pulled him up. And if he kicked dirt down in there, his Vietnamese lieutenant had a stick, like a big chain, and he'd whack him to pieces for putting dirt in that water. Otherwise, we just drank the filthy stream water with halazone tablets, and my sister sent lemonade packets. And that's how we got so many diseases and Agent Orange and liver flukes. We were the last of the real field advisers who stayed in the field all the time. I lived in the Vietnamese villages. I lived with the --</p>

                  <speaker>Robert Fischer</speaker>
                  <p>Oh, yeah. Sure. That's what we were hunting all the time. Here's my little pals. Here's the little kids in the villages where I was living. There's the women. That's the villages, what they generally looked like. (There was an interruption at the door.)</p>

                  <speaker>Robert Fischer</speaker>
                  <p>Let's see. The best way to describe it is we went on great big operations at the beginning. And I don't know if you know that much about the Vietnamese. Before I went to Vietnam, I'd already been in southeast Asia in 1961 and '62 when I commanded the Marines on the 7th Fleet Flagship. Our admiral went everywhere in Asia. We went all over. So I studied the guerrilla wars in the Philippines. I studied -- it was active in Thailand.</p>

                  <speaker>Kelly Parker</speaker>
                  <p>(By Ms. Parker) Who were those between, the guerrilla wars?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Robert Fischer</speaker>
                  <p>That was the locals of those countries. The Indonesians were -- had their own communist cadres and parties started. Ho Chi Minh had organized five different guerrilla -- guerrilla wars in five different nations. A lot of people don't know that about Ho Chi Minh, who was trained in Russia, who was at the Versailles peace conference and was the --</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Kelly Parker</speaker>
                  <p>That is strange.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Robert Fischer</speaker>
                  <p>-- was the Asian representative to Michael Bordean (ph), the Secretary of State of Russia. And he became a devout communist and was trained, went back to North Vietnam, and organized with General Giap the invasion of the South. It's a long, long story. Well, anyway I teach this in my counterguerrilla school. I came back from studying those guerrilla wars and then went to Malaya and saw the famous Gurkhas and their training course, and I stole the entire course. I stole the Malaya Jungle School. And they're successful. They're 12 year emergency. They beat their communist terrorists. It took them 12 years. Does that relate to Iraq, how long it would take in Iraq? And they only had 35,000 enemy. They only fought against 35,000 what they call communist terrorists, who were Indian, Malaya, Chinese background. They were the insurgents and guerillas. But they just pulled all their people into the -- in their campongs (ph), their villages. They put four or five villages and plugged them out in there and kept them out. And eventually they got rid of them. So I took that guerrilla school and brought it back to Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, and -- over great opposition by the Marine Corps and senior Marines, who wanted nothing do with guerilla warfare. In 1965 when we went to Vietnam, still fighting it, I managed to get the counterguerrilla training into the Marine Corps.</p>

                  <speaker>Kelly Parker</speaker>
                  <p>So you had the intelligence, but they didn't want to use it?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Robert Fischer</speaker>
                  <p>I not only had it; I'd studied it. I saw it firsthand. I had two former bosses that fought in China with the Chinese guerillas against the Japs. And it was hands-on in the Philippines, Malaya, Laos, Thailand, places like that that had their guerilla wars. And I began to get an appreciation for it. It was a very difficult sell. Just like in Iraq -- I'll relate it to Iraq. Rumsfeld wanted a very powerful, high-tech military machine that was going to go in and blow Sadam away; but he wouldn't listen to one word that there would be an insurgency immediately. And that's why we're floundering. That's why we started floundering. Same parallel. Same. Identical. Same obtuse Secretary of Defense; same obtuse whatever.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Kelly Parker</speaker>
                  <p>Yeah. It's sad.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Robert Fischer</speaker>
                  <p>I don't need to go that far. But it's -- the parallels are just alarming. McNamara and Rumsfeld, identical obtuse, obsolescent obstacles. Arrogant people who, No, I know how to fight this war. And we didn't know how to fight it. So that's why I taught and trained the first 30,000 Marines. And we had Navy Seals come. We had Special Forces come, Navy Seabees come to my school. And we taught guerilla warfare. That's only 30,000.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Kelly Parker</speaker>
                  <p>What exactly did you teach -- what is guerilla --</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Robert Fischer</speaker>
                  <p>Guerilla warfare? Guerilla -- what happened -- Ho Chi Minh and General Giap defined -- they wrote the book on guerrilla warfare. People's War-People's Army by General Giap says everyone in Vietnam, North and South, is a soldier in my Army. Every little boy, every young girl, every woman, man, old man. Every one of you are soldiers. Now, you can say how -- how can -- how, if they were South Vietnamese? Didn't they have loyalties to their own president? Yep. Let me tell you a startling story. When I wound up on my last part of my tour in Bong Son when I was up at the air cavalry, the famous Army air cavalry, they were here in their landing zone, English; and we were in our landing zone over here. And we -- we tried to get together, but they didn't have much use for Vietnamese. The American military didn't think much of the Vietnamese. I said -- I'd said to General Tolsom (ph), the air craft commander, My colonel has been fighting ten years before you got here and has had more success in the field than you have in combat. It didn't matter. But anyway, it took some living in the villages to really see and understand how the people were not only intimidated, many villages were procommunist, pro-Ho Chi Minh in Vietnam. I would say almost two-thirds were.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Kelly Parker</speaker>
                  <p>Even South?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Robert Fischer</speaker>
                  <p>Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Because South -- the South Vietnamese were -- their land reforms hadn't gone through. The rich in the cities were their landlords. There was a lot of popular discontent in the people. And all it took was a cadre of leadership, the Vietcong, the teachers that came in in the late '50s and early '60s after they beat the French. And they brought what they call the teachers in, the Vietcong, and they started infiltrating the villages and gaining the support of a lot of people. So a lot of people -- the South Vietnamese were the Vietcong. The North Vietnamese were the North Vietnamese, the NVA. They were a separate country, but their leadership is what initiated the insurgency, the revolution, in the South. And they beat the French in 1954, the famous Dien Bien Phu. D-I-E-N, B-I-E-N, P-H-U. Famous Dien Bien Phu. The French were defeated, and they're kicked out of their colonial empire and there's a big void. And we've just come out of the Korean War, and all of a sudden when I'm there in 1961 you could see the beginnings of the guerrilla formation in the villages and insurgents. And it's done through terrorism. It's done through horrible terrorism. And I'll tell you one story, because that's the only one you really need to relate to it. But they're terrorized. If you're not pro-Ho Chi Minh or pro-North Vietnam, well, you're -- thousands of their village chiefs, the provincial chiefs, were executed. The teachers were executed. People don't realize that in the early '60s they just decimated the -- the whole infrastructure of South Vietnam that was opposed to Ho Chi Minh. Just killed them. Like Stalin. Like Lenin. Like others -- like Sadam did. There's parallels. So anyways, people's war, people's army. All right. You're either going to be joining me to fight this government, President Giap, or the traditional government of South Vietnam, or we'll execute you. We'll execute your mother, your dad. So in Bong Son -- an interesting story that you'll -- that we'll relate to. Not many people hear these. My lieutenant, H-E-R-K -- Herk, I called him. He was a wild man. He was a sergeant in Korea, but he was a guy who understood people. He's out flying one day up in Bong Son in an aircraft helicopter, and he sees an old man standing in a graveyard waving a white shirt with his little old wizened wife crouching down behind him. And he goes down and lands and picks them up, and we bring them back in. Now, Bong Son is 102 percent procommunist. They are Vietcong. It's one of the toughest areas in Vietnam. And I'm up there sitting in the vils in that area, and they're all -- they're all enemy. They're all -- you know, a hundred percent. My barber was a Vietcong, and my cowboy sat there with his rifle cocked at his head like this while he -- while he gave me a haircut with this only. (Indicating) No razors. So I got a haircut every couple weeks. And Dinh, my cowboy, would sit there with the M-16 leveled right at him. Safety off. You know, you mess with me, pow, he's gone. But we knew he was -- he probably led the attack on us the night before. That's how close and wild it gets. But we couldn't figure why, with so much activity -- government activity trying to put medical programs in, trying to help them grow better crops -- you know, to get in the vils, why are they so anti-South Vietnam government? Why are they anti-American? And Herk then picks up the old man, the real old farmer, and brings him in. And they tell him the story that there's a young North Vietnamese girl -- she's 26, 27 years old; university graduate; trained in China in the terrorist schools with her six-man team, all university students come down from the north. Bong Son is their village and hamlet area. And they appear at random at night, go up in the vil every two weeks, six weeks, eight weeks apart. You never know. Some are random. She'd come in. She'd say -- point to you. That means the next time I come, I kill you. It wasn't a threat. She actually killed you the next time she came. Now, they're on the same side. These people are on the same side. Bong Son's 100 percent behind Ho Chi Minh. Yet she's an agent of Ho Chi Minh, a terrorist. And that's how they maintained the terror and the control. So in October I go up and fly around when the elections are supposed to take place for the free -- remember like they did in Afghanistan? I'm looking at the whole Bong Son area in the morning, and there's not anything moving except the cats, dogs, and chickens. Not one person came out of their hooch, or their house, to go vote. And you say, How'd that happen? How did a young girl with six of her thugs pull this off? Well, it gets worse. The story gets rough. One of my lieutenants was a -- Mexican-American born in the land of New Mexico, Sanchez. And he befriended a little boy, nine, in one of the vils. We'd go through the villages; and this little boy would come up to him all the time, kind of a pal. Well, when she came the next time with her team that night, she found him. She knew this had happened, because intelligence is everywhere. And she hung him from a tree and cut him in pieces. And he then had a mission to get her. And we didn't deal with anything except trusted -- his own trusted few Vietnamese Marines. Never tell anything to the villagers. But we started plotting where she was at, where she came. It took us a couple of months. He set up the ambush, and we got her. We called her "The Bitch." And I had to go up and fly out -- when they kept her, I had to fly out and get her and bring her in with her -- we only had three or four of her guys. A couple had probably been killed in the ambush or something. But we got them. We got the whole damn team. And I asked my counterpart, I said, What happens to her? He said, You don't want to know; she goes to Saigon for interrogation. And -- but that's how they would control hamlets and villages, you name it, through this terror. And that's what a lot of Americans don't know and don't understand, that when you're terrorized enough and you know that the next time they come to the village somebody's going to be killed right there in the village -- both the old man and the old lady were going to be killed. That's why they ran and were hiding. And I tell this to a lot of high school kids and a lot of college kids. You know, like, wow, that's rough. I said, Well, how do you think the al-Qaida, the Taliban -- how do you think Stalin's NKVD -- how do you think they all operated? Hitler's Nazis? How do you think this happens? And that's the counterpart of it. They've all learned from all the old ones. So that's what I saw and that's what I lived. I had a chance to do a lot of good. I'd bring in bulger wheat and milk powders. I brought the milk powder in, and I found out they were selling it black market to the French bakeries. Because the babies in Vietnam don't brink milk after mother's milk. At that point on they're drinking out of Pepsi bottles or anything else -- water. They don't drink any milk. Their stomach has so much bacteria in it that it just makes them violently ill. But we held our own little -- we'd hold or own med camps. Our doctors would go out and help. Even in that Bong Son we always tried to help the villagers out as much as we could, knowing at least that night you'd see them go up the mountains. You could watch them through a sniper's scope, a starlight scope, which gives you infrared looking. You could see the villagers walking up the trails to the mountain. And they had to dig three meters of tunnel, trenches and tunnels, every night they went up. They'd go up for, like, that night or a couple nights. And their job was to dig more tunnels and trenches, which there were 50,000 miles of tunnels and trenches in Vietnam. We're talking about hard to find them. But anyway, that's what it was like to be an adviser, to a great degree. And we'd go in -- give them a little baby aspirin. Our doctors would hold med camps, medical visits. And there was an Army captain who came out of the air cab who was phenomenal. I don't remember his name. He was black, and he was a captain. And in Bong Son -- which is up in the northern one-third of the country up along the coast, 102 percent enemy, so you didn't -- our road was mined almost every day. You don't go out on these trails unless you took a company or a battalion on out to the villages when you went out. I never went out on my own. We'd never go out in small units very often, because you'd run into snipers, booby traps, mines. This captain could go from below us, 11 miles below us, in his Jeep with just a driver. And he would go up to dozens of villages on any of the trails. Nothing happened. They knew -- they knew ahead of time. They knew he was coming to help. And they're the enemy. The enemy women, kids. A lot of the medicine he probably left went to the VC or the -- the enemy that was up there. And this is how weird it is. That's how much they know. And one more story on intelligence and I'll let you ask me some questions. My first landing in the delta -- my first amphibious landing down in the delta, which is in Kien Hoa Province, we go down with Marines, the U.S. Marine battalion, and my Vietnamese marines. We'd land at Kien Hoa; we'd go on shore. And I decided to go out on a patrol with one young lieutenant, who happened to be with my best friend when his whole battalion was killed, wiped out. Almost two-thirds of his Vietnamese marine battalion was wiped out at Van Kiep, a huge ambush. And he had his nose shot off. And he's the guy that introduced me to my wife, my beautiful Aussie. So we go -- we land at Kien Hoa. And I go out on a patrol like about the second day. I go up with this lieutenant in this patrol, see how they're doing. We go through the little villages, the little enemy villages out there, make about a 5-, 7-mile patrol and come back in. And as we're going out, I see the water buffalo boys are sitting there on the water buffalos. They're only within a quarter-mile of us or close up, and they're somewhere in the rice patty. There's one sitting here and there's another one here. And he says, Watch the intelligence network. I say, What do you mean? He said, Watch the intelligence; watch the little boys. And the minute we move, the little boys jumped off the water buffalos and ran like this to pass to the next little boy down the line. And they knew exactly where we were and how much strength we were and everything else. That's their intelligence. So they had us covered all the time. That's so -- it's so subtle and it's so different and so difficult for our American troops. And that's what we trained in the counterguerrilla school. We trained in all these tactics and techniques: how to cordon a village and how to search it properly, the tunnels inside it; how to escape the booby traps; how to fight and fire the Gurkha drills. Back at Lejeune, that's what we trained all our troops in: how to survive a truck, convoy ambush; how to deal with the villagers; how to use the interpreter. We were teaching that in '65, even though the Marine Corps didn't want me to teach it. Wild.</p>

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Robert Fischer</speaker>
                  <p>It was won three times.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Kelly Parker</speaker>
                  <p>It was?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Robert Fischer</speaker>
                  <p>It was won three times. And I quote the gentleman in here. Michael Lind, L-I-N-D, wrote this fabulous book, Vietnam, The Necessary War. He wrote it about 1985. And he went back to Vietnam and interviewed the North Vietnamese generals, those who were the right-hand men of General Giap and Ho Chi Minh. And the Tet Offensive, the famous Tet Offensive where the Vietcong decided to sacrifice themselves and revolt in a dozen major cities and just -- the famous city Hue where we had to go kick them out. Saigon, they took it. They took over the embassy. I mean, they came out of nowhere in January of '68. I had just left two weeks before that happened. And the American people didn't understand it. But, see, 75 percent of the Vietcong had been killed and decimated as a result of that. It was a major sacrifice. But General Giap and Ho Chi Minh knew that that would be handled by the American media as a victory for the Vietcong on the South. And it wasn't.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Kelly Parker</speaker>
                  <p>It was actually ours?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Robert Fischer</speaker>
                  <p>And the generals that Lind interviewed said, We would have negotiated right then had the American people -- Walter Cronkite said, The war's over; it's lost. He stood in Saigon: It's lost. It's lost. We've lost the war. Everybody in America listened to Uncle Walter and believed it. And the general said, We would have negotiated and moved back to the DMZ and had, like, a North and South Korea. That was in the spring of '65. In 1972, my Vietnamese marines -- we had all left. All American troops had left out of Vietnam from late '69 to '70. We were transferred. We didn't lose the war. We were already out of the country. The war was lost in '75. We were gone by '70. And the famous battle up at the DMZ, what they call I Corps, right up against North Vietnam, is the demilitarized zone. Quang Tri Province was a great big province contested, and Marines fought there for years. Famous caisson, Chu Lai. We -- you know, Da Nang and all those places that you hear --</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Kelly Parker</speaker>
                  <p>Yeah.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Robert Fischer</speaker>
                  <p>Well, the Vietnamese marines -- we had a full division that we had trained. When I went, there was just the 6th Battalion coming in. We had a whole division of nine battalions. And they were up there with some of the better troops, Rangers. North Vietnam comes down into Quang Tri Province, and a huge battle called the Easter Offensive lasted ten months. And we beat them. My young Vietnamese marines, my little Vietnamese marines won that battle and bloodied the hell out of them. Friends of mine got the Navy Cross. We still had advisers with them. And the media reported that as a -- as a defeat of the South Vietnamese, and yet the South Vietnamese had won. And the generals again told Lind, We were right up to negotiate. You had marines sitting right offshore floating on ships. All you had to do was come in with air, marines landing over Da Nang again. We would have said negotiate then. And the final time was when they came in '75. By the way, 75 percent of my Vietnamese marines were killed or wounded in that ten months. They never -- they never reconstituted again. We took all the money away from them. We never repaired a single artillery piece. We didn't do a thing for the South. We abandoned them after the battle. We should have been pouring new weaponry in, more advisers training them up again. The North Vietnamese took three full years, with the Russians spending mega billions, and rearmed them with everything. And then they recruited 14 and 40-year-olds. That was all that was left. And that became the army that you saw come down and take Saigon. That was the army. Nothing to oppose them. And had we come in with our B-52s even then, again, when they were coming across that DMZ, these generals said, We would have negotiated for the third time. The war could've ended three times.</p>

                  <speaker>Kelly Parker</speaker>
                  <p>So the media -- because Vietnam was so widely televised -- do you need a break?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Robert Fischer</speaker>
                  <p>The media -- no. The media was so corrupt.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Kelly Parker</speaker>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Robert Fischer</speaker>
                  <p>The media was so corrupt. When I went on my first amphibious landing in -- in February -- January 1st, 1967 -- (There was an interruption at the door.)</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Robert Fischer</speaker>
                  <p>To give you the newsman's slant, I got there in '66, in late '66. They had already had the famous Ia Drang with the AirCav -- We Were Soldiers -- the movie We Were Soldiers. Well, I trained with them at Benning. I was at Fort Benning when they mustered and trained, flew with them. And I wasn't there at the Ia Drang. But that happened a year before -- a little over a year before I got there. That was -- that was written up as, Oh, the great American defeat in the field. Well, it turns out that battalion killed 3,000 North Vietnamese in that fight. But you couldn't get it across to newsmen. So when we went into the delta and were on the ships, we had 35 newsmen with us from every -- from every magazine, everything you have. You've heard of the famous Peter Arnett. Peter Arnett, who was in Baghdad with the bombs going off. Well, I was with him on Deckhouse V. He was sitting in the ward room just like we were. We sat there and we talked. He was a good guy. He was trying to tell it the way it was. Larry Burrows, the famous LIFE Magazine photographer. You could count on one hand out of the 25 the ones that weren't hippie, Boulder, CU-trained-type of liberal lunatics. That's what they were. That's what comes out of your journalism schools. And they were writing their stories before we ever went ashore about -- they were so negative. They passed the word in Vung Tau about the operation and already compromised it, those newsmen. They were dressed in ragged -- ragged Levis with shower shoes on, beards. And the executive officer of the ship says, Oh, no, not in my ward room. You're not going to my ward room. You go back with the troops. We'll set up a separate chow line for you. You need to come in here and dress decently, not looking like a pig. This is what we dealt with. So some of us recommended -- all except Arnett and Burrows. I said, Let's put them in a landing craft, send them in one day before the exercise, operation. Let's send them on in. But I saw it right off the bat. It was prejudiced just like it was -- and I can't tell you why it is. Just like in Iraq. We -- we have -- we have in Iraq -- to wrap it up, we have killed most of the key al-Qaida leaders inside Iraq. We've killed -- they say -- they estimate we've killed up to a thousand or more of their al-Qaida. Not the Iraqi, not the Sunnis, not the Shi'ites. The al-Qaida. Now, wait a minute. Nancy Pelosi says -- and John Kerry says and Kennedy says, George, you've got it wrong. We should be fighting terrorists. We should be going after al-Qaida. Well, what the heck are we doing in Iraq? What were we after? We're wiping out the al-Qaida. I just read something on the Internet that just came back from a pretty decent journalist who said, Well, the Sunni are even beginning to join us because they're tired of the al-Qaida killing their people in their neighborhoods. They're blowing up Iraqis too, innocent people. And a big IED goes off and kills 30 people in a marketplace -- that's Sunnis. Now the Sunnis are rebelling against al-Qaida. And he said, You can't get this story across. We can't get this straight, that we might even be winning at the low-key level over there and decimating al-Qaida. That's happening -- that comes off -- off of our military e-mails that are coming back from over there. And, see, you'll never get the stories out. I feel for your generation and future generations. But I predict -- and I'm going to go eat something. I told my 11-year-old grandson, Don't bother going to the Naval Academy after your granddad, because you're never going to see a war. You will never, ever go to war. No American president, the American public, will never, ever go back to war again. They may blow our San Francisco Bridge. They may put a dirty bomb in Long Beach harbor. And Nancy will look and say, What bomb? What bomb? It's that bad. It's that bad. But I still predict -- I'd like to write my next book on the last American war. Because we've had it. We're never going to do this again. Not in your lifetime. You'll probably be my age, 76 someday, and say, I remember that dang colonel told me back then that we'd never see another war. Can you imagine any more troops -- our young people wanting to go to war under these conditions and be betrayed like I was in Vietnam?</p>

                  <speaker>Robert Fischer</speaker>
                  <p>Yeah. Well, see, we fight for each other. We go over -- we don't care with the orders are. Give us an order, we'll go take care of it. Yeah, Marines have always done that. Send me out. Okay. My loyalty is to my other Marines. You want something done, we'll do it. We'll do it as good as you want it done. But the disillusionment will come when they pull the chain sometime and they do the same as they did to us. We were spit on when we came out of Vietnam. We came through an airport in uniform. We were spit on by American -- American, decent people spit on us, threw rocks at us.</p>

                  <speaker>Robert Fischer</speaker>
                  <p>Well, they hate everything that's excellent in America. The capitalism is hated. I'll grant you we have a lot of bad things that happened. But if you look at the ultimate, overall good of what America's accomplished and what it's done to the world, most of the Marines -- most Marines are loyal to that. We're loyal to this America that's -- that's --</p>

Let me put you over in southern Sudan for a couple of weeks. Let me put you in Cambodia. How about the Philippines? You want to try Russia? Oh, no. Not even Japan. Maybe Denmark, Sweden -- maybe. Those places. The ones that are the hostile places, go on over to your friends.</p>

                  <p>I tell my stepson and -- I tell my two stepsons you have to have -- you have to sell your soul to be a politician. You have to sell -- you have to sell out. I'm a good friend of Bob Beauprez. I go to church with him. I give him communion. I'm a eucharistic minister. And I look at him and I think, Yeah, Bob, I listen to some of your stuff too; you don't believe everything you're saying. You got to sell your soul because of your special interest groups and your people here and your supporters. You got to kowtow. You got -- you got to sell out. But -- maybe it's not -- it's not traitorous, it's not treasonous; but you have to do things that you truly don't believe in. And I don't want to be a politician. I was happy just doing what I'm doing.</p>

                  <speaker>Robert Fischer</speaker>
                  <p>I had a career. I had a ball. I came out of the Marine Corps, and we wound up inventing these recycling machines that give you your nickel back. I was a VP of that. Started that. Six dumb Marines started that. And we outdid Coors. We out did National Can. Everybody. That was successful. And I wound up vice-president with Price Waterhouse, and I wound up a senior consultant with Andersen Consulting. And I wound up a university professor for 15 years. And I've wound up just coming to Colorado and hanging it up. I lost my beautiful Aussie in 1990.</p>

                  <speaker>Robert Fischer</speaker>
                  <p>She was secretary to the military attache in Washington, D.C, the Australian military attache. And it was the guy who had his nose shot off and lost his battalion, he and his girlfriend -- she lived with her. And he said, Oh, you got to meet this great Aussie. And I heard some of my buddies had gone out with her. They said, Oh, what a neat gal she is. Finally I got a blind date; and pow, that was it. I stole her from Australia and she stayed. We lived a great life, you know, all over the world. We lived in Japan. We lived in -- you name it. Australia. We've been all over. Hawaii five years. Gee, we just had a tough life.</p>

                  <speaker>Robert Fischer</speaker>
                  <p>Oh, yeah. Well, we only had two little ones with us in Japan. My youngest daughter Carrie -- I still kid her to this day. I said, You spoke Japanese with our maid Katsuko before you spoke English. Little one-year-old full of rice and soy sauce every time I came in. Just a sloppy girl. She said, Oishii, oishii, anondey (ph). She'd talk Japanese to me. She's here in Denver. The others are in Virginia.</p>

                  <speaker>Robert Fischer</speaker>
                  <p>My youngest gets married 2nd of June. She's an American Airline flight attendant, looks like Farrah Fawcett. Held off until she was 42. Finally met this kind of neat guy who's a campaign manager. I said, I have to see the guy that landed you. Never -- never got married. Just had a ball. She's pretty sharp. She keeps me in my place. She's too much of her mother. Well, let's go have a cup of cop coffee or something and we'll continue. (A recess was taken.)</p>

                  <speaker>Robert Fischer</speaker>
                  <p>That was only six months into it. I'd been to these other big operations where we starve to death. You know? We started eating pretty good. This was down in the swamps. We were starting to eat pretty good down there.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Kelly Parker</speaker>

                  <speaker>Robert Fischer</speaker>
                  <p>I ate everything except a 1,000-day-old egg. I would not eat that.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Kelly Parker</speaker>
                  <p>What were you flipping open to? Were you going to show me something?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Robert Fischer</speaker>
                  <p>Yeah. I was going to show you -- in the beginning this is where my parachute didn't open at Fort Bragg.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Kelly Parker</speaker>
                  <p>How far did you fall?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Robert Fischer</speaker>
                  <p>I fell all the way down to 400 feet from the ground. That's -- that's -- I was -- I went through jump school at Fort Benning. And then this is -- this is a picture of me -- that should say me on there.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Kelly Parker</speaker>
                  <p>What was your jump? 10,000 feet or --</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Robert Fischer</speaker>
                  <p>No. No. We just jumped -- that day -- this is in the adviser course. I was at the adviser course. Those of us that were jump qualified could get our $110 by jumping out of an airplane. And I had jumped out of a caribou where the static line cable was on the ground on the lower part of the plane instead of up here, and it grabbed and my shoot opened. The back of my shoot came loose. That little pilot shoot popped open. And it was going to deploy in the plane, and I would have been hung up and beat up against the airplane and killed probably. The guy -- the guy behind me -- not this guy, but he's -- it might have been this guy. This guy hit me as hard as he could hit me and knocked me out of the plane. And I wasn't -- I just went flying. And because you don't have a position, the shoot does funny things. So the shoot did a cigarette role, and it rolls like this. And then it has to -- it has to do this all the way to the ground before it catches there. Well, I wound up catching there at 400 feet. Among my other fun things I did in my life, I was going to show you a picture of me with my counterpart in there and what it looks like. This -- this was in -- my newspaper editor from Dubuque, Iowa, came over; and this was the major I advised. This was me pretty skinny there, not all the way. And my mother sent this thing over, "I like little old ladies from Dubuque." She was called the little old lady from Dubuque. And we put it on the front of the Jeep and rode around. "I like little old ladies from Dubuque." And this is me -- this is me with -- we wore green berets. Vietnamese marines wore green berets before the Army U.S. Special Forces, who actually were some of the first advisers to the -- way back in the '50s we had Army advisers who saw that green beret, but -- it didn't become the special forces green beret, but they wore a green beret. They liked the color. But Vietnamese marines had worn it in their whole history from the time they were first formed. And everybody laughed. We wore a tiger suit. And we'd walk around Saigon going to Army camps. You'd see the special forces go by: What are you doing with our green beret? I said, We had it before you did. We had it before you did.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Kelly Parker</speaker>
                  <p>That's funny.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Robert Fischer</speaker>
                  <p>Well, being funny, I have to tell you some funny stuff too. Can't make it all serious. Went down to Vung Tau, which is right on the -- the tip -- right down on the ocean. And then it's about 40, 50 miles up to Saigon up the Long Tau and Soirop River, the rivers that go to Saigon. Well, this is down here; and this is where you're going to take off. And it's a big R and#38; R center, big hotels. And that's where they have nightclub shows and all kinds of -- you know, bars and R and#38; R -- in-country R and R. So I'm two days in country and I fly down to Vung Tau and I go there. And my task force guys that I'm going to go with, they're all getting smashed. And it's like six o'clock, seven o'clock at night. And I finally catch up with them at this R and#38; R hotel. And Larry Gabrey (ph), who was a friend of mine who was the task force adviser, and I was going to be his assistant for that thing. And they're having a ball, cooking steaks and crazy stuff. And the floor show that night is supposed to be American strippers doing -- doing a floor show. This is typical of an R and#38; R place. So we go in in our beautiful tiger suits, nine of us. And we're a little late, so there are no seats. We sit on this floor, like this around, and the tables - people at their cocktail tables are behind us. And one of my buddies, Mac Dooby (ph), is sloshed. He's probably on his second 5th by that time. And we're kind of -- kind of being obnoxious a little bit. And we advisers were kind of the cock of the walk. We were kind of respected. You know? You saw the Marine come in in his tiger suit, don't mess with us. You know? So we were sitting on the floor. And I'm two days in country, for God's sake, and I've got a brand-new, shiny tiger suit on. And Mack's raising hell with some guy behind him. Finally he just hits the table and sends the table flying over the guy and his wife. And it's John Steinbeck, the American author. No, this is no kidding. John Steinbeck. And I thought, Oh, my. I -- I recognized him. Steinbeck is a bull of a guy. He was coming after Dooby. Well, seven-foot Army colonel with his MPs throws us out. And we almost went to jail later that night. And then we got on Deckhouse V. We go on the operation ashore, and here comes the admiral flying in one day. And he's got a -- I'm there. Larry says, Well, I want you to host Commander Glenn Ford, the movie actor. Glenn Ford is on active-duty in the Reserve. And we'd rounded up about 25 enemies, suspects. And they're under a big tree about 100 yards away all tied up behind their back. And they're all squatting there in the shade. I'm supposed to take Commander Glenn Ford around and show him our -- what we've got. Well, it's not an awful lot. We're living in a pagoda because we know they wouldn't shell their own pagoda. That's where our hooch was at, basically the colonel. So I take Glenn Ford over to the 25 guys. I said, I'd like you to meet a few of my friends. Oh, I'd love to. And I get over to the Vietcong. And I said, These are our Vietcong suspects. And he turns white. And he gets out of there and goes for the chopper. And he's probably swearing all the way, That dumb SOB Marine major; he wants to get me killed. He didn't like going in the middle of the VC. We only had one guy guarding them. Some of the follies of wartime.</p>

                  <p>It's just -- there's so much -- there's so -- you know, when you read a book, it's like this happened and this happened on this date. And there's so much that goes on in between.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Robert Fischer</speaker>
                  <p>Well, it's -- but, see, that's the way -- one of my author buddies, I'm reviewing two of his books. He's writing a trilogy on Vietnam, and he says that very aptly. He's been interviewed with the three-star general. And three of them were at the same place, and they say we have different recollections. Each one of us have a different recollection of the same thing that happened.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Kelly Parker</speaker>
                  <p>Right.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Robert Fischer</speaker>
                  <p>And that's what the general said. That's the way it will be. You -- you won't have the same identical perception or understanding or knowledge of what I've got. You will have seen it different than what I did. And when you bring this synthesis together, it will eventually become a fuller story. But what happened to you didn't happen to me, didn't happen to him. And we have -- we have different experiences, even though we're in the same experience.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Kelly Parker</speaker>
                  <p>When you slept at night, what were the sounds that you heard?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Robert Fischer</speaker>
                  <p>I had a hammock -- I was dumb enough to take on my first big operation on Junction City where we went the 75 miles along the Ho Chi Minh Trail -- and that's when we were eating the -- anything we could catch and eat. That's where we lost all the weight and drank the filthy water. And I took an air mattress with me. And we had a cowboy that carries your pack, puts your bed down, and does all this for you. Well, my cowboy didn't like me worth a damn. He was a volunteer, and he didn't want to be a cowboy. I said, I'll carry my own pack. Well, in the Vietnamese Marine Corps, you do not -- officers do not carry their own pack. You have a batman, like the Brits have -- a batman, a sideboy, who handles your stuff. And all you carry is just your weapon. You don't touch your radio. You have a radioman.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Kelly Parker</speaker>
                  <p>That's due to your rank, right?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Robert Fischer</speaker>
                  <p>It's due to the fact you're an officer. The Vietnamese would be insulted if I carried my own pack. They wouldn't like that. There's hundreds and hundreds of things you have to know -- like I said, 30 days. Anyway, on the operation we -- we were -- we were 40 days in that jungle. And we come out -- we found an overlay of an enemy -- enemy -- North Vietnamese overlay that you put over another map. And you put the overlay over and it's got markings on it that shows you where their camps are at. Their camps were always where a stream or a trail came together.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Kelly Parker</speaker>
                  <p>Where did you find it?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Robert Fischer</speaker>
                  <p>Well, we accidentally -- we were coming down there with 40,000 of us. There were -- let's see. 1,500 of us were Vietnamese marines. We were the point going in one direction, the 173rd. We had -- we had 40,000 different U.S. Army and the Vietnamese marine units in there. We'd come across these camps that sometimes -- that's why I said I got to eat. There was the big bags of rice and the Chinese pigs and the bicycles and everything else there. And then the trails are just like four or five feet wide, and there are dozens and dozens of them all through this area. That's how the logistics came in. That's how their ammunitions came in -- on trains and trains of women and old men and anybody that could carry this stuff through the jungle. For 100-some miles they would carry this along. So we'd find these camps, and we'd eat well. We'd have enough rice for another week. One of these camps we came into was just dumbfounding. We walked in, and it was carved out of the jungle. The double canopy jungle was up like 150 feet in the air. Then there's an undergrowth that goes higher than the ceiling, that goes under it. When you take that away, you carve this out, you've got yourself a kind of nice big chamber. But when the sun goes down at night, it becomes darn dark, because there's jungle up above it. There was a volleyball court, a beautiful, magnificent volleyball court that they'd made out of vines. There was a scorer's chair. And they -- we all -- it was a beautifully carved, flat clay -- you know, they're playing volleyball in the jungle. It's one of their -- one of their camps that they go along, one of the thousand camps that they had on the trail that they'd bring all their -- the North Vietnamese would come down to as they're sweeping through South Vietnam. We were mad because they took the volleyball. So we had to take the two liners of a helmet that were plastic, and we taped them together with our usual duct tape that we always had. And we were playing volleyball with the two helmet liners taped together.</p>

                  <speaker>Erin Valenti</speaker>
                  <p>How long were you in Vietnam in total?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Robert Fischer</speaker>
                  <p>I was in December '66 to January '68, just a little over a year. But I'd been in southeast Asia two years earlier than that. And I studied Vietnam, too, with one of the insurgencies. But that's some of the humor that you have out there. It's -- it's bizarre, but that's the way it was.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Kelly Parker</speaker>
                  <p>They would just stop and play volleyball and continue?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Robert Fischer</speaker>
                  <p>No. They had big camps. They could go underground from the B-52 strikes. We found in that same camp they could put a whole company of 200 underneath the ground. And they could go down 30, 40 feet under the ground in chambers and hide when the B-52s would blow the jungle apart. You know? And that's how we got our fresh water, in some of those craters. And it was amazing that that was a major staging camp for up to 200 -- probably 200. And as soon as they hear -- you didn't hear a B-52.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Kelly Parker</speaker>
                  <p>No. You heard the bomb, right?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Robert Fischer</speaker>
                  <p>Well, you heard -- you're walking along like we did in Bong Son. I'm out walking along with my battalion, you know -- and walking is about it. All of a sudden it's "ark light." Holy cats. What that means is B-52 bombs are going to fall near you right now. Right now. And you don't see the B-52. It's way the devil up there. And all of a sudden the whole hills, 2,000 meters from you, they just start exploding. And you're dancing. You're standing there bouncing away. And it's pucker time. You say, How do they know they're going to hit that?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Kelly Parker</speaker>
                  <p>I know. Exactly.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Robert Fischer</speaker>
                  <p>Well, worse yet is when you are under your own -- my first experience in combat, the lieutenant of mine, Herk, was up one of the battalions. And the U.S. Army had seven big-fire basins, seven big artillery fire basins that surrounded us. That's like one big --big 155s, 105. Big canon. They're in basins. One here. Seven of them all the way around. And you're coming down through the trail, and they're firing -- initially they're firing what they call harassing and interdiction, H and I. And that's -- at night they're popping it out a thousand or so yards just at random to keep the enemy off guard. Well, we must have moved too fast in the first week. Because it's night. I got an Army liaison team with me. But Herk's up ahead of me, and he's screaming at me. He said, We're taking incoming. And I said, What? And whoa. You hear the -- the 155s that blow -- the ones they make IEDs out of in Iraq that blow whole Humvees away. You hear this big whumping going on. And I said, Herk -- the liaison team said, They know where we're at; they got us plotted. Well, they didn't have us plotted. We were up a couple thousand meters ahead of where they thought we were. And they was dropping on us. So Herk starts screaming me out. He says, Damn, I've been in Korea; I ought to know incoming when I see it. So I -- I finally told this guy check fire, get -- call it off. And the last ones are coming down. Here comes Herk down the trail about 20 minutes later out of the dark, and he's got a big poncho, he's got a big slab of steel from the side of one of these artillery rounds still hot. He says, That close enough?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Erin Valenti</speaker>
                  <p>Do you still keep in contact with anybody?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Robert Fischer</speaker>
                  <p>Yeah. I called them when I went through -- we have adviser conventions, and we sit around telling war lies. The stories get better the older you get. But they're true. Most all of them are true, because your buddies are going to read them.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Kelly Parker</speaker>
                  <p>They're going to know you're --</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Robert Fischer</speaker>
                  <p>They're going to know. Yeah. It was bizarre enough. You didn't have to exaggerate.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Kelly Parker</speaker>
                  <p>I just -- what did it -- what did -- what did it smell like in the jungle?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Robert Fischer</speaker>
                  <p>Rotten.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Kelly Parker</speaker>
                  <p>Rotten like --</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Robert Fischer</speaker>
                  <p>Yep. Well, not the dead. When you -- when the B-52s hit the targets, you knew it; and you didn't go and take water out of the B-52 holes in those places because they either hit animals or human or something like that. But it's -- it's very rare. It's very -- it's very rare that you would run into that, quite frankly. I was never in any real major battles, I mean, like you read -- like you see in the movies or the -- where -- We Were Soldiers, where they got hundreds and hundreds coming at them.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Kelly Parker</speaker>
                  <p>Because of your rank. Yeah.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Robert Fischer</speaker>
                  <p>Well, because of the fact that we were big operations and with big units. And they aren't going to stand there and wait for us to come find them. They don't do that. But my -- my real experience was hunting the guerilla camps in the 400-square-mile swamp. And that was OK Corral time where you fight -- hunt them with a chopper at 100 feet. We got 28 camps. It's wild. That's hairy. That's where majors get involved. Herk and I went out and cleaned out all kinds of camps at 100 feet. But, see, go by them at 100 feet, they can't see you; you're coming like this. You can see them, but they can't see to fix on you because you're going by too fast.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Kelly Parker</speaker>
                  <p>So would you just bomb them or --</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Robert Fischer</speaker>
                  <p>You'd throw a hand grenade out this door and a smoke grenade out that door. And we had 40 little boats that had nine Marines each, and we had them saturated, scattered out here. We'd hunt for hours to find -- we'd spot a camp and then we'd go in and scare the hell out of what's in the camp. You know, because they'd run for cover. And then we'd bring our boats in and lower gasoline drums and burn them out. That -- that was -- that was hands-on, OK Corral time. That was fun. 90 days of it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Kelly Parker</speaker>
                  <p>Was there a lot of American-Vietnamese babies born? A lot of --</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Robert Fischer</speaker>
                  <p>I just had the real pleasure of -- my fourth grandchild is a gorgeous little Vietnamese girl. Yeah. I talked my stepson and his wife into adopting a Vietnamese. She was born right here in Denver. She's a smasher. She's six months old, and she's going to be an athlete -- I'm taking her back to the wedding. My two granddaughters are ecstatic. They're just -- I lived with these little babies and kids in the villages. I had pictures there. And if you ever notice, in the picture of this right here, guess who does all the work. See the girls? They're carrying the babies. The mother -- the mama, the Ba -- the wife, Ba, mother, Ba, mamas working, like this page here. She's working. She's doing something during the day.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Kelly Parker</speaker>
                  <p>And the little ones --</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Robert Fischer</speaker>
                  <p>And these little ones are all being cared for by these little girls that are as young as seven or eight years old. They're carrying their little brothers and sisters on their hip. That's what you see all the time. I lived with these little kids. Funny story. I used to -- lived in one village, in Xuan Loc outside Saigon. And that's what was nice, because they had farms out there and they'd have eggs. And you'd get some beef. You lived better -- the nearer you got to Saigon, the better you lived by going down to the local stores and stuff and bringing back stuff. And the mother had -- I lived on this -- just off the edge. We'd always move into the people's homes, in fact, and then they'd move back in the back of the house. That's the way it was done. You never pitched a tent over here. When the major said we're going to go to the village, you went in the village and you picked out a nice house. And he went in and got the bed, and I rigged my hammock on the front porch all the time. I just didn't want to go inside. So we'd do that little trick. And she had two little girls. Beautiful little, bitty girls. Like, they were about four, five years old. And I went to Saigon. I could pop into Saigon, and I'd bring them back rubber dolls. I'd always give these little girls those cute little rubber dolls that you pull the arms off of and the heads off of. You know, the pop, pop. And they figured out that those arms would come off. And I'm in my hammock -- you know, like this here. And here they'd come with the doll with the legs off, the heads off. I'm fixing dolls all day long. And I'm showing -- I'm showing the mother, Well, here's my little four; they're down in Australia with their mother. And I had just the same age. I had little, bitty girls the same -- cute. And it was kind of fun. She'd just say, Don't you bother the covan; don't you bother covan. I said, This isn't bothering me; this is delightful. All day long with the dolls.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Kelly Parker</speaker>
                  <p>Yeah, exactly. So earlier you said you drank water and you were exposed to Agent Orange?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Robert Fischer</speaker>
                  <p>Well, I was in Agent Orange areas for seven of my -- seven of the months I was there. Out of 13 months I was in Agent Orange areas. That was where we went. That was where we operated. And there'd be -- there'd be some -- some of it would have filtered into the waters and the streams. And we walked in the streams, and we -- we were forced to drink the filthy spring water many times. You have to drink about two or three canteens a day, otherwise you'd dehydrate. Then you were gone; you're useless. So my sister sent lemonade packets. I -- hell, I had 50 of those in my pack. And I'd have the halazone tablets. Halazone only kills about half of what's in the water. Nothing touches Agent Orange. So I got the nerves -- I got the nerve side. I didn't get the cancer side, thank God. There was five things that happen from Agent Orange. And mine happened to be up in the nerve system, which I had three major collapses. Because your vegas nerve will quit on you, and you'll have a major collapse, which happened to me three times. And they swear it's a massive heart attack until you finally explain to the naval war college doctor or to my doctor in Virginia or out here that no, it's the collapse of my nerve system. Because what it does, it just deteriorates your nervous system. And then that reduces your immune system. And then you've got allergies. Then you got colds. Then you got to fight all that. So it's a constant fight against rust and corrosion. That's one of the other kind of prices you pay with that -- with that kind of -- we lost a lot of guys to liver flukes. It got up in their livers.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Kelly Parker</speaker>
                  <p>Was that from the food or the water or --</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Robert Fischer</speaker>
                  <p>The filthy stuff in the streams and the waters. Dysentery, amoebic dysentery. The -- there's all kind of diseases. Snakebites, spider bites. We lost a lot of guys that had to be taken out of the country because of that. I never got shot, thank God. I was shot at, but I never got shot and hit. That boy in there, that Corpsman, he's -- he was a Corpsman out in Korea. He was hit I don't know how many times. He saved so many lives. Scotty. I'd keep him close at hand. Every Marine has to have his Corpsman nearby. I was going to tell you about the sleeping in the hammock. You asked a question. I was on Junction City when we found the big camp, the volleyball court and all that stuff. I was sleeping -- I was about a week or so into the operation. It was 40 days long. I'd just blow my air mattress up, and I'd sleep on that at night. You know, nice and comfortable. And we'd take our boots off. The U.S. Marines kept theirs on and got jungle rot and everything. We'd take ours off and put shower shoes on. I learned that from the Vietnamese. They said, How come your feet are good? They brought a guy in the operation, guy named Major Reed. How come your feet aren't -- I said, We take our boots off. Well, what if you have an attack? I said, Hell, I got shower shoes on; I'll run in my shower shoes. But I learned, because when I -- I didn't have trouble in Junction City. It's when I came off of there and went down into one of these villages. I'd not been in the villages. I'd been on major operations for the first four or five months. All of sudden I'm in a village, and I put it down on the front porch, and a rat this big runs right up the middle of me. And in Junction City they said, Did you see the cobra last night? And everybody else is in hammocks, and I finally -- Herk finally says to me, Major, I think I'd get up off the ground if I were you. So I eventually got my hammock and I could -- I could turn over in that hammock at night, I got so expert in it. You can rig it between trees so it becomes a seat. It becomes your whole life. That hammock is just --</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Kelly Parker</speaker>
                  <p>You could turn over without flipping?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Robert Fischer</speaker>
                  <p>I could turn over. You grab a hammock and you turn. And you can turn yourself in a nylon hammock. You can turn over in the night. You don't have to just stay like this. You learn to do a lot of tricks. And that was my bed for nine months. Yep, that became my bed. And that's how we had to sleep, because there were lots of snakes over there, and too many rats. Too many rats. One with claws right through the middle of you and you say that's it. See, we didn't live like the Americans lived. The Americans lived -- they could go back and they could have hot chow. They'd have -- the Army would have it flown to the field in the hot containers. They could have hot meals. Heck, even their MREs, the -- the -- the rations that they could open. My God, they were edible. We had nothing. We had zero. We had no supply system. So we lived off the land. We survived. If we were near a vil or if we were off near the coast like we were in Bong Son -- now, that was neat. Bong Son -- the colonel and his party would go down to the beach, and we'd start a big fire. And what kind of fish you wanted today? Well, what do you have? Well, we don't know. And we'd borrow a sampan from the village, and three little Marines would get in it and go straight out to the sea and throw a hand grenade every 50 feet. Bloop, here's a big tuna. Bloop, there's a turtle. There's a sea bass. Take your pick. And then we'd cook -- we'd cook a fire -- put a fire on. We'd have magnificent feed just eating a nice succulent fish.</p>

                  <p>Some do, when they cooked them in a different way. We just stuck ours with a stick through it and barbecued it and take the scales off and eat it. That was delicious. I --</p>

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Robert Fischer</speaker>
                  <p>Yeah. My -- she was an Aussie, and her parents lived in Sydney. And they asked her to come home that year so they could have the grandkids. They'd -- they'd come to Japan when we had two little girls, and they'd come over to the States. But they'd never had them in Australia. So they lived there the year I was in Vietnam. That was -- that was neat. Then I went down and picked them up and we got an Air Force -- great Air Force colonel gave us six seats to fly back to Hawaii and catch the U.S. flight that I raided. And we stayed up -- we stayed a week in Hawaii and had a ball with four little girls. Then we wound up -- I wound up going to upstate New York for my master's degree in the middle of freezing winter. Wow. And my mother was so great. She had Santa Claus come January 6th. She had my neighbor, Roger Kuch, put on -- he was a Santa Claus guy, and he dressed the whole thing. And she had full -- let's see. He came with his tinkle bell, sleigh, the noise outside. And the little girls are just -- my little one was only two -- and three, five, and eight. Something like that. And their eyes just opened. Here comes Santa Claus.</p>

                  <speaker>Robert Fischer</speaker>
                  <p>No. I just carried the pictures of my kids, my wife and my kids. Just mostly to see -- to have some remembrance of that. You carried your wallet. And I -- I didn't -- I didn't have any talismans or any belief in that kind of stuff. I mean, you're lucky enough -- you're lucky enough if you got out of the place without getting zapped.</p>

                  <speaker>Kelly Parker</speaker>
                  <p>A Huey?</p>

                  <speaker>Robert Fischer</speaker>
                  <p>A Huey. 360 hours. I tell Scotty -- and I have sat down in Pendleton when we visited the young Marines that were going back for their third time, many of them, last year. And we -- and we would sit down and talk to them. And I said, What's it like out there the second time or the third time? They said, It's a pucker, sir. And I said, Yeah, there are mornings you don't want to go out. So we would compare notes. He'd go on patrols in Korea and see his best friends killed and all kinds of horror stuff that he went through. And I'd say, Yeah, some mornings you got up and you were a coward. You were. You got up -- you weren't a quitting coward, but you were puckered up so bad that you didn't want to go hunt Cong that morning. I mean, you didn't want to go out that day and do it, because the day before they probably hit you with a tree Claymore, which spayed you with these steel bullets and BBs and chopper or -- oh, it got close sometimes. (There was an interruption at the door.)</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Robert Fischer</speaker>
                  <p>Okay. Let me wrap it up this way. Okay. I'll wrap it up for you. Was it worth it, Vietnam? Absolutely. I am the adviser to the Vietnamese community of Denver, 25,000. I'm their covan. And that's an experience in itself too. It's like herding cats at times. Because they are -- they're still as diverse and different and emotional and -- but they're wonderful, wonderful people. And what's happened, thank God, is that South Vietnam now has become probably the third or fourth most prosperous nation in southeast -- in Asia, along with the Chinese. Extremely productive, powerful place. And they keep saying, You want to go back? I say, No, that wouldn't be the Vietnam I knew 30-some years ago. Mine was villages, and Saigon was a shambles. And Nha Bay is all factories and modern condos. And guess who the work force is for the South Vietnamese in all these factories in and around Saigon? The North Vietnamese, who are still suffering from the war povertywise. Wouldn't go capitalistic like North Korea (sic). And South Vietnam is booming. People are investing -- from all over the world are investing in the place. A friend of mine just brought me -- my wife Karen -- I remarried in '95 -- and brought my wife Karen $400-a-pound tea. The most exotic tea in the world is grown on the slopes of -- up north towards North Vietnam. And I said, Well, you know what's going to happen. Just like you go down to the church, Queen of Martyrs, you get in there and you see all the young Vietnamese kids like my itty, bitty granddaughter I got now. When she's six, seven, 18, speaks no Vietnamese, speak only English. They're the modern, young -- young -- they're the most modern young girls and boys you ever saw. They're American. Total American. Everything about them is American. The iPods, the whole bit. There's no Vietnam to them. They don't understand the Vietnam of their fathers, because they can't speak the language, and -- and they don't like to go back in the stories either. So what's happening in Vietnam, that same kind of young person is going to grow up and say to that former 80-year-old communist who's still trying to put the pressure on and control Saigon, Uh-huh, I don't want any more of you. And it's not going to be a physical military revolution. It's going to be just a natural social revolution where the young people are going to come up and say, Uh-uh, I've had enough. They won't even have to vote. The majority of them are going to be like our baby boomers. And that -- they're already in their 20s and 30s, and they're already rejecting the hard-line communists. Communists have backed off and said, Well, gee, it's so prosperous, let's let them alone. So you go to Vietnam -- according to my friend who just came back, he said on the back of the taxi cab seats is the American flag. In Saigon, which they call Ho Chi Minh City, it's now called Saigon again all over South Vietnam.</p>
