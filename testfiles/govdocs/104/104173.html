after evidentiary hearings, the magistrate entered an Opinion and
Order granting the preliminary injunction on the ground that Hydro-Stop had terminated the Distribution Agreement without just cause. 
On March 3, 2005, Hydro-Stop filed a Motion Requesting
Reconsideration and/or to Alter or Amend Judgment pursuant to Rule
52(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  On March 8, the
magistrate denied the motion, and on March 28, 2005 Hydro-Stop

roof sealants and waterproofing products in Puerto Rico since 1997. 
In 1999, Waterproofing began to distribute Hydro-Stop's products in
Puerto Rico pursuant to a verbal agreement between the two
companies.  On January 1, 2000, Hydro-Stop and Waterproofing
entered into the Distribution Agreement which designated
Waterproofing as Hydro-Stop's exclusive distributor in Puerto Rico.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.416667in"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Until Hydro-Stop terminated the Distribution Agreement in
March 2004, Waterproofing was responsible for all sales of Hydro-Stop products in Puerto Rico.  Waterproofing consistently exceeded
the annual sales quotas set forth in the Distribution Agreement,
and for the past five years Waterproofing has had higher sales than
any other Hydro-Stop distributor in the world.  During the past
five years, Hydro-Stop has earned profits of at least $1.5 million
from Waterproofing's sales.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.416667in"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>As part of their ordinary business relationship, Hydro-Stop normally extended credit to Waterproofing for the purchase of
Hydro-Stop products.  When Waterproofing's debt reached $200,000 in
2001, Hydro-Stop advised that it would extend no further credit
until the debt was repaid.  In order to pay down the debt,
Waterproofing agreed to pay a "premium" of $15 per pail of Hydro-Stop product, and by early 2003, the outstanding debt had been
reduced to $35,000.  In late 2002 or early 2003, Hydro-Stop
reinstated the credit line available to Waterproofing, up to a
limit of $100,000.</span></span></p>

Charleston, South Carolina, Hydro-Stop advised Waterproofing of its
intent to abrogate the exclusivity of the Distribution Agreement
and to distribute Hydro-Stop products directly in Puerto Rico. 
Waterproofing objected, but Hydro-Stop began making direct sales of
its products in Puerto Rico, at discounted prices and with credit
terms that Waterproofing could not match.  Hydro-Stop's direct
sales yielded nearly twice the gross profits as those in which
Waterproofing served as intermediary.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.416667in"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>In late 2003, when Waterproofing had reached its $100,000
credit limit, it advised Hydro-Stop of a profitable opportunity to
contract with Promo Export, an agency of the Government of Puerto
Rico ("Promo Export Project").  Hydro-Stop would provide the
materials, and Waterproofing would provide the labor to complete
the job.  Hydro-Stop advanced Waterproofing a total of $69,200.50
for materials necessary for Phases I and II of the three-phase
project.  To guarantee that Hydro-Stop would be repaid, the three
parties entered into an agreement, pursuant to which Promo Export
was to issue joint checks payable to both Waterproofing and Hydro-Stop for the work performed for the Promo Export Project ("Joint
Check Agreement").</span></span></p>

I, Promo Export issued the first check, payable jointly to Hydro-Stop and Waterproofing, in the amount of $88,590.60.  Waterproofing
President Luis Esteves IV ("Esteves") endorsed the check with
Waterproofing's name <span style="text-decoration: underline">and</span> Hydro-Stop's name and deposited it in
Waterproofing's account in Puerto Rico.  On March 8, 2004, Esteves
obtained a manager's check from Westernbank in Puerto Rico, payable
jointly to Hydro-Stop and Waterproofing, in the amount of
$66,442.95.  Esteves sent the check to Hydro-Stop with a letter,
dated March 5, 2004, authorizing Hydro-Stop to cash the check.</span></span></p>

issue of just cause under Law 75 is a question of fact reviewable

Waterproofing was often late in its payments to Hydro-Stop, and the
magistrate concluded that because Hydro-Stop had not previously
terminated the Distribution Agreement because of late payment, it
could not suddenly change course without violating the principle
enshrined in Law 75.  In short, the magistrate held that "what was
not just cause then is not just cause now."  We find this
conclusion troubling.</span></span></p>

Waterproofing alleges -- and the magistrate seems to have agreed --
that Hydro-Stop did not care about Waterproofing's late payments,
and thus that the late payments did not constitute just cause for
termination of the Distribution Agreement.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.416667in"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>For its part, Hydro-Stop alleges that Waterproofing's
persistent cash flow problems led to a pattern of continuously late
payments during the course of their relationship, and that it was
forced to go to great lengths in order to keep Waterproofing
afloat, including extending credit, creating payment plans, and
granting special concessions.  At one point, Hydro-Stop President
Nicholas Causey ("Causey") made a personal loan of $80,000 to
Waterproofing's vice president so that Waterproofing could pay off
some of its outstanding debt.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.416667in"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>These efforts indicate that far from "not caring" about
the payment schedule, Hydro-Stop was in fact actively engaged with
the project of trying to reduce Waterproofing's ever-growing debt. 
It may well be that Hydro-Stop was willing to overlook the untimely
payments because of Waterproofing's successful sales records for
the first four years of their relationship.  However, we think it
quite possible that there was a limit to the supplier's patience. 
In March 2004, when Hydro-Stop unilaterally terminated the
Distribution Agreement, Waterproofing owed Hydro-Stop more than
$120,000.  Despite the fact that the payment term was then 60 days,
more than $30,000 had been outstanding for longer than that period. 
The magistrate would have us hold that while Waterproofing's
indebtedness in March 2004 might have constituted just cause if it
had been the first such occurrence, it could not legitimately have
been the proverbial straw to break the camel's back.  We disagree. 
It is contrary to the principle enshrined in Law 75 to require that
suppliers terminate distribution agreements immediately upon
distributors' failure to pay timely, or risk being forever banned
from so doing.  Such a result would discourage efforts on the part
of suppliers to reach creative solutions to enable the success of
long-term relationships with distributors in Puerto Rico.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.416667in"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Despite our disagreement with the magistrate's disposal
of Hydro-Stop's claim of just cause on the basis of 
Waterproofing's failure to pay timely, our standard of review is
for clear error, which we do not find here.  Although we can
imagine a situation in which a distributor does not take action to
terminate its relationship with a supplier for late payments until
many such occurrences have genuinely exhausted its patience, there
is sufficient evidence on the record to support the magistrate's
conclusion that this was not such a situation.  Despite Hydro-Stop's allegations to the effect that Waterproofing "continuously"
failed to make timely payment during the course of their business
relationship, in a letter dated March 2002, Causey congratulated
Waterproofing on an "extraordinary job . . . [F]or the second year
in a row Waterproofing Systems is at the top of the list of all our
distributors in total sales."  We find no hint of dissatisfaction
in those words.  And in November 2003, when Hydro-Stop first
informed Waterproofing of its intention to abrogate the exclusivity
of the Distribution Agreement so that it could distribute Hydro-Stop products directly in Puerto Rico, Waterproofing was within its
credit limit and current in its payments.  In that month, despite
Waterproofing's rejection of the proposed change and without its
knowledge, Hydro-Stop -- through its own agent in Puerto Rico --
began making direct sales of its products to Waterproofing's
customers, at discounted prices and with credit terms that
Waterproofing could not match.  Furthermore, Hydro-Stop's agent
advised some of Waterproofing's customers that Waterproofing was no
longer Hydro-Stop's distributor in Puerto Rico.  Hydro-Stop's
incentive was clear -- its direct sales yielded double the gross
profits that Waterproofing's sales brought in.  It was in this
context that Waterproofing first approached Hydro-Stop with the
Promo Export Project proposal.  After hearing testimony from both
parties, the magistrate credited Waterproofing's theory that Hydro-Stop's claim of just cause on the basis of late payments was merely
a pretext for abrogating the Distribution Agreement.  We find no
reason to upset the lower court's determination.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 0.416667in"><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Hydro-Stop also alleges just cause to terminate the
Distribution Agreement because of Waterproofing's endorsement and
deposit of the Promo Export check, and subsequent retention of
funds.  The magistrate found that it was common practice between
the parties for Waterproofing to accept and deposit checks issued
to both companies and to remit payment to Hydro-Stop, and thus that
such action with regard to the Promo Export check was not
fraudulent.  On appeal, Hydro-Stop contends that this finding is
not supported by the record and constitutes "clear error."  Hydro-Stop's argument to this end proceeds in three parts: first that
Waterproofing's endorsement and deposit of the Promo Export check
was illegal under Puerto Rico Law; next that Waterproofing's
actions breached the Joint Check Agreement; and finally that
Waterproofing's breach of the Joint Check Agreement was in bad
faith, thus constituting just cause for terminating the
Distribution Agreement.</span></span></p>

that all checks from the Promo Export project be "jointly payable"
to both parties.  It is silent as to the question of whether either 
party was prohibited from unilaterally endorsing and depositing

the parties and found "credible evidence" that this very sequence
of events had been repeated at least one hundred times during the
course of their relationship.</span></span>

"[Hydro-Stop's president] never voiced an objection [to the
practice] as long as Hydro-Stop was paid by Waterproofing."  It is
difficult to understand why, if Hydro-Stop wanted to see an end to
this practice, it was not specifically addressed in the Joint Check
Agreement or another agreement between the parties.</span></span></p>

Joint Check Agreement by retaining some of the funds derived from
the Promo Export check.   Hydro-Stop insists that the entirety of
the difference between the amount of the Promo Export check and the
amount of the Westernbank manager's check -- $22,147.65 --
constituted misappropriated funds.  By contrast, the magistrate
found that the amount of the manager's check was only $2,757.55
less than the <span style="text-decoration: underline">total</span> amount -- $69,200.50 -- Waterproofing owed
Hydro-Stop for materials used in both Phase I and II despite the
fact that the Promo Export check was payment for Phase I only.  In
other words, Waterproofing claims -- and the magistrate agreed --
that the manager's check actually reflected a seven-month advance
payment to Hydro-Stop for materials used in Phase II.  The Joint
Check Agreement provides only that Waterproofing "remains fully
liable to Hydro-Stop for payment for materials."  Nowhere in the
Joint Check agreement or in any other written agreement before this
Court is there any provision as to the payment schedule for the
remainder of the proceeds from the Promo Export project.  As
evidence that Waterproofing misappropriated more than $20,000,
Hydro-Stop merely directs our attention to the testimony of Causey
and co-owner, Richard Daniel ("Daniel"), who attested to Hydro-Stop's interpretation of the Joint Check Agreement, according to
which Waterproofing was obligated to sign each check received from
the Promo Export project and physically send the signed instrument
to Hydro-Stop for deposit in Hydro-Stop's account.  Hydro-Stop
fails to develop any argument that might enable us to find error in
the magistrate's decision with regard to the alleged
misappropriation.</span></span></p>

Puerto Rico law, there is <span style="text-decoration: underline">dolus</span>, or "bad faith" when a party has

bad faith when he "unilaterally decided to fraudulently endorse"
the Promo Export check and then "attempt[ed] to conceal" his
actions.  As evidence, Hydro-Stop points to Esteves's admission
that after endorsing and depositing the Promo Export check, he
purchased a manager's check from Westernbank in Puerto Rico, made
payable to both Hydro-Stop and Waterproofing, which he then
endorsed and sent to Hydro-Stop.  From this, Hydro-Stop concludes
that Esteves willingly and knowingly violated his legal obligation,
contending that "[t]he intent was obvious, to pass off Westernbank
Manager's Check as the Promo Export check."  The threshold inquiry
in determining whether Esteves acted in bad faith is whether he
failed to comply with a legal obligation.  Because we find that he
was neither prohibited from endorsing and depositing the check nor
obligated to remit the totality of the proceeds to Hydro-Stop, we
find that he could not have acted in bad faith.</span></span></p>

that public policy considerations militate in favor of the
continued operation of the Distribution Agreement, we turn to the
interests of the parties to determine whether a preliminary
injunction is appropriate.  Hydro-Stop is an international company
with annual revenues of more than $7.5 million annually, whose
revenues have steadily increased since it entered into the
Distribution Agreement with Waterproofing, in large part because of
the latter's success in creating a market for Hydro-Stop products
in Puerto Rico.  By contrast, Waterproofing is a small, closely
held family business which relies almost exclusively on its sale of
Hydro-Stop products.  Since Hydro-Stop began selling its products
directly to Waterproofing clients in Puerto Rico, Waterproofing has
been forced to lay off 127 employees.  The magistrate found that
Hydro-Stop's actions have already clearly and unequivocally harmed
Waterproofing's reputation in Puerto Rico.   We accord considerable
deference to the magistrate's judgment that the balance of the
parties' interests with regard to a preliminary injunction favors
Waterproofing.   Although the traditional common law test for a
preliminary injunction does not apply here, we have found that "the
