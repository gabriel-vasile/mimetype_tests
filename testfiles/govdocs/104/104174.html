<h1>Roofing/Waterproofing Quality Assurance Checklist</h1>

<font face="Times" size="3"><center>Note: This checklist applied to both &#8220;Roofing&#8221; and &#8220;Waterproofing&#8221; as applicable</center></font>

<h2>Predesign</h2>

<ul>
<li class="new">Required deliverables submitted</li>
</ul>

<br>
<h2>Schematic Design</h2>

<ul>
<li class="new">Required deliverables submitted</li>
<li class="new">Roof/waterproofing assembly(ies) appropriate for the building’s intended use, location and design life expectancy</li>
<li class="new">Roof/waterproofing assembly(ies) appropriate for deck type, slope, fire, wind hail, uplift and thermal requirements, vapor control, environmental requirements and cost</li>
<li class="new">Roof/waterproofing assembly(ies) application appropriate for climate locations considering hot and cold temperatures, wind, and precipitation</li>
<li class="new">For low slope roofs, 2-ply modified bitumen and a single ply membrane is the system of choice. Use a modified bitumen roof in areas that require high puncture resistance, exposure to abuse or need frequent access to maintain mechanical equipment. Use a single ply membrane on complex configured roofs, roof with many penetrations or when roof access needs are minimal</li>
<li class="new">Avoid ballasted, sprayed polyurethane foam, APP modified bitumen or cement composite roofs</li>
<li class="new">Consider steep slope roofing systems whenever feasible</li>
<li class="new">In high snow areas, avoid steep pitch roofs that shed snow over doors and windows. Design building shapes and roof configurations to minimize damage from sliding snow/ice to the roof itself, dormers and pipe penetrations</li>
<li class="new">Use cold roof techniques in areas where snow and ice can accumulate on the roof.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>Design Development</h2>

<ul>
<li class="new">Required deliverables submitted</li>
<li class="new">Building Code compliance with fire rating classification, wind classification and hall rating</li>
<li class="new">Comply with NPS Roofing/Waterproofing design standards and National Roofing Contractors Association Roofing and Waterproofing Manual and International Building Code</li>
<li class="new">Provide wind uplift calculations based on ASCE 7. Specify roof systems that meet ASCE requirements</li>
<li class="new">Provide roof drainage calculations for sizing roof drains, leaders, downspouts and gutters</li>
<li class="new">Provide written documentation for determination of required roof fire rating class using procedures in IBC or NFPA</li>
<li class="new">Review building’s interior temperature and humidity conditions and climate to determine vapor barrier requirements. Calculate dew point location within the wall and roof assembly</li>
<li class="new">Determine compatibility of roof material with other materials that may settle onto the roof or flow off the roof</li>
<li class="new">Determine need for construction sequencing and the affect it will have on roof assembly selection</li>
<li class="new">Consider maintenance, repair and eventual reroofing (life cycle cost) in final selection of roofing system</li>
<li class="new">Obtain roof slope by constructing slope in structural system in lieu of tapered insulation boards or lightweight concrete fill</li>
<li class="new">Use of lightweight insulating concrete, gypsum fill or asphaltic perlite fill is not recommended unless the materials are extensively used in the project area and there is sufficient contractor competition</li>
<li class="new">Determine roof pitch after considering potential roof deflections, and existing structural deck conditions to insure positive drainage. For low slope roofs, maintain a minimum _&quot;/ft. roof slope and 1/8&quot;/ft. along valleys by using crickets and tapered insulation. For high slope roofs, consult with codes and roofing manufacturer’s limitations</li>
<li class="new">Review roof configuration and roof drainage layout to provide most efficient means to remove water</li>
<li class="new">Use internal roof drains in climates where freeze/thaw condition is prevalent. In freeze/thaw climates, locate gutters, downspouts, scuppers and drains in area which receive sunlight if possible</li>
<li class="new">Avoid built-in gutter systems in which drainage passes through or part of the interior spaces or is concealed in exterior wall cavity
<li class="new">Use sidewall louvers for intake and exhaust systems whenever possible</li>
<li class="new">Avoid rooftop mounted HVAC equipment when possible</li>
<li class="new">Buildings over 1 story should have an internal roof access means through a manufactured roof hatch</li>
<li class="new">Use of asphaltic and wood shingles and shakes in tropical climates shall be fungus resistive and wood shall be pressure treated</li>
<li class="new">When reroofing, provide field investigation of existing roof and deck construction and conditions. Identify existing materials and test suspect roofing materials for asbestos. Insure existing materials are suitable and compatible with proposed roof system</li>
<li class="new">Outline specs provided for all required sections</li>
</ul>
