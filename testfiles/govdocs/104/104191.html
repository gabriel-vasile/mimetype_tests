Memorial</U></B></FONT></P>

<P>1. <U>Western Waterproofing Company Makes a Study &amp;
Recommendations</U></P>

<P>Prange's efforts to check the seepage failed, and in March 1954 a
team of engineers from Western Waterproofing Company of St. Louis was
called in to study the memorial and make recommendations They found that
the structure showed signs of "excessive leakage" through the ceiling
over the enclosed circular promenade. Evidence of seepage was seen on
the "frieze, entablature, cornice, and parapets." The sheltered wall of
the memorial, behind the columns, seemed in "fair condition" as did most
of the columns. From the base of the columns to the promenade deck
around the building, the graduated base of the structure needed
weatherproofing. The retaining walls, balustrade, and coping that formed
the base of the structure were in need of extensive work.</P>

<P>To correct the conditions enumerated it was recommended that: (a) all
loose mortar in all horizontal and vertical joints be removed; (b) all
"horizontal areas, such as the top surface of the cornice, coping
stones, horizontal slabs of stone and all other mortar joints indicating
any movement or settlement" be stabilized; and (c) all items listed
under (b) be packed "full and deep" with Western Pli-A-Gum. After all
the loose mortar had been removed from all other mortar joints, the
cut-out areas should be replaced with Western's Dilato Expanding Mortar.
After the mortar had been replaced, the joints would be weather-proofed
with a fine grout coat, well scrubbed in with a small bristle brush. The
perimeter of all openings was to be recaulked after all old caulking was
removed. The estimated cost of this work was $11,500. [<A

<P>2. <U>The General Assembly Makes an Appropriation</U></P>

<P>a. <U>The Starrett and Stout Reports</U></P>

<P> An inspection by Bob Starrett in April resulted in a two fold
conclusion--the expansion damage was bad and the cost to effect repairs
would be great. He wondered where the money would come from, and who
would "catch Doxie when he comes 'flying off the mezzanine' after he
sees the estimate?" [<A HREF="hsrn.htm#766">66</A>] </P>

<P> Prange in June had Building Engineer Stout investigate the memorial
"with respect to . . . repairs to masonry walls as recommended by
Western Waterproofing Co. of St. Louis." It was agreed that the work was
necessary. If funds were available, Prange would like to schedule the
project for the autumn. [<A HREF="hsrn.htm#767">67</A>]</P>

<P>b. <U>The 1955 Session of the General Assembly Refuses to Act</U></P>

<P>No money was available, and Director Cougill in July included a
request to the State Budget Director for $23,500 for the George Rogers
Clark Memorial in Fiscal Years 1955 and 1956. This sum would be used f
or waterproofing, restoration of the Winter murals, and land
acquisition. [<A HREF="hsrn.htm#768">68</A>] The General Assembly
refused to act on this request in 1955.</P>

<P>c. <U>Joice's Report</U></P>

<P> While the legislature dragged its feet and refused to face the
issue, seepage became worse. In April 1956 when Bob Joice inspected the
roof, he saw that the caulking on the outside wall was falling out,
permitting water to enter around the entire dome. Water, about 12 hours
after a rain, would start seeping down the outside granite facing. No
leaks were found in the tunnel under the gravel covered built-up roof,
either during or after a rain. The tunnel walls, however, showed
evidence of "extreme amounts" of condensation at all times. [<A
HREF="hsrn.htm#769">69</A>] To illustrate what he had observed, Joice
prepared a sketch, a copy of which is found in this report.</P>

<P>d. <U>Budget Director Hardwick Approves the Request for
$25,000</U></P>

<P>In a successful effort to goad the General Assembly into action,
Chief Engineer Prange on October 17, 1957, forwarded to Director of the
Budget William H. Hardwick a copy of the report made by Western
Waterproofing Co. As Hardwick could see, the principal work consisted of
"pointing and waterproofing the masonry walls of the memorial which
included the large rotunda, the walls around the lower terrace, the
walls along the roadway of the east bridge approach and the two pylons
on the east side of the bridge."</P>

<P> On his May inspection of the structure, Prange had observed that the
deterioration of the masonry had progressed. Many of the large granite
blocks were beginning to push apart. Leaks in the terrace floor had
become so serious that much of the plaster in the basement rooms had
again fallen. Water had entered some of the electric conducts, causing
short circuits.</P>

<P> Western Waterproofing had estimated that the work would cost
$22,655, so Prange requested $25,000. [<A
HREF="hsrn.htm#770">70</A>]</P>

<P>3. <U>The 1958 Program</U></P>

<P>a. <U>Proposals are Invited</U></P>

<P>When it was learned in April 1958 that $25,000 had been appropriated
by the General Assembly for repairs to the memorial, the Conservation
Department invited bids, to be opened in Indianapolis on June 27, 1958.
Interested contractors were informed that all stone joints on the paved
promenade; the walls, curbs, and steps leading to the paved promenade;
the walls on the east approach to the memorial bridge, steps, base of
the flagpole, and pylons; and stone work near the Vigo statue, as well
as the steps and walls and two sets of steps at the railroad tracks,
were to be tuck-pointed with "non-staining mortar or filled with mortar
and then sealed with a synthetic rubber caulking compound." The
perimeter of all exterior doors and windows, along with other or
protrusions of the Memorial," were to be caulked. Expansion joints in
the black-topped promenade (which up to 1952 had been the handsome
pebble-concrete terrace) around the building were to be re-sealed. [<A
HREF="hsrn.htm#771">71</A>]</P>

<P>b. <U>Western Waterproofing Gets the Contract</U></P>

<P>When the bids were opened and abstracted at 10 a.m., on the 27th, by
the Director of Public Works and Supply, it was found that Western
Waterproofing's proposal of $18,926 was low. They were accordingly given
the contract.</P>

<P>Work was commenced in mid-July. Thiokol, a pliable plastic, was used
by Western Waterproofing in the top courses and some of the vertical
joints. It was applied with a caulking gun. Layers of latex rubber,
glass fabric, Dex-o-Tex, latex grout, and Jennite J-16 were used to seal
the joints on the promenade deck, after they had been caulked with
successive layers of oakum and caulking compound, volclay (bentonite),
and joint sealer. [<A HREF="hsrn.htm#772">72</A>] (Drawings showing the
method followed by Western Waterproofing in sealing the joints on the
promenade deck are found in this report.)</P>

<P> In mid-November 1958, one month after Western Waterproofing had
completed the project, Chief Engineer Prange and Bob Starrett chanced to
be in Vincennes, when there was a heavy downpour. The next after noon,
the 18th, an inspection was made by the custodian and no leaks found.
This was the first time since the memorial had become State property on
August 22, 1940, that the structure had not leaked. When he relayed this
information to Budget Director Hardwick, Director Cougill wrote, "We
hope that you will extend to the members of the Bureau our appreciation
for their sympathetic understanding of our problem and their recognition
of the needs of the Memorial." [<A HREF="hsrn.htm#773">73</A>] </P>

<P> In addition to the $18,926 paid Western Waterproofing, the
Department of Conservation expended out of the $25,000 allotment,
$1,423.70 for replastering the basement rooms and $681.39 for repairs to
the electrical installations. The unexpended balance, $3,500, was
transferred to the New Harmony account to be expended on restoration
projects at that State Park. [<A HREF="hsrn.htm#774">74</A>] </P>
