 RE:  EB-  04-  TC-  161 
 Dear  Correspondent: 
 This  is  an  official  CITATION,  issued  pursuant  to  section  503(  b)(  5)  of  the  Communications  Act  of  1934,  as  amended  (the  Act),  47  U.  S.  C.  §  503(  b)(  5),  for  violations  of  the 
 Act  and  the  Federal  Communications  Commission’s  rules  that  govern  telephone  solicitations  and  unsolicited  advertisements.  1  As  explained  below,  future  violations  of  the  Act  or  Commission’s 
 rules  in  this  regard  may  subject  your  company  to  monetary  forfeitures. 
 It  has  come  to  our  attention  that  your  company  apparently  sent  one  or  more  unsolicited  advertisements  to  telephone  facsimile  machines  in  violation  of  Section  227(  b)(  1)(  C)  of  the 
 Communications  Act  makes  it  “unlawful  for  any  person  within  the  United  States,  or  any  person  outside  the  United  States  if  the  recipient  is  within  the  United  States  .  .  .  to  use  a  telephone 
 facsimile  machine,  computer,  or  other  device  to  send  an  unsolicited  advertisement  to  a  telephone  facsimile  machine.”  2  The  term  “unsolicited  advertisement”  is  defined  in  the  Act  and  the 


 1  47  U.  S.  C.  §  227;  47  C.  F.  R.  §  64.  1200.  A  copy  of  these  provisions  is  enclosed  for  your  convenience.  Section  227 
 was  added  to  the  Communications  Act  by  the  Telephone  Consumer  Protection  Act  of  1991  and  is  most  commonly  known  as  the  TCPA.  The  TCPA  and  the  Commission’s  parallel  rules  restrict  a  variety  of  practices  that  are 


 associated  with  telephone  solicitation  and  use  of  the  telephone  network  to  deliver  unsolicited  advertisements,  including  fax  advertising. 


 2  47  U.  S.  C.  §  227(  b)(  1)(  C);  see  also  47  C.  F.  R.  §  64.  1200(  a)(  3)  (providing  that  no  person  or  entity  may  .  .  .  use  a 
 telephone  facsimile  machine,  computer,  or  other  device  to  send  an  unsolicited  advertisement  to  a  telephone  facsimile  machine).  Both  the  TCPA  and  the  Commission’s  rules  define  “telephone  facsimile  machine”  as  “equipment  which 


 has  the  capacity  to  transcribe  text  or  images,  or  both,  from  paper  into  an  electronic  signal  and  to  transmit  that  signal  over  a  regular  telephone  line,  or  to  transcribe  text  or  images  (or  both)  from  an  electronic  signal  received  over  a 
 regular  telephone  line  onto  paper.”  47  U.  S.  C.  §  227(  a)(  2);  47  C.  F.  R.  §  64.  1200(  f)(  8).  The  Commission  has  stated  that  “[  t]  he  TCPA’s  definition  of  ‘telephone  facsimile  machine’  broadly  applies  to  any  equipment  that  has  the 
 capacity  to  send  or  receive  text  or  images.”  Thus,  “faxes  sent  to  personal  computers  equipped  with,  or  attached  to,  modems  and  to  computerized  fax  servers  are  subject  to  the  TCPA’s  prohibition  on  unsolicited  faxes.  .  .  [although] 
 the  prohibition  does  not  extend  to  facsimile  messages  sent  as  email  over  the  Internet.”  Rules  and  Regulations  Implementing  the  Telephone  Consumer  Protection  Act  of  1991,  Report  and  Order,  18  FCC  Rcd  14014,  14131-  32 
 (2003)  (2003  TCPA  Report  and  Order).

 Commission’s  rules  as  “any  material  advertising  the  commercial  availability  or  quality  of  any  property,  goods,  or  services  which  is  transmitted  to  any  person  without  that  person’s  prior 
 express  invitation  or  permission.”  3  Under  Commission  rules  and  orders  currently  in  effect,  the  Commission  considers  an  established  business  relationship  between  a  fax  sender  and  recipient  to 
 constitute  prior  express  invitation  or  permission  to  send  a  facsimile  advertisement.  4  Mere  distribution  or  publication  of  a  fax  number,  however,  does  not  establish  consent  to  receive 
 advertisements  by  fax.  5 
 If,  after  receipt  of  this  citation,  you  violate  the  Communications  Act  or  the  Commission’s  rules  in  any  manner  described  herein,  the  Commission  may  impose 
 monetary  forfeitures  not  to  exceed  $11,000  for  each  such  violation  or  each  day  of  a  continuing  violation.  6 


 You  may  respond  to  this  citation  within  30  days  from  the  date  of  this  letter  either  through  (1)  a  personal  interview  at  the  Commission’s  Field  Office  nearest  to  your  place  of  business,  or 
 (2)  a  written  statement.  Your  response  should  specify  the  actions  that  you  are  taking  to  ensure  that  you  do  not  violate  the  Commission’s  rules  governing  telephone  solicitation  and  unsolicited 
 advertisements,  as  described  above. 
 The  nearest  Commission  field  office  appears  to  be  the  New  York  Office,  New  York,  New  York.  Please  contact  Al  McCloud  at  (202)  418-  2499  if  you  wish  to  schedule  a  personal 
 interview.  You  should  schedule  any  interview  to  take  place  within  30  days  of  the  date  of 


 3  47  U.  S.  C.  §  227(  a)(  4);  47  C.  F.  R.  §  64.  1200(  f)(  10). 
 4  Rules  and  Regulations  Implementing  the  Telephone  Consumer  Protection  Act  of  1991,  Memorandum  Opinion  and 
 Order,  10  FCC  Rcd  12391,  12405  (1995)  (1995  TCPA  Reconsideration  Order).  In  June  2003,  the  Commission  amended  its  rules  to  specify  that  prior  express  invitation  or  permission  to  receive  a  facsimile  advertisement  must  be 


 recorded  in  a  “signed  written  statement  that  includes  the  facsimile  number  to  which  any  advertisements  may  be  sent  and  clearly  indicates  the  recipient's  consent  to  receive  such  facsimile  advertisements  from  the  sender.”  2003  TCPA 
 Report  and  Order,  18  FCC  Rcd  at  14124-  28  (adopting  new  section  64.  1200(  a)(  3)(  i).  This  new  provision,  which  supercedes  the  established  business  relationship  exception,  is  scheduled  to  take  effect  June  30,  2005.  Rules  and 
 Regulations  Implementing  the  Telephone  Consumer  Protection  Act  of  1991,  Order,  FCC  04-  223  (rel.  Oct.  1,  2004).  The  Commission  currently  is  considering  petitions  that  seek  to  retain  the  established  business  relationship  exception 
 or  require  methods  other  than  a  signed  written  statement  to  demonstrate  prior  express  consent  to  receive  fax  advertising. 


 5  1995  Reconsideration  Order,  10  FCC  Rcd  at  12408-  09;  see  also  2003  TCPA  Report  and  Order,  18  FCC  Rcd  at 
 14128  (concluding  that  publication  of  a  fax  number  in  a  trade  publication  or  directory  does  not  demonstrate  consent  to  receive  fax  advertising).
