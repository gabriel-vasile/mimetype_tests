{description}   KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, FLA. -- Damon Petty, with United Space
                Alliance, removes an insulation blanket from a shelf prior to
                heat cleaning and waterproofing. The blankets fit inside the nose
                cap of an orbiter. They consist of layered, pure silica felt
                sandwiched between a layer of silica fabric (the hot side) and a
                layer of S-Glass fabric. The blanket is through-stitched with
                pure silica thread in a 1-inch grid pattern. After fabrication,
                the blanket is bonded directly to the vehicle structure and
                finally coated with a high purity silica coating that improves
                erosion resistance. The blankets are semi-rigid and can be made
                as large as 30 inches by 30 inches.
