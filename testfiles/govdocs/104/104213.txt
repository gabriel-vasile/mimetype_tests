This major group includes establishments engaged in performing any of the
following operations: (1) preparation of fiber and subsequent manufacturing
of yarn, thread, braids, twine, and cordage; (2) manufacturing broadwoven

yarn; (3) dyeing and finishing fiber, yarn, fabrics, and knit apparel; (4)
coating, waterproofing, or otherwise treating fabrics; (5) the integrated
manufacture of knit apparel and other finished articles from yarn; and (6)
the manufacture of felt goods, lace goods, nonwoven fabrics, and
miscellaneous textiles.

This classification makes no distinction between the two types of
organizations which operate in the textile industry: (1) the integrated
mill which purchases materials, produces textiles and related articles
within the establishment, and sells the finished products; and (2) the
contract or commission mill which processes materials owned by others.
Converters or other nonmanufacturing establishments which assign materials
to contract mills for processing, other than knitting, are classified in
nonmanufacturing industries; establishments which assign yarns to outside
contractors or commission knitters for the production of knit products are
classified in industry group 225.
