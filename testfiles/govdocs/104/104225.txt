                   WAGE DETERMINATION APPEALS PROCESS


1.) Has there been an initial decision in the matter? This can
be:

*  an existing published wage determination
*  a survey underlying a wage determination
*  a Wage and Hour Division letter setting forth a position on
a wage
   determination matter
*  a conformance (additional classification and rate) ruling

On survey related matters, initial contact, including requests
for summaries
of surveys, should be with the Wage and Hour Regional Office
for the area in
which the survey was conducted because those Regional Offices
have
responsibility for the Davis-Bacon survey program. If the
response from this
initial contact is not satisfactory, then the process described
in 2.) and
3.) should be followed. 

With regard to any other matter not yet ripe for the formal
process
described here, initial contact should be with the Branch of
Construction
Wage Determinations.  Write to: 

	Branch of Construction Wage Determinations
	Wage and Hour Division
	U.S. Department of Labor
	200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.
	Washington, DC 20210

2.) If the answer to the question in 1.) is yes, then an
interested party
(those affected by the action) can request review and
reconsideration from
the Wage and Hour Administrator (See 29 CFR Part 1.8 and 29 CFR
Part 7).
Write to: 

	Wage and Hour Administrator
	U.S. Department of Labor
	200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.
	Washington, DC 20210

The request should be accompanied by a full statement of the
interested
party's position and by any information (wage payment data,
project
description, area practice material, etc.) that the requestor
considers
relevant to the issue. 

3.) If the decision of the Administrator is not favorable, an
interested
party may appeal directly to  the Administrative Review Board
(formerly the
Wage Appeals Board).  Write to:

	Administrative Review Board
	U.S. Department of Labor
	200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.
	Washington, DC 20210

4.) All decisions by the Administrative Review Board are final.



                   END OF GENERAL DECISION
