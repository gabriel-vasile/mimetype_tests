OFFICE OF THE ASSISTANT SECRETARY
FOR HOUSING-FEDERAL HOUSING COMMISSIONER
 
MORTGAGEE LETTER 97-22
 
TO:  ALL APPROVED MORTGAGEES
 
SUBJECT:  Single Family Loan Production - FHA New Construction,
          Inspection, and Appraisal Requirements
 
The Department of Housing and Urban Development recently held two
Roundtable discussions with our industry partners; one on new
construction issues, and another on appraisal issues.  The
purpose of this mortgagee letter is to advise you of the
practices and procedures being eliminated or modified to make FHA
requirements less burdensome.
 
NEW CONSTRUCTION AND INSPECTION ISSUES:
 
HUD/VA/INDUSTRY LOCAL ADVISORY GROUPS
 
Maintaining open communication between our partners and the
Department keeps both informed of changes, problems, and new
issues.  It helps eliminate possible program abuse, clarifies and
helps resolve misinterpretation of specific program procedures,
and assists us in developing simplified ways of delivering public
services more efficiently and effectively.  The Department,
therefore, will reemphasize to its local HUD offices and the
Homeownership Centers (HOCs) the importance of continuing and
expanding the practice of meeting with builders, lenders, real
estate professionals, VA and local government and community
groups to communicate concerns and problems and to discuss
solutions.
 
INSPECTIONS ON NEW CONSTRUCTION
 
Three inspections are required on new construction in order to
get a high ratio insured mortgage.  To expand the process of
inspections, the Department will now permit the final inspection
by the local authority to be accepted in lieu of HUD's third
inspection in those jurisdictions where HUD now accepts the first
two inspections by the local authority.
 
AFFIRMATIVE FAIR HOUSING MARKETING PLANS (AFHMP)
 
HUD and the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) has a
valid Voluntary Affirmative Marketing Agreement (VAMA).
Therefore, any member of NAHB, or a builder who is not a member
of NAHB but who has a contract with an NAHB member (a signatory
in good standing to a VAMA) to market their houses, is covered by
the HUD/NAHB VAMA.
 
HUD and the National Association of Realtors (NAR) signed a Fair
Housing Partnership Resolution, effective December 5, 1996.  This
is not a VAMA and it cannot be substituted for one.  Builders who
contract with real estate professionals to market their new
houses must also complete and submit an AFHMP to the local HUD
office or HOC in their area for approval prior to the issuance of
a case number.
 
SWIFT ENFORCEMENT OF REGULATIONS
 
The Department is making it clear that it will not tolerate abuse
of any single family program.  Moving from pre-endorsement to
post endorsement monitoring, more reliance is being placed on our
lender partners to assure compliance with FHA requirements.  To
assure this, more staff is being added to our Lender Monitoring
functions.  Lenders are reminded that their quality control
systems must be current and must be followed.
 
ENERGY EFFICIENT MORTGAGE (EEM) PROGRAM
 
This is to remind lenders that the Department is interested in
promoting the use of the EEM program.  We are currently working
with Edison Electric to develop an EEM computer program which
will assist in the required cost benefit analysis.  EEM software
and a user's guide will be available in the near future, and may
be ordered through the HUD User Information System for a nominal
fee.  Interested persons may contact HUD User at 1-800-245-2691,
fax 301-251-5767, or write: HUD User, P.O. Box 6091, Rockville,
MD 20840.  Note that the EEM program may now be used in
conjunction with Section 203(h), Disaster Housing Mortgage
Insurance.  ( SEE ML 97-10, dated April 1, 1997. )
 
APPRAISER AND APPRAISAL ISSUES:
 
FHA ROSTER OF APPRAISERS
 
The Roster of Appraisers gives FHA a fast and effective way to
stop a poorly performing appraiser from providing appraisals to
lenders who are unfamiliar with their work.  Additionally, the
Department's policy on choosing appraisers states that there
shall be no discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion,
national origin, sex, age or disability.  The roster is used to
collect minority and gender information which is then used to
measure one element of the lender's performance.  No change,
therefore, is being made to the FHA Roster of Appraisers.
 
Lenders are reminded that if the appraiser they selected provides
a poor or even fraudulent appraisal which leads the Department to
insure a mortgage at an inflated amount, the lender is held
equally responsible with the appraiser for the violation.
Therefore, it behooves the lender to assure they select
appraisers that are knowledgeable and trustworthy and that the
appraisals provided are accurate and justifiable.  If they are
not, the lender should report the appraiser to both the
Department and to the State Appraiser Licensing Board for action.
While it may appear less troublesome to not select that appraiser
in the future, lack of reporting allows that appraiser to be
selected by other lenders, making it more likely that
unsuspecting lenders will inadvertently choose a bad appraiser
and be held liable for the poor results.
 
FEES
 
FHA field offices will no longer establish maximum appraisal
fees.  However, a lender's charge to the borrower for an
appraisal must be no more than the actual amount charged by and
paid to the appraiser, subject to the fee being reasonable and
customary for an appraisal in the area in which the property is
located.  That fee may be included in the closing costs upon
which the mortgage is based.  Lenders that utilize their own
staff appraiser may charge a fee to the mortgagor which does not
exceed that which is reasonable and customary in the area.
Lenders utilizing management firms that secure the appraisal on
behalf of the lender may only charge the mortgagor the actual
amount paid to and received by the appraiser, subject to the
reasonable and customary cap.  Lenders dealing with service
providers which charge reasonable and customary fees but pay the
appraiser less than they charge the lender may only have the
mortgagor pay what was charged by and paid to the appraiser.
 
COST APPROACH TO APPRAISING
 
The Department now places more reliance on the market approach,
but there are instances when the cost and income approaches are
required.  For all new construction and existing properties less
than one year old, both the cost and the market approaches must
be used.  If the property is a three or four unit building, the
income approach must be used as well.  However, the Department
will rely on the appraiser's best supported final estimate of
value obtained from any of these approaches. No longer will the
appraiser's final estimate of value be restricted by the 3
percent difference between estimates.  The appraiser's final
estimate of value must be well explained and documented.
If the appraiser does not have the plans, specifications and
construction documents as well as the completed builder's
certification at the time the appraisal is to be performed, the
appraiser may not complete the appraisal until this documentation
is made available.
 
When using the cost approach, the Marshall & Swift square foot
method must be used by completing their form #1007.  The pages
from which the appraiser obtained the cost figures must be
copied, the figures used in the calculations circled, and those
pages attached to form #1007.  (SEE HUD Handbook 4150.1  REV-1 for
more instructions.)
 
VALUATION CONDITION (VC) SHEETS
 
The Department now requires the use of the same basic VC sheet
nationwide with the exception of a FEW localized repair
conditions established by the local HUD office.  (Copy attached.)
 
FHA appraisals are done "AS REPAIRED" or as stated on the URAR,
"subject to the repairs, alterations, inspections, or
conditions...".  This means the indicated value is reported as if
all the repair items were completed.  Since the lender selects
the appraiser, the lender must inform the appraiser that the job
is for an FHA case and that the appraiser is expected to use the
VC sheet.  If the appraiser is not familiar with the VC sheet,
the lender is responsible for training the appraiser on its
importance.  Lenders, appraisers and FHA field offices must
remember that required repairs are limited to those necessary to
preserve the continued marketability of the property and to
protect the health and safety of the occupants.
 
If there is a property condition disclosure statement, the
appraiser should obtain a copy prior to performing the appraisal.
(SEE ML 90-26 , dated July 26, 1990 for further information.)
 
If an appraisal report is field reviewed and repair items are
discovered which were not reported, or reported to be completed
when they are not, the lender and the appraiser will be subject
to administrative sanctions.
 
APPRAISAL FORMS
 
Appraisals written on the Uniform Residential Appraisal Report
form (URAR), the Federal National Mortgage Association's (FNMA)
Individual Condominium Unit Appraisal Report form, or FNMA's
Small Residential Income Property Appraisal Report form are
acceptable to the Department.  Currently, only these forms are
acceptable for FHA cases.  Other FNMA appraisal forms which are
used for a streamlined appraisal or a qualitative sales
comparison analysis are not acceptable at this time.
 
If you should have any questions concerning this Mortgagee
Letter, please contact your local HUD Office.
 
Sincerely yours,

Assistant Secretary for Housing-
