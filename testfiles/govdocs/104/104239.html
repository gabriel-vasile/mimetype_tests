<H2>ABSTRACT</H2>

Elemental  analyses of impactor residues on high purity surfaces  exposed  to
the  LEO  environment  for  5.8 years on LDEF has revealed  several  probable
sources    for   microparticles   at   this   altitude,   including   natural
micrometeorites  and manmade debris ranging from paint pigments  to  bits  of
stainless steel.  A myriad of contamination interferences were identified and
their  effects on impactor debris identification mitigated during the  course
of  this  study.   These  interferences included pre-,  post-  and  in-flight
deposited   particulate   surface  contaminants,  as   well   as   indigenous
heterogeneous material contaminants.  Non-flight contaminants traced to human
origins,  including spittle and skin oils, contributed significant levels  of
alkali-rich  carbonaceous  interferences.  A ubiquitous  layer  of  in-flight
deposited  silicaceous contamination varied in thickness with  LDEF  location
and   proximity  to  active  electrical  fields.   In-flight  deposited  (low
velocity)  contaminants included urine droplets and bits of metal  film  from
eroded thermal blankets.<P>

<H2>INTRODUCTION</H2>

The  Long  Duration Exposure Facility satellite (LDEF) was  deployed  in  low
earth orbit (LEO) on 7 April, 1984 and after 5.77 years of space exposure was
retrieved on 26 January, 1990.  The gravity gradient stabilized, non-spinning
satellite  carried  57 scientific and engineering experiments  that  gathered
information  on  the LEO environment and its effects on spacecraft  materials
and  systems.  One major task of the LDEF mission was to measure the  fluence
and composition of the small particle environment in LEO.  This population is
composed   of  several  microparticle  species  which  include  [a]   natural
micrometeorites  from  asteroidal,  cometary  and  other  interplanetary  and
interstellar dust sources, and [b] manmade orbital debris particles that  can
be  linked to rocket fuel exhaust, paint flakes, wastewater dumps, cargo  bay
debris,  and  spacecraft materials that are released in  catastrophic  events
such  as  satellite  explosions.   Essentially  all  natural  particles  will
intercept spacecraft in LEO at hypervelocity speeds, creating impact  craters
and  blasting  away  many  times their own mass in target  material  that  is
ejected  from  the  crater  in  a spray of small  particles.   (This  is  one
mechanism  of  microparticle  population  growth  in  LEO.)   Manmade  debris
particles also intercept spacecraft in LEO at hypervelocity speeds and create
impact  craters.   However, manmade microparticles released during  satellite
deployment  and retrieval missions can intercept the involved  spacecraft  at
very  low  velocities (no craters) and contribute to the particulate  surface
contamination.    Particles   arising   from   shuttle   operations   include
wastewater/condensate dumps, hydraulic losses and contaminant particles  from
the cargo bay.<P>

Several  active  and  inactive experiments on LDEF were  designed  to  record
hypervelocity   impacts   from   manmade   orbital   debris    and    natural
micrometeorites.  Impact craters on these surfaces are being examined by  the
scientific community with microanalytical techniques in a search for impactor
debris  or residue.  We have carried out an extensive series of such analyses
using  Scanning  Electron  Microscopy  with  Energy  Dispersive  Spectroscopy
(SEM/EDS) and Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) techniques developed for
surfaces   from  two  LDEF  micrometeorite  experiments:  Expt.  AO201,   the
Interplanetary  Dust Experiment (IDE), and Expt. AO187-1,  the  Chemistry  of
Micrometeoroids   Experiment  (CME).   We  report   here   on   contamination
interferences  that  were discovered during the course  of  our  studies  and
describe the recognition and mitigation practices developed to date.<P>

<H2>EXPERIMENTAL</H2>

The  extreme sensitivity of SIMS (ppm for most species) makes it  a  valuable
tool  in  the  search for sparse impactor residues, but  it  also  makes  the
technique  susceptible  to interference from trace levels  of  contamination.
This  a  major  concern when using SIMS to look for impactor residues.   Only
craters in very high purity substrates were selected for analysis in order to
minimize  interferences from the substrate matrix.  The active IDE experiment
consisted  of  several  hundred  51  mm  diameter  metal-oxide-silicon  (MOS)
capacitor type impact detectors that were mounted on the six primary sides of
LDEF  (rows 3, 6, 9, 12, and Earth and Space ends).  The detectors discharged
when  they  were  impacted by a particle (and then  recharged  within  a  few
seconds)  and recorded the time of the impact event on a magnetic tape.   The
objective of this experiment was to measure the flux and spatial distribution
of  submicron and larger particles with respect to time.  Because ultra  high
purity  (electronic  grade) materials were used to construct  the  Al-SiO2-Si
detectors, they were selected as appropriate surfaces to search for  impactor
debris  in  craters using SIMS.  In addition, twelve 32 mm diameter germanium
witness plates were also flown on LDEF (row 12) as a part of the IDE.   These
Ge  plates were single crystal, ultra-high purity, (0.99999) and ultra-smooth
(<50 Angstroms).   They  were intended to provide a surface on which even  very  small
impact  craters  (<0.1 micrometers)  could be found,  and  also  to  collect  surface
contaminants associated with the mission.  These surfaces were also  selected
for SIMS analysis.<P>

A third LDEF surface type selected for SIMS analysis was the high purity gold
(0.9999)  plates from the CME that had been mounted on row 3 (trailing  side)
of  LDEF.   Horz, et al., have reported results of extensive SEM/EDS analyses
of  impact sites on these surfaces /3, 4/.  The Au plates were mounted  in  a
protective  clamshell  enclosure  (to limit particulate  contamination)  that
opened  several  days  after deployment.  Although the clamshell  system  was
designed  to  close  before  LDEF retrieval, the extra  long  stay  in  orbit
resulted  in its being open upon retrieval.  We attempted to look for  sparse
impactor   debris  in  craters  on  these  surfaces  that  would  have   been
undetectable using SEM/EDS.<P>

The  Au  samples were premounted on SEM stubs and had already been  carefully
documented  with SEM/EDS by the CME team.  These samples were placed  in  the
SIMS  without further treatment.  Optical micrographs of each IDE sensor were
taken  before and after flight, providing a comparative record of  pre-flight
and  in-flight/post-flight features.  Samples were handled in clean rooms  or
laminar   flow  hoods  during  optical  examination  in  order  to   minimize
accumulation of post-flight surface particulate debris.  Much of the  surface
particulate  debris was blown off of sample surfaces using a  filtered,  pre-
purified nitrogen stream.  This procedure was repeated each time a sample was
removed  from  its  protective  case,  and  just  prior  to  insertion   into
instruments.   No  solvent rinsing or washing procedures have  been  used  to
date.   IDE sensor and Ge witness plate surfaces were first scanned  with  an
Olympus  stereo  optical microscope at 125X in order to locate  features  for
further  study.   Optical  micrographs were taken  of  some  features  and/or
fiducial  marks  (scratches) were made in order to assist in  relocating  the
microfeatures during subsequent analyses.  Features on IDE sensors were  also
mapped  on  the  whole-sensor micrographs.  SEM/EDS analyses  were  performed
using either a JEOL Model JSM 6400F cold field emission SEM equipped with  an
Oxford  EDS  with an ultrathin window, or an Hitachi S-530 scanning  electron
microscope  equipped  with thick-window Tracor-Northern  TN5500  EDS.   Auger
Electron  Spectroscopy  (AES) depth profiles of  surface  contamination  were
performed  using  a JEOL JAMP-30 scanning Auger microprobe.   SIMS  data  was
collected with a Cameca  IMS 3F using 16O+ or 16O- ion beams.  The instrument
was  used in the ion microscope mode and data was recorded as two-dimensional
elemental  positive  ion  maps  with lateral  resolution  of  ~2 
micrometers.   Pixel
intensities  were  used to calculate relative element abundances.   The  SIMS
analytical protocol is detailed in reference /1/.<P>

<H2>RESULTS</H2>

Three  categories of contamination were noted on the LDEF samples.  Substrate
contamination  included homogeneous and heterogeneous  (such  as  inclusions)
bulk matrix contamination and subsurface interfacial contamination.  The  IDE
Ge  witness  plates had no detectable bulk matrix contaminants and  were  not
subject   to  interfacial  contamination  since  they  were  single   crystal
substrates.  The IDE impact detectors had ~100 ppm of Ca contamination in the
Al  surface  layer.   There  was  evidence  of  possible  Na,  K,  F  and  Cl
contamination   at   the  SiO2/Si  interface,  but  this   situation   awaits
verification  using  charge-compensated depth  profiling  techniques.   These
substrate  contaminants raised the effective lower limits  of  detection  for
these  species  to  the  hundreds  of ppm level.   Pressure  induced  "blank"
discharges were produced on retrieved sensors [under power] using diamond and
silicon  shards.  SIMS analyses of these "blanks" showed that the  Al  matrix
contaminants  and the layer of surface contamination (discussed  below)  were
blown  clear  of  the discharge zone by the energetic event (see  Figure  1).
However, until the matrix can be more carefully characterized, and until SIMS
analyses  are  performed on hypervelocity impact sites  on  flight  retrieved
sensors  using impactors with known compositions in ground based  facilities,
the  lower limits of detection for the species in question will remain  high.
No  conclusions on orbital impactor origins will be reached that rely  solely
on  the  presence of these species in impact sites.  It should be noted  that
out  of 79 impact sites on IDE sensors examined with SIMS, 38 have either  no
detectable  residue, or only have traces of Na and K present  in  the  impact
sites.<P>

powered IDE flight sensor.  Bits of the ultra-pure Si shard used to cause the
discharge  are  visible in the central portion of the region cleared  by  the
discharge.  (b) SIMS ion maps showed that the surface contamination layer was
blown clear of the discharge zone.</I><P>

The Au samples had bulk Cu and Ag contamination levels in the hundreds of ppm
range.  An interfacial layer of multi-element contamination was found  ~1  micrometer
below the surface when doing a depth profile of the Au matrix adjacent to  an
impact crater.  The layer was ~ 2 micrometer thick and was rich in C, Na, Mg, Al, Si,
K,  Ca,  Ti,  Cr,  Fe, Cu, Zn and As.  This was traced to the  manufacturer's
practice  of  covering the Au plate with a 1 micrometer thick  Au  leaf  in  a  final
processing  step in order to produce a smooth surface texture.  The  presence
of  As  (frequently found with Au ore deposits) in this layer was used  as  a
tracer for the contamination.  The 1 micrometer thick Au leaf was clearly visible  in
micrographs of impact craters, and the exposed contamination layer  could  be
morphologically  identified.   These  two techniques  essentially  eliminated
false identification of impactor debris from this source, but the presence of
the  contamination severely limited the utility of SIMS in identifying sparse
impactor debris that could not be detected with EDS.<P>
Particulate  contamination included all surface particles.   These  could  be
traced  to pre- and post-flight sources such as clothing fiber, paper  fiber,
starch grains, pollen, sawdust, spittle, fingerprints, oil droplets, bits  of
metal,  plastic  and  rubber, etc.; inflight sources from shuttle  operations
during   deployment   and   retrieval;  and   self-generated   sources   from
environmental  degradation (especially atomic oxygen [AO]  erosion)  of  LDEF
surfaces  and specimens.  The atomic oxygen exposure generated  ash  on  some
materials, eroded the polymer from metal backed films leading to the  release
of  bits  of  thin  metal foils, and eroded organic binders  in  some  paints
leading to the release of small, inorganic paint particles (pigments).  There
is  also surface debris from the molten ejecta of impacts.  A detailed survey
of  particulate contamination is the subject of several reports from the LDEF
community /5-8/.<P>

Some surface particulate contamination features possess the basic symmetry of
an impact crater and can be mistakenly identified by inexperienced operators.
A particular example of this type of interference is an apparent residue from
a droplet of wastewater.  As can be seen in Figure 2, the residue is circular
and  appears to have a central crater.  However, stereoscopic examination and
line  profilometry  have  verified  that these  are  surface  deposits.   EDS
analyses  of  the crystalline deposits in these spots reveals a pattern  that
closely  resembles human urine /9/.  These features are relatively  rare  and
easily  identified by experienced researchers.  We have identified less  than
10  in  optical  scans of over 1500 cm2 of highly smooth LDEF  surfaces.   It
should  be  noted that other LDEF and Solar Max investigators  have  reported
these feature on retrieved surfaces /9, 10/.<P>

droplet residue found on LDEF.</I><P>

Interference from particles in or near impact features that were imaged  with
SIMS  were  determined by careful SEM/EDS examination  of  the  impact  site.
Particles  that were not associated with the impact event could be recognized
by  their  morphology.   If  there  was no evidence  that  the  particle  had
undergone  melting, it was assumed to be a contaminant.  Salt crystals  (NaCl
and  KCl)  and  bits  of  metal  (Al  and stainless  steel)  were  the  major
particulate  interferences.   Purely  organic  based  particles  were  not  a
significant  problem  since  they  could  be  easily  recognized   by   their
composition.   In  general,  the best method of  mitigation  for  particulate
interferences was recognition.<P>

The  Ge  witness  plates  were contaminated with high  levels  (~400/cm2)  of
surface  particulates which could not be blown off the surface with nitrogen.
Many  of  these  contamination spots, apparently residues from splatters  and
droplets,  were  analyzed using SEM/EDS, and a few were analyzed  with  SIMS.
They  were  found  to  be alkali-rich silicaceous materials  with  inclusions
(spots)  of  hydrocarbon based materials.  Several other witness plates  (Si,
quartz  and Zirconia) that were mounted concurrently and coincidentally  with
the  Ge  plates had surface particulate counts from 2-20/cm2.  Thus,  it  was
apparent  that  the Ge plates had been contaminated before being  mounted  on
LDEF.   In  addition, the impact features on the Ge witness plates  generally
had  high aspect central crater ratios with very jagged walls and inner spall
zones.   These jagged central crater walls led to beam shadowing  during  the
SIMS  analysis  where  the primary ion beam is prevented  from  reaching  the
bottom  of the crater due to the rough contours of the crater walls.  Due  to
this  effect, residues at the bottom of the crater could not be extracted  at
their  true levels /1/.  The combination of beam shadowing and the high level
of  surface contamination made it very difficult to study the impact  craters
on  Ge plates with the Cameca 3F SIMS instrument, and work has been suspended
on this sample set.<P>

A C/O/Si rich surface contamination layer covers essentially all exposed LDEF
surfaces  to some degree.  Sources for this layer include outgassing products
from  organic  based  paint  and  silicone based room-temperature-vulcanizers
(RTV's),  and  possibly  from  silizane based waterproofing  agents  used  on
shuttle  tiles  /11,  12/.  The thickness of the layer is  dependent  on  the
surfaces' position relative to the various outgassing sources, the amount  of
ultraviolet  (UV) light exposure, and the proximity to electric  fields.   On
most  IDE  sensors there was a dark, arc shaped zone of contamination  around
the  unshielded electrical leads (Au wires) on the upper surface,  and  there
were  also  some  areas of darker contamination near the  edges  of  the  MOS
wafers.  (The MOS wafers were bonded to their Al holders with silicone  RTV).
As  shown in Figure 3, Auger depth profiles of this contamination layer in  a
dark  arc  near the electrical leads on one sensor, and in a "light"  colored
area  adjacent to this zone, showed that the layer was twice as thick in  the
dark  area  (~700 Å compared to ~350Å).  Coloration of the layer varies  from
transparent to dark brown, and is apparently related to thickness and  carbon
content in a given area.  In general, this contamination layer was darker  on
surfaces that had low exposure to atomic oxygen (AO).  SIMS depth profiles of
the  contaminant layer showed that C was present at concentrations 10 to  100
times higher on sensors from the backside of LDEF (row 3) versus sensors from
the  front  side  of the spacecraft (row 9).  Thus, it is  assumed  that  the
contamination layer color is due to carbon-carbon bond conjugation (C=C).  It
should  be  noted  that  the overall thickness of the  layer  was  aparrently
unrelated to AO exposure.<P>

During  SIMS  analyses, the contamination layer over an  impact  site,  which
varied in thickness depending on impact location and age, was sputtered  away
using the O+ beam while monitoring the concentration of C, Na and Mg (and  Si
on  Ge  and  Au surfaces).  Na and Mg were present in this layer  in  amounts
detectable  to  SIMS but not to EDS or AES.  When the ion signals  for  these
species  dropped  sharply,  the layer was assumed  to  be  essentially  gone.
However,  residual material from this layer can expect to be  sputtered  more
slowly  from  the  valleys  and troughs associated  with  the  local  surface
topography.   (This is known as differential sputtering and is an  effect  of
beam  shadowing.)   Thus,  careful interpretation  of  SIMS  data  was  still
required,  and  the  utility  of  C, O and Si isotopic  ratios  in  suspected
impactor debris (not performed by this group) is severely restricted /13/.<P>

<H2>SUMMARY</H2>

SIMS  analyses  of  microimpactor residues on LDEF  surfaces  is  subject  to
significant interference from three general classes of contamination.<P>

[1] The most troublesome interference comes from indigenous contamination  of
target  materials.  This can take the form of granular inclusions, subsurface
layers and bulk matrix impurities.  Careful compositional characterization of
target  substrates allows SIMS operators to define realistic lower limits  of
detection, identify tracer ion species or ion ratios associated with specific
contaminants, and develop other contaminant recognition criteria.<P>

[2]  A  myriad  of  particulate surface contaminants can  be  found  on  LDEF
surfaces.  Small particles that are lodged in or near impact sites will  give
large signals during SIMS analysis.  These interferences are best dealt  with
through  careful  SEM/EDS  analysis  and  recognition  of  morphologies   not
associated with hypervelocity impact events.<P>

[3]  A  C/O/Si rich contamination layer covers all LDEF surfaces  to  varying
degrees.   This layer is sputtered away before analyzing the impact site  for
impactor  residue.  However, differential sputtering of this layer  from  the
highly variable topography associated with impact craters can still interfere
with  C/O/Si  compositional analyses and severely restricts  the  utility  of
isotopic ratios of these species in suspected impactor debris.<P>
