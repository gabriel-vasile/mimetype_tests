<h2 class="pubTitle">Q&amp;A: The National 
  Do Not Call Registry</h2>
<h3>
  Tell Me More About 
  the National Do Not Call Registry</h3>
<ol>
<li>
  <h4> Why would I register 
    my phone number with the National Do Not 
    Call Registry?</h4></li>
  <p>The National Do Not Call 
  Registry gives you an opportunity to limit 
  the telemarketing calls you receive. Once 
  you register your phone number, telemarketers 
  covered by the National Do Not Call Registry 
  have up to 31 days  from the date you register to stop 
  calling you. </p>
<li><h4> Who manages the 
  National Do Not Call Registry?</h4></li>
<p>The National Do Not Call 
  Registry is managed by the Federal Trade 
  Commission (FTC), the nation&#8217;s consumer 
  protection agency. It is enforced by the 
  FTC, the Federal Communications Commission 
  (FCC), and state law enforcement officials. </p>
<li><h4> Why was the National 
  Do Not Call Registry created?</h4></li>
<p>The registry was created 
  to offer consumers a choice regarding telemarketing 
  calls. The FTC&#8217;s decision to create 
  the National Do Not Call Registry was the 
  culmination of a comprehensive, three-year 
  review of the Telemarketing Sales Rule (TSR), 
  as well as the Commission&#8217;s extensive 
  experience enforcing the TSR over seven 
  years. The FTC held numerous workshops, 
  meetings, and briefings to solicit feedback 
  from interested parties and considered over 
  64,000 public comments, most of which favored 
  creating the registry. You can review the 
  entire record of the Rule review at <br />
                                        <a href="/bcp/rulemaking/tsr/tsrrulemaking/index.htm">www.ftc.gov/bcp/rulemaking/tsr/tsrrulemaking/index.htm</a>. </p><br />
<h3>
  How Does Registration Work?</h3>
<li><h4> How soon after I 
  register will I notice a reduction in calls?</h4></li>
<p>Telemarketers covered by the National Do 
  Not Call Registry have up to 
  31 days from the date you register to stop 
  calling you. </p>
<li><h4> When I register 
  my phone number, how long until it shows 
  up on the National Do Not Call Registry?</h4></li>
<p>After you register, your 
  phone number will show up on the registry 
  by the next day. Telemarketers have up to 
  31 days to get your phone number and remove 
  it from their call lists.</p>
<li><h4> What if I change 
  my mind? Can I take my number off the National 
  Do Not Call Registry?</h4></li>
<p>You can delete your phone 
  number only by calling toll-free 1-888-382-1222 
  from the telephone number you want to delete. 
  After you contact the registry to delete 
  it, it will be removed from the National 
  Do Not Call Registry by the next day. But 
  telemarketers have up to 31 days to access 
  information about your deletion and add 
  your number back to their call lists, if 
  they choose to. </p>
<li><h4> If I registered 
  by phone, will I receive a confirmation?</h4></li>
<p>No, but you can verify 
  that your number is on the registry online 
  at <a href="http://www.donotcall.gov" target="_blank">www.donotcall.gov</a> or by calling the registry&#8217;s toll-free 
  number (1-888-382-1222) and following the 
  prompts for verifying that your number is 
  on the registry. </p>
<li><h4> I received a phone 
  call from someone offering to put my name 
  on the National Do Not Call Registry. Should 
  I let them?</h4></li>
<p>No. The FTC does not allow 
  private companies or other such third parties 
  to register consumers for the National Do 
  Not Call Registry. Websites or phone solicitations 
  that claim they can or will register a consumer&#8217;s 
  name or phone number on the National Do 
  Not Call Registry &#8212; especially those 
  that charge a fee &#8212; are almost certainly 
  a scam. Consumers may register directly, 
  or through some state governments, but never 
  through private companies. For consumers, 
  the National Do Not Call Registry is a free 
  service of the federal government. </p><br />
<h3>
  What About the Privacy of My Information?</h3>
<li><h4> If I choose to register 
  my phone number, how will my information 
  be used and disclosed?</h4></li>
<p>We collect your phone 
  number and store it in the National Do Not 
  Call Registry so that telemarketers and 
  sellers covered by the FTC&#8217;s rules 
  can remove your phone number from their 
  call lists. Telemarketers are required to 
  search the registry every 31 days and delete 
  from their call lists phone numbers that 
  are in the registry. Phone numbers in the 
  registry also may be shared with law enforcement 
  to assure compliance with federal and state 
  law. </p>
<p>If you contact us via 
  the Internet, we also collect your email 
  address to confirm your registration request. 
  We will store your email address in a secure 
  manner, separate from your telephone number. 
  We will not share your email address with 
  telemarketers. </p>
<p>For more information about 
  the privacy of your information, please 
  see our privacy policy at <a href="/ftc/privacy.shtm" target="_blank">www.ftc.gov/ftc/privacy.shtm</a></p>

   <h3>What Phone Numbers 
                                          Can I Register?                                  </h3>
                                  <li><h4> Can I register my cell phone on the National Do Not Call Registry?</h4></li>
<p> Yes, you may place your personal cell phone number on the National Do Not Call Registry. The registry has accepted cell phone numbers since it opened for registrations in June 2003. There is no deadline to register a home or cell phone number on the Registry. </p>
<p>You may have received an email telling you that your cell phone is about to be assaulted by telemarketing calls as a result of a new cell phone number database; however, that is not the case. FCC regulations prohibit telemarketers from using automated dialers to call cell phone numbers. Automated dialers are standard in the industry, so most telemarketers don&rsquo;t call consumers on their cell phones without their consent. </p>
<li><h4> Can I register 
  all my family and friends?</h4></li>
<p>You should register only 
  your own telephone numbers.</p>
<li><h4> I have more than 
  three personal telephone numbers. How can 
  I register all of those numbers?</h4></li>
<p>You may register up to 
  three telephone numbers at one time on the 
  National Do Not Call Registry website. You 
  will receive a separate confirmation email 
  for each number you wish to register online. 
  You must open each email and click on the 
  link in each one to complete the registration 
  process. If you have more than three personal 
  telephone numbers, you will have to go through 
  the registration process more than once 
  to register all of your numbers. There is 
  a limit on the number of phone numbers you 
  can register in this manner. </p>
<p>You can register only 
  one phone number each time you call the 
  National Do Not Call Registry, and you must 
  call from the phone number you wish to register. </p>
<li><h4> What happens if 
  I register more than one number at a time 
  online?</h4></li>
<p>You will get an email 
  for each number you register online. You 
  need to open each email and click on the 
  link in each email within 72 hours to register 
  those numbers.</p>
<li><h4> Can I register 
  my business phone number or a fax number?</h4></li>
<p>The National Do Not Call 
  Registry is only for personal phone numbers. 
  Business-to-business calls and faxes are 
  not covered by the National Do Not Call 
  Registry.</p><br />
<h3>
  Will My Registration Expire?</h3>
<li>
  <h4>  How long does my phone number stay registered? </h4>
</li>
<p>Telephone numbers on the registry will only be removed when they are disconnected and reassigned, or when the consumer chooses to remove a number from the registry.
  </li>
  <br />
<h3>
  What If I Move or My Phone Is Disconnected?</h3>
<li><h4> I moved and got 
  a new phone number. Do I need to register 
  the new number?</h4></li>
<p>Yes.</p>
<li><h4> Do I need to take 
  my old phone number off the list when I 
  get a new number?</h4></li>
<p>No. You can if you would 
  like to, but the system will automatically 
  remove most numbers that are disconnected 
  and reassigned.</p>
<li><h4>What happens if 
  my phone number is disconnected and then 
  reconnected?</h4></li>
<p>If your number is disconnected 
  and then reconnected, you may need to re-register. 
  In addition, there are actions that you 
  or your telephone company might take that 
  could cause your registered phone number 
  to become unregistered &#8212; even 
  if your service has not been interrupted 
  (such as changing calling plans or other 
  services, or changing the billing name on 
  the account.) To verify that your number 
  is in the Registry, go to <a href="http://www.donotcall.gov" target="_blank">www.donotcall.gov</a> or call 1-888-382-1222 (TTY: 1-866-290-4236). 
  Each time you re-register, telemarketers 
  will have 31 days to take your number off 
  their call lists.<br />
          <h3>
            What If My Area 
                    Code &#8220;Splits&#8221;?</h3>
          <li><h4> If my area code 
  changes, do I need to re-register?</h4></li>
<p>If the phone companies 
  change the three-digit area code for your 
  home or mobile phone number, you do not 
  have to re-register it with the National 
  Do Not Call Registry. The number with the 
  new area code will be registered for you 
  during the 90-day period when both the old 
  and new area codes work. This is known as 
  the Permissive Dialing Period. </p>
<li><h4> Do I need to delete 
  registration of my number with the old area 
  code?</h4></li>
<p>No. You do not need to 
  delete the registration of your phone number 
  with the old area code. An automated process 
  will remove it after 90-day Permissive Dialing 
  Period.</p>
<h3>
  <br />
  Registration and My Email Address </h3>
<li><h4> Why do you need my email address?</h4></li>
<p>When you use the registry&#8217;s 
  website to put a phone number on the National 
  Do Not Call Registry, we collect your email 
  address to confirm your request. We will 
  send you an email and you will need to click 
  on the link in the email within 72 hours 
  to finalize your registration. We also collect 
  your email address when you request to verify 
  your registration online so that we can 
  email you a response to your verification 
  request. We will store your email address 
  in a secure manner, separate from your telephone 
  number. We will not share your email address 
  with telemarketers. </p>
<li><h4> Can I register 
  online if I do not have an active email 
  address?</h4></li>
<p>No. The online registration 
  process requires an active email address. 
  If you register online, we will send you 
  an email message with a link in it. You 
  need to click on the link in the email within 
  72 hours to finalize your registration. 
  If you do not have an email address, you 
  can register by phone <br />
  (1-888-382-1222).</p>
<li><h4>Can I reply to 
  the email I got when I was registering?</h4></li>
<p>No. The email address 
  is a one-way mail service. It cannot accept 
  incoming emails. You must click on the link 
  within the email within 72 hours to finalize 
  your registration.</p>
<li><h4> What if my email 
  address changes after I register? Will I 
  still be able to verify my registration 
  on the national registry?</h4></li>
<p>Yes, you will be able 
  to use your new email address to verify 
  your phone number online.</p>

  I&#8217;m Having Problems With Registration</h3>
<li><h4> I called to register 
  my phone number, but the message said my 
  phone number could not be verified. Why 
  not?</h4></li>
<p>When you call to register 
  a phone number, you are asked to enter the 
  number you are calling from. The system 
  tries to match the number you enter to &#8220;Automatic 
  Number Identification&#8221; or ANI, which 
  is like Caller ID for the telephone network. 
  A small percentage of U.S. phones do not 
  have ANI. If your phone doesn&#8217;t, the 
  system will have trouble locating your phone 
  number. You can register your phone number 
  on the National Do Not Call Registry website 
  at <a href="http://www.donotcall.gov" target="_blank">www.donotcall.gov</a>.</p>
<li><h4> I called to register 
  my phone number, but the message said that 
  the phone number I was calling from did 
  not match the phone number I entered. What 
  happened?</h4></li>
<p>To register, you must 
  call from the phone you want to register. 
  For example, you cannot register your home 
  phone number by calling from work. </p>
<p>Also, people in certain 
  communities &#8212; such as senior living 
  centers or university residences &#8212; 
  have phone numbers that are hidden by a 
  PBX (private branch exchange) telephone 
  system and cannot be matched by the National 
  Do Not Call system. If you live in such 
  a community, you can register your phone 
  number on the National Do Not Call Registry 
  website at <a href="http://www.donotcall.gov" target="_blank">www.donotcall.gov</a>.</p>
<li><h4> I received an email from Register@donotcall.gov, 
  but I don&#8217;t get a &#8220;Registration 
  Complete&#8221; message when I try to click 
  on the link. What should I do? </h4></li>
<p>You may not be able to 
  click on the link in your email from Register@donotcall.gov, 
  or it may take you to a page that says &#8220;Registration 
  Incomplete.&#8221; You can complete your 
  registration by using the &#8220;cut&#8221; 
  and &#8220;paste&#8221; functions to insert 
  the link in the email into the &#8220;address&#8221; 
  line on your Web browser. You must cut and 
  paste the entire link. It is very long &#8212; 
  possibly more than one line of text. You 
  cannot re-type the link.</p>

  Will All Telemarketing Calls Stop If I Register?</h3>
<li><h4> If I register my number on the National 
  Do Not Call Registry, will it stop all telemarketing 
  calls?</h4></li>
<p>No. Placing your number 
  on the National Do Not Call Registry will 
  stop most telemarketing calls, but not all. 
  Because of limitations in the jurisdiction 
  of the FTC and FCC, calls from or on behalf 
  of political organizations, charities, and 
  telephone surveyors would still be permitted, 
  as would calls from companies with which 
  you have an existing business relationship, 
  or those to whom you&#8217;ve provided express 
  agreement in writing to receive their calls. </p>
<li><h4> Are calls from 
  political organizations or calls soliciting 
  for charities covered?</h4></li>
<p>Political solicitations 
  are not covered by the TSR at all, since 
  they are not included in its definition 
  of &#8220;telemarketing.&#8221; Charities 
  are not covered by the requirements of the 
  national registry. However, if a third-party 
  telemarketer is calling on behalf of a charity, 
  a consumer may ask not to receive any more 
  calls from, or on behalf of, that specific 
  charity. If a third-party telemarketer calls 
  again on behalf of that charity, the telemarketer 
  may be subject to a fine of up to $11,000.</p>
<li><h4> What about telephone 
  surveys?</h4></li>
<p>If the call is really 
  for the sole purpose of conducting a survey, 
  it is not covered. Only telemarketing calls 
  are covered &#8212; that is, calls that 
  solicit sales of goods or services. Callers 
  purporting to take a survey, but also offering 
  to sell goods or services, must comply with 
  the National Do Not Call Registry.</p>
<li><h4> My number is on 
  the National Do Not Call Registry. After 
  I bought something from a company, a telemarketer 
  representing that organization called me. 
  Is this a violation?</h4></li>
<p> No. By purchasing something 
  from the company, you established a business 
  relationship with the company. As a result, 
  even if you put your number on the National 
  Do Not Call Registry, that company may call 
  you for up to 18 months after your last 
  purchase or delivery from it, or your last 
  payment to it, unless you ask the company 
  not to call again. In that case, the company 
  must honor your request not to call. If 
  they subsequently call you again, they may 
  be subject to a fine of up to $11,000.</p>
<p>An established business 
  relationship with a company also will be 
  created if you make an inquiry to the company, 
  or submit an application to it. This kind 
  of established business relationship exists 
  for three months after the inquiry or application. 
  During this time, the company can call you. </p>
<p>If you make a specific 
  request to that company not to call you, 
  however, then the company may not call you, 
  even if you have an established business 
  relationship with that company.</p>
<li><h4> Are telemarketing 
  calls from overseas covered?</h4></li>
<p>Yes. Any telemarketers 
  calling U.S. consumers are covered, regardless 
  of where they are calling from. If a company 
  within the U.S. solicits sales through an 
  overseas professional telemarketer, that 
  U.S. company may be liable for any violations 
  by the telemarketer. The FTC can initiate 
  enforcement actions against such companies.</p>
<h3><br />
  Other Ways To Limit Telemarketing Calls</h3>
<li><h4> I&#8217;m happy 
  to have the choice to limit telemarketing 
  contacts, but there are some telemarketing 
  calls I don&#8217;t mind receiving. Is there 
  a way to allow only certain companies to 
  call?</h4></li>
<p>Yes. If you give a company 
  your written permission to call you, they 
  may do so even if you have placed your number 
  on the National Do Not Call Registry. </p>
<li><h4> If I don&#8217;t 
  want to put my number on the National Do 
  Not Call Registry, can I still stop telemarketers 
  from calling?</h4></li>
<p>Yes. Even if you do not 
  register with the National Do Not Call Registry, 
  you can still prohibit individual telemarketers 
  from calling by asking them to put you on 
  their company&#8217;s do not call list.</p>
<li><h4> What is the relationship 
  between the state do not call lists and 
  the National Do Not Call Registry in terms 
  of coverage?</h4></li>
<p>The National Do Not Call 
  Registry requirements are at least as stringent 
  as most state laws. Most unwanted telemarketing 
  calls will be covered by the National Do 
  Not Call Registry. States also can continue 
  to enforce their laws, which will not be 
  limited by the FTC. However, the FCC&#8217;s 
  requirements impact some state laws. For 
  information on the FCC&#8217;s rule, visit <a href="http://www.fcc.gov" target="_blank">www.fcc.gov</a>.</p>
<h3><br />
  Filing a Do Not Call Complaint</h3>
<li><h4> When can I file 
  a do not call complaint?</h4></li>
<p>If your number has been 
  on the National Do Not Call Registry for 
  at least 31 days and you receive a call from a telemarketer 
  that you believe is covered by the National 
  Do Not Call Registry, you can file a complaint 
  at the registry&#8217;s website at <a href="http://www.donotcall.gov" target="_blank">www.donotcall.gov</a> or by calling the registry&#8217;s toll-free 
  number at 1-888-382-1222 (TTY: 
  1-866-290-4236). To file a complaint, you 
  must know either the name or telephone number 
  of the company that called you, and the 
  date the company called you. </p>
<li><h4> How do I file a 
  do not call complaint? What do I need to 
  file a complaint?</h4></li>
<p>You can file your complaint 
  on the registry&#8217;s website, <a href="http://www.donotcall.gov" target="_blank">www.donotcall.gov</a>, 
  using the File a Complaint page. You must 
  know either the name or the phone number 
  of the company that called you. You also 
  must provide the date that the company called 
  you and your registered phone number. You 
  may provide your name and address, but it&#8217;s 
  not required for you to submit a complaint. 
  You also may call the registry&#8217;s toll-free 
  number 1-888-382-1222 
  (TTY: 1-866-290-4236) to file a complaint.</p>
<li><h4>What happens to 
  my complaint?</h4></li>
<p>Do not call complaints 
  will be entered into the FTC&#8217;s Consumer 
  Sentinel system, a secure online database 
  available to more than 1,000 civil and criminal 
  law enforcement agencies. While the FTC 
  does not resolve individual consumer problems, 
  your complaint will help us investigate 
  the company and could lead to law enforcement 
  action.</p>
<li><h4> What if I get a 
  telemarketing call, but can&#8217;t get 
  the telemarketer&#8217;s name or phone number?</h4></li>
<p>For law enforcement officials 
  to take action on your complaint, they need 
  either the telemarketer&#8217;s name or 
  phone number, as well as the date of the 
  call. If you want to report a do not call 
  violation, please get that information.</p>
