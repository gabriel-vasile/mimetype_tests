          <p><b>May 18, 2004: </b> On a two-year trip to Mars, according to one 
            estimate, a crew of six humans will generate more than six tons of 
            solid organic waste--much of it feces. So what do you do with all 
            that? 
          <p>Right now, astronaut waste gets shipped back to Earth. But for long-term 
          exploration, you'd want to recycle it, because it holds resources that 
          astronauts will need. It will provide pure drinking water. It will provide 
          fertilizer. And, with the help of a recently discovered microbe, it 
          will also provide electricity.</p> 
          <p><a href="images/wastenot/geobacter1.jpg"><img src="images/wastenot/geobacter1_med.jpg" alt="see caption" width="270" height="191" border="1" align="right"></a>Like 
            many bacteria, this one, a member of the <em>Geobacteraceae</em> family, 
            feeds on, and can decompose, organic material. <em>Geobacter</em> 
            microbes were first discovered in the muck of the Potomac River in 
            1987; they like to live in places where there's no oxygen and plenty 
            of iron. They also have the unexpected ability to move electrons into 
            metal. That means that under the right conditions, <em>Geobacter</em> 
            microbes can both process waste and generate electricity.</p>

          <p>The &quot;right conditions&quot; might be found in a new type of

                  </TABLE>All fuel cells generate electricity by producing and controlling 
            a flow of electrons. Conventional cells, including ones used onboard 
            the space shuttle and in some prototype automobiles, obtain the electrons 
            for their electron flow by pulling them off of hydrogen atoms. In 
            order to do that, these fuel cells must be given a constant supply 
            of hydrogen.</p>
          <p>Microbial fuel cells obtain their electrons, instead, from organic 
            waste. The bacteria at the heart of the device feed on the waste, 
            and, as part of their digestive process, they pull electrons from 
            the waste material. <em>Geobacter</em> microbes, as well as a few 
            other types, can be coaxed to deliver these electrons directly to 
            a fuel cell electrode, which conducts them into a circuit -- a wire, 
            for example. As they flow through the circuit, they generate electricity.</p>
          <p>Microbial fuel cells are already being experimented with on Earth. 
            For example, one prototype is being used at Pennsylvania State University 
            to generate electricity as it purifies domestic wastewater.</p>
          <p>To make this idea practical for space travel, says Rittmann, you 
            have to have &quot;a very efficient, very compact configuration.&quot; 
            The fuel cell can't take up much room. To meet this requirement, Rittmann 
            is considering a fuel cell of tightly packed fibers, each one of which 
            will be a fuel cell all by itself.</p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a href="images/wastenot/fuelcell1.gif"><img src="images/wastenot/fuelcell1_med.jpg" alt="see caption" width="260" height="208" border="1" align="left"></a><strong>Left:</strong> 
            In a conventional fuel cell, such as the one pictured here, electrons 
            extracted from hydrogen flow through a circuit and do work--e.g., 
            lighting a light bulb. In a microbial membrane fuel cell, electrons 
            are drawn from human waste. Image credit: <a href="http://www.fuelcelltoday.com">Fuel 
            Cell Today</a>.</font></p>
          <p>Each fiber would consist of three layers, like three straws, one 
            inside of another. Each layer corresponds to one of the layers of 
            a fuel cell: the anode (outer), the electrolyte-membrane (middle), 
            and the cathode (inner). A slurry of liquefied waste would be pumped 
            past the outer layers where <em>Geobacter</em> microbes (or other 
            similar bacteria) can grab electrons and move them to the anode, into 
            the circuit, and then to the cathode.</p>
          <p>Before any such designs can be put into practice, however, Rittmann 
            and his team must first decipher the exact mechanism by which the 
            bacterium transfers electrons to the electrode. In laboratory tests 
            so far, the transfer rate is too slow. &quot;We need to know how we 
            can make that faster,&quot; Rittmann says, &quot;and so generate more 
            power.&quot;</p>
          <p>He has a couple of ideas about what the holdup might be. &quot;The 
            electron actually has to move from the outer surface of the microbe 
            to the electrode, and it could be that it's limited by physical contact.&quot; 
            Even though the bacteria lives attached on the surface of the anode, 
            only a tiny bit of each microbe actually touches the metal, and that 
            may be hindering electron movement.</p>
          <p>Another factor is the voltage on the electrode. It has to be high 
            enough to coax the microbes into giving up their electrons. &quot;Microbes 
            move electrons around in order to gain energy. In fact, they only 
            move the electrons when they do gain energy,&quot; he explains. What's 
            the best voltage? &quot;That's one of the questions we're trying to 
            answer.&quot; </p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><a href="http://www.civil.northwestern.edu/ehe/html_ber/rittmann.html"><img src="images/wastenot/rittman1_med.gif" border="0" align="right"></a>Right:</strong></font>

            University. [<a href="http://www.civil.northwestern.edu/ehe/html_ber/rittmann.html">More</a>]</font></p>
          <p>&quot;Let's say, for example, that the total voltage difference between 
            the fuel and the anode is 2 volts. Then the microorganisms, as they 
            give up their electrons, might take 0.5 volts to sustain themselves, 
            leaving 1.5 volts for doing work in the circuit. These are just made-up 
            numbers,&quot; says Rittmann, &quot;but they illustrate what we are 
            trying to learn.&quot;</p>
          <p>The membrane microbial fuel cell is still in the early stages of 
            its development. Yet, if the project succeeds, we may find these devices 
            not only in space, but also in our own homes. After all, astronauts 
            aren't the only ones that produce organic waste.</p>
          <p>&quot;You have to treat the wastes anyway,&quot; points out Rittmann. 
            &quot;So why not make the process an energy gainer, instead of an 
            energy loser? By producing electricity, microbial fuel cells would 
            make the process of purifying waste streams much more economical.&quot;</p>
          <p>Moreover, he says, &quot;they change our focus. Microbial fuel cells 
            transform something we think of as undesirable into a resource.&quot;

          <p>Waste? Maybe not....</p>
