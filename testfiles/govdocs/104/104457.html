    made to the public by the transmitting facility whose signals are being received 
    and further transmitted by the secondary transmission service, regardless 
    of where or when the performance or display was first transmitted.</p>
<p class="first-level">A &#8220;secondary transmission&#8221; is the further transmitting 
    of a primary transmission simultaneously with the primary transmission, or 
    nonsimultaneously with the primary transmission if by a &#8220;cable system&#8221; 
    not located in whole or in part within the boundary of the forty-eight contiguous 
    States, Hawaii, or Puerto Rico: <i>Provided, however,</i> That a nonsimultaneous 
    further transmission by a cable system located in Hawaii of a primary transmission 
    shall be deemed to be a secondary transmission if the carriage of the television 
    broadcast signal comprising such further transmission is permissible under 
    the rules, regulations, or authorizations of the Federal Communications Commission.</p>
<p class="first-level">A &#8220;cable system&#8221; is a facility, located in 
    any State, Territory, Trust Territory, or Possession, that in whole or in 
    part receives signals transmitted or programs broadcast by one or more television 
    broadcast stations licensed by the Federal Communications Commission, and 
    makes secondary transmissions of such signals or programs by wires, cables, 
    microwave, or other communications channels to subscribing members of the 
    public who pay for such service. For purposes of determining the royalty fee 
    under subsection (d)(1), two or more cable systems in contiguous communities 
    under common ownership or control or operating from one headend shall be considered 
    as one system.</p>
<p class="first-level">The &#8220;local service area of a primary transmitter&#8221;,

    such station is entitled to insist upon its signal being retransmitted by 
    a cable system pursuant to the rules, regulations, and authorizations of the 
    Federal Communications Commission in effect on April 15, 1976, or such station's 
    television market as defined in section 76.55(e) of title 47, Code of Federal 
    Regulations (as in effect on September 18, 1993), or any modifications to 
    such television market made, on or after September 18, 1993, pursuant to section 
    76.55(e) or 76.59 of title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations, or in the 
    case of a television broadcast station licensed by an appropriate governmental 
    authority of Canada or Mexico, the area in which it would be entitled to insist 
    upon its signal being retransmitted if it were a television broadcast station 
    subject to such rules, regulations, and authorizations. In the case of a low 
    power television station, as defined by the rules and regulations of the Federal 
    Communications Commission, the &#8220;local service area of a primary transmitter&#8221; 
    comprises the area within 35 miles of the transmitter site, except that in 
    the case of such a station located in a standard metropolitan statistical 
    area which has one of the 50 largest populations of all standard metropolitan 
    statistical areas (based on the 1980 decennial census of population taken 
    by the Secretary of Commerce), the number of miles shall be 20 miles. The &#8220;local service area of a primary transmitter&#8221;, in the case of a 
    radio broadcast station, comprises the primary service area of such station, 
    pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Federal Communications Commission.</p>
<p class="first-level">A &#8220;distant signal equivalent&#8221; is the value 
    assigned to the secondary transmission of any nonnetwork television programming 
    carried by a cable system in whole or in part beyond the local service area

    a value of one to each independent station and a value of one-quarter to each 
    network station and noncommercial educational station for the nonnetwork programming 
    so carried pursuant to the rules, regulations, and authorizations of the Federal 
    Communications Commission. The foregoing values for independent, network, 
    and noncommercial educational stations are subject, however, to the following 
    exceptions and limitations. Where the rules and regulations of the Federal 
    Communications Commission require a cable system to omit the further transmission 
    of a particular program and such rules and regulations also permit the substitution 
    of another program embodying a performance or display of a work in place of 
    the omitted transmission, or where such rules and regulations in effect on 
    the date of enactment of this Act permit a cable system, at its election, 
    to effect such deletion and substitution of a nonlive program or to carry 
    additional programs not transmitted by primary transmitters within whose local 
    service area the cable system is located, no value shall be assigned for the 
    substituted or additional program; where the rules, regulations, or authorizations 
    of the Federal Communications Commission in effect on the date of enactment 
    of this Act permit a cable system, at its election, to omit the further transmission 
    of a particular program and such rules, regulations, or authorizations also 
    permit the substitution of another program embodying a performance or display 
    of a work in place of the omitted transmission, the value assigned for the 
    substituted or additional program shall be, in the case of a live program, 
    the value of one full distant signal equivalent multiplied by a fraction that 
    has as its numerator the number of days in the year in which such substitution 
    occurs and as its denominator the number of days in the year. In the case 
    of a station carried pursuant to the late-night or specialty programming rules 
    of the Federal Communications Commission, or a station carried on a part-time 
    basis where full-time carriage is not possible because the cable system lacks 
    the activated channel capacity to retransmit on a full-time basis all signals 
    which it is authorized to carry, the values for independent, network, and 
    noncommercial educational stations set forth above, as the case may be, shall 
    be multiplied by a fraction which is equal to the ratio of the broadcast hours 
    of such station carried by the cable system to the total broadcast hours of 
    the station.</p>
<p class="first-level">A &#8220;network station&#8221; is a television broadcast

    by this subsection, to make no more than 1 phonorecord of the sound recording 
    (unless the terms and conditions of the statutory license allow for more), 
    if the following conditions are satisfied:</p>
<p class="thirdlevel">(A) The phonorecord is retained and used solely by the 
    transmitting organization that made it, and no further phonorecords are reproduced 
    from it.</p>
<p class="thirdlevel">(B) The phonorecord is used solely for the transmitting 
    organization's own transmissions originating in the United States under a 
    statutory license in accordance with <a href="92chap1.html#114">section 114(f)</a> 
    or the limitation on exclusive rights specified by <a href="92chap1.html#114">section

<p class="thirdlevel">(C) Unless preserved exclusively for purposes of archival 
    preservation, the phonorecord is destroyed within 6 months from the date the

<p class="thirdlevel">(D) Phonorecords of the sound recording have been distributed 
    to the public under the authority of the copyright owner or the copyright 
    owner authorizes the transmitting entity to transmit the sound recording, 
    and the transmitting entity makes the phonorecord under this subsection from 
    a phonorecord lawfully made and acquired under the authority of the copyright 
    owner.</p>
<p class="secondlevel">(2) Notwithstanding any provision of the antitrust laws, 
    any copyright owners of sound recordings and any transmitting organizations 
    entitled to a statutory license under this subsection may negotiate and agree 
    upon royalty rates and license terms and conditions for making phonorecords 
    of such sound recordings under this section and the proportionate division 
    of fees paid among copyright owners, and may designate common agents to negotiate, 
    agree to, pay, or receive such royalty payments.</p>
<p class="secondlevel">(3) Proceedings under chapter 8 shall determine reasonable
  rates and terms of royalty payments for the activities specified by paragraph
  (1) during the 5-year period beginning on January 1 of the second year following
  the year in which the proceedings are to be commenced, or such other period
  as the parties may agree. Such rates shall include a minimum fee for each type
  of service offered by transmitting organizations. Any copyright owners of sound
  recordings or any transmitting organizations entitled to a statutory license
  under this subsection may submit to the Copyright Royalty Judges licenses covering
  such activities with respect to such sound recordings. The parties to each
  proceeding shall bear their own costs.</p>
<p class="secondlevel">(4) The schedule of reasonable rates and terms determined
  by the Copyright Royalty Judges shall, subject to paragraph (5), be binding
  on all copyright owners of sound recordings and transmitting organizations
  entitled to a statutory license under this subsection during the 5-year period
  specified in paragraph (3), or such other period as the parties may agree.
  Such rates shall include a minimum fee for each type of service offered by
  transmitting organizations. The Copyright Royalty Judges shall establish rates
  that most clearly represent the fees that would have been negotiated in the
  marketplace between a willing buyer and a willing seller. In determining such
  rates and terms, the Copyright Royalty Judges shall base their decision on
  economic, competitive, and programming information presented by the parties,
  including &#8212;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="thirdlevel">(A) whether use of the service may substitute for or may 
    promote the sales of phonorecords or otherwise interferes with or enhances 
    the copyright owner's traditional streams of revenue; and</p>
<p class="thirdlevel">(B) the relative roles of the copyright owner and the 
    transmitting organization in the copyrighted work and the service made available 
    to the public with respect to relative creative contribution, technological 
    contribution, capital investment, cost, and risk.</p>
<p class="firstlevel">In establishing such rates and terms, the Copyright Royalty
  Judges may consider the rates and terms under voluntary license agreements
  described in paragraphs (2) and (3). The Copyright Royalty Judges shall also
  establish requirements by which copyright owners may receive reasonable notice
  of the use of their sound recordings under this section, and under which records
  of such use shall be kept and made available by transmitting organizations
  entitled to obtain a statutory license under this subsection.</p>
<p class="secondlevel">(5) License agreements voluntarily negotiated at any time
  between 1 or more copyright owners of sound recordings and 1 or more transmitting
  organizations entitled to obtain a statutory license under this subsection
  shall be given effect in lieu of any decision by the Librarian of Congress
  or determination by the Copyright Royalty Judges.</p>
<p class="secondlevel">    (6)(A) Any person who wishes to make a phonorecord of a sound recording under
    a statutory license in accordance with this subsection may do so without
    infringing the exclusive right of the copyright owner of the sound recording
    under section 106(1)&mdash; </p>
<p class="fourthlevel">(i) by complying with such notice requirements
  as the Copyright Royalty Judges shall prescribe by regulation and by paying
  royalty fees in accordance with this subsection; or</p>
<p class="fourthlevel"> (ii) if such royalty
  fees have not been set, by agreeing to pay such royalty fees as shall be
  determined in accordance with this subsection. </p>
<p class="thirdlevel">(B) Any royalty payments in

  the month in which the royalty fees are set.</p>
<p class="secondlevel">(7) If a transmitting organization entitled to make a
   phonorecord under this subsection is prevented from making such phonorecord
   by reason of the application by the copyright owner of technical measures
   that prevent the reproduction of the sound recording, the copyright owner
   shall make available to the transmitting organization the necessary means
   for permitting the making of such phonorecord as permitted under this subsection,
   if it is technologically feasible and economically reasonable for the copyright
   owner to do so. If the copyright owner fails to do so in a timely manner in
   light of the transmitting organization's reasonable business requirements,
   the transmitting organization shall not be liable for a violation of <a href="92chap12.html#1201">section
    1201(a)(1)</a> of this title for engaging in such activities as are necessary
     to make such phonorecords as permitted under this subsection.</p>
<p class="secondlevel">(8) Nothing in this subsection annuls, limits, impairs,
   or otherwise affects in any way the existence or value of any of the exclusive
   rights of the copyright owners in a sound recording, except as otherwise provided
   in this subsection, or in a musical work, including the exclusive rights to
   reproduce and distribute a sound recording or musical work, including by means

<p class="firstlevel">(j) <span class="smallcaps">Definitions.</span>&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;As 
    used in this section, the following terms have the following meanings:</p>
<p class="secondlevel">(l) An &#8220;affiliated entity&#8221; is an entity engaging 
    in digital audio transmissions covered by <a href="92chap1.html#106">section 
    106(6),</a> other than an interactive service, in which the licensor has any 
    direct or indirect partnership or any ownership interest amounting to 5 percent 
    or more of the outstanding voting or non-voting stock.</p>
<p class="secondlevel">(2) An &#8220;archived program&#8221; is a predetermined 
    program that is available repeatedly on the demand of the transmission recipient 
    and that is performed in the same order from the beginning, except that an 
    archived program shall not include a recorded event or broadcast transmission 
    that makes no more than an incidental use of sound recordings, as long as 
    such recorded event or broadcast transmission does not contain an entire sound 
    recording or feature a particular sound recording.</p>
<p class="secondlevel">(3) A &#8220;broadcast&#8221; transmission is a transmission 
    made by a terrestrial broadcast station licensed as such by the Federal Communications 
    Commission.</p>
<p class="secondlevel">(4) A &#8220;continuous program&#8221; is a predetermined 
    program that is continuously performed in the same order and that is accessed 
    at a point in the program that is beyond the control of the transmission recipient.</p>
<p class="secondlevel">(5) A &#8220;digital audio transmission&#8221; is a digital 
    transmission as defined in <a href="92chap1.html#101">section 101,</a> that 
    embodies the transmission of a sound recording. This term does not include 
    the transmission of any audiovisual work.</p>
<p class="secondlevel">(6) An &#8220;eligible nonsubscription transmission&#8221; 
    is a noninteractive nonsubscription digital audio transmission not exempt 
    under subsection (d)(1) that is made as part of a service that provides audio 
    programming consisting, in whole or in part, of performances of sound recordings, 
    including retransmissions of broadcast transmissions, if the primary purpose 
    of the service is to provide to the public such audio or other entertainment 
    programming, and the primary purpose of the service is not to sell, advertise, 
    or promote particular products or services other than sound recordings, live 
    concerts, or other music-related events.</p>
<p class="secondlevel">(7) An &#8220;interactive service&#8221; is one that enables 
    a member of the public to receive a transmission of a program specially created 
    for the recipient, or on request, a transmission of a particular sound recording, 
    whether or not as part of a program, which is selected by or on behalf of 
    the recipient. The ability of individuals to request that particular sound 
    recordings be performed for reception by the public at large, or in the case 
    of a subscription service, by all subscribers of the service, does not make 
    a service interactive, if the programming on each channel of the service does 
    not substantially consist of sound recordings that are performed within 1 
    hour of the request or at a time designated by either the transmitting entity 
    or the individual making such request. If an entity offers both interactive 
    and noninteractive services (either concurrently or at different times), the 
    noninteractive component shall not be treated as part of an interactive service.</p>
<p class="secondlevel">(8) A &#8220;new subscription service&#8221; is a service 
    that performs sound recordings by means of noninteractive subscription digital 
    audio transmissions and that is not a preexisting subscription service or 
    a preexisting satellite digital audio radio service.</p>
<p class="secondlevel">(9) A &#8220;nonsubscription&#8221; transmission is any 
    transmission that is not a subscription transmission.</p>
<p class="secondlevel">(10) A &#8220;preexisting satellite digital audio radio 
    service&#8221; is a subscription satellite digital audio radio service provided 
    pursuant to a satellite digital audio radio service license issued by the 
    Federal Communications Commission on or before July 31, 1998, and any renewal 
    of such license to the extent of the scope of the original license, and may 
    include a limited number of sample channels representative of the subscription 
    service that are made available on a nonsubscription basis in order to promote 
    the subscription service.</p>
<p class="secondlevel">(11) A &#8220;preexisting subscription service&#8221; is 
    a service that performs sound recordings by means of noninteractive audio-only 
    subscription digital audio transmissions, which was in existence and was making 
    such transmissions to the public for a fee on or before July 31, 1998, and 
    may include a limited number of sample channels representative of the subscription 
    service that are made available on a nonsubscription basis in order to promote 
    the subscription service.</p>
<p class="secondlevel">(12) A &#8220;retransmission&#8221; is a further transmission 
    of an initial transmission, and includes any further retransmission of the 
    same transmission. Except as provided in this section, a transmission qualifies 
    as a &#8220;retransmission&#8221; only if it is simultaneous with the initial 
    transmission. Nothing in this definition shall be construed to exempt a transmission 
    that fails to satisfy a separate element required to qualify for an exemption 
    under <a href="92chap1.html#114">section 114(d)(1).</a></p>
<p class="secondlevel">(13) The &#8220;sound recording performance complement&#8221; 
    is the transmission during any 3-hour period, on a particular channel used 
    by a transmitting entity, of no more than&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="thirdlevel">(A) 3 different selections of sound recordings from any 
    one phonorecord lawfully distributed for public performance or sale in the 
    United States, if no more than 2 such selections are transmitted consecutively; 
    or</p>
<p class="thirdlevel">(B) 4 different selections of sound recordings&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="fourthlevel">(i) by the same featured recording artist; or</p>
<p class="fourthlevel">(ii) from any set or compilation of phonorecords lawfully 
    distributed together as a unit for public performance or sale in the United 
    States,</p>
<p class="thirdlevel">if no more than three such selections are transmitted 
    consecutively:</p>
<p class="secondlevel"><i>Provided,</i> That the transmission of selections 
    in excess of the numerical limits provided for in clauses (A) and (B) from 
    multiple phonorecords shall nonetheless qualify as a sound recording performance 
    complement if the programming of the multiple phonorecords was not willfully 
    intended to avoid the numerical limitations prescribed in such clauses.</p>
<p class="secondlevel">(14) A &#8220;subscription&#8221; transmission is a transmission 
    that is controlled and limited to particular recipients, and for which consideration 
    is required to be paid or otherwise given by or on behalf of the recipient 
    to receive the transmission or a package of transmissions including the transmission.</p>
<p class="secondlevel">(15) A &#8220;transmission&#8221; is either an initial

     works: Compulsory license for making and distributing phonorecords</a><sup><a href="#1-50" class="super-in-head">50</a></sup></h2>
<p class="body">In the case of nondramatic musical works, the exclusive rights 
    provided by clauses (1) and (3) of <a href="92chap1.html#106">section 106,</a> 
    to make and to distribute phonorecords of such works, are subject to compulsory 
    licensing under the conditions specified by this section.</p>
<p class="first-level">(a) <span class="smallcaps">Availability and Scope of 
    Compulsory License.</span>&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="secondlevel">(1) When phonorecords of a nondramatic musical work have 
    been distributed to the public in the United States under the authority of 
    the copyright owner, any other person, including those who make phonorecords 
    or digital phonorecord deliveries, may, by complying with the provisions of 
    this section, obtain a compulsory license to make and distribute phonorecords 
    of the work. A person may obtain a compulsory license only if his or her primary 
    purpose in making phonorecords is to distribute them to the public for private 
    use, including by means of a digital phonorecord delivery. A person may not 
    obtain a compulsory license for use of the work in the making of phonorecords 
    duplicating a sound recording fixed by another, unless:</p>
<p class="fourthlevel">(i) such sound recording was fixed lawfully; and</p>
<p class="fourthlevel">(ii) the making of the phonorecords was authorized by 
    the owner of copyright in the sound recording or, if the sound recording was 
    fixed before February 15, 1972, by any person who fixed the sound recording 
    pursuant to an express license from the owner of the copyright in the musical 
    work or pursuant to a valid compulsory license for use of such work in a sound 
    recording.</p>
<p class="secondlevel">(2) A compulsory license includes the privilege of making 
    a musical arrangement of the work to the extent necessary to conform it to 
    the style or manner of interpretation of the performance involved, but the 
    arrangement shall not change the basic melody or fundamental character of 
    the work, and shall not be subject to protection as a derivative work under 
    this title, except with the express consent of the copyright owner.</p>
<p class="first-level">(b) <span class="smallcaps">Notice of Intention to Obtain 
    Compulsory License.</span>&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="secondlevel">(1) Any person who wishes to obtain a compulsory license 
    under this section shall, before or within thirty days after making, and before 
    distributing any phonorecords of the work, serve notice of intention to do 
    so on the copyright owner. If the registration or other public records of 
    the Copyright Office do not identify the copyright owner and include an address 
    at which notice can be served, it shall be sufficient to file the notice of 
    intention in the Copyright Office. The notice shall comply, in form, content, 
    and manner of service, with requirements that the Register of Copyrights shall 
    prescribe by regulation.</p>
<p class="secondlevel">(2) Failure to serve or file the notice required by clause 
    (1) forecloses the possibility of a compulsory license and, in the absence 
    of a negotiated license, renders the making and distribution of phonorecords 
    actionable as acts of infringement under <a href="92chap5.html#501">section 
    501</a> and fully subject to the remedies provided by <a href="92chap5.html#502">sections

<p class="first-level">(c) <span class="smallcaps">Royalty Payable under Compulsory
     License.</span><sup><a href="#1-51">51</a></sup>&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="secondlevel">(1) To be entitled to receive royalties under a compulsory 
    license, the copyright owner must be identified in the registration or other 
    public records of the Copyright Office. The owner is entitled to royalties 
    for phonorecords made and distributed after being so identified, but is not 
    entitled to recover for any phonorecords previously made and distributed.</p>
<p class="secondlevel">(2) Except as provided by clause (1), the royalty under
   a compulsory license shall be payable for every phonorecord made and distributed
   in accordance with the license. For this purpose, and other than as provided
   in paragraph (3), a phonorecord is considered &#8220;distributed&#8221; if
   the  person exercising the compulsory license has voluntarily and permanently
   parted  with its possession. With respect to each work embodied in the phonorecord,
    the royalty shall be either two and three-fourths cents, or one-half of one
    cent per minute of playing time or fraction thereof, whichever amount is
   larger.</p>
<p class="secondlevel">(3)(A) A compulsory license under this section includes 
    the right of the compulsory licensee to distribute or authorize the distribution 
    of a phonorecord of a nondramatic musical work by means of a digital transmission 
    which constitutes a digital phonorecord delivery, regardless of whether the 
    digital transmission is also a public performance of the sound recording under 
    <a href="92chap1.html#106">section 106(6)</a> of this title or of any nondramatic 
    musical work embodied therein under <a href="92chap1.html#106">section 106(4)</a> 
    of this title. For every digital phonorecord delivery by or under the authority 
    of the compulsory licensee&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="fourthlevel">(i) on or before December 31, 1997, the royalty payable

<p class="fourthlevel">(ii) on or after January 1, 1998, the royalty payable
   by the compulsory licensee shall be the royalty prescribed under subparagraphs

<p class="thirdlevel">(B) Notwithstanding any provision of the antitrust laws,
  any copyright owners of nondramatic musical works and any persons entitled
  to obtain a compulsory license under subsection (a)(1) may negotiate and agree
  upon the terms and rates of royalty payments this section and the proportionate
  division of fees paid among copyright owners, and may designate common agents
  to negotiate, agree to, pay or receive such royalty payments. Such authority
  to negotiate the terms and rates of royalty payments includes, but is not limited
  to, the authority to negotiate the year during which the royalty rates prescribed
  under  this subparagraph and subparagraphs (C) through (E) and <a href="92chap8.html">chapter

    year following the year in which the petition requesting the proceeding is
    filed, and ending on the effective date of successor rates and terms, or
    such other period as the parties may agree.</span> Such terms and rates shall
    distinguish between (i) digital phonorecord deliveries where the reproduction
    or distribution of a phonorecord is incidental to the transmission which
    constitutes the digital phonorecord delivery, and (ii) digital phonorecord
    deliveries in general. Any copyright owners of nondramatic musical works
    and any persons entitled to obtain a compulsory license under subsection
    (a)(1) may submit to the Copyright Royalty Judges licenses covering such
    activities. The parties to each proceeding shall bear their own costs.</p>
<p class="thirdlevel">(D) <span class="body">The schedule of reasonable rates
    and terms determined by the Copyright Royalty Judges shall, subject to subparagraph
    (E), be binding on all copyright owners of nondramatic musical works and
    persons entitled to obtain a compulsory license under subsection (a)(1) during
    the period specified in subparagraph (C), such other period as may be determined

    to the objectives set forth in section 801(b)(1), in establishing such rates
    and terms, the Copyright Royalty Judges may consider rates and terms under
    voluntary license agreements described in subparagraphs (B) and (C). The
    royalty rates payable for a compulsory license for a digital phonorecord
    delivery under this section shall be established de novo and no precedential
    effect shall be given to the amount of the royalty payable by a compulsory
    licensee for digital phonorecord deliveries on or before December 31, 1997.
    The Copyright Royalty Judges shall also establish requirements by which copyright
    owners may receive reasonable notice of the use of their works under this

    by persons making digital phonorecord deliveries.</p>
<p class="thirdlevel">(E)(i)  License agreements voluntarily negotiated at any
  time between one or more copyright owners of nondramatic musical works and
  one or more persons entitled to obtain a compulsory license under subsection
  (a)(1) shall be given effect in lieu of any determination by the Librarian
  of Congress and Copyright Royalty Judges. Subject to clause (ii), the royalty
  rates determined pursuant to subparagraph (C) and (D) shall be given effect
  as to digital phonorecord deliveries in lieu of any contrary royalty rates
  specified in a contract pursuant to which a recording artist who is the author
  of a nondramatic musical work grants a license under that person's
  exclusive rights in the musical work under paragraphs (1) and (3) of <a href="92chap1.html#106">section

  if a contract entered into on or before June 22, 1995, is modified thereafter
  for the purpose of increasing the number of musical works within the scope
  of the contract, any contrary royalty rates specified in the contract shall
  be given effect in lieu of royalty rates determined pursuant to subparagraph
  (C) and (D) for the number of musical works within the scope of the contract
  as of June 22, 1995; and</p>
<p class="fifthlevel">(II) a contract entered into after the date that the sound 
    recording is fixed in a tangible medium of expression substantially in a form 
    intended for commercial release, if at the time the contract is entered into, 
    the recording artist retains the right to grant licenses as to the musical 
    work under paragraphs (1) and (3) of <a href="92chap1.html#106">section 106.</a></p>
