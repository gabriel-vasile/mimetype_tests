<BR><BR>FIELD OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>[0001] The invention relates to programming languages and in particular to
     an operator within a language that evaluates to "True" when two operands
     point to different locations in memory.
<BR><BR>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>[0002] BASIC, (Beginner's All Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code), was
     designed to be an easy-to-learn programming language that makes
     programming easier by providing an intuitive, English-like syntax in
     which to code. One of the ways in which BASIC eases programming tasks is
     by not requiring the use of pointer arithmetic. For example, referring
     now to FIG. 1a, when a BASIC program is executing, a memory buffer 250
     (typically a heap) is created in RAM (random access memory) to store
     application data. When a new object is created, space for the object is
     allocated on the heap. The new object is represented in FIG. 1a by the
     box labeled 252, representing a location in memory where the new object
     is stored. For example, suppose the following BASIC code defining a class
     x is executed:
<BR><BR>[0003] Class x
<BR><BR>[0004] Dim y As Integer
<BR><BR>[0005] End Class
<BR><BR>[0006] Class x in this case is defined to contain a member of type
     "Integer", which is to say that if the item stored at memory location 252
     is a variable of class x, the contents of memory location 252 will
     comprise an Integer. Suppose now that the following code is executed:
<BR><BR>[0007] Dim a As x
<BR><BR>[0008] a=New x( )
<BR><BR>[0009] The first line of code defines variable a to be of class x while
     the second line creates a new instance of x 254 on the heap, a pointer to
     which is stored in variable a 256.
<BR><BR>[0010] In BASIC, an operator called "Is" allows a comparison of two
     variables to determine if both variables are pointing to the same memory
     location. For example, when executing the following code:
<BR><BR>1
      Dim a, b As x
      a = New x( )
      b = New x(
     )
      If a Is b Then
      (Perform Z)
      End If
<BR><BR>[0011] Suppose the code represented by the ellipses above has resulted in
     the situation illustrated in FIG. 1a: variable a 256 is pointing to
     memory location 254 while variable b 258 is pointing to memory location
     260. Hence, Z will not be performed because variables a and b do not
     point to the same memory location. It will be noted that, the execution
     of the statement "a Is b" thus determines whether or not the variables a
     and b point to the same memory location rather than whether or not a is
     equal to b. In contrast, consider the following code:
<BR><BR>2
      Dim a, c As x
      a = New x( )
      c = New x(
     )
      .
      .
      .
      If a Is c Then
      (Perform
     Z)
      End If
<BR><BR>[0012] Suppose the code represented by the ellipses has resulted in the
     situation illustrated in FIG. 1b: variable a 256 is pointing to memory
     location 254 and variable c 262 is also pointing to memory location 256.
     When the If statement is executed, Z will be performed because variables
     a 256 and c 262 both point to the same location (location 254) in memory.
<BR><BR>[0013] Similarly, (for example), if a user wanted to perform Z if the
     variables a and b do not point to the same memory location, the following
     code, combining two operators, "Is" and "Not" (a negation of the
     expression) would be required:
<BR><BR>3
      Dim a, b As x
      a = New x( )
      b = New x(
     )
      .
      .
      .
      If Not (a Is b) Then
     (Perform Z)
      End If
<BR><BR>[0014] Such a language construction is ungrammatical, requires more typing
     and violates the philosophy on which BASIC rests. It would be helpful
     therefore, if a single more intuitive operator could perform the function
     that the combination of the two operators Is and Not typically performs.
<BR><BR>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>[0015] A system, method and computer-readable medium support the use of a
     single operator that allows a comparison of two variables to determine if
     the two variables point to different locations in memory, that is, the
     reverse of the existing "Is" operator in a BASIC programming language or
     a derivative of BASIC or BASIC-like programming language. In one
     embodiment of the invention, the memory locations represent objects. The
     new operator enables a user to determine if the left operand (e.g., a
     reference type) "is not" the same instance as the reference type listed
     as the right operand. The use of a single operand for this concept may
     increase the readability of the programming language.

<BR><BR>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS
<BR><BR>Overview
<BR><BR>[0022] A single operator compares two operands to determine if the two
     operands point to different memory locations. The memory locations may
     represent reference types such as objects or instances of a class. For
     example, in the following code:
<BR><BR>4
      Dim x As New MyClass
      Dim y As New MyClass( )
           x = y
      If x Is y Then
      Perform (Z)
<BR><BR>[0023] Where Z represents code to continue program execution. In this
     case, "x Is y" evaluates to True, because both variables point to the
     same location in memory. In the example, x and y refer to the same
     instance of class MyClass. Hence, the program code represented by Z would
     be performed.
<BR><BR>[0024] Now consider the following code:
<BR><BR>5
      Dim x As New MyClass
      Dim y As New MyClass( )
           If x Is y Then
      Perform (Z)
<BR><BR>[0025] In this case, "x Is y" evaluates to False, because although both
     variables are of the same class (that is, belong to the same class,
     MyClass), variable x points to another instance of the class than does y.
<BR><BR>[0026] Because the Is operator is often used to ensure that a variable has
     been initialized, the negation of the operator is often used to compare
     the variable to Nothing. In BASIC, Nothing is a keyword: the value of a
     variable that has not been initialized or set to point to a particular
     memory location evaluates to "Nothing". Hence, the resulting language is
     often seen:
<BR><BR>6
      Sub Foo(ByRef x As ObjectType)
      If Not (x Is
     Nothing) Then
      Perform Z
      End If
      End Sub,
<BR><BR>[0027] which is to say, perform Z if x points to an object stored in
     memory.
<BR><BR>[0028] In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, the above
     statement "If Not (x Is Nothing)" which combines the use of two
     operators, "Is" and "Not", may be replaced with a single operator. The
     keyword for the single operator may be "IsNot", "is_not" or any other
     suitable keyword which reasonably conveys the concept of "is not".
<BR><BR>Exemplary Computing Environment
<BR><BR>[0029] FIG. 2 and the following discussion are intended to provide a brief
     general description of a suitable computing environment in which the
     invention may be implemented. It should be understood, however, that
     handheld, portable, and other computing devices of all kinds are
     contemplated for use in connection with the present invention. While a
     general purpose computer is described below, this is but one example, and
     the present invention requires only a thin client having network server
     interoperability and interaction. Thus, the present invention may be
     implemented in an environment of networked hosted services in which very
     little or minimal client resources are implicated, e.g., a networked
     environment in which the client device serves merely as a browser or
     interface to the World Wide Web.
<BR><BR>[0030] Although not required, the invention can be implemented via an
     application programming interface (API), for use by a developer, and/or
     included within the network browsing software which will be described in
     the general context of computer-executable instructions, such as program
     modules, being executed by one or more computers, such as client
     workstations, servers, or other devices. Generally, program modules
     include routines, programs, objects, components, data structures and the
     like that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data
     types. Typically, the functionality of the program modules may be
     combined or distributed as desired in various embodiments. Moreover,
     those skilled in the art will appreciate that the invention may be
     practiced with other computer system configurations. Other well known
     computing systems, environments, and/or configurations that may be
     suitable for use with the invention include, but are not limited to,
     personal computers (PCs), automated teller machines, server computers,
     hand-held or laptop devices, multi-processor systems,
     microprocessor-based systems, programmable consumer electronics, network
     PCs, minicomputers, mainframe computers, and the like. The invention may
     also be practiced in distributed computing environments where tasks are
     performed by remote processing devices that are linked through a
     communications network or other data transmission medium. In a
     distributed computing environment, program modules may be located in both
     local and remote computer storage media including memory storage devices.
<BR><BR>[0031] FIG. 2 thus illustrates an example of a suitable computing system
     environment 100 in which the invention may be implemented, although as
     made clear above, the computing system environment 100 is only one
     example of a suitable computing environment and is not intended to
     suggest any limitation as to the scope of use or functionality of the
     invention. Neither should the computing environment 100 be interpreted as
     having any dependency or requirement relating to any one or combination
     of components illustrated in the exemplary operating environment 100.
<BR><BR>[0032] With reference to FIG. 2, an exemplary system for implementing the
     invention includes a general purpose computing device in the form of a
     computer 110. Components of computer 110 may include, but are not limited
     to, a processing unit 120, a system memory 130, and a system bus 121 that
     couples various system components including the system memory to the
     processing unit 120. The system bus 121 may be any of several types of
     bus structures including a memory bus or memory controller, a peripheral
     bus, and a local bus using any of a variety of bus architectures. By way
     of example, and not limitation, such architectures include Industry
     Standard Architecture (ISA) bus, Micro Channel Architecture (MCA) bus,
     Enhanced ISA (EISA) bus, Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA)
     local bus, and Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) bus (also known as
     Mezzanine bus).
<BR><BR>[0033] Computer 110 typically includes a variety of computer readable
     media. Computer readable media can be any available media that can be
     accessed by computer 110 and includes both volatile and nonvolatile
     media, removable and non-removable media. By way of example, and not
     limitation, computer readable media may comprise computer storage media
     and communication media. Computer storage media includes both volatile
     and nonvolatile, removable and non-removable media implemented in any
     method or technology for storage of information such as computer readable
     instructions, data structures, program modules or other data. Computer
     storage media includes, but is not limited to, RAM, ROM, EEPROM, flash
     memory or other memory technology, CDROM, digital versatile disks (DVD)
     or other optical disk storage, magnetic cassettes, magnetic tape,
     magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other
     medium which can be used to store the desired information and which can
     be accessed by computer 110. Communication media typically embodies
     computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules or other
     data in a modulated data signal such as a carrier wave or other transport
     mechanism and includes any information delivery media. The term
     "modulated data signal" means a signal that has one or more of its
     characteristics set or changed in such a manner as to encode information
     in the signal. By way of example, and not limitation, communication media
     includes wired media such as a wired network or direct-wired connection,
     and wireless media such as acoustic, RF, infrared, and other wireless
     media. Combinations of any of the above should also be included within
     the scope of computer readable media.
<BR><BR>[0034] The system memory 130 includes computer storage media in the form
     of volatile and/or nonvolatile memory such as read only memory (ROM) 131
     and random access memory (RAM) 132. A basic input/output system 133
     (BIOS), containing the basic routines that help to transfer information
     between elements within computer 110, such as during start-up, is
     typically stored in ROM 131. RAM 132 typically contains data and/or
     program modules that are immediately accessible to and/or presently being
     operated on by processing unit 120. By way of example, and not
     limitation, FIG. 2 illustrates operating system 134, application programs
     135, other program modules 136, and program data 137.
<BR><BR>[0035] The computer 110 may also include other removable/non-removable,
     volatile/nonvolatile computer storage media. By way of example only, FIG.
     2 illustrates a hard disk drive 141 that reads from or writes to
     non-removable, nonvolatile magnetic media, a magnetic disk drive 151 that
     reads from or writes to a removable, nonvolatile magnetic disk 152, and
     an optical disk drive 155 that reads from or writes to a removable,
     nonvolatile optical disk 156, such as a CD ROM or other optical media.
     Other removable/non-removable, volatile/nonvolatile computer storage
     media that can be used in the exemplary operating environment include,
     but are not limited to, magnetic tape cassettes, flash memory cards,
     digital versatile disks, digital video tape, solid state RAM, solid state
     ROM, and the like. The hard disk drive 141 is typically connected to the
     system bus 121 through a non-removable memory interface such as interface
     140, and magnetic disk drive 151 and optical disk drive 155 are typically
     connected to the system bus 121 by a removable memory interface, such as
     interface 150.
<BR><BR>[0036] The drives and their associated computer storage media discussed
     above and illustrated in FIG. 2 provide storage of computer readable
     instructions, data structures, program modules and other data for the
     computer 110. In FIG. 2, for example, hard disk drive 141 is illustrated
     as storing operating system 144, application programs 145, other program
     modules 146, and program data 147. Note that these components can either
     be the same as or different from operating system 134, application
     programs 135, other program modules 136, and program data 137. Operating
     system 144, application programs 145, other program modules 146, and
     program data 147 are given different numbers here to illustrate that, at
     a minimum, they are different copies. A user may enter commands and
     information into the computer 110 through input devices such as a
     keyboard 162 and pointing device 161, commonly referred to as a mouse,
     trackball or touch pad. Other input devices (not shown) may include a
     microphone, joystick, game pad, satellite dish, scanner, or the like.
     These and other input devices are often connected to the processing unit
     120 through a user input interface 160 that is coupled to the system bus
     121, but may be connected by other interface and bus structures, such as
     a parallel port, game port or a universal serial bus (USB).
<BR><BR>[0037] A monitor 191 or other type of display device is also connected to
     the system bus 121 via an interface, such as a video interface 190. A
     graphics interface 182, such as Northbridge, may also be connected to the
     system bus 121. Northbridge is a chipset that communicates with the CPU,
     or host processing unit 120, and assumes responsibility for accelerated
     graphics port (AGP) communications. One or more graphics processing units
     (GPUs) 184 may communicate with graphics interface 182. In this regard,
     GPUs 184 generally include on-chip memory storage, such as register
     storage and GPUs 184 communicate with a video memory 186. GPUs 184,
     however, are but one example of a coprocessor and thus a variety of
     coprocessing devices may be included in computer 110. A monitor 191 or
     other type of display device is also connected to the system bus 121 via
     an interface, such as a video interface 190, which may in turn
     communicate with video memory 186. In addition to monitor 191, computers
     may also include other peripheral output devices such as speakers 197 and
     printer 196, which may be connected through an output peripheral
     interface 195.
<BR><BR>[0038] The computer 110 may operate in a networked environment using
     logical connections to one or more remote computers, such as a remote
     computer 180. The remote computer 180 may be a personal computer, a
     server, a router, a network PC, a peer device or other common network
     node, and typically includes many or all of the elements described above
     relative to the computer 110, although only a memory storage device 181
     has been illustrated in FIG. 2. The logical connections depicted in FIG.
     2 include a local area network (LAN) 171 and a wide area network (WAN)
     173, but may also include other networks. Such networking environments
     are commonplace in offices, enterprise-wide computer networks, intranets
     and the Internet.
<BR><BR>[0039] When used in a LAN networking environment, the computer 110 is
     connected to the LAN 171 through a network interface or adapter 170. When
     used in a WAN networking environment, the computer 110 typically includes
     a modem 172 or other means for establishing communications over the WAN
     173, such as the Internet. The modem 172, which may be internal or
     external, may be connected to the system bus 121 via the user input
     interface 160, or other appropriate mechanism. In a networked
     environment, program modules depicted relative to the computer 110, or
     portions thereof, may be stored in the remote memory storage device. By
     way of example, and not limitation, FIG. 2 illustrates remote application
     programs 185 as residing on memory device 181. It will be appreciated
     that the network connections shown are exemplary and other means of
     establishing a communications link between the computers may be used.
<BR><BR>[0040] One of ordinary skill in the art can appreciate that a computer 110
     or other client device can be deployed as part of a computer network. In
     this regard, the present invention pertains to any computer system having
     any number of memory or storage units, and any number of applications and
     processes occurring across any number of storage units or volumes. The
     present invention may apply to an environment with server computers and
     client computers deployed in a network environment, having remote or
     local storage. The present invention may also apply to a standalone
     computing device, having programming language functionality,
     interpretation and execution capabilities.
<BR><BR>System and Method for Performing an Object Non-Equivalence Comparison
<BR><BR>[0041] FIG. 3 is a block diagram of a system for determining if two
     operands point to different locations in memory in accordance with one
     embodiment of the invention. In FIG. 3 computer 306 represents a computer
     such as but not limited to a user or development computer on which BASIC
     applications, BASIC-like applications and BASIC-derivative applications
     (including but not limited to MICROSOFT VISUAL BASIC, REAL BASIC and the
     like) may be developed and run. It will be understood that computer 306
     may also represent one or more computers. For example, an application may
     be developed and/or tested on one computer and then installed and run on
     one or more other computers. The application may be created from source
     code 320 using a design environment (DE) 308 and may be run in execution
     environment 310. A design environment may include one or more compilers,
     here represented by compiler 300, one or more design tools (not shown),
     an editor (not shown) and the like. One such design environment may be
     MICROSOFT VISUAL BASIC .NET, BORLAND DELPHI or the like. A design
     environment 308 may generate from source code 320 executable code capable
     of being run in an execution environment or may generate an intermediate
     form of code 302 that is interpreted or compiled again and run by an
     execution environment such as execution environment 310. An execution
     environment may include elements required in order to run the compilation
     produced by the design environment from the source code 320. The
     execution environment may include elements that produce native code 306
     from a non-device-specific intermediate language code 302. The
     development and execution environments may in addition include various
     class libraries (not shown). Execution environment 310 may, for example,
     represent MICROSOFT COMMON LANGUAGE RUNTIME .NET or JAVA SDK or SWING,
     for example. The application executable may be loaded, along with shared
     class libraries and execution environment 310, onto one or more computers
     (not shown) and run.
<BR><BR>[0042] Referring now to FIG. 3b, compiler 300 may represent a BASIC
     compiler or interpreter or a compiler or interpreter for a BASIC-like or
     BASIC-derivative language such as but not limited to MICROSOFT VISUAL
     BASIC, BORLAND DELPHI or REAL BASIC supporting an operator that evaluates
     to true if two operands associated with the operator point to different
     locations in memory and may include the following components: a scanner
     350, a parser 352, an analyzer 354 and an executable-generator 356.
<BR><BR>[0043] The scanner 350 may scan the text of the source code, breaking the
     statements in the source code into keywords, literal values, whitespace,
     punctuation, new line indicators and comments. If the keyword
     representing the single operator that evaluates to true if two operands
     associated with the operator point to different locations in memory is
     found, the keyword is recognized. If the keyword is not correctly
     represented, an error message may be generated.
<BR><BR>[0044] The parser 352 may parse the scanned text of the source code. If
     the keyword representing the single operator that evaluates to true if
     two operands associated with the operator point to different locations in
     memory is found, the parser may recognize that the keyword must be
     preceded and followed by an operand. If the keyword is not preceded by
     and followed by an operand, an error message may be generated. If the
     operands do not evaluate to reference types, an error message may be
     generated.
<BR><BR>[0045] The analyzer 354 may evaluate or understand the parsed statement.
     For example, a statement including the keyword that evaluates to true if
     two operands associated with the operator point to different locations in
     memory may be evaluated to determine if the statement makes sense within
     the programming language. The analyzer 354 may recognize that the
     operator that evaluates to true if two operands associated with the
     operator point to different locations in memory requires operands that
     are capable of being pointers to a class in the heap. For example, if the
     keyword for the operator is "IsNot" and the statement "If b IsNot 5" is
     evaluated, an error message may be generated because "5" is an integer,
     and so is not capable of being a pointer to a location in memory.
<BR><BR>[0046] The generator 356 may generate executable code from the analyzed
     statement, the executable code upon execution, being capable of
     determining whether two operands are pointing to the same location in
     memory.
<BR><BR>[0047] FIG. 4 is a flow diagram of an exemplary method 400 for determining
     whether two operands associated with an operator are pointing to
     difference locations in memory in accordance with one embodiment of the
     invention.
<BR><BR>[0048] At step 402 the text of the source code is received and scanned.
     The statements in the source code are broken apart into keywords,
     literals, whitespace, punctuation, new line indicators and comments. If
     the keyword representing the single operator that evaluates to true if
     two operands associated with the operator point to different locations in
     memory is found, the keyword is recognized. If, for example, the VB
     statement:
<BR><BR>[0049] If b IsNot Nothing
<BR><BR>[0050] is scanned, "If", "b" "IsNot" and "Nothing" are recognized as
     words. Keywords such as "If" (the beginning of an if-then statement) and
     "Nothing" (representing a value to which a pointer is set when the
     pointer is not pointing to anything in memory) are recognized. "b" is
     recognized as a variable name and "IsNot" is recognized as an operator.
     If punctuation were present, the punctuation would be recognized as such.
     It will be recognized that although in the example, the operator is
     designated as "IsNot", the invention is not so limited. Any suitable case
     sensitive or case insensitive tag for the operator is contemplated by the
     invention, such as but not limited to "Is_Not", "isnot", "Isnot",
     "Is_Not", "is_not" and so on.
<BR><BR>[0051] At step 404 the statement is parsed. If the keyword representing
     the single operator that evaluates to true if two operands associated
     with the operator point to different locations in memory is found, it is
     recognized that the keyword must be preceded and followed by an operand.
     For example, when the statement:
<BR><BR>[0052] "If b IsNot Nothing" is parsed, it is recognized that the keyword
     "If" should be followed by an expression. In the exemplary statement "If
     b IsNot Nothing", keyword "If" is followed by expression "b IsNot
     Nothing" and an indicator is set to look for an "end if" statement. Had
     this not been the case, an error message may have been generated. When
     the operator "IsNot" is parsed, the parser checks that the "IsNot"
     operator is preceded and followed by an expression or variable that
     represents a class. The operand in one embodiment of the invention, may
     be something that results in a pointer to the heap, therefore, or
     something that evaluates thereto. In this case, "b" and "Nothing" are
     valid expressions.
<BR><BR>[0053] At step 406, the statement is evaluated or understood. For example,
     the statement "If b IsNot Nothing" is evaluated to determine if the
     statement makes sense within the programming language. In the example,
     the meaning of the statement is understood as "If the variable b does not
     point to a location in memory". "IsNot" is recognized as an operator that
     requires two expressions capable of being pointers to a class in the
     heap. For example, if the statement "If b IsNot 5" is evaluated, an error
     message may be generated because "5" is an integer, not a pointer.
<BR><BR>[0054] At step 408, executable is generated. In one embodiment of the
     invention, the executable generated is a machine-independent intermediate
     code, such as MICROSOFT Intermediate Language or Common Intermediate
     Language, although native (machine dependent) language or byte code may
     alternatively or additionally be generated.
<BR><BR>[0055] The various techniques described herein may be implemented in
     connection with hardware or software or, where appropriate, with a
     combination of both. Thus, the methods and apparatus of the present
     invention, or certain aspects or portions thereof, may take the form of
     program code (i.e., instructions) embodied in tangible media, such as
     floppy diskettes, CD-ROMs, hard drives, or any other machine-readable
     storage medium, wherein, when the program code is loaded into and
     executed by a machine, such as a computer, the machine becomes an
     apparatus for practicing the invention. In the case of program code
     execution on programmable computers, the computing device will generally
     include a processor, a storage medium readable by the processor
     (including volatile and non-volatile memory and/or storage elements), at
     least one input device, and at least one output device. One or more
     programs that may utilize the creation and/or implementation of
     domain-specific programming models aspects of the present invention,
     e.g., through the use of a data processing API or the like, are
     preferably implemented in a high level procedural or object oriented
     programming language to communicate with a computer system. However, the
     program(s) can be implemented in assembly or machine language, if
     desired. In any case, the language may be a compiled or interpreted
     language, and combined with hardware implementations.
<BR><BR>[0056] While the present invention has been described in connection with
     the preferred embodiments of the various figures, it is to be understood
     that other similar embodiments may be used or modifications and additions
     may be made to the described embodiments for performing the same function
     of the present invention without deviating therefrom. Therefore, the
     present invention should not be limited to any single embodiment, but
     rather should be construed in breadth and scope in accordance with the
     appended claims.
