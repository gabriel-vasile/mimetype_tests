<meta name="description" content="&quot;I am not a crook&quot; (Herblock's History, Library of Congress). From the stock market crash in 1929 through the new millennium in 2000, editorial cartoonist Herbert Block has chronicled the nation's political history, depicting the eras of American presidents from Herbert Hoover to Bill Clinton. He has received three Pulitzer Prizes for editorial cartooning and a fourth with Washington Post colleagues for public service during the Watergate investigation.">

        the night of June 17, 1972, former employees of the Nixon reelection campaign 
        broke into the Democratic headquarters in the Watergate building. This 
        incident began the unraveling of the Nixon Administration's abuses of 
        power and illegal actions and the administration's efforts to cover up 
        these activities. Two days after the break-in, Herb Block drew cartoons 
        of Nixon and his attorney general feigning surprise, and saying, &quot;Who 
        would think of doing such a thing?&quot; This was followed by one of Nixon 
        and Department of Justice officials saying, &quot;Remember, we don't talk 
        until we get a lawyer.&quot; He also did a cartoon showing scandal footsteps 
        leading to the White House. Says Herb Block: <i>&quot;Watergate was not 
        even the first by the Nixon &#145;plumbers.' They had previously broken 
        into the office of Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist. And in the Nixon tapes, 
        he [Nixon] tells aides how to break into such places as the IRS offices.</i>&quot; 
        In 1974, Herb Block produced <cite>Herblock Special Report</cite>, a book 
        of cartoons and text devoted to Nixon's political activities from the 
        1940s to his resignation in 1974.</p>

            <p>On June 13, 1971, the <cite>New York Times</cite> began publishing 
              installments of the "Pentagon Papers," documents about American 
              involvement in Indochina from the end of World War II to the mid 
              1960s. The Nixon administration moved to block further publication 
              of the papers, and Attorney General John Mitchell obtained a temporary 
              injunction against The <cite>New York Times</cite>. The <cite>Washington 
              Post</cite> then released two installments before being similarly 
              enjoined. Other papers picked up the series, until June 30, when 
              the Supreme Court rejected the government's request for a permanent 
              injunction. The "New Figure" cartoon was one of many depicting President 
              Richard Nixon's attempts to curb public information, partly through 
              government control of broadcast stations owned by newspapers.</p>

            <h2> For the championship of the United States</h2>
            <p>Campaign finance spending soared in the 1960s. The cost of the 
              1968 presidential campaign was $300 million — almost double that 
              of 1964. With Republican coffers in 1971 comfortably filled while 
              the Democrats were some $9 million in debt, the Democratic-controlled 
              Congress considered proposals to provide public financing. But President 
              Richard Nixon threatened a veto. Eventually, they compromised on 
              some public financing of presidential elections starting in 1976. 
              Since then, loopholes in the laws have permitted almost unlimited 
              political spending far in excess of the government's contributions 
              and of all previous campaigns. In the year 2000 campaign, more than 
              $300 million had already been spent on political ads alone before 
              the end of September.</p>

              scandals. These concerned reports of improper influence by ITT Corp. 
              on the location of the future Republican National Convention; Nixon's 
              fluctuating decisions on milk price supports that amounted to a 
              shakedown for campaign funds; and pressures on other businesses 
              to meet quota "suggestions" on contributions. There were disclosures 
              of taxpayer money spent to fix up Nixon's homes in Key Biscayne 
              and San Clemente. Nixon also took large backdated tax deductions 
              for the gift of his vice-presidential papers, which even included 
              newspaper clippings.</p>

            <p>On November 17, 1973, President Richard Nixon told 400 Associated 
              Press managing editors that he had not profited from public service. 
              "I have earned every cent. And in all of my years in public life

              $432,787.13 in back taxes plus interest after an investigation by 
              the Internal Revenue Service and a congressional committee. Among 
              Nixon's benefits to himself were improvements in his properties,

            <p>By July 14, 1974, President Richard Nixon stood almost alone. His 
              vice-president Spiro Agnew, pleaded <i>nolo contendere</i> to a 
              charge of tax evasion, and was forced to resign. Many of Nixon's 
              closest aides had been convicted of illegal activities. Nixon himself 
              was named an "un-indicted co-conspirator" by the Watergate grand 
              jury. A few days later, the House Judiciary Committee recommended 
              impeachment, and the Supreme Court required him to turn over all 
              subpoenaed tapes. When even his closest friends, reviewing these 
              tapes, agreed that the evidence against him was overwhelming, Nixon 
              bowed to the inevitable, resigning on August 9.</p>
