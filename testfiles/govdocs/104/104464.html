  Summary</a></STRONG></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Ten expert panelists reviewed and 
  discussed the state of the science on soil-pica behavior--an issue that is relevant 
  to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry's (ATSDR) ongoing work 
  at sites with human exposures to contaminated soils. During a 2-day workshop 
  in June 2000, in Atlanta, Georgia, the panelists thoroughly discussed and debated 
  the prevalence of soil-pica behavior, ingestion rates for soil-pica, means for 
  identifying people with soil-pica behavior, and additional topics. Common themes 
  discussed throughout the workshop included the need for clear definitions of 
  key terms, the lack of extensive research on the distribution of soil ingestion 
  rates, and the need for additional research to fill data gaps.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After the workshop, the panelists 
  drafted definitions of three key terms and prepared eight summary statements 
  highlighting their most important findings, listed below. An overview of the 
  panelists' discussion that led to these findings and recommendations for evaluating 
  soil-pica behavior is documented throughout this report. The panelists used 
  the following definitions to frame their discussions: </SPAN></P>
<UL>
  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times NewRoman"><EM></EM></SPAN> 
  <p> 
  <LI><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><strong><EM>Soil ingestion</em></strong> 
    is the consumption of soil. This may result from various behaviors including, 
    but not limited to, mouthing, contacting dirty hands, eating dropped food, 
    or consuming soil directly. </SPAN></LI>
  <p> 
  <LI><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM><strong>Soil-pica</strong></EM> is 
    the recurrent ingestion of unusually high amounts of soil (i.e., on the order 
    of 1,000-5,000 milligrams per day). Groups at risk of soil-pica behavior include 
    children aged 6 years and younger and individuals who are developmentally 
    delayed. <EM></EM></SPAN></LI>
  <p> 
  <LI><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM><strong>Geophagy</strong></EM> is the 
    intentional ingestion of earths and is usually associated with cultural practices.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></LI>
</UL>
<p>The panelists identified strengths and weaknesses associated with the different 
  methods (e.g., observational, questionnaire, and analytical) that have been 
  used to evaluate the prevalence of soil-pica. Given the limitations of individual 
  methods, they agreed that a study that incorporates multiple methods would provide 
  a means for validating the prevalence of soil-pica and the distribution of soil 
  ingestion rates. Such validation is needed to provide confidence in ATSDR's 
  approach for conducting future public health assessments.</p>
<p>Even with a definition of soil-pica, the panelists found it difficult to determine 
  the prevalence of this behavior. The panelists agreed that soil-pica clearly 
  exists, but the prevalence at a given soil ingestion rate has not been adequately 
  characterized. Nonetheless, noting that soil ingestion is normal behavior among 
  children, the panelists unanimously agreed that ATSDR should continue to evaluate 
  the public health implications of all types of soil ingestion, including soil-pica.</p>
<p>The panelists agreed that the existing soil ingestion studies--nearly all of 
  which evaluated children's behavior for durations of 2 weeks or shorter--are 
  inadequate for determining the frequency of, and seasonal variations in, soil-pica.</p>
<p>The panelists noted that geophagy typically involves consumption of clay materials 
  from known (and usually uncontaminated) sources at depth, rather than consumption 
  of surface soils from residential properties. To address this type of ingestion, 
  the panelists suggested that ATSDR survey communities of concern to determine 
  if geophagy is practiced and where geophagical materials are obtained.</p>
<p> The panelists thought that soil-pica among adults was probably rare. Given 
  anecdotal accounts of soil-pica adults, the panelists suggested that ATSDR consider 
  the possibility that this behavior occurs, perhaps by conducting surveys or 
  availability sessions with communities. However, it is sometimes unclear from 
  anecdotal accounts whether the behavior reported was soil-pica or geophagy. 
  because the literature on soil ingestion rates is extremely sparse, the panelists 
  agreed that the distribution of age-specific soil ingestion rates had not been 
  well characterized. Some panelists noted that ATSDR can estimate percentiles 
  in this distribution by using a statistical analysis of existing soil ingestion 
  data. However, the panelists stressed the need for field validation (including 
  study of biomarkers and, where relevant, health effects) of any derived soil 
  ingestion rate, as this ultimately would provide more confidence in ATSDR's 
  public health evaluations of sites with contaminated soils. </p>
<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 
<p>After lengthy discussions, the panelists noted that ATSDR's assumption that 
  soil-pica children ingest 5,000 milligrams (mg) of soil per day appears to be 
  supported by only a few subjects in soil ingestion studies (i.e., two children 
  in Massachusetts and several children in Jamaica). Referring to the soil ingestion 
  rates presented in the literature, as summarized in EPA's <EM>Exposure Factors 
  Handbook</EM>, some panelists thought that ATSDR's assumed ingestion rate for 
  soil-pica children was high. Other panelists agreed, however, that ATSDR should 
  err on the side of being protective and should use 5,000 mg until more data 
  are collected. They also stressed the need for validating the 5,000 mg soil 
  ingestion rate.

  <a name="1. Introduction">1. Introduction</a></STRONG></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Agency for Toxic Substances 
  and Disease Registry (ATSDR) invited 10 expert panelists to a workshop, which 
  focused on the current state of science on soil-pica behavior--an issue that 
  is relevant to the agency's ongoing work at many sites where people may be exposed 
  to contaminated soils. The 2-day workshop occurred in Atlanta, Georgia, on June 
  7-8, 2000, and focused on addressing three key issues: the prevalence of soil-pica 
  behavior, soil ingestion rates for people who exhibit this behavior, and means 
  for identifying people with this behavior.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">This report summarizes the technical 
  discussions among the expert panelists. The remainder of this introductory section 
  describes the following topics in greater detail: ATSDR's concern about soil-pica 
  behavior (Section 1.1), how the agency selected the expert panelists (Section 
  1.2) and briefed them (Section 1.3), the workshop charge and agenda (Section 
  1.4), and the organization of this report (Section 1.5).</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><a name="1.1 Background">1.1 
  Background</a></STRONG></span></P>
<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under congressional mandate, ATSDR 
  is required to conduct public health assessments for certain contaminated waste 
  sites. At these sites, the agency may conduct a wide range of activities. One 
  important activity is to evaluate the extent to which people may come into contact 
  with hazardous substances in soil, groundwater, surface water, air, and food. 
  To characterize potential exposures to soil contaminants, ATSDR considers several 
  factors, such as the nature and extent of contamination, whether people have 
  access to contaminated areas, and the amounts of soils they ingest.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With the growing number of sites 
  where levels of soil contamination may be of public health concern, particularly 
  among children who exhibit soil-pica behavior, ATSDR decided to convene a panel 
  with expertise on the scientific, cultural, behavioral, and medical factors 
  related to soil-pica behavior. The panelists' findings will be used to focus 
  on how ATSDR evaluates the public health implications of exposure to soil contaminants.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG> <a name="1.2 The Workshop Attendees">1.2 
  The Workshop Attendees</a></STRONG></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">There were 10 panelists, including 
  behavioral psychologists, scientists, pediatricians, and epidemiologists, who 
  are experts in evaluating soil ingestion among children and adults. They included 
  representatives from federal agencies, childrens' hospitals, and academia, and 
  their collective expertise spans virtually every subject matter discussed at 
  the workshop. Therefore, the expert panel offered a broad and balanced perspective 
  on soil-pica behavior and its implications on the agency's health assessment 
  process. Appendix A lists the names and affiliations of these panelists.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition to the panelists, about 
  20 observers attended one or both days of the 2-day workshop. The observers 
  included community members, industry, consultants, ATSDR staff, and representatives 
  from state and local health departments. Though the discussions at the workshop 
  were primarily among the panelists, ATSDR gave observers the opportunity to 
  comment on all key issues. Observers' comments are included in this report, 
  usually at the end of the sections.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG> <a name="1.3 Briefing the Panelists">1.3 
  Briefing the Panelists</a></STRONG></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">To focus the workshop discussions, 
  ATSDR prepared a list of questions, commonly called a "charge," and asked the 
  panelists to address charge questions (Appendix B has a list of the charge). 
  The charge for this workshop addresses the three key topics identified earlier: 
  the prevalence of soil-pica behavior, soil ingestion rates among people who 
  exhibit this behavior, and methods for identifying people who have this behavior. 
  Under each issue, the charge presents several questions that ATSDR asked the 
  panelists to discuss. Additionally, the charge included an open-ended topic, 
  under which the panelists were asked to discuss research needs, bioavailability 
  of metals in soils, and any other issue they thought the other charge questions 
  did not address.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ATSDR also provided every panelist 
  a packet of 12 publications on topics related to soil-pica behavior one month 
  prior to the workshop (Section 7 lists these publications). </SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG> <a name="1.4 The Workshop and Overview Presentations">1.4 
  The Workshop and Overview Presentations</a></STRONG></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The 2-day workshop generally followed 
  the agenda shown in Appendix C. Dr. Catherine McKinney (Centers for Disease 
  Control and Prevention) facilitated the workshop, which opened with introductions, 
  both by panelists and observers, and was followed by four overview presentations 
  (summarized below). For the remainder of the workshop, some panelists gave presentations 
  and all panelists provided recommendations, observations, and comments when 
  answering the questions. The workshop was a free-flowing discussion among the 
  panelists, and did not focus on trying to reach a consensus on any issue. A 
  record of the panelists' discussions is presented in Sections 2 through 6, with 
  key findings highlighted in the Executive Summary.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Following is a summary of the four 
  overview presentations, which were delivered before the panelists addressed 
  the charge questions:</SPAN><BR WP="BR2">
</P>
<UL>
  <LI><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>Dr. Henry Falk, M.D., Assistant 
    Administrator, ATSDR.</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 
    Dr. Falk gave an overview of ATSDR, explaining how the agency works with the 
    Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), other federal agencies, state and local 
    health departments, and communities to address public health issues related 
    to environmental contamination. He also gave an overview of how soil-pica 
    behavior factors into ATSDR's public health assessments and EPA's decision 
    making process for Superfund. </SPAN></LI>
  &nbsp; 
</UL>
<P> Noting that the complex issue of exposures to contaminated soil arises at 
  many hazardous waste sites, Dr. Falk stressed that the panelists' inputs might 
  weigh heavily in ATSDR's future evaluations of the public health implications 
  of soil-pica behavior. Dr. Falk concluded his presentation by acknowledging 
  that soil-pica is particularly important for evaluating health risks to children--a 
  topic that his colleague, Dr. Rob Amler, would discuss in greater detail, as 
  described below.</P>
<UL>
  <LI><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">•<EM>Dr. Rob Amler, M.D., Chief 
    Medical Officer, ATSDR.</EM> Dr. Amler's presentation reviewed various ongoing 
    activities that support ATSDR's Child Health Initiative, which addresses special 
    vulnerabilities of children who live near hazardous waste sites. He first 
    listed many reasons why children tend to have higher exposures to environmental 
    contaminants: children often find openings in fences around restricted sites, 
    they play vigorously in soil and water, and they breathe, drink, and eat more--on 
    a body weight basis--than do adults. </SPAN></LI>
</UL>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Dr. Amler noted that these reasons, 
  coupled with the fact that children's exposures can occur during critical developmental 
  stages and that persistent health effects might result from these exposures, 
  have caused ATSDR and other agencies to focus research and outreach on children's 
  health issues. Acknowledging that quantifying children's exposures can often 
  be difficult, particularly for soil ingestion pathways, Dr. Amler stressed that 
  the panelists' inputs on soil-pica behavior will be an important consideration 
  for future site evaluations.</SPAN></P>
<UL>
  <LI><EM>Dr. David Mellard, Ph.D., Toxicologist, ATSDR.</EM> Dr. Mellard's presentation 
    focused on the primary goal of the workshop--how ATSDR should evaluate exposures 
    to children who exhibit soil-pica behavior. Dr. Mellard explained that ATSDR 
    views "pica" as the intentional ingestion of large quantities of soil, which 
    primarily occurs among preschool children. He then reviewed an approach typically 
    used to evaluate residential exposure pathways for pica children, with key 
    factors being the assumed soil ingestion rate and the duration over which 
    this ingestion occurs.</LI>
</UL>
<P> Dr. Mellard noted that soil ingestion rates of 5,000 mg/day have been documented 
  in a few studies in the scientific literature, but the duration over which ingestion 
  at this level occurs has not been studied. Dr. Mellard found it reasonable to 
  assume that some children might have these very high daily ingestion rates at 
  least once in their preschool lives, and he thought it was possible that soil-pica 
  children might exhibit these very high daily ingestion rates several times a 
  week, for several weeks in a row. However, given that such assumptions can lead 
  to important remediation decisions, Dr. Mellard said that ATSDR seeks expert 
  input on both the prevalence of soil-pica behavior and the ingestion rates among 
  those who exhibit pica behavior. To highlight the importance of these issues, 
  Dr. Mellard concluded his presentation by describing a site with extensive arsenic 
  contamination in residential soils, where exposures among soil-pica children 
  could be at levels known to be associated with adverse health effects.</P>
<UL>
  <LI><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>Mr. Michael Maes and Mr. 
    Anthony Thomas, Community Members.</EM> Mr. Maes is a resident in a neighborhood 
    that was recently designated a Superfund site because of extensive arsenic 
    contamination in soils--a designation that has caused heightened awareness 
    in his community about soil ingestion and pica behavior. Mr. Maes listed several 
    examples of behaviors among his community members that might be of concern, 
    such as children ingesting soils and sediments while playing near large puddles, 
    a teenager who said that she craves to eat dirt several times a year, and 
    women of Mexican descent who consume dirt when they become pregnant. </SPAN></LI>
</UL>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Given these anecdotal accounts 
  of soil ingestion, Mr. Maes believed that soil-pica behavior was an important 
  issue for his community, and he looked forward to the panelists' insights on 
  the prevalence and significance of this behavior. Mr. Anthony Thomas echoed 
  many of these concerns, and wondered about the adverse health effects in individuals 
  who exhibit soil-pica behavior.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">During the meeting, the panelists 
  commented on a wide range of issues pertaining to soil-pica behavior. A common 
  theme was the need to communicate, using consistent terminology. Section 2 of 
  this report presents the panelists' definitions of key terms used throughout 
  the workshop. Sections 3 through 6 summarizes the panelists' comments on the 
  four key topics outlined in the charge (e.g., Section 3 documents the discussion 
  on topic #1, Section 4 documents the discussion on topic #2, and so on). Section 
  7 lists all references cited in the text.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Central to every charge question 
  was the need to define key terms, such as soil ingestion, soil-pica, and geophagy, 
  and to avoid any ambiguities in the discussions. The panelists noted that their 
  definitions might differ from ATSDR's definitions and from definitions published 
  elsewhere. The panelists cautioned, therefore, that observers and readers should 
  be aware of the definitions for soil-pica and geophagy used in this report and 
  that other individuals or agencies might have different definitions. The panelists 
  considered several factors for their definitions, as described below, but they 
  eventually agreed on the following definitions:</SPAN></P>
<UL>

<P>When defining these terms, the panelists listed numerous factors related to 
  the above terms. Several panelists decided, however, that the aspects of soil 
  ingestion that seem to be most important to ATSDR are (1) the amount of soil 
  ingested, (2) the frequency of ingestion, and (3) the type of material ingested. 
  The panelists' inputs on these and other factors are:</P>
<UL>
  <LI><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>Is soil-pica an intentional 
    behavior?</EM> One panelist noted that "pica" is often defined as being intentional 
    ingestion of non-food items. Though not disagreeing, other panelists pointed 
    out that the definition of soil-pica should not be limited to intentional 
    soil ingestion, primarily because children can consume large amounts of soil 
    from their typical behaviors and because differentiating intentional and unintentional 
    behavior in young children is difficult. The panelists eventually agreed, 
    and omitted the "intentional" aspect of soil-pica from their definition, suspecting 
    that ATSDR ultimately is most interested in the quantities of soil that children 
    ingest, regardless of whether the behavior is intentional or not.</SPAN></LI>
  <LI><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>Is soil-pica or geophagy 
    an abnormal behavior?</EM> Some panelists thought that soil-pica is often 
    considered abnormal behavior, but the panelists eventually unanimously agreed 
    to omit the word "abnormal" from their definitions because of the word's negative 
    connotations. One panelist was concerned that too many people already believe 
    geophagy to be abnormal, even though the practice occurs world-wide among 
    millions of individuals who are rational and have different education backgrounds. 
    The panelists pointed out that the normal exploratory behavior by a 1- or 
    2-year-old could involve eating soil while the same behavior in a 4- or 5-year-old 
    might be considered abnormal. Therefore, the panelists chose not to categorize 
    soil-pica as abnormal behavior.</SPAN></LI>
  <BR WP="BR1">
  <BR WP="BR2">
  <LI><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>Is soil-pica necessarily 
    a recurrent behavior?</EM> Some panelists indicated that definitions of soil-pica 
    often imply that the behavior is recurrent, and possibly habitual.<A HREF="#N_1_"><SUP> 
    (1)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> After discussing 
    this issue at length, the panelists agreed that the recurrent ingestion of 
    unusually high amounts of soil is an important aspect of soil-pica. They also 
    agreed that children who ingest large quantities of soils only once should 
    not be considered soil-pica children, though they recommended that ATSDR continue 
    to evaluate the health implications of 1-day exposures.</SPAN></LI>
  <BR WP="BR1">
  <BR WP="BR2">
</UL>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Some observers questioned the panelists' 
  inclusion of "recurrent" in the definition of soil-pica. One observer, for instance, 
  thought the definition should not exclude children who might ingest large quantities 
  of soils on just one occasion. Other observers thought the "recurrent" aspect 
  of soil-pica actually reflected habitual behavior or a "behavioral inclination" 
  to consume soils. The panelists considered these comments, but decided that 
  children who consume large amounts of soil just one time should not be considered 
  soil-pica children. Further, they thought the quantity of soil ingested is the 
  factor that most distinguishes soil-pica behavior, regardless of whether the 
  behavior is habitual, intentional, or inadvertent. Therefore, the panelists 
  did not incorporate the observers' comments into their definition. When asked 
  for a more specific definition of "recurrent," two panelists thought ATSDR should 
  examine the results of soil ingestion surveys in the literature to develop more 
  precise wording for the temporal component of the soil-pica definition.</SPAN></P>
<UL>
  <LI><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>What is the significance 
    of the materials that people consume?</EM> When defining geophagy, two panelists 
    stressed that it typically involves consumption of clays from known, and usually 
    uncontaminated sources. The fact that surface soils generally are not the 
    main source of geophagical materials was often highlighted during the workshop. 
    Soil-pica, however, is strictly consumption of surface soils (i.e., usually 
    the top 2-3 inches).</SPAN></LI>
  <BR WP="BR1">
  <BR WP="BR2">
  <LI><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>Is age a risk factor for 
    soil-pica?</EM> When defining soil-pica, the panelists suggested different 
    age ranges for being at greatest risk of exhibiting this behavior. Two panelists 
    noted survey data which indicate that soil ingestion is generally not of concern 
    for infants (aged 0-12 months). Other panelists recommended saying that children 
    4&nbsp;years old and under are at risk for soil-pica. Another panelist noted 
    that EPA's children's health initiatives focus on children aged 6 years and 
    younger as being at risk for elevated soil ingestion levels. Another panelist 
    cited analytical studies reporting elevated soil ingestion rates among children 
    up to 7 years old. The panelists decided that "children aged 6 years and younger" 
    should be included in the definition as being at high risk for soil-pica.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></LI>
  <BR WP="BR1">
  <BR WP="BR2">
</UL>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> After the panelists defined soil-pica, 
  an observer asked if the age group listed in the definition (6 years and younger) 
  was simply chosen to be consistent with EPA's efforts. Suspecting that older 
  children (i.e., 5- and 6-year-olds) have lower soil ingestion rates than younger 
  ones (i.e., aged 4 and younger), this observer wondered if the age range specified 
  in the definition was too broad. Two panelists justified their decision to include 
  5- and 6-year-olds in this definition. One panelist stressed that children's 
  behaviors that contribute to soil ingestion differ considerably between 1-year-olds 
  and 6-year-olds. However, she noted, behaviors associated with soil ingestion, 
  particularly thumb sucking, tend to decrease markedly after age 6, due to pressures 
  from peers and teachers. Thus, she thought that including children aged 6 years 
  and younger in the definition of soil-pica was appropriate, recognizing that 
  soil ingestion behaviors of children within this age range can vary widely. 
  Another panelist noted that 5- and 6-year-olds may be less likely to engage 
  in mouthing behavior than younger children, but that they are more likely to 
  play outdoors frequently, which might increase their risk for ingesting soils. 
  Therefore, he found it appropriate to indicate that children aged 6 years and 
  younger are at risk for soil-pica.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Eventually, two panelists noted 
  that specifying an exact age range for children at risk for exhibiting pica 
  behavior is somewhat arbitrary and no data adequately support the use of one 
  age range as a cutoff over another. The reviewers summarized the main point 
  of the discussion as follows: the risk of engaging in soil-pica behavior is 
  clearly greatest in young children, as opposed to in infants, older children, 
  adolescents, or adults.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When addressing the topic of prevalence 
  of soil-pica behavior, two panelists briefly presented their research and all 
  of the panelists answered the five charge questions pertaining to this topic. 
  This section reviews both the presentations and the panelists' responses; key 
  findings from this discussion are found in the Executive Summary. </SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Note: In this and other sections,

  Incidental Influences on Total Soil Dust Ingestion: Dr. Natalie Freeman</a></STRONG></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Dr. Freeman's presentation focused 
  on incidental ingestion of soil and dust that results from children's typical 
  eating and mouthing behaviors. Though her most recent studies have primarily 
  examined exposures to household dust, Dr. Freeman noted that 50-70% of household 
  dust is believed to come from outdoor soils. Thus, she reports her results as 
  ingestion of "soil/dust," rather than ingestion of strictly household dust.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Dr. Freeman explained that examining 
  incidental soil ingestion among children is important, because national studies 
  have suggested that 87% of children (aged 1-4 years) lie or play on the floor 
  and nearly 50% play on grass or dirt. (Dr. Freeman acknowledged that these summary 
  statistics reflect national trends and may not be representative of regional 
  or local trends.) She added that her own research of children in Newark, New 
  Jersey, has shown that a large proportion of children (aged 1-3 years) regularly 
  engage in activities that can lead to soil ingestion, such as eating most of 
  their food with their hands, eating food dropped on the floor, and putting their 
  fingers in their mouths.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Dr. Freeman then outlined preliminary 
  data she has collected in support of an ongoing "Children's Dietary Lead Study." 
  She specifically addressed the extent to which children's food can be contaminated 
  by their behavior patterns. This study characterized children's exposures to 
  soil and dust in New Jersey urban centers by sampling levels of metals contamination 
  on kitchen floors, children's hands, food that fell on the floor, and food that 
  children handled. Dr. Freeman explained the approach used to attribute measured 
  levels of metals in food to contributions from metals contamination in soils 
  and household dust, and then presented preliminary results from her study. One 
  preliminary result is that, on average (median), 2 mg of dust adheres to a slice 
  of apple dropped on the floor, the maximum being 16 mg. Similarly, 8 mg of dust, 
  on average (median), adheres to a slice of cheese dropped on the floor, the 
  maximum amount being 59 mg. Based on her results for apples, cheese, bananas, 
  and hot dogs, Dr. Freeman estimated that children, on average, may ingest 22 
  mg of household dust daily just from eating foods from the floor, with a 90<SUP>th</SUP> 
  percentile ingestion rate from this activity of 93 mg.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Dr. Freeman also presented preliminary 
  estimates of soil ingestion rates resulting from children's typical mouthing 
  behavior. These estimates were calculated from measurements of the amounts of 
  dusts typically found on children's hands and the assumptions on hand-to-mouth 
  rates, the percentage of the hand that enters a child's mouth, the extent to 
  which the amount of dust on the hand might be replenished between mouthing events, 
  and the number of hours a day in which children engage in mouthing behavior. 
  Not surprisingly, the results varied with the assumptions made in the calculations. 
  For instance, children with a median dust loading on their hands (i.e., 1.5 
  mg dust per hand) who have a hand-to-mouth rate of 8.5 events per hour were 
  estimated to have an incidental dust ingestion rate--from mouthing behavior 
  alone--of 14 mg per day. At the upper end of the soil ingestion range, children 
  with the maximum dust loading on their hands (i.e., 58.2 mg dust per hand) who 
  have a hand-to-mouth rate of 27.0 events per hour are estimated to have an ingestion 
  rate of 1,800 mg per day. Dr. Freeman noted that this elevated ingestion rate 
  was not actually observed, but was estimated using a statistical analysis of 
  her data. Dr. Freeman emphasized two assumptions that introduce uncertainty 
  into these calculations. First, the dust loading on hands was assumed to fully 
  replenish between mouthing events--an assumption that an observer suggested 
  was conservative for the upper-end exposure scenario--and mouthing activity 
  was assumed to be limited to 8 hours per day. Dr. Freeman explained that little 
  data are available for soil/dust replenishment on hands, for mouthing activities 
  during 24-hour time periods, and for the consistency of these behaviors across 
  days or weeks. She noted that most observational studies are limited to 8 hours 
  or less per child.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In conclusion, Dr. Freeman stressed 
  that considerable amounts of soil and dust ingestion can occur on a daily basis 
  as a result of children's typical behavior patterns, and not necessarily from 
  what have traditionally been considered intentional soil-pica events.</SPAN></P>

  Geophagical Clays-Extraction, Preparation, and Distribution: Dr. Don Vermeer</a></STRONG></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Dr. Vermeer addressed deliberate 
  consumption of clays or earths, called geophagy (as defined in Section 2.0). 
  He explained that geophagy has been observed on all continents, but that it 
  is particularly prevalent among certain cultural groups. He noted that geophagy 
  involves much higher ingestion rates than the incidental ingestion data presented 
  by Dr. Freeman, but he stressed that the clays consumed are typically from known, 
  and usually uncontaminated sources, as described below.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Noting that the geophagical practices 
  in Africa are an antecedent to those practices in African-Americans, Dr. Vermeer 
  first described the African tradition of consuming processed clays. He showed 
  photographs of a typical source of geophagical clays, which were located about 
  2-3 feet below the surface. Dr. Vermeer stressed that surface soils are rarely 
  consumed, and thus contamination confined to surface soils is likely not an 
  issue for culturally-associated geophagical consumption of clays. He then explained 
  how the extracted clays are stored and processed into their final shapes, and 
  he noted how the processing practices can vary from village to village. Dr. 
  Vermeer said that some clays were prepared with various herbs and leaves for 
  medical purposes. </SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Production of the geophagical clays, 
  according to Dr. Vermeer, is estimated to be as high as 500 tons per year in 
  African villages he visited. Consumption of these clays appears to be greatest 
  among women, particularly pregnant ones, but was also prevalent among children. 
  Dr. Vermeer noted that typical consumption of these clays among women ranges 
  from 30 to 50 grams per day, but much higher levels of consumption have been 
  observed.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Dr. Vermeer then characterized geophagical 
  practices in the United States, which he said were transferred to the New World 
  largely via the slave trade, though he acknowledged that indigenous Indian groups 
  throughout the New World and European immigrants in the southern Appalachian 
  region consumed geophagical clays. To illustrate the current practice of geophagy 
  in the United States, Dr. Vermeer presented research he conducted on this activity 
  in Holmes County, Mississippi, where clays are primarily extracted from the 
  B horizon, 18 to more than 36 inches below the surface, and rarely from surface 
  deposits. An extraction site typically is associated with one extended family. 
  He added that geophagy has been documented to occur in recent years in various 
  southern communities, including Atlanta, as well as in Hispanic cultures. In 
  conclusion, Dr. Vermeer stressed that the geophagical clays consumed in the 
  United States are primarily from known, and usually uncontaminated sources.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>

  Approaches for Characterizing the Prevalence of Soil-Pica</a></STRONG></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In response to the first charge 
  question--"What observational, questionnaire, and analytical studies are most 
  valid for characterizing the extent of soil-pica behavior?"--the panelists discussed 
  the different methods that have been used to evaluate the prevalence of soil-pica 
  behavior, and identified strengths and weaknesses associated with each method. 
  Given the limitations of individual methods, the panelists eventually agreed 
  that a study that incorporates multiple methods would provide the best means 
  for validating the prevalence of soil-pica behavior and the distribution of 
  soil ingestion rates. The panelists thought that such validation was needed 
  to develop a robust characterization of the prevalence of soil-pica behavior. 
  Following is a summary of the panelists' discussion that led to this conclusion.</SPAN></P>
<UL>
  <LI><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>The utility of questionnaires.</EM> 
    Two panelists noted that surveys on soil ingestion, which researchers typically 
    administer to caretakers, are useful for getting meaningful insights on general 
    issues (e.g., "does your child ever eat dirt?") but are not particularly useful 
    for getting robust answers on specific issues (e.g., "how often does your 
    child eat dirt?" or "how much dirt does your child consume?") (SD, NF). Expanding 
    on this comment, one panelist indicated that parents typically do not observe 
    their children constantly and therefore are not able to comment reliably on 
    specific details of their soil ingestion behaviors (NF).</SPAN></LI>
</UL>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Other panelists listed reasons 
  why administering surveys to parents about their children's behavior might lead 
  to spurious results. First, parents might provide responses they think surveyors 
  want to hear, rather than responses that accurately reflect their children's 
  behavior (NF). Second, parents might provide inaccurate responses in efforts 
  to conceal information that might reflect badly on them as parents (e.g., their 
  children eating large amounts of dirt) (JM, DV). Third, because "unusual" behavior 
  is more easily recognized in families with multiple children, parents' perceptions 
  of "unusual" behavior might vary from one family to the next, thus complicating 
  efforts to characterize the prevalence of soil-pica behavior with surveys (PS).</SPAN></P>
<UL>
  <LI><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>The utility of analytical 
    studies.</EM> When discussing the different methods available to characterize 
    the prevalence of soil-pica, several panelists noted that soil ingestion rates 
    predicted by analytical methods (i.e., mass balance tracer research) have 
    varied considerably from one study to the next (SD, BL, DM). One panelist 
    suspected that these inconsistent findings might result from the difficulty 
    short-term analytical studies have identifying rare events (DM). Another panelist 
    agreed, explaining that the analytical studies he has conducted and reviewed 
    characterize soil ingestion behavior for a small number of people over a very 
    short time frame, typically 2 weeks or less (SD). With this study approach, 
    he thought the analytical studies have a very small chance of identifying 
    soil-pica events.</SPAN></LI>
</UL>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The panelists raised several other 
  concerns about analytical studies. For instance, one panelist was not convinced 
  that analytical studies can provide the most reliable account of soil ingestion, 
  given his experience conducting two studies, both of which found that soil ingestion 
  rates calculated from analytical approaches correlate very poorly with observational 
  accounts of mouthing behavior and soil ingestion (SD). Another panelist added 
  that inconsistent results might stem from the fact that studies are conducted 
  in different regions and among children of various socio-economic status (DM). 
  He was not surprised, for example, that soil ingestion rates observed among 
  children in suburban communities in Massachusetts were different from those 
  conducted on institutionalized children in Jamaica. One panelist did not think 
  the prevalence of soil-pica behavior among the Jamaican children should be viewed 
  as representative of that among children in the United States, given the small 
  size of the study and the living conditions of the children considered (BL). 
  Another panelist noted that mass balance studies assume an understanding of 
  the digestive processes and degree of uptake, transformation, and excretion 
  of tracers in young children (NF). She added that most tracer studies have been 
  conducted on children, who have different gut permeability, metabolism rates, 
  and excretion rates than adults. This reviewer commented that true mass balance 
  studies would collect both feces and urine over a long period of time, because 
  the temporal pattern of excretion in the two media will be different. She indicated 
  that the mass balance studies included in the review materials were based only 
  on fecal sampling over a limited time frame.</SPAN></P>
<UL>
  <LI><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>The utility of combining 
    several methods.</EM> Given their concerns about the various individual methods 
    for characterizing soil ingestion, most panelists advocated the use of multiple 
    methods in one study to derive a robust, validated distribution of soil ingestion 
    rates. Specifically, panelists highlighted the need for conducting an extensive 
    study that integrates information on levels of soil contamination, biomarkers 
    of exposure, and various metrics of soil ingestion (e.g., analytical, observational, 
    and surveyed accounts) (BL, RW). Several panelists noted that such a study 
    would be expensive, but thought the community at the Vasquez Boulevard/Interstate 
    70 Superfund site might be an excellent subject population for such research 
    (NF, BL). Though not disagreeing with these suggestions, one panelist cautioned 
    that using multiple methods to characterize soil ingestion has led to conflicting 
    results in his previous research and that using multiple methods to derive 
    a validated soil ingestion rate for pica children will be quite challenging, 
    though worth pursuing (SD).</SPAN></LI>
</UL>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> When commenting on the use of integrated 
  approaches to characterize soil ingestion rates, two panelists identified existing 
  data sets that ATSDR should review. One panelist indicated that one of his past 
  studies on soil ingestion, which included observational and analytical components, 
  also has biomarker data (i.e., blood lead levels) that have yet to be thoroughly 
  examined (SD). Another panelist noted that biomarker data (i.e., levels of arsenic 
  in urine) are available for a Superfund site in Washington state where ingestion 
  of contaminated soils is of concern (JM).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The second was: "What is the prevalence 
  rate of soil-pica behavior among children, especially preschool children? among 
  adults? among pregnant women?" </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The 
  panelists stressed that the prevalence of pica behavior is highly dependent 
  upon how it is defined, and eventually defined the various terms (e.g., soil 
  ingestion, soil-pica, geophagy) used throughout the workshop. Even with a clear 
  definition of soil-pica, however, the panelists had difficulty quantifying the 
  prevalence among subpopulations, given the lack of extensive soil ingestion 
  studies. Nonetheless, the panelists agreed that soil-pica exists and that ATSDR 
  should continue to evaluate the public health implications of all types of soil 
  ingestion behavior, including soil-pica. Following is a summary of the discussion 
  that led to this conclusion.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>
<UL>
  <LI><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>The importance of clearly 
    defined terminology.</EM> The panelists repeatedly stressed that the prevalence 
    of soil-pica behavior depends on how one defines this behavior. As an example 
    of their concern, panelists noted that they have seen "soil-pica" defined 
    in terms of quantities of soil ingested and whether the ingestion behavior 
    is abnormal, intentional, or repetitive (BL, JM, DV). One panelist cautioned 
    against limiting pica behavior to abnormal soil ingestion levels, because 
    such a restricted definition would overlook the fact that children's typical 
    behaviors can lead to relatively high soil/dust ingestion rates (see Section 
    3.1) (NF). The other panelists stressed that a clear, unambiguous definition 
    of soil-pica must be crafted so that ATSDR can quantify the prevalence using 
    the various methods discussed in Section 3.3. Given the importance of communicating 
    with consistent terminology, the panelists defined soil ingestion, soil-pica, 
    and geophagy at the close of the meeting. Refer to Section 2.0 for these definitions.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></LI>
</UL>
<UL>
  <LI><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>Comments on the distribution 
    of soil ingestion rates.</EM> When discussing the prevalence of soil-pica, 
    two panelists suggested that ATSDR view soil ingestion rates as a continuum, 
    possibly by characterizing the distribution of these rates (SD, JM). Knowing 
    the distribution of soil ingestion rates, according to one panelist, would 
    allow researchers to quantify the distribution of exposures to soil contaminants 
    at sites where the nature and extent of soil contamination has been determined, 
    but this panelist was not convinced that the data currently available are 
    sufficient for estimating this distribution (SD). Another panelist then asked 
    whether a table from a publication (Calabrese and Stanek, 1998) provides a 
    reasonable estimate of the distribution of soil intakes (DM). The panelist 
    responded that he was not sure, because he did not know how the estimate was 
    derived (SD).<A HREF="#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 
    Given the importance of knowing the distribution of soil ingestion rates for 
    various age groups, one panelist suggested that ATSDR try to estimate these 
    distributions from the various soil ingestion studies that have been published.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></LI>
</UL>
<UL>
  <LI><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>Comments on data reported 
    in the scientific literature.</EM> Though not commenting specifically on the 
    prevalence of soil-pica behavior, several panelists noted relevant data documented 
    in the scientific literature. For instance, one panelist noted that a team 
    of researchers has estimated that 33% of children ingest more than 10 grams 
    of soil 1 or 2 days a year (Calabrese and Stanek, 1998) (DM). Another panelist 
    cautioned, however, that this estimate is based on an extrapolation of a short-term 
    study and not on a study of soil ingestion over an entire year (NF). Another 
    panelist noted that his analytical studies as well as those published by Ed 
    Calabrese and Ed Stanek, and by Michael Wong present estimatesAppendix B: 
    Charge to the Panelists of soil ingestion rates, though they do not have consistent 
    findings (SD). Another panelist indicated that his research has found that 
    30% of children (aged 1-3 years) in Rochester, New York, ingest soils, based 
    on a survey of parents, and that this behavior is associated with a 14% increase 
    in blood lead levels (BL). This panelist cautioned about assuming that these 
    findings might apply to other sites and other contaminants. Overall, the panelists 
    thought their comments confirm that soil-pica exists, but they refrained from 
    providing quantitative estimates of the prevalence of soil-pica behavior, 
    largely because the available studies </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">are 
    limited in duration and not based on a population that represents all groups 
    of children.</SPAN></LI>
  <p></p>
  <p> 
  <LI><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>Prevalence of soil-pica among 
    pregnant women.</EM> One panelist noted that women in urban areas would likely 
    not dig and process their own geophagical clays, but would likely purchase 
    them or obtain them from areas where they were reared when relatives came 
    to visit (DV). Further, he doubted that pregnant women in urban areas would 
    consume surface soils from their backyards. Consistent with these comments, 
    another panelist provided an anecdotal account of stores in the Atlanta area 
    that sell geophagical clays, which pregnant women might consume (JM). The 
    panelists eventually agreed that studies have not been conducted to determine 
    the extent to which pregnant women exhibit soil-pica behavior, though they 
    suspected that consumption of residential soils is likely rare.</SPAN></LI>

  <LI><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>Variations in soil ingestion 
    rates with age.</EM> Citing his own research, one panelist indicated that 
    the percentage of children in his study who ingested soils, as reported by 
    their parents, was 3% for 6-month-old children, 30% for 12-month-old children, 
    31% for 18-month-old children, and gradually lower percentages for older children 
    (BL). (<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Note</SPAN>: this research 
    did not ask about "pica behavior," but rather asked parents whether their 
    children ingest soils.) Somewhat consistent with this finding, another panelist 
    added that he believes intentional soil ingestion behaviors decrease as children 
    reach roughly the age of 3 (DV). He attributed this apparent decrease to the 
    observation that parents try to control certain behaviors (including soil 
    ingestion) as children reach ages when they can reason, while they overlook 
    these behaviors when children are younger. One panelist indicated that the 
    available data on this topic are extremely limited (NF).</SPAN></LI>

  <LI><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>Implications of the prevalence 
    of soil-pica behavior.</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 
    The panelists offered various opinions on the implications of soil-pica behavior, 
    regardless of not knowing the exact extent to which it occurs. One panelist, 
    for example, believed that a significant number of children exhibit soil-pica 
    behavior, but added that an insignificant number of children might develop 
    adverse health effects (NF). She noted that ATSDR ultimately needs to consider 
    many factors other than the prevalence of soil-pica behavior (e.g., the nature 
    and extent of contamination and bioavailability) to put the health concerns 
    into perspective. This panelist added, however, that ATSDR should err on the 
    side of possibly overestimating the prevalence of soil-pica behavior, given 
    that it might be associated with adverse health effects. Another panelist 
    agreed, noting that his research has found soil ingestion, as reported by 
    parents, to be a significant risk factor for childhood lead poisoning (BL). 
    The panelists agreed that ATSDR should continue to evaluate the public health 
    implications of soil-pica behavior, despite the uncertainties associated with 
    the nature and extent of soil-pica. Most panelists agreed that ATSDR should 
    try to validate the public health significance of soil-pica behavior through 
    site-specific studies.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></LI>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The next question was: "What temporal 
  factors in the prevalence of soil-pica behavior should ATSDR consider (e.g., 
  does soil-pica behavior generally occur once a week, three times a week, etc.)?" 
  After a brief discussion, the panelists agreed that the existing soil ingestion 
  studies--nearly all of which evaluated children's behavior for durations of 
  2 weeks or shorter--are inadequate for determining the frequency of, and seasonal 
  variations in, soil-pica behavior.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Before reaching this conclusion, 
  several panelists commented on the extent to which temporal variations have 
  been considered in previous soil ingestion studies. One panelist noted that 
  his surveys of parents in Rochester, New York, did not ask them how frequently 
  their children ingest soils (BL). Another panelist said her surveys also focused 
  on whether children ingest soils, but not how often (NF). Reiterating a comment 
  made earlier, this panelist found that surveys are poor methods for accurately 
  quantifying detailed information about children's behavior, such as how often 
  they ingest soils. Thus, the panelists suggested that the available soil ingestion 
  survey data do not characterize the frequency of soil ingestion.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Other panelists commented that analytical 
  data do not adequately characterize temporal variations in soil ingestion. For 
  instance, two panelists indicated that none of the analytical studies examined 
  soil ingestion for durations longer than 4 months and that most studies lasted 
  only 2 weeks or less (SD, DM). Another panelist noted, however, that Ed Calabrese's 
  analytical study does demonstrate considerable day-to-day variability in soil 
  ingestion rates, but he questioned how representative this variability is of 
  children nationwide (RW). Overall, panelists agreed that the analytical studies 
  do not address seasonal variations in soil ingestion--a factor they thought 
  would be important in evaluating soil ingestion, particularly for regions with 
  cold winters. Consistent with this argument, one panelist indicated that blood 
  lead levels among children he has studied in Rochester, New York, tend to peak 
  during the summer (BL).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The panelists only briefly discussed 
  the extent geophagy and soil-pica vary across various subpopulations within 
  a given age group. Citing his own research, one panelist found the prevalence 
  of soil ingestion among white children to be higher than that among black children, 
  but he thought this finding is likely due to factors (e.g., coverage of yard 
  space with bare soils, time spent outdoors) other than a fundamental difference 
  in soil ingestion behaviors among ethnic groups (BL). Another panelist cautioned, 
  however, that data on soil ingestion collected in studies of children in the 
  northeastern United States might not be representative of soil ingestion rates 
  for children in other parts of the country (NF).</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Also citing his research, another 
  panelist indicated that geophagy in Mississippi did not appear to vary with 
  socio-economic class (DV). Finally, earlier in the workshop, this panelist noted 
  that consumption of geophagical materials by some Hispanics may be tied to religious 
  traditions both in Mexico and Honduras. No other panelists commented on these

  soil-pica behavior (see Section 3.4), the panelists also responded to the question, 
  "Should ATSDR evaluate soil-pica behavior as an exposure scenario for hazardous 
  waste sites or is soil-pica behavior too rare to be a public health concern?" 
  The panelists unanimously agreed that ATSDR should evaluate the public health 
  implications of all types of soil ingestion behavior, despite the uncertainties 
  that currently surround this issue. Two panelists noted that ATSDR is rightly 
  concerned about soil-pica behavior, because soil ingestion has already been 
  shown to be a significant risk factor for increased blood lead levels (BL) and 
  exposure to soil-transmitted parasites (PS). Some panelists noted that ATSDR's 
  current approach to evaluating the health implications of soil-pica behavior 
  is reasonable, despite the fact that extensive soil ingestion data are not available; 
  however, they repeatedly recommended that the agency gather additional data 
  on soil ingestion to provide confidence in their current approaches.</SPAN></P>

<p></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After addressing the questions on 
  the prevalence of soil-pica behavior, observers had the opportunity to comment 
  on the panelists' discussions. The panelists, in turn, responded to several 
  issues raised by the observers. Following is a summary of these discussions.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>
</SPAN> 
<UL>
  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 
  <LI><EM>Risk management implications of soil-pica behavior.</EM> The observers 
    and panelists debated at length how basing public health evaluations on soil-pica 
    behavior can have great implications on risk management decisions. Three observers 
    addressed this issue before the panelists responded. The first observer argued 
    that the prevalence of pica behavior is too low to form the basis for extensive 
    remedial decisions. Using a Superfund site in Denver as an example, this observer 
    argued that even though several thousand homes have contaminated soils, only 
    a very small subset of these homes have levels of contamination that might 
    be of concern for soil-pica children. Assuming that pica occurs rarely, the 
    observer stressed that soils at very few, if any, homes might actually present 
    health risks. Another observer disagreed, and argued that remedial actions 
    should be taken at sites such as the one in Denver, even if only a small number 
    of children--or even just one child--is at risk. Finally, a third observer 
    stressed that basing risk assessments on soil-pica behavior can lead to excessively 
    expensive remediation projects at sites across the country, including potentially 
    massive remediation activities at the Denver site. This observer wondered 
    if health risks to pica children are sufficient to warrant such extensive 
    remedial actions and whether actions other than soil removal might address 
    these risks.</LI>
  </span> 
</UL>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	
  The panelists also discussed risk management implications of soil-pica behavior 
  and offered different perspectives on the issue. Several panelists recommended 
  that additional studies be performed (see Section 6.0) to reduce uncertainties 
  in the current approaches to evaluating potential health risks to soil-pica 
  children (SD, BL, RW). Some thought these studies should examine the prevalence 
  of soil-pica behavior and the distribution of soil ingestion rates, while others 
  thought they should measure biomarkers and identify adverse health effects. 
  Regardless of the type of study, the panelists thought that more detailed information 
  was needed to give greater confidence in decisions based on risks to soil-pica 
  children. One panelist suggested that ATSDR recommend remediation for properties 
  where levels of soil contamination might pose a risk to soil-pica children, 
  as predicted by the current tools for estimating exposures (NF). This panelist 
  noted that such an approach is already often taken when public health officials 
  identify childhood lead poisoning.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></span></P>

  <LI><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM><strong>Public health implications 
    of geophagy versus soil-pica.</strong></EM> Reflecting on the observer comments 
    and discussions earlier at the workshop, one panelist highlighted an important 
    difference between geophagy and soil-pica (PS). Specifically, he noted that 
    geophagy is an institutionalized practice in which the processed clays or 
    other geophagical materials do not seem to have any adverse health effects. 
    However, he also stressed that soil-pica can lead to various health effects, 
    whether due to consumption of environmental contaminants or parasites. Accordingly, 
    he recommended that future discussions acknowledge the important difference 
    in the disease-causing potential of these two behaviors.</SPAN>

    <p> 
  </LI>
  <LI><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM><strong>Whether soil-pica is "abnormal" 
    behavior.</strong></EM> One panelist argued that geophagy is far too common around 
    the world to be considered abnormal behavior (DV). Another panelist noted 
    that incidental ingestion of soils among children--not just those with unusually 
    high intakes--is associated with increased blood lead levels (BL). The same 
    panelist pointed out that soil ingestion at levels of potential health concern 
    is too common to be labeled "abnormal."</SPAN>

  <LI><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM><strong>The possibility of geophagy 
    being an inherited trait.</strong></EM> One observer asked the panelists if geophagy 
    might be a genetic trait (i.e., mothers can pass the urge to consume clays 
    to their children). In response, one panelist noted that no studies have addressed 
    this issue, but he suspected that cultural influences alone would probably 
    lead to geophagy being most prevalent among families where it is practiced 
    and least prevalent among families where it is not (PS).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></LI>

  responses to the three charge questions pertaining to ingestion rates for soil-pica. 
  The panelists' comments are organized into three subject areas: ingestion rates 
  for an incident of soil-pica (Section 4.1), applying ingestion rates to acute, 
  intermediate, and chronic exposure durations (Section 4.2), and ingestion rates 
  for adults who exhibit soil-pica behavior (Section 4.3). The Executive Summary

  Ingestion Rates for an Incident of Soil-pica</a></STRONG></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The first charge question pertaining 
  to ingestion rates for soil-pica children was: "ATSDR currently assumes children 
  who exhibit soil-pica behavior, on average, ingest 5,000 mg of soil per day. 
  Based on your review of the literature on soil-pica behavior, is this soil ingestion 
  rate scientifically defensible? Does this represent plausible exposures for 
  children (i.e., is this soil ingestion rate unrealistically high or unrealistically 
  low)? What soil ingestion rate would you recommend?" The panelists agreed that 
  ATSDR's assumption that soil-pica children may ingest 5,000 mg of soil per day 
  appears to be supported by only a few subjects in soil ingestion studies (i.e., 
  two incidents in Massachusetts and several children in Jamaica). Referring to 
  the distribution of soil ingestion rates published in the literature, some panelists 
  thought ATSDR's assumed ingestion rate for soil-pica children seems high. Other 
  panelists thought the available data might be inadequate for characterizing 
  the distribution of soil ingestion rates among children. Tables 4-1 and 4-2, 
  at the end of this section, present some of the findings published in the literature 
  that formed the basis of the panelists' discussions.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The panelists also agreed that ATSDR 
  should err on the side of being protective when examining exposures to soil 
  contaminants. Following is a summary of the discussions that led to these key 
  findings.</SPAN></P>
<UL>
  <LI><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>Review 
    of data on maximum daily ingestion rates.</EM> The panelists first reviewed 
    the maximum soil ingestion rates reported in the literature. Citing data reported 
    in the background documents, one panelist commented that evidence of gram-level 
    soil ingestion has only been observed in two incidents in Massachusetts and 
    in six children in Jamaica, with the highest daily soil ingestion rate reported 
    being 50,000 mg (JM). After someone else noted that the 50,000 mg ingestion 
    rate was observed for a developmentally disabled child (DM), this panelist 
    said the next highest daily soil ingestion rate reported is 20,000 mg. She 
    questioned ATSDR's use of a soil ingestion rate (5,000 mg per day) that is 
    consistent with the most extreme soil ingestion rate ever reported (JM). Another 
    panelist agreed, noting that nearly every child that has been considered in 
    analytical studies has had ingestion rates considerably lower than 5,000 mg 
    per day, though he acknowledged that the design of these studies might not 
    be able to capture rare peaks in soil ingestion (SD).</SPAN></LI>
</UL>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> One panelist indicated that a statistical 
  analysis of the existing soil ingestion data (Calabrese and Stanek, 1998) estimates 
  that 42% of children will ingest 5,000 mg of soil on 1 or 2 days a year--a finding 
  he thought supports ATSDR's use of this soil ingestion rate (PS). Other panelists 
  argued, however, that this finding should be viewed as an estimate since it 
  is based on a statistical analysis of very limited data; they suspected that 
  the available soil ingestion data are not sufficient to characterize the distribution 
  of soil ingestion rates among children (SD, NF).</SPAN></P>
<UL>
  <LI><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><strong><EM>Comments on the distribution 
    of soil ingestion rates.</em></strong> Despite their concerns about whether the 
    available data adequately characterize this distribution, two panelists noted 
    that data presented in EPA's <EM>Exposure Factors Handbook</EM> suggest that 
    children who ingest 5,000 mg of soil a day are well above the 95<SUP>th</SUP> 
    percentile of soil ingestion rates (NF, RW). Citing Table 4-1 in the <EM>Exposure 
    Factors Handbook</EM>, for example, one panelist indicated that a study conducted 
    by Ed Calabrese and Ed Stanek reported a 95<SUP>th</SUP> percentile soil ingestion 
    rate of 208 mg per day (RW). Commenting further on this table, another panelist 
    noted that the 95<SUP>th</SUP> percentile soil ingestion rate calculated for 
    seven of the eight tracers considered ranged from 117 to 518 mg/day; she added 
    that only by considering manganese as a tracer did the study report 95<SUP>th</SUP> 
    percentile soil ingestion rates greater than 5,000 mg per day (NF). Given 
    the great differences among the tracers, this panelist questioned the validity 
    of the analytical method for characterizing soil ingestion rates. Nonetheless, 
    based on the presentation of these 95<SUP>th</SUP> percentile soil ingestion 
    rates, two panelists thought a case could be made for using a soil ingestion 
    rate lower than 5,000 mg per day for soil-pica children.</SPAN></LI>
</UL>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> When discussing the implications 
  of the analytical studies, some panelists noted that Ed Calabrese and Ed Stanek 
  not only observed a 95<SUP>th</SUP> percentile soil ingestion rate of 208 mg/day 
  based on the 64 children they studied, but also reported a 95<SUP>th</SUP> percentile 
  soil ingestion rate of 1,751 mg/day based on a statistical analysis of this 
  same data (see Table 4-2 in EPA's <EM>Exposure Factors Handbook</EM>) (DM). 
  Another panelist stressed that this higher soil ingestion rate was not actually 
  observed, but was based on various assumptions made when extrapolating data 
  collected over less than 2 weeks to soil ingestion behavior over an entire year 
  (JM). Nonetheless, some panelists noted that the more recent findings reported 
  by Ed Calabrese and Ed Stanek are more consistent with ATSDR's estimated soil 
  ingestion rate.</SPAN></P>

    its soil ingestion rate for pica children, the panelists ultimately found 
    it difficult to critique the validity of this parameter. The panelists suggested 
    that ATSDR should consider two approaches for deriving a defensible soil ingestion 
    rate. First, ATSDR should conduct a comprehensive soil ingestion study that 
    uses multiple methods to characterize the prevalence of pica behavior and 
    to quantify the distribution of soil ingestion rates (NF, BL, RW). Second, 
    until a more comprehensive study is performed, ATSDR should defend its soil 
    ingestion rate by conducting statistical analyses of the various analytical 
    studies reported in the literature<A HREF="#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 
    (DC, SD, NF). These panelists acknowledged, however, that such analyses will 
    continue to be limited because the available data are sparse and possibly 
    not representative of all geographic areas, cultures, and seasons. Given these 
    uncertainties, the panelists stressed the importance of validating any conclusions 
    drawn from the soil ingestion data currently available. Recommendations for 
    validating these conclusions included measuring biomarkers, identifying adverse 
    health effects, and conducting a multi-faceted study that relies on different 
    approaches for characterizing soil ingestion.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></LI>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The second charge question pertaining 
  to soil ingestion rates, was: "When evaluating children's exposure, ATSDR currently 
  applies the soil ingestion rate of 5,000 mg per day for the entire duration 
  of acute (&lt;14 days), intermediate (14-365 days), and chronic exposures (&gt;365 
  days) to develop screening levels. However, when evaluating site-specific residential 
  exposures, ATSDR may alter the frequency of the behavior depending on the duration 
  of expected exposure. For example, ATSDR may assume a one time exposure or 3 
  days of exposure per week for several weeks, depending on site-specific conditions 
  and toxicology of the contaminant of concern. Is this approach valid? What would 
  you recommend in varying the amount and frequency of soil ingested over time? 
  Are data available to support use of age-specific ingestion rates for soil-pica 
  children?"</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Because most of the analytical studies 
  of soil ingestion spanned 2 weeks or less and none lasted over 4 months, the 
  panelists agreed that soil ingestion rates over intermediate and chronic exposure 
  durations have yet to be characterized. One panelist noted that extrapolations 
  of short-term analytical studies to long-term exposure scenarios suggest that 
  few children likely ingest 5,000 mg of soil a day throughout a year (PS). Specifically, 
  he explained that a statistical review of an analytical study has suggested 
  that the likelihood of children ingesting 5,000 mg of soil every day of the 
  year is extremely low (&lt;1%) (Calabrese and Stanek, 1998). However, this panelist 
  and others stressed that no long-term studies have been conducted to verify 
  this finding.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The panelists did not explicitly

  Of the soil ingestion rates listed in this table for preschool children, the 
  median soil ingestion rate is 2,000 mg and the average value is 5,000 mg. One 
  panelist noted that the soil ingestion study published by Michael Wong does 
  not clearly state the nature and severity of the developmental disability in 
  the child who ingested large quantities of soil (NF). As a result, she was not 
  sure if this child's behavior would be expected to occur among other individuals 
  who have various types of developmental disabilities. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>

  Topic #3: Means for Identifying Soil-Pica Behavior</a></STRONG></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">This section summarizes the panelists' 
  responses to the charge questions addressing how ATSDR can best identify people 
  with soil-pica behavior. The discussion included a presentation by Dr. Natalie 
  Freeman (Section 5.1) and the panelists' specific responses to the questions 
  (Section 5.2). Observers did not comment on the panelists' discussions on this 
  topic.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><a name="5.1 Activities Contributing to Exposure and Ingestion of Soil/Dust:  Dr. Natalie Freeman">5.1 
  Activities Contributing to Exposure and Ingestion of Soil/Dust: Dr. Natalie 
  Freeman</a></STRONG></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Dr. Freeman opened the discussion 
  on how to identify soil-pica children by showing video footage from her observational 
  studies on how children come into contact with soils and household dusts. The 
  video showed children engaging in various behaviors that contribute to exposures, 
  such as putting objects in their mouths, playing with pets, handling food, eating 
  after playing outdoors, sucking thumbs, cleaning fingernails, playing in sandboxes, 
  and engaging in other hand-to-mouth activities. Dr. Freeman explained that the 
  extent of exposure depends on many factors, such as where children play, what 
  they wear, and how often they wash their hands. She noted further that the number 
  of times a day children wash their hands is often less than parents think, primarily 
  because parents often do not oversee this behavior. Dr. Freeman added that exposures 
  can occur even when children are relatively inactive. Specifically, she stated 
  that mouthing behavior was often greatest during periods of "down time," such 
  as just before children take naps or while they watch television. </SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Dr. Freeman acknowledged that this 
  particular research project did not attempt to quantify the amounts of soil 
  ingested by the various activities, but she indicated that exposures may be 
  significant. Citing a research project from the 1980s as an example, she noted 
  that as much as 10,000 mg of soil can adhere to certain types of candies, when 
  dropped outdoors (reference not provided). In conclusion, she emphasized that 
  the various activities that contribute to exposures to soil and dust are typical 
  children's behavior, and do not involve direct consumption of soils. Though 
  she has not quantified these exposures, Dr. Freeman suspected that the cumulative 
  effect of the various behaviors can lead to substantial ingestion of soils in 
  some children (e.g., those who play vigorously outdoors, and who frequently 
  engage in mouthing behavior, and who rarely wash their hands).</SPAN></P>
<P><strong><a name="5.2 Responses to Charge Questions">5.2 Responses to Charge Questions</a></strong></P>
</span style> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The third topic on the agenda had 
  only the following charge question: "ATSDR has reviewed studies that employed 
  analytical, observational, and questionnaire techniques for identifying children 
  who exhibit soil-pica behavior. What are the strengths and weaknesses of these 
  methods? Are there other methods available to identify people with soil-pica 
  behavior? Considering the pros and cons of each method, which method do you 
  think ATSDR should use to identify people with soil-pica behavior?"</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When addressing these issues, the 
  panelists referred to their earlier responses (Section 3.3) on the utility of 
  the different methods for characterizing the prevalence of soil-pica behavior. 
  In summary, because analytical, observational, and questionnaire approaches 
  all have their limitations, the panelists recommended that future studies use 
  multiple approaches to identify soil-pica children. The panelists added that 
  ATSDR needs to validate the findings of these approaches with epidemiologic 
  studies that measure biomarkers of exposure to give the greatest degree of confidence 
  in the results.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The panelists' other comments on 
  means for identifying soil-pica children focused on how to conduct effective 
  surveys. Following are their comments.</SPAN></P>
<UL>
  <LI><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>Behaviors to consider in 
    survey questions.</EM> Several panelists recommended that ATSDR review the 
    existing literature on soil ingestion questionnaires before developing their 
    own surveys (SD, NF, BL). For instance, one panelist indicated that his research 
    on children living in Midvale, Utah, has found no association between the 
    frequency of hand washing, as reported by parents, and blood lead levels (BL). 
    Another panelist added that his research found soil ingestion rates to be 
    essentially uncorrelated with several behaviors, such as thumb sucking, hand 
    washing, and use of pacifiers (SD). Both panelists thought that ATSDR could 
    select survey questions judiciously by reviewing the results of these and 
    other studies on soil ingestion. </SPAN></LI>
</UL>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Illustrating the utility of this 
  suggestion, the panelists debated the need for including questions about hand 
  washing on soil ingestion surveys. One panelist recommended that surveys address 
  this topic, but two others noted that their own research found hand washing 
  to be uncorrelated with other metrics of soil ingestion (i.e., analytical data 
  from a tracer study and blood lead levels) (SD, BL). Given this precedent, another 
  panelist questioned the utility of including detailed questions about personal 
  hygiene on a soil ingestion survey, particularly since questions are directed 
  at parents whose responses might be unreliable (NF).</SPAN></P>
<UL>
  <LI><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>Specific suggestions for 
    survey questions.</EM> The panelists offered several suggestions for specific 
    survey questions that can help ATSDR identify soil-pica children. One panelist, 
    for instance, suspected that ATSDR can adequately characterize parents' perceptions 
    of soil ingestion among their children by asking just five carefully crafted 
    questions (NF). She recommended using staged questions that start by focusing 
    on general information (e.g., "does your child eat soil or dirt?") and end 
    by addressing more specific information (e.g., "is this a weekly event?"). 
    Another panelist recommended that surveys use questions and response options 
    that are unambiguous (BL), (e.g., "how often have you observed your child 
    put soil or dirt in his or her mouth?", with response options of "never," 
    "once a month," "once a week," "once a day," or "several times a day.") He 
    thought such descriptive response options are needed to derive semi-quantitative 
    accounts of soil-pica. Another panelist agreed with the approach of using 
    specific, unambiguous questions (SD). He explained that his research has found 
    responses to direct and specific questions about a child eating dirt and soil 
    to be associated with higher levels of soil ingestion as determined analytically, 
    while responses to indirect questions were essentially unrelated to analytic 
    measures of soil ingestion.</SPAN></LI>
</UL>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Another panelist provided two more 
  suggestions on developing specific questions (NF). First, to avoid recall bias, 
  she recommended that ATSDR ask parents to remember recent events, as opposed 
  to events that occurred months or years earlier (e.g., "how often have you observed 
  your child put soil or dirt in his or her mouth in the last week?" rather than 
  "have you ever seen your child put soil or dirt in his or her mouth?") Second, 
  this panelist cautioned that using surveys to derive information on soil ingestion 
  rates would be challenging. She thought asking parents about behaviors that 
  lead to dramatically different ingestion rates (e.g., eating with fingers as 
  compared to putting handfuls of soil into their mouth) might help identify the 
  children who likely ingest the greatest quantities of soils, but she stressed 
  that surveys are not the best approach for getting quantitative data on soil 
  ingestion rates.</SPAN></P>
<UL>
  <LI><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>Other considerations for 
    surveys.</EM> The panelists listed several other suggestions for ATSDR to 
    consider when developing soil ingestion surveys. First, one panelist noted 
    that face-to-face interviews conducted by properly trained individuals typically 
    generate the most detailed information, though she acknowledged that this 
    approach is very time consuming and expensive (NF). This panelist added that 
    ATSDR should draft soil ingestion surveys to assess the frequency of specific 
    behaviors, and not to determine simply if these behaviors occur. Other recommendations 
    included noting on surveys that the questions pertain to typical children's 
    behavior (BL), ensuring that surveys are not too long (BL), and having trusted 
    and respected individuals (e.g., community leaders or pediatricians) administer 
    surveys (DV).</SPAN></LI>

  Topic #4: Additional Topics</a></STRONG></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The panelists raised several issues 
  when responding to the following final set of charge questions: "What critical 
  research needs should be addressed to provide ATSDR greater insight into the 
  public health implications of soil-pica behavior? What is known about the causes 
  of soil-pica behavior? Does the bioavailability of metals in soil change with 
  the amount of soil that is ingested? Is soil-pica behavior "normal"? Please 
  bring to ATSDR's attention any other topics relevant to soil-pica behavior that 
  are not addressed by the aforementioned questions."</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When responding to these questions, 
  the panelists referred to their earlier discussions on the causes of soil-pica 
  behavior and whether this behavior is considered "normal." Following is an overview 
  of the panelists' comments on research needs and bioavailability.</SPAN></P>
<UL>
  <LI><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>•Critical Research Needs.</EM> 
    Several panelists thought the most critical data gap currently is the lack 
    of a convincing account of the distribution of soil ingestion rates for various 
    age groups, geographic regions, and selected subpopulations (SD, PS). The 
    panelists thought that future research can best fill this gap, through a multi-faceted 
    approach, possibly one that uses questionnaires, analytical studies, biomarkers, 
    and observational studies to generate multiple lines of evidence of the distribution 
    of soil ingestion rates. The panelists said that research is needed to validate 
    the data currently reported in the literature and to generate additional data. 
    Some panelists commented further on detailed study protocols that might help 
    achieve this goal. These suggestions are not summarized here, but the panelists 
    emphasized that research on the distribution of soil ingestion rates is needed 
    so that ATSDR and other agencies can base their public health evaluations 
    on more rigorously validated assumptions.</SPAN></LI>
</UL>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The panelists identified other 
  data gaps, including the lack of soil ingestion data for older children (aged 
  7 and higher) and adults (JM), and the need for data characterizing long-term 
  variations in soil ingestion (RW). One panelist also recommended that ATSDR 
  determine whether the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 
  is collecting data that can be used to characterize soil ingestion rates (RO). 
  Another panelist noted that this survey is measuring blood lead levels and analyzing 
  floor-wipe samples in certain homes, but he was not sure how these data might 
  relate to soil-pica. Lastly, wondering if analytical studies that measure isotopic 
  ratios of various tracers can generate robust estimates of soil ingestion rates, 
  some panelists recommended that ATSDR investigate the feasibility of conducting 
  such a study.</SPAN></P>
<UL>
  <LI><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>Bioavailability of metals 
    in ingested soils.</EM> None of the panelists knew of studies showing that 
    bioavailability of metals in soils decreases as soil ingestion rates increase, 
    all other factors (e.g., particle size distribution) considered equal. Noting 
    that pharmaceutical research has shown that humans absorb a smaller percentage 
    of drugs when they are administered at higher doses, one panelist thought 
    that bioavailability of metals in soils might decrease to a certain, but unknown, 
    extent with higher doses (RW). He and other panelists (NF, DV) listed several 
    other factors that likely play a greater role in bioavailability, such as 
    alkalinity, particle size distribution, and composition of the soils, and 
    the exposed individual's age, nutritional status, and dietary composition. 
    One panelist added that bioavailability can vary considerably from metal to 
    metal.</SPAN></LI>
  > 
</UL>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> An observer noted that the issue 
  of bioavailability varying with ingestion rates has important implications on 
  how ATSDR evaluates acute health risks among soil-pica children. In such cases, 
  a panelist thought the best approach to validate assumptions about bioavailability 
  would be to conduct health studies to examine the prevalence of specific acute 
  health outcomes (BL). The observer asked the panelists if they saw a need to 
  research how bioavailability might vary with soil ingestion rate, possibly using 
  recently developed <EM>in vitro</EM> models or EPA's swine <EM>in vivo</EM> 
  models. A panelist recommended that ATSDR research bioavailability first by 
  reviewing the results of soil ingestion tracer studies that collected biomarker 
  data before considering conducting the modeling studies suggested by the observer 
  (BL).</SPAN></P>
<UL>
  <LI><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>The need for reporting soil 
    ingestion on a body-weight basis.</EM> One panelist asked if future research 
    on soil ingestion should measure soil intake normalized to body weight (e.g., 
    reporting "x milligrams of soil ingested per x kilogram of body weight"), 
    consistent with how EPA is currently characterizing food and water ingestion 
    rates (JM). Some panelists thought normalizing intakes to body weight would 
    be consistent with other exposure metrics (BL), but others did not think this 
    new approach added any insight to soil ingestion, especially considering that 
    ATSDR already accounts for body weights in its exposure dose calculations 
    (RO).</SPAN></LI>
</UL>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><a name="7.0 Conclusions">7.0 
  Conclusions</a></STRONG></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In summary, the panelists reached 
  the following conclusions and recommendations.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">• Soil-pica is the repeated consumption 
  of soil (either intentional or unintentional) and geophagy is the intentional 
  ingestion of earths that is usually associated with cultural practices.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">• Soil-pica behavior exists. ATSDR 
  should evaluate the public health significance of all types of soil ingestion, 
  including soil-pica.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">• Groups at risk of soil-pica behavior 
  include children aged 6 years and younger as well as developmentally delayed 
  individuals. </SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">• For now ATSDR should use 5,000 
  mg as an estimate of soil intake for children with soil-pica behavior.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">• Geophagy typically involves consumption 
  of clay from known (and usually uncontaminated) sources at depth rather than 
  consumption of surface soil from residential properties. ATSDR should investigate 
  geophagy when the agency identifies this practice in a community.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">• ATSDR should conduct a multicomponent 
  investigation into soil-pica behavior.</SPAN></P>

  B: Charge to the Panelists</a></STRONG></SPAN></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>CHARGE TO 
  THE PANELISTS</STRONG></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Agency for Toxic Substances 
  and Disease Registry (ATSDR) scheduled this workshop to assess the current state 
  of the science on soil-pica behavior--an issue that is relevant to ATSDR's ongoing 
  work at sites with human exposure to contaminated soils. ATSDR intends to use 
  the findings of this workshop to ensure that the agency continues to provide 
  meaningful and scientifically defensible analyses of the potential health threats 
  for individuals who exhibit soil-pica behavior.</SPAN></P>
<p>During this workshop, ATSDR seeks expert opinions on several key questions, 
  which are outlined below. Further, ATSDR welcomes insights on additional topics 
  relevant to soil-pica behavior not explicitly addressed in the questions (see 
  topic #4). Following the workshop, ATSDR will prepare a summary report to document 
  the panelists'responses to these questions. The workshop discussions will focus 
  on answering the questions that pertain to the following four topics:</P>
</SPAN> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><EM>Topic #1: The prevalence 
  of soil-pica behavior.</EM></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM></EM> 
  A key aspect of preparing public health assessments and consultations pertaining 
  to soil-pica behavior is having a sense of the prevalence of this behavior among 
  different groups. A review of the literature shows several types of methods 
  used to characterize soil-pica behavior, such as analytical, observational, 
  and questionnaire. Some studies were provided to you prior to the workshop that 
  used these methods. Using these and other studies, ATSDR seeks the expert panel's 
  inputs on the following questions:</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">• </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">What 
  observational, questionnaire, and analytical studies are most valid for characterizing 
  the extent of soil-pica behavior? </SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">• </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">What 
  is the prevalence rate of soil-pica behavior among children, especially preschool 
  children</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">? among adults? among 
  pregnant women?</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">• </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">What 
  temporal factors in the prevalence of soil-pica behavior should ATSDR consider 
  (e.g., does soil-pica behavior generally occur once a week, three times a week, 
  etc.)?</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">• </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Within 
  the various age categories, has the prevalence of soil-pica behavior been shown 
  to be more common among any groups (e.g., urban or rural populations, ethnic 
  groups, people of different socio-economic status)?</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">• </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Should 
  ATSDR evaluate soil-pica behavior as an exposure scenario for hazardous waste 
  sites or is soil-pica behavior too rare to be a public health concern?</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><EM>Topic #2: Ingestion 
  rates for soil-pica.</EM></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM></EM> 
  The expert panelists were provided several scientific papers as well as the 
  chapter from EPA's </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>Exposure 
  Factors Handbook</EM> that summarizes soil ingestion rates that have been reported 
  for soil-pica children. The soil ingestion rates ATSDR uses are a critical input 
  to the agency's public health evaluations. Please be prepared to respond to 
  the following questions pertaining to soil ingestion rates:</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">• </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ATSDR 
  currently assumes children who exhibit soil-pica behavior, on average, ingest 
  5&nbsp;mg of soils per day. Based on your review of the literature on soil-pica 
  behavior, is this soil ingestion rate scientifically defensible? Does this represent 
  plausible exposures for children (i.e., is this soil ingestion rate unrealistically 
  high or unrealistically low)? What soil ingestion rate would you recommend?</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When 
  evaluating children's exposure, ATSDR currently applies the soil ingestion rate 
  of 5 mg per day for the entire duration of acute (&lt;14 days), intermediate 
  (14-365 days), and chronic exposures (&gt;365 days) but may alter the frequency 
  of the behavior depending on the duration of expected exposure. For example, 
  ATSDR may assume a 1 time exposure or 3 days of exposure per week for several 
  weeks depending on site-specific conditions and toxicology of the contaminant 
  of concern. Is this approach valid? What would you recommend in varying the 
  amount and frequency of soil ingested over time? Are data available to support 
  use of age-specific ingestion rates for soil-pica children?</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">• </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Are 
  sufficient data available for establishing a scientifically defensible soil 
  ingestion rate for adults who exhibit soil-pica behavior? If so, what soil ingestion 
  rate do you recommend?</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><EM>Topic #3: Means for 
  identifying people with soil-pica behavior.</EM></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM></EM> 
  An important element of ATSDR's public health mission is to prevent unhealthy 
  exposures to hazardous chemicals. Thus, the agency is interested in how health 
  professionals and parents can identify children who exhibit soil-pica behavior. 
  More specifically:</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">• </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ATSDR 
  has reviewed studies that employed analytical, observational, and questionnaire 
  techniques for identifying children who exhibit soil-pica behavior. What are 
  the strengths and weaknesses of these methods? Are there other methods available 
  to identify people with soil-pica behavior? Considering the pros and cons of 
  each method, which method do you think ATSDR should use to identify people with 
  soil-pica behavior?</SPAN></P>
</SPAN> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><strong><a name="6.0 Topic #4:  Additional Topics">6.0 
  Topic #4: Additional Topics</a></strong></span><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM></EM> 
  </span></p>
<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 
<p>The panelists raised several issues when responding to the following final 
  set of charge questions: "What critical research needs should be addressed to 
  provide ATSDR greater insight into the public health implications of soil-pica 
  behavior? What is known about the causes of soil-pica behavior? Does the bioavailability 
  of metals in soil change with the amount of soil that is ingested? Is soil-pica 
  behavior "normal"? Please bring to ATSDR's attention any other topics relevant 
  to soil-pica behavior that are not addressed by the aforementioned questions.</P>
</SPAN> 
<P>When discussing the charge questions, please submit citations for references 
  that ATSDR should consider when evaluating soil-pica behavior.</P>

The panelists briefly debated whether the definition should have the term "repeated 
ingestion" or "recurrent ingestion." Noting that "repeated ingestion" might imply 
a pattern of soil-pica events, rather than these events occurring randomly, the 
panelists agreed that "recurrent ingestion" is the most appropriate wording for 
this definition. </SPAN> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><A NAME="N_2_">2. </A></span><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 
  At this point, an observer clarified that the author of the publication apparently 
  extrapolated the results of a 2-week analytical study to soil ingestion rates 
  over the course of the year. This extrapolation reportedly assumed that the 
  variability of soil ingestion rates over a year is greater than that which was 
  observed in 2 weeks--an assumption the observer questioned given that the study 
  of concern was conducted during the summer, when soil ingestion rates would 
  likely be greatest and perhaps most variable. </SPAN>

  the Environmental Law Reporter (Calabrese and Stanek, 1998).</SPAN></P>
