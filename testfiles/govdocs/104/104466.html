          Within just a few years, the possibility that the human body contains
          cells that can repair and regenerate damaged and diseased tissue has
          gone from an unlikely proposition to a virtual certainty.  Adult stem
          cells have been isolated from numerous adult tissues, umbilical cord,
          and other non-embryonic sources, and have demonstrated a surprising
          ability for transformation into other tissue and cell types and for
          repair of damaged tissues.  This paper will examine the published
          literature regarding the identity of adult stem cells and possible
          mechanisms for their observed differentiation into tissue types other
          than their tissue of origin.  Reported data from both human and
          animal studies will be presented on the various tissue sources of
          adult stem cells and the differentiation and repair abilities for
          each source, especially with regards to current and potential
          therapeutic treatments.

      <P>
        Adult stem cells have received intense scrutiny over the past few years
        due to surprising discoveries regarding heretofore unknown abilities to
        form multiple cell and tissue types, as well as the discovery of such
        cells in an increasing number of tissues.  The term "adult stem cell"
        is somewhat of a misnomer, because the cells are present even in
        infants and similar cells exist in umbilical cord and placenta.  More
        accurate terms have been proposed, such as tissue stem cells, somatic
        stem cells, or post-natal stem cells.  However, because of common usage
        this review will continue to use the term adult stem cell.
      </P>
      <P>
        This paper will review the literature related to adult stem cells,
        including current and potential clinical applications (with apologies
        to the many who are not cited, due to the exponential increase in
        papers regarding adult stem cells and the limitations of this review.) 
        The focus will be on human adult stem cells, but will also include
        results from animal studies which bear on the potential of adult stem
        cells to be used therapeutically for patients.
      </P>
            <P> This paper will <U>not</U> attempt to review the literature related 
              to hematopoietic stem cells, <I>i.e.</I>, the bone marrow stem cell 
              that is the immediate precursor for blood cells, and the formation 
              of typical blood cells.  Nor will this paper review the substantial 
              literature regarding clinical use of bone marrow or bone marrow 
              stem cell transplants for hematopoietic conditions such as various 
              cancers and anemias, nor the striking clinical results seen for 
              conditions such as scleromyxedema, multiple sclerosis, systemic 
              lupus, arthritis, Crohn's disease, etc.<sup><a href="#endnote1">1</a></sup>  
              In these instances, the stem cells are used primarily to replace 
              the hematopoietic system of the patient, after ablation of the patient's 
              own bone marrow hematopoietic system.  Finally, multipotent adult 
              progenitor cells (MAPC's), a bone marrow stem cell that has shown 
              significant abilities at proliferation in culture and differentiation 
              into other body tissues,<sup><a href="#endnote2">2</a></sup> have 
              been reviewed by Dr. Catherine Verfaillie in a separate paper for 
              the President's Council on Bioethics, and the reader is directed 
              to that review for more information. </P>
      <P>
        Key questions regarding adult stem cells are: (1) their identity, (2)
        their tissue source of origin, (3) their ability to form other cell or
        tissue types, and (4) the mechanisms behind such changes in
        differentiation and effects on tissues and organs.  Historically only a
        few stem cells were recognized in humans, such as the hematopoietic
        stem cell which produces all of the blood cell types, the
        gastrointestinal stem cell associated with regeneration of the
        gastrointestinal lining, the stem cell responsible for the epidermal
        layer of skin, and germ cell precursors (in the adult human, the
        spermatogonial stem cell.)  These stem cells were considered to have
        very limited repertoires, related to replenishment of cells within
        their tissue of origin.  These limitations were considered to be a
        normal part of the developmental paradigm in which cells become more
        and more restricted in their lineage capabilities, leading to defined
        and specific differentiated cells in body tissues.  Thus, discovery of
        stem cells in other tissues, or with the ability to cross typical
        lineage boundaries, is both exciting and confusing because such
        evidence challenges the canonical developmental paradigm.

            <P CLASS="c2"> <strong>STEM CELL MARKERS </strong> </P>
            <P> Identification of cells typically relies on use of cell surface 
              markers-cellular differentiation (CD) antigens-that denote the expression 
              of particular proteins associated with genomic activity related 
              to a particular differentiation state of the cell.  Identification 
              also has relied on morphological and molecular indications of function, 
              such as expression of specific enzymes.  Since stem cells by definition 
              have not yet taken on a specific differentiated function, their 
              identification has relied primarily on use of cell surface markers, 
              and only secondarily on production of differentiated products in 
              various tissues.  One stated goal has been to isolate a single putative 
              adult stem cell, characterized fully by specific markers and molecular 
              characteristics, and then to follow the differentiation of this 
              single cell (and/or its progeny) to show that it indeed has multipotent 
              or pluripotent capabilities (clonogenic ability).  For bone marrow 
              stem cells, selection of putative adult stem cells has usually excluded 
              typical markers for hematopoietic lineages (lin<SUP>-</SUP>), CD45, 
              CD38, with inclusion or exclusion of the hematopoietic marker CD34 
              and inclusion of the marker c-kit (CD117).  Other proposed markers 
              for adult stem cells are AC133-2 (CD133), which is found on many 
              stem cell populations,<sup><a href="#endnote3">3</a></sup> and C1qR<SUB>p</SUB>, 
              the receptor for complement molecule C1q,<sup><a href="#endnote4">4</a></sup> 
              found on a subset of CD34<SUP>+/-</SUP> human stem cells from bone 
              marrow and umbilical cord blood.  When transplanted into immunodeficient 
              mice, C1qR<SUB>p</SUB>-positive human stem cells formed not only 
              hematopoietic cells but also human hepatocytes.  Other methods of 
              isolation and identification include the ability of putative stem 
              cells to exclude fluorescent dyes (rhodamine 123, Hoechst 33342), 
              allowing isolation by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) 
              of a "side population" of cells within a tissue that have stem cell 
              characteristics.  Expression of the <I>Bcrp1</I> gene (ABCG2 gene 
              in humans) is apparently responsible for this dye exclusion, and 
              could provide a common molecular expression marker for stem cells<sup><a href="#endnote5">5</a></sup>.  
              A study of expressed genes from a single cell-derived colony of 
              human mesenchymal stem cells identified transcripts from numerous 
              cell lineages,<sup><a href="#endnote6">6</a></sup> and a similar 
              attempt at profiling the gene expression of human neural stem cell 
              in culture with leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) has been done,<sup><a href="#endnote7">7</a></sup> 
              perhaps providing an expressed molecular milieu which could identify 
              candidate stem cells.  Attempts to determine the complete molecular 
              signature of gene expression common to human and mouse stem cells 
              have shown over 200 common genes between hematopoietic and neural 
              stem cells, with some considerable overlap with mouse embryonic 
              stem cells as well.<sup><a href="#endnote8">8</a></sup>  The function 
              of many of these genes is as yet unknown, but may provide distinctive 
              markers for identification of adult stem cells in different tissues. 
            </P>
            <P> However, dependence on particular markers for prospective identification 
              and isolation of adult stem cells seems unreliable.  In particular, 
              the use of specific hematopoietic markers such as the presence or 
              absence of CD34, has yielded mixed results in terms of the identification 
              of putative stem cells.  There is evidence that the expression of 
              CD34 and CD133 can actually change over time, and its expression 
              may be part of a cycling phenomenon among human hematopoietic and 
              mesenchymal stem cells in the bone marrow and peripheral blood, 
              and perhaps in other tissues,<sup><a href="#endnote9">9</a></sup> 
              <I>i.e.</I>, an isolated CD34<SUP>+</SUP> cell may become CD34<SUP>-</SUP>, 
              and then reacquire CD34 expression.  Likewise, a systematic analysis 
              of the cell surface markers and differentiation potential of supposedly 
              distinct isolated populations of human bone marrow stem cells revealed 
              no differences in practice between the cell populations.<sup><a href="#endnote10">10</a></sup>  
              Moreover, an analysis of genetic and ultrastructural characteristics 
              of human mesenchymal stem cells undergoing differentiation and dedifferentiation 
              has revealed reversibility in the characteristics studied.<sup><a href="#endnote11">11</a></sup></P>
            <P>   Thus, any attempt to isolate a single type of adult stem cell 
              for study may not actually capture the intended cell, or may, by 
              using a particular set of isolation or growth conditions, alter 
              its gene expression.  This idea has been elaborated by Thiese and 
              Krause,<sup><a href="#endnote12">12</a></sup> who note that this 
              "uncertainty principle" means any attempt to isolate and characterize 
              a cell necessarily alters its environment, and thereby potentially 
              its gene expression, identity, and potential ability to differentiate 
              along various lineages.  Likewise, the stochastic nature of cell 
              differentiation in such dynamic and interacting systems means that 
              attempts to delineate differentiation pathways must include descriptions 
              of each parameter associated with the conditions used, and still 
              may lead only to a probabilistic outcome for differentiation of 
              a stem cell into a particular tissue.  Blau <I>et al.</I><sup><a href="#endnote13">13</a></sup> 
              have raised the question of whether there may be a "universal" adult 
              stem cell, residing in multiple tissues and activated dependent 
              on cellular signals, <I>e.g.,</I> tissue injury.  When recruited 
              to a tissue, the stem cell would take its cues from the local tissue 
              milieu in which it finds itself (including the soluble growth factors, 
              extracellular matrix, and cell-cell contacts.)  Examples of such 
              environmental influences on fate choice have been noted previously.<sup><a href="#endnote14">14</a></sup>  
              Thus, it may not be surprising to see examples of cells isolated 
              using the same marker set showing disparate differentiative potentials,<SUP>,</SUP><sup><a href="#endnote15,16,17,18">15, 
              16,17,18</a></sup> based on the context of the isolation or experimental 
              conditions, or to see cells with different marker sets showing similar 
              differentiation.  In the final analysis, description of a "stem 
              cell", its actual tissue of origin, and even its differentiation 
              ability, may be a moving target describable only within the context 
              of the particular experimental paradigm used, and may require asking 
              the correct questions in context of the cell's identity and abilities 
              not clonally but rather within a population of cells, and within 
              a certain environment.<SUP><a href="#endnote12">12</a>,</SUP><sup><a href="#endnote19">19</a></sup> 
            </P>
            <P> Given the uncertainties involved in isolating and identifying 
              particular adult stem cells, Moore and Quesenberry<sup><a href="#endnote20">20</a></sup> 
              suggest that we consider an adult stem cell's functional ability 
              to be, at a minimum, taking on the morphology and cell markers of 
              a differentiated tissue, supplemented by any further functional 
              activity and interaction within a tissue.  Certainly a physiological 
              response by improvement of function in a damaged organ system is 
              an indication of a functional response.<SUP><a href="#endnote19">19</a>,
              <a href="#endnote20">20</a></SUP>  As will be discussed later, the 
              function and therapeutic benefit may not necessarily require direct 
              differentiation and integration of an adult stem cell into a desired 
              tissue, but could be accomplished by stimulation of endogenous cells 
              within the tissue. </P>
            <P CLASS="c2"> <strong>DIFFERENTIATION MECHANISMS </strong> </P>
            <P> Several possible mechanisms have been proposed for differentiation 
              of adult stem cells into other tissues.  One mechanism that has 
              received attention lately is the possibility of cell fusion, whereby 
              the stem cell fuses with a tissue cell and takes on that tissue's 
              characteristics.  <I>In vitro</I> experiments using fusion of somatic 
              cells with embryonic stem cells and embryonic germ cells<sup><a href="#endnote21">21</a></sup> 
              have demonstrated that the cell hybrid can take on characteristics 
              of the more primitively developed cell.  However, given that such 
              characteristics of spontaneous cell fusion hybrids <I>in vitro</I> 
              have been known for quite some time,<sup><a href="#endnote22">22</a></sup> 
              and that a cell fusion hybrid does not explain <I>in vitro</I> differentiation 
              of adult stem cells unexposed to tissues, the experiments could 
              not verify this as a possible mechanism for adult stem cell differentiation.  
              More recently, <I>in vivo</I> experiments have shown that for liver,<sup><a href="#endnote23">23</a></sup> 
              formation of a cell fusion hybrid is a viable explanation for some 
              of the differentiation as well as repair of liver damage seen in 
              these experiments.  In an <I>in vitro</I> experiment where human 
              mesenchymal stem cells were co-cultured with heat-shocked small 
              airway epithelial cells, a mixed answer was obtained-some of the 
              stem cells differentiated directly into epithelial cells, while 
              others formed cell fusion hybrids to repair the damage.<sup><a href="#endnote24">24</a></sup>  
              The ability to form cell hybrids in some tissues may be a useful 
              mechanism for repair of certain types of tissue damage or for delivery 
              of therapeutic genes to a tissue.<sup><a href="#endnote25">25</a></sup> 
              The reprogramming of cellular gene expression via hybrids is not 
              unlike a novel method reported recently for transdifferentiation 
              of somatic cells.  In this method, fibroblasts were soaked in the 
              cytoplasm and nucleoplasm of a lysed, differentiated T lymphocyte 
              cell, taking up factors from the exposed "soup" of the cellular 
              contents of the differentiated cell, and began expressing functional 
              characteristics of a T cell.<sup><a href="#endnote26">26</a></sup>  
            </P>
            <P> In contrast to the results discussed above, other experiments 
              have shown no evidence that cell fusion plays a role in differentiation 
              of adult stem cells into other tissue types.  For example, using 
              human subjects it was shown that human bone marrow cells differentiated 
              into buccal epithelial cells <I>in vivo</I> without cell fusion,<sup><a href="#endnote27">27</a></sup> 
              and human cord blood stem cells formed hepatocytes in mouse liver 
              without evidence of cell fusion.<sup><a href="#endnote28">28</a></sup>  
              In these cases it appears that the adult stem cells underwent changes 
              in gene expression and directly differentiated into the host tissue 
              cell type, integrating into the tissue.  It is likely that the mechanism 
              of adult stem cell differentiation may vary depending on the target 
              tissue, or possibly on the state of the adult stem cell used, especially 
              given that normal functioning liver typically shows cell fusion 
              hybrids, with cell fusion functioning as a mechanism for most of 
              the differentiation and repair in tissues such as liver, and direct 
              differentiation (transdifferentiation) into other cell types functioning 
              in other tissues.  Much remains to be determined regarding the mechanisms 
              associated with adult stem cell differentiation. </P>
      <P>
        Keeping in mind the uncertainties noted above for identification of a
        particular adult stem cell and its initial tissue of origin, the
        majority of this review will focus on some of the evidence for adult
        stem cell differentiation into other tissues.  The cells will be
        categorized based on general tissue of isolation, with the primary
        emphasis on human adult stem cells, supplemented with information from
        animal studies.

            <P> Bone marrow contains at least two, and likely more,<sup><a href="#endnote2">2,

              cell populations.  Besides the hematopoietic stem cell which produces 
              blood cell progeny, a cell type termed mesenchymal or stromal also 
              exists in marrow.  This cell provides support for hematopoietic 
              and other cells within the marrow, and has also been a focus for 
              possible tissue repair.<sup><a href="#endnote30">30</a></sup>  Isolation 
              is typically based on some cell surface markers, but also primarily 
              on the ability of these cells to form adherent cell layers in culture.  
              Human mesenchymal stem cells have been shown to differentiate <I>in

              and skeletal muscle, bone marrow stromal cells, fat cells, thymic 
              epithelial cells, and cartilage cells.  Analysis of a highly purified 
              preparation of human mesenchymal stem cells<sup><a href="#endnote34">34</a></sup>  
              indicated that they could proliferate extensively in culture, constitutively

              retained the ability to differentiate <I>in vitro</I> into bone, 
              fat, and cartilage cells.  Isolated colonies of the cells formed 
              bone when injected into immunodeficient mice.  Expanding on their 
              previous <I>in vitro</I> work with rat and human mesenchymal/stromal

              performed molecular analyses of rat stromal stem cells and found 
              that the cells express genes associated with all three primary germ 
              layers-mesodermal, ectodermal, and endodermal-as well as a gene 
              associated for germinal cells.  The gene expression pattern was 
              also seen in a clonal population of cells, indicating that it was 
              not due to an initial mixed population of cells, but was the typical 
              gene expression pattern of the stromal cells.  The results suggested 
              that the stromal stem cells were already multidifferentiated and 
              that switching to a neuronal differentiation pattern involved quantitative 
              regulation of existing gene expression patterns.  Koc <I>et al.<sup><a href="#endnote36">36</a></sup></I>

              associated with Hurler syndrome (mucopolysaccharidosis type-IH) 
              and metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD).  A total of 11 patients 
              received donor mesenchymal stem cells, expanded from bone marrow

            <P> Bone marrow-derived cells in general have shown ability to form

              In this procedure, treatment of unfractionated bone marrow in culture

            <P> <I>In vivo</I> studies using fluorescence and genetic tracking 
              of adult stem cells in animals, and tracking of the Y chromosome 
              in humans, has shown that bone marrow stem cells can contribute 
              to numerous adult tissues.  Follow-up of patients receiving adult 
              bone marrow stem cell transplants has allowed tracking of adult 
              stem cells within humans, primarily by identification of Y chromosome-bearing 
              cells in female patients who had received bone marrow stem cells 
              from male donors.  Biopsy or postmortem samples show that some of 
              the transplanted bone marrow stem cells could form liver, skin, 
              and digestive tract cells,<I><sup><a href="#endnote39">39</a></sup></I>

            <P> Regeneration or replacement of dead or damaged cells is the primary 
              goal of regenerative medicine and one of the prime motivations for 
              study of stem cells.  It is thus of significant interest that bone 
              marrow stem cells have shown the ability to produce therapeutic 
              benefit in animal models of stroke.  In mice, fluorescence-tracked 
              bone marrow derived stem cells expressed neuronal antigens and also 
              incorporated as endothelial cells, possibly producing therapeutic 
              benefit by allowing increased blood flow to damaged areas of the 
              brain.<I><sup><a href="#endnote43">43</a></sup></I></P>
            <P>   In rats, intravenous (IV) administration of rat<I><sup><a href="#endnote44">44</a></sup></I> 
              or human<I><sup><a href="#endnote45">45</a></sup></I> bone marrow 
              stromal cells resulted in significant behavioral recovery after 
              stroke.  Interestingly, only a small percentage of the stromal stem 
              cells appeared to incorporate into the damaged brain as neuronal 
              cells (1-5% in the case of the human marrow stromal cells), but 
              the levels of neurotrophin growth factors within the brains increased 
              and were possibly the signal for repair of damaged brain tissue, 
              perhaps by stimulation of endogenous neuronal precursors.  It is 
              also of interest that the marrow stromal cells were injected IV 
              and not intracerebrally, indicating that the stem cells somehow 
              "homed" to the site of tissue damage.  Most studies showing adult 
              stem cell differentiation into other tissues show an increased incorporation 
              of cells, or even an absolute requirement for differentiation, relying 
              on tissue damage to initiate the differentiation.  This may indicate 
              that without a "need" for replacement and repair, there is little 
              or no activation of adult stem cells.  The recruitment and homing 
              of adult stem cells to damaged tissues are fascinating but relatively 
              unexplained phenomena.  One report<I><sup><a href="#endnote46">46</a></sup></I> 
              indicates that recruitment of quiescent stem cells from bone marrow 
              to the circulation requires release of soluble c-kit ligand (stem 
              cell factor), but the range of factors necessary for recruitment 
              and homing to organs other than bone marrow is unknown at this time 
              and warrants increased investigation. </P>
            <P> Bone marrow stem cells have also shown the ability to participate 
              in repair of damaged retinal tissues.  When bone marrow stem cells 
              were injected into the eyes of mice, they associated with retinal 
              astrocytes and extensively incorporated into the vascular (blood 
              vessel) network of the eye.<I><sup><a href="#endnote47">47</a></sup></I>  
              The cells could also rescue and maintain normal vasculature in the 
              eyes of mice with a degenerative vascular disease.  In another animal 
              study, bone marrow derived stem cells were observed to integrate 
              into injured retina and differentiated into retinal neuronal cells.<I><sup><a href="#endnote48">48</a></sup></I>  
              Stromal stem cells have also shown capability in mice to repair 
              spinal cord which was demyelinated.<I><sup><a href="#endnote49">49</a></sup></I>  
              One of the problems related to spinal cord injury is loss of the 
              protective myelin sheath from spinal cord after injury.  A mixed 
              bone marrow stem cell fraction was injected into the area of damage 
              in the spinal cord, and remyelination of the area was seen.  In 
              another mouse study, marrow stromal cells injected into injured 
              spinal cord formed guiding strands within the cord;<I><sup><a href="#endnote50">50</a></sup></I> 
              interestingly, the effect was more pronounced when the stromal cells 
              were injected 1 week after injury rather than immediately after 
              injury. </P>
            <P> Because bone marrow stem cells are of mesodermal lineage, it is 
              not surprising that they show capabilities at forming other tissues 
              of mesodermal origin.  Human marrow stromal cells, which have been 
              shown to form cartilage cells, have been used in an <I>in vitro</I> 
              system to define many of the molecular events associated with formation 
              of cartilage tissue.<I><sup><a href="#endnote51">51</a></sup></I>  
              Bone marrow derived stem cells have also been shown capable of regenerating 
              damaged muscle tissue.<I><sup><a href="#endnote52">52</a></sup></I>  
              In an elegant study following genetically marked bone marrow stem 
              cells in mice, LaBarge and Blau were able to document multiple steps 
              in the progression of the stem cells to form muscle fibers and repair 
              muscle damage.<I><sup><a href="#endnote53">53</a></sup></I>  The 
              ability of human bone marrow derived stem cells to form muscle cells 
              and persist in the muscle was recently documented.  In this case, 
              a patient had received a bone marrow transplant at age 1, and developed 
              Duchenne muscular dystrophy at age 12.  Biopsies at age 14 showed 
              donor nuclei integrated within 0.5-0.9% of the muscle fibers of 
              the patient, indicating the ability of donated marrow cells to persist 
              in tissue over long periods of time.<I><sup><a href="#endnote54">54</a></sup></I> 
            </P>
            <P> Bone marrow stem cells have also shown capability at forming kidney 
              cells.  Studies following genetically marked bone marrow stem cells 
              in rats<I><sup><a href="#endnote55">55</a></sup></I> and mice<I><sup><a href="#endnote56">56</a></sup></I> 
              showed that the stem cells could form mesangial cells to repopulate 
              the glomerulus of the kidney.  In the mouse study, formation of 
              cell fusion products was ruled out as a mechanism for differentiation 
              of the bone marrow stem cells.  Other animal studies have shown 
              contribution of bone marrow stem cells to repair of damaged renal 
              tubules in the kidney;<I><sup><a href="#endnote57">57</a></sup></I><SUP>,<I><sup><a href="#endnote58">58</a></sup></I></SUP> 
              taken together, animal studies indicate that bone marrow stem cells 
              can participate in restoring damaged kidney tissue.<I><sup><a href="#endnote59">59</a></sup></I></P>
            <P> Liver was one of the earliest tissues recognized as showing potential 
              contribution to differentiated cells by bone marrow stem cells.  
              Bone marrow stem cells have been induced to form hepatocytes in 
              culture<I><sup><a href="#endnote60">60</a></sup></I> and liver-specific 
              gene expression has been induced <I>in vitro</I> in human bone marrow

              Bone marrow stem cells also repopulated liver after irradiation 
              of mice to destroy their bone marrow.<I><sup><a href="#endnote63">63</a></sup></I>  
              Examination of livers of female patients who had received male bone 
              marrow transplants, and male patients who had received female liver 
              transplants, showed that similar repopulation of liver from bone 
              marrow stem cells could take place in humans.<I><sup><a href="#endnote64">64</a></sup></I>  
              Examination of the kinetics of liver repopulation by bone marrow 
              stem cells in a mouse model indicated that the replacement was slow, 
              with only small numbers of cells replaced by the bone marrow stem 
              cells.<I><sup><a href="#endnote36">65</a></sup></I>  As noted previously, 
              two recent studies have found that replenishment of liver by bone 
              marrow stem cells occurs primarily via cell fusion hybrid formation, 
              even in repair of liver damage.<I><sup><a href="#endnote23">23</a></sup></I>  
              A side-population of stem cells has been identified in mouse liver, 
              similar to that seen in bone marrow.  This hepatic side-population, 
              which contributes to liver regeneration, can be replenished by side-population 
              bone marrow stem cells.<I><sup><a href="#endnote66">66</a></sup></I>

            <P> Pancreas and liver arise from adjacent endoderm during embryological 
              development, and show relatedness in some gene expression and interconversion 
              in some instances.  Bone marrow derived cells have shown the ability 
              to form pancreatic cells in animal studies.  Mouse bone marrow stem 
              cells containing a genetic fluorescent marker that is only expressed 
              if insulin is expressed were transplanted into irradiated female 
              mice.<I><sup><a href="#endnote67">67</a></sup></I><em></em>  Within 
              6 weeks of transplant, fluorescent donor cells were observed in 
              pancreatic islets; donor cells identified in bone marrow and peripheral 
              blood did not show fluorescence.  <I>In vitro</I>, the bone marrow 
              derived cells showed glucose-dependent insulin secretion as well.  
              Bone marrow derived stem cells have also demonstrated the ability

              Mice with experimentally induced hyperglycemia from pancreatic damage 
              were treated with bone marrow derived stem cells expressing the 
              c-kit marker.  Interestingly, only a low percentage of donor cells 
              were identified as integrating into the regenerating pancreas, with 
              most of the regeneration due to induced proliferation and differentiation 
              of endogenous pancreatic cell precursors, suggesting that the bone

              contribute to regeneration of cardiac tissue and improve performance 
              of damaged hearts.  In animal studies, for example, rat<I><sup><a href="#endnote69">69</a></sup></I>,

              stem cells have been identified as integrating into cardiac tissue, 
              forming cardiomyocytes and/or cardiac blood vessels, regenerating 
              infarcted heart tissue, and improving cardiac function.  In mice, 
              bone marrow derived stem cells injected into old animals seems capable 
              of restoring cardiac function,<sup><a href="#endnote1">1</a></sup> 
              apparently through increased activity for cardiac blood vessel formation.  
              One fascinating study using xenogeneic (cross-species) transplants 
              suggests that stromal cells may show immune tolerance by the host.<sup><a href="#endnote76">76</a></sup>  
              Mouse marrow stromal cells were transplanted into fully immunocompetent 
              rats, and contributed formation of cardiomyocytes and cardiac vessels.  
              Even after 13 weeks, the mouse cells were not rejected by the rat 
              hosts.  Evidence has accumulated from postmortem studies that bone 
              marrow stem cells can contribute to cardiomyocytes after damage 
              to the human heart as well.<sup><a href="#endnote77">77, </a></sup><sup><a href="#endnote78">78</a></sup>

              that bone marrow stem cells can contribute as progenitors of lung 
              epithelial tissue<sup><a href="#endnote84">84</a></sup>, and mesenchymal 
              stem cells can home to damaged lung tissue, engraft, and take on 
              an epithelial morphology, participating in repair and reduction 
              of inflammation.<sup><a href="#endnote85">85</a></sup>  Bone marrow

              A recent study in mice has indicated that bone marrow stem cells

            <P> There is abundant evidence that bone marrow stem cells can leave

              of bone marrow stem cells is used to harvest stem cells more easily 
              for various bone marrow stem cell treatments.<sup><a href="#endnote88">88</a></sup>  
              Therefore, it is not surprising that adult stem cells have been 
              isolated from peripheral blood.  Mobilized stem cells in peripheral 
              blood have been administered intravenously in a rat model of stroke, 
              ameliorating some of the behavioral deficits associated with the 
              damaged neural tissue<sup><a href="#endnote89">89</a></sup>, leading

              as a treatment for stroke in humans.<sup><a href="#endnote90">90</a></sup>  
              Mobilized stem cells have also been used in cardiac regeneration

              peripheral blood stem cells exhibiting pluripotent properties can 
              be isolated from unmobilized human blood.  One study showed that 
              the isolated cells were adherent, similar to marrow mesenchymal 
              cells, and could be induced to differentiate into cells from all 
              three primary germ layers, including macrophages, T lymphocytes, 
              epithelial cells, neuronal cells, and liver cells.<sup><a href="#endnote87">91</a></sup>

            <P> One extremely interesting finding of the past few years has been 
              the discovery of neuronal stem cells, indicating that cell replenishment 
              was possible within the brain (something previously considered impossible.)  
              Neuronal stem cells have been isolated from various regions of the

              recently used adult neural stem cells to test potential treatment 
              of multiple sclerosis lesions in the brain.  Using a mouse model 
              of chronic multiple sclerosis-experimental immune encephalitis-they 
              injected neural stem cells either intravenously or intracerebrally 
              into affected mice.  Donor cells entered damaged, demyelinated regions 
              of the brain and differentiated into neuronal cells.  Remyelination 
              of brain lesions and recovery from functional impairment were seen 
              in the mice.  Neural stem cells have also been used to investigate 
              potential treatments for Parkinson's disease.  Using experimentally-lesioned 
              animals as models for Parkinson's disease, human neural stem cells 
              have been observed to integrate and survive for extended periods 
              of time.<sup><a href="#endnote107">107</a></sup>  Dopaminergic cells 
              (the cells degenerated in Parkinson's disease) can be induced in 
              these systems,<sup><a href="#endnote1087">108</a></sup> and neural 
              stem cells are capable of rescuing and preventing the degeneration 
              of endogenous dopaminergic neurons,<sup><a href="#endnote109">109</a></sup><SUP>,<a href="#endnote110">110</a></SUP>also 
              producing improved behavioral performance in the animals.  In these 
              studies, the data suggest that the transplanted neural stem cells 
              did not participate to a large extent in direct formation of dopaminergic 
              neurons, but rather secreted neuroprotective factors and growth 
              factors that stimulated the endogenous neural cells.  In this respect, 
              infusion of transforming growth factor into the brains of Parkinson's 
              mice induced proliferation and differentiation of endogenous neuronal 
              precursors in mouse brain.<sup><a href="#endnote111">111</a></sup>  
              Following this potential for stimulation of endogenous neuronal 
              cells, Gill <I>et al.</I> recently reported on a Phase I trial in 
              which glial derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) was infused into 
              the brains of five Parkinson's patients.<sup><a href="#endnote112">112</a></sup>  
              After one year there was a 61% increase in the activities of daily 
              living score, and an increase in dopamine storage observed in the 
              brain.  In a tantalizing clinical application with direct injection 
              of neural stem cells, a Parkinson's patient was implanted with his 
              own neural stem cells, resulting in an 80% reduction in symptoms 
              at one year after treatment.<sup><a href="#endnote87">113</a></sup> 
              Further clinical trials are underway. </P>
            <P> The olfactory ensheathing glial (OEG) cell from olfactory bulb 
              has been used extensively in studies regarding spinal cord injury 
              and axon regrowth.  Human OEG cells can be expanded in number in 
              culture and induced to produce all three main neural cell types.<sup><a href="#endnote93">93</a></sup>  
              Transplant of the cells into animal models of spinal cord injury 
              has shown that the cells can effect remyelination of demyelinated 
              spinal cord axons,<sup><a href="#endnote114">114</a></sup> and provide 
              functional recovery in paraplegic rats,<sup><a href="#endnote115">115</a></sup> 
              including in transected spinal cords.<sup><a href="#endnote116">116</a></sup>  
              Another study has found that infusion of growth factors such as 
              GDNF can stimulate functional regeneration of sensory axons in adult 
              rat spinal cord.<sup><a href="#endnote117">117</a></sup>  Interestingly, 
              one group has made use of the similarities between enteric glial 
              cells and OEG cells, and shown that transplanted enteric glial cells 
              can also promote regeneration of axons in the spinal cord of adult 
              rats.<sup><a href="#endnote118">118</a></sup>  Clinical trials are 
              underway to test the abilities of OEG cells in spinal cord injury 
              patients.  Finally, a significant impediment to recovery from spinal 
              cord injury is the formation of a glial/astrocyte scar at the site 
              of injury, which can prevent growth of axons no matter what the 
              source of the cells.  Menet <I>et al.</I> have shown, using a mutant 
              mouse model, that much of the scar can be prevented by inhibition 
              of glial fibrillary acidic protein and vimentin.<sup><a href="#endnote119">119</a></sup>  
              In mutant mice that lacked these genes, there was increased sprouting 
              of axons and functional recovery after spinal cord injury.  Thus, 
              endogenous neural cell growth and reconnection might suffice for 
              repair of damage if inhibitory mechanisms can be removed from neural 
              systems. </P>

            <P CLASS="c2"> <strong>ADULT STEM CELL MOBILIZATION FOR TISSUE REPAIR 
              </strong></P>
            <P> An important point to consider as we look ahead regarding utilization 
              of adult stem cells for tissue repair is that it may be unnecessary 
              first to isolate and culture stem cells before injecting them back 
              into a patient to initiate tissue repair.  Rather, it may be easier 
              and preferable to mobilize endogenous stem cells for repair of damaged 
              tissue.  Initial results regarding this possibility have already 
              been seen in some animal experiments, in which bone marrow and peripheral 
              blood stem cells were mobilized with injections of growth factors 
              and participated in repair of heart and stroke damage.<SUP><a href="#endnote72">72</a>,<a href="#endnote89">89</a><a href="#endnote90">,90</a></SUP>  
              The ability to mobilize endogenous stem cells, coupled with natural 
              or perhaps induced targeted homing of the cells to damaged tissue, 
              could greatly facilitate use of adult stem cells in simplified tissue 
              regeneration schemes.<sup><a href="#endnote181">181</a></sup></P>
            <P CLASS="c2"> <strong>GENE THERAPY APPLICATIONS WITH ADULT STEM CELLS 
              </strong> </P>
      Adult stem cells can provide an efficient vehicle for gene therapy applications, 
            and engineered adult stem cells may allow increased functionality, 
            proliferative capacity, or stimulatory capability to these cells.  
            The feasibility of genetically engineering adult stem cells has been 
            shown, for example, in the use of bone marrow stem cells containing 
            stably inserted genes.  The engineered stem cells when injected into 
            mice could still participate in formation and repair of differentiated 
            tissue, such as in lung.<sup><a href="#endnote182">182</a></sup>  
            As another example, engineered stem cells containing an autoantigen, 
            to induce immune tolerance of T cells to insulin-secreting cells, 
            were shown to prevent onset of diabetes in a mouse model of diabetes,<sup><a href="#endnote183">183</a></sup> 
            a strategy that may be useful for various human autoimmune diseases.  
            Introduction of the PDX-1 gene into liver stem cells stimulated differentiation 
            into insulin-producing cells which could normalize glucose levels 
            when transplanted into mice with induced diabetes.<sup><a href="#endnote140">140</a></sup>  
            Simply engineering cells to increase their proliferative capacity 
            can have a significant effect on their utility for tissue engineering 
            and repair.  For example, McKee <I>et al.</I><sup><a href="#endnote184">184</a></sup> 
            engineered human smooth muscle cells by introducing human telomerase, 
            which greatly increased their proliferative capacity beyond the normal 
            lifespan of smooth muscle cells in culture, while allowing retention 
            of their normal smooth muscle characteristics.  These engineered smooth 
            muscle cells were seeded onto biopolymer scaffolds and allowed to 
            grow into smooth muscle layers, then seeded with human umbilical vein 
            endothelial cells.  The resulting engineered arterial vessels could 
            be useful for transplants and bypass surgery.  Similarly, human marrow 
            stromal cells that were engineered with telomerase increased their 
            proliferative capacity significantly, but also showed enhanced ability 
            at stimulating bone formation in experimental animals.<sup><a href="#endnote185">185</a></sup>  
            Genetically-engineered human adult stem cells have already been used 
            in successful treatment of patients with genetic disease.  Bone marrow 
            stem cells, from infants with forms of severe combined immunodeficiency 
            syndrome (SCID), were removed from the patients, a functional gene 
            inserted, and the engineered cells reintroduced to the same patients.  
            The stem cells homed to the bone marrow, engrafted, and corrected 
            the defect.<sup><a href="#endnote186">186</a></sup><SUP>,<a href="#endnote187">187</a>,<a href="#endnote188">188</a></SUP>  
            <P> Adult stem cells could also be used to deliver stimulatory or 
              protective factors to tissues and endogenous stem cells.  This would 
              utilize the innate homing ability of adult stem cells, but would 
              not necessarily rely on differentiation of the stem cells to participate 
              in tissue replenishment.  For example, Benedetti <I>et al.</I> utilized 
              the homing capacity of neural stem cells in brain by engineering 
              mouse neural stem cells with the gene for interleukin-4.  Transfer 
              into brain glioblastomas in mice led to the survival of most of 
              the mice, and imaging analysis documented the progressive disappearance 
              of large tumors.<sup><a href="#endnote189">189</a></sup>  Likewise, 
              engineered mesenchymal stem cells were transplanted into the brains 
              of mice that are a model of Niemann-Pick disease; the enzyme acid 
              sphingomyelinase is lost in the disease, resulting in neurological 
              damage and early death.  The mesenchymal stem cells were engineered 
              to overexpress the missing enzyme.  When injected into brains of 
              the mouse model, the mice showed a delay in onset of neurological 
              abnormalities and an extension of lifespan, suggesting that the 
              stem cells delivered and secreted the necessary enzyme to the brain 
              tissue.<sup><a href="#endnote190">190</a></sup>  Muscle-derived 
              stem cells that were engineered to express the growth factor bone 
              morphogenetic protein-2 were used to stimulate bone healing in mice 
              with skull bone defects.  While the muscle-derived stem cells did 
              show differentiation as bone cells, the results indicated that the 
              critical factor was delivery of the secreted growth factor by the 
              stem cells to the areas of bone damage, allowing much more rapid 
              healing than in control animals.<sup><a href="#endnote191">191</a></sup>  
              As noted previously, neural stem cells show an ability to rescue 
              degenerating neurons, including the dopaminergic neurons whose loss 
              is associated with Parkinson's disease.  The delivery of neuroprotective 
              substances is postulated as the most likely explanation for this 
              phenomenon, rather than substantial differentiation by the injected 
              neural stem cells.<SUP><a href="#endnote109">109</a></SUP>  In support 
              of this hypothesis, when neural stem cells were specifically engineered 
              to overexpress a neurotrophic factor similar to glial derived neurotrophic 
              factor, degeneration of dopaminergic neurons was prevented.<SUP><a href="#endnote110">110</a></SUP></P>
            <P CLASS="c2"> <strong>STIMULATING ENDOGENOUS CELLS</strong> </P>
            <P> The indications from the previous examples suggest that direct 
              stimulation of endogenous stem cells within a tissue may be the 
              easiest, safest, and most efficient way to stimulate tissue regeneration.  
              Such stimulation need not rely on any added stem cells.  This approach 
              would circumvent the need to isolate or grow stem cells in culture, 
              or inject any stem cells into the body, whether the cells were derived 
              from the patient or another source.  Moreover, direct stimulation 
              of endogenous tissue stem cells with specific growth factors might 
              even preclude any need to mobilize stem cells to a site of tissue 
              damage.  A few experimental results suggest that this approach might 
              be possible.  One group has reported that use of glial derived neurotrophic 
              factor and neurotrophin-3 can stimulate regeneration of sensory 
              axons in adult rat spinal cord.<SUP><a href="#endnote117">117</a></SUP>  
              Administration of transforming growth factor to the brains of Parkinson's 
              mice stimulated proliferation and differentiation of endogenous 
              neuronal stem cells and produced therapeutic results in the mice,<SUP><a href="#endnote111">111</a></SUP> 
              and infusion of glial derived neurotrophic factor into the brains 
              of Parkinson's patients resulted in increased dopamine production 
              within the brain and therapeutic benefit to the patients.<SUP><a href="#endnote112">112</a></SUP>  
              And, Zeisberg <I>et al.</I> have found that bone morphogenetic protein-7 
              (BMP-7) can counteract deleterious cell changes associated with 
              tissue damage.  In this latter study, a mouse model of chronic kidney 
              damage was used.  Damage to the tissue causes a transition from 
              epithelial to mesenchymal cell types in the kidney, leading to fibrosis.  
              The transition appears to be initiated by the action of transforming 
              growth factor beta-1 on the tissues, and BMP-7 was shown to counteract 
              this signaling <I>in vitro</I>.  Systemic administration of BMP-7 
              in the mouse model reversed the transition <I>in vivo</I> and led 
              to repair of severely damaged renal tubule epithelial cells.<SUP><a href="#endnote192">192</a></SUP>  
              These experiments indicate that direct stimulation of tissues by 
              the correct growth factors could be sufficient to prevent or repair 
              tissue damage.  The key to such treatments would be identification 
              of the correct stimuli specific to a tissue or cell type. </P>

        In summary, our current knowledge regarding adult stem cells has
        expanded greatly over what was known just a few short years ago. 
        Results from both animal studies and early human clinical trials

        and regeneration of damaged cells and tissues in the body, akin to a

        stimulation to accomplish repair of damage.  The potential of adult
        stem cells to impact medicine in this respect is enormous.
