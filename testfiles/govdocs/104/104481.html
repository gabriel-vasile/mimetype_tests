<h3><a name="anthrax" id="anthrax"></a>Anthrax vaccine </h3>
<h5>Some people should not get anthrax vaccine or should wait.</h5>
<p>Anyone who has had a serious allergic reaction to a previous dose of anthrax vaccine should not get another dose. Anyone who has recovered from cutaneous (skin) anthrax should not get the vaccine. Pregnant women should not be routinely vaccinated with anthrax vaccine. This is merely a precaution. There is no evidence that the vaccine is harmful to either a pregnant woman or her unborn baby. Vaccination may be recommended for pregnant women who have been exposed, or are likely to be exposed, to anthrax. There is no reason to delay childbearing after either the man or the woman gets anthrax vaccine. Vaccines, including anthrax vaccine, are safe to give to breast-feeding women. </p>

<h5>Some children should not get DTaP vaccine or should wait.</h5>
<p>Children with minor illnesses, such as a cold, may be vaccinated. But children who are moderately or severely ill should usually wait until they recover before getting DTaP vaccine.</p>
<p>Any child who had a life-threatening allergic reaction after a dose of DTaP should not get another dose.</p>
<p> Talk with your doctor if your child:</p><ul>
<li>had a seizure or collapsed after a dose of DTaP</li><li>cried non-stop for 3 hours or more after a dose of DTaP
</li>
<li>had a fever of 105 degrees Fahrenheit or higher after a dose of DTaP.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Ask your health care provider for more information. Some of these children should not get another dose of pertussis, but may get a vaccine without pertussis, called DT.</p>
<p>DTaP should not be given to anyone 7 years of age or older.</p>

<h5>Some people should not get hepatitis A vaccine or should wait.</h5>
<p>Anyone who has ever had a severe (life-threatening) allergic reaction to a previous dose of hepatitis A vaccine should not get another dose.</p>
<p>Anyone who has a severe (life threatening) allergy to any vaccine component should not get the vaccine. Tell your doctor if you have any severe allergies. All hepatitis A vaccines contain alum and some hepatitis A vaccines contain 2-phenoxyethanol.</p>

<h5>Some people should not get hepatitis B vaccine or should wait.</h5>
<p>People should not get hepatitis B vaccine if they have ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to baker's yeast (the kind used for making bread) or to a previous dose of hepatitis B vaccine.</p>
<p>People who are moderately or severely ill at the time the shot is scheduled should usually wait until they recover before getting hepatitis B vaccine.</p>

<h3><a name="hpv" id="hpv"></a>HPV (Human Papillomavirus) vaccine</h3>
<h5>Some girls or women should not get H.P.V. vaccine or should wait.</h5>
<p> Anyone who has ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to yeast, to any other component of HPV vaccine, or to a previous dose of HPV. vaccine should not get the vaccine. Tell your doctor if the person getting the vaccine has any severe allergies.</p>
<p> Pregnant women should not get the vaccine. The vaccine appears to be safe for both the mother and the unborn baby, but it is still being studied. Receiving HPV vaccine when pregnant is not a reason to consider terminating the pregnancy. Women who are breast feeding may safely get the vaccine.</p>
<p>Any woman who learns that she was pregnant when she got HPV vaccine is encouraged to call the HPV vaccine in pregnancy registry at 800-986-8999.</p>
<p>Information from this registry will help us learn how pregnant women respond to the vaccine.</p>
<p>People who are mildly ill when the shot is scheduled can still get HPV vaccine. People with moderate or severe illnesses should wait until they recover.</p>

<ul>
<li>Adults 50 years of age or older or children younger than 2 years. <span class="new">UPDATED Nov 2008</span></li><li>People who have long-term health problems with:

<h5>Facts about people who should or should not get the vaccine:</h5>
<ul>
<li>
  <p>Otherwise healthy children who often get ear infections, sinus infections, or other upper respiratory diseases do not need to get PPV because of these conditions.</p></li>
<li>
  <p>PPV may be less effective in some people, especially those with lower resistance to infection. But these people should still be vaccinated, because they are more likely to get seriously ill from pneumococcal disease.</p></li>
<li>Pregnancy: The safety of PPV for pregnant women has not yet been studied. There is no evidence that the vaccine is harmful to either the mother or the fetus, but pregnant women should consult with their doctor before being vaccinated. Women who are at high risk of pneumococcal disease should be vaccinated before becoming pregnant, if possible.</li>

<h3><a name="rabies" id="rabies"></a>Rabies vaccine</h3>
<h5>Talk with a doctor before getting rabies vaccine if you:</h5>
<ol>
<li>ever had a serious (life-threatening) allergic reaction to a previous dose of rabies vaccine, or to any component of the vaccine,</li><li>have a weakened immune system because of:
<ul>

</li><li>cancer, or cancer treatment with radiation or drugs.</li></ol>

<h3><a name="rota" id="rota"></a>Rotavirus vaccine</h3>
<h5>Some children should not get rotavirus vaccine or should wait.</h5>
<p>A child who has had a severe (life-threatening) allergic reaction to a dose of rotavirus vaccine should not get another dose. A child who has a severe (life threatening) allergy to any component of rotavirus vaccine should not get the vaccine. Tell your doctor if your child has any severe allergies that you know of.</p>
<p>Children who are moderately or severely ill at the time the vaccination is scheduled should probably wait until they recover. This includes children who have diarrhea or vomiting. Ask your doctor or nurse. Children with mild illnesses should usually get the vaccine.</p>
<p>Check with your doctor if your child has any ongoing digestive problems.</p>
<p>Check with your doctor if your child's immune system is weakened because of:</p>
<ul>
<li>HIV AIDS, or any other disease that affects the immune system</li><li>treatment with drugs such as long-term steroids
</li><li>cancer, or cancer treatment with x-rays or drugs
</li></ul>
<p>Check with your doctor if your child recently had a blood transfusion or received any other blood product (such as immune globulin).</p>
<p>In the late 1990s a different type of rotavirus vaccine was used. This vaccine was found to be associated with an uncommon type of bowel obstruction called "intussusception," and was taken off the market.</p>
<p>The new rotavirus vaccine has been tested with more than 70,000 children and has not been associated with intussusception.</p>
<p>However, once a person has had intussusception, from any cause, they are at higher risk for getting it again. So as a precaution, it is suggested that if a child has had intussusception they should not get rotavirus vaccine.</p>

<h5>Some people should not get Yellow Fever vaccine.</h5>
<p>Persons who have ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to eggs, chicken, gelatin or to a previous yellow fever vaccine.</p>

  <p>If you cannot get the vaccine because of a medical reason and proof of yellow fever vaccination is required for your travel, your doctor can give you a waiver letter. When planning to use a waiver letter, you should also obtain specific advice from the embassy of the country or countries you plan to visit.</p>
  <p>If you cannot get the vaccine, discuss with your doctor other ways to prevent yellow fever.</p>
