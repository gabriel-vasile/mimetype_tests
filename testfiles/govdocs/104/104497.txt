Spengler and colleagues (1981) collected respirable suspended
particulate samples in 55 homes in six cities. The average concentra-
tions observed between May 1977 and April 1978 are shown in Table
16. The quantity of tobacco smoked was not reported, nor was the
number of hours each smoker spent in the home. The researchers
concluded that the mean WP levels increased by 20 pg/ms per
smoker.
Dockery and Spengler (1981) further analyzed these data and
considered the number of cigarettes smoked in the home. They
concluded that the mean RSP concentration increased by 0.88 w/ma

164


for every cigarette smoked per day in the house. A one-pack-a+lay
smoker in the home thus raises indoor respirable particulate leveE,
by 17.6 w/ma. Air conditioning increased the contribution of each
cigarette by 1.26 w/ma, to a total of 2.11 Clg/ms per cigarette in fully
air-conditioned homes. These values are annual averages; a&ond&
tioned homes, in which air is recirculated during the warmer
months, have higher levels.
Repace and Lowrey (1989) measured RSP concentration using a
piexobalance in several public and private lo&ioris, imh&g
restaurants, cocktail lounges, and halls, in both the presence and the
absence of Bmoking. They then developed an empirical model
utilizing the mass-balance equation. Using both measured and
estimated parameters as input to the model, they validated the
model for predicting an individual's exposure to the RSP constituent
of HIS. The model takes the form: C, = 666 D./n,; where C&equals
the equilibrium concentration of the RSP component of ETS @g/m"),
D. equals the density of active smokers (number of burning cigarettes
per 100 ma), and nv equals the ventilation rate (in air changes per
hour). The ventilation rate is a complex parameter that takes into
account all the room-specific constants affecting the removal of HIS,
such aa ventilation, decay, and mixing.
Measurements in a large number of locations using measures of
smoke generation such as the number of people smoking or the
number of cigarettes being smoked have shown a definite relation-
ship of smoke generation to particulate levels. First (1964) cautioned
again& the use of RSP measurements a~ a measure of El% in public
places because of its nonspecificity for ETS, and noted that other
~ouroes may contribute enough to the levels to invalidate the
determination of the ETS contribution. However, there are few other
sources of RSP in most U.S. homes, and therefore, the relationships
of RSP measurements to HIS levels are generally quite accurate in
this setting.
Nicotine appears to be a promising tracer for ETS because of its
specificity for tobacco and its presence in relatively high concentra-
tions in tobacco smoke. It can also be measured in biological fluids to
provide an indication of acute exposure to tobacco smoke. Cotinine,
nicotine's major metabolite, can be used as an indicator of more
chronic exposure. These biological markers are discussed in a
separate chapter of this Report. Recent studies have indicated that
nicotine may be p rimarily associated with the vapor phase of HI'S
and therefore not a surrogate for the particulate phase as once
thought (Eudy et al. 1986). However, the possible useftiess of this
compound in estimating exposure to EXS warrants further evalu-
ation. The nicotine content of side&ream smoke does not differ
significantly from brand to brand when normalized on a per gram of
tobacco basis (Rickert et al. 1984). The use of nicotine as a marker for


ETS must also give consideration to its loss to surfaces and its
subsequent revolatilization and readmission to the room volume.

Carbon monoxide, a marker for gas phase components, has been
measured extensively as a surrogate for FYI'S There are many
sources of carbon monoxide other than cigarettes, indoors (e.g.,
stoves, grills) and outdoors (e.g., automobile). This nonspecificity for
ETS seriously limits its usefulness for environmental measurements.

In summary, no single compound definitively characterizes an
individual's exposure to ETS. Additional research is currently under
way to quantify the relationships among various constituents and
ETS levels. Because of the complex nature of RTS, investigators may
need to measure several markers or to separately record source
variables (such as number of cigarettes smoked) in order to estimate
exposure to ETS.

Monitoring Studies

Personal monitors can measure the concentrations of ETS in an
individual's breathing zone. Personal monitoring is preferable to
area monitoring because it integrates the temporal and spatial
dimensions of an individual's exposures. At the present time, all of
the studies that have used personal monitors to measure RTS
constituents have utilized active samplers that provide integrated
exposures over differing time periods.

The markers assessed in personal monitoring studies have the
same lack of specificity found in area monitoring studies. However,
in many of the personal monitoring studies, time-activity diaries
were kept to permit greater resolution in attributing exposure to
specific sources.

In Topeka, Kansas, 45 nonsmoking adults carried personal RSP
monitors for 18 days, and area monitors were placed inside and
outside their homes (Spengler and To&son 1981). The indoor RSP
levels were consistently higher than outdoor levels, and the personal
exposures levels were higher than either. The group was divided into
those who reported ETS exposure and those who did not (Figure 3).
Reported exposure to ETS clearly shifts the distribution to the right.
On the average, reported ETS exposure increased an individual's
personal concentration by 20 pg/m3.

Personal RSP monitors were carried by 101 nonsmoking volun-
teers for 3 days in Kingston-Harriman, Tennessee (Spengler et al.
1985). The study population was divided into two groups: those who
lived with a smoker and those who did not. ETS exposure was
reported by 28 of the participants, with the remaining participants
reporting none. The RSP distribution for the ambient samples is
shown in Figure 4. Clearly, exposure to ETS significantly increases
an individual's personal concentration profile.

Sexton and colleagues (1984) monitored personal RSP exposure for
48 nonsmokers in Waterbury, V&mont, every other day for 2 weeks.
The participanta kept activity logs and had simultaneous indoor and
outdoor FC3P samples collected at their homes. The proportion of
time individuals spent exposed to EX'S was the single most important
determinant of their personal exposure. Volunteers who reported
greater than 120 minutes of exposure to ETS had a mean RSP
exposure of 50.1 M/ma, whereas those volunteers who reported no
exposure to EXS had a mean exposure of 31.7 w/m'.

Ni&&, a tobacco-specific compound, should make an excellent
tracer for ETS if its usage can be properly validated. Some
considerations in its usage are detailed in the section on area
sampling. Currently, no published reports are available that utihm
this compound for the type of detailed personal monitoring studies
carried out for PSP. However, a lightweight personal nicotine
monitor has recently been developed (Muramatsu et al. 1994) that
may aid this type of research. The researchers measured average
nicotine concentrations ranging from 9.0 &ma in a hospital lobby to
38.7 H/m3 in a conference room and 47.7 &ma in an automobile,
No information on the duration of exposure or representativeness of
these levels to the general population was given. However, this study
does provide information as to the range of exposures an individual
may encounter and demonstrates that high nicotine levels can be
encountered in various settings. It will be necessary to quantify the
relationship between nicotine, a vapor phase component of El!& and
other components of interest such as RSP in order to fully utilize t&s
tracer.
Chtain organic gasa have been measured as possible indicators of
EZ'S exposure or of specific effects such as irritation. These include
formaldehyde and acrolem Weber and F'ischer 1980) and aromatic
compounds such as benzene, toluene, xylene, and styrene (Higgins et
al. 1983). The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's recent TEAM
study utilized personal monitors, employing Tenax carkidges, to
develop profiles of individual exposures to volatile organics (Wallace

168


st al. m press). The TEAM study has found significantly increased
exposure to benzene for individuals exposed to E!lS. Again, the
xoxspecificity of these materials for `ET'S limits their applicabi&.
()tber materials such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen &oxide
have heen measured in personal monitoring studies attempting to
sss.sss individuals' exposure to ETS. Their nonspecificity and lack of
sensitivity for low-level ETS exposure make them inappropriate for
pop~ation-based StUdies.
persald monitoring techniques are currently available that will
&cw the assessment of individual exposures to various components
of E'l'S. Although not widely used in the past, they can provide
&u&le input in developing exposure models and in vaM&ing
other monitoring schemes. Their usefulness is primarily that they
sample all of the microenvironments in which individuals find
t&mselves and therefore automatically compensate for the nonurn-
form temporal and spatial distributions of ETS that affect individual
exposure profiles.

Conclusions

1. Undiluted sidestream smoke is characterized by significantly
higher concentrations of many of the toxic and carcinogenic
compounds found in mainstream smoke, including ammonia,
volatile amines, volatile nitrosamines, certain nicotine decom-
position products, and aromatic amines.
2. Environmental tobacco smoke can be a substantial contributor
to the level of indoor air pollution concentrations of respirahle
particles, benzene, acrolein, N-nitrosamine, pyrene, and carbon
monoxide. ETS is the only source of nicotine and some N-
nitrosamine compounds in the general environment.
3. Measured exposures to respirable suspended particulates are
higher for nonsmokers who report exposure to environmental
tobacco smoke. Exposures to JTI'S occur widely in the non-
smoking population.
4. The small particle size of environmental tobacco smoke places
it in the diffusion-controlled regime of movement in air for
deposition and removal mechanisms. Because these submicron
particles will follow air streams, convective currents will
dominate and the distribution of El% will occur rapidly
through the volume of a room. As a result, the simple
separation of smokers and nonsmokers within the same
airspace may reduce, but will not eliminate, exposure to ETS.
5. It has been demonstrated that El% has resulted in elevated
respirable suspended particulate levels in enclosed places.
