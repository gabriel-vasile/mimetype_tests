                  <p>This morning, June the 6th, 2003, we have the pleasure of interviewing Keith K. Kearnes, 520 Colony Drive, Salem, Indiana, date of birth, January the 27th, 1925. My name is Pat McLain. I'm on the staff of U.S. Senator Richard Lugar. With me is Gertrude Stephenson, the Washington County Coordinator for the Veteran's History Project, and also with me is Ryan Randall, an intern for the Jeffersonville office of the United States Senator Lugar. Mr. -- Mr. Kearnes, can you tell us about your time in World War II, when you first went into the military and where you went for your training, that sort of thing?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Keith K. Kearnes</speaker>
                  <p>I first went to Fort Harrison, of course, and then from there, I was sent to Fort Tellen, Long Island in the coast artillery. Well, Walter Winchell got on there one Sunday night and said we was setting up there twiddling our thumbs and doing nothing. Of course, we was walking beach patrol and freezing to death. Anyhow, the next Thursday I wound up in Camp Rucker, Alabama, the whole unit did, practically, became field artillery. And we went through several months training and wound up in Fort Sill, Oklahoma as an officer's candidate, firing for the officer's candidates. And from there we went to Camp Chaffee, Arkansas, prepared our equipment for overseas.</p>
                  <p>To back up a little bit, we never got our ?agent's? ___ until we got to Fort Sill. All of our training was on the old 155 Snidow, which was a World War I gun. And we moved those to Fort -- to Camp Chaffee, took them to ordinance, serviced them, cosmolined them, prepared them for overseas shipment, which took about a month, really, and put them on the train and con -- went to Camp Kilmer, from there to the port of embarkation.</p>
                  <p>We followed them in a -- I went overseas in an old British cargo ship. They was using it for transport of troops. No bunks, sleep on the floor, picnic tables were in -- anyhow, we got there safely, and I -- I believe it was Southampton we docked, went out into the country in a little military camp and waited for our equipment.</p>
                  <p>Well, our equipment got sank in the channel. So we were shipped on the ?Dea France? which was a first attempt for an invasion in World War II in that town. It was quite a town, on the cliffed, I can never understand why they picked that town, but not being in the know of all, they had a reason, I guess. Anyhow, it failed. So we was there for probably six weeks. Our equipment got sank in the channel. They raised it back up. We finally got it -- how I know this is because each gun has a gun book. It's like a diary. Every shot that's fired is entered in it, and everything that happens to that piece is entered in the gun book. It says completely submerged under sea water.</p>
                  <p> Well, of course, with all that cosmoline stuff on them that it wasn't hurt. And it takes about ten days to clean them back up, get all that stuff off and get them ready to go. Well, we got them ready to go, and we headed out for Belgium. We got about halfway across to Belgium and they turned us around. Of course, we didn't know the difference. They say go, you go. Went back to Saint Lazare Lorien, France, which was a submarine pan for the Germans.</p>
                  <p>And we set back about ten mile from the -- the coast. Our guns had a -- pouchers rather, had about an eleven- to twelve-mile range, and we blasted them. ____ pinned up, so to speak. And then they pulled us out of there and sent us back, and we got about -- we was still in France. They turned us around and sent us right back. And, you know, it was just a few days and the war was over. As the French say, "La guerre est finit."</p>
                  <p>And we went up there and took those submarine people prisoner and had them for probably ten days, and then they were taken to some big camp somewhere. Anyhow, wound up in Cologne, Germany, which was a site for the sore eye. It was -- wasn't too much left, only the name. And, of course, the Rhine river was there and the bridge was blowed out, and we crossed the river on them pontoons with our equipment, which is kind of -- you hope you know how to swim.</p>
                  <p>Anyhow, we made it, and we stayed there for probably five or six months, and then we wound up in Regensburg, Germany, which is down about twenty-five miles from Czechoslovakia, southern Germany. And they said would you go into Japan, so we started the process of training again, shooting and maintaining and what have you, and then all at once, of course, the war was over in Japan, which was a happy day for everybody.</p>
                  <p>I will always praise President Truman for using that big A. He ended it. We finally broke up, and I was transferred to a tank battalion somewhere up in Germany. I don't know where it was now. But anyhow, we come back to Straubing, which was -- was a prison where ____ Goering and some of them others were prisoned. We pulled -- I pulled guard two days there. And then back to Regensburg I went with this tank battalion, was there about a week and got transferred back to Straubing into another unit and was there about a month, I guess, maybe six weeks, and I alone got transferred out, didn't know a soul, and was sent in this ____ company, which is a hair raiser.</p>
                  <p>My school days I took mechanical drawing, so I got to be the topographical draftsman for the unit. It was made up of infantry, Air Force, Marines, British, a little bit of everything. And, of course, there would be a few fights. My outfit was better than yours and all that, which was kid stuff, but anyhow, young people do things that they wouldn't do when they're older.</p>
                  <p>And what we had was disinterring teams and we had search parties. A search party consisted of three, and they had a three-quarter ton. You'd go out and get the mayor, the burgermeister of these towns. He usually knowed where stuff was at. And they'd come back, and I'd plot them on the map, ____ for him and plot them on the map and put a note of information down there, and then the search -- the disinterring team would go out.</p>
                  <p>Well, of course, they'd try to get the biggest notches in town to do the digging, remove the bodies, and they'd bring them back in. We had a morgue. And guys wore long gloves to their shoulders digging around to see was any corpses. They'd come in ____ and down these just like --</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Patricia H. McClain</speaker>
                  <p>Oh, goodness.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Keith K. Kearnes</speaker>
                  <p>Quite frankly, they kept us about half lit up. The first thing they done was having a -- set up a tavern. And I didn't understand them guys. I didn't need it, but them guys were digging down there searching and identification and what have you, they needed something.</p>
                  <p>Anyhow, we was in Effingham, I believe it was, and I got a little too tipsy one day and we was just -- our tavern was about 21 steps outside, and I slid down them on my bottom and wound up in ?Work burgner? hospital because I had strained myself. Anyhow, when I got out of the hospital, they just turn you loose to go to your outfit. Well, when I got there, they wasn't there.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Patricia H. McClain</speaker>
                  <p>Oh, my goodness. What did you do?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Keith K. Kearnes</speaker>
                  <p>They moved. And, of course, over there you walk around and they didn't -- it's ____+ than they have now in Salem on the street at night. The war was over, it was over. Them people wouldn't let them people over there now. It wasn't a religious war. That's what it is now.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Patricia H. McClain</speaker>
                  <p>Yeah.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Keith K. Kearnes</speaker>
                  <p>In my opinion. This guy was mail, in a mail truck. I asked him if he knowed where we was at. He said I don't know the name of the outfit, you know, but get in, I'm going up the road. And we got up there about forty mile, there they was. And they never informed me or nothing.</p>
                  <p>Anyhow, I got back with them. We had a disinterring deal in -- in Wurstburg, thirty-eight bodies. It ____+ to get here. Come time for my release, and the captain says you want to be a Sergeant, hang around for as little as three months, and I said no thanks. So I -- I was there in the repple depple [replacement depot] out there, didn't know a soul, and was just -- they didn't know of any them. But anyhow, when I got called back into service, they said boy, you been in more outfits than anybody I ever seen. I ____+ maybe two and three outfits a day. You move around and they'd train you, you know, and you never even knowed it.</p>
                  <p>Well, we got to the ____ mill where the -- where the Mercedes is made. I can't think of the name of it now. And worked at the symphony. Of course, we just walked in and no ticket and -- and they wanted to throw us out, but we stayed.</p>
                  <p>And ever since that day, I've been a symphony lover. I can't stand hillbilly music. For an old country boy, that's rare. Anyhow, stayed there two or three days and got on a poop train and headed for France. Boxcars, ____ and if they wanted to build a fire, just build a fire in the floor of the boxcar and burn a hole over there, just move over.</p>
                  <p>Some of -- we had one boy was a Russian Jew. He was a American soldier, but he was a Russian Jew. And he was a stamp collector. And anything there he thought was his. So when I got separated from him in France at -- ____ Lucky Strikes was it's -- it's awful to get old. That town where they invaded France ____ Lucky Strikes was there ____ and I got on a boat, tonsillitis.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Patricia H. McClain</speaker>
                  <p>Oh, goodness.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Keith K. Kearnes</speaker>
                  <p>Come back in the 50 ship, Gainesville 50, Gainesville, Ohio, where the kids put scratch ____ and stuff and you get the ship's name. I was in sick bay all the way back. ____ Camp Atterbury or from ____ New Jersey to Camp Kilmer again.</p>
                  <p>The automobiles was -- was buzzing everywhere, you know. Quite a sight. Comfort. And wound back up at Camp Atterbury, and I tried to get them to take my tonsils out, and they wouldn't do it. So he sent me home for three days and said come back, and I went back and they still wouldn't take them out, but it was better. They discharged me, and I headed back to -- at that time, I -- I was still in Hillsdale. My wife was there. I got married while I was in the service. And got a job. I'd walk about three miles to catch an old school bus to ride to Collinsville to do this job.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Patricia H. McClain</speaker>
                  <p>What was your job?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Keith K. Kearnes</speaker>
                  <p>I was a carpenter's helper at Donnelly Printing Press.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Patricia H. McClain</speaker>
                  <p>Okay.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Keith K. Kearnes</speaker>
                  <p>And the union got into it, but everybody had to be a union. Well, didn't everybody want to be union, you know. So they went on strike, and there I was on the other side of the building directing dump trucks, and we was on strike, and I didn't even know it. Finally a guy on the bus come got me, says you going to ride home with us? He said they're on strike, you ain't supposed to be working. I didn't know. So my lunch bucket was in there. I never did get it. They wouldn't let me go get it. I never went back. I said I don't have to put up with this kind of -- and I fooled around in Marion County a while and there wasn't too much to do, and I wound up in Phoenix, Arizona, which I wish I was still there. Oh, it was beautiful out there.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Patricia H. McClain</speaker>
                  <p>Yeah, it is.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Keith K. Kearnes</speaker>
                  <p>But there wasn't any work much, you know. But I got a job in a lumberyard unloading railroad cars, cement, and lumber, me and another guy. And then that job ____ they got where they release lumber, and then I guess it moved out so fast they didn't need nobody. Anyhow, I got laid off. I went to Cottonwood, Arizona. That's up in the neighborhood where Senator McCain lives. He lives in Sedona.</p>
                  <p>And at the time, Sedona, they was shooting movies out there, and the little burg of Sedona wasn't nothing but an old hand pump filling station. That's all that was there, except beautiful mountains and what have you, pretty river valley and what have you. I went over there to try to get a job, and they -- I worked one day, and they said it's all over, movie's shot. Anyhow, I went back and I got another job in a lumberyard there in Cottonwood, and they were Mormon people, good people. The fellow I was working for, every time you'd say something he'd go ha ha ha ha. Pretty soon it gets on your nerves, you know. But they were good people.</p>
                  <p>And finally I just said one day I'm going to go to Idaho. My wife got the ?old oval bed? we had in the house. Idaho we went. Didn't know -- I had an uncle up there, but I didn't -- he would be a total stranger to me, and I never seen him after I got up there. And I worked for Mallory ?Maize's? Sugar. And the ____ potatoes and ____. It's a big outfit. He was hauling sugar beets in there. Well, of course, the sugar ration was still on, so what they was doing, they was burning pulp, getting it to where the syrup was dark, they was feeding -- they had big cattle pens there. Every day they'd move them cattle to another pen. They was eating the beets.</p>

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Keith K. Kearnes</speaker>
                  <p>I ____+ efforts and I made a mistake by joining the re -- reenlisting in the reserves.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Patricia H. McClain</speaker>
                  <p>I see.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Keith K. Kearnes</speaker>
                  <p>My enlistment had run out, but President Truman said you're going anyhow. And when I got back into the service, I was the only soul in the outfit that had ever been in the heavy artillery, officers and all included. Well, we went back to Camp Rucker, Alabama. Well, I went in the artilleries at Camp Rucker. We went back to camp Rucker ____. Wasn't a soul down there but us and rattlesnakes. We ____+ was chasing the snakes out, I guess. Go from one area to another beating the weeds down. And I was belted in the same ____ I was in World War II. Same area, same ____. Anyhow, we did a little artillery training there, and we started getting recruits. There was about 140 enlisted men, ER, reserves. We started getting fellers, recruits, and then we went from there to Camp Polk, Louisiana, which is a fort now. And Rucker's a fort, too. Took our training and -- and me being the only person in the heavy artillery during World War II, I was just a cannoneer, but ____. I could tear that ____ down today on that ____. And anyhow, I went up the ranks pretty fast. I was a Corporal in World War II. I had officers in training, Colonel right on down, and most of all, I'd pay attention just like they used to do, you know. And they'd ha ha ha. It was all in -- in fun. But Colonel Shafer, he was -- what's the ____+ over there. We got along good and got the fellers in, went to Camp Polk and trained. Swamp -- Louisiana's got swamps up on top of the hills and big guns. It started out to be an armored camp, and all them thick cement roads and stuff, but after you got on the road, them tanks buried them ____. And we buried some of them guns. Started training there, and we come -- what's the name of the camp? I can't think of it now. Prepared for overseas, wound up in California. Camp Kilmer, California, was there about a week and hit the boat, headed out. And this time we didn't have to do nothing about loading equipment. It was all taken care of by civilians, I guess. Wound up in Pusan. Actually, Yokohama, Japan, down through Japan. I went -- had a training break in -- where did that first A bomb lit?</p>

                  <speaker>Ryan Randall</speaker>
                  <p>Nagasaki?</p>

                  <speaker>Patricia H. McClain</speaker>
                  <p>Or Hiroshima?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Keith K. Kearnes</speaker>
                  <p>Hiroshima. We was there about an hour, I guess. Wasn't -- old steel buildings twisted, you know, they -- the training all -- the training sessions all had them little rough things you walk under. Now, they were intact. But the rest of the town was pretty well -- it was in -- in the valley and the lake out there. If it hasn't been for that lake, it would took ground and all, that bomb. ____+ bomb ____+. And we went from there up to an Air Force base, a small Air Force base in Korea. There we got all of our equipment. And then we convoyed up -- mostly up river beds because there wasn't roads enough where they -- well, there we had ____+ tractors ____ pulling them guns.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Patricia H. McClain</speaker>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Keith K. Kearnes</speaker>
                  <p>And a lot of times it was in the river beds. The rivers wasn't like the Ohio by any means. Some of them wasn't much bigger than the creek through town here. But the vegetation was all gone, trees all -- just so much schrapnel and stuff, I guess. We wound up Coosaw area, which was not too far from Heartbreak Ridge, and the battalion split up. I never did see any of the other guys while we was there. A, C, I was in the A battery, and we was at the right flank and then B battery and then C battery, and we was in rice paddies, and every night by 10:00 o'clock it was freeze -- you'd freeze to death and snow ten inches deep, and by 10:00 o'clock the next day, you was walking in mud to your knees.</p>

                  <p>I never seen such changing climates so quick. Anyhow, there was dead Chinese laying along the road and what have you and nobody ____+. Terrible. They didn't pick up their -- and we had roving guns they called them, to go out and pull up mountains that had to get where they could reach over there further. We were headed -- in the ____+ we were ahead of the ____+. So we'd get up there -- we'd ____ the beach, the hill, and lob them right over the hill where -- where 105's more like a rifle, great projective. And I reserved 1st of November to about the 1st of May. And we had some infiltration, not much like ____. In back of us was a ?Hum din? outfit. When they go on patrol, they yell and scream and sing in their lingo, and I always thought you was supposed to be quiet.</p>

                  <p>And I guess they was scaring the enemy away. Anyhow, they come through once in a while. And we had big, old squad tents set up with kerosene heaters, and I was a chief ____ by then, and me and the artillery mechanic had a little round tent ____+. Walk right out of our door and was a Korean cemetery. And they bury their people sitting up, you know, in mounds. Anyhow, we was told not to disturb the -- dig in, but don't disturb that, so we didn't. Wasn't allowed to cut a tree if they wanted you to make barricades around your equipment. We finally got a bags and fill them with dirt. And these roving guns would go out, and I went on the first one. And I said boys, you used to say how come you're so tough on us. I said getting you ready for over here. Now it's yours. So I didn't go on the roving guns no more.</p>

                  <p>They didn't need me anyhow. And at the time I left Korea, we only had one casualty. ____+ the lanyard and fired the -- and he didn't get out of the way. He didn't stand to the side, and the recoil got him. And he didn't suffer. It was all over right quick. But after I left, sometime later they tell me that in that last ____ the Chinese made, they overrun them, and several of the boys that I had in basic training got killed. They have a reunion every year and keep everybody informed.</p>

On my way back, they was four of us, me from A battery and one from headquarters and one from Charlie and one from Server.
