      <abstract>
        CMDL Global Flask Sample Surface Methane is historical
digital data set DSI-3272 archived at the National Climatic Data
Center (NCDC). The data set contains data from 38 stations around the
world with varying periods of data. The data period is 1983-1991, with
some stations having less than that. The data set is historical and
has a format similar but not identical to the one in use at CMDL today.
The format is not the element type format that is standard for the NCDC
DS-32xx family of data sets. No data has been added since the 1991 data
year. Air samples were analyzed by the Climate Monitoring and
Diagnostics Laboratory (CMDL), which is at present part of the Office
of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (OAR) of the US National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and were provided to NCDC. The
major parameters are the station identifier, methane (CH4) mixing ratio
in parts per billion (ppb) and the date and time that the samples were
obtained

        Positions 1-3: Station ID		                                          
This is a 3-character alphanumeric representing station identifier assigned 
by CMDL.  Allowable values are listed under topic STATION:  Network 
participation, along with station name and other identifier information.                             
                                                              
Positions 5-12: Collection Date                                               
This is an 8-character integer representing the Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) 
date (year, month, day) that the flask sample was   collected at the 
cooperative station.  Allowable values range  from 83 01 01 to 91 12 31.                                    
                                                              
Positions 14-15: Collection Hour                                               
This is a 2-character integer representing the GMT hour that the sample was 
collected at the cooperative station.  Allowable values are 00 to 23 and 99, 
where 99 represents a missing value.
                                                      
Positions 17-18: Collection Minute                                     
This is a 2-character integer representing the GMT minute that the sample was 
collected at the cooperative station.  Allowable values are 00 to 59 and 99, 
where 99 represents a missing value.
                                                      
Positions 20-26: CH4 concentration                                     
This is a 7-character real number representing the methane mixing ratio in 
parts per billion (ppb = parts in a 10*9 volume of the air sample). An 
example of a value for this field is 1551.98 ppb.                    
                                                     
Positions 28-35: Flask ID                                              
This is an 8-character alphanumeric representing the flask-id assigned to 
each flask.  The code may be used to aid in combining the methane 
measurement data with carbon dioxide data obtained from the same flask. 
The Flask ID and Collection Data and Time uniquely identify each flask 
observation.             
                                                      
Position 37: Collection Method                                     
This is a 1-character alphanumeric representing the method that was used in 
collecting the flask sample.  Allowable values are:         
            
P - Portable, battery-powered suitcase sampler.  Two flasks normally 
connected in series, flushed with air, and then pressurized to 1.25-1.5 
ambient atmospheric pressure.                            
                                                      
T - Filling of an evacuated 3-liter glass flask by opening the single O-ring 
sealed stopcock           
                                                      
S - Filling of 0.5 liter glass flasks (in pairs) at the NOAA/CMDL observatory 
sites.  Flasks are filled and pressurized by diverting air from continuous in 
situ CO2 analysis systems.                 
                                                    
N - Filling and pressurizing of 0.5 liter glass flasks (in pairs) by a pump 
different from that supplied by NOAA/CMDL (used with collection method P).  
In most cases (eg. at NWR and CGO) the pump is a Metal Bellows pump.  In 
addition, the flasks filled by this method at the Cape Grim Baseline Air 
Pollution Station (site code CGO) are filled with air that has been dried 
chemically. 
                          
F - Filling of an evacuated 5-liter glass flask by opening the single ground-
glass greased stopcock.   
                                                      
Positions 39-46: Analysis Date                                         
This is an 8-character integer representing the (local Boulder, CO time) date 
(year, month, day) that the flask sample was analyzed at CMDL.  Allowable 
values range from 83 01 01 to 91 12 31. 
                                                                                            
Position 49: Quality Flag                                          
This is a 1-character alphanumeric representing the corresponding  quality 
flag assigned to each methane mixing ratio.  Allowable values are:                                           
                                                      
blank	an absence of a flag (or a blank) indicates the sample and measurement 
were consider acceptable
                                                      
+ samples in which CMDL believed to be non-background                             
* samples with an obvious problem during sample collection or analysis.
