<p>Cyclone and anticyclone activity in the spring and summer of 1998 appeared 
to be nearly normal in the number of systems and their movement when compared 
to the few other studies of the Arctic. An El-Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) 
was occurring which probably contributed to the rapid melting of the Arctic
Ocean ice in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas. Qualitatively, the regression of
the ice northward was among the largest seen in the region. Yet, the cyclone
activity appeared to conform to expectations, as best as it is known by the
study of Serreze et al. (1996). The tracks and movements of the cyclone and
anticyclones revealed many erratic features which are common in the area. These
synoptic systems came from all directions. They generally followed the eastward
and northeastward directions of the Serreze et al. (1996) climatology. But they
did not always obey the general eastward propagation of Rossby wave systems
found at lower latitudes. Most of the northeastward propagating cyclones were
originally part of the Aleutian Low in the Bering Sea. The other cyclones and
anticyclones developed and decayed in an erratic, nature not conforming to any
climatological pattern. The large anticyclone  developed in the lower Beaufort
Sea in July as predicted by climatology and dominated the area. But the daily
analysis of it showed a wide variety of changes in intensity, location, and
shape which affected the weather at the Ice Camp to its west. Arctic synoptic
systems are more complicated than their relatives in lower latitudes.</p> 

<p>Air temperatures rose from the winter-like conditions (-15&deg to -20&deg
C) in early April to the freezing/thawing point at the end of May and remained
close to this point through July. This too appears to conform to
climatological norms.</p> 

<p>Air trajectories were generally from the south and southeast. Some previous
studies predicted that more air masses could be traced back to Europe and
Russia. These cases were few in the April-July 1998 period. If air pollution
sources are found in these data, they most likely will be in eastern Siberia,
Alaska, or western Canada because most of the air entering the Arctic during
the four months of FIRE/ACE came from these regions.</p>

<p>Clouds appeared to follow climatological norms. The SHEBA Ship Ice Camp was
located where southerly flow is very common because of the anticyclone in the
Beaufort Sea and the cyclonic activity to the west of it. The southerly flow
brought moisture forming clouds at all levels. Boundary layer Arctic stratus
usually occurred with other clouds above in June and July. The Wisconsin HIRS
analysis indicates higher frequencies of clouds above 400 hPa (7 km) than
normally found in the month of July 1998. In the other months, cloud statistics
are reasonably close to the other climatologies.</p>

<p>Model analysis and forecast statistics indicate skill in the NCEP MRF model
predictions out to three days. This success is surprising considering the lack
of data for the model at high latitudes and the complicated and erratic
movement of the synoptic systems.</p>
