GAO Highlights: 

Highlights of GAO-09-146, a report to congressional requesters. 

Why GAO Did This Study: 

The tax filing season is when the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has 
most of its contacts with taxpayers, answering questions and processing 
returns and refunds. The 2008 filing season was particularly 
challenging due to the unanticipated mandate to make economic stimulus 
payments. The filing season is also the start of IRS’s efforts to 
ensure the newly filed returns are compliant with the tax laws. GAO was 
asked to assess IRS's performance, describe the costs and foregone 
revenue of administering the economic stimulus payments, and identify 
any opportunities for improving filing season compliance checks. GAO 
analyzed IRS performance data, reviewed IRS operations, and interviewed 
IRS officials. 

What GAO Found: 

IRS successfully processed 150 million returns and issued 105 million 
refunds for $246 billion as of September 12, 2008. In addition, IRS 
issued 116 million stimulus payments totaling $94 billion. However, 
taxpayers’ access to IRS’s telephone assistors was substantially lower 
than last year because of an unanticipated increase in telephone call 
volume. Calls to IRS more than doubled to 118 million as many taxpayers 
had questions about the amount of their stimulus payment or its timing. 
IRS acted to answer the calls including shifting hundreds of staff from 
collection cases to telephone assistance. IRS took other actions such 
as adding features to its Web site that answered stimulus-related 
questions and likely diverted some calls. Regardless, taxpayers’ 
ability to get through to IRS telephone assistors declined from about 
81 percent of waiting callers getting through last year to about 57 
percent from January through June 30 of this year. 

IRS expects the costs and foregone revenue associated with issuing the 
economic stimulus package (ESP) payments to reach about $960 million, 
of which $655 million is revenue foregone due to the shift of 
collections staff to telephone service. 

There are two areas where IRS does not use its current legal authority 
to automatically correct errors when processing tax returns. One 
involves eligibility for the child and dependent care credit by 
taxpayers who are “Married Filing Separately.” Taxpayers in this filing 
status are not eligible for the credit, but IRS allows the credit to be 
claimed, issues refunds, and then audits taxpayers to try to recover 
the money. The second is that IRS does not use its existing legislative 
authority to verify earned income tax credit claims by noncustodial 
parents—in 2006, $91 million of claims were unverified. IRS has plans 
to study one option for verifying these claims, but is not planning to 
study another option, combining federal data on noncustodial parents 
and other taxpayer characteristics to automatically determine 
eligibility. Finally, there are two areas where IRS lacks legal 
authority, but has the technical ability to use automated error checks. 
IRS could prevent (1) individuals from deducting contributions to 
individual retirement accounts above the allowable limit and (2) 
individuals from violating the age requirements for such contributions.

What GAO Recommends: 

GAO recommendations include that IRS use its existing legal authority 
to correct child and dependent care credit claims on returns filed 
using “Married Filing Separately,” and study the effectiveness of 
combining data on noncustodial parents and other taxpayer 
characteristics to verify earned income tax credit claims. 

In response, the IRS Deputy Commissioner agreed with our 
recommendations and outlined the actions that IRS would take. 

GAO suggests that the Congress provide IRS with legal authority to 
automatically correct returns for individual retirement account 
contributions that violate the dollar or age limits. IRS supported our 
suggestion.

Effective and timely taxpayer service and enforcement programs, working 
together, can provide faster refunds, reduce the burden on taxpayers of 
complying with tax laws, help identify and correct errors before 
interest is owed by the taxpayer, and help to ensure that taxpayers 
receive tax benefits for which they are eligible. The filing season is 
when most taxpayers interact with the agency and perhaps is the 
Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) best opportunity to combine service 
and enforcement.[Footnote 1] 

Filing season services include processing individual income tax returns 
and refunds and providing taxpayer services through telephone, Web 
site, and face-to-face assistance. In previous reports and testimonies, 
we said that IRS has made significant progress improving taxpayer 
service since the passage of the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 
1998.[Footnote 2] A significant challenge for IRS during the 2008 
filing season was the passage of the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008, 
which mandated that IRS send stimulus payments to over 100 million 
households.[Footnote 3] 

During the filing season, enforcement begins with IRS's math error 
program, where IRS uses its computers to identify errors such as 
calculation mistakes or omitted or inconsistent entries. Where 
possible, IRS uses its math error authority (MEA) to correct certain 
errors before interest is owed by the taxpayer, to provide faster 
refunds and to help ensure that taxpayers receive tax credits for which 
they are eligible.[Footnote 4] 

In light of the importance of IRS's performance during the tax filing 
season, you asked us to (1) assess IRS's performance relative to goals 
and prior years' performance, including identifying factors that affect 
performance such as the economic stimulus package (ESP); (2) describe 
IRS's time frames and planned versus actual costs, including foregone 
revenue, associated with the passage and implementation of ESP 
legislation; and (3) identify opportunities, if any, for improving 
compliance by expanding MEA. We provided testimony on IRS's 2008 
interim performance before the Subcommittee on Financial Services and 
General Government, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate, on April 
16, 2008, and the Subcommittee on Oversight, Committee on Ways and 
Means, House of Representatives, on June 19, 2008; we also issued a 
report to the Subcommittee on Oversight, Committee on Ways and Means, 
House of Representatives, on March 13, 2008.[Footnote 5] 

We based our assessment on the results and analyses of IRS data and 
reports, workload and performance information, observations of IRS's 
operations, interviews with IRS officials, information from 
representatives of some of the larger tax preparation companies and 
professional associations that represent preparers providing tax 
assistance, and reports by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax 
Administration (TIGTA). We conducted this performance audit from 
January through October 2008, in accordance with generally accepted 
government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and 
perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide 
a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit 
objectives. We assessed the reliability of data used in this report by 
(1) performing electronic testing of required data elements, (2) 
reviewing existing information about the data and the system that 
produced them, and (3) interviewing agency officials knowledgeable 
about the data. We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable 
for the purpose of this report. More detail on our scope and 
methodology can be found in the scope and methodology section. 

Results in Brief: 

Even with the significant new workload associated with ESP, IRS 
delivered a generally successful filing season--with one key exception-
-access to telephone assistors. As of September 12, 2008, IRS had 
processed 150 million individual income tax returns, including almost 9 
million ESP-only tax returns from people who would not otherwise have 
to file a return. In addition, IRS processed 105 million tax refunds 
totaling $246 billion, plus 116 million stimulus payments totaling $94 
billion. However, taxpayers' access to IRS's telephone assistors was 
substantially lower than last year. As of June 30, 2008, call volume 
more than doubled to over 118 million calls largely due to taxpayers 
with ESP-related questions. According to IRS officials, the call volume 
strained telephone resources and contributed to a significant decline 
in access to live telephone assistance, especially beginning in early 
May. As a result, many people waited longer, were disconnected, or 
abandoned their calls before reaching an IRS assistor. On a positive 
note, the accuracy of the telephone assistors' responses to tax law and 
account questions continued to be above 90 percent. Further, IRS 
provided ESP information and tools on its Web site that significantly 
increased its use and likely diverted some taxpayer questions from the 
telephones to the Web site. 

IRS expects the costs and foregone revenue associated with 
implementation of ESP to reach up to $960 million--$305 million in 
costs plus $655 million in foregone revenue. Foregone revenue results 
from IRS's decision to shift hundreds of staff from collection cases to 
telephone assistance. Because of the timing of ESP, IRS did not have 
time to hire, conduct background checks, and train additional staff to 
handle the increased telephone volume. According to officials, IRS 
mitigated the cost of implementing ESP by working with national 
organizations such as AARP to help with the outreach to the population 
of retirees, disabled veterans, and low-wage workers who usually are 
exempt from filing a tax return, but were eligible for stimulus 
payments. IRS estimates that 82 percent of this population participated 
in ESP, which is better than participation rates for some other benefit 
programs, such as the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). IRS plans to 
issue a report on ESP to document lessons learned in December, 2008. 

We identified two areas where IRS could expand the use of its existing 
MEA and two other areas where authority would be useful if granted. In 
one area, by not using its existing MEA to verify a taxpayer's "Married 
Filing Separately" filing status for eligibility for the child and 
dependent care credit, IRS may create financial difficulties for up to 
several thousand taxpayers who, as a result of an audit, may find that 
they have to repay the credit, plus penalties and interest. Although 
taxpayers in this filing status are not eligible for the credit, IRS 
allows the credit to be claimed, issues refunds, and then audits 
taxpayers to try to recover the money. Further, IRS could use its 
authority to notify taxpayers of a possible change in their filing 
status that would make them eligible for the credit. The second area 
that IRS does not use its existing MEA is to verify EITC claims by 
noncustodial parents--in 2006, $91 million of such claims were 
unverified. IRS has plans to study one option for verifying these 
claims, but is not planning to study another option, combining data 
from the Federal Registry of Child Support Orders (FCR) database on non-
custodial parents and other taxpayer characteristics to automatically 
determine eligibility. In addition, there are two areas where IRS lacks 
legal authority, but has the technical ability to use automated error 
checks during returns processing. The first would be to prevent 
individuals from deducting contributions to individual retirement 
accounts above the allowable limit. These taxpayers incorrectly claim 
the amount intended for people over 50 making IRA "catch-up" 
contributions.[Footnote 6] The second would prevent individuals from 
violating the 70 ½ age limitation for making these contributions. 

We are making recommendations that the Commissioner of Internal Revenue 
to direct the appropriate officials to: 

1. use IRS's existing MEA to identify and correct child and dependent 
care credit claims on "Married Filing Separately" returns; 

2. include information on math error notices to inform taxpayers that 
they may be eligible for the child and dependent care credit if they 
file under a different status, such as "Single," "Married Filing 
Jointly," "Head of Household," or "Qualifying Widow(er) with a 
dependent child;" and: 

3. assess the effectiveness of combining FCR and other data on taxpayer 
characteristics to verify the eligibility of EITC claims from 
noncustodial parents. 

This report includes two matters for congressional consideration--to 
provide IRS with the authority to use math error checks to identify and 
correct ineligible (1) individual retirement account (IRA) "catch-up" 
contributions, and (2) contributions to IRAs from taxpayers over age 70-
1/2. 

In commenting on a draft of this report, the IRS Deputy Commissioner 
agreed with our recommendations and outlined IRS's actions to address 
those recommendations (see app. I). With respect to the matters for 
congressional consideration, she supported both suggestions and stated 
that they could further increase compliance and improve taxpayer 
service. 

Scope and Methodology: 

To assess IRS's 2008 filing season performance in the key filing season 
activities compared to goals and past performance, report on the effect 
of ESP, and highlight areas where IRS could expand use of MEA, we: 

* reviewed and analyzed IRS reports, testimonies, budget submissions, 
and other documents and data, including workload data, data related to 
IRS's performance measures and goals, and data on taxpayer usage of 
services and other statistics such as the number of paid preparers; 

* observed operations at IRS's Atlanta, Georgia, paper submission 
processing center, the Atlanta call site, the Joint Operations Center 
(which manages IRS's telephone services) in Atlanta, and IRS's walk-in 
locations in Atlanta and Baltimore, Maryland, and selected these 
offices for a variety of reasons, including the location of key IRS 
managers, such as those responsible for telephone and walk-in site 
services; 

* tested for statistically significant differences between annual 
performance measures based on IRS sample data; 

* analyzed staffing data for paper and electronic filing, and telephone 
assistance; 

* reviewed information from organizations, such as Keynote Systems, 
which evaluate Internet performance; 

* interviewed representatives of some of the larger private and 
nonprofit organizations that prepare tax returns, such as H&R Block, 
and trade organizations that represent both individual paid preparers, 
tax preparation companies, and professional associations, including the 
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants; 

* reviewed TIGTA reports and interviewed TIGTA officials about IRS's 
performance and initiatives; 

* interviewed IRS officials about current operations, performance 
relative to 2008 performance goals and prior filing season performance, 
trends, significant factors, and initiatives that affected or were 
intended to improve performance, monitoring, and oversight of paid tax 
preparers; 

* reviewed IRS data on math errors, information on IRS's process for 
identifying and correcting math errors, legislation providing IRS with 
math error authority; 

* interviewed IRS officials, including those from the EITC office, 
about MEA; 

* reviewed reports on MEA from the National Taxpayer Advocate (NTA) and 
TIGTA; and: 

* reviewed our prior reports and followed up on our recommendations 
made in those reports. 

This report discusses numerous filing season performance measures and 
data that cover the quality, accessibility, and timeliness of IRS's 
services. We assessed the reliability of data used in this report by 
(1) performing electronic testing of required data elements, (2) 
reviewing existing information about the data and the system that 
produced them, and (3) interviewing agency officials knowledgeable 
about the data. We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable 
for the purpose of this report. To the extent possible, we corroborated 
information from interviews with documentation and data and where not 
possible, we attribute the information to IRS officials. We reviewed 
IRS documentation, interviewed IRS officials about computer systems and 
data limitations, and compared those results to our standards of data 
reliability.[Footnote 7] Data limitations are discussed where 
appropriate. We conducted our work primarily at IRS headquarters in 
Washington, D.C., walk-in sites offices at Baltimore, Maryland, the 
Wage and Investment Division headquarters and walk-in sites in Atlanta, 
Georgia. 

Background: 

IRS's filing season is an enormous and critical undertaking and 
consists of two primary activities, processing well over 100 million 
individual income tax returns and refunds and providing millions of 
taxpayers with telephone, Web site, and face-to-face assistance. The 
following describes the processing of tax returns. 

* Most taxpayers file their individual income tax returns 
electronically, although millions still mail paper returns. Electronic 
filing is faster, which allows taxpayers to receive refunds faster, and 
is less prone to transcription and other errors, and provides IRS with 
significant cost savings. 

* Taxpayers below an income ceiling can access the Free File program 
offered through IRS's Web site by a consortium of 19 tax preparation 
companies that offer free on-line tax preparation and filing services 
for qualifying taxpayers. 

* IRS continues to develop and deliver a number of Business Systems 
Modernization programs, including releases of the Customer Account Data 
Engine (CADE). CADE is intended to eventually replace IRS's antiquated 
Master File legacy processing system and facilitates faster refund 
processing and provides IRS with more up-to-date account information. 

IRS provides a variety of taxpayer services, including the following. 

* IRS has toll-free assistance telephone lines which taxpayers can call 
with questions about tax law or their refunds. Depending on how 
taxpayers respond to menu choices, questions are answered by automated 
messages or calls are routed to telephone assistors located at 24 call 
sites around the country. 

* IRS offers assistance through its Web site, including "Where's My 
Refund?", which enables taxpayers to use the Web site to determine 
whether the agency received their tax returns and processed their 
refunds. Taxpayers can also download forms, instructions, and 
publications, research their own tax law issues through Frequently 
Asked Questions or Tax Topics, and receive help with specific tax law 
questions and procedural questions via e-mail. 

* IRS offers assistance at nearly 12,000 volunteer sites, which helps 
IRS serve traditionally underserved taxpayer segments, including 
elderly, low-income, and disabled taxpayers, and taxpayers with limited-
English proficiency. Additionally, IRS has 401 walk-in sites where 
taxpayers can receive basic tax law and account assistance from IRS 
staff and have returns prepared if their annual income is $40,000 or 
less.[Footnote 8] 

In addition to depending on IRS, taxpayers depend heavily on paid tax 
return preparers or commercial tax preparation software during the 
filing season. Paid preparers are a critical part of the nation's tax 
administration system because of the wide variety of assistance they 
offer taxpayers, including help understanding tax obligations, return 
preparation and electronic filing, and providing forms and 
publications. In 2007, 59 percent of individual taxpayers had their 
return prepared and filed by paid preparers and about 16 percent 
prepared their return using commercial tax preparation software. 

Late tax law changes create filing season challenges for IRS. This can 
be particularly true if, like ESP, the changes are complex and 
significantly increase filing season workload (for a detailed 
description of IRS's implementation of ESP, see app. II). ESP contained 
complex rules about eligibility, amount of the rebate, and filing 
requirements. 

Over the years, the Congress granted IRS legal authority to cover 11 
areas so that the agency could correct return errors during processing, 
including calculation errors and entries that are inconsistent or 
exceed statutory limits, without having to issue the taxpayer a 
statutory notice of deficiency (see app. III for further details on the 
MEA process and authorities). We have reported that prompt compliance 
checks such as these are important because as unpaid taxes age, the 
likelihood of collecting all or part of the amount owed decreases, due 
in part to continued accrual of interest and penalties on the 
outstanding federal taxes.[Footnote 9] MEA also provides a taxpayer 
service as it allows taxpayers to receive their refunds faster, 
corrects return errors before interest is accrued, and can avoid time 
consuming interaction with IRS while the error is being resolved. 

MEA can also help ensure taxpayers receive the tax benefits for which 
they are eligible. For example, between tax years 2003 and 2006, using 
its MEA, IRS identified over 500,000 occurrences of taxpayers under- 
claiming the EITC with the result that an additional $130 million was 
provided to those claimants. Without MEA, most of these errors would 
not likely have been identified and thousands of low income taxpayers 
would likely have received less than they were entitled. 

Because math error checks are automated and require little contact with 
taxpayers, they provide IRS with an enforcement tool that is low cost 
and less intrusive and burdensome to taxpayers than audits. By using 
its MEA, IRS reported preventing $460 million from reaching ineligible 
taxpayers in fiscal year 2006. 

The NTA--who heads the program that helps resolve taxpayers' tax 
problems with IRS and recommends changes to mitigate taxpayer problems-
-noted some concerns about IRS's use of MEA in its 2006 report to 
Congress.[Footnote 10] NTA reported that, because MEA allows IRS to 
summarily assess the tax before a taxpayer has the opportunity to 
challenge the assessment, it should be used in specific and narrow 
circumstances. Because taxpayer rights are different under MEA, NTA 
expressed concern that math error notices did not provide enough detail 
for the recipient to understand what had occurred, their rights, and 
how they could request abatement. NTA also reported that IRS was using 
math error checks in some limited areas where it was not clear that IRS 
had the authority. In its response to the NTA's 2006 report, IRS 
reported that it resolved the issues raised by NTA. While the NTA 
acknowledges that the IRS has made significant improvements to the math 
error notice process, it still notes that IRS could improve how it is 
administering MEA. 

Despite the Increased Volume of Tax Returns Due to the Economic 
Stimulus, IRS's Filing Season was Successful Compared to Previous 
Years' with the Exception of Access to Telephone Assistance: 

As of September 12, 2008, IRS processed 150 million individual income 
tax returns, including almost 9 million ESP-only returns, and processed 
105 million tax refunds totaling $246 billion. IRS processed 16 million 
Form 1040As on paper, a 92 percent increase from last filing season, 
largely due to ESP. According to IRS officials, this increase was 
especially burdensome not only because paper processing is more labor- 
intensive and expensive then electronic processing, but also because 
claimants made many errors on ESP-only returns, which IRS had to 
manually correct. As of September 12, IRS had processed 116 million 
stimulus payments totaling almost $94 billion. 

As shown in table 1, the percentage of electronically filed returns is 
similar to last year's when ESP-only returns are included. Excluding 
the almost 9 million ESP-only returns, most of which were filed on 
paper, the number of taxpayers who filed electronically increased from 
59 percent to 62 percent of total returns.

[End of table] 

The increase in electronic filing is due, in part, to the Free File 
program. The number of taxpayers who filed electronically through Free 
File increased 24 percent, after a 2 percent decline in participation 
last year, to 3.8 million. According to IRS officials, this increase is 
due to greater taxpayer awareness and enhanced marketing. 

As of August 8, CADE posted 30.5 million returns, slightly exceeding 
IRS's goal of 30 million and significantly up from the 11 million 
returns CADE posted as of last year. As we have previously reported, a 
major benefit of CADE is that direct deposit refunds are issued by CADE 
1 to 5 business days faster than the current legacy system, and paper 
check refunds are issued 4 to 8 business days faster because CADE posts 
information daily.[Footnote 11] CADE also was successful in processing 
24 million stimulus payments and contributed to IRS's early 
distribution of some stimulus payments. ESP-only payments processed 
through CADE, rather than the legacy Master file, were issued up to 4 
days earlier than the first scheduled disbursement date. 

Despite the additional volume, IRS met or exceeded goals for seven out 
of eight of the processing measures (see app. IV for details). The one 
measure where performance was significantly below IRS's goal and last 
year's level was the refund error rate, i.e., the percentage of refunds 
with IRS-cause errors issued to taxpayers by IRS. According to IRS 
officials, this performance was due to a programming change and did not 
delay the processing of returns or refunds. 

We have previously reported that IRS's ability to maintain or improve 
taxpayer service will likely depend on its continued ability to find 
efficiencies, particularly through increased electronic 
filing.[Footnote 12] Consistent with this approach, IRS released the 
"Advancing E-File Study" in November 2008, which is the foundation for 
the agency's strategy and planned actions to reach the congressionally- 
set goal of 80 percent of individual returns filed 
electronically.[Footnote 13] 

In recent reports, we suggested two options for increasing electronic 
filing or reducing paper processing. One would be for Congress to 
mandate electronic filing by large paid tax return preparers.[Footnote 
14] Currently, many returns prepared by preparers on computers are 
printed and mailed to IRS, which then have to be transcribed. Our other 
option is to require bar coding on paper returns that were prepared by 
taxpayers using commercial tax preparation software. Bar coding would 
eliminate IRS's transcription costs and errors.[Footnote 15] IRS agreed 
to study this recommendation. 

Paid preparers prepared over 81 million returns, which was 59 percent 
of all individual tax returns in the 2007 filing season. Because IRS 
has limited ability to identify paid preparers and match them with the 
returns they prepared, we recently reported that IRS has limited 
information about the accuracy of these returns and recommended that 
IRS develop a plan to require a single identification number for paid 
preparers, which could facilitate research on paid preparers' influence 
on taxpayer compliance.[Footnote 16] IRS agreed to explore the use of a 
single identification number to enhance IRS's ability to identify paid 
preparers. 

Telephone Performance Was Substantially Lower Compared to Last Year's 
Due to the High Volume of Stimulus-Related Calls, with the Greatest 
Downturn Beginning in Early May: 

Taxpayers' access to IRS's telephone assistors was substantially lower 
than last year's because, according to IRS, it received an 
unprecedented number of calls primarily due to ESP-related questions. 
As table 2 shows, through June 30 of this year, IRS received over 118 
million calls, more than double the total number of calls from last 
year. However, compared to last year, more than twice as many callers 
abandoned their calls and nearly 10 times as many were disconnected by 
IRS.

[End of table] 

On the basis of its experience with the stimulus rebates in 2001 and 
2003, IRS took steps to facilitate telephone service, including 
establishing a dedicated toll-free Rebate Hotline for callers with ESP- 
related questions in February. As of June 30, IRS answered 37 million 
calls made to its Rebate Hotline. However, the unprecedented call 
volume strained IRS telephone resources and contributed to a 
significant decline in the telephone level of service. Calls to IRS 
spiked in the first three weeks of May around the same time that the 
first rounds of stimulus checks were issued (see fig. 1). According to 
IRS officials, taxpayers' confusion over when they would receive their 
payment, or how much they received contributed to the high call volume. 
During these weeks, the percentage of callers waiting for an assistor 
and getting through fell below 50 percent and subsequently did not 
surpass that mark.

The increased call volume also contributed to a decline in related 
performance indicators and measures. As previously noted, the number of 
callers who received busy signals or were disconnected from IRS 
increased as did the caller abandon rate. Further, as shown in table 3, 
the average speed of answer--the length of time taxpayers wait to get 
their calls answered--nearly doubled from last year.

[End of table] 

In addition to the Rebate Hotline, service on other toll-free lines, 
such as tax law and account assistance, was affected as well. For 
example, IRS estimated that from early May, when IRS began issuing ESP 
payments, through the end of June about 30 percent of callers to other 
toll-free lines asked ESP-related questions in addition to their 
primary question. When the caller asked an ESP-related question, the 
assistor was instructed not to transfer the caller to the rebate 
hotline, but instead to answer the question. As a result, the level of 
service on some other telephone applications not related to the Rebate 
Hotline also declined this year, according to IRS officials. 

Even with the increased volume of calls, the accuracy of the telephone 
assistors' responses to tax law and account questions was comparable to 
the same time period last year and met IRS's goals (see table 4). Since 
2005, IRS has maintained a level of accuracy of about 90 percent.

[End of table] 

During the course of our filing season work, we identified some 
opportunities to reduce ESP-related calls. On May 21, 2008, we sent a 
letter to the IRS Commissioner that suggested four options for his 
consideration. IRS implemented three of the four options. IRS re- 
ordered the Frequently Asked Questions page on IRS's Web site to put 
the most common questions addressed by assistors first. IRS added text 
to the payment schedule page on its Web site and a message for 
telephone assistors that provided more detail as to when various types 
of taxpayers should expect to receive their refunds. IRS modified the 
Rebate Hotline script to include an automated "Most Frequently Asked 
Questions" (FAQs) option by adding the FAQs to the automated messaging 
in the call waiting queue. The option IRS did not implement was to 
expand outreach efforts in the press about the timing and calculation 
of stimulus payments. IRS officials concluded that this information 
might unintentionally create more calls. Although we believe that 
additional and more accurate outreach would have been useful for 
reducing public confusion, we acknowledge IRS's position that many of 
the calls have required specific explanations that could not have been 
handled in mass public outreach. 

IRS Provided Tools through its Web Site That Significantly Increased 
Use and Potentially Diverted Calls: 

IRS provided tools and information through its Web site on ESP and 
adjusted the information quickly. For example, on the day the 
legislation was passed, IRS posted information on [hyperlink, 
http://www.IRS.gov] with details about ESP. Within a month, IRS 
launched the Stimulus Payment Calculator. IRS also provided a "Where's 
My Stimulus Payment?" feature, launched May 1, 2008 (see app. II for 
more details on ESP timeline). 

These ESP-related features resulted in a dramatic increase in the 
volume of taxpayer visits, as shown in table 5; visits to IRS's Web 
site increased 74 percent; however, if taxpayer visits to ESP-related 
features were excluded, visits were slightly down from last year.

[End of table] 

Although difficult to quantify, considering the large number of visits 
to ESP-related features on IRS's Web site, it is likely that ESP 
information and features on [hyperlink, http://www.IRS.gov] provided 
sufficient information to divert taxpayers' questions from IRS's Rebate 
Hotline. 

One measure of the quality of IRS's Web site is its ranking in the 
Keynote Systems top 40 government Web sites. During the 2008 filing 
season, [hyperlink, http://www.IRS.gov] ranked first or second in 
response time out of the top 40 government Web sites in the Keynote 
Government Index weekly ratings, compared to ranging between third and 
sixth place last filing season.[Footnote 17] 

Taxpayer Usage Increased at Volunteer Sites, and although IRS is Making 
Limited Progress Assessing Quality, Tax Law Quality Declined at Walk-in 
Sites: 

Volunteer partners prepared 3.2 million returns, which is a 31 percent 
increase compared to last year, with virtually the same number of 
sites. IRS officials attribute this growth mainly to increased word-of- 
mouth promotion of sites and ESP outreach efforts of volunteer 
partners. In contrast, the total number of taxpayer contacts at IRS's 
401 walk-in sites declined slightly in the 2008 filing season compared 
to previous years. 

In order to assess the quality of the assistance at volunteer sites, 
IRS conducts mystery shopping, site, and tax return reviews.[Footnote 
18] This filing season, IRS officials conducted 85 mystery shopping 
reviews for which the accuracy rate for return preparation averaged 75 
percent at volunteer sites. While this is an improvement from last 
year, we are still concerned that, because of the low number of mystery 
shopping reviews conducted, the quality of volunteer-prepared returns 
remains largely unknown and information as a whole is unavailable. 

IRS is in the process of improving how it measures the efficacy of its 
outreach efforts. In response to our recommendation, IRS has hired a 
contractor to conduct surveys and focus groups to assess the IRS 
partners', such as the AARP, ability to reach their target populations, 
e.g., the elderly and limited English proficiency and rural 
populations, and measure the effectiveness and quality of that 
outreach.[Footnote 19] 

In response to another one of our recommendations, to further improve 
its quality assessment at walk-in sites, IRS has expanded contact 
recording--a system IRS uses to record and assess the quality of other 
interactions between its employees and taxpayers--at walk-in sessions 
to include return preparation.[Footnote 20] According to IRS officials, 
the agency hired adequate staff to review the recorded sessions, which 
are considerably longer for return preparation assistance than for tax 
law or account assistance. Further, IRS officials report that by the 
start of the 2009 filing season, contact recording of return 
preparation will be operational at 306 sites. 

The accuracy of account assistance at IRS walk-in sites was 85 percent, 
similar to last year. However, the accuracy of tax law assistance 
declined significantly to 68 percent, down from 80 percent last year. 
According to IRS officials, this decline was, in part, due to the 
timing for hiring and training hundreds of new staff, which was 
dependent on when IRS received funding. Further, those staff had to be 
trained on a new IRS's interactive tax law assistance guide at the 
beginning of the filing season. IRS officials expect tax law accuracy 
to improve for the 2009 filing season as walk-in site staff gain 
experience with the new guide. 

The Costs and Foregone Revenue Associated with Implementing ESP Are 
Expected to Reach over $900 Million and IRS Plans to Document Lessons 
Learned: 

Based on IRS data, the estimated costs and foregone revenue of 
implementing ESP will reach up to $960 million. This includes $202 
million IRS received in a supplemental appropriation in fiscal year 
2008, plus funding transferred from the Financial Management Service 
and IRS's user fee accounts (see table 6).[Footnote 21] Because IRS 
anticipates the need for continued funding associated with the 
implementation of ESP, it requested an amendment to its fiscal year 
2009 budget to receive an additional $68 million, $29 million of which 
it has already received under a continuing resolution. This funding 
would be used, in part, to cover telephone demand, which IRS expects to 
remain well above normal in 2009 due in part to ESP.

[End of table] 

Because of the timing of ESP, IRS officials said that they did not have 
time to hire, conduct background checks on, and train additional staff 
to handle the increased telephone volume. Instead, IRS shifted hundreds 
of Automated Collection System (ACS) staff to answer calls to the 
Rebate Hotline from March through August 2008. 

As of August, IRS reported $655 million in foregone revenue because of 
ACS staff being taken off their collections work to answer the 
unprecedented volume of calls related to ESP. As we previously 
reported, IRS considered alternatives to shifting ACS staff, including 
contracting out, using other staff, or using Social Security 
Administration (SSA) staff, but decided the alternatives were not 
feasible.[Footnote 22] According to IRS officials, while IRS expected 
some foregone revenue and paper backlog associated with the use of 
collections and other staff, it determined that delivering and 
supporting ESP was its highest priority, after the filing season. 

According to IRS officials, volunteer partners helped IRS mitigate the 
costs of delivering ESP to the targeted population of benefits 
recipients. These partners played a key role in funding and carrying 
out outreach to inform targeted groups, e.g., elderly, limited English 
proficiency, disabled, about their eligibility for the economic 
stimulus. For example, AARP supplied economic stimulus information on 
its Web site and in its monthly bulletin, and IRS officials reported 
that AARP paid for one of the mailings to people over 65 who may have 
been eligible for a stimulus payment, but had not yet filed a tax 
return. According to IRS officials, partly because of the efforts of 
the volunteer partners, 82 percent of the targeted individuals eligible 
for the economic stimulus participated in the program. This level of 
participation is relatively high compared to some other programs. For 
example, we have previously reported that participation rates in 
entitlement programs generally range from about 47 percent for the Food 
Stamp Program, to 75 percent for the EITC program.[Footnote 23] 

Consistent with best practices for government organizations, IRS is 
compiling a report on ESP that will summarize the costs to implement 
ESP and the effects on filing season operations. IRS is working to 
verify the cost information associated with ESP. As part of its report, 
IRS hired a contractor to conduct a lessons-learned study, which is due 
to be issued in December 2008. 

IRS Does Not Fully Use Its Existing MEA and Congressional Expansion of 
MEA in Two New Areas Could Enhance Enforcement at Low Cost: 

IRS has authority to disallow child and dependent credit claims on 
returns with the filing status of "Married Filing Separately;" however, 
if taxpayers use this filing status, they would not be eligible for the 
credit. Under IRS's procedures, it processes all returns with child and 
dependent care claims and issues refunds as appropriate. IRS then 
audits the taxpayer who made the claims using "Married Filing 
Separately" as appropriate. IRS audited about 6,000 of these cases in 
2005. After verifying the claim is ineligible, IRS would be left trying 
to collect the money from taxpayers, who may have spent the money and 
now owe back taxes, plus penalties and interest. For lower-income 
taxpayers, this may represent a substantial financial burden. 

Some taxpayers claiming child and dependent care credits may file as 
"Married Filing Separately" by mistake. They could be eligible for the 
credit if they file using a different status, such as "Single," 
"Married Filing Jointly," "Head of Household," or "Qualifying Widow(er) 
with a Dependent Child. Using audits to correct such mistakes is labor 
intensive for IRS. IRS officials confirmed that, if IRS used its MEA in 
these cases, then it could inform the taxpayer of their potential 
eligibility in the associated math error notices. 

A second area where IRS has MEA but does not use it is to disallow EITC 
clams is when taxpayers are listed as the noncustodial parent in the 
FCR. Noncustodial parents are generally ineligible for EITC, because in 
most but not all cases, the child[ren] have not lived with the 
noncustodial parent for more than the required 6 months of the tax year 
to meet EITC eligibility.[Footnote 24] According to EITC officials, IRS 
does not use its MEA in these cases because the child may have lived 
with the non-custodial parent for more than 6 months, meeting the 
residency requirements for eligibility; however, the FCR may not 
reflect this living arrangement. Instead of using its MEA, IRS audits 
less than 2 percent of these cases; however, it does not audit more 
cases because audits are labor intensive. As a consequence, most of the 
more than 41,000 claims for $91 million in 2006 by noncustodial parents 
were allowed without verification. IRS does not know how many of these 
claims were incorrect, but for the claims it audited, the error rate 
was about 91 percent of claims for 2006.[Footnote 25] 

IRS officials reported that, as part of their 2009 EITC Research Plan, 
they plan to review the reliability and applicability of linking the 
custodial information in the FCR to EITC eligibility. They stated that 
if the FCR is found to be sufficiently reliable, IRS could use its MEA 
to automatically identify and correct ineligible EITC claims. 

By focusing on FCR data alone, IRS's review may be missing another way 
to use MEA to verify EITC claims by noncustodial parents and minimize 
the chance of disallowing eligible claims. IRS could combine FCR data 
with factors it currently uses to select returns for audits, factors 
such as taxpayer characteristics like filing status. In a limited 
sample of returns from tax year 2006, audit data show that the FCR 
combined with audit selection factors such as filing status allowed IRS 
to accurately identify ineligible EITC claims by noncustodial parents 
in 98 percent of cases. Without including a more thorough assessment of 
this approach in its FCR review, IRS will not know the extent to which 
more accurate eligibility decisions could be made. Because the agency 
has MEA to use the FCR, the agency does not need additional authority 
to use FCR together with the audit selection factors. 

Two Areas Where IRS Could Use Math Error Checks, but Would Need 
Legislative Authority: 

We identified two areas related to IRA contributions where IRS 
officials reported that they have the technical ability to accurately 
identify and correct math errors and did so as recently as 2006. 
However, at that time, IRS Chief Counsel determined that the Congress 
would need to grant IRS additional MEA to use age-based information to 
automatically disallow certain ineligible IRA contributions and thus 
IRS discontinued the use of math error checks in these areas. 

First, some taxpayers under the age of 50 claim IRA contribution 
amounts that are more than allowed. These taxpayers incorrectly claim 
the amount intended for people over 50 making IRA "catch-up" 
contributions. In 2004, IRS identified 24,000 incidences of these IRA 
contribution overclaims resulting in $23.2 million in underreported 
taxes. IRS used age data from the SSA database to check for age 
eligibility of these contributions. IRS counsel determined that the 
agency does not have MEA to use age-based data in this manner, although 
IRS has and does use age data from the SSA database for other math 
error types, such as EITC eligibility. 

Second, some taxpayers over the age of 70-½ claim contributions to a 
traditional IRA, which they are not entitled to make. By law, taxpayers 
over the age of 70-½ cannot make contributions to traditional IRAs. 
TIGTA found that in 2006, 1,826 taxpayers over the age of 70-½ 
improperly claimed $4 million in IRA deductions for an estimated loss 
of revenue of $601,000. IRS used age data from the SSA database to 
check for age eligibility of these contributions. IRS officials believe 
that this problem is likely to become significantly larger as the 
population ages. However, IRS currently lacks MEA to identify and 
correct ineligible claims. 

Conclusion: 

Despite the challenges of the economic stimulus program, IRS was 
generally successful providing service to taxpayers during the 2008 
filing season. The major exception was telephone service, where the 
large, unanticipated increase in call volume caused by ESP 
significantly affected performance. 

Although IRS focuses on taxpayer service during the filing season, it 
also uses MEA to conduct important compliance checks while processing 
tax returns. There are two areas where IRS could use its existing 
authority more fully and where the agency could improve service through 
notices informing taxpayers of potential eligibility for child and 
dependent care credits. With additional MEA, IRS could further increase 
compliance, improve taxpayer service, and gain additional efficiencies. 

Recommendations for Executive Action: 

We recommend that the Commissioner of Internal Revenue direct the 
appropriate officials to: 

(1) use IRS's existing MEA to identify and correct child and dependent 
care credit claims on "Married Filing Separately" returns; 

(2) include information on math error notices to inform taxpayers that 
they may be eligible for the child and dependent care credit if they 
file under a different status, such as "Single," "Married Filing 
Jointly," "Head of Household," or "Qualifying Widow(er) with a 
dependent child"; and: 

(3) assess the effectiveness of combining FCR and other data on 
taxpayer characteristics to verify the eligibility of EITC claims from 
noncustodial parents. 

Matters for Congressional Consideration: 

Given the potential for improving compliance now and in the future, the 
Congress should provide IRS with the authority to use math error checks 
to identify and correct returns with ineligible (1) IRA "catch-up" 
contributions, and (2) contributions to traditional IRAs from taxpayers 
over age 70-½. 

Agency Comments and Our Evaluation: 

The Deputy Commissioner of Internal Revenue provided written comments 
in a December 4, 2008 letter in which she agreed with all our 
recommendations and outlined IRS's actions to address those 
recommendations. With respect to child and dependent care credit claims 
on "Married Filing Separately" returns, IRS plans to make programming 
changes that will allow the agency to use math error checks to identify 
and correct claims, and create notices to inform taxpayers of their 
possible eligibility for the child and dependent care credit if they 
file under a different status. For the recommendation to assess the 
effectiveness of combining FCR with other data on taxpayer 
characteristics, IRS plans to do so as part of its study on the 
reliability and applicability of non-custodial information in the FCR. 

The Deputy Commissioner also supported our suggestions for 
congressional consideration to provide IRS with legal authority to 
automatically correct returns for individual retirement account 
contributions that violate the dollar or age limits. She further stated 
that they could increase compliance and improve taxpayer service. 

As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce its contents 
earlier, we plan no further distribution of the report until 30 days 
after its date. At that time, we will send copies of this report to the 
Secretary of the Treasury, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue; the

Appendix I: Comments from the Internal Revenue Service: 

Department Of The Treasury: 
Internal Revenue Service: 
Washington, D.C. 20224: 

Deputy Commissioner: 

December 4, 2008: 

Mr. James R. White: 
Director, Tax Issues: 
U.S. Government Accountability Office: 
441 G Street, N.W.: 
Washington, DC 20548: 

Dear Mr. White: 

I have reviewed your draft report entitled Tax Administration: IRS's 
2008 Filing Season Generally Successful Despite Challenges, Although 
IRS Could Expand Enforcement During Returns Processing. I appreciate 
your recognition of our significant achievements in successfully 
delivering the 2008 filing season which you note was particularly 
challenging due to the impact of the Economic Stimulus Payment (ESP) 
legislation. 

Processing – We again had an outstanding filing season, successfully 
implementing significant and sometimes extremely late tax law changes. 
These included the ESP legislation, Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief 
Act, and extension of several expiring provisions, such as the 
Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) patch, deduction for state and local 
sales taxes, educator expense deduction, and the tuition and fees 
deduction. Through November 7, 2008, we processed over 155 million 
individual income tax returns and issued over 107 million refunds, 
totaling nearly $259 billion, which includes 8.5 million returns filed 
solely for purposes of claiming an Economic Stimulus Payment. 

Electronic filing grew again this year with 89.9 million, or 58 
percent, of individual taxpayers filing electronically. The remaining 
65.1 million were filed on paper. The number of returns filed 
electronically increased 12.4 percent over last year, which exceeds the 
9.2 percent increase we achieved in the prior year. This 12.4 percent 
increase is markedly higher than the 7.3 percent increase for 2008 
projected in the fall of 2007. 

The most significant increase in e-file occurred in the number of 
taxpayers who filed from their home computer. Over 26.9 million returns 
were filed from home computers, nearly a 19.4 percent increase from the 
prior year. Over 4.7 million taxpayers took advantage of the free 
online filing services offered by the Free File Alliance. Also notable 
is the fact that over 82.5 million taxpayers electronically signed 
their electronic returns, further increasing the efficiency of e-file.  

Successful implementation of the Customer Account Data Engine (CADE) 
continued during 2008 with several releases successfully deployed 
during 2008. In addition to the main functionality, CADE handled 
economic stimulus payments for CADE taxpayers. The CADE Release 4.1 was 
deployed in July 2008, and introduced new functionality, including the 
ability to verify last marital status, and to process Surviving Spouse, 
Deceased, and Prior Year returns. This release also accepted Treasury 
overpayment offsets and issued Computer Paragraphs 08, to inform the 
taxpayer they may qualify for a refund from the Additional Child Tax 
Credit and Computer Paragraph 53, explaining that the refund will be 
issued as a paper check. This has resulted in the ability to maintain 
accounts within CADE that otherwise would have returned to the 
Individual Master File, thereby retaining for these taxpayers CADE's 
benefits of faster refunds and much more up-to-date account 
information. As of November 14, 2008, CADE posted over 30.5 million 
returns and disbursed over 29 million refunds for more than $44.1 
billion. In addition, CADE processed 23.7 million stimulus payments 
totalling $18.2 billion. 

Telephone Performance - We appreciate your recognition that the 
unprecedented increase in taxpayer demand generated by the ESP 
legislation had a significant impact on telephone access. The Stimulus 
legislation surfaced in the media in January and was passed in 
February, 2008. We reacted quickly by adopting a multi-phase approach 
to provide timely and meaningful information to ESP customers as the 
details of these payments unfolded. We did this while at the same time 
ensuring that our traditional filing season customers had access to 
timely tax information, which is critical in promoting voluntary tax 
compliance. 

The ESP legislation had a dramatic impact on our telephone program, 
resulting in more than twice the number of toll-free calls in the 
January - June period of 2008 than in 2007 (118 million versus 57 
million). Automated Calls and Web Services more than doubled from last 
year's volumes while Assistor Calls Answered increased by 26 percent. 
The [hyperlink, http://www.IRS.gov] website proved to be a valuable 
resource to taxpayers, reflecting a 24 percent increase in "Where's my 
Refund" inquiries, while our new "Where's my Rebate" tool experienced 
37 million completed inquiries. 

Prior to the passage of the ESP, Accounts Management was on target to 
meet or exceed all toll-free performance goals. Despite careful 
planning and aggressive mitigation strategies, the extraordinarily high 
call demand experienced did have an impact on our ability to deliver 
volume driven measures such as Customer Service Representative Level of 
Service (CSR LOS) and Average Speed of Answer (ASA). The CSR LOS 
achieved through the April 15 filing deadline was 77 percent but began 
to decline to a January - June cumulative rate of 57 percent as 
taxpayers called in historically high numbers (12M calls in one week). 
The majority of whom wanted to know when they would receive their 
rebate. We did, however, exceed our goals in our other strategic 
performance measures including Calls Answered, Services Provided, 
Automated Services Provided, Customer Contacts Resolved and Self 
Assistance Participation Rate. Also noteworthy is that despite the 
challenges we faced this year, we have continued our high performance 
in the accuracy of our responses to our toll- free customers. We 
exceeded our goals and achieved tax law and account call accuracy rates 
of 90.3 percent and 93.5 percent, respectively. 

Walk-In Assistance - During the Fiscal Year (FY) 2008 filing season, 
the IRS continued to provide services at all 401 Taxpayer Assistance 
Centers (TACs). We continued to implement Contact Recording at 188 of 
the 401 TACs to better measure the accuracy of tax law and account 
assistance. Contact Recording is targeted to be operational at 306 
sites by the end of FY 2009. For the FY 2008 filing season, IRS 
implemented a new tax law decision support tool called the Interactive 
Tax Law Assistant (ITLA). This new tool builds the probes and responses 
in a logical fashion so that the same tax law information would be 
provided to taxpayers regardless of delivery method and thus enhances 
the accuracy of the answers. This year, TACs achieved an 85 percent tax 
law accuracy rate. We expect tax law accuracy to improve for the FY 
2009 filing season as walk-in staff gain experience with using ITLA. In 
addition, the TACs' provided assistance with ESP, which contributed to 
an increase in the volume of contacts at the TACs from February 15, 
2008, through May 31, 2008 compared to the same period in 2007. The 
Stimulus contacts through May 31, 2008 totaled 289,000. 

Volunteer Assistance - During the FY 2008 filing season, approximately 
78,843 IRS- supported volunteers in 11,840 locations provided 
assistance to traditionally underserved populations. These include 
individuals with low income, the elderly, the disabled, and those with 
limited-English proficiency. The Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) 
and Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE) volunteers prepared over 3.5 
million returns, an increase of 33.2 percent over the prior year. We 
equate this large increase to the ESP legislation, as many taxpayers 
who normally did not have a filing requirement filed returns to receive 
their payment. Excluding ESP returns, we estimate the increase to be 
14.2 percent. 

We continue to see steady improvement in the accuracy of returns 
prepared by our volunteers. While results obtained from specialized IRS 
and Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) reviews 
provided an indication of the IRS volunteer sites' performance, the IRS 
also conducted approximately 963 return reviews at 337 volunteer sites 
nationwide. The results of these reviews provide key information to 
base-line improvement goals and strategies for the filing season ahead. 
In order to assist with the determination of volunteer accuracy, 
Stakeholder Partnerships, Education and Communication (SPEC) has 
established an FY 2009 Centralized Volunteer Return Reviewer Cadre. 
Centralized management of a dedicated group of reviewers will provide 
SPEC with consistent, reliable measures of accuracy. This information 
will be analyzed by way of quality improvement principles. It will be 
used to formulate improvement opportunities during FY 2010.  

In addition to return preparation, IRS volunteer partners provided a 
significant service in educating taxpayers of their tax obligations and 
available benefits, such as the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and 
ESP. More than 650 million outreach contacts were made during 2008. 
These contacts included 219 million messages about the ESP through both 
media and non-media channels. These strategic partnerships with 
volunteer organizations leverage IRS resources and allow the IRS to 
reach far more taxpayers through trusted local community sources. 

Website - The IRS website, [hyperlink, http://www.IRS.gov], is 
consistently one of the most heavily used government web sites. As of 
November 8, 2008, the website has been visited more than 332 million 
times, a 65.9 percent increase over 2007. These visits resulted in more 
than 2 billion page views, an almost 67.3 percent increase over 2007. 
Visits are the measurement of actions beginning when a visitor views 
their first web page on [hyperlink, http://www.IRS.gov] and ends when 
the visitor leaves the website. Taxpayers and practitioners also 
downloaded more than 154 million forms, publications, instructions, and 
other documents. 

We agree the two Matters for Congressional Consideration noted in your 
report have merit and could further increase compliance and improve 
taxpayer service. 

Responses to your specific recommendations are enclosed. I appreciate 
your observations on the successful filing season for 2008, and if you 
have any questions, please contact Floyd Williams, Director, 
Legislative Affairs, at (202) 622-3720. 

Sincerely, 

Signed by: 

Linda E. Stiff: 

Enclosure: 

Recommendation: 

Use IRS's existing MEA to identify and correct child and dependent care 
credit claims on "Married Filing Separately" returns. 

Comment: 

We agree with this recommendation and will submit a Universal Work 
Request (UWR) by December 31, 2008, to implement programming by January 
2010; however, implementation of the programming is contingent on 
Modernization & Information Technology Services (MITS) UWR priorities 
and funding. 

Recommendation: 

Include information on math error notices to inform taxpayers that they 
may be eligible for the child and dependent care credit if they file 
under a different status, such as "Single", "Married Filing Jointly", 
"Head of Household", or "Qualifying Widow(er) with a dependent child". 

Comment: 

We agree with this recommendation and will submit a UWR by December 31, 
2008, to implement programming by January 2010; however, implementation 
of the programming is contingent on MITS UWR priorities and funding. 

Recommendation: 

Assess the effectiveness of combining FCR and other data on taxpayer 
characteristics to verify the eligibility of EITC claims from non-
custodial parents. 

Comment: 

We agree with this recommendation. The IRS already plans to study the 
reliability of non-custodial information in the Federal Case Registry 
(FCR). We will add a review of the possibility of developing methods to 
further refine the selection process before applying math error 
authority based on the FCR. Our goal will be to ensure that, if the IRS 
implements this Math Error Authority (MEA), it will apply only to those 
taxpayers who are not eligible for the Earned Income Tax Credit.

Appendix II: Using IRS's Math Error Authority to Process and Correct 
Returns with Math Errors: 

In the math error program, IRS uses computer programmed comparisons and 
calculations to systemically identify math errors during tax return 
processing (see fig. 3) for correction. These corrections involve 
mathematical calculation errors, incorrect taxpayer identification 
numbers, filing status and dependents, and missing schedules or forms. 
Once the computer programming detects an error, it forwards the tax 
return account to the Error Resolution System, where an IRS employee 
takes the appropriate action to resolve the error condition and provide 
the information needed to generate a notice to the taxpayer.

with math errors.

[End of figure] 

As early as the first codification of the Internal Revenue law in 1926, 
the Congress granted IRS math error authority (MEA) so that IRS does 
not have to provide the taxpayer with a statutory notice of deficiency 
for math errors. In general, these are errors that must be corrected in 
order for IRS to process the tax return. A 1976 statutory revision 
defined the authority to include not only mathematical errors, but 
other obvious errors such as omissions of data needed to substantiate 
an item on a return, and provided a statutory right to file a request 
for abatement of the assessment within 60 days after the notice is 
sent. In the 1990s, the Congress extended the authority five times to 
help determine eligibility for certain tax exemptions and credits. 
Table 7 summarizes the legislative authority on math error provisions 
for individual tax returns. 

Table 7: Math Error Provisions: 

(1); 
An error in addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division shown on 
any return. 

(2); 
An incorrect use of any table provided by IRS with respect to any 
return if other information in the return makes the incorrect use 
apparent. 

(3); 
An entry on a return of an item that is inconsistent with another entry 
of the same or different item on that return. 

(4); 
An omission of information that is required to be supplied on the 
return to substantiate an entry on that return. 

(5); 
An entry on a return of a deduction or credit in an amount that exceeds 
the statutory limit for that deduction or credit, if that limit is 
expressed as a specific monetary amount or as a percentage, ratio, or 
fraction, and if the component items of that limit appear on the 
return. 

(6); 
A correct Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) not provided on the 
return as required for the; 
* Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC),; 
* child and dependent care credit,; 
* personal or dependent exemption,; 
* child tax credit, or; 
* Hope and Lifetime Learning credits. 

(7); 
A return claiming an EITC for net earnings from self-employment, where 
the self employment tax imposed by IRC § 1401 on those net earnings has 
not been paid. 

(8); 
An omission of information required for recertification of eligibility 
for the EITC. 

(9); 
An entry on the return of a TIN required for the EITC, the child 
credit, and the child and dependent care credit, when information 
associated with that TIN indicates the child does not meet the age 
eligibility requirements for those credits. 

(10); 
An entry on the return of a claim for the EITC where the Federal Case 
Registry of Child Support Orders indicates that the taxpayer is the 
noncustodial parent of that child. 

(11); 
A failure to reduce ESP credit on a return related to the Economic 
Stimulus Act of 2008 by amounts previously advanced.

Appendix III: IRS's Processing Performance Relative to 2004-2008 
Performance and 2008 Goals: 

Despite the added individual return volume due to the Economic Stimulus 
legislation, as of June 30, 2008, IRS met or exceeded seven out of the 
eight processing performance goals. As shown in table 8, IRS met or 
exceeded its goals for the percentage of errors included in deposits 
and correspondence (which was separated into letter and notice errors 
in previous years); deposit and refund timeliness (i.e., interest 
foregone by untimely deposits); and productivity and Individual Master 
File efficiency. 

The one measure where performance was below IRS's goal and last year's 
level was the refund error rate, i.e., the percentage of refunds with 
IRS-cause errors issued to taxpayers by IRS. According to IRS 
officials, the increase in the refund error rate is attributed to a 
programming change that resulted in IRS catching, for example, changes 
of address or name changes, as it began transcribing data from paper 
returns. According to IRS officials, because the changes did not result 
in significant additional transcription, the increased error rate did 
not result in a delay of refunds or a delay in processing of returns. 

Table 8: IRS Processing Performance, Fiscal Years 2004-2008: 

Measure name: Deposit error rate; 
Definition: Percentage of payments applied in error by, for example, 
reimbursing a taxpayer who overpaid when the taxpayer wanted the 
overpayment credited to next year's tax bill; 
Fiscal year 2004 actual: 3.5%; 
(+/-.31%); 
Fiscal year 2005 actual: 2.2%; 
(+/-.26%); 
Fiscal year 2006 actual: 1.6%; 
(+/-.24%); 
Fiscal year 2007 actual: 1.3%; 
(+/-.22%); 
Fiscal year 2008 actual (through June): 1.1%;

[A] The Correspondence Error Rate is a weighted combination of the 
results of the previously used Letter and Notice Error Rate Measures. 
The weights are based on the actual volumes of letters and notices (as 
reported in Letter and Notice weighted reports). 

[B] Systemic errors are computer-generated errors over which a 
particular processing center would have no control.

Footnotes: 

[1] Most taxpayers file their tax returns between January 1 and April 
15, which is the deadline for filing individual income tax returns. 
However, millions of taxpayers receive extensions from IRS, which 
allows them to delay filing until as late as October 15.

by the end of the tax year to contribute an additional amount to a 
traditional or Roth IRA. In 2008, taxpayers under age 50 could 
contribute $5,000 to a traditional IRA, while those over age 50 could 
contribute $6,000.

[13] The Congress set this long-term electronic filing goal in the IRS 
Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998, which was to have 80 percent of 
all individual income tax returns filed electronically by 2007. While 
we previously reported that IRS was not on track to achieve this goal 
(see GAO, Tax Administration: IRS Improved Some Filing Season Services, 
but Long-term Goals Would Help Manage Strategic Trade-offs, GAO-06-51 
[Washington, D.C.: Nov. 14, 2005]), the IRS Oversight Board recommended 
extending the goal to 2012 (see IRS Oversight Board [2008] Electronic 
Filing 2007: Annual Report to Congress, (Washington, D.C., 2007).

IRS is considering a major modernization program that would include 
replacing the two legacy systems with contracts expiring in 2012. 
According to IRS officials, IRS's proposed modernization program would 
need to receive funding in the fiscal year 2010 budget in order to 
allow 2 years between the launch and testing of the new system and the 
retirement of the existing ones. However, IRS officials reported 
developing options in case they did not receive funding in fiscal year 
2010.

posing as taxpayers to assess the experience of the taxpayers. Site 
reviews assess whether volunteer preparers were adhering to minimum 
quality standards required by all sites. Return reviews determine 
whether the tax law was applied properly for critical items and 
resulted in an accurate return based on the taxpayer interview and 
supporting documentation.

[24] Some taxpayers may be eligible for a lower EITC credit amount even 
if they do not have children. 

[25] As in all cases, a taxpayer receiving a math error notice has 60 
days from the date of the notice to request that IRS abate the tax. If 
the taxpayer requests that the tax be abated, IRS must then use the 
general deficiency procedures under 26 U.S.C. § 6212 if it believes 
that the additional tax is in fact due. Unless a taxpayer requests 
abatement of a math error assessment, however, he or she cannot 
challenge the assessment through IRS deficiency procedures or petition 
the Tax Court.
