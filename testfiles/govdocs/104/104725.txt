 NOTICE  OF  APPARENT  LIABILITY  FOR  FORFEITURE 
 Released:  March  24,  2003 
 By  the  Enforcement  Bureau,  Tampa  Office: 
 I.  INTRODUCTION 
 1.  In  this  Notice  of  Apparent  Liability  for  Forfeiture  (“  NAL”),  we  find  AT&  T  Broadband  apparently  liable  for  a  forfeiture  in  the  amount  of  eight  thousand  dollars  ($  8,000)  for  willful  and  repeated 
 violation  of  Sections  76.605(  a)(  12)  and  76.611(  a)(  1)  of  the  Commission’s  Rules  (“  Rules”)  1  .  Specifically,  we  find  AT&  T  Broadband  apparently  liable  for  failing  to  comply  with  the  Commission’s  cable  signal 
 leakage  standards. 
 II.  BACKGROUND 
 2.  On  August  7  and  8,  2002,  agents  of  the  FCC  Enforcement  Bureau’s  Tampa  Field  Office  (“  Tampa  Office”)  inspected  a  portion  of  AT&  T  Broadband’s  cable  system  serving  Jacksonville,  Florida 
 to  identify  leaks  and  determine  compliance  with  the  basic  signal  leakage  criteria.  The  agents  identified  and  measured  twelve  leaks  on  the  frequency  121.2625  MHz,  ranging  in  signal  strength  from  51 
 microvolts  per  meter  (“  µV/  m”)  to  2,442  µV/  m.  Based  on  these  measurements,  the  agents  calculated  the  system’s  Cumulative  Leakage  Index  (“  CLI”)  at  a  value  of  70.9,  exceeding  the  allowable  cumulative  signal 
 leakage  performance  criteria  of  64.  2  (See  Attachment  B.) 
 3.  On  August  9,  2002,  the  FCC  agents  met  with  AT&  T  Broadband  staff  at  their  office  in  Jacksonville,  Florida  and  verbally  ordered  AT&  T  Broadband  to  cease  operation  on  aeronautical  band 
 frequencies  until  the  leaks  were  repaired  and  the  system  complied  with  the  basic  signal  leakage  criteria.  The  Tampa  Office  followed  the  oral  order  with  a  written  Order  to  Cease  Operations,  delivered  by 
 facsimile  on  August  9,  2002.  3 
 1  47  C.  F.  R.  §§  76.605(  a)(  12)  and  76.611(  a)(  1). 
 2  A  maximum  CLI  of  64  is  the  basic  signal  leakage  performance  criteria  of  Section  76.611(  a)(  1)  of  the  rules.  Leakage 


 that  exceeds  this  level  is  deemed  to  pose  a  serious  threat  to  air  safety  communications.  The  calculated  CLI  included  only  leaks  greater  than  50  µV/  m.

 4.  In  accordance  with  the  Order  to  Cease  Operations,  AT&  T  Broadband  was  required  to  complete  an  inspection  of  at  least  75%  of  the  system’s  cable  plant,  make  the  necessary  repairs  to  bring  the 
 system  into  compliance  and  submit  a  report  of  their  findings.  AT&  T  Broadband  complied  with  the  Order  to  Cease  Operations  and  requested  authority  to  resume  operations  later  that  same  day.  In  their  report, 
 over  75  additional  signal  leaks  were  reported  that  exceeded  the  basic  signal  leakage  criteria. 
 III.  DISCUSSION 
 5.  Section  76.605(  a)(  12)  of  the  Rules  requires  cable  operators  to  limit  signal  leakage  in  the  frequency  band  from  54  MHz  up  to  and  including  216  MHz  to  20  µV/  m  at  a  distance  of  3  meters.  On 
 August  7  and  8,  2002,  AT&  T  Broadband  exceeded  this  limit  at  twelve  locations  on  its  system  in  Jacksonville,  Florida.  Section  76.611(  a)(  1)  of  the  Rules  requires  cable  operators  to  limit  the  CLI  to  a 
 value  at  or  below  64.  On  August  7  and  8,  2002,  AT&  T  Broadband’s  cable  system  in  Jacksonville,  Florida  operated  with  a  CLI  value  of  70.9.  Furthermore,  based  on  AT&  T  Broadband’s  discovery  of  over 
 75  additional  signal  leaks  in  excess  of  the  basic  signal  leakage  criteria,  the  CLI  value  exceeded  74. 
 6.  Based  on  the  evidence  before  us,  we  find  that  on  August  7  and  8,  2002,  AT&  T  Broadband  willfully  4  and  repeatedly  5  violated  Sections  76.605(  a)(  12)  and  76.611(  a)(  1)  of  the  Rules. 


 7.  Pursuant  to  Section  1.80(  b)(  4)  of  the  Rules,  the  base  forfeiture  amount  for  the  violations  cited  in  this  notice  is  $8,000  (violation  of  rules  relating  to  distress  and  safety  frequencies).  6  In  assessing  the 
 monetary  forfeiture  amount,  we  must  also  take  into  account  the  statutory  factors  set  forth  in  Section  503(  b)(  2)(  D)  of  the  Communications  Act  of  1934,  as  amended  (“  Act”),  which  include  the  nature, 
 circumstances,  extent,  and  gravity  of  the  violation,  and  with  respect  to  the  violator,  the  degree  of  culpability,  any  history  of  prior  offenses,  ability  to  pay,  and  other  such  matters  as  justice  may  require.  7 
 Considering  the  entire  record  and  applying  the  factors  listed  above,  this  case  warrants  an  $8,000  forfeiture. 


 IV.  ORDERING  CLAUSES 
 8.  Accordingly,  IT  IS  ORDERED  THAT,  pursuant  to  Section  503(  b)  of  the  Act,  8  and  Sections  0.111,  0.311  and  1.80  of  the  Rules,  9  AT&  T  Broadband  is  hereby  NOTIFIED  of  this  APPARENT 
 LIABILITY  FOR  A  FORFEITURE  in  the  amount  of  eight  thousand  dollars  ($  8,000)  for  willful  and
