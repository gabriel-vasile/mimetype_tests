Sexual behavior of triploid males of masu salmon (the Amago strain,<i>
Oncorhynchus masou rhodurus</i>) was observed to determine whether they
showed quivering, a typical courtship behavior of salmonids, and if this
behavior could induce spawning behavior and oviposition of diploid females.
The triploid males showed external secondary sexual characteristics without
sperm, while the diploids were spermiating. A triploid or diploid male
was placed in an aquarium with an ovulated diploid female, and the behavior
of male fish was observed. Triploid males showed typical quivering toward
ovulated diploid females as did diploid males. In the first experiment,
the mean frequencies of quivering in the triploids and diploids were 83.6/h
and 40.7/h, respectively. However, females failed to spawn with both diploid
and triploid males. In the second experiment with slight modification of
the aquarium conditions, the frequencies of quivering in triploid and diploid
males were 89.0/h and 75.8/h, respectively. All the females tested spawned
accompanied by spawning behavior of males, irrespective of the male ploidy.
These results indicate that triploid male masu salmon without sperm show
typical courtship behavior and have the ability to induce spawning of ovulated
females, suggesting that a female could spawn with a triploid male even
in a natural environment.

<center><b>INTRODUCTION</b></center>
Technical development of chromosome set manipulation has promoted not only
experimental but also practical uses of triploid fish whose performances
are expected to be better than those of diploids, due to their lower investment
in gonad genesis (Lincoln and Bye 1984). In general, although triploid
females have poorly developed ovaries, triploid males in some salmonids
have been known to have partially developed testes with normal levels of
reproductive hormones (Benfey and Sutterlin 1984, Lincoln and Scott 1984,
Johnson et al. 1986, Kobayashi 1992, Kobayashi et al. 1993). Also, triploid
females of masu salmon are sterile, and the testes of triploid males are
less developed than diploid males and have no spermatozoa even in the breeding
season (Nakamura et al. 1987). However, the males show external secondary
sexual characteristics with similar levels of steroid hormones and gonadotrophic
hormone (GTH) as diploid males. These facts lead us to assume that triploid
males, even without sperm, show typical sexual behavior toward diploid
females. The sexual behavioral pattern of triploid fish has not been fully
investigated. Prior to actual use of triploid fish for fish farming, their
reproductive potentialities should be fully investigated, and the risk
of their escape into a natural environment should be assessed. In this
study, sexual behavior of triploid males of masu salmon was observed to
determine whether males show quivering, a typical courtship behavior of
salmonids, and if this behavior would induce spawning behavior and oviposition
of diploid females. Part of this paper has been presented earlier in a
preliminary form (Kitamura et al. 1991).

<p>&nbsp;<b>MATERIALS AND METHODS</b></center>

<p>&nbsp;The test animals used in this study were masu salmon of the Amago
strain, <i>Oncorhynchus masou rhodurus</i>. Fish were raised on a commercial
trout diet in an indoor glass tank (30 x 60 x 30 cm in size; water temp.,
13-16oC), and in an outdoor pond (1 x 4 x 1 m in size; water temp., 13-16oC).
Triploidy was induced by hydrostatic pressure at 650 atm for a duration
of 6 minutes, 15-30 minutes after fertilization (Onozato 1983). Triploids
were identified just prior to the experiments by comparing major axes of
red blood cells (RBC) with those of diploid controls, using an image analyzer
(Ibas 2000, Zeiss Co. Ltd.). The following two experiments were conducted
in 1989 and 1990.
<p>&nbsp;In the first experiment, triploid males were 2 years old and diploids
were yearlings. The mean values of RBC major axes of triploids and diploids
were 18.5-20.0 mm and 14.8-15.8 mm, respectively. The body lengths of triploids
and diploids ranged from 25.0 to 28.5 cm and from 19.0 to 24.5 cm, respectively.
The test tank was 45 x 90 x 45 cm in size, with a sufficient depth of gravel
to allow for nest building. Precooled well water (15oC) was provided at
a velocity of about 3cm/s through the tank during the experiments. A triploid
or diploid male was placed in the tank with a diploid-ovulated female (2
years old, body length 22.8-28.8 cm), and then male behavior was observed
and recorded using a video camera recorder for a constant time. Frequencies
of quivering displayed by males were counted for 1 hour from the time of
the first quiver, and subsequently, whether or not spawning occurred, was
observed for 24 hours. Ten different pairs of diploid male-diploid female
and five pairs of triploid male-diploid female were used. In the first
experiment, we failed to induce female spawning, and then conducted the
following experiment. Both triploid and diploid males were yearlings. Body
lengths of the triploids and the diploids were 12.5-18.9 cm and 17.0-18.3
cm, and the average major RBC axes were 18.3 mm and 16.9 mm, respectively.
Diploid-ovulated females paired with the males were 2 years old and 23.0-28.5
cm in body length.
<p>In the second experiment, we modified aquarium conditions by changing
tank size and water velocity to promote induction of oviposition. The tank
size was changed to 45 x 120 x 45 cm, and the velocity was increased to
12 cm/s. Five pairs of diploid male-diploid female and three pairs of triploid
male-diploid female were used. Other procedures were the same as those
above. Differences in the frequencies of quivering between the triploids
and the diploids was statistically evaluated by the Mann-Whitney U-test
(p&lt;0.05).

<p>&nbsp;<b>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</b></center>

<p>&nbsp;Although the triploid males used in this study showed external
secondary sexual characteristics, their testes appeared to have almost
no sperm. By contrast, the diploids were spermiated and sperm was easily
expelled by slight pressure to the abdomen. Based on histological examinations
(photographs not shown), almost no sperm was found in the seminal lobules
of the triploid testes which is known to be involved in the production
of steroid hormones, while seminal lobules in the diploid testes were filled
with sperm. Although we did not determine steroid hormone levels in the
present study, Nakamura et al. (1987) reported that steroid homone and
GTH levels in triploid male masu salmon are not significantly different
from those in diploid male, as is the case of other salmonids (Benfey and
Sutterlin 1984, Lincoln and Scott 1984, Johnson et al. 1986, Kobayashi
et al. 1993).
<p>&nbsp;Triploid males showed typical quivering behavior toward ovulated-diploid
females as did diploid males. As reported previously (Kitamura et al. 1991),
male masu salmon showed two different patterns of quivering (<a href="22ujnr75.gif">Fig.
1</a>). The total numbers of the two types of quivering are shown in <a href="22ujnr74.gif">Table
1</a>. The triploid and diploid males both began their quiverings 10 to
30 minutes after being placed in the tank. In the first experiment, the
mean frequencies of quivering in the triploids and the diploids were 83.6/hr
(range, 54-122/hr) and 40.7/hr (range, 9-79/hr), respectively. The former
number was significantly higher than the latter. A possible reason that
triploid males quivered more than twice as much as diploids might be attributable
to differences in the age between the triploids and diploids rather than
in ploidy differences. In the first experiment, female spawning failed
to be induced, although nest digging behavior by ovulated females was often
observed. In the second experiment where the aquarium conditions were slightly
modified, the triploids displayed a frequency of quivering similar to the
diploids (<a href="22ujnr74.gif">Table
1</a>). The frequencies of quivering in triploid and diploid males were
89.0/hr (range, 39-141/hr) and 75.8/hr (range, 34-109/hr), respectively,
without significant differences. All the females tested spawned within
12 hours after the beginning of the experiments, irrespective of the male
ploidy. However, at the moment of spawning, the triploids showed spawning
acts without sperm release, while sperm release was observed in the diploids.
Normal display of sexual behavior by triploid male masu salmon in these
experiments can probably be ascribed to the natural activity of steroid
hormone productions within the fish (Nakamura et al. 1987).
<p>&nbsp;Thus, in this study, we confirmed that triploid male masu salmon
without sperm show typical courtship behavior and have the ability to induce
spawning of ovulated females. Similarly, Inada and Taniguchi (1991) observed
that induced triploid males of ayu (<i>Plecoglossus altivelis</i>) with
poorly developed testes chased female diploids and were involved in spawning
activity. These investigations suggest that a diploid female could spawn
with triploid males even in a natural environment. However, mating by normal
females and triploid males, even if they have sperm that have the ability
to fertilize, would result in abnormal development of the zygote. Escape
or release of a large number of induced triploid males into a natural environment
could affect the productivity of the natural resources.
