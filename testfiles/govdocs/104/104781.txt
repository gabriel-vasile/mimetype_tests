      rubber, factice derived from oils, and such substances reclaimed.

4.   In note 1 to this chapter and in heading 4002, the expression "synthetic rubber" applies       
      to:                                                                                           
     (a). Unsaturated synthetic substances which can be irreversibly transformed by                 
           vulcanization with sulfur into non-thermoplastic substances which, at a                  
           temperature between 18 degrees C and 29 degrees C, will not break on being               
           extended to three times their original length and will return, after being               
           extended to twice their original length, within a period of five minutes, to a           
           length not greater than one and a half times their original length.  For the             
           purposes of this test, substances necessary for the cross-linking, such as               
           vulcanizing activators or accelerators, may be added; the presence of substances         
           as provided for by note 5 (b) (ii) and (iii) is also permitted.  However, the presence   
           of any substances not necessary for the cross-linking, such as extenders,                
           plasticizers and fillers, is not permitted;                                              
     (b). Thioplasts (TM); and                                                                      
     (c). Natural rubber modified by grafting or mixing with plastics, depolymerized                
           natural rubber, mixtures of unsaturated synthetic substances with saturated              
           synthetic high polymers provided that all the above-mentioned products comply            
           with the requirements concerning vulcanization, elongation and recovery in (a)           
           above.                                                                                   
5.   As follows:                                                                                    
     (a). Headings 4001 and 4002 do not apply to any rubber or mixture of rubbers which             
           has been compounded, before or after coagulation, with:                                  
          (i). Vulcanizing agents, accelerators, retarders or activators (other than those          
                added for the preparation of prevulcanized rubber latex);                           
          (ii).     Pigments or other coloring matter other than those added solely for the         
                     purpose of identification;                                                     
          (iii).    Plasticizers or extenders (except mineral oil in the case of oil-extended       
                    rubber), fillers, reinforcing agents, organic solvents or any other             
                     substances, except those permitted under (b);                                  
     (b). The presence of the following substances in any rubber or mixture of rubbers              
           shall not affect its classification in heading 4001 or 4002 as the case may be,          
           provided that such rubber or mixture of rubbers retains its essential character as       
           a raw material:                                                                          
          (i). emulsifiers or antitack agents;                                                      
          (ii).     small amounts of breakdown products of emulsifiers;                             
          (iii).    very small amounts of the following: heat-sensitive agents (generally for       
                     latexes), cationic surface-active agents (generally for obtaining              
                     electro-positive rubber latexes), agents, peptizers, preservatives,            
                     stabilizers, viscosity-control agents, or similar special-purpose additives.   
6.   For the purposes of heading 4004 the expression "waste, parings and scrap" means

     goods definitely not usable as such because of cutting-up, wear or other reasons.              
7.   Thread wholly of vulcanized rubber, of which any cross-sectional dimension exceeds 5           
      mm (0.2 in.), is to be classified as strip, rods or profile shapes, of heading 4008.          
8.   Heading 4010 includes conveyor or transmission belts or belting of textile fabric              
      impregnated, coated, covered or laminated with rubber or made from textile yarn or            
      cord impregnated, coated, covered or sheathed with rubber.                                    
9.   In headings 4001, 4002, 4003, 4005, and 4008, the expressions "plates", "sheets" and           
      "strip" apply only to plates, sheets, strip and to blocks of regular geometric shape, uncut   
      or simply cut to rectangular (including square) shape, whether or not having the              
      character of articles and whether or not printed or otherwise surface-worked, but not         
      otherwise cut to shape or further worked.                                                     
     In heading 4008, the expressions "rods" and "profile shapes" apply only to such                
      products, whether or not cut to length or surface-worked but not otherwise worked.
