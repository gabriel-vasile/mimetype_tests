Crop Suffers </u></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="5"><u>as Moisture Levels are
Depleted</u></font></p>

<p><font size="3">FAS/ Washington estimates the 2000/01 corn crop
in eastern Europe at 19.7 million tons from 6.5 million hectares.
Estimated production dropped 17 percent from last month and 36
percent from last season. Harvested area is down 2 percent from
last month and 8 percent from last season. </font></p>

<p>The Balkans have been in a persistent moisture deficit since
late winter and the winter dryness worsened into a drought by
late spring. Widespread drought and record high temperatures
covered almost the entire area of eastern Europe by June. The
drought lasted until July in the north (Poland, Czech Republic
and Slovakia) and through August further south. While fall
planted crops managed to survive fairly well under the
unfavorable weather conditions, spring planted crops did not. The
vast majority of the <a href="eemoistc.gif">corn grown in eastern
Europe</a> is in the Balkan countries of Romania, Hungary, and
the former Yugoslavia, where the most severe weather occurred.
Although temperatures across eastern Europe moderated in July,
the drought continued in the south and the heat returned to the
Balkans in August. The withering corn crop developed ahead of
schedule due to the excessive heat. Harvesting should now be
underway in the southern regions. </p>

<p>The following maps compare <a href="eemoist.gif">soil moisture
levels</a> during the 2000 growing season with the 1999 season.
The lack of moisture on May 15, 2000 in Romania and Bulgaria is
seen to spread north into Hungary, Czech, Slovakia and Poland by
July 7th. The drought is most pronounced in the July scene
because a very dry May and June had depleted moisture reserves
across most of eastern Europe. Although July rain brought relief
to the northern areas, the drought continued in Romania, Hungary,
Bulgaria, and the former Yugoslavia until late August. The August
7, 2000 map shows how the drought further intensified in the
Balkan region during July, while the northern regions show an
increase in soil moisture after a cooler and wetter period.</p>

<p>A team of FAS staff traveled through Romania and Bulgaria
during the middle of August to assess the drought damage. Please
see the following pictures taken during the trip.</p>

<p><a href="hill.gif">Picture 1</a> Cornfield in southeastern
Romania. The corn has been stunted by drought and a serious weed
problem exists as well. The hill in the background would normally
be used for grazing, however the soil is too dry this year to
support grass. The Danube River flows north, just beyond the
hill.</p>

<p><a href="scott8.gif">Picture 2</a> Cornfield south of Budapest
showing stress; the corn is grown on very rich black soil, but
severe dryness has stunted the crop. Note that the fallow field
to the right of the corn is too dry for even weeds to take hold. </p>

<p><a href="scott3b.gif">Picture 3</a> Stunted plants in
southeastern Romania attempting to produce an ear of corn while
competing for scant mositure with weeds. During the season,
capital was in short supply so many farmers forwent or greatly
reduced the amount of herbicides applied to their fields. The
corn in this field averaged between three and four feet tall;
there is simply not enough biomass to complete filling; the crop
is nearly a total loss.</p>

<p><a href="scott4.bgif.gif">Picture 4</a> Corn grown in southern
Romania. This field was planted too late and was ruined by
drought. This particular crop is lost, but an adjacent cornfield
was observed to be the best spotted during the trip.
Early-planted corn was able to escape the full impact of the
drought. Most farmers, however, lacked cash to purchase seeds,
fuel, and other inputs for timely planting. As a result, the
planting of many fields was delayed and yield suffered. </p>

<p><a href="scott1b.gif">Picture 5</a> Corn ear produced in
southeastern Romania (Dobruja region). Obvious pollination
problems occurred due to the extreme heat during the reproductive
period.</p>

<p><a href="scott5.gif">Picture 6</a> Bulgarian cornfield.
Similarly to Romania, unfavorable weather conditions also
occurred in Bulgaria, bringing down their corn harvest as well.
Bulgaria, however, produces only a fraction of the corn that is
grown in Romania. This field in northwestern Bulgaria had few
ears because of poor pollination.</p>
