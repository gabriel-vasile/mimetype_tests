After carefully considering her<br><br>          plaints, we affirm.<br><br>          I.  BACKGROUND          I.  BACKGROUND<br><br>                    On August 11, 1992,  appellant, a citizen of  New York,<br><br>          traveled to Puerto Rico.  She registered as a guest at La Concha.<br><br>          At 10:30  that evening,  while exiting  the piano  bar, appellant<br><br>          slipped on the second step of a small, carpeted stairway.  Having<br><br>          neglected  to  use the  handrail,  she  plummeted to  the  floor,<br><br>          posterior  first, sustaining  a fractured  right ankle  and other<br><br>          injuries.<br><br>                    Invoking  diversity  jurisdiction,  28  U.S.C.     1332<br><br>          (1988),  appellant brought  suit  in the  United States  District<br><br>          Court for  the District of  Puerto Rico.   In her  complaint, she<br><br>          posited  two theories  of  tortious conduct  under Puerto  Rico's<br><br>          general negligence  statute,2  alleging that  the defendants  not<br><br>          only failed to  keep the  stairs free of  foreign substances  but<br><br>          also inadequately illuminated them.  The first allegation stemmed<br>                                        ____________________<br><br>               1For  simplicity's sake,  we  do not  distinguish among  the<br>          entities that have been  sued, but refer to them  collectively as<br>          "the defendants."<br><br>               2The statute provides in pertinent part:<br>                         A person who by an  act or omission<br>                         causes  damage  to another  through<br>                         fault   or   negligence  shall   be<br>                         obliged  to  repair  the damage  so<br>                         done. . . . <br>          P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31,   5141 (1991).<br><br>                                          2<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          from  appellant's claim  that  the stairs,  at  the time  of  her<br><br>          tumble, were suffused with some sort of liquid (an inference that<br><br>          she drew  from  the dampness  in  her  pants and  on  her  person<br><br>          following her spill).<br><br>                    Trial commenced on April 20, 1994.  At the close of the<br><br>          plaintiff's case,  the judge remarked that  visiting the accident<br><br>          scene  might assist the jury.   When neither  party objected, the<br><br>          judge ordered a view to take place at approximately 7:00 p.m.  In<br><br>          implementing the order, the judge provided very little structure.<br><br>          He neglected to give  the jurors any detailed instructions  or to<br><br>          enlist the  court reporter's  participation.  Once  the entourage<br><br>          reached La  Concha, the jurors conversed  freely among themselves<br><br>          and at least  one juror touched foot  to stair.  It  is alleged  <br><br>          though disputed   that the jurors also spoke with the judge.<br><br>                    Despite these  informalities, appellant did  not object<br><br>          at  any point before or during the  view, nor did she solicit any<br><br>          jury  instructions concerning the  view, nor did  she request the<br><br>          presence  of a  reporter.   It was  not until  the next  day that<br><br>          appellant  for   the  first  time  objected  to   the  view  and,<br><br>          concomitantly, moved  for a  mistrial.   The judge  overruled her<br><br>          objection and  denied her motion.   Even then,  appellant neither<br><br>          asked  to interview the jurors nor requested any sort of curative<br><br>          instruction.<br><br>                    At the  close of all  the evidence, the  district court<br><br>          defenestrated the  claim  of careless  maintenance, granting  the<br><br>          defendants'  motion for judgment as a matter of law under Fed. R.<br><br><br>                                          3<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          Civ. P. 50(a), and sent the case to the jury only on the parallel<br><br>          claim  of poor illumination.  Appellant did  not ask the court to<br><br>          comment  on   the  evidentiary  status   of  the   view  in   its<br><br>          instructions,  and the court did not do  so.  The jury returned a<br><br>          defendants' verdict.<br><br>                    Before  us,  appellant asserts  that  the jury  verdict<br><br>          should  be set aside because the defects associated with the view<br><br>          warranted a  mistrial.   Additionally, she assigns  error to  the<br><br>          district court's handling of her negligent maintenance claim.  We<br><br>          take these grievances one step at a time.<br><br>          II.  THE VIEW          II.  THE VIEW<br><br>                    Appellant's principal assignment  of error features the<br><br>          district  court's denial  of  her motion  for  a mistrial.    The<br><br>          asseveration rests  on the  premise that defects  associated with<br><br>          the  view required a new beginning.  Thus, the question presented<br><br>          reduces, in the first instance, to the status of the view itself.<br><br>                    In  order to secure  our footing, we  begin with common<br><br>          ground:   a federal  court, exercising  its inherent  powers, may<br><br>          allow a  jury in either a civil or a criminal case to view places<br><br>          or objects outside the  courtroom.

See,  e.g.,  Lillie v.

See 2 Strong  et al., supra,                                               ___                   _____<br><br>          at 27; Allison, supra, at 1219; Wendorf, supra, at 393.                          _____                    _____<br><br>                    Fifth, the court should employ some method of fully and<br><br>          accurately recording  that which transpires at  the view, usually<br><br>          by enlisting the  attendance of a court reporter.   See Lillie v.                                                              ___ ______<br><br>          United  States, 953 F.2d 1188, 1191 (10th Cir. 1992) (noting that          ______________<br><br>          where  "there is  no  record  of  the  view,  the  litigants  may<br><br>          effectively  be  denied  any  means  of  challenge  on  appeal");<br><br>          Allison, supra, at 1219-20.                     _____<br><br>                    We add  a caveat:   the  list we  have compiled is  not<br>                                        ____________________<br><br>          F.2d 1074, 1076 (6th  Cir. 1970) (disapproving of "a  fact finder<br>          using  visual inspection  .  . .  in  the place  of  testimony to<br>          resolve factual issues").<br><br>                                          6<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          intended to be exhaustive or inflexible.  There may very well  be<br><br>          other   precautions,   not   recounted   above,    that   deserve<br><br>          consideration in  the particular  circumstances of a  given case.<br><br>          Similarly,  while the enumerated  procedures ordinarily should be<br><br>          employed,  we are  reluctant to  impose a  rigid format  upon the<br><br>          trial  bench.   Thus,  if circumstances  warrant,  the court  may<br><br>          innovate  (even  if  innovation necessitates  departing  from the<br><br>          list).<br><br>                    Last  but not  least, we  emphasize that  the onus  for<br><br>          implementing these safeguards does  not rest exclusively upon the<br><br>          trial judge.   When a  judge orders  a view but  strays from  the<br><br>          prophylaxis  that should  accompany  it, an  offended party  must<br><br>          bring  the  omissions to  the  judge's  attention  in  a  timeous<br><br>          fashion,  and, if necessary, lodge a formal objection.  A party's<br><br>          failure to take appropriate action will, in most cases, foreclose<br><br>          an appeal predicated on the omission of standard safeguards.<br><br>                    The case  at bar  vividly illustrates this  last point.<br><br>          Although  the  court ignored  some  of  the standard  safeguards,<br><br>          appellant  did not preserve her right to contest the propriety of<br><br>          what transpired.

THE DIRECTED VERDICT          III.  THE DIRECTED VERDICT<br><br>                    Appellant also  contends that the trial  court erred in<br><br>          granting judgment  as  a matter  of  law on  her claim  that  the<br><br>          defendants negligently  tolerated  a hazardous  condition on  the<br><br>          hotel's  premises.   Appellant concedes  that a  hotel is  not an<br><br>          insurer  of a guest's safety.  Nonetheless, she argues that there<br><br>          was  enough evidence  for  a  rational  jury  to  find  that  the<br><br>          defendants knew or  should have known of the  foreign substance's<br><br>          presence on the stairs in ample time to remove it.<br><br>                    Appellant  adduced  no proof  that  the  defendants had<br><br>          actual notice  of the danger.   Her claim  compresses, therefore,<br><br>          into a claim premised  on constructive notice.  Her  basic theory<br><br>          is that the jury  plausibly could have inferred that a liquid was<br><br>          on  the stairs for  a period of  time sufficient  for the hotel's<br><br>          staff to have discovered and removed it.  We do not agree.<br><br>                    A district court may  grant a motion for judgment  as a<br><br>          matter of law  "[i]f during a  trial by a jury  a party has  been<br><br>          fully  heard on  an  issue and  there  is no  legally  sufficient<br><br>          evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for that party on<br><br>          that  issue," and  the  party's entire  claim  "cannot under  the<br><br>          controlling law be maintained  . . . without a  favorable finding<br><br>          on that issue."   Fed. R.  Civ. P. 50(a)(1).   In executing  this<br><br>          standard, the  trial  court "must  scrutinize the  proof and  the<br><br>          inferences  reasonably to  be drawn  therefrom in the  light most<br><br>          hospitable  to  the  nonmovant .  .  .

In this instance, even if  the<br><br>          jury believed that a  liquid saturated the stairway, there  is no<br><br>          evidence from which it  sensibly could infer how long  the liquid<br><br>          had been on the stairs.   Because that is so, the  jury could not<br><br>          have drawn a reasonable inference  that defendants knew or should<br><br>          have known of the  liquid's existence in sufficient time  to have<br><br>          removed it before  Clemente appeared  on the scene.
