<H3>Introduction</H3>
This paper alludes to the conventional manner in which the United States has 
chosen to finance its public elementary and secondary schools and suggests that these 
mechanisms should be altered to empower individual schools more fully.  The paper's principal 
thesis is that education governance mechanisms have evolved in a manner which 
disconnects them from the practical operations of 
schools and the functional integrity of the latter 
has been badly impaired as a result.  Presently, both accountability and practical 
decision making authority are misplaced.  Those empowered to make education decisions do 
not operate schools.  Existing financing mechanisms exacerbate this condition.  Selective 
incremental changes, such as mandating that 90 percent of revenues be allocated to 
schools and that states require each district to 
maintain accounts for individual schools, or more radical reforms such as charter schools, 
contracting out, or vouchers could begin to alter the imbalance between governing 
authority and operating discretion.  The data 
availability alterations which  might accompany 
school by school financing, could also enhance our analytic capacity and, eventually, 
render schools more efficient. 
<P>&nbsp;<BR><H3>What is the Problem and 
What Explains It?</H3>
<P>American public education apparently exhibits a kind of institutional schizophrenia.  
On one hand it is said to suffer from such an excess of democracy that it is overly 
vulnerable and dysfunctionally responsive to virtually 
every special interest that can print a letterhead and manage to mount a protest or 
campaign.<b><sup><font face="courier new"><A HREF="#5-1" NAME="note1">1</A></font></sup></b>  On the other hand, analysts claim that 
the loosely coupled manner in which public education's operating arm is connected 
with the governance systems renders schools remarkably resistant to any fundamental 
change shaped by the formal authority of the 
political system.<b><sup><font face="courier new"><A HREF="#5-2" NAME="note2">2</A></font></sup></b>  
<P>This dual personality exposes public education to criticism of every imaginable stripe. 
 There are those who claim that contemporary schools have lost their purpose amidst a 
bewildering sea of constituent demands for AIDS education, classroom prayers, 
multicultural sensitivity, consumer awareness, 
environmental consciousness, self esteem 
enhancement, feminine liberation, drug and alcohol 
prevention, driver education, etc.  Similarly, there 
are other critics who contend that public education is the helpless captive of narrow self 
interests such as educationists, teacher unions, committed egalitarians, or  professional 
administrators all of whom steadfastly resist any 
significant change.
<P>Its public nature, political vulnerability, and operational magnitude make 
American education virtually a Rorschach test.  
Critics can impute to it almost any societal flaw 
or personal disappointment.  It is almost as difficult to gain agreement regarding what is 
wrong with education as it is to reach consensus 
about a solution.  However, the most widely publicized and currently fashionable 
governance and finance solutions, appear to have a 
common theme embedded within them.  Proponents of breaking up big city districts, 
relying upon magnet schools, allowing open enrollment, establishing charter schools, 
permitting private contractors to operate public 
schools, and advocates of voucher plans seem to 
share several critical elements.
<P>America's public education system has evolved governance  and finance 
arrangements which are inappropriately or 
inadequately aligned with arenas of action.  In effect, 
when it comes to the nation's public schools, 
power is poorly positioned to produce performance.
<P>A succession of twentieth century governance and finance reforms has left a set of 
education officials publicly visible and 
politically vulnerable while simultaneously eroding 
the functional integrity of the very institution 
responsible for instructing students, the individual school.  State legislators and 
governors and local school board members and their 
superintendents have decision making authority and they can be held accountable.  
They are formally authorized to make policy for America's education systems and they can 
be elected, diselected, censured, recalled, and fired.   Indeed, individuals in these offices 
turn over with regularity.  However, these 
individuals,  regardless of how important they 
appear on a formal chart of government 
organization, do not actually operate schools or provide 
instruction.  Moreover, they have remarkably little ability to influence those who do.
<P>Conversely, individuals who actually operate schools, upon whom the success or 
failure of a school is tightly tied, have exceedingly little formal authority, frequently 
have virtually no control over budgetary matters, and are virtually invulnerable to the 
conventional mechanisms of accountability.  These are principals and teachers.  It may indeed 
be just that since they are so poorly empowered they should be so powerfully protected 
from the consequences of poor performance.
<P>How did matters come to be so disconnected?  When it comes to public 
education, how come those in charge can do little 
and those who could do much have been empowered to accomplish so little?  This 
misplaced authority and control over resources was 
not a conscious creation.  It is the unintended result of numerous well meant education 
reforms.  Size is the principal culprit.  We have encouraged the formation of huge school 
districts which have outrun our capacity to manage.  However, dysfunctional scale is not 
the only problem.  Excesses resulting from Progressive Era political reforms, the 
&quot;Scientific Management&quot; movement among school 
administrators, community severing judicial decisions, and 1960s and 1970s federal and 
state government categorical aid fusillades have 
all contributed to this governance impasse.  State school finance arrangements, by assuming 
the district as the central operating unit, 
reinforce the status quo and typically do little to 
improve the situation.  
<P>&nbsp;<BR><H4>Everything Got Bigger:  The 
School District Consolidation Movement<b><sup><font face="courier new"><A HREF="#5-3" NAME="note3">3</A></font></sup></b></H4>
<P>America continues to be a nation of relatively small school districts.  In 1990, 90 
percent of the local school districts in the 
nation each enrolled 5,000 or fewer students.  
Smaller yet, 80 percent of all districts each 
enrolled fewer than 2,500 students.  What then is 
the size problem?
<P>The problem is on the other end of the distribution.  Fifty percent of the nation's 
public school pupils are enrolled in only 5 percent of the nation's school districts.  
These large districts include the nation's premier 
cities such as New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington, DC, and Dallas.  They also 
contain the largest concentrations of low income, dropout prone, and low achieving 
students. These are the very districts whose elite 
populations have come most to depend upon private schooling.  These are the districts 
most jeopardized by past and impending middle class flight. These are the very districts 
whose pupil populations are at the greatest risk 
of educational failure, and for whom one could argue the nation should have the greatest 
concern. Yet, these are the very districts in 
which the governance impasse is the most intense.  The further irony is that the reforms 
which led to this condition were intended 
originally to make everything better.
<P>In 1931 there are 127,531 U.S. local school 
districts.<b><sup><font face="courier new"><A HREF="#5-4" NAME="note4">4</A></font></sup></b>  Thereafter, state officials 
responded to a coordinated plea by business leaders, college professors, and National 
Education Association experts to eliminate small, usually rural school districts and 
consolidate them into larger administrative units.  
The campaign was remarkably successful. Consolidation advocates made a 
common-sensical appeal asserting that small districts were 
educational ineffective and economically inefficient.  They amassed almost no empirical 
data in support of their position. Nevertheless, within a 50 year period, even with major 
distractions such as the Great Depression, World War II, and the post war baby boom, the 
number of local districts was reduced eightfold, 
to slightly fewer than 16,000.  This figure has continued to shrink, though at a slower rate. 
 Today, there are estimated to be approximately 15,200 local school districts.  (All but a 
few dozen of the non-operating districts have been eliminated.)
<P>Among the less heralded consequences of this dramatic reduction in units of 
government is the status of representativeness.  The 
number of school board members nationwide was reduced accordingly from a pre-reform 
estimate of  more than 300,000 to today's level of approximately 50,000 to 55,000.  Of 
course, the nation's population increased along 
the way.  Thus, whereas there used to be a school board member for every 300 or so 
citizens, each such office today must represent 
approximately 5,000 constituents.  Distribution 
around such mean figures is enormous.  Central 
city school board members in districts such as New York and Los Angeles represent a million 
constituents.  A few small districts conceivably have more school board members than 
students.
<P>The school district consolidation movement may have created larger numbers of 
larger districts.  However, it did not create large 
cities.  They existed before the 1930s and their school districts already had large numbers 
of students for whom they were responsible.  Something more must have been operating 
to transform these systems, which at the turn of the century were thought to have the 
nation's best schools, into the stultifying 
bureaucracies which critics claim they have 
become.<b><sup><font face="courier new"><A HREF="#5-5" NAME="note5">5</A></font></sup></b>  The something more came in two waves.  The 
first, before World War II, came in the form of a cadre of professional administrators, 
and growth of political centralization.  The post World War wave came in the form of 
judicially imposed racial desegregation plans and a 
spate of Johnson Era categorical aid programs.
<P>&nbsp;<BR><H4>&quot;Scientific Management&quot; and the 
Growth of Educational Administration</H4>
<P>Frederick Winslow Taylor (1911), an industrial engineer who pioneered 
widespread employment of time and motion studies 
and efficiency applications to business production was a cult hero in his 
time.<b><sup><font face="courier new"><A NAME="note6" HREF="#5-6">6</A></font></sup></b>  He was a turn-of-the-century counterpart of contemporary 
business advisers and organizational gurus such as Demming, Drucker, Covey, Peters, 
and Senghe.
<P>Taylor and his colleagues' efficiency and time use notions, which came to be 
labeled &quot;Scientific Management,&quot; were quick to 
be adopted by the fledgling field of school administration. Who could resist 
rendering schools more efficient and who better to 
apply the new efficiency principles than trained school administrators.  The long lasting 
effects upon instruction were few.  Nevertheless, Taylorism had quite a dramatic impact.  
It vastly abetted school administration as a profession.  While the growth of big city 
schools had already created the need for managers, which further eroded the sovereignty of 
school board members, it had not yet spawned a 
&quot;profession.&quot;  Early big city administrators 
were more civil service clerks.  &quot;Scientific 
Management&quot; assisted the field in transforming 
itself into one which had professional legitimacy. 
 Because they &quot;knew&quot; how to operate 
schools efficiently, they could command authority 
and in that way began to draw power from school board members.
<P>&nbsp;<BR><H4>Progressive Era Reforms</H4>
<P>The excesses uncovered by turn of the century literary  &quot;Muckrakers&quot; were not 
restricted to the meat packing industry scandals disclosed in Upton Sinclair's famous 
novel, <I>The Jungle.</I>  Public institutions, 
particularly, in cities managed by big political 
machines, were found to suffer from similar corrupt 
practices such as rampant nepotism, illegal 
rebates, and sweetheart contracts.  Progressive Era 
reformers diagnosed the problem as an excess of partisan politics and prescribed a 
heavy dose of government centralization as a cure. 
 Their reasoning was that if small, relatively invisible, ward based decision making 
bodies were consolidated into highly prominent central city school boards, often appointed or 
selected in a manner which would separate their members from the dirty partisanship 
politics of machines, they would attract citizens of 
a higher caliber, more likely to make decisions in the best interest of the overall community.
<P>Big city school districts all over the nation, but most particularly on the eastern 
seaboard and in the midwest, underwent a series of governance changes as a consequence. 
 Ward based elected school boards were generally eliminated.  Central city boards, 
often appointed, replaced them.  Corruption probably was diminished. However, yet greater 
authority came to rest in the hands of fewer individuals.  Close links to constituents 
probably suffered in the process. The biggest winners of all may have been the school 
managers just then beginning to burgeon as a profession.
<P>&nbsp;<BR><H4>Racial 
Desegregation<b><sup><font face="courier new"><A HREF="#5-7" NAME="note7">7</A></font></sup></b></H4>
<P>The Warren Court's unanimous 1954 decision to render racially segregated dual 
school systems unconstitutional must surely be one of the most significant domestic decisions 
of the twentieth century.   The repercussions are still being experienced five decades later. 
 However, once the judicial genie of desegregation was released, it could not be 
restricted to the South.
<P>The legal logic which impelled the U.S. Supreme Court to find explicitly 
segregated schools to be unconstitutional also 
persuaded state and federal district courts that 
more subtle forms of segregation were also illegal. 
 Hence, cities as far from the South as Boston, Denver, and San Francisco found 
themselves wrestling with court ordered 
desegregation plans.  Desegregation opponents resisted 
both militantly and passively.  White dominated southern state legislatures rescinded 
compulsory school attendance statutes.  One 
Virginia county (Prince Edward) actually suspended public schooling.  White students flowed 
in droves to private, racially segregated 
&quot;White Academies.&quot;  Resistance outside the south 
was sometimes more subtle, but often more effective.  Many middle income white 
families sought refuge in the de facto segregated 
public schools located in suburban districts.
<P>Where desegregation actually occurred, it was often black households which bore 
the brunt of transportation burdens.  They disproportionately rode buses to attend schools 
outside their immediate neighborhoods.  The numbers of black and white students 
attending school together may have increased.  However, there was a price to pay.  Particularly 
for many black households, an easy interaction with a conveniently located 
neighborhood school was no longer possible.  Also, 
from the standpoint of many desegregating school districts, there was a new government 
authority with overarching power, a supervising 
federal judge.  These judges were not simply another elected official with whom one 
negotiated on matters in conflict.  Unlike a 
fellow school board member, a city council 
official, or a mayor, these judges held all the cards. 
 Negotiations were not typically a part of their modus operandi.  School governance and 
finance was all the more complicated as a consequence.  Accountability  was diluted also.
<P>&nbsp;<BR><H4>Federal and State Categorical 
Aid Programs</H4>
<P>The early years of Lyndon Johnson's administration benefited from a remarkable 
coincidence of political and economic circumstances.  Johnson's 1964 landslide 
Presidential victory over Barry Goldwater provided 
him with a hundred seat Democratic margin in the House of Representatives as well as a 
comfortable Senate majority.  The economy, fueled by a Vietnam war military buildup, 
had recovered from a recession.  These conditions, when mixed with Johnson's master 
command of the political process provoked an 
outpouring of social legislation such as had not 
been seen since the Great Depression.
<P>Among the bills were many that concentrated on education, K-12 schooling 
particularly.  The centerpiece was the 1965 Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). 
 However, professional development, vocational education, international education, 
bilingual education, and migrant education were also included in the President's portfolio.  
The momentum was sufficient that even when LBJ forwent a second elected term, the bills 
kept coming under President Nixon.  For example, as an aid to racial desegregation the Nixon 
Administration sponsored the Emergency School Assistance Act and education 
research initiatives.  Subsequently, President Carter 
endorsed the Education for All Handicapped 
Children Act and the formation of a separate federal 
Department of Education.
<P>While federal authorities were enacting new school programs, state officials were 
similarly engaged.  Thus, the decade from mid-1960s through the middle of the 1970s 
witnessed literally dozens of new categorical aid programs, some state, some federal, 
intended to aid local school districts in coping with 
specialized problems.
<P>An unanticipated outcome of this proliferation of special programs was a 
substantial increase in special program administrators. 
 Both federal and state governments were anxious to ensure that their funds were 
appropriately deployed.  Hence, they promulgated 
rules and the rules had to be properly overseen.  Most federal and state categorical 
programs required a local school district central 
office administrators to assist individual school sites. 
 These administrators drew their legitimacy not from the superintendent or local school 
board, but from more remote authorities in state 
capitals and Washington, DC.  School principals now were beholden not only to the 
conventional chain of command, running up through their central office to the superintendent, 
but also to a categorical chain of command running from their central office, bypassing 
the superintendent, and leading to a state or the nation's capital. Administrative 
complexity resulted, and accountability at the school 
level was dealt yet another blow to the organizational solar plexus.
 
<P>&nbsp;<BR><H3>The Consequences for Education and for Schools</H3>
<P>The above-described changes in education and education governance have accrued 
to three major consequences.  First, district 
level decision making has become remote, diffuse, and divorced from the operating authority 
of schools.  School board members and superintendents are accountable to the public, but 
they have relatively little direct influence over 
the operation of schools.  Conversely, the persons who do operate schools, principals and 
teachers have been stripped of the governing and financing authority they need to perform 
effectively.
<P>Second, the operational integrity of the school has been dysfunctionally disrupted.  
It is difficult for a principal and his or her 
staff to forge a unified vision of the manner in 
which a school should operate.  Principals, and to some degree teachers, are perpetually 
being second guessed by an authority structure which relies upon court decisions, state 
and federal categorical aid programs, teacher union contracts, and statutes which 
empower districts not schools.
<P>Third, accountability mechanisms have become misdefined and misaligned.  The 
proliferation over the past half century of 
out-of-school decisions makers has led to an enormous set of local district, state, federal, 
and judicial rules by which schools are expected to operate.  These rules are relied upon by 
remote authorities to ensure that revenues are expended in a legal and equitable manner.  
The rules are seldom oriented toward ensuring either good practice or enhancing academic 
performance.  The net result is that school administrators are now held responsible for 
complying with rules rather than creating and sustaining schools which power student 
achievement.
<P>Principals, particularly in our largest school districts, are seldom significant 
decision makers.  Personnel, budget, curriculum, special program, and 
even instructional material decisions are often made 
&quot;Downtown.&quot;  When decisions are made elsewhere, the 
accountability machinery is impeded.  The answer to the question posed of schools, 
&quot;Who is in charge here?&quot;  The answer is 
&quot;Everybody is in charge here.&quot;  When everyone 
is charge, it is difficult to hold anyone responsible.
 
<P>&nbsp;<BR><H3>Where Does School 
Finance Fit In All of This?</H3>
<P>State level school finance arrangements are not the root cause of the disjuncture 
in America between education's political accountability and practical authority.  Other 
predisposing conditions must assume the principal blame.  However, state finance 
mechanisms reinforce existing dysfunctional relationships and big city budgeting 
procedures exacerbate the problem significantly.
<P>&nbsp;<BR><H4>State Distribution Mechanisms</H4>
<P>Virtually since there were states, this level of government has possessed plenary 
authority for education.  However, unlike most 
other nations, the United States has opted to exercise this authority through rules of law, 
rather than by constructing an institutional basis 
for state control over schooling.  The financing of schools is part of this abstract state 
legal structure.  State statutes assume the 
primacy, for school finance purposes, of local 
school districts.  Taxation and distribution 
policies take the district to be the responsible 
operating unit upon which the state bases its 
calculations regarding effort and subsidy.  It is 
also the local school district which is the 
recipient of categorical aid revenues and it is the 
local district which is fiscally accountable to 
the state.
<P>These state mechanisms assume and reinforce the dysfunctional schism between 
accountability and authority.  State statutes assume that local school district officials 
will make appropriate decisions regarding the allocation of revenues to schools.  In fact, 
the majority of large districts have opted for a 
procedure which is mechanically easy and provides the appearance of fairness.  
However, they seldom opt for  distribution 
procedures which enhance effectiveness or ensure equity.
 
<P>&nbsp;<BR><H4>Delimiting the Debate</H4>
<P>Before condemning all of school finance, it should be understood that the problem 
is not all encompassing.  Revenue generation, regardless of its many faults and 
accompanying inequalities, is not flawed by school 
district size, categorical aid programs, 
scientific management, etc.  In fact, revenue 
generation has been, on some dimensions, aided or at 
least made more equitable by the United States having consolidated many small rural districts.
<P>Similarly, the vast majority of United States districts do not suffer from the 
disjuncture of governance and operation.  The 80 
percent of districts which serve 2,500 students or fewer, and perhaps even the 90 percent of 
districts which serve 5,000 or fewer students, are not the ones for which finance distribution 
reform is a major problem.  These smaller districts enroll approximately one-half of 
the nation's public school students.
<P>&nbsp;<BR><H4>Where is the Problem? In the 
Other (Larger) Half</H4>
<P>The &quot;problem&quot; is most acute in 
America's large, and particularly in its largest, school 
districts.  Fifty percent of the nation's public school students are enrolled in only 5 
percent of the nation's school districts.  These big, 
and usually big city, school districts typically 
rely on formulaic or mechanical budgeting procedures 
which, under the guise of promoting equity, actually eviscerate accountability and 
productivity and may well harm equity in the process.
<P>In most large school districts, important resources are assigned to schools using 
mathematical formulas.<b><sup><font face="courier new"><A HREF="#5-8" NAME="note8">8</A></font></sup></b>  What a school 
receives will depend on a few basic numbers, such 
as number of students and size of building.  These numbers are inserted into district 
developed official formulas to allocate teachers, 
administrators, support staff, books, supplies, 
and other major resources.
<P><I>Allocation of Teachers.</I>  Teachers will 
usually be allocated according to the number of students expected to enroll in a 
particular school and according to the class size the 
district seeks for that level of school.  Total 
projected enrollment, divided by desired, or contractually determined, class size, will 
produce total teachers allocated to a school.
<P>Typically, the allowed class size is smaller at the secondary level than at the 
elementary level.  For example, a district central 
office may allocate one teaching position for each 25 students at a high school and one 
teaching position for each 28 students at an 
elementary school.  Thus, a high school of 1,500 will 
then receive 60 regular classroom teaching positions, while an elementary school of 700 
will receive 25.<b><sup><font face="courier new"><A HREF="#5-9" NAME="note9">9</A></font></sup></b>
<P>These allocations, like other personnel allocations, may be counted in numbers of 
&quot;full-time equivalencies&quot; or &quot;FTEs.&quot;  When 
part-time staff are used, or a single person 
divides time between several school sites, the 
building is listed as having a fraction of an FTE. 
 The FTE count gives a more precise sense of how a school is staffed than a statement 
which counts full-time and part-time staff equally.
<P><I>Allocation of Other Personnel.</I>  Some other positions are also likely to be 
allocated according to number of students.  A vice 
principal may be assigned, for example, for every 500 students. Librarians, clerks, 
department chairs, social workers, and so on may be 
assigned on the same basis.
<P>Some positions, such as custodians and groundskeepers, may depend on other 
factors, such as building size.  Custodians may be 
allocated based on size of the facilities, and gardeners or groundskeepers may be a function of total square footage around the school 
building.
<P><I>Allocation of Materials.</I>  Many school 
supplies will be allocated on a per-pupil basis.  Thus, the textbooks, chalk, paper, science 
materials, and student workbooks may be assigned based on expected enrollment.  
Alternatively, the school may be allocated a dollar 
amount per pupil to cover these costs, giving the 
principal or teachers some discretion about just which items to procure.  If there is any 
discretion allocated to school site personnel 
regarding the budget, this is a likely category. 
<P><I>Exceptions to the Formulas.</I>  Most districts are firm about using these formulas, 
because they are seen as essential to ensuring equity among schools.  The district may 
make exceptions to provide a minimum level of staffing for a small school.  For instance, 
if the standard formula allows a counselor for every 700 students, a school may receive 
one counselor even if it only has 500 students.  
Exceptions may also be allowed when a school faces unusual circumstances.  For example, 
a school may have a good case for an additional teacher or counselor if it receives a 
sudden influx of students who do not speak English.
<P><I>Centralized Services.</I>  Not all the 
district's revenues in the budget will be allocated to 
individual school sites.  Some noninstructional functions are provided at the district 
level, such as legal services and business.  Some other functions serve two or more 
schools&#151;such as transportation or a district 
maintenance office and these may also be organized centrally.  Depending upon district practice, 
a greater or lesser amount of the total budget will be held centrally, its allocation 
determined by districtwide administrators.
<P>There are large segments of school district resources which could easily be 
allocated to individual school sites, but typically are not. 
 These budget lines are held centrally.  For example, individual schools frequently do 
not have a substitute teacher budget, a line item for minor maintenance and repair, or a 
line item for utilities.  The unwillingness to 
allocate these resources to school sites triggers inefficiency.  Not believing they have 
responsibility for or control over utilities, for 
example, erodes school level inducements to turn out lights or save on heating or air 
conditioning.  Substitute teacher use is an even 
larger problem.
<P><I>An Important Omission</I>.  Capital costs 
are seldom allocated to schools.  What is cost 
over time to construct and renovate a school are costs frequently born through some kind 
of debt instrument.  These costs while borne by the taxpayers of a local school district or 
states are almost never conceived of in public 
school systems as something that should be embedded in data used for making school site 
decisions.  Most American public school principals take their 
building for granted.  A private school operator, of course, particularly 
one who rented instructional facilities, would 
have a far more intense conscious understanding of capital costs.
<P><I>Inequality</I>.  Most districts have a clear policy of trying to provide equal education 
to all students.  However, very few districts end up providing equal resources to each school.
<P>One significant explanation for why two schools with similar enrollments may 
receive different dollar allocations is the 
conventional teacher salary schedule system.  In the 
first place, teacher salaries and benefits are usually determined by seniority and training.  
A school district's highest paid teachers will generally be paid about twice as much as the 
lowest entry-level teachers.  In the second place, senior teachers usually are granted greater 
discretion in where they are assigned.  If senior teachers, with the highest salaries, all prefer 
a given school, their individual choices in the aggregate can create a situation in which 
total expenditures for that school are far higher 
than they are at a school with many newer teachers.
<P>&nbsp;<BR><H4>What is the Evidence That Anything 
is Wrong?</H4>
<P>Existing resource allocation procedures, principally in large school districts, 
contribute to three kinds of problems, efficiency 
and productivity and equity both appear to suffer.
<P><I>Efficiency and Productivity</I>.  Almost any reader is familiar with the general, and 
lamentable, pattern of student performance in America's large city school districts.  
The litany of problems regarding low academic achievement, high dropout rates, 
frightening pupil mobility, widespread  parent 
dissatisfaction, and rampant school violence 
constitutes one of the nation's most worrisome conditions. 
 Clearly, the full blame for this situation cannot be laid at the doorstep of existing 
school finance conditions.  If school based management or some other simple means for 
restoring the connection between authority and operation were instituted tomorrow, it is not 
clear that student achievement would soar. It is 
likely that an integrated set of changes is need.
<P>Still, until the reconnection occurs between authority structures and 
accountability, the probability is great that schools will be 
incapable of contributing forcefully to the solution of these problems.   Thus, while 
school finance reform is by itself an insufficient 
remedy, it is still very much a necessary 
condition for improving matters in city schools.
<P><I>Equity</I>.  Prevailing large school 
district budget allocation formulae exhibit a 
regrettable irony.  Their principal justification is 
to ensure equitable treatment of students.  Preliminary analytic results, reviewed below, 
suggest that they have an opposite effect.  In 
fact, by virtue of allocating teaching positions, 
and then permitting the salaries of teachers actually holding such positions, to fluctuate 
based on criteria disconnected from instructional 
performance, resource allocation procedures result in substantial inequities.
<P>The analyses displayed in <A HREF="98217-5-t01.asp">table 1</A>  are based upon National Center for Educational 
Statistics (NCES) collected data for the 1992-93 academic year for a major midwest state. 
 These analyses are restricted to the 24 largest districts in the state.  The districts range in 
size from an enrollment  low of 42,000 to a high 
of 70, 000.   The analysis removes from consideration whatever is spent by the central office. 
 Elementary and secondary school spending is considered separately within each district.  
The table displays the range of intradistrict per 
pupil spending for each schooling level, elementary and secondary, for each of the 24 districts.
<P>The fiscally most fortunate school in the district with the highest intraschool per 
pupil spending difference is expending in excess 
of $50,000 per classroom more than the lowest expending elementary school in the same 
district.  The secondary school extreme in the same district is spending in excess of 
$35,000 more per classroom than its less fortunate 
low per pupil spending counterpart.
<P>Assuming the mean elementary per pupil spending difference of $1,074, the more 
fortunate school expends in excess of $25,000 per classroom more than the lower 
spending schools in the same district.  The 
secondary analog spends in excess of $23,000 per 
classroom more than the least spending school in the same district.
<P>Even at the low end of the intradistrict spending disparity continuum, the per 
classroom elementary school spending difference is $6,700.  The same figure at the 
secondary classroom level is almost $3,000 per 
classroom.  While not mindboggling, these are significant dollar differences.  These 
resource amounts would help substantially in the 
purchase of instructional supplies and materials.  
 The very existence of such spending differences, within systems which purport to 
allocate resources rationally is surprising.  It 
probably is illegal. 
<P>Again, relying upon NCES collected intradistrict per pupil spending data from 
two large industrialized states, a different kind 
of analysis was undertaken.  The data set includes per pupil spending, by school, for every 
school in every district in the 
state.<b><sup><font face="courier new"><A HREF="#5-10" NAME="note10">10</A></font></sup></b> Here, a &quot;Random Effects&quot; statistical regression model 
was used in an effort to determine, within individual school districts, total operating 
per pupil spending  (the dependent variable).  The &quot;independent variables&quot; used to predict 
per pupil spending by school were (1) grade level served or school type (elementary or 
secondary), (2) size of the school (in terms of 
enrollment), (3) percent of the student body 
listed as eligible for free and reduced-priced 
meals, and (4) percent of the student body 
classified by the school district as &quot;minority.&quot;  The 
results are summarized in <A HREF="98217-5-t02.asp">table 2</A>.
<P>These analyses display the per pupil financial advantage in each of the two 
states for secondary schools.  State &quot;A&quot; spends 
$565 more per pupil in secondary schools, contrasted with elementary schools and state 
&quot;B&quot; spends $491 more per secondary pupil.  
These spending  differences are consistent with 
what is known regarding the programmatic differences between elementary and 
secondary schools.  What is new here is actually 
having dollar data on the magnitude of such differences.
<P>Larger enrollments schools, within districts in these two states, spend less per 
pupil than small enrollment schools.  In fact, 
this method of statistical analysis suggests that 
each additional student in a school results in a 
decrement of approximately 60 cents per pupil for all student in that school.  Put in the 
converse, small schools within districts receive 
approximately 60 cents more per pupil, the smaller they are.
<P>Finally, schools within districts receive added resources if they serve low income 
and minority students.  For each 1 percent 
increase in either poverty or minority students, a 
school within a district receives anywhere from 
$2.00 to $9.00 additional per pupil.
<P>The dramatic exception to this statement, an exception of a magnitude so great as to 
warrant further exploration, State &quot;A&quot; displays <BR>
a spending decrease of $493 per pupil for each 1 percent increase in a school's poor students.
<P>The data displayed in <A HREF="98217-5-t02.asp">table 2</A> are interesting from several viewpoints.  First, one 
cannot help but be struck by the fact that despite these data being generated in industrial 
states in widely differing parts of the nation (one 
in the midwest and the other in the west), the direction and magnitudes of the dollar 
figures are remarkably similar.  The exception to 
this pattern is the per pupil spending decrement 
in state &quot;A&quot; related to poverty status. Second, 
a reader should keep in mind that these per pupil spending differences are occurring 
under systems which are intended to distribute 
financial resources to schools equitably.
<P>&nbsp;<BR><H3>What are the Alternatives?</H3>
<P>Contemporary proposals for altering education finance and governance can be 
arrayed on a continuum, the underlying theme of 
which is size of decision making unit.  The above-mentioned New York City 
deconsolidation serves as a good anchor for one end, the 
large end, of the continuum.  An unregulated voucher plan which enfranchises 
individual households to decide upon their children's 
education can anchor the other.  Between these poles are a variety of alternative 
arrangements, some more obvious of which are 
illustrated below.
<P>&nbsp;<BR><H4>School Based 
Management<b><sup><font face="courier new"><A HREF="#5-11" NAME="note11">11</A></font></sup></b></H4>
<P>This genre of finance and governance reform retains decision making in the public 
sector but repositions it, or repositions some significant segment of resource 
allocation decisionmaking at school sites.  Who is 
able to participate in decisions, only the 
principal, principals and teachers, professional 
educators and parents, all the above plus citizens, 
are questions which routinely are posed and generally are answered differently in different 
settings.  The Chicago school district decentralized decision making endeavor, still 
underway, to redistribute decision making discretion 
is perhaps the best, at least the largest, example of such a reform effort.
<P>What is crucial to the success of such a school based management effort is that 
resources are allocated to schools, in dollars, not in staffing positions.  Schools, then 
have an opportunity to determine the manner in which resources are used.  This may well 
involve a transition period wherein the amount of practical discretion evolves.  Senior, 
and presumably high paid, teachers cannot simply be turned out.  However, as 
retirements and other forms of attrition take place, 
the amount of dollar discretion at a school can be expanded.
<P>Achieving these kinds of reforms is not particularly popular politically.  A number 
of well established interests are threatened by 
the allocation of resource decisions to individual schools.  However, achieving school 
based management can be approached in relatively small policy  increments. For example, a 
state statute requiring that a specified 
percentage of district generated per pupil revenues 
(e.g., 90 percent) must be allocated to individual schools sites) in tandem with a statutory 
provision requiring districts maintain 
expenditure accounts school-by-school might have a 
dramatic effect.
<P>&nbsp;<BR><H4>Charter Schools<b><sup><font face="courier new"><A HREF="#5-12" NAME="note12">12</A></font></sup></b></H4>
<P>In the mid-1990s this has become a particularly fashionable idea.  The spirit of 
the reform is to permit individual schools to remain in the public sector, but to divest 
themselves of allegedly burdensome local school district regulations.  More than 20 states 
have enacted some form of statute authorizing formation of charter schools.  These statutes 
vary widely in the decision making discretion that individual schools can assume and in the 
manner in which schools can take advantage of an opportunity to opt out of their local 
school district governance apparatus.
<P>&nbsp;<BR><H4>Contracting<b><sup><font face="courier new"><A HREF="#5-13" NAME="note13">13</A></font></sup></b></H4>
<P>This idea involves a private sector firm bidding upon and ultimately contracting 
with a local school district to operate one or a 
larger number of schools, perhaps even all the schools in a district.  The publication of 
the book <I>Reinventing Government</I> by Osborne and Gaebler sparked particularly intense 
interest in the idea.  While not advocating it for education specifically, The 
&quot;Reinventing&quot; book inspired municipal and state 
governments to contract with private providers for 
a variety of conventionally managed public services.  The Osborne and Gaebler book 
was given added visibility by President Clinton's enthusiasm for the ideas during his 1992 
campaign.
<P>In education, however, this reform option has not been launched with great success.  
A major private sector entrepreneur, Christopher Whittle, who had earlier initiated a 
successful in-school television advertising 
venture, has undergone various insolvencies and 
has had, as a consequence, to vastly curtail his Edison Project.  At its outset, this plan 
entailed the startup of 1,000 private schools.  Recently, the grandiose plan has been 
scaled back, and Edison is now bidding on the operation of individual schools in a select 
few local school districts.
<P>Another private sector firm, Education Alternative Incorporated (EAI), has had 
two large operating contracts, Baltimore, Maryland and Hartford, Connecticut, and has 
faded away in each.  The company even announced formally that it would try its brand of 
managing public schools under contract to school boards in suburbs because the plans 
were seemingly not taking well in large cities.
<P>Another smaller firm Alternative Public Schools (APS), continues against virtually 
all odds, certainly against militant teacher union opposition and repeated court challenges, 
to operate a single elementary school in Wilkinsberg, Pennsylvania and 
Chelmsford, Massachusetts.  It would seem too early 
to judge this venture.
<P>&nbsp;<BR><H4>Vouchers<b><sup><font face="courier new"><A HREF="#5-14" NAME="note14">14</A></font></sup></b></H4>
<P>This reform is simple in concept.  It would involve government providing each 
family with a financial chit, a voucher, 
redeemable only for schooling.  Thereafter, 
presumably, the household becomes the fundamental 
decision making unit.  However, depending upon the restrictions placed upon use of the 
voucher, the idea can become practically 
complicated quite quickly.
<P>Voucher advocates have also lurked in the shadows of education governance reform 
for a long time.  Putting aside voucher principles stemming from the writings of John 
Stuart Mill, contemporary proponents of using the market place to shape education decisions 
trace their more modern roots to Milton and Rose Friedman's 
book<I> Capitalism and Freedom</I>.<b><sup><font face="courier new"><A HREF="#5-15" NAME="note15">15</A></font></sup></b>  This volume devotes a chapter to 
education and vouchers and provides an ideological 
underpinning for the notion.
<P>The Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO), a now defunct Johnson 
Administration War on Poverty agency, actually conducted a voucher experiment in Alum 
Rock School district, east of San Jose, 
California.<b><sup><font face="courier new"><A HREF="#5-16" NAME="note16">16</A></font></sup></b>  However, OEO was unsuccessful in its 
efforts to persuade an entire state to experiment 
with vouchers.  Even New Hampshire, the motto of which is &quot;Live Free or Die,&quot; took the idea 
to be too radical and refused OEO financial inducements to operate 
a statewide voucher plan.  These OEO experimental efforts were 
motivated more from of a sense of providing low income students with equality of 
opportunity, than they were propelled by a notion that 
big city school governance had gone awry.
<P>Despite potential complexity and controversy, this reform continues to attract 
remarkable interest, even though it has had little 
operational acceptance.  Congress has inserted a voucher bill, applicable only to the District 
of Columbia, in the District's FY 1996-97 appropriations bill.  It has passed the House 
of Representatives.  As of this writing, its 
Senate fate has not been determined.  However, the fact that it would proceed so far in the 
national legislative process is testimony to the 
attraction of the idea.
<P>A statewide voucher initiative was placed on the California and Colorado ballot in 
1992, and 1993, respectively; it was roundly rejected. 
 State legislative body after body has debated the matter with, as of yet, no widescale 
plan taking hold.  The Wisconsin and Ohio legislatures are partial exceptions.  They have 
been willing to support a gradually expanded voucher plan for inner city Milwaukee 
and Cleveland  students, permitting them to use public funds to attend private schools. The 
legislation authorizing these actions  is being 
challenged in the courts, and may well lead to a U.S. Supreme Court decision.
<P>Voucher proponents seem increasingly sophisticated, having learned to adapt their 
reform vehicle to the many objections which have been made to the idea of an 
unregulated voucher plan.  However, as with school 
based management, charter schools, and 
contracting, voucher proponents would be hard pressed 
to point to a widely successful model.
<P>&nbsp;<BR><H3>Rebuilding State Systems 
to Restore School Capacity</H3>
<P>What would it take to reconfigure state school finance systems in order to 
empower individual schools, restoring the operating 
capacity that has been so dramatically eroded over the past century?  There are two kinds 
of answers to this question.  One addresses the politics of the situation.  The other deals 
with the technical side of the equation.
<P><I>Political Prospects for Change</I>.  Site based management is an idea that makes 
much logical sense, is relied upon heavily in the 
private sector, and is utilized productively in some surprising settings such as the military. 
 However, it is an idea for which it is difficult to mobilize a political constituency in 
education.  When coupled with other compatible reforms such as a statewide or even 
a districtwide achievement performance measurement system, school based 
management comprises the crucial components of a 
forceful accountability system.  If schools had 
control over their resources, and outcomes were fairly and accurately measured, then it 
would more possible to attach consequences to school performance.  That is a 
frightening prospect to some.
<P>Many school board members are disquieted at the prospect of school based 
management.  They fear it will diminish their 
ability to micromanage.  They will claim, with 
some accuracy, they can now be more responsive to their constituents under the current system. 
 Of course, it is precisely some of this responsiveness which is causing schools to be 
unproductive.  Many school principals fear school based management because it will 
expose them to accountability.  Teacher union officials are often opposed to the idea 
because it might erode their districtwide base of 
influence.  Parents and other citizens who might benefit most from having productive and 
high performing schools are the least informed regarding the idea.  Indeed, the information 
costs to them are sufficiently high that many have little idea regarding the concept and 
probably even less willingness to advocate for it 
politically.
<P>Thus, the dismal short run answer is that school based management, and the 
changes in state school finance systems which 
would permit or encourage it are unlikely to take place.  For the political controversy that 
site based budgeting and accounting might provoke, see the hypothetical scenarios 
appearing at the end of this piece.
<P><I>Technically</I>.  As with many good ideas, there is far less technical complexity to 
implementing school based financing than there is a political challenge.  A set of small 
statutory changes is all that is needed.  These 
technical components are explained in greater detail 
below.  However, they summarized by Pierce in the following 
manner:<b><sup><font face="courier new"><A HREF="#5-17" NAME="note17">17</A></font></sup></b>
<UL>
<P><LI>Revenues should be conceived of 
as belonging to schools, not school districts.
<P><LI>Revenues should follow pupils if 
they transfer from school to school.
<P><LI>Per pupil allocations to schools 
should contain virtually the full cost of educating pupils including capital costs.
<P><LI>Revenues allocated to schools 
should be highly fungible, permitting discretion between personnel and other items. 
<P><LI>Schools should be permitted 
substantial discretion in purchasing, using a 
local private sector firm, for example, instead of the school district for 
services or items such as maintenance or supplies. 
</UL>
<P>To implement school based financing, existing revenue generating systems need not 
be altered.  This is not an endorsement of the revenue generating status quo.  In many 
states, there continue to be uneven burdens placed upon classes of taxpayers and uneven 
indulgences granted selected groups of property owners and incomes classification.  
However, restricting the consideration to school 
based financing alone, there is no reason to alter 
state school finance revenue mechanisms.
<P>On the distribution side, only a few additions have to be made to most state formulas. 
 Here again, this is not intended as an endorsement of the means by which states now 
allocate funds to local districts.  Many current 
formulas continue to result in unequal charters of wealth for some districts and often 
promote inefficiency as well.  Nevertheless, keeping 
the focus on redirecting funding to schools, all 
that need be done statutorily is to require that 
some fixed percentage of per pupil funding pass through district offices and be allocated to 
operating school sites.  The precise percentage can be debated.  However, approximately 
90 percent would be a useful beginning point.  This would retain 10 percent of per pupil 
funding for district office<b><sup><font face="courier new"><A HREF="#5-18" NAME="note18">18</A></font></sup></b> operation.
<P>Schools, once empowered with their own funding, might well decide to pool their 
purchasing for some purposes.  They might also contract among themselves for services or 
with the central office.  No doubt wherever 
schools could identify useful economies of scale, 
they would do so.  However, they are probably better able to determine such economies 
themselves than having them dictated to them by central offices, the current arrangements.
<P>States might also alter accounting rules, requiring that each district's financial 
accounting system ensure school site accounting, 
allowing the ability to determine with precision what resources are spent by each 
operating school site.
<P>Certainly there are many other complexities, problems that would have to be solved. 
 For example, a transition period would be needed to smooth teacher 
salaries between schools within a district.  However, these 
are not matters which need occupy state officials, at least in a technical sense.  Similarly, 
making a transition from the present command and control system over matters such as 
maintenance to a system by which individual 
schools assumed responsibility for such functions would be required.  However, this need not 
be a matter of state law.
<P>&nbsp;<BR><H3>Beyond Individual 
School Operation, What Might Such a New System Contribute?</H3>
<P>Imagine the year 2010 when the following three scenarios occur in the United 
States:<b><sup><font face="courier new"><A HREF="#5-19" NAME="note19">19</A></font></sup></b>
<P>State senator, James LaMorte is sitting at the Apple computer in his Atlanta 
legislative office.  He chairs the Senate 
Appropriations Committee and the markup session for the 
fiscal 2011 budget begins the next morning. He is working on a spreadsheet which displays 
a 10 year pattern of public school spending by subject matter and grade level.  He is 
networked to the state education data base which enables him to access categories of 
spending data and an assortment of school process 
and outcome data such as student performance on state subject matter achievement tests.  
These data are stored in a manner which permits 
disaggregation to the school site of origin.
<P>The Georgia Association for Guidance, (GAG) an intensely focused interest group 
representing guidance counselors in the state, contends that added spending for counselors 
would enhance the proportion of female students majoring in math and science.   They are 
lobbying for a categorical spending feature in the upcoming appropriations bill.
<P>Generally, Senator LaMorte detests earmarked spending limitations on school site 
personnel.  Nevertheless, he decides to explore the matter.  Both his sisters were 
themselves quite gifted mathematically and he has 
always been interested in expanding the career opportunities of women.  Consequently, he 
is quite open to any reasonable means which would enhance gender equity on this 
dimension.
<P>Senator LaMorte asks himself the question: &quot;Will added spending on 
counselors likely enhance female science and math 
enrollments and achievement levels?&quot;  If the answer is &quot;yes,&quot; he is quite willing to 
increase state appropriations for these purposes.  
To answer this question, he has accessed 10 years of school spending data and an assortment 
of other input and output information from the state 
education department data file.  He makes the key strokes necessary to array 
these data on a school-by-school basis, scrolls to the new S4P (Super Social Science 
Statistical Program) under TOOLS, and applies the 
programmed weighting controls for student social background characteristics.  He then 
begins to search for Georgia  high schools with the highest and lowest proportions of 
female science and mathematics majors.
<P>Once identifying the top and bottom 10 secondary schools on this dimension, 
he quickly computes the mean per pupil guidance expenditure in each set of schools.  
He uses his super social science statistical package again, in order to control for 
student achievement levels, and concludes, alas, 
that higher levels of guidance spending bears no relationship either to gender decisions 
or achievement levels.
<P>Ten years of precise accounting for functional and subject matter spending, 
school-by-school, simply does not reveal any 
systematic relationship between added levels of spending on guidance counselors and 
student decisions about academic major, numbers of courses taken, or subject matter achievement. 
 All of these results hold even after having applied the most stringent statistical 
controls for student characteristics.
<P>Senator LaMorte searches further through his data base, looking for possible 
relationships to high levels of student math and 
science achievement, and finds that the most likely spending linked variable is teacher 
training in advanced science and mathematics courses and inservice education in these 
areas.
<P>Senator LaMorte firmly believes in permitting school site professional educators 
to make resource allocative decisions.  Further, he has little doubt that literally dozens of 
Georgia principals have already done the kinds of analyses that he has just conducted in the 
last fifteen minutes.  However, he had now verified for himself that added resources, if 
allocated in a categorical aid bill directed 
specifically at guidance spending, would unlikely lead to favorable outcomes.  He now had 
an answer when he met the next morning with GAG advocates.  They would not be 
happy with his response and his refusal to include them in an earmarked section of the 
appropriations bill.  Still, he thought to himself, 
the data he had just analyzed were every bit as available to them as to him.  Why had not 
they done the analyses themselves?  Then they might have had a better idea.
<P><I>Twenty-five hundred miles to the West:</I>
<P>In his office in the Los Angles Municipal Court building, the facility which had 
been made famous 15 years before by the trial of O. J. Simpson, Anthony Serrano was 
sitting at his networked computer.  Almost two decades had past 
since the Los Angles Unified School District had consented, in 
Rodriquez v. Los Angles USD to allocate financial 
resources on an equal per pupil basis.  Serrano, the grandson of a lead plaintiff in a 
famous interdistrict equal protection school 
finance suit, was a court appointed master charged 
with ensuring that the school district was complying with the intradistrict equal 
protection agreement.
<P>The school district had been fumbling for years in achieving per pupil spending parity. 
 To do so had been an intense challenge because senior teachers had filed their own 
suits claiming a violation of union contractual 
agreements regarding seniority transfer privileges. 
 The school-by-school budgeting which had resulted from the original Rodriquez consent 
decree had left many schools in the San Fernando Valley, in the upper income reaches of the 
city, short of the resources to employ senior 
teachers with their higher salaries.  In effect, 
parents on school site councils had generally 
opted for smaller class sizes, in contrast to more highly-paid senior teachers and the 
inevitable concomitant of large classes.  Many of 
the district's more senior teachers were finding 
that they were having to accept the forced choice positions available to them in central 
city schools, and they were not pleased with the prospect of having either to move their 
residence or undertake a long daily commute.  Of course a number had resigned, but a 
significant percent had filed suit and had delayed 
the consent decree implementation as a result.
<P>By 2010, most of these problems had been resolved by the court, and Serrano was 
now using the LAUSD data bank to test for anomalies in school site budgets.  The consent 
decree still permitted a degree of disparity.  
Judge Ito, formerly of the criminal justice 
division but now hearing civil cases, had decided 
that the same decision rule which applied to 
school spending for the state of California, 95 
percent of all pupils in the state had to fall 
within a prescribed per pupil spending band, would also hold inside a school district.  It 
was Serrano's task to monitor this band and report to the court if resource allocation 
disparities exceeded the limit.  He was now preparing 
his quarterly report for the court.
<P><I>In mid-continent</I>
<P>In a Chicago suburb, Emma Coons sits at her computer.  The screen is filled with 
school-by-school budget and program comparisons.  As she scrolls through available data 
regarding spending and program profiles of Chicago area secondary schools, she reflects 
fondly upon the distinguished career of her 
grandfather, John E. Coons, a forceful and 
thoughtful advocate for school choice plans.  Here 
she was, as a school choice adviser, living out 
the hopes of her famous relative by advising families regarding the fit between their 
schooling preferences and the offerings and results 
of area public and private schools.
<P>The widespread availability of school-by-school accounting data, and the later 
addition of program information coded by school, 
had created a remarkable opportunity to enable parents to make informed choices 
about schooling for their children.  Emma was 
one of thousands of certified advisers who, for a fee, counseled households regarding the 
relative advantages of <A NAME="footnotes">schools.</A>
