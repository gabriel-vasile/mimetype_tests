<h1>Washington Department of Social and Health Services, DAB No. 490 (1983) </h1>
<p>GAB Decision 490<br>
  Docket No. 83-76</p>
<p>December 30, 1983 </p>
<p>Washington Department of Social and Health Services;<br>
  Ford, Cecilia; Garrett, Donald Settle, Norval</p>
<p><br>
  The Washington Department of Social and Health Services appealed a<br>
  determination by the Health Care Financing Administration disallowing<br>
  $1,520,968 in federal financial participation (FFP) claimed by the State<br>
  under Title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act (Act). The claims<br>
  disallowed were for the per diem rates paid to institutions for mental<br>
  diseases (IMDs) for inpatient psychiatric services provided to<br>
  individuals aged 22 to 64. Services to individuals in this age group in<br>
  IMDs are generally excluded from the definition of &quot;medical assistance&quot;<br>
  in which federal Medicaid funding is available. Section 1905(a) of the<br>
  Act. The State contended nonetheless that FFP was available for these<br>
  services because they were provided during the month the individual<br>
  receiving the services was admitted to or discharged from the IMD, or<br>
  during the month after the month of admission. An Agency regulation<br>
  stated that &quot;FFP is available in expenditures for services furnished to<br>
  eligible individuals during the month in which they become . . .<br>
  patients in an institution for . . . mental diseases.&quot; 42 CFR<br>
  435.1008(b). This regulation reflects a policy of permitting states to<br>
  consider a person eligible for Medicaid for a full month if tht person<br>
  is eligible during any part of the month, as a matter of administrative<br>
  convenience. The State contended that the Agency's longstanding<br>
  interpretation of this regulation was to permit FFP in the claims here.<br>
  The Agency determined that this regulation could not be read to overcome<br>
  restrictions in the State Medicaid plan concerning what services were<br>
  covered. Therefore, the Agency concluded, there was no FFP in that<br>
  portion of the per diem rates which represented &quot;institutional services&quot;<br>
  provided by IMDs to this age group because these services were not<br>
  covered in the State plan.</p>
<p> The issues raised by this appeal are primarily those addressed by the<br>
  Board in Joint Consideration: IMD Admission/Discharge Issue, Decision<br>
  No. 436, May 31, 1983. There, the Board upheld disallowances taken<br>
  against five States, concluding that the Agency's interpretation that<br>
  the IMD exclusion limits covered services was supported by the statutory<br>
  scheme as a whole and by the Agency's regulatory scheme. The Board<br>
  further concluded that the Agency had no (2) longstanding interpretation<br>
  permitting the States to ignore these limitations during partial months<br>
  in IMDs and that the States had not shown otherwise that the Agency<br>
  should be precluded from taking the disallowance. Here, Washington<br>
  argued that Decision No. 436 was incorrectly decided and was not<br>
  controlling here and that the Agency should be estopped from taking this<br>
  disallowance. For the reasons stated below, we conclude that our<br>
  analysis in Decision No. 436 was correct and should be applied here and<br>
  that the State has not shown that it reasonably relied to its detriment<br>
  on any Agency action in incurring or claiming these costs. Accordingly,<br>
  we uphold the disalloance.</p>
<p> Our decision is based on the parties' written submissions and on the<br>
  tape of a telephone conference call held on December 13, 1983. Below,<br>
  we first summarize our conclusions from Decision No. 436. We then<br>
  address the State's arguments about why that decision was wrong and<br>
  should not control here. Finally, we address the State's equitable<br>
  estoppel argument.</p>
<p>I. Summary of Decision No. 436</p>
<p> In the cases leading to Decision No. 436, the States argued that the<br>
  effect of the statutory exclusion of services to individuals aged 22 to<br>
  64 in IMDs was solely to render those individuals ineligible for<br>
  Medicaid. Therefore, the States reasoned, the partial month eligibility<br>
  provision as applied to IMDs in 42 CFR 435.1008(b) overcame the<br>
  exclusion by rendering the individual eligible during the full month in<br>
  which the individual became a patient in an IMD (or left the IMD). The<br>
  made FFP available in any services provided during this time period,<br>
  including inpatient psychiatric services claimed at a per diem rate, the<br>
  States concluded.</p>
<p> The Board examined the relevant statutory provisions and concluded<br>
  that the statutory scheme as a whole supports the Agency interpretation<br>
  that the exclusion results not only in rendering patients between the<br>
  ages of 22 and 64 in IMDs ineligible for Medicaid, but also results in<br>
  the absence of any provision covering inpatient services in an IMD when<br>
  provided to those individuals. Decision No. 436, pp. 5-11. In<br>
  particular, the Board found the following to be relevant:</p>
<p> * When the definition of &quot;medical assistance&quot; in section 1905(a) 
  of<br>
  the Act lists as covered services inpatient services in hospitals,<br>
  skilled nursing facilities, and intermediate care facilities (optional<br>
  coverage), each service description is modified by the parenthetical<br>
  limitation &quot;other than services in an institution for . . . mental<br>
  diseases.&quot; Paragraphs 1905(a)(1), (4), and (15).</p>
<p> (3) * While a state may cover some inpatient services in IMD under<br>
  paragraphs 1905(a)(14) and (16), these services are defined in terms of<br>
  the age groups to whom they may be provided: age 65 and over or under<br>
  age 21. Moreover, even for persons in these age groups, IMD services<br>
  are covered only if they meet certain conditions. This shows that the<br>
  exclusion resulted in part from a concern with the nature of services<br>
  provided by such institutions.</p>
<p> * The general IMD exclusion is not placed with the provisions of<br>
  section 1905(a) which relate to categorical and financial eligibility<br>
  for Medicaid. Instead, it appears as a general limitation on what can<br>
  be included in the term &quot;medical assistance.&quot; This is consistent with<br>
  the view that the exclusion relates not only to what persons are<br>
  eligible for Medicaid but also to what services can be covered.</p>
<p> The Board found that, since 1966, the Agency had consistently<br>
  interpreted the IMD exclusion to be a limit on what services could be<br>
  covered and that this interpretation was embodied in Agency regulations.<br>
  These regulations made it sufficiently clear that the Agency considered<br>
  the IMD exclusion to be a limit on covered services as well as on<br>
  individual eligibility. Moreover, wheher optional IMD services may be<br>
  covered, they are specifically defined in terms of the age groups to<br>
  whom they may be provided and must meet certain other conditions as<br>
  well. The States did not deny that these limitations also appear in<br>
  their State plan descriptions of what services are covered under their<br>
  Medicaid programs. Decision No. 436, pp. 11-16.</p>
<p> The Board examined a series of documents submitted by the States in<br>
  support of their proposition that the Agency had a longstanding policy<br>
  of partial month coverage of inpatients psychiatric services to<br>
  individuals aged 22 to 64 in IMDs. The Bord grouped the documents into<br>
  the following categories: formal policy issuances; internal Agency<br>
  memoranda; correspondence from regional Medicaid officials; and<br>
  miscellaneous. In summary, the Board determined the following:</p>
<p> * The formal policy issuances concerned inmates in public<br>
  institutions, rather than patients in medical institutions or<br>
  intermediate care facilities qualified under Medicaid to provide<br>
  inpatient psychiatric services to the aged or children. They simply do<br>
  not address the question of the allowability of FFP in inpatient<br>
  psychiatric services for individuals aged 22 to 64 during a partial<br>
  month of institutionalization. Decision No. 436, p. 17.</p>
<p> * The internal memoranda were not intended as an official<br>
  interpretation of the statutory IMD exclusion and how it (4) affected<br>
  covered services, and, in any event, the States could not reasonably<br>
  have relied on them since they evidenced an internal disagreement over<br>
  whether inpatient psychiatric services were covered during partial<br>
  months. Indeed, since the States did not show when they became aware of<br>
  the internal memoranda, there is a substantial question of whether the<br>
  States relied on them at all. Decision No. 436, pp. 18-21.</p>
<p> * While statements in correspondence from Region II officials may<br>
  have suggested, for a brief period, that the claims were allowable, the<br>
  States should have known from the context in which the statements were<br>
  made that payment was uncertain. Correspondence from Region V may have<br>
  suggested concurrence with Ohio's proposed interpretation that FFP was<br>
  available for &quot;institutional services&quot; provided by an IMD during the<br>
  month of admission, but also conditioned any concurrence on submission<br>
  of a State plan amendment. /1/ In Region III, there was no<br>
  correspondence submitted indicating approval of the State's claims, and,<br>
  in Region I, a memorandum was issued which indicated to the contrary<br>
  that FFP would not be available in the expenditures. Decision No. 436,<br>
  pp. 21-25.</p>
<p> * Other miscellaneous documents submitted by the States supported the<br>
  Agency's position, rather than the States', and some of the documents<br>
  indicated that some of the States may have known that the claims<br>
  potentially conflicted with regulatory provisions limiting services<br>
  coverage. Decision No. 436, pp. 25-27.</p>
<p><br>
  In light of these conclusions about the documents the States had<br>
  submitted, and the facts presented in the record, the Board concluded<br>
  that the States had not shown that they reasonably relied on Agency<br>
  action to their detriment. The Board held that the Agency was not<br>
  precluded from taking the (5) disallowances based on any of the theories<br>
  advanced by the States, including the doctrine of equitable estoppel.<br>
  /2/</p>
<p><br>
  II. Whether the Agency had an official interpretation permitting FFP in<br>
  these claims.</p>
<p> In addition to documents submitted in the cases leading to Decision<br>
  No. 436, the State here submitted a memorandum issued by the Regional<br>
  Medicaid Director, Region X, on September 30, 1977 (No. FY77-28M).<br>
  State's Appeal File, Exhibit 3. The State argued that these documents<br>
  showed that, from at least September 1977 until April 1982, Region X of<br>
  the Agency interpreted 42 CFR 435.1008(b) (and the more general partial<br>
  month eligibility provision at 42 CFR 435.914(b)) to permit FFP for<br>
  partial months of institutionalization. State's brief, p. 3. The<br>
  Agency did not deny, however, that it had interpreted the partial month<br>
  eligibility provisions to provide for FFP during partial months of<br>
  institutionalization, so lons as the claim was for services covered in a<br>
  state plan. In the cases leading to Decision No. 436, the Agency<br>
  acknowledged that FFP was available under the partial month provisions<br>
  in whatever part of the per diem rate represents the allowable costs of<br>
  services which are separately covered in a state plan and which were<br>
  provided during the month of admission to or discharge from an IMD. Our<br>
  decision recognized this.</p>
<p> The critical question is whether the Agency had a longstanding<br>
  interpretation permitting the States to ignore during partial months in<br>
  IMDs the limits on covered services (as opposed to eligible individuals)<br>
  resulting from the IMD exclusion. Like the formal policy issuances<br>
  examined by the Board in Decision No. 436 (in particular, certain<br>
  Program Interpretation Questions--PIQs), the Region X Memorandum deals<br>
  solely with the question of whether FFP is available in medical care and<br>
  services for thos who become inmates of a public institution. See<br>
  Decision No. 436, p. 17. The issue of whether inpatient psychiatric<br>
  services are covered is simply not mentioned in these issuances. We<br>
  explained that this was not surprising since a medical institution or<br>
  intermediate care facility is not a public institution under applicable<br>
  Agency regulations.</p>
<p> (6) Washington argued, however, that its State psychiatric hospitals<br>
  providing the services claimed here were &quot;public institutions&quot; within<br>
  the meaning of 42 CFR 435.1009. That reguation specifies:</p>
<p> &quot;Public institution&quot; means an institution that is the responsibility<br>
  of a governmental unit or over which a governmental unit exercises<br>
  administrative control. The term &quot;public institution&quot; does not include<br>
  a medical institution as defined in this section, an intermediate care<br>
  facility. . . .</p>
<p> The State explained why its paychiatric hospitals met the first part<br>
  of this definition, but did not explain why they should not be<br>
  considered &quot;medical institutions,&quot; as defined in 42 CFR 435.1009, 
  or<br>
  intermediate care facilities. Indeed, if these institutions were<br>
  qualified to provide inpatient psychiatric services to the aged under<br>
  section 1905(a)(14) of the Act, they would have to meet standards that<br>
  would make them medical institutions, or intermediate care facilities,<br>
  and, therefore, exclude them from being considered &quot;public institutions&quot;<br>
  under 42 CFR 432.1009. See, e.g., 42 CFR 440.140, 405.1035, and<br>
  405.1036. /3/</p>
<p><br>
  Even if we were to conclude that the State hospitals here were<br>
  &quot;public institutions&quot; referred to in the PIQs and other issuances,<br>
  however, this would not alter our basic conclusion that these issuances<br>
  do not show that the Agency had a longstanding official interpretation<br>
  that FFP was available for inpatient psychiatric services to individuals<br>
  aged 22 to 64 during partial months in IMDs. As noted above, they<br>
  simply do not address that question.</p>
<p> Contrary to what the State argued here, the Board in Decision No.<br>
  436 did not base its conclusions regarding the PIQs (and a similar<br>
  Medical Assistance Manual provision) on a finding that they were not<br>
  official Agency policy. We discussed them as formal policy issuances,<br>
  and, if they had contained the interpretation the States said they did,<br>
  we would have applied them as such. Thus, there is no merit to the<br>
  State's (7) argument that Decision No. 436 is inconsistent with the<br>
  Board's analysis in Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare, Decision<br>
  No. 277, March 31, 1982, applying a PIQ as an official policy<br>
  interpretation. Nor is Decision No. 436 in conflict with court cases<br>
  giving precedence to official Agency interpretations over informal<br>
  advice in legal memoranda. See cases cited in State's brief, pp. 7-10.</p>
<p> Thus, we conclude that the Agency did not have a longstanding<br>
  official interpretation that permitted FFP in the full per diem rates<br>
  claimed here. /4/</p>
<p><br>
  III. Whether Decision No. 436 should control this appeal.</p>
<p> The State argued that Decision No. 436 should not control the<br>
  decision in this appeal since the Board had not adopted a system<br>
  containing the elements necessary to support the precedential<br>
  application of its decisions. State's Brief, pp. 11-12. According to<br>
  the State, Board decisions are not reasonably accessible to parties, and<br>
  the Board did not treat one of its previous decisions (Decision No.<br>
  277, discussed above) as binding unless overruled.</p>
<p> The cases cited by the State merely support the proposition that,<br>
  where an administrative agency publishes its opinions using a system of<br>
  precedents, itmust follow its own precedents or explain any deviations<br>
  from them. Atchison, T. &amp; S.F.R. Co. v. Wichita Board of Trade, 412 U.<br>
  S. 800, 808 (1973); Greyhound Corp. v. ICC, 554 F.2d 414, 416 (D.C.<br>
  Cir. 1977).</p>
<p> (8) We see nothing in these cases which precludes the Board from<br>
  adopting an analysis from a prior decision, to the extent the issues are<br>
  the same and the appellant is provided an opportunity to show why the<br>
  prior decision is wrong. The Board is not applying its prior decision<br>
  as a rule governing the behavior of the appellant, so that notice would<br>
  be required. Instead, the Board is merely concluding that the reasons<br>
  why the prior decision was reached are relevant here as well. /5/</p>
<p><br>
  In this case, the appellant has had ample opportunity to brief the<br>
  issues. To the extent the issues are the same as those in Decision No.<br>
  436, we incorporate our reasoning there into this decision by reference;<br>
  to the extent the issues are different, we address them here.</p>
<p>IV. Whether equitable estoppel should be applied against the Agency<br>
  here.</p>
<p> The State argued that the Agency should be precluded by the doctrine<br>
  of equitable estoppel &quot;from asserting in this disallowance an<br>
  interpretation of 42 CFR 435.1008(b) different from that applied in PIQs<br>
  MMB-77-6 and 78-7.&quot; State's brief, pp. 12-13. The State discussed the<br>
  required elements of estoppel, acknowledging that the Supreme Court<br>
  indicated in Schweiker v. Hansen, 450 U.S. 785 (1981), that a showing of<br>
  &quot;affirmative misconduct&quot; might be required in order to apply estoppel 
  to<br>
  the federal government. State's brief, pp. 12-14. The State asserted<br>
  that 1) the Agency knew the facts; 2) the Agency intended that the<br>
  State rely upon its conduct, the State's reliance was reasonable under<br>
  the circumstances and the Agency conduct amounted to &quot;affirmative<br>
  misconduct&quot;; 3) that the State was ignorant of the true facts; and<br>
  that the State relied to its detriment upon the Agency's conduct.</p>
<p> We discuss each of these elements below, and conclude that the State<br>
  has not met its burden of showing that estoppel should apply.</p>
<p> As a context for our discussion, we note that the disallowed claims<br>
  were submitted by the State on expenditure reports for the quarters<br>
  ended March 31, 1982 (submitted to the Agency on April 30, 1982) and<br>
  September 30, 1982, with retroactive adjustments for expenditures from<br>
  the period January 1, 1980 to June 30, 1982. Thus, although the State<br>
  alleged that the (9) Agency had an interpretation that the costs were<br>
  allowable dating back to 1977, the State did not actually submit any<br>
  claims for the costs until almost five years later.</p>
<p>A. Whether the Agency knew the facts.</p>
<p> The State asserted that the Agency knew it was interpreting the<br>
  partial month eligibility provision &quot;to permit FFP for the month when a<br>
  Medicaid-eligible individual entered an IMD&quot; and this is &quot;amply shown 
  by<br>
  the FIQs, the intra-office memorandumand the payments made to New York<br>
  on a similar claim.&quot; State's brief, p. 15.</p>
<p> As we indicated above and in Decision 436, the PIQs do not address<br>
  the question of whether the partial month eligibility provision<br>
  overcomes the restrictions on covered services resulting from the IMD<br>
  exclusion (i.e., the absence of any provision covering inpatient<br>
  hospital, SNF, and ICF services in an IMD for individuals aged 22 to<br>
  64). As discussed more fully below, the inter-office memoranda cited by<br>
  the State also do not directly address the question, and, even if they<br>
  did, nothing in them indicates they were official interpretations.<br>
  Finally, given the payment system under Title XIX of the Act, mere<br>
  payment of a claim cannot be construed as implying that the claim is<br>
  allowable. See, e.g., New York State Department of Social Services,<br>
  Decision No. 449, July 29, 1983, p. 26.</p>
<p>B. Whether the State reasonably relied on Agency conduct constituting<br>
  affirmative misconduct</p>
<p> The State said that it had a right to think that the Agency intended<br>
  for the States to follow the Agency's advice and instruction in the PIQs<br>
  and Medical Assistance Manual. We agree, but this is irrelevant since<br>
  those documents do not address the issue here.</p>
<p> With respect to its affirmative misconduct argument, the State<br>
  claimed that issuance of the PIQs to all regions, and of the Regional<br>
  Medicaid Director's Memorandum No. FY77-28M to Region X, was affirmative<br>
  action. This also proves nothing since these documents did not address<br>
  the issue here. The State also referred to internal memoranda by the<br>
  Agency's Director of the Bureau of Program Policy, alleging that these<br>
  memoranda, entitled &quot;Policy Information for all Regions,&quot; were within<br>
  the scope of his authority. For a discussion of these memoranda, see<br>
  Decision No. 436, pp. 18-21.</p>
<p> In Decision No. 436, we concluded regarding these memoranda that 1)<br>
  they did not clearly address the interpretation of how the partial month<br>
  eligibility provision affects covered services; 2) they were informal<br>
  Agency documents; and 3) even if they might have suggested for a short<br>
  period of time that (10) the States claims were allowable, in context,<br>
  the States should have known that the issue was a disputed one.<br>
  Consequently, the Board concluded that reliance on the memoranda was<br>
  unreasonable. This analysis applies here as well. Moreover, like the<br>
  other States, Washington did not provide any evidence that it was aware<br>
  of these documents at the time it incurred the costs claimed here, and,<br>
  in fact, relied on them in incurring the costs.</p>
<p> Thus, we find no conduct here which the Agency intended as a basis<br>
  for permitting FFP in the claims hre and whicn constitutes affirmative<br>
  misconduct.</p>
<p>C. Whether the State was ignorant of the true facts.</p>
<p> The State said that it did not know about the Agency's<br>
  &quot;post-September 1981&quot; interpretation that the costs were unallowable<br>
  until it was officially advised by letter dated April 16, 1982. The<br>
  State concluded from this that it was ignorant of the true facts.</p>
<p> As we concluded in Decision No. 436, the Agency regulations on the<br>
  IMD exclusion were sufficiently clear to give notice that the Agency<br>
  interpreted the IMD exclusion to be a limitation on covered services as<br>
  well as a limitation on individual eligibility. Moreover, even if we<br>
  agreed with the State that it could rely on the documents cited here,<br>
  estoppel could not apply to that part of the costs here covering periods<br>
  after the April 16, 1982 letter informed the State that the costs were<br>
  unallowable. /6/</p>
<p><br>
  D. Whether the State relied to its detriment upon the Agency's conduct.</p>
<p> The State did not allege that it relied on Agency conduct in actually<br>
  incurring the costs claimed here. As we noted in Decision No. 436,<br>
  these IMD services costs would have been incurred and paid for by the<br>
  States even if the partial month eligibility provision did not exist.<br>
  Indeed, one of the reasons for Congress enacting the IMD exclusion was<br>
  that (11) these types of costs had traditionally been recognized as the<br>
  responsibility of the states. S. REP. 404, Pt. 1, 89th Cong., 1st Sess.<br>
  144 (1965).</p>
<p> The State alleged merely that the State &quot;expended both staff time and<br>
  forwent legislative funds based on the Agency's pre-September 21, 1981<br>
  interpretation.&quot; States' brief, p. 18. The State estimated that it<br>
  spent $2,700 worth of staff time in preparation of its claim and<br>
  requested less money from the State legislature &quot;based on its belief of<br>
  the pre-September 21, 1981 interpretation.&quot; State's brief, p. 18.</p>
<p> The memorandum which the State submitted in support of its argument<br>
  that it incurred preparation costs in reliance on an Agency<br>
  interpretation shows that most of the State's preparation costs were<br>
  incurred after the State received the April 16, 1982 official notice<br>
  that the costs were unallowable. State's Appeal File, Ex. 16. The<br>
  affidavit submitted to show that the State requested less money from its<br>
  legislature states only that the State reduced its 1981 budget request<br>
  by $131,250 &quot;based on the belief that the Department of Health and Human<br>
  Services would allow full-month federal financial participation for<br>
  services rendered during the last and first partial month of an<br>
  individual's stay in a state mental hospital.&quot; State's Appeal File, Ex.<br>
  17. This affidavit does not state that the belief was based on Agency<br>
  conduct as opposed to the State's own interpretation. In any event,<br>
  these types of alleged injury are, at the most, administrative or remote<br>
  consequential effects of the disallowances, and are insufficient to<br>
  justify awarding the State over a million dollars to cover costs it<br>
  would have incurred anyway.</p>
<p> (12) In summary, we conclude that the State has not met its burden of<br>
  showing that the Agency should be precluded from taking the disallowance<br>
  here.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p> For the reasons stated above and for the reasons stated in Decision<br>
  No. 436, we conclude that the disallowance should be upheld, subject to<br>
  reduction under the conditions stated in Decision No. 436. /1/ Ohio<br>
  contended that it had submitted amendments covering inpatient<br>
  psychiatric services in IMDs during the month of admission, but the<br>
  Board found that the provision the State relied on did not provide such<br>
  coverage. The provision appeared in agreements between two state<br>
  agencies and merely said that one agency would &quot;(include) in the state<br>
  plan provision to allow Medicaid payment for services rendered during<br>
  the month of admission to a certified&quot; IMD. The Board concluded that<br>
  Agency approval of these agreements could not be considered approval of<br>
  extending the State plan to cover inpatient psychiatric services to<br>
  individuals aged 22 to 64. Decision No. 436, pp. 27-28; see also, Ohio<br>
  Department of Public Welfare, Decision No. 486, December 13, 1983.<br>
  /2/ The Board also addressed in Decision No. 436 the allowability of<br>
  costs incurred during the month after the month of admission to an IMD,<br>
  concluding that there was no basis for such claims. The State presented<br>
  no reasons here why that analysis was wrong. /3/ We agree with<br>
  the State that the definitions of a public institution and institution<br>
  for mental diseases would not be mutually exclusive. A State-owned IMD<br>
  that did not qualify as a hospital, skilled nursing facility, or<br>
  intermediate care facility would be a public institution. However,<br>
  there is no provision under Medicaid for FFP in services in this type of<br>
  custodial care institution, even for the aged or children, so this<br>
  factor simply does not help the State here. /4/ The State also<br>
  tried to distinguish its situation from that of the States involved in<br>
  Decision No. 436 by arguing that Washington covers inpatient services<br>
  when provided in psychiatric wards of general, private hospitals to<br>
  individuals aged 22 to 64. Thus, the State said, the Agency was<br>
  incorrect in saying that interpreting the partial month eligibility<br>
  provision to cover IMD services to these individuals would render them<br>
  eligible during partial months for services they would not be eligible<br>
  for outside the institutions. According to the State, psychiatric<br>
  services in private, general hospitals are identical to the IMD services<br>
  involved here. We disagree. Although the nature of the psychiatric<br>
  services in a general hospital and an IMD might be the same for some<br>
  purposes, Congress distinguished in section 1905(a) of the Act between<br>
  services in IMDs and services in other institutions. For purposes of<br>
  Medicaid coverage, therefore, the services are not identical.<br>
  /5/ We wish to note that the Board has taken steps to make its decisions<br>
  reasonably accessible, and, as discussed above, Decision No. 277 did not<br>
  need to be overruled in Decision No. 436 because the two decisions are<br>
  consistent. /6/ The Agency submitted documentary evidence that<br>
  the State, in fact, knew as early as October, 1981 about the Agency's<br>
  Assistant General Counsel's memorandum of September 1981, specifically<br>
  advising that the costs were unallowable. The State acknowledged that<br>
  it had received a copy of the memorandum prior to October 26, 1981 but<br>
  objected to the admissability of the documentary evidence on the grounds<br>
  that it consisted of internal State memoranda protected by the<br>
  attorney/client privilege. Conference call of December 13, 1983. In<br>
  ruling that the documents were admissible, the Presiding Board Member<br>
  noted that the objection was not made in a discovery context, where the<br>
  privilege might be asserted to prevent disclosure of the documents;<br>
  these documents were already known to the Agency, which submitted them.<br>
  The documents were apparently obtained from State files by an Agency<br>
  auditor although the record is not clear exactly how they were obtained.<br>
  Conference call of December 13, 1983. Even if the State did not waive<br>
  the privilege, however, there is some question whether the State should<br>
  be permitted to assert it under the circumstances here, where the State<br>
  has placed at issue the source of its belief that the claims were<br>
  allowable. See, Tera Advanced Services Corporation, GSBCA No. 6713-NRC,<br>
  November 8, 1983. In any event, we do not need to reach the issue here<br>
  of how to treat these internal State memoranda since reliance on the<br>
  documents is not necessary to our decision.</p>
