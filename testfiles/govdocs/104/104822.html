PREMIER ELKHORN COAL COMPANY<BR>



<P>ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI<BR>
TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS<BR>
FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT<BR>



<P>REPLY BRIEF FOR THE UNITED STATES</P>



<P>	The text of the controlling statute governs this case.  To challenge
the coal excise tax that respondents had paid as &quot;erroneously or illegally
assessed,&quot; respondents were re quired to file timely refund claims,
and to allow the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) time to review those claims.
 Had respondents taken those steps and not received relief, they could have
proceeded to court under the Tucker Act and 26 U.S.C. 7422.  But they did
not file their refund claims until mid-1999, and accordingly &quot;[n]o
suit or proceeding shall be maintained in any court for the recovery of&quot;
respondents' taxes with respect to tax years 1996 and before.  26 U.S.C.
7422(a).</P>

<P>	Respondents' attempts to avoid the clear import of that plain language
are unavailing.  No matter how much re spondents wish to emphasize the clarity
and allegedly dis tinctive qualities of the Export Clause, a claim under
that Clause remains a claim that the tax was &quot;erroneously or illegally
assessed,&quot; 26 U.S.C. 7422(a).  Congress has not singled out constitutional
claims for disfavor, but neither has it exempted them from the requirements
that apply to all claims for recovery of taxes erroneously or illegally
as sessed, no matter what the source of the illegality.  Instead, Congress
has required that respondents proceed according to the single, orderly procedure
that the law prescribes- i.e., the tax-refund regime, which offered a fully
adequate remedy (including interest) for respondents' Export Clause claim.</P>

<P>	Respondents seemed to recognize the applicability of the tax-refund
scheme in seeking and receiving a refund for the tax years for which their
claims were timely.  But as to earlier tax years, respondents contend that
the Export Clause guarantees them a second, independent remedy, also under
the Tucker Act but without the procedural re quirements that expressly apply
to all claims for the recov ery of taxes.  Accepting respondents' contentions
would not give a judicial remedy to taxpayers who now lack one, nor would
it give a pre-payment remedy to taxpayers who oth erwise could proceed only
after paying their taxes.  Instead, it would serve only to excuse, without
warrant, respon dents' 21-year failure to assert in any forum a constitutional
violation that they now describe (Br. 24, 25, 49) as so &quot;pat ent&quot;
as to render the tax &quot;indefensible&quot; and &quot;facially uncon stitutional.&quot;
 Respondents can point to no basis in law for the extraordinary and unprecedented
relief they seek, and their untimely claims should be rejected. </P>

<P>A.	The Plain Text Of The Internal Revenue Code Forecloses Respondents'
Contentions</P>

<P>	Although respondents touch on the text of Section 7422(a) only briefly,
in a passage buried deep in their brief (Br. 43-45), the correct answer
to the question presented begins and ends with the unambiguous language
of that statute:  &quot;No suit or proceeding shall be maintained in any
court for the recovery of any internal revenue tax alleged to have been
erroneously or illegally assessed or collected  *  *  *  until a claim for
refund or credit has been duly filed.&quot;  26 U.S.C. 7422(a) (emphases
added).  Under the only possi ble reading of that pellucid and explicit
text, respondents' suit is barred.  Respondents nonetheless urge three grounds
for denying that text its clarity, but none is correct.</P>

<P>	Respondents assert (Br. 42, 44) that the coal excise tax is not a &quot;tax&quot;
within the meaning of Section 7422(a) because the government had no &quot;colorable
claim of authority to have collected the money in the first instance.&quot;
 This Court has already rejected that line of argument, because Section
7422(a) applies by its own terms to sums &quot;alleged to have been  * 
*  *  illegally assessed or collected&quot; as a tax.  Con struing the word
&quot;tax&quot; in a statute that &quot;was in pari ma teria with&quot;
the predecessor of Section 7422(a), this Court confirmed that there is &quot;no
force in the suggestion that [the statute], in speaking of a 'tax,' means
only a legal tax; and that an illegal tax is not a tax, and so does not
fall within the inhibition of the statute.&quot;  Snyder v. Marks, 109 U.S.
189, 192 (1883).  Rather, even (perhaps especially) an illegal tax is still
a tax, and its legality or illegality is to be determined by the process
that begins with a timely refund claim.</P>

<P>	Respondents also suggest (Br. 43-44) that the coal ex cise tax is not
an &quot;internal revenue&quot; tax.  But the dictionary definition that
respondents cite confirms that a tax on &quot;coal from mines located in
the United States,&quot; 26 U.S.C. 4121(a)(1), is an internal revenue tax.
 Cf., e.g., Begier v. IRS, 496 U.S. 53, 55, 60 (1990) (treating an excise
tax as an &quot;internal revenue tax&quot; for purposes of another tax provi
sion); 26 U.S.C. 5005(c)(1) (same).  Respondents offer an inapposite analogy
to the tax invalidated in United States v. United States Shoe Corp., 523
U.S. 360 (1998) (U.S. Shoe), but the Court there did not hold that an unconstitu
tional &quot;Tax  *  *  *  laid on Articles exported&quot; cannot be an
internal-revenue tax as the federal statutes use that term.  Rather, the
Court simply applied an unusual provision of the Harbor Maintenance Tax
(HMT) law, directing that the HMT &quot;be treated as if [it] were a customs
duty&quot; for juris dictional purposes.  Id. at 365 (quoting 26 U.S.C.
4462(f)(2)).  Respondents' argument is further belied by the fact that Section
2411-on which they vigorously rely to support their award of interest-applies
only to judgments for &quot;overpayment in respect of any internal-revenue
tax.&quot;  28 U.S.C. 2411 (emphasis added).  Respondents neglect to explain
why the coal tax would be an internal-revenue tax for purposes of Section
2411 but not Section 7422.1</P>

<P>	Respondents' final textual argument (Br. 45) is that Section 7422(a)'s
explicit coverage of all suits for the recov ery of &quot;any&quot; internal
revenue tax should be read narrowly to avoid &quot;sweep[ing] in questionable
and legally sensitive applications.&quot;  But as this Court recently reemphasized,
&quot;[r]ead naturally, the word 'any' has an expansive meaning, that is,
'one or some indiscriminately of whatever kind.'&quot;  Ali v. Federal Bureau
of Prisons, 128 S. Ct. 831, 835-836 (2008) (quoting United States v. Gonzales,
520 U.S. 1, 5 (1997)).  Unlike in the cases respondents cite (Br. 45), read
ing Section 7422(a) to give the word &quot;any&quot; its ordinary meaning
will not produce unworkable or anomalous results, extend the statute extraterritorially,
or trench upon sover eignty concerns.  In the absence of any textual or
contex tual indicator that would &quot;counteract the effect of&quot; the
&quot;ex pansive modifier[],&quot; the word &quot;any&quot; must be given
its natu ral meaning.  Ali, 128 S. Ct. at 836 n.4; accord id. at 844-845
(Kennedy, J., dissenting).</P>

<P> B.	No Principle Of Statutory Construction Permits Respon dents To
Sever The Refund Requirement From The Statu tory Framework</P>

<P>	Respondents and their amici are altogether incorrect in suggesting that
this case requires the Court to choose be tween applying either the tax-refund
regime, on the one hand, or the Tucker Act, on the other.  The two are in
fact inseparable, and the tax-refund procedure does not &quot;with draw
Tucker Act jurisdiction,&quot; as respondents mistakenly contend.  Br. 25-27.
 To the contrary, if a taxpayer complies with the requirement of submitting
a timely refund claim but does not receive full relief, his remedy is to
sue under Section 7422(a) and the Tucker Act, which supplies the req uisite
jurisdiction and waiver of sovereign immunity.  In deed, Section 7422(a)
echoes the words of the Tucker Act provision that confers concurrent jurisdiction
on the federal district courts.  Compare 26 U.S.C. 7422(a), with 28 U.S.C.
1346(a)(1).</P>

<P>	This Court recognized as much in United States v. A.S. Kreider Co.,
313 U.S. 443 (1941).  The Court held that a claim may be &quot;brought under&quot;
the Tucker Act but still be subject to a shorter statute of limitations
than the six-year &quot;outside limit&quot; for Tucker Act claims.  Id.
at 447.  The In ternal Revenue Code provides several such shorter time limits,
and the Court in A.S. Kreider held that the prede cessor of current 26 U.S.C.
6532(a)(1), which then applied to &quot;proceedings for the recovery of
'internal-revenue tax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed,'&quot;
displaced the Tucker Act's more general six-year limitation period.  313
U.S. at 447-448.  There was no repeal by impli cation, because nothing in
the Tucker Act rules out apply ing less generous procedures to &quot;particular
actions which, because of special considerations, require[] different treat
ment.&quot;  Id. at 447; see U.S. Br. 18-20.</P>

<P>	The tax-refund statute predates the Tucker Act (see Resp. Br. 9 n.5),
and when it was enacted no court had rec ognized a cause of action like
the one respondents seek.  Reading Section 7422(a) to govern that cause
of action, if it exists, therefore would not constitute an implied repeal.
 See United States v. Estate of Romani, 523 U.S. 517, 529- 530 (1998) (presumption
against implied repeals inapplica ble when prior law did not clearly grant
the allegedly re pealed right).  Rather, Section 7422(a) grants a right
of action under the Tucker Act, one respondents could have pursued.  Thus,
the correct inquiry is whether, before in voking Tucker Act jurisdiction,
respondents must comply with the plainly written prerequisites and limitations
set out in Section 7422(a) and its companion provisions, not just the six-year
&quot;outside limit&quot; of 28 U.S.C. 2501.  A.S. Kreider, 313 U.S. at
447.</P>

<P>	Even if the plain language were ambiguous-which it is not-this Court's
cases would confirm that the more spe cific tax-refund procedures control.
 The &quot;better-fitted&quot; procedure for tax claims requires compliance
with Section 7422(a), and the associated time limits, before permitting
a suit under the Tucker Act.  EC Term of Years Trust v. Uni ted States,
127 S. Ct. 1763, 1767 (2007); see U.S. Br. 20-26.  The tax-refund procedure
can provide complete relief; the </P>

<P>requirement to present an administrative claim favors reso lution of
disputes without litigation where possible; and the shorter limitation period
serves the &quot;congressional objec tive [of] providing the Government
with strong statutory protection against stale demands.&quot;  United States
v. Broc kamp, 519 U.S. 347, 353 (1997) (internal quotation marks and citation
omitted).  Respondents offer no &quot;good counter vailing reason,&quot;
EC Term of Years, 127 S. Ct. at 1767, why Congress would have intended to
permit their challenge, and theirs alone, to proceed under the catchall
provisions of the Tucker Act without first complying with the tax-specific
procedures carefully set out, and expressly made exclusive, in Title 26.2
</P>

<P>C.	The Tax-Refund Procedure Is Fully Applicable To Consti tutional Claims</P>

<P>	Respondents also advance the notion (Br. 32-34) that the refund procedure
serves no legitimate function and provides no adequate redress in Export
Clause cases.  That contention is without merit.  The tax-refund procedure
is based on sound policy considerations that apply equally- and neutrally-to
Export Clause claims, to other constitu tional claims, and to other grounds
for challenging the va lidity of a tax.  There is no policy-based justification
for ig noring the plain statutory direction that all efforts to re coup
an illegally assessed tax must proceed in compliance with the tax-refund
framework.</P>

<P>	1.	The tax-refund procedure has been repeatedly up held as an appropriate
way to preserve the taxpayer's right to an adequate remedy for any incorrect
assessment while protecting the government's interest in the orderly admin
istration of the revenue laws and narrowing the scope of any dispute to
be litigated.  See U.S. Br. 24.  Each of those considerations applies with
full force to the coal excise tax, and respondents' contention that their
Export Clause claims are uniquely unsuitable for the tax-refund procedure
is unavailing.</P>

<P>	First, much of respondents' argument proceeds on the premise that export
taxes are as unmistakably prohibited by the Constitution as a 33-year-old
President.  But al though the prohibition on export taxes is clear enough,
what constitutes an export tax in particular circumstances can be a fact-bound
question that the tax-refund procedure can usefully clarify.  In the coal-tax
context, for example, the validity of an Export Clause objection turns in
large part on facts such as whether the coal is in the stream of export
when sold by the producer.  That determination is quite specialized, and
IRS coal-industry specialists re view claims to ensure consistent treatment
of the associ ated technical issues.  See, e.g., I.R.S. Tech. Adv. Mem.
200417005 (Apr. 23, 2004).  Coal may properly be subject to the excise tax
even if it is ultimately exported, if it is not in the stream of export
when first sold.  See ibid. (coal pro ducer sought refund of excise tax
on all coal sold to a do mestic broker, but conceded that some coal was
stockpiled and therefore not in the stream of export).  And, of course,
most domestically produced coal is not exported at all.  Pet. App. 35a.  Plainly, therefore, a taxpayer's refund claim re quires careful
factual examination.</P>



<P>	Second, as this Court has repeatedly recognized, a tax payer who has
already recouped an unconstitutional tax (such as by passing the tax on
to customers) has no consti tutional right to sue for a windfall double
recovery.  Annis ton Mfg. Co. v. Davis, 301 U.S. 337, 350 (1937) (&quot;[T]here
is no denial of constitutional right in requiring the claimant to show,
where it can be shown, that he alone has borne the burden of the invalid
tax and has not shifted it to others.&quot;).  Congress accordingly has
directed claimants seeking a re fund of excise tax to verify that they bore
the burden of the tax or have the consent of the person who did.  26 U.S.C.
6416(a)(1); Ranger Fuel Corp. v. United States, 33 F. Supp. 2d 466, 468
(E.D. Va. 1998).  That issue is suitable for exam ination and resolution
during the administrative tax-refund proceeding.  Cf. McKesson Corp. v.
Division of Alcoholic Beverages &amp; Tobacco, 496 U.S. 18, 47 (1990) (&quot;pass-on&quot;
analysis &quot;entails a highly sophisticated theoretical and fac tual inquiry&quot;).
 And a determination that the claimant has already recovered the allegedly
unconstitutional tax avoids the need to resolve a constitutional question.</P>

<P>	2.  The tax-refund procedure provides full relief to timely claimants
in respondents' position.  Respondents themselves submitted timely refund
claims with respect to tax years 1997 through 1999 and received full refunds
and interest.  In particular, claimants receive interest at a rate exceeding
the federal short-term rate.  26 U.S.C. 6611(a), 6621(a)(1).  </P>

<P>	Respondents assert (Br. 32-33), for the first time, that the tax-refund
remedy is inadequate because it does not provide for consequential damages
and because the interest rate on refunds is too low.  But respondents' own
conduct confirms that those contentions are not credible.  Respon dents
have never sought any consequential damages, see Pet. App. 37a-38a, including
for the period for which they received a refund.  And they seek interest
under the very statute that they claim is inadequate.  See Resp. Br. 49-52;
Resp. C.A. Br. 1-2.  But in any event, this Court's unlawful- tax cases
require no more than a fair chance to obtain a remedy that &quot;prevent[s]
any permanent unlawful depriva tion of property.&quot;  McKesson, 496 U.S.
at 40; see U.S. Br. 39-40.  The refund procedure plainly satisfies that
require ment.3</P>

<P>	The tax-refund regime's broad applicability and full remedy conclusively
refute respondents' accusation that the government adopted that regime as
a means to hold onto- and profit from-illegally collected monies.  The govern
ment does not reap the time value of the taxpayer's money; it pays that
value to the taxpayer as interest.4  That proce dure is more than adequate
to carry out what respondents insist is the Export Clause's prime goal:
 to prevent the federal government from drawing revenue from exports.  Respondents'
inability to obtain relief for tax years before 1997 is attributable, not
to any deficiency in the refund pro cedure, but rather to their failure
to assert their claims in a timely manner.</P>

<P>	3.	The notion that the tax-refund procedure cannot validly redress Export
Clause challenges, or constitutional claims more generally (Resp. Br. 33;
NFIB Br. 11-13), is simply incorrect.  The operative statute requires a
refund or a credit whenever tax is overpaid.  26 U.S.C. 6402(a).  That an
unconstitutional tax statute remains on the books does not compel the IRS
to continue enforcing it; the Exec utive Branch can, and does, decline to
enforce statutes that it concludes are clearly unconstitutional.  See U.S.
Const. Art. II, &sect; 3 (Take Care Clause); Presidential Authority to Decline
to Execute Unconstitutional Statutes, 18 Op. Off. Legal Counsel 199 (1994).5
 Accordingly, the IRS examines constitutional challenges to taxes as it
does other legal ar guments.  See, e.g., IBM Corp. v. United States, 31
Fed. Cl. 500, 502 (1994) (before litigating, IBM presented Export Clause
argument to IRS, which extensively analyzed the issue on the merits and
determined that the tax was consti tutionally defensible), aff'd, 59 F.3d
1234 (Fed. Cir. 1995), aff'd, 517 U.S. 843 (1996).  Indeed, the facts of
this case con firm the efficacy of the refund mechanism for constitutional
claims, because respondents' timely Export Clause claims were successful
before the IRS.  Without any repeal or other action by Congress, or even
any holding of invalidity by an appellate court, the IRS determined that
it would grant refunds of unconstitutionally assessed coal tax.  I.R.S.
Notice 2000-28, 2000-1 C.B. 1116.6</P>

<P>	Furthermore, even if respondents were correct that the IRS would not
have granted timely refund claims for the tax years at issue, there is no
&quot;futility&quot; exception to the all- encompassing sweep of Section
7422.  United States v. Felt &amp; Tarrant Mfg. Co., 283 U.S. 269, 272-273
(1931) (requiring compliance with refund-claim filing requirement notwith
standing lower court's finding &quot;that the filing of a demand which was
certain to be refused was a futile and unneces sary act&quot;).  As this
Court has made clear, &quot;[a]n anticipated rejection of the claim, which
the [tax-refund] statute con templates, is not a ground for suspending its
operation,&quot; because &quot;the condition upon which the consent to suit
is given is defined by the words of the statute,&quot; and &quot;it is not
within the judicial province to read out of the statute the requirement
of its words.&quot;  Id. at 273.</P>

<P>D.	The Constitutionality Of The Tax-Refund Procedure Is Not In Doubt</P>

<P>	The mere fact that a plaintiff pleads a constitutional claim does not
entitle him to sweep aside the procedural limitations that apply to an entire
class of litigants, not just exporters.  Yet that is precisely what respondents
seek to accomplish here.  They argue that Congress's decision to treat Export
Clause challenges the same way it treats other constitutional and statutory
challenges to taxes-per mitting taxpayers to proceed in federal district
court or the Court of Federal Claims only after payment, within a rea sonable
time, and subject to an administrative exhaustion procedure-is constitutionally
dubious because Congress may not tax exports.  That conflation of substance
and pro cedure has no basis in the law.</P>

<P>	1.	Respondents necessarily concede (Br. 34) that even constitutional
claims may become time-barred, and that they are bound at least by the Tucker
Act's six-year outside limit, 28 U.S.C. 2501.  Indeed, if they thought otherwise,
they would have sued to recover nineteen years' worth of coal taxes (since
1978), not three.  See Pet. App. 36a.  And there is no meaningful constitutional
distinction between a six-year time period in which to file suit and a three-year
time period in which to file a refund claim, see 26 U.S.C. 6511(a).  Cf.
Owens v. Okure, 488 U.S. 235, 251 (1989) (ap plying three-year statute of
limitations to constitutional claims under Section 1983); Wilson v. Garcia,
471 U.S. 261, 280 (1985) (same).  Respondents cannot credibly assert that
a three-year limitation period would &quot;weaken or negate the strict prohibitions
of the Export Clause.&quot;  Br. 34-35.  Res pondents therefore can identify
no constitutional doubt cre ated by requiring their Export Claims to meet
the tax-re fund procedure's three-year deadline.</P>

<P>	2.	Their primary quarrel, therefore, is apparently with the refund procedure
itself.  But they offer no legitimate basis for their attack.  Their policy
objections to the refund procedure are unavailing, see pp. 7-12, supra,
and if the requirement to file a refund claim is permissible, it follows
a fortiori that the statutory requirement that a claimant allow the Commissioner
time to review that claim before filing suit is also permissible.  See 26
U.S.C. 6532(a)(1).</P>

<P>	Nor is there any substance to respondents' argument (Br. 29, 34) that
&quot;tax-neutral&quot; limitations on recovery are permissible but &quot;tax-specific&quot;
limitations are not.  Respon dents offer no supporting authority, and there
is none.  The Internal Revenue Code's procedural limitations do not sin
gle out Export Clause claims for uniquely difficult treat ment; they apply
equally to all claims asserting a tax's in validity, under the Constitution
or otherwise.  To the extent neutrality is required, it is clear from nearly
150 years of history that the tax-refund procedure is &quot;Export Clause-
neutral.&quot;</P>

<P>	At bottom, therefore, respondents appear to be object ing (at least
in Export Clause cases) to the very notion of allowing the government to
resolve constitutional chal lenges to taxes after collection.  That objection
is a curious one, because respondents never refused to pay the excise tax
or sought to enjoin it.  Had they sought injunctive relief, the government
could have invoked the tax-injunction bar of 26 U.S.C. 7421, which might
be thought a more appropri ate target of respondents' constitutional objection.
 See pp. 15-17, infra.  But, in reality, respondents concede that they suffered
no irreparable injury warranting prospective re lief, Br. 40 n.27, and the
constitutional cause of action they are asking this Court to recognize is
itself a post-payment remedy.  Indeed, the relief they are seeking is indistin
guishable from what they would have received through the tax-refund procedure,
if only they had timely filed claims for the period in question.</P>

<P>	3.	In any event, respondents overlook the constitu tional authority
for the tax-refund procedure.  Congress has power to determine the terms
under which the United States will be subject to suit, and it has power
to &quot;lay and collect Taxes  *  *  *  and Excises,&quot; U.S. Const.
Art. I, &sect; 8, Cl. 1.  To be sure, as respondents assert, Congress lacks
the power to tax exports.  But that fact alone does not mean that a taxpayer's
mere invocation of the Export Clause must halt the collection of taxes while
the constitutional claim is resolved-on that reasoning, any taxpayer with
an Export Clause objection could unilaterally withhold pay ment of a tax
or fee, even if his objection turns out not to be meritorious.  The Export
Clause has never been held to require such unique treatment, and this Court
should not so construe it now, for two reasons.</P>

<P>	First, respondents fail to recognize that the tax-refund procedure is
a conditional waiver of sovereign immunity.  See United States v. Dalm,
494 U.S. 596, 608-609 (1990).  The constitutional nature of the claim being
asserted pursu ant to that conditional waiver does not justify undoing the
conditions, as the treatment of other constitutional claims illustrates.
 For example, the government lacks power to take private property for public
use without paying just compensation.  Yet a plaintiff who sues for the
constitution ally required compensation must proceed according to the terms
of the United States' waiver of immunity.  See, e.g., John R. Sand &amp;
Gravel Co. v. United States, 128 S. Ct. 750, 753-754 (2008).  Indeed, for
nearly a hundred years until the Tucker Act was enacted, there was no general
waiver of sovereign immunity, and Congress rather than the courts awarded
compensation for takings.  United States v. Mitch ell, 463 U.S. 206, 212-213
(1983).  Similarly, a State's action against the United States pursuant
to the constitutional equal-footing doctrine must proceed according to the
juris dictional limitations of the Quiet Title Act of 1972, including its
time bar.  Block v. North Dakota ex rel. Bd. of Univ. &amp; Sch. Lands,
461 U.S. 273, 286-287 (1983).</P>

<P>	Second, even if the sovereign immunity of the United States were not
at issue, this Court has repeatedly recog nized that federal and state taxing
authorities have an &quot;ex ceedingly strong interest in financial stability,&quot;
and for that reason &quot;it is well established&quot; that those taxing
authorities &quot;need not provide predeprivation process for the exaction
of taxes.&quot;  McKesson, 496 U.S. at 37.  For those reasons, federal law
requires some taxpayers (including excise tax payers) to pay first, and
bars them from seeking prospec tively to enjoin the operation of any tax.
 26 U.S.C. 7421.  &quot;In this manner the United States is assured of prompt
collection of its lawful revenue.&quot;  Enochs v. Williams Pack ing &amp;
Navigation Co., 370 U.S. 1, 7 (1962) (Williams Pack ing).7  And as this
Court has held, that requirement is per fectly legitimate, even as applied
to a taxpayer who claims that the Constitution forbids the federal government
from taxing him.  &quot;[A] suit may not be brought to enjoin the as sessment
or collection of a tax because of the alleged uncon stitutionality of the
statute imposing it.&quot;  Dodge v. Osborn, 240 U.S. 118, 121 (1916).8</P>

<P>	Under those principles, the availability of the refund remedy is a complete
answer to respondents' Export Clause objections.  Had respondents refused
to pay the coal tax and sued to enjoin its collection, they would have been
directed to pay the tax and file a refund claim, and the con stitutional
nature of their objection would not have mat tered in the slightest.  Even
the cases that respondents cite illustrate this point:  Williams Packing
reaffirmed that 26 U.S.C. 7421 limits taxpayers who cannot show irreparable
injury (as respondents cannot, see Resp. Br. 40 n.27) to post-payment remedies.
 See 370 U.S. at 6-7.9  And respon dents' other key case, Leedom v. Kyne,
358 U.S. 184 (1958), permitted nonstatutory judicial review of the plaintiff's
claim before agency proceedings were completed only be cause the plaintiff
had &quot;no other means&quot; to &quot;protect and enforce [its statutory]
right.&quot;  Id. at 190.  What was &quot;central to [the] decision in Kyne
was the  *  *  *  [deprivation] of a meaningful and adequate means of vindicating
its statutory rights&quot;-not, as respondents claim, the agency's exceeding
its authority.  Board of Governors of the Fed. Reserve Sys. v. MCorp Fin.,
Inc., 502 U.S. 32, 43 (1991).  Because re spondents had-but forwent-a &quot;meaningful
and adequate opportunity&quot; to vindicate their own rights under the Export
Clause, Kyne simply has no application here.  Ibid.</P>

<P>	Thus, the Export Clause would not have given respon dents any different
remedy before payment.  It follows, therefore, that after they paid the
tax and stood in precisely the same position as any other eligible refund
claimant, the Export Clause did not entitle them to a separate cause of
action.  Not only should Export Clause claims not be read out of the tax-refund
remedy, the constitutional consider ations discussed above explain why Congress
would want to keep them firmly within the scope of that remedy.  Indeed,
in this context it appears that the only reason respondents can give for
why they should be permitted to proceed on a freestanding Export Clause
cause of action, as opposed to the refund remedy, is that they would not
be time-barred under the former as they are under the latter.  Respon dents'
failure to comply with well-established time limita tions is no basis for
fashioning out of whole cloth a novel and wholly unnecessary alternative
remedy.</P>

<P> E.	The Export Clause Does Not Create An Implied Private  Right Of
Action</P>

<P>	The foregoing discussion establishes that respondents were required
to proceed under the tax-refund statute be fore invoking the trial court's
Tucker Act jurisdiction, be cause the refund procedure affords full relief
for meritori ous and timely constitutional claims and expressly bars all
suits to recover tax overpayments not identified in timely refund claims.
 Thus, respondents' assertion (Br. 8-25) that this Court should recognize
a hitherto-undiscovered implied right of action directly under the Export
Clause is simply beside the point, because any such cause of action would
be subject to the very procedural limitations that respondents seek to evade.
 Even if that were not the case, however, respondents have failed to show
that the Export Clause should be read to create a freestanding constitutional
cause of action.</P>

<P>	1.	Respondents' analysis of the intersection between the Export Clause
and the Tucker Act is flawed in numer ous respects, but it does include
one correct statement:  &quot;Congress cannot change the meaning of the
Constitution through legislation.&quot;  Br. 21.  Yet respondents are arguing
in essence that the effect of the Export Clause is to be de termined according
to a body of law-&quot;money-mandating&quot; analysis-developed not under
the Constitution, but under the Tucker Act.  That argument lacks merit.</P>

<P>	When a claimant sues the United States, it must identify a waiver of
sovereign immunity and a cause of action giving it a right to recover money
damages.  See, e.g., United States v. White Mountain Apache Tribe, 537 U.S.
465, 472- 473 (2003).  The Tucker Act provides the waiver of immu nity (and
the grant of federal jurisdiction), but it does not create a cause of action,
which must instead arise from a source of substantive rights.  Id. at 472.
 A statute creates a right enforceable under the Tucker Act if it &quot;can
fairly be interpreted as mandating compensation by the Federal Government.&quot;
 Mitchell, 463 U.S. at 217 (citations omitted).  That money-mandating analysis
is a method of interpreting federal statutes and regulations to determine
whether Con gress meant them to create substantive rights enforceable in
a Tucker Act suit.  Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487 U.S. 879, 906 n.42 (1988).</P>

<P>	Money-mandating analysis does not remotely provide a sufficient basis
for inferring causes of action directly under the Constitution itself. 
Unlike the statutes and regulations to which the courts apply money-mandating
analysis, the Constitution was not written with the Tucker Act in mind.
 Only a very small number of constitutional provisions can be construed
to create private causes of action of their own force.  The remainder cannot,
and Congress's later enact ment of the Tucker Act did not, and could not,
change that reality.</P>

<P>	Respondents object that the text of the Tucker Act does not distinguish
between constitutional and statutory claims.  But that is unsurprising,
because in both cases the Tucker Act serves the same function-waiving sovereign
immunity and granting jurisdiction to the courts in which the claim may
proceed.  In neither case does the Tucker Act provide a cause of action.
 United States v. Testan, 424 U.S. 392, 398 (1976).  And it is in that respect-determining
whether a cause of action exists-that constitutional and statutory provisions
require different analysis.</P>

<P>	Respondents also point to stray statements in this Court's Tucker Act
decisions equating constitutional, statu tory, and regulatory claims for
purposes of the Tucker Act.  But those decisions properly are read merely
as quoting or paraphrasing the Tucker Act, without applying money- mandating
analysis to every source of substantive rights including the Constitution.
 See, e.g., Mitchell, 463 U.S. at 216.  Indeed, this Court has never held
that a provision of the Constitution confers an express or implied right
of ac tion against the United States based merely on a conclusion that a
constitutional provision is &quot;money-mandating.&quot;  The Constitution
was not at issue in Testan, the first case in the line; nor in the cases
that Testan cited, see 424 U.S. at 400; nor in the cases that follow it,
see, e.g., Mitchell, 463 U.S. at 216-217.  And Testan distinguished cases
concerning an express right of action under the Takings Clause.  See U.S.
Br. 34-35.</P>

<P>	The money-mandating analysis is particularly insuffi cient in the circumstances
of this case.  Congress has pro vided a statutory right of action-the tax-refund
proce dure-through which excise taxpayers may have their Ex port Clause
claims fully vindicated.  Perhaps Congress en acted that procedure because
it perceived the Export Clause to be money-mandating in some sense.  More
likely, Congress found it appropriate to provide a remedy for all illegally
assessed taxes.  But whatever the reason for its creation, the fact of the
remedy's existence makes any in quiry into the money-mandating nature of
the Export Clause irrelevant.  Because a monetary remedy for Export Clause
violations already exists, there is no need to inquire whether such a remedy
must exist, and no basis for infer ring a second, enhanced constitutional
remedy.  This Court has been reluctant to find new Bivens remedies even
for a plaintiff for whom &quot;it is damages or nothing.&quot;  U.S. Br.
36- 37 (quoting Davis v. Passman, 442 U.S. 228, 245 (1979)).  The hardship
of a three-year statute of limitations is hardly a basis for inferring a
cause of action here.</P>

<P>	2.	Nothing in this Court's Export Clause cases contra dicts this analysis
or endorses respondents' theory of a con stitutional cause of action.  In
IBM, of course, the taxpayer filed a refund claim and sued under the tax-refund
statute.  See p. 11, supra.  In U.S. Shoe, a special provision directed
that the HMT be treated not as a tax, but as a &quot;customs duty,&quot;
so this Court harmonized that special provision with the Court of International
Trade's jurisdiction over matters relating to &quot;revenue from imports.&quot;
 523 U.S. at 365-366 (citations omitted).  The Court never discussed the
source of U.S. Shoe's cause of action, which simply was not at issue (and
has not been at issue in subsequent challenges to the HMT brought under
the customs-protest statute).  U.S. Br. 32 &amp; n.10.  The existence of
a cause of action, this Court has often held, is not jurisdictional and
may be assumed.  See Bell v. Hood, 327 U.S. 678, 681-685 (1946) (deciding
juris diction while assuming, but not resolving, the existence of a Bivens
cause of action long before Bivens was decided).  And nonjurisdictional
assumptions of this sort are not pre cedential, let alone binding.  See,
e.g., Will v. Michigan Dep't of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 63 n.4 (1989).10</P>

<P>	If this Court's Export Clause cases give any indication, they suggest
that there is no freestanding constitutional cause of action.  Respondents
argue (Br. 42 n.30) that United States v. New York &amp; Cuba Mail Steamship
Co., 200 U.S. 488 (1906), is off point because the taxpayer pressed its
Export Clause argument by bringing a statu tory claim for a refund, not
a freestanding constitutional claim.  But on respondents' theory, New York
&amp; Cuba Mail would have been decided the opposite way had the tax payer's
complaint simply invoked the Export Clause rather than the refund statute.
 That suggestion is highly implausi ble; it is far more likely that no one
thought of the Export Clause as giving rise to a constitutional cause of
action when the Clause can so readily be enforced by means of the tax-refund
remedy.</P>

<P> F.	Respondents Can Recover Interest Only By Proceeding  Under The
Tax-Refund Statute</P>

<P>	On respondents' view, the procedural limitations that apply to claims
for overpayment of tax do not apply to free standing claims under the Export
Clause-but 28 U.S.C. 2411, the provision awarding interest on judgments
for overpayment of tax, does apply because their &quot;damages&quot; claims,
Pet. App. 37a-38a, are in fact claims for an &quot;over payment&quot; of
&quot;internal revenue tax&quot; within the meaning of Section 2411.11 
In combination, respondents' positions are untenable, because they contradict
the statutory structure, history, and purpose.</P>

<P>	Respondents contend that Section 2411 is a standalone provision, to
be read in isolation and without reference to the tax-refund procedure,
because the refund procedure was enacted long before.  What respondents
overlook is that for the first years of the tax-refund statute, no interest
was available on refunds, but when Congress decided to make interest available,
it enacted parallel provisions:  one for interest on overpayment claims
resolved by a refund, now 26 U.S.C. 6611, and one for interest on overpayment
claims resolved by litigation, now Section 2411.  See Reve nue Act of 1921,
ch. 136, &sect; 1324(a) and (b), 42 Stat. 316.  Those provisions are to
be read in pari materia.  Indeed, Congress has treated the two provisions
as counterparts since their inception, simultaneously amending or re-enact
ing both of them on at least six separate occasions.  See Gov't C.A. Br.
32 n.9.  And when Congress re-codified the Judicial Code, but mistakenly
left out the judgment-inter est provision, it promptly corrected the error,
with the leg islative history of Section 2411 noting Congress's intent to
restore &quot;the provisions  *  *  *  of the former Judicial Code for the
payment of interest on tax refunds.&quot;  H.R. Rep. No. 352, 81st Cong.,
1st Sess. 19 (1949) (emphasis added).</P>

<P>	Section 6611 plainly requires the filing of a timely re fund claim,
because it provides for interest on &quot;any overpay ment&quot; to be paid
in conjunction with a credit or refund of that overpayment, see 26 U.S.C.
6611(b), and no credit or refund can be allowed unless the taxpayer files
a timely refund claim, see 26 U.S.C. 6511(b)(1), 6514(a)(1).  Section 2411
must be given the same reading.  As this Court has recognized, the judgment-interest
statute is not meant to permit taxpayers to circumvent limitations in the
refund- interest statute.  See Bulova Watch Co. v. United States, 365 U.S.
753, 757 (1961) (applying a limitation from the re fund-interest statute
to an award of interest on a judgment, to avoid the &quot;anomalous, nonuniform
and discriminatory re sult&quot; and forum-shopping incentive that would
result from treating the two parallel interest provisions divergently).</P>

<P>	Respondents overread a superficial difference between Section 2411 and
Section 7422(a), the provision of the inte grated framework that precludes
a taxpayer from filing suit at all &quot;until a claim for refund or credit
has been duly filed.&quot;  Respondents claim (Br. 51) that Section 2411
is broader in scope than Section 7422(a) because the latter provision does
not use the word &quot;overpayment.&quot;  But in reality, Section 7422(a)'s
scope is broader than just the few words respon dents quote, and respondents
can identify no substantive difference between the two provisions. </P>

<P>	The inescapable inference from the interconnectedness of the statutory
framework is that Section 2411 grants in terest only to taxpayers who have
pursued a timely refund claim and, if the IRS had granted that claim, would
have been eligible for interest under Section 6611.  Respondents insist
that they are proceeding outside the tax-refund pro cedure, and accordingly,
if they may proceed at all, they must do so without the benefit of Section
2411.</P>

<P>	As for respondents' claim (which was not advanced in their brief in
opposition) that the Export Clause itself grants them interest (Br. 52-53),
the Federal Circuit has correctly rejected that contention.  See United
States Shoe Corp. v. United States, 296 F.3d 1378, 1384-1386 (2002), cert.
denied, 538 U.S. 1056 (2003).  Respondents' analogy to the Takings Clause,
whose guarantee of &quot;just compensa tion&quot; has been construed to
require the payment of interest, is unpersuasive.  See Seaboard Air Line
Ry. Co. v. United States, 261 U.S. 299, 305-306 (1923) (relying on the term
&quot;compensation&quot;).  The Export Clause, unlike the Takings Clause,
does not guarantee a substantive recovery; it pro hibits Congress from taking
certain action.  Even if this Court were to find that prohibition enforceable
through an implied private right of action, a refund would provide con stitutionally
adequate redress for a wrongly exacted tax.  See, e.g., McKesson, 496 U.S.
at 51-52 (stating that &quot;a re fund of the excess taxes paid&quot; would
&quot;satisf[y] the minimum federal requirements&quot;); see also United
States v. Alcea Band of Tillamooks, 341 U.S. 48, 49 (1951) (per curiam)
(referring to the Takings Clause as &quot;[t]he only exception&quot; to
the rule that the United States is not liable for interest without Congress's
express consent).</P>

<P> CONCLUSION</P>

<P>	For the foregoing reasons, and those stated in our open ing brief, the
judgment of the court of appeals should be reversed, and the case remanded
to be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.  </P>

<P>	Respectfully submitted.</P>


<P>PAUL D. CLEMENT<BR>
Solicitor General<BR>


<P>MARCH 2008</P>

<P>1		Respondents' argument would also lead to the absurd result that paying
the coal tax did not make them taxpayers for purposes of the In ternal Revenue
Code, which defines &quot;taxpayer&quot; as &quot;any person subject to
any internal revenue tax.&quot;  26 U.S.C. 7701(14) (emphasis added).  And,
ironically, it would deprive the federal district courts of jurisdic tion
under the Tucker Act to hear the very claims that respondents seek to have
recognized, because those courts' tax jurisdiction covers only actions &quot;for
the recovery of any internal-revenue tax alleged to have been erroneously
or illegally assessed or collected.&quot;  28 U.S.C. 1346(a)(1) (emphasis
added).</P>

<P>2		Amicus Alliance Coal suggests (Br. 10-20) that this Court has rec
ognized such exceptions for other taxes, but the cases it cites are inap
posite.  In several, the taxpayer did submit a claim or its equivalent.
 See Bonwit Teller &amp; Co. v. United States, 283 U.S. 258, 261-262, 264-265
(1931); United States v. Emery, Bird, Thayer Realty Co., 237 U.S. 28, 31
(1915); United States v. Finch, 201 F. 95, 96 (7th Cir. 1912).  Dooley v.
United States, 182 U.S. 222 (1901), concerned a customs duty, not an internal
revenue tax, and Section 7422's predecessor was irrelevant.  And in South
Carolina v. United States, 199 U.S. 437 (1905), this Court mentioned the
tax-refund procedure but did not analyze it at all.  Sev eral of Alliance's
remaining cases merely distinguish between suing the United States and suing
the collector.  That distinction no longer exists.  See 26 U.S.C. 7422(f)(1).</P>

<P>3		Nor is there any constitutional significance to the fact that interest
is computed through a point shortly before the refund check is issued (Resp.
Br. 33 n.23), a provision attributable to the simple fact that once the
amount is computed, issuing a government check takes some little time. 
De minimis non curat lex.  </P>

<P>4		Indeed, if the government's position (in the refund proceedings or
in court) is not substantially justified, the government may have to pay
the taxpayer's attorney's fees and litigation costs.  26 U.S.C. 7430.  The
availability of interest and costs refutes respondents' notion that the
government might tax exports simply as a way of borrowing money un til it
could be refunded.</P>

<P>5		Congress has acknowledged as much, by requiring executive agen cies
to notify Congress when they decide not to defend the constitution ality
of a federal statute &quot;in any judicial, administrative, or other pro
ceeding.&quot;  28 U.S.C. 530D(a)(1)(B)(ii) and (e) (Supp. V 2005) (emphasis
added).</P>

<P>6		The IRS was reviewing coal-tax refund claims in light of this Court's
recent Export Clause decisions when the first plaintiff exer-cised its right
to proceed to court after the expiration of the statutory waiting period.
 Ranger Fuel Corp., 33 F. Supp. 2d at 467-468.</P>

<P>7		If excise taxpayers refuse to pay the tax and as a result receive
certain notices of levy or lien action, they may request a collection- review
administrative hearing (with judicial-review rights), at which they may
dispute the existence or amount of the underlying tax liability if they
have had no prior opportunity to do so.  See 26 U.S.C. 6320, 6330(c)(2)(B)
and (d)(1).</P>

<P>8		Respondents suggest (Br. 47, 49) that there is a distinction between
taxes that are unconstitutional per se (such as a tax on exports) and taxes
that are unconstitutional only if discriminatory.  But this Court has upheld
post-deprivation remedies even with respect to taxes that are altogether
beyond the government's power.  See, e.g., Dodge, 240 U.S. at 119 (tax allegedly
&quot;void for repugnancy to the Constitution&quot;).  And in any event,
taxes that are found unconstitutional because they are discriminatory may
be invalidated-if, for example, the legislature cannot or will not cure
the discrimination retroactively.  See McKesson, 496 U.S. at 40-41; see
also, e.g., Pollock v. Farmers' Loan &amp; Trust Co., 158 U.S. 601, 637
(1895) (striking down income tax on rents from prop erty under the Direct
Tax Clause, before adoption of Sixteenth Amend ment).</P>

<P>9		Williams Packing also held that even if a taxpayer can show irrep
arable injury, it still cannot seek prospective relief unless the gov ernment
acted without &quot;good faith&quot; in assessing the tax.  370 U.S. at
7.  &quot;Only if it is then apparent that, under the most liberal view
of the law and the facts, the United States cannot establish its claim,
may the suit for an injunction be maintained.&quot;  Ibid.  That was not
the case in Wil liams Packing, and it is not the case here.  The taxes at
issue here were for 1994 through 1996.  Pet. App. 9a.  The proper interpretation
of the Export Clause was sufficiently debatable to warrant this Court's
atten tion in 1996 (when IBM was decided), as well as in 1998 (when U.S.
Shoe was decided).  But, of course, even if respondents could have sa tisfied
Williams Packing had they tried to seek injunctive relief, that would not
strengthen their case at this juncture.  To the contrary, the possibility
of obtaining injunctive relief in extraordinary cases is a fur ther reason
why respondents, after making no effort to pursue that av enue and paying
their taxes, may not dismiss the entire tax-refund pro cess as woefully
inadequate simply by emphasizing that the prohibitions of the Export Clause
are emphatic.</P>

<P>10		Nor did the Court address the question in its Compensation Clause
cases, as respondents incorrectly suggest.  The only jurisdictional ques
tion in United States v. Will, 449 U.S. 200 (1980), was whether federal
judges' financial interest in the case affected jurisdiction.  Id. at 211-212
(holding that it did not).  The subsequent decision in United States v.
Hatter, 532 U.S. 557 (2001), did not consider the Federal Circuit's juris
dictional ruling from nine years before, which at that point the govern
ment no longer contested.</P>

<P>11		Respondents seek &quot;damages consisting of a refund,&quot; Pet.
App. 37a- 38a, but insist that other Export Clause plaintiffs should be
permitted to seek consequential damages for Export Clause violations, Br.
32.  Section 2411 is plainly limited to interest on &quot;the amount of
the over payment,&quot; and does not contemplate interest on money damages.<BR>
