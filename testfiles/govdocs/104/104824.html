SUBJECT: Issues and Decision Memorandum: Final Affirmative
Countervailing Duty Determination: Certain Cold-Rolled Carbon
Steel Flat Products from the Republic of Korea
<P>
Summary
<P>
We have analyzed the comments and rebuttal comments of interested parties in the final
determination of the above-mentioned countervailing duty (CVD) investigation covering the
period of investigation (POI), calendar year 2000. As a result of our analysis, we have made
certain modifications to our Notice of Preliminary Affirmative Countervailing Duty
Determination and Alignment of Final Countervailing Duty Determination with Final
Antidumping Duty Determination: Certain Cold-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products from the
Republic of Korea, 67 FR 9685, at 9686 (March 4, 2002) (Preliminary Determination). Below
are the “Methodology and Background Information” and “Analysis of Programs” sections of this
memorandum that describe the decisions made in this CVD investigation with respect to Dongbu
Steel Co., Ltd. (Dongbu), Hyundai Hysco (HYSCO), Pohang Iron & Steel Co., Ltd.1 (POSCO),
and Union Steel Manufacturing Co., Ltd. (Union), the producers/exporters of subject
merchandise covered by this segment of the proceeding. Also below is the “Analysis of
Comments” section in which we discuss the issues raised by interested parties. We recommend
that you approve the positions we have developed below in this memorandum.
<P>
Methodology and Background Information
<P>
I. The Net Subsidy Rate Attributable to Union Steel Manufacturing Co., Ltd. (Union)
<P>
Sections 776(a)(2)(A) and 776(a)(2)(B) of the Act require the use of facts available
when an interested party withholds information that has been requested by the Department of
Commerce (the Department) or when an interested party fails to provide the information
requested in a timely manner and in the form required. As described in the Preliminary
Determination, we found that Union failed to respond to the Department’s questionnaire.
Consequently, we used facts otherwise available. Because Union failed to provide any requested
information, the Department did not consider the application of sections 782(d) and (e) of the
Act.
<P>
Section 776(b) of the Act provides that in selecting from among the facts available, the
Department may use an inference that is adverse to the interests of a party if it determines that a
party has failed to cooperate to the best of its ability. In this investigation, the Department
requested that all producers/exporters in Korea that shipped subject merchandise to the United
States during the POI submit the information requested in our initial questionnaire. However,
Union, a producer/exporter that shipped subject merchandise to the United States during the POI,
did not participate in the investigation.
<P>
The Department finds that by not providing the necessary information specifically
requested by the Department and by failing to participate in any respect in this investigation,
Union has failed to cooperate to the best of its ability. Therefore, in selecting facts available, the
Department determines that an adverse inference is warranted.
<P>
Section 776(b) of the Act states that, when employing an adverse inference, the
Department may rely upon information derived from (1) the petition; (2) a final determination in
a countervailing duty or antidumping investigation; (3) any previous administrative review, new
shipper review, expedited antidumping review, section 753 review; or (4) any other information
placed on the record. See also 19 CFR 351.308(c). As adverse facts available in the Preliminary
Determination, for Union’s net subsidy rate, we used a subsidy rate from Final Affirmative
Countervailing Duty Determination: Stainless Steel Sheet and Strip in Coils from the Republic
of Korea, 64 FR 30636 at 30639 (June 8, 1999), (Sheet and Strip). This rate was used as adverse
facts available for a company in that final determination pursuant to 19 CFR 351.308(c)(ii). This
rate represented a composite of programs used in Korea, based on the adverse inference of a
company’s use of such program. While no comments were raised, we have modified our
preliminary determination.
<P>
The Statement of Administrative Action accompanying the URAA states that information
from the petition and prior segments of the proceeding, as well as other sources, are “secondary
information.” See Statement of Administrative Action, accompany H.R. 5110 (H.R. Doc. No.
193-316) (1994) (SAA), at 870. If the Department relies on secondary information as facts
available, section 776(c) of the Act provides that the Department shall, to the extent practicable,
corroborate such information using independent sources reasonably at its disposal. The SAA
further provides that to corroborate secondary information means that the Department will satisfy
itself that the secondary information to be used has probative value.
<P>
We did not receive any information from Union in this investigation. Therefore, for each
program examined and found to be providing countervailable benefits, unless the record
information made it clear that Union could not have received benefits from the program, we
made the adverse inference that Union benefitted from the program. In each case, our finding
was that the program provided countervailable benefits to the steel industry and in no case did we
determine that the program was tied to the production of subject merchandise. Then, in order to
establish the countervailing duty rate for each of these programs, we examined the companyspecific,
program-specific rates established in this investigation and in the most recent segment
of these proceedings: Certain Steel Products, Plate in Coils, Sheet and Strip, CTL Plate and
Structural Beams. See Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determinations and Final
Negative Critical Circumstances Determinations: Certain Steel Products from Korea, 58 FR
37338, 37339 (July 9, 1993) (Certain Steel Products), Final Negative Countervailing Duty
Determination: Stainless Steel Plate in Coils from the Republic of Korea, 64 FR 15530 (March
31, 1999) (Plate in Coils), Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination: Certain Cut-to-
Length Carbon-Quality Steel Plate from the Republic of Korea, 64 FR 73276 (December 29,
1999), and Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination: Structural Steel Beams from
the Republic of Korea, 65 FR 41051 (July 3, 2000) (Structural Beams). We considered these
additional proceedings because, as noted above, each of the considered programs was available
to the steel industry and none of the programs were tied to the production of a particular steel
product. As adverse facts available, we selected the highest company-specific, program-specific
rate available from these sources. Based on this approach, we have established a total ad
valorem rate of 3.43 percent as adverse facts available for Union.
<P>
II. Subsidies Valuation Information
<P>
A. Allocation Period
<P>
Under section 351.524(d)(2) of the CVD Regulations, we will presume the allocation
period for non-recurring subsidies to be the average useful life (AUL) of renewable physical
assets for the industry concerned, as listed in the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) 1977 Class
Life Asset Depreciation Range System, as updated by the Department of Treasury. The
presumption will apply unless a party claims and establishes that these tables do not reasonably
reflect the AUL of the renewable physical assets for the company or industry under investigation,
and the party can establish that the difference between the company-specific or country-wide
AUL for the industry under investigation is significant.
<P>
In this investigation, no party to the proceeding has claimed that the AUL listed in the
IRS tables does not reasonably reflect the AUL of the renewable physical assets for the firm or
industry under investigation. Therefore, in accordance with section 351.524(d)(2) of the CVD
Regulations, in the Preliminary Determination, we used an allocation period of 15 years, which is
the average useful life corresponding to the steel industry, as indicated by the IRS depreciation
tables. See 67 FR at 9686. No party contested the Department’s use of a 15-year AUL in the
Preliminary Determination. Therefore, in accordance with section 351.524(d)(2) of the CVD
regulations, we have allocated all non-recurring subsidies over 15 years.
<P>
B. Benchmarks for Loans and Discount Rate
<P>
Benchmarks for Short-term Financing:
<P>
In the Preliminary Determination, for those programs requiring the application of a shortterm
won-denominated interest rate benchmark, in accordance with section 351.505(a)(2)(iv) of
the CVD regulations, we used as our benchmark a company-specific weighted-average interest
rate for commercial won-denominated loans outstanding during the POI. See 67 FR at 9687.
Benchmarks for Long-Terms Loans and Discount Rates:
<P>
During the POI, respondent companies had both won-denominated and foreign currencydenominated
long-term loans outstanding which had been received from government-owned
banks, Korean commercial banks, overseas banks, and foreign banks with branches in Korea.
<P>
Some loans were received prior to 1992. In the 1993 investigation of Certain Steel Products, and
in Structural Beams, the Department determined that, through 1991, the Government of Korea
(GOK) influenced the practices of lending institutions in Korea and controlled access to overseas
foreign currency loans. In both investigations, we determined that the best indicator of a market
rate for long-term loans in Korea was the three-year corporate bond rate on the secondary market.
In the Preliminary Determination, we used the three-year corporate bond rate as our benchmark
to calculate the benefits which the respondent companies received from direct foreign currency
loans and domestic foreign currency loans obtained prior to 1992, and still outstanding during the
POI. As we received no comments on this issue we will continue to follow our methodology
used in Preliminary Determination.
<P>
In the Plate in Coils, Sheet and Strip, and in the Benchmark Interest Rates and Discount
Rates section of the Issues and Decision Memorandum that accompanied Structural Beams, we
examined the GOK’s direction of credit policies for the period 1992 through 1998. Based on
information gathered during the course of those investigations, the Department also determined
that the GOK controlled directly or indirectly the lending practices of most sources of credit in
Korea between 1992 and 1998. In the current investigation, based upon these earlier findings
and updated information, we determine that the GOK still exercised substantial control over
lending institutions in Korea during the POI.
<P>
In the previous investigations the Department determined that the GOK controlled access
to foreign securities and direct foreign loans. Therefore, the Department found that foreign
securities and foreign loans from outside of Korea were directed by the GOK and countervailed.
See Plate in Coils, 64 Fr 15533. During the course of the instant investigation the Department
collected additional information on the law and functioning of foreign securities and direct
foreign loans. The Department finds in this final determination that foreign securities and direct
foreign loans given after April 1999 are not countervailable and thus now represent an
appropriate benchmark. For further discussion of the Department’s finding, see the Direction of
Credit section below.
<P>
Based on our findings on this issue in prior investigations, as well as in the instant
investigation, discussed below in the “Direction of Credit” section of this notice, we are using the
following benchmarks to calculate respondents’ long-term loans obtained since 1992, and which
are still outstanding during the POI:
<P>
(1) For countervailable, foreign-currency denominated long-term loans, we used, where
available, the company-specific weighted-average foreign-denominated interest rates on the
companies’ loans from foreign bank branches in Korea, foreign securities and direct foreign
loans received after April 1999. If such a benchmark was not available, then, as facts available,
we had to rely on the lending rates as reported by the IMF’s International Financial Statistics
Yearbook.
<P>
(2) For countervailable won-denominated long-term loans, where available, we used the
company-specific corporate bond rate on the companies’ won denominated public and private
bonds. We note that this benchmark is based on the decision in Plate in Coils, 64 FR 15530,
15531, in which we determined that the GOK did not control the Korean domestic bond market
after 1991, and that domestic bonds may serve as an appropriate benchmark interest rate. Where
unavailable, we used the national average of the yields on three-year won-denominated corporate
bonds as reported by the Bank of Korea (BOK). We note that the use of the three-year corporate
bond rate from the BOK follows the approach taken in Plate in Coils, 64 FR 15530, 15532, in
which we determined that, absent company-specific interest rate information, the wondenominated
corporate bond rate is the best indicator of a market rate for won-denominated longterm
loans in Korea.
<P>
We are also using, where available, the company-specific won-denominated corporate
bond rate as the discount rate to determine the benefit from non-recurring subsidies received
between 1992 and 2000. Where unavailable, we are using the national average of the three-year
Korean won corporate bond rate.
<P>
C. Treatment of Subsidies Received by Trading Companies
<P>
We required responses from trading companies with respect to the export subsidies under
investigation because the subject merchandise may be subsidized by means of subsidies provided
to both the producer and the exporter of the subject merchandise. All subsidies conferred on the
production and exportation of subject merchandise benefit the subject merchandise even if it is
exported to the United States by an unaffiliated trading company rather than by the producer
itself. Therefore, the Department calculates countervailing duty rates on the subject merchandise
by cumulating subsidies provided to the producer with those provided to the exporter. See 19
CFR 351.525.
<P>
During the POI, Dongbu exported the subject merchandise to the United States through
one trading company, Dongbu Corporation (Dongbu Corp). POSCO exported subject
merchandise through two trading companies, Daewoo International Corporation (Daewoo) and
POSCO Steel Service & Sales Co., Ltd. (Posteel). Dongbu Corp, Daewoo, and Posteel
responded to the Department’s questionnaires with respect to the export subsidies under
investigation.
<P>
Under 19 CFR 351.107, when subject merchandise is exported to the United States by a
company that is not the producer of the merchandise, the Department may establish a
“combination” rate for each combination of an exporter and supplying producer. However, as
noted in the “Explanation of the Final Rules” (the Preamble), there may be situations in which it
is not appropriate or practicable to establish combination rates when the subject merchandise is
exported by a trading company. In such situations, the Department will make exceptions to its
combination rate approach on a case-by-case basis. See Antidumping Duties; Countervailing
Duties; Final Rule, 62 FR 27296, 27303 (May 19, 1997).
<P>
In the Preliminary Determination, we determined that it is not appropriate to establish
combination rates. This determination is based on two main facts. First, the majority of
subsidies conferred upon the subject merchandise were received by the producers. Second, the
difference in the levels of subsidies conferred upon individual trading companies with regard to
subject merchandise is insignificant. Thus, combination rates would serve no practical purpose
because the calculated subsidy rate for any of the producers and a combination of any of the
trading companies would effectively be the same rate. Instead, we continue to calculate rates for
the producers of subject merchandise that include the subsidies received by the trading
companies. To reflect those subsidies that are received by the exporters of the subject
merchandise in the calculated ad valorem subsidy rate, we used the following methodology: for
each of the trading companies, we calculated the benefit attributable to the subject merchandise.
<P>
In each case, we determined the benefit received by the trading companies for each of the export
subsidies. Next we weighted the average of the benefit amounts by the relative share of each
trading company’s value of exports of the subject merchandise to the United States to the relative
share of direct exports of the producer of subject merchandise to the United States. These
calculated ad valorem subsidies were then added to the subsidies calculated for the producers of
subject merchandise. Thus, for each of the programs below, the listed ad valorem subsidy rate
includes countervailable subsidies received by both the producing and trading companies.
<P>
Analysis of Programs
<P>
I. Programs Conferring Subsidies
<P><a name="IA"></a>
A. <font color="#800000"><b>GOK Directed Credit</b></font>
<P>
We determined in Plate in Coils that the provision of long-term loans via the GOK’s
direction of credit policies was specific to the Korean steel industry through 1991 within the
meaning of section 771(5A)(D)(iii) of the Act, and resulted in a financial contribution, within the
meaning of sections 771(5)(E)(ii) and 771(5)(D)(i) of the Act, respectively.
<P>
In Plate in Coils, the Department also determined that the GOK continued to control
directly and indirectly the lending practices of most sources of credit in Korea through 1997. In
CTL Plate, the Department continued to find that the GOK’s regulated credit from domestic
commercial banks and government-controlled banks such as the Korea Development Bank
(KDB) was specific to the steel industry. In the final determination of CTL Plate, the
Department determined that the GOK continued to control, directly and indirectly, the lending
practices of sources of credit in Korea in 1998. See CTL Plate, 64 FR at 73180. Further, the
Department determined in that investigation that these regulated loans conferred a benefit on the
producers of the subject merchandise to the extent that the interest rates on these loans were less
than the interest rates on comparable commercial loans within the meaning of section
771(5)(E)(ii) of the Act. In 1999 Sheet and Strip, we determined that the GOK continued to
control credit through 1999. See Final Results and Partial Rescission of Countervailing Duty
Administrative Review: Stainless Steel Sheet and Strip in Coils From the Republic of Korea, 67
FR 1964 (January 15, 2002) (1999 Sheet and Strip). We provided the GOK with the opportunity
to present new factual information concerning the government’s credit policies in 2000, the POI,
which we would consider along with our finding in the prior investigations. Respondents did not
provide any new information on the GOK lending policies for domestic banks. Therefore, based
upon the determinations in these cited cases, we continue to find lending from domestic banks
and from government-owned banks such as the KDB to be countervailable.
<P>
With respect to foreign sources of credit, in Plate in Coils and Sheet and Strip, we
determined that access to foreign currency loans from Korean branches of foreign banks (i.e.,
branches of U.S. and foreign-owned banks operating in Korea) did not confer a benefit to the
recipient as defined by section 771(5)(E)(ii) of the Act, and, as such, credit received by the
respondent from these sources was found not countervailable. This determination was based
upon the fact that credit from Korean branches of foreign banks was not subject to the
government’s control and direction. Thus, in Plate in Coils and Sheet and Strip, we determined
that respondent’s loans from these banks could serve as an appropriate benchmark to establish
whether access to regulated foreign sources of credit conferred a benefit on respondents. As
such, lending from this source is not countervailable, and, where available, loans from Korean
branches of foreign banks continue to serve as an appropriate benchmark to establish whether
access to regulated foreign currency loans from domestic banks confers a benefit upon
respondents.
<P>
We collected certain information during this investigation regarding access to direct
foreign loans and foreign securities. We verified that with respect to access to direct foreign
loans (i.e., loans from offshore banks) and the issuance of offshore foreign securities by Korean
companies, the GOK has replaced the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA), with the
Foreign Exchange Transaction Act (FETA). Under FEMA, companies seeking direct foreign
loans or foreign securities were required to get approval from the GOK. Under this scheme we
found that the GOK controlled access to these type of lending activities. However, in April
1999, when FETA came into effect, the positive approval system was replaced with a negative
system. Under FETA, a company must notify the Ministry of Finance and Economy (MOFE) of
any foreign exchange transaction but it does not require approval. We verified that companies no
longer need approval from the GOK to access foreign loans or to issue foreign securities. We
therefore find that any foreign security and direct foreign loans received after April 1999 are not
countervailable and, where available, will serve as an appropriate benchmark.
<P>
Dongbu, HYSCO, and POSCO received long-term fixed and variable rate loans from
GOK owned/controlled institutions that were outstanding during the POI. In order to determine
whether these GOK-directed loans conferred a benefit, we compared the interest rates on the
directed loans to the benchmark interest rates detailed in the “Subsidies Valuation Information”
section of this notice.
<P>
For variable-rate loans, the repayment schedules of these loans did not remain constant
during the lives of the respective loans. Therefore, we have calculated the benefit from these
loans using the Department’s variable rate methodology.
<P>
In the Preliminary Determination at 9688, we calculated a benefit for countervailable
fixed-rate loans using the “grant equivalent” methodology as described in section 351.505(c)(3)
of the CVD Regulations. Regarding the calculation of the benefit on countervailable, fixed-rate
loans, in past cases the Department has employed the “grant equivalent” methodology, as
described in section 351.505(c)(3) of the CVD Regulations, when the government-provided loan
and the comparison loan have dissimilar grace periods or maturities, or where the repayment
schedules have different shapes (e.g., declining balance versus annuity style). See, e.g., Sheet
and Strip, CTL Plate, and H-Beams.
<P>
In this final determination, the Department is revising its application of the grant
equivalent methodology discussed in 351.505(c)(3) of the CVD Regulations. We note that
section 351.505(c)(2) of the CVD Regulations states that the Department “will normally
calculate the subsidy amount to be assigned to a particular year by calculating the difference in
interest payments for that year, (i.e., the difference between the interest paid by the firm in that
year on the government-provided loan and the interest the firm would have paid on the
comparison loan).” We also note that, in reference to paragraph (c)(2), the Preamble of the
Department’s CVD Regulations states that in situations where the benefit from a long-term, fixed
rate loan stems solely from a concessionary interest rate, it is not necessary to engage in the grant
equivalent methodology. See 63 FR at 65369. Thus, the CVD Regulations and the Preamble
direct the Department to default to a simple comparison of interest payments made during the
POR when calculating the benefit from a long-term, fixed rate loan.
<P>
The Preamble goes on to describe those situations in which the Department shall deviate
from the “simple, default methodology,” and instead employ the grant equivalent methodology.
The Preamble states that, “[b]ecause a firm may derive a benefit from special repayment terms, in
addition to any benefit derived from a concessional interest rate,” the Department will calculate
the benefit using the “grant equivalent” methodology. See 63 FR at 65369.
There is no information on the record that indicates that the companies derived a benefit
from any special repayment terms (i.e., abnormally long grace periods or maturities, etc.) on its
long-term, fixed-rate loans. Therefore, in accordance with section 351.505(c)(2) of the CVD
Regulations, we are calculating the benefit that Dongbu, HYSCO, and POSCO received on their
long-term, fixed-rate loans by comparing the amount of interest paid on the loan during the POI
to the amount of interest that would have been paid during the POI on a comparable, commercial
loan.
<P>
Therefore, to calculate a benefit we used the above mentioned methodology, and summed
the benefit amounts from all countervailable loans. We then divided the total benefit by the
respective company’s total f.o.b. sales value during the POI. On this basis, we determine the net
countervailable subsidy to be 0.10 percent ad valorem for Dongbu, 0.25 percent ad valorem for
HYSCO, and 0.05 percent ad valorem for POSCO.
<P><a name="IB"></a>
B. <font color="#800000"><b>GOK Infrastructure Investment at Kwangyang Bay Through 1991</b></font>
<P>
In Certain Steel Products, the Department investigated the GOK’s infrastructure
investments at Kwangyang Bay over the period 1983-1991. We determined that the GOK’s
provision of infrastructure at Kwangyang Bay was countervailable because we found POSCO to
be the predominant user of the GOK’s investments. The Department has consistently held that a
countervailable subsidy exists when benefits under a program are provided, or are required to be
provided, in law or in fact, to a specific enterprise or industry or group of enterprises or
industries. See Certain Steel Products, 58 FR at 37346.
<P>
In the Preliminary Determination, we found that the GOK’s infrastructure investments at
Kwangyang Bay over the period 1983-1991 were countervailable. No new factual information or
evidence of changed circumstances has been provided to the Department with respect to the
GOK’s infrastructure investments at Kwangyang Bay over the period 1983-1991. Therefore, we
continue to determine that POSCO benefits from the GOK’s investments during the POI. To
calculate the benefit from these grants, we relied on the calculations performed in the 1993
investigation of Certain Steel Products, which were placed on the record of this investigation by
POSCO.
<P>
To calculate the benefit conferred during the POI, we applied the Department’s standard
grant methodology and allocated the GOK’s infrastructure investments over a 15-year allocation
time period. See the allocation period discussion under the “Subsidies Valuation Information”
section, above. Using the 15 year allocation period, POSCO continues to receive benefits under
this program from GOK investments made during the years 1986 through 1991. To calculate the
benefit from these grants, we used as our discount rate the three-year corporate bond rate on the
secondary market as used in Certain Steel Products. We then summed the benefits received by
POSCO during the POI from each of the GOK’s yearly investments over the period 1986-1991.
We then divided the total benefit attributable to the POI by POSCO’s total f.o.b. sales for the
POI. Accordingly, the net subsidy under the GOK’s infrastructure investments at Kwangyang
Bay over the period 1986-1991 is 0.15 percent ad valorem for POSCO for the POI.
<P><a name="IC"></a>
C. <font color="#800000"><b>Research and Development (R&amp;D)</b></font>
<P>
The GOK, through the Ministry of Commerce, Industry, and Energy (MOCIE), Ministry
of Science and Technology (MOST), the Ministry of Environment (MOE), and the Ministry of
Construction and Transportation (MOCAT), provides R&amp;D grants to support numerous projects
undertaken by the steel industry.
<P>
These grants are designed to foster the development of efficient technology for industrial
development. A company may participate in this program in several ways: (1) a company may
perform its own R&amp;D project, (2) it may participate through the Korea New Iron and Steel
Technology Research Association (KNISTRA), which is an association of steel companies
established for the development of new iron and steel technology, and/or (3) a company may
participate in another company’s R&amp;D project and share R&amp;D costs, along with funds received
from the GOK. To be eligible to participate in this program, the applicant must meet the
qualifications set forth in the basic plan and must perform R&amp;D as set forth under the Notice of
Industrial Basic Technology Development. Upon completion of the R&amp;D project, the
participating company must repay 50 percent of the R&amp;D grant (30 percent in the case of Small
and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) established within 7 years) to the GOK, in equal payments over
a five-year period. If the R&amp;D project is not successful, the company must repay the full amount.
In CTL Plate, we determined that this program was countervailable. See CTL Plate, 64 FR
73185. No new factual information or evidence of changed circumstances has been provided to
the Department with respect to this program. Therefore, we continue to determine that this
program is countervailable.
<P>
To determine the benefit from the grants received through KNISTRA, we first calculated
the percent of each company’s contribution to KNISTRA and applied that percentage to the
GOK’s contribution for each R&amp;D project. We then summed the grants received by each
company through KNISTRA and divided the amount by each company’s respective total f.o.b.
sales. To determine the benefit from the grants provided directly to the companies, we divided
the amount of the grant by each company’s respective total f.o.b. sales. Based upon this
methodology, we determine that POSCO received a countervailable subsidy of 0.08 percent ad
valorem and that Dongbu received a countervailable subsidy of less than 0.005 percent ad
valorem. HYSCO did not use this program.
<P><a name="ID"></a>
D. <font color="#800000"><b>Provision of Land at Asan Bay</b></font>
<P>
In the instant investigation and in CTL Plate, petitioners alleged that the GOK provided
land at Asan Bay to the steel industry for less than adequate remuneration. The GOK’s overall
development plan is published every 10 years and describes the nationwide land development
goals and plans for the balanced development of the country. Under these plans, the Ministry of
Construction and Transportation (MOCAT) prepares and updates its Asan Bay Area Broad
Development Plan. The Korea Land Development Corporation (Koland) is a government
investment corporation that is responsible for purchasing, developing, and selling land in the
industrial sites.
<P>
The Asan Bay area was designated as an Industrial Site Development Area in December
1979. The Asan Bay area consists of five development sites, (1) Kodai, (2) Wanjung, (3)
Woojung, (4) Poseung, and (5) Bukok. Although Wanjung and Woojung are within the Asan
National Industrial Estate, those properties are not owned by Koland. In CTL Plate, we found
that steel companies received price discounts on purchases of land at Asan Bay, and found this
program countervailable. See CTL Plate, 64 FR 73184.
<P>
We verified that the GOK, in setting the price per square meter for land at the Kodai
industrial estate, removed the ten percent profit component form the price. Therefore, we
determine that the exemption from the profit provides a benefit to Dongbu. We then calculated
this ten percent price discount by the number of square meters purchased by Dongbu. In addition
to this price discount, the GOK provided an adjustment to Dongbu’s final payment to account for
“interest earned” by the company for pre-payments. Companies purchasing land at Asan Bay
must make payments on the purchase and development of the land before the final settlement.
The GOK provided a financial contribution to Dongbu under section 771(5)(D)(i) of the Act
when it refunded the interest earned on the advanced payments. This interest earned refund is
specific to Dongbu under section 771(5A)(D)(iii)(I) of the Act, as being limited to Dongbu.
Therefore, we find that this additional credit on the final payment made by the GOK to Dongbu
also provides a countervailable benefit to the company. The land price discount and the interest
earned refund are non-recurring subsidies.
<P>
Under section 351.524(b)(2) of the CVD Regulations, non-recurring benefits which are
less than 0.5 percent of the company’s relevant sales are expensed in the year of receipt. We
performed the 0.5 percent test, and we find that the land price discount and the interest earned
refund exceeded 0.5 percent of the sales for the respective year; therefore, to calculate the benefit
conferred during the POI on the land price discount and the interest earned refund, we applied the
Department’s standard grant methodology and allocated the benefit provided by this program
over a 15-year allocation time period. See the allocation period discussion under the “Subsidies
Valuation Information” section, above. We then divided the total benefit attributable to the POI
by Dongbu’s total f.o.b. sales for the POI. On this basis, we determine a net countervailable
subsidy of 0.47 percent ad valorem for the POI.
<P>

of Comments” section, below.

E. <font color="#800000"><b>POSCO’s Exemption of Bond Requirement from Port Use at Asan Bay</b></font>
<P>
As noted above, the GOK has developed industrial estates at Asan Bay. In CTL Plate, we
determined that the GOK built port berths #1, #2, #3, and #4 in the Poseung area. In September
1997, POSCO signed a three-year lease agreement with the Inchon Port Authority (IPA) for the
exclusive use of port berth #1, which the GOK constructed. The GOK also entered into a lease
agreement in 1997 for the exclusive use of port berths #2, #3, and #4, with a consortium of six
companies. The consortium of companies was required to purchase bonds, which the GOK
would repay without interest after the lease expired in 10 years. However, POSCO was not
required to purchase a bond for the exclusive use of port berth #1.
<P>
In CTL Plate, we found this program countervailable. See CTL Plate, 64 FR 73183-
73184. We determined that the waiver of the bond purchase was only provided to POSCO, and
was therefore specific under section 771(5A)(D) of the Act. In addition, we determined that the
GOK’s waiver of the bond purchase requirement for the exclusive use of port berth #1 by
POSCO conferred a financial contribution under section 771(5)(D)(ii) of the Act, because the
GOK foregoes collecting revenue that it normally would collect. We also determined that
because the GOK had to repay the bonds at the end of the lease term, the bond purchase waiver is
equivalent to an interest free loan for three years, the duration of the lease. During verification
we were informed that POSCO made an annual renewal of its lease. See June 17, 2002,
Memorandum to Melissa G. Skinner, Director: Verification Report for Pohang Iron & Steel Co.,
Ltd. (POSCO), Pohang Coated Steel Co., Ltd. (POCOS), and POSCO Steel Service & Sales Co.,
Ltd. (POSTEEL) in the Countervailing Duty Investigation of Certain Cold-Rolled Carbon Steel
Flat Products from Korea at page 6, (POSCO’s Verification Report). No new factual information
or evidence of changed circumstances has been provided to the Department with respect to this
program. Therefore, we continue to find this program countervailable.
<P>
To determine the benefit from this program, we treated the amount of the bond waived as
a long-term interest-free loan. We then applied the methodology provided for in section
351.505(c)(4) of the CVD Regulations for a long-term fixed rate loan, and compared the amount
of interest that should have been paid during the POI on the interest free loan to the amount of
interest that would have been paid based upon the interest rate on a comparable wondenominated
benchmark loan. We then divided the benefit by the company’s total f.o.b. sales.
<P>
On this basis, we determine the net countervailable subsidy to be less than 0.005 percent ad
valorem for POSCO.
<P><a name="IF"></a>
F. <font color="#800000"><b>Investment Tax Credits</b></font>
<P>
Under Korean tax laws, companies in Korea are allowed to claim investment tax credits
for various kinds of investments. If the investment tax credits cannot all be used at the time they
are claimed, then the company is authorized to carry them forward for use in subsequent years.
Until December 28, 1998, these investment tax credits were provided under the Tax Reduction
and Exemption Control Act (TERCL). On that date TERCL was replaced by the Restriction of
Special Taxation Act (RSTA). Pursuant to this change in the law, investment tax credits
received after December 28, 1998, were provided under the authority of RSTA.
During the POI, Dongbu earned or used the following tax credits for: (1) Investments in
Equipment to Develop Technology and Manpower (RSTA Article 11, previously TERCL Article
10); (2) Investments in Productivity Increasing Facilities (RSTA Article 24, previously TERCL
Article 25); (3) Investments in Specific Facilities (RSTA Article 25, previously TERCL Article
26); and (4) Equipment Investment to Promote Worker’s Welfare (RSTA Article 94, previously
TERCL Article 88).
<P>
POSCO used the following tax credits during the POI: (1) Investments in Productivity
Increasing Facilities (RSTA 24); and (2) Investments in Specific Facilities (RSTA 25). In
addition, POSCO earned a tax credit under Investments in Equipment to Develop Technology
and Manpower (RSTA 11), but did not receive a countervailable benefit during the POI from this
tax credit.
<P>
HYSCO had outstanding investment tax credits during the POI. However, due to the net
tax loss for the income tax return filed during the POI, the company could not use and did not
claim any investment tax credits during the POI.
<P>
If a company invested in foreign-produced facilities (i.e., facilities produced in a foreign
country), the company received a tax credit equal to either three or five percent of its investment.
However, if a company invested in domestically-produced facilities (i.e., facilities produced in
Korea), it received a 10 percent tax credit. Under the tax credit for Equipment Investment to
Promote Worker’s Welfare, a tax credit could only be claimed if a company used domestic
machines and materials. Under section 771(5A)(C) of the Act, a program that is contingent upon
the use of domestic goods over imported goods is specific, within the meaning of the Act. We
determined that these investment tax credits constituted import substitution subsidies under
section 771(5A)(C) of the Act in CTL Plate, because Korean companies received a higher tax
credit for investments made in domestically-produced facilities. In addition, because the GOK
forwent the collection of tax revenue otherwise due under this program, we determined that a
financial contribution is provided under section 771(5)(D)(ii) of the Act. The benefit provided
by this program was a reduction in taxes payable. Therefore, we determined that this program
was countervailable in CTL Plate. See CTL Plate at 73182.
<P>
We verified that changes have been made in the manner in which these investment tax
credits are determined. Pursuant to amendments made to TERCL which occurred on April 10,
1998, the distinction between investments in domestic and imported goods was eliminated for
the tax credits for Investments in Equipment to Develop Technology and Manpower (RSTA 11),
Investments in Productivity Increasing Facilities (RSTA 24), and Investments in Specific
Facilities (RSTA 25). We verified that, prior to April 10, 1998, the tax credit for these
investments was ten percent for domestic-made facilities and three percent for foreign-made
facilities. However, for investments made after April 10, 1998, there is no difference between
domestic-made and foreign-made facilities. The current tax credit is five percent for all of these
investments.
<P>
Because the distinction between investments in domestic and foreign-made goods was
eliminated for investments made after April 10, 1998, we determine the tax credits received
pursuant to these investment programs for investments made after April 10, 1998 to be no longer
countervailable. However, companies can still carry forward and use the tax credits for
investments earned under the countervailable aspects of the TERCL program before the April 10,
1998 amendment to the tax law. In addition, the tax credits for Equipment Investment to
Promote Workers’ Welfare (RSTA 94) are still only available for companies using domestic
machines and materials. Therefore, we continue to find the use of investment tax credits earned
on Equipment Investment to Promote Workers’ Welfare countervailable. We also continue to
find countervailable the use of investment tax credits earned on investments made before April
10, 1998, under the other three investment tax programs.
<P>
We verified that the tax credits earned by Dongbu for Investments in Equipment to
Develop Technology and Manpower (RSTA 11), Investments in Productivity Increasing
Facilities (RSTA 24), and Investments in Specific Facilities (RSTA 25) were not based on a tax
credit differential between purchasing domestic facilities and imported facilities. In addition, we
verified that the tax credit earned during the POI for Equipment Investment to Promote Workers’
Welfare (RSTA 84) was not used to reduce taxes payable during the POI because the entire tax
credit was carried forward to future years. Therefore, we determine that Dongbu did not benefit
from this program during the POI.
<P>
POSCO did use investment tax credits under this program that originated from tax credits
earned based upon the differential between purchasing domestic facilities and imported facilities.
To calculate the benefit from these investment tax credits, we examined the amount of tax credits
POSCO deducted from its taxes payable for the 1999 fiscal year income tax return, which was
filed during the POI. We first determined the amount of the tax credits claimed which were
based upon investments in domestically-produced facilities. We then calculated the additional
amount of tax credits received by the company because it earned tax credits of 10 percent on such
investments instead of a three or five percent tax credit. Next, we calculated the amount of the
tax savings earned through the use of these tax credits during the POI and divided that amount by
POSCO’s total f.o.b. sales during the POI. On this basis, we determine a net countervailable
subsidy of 0.35 percent ad valorem for POSCO.

G. <font color="#800000"><b>Reserve for Export Loss – Article 16 of the TERCL</b></font>
<P>
Under Article 16 of the TERCL, a domestic person engaged in a foreign-currency earning
business can establish a reserve amounting to the lesser of one percent of foreign exchange
earnings or 50 percent of net income for the respective tax year. Losses accruing from the
cancellation of an export contract, or from the execution of a disadvantageous export contract,
may be offset by returning an equivalent amount from the reserve fund to the income account.
Any amount that is not used to offset a loss must be returned to the income account and taxed
over a three-year period, after a one-year grace period. All of the money in the reserve is
eventually reported as income and subject to corporate tax either when it is used to offset export
losses or when the grace period expires and the funds are returned to taxable income. The
deferral of taxes owed amounts to an interest-free loan in the amount of the company’s tax
savings. This program is only available to exporters. We verified that this program was
terminated on April 10, 1998, and no new funds could be placed in this reserve after January 1,
1999. However, Dongbu still had an outstanding balance in this reserve during the POI. Dongbu
Corp., a trading company used by Dongbu also had an outstanding balance in this reserve during
the POI. HYSCO returned the remaining balance of this reserve fund to income during the POI.
<P>
In Sheet and Strip, 64 FR 30636, 30645, we determined that this program constituted an
export subsidy under section 771(5A)(B) of the Act because the use of the program is contingent
upon export performance. We also determined that this program provided a financial
contribution within the meaning of section 771(5)(D) of the Act. No new information or
evidence of changed circumstances has been presented to cause us to revisit this determination.
Thus, we determine that this program constitutes a countervailable export subsidy.
<P>
Under our traditional methodology used to calculate a benefit from this tax reserve, the
Department considered that this program provided only a deferral of tax liability. That is, this
program allowed a company to shift its tax payment on the funds in the reserve from year 1 to
years 4, 5, and 6. For example, in Year X a company places funds into a reserve account and
these funds are, therefore, not taxed in Year X. However, four years later when one-third of the
funds in the tax reserve are returned to taxable income, then income taxes are paid on these funds
in Year X plus four. Therefore, because the company received a deferral of income taxes on
those funds, we considered the tax savings on these funds for those four years to benefit the
company in the form of an interest-free loan. That is, the company had money it otherwise
would not have had absent this program. The amount of the interest-free loan was based upon
the tax savings on the balance in the tax reserve. We also determined that if a company had a tax
loss during the POI, then there was no benefit from this tax reserve because the company had no
tax liability during the POI. We did not calculate a benefit on the portion of the tax reserve
which was returned to taxable income during the POI.
<P>
In the Preliminary Determination, we indicated that we were reviewing this methodolgy
to determine whether we were accurately calculating the benefit conferred by these tax reserves.
Based upon our review, we have determined that we need to revise our benefit calculations. In
the past, we did not calculate a benefit from the reserve balances in years in which a company
was in tax loss and did not incur tax payments. Upon further review, we determine that the time
in which the deferral of tax liability took place was in the year in which funds from the
company’s income were placed into the tax reserve. Therefore, regardless of whether the
company is in a tax loss during the POI, the balance in the tax reserve is still providing the
company with an interest-free loan. This methodology treats the tax reserves as a deferral of tax
liability and therefore, the benefit lies in the amount of the reserve deferred. A company receives
a benefit when it defers a certain amount of taxable income; however, the benefit ceases once the
company returns the reserve to taxable income and pays taxes on this amount.
<P>
In addition, we also recognize that a company is benefitting when it returns funds from
the reserve back into income during those years in which the company is at a tax loss. If the
company is in a tax loss situation and does not pay any taxes on income in the year in which the
funds are refunded to the income account, the funds that were placed into the tax reserve are
never taxed. Under this scenario, the company, instead of being provided with a deferral of tax
liability on these reserve funds, has also been provided with a complete exemption of tax liability
on this income. When a company is in a tax loss position and returns its reserves and does not
have to pay taxes, this confers a benefit in the form of a tax forgiveness. Furthermore, a financial
contribution is provided as the GOK does not collect revenue that was otherwise due.
<P>
As noted above, Dongbu and Dongbu Corp had outstanding balances in this reserve
during the POI. To determine the benefit conferred by this program, we calculated the tax
savings by multiplying the balance amount of the reserve as of December 31, 1999, as filed
during the POI, by the corporate tax rate for 1999. We treated the tax savings on these funds as a
short-term interest-free loan. See 19 CFR 351.509. Accordingly, to determine the benefit, we
multiplied the amount of tax savings for Dongbu and Dongbu Corp by their respective weightedaverage
interest rate for short-term won-denominated commercial loans for the POI, as described
in the “Subsidies Valuation Information” section, above. In addition, using the methodology for
calculating subsidies received by trading companies, which is also detailed in the “Subsidies
Valuation” section of this notice, we calculated a benefit for Dongbu Corp attributed to Dongbu.
<P>
As noted above, HYSCO returned the remaining balance of this reserve fund to income
during the POI. However, the company was in a tax loss and did not pay taxes during this year.
Therefore, HYSCO received a complete tax exemption under this program. To calculate the
benefit, we treated the reversed amount returned to income as a tax forgiveness. We first
determined the reserve amount returned to income, next we calculated the tax savings on that
amount. We then divided the benefit by the respective total export sales.
On this basis, we calculated a countervailable subsidy of 0.07 percent ad valorem for
Dongbu and 0.03 percent ad valorem for HYSCO.

H. <font color="#800000"><b>Reserve for Overseas Market Development Under TERCL Article 17</b></font>
<P>
Article 17 of the TERCL allows a domestic person engaged in a foreign trade business to
establish a reserve fund equal to one percent of its foreign exchange earnings from its export
business for the respective tax year. Expenses incurred in developing overseas markets may be
offset by returning, from the reserve to the income account, an amount equivalent to the expense.
Any part of the fund that is not placed in the income account for the purpose of offsetting
overseas market development expenses must be returned to the income account over a three-year
period, after a one-year grace period. As is the case with the Reserve for Export Loss, the
balance of this reserve fund is not subject to corporate income tax during the grace period.
However, all of the money in the reserve is eventually reported as income and subject to
corporate income tax either when it offsets export losses or when the grace period expires. The
deferral of taxes owed amounts to an interest-free loan equal to the company’s tax savings. This
program is only available to exporters. This program was terminated on April 10, 1998, and no
new funds could be placed in this reserve after January 1, 1999. However, Dongbu still had an
outstanding balance in this reserve during the POI. Dongbu Corp., a trading company used by
Dongbu and Posteel, a trading company used by POSCO, also had outstanding balances in this
reserve during the POI.
<P>
In Sheet and Strip, 64 FR 30636, 30645, we determined that this program constituted an
export subsidy under section 771(5A)(B) of the Act because the use of the program is contingent
upon export performance. We also determine that this program provided a financial contribution
within the meaning of section 771(5)(D)(i) of the Act in the form of a loan. No new information
or evidence of changed circumstances has been presented to cause us to revisit this
determination. Thus, we determine that this program constitutes a countervailable export
subsidy.
<P>
To determine the benefit conferred by this program during the POI, we employed the
same methodology used for determining the benefit from the Reserve for Export Loss program
under Article 16 of the TERCL. We used as our benchmark interest rate each company’s
respective weighted-average interest rate for short-term won-denominated commercial loans for
the POI, as described in the “Subsidies Valuation Section” above. We then divided the benefit
by the respective total export sales. In addition, using the methodology for calculating subsidies
received by trading companies, which is also detailed in the “Subsidies Valuation” section of this
notice, we calculated a benefit attributable to each respective producer. On this basis, we
calculated a countervailable subsidy of 0.04 percent ad valorem for Dongbu and a
countervailable subsidy of 0.02 percent ad valorem POSCO.
<P><a name="II"></a>
I. <font color="#800000"><b>Asset Revaluation Under Article 56(2) of the TERCL</b></font>
<P>
Under Article 56(2) of the TERCL, the GOK permitted companies that made an initial
public offering between January 1, 1987, and December 31, 1990, to revalue their assets at a rate
higher than the 25 percent required of most other companies under the Asset Revaluation Act. In
CTL Plate, we found this program countervailable. See 64 FR 73176, 73183. No new
information, evidence of changed circumstances, or comments from interested parties were
presented in this
.
<P>
The benefit from this program is the difference that the revaluation of depreciable assets
has on a company’s tax liability each year. To calculate the benefit under this program, we used
the additional depreciation in the tax return filed during the POI, which resulted from the
company’s asset revaluation, and multiplied that amount by the tax rate applicable to that tax
return. We then divided the resulting benefit for each company by their respective total sales.
On this basis, we determine a net countervailable subsidy of 0.04 percent ad valorem for
POSCO. HYSCO received no benefit from this program because it had a net tax loss. Dongbu
did not use this program.
<P><a name="IJ"></a>
J. <font color="#800000"><b>Tax Reserve for Balanced Development under RSTA Article 58 (TERCL Article
41)</b></font>
<P>
TERCL Article 41 allowed a company that planned to relocate its facility from a large
city to a local area to establish a reserve equal to 15 percent of the facility’s value. The balance
in the reserve was not subject to corporate income tax in that year but all monies in the reserve
must eventually be returned to the income account and are then subject to tax at the expiration of
the grace period. The reserve amount equivalent to the amount incurred from the relocation of its
facilities from the large city to a local area will be included in taxable income after a two-year
grace period and over a three-year period. If the reserve amount is not used for the payment of
relocation, this unused amount is included in the company’s taxable income, after the two-year
grace period. This program was replaced by Article 58 of RSTA. Subsequent to the
establishment of Article 58 of RSTA, the program was terminated and the last date that this
reserve could be established was August 31, 1999. Dongbu was the only company which
established a reserve under this program before the program’s August 31, 1999 termination.
Dongbu still had an outstanding balance under this reserve during the POI.
<P>
In the Preliminary Determination, we determined that this program is specific within the
meaning of section 771(5A)(D)(iv) of the Act, because the program is limited to enterprises or
industries located within a designated geographical region. Because the deferral of taxes owed
provided under this program amounts to an interest-free loan equal to the company’s tax savings,
we also determined that this program provided a financial contribution within the meaning of
section 771(5)(D)(i) of the Act as revenue foregone that the GOK would have otherwise
collected. We also find that under section 771(5)(E)(ii) of the Act, Dongbu received a benefit in
the form of a loan.
<P>
To determine the benefit conferred by this program to Dongbu, we employed the same
methodology described in the Reserve for Export Loss Program, above. We calculated the tax
savings by multiplying the balance amount of the reserve as of December 31, 1999, by the
corporate tax rate for 1999. We treated the tax savings on these funds as a short-term
interest-free loan. See section 351.509 of the CVD Regulations. Accordingly, to determine the
benefit, we multiplied the amount of tax savings by Dongbu’s weighted-average interest rate for
short-term won-denominated commercial loans for the POI, as described in the “Subsidies
Valuation Information” section, above. We then divided the benefit by the company’s total f.o.b.
sales. On this basis, we calculated a countervailable subsidy of 0.02 ad valorem for Dongbu.
<P>
In the Preliminary Determination we invited interested parties to comment on this issue.
Specifically, we invited interested parties to comment on whether the methodology the
Department has traditionally applied to these types of Korean tax programs accurately quantifies
the benefit conferred by these tax reserves. For further information, see Comment 5: Tax
Programs of the “Analysis of Comments” section of this Decision Memorandum.
<P><a name="IK"></a>
K. <font color="#800000"><b>Short-term Export Financing</b></font>
<P>
In Certain Steel Products, the Department determined that the GOK’s short-term export
financing program was countervailable. See 58 FR at 37350.
. During the POI, both HYSCO and POSCO used export financing.
<P>
To determine whether this export financing program confers a countervailable benefit, we
compared the interest rate HYSCO and POSCO paid on the export financing received under this
program during the POI with the interest rate they would have paid on a comparable short-term
commercial loan. See discussion above in the “Subsidies Valuation Information” section with
respect to short-term loan benchmark interest rates.
<P>
To calculate the benefit conferred by this program, we compared the actual interest paid
on the loans with the amount of interest that would have been paid at the applicable benchmark
interest rate. We then divided the benefit derived from all of HYSCO’s and POSCO’s export
loans by the value of the companies’ total export sales. On this basis, we determine a net
countervailable subsidy of 0.07 percent ad valorem for HYSCO and less than 0.005 percent ad
valorem for POSCO.
<P><a name="IL"></a>
L. <font color="#800000"><b>Local Tax Exemption on land outside of Metropolitan area</b></font>
<P>
At verification the Department found that HYSCO and POSCO were exempt from paying
registration and acquisition taxes for their industrial land located outside of a metropolitan area.
Dongbu received these exemptions on the purchase of land at Asan Bay, however, these
exemptions were received prior to the POI. Under Korean tax law, companies are exempt from
the registration and acquisition taxes on industrial land outside of a metropolitan area.
The Department finds that these exemptions are regionally specific under section
771(5A)(D)(iv) of the Act, as being limited to an enterprise or industry located within a
designated geographical region. See e.g. Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determinations:
Low Enriched Uranium from Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, 66 FR 65903
(December 21, 2001). A financial contribution is provided, as the GOK foregoes revenue that it
would otherwise collect. A benefit is conferred in the form of a tax exemption.
To calculate the benefit, we took the amount of each companies’ tax exemption and
divided that tax savings by the companies’ respective total f.o.b. sales. Using this methodology,
we calculated a net countervailable subsidy rate of 0.01 percent ad valorem for HYSCO and 0.04
percent ad valorem for POSCO.

M. <font color="#800000"><b>Electricity Discounts under the Requested Load Adjustment Program</b></font>
<P>
The GOK introduced an electricity discount under the Requested Load Adjustment
(RLA) program in 1990, to address emergencies in the Korea Electric Power Company
(KEPCO’s) ability to supply electricity. Under this program, customers with a contract demand
of 5,000 kW or more, who can curtail their maximum demand by 20 percent or suppress their
maximum demand by 3,000 kW or more, are eligible to enter into a RLA contract with KEPCO.
Customers who choose to participate in this program must reduce their load upon KEPCO’s
request, or pay a surcharge to KEPCO.
<P>
Customers can apply for this program between May 1 and May 15 of each year. If
KEPCO finds the application in order, KEPCO and the customer enter into a contract with
respect to the RLA discount. The RLA discount is provided based upon a contract for two
months, normally July and August. Under this program, a basic discount of 440 won per kW is
granted between July 1 and August 31, regardless of whether KEPCO makes a request for a
customer to reduce its load. During the POI, KEPCO granted POSCO electricity discounts under
this program.
<P>
In Sheet and Strip, the Department found this program specific under section
771(5A)(D)(iii)(I) of the Act because the discounts were distributed to a limited number of
customers. Respondents have not provided any new information to warrant reconsideration of
this determination. Therefore, we continue to find this program countervailable.
<P>
Because the electricity discounts provide recurring benefits, we have expensed the benefit
from this program in the year of receipt. To measure the benefit from this program, we summed
the electricity discounts which POSCO received from KEPCO under the RLA program during
the POI. We then divided that amount by POSCO’s total f.o.b. sales value for the POI. On this
basis, we determine a net countervailable subsidy of less than 0.005 percent ad valorem for
POSCO.

POSCO is the only Korean producer of hot-rolled stainless steel coil (HRC), which is the
main input into the subject merchandise. During the POI, POSCO sold HRC to Dongbu to
produce subject merchandise. We verified that HYSCO did not purchase HRC from POSCO to
produce subject merchandise. In CTL Plate, the Department determined that the GOK, through
its ownership and control of POSCO, set prices of steel inputs used by the Korean steel industry
at prices at less than adequate remuneration, and also found this program countervailable. See 64
FR at 73184.
<P>
Under section 351.511(a)(2) of the CVD Regulations, the adequacy of remuneration is to
be determined by comparing the government price to a market determined price based on actual
transactions in the country in question. Such prices could include prices stemming from actual
transactions between private parties, actual imports, or, in certain circumstances, actual sales
from competitively run government auctions. During the POI, Dongbu imported HRC; therefore,
we are using Dongbu’s actual imported prices of HRC as our basis of comparison to the price at
which POSCO sold HRC to Dongbu. Based upon this comparison, we determined that POSCO
sold HRC to Dongbu at less than adequate remuneration. As a result, a benefit is conferred to
Dongbu under section 771(5)(E)(iv); therefore, we continue to find this program countervailable.
Because HYSCO did not purchase HRC from POSCO to produce subject merchandise, we
determine that HYSCO did not receive a benefit under this program.
<P>
In the Preliminary Determination, the Department stated that during verification we
would closely examine whether or not the GOK continues either directly or indirectly to control
POSCO’s pricing policy in the Korean domestic market. We received numerous comments from
both the petitioners and respondents on this issue. The results of verification and our analysis of
the comments submitted by respondents and petitioners have not led the Department to change
its decision in the Preliminary Determination that this program is countervailable for this POI.
The comments on this issue have been addressed in the comments section of this notice. See
Comments 1 and 2, below.
<P>
To determine the value of the benefit under this program, we compared the monthly
delivered weighted-average price charged by POSCO to Dongbu for HRCs to the monthly
delivered, duty-inclusive weighted-average price Dongbu paid for imported HRCs. We made
due allowances for the different specifications of HRCs, thus allowing the Department to
compare a single product. In addition, we made an adjustment to the imported price for duty
drawback. Under duty drawback a company receives a portion of the duty paid for importing
when it reexports merchandise manufactured using that import. We verified that Dongbu
received drawback of a portion of the duties it paid on imported HRC. Therefore, we adjusted
the monthly weight-averaged import price to account for that portion of import duties which were
drawn back. Next, we multiplied this price difference by the quantity of HRC that Dongbu
purchased from POSCO during the POI. We then divided the amount of the price savings by the
f.o.b. sales value of subject merchandise. On this basis, we determine that Dongbu received a
countervailable subsidy of 0.37 percent ad valorem from this program during the POI.

O. <font color="#800000"><b>Dongbu’s Excessive Exemptions under the Harbor Act</b></font>
<P>
Under the Harbor Act, companies are allowed to construct infrastructure facilities at
Korean ports; however, these facilities must be deeded back to the government. Because the
ownership of these facilities reverts to the government, the government compensates private
parties for the construction of these infrastructure facilities. Because a company must transfer to
the government its infrastructure investment, under the Harbor Act, the GOK under grants the
company free usage of the facility and the right to collect fees from other users of the facility for
a limited period of time. Once a company has recovered its cost of constructing the
infrastructure, the company must pay the same usage fees as other users of the infrastructure. In
Sheet and Strip, we determined that this program was not countervailable because it was not
specific under section 771(5A)(D)(iii) of the Act.
<P>
During verification of the instant investigation, the Department found that Dongbu
received free use of harbor facilities at Asan Bay based upon both its construction of a port
facility as well as a road that the company built from its plant to its port. We verified that
Dongbu received an exemption of harbor fees for a period of almost 70 years under this program.
Furthermore, Koland official have stated that any roads built by companies at Asan Bay are built
at the company’s expense. Moreover, given the length of the exemption period provided to
Dongbu, the company received more than just a limited exemption on its harbor fee. It also
received compensation which lasted longer than the useful life of the constructed assets.
<P>
However, under this program, Dongbu is being reimbursed for the roads which it constructed and
received additional exemptions of fees by the GOK under the Harbor Act. As only Dongbu has
received a 70 year exemption period, we find that this excessive exemption period is specific to
Dongbu under section 771(5A)(D)(iii)(I) of the Act. Moreover, we find that the GOK is
foregoing revenue that it would otherwise collect by allowing Dongbu to be exempt from port
charges for up to 70 years.
<P>
During verification we were able to determine the average yearly amount of harbor fees
exemptions provided to Dongbu as a result of this program. To calculate the benefit we took the
average yearly amount of exemptions and divided that amount by Dongbu’s total f.o.b. sales for
the POI. Using this methodology, we calculated a countervailable net subsidy rate of 0.03
percent ad valorem for Dongbu under this program.
<P><a name="IP"></a>
P. <font color="#800000"><b>Exemption of VAT on Imports of Anthracite Coal</b></font>
<P>
The Department investigated an allegation that the GOK provided anthracite coal to the
steel industry for less than adequate remuneration. At verification the Department determined
that POSCO did not purchase any anthracite coal from the GOK. However, we did verify that
imports of anthracite coal were exempt from paying VAT, and that POSCO imported anthracite
coal during the POI. (See POSCO’s Verification Report page 4). We also verified that VAT is
paid on imports of non-anthracite coal.
<P>
Based on information on the record, the GOK allows for only a few items to be exempt
from VAT, a substantial majority of items must pay VAT when being imported. We determine
that this program is specific under section 771(5A)(D)(i) of the Act, as the items allowed to be
imported without paying VAT are limited. We also find that a financial contribution is provided
under section 771(5)(D)(ii) of the Act, as the GOK is not collecting revenue otherwise due.
POSCO imported anthracite coal during the POI, therefore, it received a benefit in the amount of
the VAT that it would have otherwise paid if not for the exemption. Therefore, we find this
program countervailable, and find a net countervailable subsidy rate of 0.03 percent ad valorem
for POSCO.
<P>
II. Programs Determined To Be Not Countervailable
<P><a name="IIA"></a>
A. <font color="#800000"><b>GOK Infrastructure Investments at Kwangyang Bay Post-1991</b></font>
<P>
Petitioners alleged that the GOK made infrastructure investments during the POI for
POSCO at Kwangyang Bay. In Plate in Coils, we determined that the GOK’s investments at
Kwangyang Bay since 1991, in the Jooam Dam, the container terminal, and the public highway
were not specific. See 64 FR 15536. We verified that the only new GOK expenditures made at
Kwangyang Bay were for the container terminal. We determined in Plate in Coils that the
GOK’s investments in the container terminal did not provide a benefit to POSCO because
POSCO does not use the container terminal. No new factual information or evidence of changed
circumstances has been provided to the Department with respect to this program. Therefore, we
continue to determine that this program is not countervailable.
<P><a name="IIB"></a>
B. <font color="#800000"><b>R&amp;D Aid for Anthracite Coal Technology</b></font>
<P>
This program refers to the project “Technology for Sintered Anthracite Coal” in the
August 1996 report prepared by the Korea Iron and Steel Association (KOSA). This project was
solely financed by POSCO from the company’s own funds. Because the GOK did not provide
any funds for this project, we determine that this program is not countervailable.
<P><a name="IIC"></a>
C. <font color="#800000"><b>Asan Bay Infrastructure Subsidies</b></font>
<P>
Petitioners alleged that the GOK provided infrastructure subsidies related to roads, piers,
distribution facilities, and industrial water supplies to steel companies located at Asan Bay.
Based upon the information on the record of this investigation and in the CTL Plate remand
redetermination, we determine that no benefit was provided under this program. Therefore, we
find this program not countervailable.
<P>
The roads located in and around the Asan Bay area can be divided into three different
categories. The first category is roads that are located within the industrial estates which were
built by Koland, the government agency which developed and sells the land at the Asan Bay
industrial estates. The construction costs incurred by Koland for these roads are included as part
of the land purchase price charged to companies purchasing land in the industrial estates. The
second category is roads that are built on an individual company’s site within the industrial estate
which are built and paid for by the companies themselves. The third category of roads is the
main roads and highways that are located around the Asan Bay area and which are used by the
general public. Generally, the construction of toll free roads is handled by the Ministry of
Construction and Transportation (MOCAT) and are built using funds from the GOK budget.
<P>
These roads are part of the country’s general road and highway system. The costs for
construction and operation of toll roads are paid from the GOK budget and by the Korea Road
Corporation (KRC). The construction costs of the KRC are recovered through the collection of
tolls from users. The major highway that serves the Asan Bay area is the West Coast Highway,
which is part of the National Highway system.
<P>
With respect to the allegation that companies located in Asan Bay industrial estates
benefit from the GOK’s provision of roads, we determine that: (1) the roads build by the GOK
within the industrial estate do not provide a benefit because the cost of road construction is
included in the purchase price of the land; (2) the additional roads within the industrial estate on
individual company sites do not provide a benefit because these roads are build and paid for by
the company; and (3) the West Coast Highway and other national roads within the Asan Bay area
are part of the country’s national road system and thus constitute general infrastructure, and
therefore do not provide a countervailable benefit.
<P>
With respect to the allegation of industrial water facilities, sewage facilities, and electric
power facilities, the GOK states in its response that the companies located in the Asan Bay
industrial estates pay for these services. The fees charged to these companies for these services
are based on the general published tariff rates for each of these services. In addition, the
connections from the main water pipe to the user are constructed and paid for by the user;
individual lines from the main electricity transformers to each companies’ individual facility are
constructed and paid for by the company; and sewage facilities located within an individual
company’s facility as well as the connection to the main sewage facility are constructed and paid
for by the individual company. Because companies within the industrial estate pay for the
construction of these facilities and pay the published tariff rates for industrial services, we
determine that no benefit is provided by the GOK by the provision of these goods and services.
There are no distribution depots at Asan Bay.
<P>
We note that with respect to this program, the Department was required to conduct
verification of the provision of infrastructure at Asan Bay in a recent remand of CTL Plate. The
Departments’s remand redetermination of CTL Plate is in litigation, and thus, serves as no legal
precedent in this instant investigation. However, factual information gathered in the course of
the CTL Plate remand may be placed on the record of this investigation and considered in this
determination. Therefore, we have placed the public verification reports for both the GOK and
POSCO from the CTL Plate remand on the record of this current investigation. See “Remand
Verification Report for the Government of Korea (GOK) in the Court of International Trade
(CIT) Remand of the Countervailing Duty Investigation of Certain Cut-to-Length Carbon-Quality
Steel Plate from the Republic of Korea” and “Remand Verification Report for Pohang Iron and
Steel Co., Ltd. (POSCO) in the Court of International Trade (CIT) Remand of the Countervailing
Duty Investigation of Certain Cut-to-Length Carbon-Quality Steel Plate from the Republic of
Korea.” Both of these public verification reports are dated November 26, 2001, and have been
placed in the public file in the CRU. The information in the verification reports substantiates the
information provided in the responses.
<P>
The petitioners also alleged that the companies located in the Asan Bay industrial estates
benefit from the provision of port facilities. The port facilities at Asan Bay are not part of the
industrial estates. The port facilities located at Asan Bay are owned and administered by the
Inchon Port Authority (IPA), a division of the Ministry of Maritime and Fisheries (MOMAF).
Furthermore, with respect to the provision of port facilities, we have previously found this
program not countervailable in Sheet and Strip. No new factual information or evidence of
changed circumstances has been provided to the Department with respect to this program.
Therefore, we continue to determine the provision of port facilities to be not countervailable.

<P>
Under TERCL article 29, all domestic companies are able to establish a reserve for
investment in energy-saving facilities amounting to 15 percent of the total investment value of
the facility. The balance in the reserve is not subject to corporate income tax in the year it is
invested or the following two years; afterwards, it is returned to income and is subject to
taxation. This article was replaced with RSTA article 30 on December 28, 1998.
<P>
Information on the record demonstrates that this program is not limited to any industry
and is therefore not specific, as required under section 771(5A) of the Act. We received no
comments on this program and, as it is not specific, we find that this program is not
countervailable.
<P>
III. Programs Determined To Be Not Used
<P><a name="IIIA"></a>
A. <font color="#800000"><b>Anthracite Coal for Less than Adequate Remuneration</b></font>
<P>
Petitioners alleged that the GOK provides anthracite coal to steel producers at suppressed
prices. Petitioners claim that these suppressed prices are part of a GOK price stabilization
program where steel producers are receiving anthracite coal at less than adequate remuneration.
This program is designed to support and maintain the domestic coal industry in Korea by
managing anthracite and briquette prices and is administered by MOCIE and the Coal Industry
Promotion Board (CIPB). The GOK fixes the highest selling price of anthracite and briquette
and then provides funds to the mining companies and briquette manufacturing companies for the
difference between their costs of production and sales prices through the coal industry
stabilization fund. Thus, the GOK controls prices of anthracite coal mined in Korea.
<P>
POSCO was the only respondent to use anthracite coal. However, during the POI,
POSCO used only imported anthracite coal and thus did not use this program. Based on the fact
that POSCO had no purchases of domestic anthracite coal, we determine that POSCO did not use
this program during the POI.
<P><a name="IIIB"></a>
B. <font color="#800000"><b>Grants to Dongbu</b></font>
<P>
We verified that these grants which were contained in Dongbu’s 1996 Financial
Statement related to R&amp;D projects that Dongbu participated in between 1991 and 1995. These
grants equaled less than 0.5 percent of Dongbu’s sales in 1996. Thus, under section
351.524(b)(2) of the CVD Regulations, these grants are expensed in the year of receipt.
Therefore, because no benefit was conferred to Dongbu from these grants during the POI, we
determine that this program was not used.

Decree.
<P>
This program allows a company operating in manufacturing or mining, or in a business
prescribed by the Presidential Decree, to appropriate reserve funds to cover the expenses needed
for development or innovation of technology. These reserve funds are included in the company’s
losses and reduce the amount of taxes paid by the company. Under this program, capital goods
and capital intensive companies can establish a reserve of five percent, while companies in all
other industries are only allowed to establish a three percent reserve.
<P>
In CTL Plate, we determined that this program is countervailable because the capital
goods industry is allowed to claim a larger tax reserve under this program than all other
manufacturers. We also determined in CTL Plate that this program provides a financial
contribution within the meaning of section 771(5)(D)(i) of the Act in the form of a loan. The
benefit provided by this program is the differential two percent tax savings enjoyed by the
companies in the capital goods industry, which includes steel manufacturers. See CTL Plate at
73181. While we continue to find this program countervailable, Dongbu only contributed funds
to this reserve at the three percent rate; therefore, we find that the company did not benefit from
this program. Thus, the countervailable aspect of this program was not used.

V. Analysis of Comments
<P>
Comment 1: GOK Control of POSCO
<P>
Petitioners contend that, for reasons outlined below, the Department should continue to
countervail the benefit to Dongbu from POSCO’s provision of steel inputs at less than adequate
remuneration. Specifically, petitioners argue that, despite POSCO’s September 2000
privatization, the GOK continued to control POSCO during the POI through holding shares in
POSCO, holding superior voting rights, and exercising control over leadership of the
corporation. Petitioners maintain that the GOK continues to hold shares in POSCO through the
government-owned Industrial Bank of Korea (IBK), as well as other government-owned entities.
Petitioners argue that the IBK owned 4.12 percent of POSCO as of December 31, 2000.
Moreover, petitioners contend that the Korea Development Bank (KDB) held 10 percent of the
shares in POSCO until October 6, 2000. Additionally, petitioners argue that the National
Pension Corporation (NPC), a government-owned entity, held more than one percent of
POSCO’s shares throughout the POI.
<P>
Furthermore, petitioners argue that the GOK continued to hold superior voting rights
during the POI. Petitioners dispute respondents’ assertion that all of POSCO’s shares are
common shares and thus no shareholder has superior voting rights. Petitioners maintain that any
restrictions on the acquisition of shares were in place during the POI, and, therefore, POSCO’s
statement is irrelevant that amendments to its bylaws during the course of privatization lifted
restrictions on the acquisition of shares. Petitioners also assert that general voting rights were
still limited by law until September 26, 2000, the majority of the POI, and the effect was not
lifted until March 2001 when POSCO could modify its Articles of Incorporation to implement
the change. Further, petitioners argue that the GOK’s recognition of POSCO as a “public
company” continued after privatization, as evidenced by the fact that POSCO was subject to the
supervision of the Korean Board of Audit and Inspection (KBAI), a governmental agency that
regulates other governmental bodies, throughout 2000.
<P>
Additionally, petitioners assert that the GOK continued to exercise control over POSCO’s
leadership during the POI. As evidence, petitioners point to the fact that at least two former
government officials served on POSCO’s board of directors (BOD) until spring 2000, and at least
four of POSCO’s eight outside directors during the POI had direct government or governmentrelated
service. Petitioners also point to the Department’s verification report of POSCO, which
they claim provides further evidence that under procedures in place until March 2000, five of
POSCO’s eight outside directors were recommended to the board by the top five largest
shareholders, with the KDB and the IBK each selecting one director. Petitioners state that the
verification report confirmed that two of the eight outside directors are still ex-appointees of
government banks. Petitioners maintain that at least four of POSCO’s outside directors have had
former government experience, and, during the POI, half of POSCO’s outside directors had
government ties. In addition, petitioners assert that the appointment of POSCO’s current top
management is a direct result of the GOK’s continued control of the company.

<P>Respondents rebut petitioners’ argument that POSCO is controlled by the GOK.
<P>
Respondents state that the limited evidence provided by petitioners is not sufficient to find a
direct subsidy, which requires a demonstration that POSCO is a public entity. Respondents
argue that under the Statement of Administrative Action (“SAA”), a direct subsidy can only be
provided by the government itself or a public entity or public body. Respondents maintain that
the fact that the IBK, the KDB, and the NPC held a small percentage of POSCO’s shares during
the POI does not prove that POSCO was a government-controlled company. Namely,
respondents argue that the Department verified that the IBK has no incentive to use its ownership
interest to direct or influence POSCO to sell HRC at artificially low prices since the IBK would
suffer from any decision that negatively affected POSCO and its share price. Regarding the
KDB’s ownership interest in POSCO, respondents maintain that these shares were originally to
be sold by the end of 1999 as part of POSCO’s privatization, but due to poor equity market
conditions in Korea, this target date was not met until September 29, 2000. While the KDB was
still holding shares of POSCO during the POI, respondents assert that the KDB was a passive
investor waiting for a financially beneficial time to sell its shares of POSCO. Respondents
further argue that the NPC is administered by the Ministry of Health and Welfare, who uses a
committee to make investment decisions for the Pension Fund, and there is no evidence that the
GOK controls this committee or directs it to make decisions.
<P>
Moreover, respondents argue that the Department verified that POSCO’s designation as a
“public company” and the restrictions on voting rights were both removed during the POI.
Respondents maintain that any restrictions on an individual shareholder’s voting rights or
ownership in POSCO were removed as of September 26, 2000, and the fact that POSCO’s
Articles of Incorporation were not amended until the next general meeting of shareholders is
irrelevant as a matter of law. The removal of legal restriction, not the formality of amending
POSCO’s Articles of Incorporation, is what matters, argue respondents. In addition, respondents
assert that even if the KBAI did “regulate” POSCO during part of the POI by virtue of its ability
to audit POSCO, petitioners have pointed to no specific evidence that demonstrates that POSCO
was subject to such supervision after the removal of POSCO designation as a public company.
<P>
Respondents further rebut petitioners’ arguments that the GOK continued to exercise
control over the leadership of POSCO during the POI. Respondents state that the GOK has no
direct involvement in appointing POSCO’s leadership and that only two outside members of
POSCO’s BOD were appointed by GOK-owned entities. Respondents state that during the POI
none of POSCO’s standing directors were former government officials or employees. Regarding
outside directors, respondents assert that only two of the eight are former government officials or
employees, not four, as petitioners state. Additionally, respondents argue that these officials’
government service ended 33 years and 9 years ago. Regarding the other two outside directors
that petitioners allude to, respondents argue that they were not government employees or officials
but were instead unpaid outside consultants on various government commissions and
committees. Respondents maintain that petitioners have offered no evidence that all of
POSCO’s shareholders are controlled by the GOK and that they voted in accordance with GOK
policy.
<P>
Petitioners maintain that even if POSCO were fully privatized, the GOK continues to
entrust or direct the company to provide a financial contribution. Petitioners cite to the
<P>
2 See Stainless Steel Sheet and Strip in Coils from the Republic of Korea: Amended Final Results of
Countervailing Duty Administrative Review, 67 FR 8229 (February 22, 2002) (1999 Sheet and Strip) and the
accompanying Issues and Decision Memorandum: Final Results of Countervailing Duty Administrative Review:
Stainless Steel Sheet and Strip in Coils from the Republic of Korea (January 8, 2002).
<P>
Department’s recently completed administrative review of 1999 Sheet and Strip,2 in which the
Department found that there was insufficient evidence on the record to conclude that the GOK
has not directed POSCO to make a financial contribution. Petitioners further argue that although
the GOK states that its dual pricing policy was terminated in 1999, record evidence demonstrates
that the scheme to provide preferentially-priced inputs to exporters remains in place through the
use of preferential credit terms. Petitioners assert that, as the Department found in 1999 Sheet
and Strip, the distinction between the dual pricing system and the favorable credit system which
replaced it has no bearing on whether the GOK, through POSCO, sold inputs for less than
adequate remuneration. Petitioners maintain that in the spring of 1999, before POSCO’s
privatization, the dual pricing system was terminated and immediately replaced with the use of
letters of credit that provided favorable financing terms. Therefore, petitioners conclude, the
GOK, through its ownership and control of POSCO, set prices of steel inputs for sale to Korean
steel producers at less than adequate remuneration.
<P>
Respondents rebut petitioners’ assertions that the GOK has entrusted or directed POSCO.
<P>
First, respondents argue that petitioners can point to no specific evidence that supports its claim
that GOK exercised any control over POSCO nor any evidence of a causal nexus between the
program and the benefit. Furthermore, respondents argue that petitioners’ reference to Sheet and
Strip fails to provide persuasive evidence, as that decision was based on evidence from a
previous period of review, POSCO was not a respondent in that review, and no verification was
conducted. Furthermore, respondents argue that even assuming arguendo that POSCO were
providing discounts to its competition using a favorable credit system, this alone does not
constitute an indirect subsidy or any subsidy. Without any evidence that the GOK entrusted or
directed POSCO to sell HRC at artificially low prices, petitioners’ indirect subsidy claim fails,
according to respondents.
<P>
Respondents argue that the Department can no longer rely upon the GOK’s minor
ownership of POSCO as support for its determination that the GOK controlled and set POSCO’s
prices of HRC at less than adequate remuneration. Respondents maintain that the GOK’s
ownership of POSCO was greatly reduced during the POI, and the GOK is no longer the single
largest shareholder. Respondents assert that by the end of the POI, the IBK’s ownership of
POSCO was reduced to 4.12 percent. All of these shares are common shares with normal voting
rights which are held by the IBK. Respondents point out that the single largest block of
POSCO’s shares consist of American Depository Receipts (ADRs), which trade on the New
York Stock Exchange. Additionally, respondents quote to the Department’s verification report
with private parties, reiterating that the Department learned at verification that the IBK most
likely is not influencing POSCO’s pricing policy because it lacks any incentive to direct
POSCO’s pricing policy of HRC or other products and it wants POSCO to be profitable.
<P>
Furthermore, respondents affirm that the KDB, previously POSCO’s largest shareholder and the
basis for finding GOK ownership and control, held no shares at the end of 2000.
<P>
Petitioners rebut respondents’ claim, arguing that it is undisputed that GOK-controlled
entities held a substantial stake in POSCO throughout the POI. Petitioners maintain that
regardless of whether GOK-owned banks had reduced their holdings or the GOK was the single
largest shareholder, a reduced or second-largest stake can still afford effective control, as the
Department found in 1999 Sheet and Strip. Moreover, petitioners argue that ADRs do not
constitute a single stake, as they are held by numerous investors. Petitioners assert that the
question is not who else owns a stake in POSCO, but what the GOK owns and what other means
it has to influence POSCO’s behavior. Petitioners point to a report by Merrill Lynch that was
placed on the record and that reveals the potential for government influence over POSCO’s
affairs. Furthermore, petitioners rebut respondents’ argument that the GOK has no incentive to
exert influence over POSCO through the IBK because it wants POSCO to be profitable, stating
that the desire for POSCO to be profitable has never been an impediment to the GOK using
POSCO to bestow subsidies.
<P>
Respondents assert that POSCO’s designation as a “public company” has been
mischaracterized by petitioners and the Department. Respondents cite to AK Steel v United
States, 192 F. 3d 1367 (CAFC 1999), arguing that the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
noted that the fact that a company is designated as a public company does not in itself provide the
GOK with control over the business decisions of the company. Respondents maintain that on
September 26, 2000, the Minister of the MOFE removed POSCO’s designation as a “public
company” and simultaneously revoked the restriction that no individual shareholder other than
the GOK could exercise voting rights in excess of three percent of the company’s common
shares. Respondents conclude that any restrictions placed on an individual shareholder’s voting
rights or ownership in POSCO were removed as of POSCO’s privatization, and, therefore, the
Department can no longer rely upon these restrictions as support for its finding that the GOK
controlled POSCO and used this control to set POSCO’s prices for HRC at less than adequate
remuneration.
<P>
Petitioners rebut respondents’ argument, stating that although the official designation was
lifted in 2000, the legal consequences associated with it, including statutory restrictions on voting
rights for POSCO’s shareholders and GOK involvement in POSCO’s decision making,
continued through the POI. Petitioners maintain that stock voting restrictions existed for all or
most of the POI. Moreover, petitioners argue that respondents have the burden to demonstrate
that the lifting of the public company designation rendered stock voting restrictions null and void
and they have not done so. Petitioners maintain that the verified evidence illustrates that voting
restrictions remained in place during the POI. Additionally, petitioners argue that respondents’
citation to AK Steel is misplaced. Petitioners argue that the court said nothing about the
connection between public company and government control. Moreover, they maintain that by
the same reasoning made by respondents, the removal of the public company designation did not
reduce or eliminate government control.
<P>
Respondents assert that the Department can no longer rely on the obsolete fact that
POSCO’s chairman and BOD were appointed by the GOK. Specifically, respondents state that
beginning in March 1999, POSCO revised its Articles of Incorporation to establish new
procedures for selecting members of its BOD and to assure the independence and transparency of
the selection process. These new procedures included reducing its standing directors from nine
to seven and outside directors from ten to eight. In addition, at the General Meeting of
Shareholders on March 17, 2000, two outside directors who were former government employees
resigned. Respondents maintain that the composition of the BOD during the POI is a result of
these new procedures. Respondents assert that none of POSCO’s standing directors are either
current or former government employees. Moreover, only two of the eight directors have any
prior government affiliation. Additionally, respondents point out that since the POI, no directors
have been appointed by the GOK or the KDB. Respondents further state that the Department
confirmed at verification that apart from one outside director who did some consulting work with
MOFE and one who formerly worked with MOCIE, none of the other BOD members had any
government affiliation listed on their resumes. In sum, respondents argue that POSCO’s BOD
was independent and free of GOK influence during the POI.
<P>
Petitioners rebut respondents’ claim that the GOK did not influence POSCO’s leadership
during the POI. Petitioners argue that respondents have provided no evidence that would alter
the Department’s finding in CTL Plate and Sheet and Strip that the President of Korea selected
the chairman of POSCO. Petitioners state that the Presidentially-selected chairman served
throughout the POI and continues to hold his post. Petitioners argue that the new procedures by
which future leaders of POSCO are to be appointed by resolution of the BOD has no bearing on
what occurred during the POI. Additionally, petitioners assert that these new selection
procedures have not freed POSCO or its BOD from the GOK’s control.
<P>
Respondents argue that POSCO’s pricing is not influenced by the GOK. In fact,
respondents contend that the Department has pointed to no evidence on the record that the GOK
actually exercised control to force POSCO to sell HRC to Dongbu for less than adequate
remuneration. On the contrary, respondents argue that the record indicates that POSCO’s hotrolled
pricing decisions are made based on ordinary commercial considerations. As evidence,
respondents point to POSCO’s new single pricing system, which replaced the two-tiered pricing
system, whereby POSCO establishes its domestic prices based on its own judgement of market
conditions, including import competition. POSCO revises its HRC prices quarterly, based upon
market conditions, through quantity discounts, market discounts, import competition prices, and
payment terms. In addition, respondents point to the fact, verified by the Department, that
POSCO is being investigated by the Korean Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) for refusing to
increase supplies of HRC to HYSCO, as further evidence that POSCO’s pricing is not influenced
by the GOK. Finally, respondents assert that the Department’s meetings with private parties in
Korea further support a finding that POSCO is a private company that sets its prices based on
ordinary commercial considerations.
<P>
Petitioners rebut these arguments, stating that to the extent that POSCO remains in effect
a government seller of inputs, the only remaining question is whether the price charged is equal
to or greater than the applicable benchmark price. They assert that to the extent that the
Department relies on an ‘entrusts or directs’ analysis, the burden rests on respondents to prove
that the difference between the price charged and the adequate remuneration price is exclusively
due to factors other than government influence. That POSCO takes other factors, such as market
conditions, into account in its pricing decisions does not demonstrate an absence of GOK
intervention, argue petitioners. Additionally, petitioners argue that the Department’s discussions
with private parties cannot be considered as verified information. Furthermore, petitioners argue
that the KFTC investigation does not support respondents’ claim that the GOK asserts no control
over POSCO. Petitioners assert that the product at issue in the KFTC investigation is a
specialized type of HRC that would not be exported in large quantities. Petitioners contend that
the GOK influencing POSCO directly in the current situation while taking a more indirect
approach (i.e., a KFTC investigation) to deal with an internal problem (i.e., POSCO’s sales of
HRC to HYSCO) is consistent with the GOK’s past efforts to benefit POSCO’s exporting
customers.
<P>
Finally, respondents assert that even if the Department finds a subsidy from Dongbu’s
purchase of HRC inputs from POSCO, it should conclude that the subsidy ended with the
completion of POSCO’s privatization in October 2000. Without the means to influence POSCO,
either through selected representatives on POSCO’s BOD or through the exercise of voting rights
as shareholder, the GOK cannot direct POSCO to provide inputs to its customers for less than
adequate remuneration, argue respondents. Therefore, respondents maintain, the Department
must find that any subsidy ended by October 2000 and must calculate Dongbu’s cash deposit rate
on any future entries by deducting the subsidy found with respect to this program during the POI.
<P>
The Department’s Position
<P>
In Sheet and Strip, the Department first determined that the actions of POSCO should be
considered the actions of the GOK because it was a government-controlled company during
1997. See 64 FR 30642. We reaffirmed this decision in CTL Plate for 1998 and 1999 Sheet and
Strip for 1999. As such, we found that POSCO’s sales of inputs to Korean steel producers
constituted a subsidy because these sales were made for less than adequate remuneration. In
Sheet and Strip, the Department based its decision on six main factors: (1) GOK as largest
shareholder, (2) law restricting voting rights for public companies, (3) restriction in POSCO’s
Articles of Incorporation of voting rights for individual shareholders, (4) POSCO’s designation
as a public company, (5) appointment of POSCO’s Chairman by the President of Korea, and (6)
half of POSCO’s outside directors were appointed by the GOK and KDB.
<P>
In the instant investigation, record evidence demonstrates that many of the factors cited
above have changed in whole or in part. First, in 1997, the GOK owned 33 percent of POSCO’s
shares and was the largest shareholder; by 1999, and through the beginning of 2000, the GOK
reduced its shares to 15 percent. It further reduced its shares to 4.12 percent by October 2000,
and by March 2001, it held 3.02 percent of POSCO’s shares. By March 2001, shortly after the
POI, the GOK was no longer the largest shareholder; however, it remained the largest
shareholder during the POI.
<P>
Second, on September 26, 2000, the GOK removed POSCO’s “public company”
designation and thus terminated the provision of the law which restricted the voting rights for any
individual shareholder to exceed 3 percent of POSCO’s common shares. While the GOK
eliminated the law which restricted POSCO’s voting rights, POSCO did not remove the clause
mirroring this restriction from its Articles of Incorporation until March 2001, at the annual
shareholder’s meeting, held outside of the POI. The Department notes that in the POI addressed
in Sheet and Strip, the President of Korea appointed POSCO’s Chairman, and that he remained
the chairman throughout the present POI. He was subsequently appointed by the shareholders as
a whole, rather than the GOK, at the shareholders meeting in March 2001. As for the last factor
that the Department earlier relied upon as evidence of the GOK’s control of POSCO, half of the
outside directors being appointed by the GOK, in the current POI the number of outside directors
was reduced from four to two. Also, the voting process was revised so that large governmentcontrolled
shareholders could no longer automatically appoint a director.
<P>
While we recognize that both the GOK and POSCO have made substantial changes to
the ownership, voting rights and board membership, the Department is not convinced that during
the POI, POSCO acted on its own volition and was not government-controlled. While the GOK
reduced its shares from 15 percent to 4 percent during the POI, it was still the largest shareholder
and the primary reduction in shareholding came only in October 2000 near the end of the POI. In
addition, throughout the POI and until March 2001, POSCO’s Articles of Incorporation included
the individual shareholders’ voting rights restriction set forth by the GOK. Also, the Chairman
presiding over POSCO throughout the POI was appointed by the GOK. Therefore, we disagree
with respondents’ argument that during the POI, POSCO acted entirely without GOK direction.
<P>
Respondents also argued that there is no evidence that the GOK is directing POSCO to
sell inputs of HRC to other steel companies for less than adequate remuneration. They argue
that, not only do petitioners not make a convincing argument, there is no evidence on the record
supporting the finding of GOK-control or even a causal nexus for an indirect subsidy.
<P>
Respondents argue that POSCO’s pricing decisions are based on “ordinary” commercial
considerations, including market conditions such as import competition. They cite to the June
26, 2002, Memorandum to Melissa G. Skinner, Director: Meeting with Private Parties regarding
the Countervailing Duty Investigation of Certain Cold-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products from
Korea and Second Administrative Review of Stainless Steel Sheet and Strip from Korea (Private
Meetings Verification Report), where an analyst stated that, “POSCO used to provide HRC at a
low price, now they do not.” The analyst further stated that POSCO’s prices are now related to
the international market price. Respondents also cite to an antitrust case between POSCO and
the GOK. The GOK investigated POSCO under the antitrust law for not selling high-quality
HRC to HYSCO, a competitor of POSCO, for downstream cold-rolled products. In the antitrust
case, the GOK argued that POSCO is abusing its dominant position in the market by not selling
to HYSCO. The Korean Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) recently ruled in favor of the GOK,
and imposed fines. POSCO has signaled its intent to appeal. Respondents argue that if the GOK
controlled POSCO, then POSCO would have sold to HYSCO and the GOK would not have to
sue under its antitrust law to get POSCO to sell to HYSCO. We disagree with respondents’
argument that by POSCO taking into account market conditions, such as import competition, in
its pricing decision, it demonstrates that the GOK does not direct or control POSCO. While
POSCO may take into consideration certain market conditions, petitioners argue that respondents
must prove that the difference between the price charged and the adequate remuneration price is
exclusively due to factors other than government influence. We agree with petitioners that
POSCO’s taking into account market considerations does not, by itself, demonstrate an absence
of GOK control. We also disagree with respondents’ claim that POSCO’s antitrust case
positively affirms POSCO’s privatization. We find that this argument is not a definitive factor
demonstrating that the GOK does not control or direct POSCO. For instance, one could equally
conclude that POSCO has taken a benign approach to its monopolistic position in the HRC
market, unless it meets competition with a downstream competitor, where it takes advantage of
its monopolistic position and refuses to sell to the competitor. Likewise, there may be legal or
other reasons why the KFTC, as one arm of the government, would need to respond to a
complaint regarding price or market dominance behavior, and these are not evidence of a lack of
control otherwise of POSCO. The argument that if the GOK was controlling POSCO it would
not take up an antitrust case is not a persuasive indication that POSCO is not being controlled by
the GOK.
<P>
We recognize that substantial changes have occurred since our 1999 Sheet and Strip
determination, including notable developments in the period following the POI. However, the
record of the period subject to this investigation, 2000, shows continued GOK control over
POSCO for the entire period. This is particularly the case given that the GOK retained a
substantial shareholding until late in the POI and that some other aspects of government control
were not revised until after the POI. It is on the basis of these facts that we must make our
determination. Accordingly, we find that POSCO continued to be controlled by the GOK during
the entire POI.
<P>
Comment 2: POSCO’s Provision of Hot-rolled Coil at Less than Adequate Remuneration
<P>
In addition to constituting a financial contribution, petitioners argue that the provision of
HRC at less than adequate remuneration confers a benefit that is specific. Petitioners assert that
this program constitutes an automatically specific export subsidy under 19 U.S.C. 1677(5A)(B)
because cold-rolled producers pay POSCO less for HRC inputs if the finished product is
exported. Specifically, petitioners maintain that the evidence demonstrates that purchasers who
export a finished good incorporating POSCO’s HRC pay less than purchasers whose finished
product is sold domestically. Therefore, petitioners argue this constitutes an export subsidy and
urge the Department to allocate the benefit solely to exports, as it did in CTL Plate. Furthermore,
petitioners advocate that, when comparing the subsidized prices to the benchmark prices, the
Department ensure that the terms of delivery used in the benchmark match the subsidized prices.
<P>
Petitioners maintain that when imports are used as the benchmark, as in the instant case, the
Department’s methodology is to use the subject company’s actual cost of imports for comparison
purposes. Thus, petitioners argue, the benchmark includes all delivery charges and import duties.
Petitioners maintain that although section 771(5)(E)(iv) of the Act dictates the use of delivered
prices as the basis of comparison, the Department failed to follow this requirement of parallelism
in its Preliminary Determination because it compared f.o.b. prices of imports with delivered
prices for purchases from POSCO.
<P>
Respondents rebut petitioners’ statements, arguing that should the Department continue
to find this program countervailable, the correct denominator for measuring the benefit is sales of
all products made with HRC. Respondents state that petitioners have provided no evidence that
would support the finding that this program constitutes an export subsidy. Moreover,
respondents point out that in CTL Plate, POSCO was still employing a two-tiered domestic
pricing scheme and the Department found an export subsidy with respect to local export prices
and compared purchases from POSCO at the local export price to prices of imports.
<P>
Respondents maintain that in the Preliminary Determination, the Department changed its
analysis to reflect POSCO’s elimination of its two-tiered pricing policy and treated this program
as a domestic subsidy, comparing all purchases of HRC from POSCO to imports of HRC.
Therefore, argue respondents, the appropriate denominator is all sales of products made from
HRC, not exports of subject merchandise. In addition, respondents argue that petitioners do not
explain how the fact that POSCO has different payment terms for domestic and local export
purchases results in a benefit or an export subsidy. According to respondents, a closer look at the
alleged discount that exporters receive in the form of favorable payment terms fails to reveal how
purchasers at the local export price have the more favorable payment terms.
<P>
Respondents also rebut petitioners’ contention that the Department failed to use
comparable prices when determining if Dongbu’s purchases of HRC from POSCO were for less
than adequate remuneration. Respondents state that all freight charges incurred in shipping the
imported merchandise to Dongbu are included in the total price, and, therefore, the Department’s
calculations in the Preliminary Determination did follow the requirement of parallelism and
compared Dongbu’s delivered prices for imports with Dongbu’s delivered prices from POSCO.
<P>
Respondents argue that, should the Department continue to determine that POSCO is
selling HRC for prices at less than adequate remuneration, it must adjust the import prices used
as a benchmark for calculating the benefit to Dongbu to account for the impact of Dongbu’s
receipt of duty drawback. Respondents state that the Department verified that Dongbu received a
duty drawback for duties paid on imports of HRC during the POI, and since the Department
treated Dongbu’s input purchases from POSCO as a domestic subsidy, it must make an
adjustment to the monthly average unit prices it calculated for imports to take into account the
fact that Dongbu receives duty drawback on a majority of the import duties it pays. Respondents
maintain that comparing a duty-inclusive import price to POSCO’s domestic price would ignore
commercial reality and would have the effect of improperly inflating the amount of the subsidy.
<P>
Therefore, respondents urge the Department to apply the metric ton duty drawback actually
received by Dongbu during the POI and deduct it from the previously-calculated monthly
benchmarks to determine the amount of price differential between Dongbu’s purchases from
POSCO and its import purchases.
<P>
In addition, respondents purport that the appropriate sales denominator is all products
sold by Dongbu that are produced using HRC since the Department measured the benefit to
Dongbu bases on all of its purchases of HRC from POSCO.
<P>
Petitioners rebut this argument by respondents, asserting that the Department should tie
the benefit to all exports of cold-rolled steel. Petitioners maintain that in the Preliminary
Determination, the Department stated that it intended to continue to find this program tied to
subject merchandise; however, it did not do so. Petitioners argue that record evidence supports
tying the benefit to exports, as was done in CTL Plate. Petitioners argue that there is no basis for
allocating the subsidy to products other than cold-rolled steel. They assert that the Department
cannot assume that Dongbu internally transferred the subsidized cold-rolled products at below
market value, thereby passing a portion of the benefit to other downstream flat-rolled products.
Therefore, petitioners assert that the denominator must be restricted to coll-rolled products if it is
not restricted to exports.
<P>
The Department’s Position
<P>
Petitioners are correct in their characterization of CTL Plate, where the Department
attributed the benefit found over export sales of subject merchandise. However, in a subsequent
case, 1999 Sheet and Strip, the Department found that POSCO removed its two-tier pricing
policy and therefore, the Department compared all purchases from POSCO, not just local export
purchases. Therefore, the Department determined that it was more appropriate to compare all
purchases of HRC from POSCO to all import purchases of HRC. These purchases were not tied
to either subject merchandise or export of subject merchandise, but rather, to all products
produced using HRC. We find that the proper denominator for this program is Dongbu’s total
f.o.b. sales of merchandise using HRC.
<P>
In calculating the benefit that Dongbu received from purchasing HRC from POSCO at
less than adequate remuneration, section 351.511(a)(iv) of the CVD Regulations directs the
Department to compare delivered prices. Petitioners claim that the Department did not do this in
the preliminary determination. The Department agrees with respondents that the import prices
used to compare purchases of HRC from POSCO included freight charges. Therefore, the
Department will continue to calculate the benefit of this program by comparing delivered
purchases from POSCO by import purchases inclusive of freight.
<P>
Respondents claim that the Department erred in the calculation of this program’s subsidy
rate for the Preliminary Determination, by not making an adjustment for the duty drawn back for
items exported which included the imported HRC. Respondents state that the import prices
include duties paid, which duties the company subsequently receives back when it exports.
<P>
We agree with respondents. Adjusting for the drawback of import duties is consistent
with section 771(5)(E)(iv) of the Act which states that the adequacy of remuneration will be
determined in relation to prevailing market conditions which include price, quality, availability,
marketability, transportation, and other conditions of purchase of sale. The availability and use of
duty drawback in Korea is a condition of sale in Korea. Imports into Korea which are
subsequently exported are entitled to duty drawback. We verified that a large portion of the
import duties which are paid by Dongbu are drawn back by Dongbu. In calculating a benefit, the
goal is to derive net prices paid by Dongbu for both its purchases from POSCO and its import
purchases in order to make an appropriate comparison, we therefore find it necessary to apply
this adjustment to the import price to account for that portion of the import duties which are
refunded (or drawn back).
<P>
Comment 3: Exemption of VAT
<P>
Petitioners state that the Department is required to countervail subsidies discovered in the
course of an investigation, and they maintain that transactions of goods under a local letter of
credit that were discovered during verification to be exempt from VAT regulations constitute
such a new subsidy.
<P>
Respondents rebut the contention made by petitioners that transactions of goods under a
local letter of credit that are exempt from VAT regulations constitute a new subsidy.
Respondents state that since it is well established that the exemption of the VAT on exports is
not a subsidy, the exemption of the VAT on exported products manufactured using HRC is not a
subsidy.
<P>
Department’s Position:
<P>
Goods in Korea which are sold under a local export letter of credit are exempt from VAT
because these goods are destined for export. It is a well established tenet of the countervailing
duty law that VAT or sales tax exemptions on exported goods are not countervailable subsidies.
<P>
Comment 4: Direction of Credit
<P>
Petitioners argue that the Department should continue to countervail loans provided to
Dongbu, HYSCO, and POSCO, because such loans are inconsistent with commercial
considerations. Specifically, petitioners urge the Department to continue to countervail the
benefits derived from loans respondents received from domestic, privately-owned Korean banks
and GOK-owned banks because such loans are extended on government direction of low-cost
credit.
<P>
Additionally, petitioners argue that the Department should continue to countervail the
benefits arising from direct foreign loans and the issuance of offshore securities by Korean
companies. Petitioners maintain that the GOK has failed to demonstrate that it no longer
controls access to the loan market and, instead, the record illustrates that the GOK continued to
control access to foreign sources of credit during the POI. Petitioners claim that the Foreign
Exchange Transaction Act (FETA) does little to liberalize access to foreign loans and the inadvance
reporting system provision of the law differs little from the prior approval system that it
replaced. Prior approval is still required for certain categories of transactions (e.g., short-term
loans with a maturity of less than one year, depending on the credit rating of the borrower),
according to petitioners, and even under the in-advance reporting system, the GOK continues to
control access to foreign credit sources. Petitioners argue that the GOK admits that a notification
and registration process for all direct foreign currency loans and foreign securities continues to
exist. Moreover, petitioners declare that the Department’s verification report of the GOK
confirms that all long-term transactions greater than US $30 million must be registered prior to
the contract taking force and the withdrawal of funds. Petitioners claim that although
respondents have characterized the in-advance reporting system as a formality, the new system
appears no different from the in-advance reporting system found countervailable in CTL Plate.
See 64 FR 73176. In addition, petitioners conclude that the fact that the steel industry’s
borrowings from commercial banks may have declined is not evidence, as respondents assert,
that the GOK is no longer allocating credit.
<P>
Respondents rebut this position, arguing that the Department verified that unless the
FETA specifically lists the activity as one requiring approval, it is allowed without any GOK
approval. Respondents further maintain that since the FETA went into effect in April 1999, there
were no direct foreign loans or foreign securities issued that required GOK approval. Moreover,
respondents argue that petitioners’ reference to certain transactions that still require GOK
approval is purely theoretical, ignoring the fact that, in practice, no foreign loans or foreign
securities required approval during the POI. Respondents further refute petitioners’ statements
regarding the notification and registration process, arguing that the GOK went on to state that
registration of direct loans or foreign securities does not limit access to such funds. Respondents
assert that the only limitation on any company who wishes to obtain direct foreign loans and
foreign securities is the company’s own business strength and creditworthiness.
<P>
Petitioners, in their rebuttal briefs, point to the fact that respondents do not contest the
Department’s decision to countervail the loans from GOK-owned banks and private Korean
banks as evidence that respondents implicitly accept the underlying findings of directed credit.
Petitioners argue that the facts leading to earlier findings of GOK control have not changed, and
respondents have not demonstrated that the GOK no longer controls access to the foreign loan
market. Petitioners note that in the Preliminary Determination, the Department stated that the
new legislation, while it shows that the GOK is making strides, was not sufficient to warrant a
reconsideration of the direction of credit determination at that time. Petitioners maintain that
respondents have not provided evidence sufficient to overcome the Department’s prior findings.
<P>
Department’s Position:
<P>
In the Preliminary Determination, we stated that at verification we would closely examine
access to direct foreign loans (i.e., loans from offshore banks) and the issuance of offshore
foreign securities by Korean companies with respect to the 2000 period. At verification, we
reviewed the FETA and learned that when the FETA became effective in April 1999, the main
change governing foreign exchange transactions was the adoption of a negative system, whereby
companies can access foreign sources of funds unless certain limited restrictions apply. Under
the old positive approval system, a company could not obtain direct foreign loans or issue foreign
securities without obtaining GOK approval (see June 26, 2002, Memorandum to Melissa G.
Skinner, Director: Verification Report for the Government of Korea (GOK) and the Korea New
Iron &amp; Steel Technology Research Association (KNISTRA) in the Countervailing Duty
Investigation of Certain Cold-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products from Korea at page 1 (GOK
Verification Report at 1). Moreover, all long-term transactions under $30 million can be handled
directly with a foreign exchange bank, while long-term transactions greater than $30 million
must be registered with, although not approved by, MOFE (Id.).
<P>
We disagree with petitioners’ contention that the GOK continues to control access to
foreign sources of credit. We do find that the new system under the FETA differs significantly
from the approval system found countervailable in prior cases, including CTL Plate. In CTL
Plate, we found that under the old law, access to direct foreign loans still required the approval of
the MOFE (see 64 FR 73176 at 73179). Evidence collected at verification of the instant
investigation reveals that this type of system is no longer in place. Regarding petitioners’
comments about the notification and registration process, we do not find this system evidence of
government control; rather, it is common practice for any Central Bank to be notified of large
foreign currency transactions. More importantly, we verified the fact that the approval system
has been terminated. With the change in the law, companies now merely notify the government
that they are issuing offshore foreign securities or borrowing funds from offshore banks. We also
verified that these notifications are automatically registered by the government without
government approval. Therefore, due to the change in legislation, we determine that access to
direct foreign loans (i.e., loans from offshore banks) and the issuance of offshore foreign
securities by Korean companies is no longer controlled or directed by the GOK and no longer
countervailable.
<P>
Although, we learned that some short-term (i.e., less than one year) transactions still
require prior approval from MOFE, petitioners’ comments on the approval of short-term loans is
not germane to this issue. This is because the program in question is the government’s direction
of long-term credit. MOFE officials stated that they still require approval on these short-term
loans because it was these types of short-term loans used by Korean companies to finance capital
investment which helped to trigger the 1997 financial crisis.
<P>
Comment 5: Tax Programs
<P>
Petitioners argue that the Department should continue to countervail the benefits received
by respondents under investment tax credits, RSTA Articles 24 and 25. Petitioners state that the
benefit is the reduction in taxes payable and should be calculated based on the entire tax credit
claimed for the POI. Furthermore, petitioners maintain that the calculation should fully reflect
POSCO’s revised data submitted on April 4, 2002. In addition, petitioners assert that the
Department failed to countervail the entire amount of tax credits claimed under RSTA Articles
11 (Investments in Equipment to Develop Technology and Manpower) and 24 (Investments in
Productivity Increasing Facilities) for POSCO and Dongbu, and 25 (Investments in Specific
Facilities) for POSCO after the removal of the import substitution eligibility criterion in April
1998. Petitioners argue that the removal of the import substitution eligibility criterion does not
necessarily eliminate the specificity of the subsidy under RSTA Article 25, and demonstrating
that the legal eligibility for the tax reserve article has changed is not adequate to show nonspecificity.
<P>
Additionally, petitioners state that respondents have provided no evidence of the
actual distribution of benefits for any of the tax articles. Therefore, petitioners maintain, given
respondents’ refusal to provide this data, the Department must resort to facts otherwise available
and continue to find these benefits specific.
<P>
Respondents counter that the Department verified that for RSTA Articles 11, 24, 25, and
26, the GOK had eliminated the differential tax treatment between foreign and domestic goods
effective April 10, 1998, thereby eliminating prohibited subsidies and making the programs
consistent with WTO requirements. Respondents assert that the amount of the countervailable
subsidy found by the Department was only for those additional tax credits that were earned as a
result of the differential between the rates of tax credit on domestic and foreign goods (i.e., the
import substitution element), not the entire tax credit. Respondents point out that the basis for
the Department’s finding that only the amount of tax credit earned as a result of the import
substitution element of these programs was countervailable was that the tax credit programs were
otherwise non-specific. Respondents indicate that the Department determined in CTL Plate that
these benefits were non-specific, and note that petitioners have provided no new evidence in this
investigation to suggest that tax credits earned by companies under these RSTA articles can
result in a specific benefit when the tax credits did not result from the differential in tax credit
rates between domestic and foreign goods.
<P>
Furthermore, petitioners assert that the Department must countervail respondents’ use of
tax reserves. Petitioners state that while TERCL Articles 16 (Reserve for Export Loss) and 17
(Reserve for Overseas Market Development) have been repealed as of April 1998, companies
may still carry forward benefits under these articles. Thus, petitioners maintain that the
Department must continue to countervail these articles. Moreover, with respect to RSTA Article
9 (Technical Development Reserve Fund), petitioners argue that the Department erred by not
countervailing Dongbu’s benefits in the Preliminary Determination. Petitioners state that the
<P>
3 See Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination: Certain Stainless Steel Cooking Ware from
the Republic of Korea, 51 FR 42867 (November 26, 1986) (Cooking Ware).
<P>
Department assumed that Dongbu had not used this program because the company contributed
during the POI to its reserve account only at a three percent rate rather than at the higher five
percent rate available to firms in the capital goods sector. Petitioners argue that this was a
mistake because while Dongbu’s tax documents show that its 1999 additions to this reserve
account may have been based on the three percent rate, Dongbu’s tax documents and other
information on the record do not support this conclusion. In addition, petitioners assert that the
benefits from using this reserve at the three percent rate would still be countervailable unless
verified by the Department to be de facto non-specific. Petitioners assert that because the
Department asked the GOK to provide data, by industry and region, on companies who have
benefitted from each RSTA article and the GOK stated that such data is not compiled in a
database, the Department must apply the facts available. The facts available, according to
petitioners, are that the benefits to Dongbu are specific, as previously found in CTL Plate.
<P>
Respondents rebut this position, arguing that Dongbu made no additions to its Technical
Development Reserve Fund under RSTA Article 9 during the POI; it only reversed back to
income the scheduled portions of prior year contributions to this reserve. Respondents are clear
that in filing its tax return, Dongbu identified that it contributed to the reserve at the 3 percent
rate, leaving no room for petitioners’ claim that in prior years Dongbu may have contributed at a
higher rate because the form itself addressed only contributions made in those prior years and
unambiguously stated the applicable tax rate. Additionally, respondents assert that, as the
Department found in CTL Plate, petitioners have provided no additional evidence or information
that would alter the finding that this program is non-specific.
<P>
Petitioners further argue that HYSCO, which claims it did not benefit from the tax
reserve articles during the POI because it was in a tax loss situation in 1999, effectively received
a complete tax exemption resulting from its emptying of reserve accounts in the net loss year.
Petitioners contend that in tax year 1999, because it was facing a net loss financial position,
HYSCO returned its entire remaining balance, accumulated during the years prior to 1999, from
the reserve accounts to an income account. Instead of triggering an income tax liability,
however, HYSCO paid no tax on the amounts reverted because the company’s overall net loss in
1999 was greater than the amount reverted to the income accounts. Therefore, petitioners
conclude, HYSCO was able not only to defer tax payments but to avoid taxation altogether on
income that was earned in profitable years. Petitioners state that when measuring benefits
associated with tax reserve programs, the Department has traditionally relied on the methodology
it used in Cooking Ware,3 in which the Department treated the benefits arising from the use of
tax reserves as interest-free short-term loans because they provide a deferral of direct taxes.
<P>
Petitioners state that since 19 CFR §351.509 does not provide specific guidelines relating to a tax
benefit that arises in a tax loss year, the Department must countervail the difference between the
actual taxes paid and the taxes paid under normal circumstances. Under normal circumstances
(i.e., absent the tax program), argue petitioners, HYSCO would have paid taxes on the income
regardless of when it was reverted and would have paid its 1999 year-end outstanding corporate
taxes associated with the reserve programs in 2000. In the case of HYSCO, petitioners assert,
where a tax exemption is conferred, the Department should countervail the entire amount of tax
liability that is returned to an income account during the POI. Thus, this would effectively
amount to treating the amount of the deferred and then exempted tax as loan forgiveness, argue
petitioners.
<P>
Respondents counter that there was no revenue forgone by the government with respect to
HYSCO’s use of RSTA Article 9 and TERCL Article 16 tax reserves during the POI because,
regardless of its use of the programs, HYSCO had no income tax liability in fiscal year 1999.
Respondents assert that HYSCO did nothing more than what was required under the law
concerning these programs when it reverted the remaining tax reserves to income in fiscal year
1999. Moreover, respondents explain that HYSCO will not be able to avoid taxation altogether
on income earned in profitable years, as petitioners allege. Instead, respondents declare, by
including as income in fiscal year 1999 the amounts of the reserves reverted to income, HYSCO
reduced its net tax loss for fiscal year 1999 and thus reduced the amount of tax loss carried
forward for future years. Therefore, at a future date, HYSCO’s tax liability will be higher as a
result of the lowering of its tax loss for fiscal year 1999. Regarding HYSCO’s use of RSTA
Article 9, respondents refute petitioners’ claim that there is a countervailable subsidy to HYSCO,
arguing that there is no evidence on the record to indicate that HYSCO accrued its reserve at the
5 percent rate, and even if it did, the only benefit would be from that portion of the reserve that
was accrued above the 3 percent rate.
<P>
Department’s Position:
<P>
The Department agrees with petitioners that for the final calculations the Department will
use revised data, either submitted after the original questionnaire response or collected during
verification. The Department disagrees with petitioners’ allegation that it did not properly
calculate Dongbu and POSCO’s benefits received under RSTA Articles 11, 24, and 25. We
disagree with petitioners’ argument that the removal of the import substitution criterion in April
1998 does not eliminate the specificity of these credits. In fact, the Department finds that the
change of law eliminating the import substitution criterion makes this program no longer
specific. The Department continues to find that any credits received prior to April 1998 and at a
rate that differentiates between domestically-produced facilities and foreign facilities is still
countervailable. Therefore, for the final determination the Department will countervail the
difference between tax credits received under the import substitution scheme.
<P>
We agree with petitioners that under tax reserves articles 16 and 17, any outstanding
balance is specific under section 771(5A)(A) of the Act. We disagree with their assertion that we
erred in the Preliminary Determination by not countervailing RSTA article 9 for Dongbu. In
CTL Plate, we determined that RSTA 9, former TERCL article 8, was specific as the capital
goods industry was able to claim a higher rate than other industries. See 64 FR 73192.
However, record evidence demonstrates that Dongbu did not claim the reserve at the capital
goods industry rate, therefore, the Department continues to find that Dongbu did not use this
program.
<P>
The Department disagrees with respondents’ assertion that HYSCO did not receive a
benefit under RSTA article 9 and TERCL article 16. We invited parties to comment on the
methodology applied to calculate a benefit for tax reserves. The tax reserves allow a company to
defer certain amounts of tax liabilities until a future date. The Department continues to find that
this methodology is appropriate. However, when a company is at a tax loss and is able to return
to taxable income part of the reserve amount, and does not pay taxes on it, that company is
receiving a tax exemption. Therefore, as noted earlier, we found that HYSCO received a
countervailable subsidy by being exempt from paying taxes on the amount that it reversed to
taxable income for the tax year covered during the POI.
<P>
Comment 6: Research and Development (R&amp;D) Subsidies
<P>
Petitioners explain that in CTL Plate, the Department countervailed R&amp;D subsidies
provided through KNISTRA. Petitioners assert that the Department should continue to
countervail these subsidies, as it did in the Preliminary Determination, and must ensure that its
final calculation includes all KNISTRA-related projects discovered during the instant
investigation.
<P>
In addition, petitioners urge the Department to apply facts available to countervail the
benefits respondents received from other R&amp;D subsidies beyond those countervailed in CTL
Plate. Petitioners state that, to the extent that respondents benefitted from R&amp;D programs
beyond those CTL Plate, the Department is fully justified in finding these benefits specific based
on facts available, since the GOK did not provide the requested data. For example, petitioners
state that although the evidence demonstrates that POSCO participated in an array of
government-sponsored R&amp;D projects, underwritten by various government agencies including
MOCIE, MOST, MOE, and MOCAT, the GOK failed to disclose these programs and POSCO
provided partial information. Petitioners argue that many of the programs are steel specific and
must be countervailed at the final.
<P>
Respondents rebut petitioners’ suggestion that the Department countervail unreported
R&amp;D subsidies on a facts available basis. Respondents assert that the R&amp;D projects discussed at
verification were listed in respondents’ questionnaire responses. Regarding the Coal-based
Smelting Reduction Technology Development Project, also known as FINEX, respondents
maintain that the Department examined this program at verification and found that there were no
government contributions to this project during the POI. In addition, respondents maintain that
the Department verified each company’s R&amp;D projects and accounts, as well as the government
agencies that provided the benefits, and found no discrepancies in their responses. Respondents
further argue that the Department fully verified all of POSCO’s government-supported R&amp;D
projects and found no unreported benefits or discrepancies in POSCO’s responses. Regarding
this program that petitioners argue POSCO did not report, respondents argue that it was reported
in CTL Plate and the reason no benefit was reported during the POI was that the GOK’s
contributions ended before the POI. Furthermore, respondents assert that the Department
examined R&amp;D assistance to POSCO from years prior to the POI to determine whether any
grants should be allocated over time (including FINEX) and found that due to their small size,
these grants should be expensed in the year of receipt.
<P>
Department’s Position:
<P>
At verification, we examined all R&amp;D assistance POSCO received, specifically from
MOCIE, MOST, MOE, and MOCAT and the FINEX project (see POSCO Verification Report at
3-4). We verified that all support received from those agencies was reported by respondents (see
GOK Verification Report at 8-9). We found no discrepancies. We also verified that grants
provided in support of the FINEX project were all received before the POI and would have been
expensed in the year of receipt (see POSCO Verification Report at 4). Therefore, we determine
that we have countervailed all outstanding R&amp;D assistance received by POSCO as well as the
other respondents.
<P>
Comment 7: The GOK’s Provision of Infrastructure at Kwangyang Bay
<P>
Petitioners state that, in Certain Steel Products, the Department found that the GOK
provided countervailable infrastructure subsidies at Kwangyang Bay that benefitted POSCO.
Petitioners assert that since respondents have not provided any new evidence or information,
these subsidies should continue to be countervailed using the previously calculated benefit
stream. Additionally, petitioners argue the GOK continued to provide countervailable
infrastructure subsidies at Kwangyang Bay from 1991 to the present, including in 1997 the
construction of a new port that involved a government financial contribution in the form of a
direct transfer of funds. Petitioners point out that in Certain Steel Products and CTL Plate, the
Department treated the GOK infrastructure expenditures at Kwangyang Bay as non-recurring
grants to POSCO and applied its standard grant methodology. Petitioners maintain that the
Department should continue to apply the same methodology in the instant investigation and
countervail the GOK’s construction outlays for Phase 2 (1995-2003) at Kwangyang Bay.
<P>
Petitioners maintain that the benefit associated with the infrastructure is specific because it is
limited to, or at least disproportionally enjoyed by, the steel sector. Petitioners state that this is
evident because the steel industry is one of only a few industries with operations at Kwangyang
Bay and the Department has previously determined that the steel industry is the enterprise around
which the rest of Kwangyang Bay was built.
<P>
Respondents agree with petitioners observation that the GOK has made substantial
investments at Kwangyang Bay; however, they disagree with petitioners’ claim that POSCO uses
or benefits from the container port. Respondents note that while POSCO is located in the general
area, there is a physical separation between the new container port and the port facilities used by
POSCO. They point to a map that was collected at verification to demonstrate that there is a
physical separation between the port facilities found countervailable and the new container port
facilities. (See GOK Verification Exhibit 6). Respondents argue that there is no basis for the
Department to conclude that POSCO received any benefit from the GOK’s container project at
Kwangyang Bay. Therefore, the Department should not follow petitioners’ recommendation of
finding the GOK’s investments as being directed towards POSCO.
<P>
Department’s Position:
<P>
The Department finds that no new information has been presented during this
investigation to warrant a change in the previous determination that POSCO received a benefit
from the GOK’s infrastructure subsidies at Kwangyang Bay until 1991. Therefore, the
Department continues to find this program countervailable. However, the Department disagrees
with petitioners’ allegation that POSCO received a benefit from the GOK’s construction of
container ports at Kwangyang Bay. In Plate in Coils, we verified and determined that neither
steel inputs nor steel products are shipped through the container terminal at Kwangyang Bay.
We found that the GOK’s expenditures at the container terminal did not provide a benefit to
POSCO. See Plate in Coils at 15536. Based on the Plate in Coils finding and no new
information on the record, we determine that the GOK’s additional expenditures for the container
terminal provided during the POI do not confer a benefit to POSCO.
<P>
Comment 8: The GOK’s Provision of Infrastructure at Asan Bay
<P>
Petitioners assert that the Department must countervail infrastructure subsidies at Asan
Bay. These subsidies, according to petitioners, include outlays at Asan Bay for the development
of roads, berths, and estate development, and GOK commitments to expand the seaport at Asan
Bay prior to 1995 and to support infrastructure projects related to the Tangjin ironworks,
including money for roads, industrial water facilities, distribution depots, and electric power
stations. Petitioners assert that the infrastructure assistance at Asan Bay confers a benefit on
producers of cold-rolled steel, specifically Dongbu. Petitioners argue that the Department erred
in its Preliminary Determination when it stated that the cost of road construction is included in
the purchase price of the land. Petitioners argue that the infrastructure subsidies at issue are
wholly distinct from the provision of land at less than adequate remuneration. Petitioners claim
that the Department cannot collapse these subsidies or treat the purchase price for land as an
offset to an infrastructure subsidy. Finally, petitioners assert that the benefits conferred are
specific, as evidenced by the fact that steel companies dominate the Kodai region in Asan Bay.
<P>
Moreover, petitioners state that the record demonstrates that only a limited number of companies
and industries were invited to operate at Asan Bay, and, therefore, the benefits from this subsidy
are specific.
<P>
Respondents counter that there were no infrastructure subsidies provided to Dongbu.
They note that the Department investigated these expenditures in the CTL Plate remand
determination and found that the roads built in Asan Bay were part of the country’s general
highway and road system, and were found to be general infrastructure, thus not countervailable.
Respondents also address the GOK’s expenditures with respect to Asan Bay’s estate
development. The actual costs of the industrial sites were recovered through the sale of land to
various companies. Respondents point out that Dongbu did not use any port berths constructed
by the GOK; rather, Dongbu constructed its own port berth which was subsequently reverted
back to the GOK. Dongbu paid the appropriate tariff rate for water, electricity, and sewage.
<P>
They note that the facilities providing water to Dongbu also provide water to a substantial area,
and that the sewage disposal facilities were located in the Poseung industrial site, which is across
from Dongbu’s site in the Kodai industrial site. Respondents support the Department’s finding
in the Preliminary Determination that the GOK did not provide countervailable infrastructure
benefits at Asan Bay. See, 64 FR 9694-95.
<P>
Department’s Position:
<P>
The Department affirms its Preliminary Determination, where it found that the GOK did
not provide a financial contribution as the cost of roads are included in the price of the land. The
Department also verified that Dongbu built and paid for any additional roads within its industrial
site, and therefore the GOK did not provide a financial contribution. Consistent with our CTL
Plate remand redetermination, we continue to find that the construction of the water, sewage and
electricity facilities were not specific to Dongbu or the steel industry. Therefore, we find that
Dongbu did not receive countervailable subsidies from the GOK’s provision of infrastructure at
Asan Bay. We also verified that Dongbu paid the appropriate tariff rate for the water, electricity,
and sewerage services used at Asan Bay.
<P>
Comment 9: Provision of Land at Asan Bay: Land Price and Benchmark
<P>
Petitioners argue that in its Preliminary Determination, the Department correctly
countervailed Dongbu’s land purchases at Asan Bay. Petitioners point to the fact that the
Department verified that Dongbu contracted with Koland to purchase land at the Kodai Industrial
Estate at Asan Bay and assert that this sale of land constitutes a financial contribution under the
statute. Moreover, petitioners maintain that, as the Department preliminarily found, the transfer
occurred at a price below market value and therefore conferred a benefit. Petitioners affirm the
Department’s calculation of the benefit associated with these land discounts and state that the
Department should continue to apply its standard grant methodology at the final. Petitioners also
declare that the Department correctly found that the benefits are limited to Dongbu and are
therefore specific. Additionally, petitioners maintain that the Department correctly countervailed
the adjustments to Dongbu’s final purchase price to reflect interest earned by the company’s prepayments
for the land. Alternatively, petitioners suggest that the Department could consider the
interest rebate, the sum the GOK paid to Dongbu for payments Dongbu had previously made to
the GOK, a distinct financial contribution in the form of a direct transfer of funds.
<P>
Respondents assert that petitioners ignore information provided by the GOK, Dongbu and
the Department’s verification findings with respect to the issues of: the contract price reduction
and the interest rebate by the GOK at the closing of the land deal. Respondents disagree with
petitioners’ contention that the price originally advertised and announced by Koland represents
“fair market value.” Respondents state that the original-published prices for the industrial land
sites at Asan Bay were proposed prices for the land, estimates which were to be revised based on
the actual development costs as determined at the time of settlement. Respondents assert that a
more appropriate way of characterizing the initial price announcement is as a “cost-plus” price
(i.e., the final actual costs plus 10 percent profit). By the time of settlement, Koland’s profit
component had been explicitly eliminated from the final price. Respondents concede that
Koland’s removal of the 10 percent profit component constitutes a subsidy.
<P>
Respondents state that the Department improperly calculated and vastly overstated
Dongbu’s benefit from its purchase of land at Asan Bay. For one, respondents maintain that the
land price discount was not in fact a discount; instead, it was simply an adjustment to the final
purchase price reflecting the lower actual development costs incurred. Respondents state that the
Department verified that the final calculated price per square meter for land at the Kodai
industrial site included various direct costs and indirect expenses, including capitalized expenses,
which reflect the cost of capital (i.e., interest) on the GOK’s expenditures up to December 31,
1998, the settlement date. The Department also verified the revisions in Dongbu’s land purchase
contracts as a result of the changes in land development costs and the cost changes that occurred
between the time of Dongbu’s revised contracts and the settlement date, respondents state.
Respondents maintain that the capitalized expenses were not actual expenses incurred in the
development of the Kodai site but instead reflect the time value of Koland’s development costs
incurred during the period of development so that the final settlement price reflected the present
value of Koland’s expenditures as of the settlement date. Therefore, respondents argue, the
original published price was only a proposed price that both parties understood was subject to
change based on the GOK’s actual development costs. The GOK’s actual development costs
were lower than the original proposed price, and, explain respondents, it is for this reason the
price paid by Dongbu was lower than the original published price. Respondents assert that in
using the original proposed selling price as the benchmark and treating any amount that Dongbu
paid below this benchmark as a discount, the Department ignored the commercial reality of the
transaction and overstated Dongbu’s benefit. Respondents urge the Department to use the actual
verified development costs as the benchmark.
<P>
Petitioners rebut respondents’ argument that the published land price is not an appropriate
benchmark. They provide three points on why this argument is without merit: (1) it is not
supported by fact; (2) it requires a cost-to-government standard; and (3) it provided no evidence
that the published price was just a starting price. First, petitioners maintain that respondents’
argument is not supported by the facts on the record. They point to the record which states that
Koland established its published price at Asan Bay by asking an appraisal association to select
three appraisal companies to appraise the cost and the value of the land. Then Koland went
through a three step-process to sell the land. It acquired the land, announced the sale of the land,
and then negotiated a contract with the company. Petitioners contend that the GOK deliberately
established the list price of land sites at Asan Bay, and that the list price was much more than a
mere “offer price.” Second, petitioners take issue with respondents’ cost-to-government
standard. Petitioners state that while the cost may have been low to the GOK, that does not mean
that the benefit to Dongbu was also limited. Petitioners assert that as a matter of law, the
benchmark used cannot be based on the GOK’s cost; rather, the Department must apply a market
benchmark. Petitioners also note that respondents have not offered an alternative benchmark.
<P>
Petitioners maintain that this published price comports with the benefit-to-recipient mandate
reflected in the statue. See section 771(5)(E) of the Act. Lastly, petitioners contend that if the
published land price was not a valid benchmark, then respondent had the opportunity to supply
evidence that this was the case. For instance, respondents could have demonstrated that other
land sale contracts at Asan Bay were merely starting points, and that Dongbu, relative to other
land buyers, received no special treatment. Petitioners also point to the Department’s finding in
CTL Plate where it used as the benchmark Koland’s published land price for Asan Bay.
<P>
Petitioners discuss the Department’s hierarchy of benchmarks for the provision of less
than adequate remuneration under section 351.511 of the CVD Regulations, noting that no
private sellers exist for use as an established market benchmark. As there is no private
benchmark, the Department is directed under section 351.511(a)(2)(iii) to determine whether the
government generally applied “market principles” in setting prices for the good or service in
question. Petitioners contend that the land price in question includes non-commercial factors
like the GOK’s waiver of profits and periodic lowering of the agreed contract price. Petitioners
support the Department’s Preliminary Determination, where it used Koland’s advertised land
price as the benchmark.
<P>
Petitioners further argue that respondents’ reliance on the contracts as evidence that the
price of the land was readjusted to reflect the GOK’s actual cost does not fulfill the statutory and
regulatory requirements. Petitioners assert that the advertised list price is the proper benchmark
and that the GOK’s costs are legally irrelevant. Petitioners also argue that the Department should
ignore respondents’ claim that Dongbu’s benefit was limited to the amount of profit waived by
the GOK.
<P>
In the Preliminary Determination, the Department calculated a benefit for two separate
subsidies, the land price discount and the interest-earned refund. Respondents argue that an
examination of the verified record reveals that the interest-earned refund did not provide Dongbu
with a specific subsidy. Respondents maintain that the Department improperly treated the
interest-earned refund as a specific subsidy to Dongbu, ignoring the fact that this interest-earned
refund was an integral part of the whole pricing formula for determining the final settlement
price of land at Asan Bay. Respondents profess that this refund for interest earned on
prepayments was specifically provided for in the contract and did not result in a lowering of the
price Dongbu paid for the land; instead, it was an adjustment made to account for the time value
of money that Dongbu had prepaid so that the amount Dongbu paid the GOK at settlement
reflected the present value of Dongbu’s payments as of the settlement date. Respondents assert
that the amounts of interest earned on Dongbu’s advance payments were treated as part of its
total payments and were applied to the total price for each site to determine the net amount due
from Dongbu at the final settlement. Furthermore, respondents state that this adjustment was
provided to both parties, as the GOK also received a similar credit by including its capitalized
expenses as part of the purchase price. For these reasons, argue respondents, the credit for
interest earned on advance payments did not provide a specific benefit to Dongbu and should not
be treated as a countervailable subsidy.
<P>
As noted above in petitioners’ case briefs, they contend that the Department should
continue to find that the adjustments made to Dongbu’s final purchase price are countervailable
for the final determination. Petitioners argue the interest rebates further deepen the
countervailable benefit to Dongbu from the purchase of land. Petitioners also argue that the
Department could find that the interest rebates are a distinct financial contribution in the form of
a direct transfer of funds. Moreover, petitioners cite to the CTL Plate remand redetermination,
where the Court of International Trade (CIT) directed the Department to reconsider its original
finding where the interest rebates were found not to be countervailable. See 64 at 73184. In the
CTL Plate remand redetermination, the Department found that the interest rebate provided a
countervailable benefit to the company, and that the GOK provided a financial contribution as
revenue foregone, and that it was specific to a limited amount of users. Petitioners counter
respondents’ assertion that the interest rebate was paid pursuant to provisions in the land sale
contract, with the argument that a contract cannot insulate a subsidy from being countervailed.
Department’s Position:
<P>
The Department in the Preliminary Determination determined that Dongbu purchased
land at Asan Bay for less than adequate remuneration. We affirm that decision in this final
determination, however, based upon the results of verification we have modified the benchmark
price used to quantify a portion of the benefit conferred under this program.
<P>
In our Preliminary Determination, we used Koland’s published price as our benchmark
and compared that price to the actual price paid by Dongbu. During verification we found that
the published price in the original sales announcement was only an estimated price and that the
sales contracts for land specify that the land price is subject to change. See GOK Verification
Report at page 9 and 10. We verified that the published price of land in the original sales
announcement included the costs of the land and the costs of land development expenses. Id. We
also verified that there were several revisions of the sales price between Koland and Dongbu.
Some of the revisions were due to the fact that a portion of the land development, which was
included in the original published price, was deducted from the sales price because Dongbu
decided to contract out this portion of the land development to a private company rather than pay
Koland to perform this land development. See Dongbu Verification Report at page 5. However,
Koland still provided some of the land development expenses which were included in the
published price. These land development activities included constructing roads and laying pipes
and water lines. The estimated costs of these land development expenses were included in the
published price. However, our review of Koland’s budget records during verification
demonstrated that the final costs of the land development incurred by Koland were lower than the
estimated land development costs included in the original published land price. Therefore, there
were revisions to the published price to account for these lower, actual land development costs.
See GOK Verification Report at 9 and 10. For purposes of this final determination, we are not
using the published price as our benchmark because we verified that the published price was
estimated. We are instead basing our benchmark price on the final revised price charged to
Dongbu for the land. However, adjustments are required in order to calculate our benchmark.
<P>
Under section 771(5)(E)(iv) of the Act, the determination of the adequacy of
remuneration is determined based upon prevailing market conditions. To determine whether a
subsidy was provided when Koland sold land at the industrial site at Asan Bay, the first
preference under the CVD Regulations for a benchmark would be the price of land in that area as
set by a private party. In this case, the only industrial land for sale is by the government.
Although there were no private sellers of industrial land at Asan Bay, Dongbu contracted with a
private party for land development. During verification, we determined that the price charged to
Dongbu for land development was based upon the private land developer’s costs plus ten percent
to account for profit. We verified that although Koland included its full costs in its final price
charged to Dongbu, Koland did not include any profit in its price. Because the prevailing market
conditions include a profit factor of ten percent, we have calculated a ten percent profit factor and
added that profit factor to the final land price charged to Dongbu in order to calculate our
benchmark.
<P>
We disagree with petitioners’ argument that the use of this benchmark constitutes a costto-
government analysis. Under section 771(5)(E) of the Act, the Department will determine that
“a benefit shall normally be treated as conferred where there is a benefit to the recipient.” In this
case, the Department is not concerned with the cost that the GOK incurred, but rather, it is
concerned with the amount of the benefit that Dongbu received from purchasing land at Asan
Bay. We verified that prevailing market conditions for the price of land at Asan Bay includes
both costs and profit. We verified that the government accurately determined the costs for land
and land development in its final price charged to Dongbu for land at the industrial estate at Asan
Bay but that the government did not include profit in that price. Therefore, we included a profit
component in our benchmark price. This benchmark does calculate the benefit based upon the
benefit to the recipient because Dongbu, if it had purchased the land from a private party, would
have paid a price based on the costs of the land (and land development) plus a profit of 10
percent. Our benchmark price includes both the costs of the land plus 10 percent profit. The fact
that the costs are derived from the actual expenses incurred by the government does not mean
that we have constructed a price based on a cost-to-government analysis rather than using a
market-based standard. That statement would only be true if we based our benchmark price
solely on the government’s costs without making an adjustment for profit. We also note that the
cost of the land to Koland was not determined by the government but was set by independent
appraisal companies. See GOK Verification Report at 9.
<P>
The Department also affirms its Preliminary Determination finding that the “interest
earned” on advanced payments is countervailable. We find that Dongbu received a benefit by
being reimbursed for payments made prior to the final settlement; moreover, we find that a
financial contribution was provided by the GOK as revenue foregone. During verification, we
determined that Dongbu was able to commence construction on the site before final payment was
made and that construction had begun after the first payment. Therefore, Dongbu had full use of
the land at the time the first payment was made, not when the final payment was made. It is
standard commercial practice that payments for land may be paid over time. However, it is not
standard commercial practice that at the time of the final payment, the purchaser of land is
credited and reimbursed for earlier payments made before that last payment. Dongbu contracted
a private party to undertake certain land development on its land at Asan Bay. Like the payment
schedule set forth in the land purchase contract between Koland and Dongbu, the private party
required payments over time for its land development activities. Thus, payments were required
while the private party was undertaking land development activities for Dongbu, not when the
land development was completed. However, the private party did not make an “interest earned”
deduction on the final settlement to account for Dongbu’s payments made before the final
payment of the contract was made. Therefore, an adjustment for earlier payments at the time of
final settlement is inconsistent with prevailing market conditions, and thus this adjustment made
by the government to Dongbu’s final settlement payment is countervailable.
<P>
Comment 10: Provision of Land at Asan Bay: Fees Waived
<P>
Petitioners argue that waivers of any fees associated with the land purchase at Asan Bay
amount to a financial contribution in the form of revenue forgone and must be countervailed as a
grant, as they were in CTL Plate. Petitioners state that the benefit is the full amount of the
contractual payment not made.
<P>
Respondents note that petitioners were correct in their analysis that the management fees
associated with Dongbu’s land contract were revised with each land contract revision. However,
respondents point out that this issue has not been properly reviewed by the Department, either
through supplemental questionnaires, the Preliminary Determination, or during verification.
Therefore, they maintain that it is difficult to respond to petitioners’ late allegation. Respondents
deduce from the various contracts that: (1) the management fee is separate from the purchase
price of the land; (2) for Kodai site 1-2, 1-2-1, the management fee was reduced with each
contract, when Dongbu Corp. took over land development from Koland; and (3) the last contracts
signed in June 1997, were based on revised cost estimates as of April 30, 1997, which contained
additional revisions to the management fees. Respondents note that during verification the
Department focused on Koland’s calculation of the final land price and Dongbu’s payments and
not on when the management fees were due. They further stress that nowhere on the record is
there any indication of when or whether Dongbu paid any management fees in relation to the two
Kodai sites. Respondents dispute petitioners’ assumptions that: (1) Koland had no independent
right to reduce or eliminate the management fees even though circumstances had changed
substantially from the time of the first contract to the conclusion of the settlement; (2) the
management fees were a necessary part of the total price and that a reduction or elimination
constitutes a financial contribution in terms of revenue foregone; and (3) the lack of record
evidence demonstrating that management fees were paid, when not being investigated, indicates
that no payment were made. Also, respondents note that the publication price that the
Department used as the benchmark in the Preliminary Determination does not make any mention
of management fees. Respondents further state that it is not apparent that there is a legal
obligation for Koland to collect such a fee. Moreover, respondents claim that petitioners have
proffered no reason for the Department to conclude that Koland was required to collect a
management fee; therefore, there is no basis for the Department to determine that Dongbu
received a countervailable benefit.
<P>
Department’s Position:
<P>
As noted above, the determination of the adequacy of remuneration is determined upon
prevailing market conditions. To determine whether a subsidy was provided when Koland sold
land at the industrial site at Asan Bay, the first preference for a benchmark would be the price of
land in that area as set by a private party. In this case, the only industrial land for sale is by the
government. Although there were no private sellers of industrial land at Asan Bay, Dongbu
contracted with a private party for land development. During verification, we determined that the
price charged to Dongbu for land development was based upon the private land developers costs
plus ten percent to account for profit. There is no information on the record indicating that the
private land developer charged Dongbu any other fees, such as management fees. Because the
private party did not charge Dongbu a management fee for development of the land at Asan Bay,
we have no basis for finding that the lack of charge or collection of a similar fee for the purchase
of that land at Asan Bay constitutes a subsidy.
<P>
Comment 11: Exemption of Port Fees under the Harbor Act
<P>
Petitioners maintain that the non-commercial nature of this program is demonstrated by
the lengthy fee waivers negotiated under the Harbor Act. Due to the fact that only companies
constructing facilities under the Harbor Act are eligible for this scheme, petitioners state the
benefit is specific.
<P>
Regarding petitioners’ claim that a new subsidy exists with respect to the exemption of
port fees as compensation for construction costs to companies that build port berths and revert
them to the GOK when the compensation cost includes a profit to the developer, respondents
contend that petitioners’ claim is illogical. Respondents disagree with petitioners’ dual positions
that Dongbu received a subsidy because Koland did not include in its purchase price a profit with
respect to the costs in incurred for the land that Dongbu purchased, where a commercial
developer would, and that as a commercial developer (of the port berth), Dongbu should not
receive a 10 percent profit in the total development costs of the reverted port for which it is being
compensated. Respondents argue that petitioners cannot have it both ways; either Dongbu
received a subsidy when Koland did not act in accordance with commercial reality by not
including a 10 percent profit or Dongbu received a subsidy because the GOK allows Dongbu,
commercial developer, to earn a 10 percent profit as compensation for constructing a port.
<P>
Respondents concede that the absence of the profit element in the land price provides a subsidy,
and, therefore, advance that the Department should find that the profit element in the
compensation equation is not countervailable.
<P>
Respondents also rebut petitioners’ argument that the waivers are unusually lengthy.
Respondents restate that Dongbu, not the GOK, incurred the costs for building the port facilities,
and even with the reversion of the port to the GOK, the GOK owns additional infrastructure for
which it did not incur costs to build. The GOK does not build the infrastructure; instead, those
companies (Dongbu) that need the infrastructure build it, incur all costs, and receive exemptions
for fees that would normally be due to the GOK. Respondents also remark that the idea of
compensation is only a relative term. For example, they note that while Dongbu paid VAT on
the costs incurred in constructing the port berth, VAT is not included in the calculation of the
amount of compensation due to Dongbu. They also state that the compensation amount is
calculated in nominal terms, and, therefore, the amount of fees exempted anytime in the possible
70 years that Dongbu may receive exemptions will offset Dongbu’s costs at their face value. The
calculation does not take into account the time value of Dongbu’s costs incurred years earlier.
Respondents maintain that a realistic assessment is not that Dongbu received a subsidy, but
rather, that Dongbu will never fully be compensated for the costs it incurred in constructing the
port facilities that it reverted to the GOK.
<P>
Department’s Position:
<P>
In Certain Steel Products, the Department found that POSCO was exempt from paying
fees for the use of the port berths, after building it and reverting it to the GOK. As POSCO was
the only company entitled to use the berths at the port facility free of charge, the Department
found that this program was limited in number and was therefore specific. See 58 FR 37347-48.
In Sheet and Strip the Department revised this determination, and found that the Harbor Act was
not specific under section 771(5A)(D(iii) of the Act, as it was not limited in number; rather, it
was open to a large range of industries. It is the Department’s practice not to revisit prior
determinations unless new information has been presented. However, the information on the
record for this case warrants revisiting this issue with respect to the excessive exemption period
provided to Dongbu.
<P>
As established in Sheet and Strip, it is normal for a company that builds a port berth and
reverts it to the GOK, not to pay usage fees and to collect fees until the company has been fully
compensated for its construction costs. The Department finds that in this case, Dongbu actually
will be exempt from paying usage fees for up to 70 years. The actual useful life and depreciation
period of these assets is much less than 70 years. Thus, we find that Dongbu is receiving a
benefit from the GOK by not having to pay usage fees for the use of the port berth for such an
extended time period. Therefore, we find that the GOK is providing a financial contribution in
the form of revenue foregone and that it is specific to Dongbu. As noted earlier, the benefit is
the full amount of the yearly exemption provided to Dongbu under this program.
<P>
We also note that respondents’ statement with respect to the treatment of profit under this
program and under the provision of land at Asan Bay is incorrect; just because profit is included
as part of the price benchmark in the Asan Bay program does not mean that a profit component
should be included in the compensation being provided to the respondent. The determination of
the benefit for the provision of land at Asan Bay is based upon the adequacy of remuneration
which is determined on prevailing market conditions. Therefore, as agreed by all parties, land
transactions from private parties include an element of profit. Because the government did not
include profit in the price of industrial land sold to Dongbu, then Dongbu received a benefit
based on the amount of profit which would have been paid by Dongbu if it had purchased the
land from a private party.
<P>
With respect to the compensation determined by the GOK under the Harbor Act, the
calculation of the benefit is still determined based upon the benefit to the recipient. Set aside the
fact that the full amount of exemption provided to Dongbu is countervailable because of the
excessive exemption period it received under this program. Assume that the only difference
between Dongbu and all the other uses of this program is that the GOK rebates to Dongbu not
only the costs the company incurred but also a ten percent profit which is not provided to any
other recipient. Respondents would argue that the profit component would not be
countervailable because the market dictates that profit should be included in a market price.
<P>
However, that logic does not follow in this situation. This is because the original purpose of the
program is to compensate Dongbu for its construction costs of infrastructure at Asan Bay. In
constructing these facilities, Dongbu did not pay profit to itself. Therefore profit is not an
expenditure which was incurred by Dongbu. Its reimbursement is limited to its actual
expenditures incurred by the company; profit not being one of these. If the government included
a ten percent profit factor, then the government is over-compensating or over-rebating Dongbu,
which provides Dongbu with a countervailable benefit.
<P>
Comment 12: POSCO’s donation to POSTECH
Petitioners state that POSCO received another countervailable tax subsidy, which the
Department must countervail in the final determination. This subsidy, which petitioners state
that the Department discovered at verification, is a tax benefit in the form of a tax deduction for a
donation that POSCO made to POSTECH, a university affiliated with the company. Petitioners
state that although the benefits associated with charitable contributions are not generally
considered countervailable, the self-dealing nature of this transaction demonstrates that it is
countervailable. Petitioners maintain that in exchange for its donation, POSCO received a stock
buy-back and an interest in future royalty payments. Petitioners argue that this benefit is specific
because the record holds no evidence of similar companies receiving tax benefits for their stock
buy-backs or royalty purchases. Petitioners state that the Department should apply POSCO’s
nominal tax rate to the donation in order to calculate the benefit of POSCO’s tax savings.
<P>
Respondents disagree with petitioners contention that POSCO’s donation to POSTECH
was extraordinary self-dealing and is therefore countervailable. Respondents discuss the facts of
this issue. First, respondents argue that POSCO made a donation of cash to POSTECH.
POSTECH used part of this donation to purchase POSCO stock. Both parties (POSCO and
POSTECH) agreed that as a result of the donation, POSCO would receive certain rights to
royalties if POSTECH invested salable items as a result of the donation. Second, respondents
point to POSCO’s Board of Directors Meeting where the approval of the donation makes it clear
that POSCO considered the donation as both a contribution to the development of the national
economy and the research capabilities of a leading university, as well as an investment that could
have future payoffs. Respondents disagree with petitioners’ allegation that this action provided a
subsidy. Respondents argue that as the donation was cash, there was no condition applied that
POSTECH must purchase POSCO’s stock, and, therefore, there was no stock buyback subsidy.
<P>
Moreover, respondents note that it makes good financial sense that POSTECH would invest part
of the large sum it received in one of the most attractive and low-risk stocks in Korea to form
part of its endowment. Respondents also dispute petitioners’ assumption that any royalty
payments to POSCO would not be taxable. As royalties are income and taxable like any other
form of income, there is no basis for such a conclusion. Therefore, respondents urge the
Department to dismiss petitioners’ subsidy allegation and find this not countervailable.
<P>
Department’s Position:
<P>
The Department disagrees with petitioners that this program provides a countervailable
subsidy. There is no evidence on the record to show that charitable donations are specific under
the Act. Charitable donations are a standard deduction available to all persons in Korea.
Therefore, we find that this program does not provide a countervailable subsidy. In addition,
regardless of whether POSCO made this donation to POSTECH, used these funds to conduct its
own research and development, or used these funds for other capital investments, each of these
activities produce expenditures which are equally used to offset taxable income.
<P>
V. Recommendation:
<P>
Based on our analysis of the comments received, we recommend adopting all of the
above positions. If these recommendations are accepted, we will publish the final results of the
determination in the Federal Register.
