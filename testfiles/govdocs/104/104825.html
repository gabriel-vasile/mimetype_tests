<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>		The Board, on reconsideration, establishes the purchase price of the Norman
Branch line between Gurdon and Birds Mill, AR, under the feeder line provisions
of 49 U.S.C. 10907 at its net liquidation value.  In addition, the Board sets
compensation for trackage rights over part of the Norman Branch, and it awards
damages to compensate two shippers for an unlawful embargo of rail service on
portions of the line.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	BY THE BOARD:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Three proceedings before us involve the Arkansas Midland Railroad Company's (AMR)
approximately 52-mile Norman Branch line between Gurdon and Birds Mill, AR.  Our decision
in Finance Docket No. 32479 served August 12, 1999 (the August 1999 Decision), approving the
feeder line application for sale of the entire Norman Branch under 49 U.S.C. 10907,<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a> and setting
a price and other terms of sale for the purchase, set out in detail the background of the three
proceedings: the feeder line case (Finance Docket No. 32479), the trackage rights compensation
case (Finance Docket No. 32625), and the damages case (Docket No. 41230).<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a>  For
administrative convenience and to avoid unnecessary delay, we will consolidate the three
proceedings, rule on the petition for administrative reconsideration of the purchase price set in
the August 1999 Decision in Finance Docket No. 32479, set trackage rights compensation in
Finance Docket No. 32625, and award damages in Docket No. 41230.    

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center">PERTINENT BACKGROUND

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	AMR, a subsidiary of Pinsly Railroad Company, Inc. (Pinsly), acquired the Norman
Branch line from what is now the Union Pacific Railroad Company (UP) in 1992.<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a>  The principal
shipper on the line, International Paper Co. (IP), is located approximately 3 miles from Gurdon,
where the line connects at the southern end with UP's main line. The line also serves GS Roofing
Products Company, Inc. (GS Roofing), Beazer West, Inc. d/b/a Gifford-Hill &amp; Company
(Gifford-Hill), Bean Lumber Company and Curt Bean Lumber Company (Bean), and Barksdale
Lumber Company (Barksdale) (collectively, the Shippers).  The Shippers are located on the
northern part of the line extending to Birds Mill.<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	On December 3, 1993, a storm caused flooding, washouts, and landslides on the Norman
Branch.  On December 15, 1993, AMR notified the affected shippers and the Association of
American Railroads that the resulting track conditions required it to embargo service to four
stations located at or near the northern end of the line, thereby interrupting service to GS Roofing
and Bean.  On February 22, 1994, AMR amended the embargo to include an additional station to
the south of the initially embargoed stations due to track and bridge conditions, interrupting
service to Gifford-Hill.  However, AMR continued to serve IP on the southern portion of the line,
which was apparently not affected by the flooding.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	On February 18, 1994, AMR initiated the abandonment process, at first indicating its
intent to abandon the entire line, and ultimately indicating its intent to abandon the Norman
Branch except for the portion serving IP.  These events led to the initiation of three different
actions at the ICC.  First, the Caddo Antoine and Little Missouri Railroad Company (CALM), a
noncarrier subsidiary of the Dardanelle &amp; Russell Railroad Company (DRRC), filed a feeder line
application under former 49 U.S.C. 10910 (now 49 U.S.C. 10907) and 49 CFR part 1151 to
acquire the entire Norman Branch (including the three miles necessary to serve IP).  Second, on
March 18, 1994, as supplemented on March 22, 1994, DRRC and CALM requested that the ICC
issue a directed service order pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 11125<a href="#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a> that would allow DRRC/CALM to
begin immediate operations over the entire Norman Branch.  Finally, on March 21, 1994, the
Shippers filed a complaint in Docket No. 41230 seeking damages from AMR and Pinsly.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	The complaint alleged that AMR's cessation of service from December 1993 until April
1994 over portions of the line violated the railroad's obligation under former 49 U.S.C. 11101(a)
to provide transportation or service upon reasonable request.  In a decision issued March 11,
1997, we concluded that AMR and Pinsly were not liable for damages because AMR's initial
determination to suspend service over washed out track was not unreasonable, and AMR acted
reasonably in not repairing the line immediately.  On judicial review, the court agreed with our
finding that AMR acted reasonably in initially embargoing the storm-damaged line, but
concluded that AMR should have repaired the track as soon as possible even though AMR made
a determination shortly after instituting the embargo to abandon or otherwise dispose of it.  The
court remanded the damages proceeding for the Board to determine damages.  <u>GS Roofing
Products Company, et al. v. STB</u>, 143 F.3d 387 (8th Cir. 1998) (<u>GS Roofing</u>).<a href="#N_7_"><sup>(7)</sup></a> 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	On March 28, 1994, shortly after the feeder line application was filed, the ICC denied the
request for directed service under section 11125 because it concluded that the statutory criteria
had not been met.  The carrier had not been shown to lack funds to provide service, had not been
ordered to discontinue operations by a court, and had not "discontinued transportation without
obtaining [an abandonment] certificate."  49 U.S.C. 11125(a)(3).  Pursuant to 49 U.S.C.
11123(a), however, the ICC in Service Order No. 1516<a href="#N_8_"><sup>(8)</sup></a> authorized DRRC/CALM to provide
voluntary interim service over the northern portion of the Norman Branch, including the portion
affected by the embargo, based on its willingness to do so, and AMR's agreement to permit it to
do so.  The ICC also authorized DRRC/CALM to enter into an agreement with AMR to operate
"overhead"<a href="#N_9_"><sup>(9)</sup></a> trackage rights over the rest of the line on which AMR continued to serve IP so that
DRRC/CALM could interchange directly with UP.<a href="#N_10_"><sup>(10)</sup></a>  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	DRRC/CALM began operations in early April 1994, pursuant to the ICC service order. 
DRRC/CALM's service continued until August 10, 1996, when it ceased operations.<a href="#N_11_"><sup>(11)</sup></a>  At the
request of the Shippers, and with the consent of all parties, including AMR, we amended Service
Order No. 1516 and substituted the East Texas Central Railroad Company (ETC) as the
authorized operator in September 1996.<a href="#N_12_"><sup>(12)</sup></a> 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	During the course of the ICC's feeder line proceeding, AMR entered into a lease and
option to purchase agreement with Glenwood &amp; Southern Railroad Company (GSR) for the
northern portion of the line.  However, the ICC subsequently disallowed GSR's lease of the line. 
GSR then filed a competing feeder line application, which was denied on the ground that GSR
had not shown that it was financially responsible, as required by former 49 U.S.C. 10910(a).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	In the feeder line proceeding, the ICC, by decision served on April 18, 1995, granted the
feeder line application only for the 49-mile northern portion of the line that AMR had sought to
abandon.<a href="#N_13_"><sup>(13)</sup></a>  The ICC determined that the southernmost three-mile portion on which AMR
continued to serve IP was not eligible for sale under the public convenience and necessity
(PC&amp;N) requirements in former section 10910(b)(1)(A)(i).  CALM declined to acquire the
northern portion of the line.  Rather, CALM and the Shippers filed a petition for judicial review
of the ICC's feeder line decision.<a href="#N_14_"><sup>(14)</sup></a>  In 1996, the court, in <u>Caddo Antoine and Little Missouri R.
Co. v. STB</u>, 95 F.3d 740 (8th Cir. 1996) (<u>Caddo Antoine</u>), reversed the ICC's feeder line
decision in <u>Caddo</u> and remanded the proceeding for the Board to consider CALM's application
to purchase the entire Norman Branch under the PC&amp;N standards now in section 10907(c)(1). 
The court noted that the Norman Branch had been historically operated as a single unit and, for
this reason, it disagreed with the ICC's determination that the line could be segmented.  The
court directed that we consider the Norman Branch as a single line and determine whether the
PC&amp;N requires or permits sale of the entire Norman Branch under the feeder line statute, 49
U.S.C. 10907(c)(1), and, if so, what the sale price for the entire line should be.  Following the
court's remand, we reopened the feeder line proceeding and directed the filing of additional
evidence and more current valuation estimates.<a href="#N_15_"><sup>(15)</sup></a>  <u>See</u> August 1999 Decision at 5-7.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	As noted earlier, in 1998, the Eighth Circuit in <u>GS Roofing</u> reversed our decision in the
damages case and denied our petition for rehearing.  Following the court's denial of rehearing,
we directed the parties to work with an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) to attempt to reach a
negotiated resolution of the pending feeder line, compensation, and damages proceedings. 
Several discussions were held.  However, in a letter dated January 13, 1999, the Shippers advised
the Board that the mediation process had reached an impasse and requested that the Board decide
the three pending cases.   

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	In our August 1999 Decision, we granted the feeder line application for sale of the entire
Norman Branch and set the purchase price.  The feeder line procedures require us to determine
the purchase price at the constitutional minimum value of the line, which is defined as "not less
than the net liquidation value of such line or the going concern value of such line, whichever is
greater."  49 U.S.C. 10907(b).  We based our purchase price ($1,628,727) on a combination of
net liquidation value (NLV) of $901,834 for the northern portion and a going concern value
(GCV) of $726,893 for the southern portion.  We noted that the evidence before us showed that,
while the entire line has an NLV, the parties had not submitted any acceptable GCV for the entire
Norman Branch.  Nonetheless, we determined that, because AMR served IP on the southernmost
portion of the line at a profit, it would be appropriate in setting the constitutionally required
minimum value for this line to add the GCV of the southern portion of the line on which AMR
serves IP to the NLV of the remaining portion of the line. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	To calculate the GCV for the southern portion, we used data furnished by the Shippers
and AMR in their supplemental filings that reflected AMR's operations over the southern portion
for the year 1996.  That data showed that in 1996, AMR realized revenues of $425,660<a href="#N_16_"><sup>(16)</sup></a> and
incurred variable costs of $297,000.<a href="#N_17_"><sup>(17)</sup></a>  Applying a multiplier of 17.7% based on the 1996 pretax
cost of capital rate for the railroad industry,<a href="#N_18_"><sup>(18)</sup></a> we computed the GCV of the southern portion at
$726,893.  Our GCV estimate did not include costs associated with rehabilitating the 3-mile
southern portion of the line and did not include fixed costs.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center">DISCUSSION

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>I.  <u>THE PETITION FOR RECONSIDERATION IN THE FEEDER LINE CASE.</u>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	A.  <u>Arguments of the Parties</u>.  AMR has filed a petition for reconsideration of our
$1,628,727 purchase price.  It claims that we understated our determination of the constitutional
minimum value of the Norman Branch because the $726,893 GCV we computed for the southern
portion failed to include all revenues generated on that portion of the line.  AMR argues that
neither it nor the Shippers relied on or provided any break-out details for the 1996 evidence we
relied on in calculating the GCV for the southern portion.<a href="#N_19_"><sup>(19)</sup></a>  AMR contends that, because the
Board rejected each of the parties' case-in-chief and constructed a GCV for the southern segment
based on less than complete evidence, we should now adjust the GCV to include evidence of
additional revenue not included in the parties' prior evidence.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Specifically, AMR states that the $425,660 in revenues, which we used to compute the
GCV for the southern portion, represented only line-haul revenue that it realized for handling
IP's carload traffic in 1996.  AMR submitted a verified statement from James J. Plasse,
Controller of Pinsly, AMR's parent, stating that AMR also realized $124,000 in car-hire income
that was derived from using 30 60-foot leased boxcars for outbound movements of plywood from
IP's facility.<a href="#N_20_"><sup>(20)</sup></a>  AMR's witness states further that AMR realized $17,822 in trackage rights fees
from the operator of the northern part of the Norman Branch under Service Order No. 1516 and
$44,459 in other revenue, including switching, demurrage, storage, car repair and miscellaneous
income ("other revenue").<a href="#N_21_"><sup>(21)</sup></a>  According to AMR's witness, GCV should be based on the total
revenue realized by AMR on the southern portion in 1996, which, he submits, was $611,941.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	AMR's witness also provided the following breakdown of the costs AMR allegedly
incurred in 1996 from operating the southern portion:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The total cost figure was rounded up $297,000.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Mr. Plasse states that train crew and locomotive expenses are based on actual experience
from operating the southern portion.  Train crew expenses are derived from a two-person crew,
each with a 1996 salary of $21,000 and a 1.6 benefit factor.  Assertedly, maintenance of way
expenses and property taxes were apportioned from AMR's system totals, using a ratio of the
southern portion to total AMR operating miles for maintenance of way expense.  Property taxes
were based on a ratio of the southern portion to total AMR owned miles for property taxes.  Car
lease costs were allegedly based on AMR's monthly lease rate for the 30 boxcars, $12,900,
which results in an annualized cost of $154,800.  Based on Mr. Plasse's verified statement, AMR
asks that we recalculate the GCV of the southern portion of the line to be either $1,779,328 or
$1,605,542, which would result in a total value for the line of $2,681,162 or $2,507,376.<a href="#N_22_"><sup>(22)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	In reply, the Shippers agree that the determination of GCV in our August 1999 Decision
for the southern portion is erroneous (albeit for very different reasons), and that reconsideration
of the purchase price we set is in order.  The Shippers contend that our attempt to use a
combination of NLV and GCV to determine the value of the entire line is contrary to the feeder
line statute and the court's decision in <u>Caddo Antoine</u>.  The Shippers argue that the entire line
should be valued at its NLV.  The Shippers further contend that we made significant errors in
calculating the GCV for the southern portion, because, in their view, we relied on unsupported,
undocumented, and unverifiable cost and revenue evidence and failed to include all costs. 
Moreover, the Shippers note that in the earlier phases of this proceeding, AMR refused to
provide financial data for the Norman Branch, claiming that its accounting records did not cover
revenues and costs for specific branches.  They object to the additional financial evidence
belatedly submitted by AMR with its petition for reconsideration. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	The Shippers have submitted a verified statement by Mr. Plaistow and Ms. Adams
analyzing AMR's additional data.  The Shippers' witnesses contend that the cost estimates used
to compute the GCV were incomplete and failed to include any general and administrative costs,
marketing costs, depreciation, and amortization costs that AMR incurred in 1996 from operating
the southern portion.  The Shippers' witnesses also question whether AMR included all the car
costs associated with moving IP traffic.  They note that AMR's witness indicated that  IP moved
2,867 carloads in 1996, and that IP allegedly moved 405 carloads in leased boxcars for which
AMR incurred $154,800 in car lease costs.  They assert that the record fails to explain what, if
any, additional car cost was incurred for the movement of the remaining 2,262 carloads of IP
traffic and that these costs could be significant.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Furthermore, the Shippers' witnesses compare 1993 data for AMR operations over the
southern portion with data reflecting operations in 1996.  Mr. Plaistow and Ms. Adams are
concerned that the data show that transportation expenses for operating the southern portion
declined from $127,789 in 1993 to $67,000 in 1996, even though carloads increased from 2,676
to 2,867.  Mr. Plaistow and Ms. Adams add that the only personnel expenses shown are for two
crew members ($67,000), and that AMR's costs did not include a train dispatcher.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	B.  <u>Our Analysis</u>.  The only issue we are asked to address in the feeder line case is the
question of the constitutional minimum value of the Norman Branch.<a href="#N_23_"><sup>(23)</sup></a>  To allow us to do so, we
will accept the supplemental evidence submitted by AMR and the Shippers.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	As noted above, the feeder line provisions define constitutional minimum value as not
"less than the net liquidation value of such line or the going concern value of such line,
whichever is greater."  49 U.S.C. 10907(b)(2).  For the reasons stated in the August 1999
Decision, AMR normally would be entitled to the GCV for the portion of the line on which it is
actively serving IP to compensate for the loss of IP's traffic.  Thus, based on the evidence of
record at that time, the Board determined the GCV for that portion.  However, the parties'
supplemental evidence raises questions of accuracy with respect to the previous record, and thus
we are persuaded that the record now simply does not contain the information we need to
compute a GCV for the southern portion of the line with any degree of accuracy.  Moreover,
upon reconsideration, it is not clear that a computation of GCV for the southern portion is
permissible in this case in light of the Eighth Circuit's holding in <u>Caddo Antoine</u> that, for sale
purposes, the Norman Branch must be treated as a single entity.  Inasmuch as the parties have not
provided any acceptable evidence as to GCV for the entire Norman Branch, the only meaningful
evidence in the record of the constitutional minimum value for the line is the NLV for the entire
Norman Branch.  Accordingly, we will value the entire line at its NLV ($961,096.24).<a href="#N_24_"><sup>(24)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	In its petition for reconsideration, AMR argues that the 1996 revenue data we used in
calculating the GCV for the southern portion were too low.  AMR points out that the same
revenue estimate that it asks the Board to accept on reconsideration ($612,000) was included in
the estimates provided by AMR witness Bowers in his statement filed June 27, 1997.  While we
rejected Mr. Bowers' revenue estimate in the August 1999 Decision because it was not
supported, AMR has now provided more specific details.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	But even with AMR's additional data, it still is not possible to develop a meaningful
GCV for the southern portion of the line.  To begin with, the $44,459 in revenues from other
sources in AMR's petition for reconsideration is simply an allocation<a href="#N_25_"><sup>(25)</sup></a> of all other revenues from
other sources, including switching, demurrage, storage and car repair revenues.  Moreover, the
Shippers have raised significant questions regarding AMR's failure to provide full information
about the costs it incurred to operate the southern portion of the line.  As the Shippers point out,
Mr. Plasse's breakdown in the table reproduced above of AMR's alleged $297,000 in costs
contains no costs at all for the generation of the $44,459 in alleged additional revenues.  AMR
also fails to include information on the costs associated with the additional $17,822 in trackage
rights revenues under Service Order No. 1516, which AMR now claims should be included.<a href="#N_26_"><sup>(26)</sup></a> 
With the exception of the data on car-hire income (where AMR provided car lease costs), we
could not include AMR's additional revenues without also including the costs associated with the
generation of those revenues.  AMR did not provide these additional costs, however, and there is
insufficient detail in the record to allow a restatement. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Additionally, the Shippers make a persuasive argument that AMR's data regarding car
costs AMR allegedly incurred to handle IP traffic is incomplete.  IP moved 2,867 carloads in
1996.  AMR's witness Plasse indicates IP moved 405 carloads in the leased boxcars for which
AMR claims $154,800 in car lease costs.  However, there is no evidence in the record to explain
what, if any, additional car cost was incurred for the movement of the remaining 2,262 carloads
of IP traffic.<a href="#N_27_"><sup>(27)</sup></a>  The costs associated with the movement of 2,262 carloads could be significant.<a href="#N_28_"><sup>(28)</sup></a>   

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	The Shippers have pointed to other problems with the cost and revenue evidence we used
to compute a GCV in our prior decision.  For example, Mr.  Plaistow and Ms. Adams explain
that, under AMR's calculations, transportation expenses for the southern segment declined,
without explanation, between 1993 and 1996, from almost $128,000 to $67,000, despite the fact
that carloads increased from 2,676 to 2,867.  Mr.  Plaistow and Ms. Adams note that the only
personnel expenses shown are for two crew members ($67,000) with no other personnel
expenses indicated.  However, crew members do not typically operate without a train dispatcher. 
Further, the Shippers' witnesses show that 1996 Uniform Rail Costing System data for the
Western Region provide variable costs of $224.36 per carload, or $643,240 for 2,867 carloads,
which is substantially higher than the cost we included in calculating GCV for the southern
segment in our August 1999 Decision.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Finally, Mr. Plaistow and Ms. Adams contend that there is no supporting documentation
for why 17% of AMR's total revenues are from the southern portion of the Norman Branch. 
They question why revenue per car for IP traffic rose 61% between 1993 and 1996, while
revenue per car for all other AMR traffic rose only 21%.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Thus, after fully considering the parties' supplemental evidence, we must conclude that
there is not enough evidence in the record to allow us to compute a meaningful GCV for the
southern portion of the line.  We do not necessarily agree with all of the arguments raised by the
Shippers and their witnesses, but upon reconsideration it is clear that not all costs and revenues
were properly accounted for in our attempt to develop a GCV in the August 1999 Decision. 
Thus, it would be inappropriate to use the GCV in our prior decision in setting the constitutional
minimum value of this line.  On reconsideration, the parties also have not given us the evidence
we would need to restate the GCV for the southern portion of the line with any degree of
accuracy.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	AMR did provide us with 1996 data to support a GCV for the entire line ranging from
$3,674,000 to $3,137,000 when we reopened the feeder line proceeding in 1997.<a href="#N_29_"><sup>(29)</sup></a>  That GCV
evidence, however, was previously considered and properly rejected.  As we noted in the August
1999 Decision, AMR's estimates were based on ETC's projected revenues and costs for the years
1997 through 1999.  We rejected AMR's calculations because the relevant GCV here is what the
line is worth to AMR as a going concern, not its projected value to the acquiring company.  <u>See</u>
<u>United States v. Miller</u>, 317 U.S. 369, 375 (1942).  Therefore, ETC's projections are essentially
irrelevant in the overall determination of GCV or value of the entire Norman Branch.

<p>	

<p>	In their recently filed verified statement, Mr. Plaistow and Ms. Adams estimate a GCV
for the entire line based on interim operations of DRRC/CALM and ETC over the northern
portion and AMR operating over the southern portion of the Norman Branch in 1996.  However,
AMR did not operate the entire Norman Branch in 1996, and financial data for the interim
operators are irrelevant to determining the value of the line to AMR as a going concern.  Thus,
the parties plainly have not provided any acceptable evidence from which we can compute a
meaningful GCV for the entire line.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><u></u>	In short, the only reliable and verifiable record evidence for the constitutional minimum
value of this line is the NLV for the entire Norman Branch.  The parties have had ample
opportunity to provide evidence on GCV.  Our May 1997 decision in the feeder line case
requested the parties to update the record for determining GCV and NLV, and the parties filed
GCV evidence in response to that decision and following issuance of our August 1999 Decision.  
As discussed above, however, the GCV evidence we have before us is incomplete and
unverifiable.  In the absence of acceptable GCV evidence, or sufficient data to allow us to
compute a meaningful GCV, we will set the constitutional minimum value for the entire Norman
Branch at its NLV, which is $961,096.24.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Finally, it should be noted that, in the August 1999 Decision, in finding that the forced
sale of the Norman Branch would not have a significant adverse financial impact on AMR as
required by 49 U.S.C. 10907(c)(1)(C), we relied in part on the fact that the compensation AMR
would receive from the sale of the line (including the GCV for the southern portion) would
neutralize any adverse financial impact from the loss of IP's traffic.  Therefore, our decision here
that the only way to value the Norman Branch based on the evidence before us is at NLV
requires that we reassess whether this line is eligible for sale under the PC&amp;N standards.  We
conclude that the PC&amp;N standards have been met in this case.  As we stated in the August 1999
Decision, in the event of the sale of the entire Norman Branch, AMR would avoid the cost of
rehabilitating the approximately 49-mile northern portion of the line.  Since the northern portion
of the line is in very poor shape, the cost of rehabilitation would substantially reduce, if not wipe
out, AMR's profits from serving IP on the southern portion of the line.  AMR would therefore
realize substantial cost savings from elimination of the northern portion of the line, which would
have a positive impact on its overall bottom line.  In addition, if the northern portion of the line
were not rehabilitated, we presume that it would continue to be operated at a loss.  Finally,
AMR's own witness provided evidence that, without the Norman Branch, AMR will continue to
generate annual anticipated profits in excess of $250,000 from its operations over the remaining
52.63 miles of track in its system.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	In sum, AMR will lose the compensation it presently receives from IP if the line is sold. 
However, it also will avoid the costs associated with operating over the southern portion of the
line.  Even though AMR would realize less compensation than we previously determined
($1,628,727), it will still realize cash proceeds from the sale of the line that it can invest in its
other lines.<a href="#N_30_"><sup>(30)</sup></a>  Given the compensation that AMR would receive from the sale and AMR's
operations over the rest of its system, the loss of this income will not cripple AMR financially or
operationally, and thus the PC&amp;N standards are met with the entire line valued at NLV.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>II.  <u>THE TRACKAGE RIGHTS COMPENSATION CASE.</u>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	A.  <u>The Prior Decisions</u>.  As noted above, by decision served March 28, 1994, in Service
Order No. 1516, DRRC/CALM was authorized to provide service on the Norman Branch under
an emergency service order issued pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 11323.  The service order permitted
DRRC/CALM to provide interim service over the approximately 49-mile northern portion of the
Norman Branch between Birds Mill and Gurdon, and to operate overhead trackage rights over
the approximately 3-mile southernmost portion of the line to allow DRRC/CALM to connect
with UP in Gurdon.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	As a condition to Service Order No. 1516, the ICC required DRRC/CALM to compensate
AMR for the overhead trackage rights at a "commercially reasonable rate."  The parties,
however, were unable to agree on that rate.  AMR sought payment of $7.00 per car. 
DRRC/CALM contended that the rate should be no more than $3.72 per car.  The ICC gave
DRRC/CALM two options:  (1) on an interim basis, it could pay AMR trackage rights
compensation of $7 per car for the period June 1 to November 30, 1994; or (2) as an alternative,
DRRC/CALM could pay AMR trackage rights compensation of $3.72 per car, if it
simultaneously filed a petition requesting the ICC to determine the appropriate compensation.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	DRRC/CALM chose the second option, and in a decision served June 22, 1995
(<u>Compensation 1</u>), the ICC determined the formula it would use in setting the compensation,<a href="#N_31_"><sup>(31)</sup></a>
and directed AMR and DRRC/CALM to submit evidence to determine the overhead trackage
rights compensation under that formula.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	In <u>Compensation 2</u>, we set compensation, based on the parties' submissions, at $9.75 per
car for cars moved during the May 1994 through August 1995 period.  DRRC/CALM filed an
administrative appeal of that decision, which we denied in a decision served September 5, 1996
(<u>Compensation 3</u>), on grounds that DRRC/CALM had failed to submit cost evidence that would
justify a compensation rate other than the one we had set.  DRRC/CALM filed a petition for
review of <u>Compensation 3</u> in <u>Caddo Antoine and Little Missouri R. Co. v. STB</u>, No. 96-3352
(8th Cir. Sept. 9, 1996), but action on the appeal has been held in abeyance pending our
consideration of DRRC/CALM's supplement to its administrative appeal that was filed
August&nbsp;29, 1996, and thus was not considered in our decision denying reconsideration.  That
decision, although served September 5th, had been decided August 28th, the day before the
supplement was filed.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Ten days after the issuance of our September 5, 1996 decision in the compensation case,
the Eighth Circuit issued its decision in <u>Caddo Antoine</u>, reversing the ICC's feeder line decision
and remanding the feeder line proceeding with instructions to consider the entire Norman Branch
as a single line.  Shortly thereafter, in a decision served December 23, 1996, we reopened the
compensation proceeding and stayed the effective date of the <u>Compensation 2</u> and <u>
Compensation 3</u> decisions until the related feeder line case was resolved.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	B.  <u>Our Analysis</u>.  We are now concluding the compensation case and will vacate the stay
previously entered in this proceeding.  We direct DRRC/CALM to compensate AMR for
trackage rights over the 3.13-mile southernmost portion of the line under Service Order No. 1516
in accordance with our prior decisions in this proceeding, with the following modifications.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	First, we continue to believe we should use the methodology set out in our prior decisions
to set compensation, i.e., the method usually employed to determine a tenant's payment for
trackage rights.  However, the outcome of applying that methodology ($9.75 per car) results in a
compensation rate that is significantly higher than the amount AMR sought in this case ($7 per
car).  Upon reconsideration, we now conclude it would be inappropriate to award AMR a
compensation rate that is higher than AMR's own numbers.  Accordingly, we conclude that $7
per car is a reasonable trackage rights compensation level here.<a href="#N_32_"><sup>(32)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Second, we are modifying <u>Compensation 2</u> to make it apply to the period that
commenced on June 1, not May 1, 1994, and extended through August 1995.  As pointed out by
DRRC/CALM, the May date in <u>Compensation 2</u> was incorrect because the ICC previously had
determined that compensation would begin on June 1, 1994.  <u>See</u> Supplemental Order No. 1 to
Service Order No. 1516 (ICC served Apr. 26, 1994).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	As a result of this modification, we will exclude the 332 carloads that moved over the
3.13-mile southern portion in May 1994.  <u>See</u> AMR Supplemental Evidence filed October 10,
1995.  Thus, we now find that DRRC/CALM moved 4,488 cars from June 1994 through August
1995, which, at $7.00 per car, yields a total compensation of $31,416 for that period.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Furthermore, we want to make it clear that compensation for any additional trackage
rights operations performed by DRRC/CALM, and subsequently by ETC, over the 3.13-mile
southern portion can be sought, based on the same rate of $7 per car.<a href="#N_33_"><sup>(33)</sup></a>  The total amount of
compensation due AMR also should be reduced by any payments by DRRC/CALM and/or ETC
under Service Order No. 1516.

<p>	

<p>	C.  <u>Interest</u>.  Finally, to the extent that DRRC/CALM and/or ETC have paid AMR less
than the rate of $7 per car for trackage rights operations over the 3.13-mile southern portion of
the line, it is appropriate that interest (based on the difference between $7 per car and the amount
already paid) should accrue from the date of the interim operations until the date of payment by
DRRC/CALM and/or ETC to AMR of the compensation found due in this decision.<a href="#N_34_"><sup>(34)</sup></a>  Interest
will be based on the 91-day Treasury Bill Equivalent yield for the quarter during which each
payment was made.  The 91-day Treasury Bill Equivalent yield is published by the U.S.
Department of the Treasury in the Treasury Bulletin.  Interest shall be calculated pursuant to the
procedures outline at 49 CFR 1141.1(a)(2) and 1141.1(b)(2).  AMR shall calculate the interest
due and provide DRRC/CALM and/or ETC with its calculations within 15 days from the service
date of this decision.  Within 30 days after the effective date of this decision, DRRC/CALM
and/or ETC shall remit to AMR payment of the trackage rights compensation and interest as set
forth in this decision.

<p>	

<p>III.  <u>THE DAMAGES PROCEEDING.</u>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	As discussed above, the Shippers' complaint in Docket No. 41230 alleged that AMR's
cessation of service from December 1993 until March 1994 over portions of the line violated the
railroad's common carrier obligation under former 49 U.S.C. 11101(a) to provide transportation
or service upon reasonable request.  In a decision issued March 11, 1997, we found that AMR
and Pinsly (hereafter defendants or the railroads) were not liable for damages to the Shippers
because AMR's initial determination to suspend service over washed out track was not
unreasonable, and AMR acted reasonably in not repairing the line immediately.<a href="#N_35_"><sup>(35)</sup></a>  On judicial
review in <u>GS Roofing</u>, the court agreed with our finding that AMR acted reasonably in initially
embargoing the line following the December 3, 1993 storm, but concluded that AMR should
have repaired the track as soon as possible even though AMR made a determination shortly after
instituting the embargo to abandon or otherwise dispose of it.  The court remanded the
proceeding for the Board to determine damages.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	A.  <u>Preliminary Matters</u>.  We will make our determination of damages based on the
original record evidence that was filed in the damages proceeding.<a href="#N_36_"><sup>(36)</sup></a>  The Shippers state that they
seek damages for the period from December 15, 1993 -- the date on which AMR notified the
affected shippers and the Association of American Railroads that storm-related track conditions
required it to embargo service to four stations, thereby interrupting service to GS Roofing and
Bean<a href="#N_37_"><sup>(37)</sup></a> -- until April 15, 1994, the date on which service to the Shippers was restored under the
DRRC/CALM service order.  The court, however, found AMR liable for damages sustained
"during the period starting on the date on which the line should have been restored to service
following the imposition of the embargo and ending on the date service was actually restored." 
<u>GS Roofing</u>, 143 F.3d at 394.  We will set the date by which service should have been restored
following the imposition of the embargo as December 24, 1993.  This date is three weeks after
the storm that caused the damage, which was sufficient time for AMR to have made the repairs
that DRRC/CALM made to restart operations.<a href="#N_38_"><sup>(38)</sup></a>  We agree with the Shippers that it is appropriate
to end the period for which damages are to be assessed on April 15, 1994, the date that service to
the Shippers actually was restored under the ICC's service order.<a href="#N_39_"><sup>(39)</sup></a>  Therefore, we will award
damages, as assessed below, only for this period.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	B.  <u>The Parties' Arguments</u>.  The Shippers seek damages for lost profits, the cost of
alternative transportation, and costs associated with their efforts to prevent further damages by
substituting DRRC/CALM for AMR.<a href="#N_40_"><sup>(40)</sup></a>  Specifically, the Shippers allege lost profits for GS
Roofing of $240,975 for its inability to ship 22,500 tons of roofing granules to a customer in
Houston, TX,<a href="#N_41_"><sup>(41)</sup></a> and of $7,596 for delayed shipments of stone dust to Fontana, CA.<a href="#N_42_"><sup>(42)</sup></a>  According
to the Shippers, GS Roofing spent $33,524.02 on a temporary transloading facility.<a href="#N_43_"><sup>(43)</sup></a>  In addition,
GS Roofing allegedly suffered $33,337.88 and $4,455 in freight rate differentials,<a href="#N_44_"><sup>(44)</sup></a> $46,897.50
in professional fees and $3,563.15 in related expenses.<a href="#N_45_"><sup>(45)</sup></a>  Allegedly, Gifford-Hill experienced lost

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	In reply, defendants maintain that the Shippers failed to substantiate their damage claims. 
The Shippers on rebuttal then replied to defendants' arguments.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	C.  <u>Our Analysis</u>.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	1.  <u>Lost Profits and Sales</u>.  The Shippers contend they should be compensated for lost
business profits.  However, the Shippers plainly have not carried their burden of proof
concerning the amount of lost profits because the documentation for their lost profit claims is too
speculative and remote to be persuasive.

<p>   

<p>	As defendants state, the ICC consistently rejected awarding damages based on estimates
of lost profits.  <u>See</u>, <u>e.g.</u>, <u>Webb Coal v. New York Central R. Co.</u>, 278 I.C.C. 5, 15 (1950)
(<u>Webb</u>); <u>Crosby v. St. L.-F. Ry. Co.</u>, 112 I.C.C. 239, 243 (1926) (<u>Crosby</u>).  <u>Louisiana Railcar,
Inc. v. Missouri Pacific Railroad Co.</u>, 5 I.C.C.2d 542, 549 (1989) (<u>Louisiana Railcar</u>), where a
request for payment for lost profits was granted, is distinguishable.  In that case, the record
showed that the complainant, Louisiana Railcar, Inc. (LRC), could not conduct any regular
operations without rail service.  LRC's operations were limited to repairing railcars and,
therefore, it could not provide any of its services without a rail link.  In contrast, the record in this
proceeding demonstrates that the shipments at issue here could have been moved by truck or by
intermodal operations.<a href="#N_52_"><sup>(52)</sup></a>  Moreover, none of the Shippers closed their facilities during the
embargo due to the lack of rail service.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	The Shippers state that they incurred difficulty obtaining motor carrier transportation,
even to the interim loading facility,<a href="#N_53_"><sup>(53)</sup></a> which may have affected profits.  But unlike the situation
presented in <u>Louisiana Railcar</u>, these difficulties were only an indirect result of the embargo, as
motor carrier transportation was attainable.  Moreover, in <u>Louisiana Railcar</u>, the ICC noted in
awarding damages based on lost profits that in that case the claims were tied to past profits, and
it saw "no reason to believe that the 4-year average of past profits [did] not reasonably reflect the
business LRC could have anticipated if [the railroad] had met its common carrier obligations." 
<u>Louisiana Railcar</u>, 5 I.C.C.2d at 549.  Here, however, there is no evidence on which we can
independently verify the alleged amount of lost profits or determine whether the alleged lost
profits were actually lost or only delayed. 

<p> 

<p>	More specifically, the evidence comparing the Shippers' performance before and during
the embargoes is not well documented.  For example, in regard to the alleged lost profits of the
largest affected shipper, GS Roofing, the record is not clear as to whether G.S. Roofing's
negotiations to sell roofing granules ripened into a contract before the imposition of the first
embargo and thus whether rail service was needed at the time of the embargo.  G.S. Roofing also
noted that "winter is [its] lowest volume season,"<a href="#N_54_"><sup>(54)</sup></a> which is the season during which the
embargo was in effect.  Moreover, there is evidence in the record that G.S. Roofing moved as
much as 25% of its shipments by truck and did not even use rail service during the time of the
year that the embargo was in effect.  With respect to G.S. Roofing's alleged inability to ship
stone dust to a customer in Fontana, it should be noted that G.S. Roofing itself stated that [its]
unique stone dust sales were delayed 18 weeks, not lost.  These shipments began only after the
customer "had [depleted] its inventory . . ." (which occurred in May, well after DRRC/CALM
began operating).<a href="#N_55_"><sup>(55)</sup></a>  Thus, there is no reliable evidence from which to conclude that GS Roofing
profits were lost because of the embargo, or even if they were, at what levels they were lost.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	As for Gifford-Hill, AMR presented evidence that Gifford-Hill's sales projections have
often been overstated when compared to the company's actual sales.  Additionally, traffic to
Gifford-Hill was affected by the embargo for only a little more than a month, and no credible
evidence of actual lost business to that shipper was produced. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Under these circumstances, we conclude that the Shippers (in particular GS Roofing and
Gifford-Hill) have not carried their burden of proof concerning the amount of lost profits.  Nor
have the Shippers demonstrated that the lack of rail service alone was the sole cause for any lost
sales.  Therefore, consistent with the agency's normal practice, we will not accept the lost profit
claims.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	2.  <u>Professional Fees and Other Miscellaneous Expenses, Including Attorney Fees</u>. 
Awarding "professional fees" (and associated or miscellaneous expenses), including attorney
fees involved in obtaining the service order that ended the embargo, or litigating the feeder line
case in the circumstances presented here, would be contrary to agency practice.<a href="#N_56_"><sup>(56)</sup></a>  The ICC
consistently rejected awarding attorney fees unless specifically authorized by statute.  <u>See</u> <u>Webb</u>;
<u>Crosby</u>.  The Shippers rely on <u>Meeker v. Lehigh Valley R. Co.</u>, 236 U.S. 412 (1915), which they
claim holds that carriers must pay for attorney fees for litigating complaints before the ICC
regarding a carrier's duty to provide service.  However, that case turned on a statutory
requirement for the reimbursement of attorney fees, which has been repealed.  The Shippers
further argue that attorney fees may be recovered when they are incurred to mitigate damages. 
But the cases they rely on, <u>Women's Federal Sav. and Loan v. Nevada Nat. Bank</u>, 607 F. Supp.
1129, 1135-6 (D. Nev. 1985), <u>rev'd on other grounds</u>, 811 F.2d 1255 (9th Cir. 1987), and
<u>American Fed. Of Mus. v. Reno's Riverside Hotel, Inc.</u>, 86 Nev. 695, 475 P.2d 220, 222 (1970),
were decided under Nevada state law and thus are not controlling.  Furthermore, it would not be
appropriate to award "professional fees" related to obtaining the service order where, as here,
AMR promptly agreed to the provision of service by DRRC/CALM and then ETC and forwent
monetary compensation except for the 3 miles of trackage rights over the southernmost portion
of the line.  Accordingly, we will not award damages based on these claims.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	3.  <u>Costs Associated With Alternative Shipping Methods and the Interim Transloading
Facility</u>.  We will, however, award damages based on the cost differentials for obtaining
alternative transportation and the cost of construction for the interim transloading facility.<a href="#N_57_"><sup>(57)</sup></a> 
These costs appear to have been incurred as a direct result of the lack of rail service on portions
of the Norman Branch from December 24, 1994, until April 15, 1994.  Accordingly, they
constitute appropriate damages under the court's decision in <u>GS Roofing</u>.  Although, as
defendants' claim, the documentation for some of these costs is not complete, the claims are
nonetheless reasonable, based on what the parties presented to us, because they are supported by
witnesses with personal knowledge that the expenses were incurred.<a href="#N_58_"><sup>(58)</sup></a>  Moreover, the Shippers
explain that back-up documents that support the Shippers' calculations regarding truck
movements were made available for inspection by defendants at the Shippers' offices, but
defendants never availed themselves of the opportunity to examine all the documents.  The
railroads also failed to raise any issues with respect to access to documents during discovery
conducted by the ICC's Office of Hearings in 1994.  In these circumstances, we will accept the
Shippers' figures.<a href="#N_59_"><sup>(59)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Limiting damages to the costs of construction of the interim terminal ($143,571.62) and
of freight differentials for shipments that actually moved between December 24th and April 15th
(evidently $48,992.88) results in total damages of $192,564.50, plus interest.  These damages are
limited to Bean Lumber, to which AMR is directed to remit $121,247.60, plus interest, and GS
Roofing, to which AMR is directed to remit $71,316.90, plus interest.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	4. <u>Interest</u>.  Interest will accrue from the date of payment of each part of each shipper's
particular damages, until the date of payment by AMR of damages found due in this decision. 
Interest will be based on the 91-day Treasury Bill Equivalent yield for the quarter during which
each payment was made.  The 91-day Treasury Bill Equivalent yield is published by the U.S.
Department of the Treasury in the Treasury Bulletin.  Interest shall be calculated pursuant to the
procedures outline at 49 CFR 1141.1(a)(2) and 1141.1(b)(2).  The Shippers shall calculate the
interest due and provide AMR with their calculations within 15 days from the service date of this
decision.  Within 30 days after the effective date of this decision, AMR shall remit to GS
Roofing and Bean Lumber payment of the damages and interest as set forth in this decision.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	D.  <u>AMR/Pinsly Relationship</u>.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	1. <u>The Parties' Arguments</u>.  Finally, the Shippers argue that Pinsly is the alter ego of
AMR and therefore also is liable for the damages we are awarding.  The Shippers allege that
AMR has no real managerial, operational or financial independence from Pinsly.  They point out
that M. P. Silver is President and Treasurer of both AMR and Pinsly and a director in both
companies; that John Levine is Vice President and Secretary of both companies and a director of
both AMR and Pinsly; and that Marc R. Levine, Robert B. Smith, and Louis L. Lederman are
each directors in both companies.  The Shippers allege that Pinsly was directly involved in and
approved the decision to issue the embargo and to seek abandonment authority instead of making
repairs to reinstitute service on the northern portion of the line.  While the Shippers acknowledge
that the ICC previously denied a request to pierce the corporate veil between AMR and Pinsly in
<u>Acquisition</u>,<a href="#N_60_"><sup>(60)</sup></a> the Shippers claim that, based on their new evidence, we now should treat AMR as
Pinsly's alter ego.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Specifically, the Shippers state that, in <u>Acquisition</u>, the ICC found that Pinsly's financial
commitments were limited to permissible start-up costs.  The Shippers maintain that Pinsly's
financial involvement with AMR actually is significantly greater, alleging that between
February&nbsp;21, 1992, and May&nbsp;15, 1994:  no AMR check was ever cut at any Arkansas facility;
AMR checks were signed by officers of Pinsly in Massachusetts; all purchase orders exceeding
$600 were approved and issued in Massachusetts; AMR had no financial or accounting personnel
in Arkansas; and pricing arrangements with UP were negotiated by Pinsly, not AMR.  The
Shippers allege that Pinsly made capital infusions into AMR of almost $1.2 million between
1992 and 1994.  They also claim that Pinsly maintained total operational control of AMR.<a href="#N_61_"><sup>(61)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	In response, the railroads argue that Pinsly and AMR are independent corporations whose
separate identities should not be disregarded, citing <u>Acquisition</u> at 3-4.  They note that the new
evidence offered by the Shippers to support piercing the corporate veil consists of statements of
former AMR employees, all but one of whom were subsequently employed by DRRC/CALM. 
The railroads suggest that the testimony of these people may be compromised by their past
experience with AMR.  They reject the idea that because Mr. Levine, a vice president, secretary,
and director in both corporations, prefers to work from Pinsly's Massachusetts offices, he cannot
be considered local management for AMR.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Defendants rely on <u>Schenley Corp. v. United States</u>, 326 U.S. 432, 437 (1946), where the
Supreme Court established a general proscription against piercing the corporate veil:<a href="#N_62_"><sup>(62)</sup></a>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	While corporate entities may be disregarded where they are made the implement
for avoiding a clear legislative purpose, they will not be disregarded where those
in control have deliberately adopted the corporate form in order to secure its
advantages and where no violence to the legislative purpose is done by treating
the corporate entity as a separate legal person.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The railroads point out that the Shippers have not alleged that AMR was formed for the purpose
of evading the common carrier obligation of section 11101.  They also note that the ICC based
its refusal to pierce the corporate veil in <u>Acquisition</u> on "the insulation which the subsidiary
[AMR] provides to the parent [Pinsly] and other members of the commonly controlled system
from the financial risks of the new enterprise."  <u>Acquisition</u>, at 3.  The railroads argue that this
insulation is sufficient reason for a corporation to form a subsidiary such as AMR, citing
<u>Southeastern Rail Corp.--Acquisition and Operation Exemption--Gulf and Mississippi Railroad
Corp.</u>, Finance Docket No. 31187 (ICC served Aug. 31, 1989).  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Sharing common officers and directors and even close control by the parent of its
subsidiary does not warrant piercing the corporate veil, defendants argue, citing <u>Chesapeake and
Albemarle Railroad Company, Inc.--Lease, Acquisition, and Operation Exemption--Southern
Railway Company</u>, Finance Docket No. 31617, <u>et</u> <u>al.</u> (ICC served Sept. 19, 1991).  The railroads, 
while admitting the close relationship between Pinsly and AMR, explain that AMR conducts
sufficiently independent operations and that its general manager makes daily management
decisions, submitting as evidence numerous letters from Mr. Hunter to the Shippers.  The
railroads also point out that Pinsly controls 5 other railroads, as well as AMR, and state that the
cases cited by the Shippers rest on the finding that the formation of the subsidiary was for the
purposeful evasion of a statute, which, the railroads maintain, is not the case here.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	2.  <u>Our Conclusions</u>.  The Board, like the ICC, does not ordinarily dictate the corporate
structure under which railroads must be organized, and we will only disregard corporate structure
in very limited circumstances, i.e., if there were no legitimate financial reasons for the subsidiary
or other corporate entity to be formed.  <u>See</u>, <u>e.g.,</u> <u>Schenley</u>, 326 U.S. at 437; <u>Railway Labor
Exec. Ass'n v. ICC</u>, 999 F.2d 574 (D.C. Cir. 1993); <u>Railway Labor Exec. Ass'n v. ICC</u>, 914 F.2d
276 (D.C. Cir. 1990), <u>cert. denied</u>, 499 U.S. 959 (1991); <u>Railway Labor Exec. Ass'n v. United
States</u>, 791 F.2d 994, 1006 (2d Cir. 1986); <u>Acquisition</u> at 3-4.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	To determine whether to disregard corporate identities, the ICC developed and applied a
so-called "alter ego" test focused on whether (1) the subsidiary was created to purchase the line 
for legitimate and substantial business reasons (e.g., insulation from financial risk, preservation
of service, or time constraints) and not solely to avoid regulatory requirements and (2) the
dealings between the two companies were "at arms length and there [was] evidence of 'indicia of
independence' of the subsidiary" and its parent or affiliated carriers.  <u>New England Central
Railroad, Inc.--Acquisition and Operation--Lines Between East Alburgh, VT and New London,
CT</u>, Finance Docket No. 32432 (ICC served Dec. 9, 1994), <u>aff'd</u> <u>sub</u> <u>nom.</u> <u>Brotherhood of R.R.
Signalmen v. ICC</u>, 63 F.3d 638 (7th Cir. 1995), <u>reh'g denied</u>, Sept. 12, 1995.  The Board now
uses the "alter ego" test.  <u>Mountain Laurel Railroad Company--Acquisition and Operation
Exemption--Consolidated Rail Corporation</u>, Finance Docket No. 31974 (STB served May 15,
1998).   

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	The ICC already applied this "alter ego" test to AMR in <u>Acquisition</u>, and found that
AMR was created for "substantial business reasons."  <u>Acquisition</u> at 4.  The Shippers have
offered more documentation to support their claims of lack of independence by AMR's
management.  Moreover, they have shown that Pinsly contributes more than just start-up costs to
AMR.  But the evidence fails to establish that AMR is Pinsly's alter ego, that AMR was created
for the purpose of avoiding Pinsly's statutory obligations, or that there are no legitimate business
reasons for the corporate structure chosen.  Because AMR thus is sufficiently independent of
Pinsly, we reaffirm the ICC's decision in <u>Acquisition</u> not to pierce the corporate veil. 
Accordingly, we hold AMR solely accountable for the payment of the damages that we have
awarded.

took effect on January 1, 1996, abolished the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) and
transferred certain functions and proceedings to the Surface Transportation Board (Board). 
Section 204(c) of the ICCTA provides, in general, that, if a court remands a suit against the ICC
that was pending on the date of that legislation and involves functions retained by the ICCTA,
subsequent proceedings related to the case shall proceed under the applicable law and regulations
in effect at the time of the subsequent proceedings.  The functions at issue in these proceedings
were retained and are now found at 49 U.S.C. 10907 and 49 U.S.C. 11101(a).
<p><a name="N_2_">2. </a>  The Feeder Line Development Program at 49 U.S.C. 10907 enables shippers and

Products, et al. v. STB</u>, (8th Cir. filed August 20, 1999).  The court case is being held in
abeyance pending our consideration of the petition for reconsideration of the constitutional
minimum value we set in that decision, and of the reply, which also requested that we reopen on
our own motion to adjust the purchase price.
<p><a name="N_4_">4. </a>  The Norman Branch was one of four rail lines that AMR purchased from UP's
subsidiary, the Missouri Pacific Railroad Company (MP).  <u>See</u> <u>Arkansas Midland Railroad

Inc.--Continuance In Control Exemption--Arkansas Midland Railroad Company, Inc.</u>, Finance
Docket No. 32001 (ICC served Mar. 6, 1992).
<p><a name="N_5_">5. </a>  Prior decisions in this proceeding described the Norman Branch as being 52.9 miles
long between milepost 426.3 near Gurdon and milepost 479.2 at Birds Mill.  Subsequently, the
ICC accepted the assertion that the line terminates at the interchange with UP at milepost 426.87.

<p><a name="N_14_">14. </a>  On May 17, 1995, GSR filed a second notice of exemption in Finance Docket No.
32705 to lease and operate (with an option to purchase) the northern portion of track and to
operate trackage rights over the southern portion of the line.  GSR's notice became effective
May&nbsp;24, 1995, and was served and published on June 15, 1995 (60 FR 31494).  The ICC
subsequently denied a motion filed by CALM to have GSR's notice of exemption declared void

on remand in the feeder line proceeding.  GSR is not currently operating the line.
<p><a name="N_15_">15. </a>  Specifically, we directed the parties to submit updated evidence and argument as to
whether the five criteria set forth in 49 U.S.C. 10907(c) require or permit a forced sale of the
entire line.  In addition, we noted that the Eighth Circuit in <u>Caddo Antoine</u> (95 F.3d at 748)
indicated that we should take into account in reaching our decision on remand AMR's argument
that it would suffer a grievous financial loss that would jeopardize the remainder of its rail line
operations if it were required to sell the southernmost portion of the line on which it serves IP.  
We invited further evidence addressing the matter, particularly the views of AMR as to whether
the impact of the loss of IP's traffic would be mitigated by receiving the proceeds from the sale
of the line, as the Shippers had claimed.  We also invited additional evidence on the Shippers'
financial responsibility and the valuation of the line.  Finally, we rejected AMR's request that we
terminate the feeder line proceeding in view of the substitution of ETC as the operator of the line. 
We also denied AMR's motion to strike the financial projections submitted by the Shippers
relating to ETC's proposed operations and found that GSR, which had indicated that it remained
interested in leasing and operating the line under the notice of exemption in Finance Docket No.
32705, had a legitimate interest in this proceeding and should be able to participate.

<p>	The parties submitted supplemental statements on June 27, 1997, and reply statements on
July 14, 1997.  The feeder line applicants submitted a rebuttal statement on July 30, 1997.  The
data submitted by the parties included confidential data submitted under seal.
<p><a name="N_16_">16. </a>  The August 1999 Decision noted that AMR witness James A. Bowers had indicated
that AMR realized revenues of $612,000 in 1996 from operating the southern portion and that
Shipper witnesses Joseph J. Plaistow and Christina N. Adams had countered that AMR's
revenues were $425,660, a figure that was based on revenue data which AMR had submitted on
discovery.  We accepted the Shippers' revenue figure as the better evidence based on the record. 
<p><a name="N_17_">17. </a>  The cost figure was derived from a verified statement of AMR witness Bowers.  Mr.
Bowers did not provide a breakdown of the individual expenses that AMR incurred in 1996 from
operating the southern portion.
<p><a name="N_18_">18. </a>  In <u>Railroad Cost of Capital--1996</u>, STB Ex Parte No. 558 (STB served July 16, 1997),
we found that the after-tax cost of capital for 1996 is 11.9%.  The pre-tax cost of capital
equivalent of this number is 17.7% (which assumes 35% Federal and 2% state tax rates).  We
used a 1996 cost of capital in the August 1999 Decision because the parties' evidence was for
1996.
<p><a name="N_19_">19. </a>  AMR explains that at the time of the prior round of pleadings in this matter (Summer
1997) AMR was arguing that ETC's projections should be the basis for establishing the GCV of
the line and the Shippers were arguing that 1993 AMR data should be used, if GCV was applied
at all.
<p><a name="N_20_">20. </a>  AMR argues that the $124,000 for car-hire income should be included because the
$297,000 in variable costs we included in developing a GCV contained $154,800 in Car Lease
Costs.  Evidently, AMR leases the boxcars used in the movement of IP traffic.
<p><a name="N_21_">21. </a>  According to Mr. Plasse, the Norman Branch's "other revenue" is an allocation of
AMR's revenues of this type in 1996.  The allocation was developed by comparing direct freight
revenue on the Norman Branch South ($425,660) with AMR's total direct freight revenue
($3,148,841), and then applying that percentage ($425,660 &#247; $3,148,841 = 13.518%) to AMR's
total "other revenue" in 1996 ($328,889 x 13.518% = $44,459).
<p><a name="N_22_">22. </a>  The difference depends on whether the Board simply recomputes the revenue figure or
whether instead it makes AMR's other proposed changes to the Board's calculation of GCV. 
AMR does not seek reconsideration of our decision to use the 1996 railroad cost of capital as the
earnings multiplier.
<p><a name="N_23_">23. </a>  AMR does not challenge our decision to approve the feeder line application for the
entire line under the PC&amp;N standards at 49 U.S.C. 10907(c)(1).  Nor does it question our
determination that the Shippers are financially responsible.
<p><a name="N_24_">24. </a>  In the ICC's 1995 feeder line decision the ICC set the NLV of the entire Norman
Branch at $972,282.  The northern portion was valued at $901,834, and the southern portion at
$70,448.  However, in prior decisions in the trackage rights compensation proceeding, the ICC
accepted DRRC/CALM's adjustment of the mileage of the line.  The ICC then determined the
NLV of the entire line to be $961,096.24.  Neither AMR nor the Shippers have updated the NLV
data that was filed with the ICC.
<p><a name="N_25_">25. </a>  AMR states that these revenues are derived based on an allocation of all other non-line
AMR revenues based on the percentage of revenues on the southern portion of the Norman
Branch to total AMR revenue.
<p><a name="N_26_">26. </a>  For example, AMR does not include any costs relative to maintenance of way, general
and administrative costs, or depreciation expense associated with the movement of overhead
traffic from the northern portion of the Norman Branch.
<p><a name="N_27_">27. </a>  It appears unlikely that all of IP's 2,867 carloads could move in the 30 leased cars.  
Under the best case scenario, the cars would have to realize a cycle time of 3.81 days per car. 
(2867/30 = 95.6 trips per car) (365 days / 95.6 = 3.81 cycle days per car.)  Such efficient cycle
times are normally only obtained in unit train operations and not in the single and multiple car
movements involved in moving IP's traffic.
<p><a name="N_28_">28. </a>  The $425,660 in line-haul revenues we included in our August 1999 Decision included
all of IP's 2,867 carloads.
<p><a name="N_29_">29. </a>  At that point, the Shippers's witnesses had presented evidence that, in 1993, the last
year AMR operated the entire Norman Branch, AMR's operations resulted in a negative GCV.
(AMR's witness Bowers also acknowledged that the line lost money in 1993 and that data for
that year would not produce a positive GCV.)  In the August 1999 Decision, we rejected the
1993 data because the more current 1996 data in the record better reflected current traffic levels
and demand for services.  Nothing in the parties' subsequent pleadings indicates that we should
reconsider that determination here.
<p><a name="N_30_">30. </a>  AMR witness Plasse indicates that the leased cars that are used to serve IP would be
assigned to another shipper on another AMR line after sale of the Norman Branch.  Thus, AMR
would continue to realize lease revenues in the event of a sale.
<p><a name="N_31_">31. </a>  The ICC stated that, in setting compensation, it would use the method usually
employed to determine a tenant's payment for trackage rights.  <u>See</u> <u>Arkansas &amp; Missouri R. Co.
v. Missouri Pacific R. Co.</u>, 6 I.C.C.2d 619, 622 (1990), <u>aff'd</u> <u>sub</u> <u>nom.</u> <u>Missouri Pacific R. Co. v.
ICC</u>, 23 F.3d 531 (D.C. Cir. 1994).
<p><a name="N_32_">32. </a>  This approach is consistent with our decisions in the recent "UP/SP" and "CSX/NS"
transactions, where we concluded that if the agreed-upon trackage rights fees are lower than the
rate we would set, the fees are reasonable and will not be adjusted upward.  <u>See</u> <u>Union
Pacific/Southern Pacific Merger</u>, 1 S.T.B. 233 (1996), <u>aff'd</u> <u>sub</u> <u>nom.</u> <u>Western Coal Traffic

In response to the railroads' reply, this figure was adjusted downward on rebuttal by reducing a

competitive, and in the past G.S. Roofing has shown a willingness to move 100% of the filler to
truck when Union Pacific attempted to raise the price.  Moreover, interviews with G.S. Roofing
management indicate that derailment delays have forced the company to turn to truck service for
those customers that require just-in-time service.  As a result, G.S. Roofing has built a base of
truck vendors they did not previously have.  As that list grows and relationships are strengthened,
it becomes easier and easier for G.S. Roofing to turn to that alternative.")  The <u>Rehab. Request</u> is
