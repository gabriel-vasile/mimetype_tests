<p><h3>BACKGROUND</h3>
<p><h3>PURPOSE OF THE BILL</h3>
<p>This bill makes appropriations for the functions of the Departments of Commerce, Justice, State, the Judiciary and Related Agencies for the period October 1, 2001, through September 30, 2002. Functional areas include the pay, allowances, and support of personnel, operation and maintenance, procurement of equipment and systems, and research.
<p>The bill provides funds for fighting crime, enhancing drug enforcement, responding to the threat of terrorism, addressing the shortcomings of the immigration process, continuing the judicial process, conducting commerce within the United States, improving State Department operations, and fullfilling the needs of various independent agencies.
<p><h3>HEARINGS</h3>
<p>The Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, State, the Judiciary and Related Agencies Appropriations began hearings on the fiscal year 2002 budget request on April 26, 2001, and concluded them on June 28, 2001, after holding 9 separate sessions. The subcommittee heard testimony from representatives of the Departments of Commerce, Justice, State, and various commissions.
<p><h3>SUMMARY OF THE BILL</h3>
<p>The budget estimates for the departments and agencies included in the accompanying bill are contained in the budget of the United States for fiscal year 2002 submitted on April 9, 2001 and a budget amendment submitted May 7, 2001.
<p>The total amount of new budget authority recommended by the Committee for fiscal year 2002 is $41,527,177,000. This amount is an increase of $1,743,136,000 above appropriations enacted for fiscal year 2001 for these departments and agencies. The Committee recommendation is $719,957,000 above the budget estimates.
<p><h2>REPROGRAMMINGS, REORGANIZATIONS, AND RELOCATIONS</h2>
<p>As in previous years, the Committee is inserting section 605 under title VI of the general provisions of the bill.
<p>The Committee directs that both the House and Senate chairmen of the Subcommittees on the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the judiciary, and related agencies will be notified by letter at least 15 days prior to:
<p> --Reprogramming of funds, whether permanent or temporary, in excess of $500,000 or 10 percent, whichever is less, between programs or activities. In addition, the Committee desires to be notified of reprogramming actions which are less than these amounts if such actions would have the effect of committing the agency to significant funding requirements in future years;
<p> --Increasing funds or personnel by any means for any project or activity for which funds have been denied or restricted;
<p> --Creation of new programs, offices, agencies, or commissions, or substantial augmentations of existing programs, offices, agencies, or commissions;
<p> --Relocations of offices or employees;
<p> --Reorganization of offices, programs, or activities; and
<p> --Contracts out or privatizes any functions or activities presently performed by Federal employees.
<p> The Committee directs each department or agency to notify the Committee when the number of political appointees rises above 10 percent from either of the previous 2 years or when five or more political appointees are added in a given year. The Committee should be notified 30 days before either of these situations occurs. Similar notification should be provided when the same number of personnel positions is converted from political appointments to civil service positions.
<p>In addition, the Committee directs departments or agencies funded in the accompanying bill that are planning to conduct a reduction in force to notify the Committees by letter 30 days in advance of the date of the proposed personnel action. Also, the Committee directs that any items which are subject to interpretation will be reported.

<p><h3>TITLE I--DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</h3>
<p>The Committee has made funding for law enforcement the centerpiece of the fiscal year 2002 appropriations bill.  The Committee recommends $21,532,214,000 in new budget (obligational) authority in the accompanying bill for the Department of Justice with a strong emphasis on law enforcement activities for fiscal year 2002.
<p>The Committee shares the desire of the House to channel most of its inquiries and requests for information and assistance through the budget offices or comptroller organizations, but reserves the right to call upon all organizations throughout the agencies. The Committee continues to stress the natural affinity between these offices and the Appropriations Committee, which makes such a relationship imperative.

<p>This account funds the development of policy objectives and the overall management of the Department of Justice. The Committee recommends an appropriation of $93,433,000. The recommendation is identical to the budget request and provides for all needed adjustments to base.
<p><em>IDENT/IAFIS</em>- Shortcomings in the INS' Automated Biometric Identification System [`IDENT'] database were blamed for the release of suspected serial killer Rafael Resendez Ramirez. In the wake of Resendez Ramirez's later surrender, Justice Management Division [JMD] took over development and integration of IDENT and the FBI's Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System [IAFIS]. That effort has been expanded to integrate the INS' Enforcement Case Tracking System [`ENFORCE'] with IDENT/IAFIS. The Committee recommendation provides a $1,000,000 increase over fiscal year 2001 for management of the development and piloting of IDENT/IAFIS. JMD is directed to provide the Committees on Appropriations with progress reports as needed.
<p><em>International Law Enforcement Training Academy/Mexico</em>- The Committee believes a law enforcement training academy, similar to the International Law Enforcement Academies (ILEAs) in Budapest and Bangkok, should be established in Southern Mexico. United States law enforcement agency personnel would manage the facility and conduct the courses, and in the process develop personal relationships with Mexican law enforcement personnel that would be invaluable to future liaison and cooperative international law enforcement activities. The Committee directs the Attorney General, in consultation and collaboration with the Secretary of State, to provide a report to the Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate no later than May 12, 2002 on the feasibility of establishing ILEA-Mexico. The Committee expects the report to include a timeline, cost analysis, and implementation plan for establishing ILEA-Mexico.

<p>This account centrally funds development, acquisition, and deployment of the joint automated booking system [JABS]. Previously, JABS funding was distributed among various Justice components.
<p>The Committee recommends an appropriation of $22,500,000. The recommendation is $6,543,000 above the  budget request.

<p>JABS will: (1) standardize booking data, procedures, and equipment throughout Justice; (2) save funds by eliminating repetitive booking of suspects; and (3) improve public safety by identifying repeat offenders and persons with outstanding charges or warrants.
<p>JABS incentive funds are to be distributed to the component or components making the best progress in installing and operating the system.
<p><h2>LEGAL ACTIVITIES OFFICE AUTOMATION</h2>

<p>This account centrally funds acquisition, deployment, and maintenance of legal activities office automation [LAOA] systems, the largest components of which are the justice consolidated network [JCN] and the justice consolidated office network [JCON]. Previously, LAOA funding was included under `General Legal Activities'. The adoption of a common standard and uniform equipment across Justice components has improved efficiency and saved money.
<p>The Committee recommends an appropriation of $34,600,000. The recommendation is $15,723,000 above the budget request. In addition, the Committee understands that $17,200,000 in prior year funds will be available for LAOA.
<p>LAOA is the computer modernization program for the legal divisions, including the Antitrust Division, the U.S. Attorneys, the U.S. Marshals Service, the U.S. Trustees, the Executive Office for Immigration Review, the Community Relations Service, and the offices funded through the `General Administration' and `General Legal Activities' accounts. The JCN will also serve as part of the backbone for the FBI's `Trilogy' program. For years, funding for computer modernization at the Department has been neglected. The Committee has pushed hard in previous years to increase the funds for, and widen the scope of, JCN and JCON to maximize the benefits of a common computer system across components. Most recently, the U.S. Marshals Service has been incorporated into the network. The increase in funding over last year is caused by the initial deployment of equipment to the U.S. Attorneys, by far the largest of the participants, and inclusion of the Marshals, the participating agency with network and office suites most in need of modernization.
<p><h2>NARROWBAND COMMUNICATIONS</h2>

<p>This account centrally funds development, acquisition, deployment, and operation and maintenance of the Justice Department's narrowband wireless communications network. By law, all Justice components operating Land Mobile Radio [LMR] systems in the VHF band must convert by January 1, 2005.
<p>The Committee recommends an appropriation of $204,549,000. The recommendation is $99,943,000 above the budget request. Previously, narrowband communications compliance funding was scattered among various Justice components.
<p>Troubles noted below have forced the Wireless Management Office [WMO] to focus current investments on sustaining legacy systems. At the present rate of investment, the Justice Department will not meet the narrowband conversion deadline. In anticipation that problems described below can be resolved by the second quarter of fiscal year 2002, the Committee recommendation provides the funds necessary to jump start procurement of digital radios.
<p>The Committee is aware that progress on converting to narrowband radios has been considerably slowed  due to differences among components and the WMO over network requirements. Components are demanding network coverage and capabilities far in excess of current system performance and cost. Though final requirements finally have been established, the Committee is very concerned that the system acceptable to the collective may be completely unaffordable. The WMO is directed to submit    a program plan based on the final list of system requirements and a breakout, by fiscal year and activity, of the total program cost based on the program plan not later than December 31, 2001. None of the funds provided for Narrowband Communications for fiscal year 2002 may be made available until the Committees on Appropriations have approved this program plan.
<p>Central management of narrowband radio investments will, when properly enforced: (1) maximize resource sharing; (2) ensure system efficiency and interoperability; and (3) sharply reduce up front and out year costs Department-wide.
<p><h3>PORT SECURITY</h3>

<p>This account funds the acquisition, deployment, and maintenance of port security facilities and equipment for federal law enforcement agencies [LEAs]. Previously, such funds as were available for port security activities were embedded in the accounts of participating LEAs.
<p>The Committee recommends an appropriation of $39,950,000. The recommendation is $39,950,000 above the budget request. The Committee is alarmed by the lax security at U.S. seaports. Thousands of vessels, and millions of containers, move in and out of ports with almost no inspection of cargo. In terms of both counter-terrorism and counter-narcotics, this is an enormous gap in the security net we have drawn around our borders. The Committee directs the Justice Department, specifically the Deputy Attorney General for Combatting Terrorism, to develop a nationwide, multi-agency port security plan for submission to the Committee not later than February 14, 2002.
<p><h2>COUNTERTERRORISM FUND</h2>
<p><table border=2>
<tr><td>Appropriations, 2001</td>

</table>
<p>The Committee does not recommend an appropriation for the `Counterterrorism fund' account. The recommendation is $4,989,000 below the request and the fiscal year 2001 appropriation. The Committee is aware that there will be carryover balances available in fiscal year 2002 in excess of $41,077,000.
<p>This fund is under the control and direction of the Deputy Attorney General for Combatting Terrorism to: (1) cover the costs incurred in reestablishing the operational capability of an office or facility which has been damaged or destroyed as a result of any domestic or international terrorist incident; (2) cover the costs of providing support to counter, investigate, or prosecute domestic or international terrorism, including payment of rewards in connection with these activities; and (3) cover the costs of conducting a terrorism threat assessment of Federal agencies and their facilities.
<p><em>National Guard</em>- The Committee's goals include providing States with an improved ability to respond to terrorist threats or events. This includes training and equipping the first responder who will arrive at the scene within 1 hour of an attack. The Committee is also aware of the States' Community Support Teams that are expected to arrive within 6 to 8 hours after an event has occurred. The Committee urges the National Guard Bureau (NGB) to significantly reduce this arrival time.
<p>The Committee is aware of the important work the National Guard is doing in preparing for terrorist attacks. Last year, the Defense Subcommittee provided funding for counterterrorism infrastructure at the NGB. This funding remains available to help support the work of the co-coordinators for combatting domestic terrorism.
<p><h3>DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR COMBATING DOMESTIC TERRORISM</h3>
<p>The United States is in the beginning stages of developing an organizational structure for leadership in the area of terrorism preparedness. A National Coordinator for Security, Infrastructure Protection, and Counterterrorism was established 4 years ago within the National Security Council. Under Presidential Decision Directive 62, the National Coordinator was tasked with coordinating interagency terrorism policy issues and reviewing ongoing terrorism-related activities. While the designation of a National Coordinator signaled the previous Administration's recognition of the weight of the problem, it was not a permanent solution. Responsibility for developing national security policy belongs to the President. However, it is the responsibility of the Congress to provide the means to implement a systematic and synchronized policy that will achieve sustainable Federal, State, and local cooperation on domestic terrorism issues. Whomever is responsible for managing this Nation's activities to combat terrorism must be accountable to the American people.
<p>Despite increased attention to this problem over the last 5 years, there remains considerable confusion over jurisdiction at all levels of government. In order to improve coordination and centralize the policy-making structure for domestic terrorism within the Department of Justice, the Committee recommends the creation of a Deputy Attorney General for Combating Domestic Terrorism (DAG-CT). The Committee recommends $23,000,000 for this purpose. The DAG-CT shall have as its principal duty the overall coordination and implementation of policy aimed at preventing, preparing for, and responding to terrorist attacks within the United States. This person will be directly responsible to the Attorney General. This office will be responsible for domestic terrorism policy development and coordination and will speak for the Department on and coordinate with all of the appropriate agencies for terrorism-related matters.
<p>The DAG-CT will be nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. This person will work with localities across the country, all of the States and territories, and all of the Federal agencies and departments with responsibility for combating terrorism. The DAG-CT will not be in any other chain of command within the Department of Justice. The DAG-CT will not be considered as a successor to the Attorney General. This position is recommended only to address terrorism within the United States and should not compete with the present Deputy Attorney General position. It shall be the responsibility of the DAG-CT to select, appoint, employ, and determine the compensation of personnel to carry out the Office's primary purpose, to monitor the implementation of the national strategy and associated classified and unclassified plans, including conducting program and performance audits and evaluations.
<p><em>The National Strategy</em>- The American people, the Congress, the President, the Attorney General, and the Director of FEMA must be able to look to one strategy to keep this country safe from domestic terrorism. In conjunction with the Vice President, the DAG-CT and the Deputy Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) shall develop and implement a national strategy establishing the policies, objectives, and priorities of the Federal Government for preventing, preparing for, and responding to domestic terrorist attacks. The strategy shall include measurable objectives to be achieved. The national strategy shall include a description of the role each Federal department and agency and State and local government entity performs in combating terrorism, as well as a description of Federal training, equipment, exercise, and grant programs. The strategy shall rest on four pillars: prevention (including detection and deterrence), preparedness, crisis management, and consequence management (including long term response).
<p>A comprehensive national strategy is benign unless its custodian has the tools to implement it. The DAG-CT and Deputy Director of FEMA will thus be responsible for advising the President and Vice-President on ways to ensure that agencies' and departments' programs and policies complement the national strategy. The DAG-CT and Deputy Director of FEMA must be kept appraised of any changes in the organization, management, or budgets of the Federal departments and agencies as they relate to combating domestic terrorism. The Committee therefore directs all agencies and departments involved in combating domestic terrorism to participate in an annual review process that the DAG-CT and Deputy Director of FEMA will coordinate for the President and Vice-President. In conducting their review, the DAG-CT and Deputy Director of FEMA shall consult with the appropriate entities. The purpose of the review is to allow the DAG-CT and Deputy Director of FEMA to better coordinate agencies' policies, programs, and budgets for combating domestic terrorism and monitor their progress in implementing the national strategy.
<p>The DAG-CT and Deputy Director of FEMA shall provide the Committees on Appropriations a plan for implementing the national strategy. The DAG-CT and Deputy Director of FEMA together shall develop a strategy and plan in consultation with the department and agency heads involved in combating domestic terrorism, the Congress, and the State and Local Advisory Group. They shall submit the strategy and plan through the Attorney General and the Director of FEMA to the Congress, President, and Vice-President.
<p><em>Risk and Threat Assessments</em>- A rigorous and continuous assessment of risk will help ensure that training, equipment, and other safeguards are justified and targeted. Decisions must be based on a threat, the level of uncertainty regarding that threat, vulnerability to attack, and the criticality of assets. They should not be based solely on the worst-case, but rather on a range of plausible threat scenarios. These scenarios should, to the extent possible, be developed with reference to past incidents, U.S. program experience, and current intelligence. Regularly scheduled exercises such as TOPOFF will serve to demonstrate and refine the national strategy. Continually updated intelligence and law enforcement input, therefore, is crucial to the process. A multidisciplinary team of experts selected by the DAG-CT and Deputy Director of FEMA will generate these objectives and a plan for ensuring their currency. This plan should be provided to the Committees on Appropriations no later than May 1 of each year.
<p><em>Reorganization</em>- The National Domestic Preparedness Office (NDPO), currently under the FBI, will be transferred to the DAG-CT. The NDPO is directed to provide support to the FEMA, which has been given the responsibility of serving as a single point of contact for State and local governments by the President. The Office of State and Local Domestic Preparedness Support (OSLDPS), formerly under the Office of Justice Programs (OJP), will also be transferred to the DAG-CT. The OJP will continue to administer grants involving counterterrorism equipment, training, and preparedness activities. However the DAG-CT, through OSLDPS, will be responsible for the programmatic development of these grant programs and will have final approval authority. The Committee also believes that certain other national security policy entities within the Department of Justice should report to the DAG-CT, including the Executive Office of National Security. Finally, funding for terrorism-related research, development, test, and evaluate (RDT&E) programs within the Department of Justice will pass through the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) with direction from the DAG-CT as to how funds will be spent.
<p><em>Budget Approval</em>- The Committee directs the DAG-CT and Deputy Director of FEMA to develop for each fiscal year a government-wide budget to implement the national strategy. They shall do so in consultation with the Vice-President, the Office of Management and Budget, and the departments and agencies and program managers with responsibility for combating domestic terrorism. The DAG-CT and Deputy Director of FEMA shall advise all such departments and agencies in preparation of their budgets prior to submission. The Attorney General and Director of FEMA shall transmit one consolidated budget proposal with revised requests to the President simultaneous to submission to the OMB. The DAG-CT shall generate reprogrammings within the Department of Justice under section 605 for that funding available for the implementation of the national strategy.

<p>The Executive Office for Immigration Review [EOIR] includes the Board of Immigration Appeals, immigration judges, and administrative law judges who decide through administrative hearings whether to admit or exclude aliens seeking to enter the country, and whether to deport or adjust the status of aliens whose status has been challenged. This account also funds the Office of the Pardon Attorney which receives, investigates, and considers petitions for all forms of executive clemency.
<p>The Committee recommends an appropriation of $45,813,000. The recommendation is $132,686,000 below the budget request. The recommendation assumes that $127,834,000 in funds from the Immigration and Naturalization Service `immigration examinations fee' account will be made available for EOIR operations, including $1,200,000 for contract court interpreter services for immigration court proceedings. Exam fees may be used for expenses in providing immigration adjudication.

<p>The Detention Trustee oversees Federal detainees. The Committee  recommends an appropriation of $88,884,000. The recommendation is $87,166,000 above the budget request.
<p>The Trustee has management responsibility for detention, but funding remains under the control of the various components. Without control of funds, the Trustee is powerless. Noting this weakness last year, the conferees directed that detention funds be consolidated under the Trustee in fiscal year 2002. The Department ignored this direction.
<p>Nevertheless, the Committee is determined to make use of this new position. Therefore, the Committee recommendation centralizes funding for prisoner movements under the Detention Trustee. Management of the Justice Prisoner and Alien Transportation System [JPATS] is precisely the sort of task that should be undertaken by the Detention Trustee. Endless disputes between JPATS `customers' are distracting managers from the complex task of operating an airline in a high security environment. As an impartial arbiter with control of program funding, the Trustee should be able to quickly resolve most of the disagreements affecting JPATS. The Trustee should also be able to rally the necessary support at the Department level to put JPATS on a sound financial footing.
<p>In addition, the Committee directs the Justice Department to centralize detention funding under the Trustee as part of the fiscal year 2003 budget request.

<p>The Committee recommends an appropriation of $46,006,000.  The recommendation is $511,000 above the budget request.
<p><em>Base restoration</em>- The erosion of base funding over time has had a negative effect on Justice Department components. Chronic budget shortfalls have led to ~~~~`hollow workyears', `rent holes', and `run to failure' replacement cycles that have undermined the efficiency and effectiveness of Federal law enforcement. The Committee is intent on putting Justice Department agencies on a sound financial footing. Therefore, the recommendation fully funds the Inspector General's true base requirements. This adjustment should be treated as a permanent increase to the base.
<p><em>INS fees</em>- In keeping with agreements made in previous years, no INS fees shall be available to the IG. The recommendation substitutes direct appropriations for fees to maintain the current level of IG audit activity.

<p>This Commission is an independent body within the Department of Justice which makes decisions regarding requests for parole and supervision of Federal prisoners.
<p>The Committee recommends an appropriation of $8,836,000. The recommendation is $2,026,000 below the budget request.
<p>The Parole Commission is scheduled to be phased out in 2002 as a result of the creation of sentencing guidelines. The Committee recommendation ensures timely close out of the Commission's operations. In particular, the District of Columbia parole caseload has been returned to the jurisdiction of the District.
<p><em>Close out process</em>- The Committee is aware that it will take at least 6 months to shut down operations at the Parole Commission. To minimize the cost and inconvenience of this process, the Commission should begin to wind down operations immediately. In particular, the Commission, in cooperation with the Justice Department, should aggressively pursue outplacing of employees to avoid layoffs when the Commission ceases operation. Also, the Commission, with the help of the General Services Administration, should begin discussions with Federal agencies willing and able to assume the Commission's lease. Finally, preparation of files for shipment to various archives should be pursued with diligence. Justice should continue to make available as many details as are necessary to support the Commission's work during this final transition period. Manpower from the legal divisions would be especially valuable in this regard. The Department is directed to report quarterly to the Committee on the resources it has lent to the Commission.

<p>The Committee expects to be consulted prior to any deviation from the above plan for fiscal year 2002. No funds are provided for the Joint Center for Strategic Environmental Enforcement.
<p><em>Courtroom technology</em>- Federal attorneys have been experimenting with portable, off-the-shelf video and computer equipment for courtroom proceedings. These attorneys found that the equipment substantially improved the presentation of evidence, as well as rapidly accelerating the pace of trials. Users found that they saved the equivalent of one trial day in every five using video and computer equipment. The Committee recommendation provides $2,612,000 for courtroom technology to be distributed among the divisions on the basis of need. The Committee expects the legal divisions to report to the Committees on Appropriations on their courtroom technology efforts not later than February 1, 2002.
<p><em>Drug labs in Federal parklands</em>- Last year, a record 452 methamphetamine labs or dumps were seized in national forests. The environmental threat posed by these labs and dumps is severe. The by-products of methamphetamine production: anhydrous ammonia, ether, sulfuric acid, and other toxins, are volatile, corrosive, and poisonous. Often, lab operators dump these materials in rivers and streams to eliminate evidence. Within available resources, the Committee recommendation provides $262,000 for prosecuting the operators of drug labs hidden in national parks and forests, including such sums as are necessary for litigation support.
<p><em>Poaching on Federal lands</em>- The theft of plant and animal species from public lands is reaching alarming proportions. Driven by everything from the landscaping needs of a booming housing market to the renewed interest in traditional medicines, poachers are despoiling parks and forests by stealing species such as barrel cactus, black bears, and sea sponges. Ironically, the very protection afforded endangered species on public lands has resulted in bigger, healthier, and more common examples of these species, making them prime targets for thieves. Within available resources, the Committee recommendation provides $525,000 for prosecuting traffickers arrested for looting plants and animals from Federal lands, including such sums as are necessary for litigation support.

<p>The Antitrust Division investigates potential violations of Federal antitrust laws, represents the interests of the United States in cases brought under these laws, acts on antitrust cases before the Supreme Court, and reviews decisions of regulatory commissions relating to antitrust law.
<p>The Committee recommendation assumes a total of $130,791,000 in budget (obligational) authority. The recommendation is $10,182,999 below the budget request. The amount provided fully funds base requirements.
<p><em>Workload</em>- The Committee is concerned that the merger frenzy gripping increasingly massive industrial combines threatens to overwhelm the ability of the Antitrust division to keep pace with complex merger proposals. The value of merger activity in the United States jumped from $959,000,000,000 in fiscal year 1997 to $1,830,000,000,000 in fiscal year 2000. Furthermore, recent market conditions will likely spark an increase in merger activity. The collapse of high technology stocks, and the resultant downward pressure on all stock prices, has created `fire sale' opportunities for cash-rich corporations to acquire undervalued companies.  The Committee recommendation includes an increase of $3,617,000 over fiscal year 2001 to  ensure the timely review of merger filings.

<p>This account supports the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys [EOUSA] and the 94 U.S. attorneys offices throughout the United States and its territories. The U.S. attorneys serve as the principal litigators for the U.S. Government for criminal and civil matters.
<p>The Committee recommends an appropriation of $1,260,353,000. The recommendation is $85,936,000 below the budget request. The Committee is aware that the U.S. Attorneys will receive $142,017,000 in reimbursements in fiscal year 2002. As in the past, Committee recommendations focus the efforts of the U.S. Attorneys on those crimes where the unique resources, expertise, or jurisdiction of the Federal Government can, or must, be most effective.
<p><em>Fundamental reform</em>- For the past several years, the Committee has attempted to fix the U.S. Attorney's resource allocation process. That process has resulted in wide disparities in caseload between districts. Assistant U.S. Attorneys [AUSAs] in the busiest districts are responsible for almost 10 times the number of criminal prosecutions and almost 14 times the number of civil prosecutions as AUSAs in the sleepiest districts. The Committee has pursued several methods to better match resources to changing patterns of crime. First, the Committee tried to influence the division of spoils process conducted by the EOUSA at the beginning of each year. Next, it suggested using term appointments for new hires to allow attorneys and support staff to be plugged in and pulled out of over-or under-worked districts as needed. Finally, the Committee directed that specific numbers of personnel be transferred to and from specific offices to better align capability with need. Exercising unusual political muscle, presidentially-appointed U.S. Attorneys were successful in defeating all of these initiatives. As a result, the disparities in caseload between districts have grown worse.
<p>The Committee is prepared to give headquarters the tools to reform the U.S. Attorneys. All previous congressional guidance to the U.S. Attorneys regarding initiatives and the designation of funds is waived. The EOUSA is free to distribute manpower and funding among the district offices for the purposes, and to the places, it feels best serve the interests of the American people. The EOUSA may coordinate with the heads of the various investigatory agencies as it sees fit. The EOUSA shall submit a report on its proposed reforms to the Committees on Appropriations not later than March 17, 2002.
<p><em>Gun Prosecutions</em>- Within available resources and manpower ceilings, the Committee recommendation includes an additional $5,000,000 over fiscal year 2001 for the existing gun prosecution initiative in Pennsylvania and $500,000 over fiscal year 2001 for the existing gun prosecution initiative in Colorado.
<p><em>Gun Surveillance Technology</em>- The Committee is aware of commercially off-the-shelf technology consisting of acoustic sensors and telecommunication networks connected to police dispatch centers allowing for the location of a gunshot to be accurately located within seconds. With this technology, dispatchers can direct officers rapidly to the precise gunshot location. The Committee recommends $6,000,000 for a pilot initiative, `Project CeaseFire', to deploy a gunshot location system in four cities: Las Vegas, NV; St. Louis, MO; Charleston, SC; and Kansas City, KS.
<p><em>Courtroom technology</em>- In a recent report to the Committee, the U.S. Attorneys extolled the virtues of their courtroom technology pilot. Using portable, off-the-shelf video and computer equipment for courtroom proceedings, the Attorneys found that the equipment substantially improved the presentation of evidence and rapidly accelerated the pace of trials. The pilot having validated the concept, the U.S. Attorneys are prepared to expand the courtroom technology program nationwide. The Committee recommendation provides $5,224,000 for courtroom technology activities, including standardization of hardware and software, training, equipment purchases, and operation of a pilot regional center. The Committee expects the U.S. Attorneys to report to the Committees on Appropriations on the distribution of these resources not later than February 1, 2002.
<p><em>Computer and Telecommunications Coordinators [CTC]</em>- Over the last 5 years, the Department established a network of prosecutors trained to investigate and prosecute high-technology crimes. Each office appointed a CTC to serve as a resident consultant on high technology issues who coordinates with other offices and is the legal consultant to agents, prosecutors, and the private sector for high technology cases. The Committee provides $297,000 for equipment ($180,000) and annual training ($117,000) for each CTC position.
<p><em>Cyber Crime and Intellectual Property Enforcement</em>- The Committee recommends $10,000,000, 100 positions, and 50 FTE, including 55 attorneys, to augment the investigation and prosecution of intellectual property crimes, including software counterfeiting crimes and crimes identified in the No Electronic Theft (NET) Act. The Committee directs the U.S. Attorneys to vigorously prosecute violations of Federal copyright law. Appropriations that are not used to fund these positions shall be used by the Computer Crimes and Intellectual Property Section to reimburse regional offices for the resources spent by regional office personnel on intellectual property investigations. The U.S. Attorneys shall report to the Committee not later than April 30, 2002 on the number of copyright law prosecutions undertaken in the preceding year, including those under Public Law 105-147, by type and location.
<p><em>Legal education</em>- Within available resources and manpower ceilings, the Committee recommendation provides $17,741,000 for legal education at the National Advocacy Center [NAC] as requested by the Administration. If merited, the NAC may expand cybercrime, cyberpiracy, and counterfeiting classes. In addition, also within available resources, the Committee recommendation provides $1,000,000 to continue the establishment of a distance learning facility at the NAC. NAC State and local training funds are provided under the Office of Justice Programs.
<p><em>Violent crime task forces</em>- Last year, the Conferees provided $1,000,000 to a violent crime task force to investigate and prosecute perpetrators of Internet sexual exploitation of children as well as to initiate an investigation into the participation of motor cycle gangs in drug running and other criminal activity. The Committee recommends an additional $1,000,000 within available resources to continue and expand this effort under the auspices of Operation Streetsweeper.

<p>The U.S. Marshals Service is made up of 94 offices with the responsibility for the apprehension of fugitives, protection of the Federal judiciary, protection of witnesses, execution of warrants and court orders, and the custody and transportation of the accused and unsentenced prisoners.
<p>The Committee recommends an appropriation of $644,746,000. The recommendation is $24,928,000 above the budget request.
<p><em>Base restoration</em>- The erosion of base funding over time has had a negative effect on Justice Department components. Chronic budget shortfalls have led to `hollow workyears', `rent holes', and `run to failure' replacement cycles that have undermined the efficiency and effectiveness of Federal law enforcement. The Committee is intent on putting Justice Department agencies on a sound financial footing. Therefore, the recommendation fully funds the Marshals Service's true mandatory and core base requirements, the latter including $1,000,000 for Special Operations Group training, equipment, and facilities maintenance.
<p>Also included in the Committee recommendation  are $1,766,000 (excluding a $230,000 transfer from the Justice Detainee Information System) to improve and maintain the Warrant Information Network and to continue subscriptions to various government and private networks and on-line services and $1,400,000 for Electronic Surveillance Unit recurring costs. The recommendation also transfers $852,000 in base resources from Human Resources to the Central Courthouse Management Group to implement the Marshals' safety and health program.
<p><em>Courthouse Security Personnel</em>- The conversion of 1811 slots to detention enforcement officer and 082 slots allows the Marshals to add to its rolls without increasing costs. The additional personnel that result from this restructuring process should cover unmet requirements on the Southwest border and at newly opening courthouses.
<p><em>Courthouse security equipment</em>- This account funds security equipment, furnishings, relocations, and telephone systems and cabling. The Committee recommendation provides $18,145,000 for courthouse security equipment. This equipment will outfit newly opening courthouses in the following locations:

<p>The Committee  expects to be consulted prior to any deviation from the above plan for fiscal year 2002.
<p><em>Fugitive apprehensions</em>- At any given moment, 25,000 to 30,000 fugitives are prowling America's streets. With nothing to lose, these fugitives are particularly prone to violent crime.  The Committee is aware that resources dedicated to fugitive apprehension are often diverted to courthouse security. Therefore, the Committee directs the Marshals to establish task forces in New York City and Los Angeles dedicated full-time to the pursuit of the most dangerous fugitives on the eastern and western seaboard. The task forces shall answer only to the Director or the Associate Director for Operations. Each team shall be made up of not less than a total of 12 supervisors, DUSMs, surveillance specialists, analysts, and support staff. To the degree possible, team members should be drawn from DUSMs serving on the Special Operations Group [SOG] as a collateral duty. The Committee recommendation includes $5,882,000 for the task forces, of which $2,497,000 is for the full year costs of 1811s and support staff on the task forces, $2,177,000 is for outfitting, training, and housing the task forces, $53,000 is for travel, and $1,155,000 is for permanent change of station moves (capped at $55,000 per move). In addition, the Committee recommendation provides an increase of $4,553,000 over the fiscal year 2002 request for electronic surveillance unit [ESU] personnel, training, and equipment, including funding for surveillance vans and light aircraft, bucket trucks, a central signal collection system, secure communications equipment, various tracking systems, and night vision equipment.
<p><em>Terrorism</em>- The World Trade Center bombing trials and a number of other high threat or special assignments have been a continuing, and unfunded, drain on the resources of the Marshals. The Committee recommendation includes an increase of $2,500,000 over fiscal year 2001 for 24 hour protection of World Trade Center bombing trial judges and for other extraordinary costs associated with these trials. In addition, the recommendation includes an increase of $3,300,000 over fiscal year 2001 for permanent change of station moves. This will reduce the number of costly temporary duty assignments required to staff high threat and special assignments and will provide the Marshals with the flexibility to transfer deputies between districts as workload dictates. As noted above, both amounts should be treated as permanent increases to the base.
<p><em>Radios</em>- The Marshals have dedicated inadequate manpower to the narrowband conversion process. At present, only one person is handling the transition from analog to digital systems. The Marshals are directed to establish a wireless group of not less than 10 communications officers that is dedicated to narrowband conversion full time and that only answers to headquarters. Members of the group shall be culled from the ranks on the basis of their radio expertise. The Committee expects regular updates on the group's progress.

<p>The Committee is aware that a recently-conducted national survey of Federal courthouses revealed that 95 percent of prisoner holding and transit facilities have serious security deficiencies. Of 392 courthouses surveyed: 84 percent lack enough courtroom holding cells; 78 percent do not have secure prison elevators; 74 percent do not have enclosed sallyports; 72 percent lack enough interview rooms; 57 percent do not have adequate cellblock space; and 38 percent lack cameras, monitors, and alarms.
<p>Years of neglect have created this deplorable situation, posing risks to the judicial family, the public, and the Marshals themselves.

<p>This account funds prisoner air transportation operations and maintenance, aircraft procurement, and facilities.
<p>The Committee recommends an appropriation of $53,050,000. The recommendation is $53,050,000 above the budget request. The funds provided will allow the Marshals to procure two modern, fuel efficient, wide body aircraft to replace two first generation airliners that have reached the end of their useful service lives. A similar approach was taken last year to address problems with the Marshals' short haul fleet. The Marshals shall report to the Committees on Appropriations on its procurement strategy not later than November 15, 2001.
<p><em>Detention Trustee.</em>--The Justice Prisoner and Alien Transportation System [JPATS] is supposed to be funded by a self-financing revolving fund. The self-financing aspects of the revolving fund are at best limited to operations and maintenance. Aircraft procurement, facilities, and prisoner ground transportation require appropriated funds, as evidenced by the direct funding of two aircraft last year. Worst of all, the use of annual reimbursements from `customers' to capitalize the revolving fund has led to endless disputes between agencies over aircraft operations, distracting managers from the complex task of operating an airline in a high security environment. Management of JPATS is precisely the sort of task that should be undertaken by the new Detention Trustee. Therefore, the Committee recommendation centralizes funding for prisoner movements under the Detention Trustee. Base funding for the Marshals Service, the Bureau of Prisons, and the Immigration and Naturalization Service has been adjusted accordingly. The Trustee shall be reimbursed by components for prisoner movements in excess of those programmed in the budget request.

<p>The Committee recommends an appropriation of $3,425,041,000. The recommendation is $80,818,000 below the budget request. The recommendation fully funds adjustments to base.
<p><em>Budget structure</em>- For the past several years, the Committee has remarked on the Justice Department's inability to respond swiftly to changing patterns of crime. In the case of the FBI, the very structure of its budget hinders the Bureau's ability to react to emerging criminal trends. Current decision units also do little to protect the Director's strategic priorities, ease management of high risk programs, or provide the transparency necessary for effective Congressional oversight. Therefore, the Committee recommendation restructures the FBI budget.
<p>The new structure focuses FBI resources on Tier 1 missions by creating three new decision units: `National Security', `Counterterrorism', and `Cyber-Investigations and Infrastructure Protection'. These activities will define the FBI in the 21st century. In particular, the proposed `Cyber-Investigations and Infrastructure Protection' decision unit, with base funding of $101,429,000, consolidates the funding of a number of mutually-supportive initiatives that had been scattered across existing decision units, such as the National Infrastructure Protection Center, including the Special Applications and Technology Unit, computer intrusion squads, Computer Analysis Response Teams, Internet fraud squads, the Internet Fraud Complaint and Intellectual Property Rights Centers, `Innocent Images', and the new Cyber Technology Section of the Engineering Research Facility.
<p>Conversely, two current decision units, `Training, Recruitment, and Applicant' and `Management and Administration', have been abolished or severely circumscribed. These decision units cross-cut all others, creating an artificial separation between these functions and the activities of which they were ultimately a part. This unduly complicated management's ability to rapidly transfer resources within and between decision units in response to changing circumstances.
<p>Similarly, the current `Organized Criminal Enterprises', `White Collar Crime', and `Violent Crime' decision units have been collapsed into one, `Criminal Enterprises and Federal Crimes', to allow the Bureau to rapidly shift resources between Tier 1, 2, and 3 priorities as circumstances warrant.
<p>Finally, `Law Enforcement Support' has been reorganized into three decision units, `Forensic, Training, and Investigative Assistance', with base funding of $318,090,000, `Investigative and Information Technology', with base funding of $247,053,000, and `Criminal Justice Services', with base funding of $212,366,000, to sharpen mission focus, improve support to the field, and maintain technical superiority.
<p>The Committee believes that the new budget structure will significantly enhance FBI performance.
<p><em>Re-engineering the workforce</em>- The FBI is steadily moving from a manpower-intensive to an information-intensive approach to crime fighting, a trend the Committee applauds. This year, for example, the FBI hopes to add 33 specialists to its rolls, including technically-trained agents and support staff and electronics engineers and technicians. Though resource and manpower constraints will force this shift in the skill sets of Bureau employees to move at an evolutionary rather than revolutionary pace, a necessarily measured approach will allow the Committee to provide the training and equipment required to support an increasingly sophisticated workforce. The FBI may convert up to 33 special agent and general support positions into the technical positions described above using attrition to affect the desired change in staff mix. In particular, the Committee recommends culling slots opened by retirements at Resident Agent offices, the least focused of the FBI's operations. The Committee recommendation includes an increase of $2,000,000 to expand and improve training for Technically Trained Agents and Electronic Technicians. The funds provided include up to 4 training personnel. This amount should be treated as a permanent increase to the base.
<p><em>Training</em>- Presently, Computer Analysis Response Team [CART] examiners participate in every aspect of cybercrime investigations, including evidence seizure,  imaging and duplication, examination and evidence review. This is a poor use of a precious asset. CART examiners, special skills are best applied to examinations, the probing of hard drives for evidence, and more complex seizures, imaging, and duplication. The Committee is aware of a training initiative that would broaden the skills and responsibilities of FBI technicians and case agents to include computer seizures, imaging and duplication, and evidence review. This training would significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of examiners, technicians, and agents. The training has the added benefit of establishing the outlines of a cybercrime career track for computer proficient agents and technicians. The Committee recommendation includes $769,000 for this initiative.
<p><em>Evidence Response Teams</em>- The Committee is aware that Evidence Response Teams [ERTs] are badly in need of basic evidence gathering supplies such as `lift kits' for fingerprinting, non-static bags for seized electronics, and special photographic equipment for documenting crime scenes. ERTs also lack the most rudimentary training aids. The Committee recommendation includes a total of $1,392,000 for ERT evidence collection and training supplies. This amount should be treated as a permanent increase to the base.
<p><em>Improving intercept capabilities</em>- The FBI is proposing a multi-pronged approach to improving intercept capabilities. Initiatives include: (1) enhancing the transmission, monitoring, and minimization of intercepted data, (2) developing broadband capabilities, and (3) procuring prototypes capable of intercepting transmissions outside of the FBI's technical reach. The Committee recommendation includes $6,800,000 to improve intercept capabilities.
<p><em>Counter-encryption</em>- The increasing sophistication and availability of encrypted software is allowing criminals to establish secure communications networks impervious to law enforcement penetration. As with interception capabilities, the FBI is proposing a multi-pronged approach to counter-encryption. Initiatives include: (1) analysis/exploitation of systems to allow access to data pre-encryption, (2) recognition/decryption of data hidden in plain sight, and (3) decryption of encrypted data. The Committee recommendation includes an increase of $7,000,000 for counter-encryption.
<p><em>Counterintelligence</em>- The FBI has been deeply traumatized by Robert Hanssen's treachery. However, Hanssen's long success as a spy seems to have had more to do with a peculiar, and hopefully unique, personality and less to do with a lack of diligence on the part of the Bureau in keeping tabs on known or suspected foreign agents. Still, the FBI is seeking to increase counterintelligence staffing by almost 200 personnel in fiscal year 2002. This request may have more to do with the natural desire to appear to be reacting to a disaster than with a sober assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the current counterintelligence program. While it is not clear what benefits will accrue from a sharp increase in manning, the Committee is prepared, for the moment, to defer to the judgement of the Bureau. Within existing resource and manpower ceilings, the FBI may transfer up to 182 special agents and support staff from `tier 3' duties to counterintelligence operations. As with the shift to technically proficient staff, the Committee recommends culling manpower from Resident Agent offices.
<p><em>Surveillance</em>- The FBI uses small planes for the discreet surveillance of individuals or locations of interest. Pilots flying in support of Washington Field Office [WFO] operations are having difficulty deconflicting their flight plans from the increasingly busy air traffic pattern around Washington due to the ceiling limitations of the aircraft currently available to the WFO. A similar problem in New York City was solved by the acquisition of aircraft capable of operating up to 10,000 feet. The Committee recommendation includes $4,000,000 for an aircraft of the same class as purchased for New York with the appropriate surveillance and communications packages.
<p><em>Jewelry and gem program</em>- The Committee is aware of the FBI's highly successful efforts through the `Criminal Enterprises and Federal Crimes'-run Jewelry and Gem Program to combat robberies of jewelry vendors, committed largely by violent gangs from South America. Major arrests have been made, several gangs have been interdicted, and the number of these serious crimes has been reduced. The Committee encourages the FBI to continue to devote the necessary resources to disrupting these criminal enterprises.
<p><em>2002 Winter Olympic Games</em>- The Committee is aware that the Secret Service has requested the assistance of the FBI in support of the Salt Lake City Olympics. The Committee recommendation includes $12,302,000 for travel, per diem, overtime, lease of vehicles, telecommunications, and utilities in support of the 2002 Games. The entire amount is to be derived from the Working Capital Fund.
<p><em>Regional computer forensic labs</em>- The Committee recommendation includes $7,202,000 under the Office of Justice Programs to maintain or establish 4 regional computer forensic labs in affiliation with the FBI Laboratory. The labs will analyze the hard drives of seized computers for evidentiary material. Affiliation with the FBI Laboratory ensures that uniform standards and procedures are maintained by all of the participating computer forensic laboratories.
<p><em>National Infrastructure Protection Center</em>- The Committee is aware that the FBI is under intense pressure from the business community to police the Internet. Yet, at the same time that businesses are demanding action, they appear to be doing little to protect themselves. The Committee notes that the National Infrastructure Protection Center [NIPC] has issued two public warnings encouraging industry to implement no- or low-cost `patches' to fix long-documented vulnerabilities in popular business software. Failure to take basic steps to ensure their own security resulted in a large number of Web sites being victimized by Russian and Eastern European hackers who stole credit card numbers as part of an extortion scheme. An FBI agent likened the computer attacks to a rash of burglaries in a neighborhood where no one locks their doors. Federal resolve and resources will be difficult to muster and sustain if the simplest precautions are left undone by private industry. The Committee also questions the motives of computer security experts whose complaints about NIPC warnings would turn a virtue into a vice.
<p><em>Internet fraud/copyright enforcement</em>- The squads responsible for Internet fraud, copyright enforcement, and other cybercrimes in the former White Collar Crime decision unit have been living on hand me downs since National Infrastructure Protection Center computer intrusion squads were spun off as a separate activity. The financial losses attributable to consumer swindles and the pirating of software are such that the proper funding of Internet fraud and copyright enforcement squads is imperative. The Committee recommendation includes $4,000,000 for computers and associated equipment for these squads. This increase should be annualized to ensure a technology refreshment cycle in keeping with industry advances.
<p>The Committee is aware that the FBI has launched an initiative to investigate violations of Federal copyright laws protecting certain marketed software applications. The Committee supports FBI efforts to vigorously pursue violations of Federal copyright law. The FBI shall report to the Committee not later than June 30, 2002 on the number of copyright law investigations that led to prosecutions in the preceding year, including those under Public Law 105-147, by type and location.
<p><em>Trilogy</em>- Trilogy is the FBI's current computer modernization program. After two false starts, a new management team was specifically recruited to save the FBI's computer modernization effort from total disaster. The result, Trilogy, appears to address cost and capability concerns raised in the past by the Committee. In particular, the Committee is pleased to note that analytical tools are being provided to agents far earlier than would have been the case in the failed ISI and eFBI proposals. The Committee recommendation includes a total of $142,390,000 for Trilogy, including $67,660,000 derived from the Working Capital Fund.
<p><em>Serial rapists</em>- The Violent Criminal Apprehension Program [ViCAP] has proven valuable in pursuing serial killers by fusing evidence across cases and jurisdictions. The Committee believes that expanding ViCAP to include sexual assault cases would greatly improve the ability of law enforcement at all levels to identify, capture, and prosecute serial rapists. Therefore, the Committee recommendation includes $1,005,000 under the Office of Justice Programs to expand ViCAP to include rape cases.
<p><em>Laboratory activation</em>- The FBI laboratory will be ready for occupation in June 2002. The new facility will allow the Lab to meet American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors [ASCLD] and International Standards Organization [ISO] 9000 quality control/quality assurance standards. Unfortunately, after investing $130,000,000 in the new building, the FBI lacks the funds to fully outfit the Lab with essential equipment. The Committee sees little sense in opening an ill-equipped facility. Therefore, the Committee recommendation includes $50,737,000 for lab activation, including $24,837,000 for critical equipment, and $11,765,000 for moving costs, fit out, and building services personnel. The remaining $14,135,000 is provided to decommission and renovate former Lab space in the Hoover building.
<p><em>Forensic research</em>- The Committee is aware that the FBI Laboratory has a long list of unfunded research projects, including proposals for new techniques to detect: (1) date rape drugs or metabolites in the bloodstream, (2) latent fingerprints left by children, and (3) gunshot residues on shooters' hands and other surfaces. The Committee recommendation includes $12,200,000 to fund the highest priority forensic research proposals submitted to the Committee on April 30, 2001. The FBI shall report back to the Committees on Appropriations on its final spending plan for these resources not later than February 1, 2002.
<p><em>Forensic audio/video program</em>- The explosion of digital audio and video recording formats has taxed the FBI's forensic capabilities to the extreme. At the same time, the FBI must maintain its capability to analyze recordings from older analog devices. The Committee recommendation includes an increase of $608,000 over fiscal year 2001 for forensic audio/video specialists and equipment. The increase should be treated as a permanent increase to the base.
<p><em>National Instant Criminal Background Check System</em>- The National Instant Criminal Background Check System [NICS] is the immediate source of information for Federal firearms licensees seeking to determine whether a given individual's purchase of a firearm would violate Federal or State law. The Committee recommendation  provides $67,735,000, the full amount required for NICS, from within available resources and manpower ceilings.
<p><em>Mitochondrial DNA.</em>--The Committee recommendation includes $4,000,000 under the Office of Justice Programs to maintain or establish 4 regional mitochondrial DNA [mtDNA]  forensic labs in affiliation with the FBI Laboratory. The labs will analyze mtDNA from human remains or other evidence to assist law enforcement in the identification of missing persons or perpetrators. Affiliation with the FBI Laboratory ensures that uniform standards and procedures are maintained by all of the participating laboratories doing  mtDNA analysis. The recommendation also includes $484,000 in this account for the biologists and other highly specialized personnel required by the lab to oversee regional mtDNA labs.
<p><em>Crimes against children</em>- The Committee recommendation includes not less than $5,204,000 to maintain the FBI's capabilities to combat child abductions and serial killings. Within this amount, at least $3,439,000 is for: (1) the child abduction and serial killer unit, (2) a police fellows program for training local investigators, and (3) training for State and local law enforcement. Additionally, at least $1,765,000 is recommended to enhance the staffing of the Violent Criminal Apprehension Program to provide more timely assistance to State and local law enforcement requesting case analysis services.
<p><em>Jurisdiction- </em>Statistics collected by Syracuse University indicate that FBI drug convictions climbed sharply--69 percent--between 1992 and 1998. In 1998, FBI drug convictions represented 25.6 percent of total Bureau convictions. Narcotics are a `tier 2' priority in the FBI's strategic plan. Also, drugs are a classic example of overlapping jurisdictions, involving the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration [DEA], and State and local police forces. The Committee is concerned that narcotics investigations are draining resources from higher priority counter-espionage and counter-terrorism missions.  Therefore, the FBI is directed to report on: (1) its role in the nation's current overall strategy for combating drug trafficking, (2) opportunities for shifting the narcotics burden to the DEA and others, and (3) priority investigative initiatives that would benefit from resources freed up by the diminishment of the Bureau's role in drug cases. The report shall be delivered not later than April 1, 2002.
<p><em>End strength</em>- The Committee notes that the fiscal year 2002 budget request imposed on the FBI includes a substantial number of `hollow' work years. The FBI has endured 2 very disruptive years attempting to reconcile its actual budget with artificial manpower levels. The Committee directs the Bureau to strike all of the hollow work years from its books to avoid another year of budget shortfalls. The FBI shall report back to the Committees on Appropriations on its adjusted end strength not later than November 1, 2001.

<p><em>Engineering Research Facility</em>- Well-heeled criminals, foreign agents, and terrorists have been quick to exploit technological innovations, complicating  Bureau investigations. The Engineering Research Facility [ERF] develops and fields cutting edge technology in support of case agents. The rapid pace of progress has necessitated an equally rapid expansion of ERF programs simply to keep current with industry advances. The resultant cramped conditions at the facility have forced employees into  leased space and is slowing critical projects due to a lack of room for new equipment. For several years, the FBI has been pursuing funds for the construction of an ERF annex. The annex would: (1) allow the FBI to consolidate far-flung cybercrime assets at the ERF, (2) accommodate planned growth, and (3) improve security by allowing programs of differing sensitivities to be physically separated. Therefore, the Committee recommendation provides $32,541,000 for planning, site preparation, design, and construction of the ERF annex. The FBI may use prior year recoveries or unobligated balances to pay for short-term leased space in order to alleviate overcrowding at the ERF until the new annex opens. In addition, the recommendation includes $10,283,000 to refurbish the existing ERF facility.

</table>
<p>The Committee recommends an appropriation of $1,489,779,000. The recommendation is $8,850,000 above the budget request.
<p>The Committee is very concerned that our efforts in the drug war, while producing periodic headlines, are not effectively ebbing the flow of a growing supply of illicit drugs into the United States. The major drug targets the DEA is able to bring to justice in the United States are quickly replaced by others who continue their criminal enterprises using increasingly sophisticated clandestine methods.
<p>There appears to be an inexhaustible number of people who are willing to take the risk of participating in the drug trade because of the enormously high monetary rewards. With that, small victories appear the best we can hope for in this war funded by U.S. taxpayers at a collective cost of over $40,000,000,000 annually.
<p>While total victory in the drug war is unattainable at this time, the Committee is aware that many DEA programs have been very effective in stopping some of the drug supply. The recommendation attempts to focus resources on activities that have been the most successful and cost effective.
<p><em>Special Operations Division [SOD]/Communications Intercept</em>- The SOD's mission is to establish strategies and operations between law enforcement agencies aimed at dismantling national and international drug trafficking organizations by attacking their communications systems. The Committee is pleased that the SOD assigned agents are actively working to coordinate and share information with other Federal law enforcement agencies. The Committee recommends: an additional three positions and $6,428,000 to fund contract and in-house language translation/transcription services; $4,382,000 for communications and data intercept equipment, and 46 support positions; and $3,196,000 associated with SOD and the field. These additional resources will directly benefit investigations targeting organizations bringing drugs into the United States through the Southwest Border from Europe, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean.
<p><em>Computer Forensics</em>- The DEA's computer forensic's capability is wholly inadequate measured against the number of computers seized by agents from criminals involved in drug related crime. The number of computers needing analysis is increasing 30 percent per year and backlogs in this area currently run from 10 to 12 work-years. To address this problem the Committee provides an additional $1,700,000 (20 FTE's). This funding should be used to hire computer forensic examiners and purchase related equipment for the Office of Investigative Technology.
<p><em>Computer Training</em>- The Committee commends the DEA for working cooperatively with other Justice components and providing needed computer and computer forensic training at the DEA Office of Investigative Technology.
<p><em>Joint Automated Booking System [JABS]</em>- The Committee supports the leadership role DEA has taken with the JABS program. When fully operational the Committee believes that JABS will be a tremendous resource to all Federal law enforcement agencies. The Committee encourages DEA to continue to work with the other Justice and non-justice law enforcement agencies to train individuals on its use and to facilitate its expansion.
<p><em>Methamphetamine Initiative</em>- The recommendation includes $32,854,000, a $5,395,000 increase over fiscal year 2001, to continue DEA's efforts of targeting and investigating methamphetamine trafficking, production, and abuse across the United States. The funding will allow DEA to continue investigations and stop methamphetamine traffickers; maintain the national clandestine laboratory data base; reduce the availability of precursor chemicals being diverted to clandestine laboratories in the United States and abroad; clean-up the hazardous waste generated by seized clandestine laboratories; and coordinate with the agency's Special Operation's Division. The Committee directs DEA to submit quarterly spending reports on methamphetamine initiatives to the Committees on Appropriations beginning January 1, 2002.
<p>The Committee notes that $20,000,000 is provided through the COPS Methamphetamine/Drug `Hot Spots' Program to reimburse the DEA for the costs associated with assisting State and local law enforcement remove and dispose of the hazardous materials at clandestine methamphetamine labs.
<p><em>Heroin Enforcement Operations.</em>--In hearings before the Committee, the DEA Administrator testified in detail about the flood of heroin entering the country as close to the Capitol as the Port of Baltimore. The re-emergence of the use of heroin by teenagers parallels the dramatic increase in the purity of heroin at very low prices. To address this challenge, the Committee encourages DEA to continue its heroin enforcement efforts within available resources and staffing levels.
<p><em>Oxycontin</em> and MDMA- Two drugs that have recently emerged as a growing concern to the Committee are Oxycontin and 3, 4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine [MDMA]. Oxycontin, a legally-prescribed controlled substance, is being diverted from the legal market into illegal use. MDMA, a drug with no legally-authorized use, is fast becoming a drug of choice at rave parties and other youth venues. Both drugs have managed to avoid much of the stigma that they deserve, and too many young people are under the false impression that these drugs may be used without harmful effects. The Committee strongly supports DEA's efforts to control the illegal diversion of Oxycontin, and to dismantle the organizations that import and distribute MDMA to the nation's young people.
<p><em>Regional Drug Enforcement Teams [RET]</em>- The Committee recommends a total of $19,100,000 for DEA RET teams. RET team deployments have proven to be very successful at dismantling drug trafficking organizations in targeted areas at a very low cost per operation. RET teams are currently stationed in selected regions in the United States and have been given the flexibility to deploy agent resources and assets to meet emerging drug trends, specifically in our Nation's smaller cities. The teams direct their efforts toward combating specific drug problems as identified by intelligence sources and leads provided by DEA's Special Operations Division.
<p><em>Mobile Enforcement Teams [MET]</em>- The Committee recommends $9,200,000 to continue the DEA MET team program. MET teams operate in communities at the request of local officials and since 1995 have targeted and dismantled drug trafficking organizations across the United States. The Committee believes that the DEA should increasingly focus personnel and resources on operations which target drug related crime and drug trafficking organizations within the United States.
<p><em>Firebird/Merlin</em>- An additional $30,000,000 and three positions is provided for the deployment, network security, and the technology renewal of DEA's Firebird computer system. The recommendation includes a total of $2,500,000 for Firebird Deployment, and $1,900,000 for network security. Finally, for technology renewal $25,600,000 and  three positions is provided to modernize and replace systems and system components as they become obsolete. With this funding, Firebird will be fully deployed and Firebird will provide all DEA domestic and international offices with an integrated information sharing and communications computer network.
<p><em>Laboratory Operations</em>- Timely and effective laboratory support is critical to law enforcement. DEA's laboratory program is currently suffering from a backlog of evidence where processing time averages almost 50 days, potentially jeopardizing the investigation and prosecution of critical drug cases. To address this backlog, the Committee recommendation provides an increase of $13,104,000 over fiscal year 2001 for DEA laboratory operations, to manage the agency's increased laboratory workload, address deficient areas in the agency's laboratory system, and to institute a 5-year laboratory equipment replacement cycle.
<p><em>Sensitive Investigative Units [SIU]</em>- The Committee recommends a total of $20,000,000 for the SIU program. The Committee is encouraged by the successes of the SIU program in participating countries. Last year, the Committee noted concerns that the endemic corruption within the Mexican Government would make the implementation of the SIU program there unattainable. The Committee is encouraged by recent changes brought on by Mexico's new President, Vicente Fox, who has pledged to combat drug traffickers and end corruption within the Mexican Government. The Committee therefore recommends DEA deploy its SIU's in Mexico as planned. The DEA is reminded that the Committees on Appropriations are to be notified before this program is expanded to include additional countries.
<p><em>Helicopters and other equipment</em>- The committee recommendation includes $5,250,000 for three single engine light enforcement helicopters to be stationed in Seattle, WA, Chicago, IL, and St. Louis, MO, and $5,000,000 for one twin engine medium lift helicopter to meet the needs of enforcement efforts in Hawaii. In addition, the DEA shall provide $500,000 to equip and maintain the Federal gun range in Rocky Flats, Colorado for use by Federal, State, and local law enforcement.
<p><em>Management and Administration</em>- The Committee is encouraged by changes made in the personnel and authority of DEA's Financial Management Division. DEA's expertise in financial management has improved drastically, as demonstrated through the quality and timeliness of budget justifications, follow-up information, and the ability of DEA financial managers to provide detailed accounting of reprogramming actions and other basic financial information.
<p><em>`Drug Diversion Control Fee' Account</em>- The Committee has provided $86,021,000 for DEA's Drug Diversion Control Program. This is the full amount requested, and assumes that the level of balances in the Fee Account are sufficient to fully support diversion control programs in fiscal year 2002. As was the case in fiscal year 2001, no funds are provided in the DEA `Salaries and expenses' appropriation for the `Diversion control fee account' in fiscal year 2002.
<p><em>End strength</em>- The Committee notes that the fiscal year 2002 budget request includes a substantial number of `hollow' work years. The Committee is disappointed that the DEA forwent two opportunities to correct this problem during the development of the fiscal year 2002 budget submission in the hopes that additional funds might miraculously be made available. No such funds have been, or will be, made available. The Committee directs the DEA to strike all of the hollow work years from its books to avoid another year of budget shortfalls. The DEA shall report back to the Committees on Appropriations on its adjusted work years not later than November 1, 2001.

<p>The Committee recommends an appropriation of $3,176,037,000. The recommendation is $211,964,000 below the budget request.
<p><em>Land border inspectors</em>- Long lines and the most cursory of inspections describe the current situation at land border ports of entry [POEs]. The reason for this is that for years all available resources have been diverted to the Border Patrol to increase the number of agents deployed. The result is that from fiscal year 1997 to 2001 the number of Border Patrol agents increased 40 percent from 6,828 to 9,545. At the same time, the number of land border inspectors decreased slightly from 1,770 to 1,767. Today, of 104 POEs, 85, or 82 percent, are manned at 50 percent or less of workload requirements. The most understaffed, Beebe Plain, VT, is manned at 10 percent of requirements. The following chart highlights current staff shortfalls:

<pre>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</pre>
<p>Trade and tourism are suffering on both borders as a result of inadequate staffing at land POEs. The handful of inspectors the Committee was able to fund last year will have no appreciable effect on current shortfalls. Therefore, the Committee recommendation includes $25,408,000 for 348 land border inspectors to begin the long process of aligning manning with workload requirements. New inspectors shall be deployed to the most understaffed POEs.
<p><em>Border control</em>- As a recent INS report makes clear, overcrowding at Border Patrol facilities on the Southwest border has reached crisis proportions. Of 85 outposts across 9 sectors, 63 are overcrowded. The worst, a station in Mercedes, Texas, was designed for 13 agents but currently houses 142, almost 1,100 percent its rated capacity.

<pre>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</pre>
<p>This situation will only worsen as new Border Patrol agents funded in fiscal year 2001 arrive at their duty stations on the Southwest border. From San Diego to Brownsville, detention, processing, interview, and evidence and equipment storage space fall far short of requirements. The risks to the safety of agents are stark,  and appalling work conditions exacerbate the Border Patrol's soaring attrition rate. The Committee recommendation addresses this problem in the INS `Construction' account.
<p>In addition, the Committee recommendation provides $75,000,000 for 570 new Border Patrol agents.
<p><em>Border Patrol equipment</em>- The effectiveness of the Border Patrol has been threatened by crippling shortfalls in basic equipment inventories. More importantly, agent safety has been at risk. The chart below summarizes the current situation after several years of Committee intervention to ensure that Border Patrol agents are properly equipped:

<pre>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</pre>
<p>To preserve the benefits of several years of massive investments to expand the Border Patrol, the Committee recommendation provides a total of $22,598,000 for high priority equipment, including $1,020,000 for fiber optic scopes, $799,000 for hand-held searchlights, $708,000 for vehicle infrared scopes, $2,091,000 for Global Positioning Systems, $9,120,000 for infrared scopes, $2,606,000 for night vision goggles, and $6,254,000 for pocket scopes.
<p><em>Integrated Surveillance Intelligence System [ISIS]</em>- In its haste to deploy ISIS, the INS has failed to develop the body of system engineering documentation associated with the development, procurement, and operation of new equipment. Lacking such documentation, such basic questions as system performance versus requirements and lifecycle costs versus outyear budgets remain unanswered. Prior to further expansion of the program, the Committee directs the INS to ensure that documents addressing customer requirements and system functionality, design, test, performance, and cost are completed and available for review. The Committee recommendation includes $4,000,000 to fully fund the system engineering process for ISIS.
<p>The Committee recommendation also includes the following:
<p> --$14,000,000 for Law Enforcement Support Center [LESC]; and
<p> --Full funding for the first year of the INS vehicle replacement master plan.
<p><em>IDENT/IAFIS</em>- Shortcomings in the INS' Automated Biometric Identification System [`IDENT'] database were blamed for the release of suspected serial killer Rafael Resendez Ramirez. In the wake of Resendez Ramirez's later surrender, Justice Management Division [JMD] took over development and integration of IDENT and the FBI's Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System [IAFIS]. That effort has been expanded to integrate the INS' Enforcement Case Tracking System [`ENFORCE'] with IDENT/IAFIS. Within existing automation base funding, the Committee recommendation includes $27,000,000 for continued development and piloting of IDENT/IAFIS by Justice Management Division [JMD]. The JMD is directed to provide the Committees on Appropriations with an automation spending plan not later than November 15, 2001.
<p><em>Pacific Northwest</em>- There are currently 300 Border Patrol Agents assigned to patrol the entire 4,000 miles of the northern border. In contrast, the Southwest border has nearly 8,000 agents for 2,000 miles. This is four agents for every mile in the south compared to one agent for every 13 miles in the north. Consequently, agents on the northern border are fourteen times more likely to encounter aliens involved with smuggling weapons and nine times more likely to encounter aliens involved with smuggling drugs when compared to agents along the Southwest border. Furthermore, the lack of INS inspectors at the northern border is directly attributable to the greatly increased congestion seen at many border crossings.  Therefore, of the 570 additional Border Patrol agents, not less than 25 percent of those new agents shall be deployed to the northern border. Inspection staff at the northern border must also be increased substantially.   Selections for the northern tier shall be by the competitive transfer of experienced agents by means of the existing merit promotion and reassignment system.
<p><em>Quick Response Teams</em>- The Committee is aware that the initial deployment of Quick Response Teams [QRTs] has taken far longer than anticipated, and that costs have greatly exceeded preliminary estimates. Until the program has stablized, and its true costs and benefits are known, the Committee will not entertain requests for the expansion of QRTs outside of the initial deployment area.
<p><em>Legal Orientation Programs.</em>--The Committee recommends $2,800,000 for non-governmental agencies to provide `live presentations' to persons in INS detention prior to their first hearing before an immigration judge. These presentations will provide immigration detainees with essential information about immigration court procedures and the availability of legal remedies to assist detainees in distinguishing between meritorious cases and frivolous cases.
<p><em>Alternatives to Detention.</em>--The Committee recommends $7,300,000 for community-based organizations to screen asylum seekers and other INS detainees for community ties, provide them with necessary services, and help to assure their appearance at court hearings.
<p><em>Benefits</em>- Trend analysis of the most recent benefits processing data from the INS indicates that steady progress continues to be made in eliminating the backlog sparked by the `Citizenship USA' debacle. Since its peak in fiscal year 1998, the backlog of pending naturalization (N-400) applications has dropped 68 percent in the last 2 fiscal years. During the same period, processing times dropped from more than 45 months to just under 7 months. Even greater progress is expected this year. These improvements have not come cheaply, however. During the last 5 years, the Committee has provided $4,169,400,000 for benefits processing. Manpower increased by 1,196 between fiscal years 1997 and 2000 with more to come in fiscal year 2001. Hopefully, the tide has turned and benefits processing performance measures will return to historical norms, but continued pressure to expand the number of potential beneficiaries and the scope of potential benefits could erase these gains.
<p>Conversely, no area of operations will be more severely disrupted by the imminent reorganization of the INS than benefits processing. Just in the last few months, the INS has had to deal with the revamping of the H-1B program and the continuing extension of Temporary Protected Status to El Salvadorans, Hondurans, and Nicaraguans. This turmoil has typified immigration policy for many years. Now, an organization ruled by a bewildering set of laws, regulations, and decrees and known for poor service and endless backlogs will be spun off and established as a separate agency. The resultant confusion might be more tolerable were it not for the fact that ultimate control of the new immigration benefits service will be retained by Justice, an agency with little experience or expertise in providing benefits. Rather than contribute to the coming chaos by pouring additional new employees into the mix, the Committee recommendation is limited to fully funding current services. The Committee will be closely monitoring monthly benefits processing reports to ensure that current standards are met or exceeded after the reorganization.
<p><em>Staffing levels</em>- The INS has failed to provide a required assessment of staffing needs nationwide. The Committee has no recourse but to direct the reallocation of staff to offices where caseload merits personnel increases.  The INS is directed to provide an increase of $118,750 over fiscal year 2001 to the district office in Omaha, NE, to upgrade Nashville, TN, to a full service office, and to upgrade its presence in Las Vegas, NV to a district office not later than June 15, 2002. Finally, of the total amount provided for naturalization and other benefits, such sums as are necessary shall be made available to open a 1-man office in Roanoke, VA.
<p>In addition, the recommendation includes a total of $4,506,000 for the Debt Management Center [DMC].
<p><em>End strength</em>- The Committee notes that the fiscal year 2002 budget request includes a substantial number of `hollow' work years. The INS has endured several very disruptive years attempting to reconcile its actual budget with artificial levels of work years. The Committee directs the INS to strike all of the hollow work years from its books to avoid another year of budget shortfalls. The INS shall report back to the Committees on Appropriations on its adjusted work years not later than November 1, 2001.
<p><em>Fees</em>- The recommendation transfers a total of $147,602,000 in base activities, including  data processing, legal proceedings, detention and deportation, and information and records management, from this account to the `User Fee', `Examinations Fee', and `Breached Bond/Detention Fund' accounts. This transfer better aligns available resources with actual activities and is allowable under the statutory authorities for each of these accounts.
<p><h2>OFFSETTING FEE COLLECTIONS</h2>
<p>Fees are paid by persons who are either traveling internationally or are applying for immigration benefits. The Committee recommends a total spending level of $2,058,723,000. The recommendation is $64,782,000 above the budget request. The Committee has included language expanding the inspection fee pilot program at land border ports of entry [POEs]. Proceeds will contribute to buying down the almost $1,000,000,000 construction backlog at these POEs. The Committee recommendations, by major account, are provided below:
<p><h2>IMMIGRATION USER FEE</h2>
<p>The Committee recommends a spending level of $656,648,000. This is the full amount of receipts estimated to be available and fully funds base requirements. The recommendation is $64,782,000 above the budget request.
<p>The Committee recommendation provides an increase of $67,500,000 over fiscal year 2001 for additional inspectors and support staff, including those associated with detention and removals and legal proceedings, and for airline carrier training.
<p><em>Inspection technology</em>- The Committee is aware of commercial off-the-shelf technology that could significantly improve the inspection process. Document and biometric scanners linked to computers could sharply reduce both waiting times and fraudulent entries as well as allowing inspectors to focus on problem cases. The recommendation provides a total increase of $40,500,000 to implement a thorough modernization of inspection technology and to upgrade the National Automated Information Lockout System ($3,200,000) and to procure additional live scan fingerprint devices ($425,000).
<p><em>Inspection processing</em>- As noted above, the recommendation transfers $33,273,000 in data processing, legal proceedings, detention, and information and records management base activities from `Salaries and Expenses' to this account. User fees may be used for inspection processing expenses.
<p><h2>IMMIGRATION EXAMINATIONS FEE</h2>
<p>The Committee recommends a spending level of $1,258,088,000. This is the full amount of receipts estimated to be available. The recommendation is identical to the budget request.
<p><em>Benefits Processing</em>- As mentioned above, the turmoil engendered by recent legislation and policy decisions threatens the steady progress the INS has been making in reducing the naturalization backlog. The Committee recommendation provides an increase of $67,095,000 over fiscal year 2001 to accelerate the pace of efforts to reduce the time required to adjudicate immigration benefit applications.
<p><em>Transfer to Executive Office for Immigration Review [EOIR]</em>- The recommendation assumes that $127,834,000 from this account will be made available for EOIR operations, including $1,200,000 for contract court interpreter services for immigration court proceedings. Exam fees may be used for expenses in providing immigration adjudication.
<p><em>Benefits processing</em>- As noted above, the recommendation transfers $74,329,000 in data processing, legal proceedings, and information and records management base activities from `Salaries and Expenses' to this account. Exam fees may be used for immigration adjudication expenses.
<p><h2>BREACHED BOND/DETENTION FUND</h2>
<p>The Committee recommends a spending level of $120,763,000. This is the full amount of receipts estimated to be available to support detention of criminal and illegal aliens. The recommendation is identical to the budget request.
<p><em>Detention expenses</em>- As noted above, the recommendation transfers $40,000,000 in detention and deportation base activities  from `Salaries and Expenses' to this account. Breached bond/detention funds may be used for expenses associated with the detention and deportation of illegal aliens.

<p>The Committee recommends an appropriation of $205,015,000. The recommendation is $76,605,000 above the budget request.
<p>The Committee is concerned by the lack, or condition, of facilities INS-wide, described as the `worst' in the Federal Government in a recent assessment. The backlog of projects has reached unacceptable levels, and is growing larger with each passing year. For the Border Patrol alone, the shortfall in adequate facilities now exceeds 63 percent of requirements. Use of trailers or temporary or makeshift facilities is common, and even these expedients leave many new agents without a place to process arrestees. Not surprisingly, the result is agent attrition rates that are high and climbing. The funding proposed is intended to begin the long process of eliminating construction and maintenance backlogs.

<p><em>Activation of new prisons</em>- The Committee recommendation includes funding for activation of two new facilities (2,240 beds): a medium security facility in Petersburg, Virginia and a high security in Lee County, Virginia. The Committee also recommends the purchase of equipment for FCI Glenville, West Virginia and USP Canaan, Pennsylvania which are preparing for activation.

<p>The Committee recommendation includes funding for: 1,500 beds for short-term criminal aliens to be housed in contract facilities; and a contract population increase of 1,449 beds.
<p>The Committee supports the base funding adjustment of $71,991,000 for 6,000 beds for short term criminal aliens.
<p><em>Justice Prisoner and Alien Transportation System</em>- The Committee recommends a reduction of $8,266,000 for centralization of prisoner air movements under the Detention Trustee, in lieu of reimbursement.
<p><em>Internship Pilot</em>- The Committee recommendation continues to provide funding of up to $100,000 for  of a pilot program that offers temporary internship positions for college students at the Federal Correctional Institution in Yazoo City, Mississippi, to provide the students work experience in a law enforcement setting and a heightened interest in a career with the Federal Bureau of Prisons.
<p><em>Female inmates.</em>--Of the amounts provided, up to $1,000,000 shall be for the National Institute of Corrections to continue to work with correctional systems (State and Federal) to address the issue of staff sexual misconduct involving female inmates in correctional institutions through the provision of technical assistance, education and training, and other monitoring activities pursuant to the recommendations of the General Accounting Office.
<p><em>Yazoo City, MS</em>- The Committee directs the Bureau to continue assessing the feasibility and anticipated need for the construction of a high security prison facility in Yazoo City, MS.
<p><em>Transfer of District of Columbia Sentenced Felons</em>- The Committee recognizes the herculean efforts of the Bureau of Prisons to meet requirements of the DC Revitalization Act and transfer of DC felons into custody by December 31, 2001. The Bureau of Prisons, in cooperation with other agencies, has already transferred over half of the population and is currently accepting the remaining medium and high security inmates. To date, the Committee has provided $850,000,000 for construction of new facilities to absorb this population. One will be fully activated in 2001, one in 2002, and the remaining five facilities in 2003 and 2004. The timely and safe transition of inmates into the Federal system will afford appropriate inmate education and vocational programs, close supervision and closure of the troubled Lorton facilities.
<p>The Committee also recommends bill language, similar to that included in previous Appropriations Acts, which allows: (1) for the purchase of motor vehicles for police-type use and the purchase of uniforms; (2) for the provision of technical advice to foreign governments; (3) for transfer of funds to the Health Resources and Services Administration; (4) for the Director to enter into contracts to furnish health care; (5) up to $6,000 for reception and representation expenses; (6) up to $50,000,000  for necessary prison operations to remain available until September 30, 2003; (7) up to $20,000,000 for contract confinement expenses for the care and security of Cuban and Haitian entrants; and (8) for continuation of the donated greeting card program.

<p>The Committee recommends a total of $899,797,000 for fiscal year 2002 for the construction, modernization, maintenance, and repair of prison and detention facilities housing Federal prisoners. This amount is $66,524,000 above the  budget request.
<p>The Committee continues to strongly support the BOP's construction program, designed to provide sufficient inmate beds to manage overcrowding in facilities and maintain them in a safe and secure manner for staff, inmates and surrounding communities. The Committee understands that the BOP needs the 11 facilities requested in the 2002 budget and even with these facilities, overcrowding is projected to be 32 percent in 2006. Thus, the Committee is providing $669,972,000 for the new construction program. Further, the Committee directs the BOP to request the funds necessary to complete these facilities in the 2003 budget. The funding provided for facilities includes:

<p>The Committee commends the BOP for working diligently to increase inmate housing capacity by expanding existing facilities within available funds. The Committee fully supports these cost effective efforts and expects the BOP to continue its reprogrammings and funds transfer requests in a timely manner to expedite these construction projects.
<p><em>Inmate Telephone Use.</em>--The Committee notes the Bureau of Prison's recent changes in policy limiting inmate telephone use. The Committee expects that these changes will further reduce potential inmate abuse of telephone privileges while continuing to allow positive contact with family members.
<p>The Committee recommends bill language, similar to that included in previous Appropriation Acts, which allows: (1) for planning of facilities, acquisition of sites, and construction of facilities; (2) for acquisition, remodeling, and equipping facilities by contract or force account; (3) for up to $14,000,000 to construct inmate work areas; (4) for use of prison labor; and (5) for up to 10 percent of this appropriation to be transferred to the `Salaries and expenses' account in accordance with section 605.

<p>The Committee continues to strongly support Federal Prison Industries [UNICOR] and recognizes its importance in the efficient and safe management of Federal prisons. UNICOR provides prison inmates with the opportunity to learn important work habits, participate in meaningful employment which keeps them productively occupied during work hours, and develop improved job skills which reduce recidivism. The Committee also recognizes the necessity for UNICOR to grow as the inmate population increases. Finally, UNICOR is a self-supporting revolving fund the resources of which are derived from sales of its products. In the future, the BOP is directed to submit only UNICOR's appropriations language exhibit.

<p><em>National Institute of Justice (NIJ)</em>- The Committee recommends an appropriation of $54,879,000. The recommendation is equal to the budget request. In addition, $19,956,000 will be provided to NIJ in fiscal year 2002, as was provided in fiscal year 2001, from the local law enforcement block grant for assisting local units to identify, select, develop, modernize, and purchase new technologies for use by law enforcement. NIJ is the Nation's primary source of research and development in the field of criminal justice. Within total funding for the NIJ, the Committee directs that increased amounts over fiscal year 2001 be made available for computerized identification systems and the DNA Technology Research and Development Program.
<p>The Committee is very concerned about the administration of some NIJ grants. Grant administrators are to work with grantees in a cooperative but supervisory manner. NIJ is directed to re-familiarize its grant administrators with the requirements of their positions. In addition, NIJ is directed to ensure that grant recipients are in complete compliance with the agreements they sign.
<p><em>Defense/law enforcement technology transfer</em>- Within the amounts provided for NIJ, $12,277,000 is provided for NIJ management and operation of this program to support joint efforts by the Justice Department and the Department of Defense to adapt defense technologies to law enforcement use, to field prototype systems for evaluation, to develop standards and test products, and to develop technologies that will minimize the risk of death or injury to law enforcers, corrections officers, and citizens.
<p>In addition to the above activities, within the amounts provided, NIJ is to provide grants for the following projects:
<p> --$500,000 for a grant for Lane County, Oregon Breaking the Cycle;
<p> --$800,000 for the Richmond, Virginia Secures Program;
<p><em>Drug Detection</em>- The Committee is pleased with the progress the NIJ has made in the evaluation of a non-toxic and non-carcinogenic reagent-based detection and identification aerosol designed to detect trace amounts of illegal drugs in school environments. Based on this progress the Committee directs that from within the amounts provided to NIJ, $450,000 shall be made available for an expanded evaluation of the aerosol's application in educational environments, a second independent evaluation assessing the technology, and the exploration of new methods of applying the aerosol detection technology in the criminal justice system.
<p> --$2,145,000 to the University of Connecticut to fund research on non-traditional DNA typing to improve law enforcement investigation techniques;
<p> --$3,000,000 to the University of Connecticut to fund the Prison Health Research Project; and
<p> --$1,500,000 for the Less Than Lethal Technology for Law Enforcement program.
<p><em>Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS)</em>- The Committee recommends an appropriation of $32,335,000. The recommendation is equal to the budget request. The BJS is responsible for the collection, analysis, and publication of statistical information on crime, criminal offenders, victims of crime, and the operations of the Nation's justice systems.
<p><em>Office of Victims of Crime</em>- The Committee urges the Office of Victims of Crime (OVC) to continue its Victim Assistance to Indian Country (VAIC), and Children's Justice Act (CJA) programs. The VAIC and CJA programs have been critical in ensuring that resources are available to help victims of crime in under-served tribal areas and to prosecute offenders in child abuse and neglect cases.
<p><em>Missing children</em>- The Committee recommendation provides $22,997,000 for the Missing Children Program to combat crimes against children, particularly kidnaping and sexual exploitation.
<p>Within the amounts provided the Committee has included:
<p>(1) $9,277,544 for the Missing Children Program within the Office of Justice Programs, Justice Assistance, including the following: $5,986,800 for State and local law enforcement to continue specialized cyberunits and for units to investigate and prevent child sexual exploitation which are based on the protocols for conducting investigations involving the Internet and online service providers that have been established by the Department of Justice and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.
<p>(2) $11,450,000 for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children [NCMEC], of which $2,245,050 is provided for the operation of the CyberTipline and the Exploited Child Unit. The Committee expects the NCMEC to continue to consult with participating law enforcement agencies to ensure the curriculum, training, and programs provided are consistent with the protocols for conducting investigations involving the Internet and online service providers that have been established by the Department of Justice. The CyberTipline was created by this Committee in the fiscal year 1999 appropriation for the Center. In addition, the Committee recommends that NCMEC consult with I-Safe America to provide Internet Safety Training in grades K-12 nationwide.
<p>(3) $2,700,000 for the Jimmy Ryce Law Enforcement Training Center for training of State and local law enforcement officials investigating missing and exploited children cases.
<p><em>Regional Information Sharing System (RISS)</em>- The Committee recommends an appropriation of $38,500,000. The recommendation is equal to the budget request. The RISS program provides funds to maintain six regionally-based information sharing centers which allow for information and intelligence services to be disseminated nationwide addressing major, multi-jurisdictional crimes.
<p><em>Domestic Preparedness Assistance to State and Local Jurisdictions</em>- The Committee supports the work of the Office for State and Local Domestic Preparedness Support (OSLDPS) the mission of which is to enhance the capabilities of State and local jurisdictions to better prepare for and respond to incidents of domestic terrorism involving weapons of mass destruction. OSLDPS' activities include training and educational instruction, specialized equipment grants, technical assistance, and support for situational exercises.  OSLDPS provides assistance in these areas to States and localities and their emergency response agencies. OSLDPS' successful stewardship of the critical TOPOFF exercise program last year prompted this Committee, as well as the exercise's participants, to request a second national exercise, TOPOFF II. The Committee commends OSLDPS on its  efforts to work with the States and the District of Columbia to develop individual comprehensive plans and strategies that assess the threats and risks they face and identify their requirements in the areas of equipment, training, exercises, and technical assistance.  The linkage of equipment grants to States' completion of their plans has provided States with the incentive to move forward quickly with this important process. These plans will provide critical guidance to Federal agencies and the Congress on States' and localities' resource requirements.
<p>For the continuation of the programs and activities of OSLDPS, a total of $364,000,000 is recommended, of which $8,000,000 may be used for associated management and administrative expenses, including support for up to 63 full time equivalent (FTE) positions. This level of support is necessary due to the requirement that OSLDPS work directly with the States and the District of Columbia to respond to the needs identified in the comprehensive plans they are currently  developing, and to coordinate a comprehensive exercise program.
<p><em>National Domestic Preparedness Consortium</em>- A total of $58,000,000 is recommended for the continued training efforts under OSLDPS' National Domestic Preparedness Consortium. This funding will enable OSLDPS to address the requirements as determined by the Statewide Domestic Preparedness Strategic Plans. Of the $58,000,000 recommended, funds shall be allocated among the Consortium's members as follows: (1) $7,000,000 to the Texas Engineering Extension Service of the Texas A&M University, (2) $7,000,000 to the Energetic Materials Research and Test Center of the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, (3) $7,000,000 to the Academy of Counterterrorist Education at the Louisiana State University, (4) $7,000,000 to the U.S. Department of Energy's National Exercise, Test, and Training Center, Nevada Test Site, and (5) $30,000,000 for OSLDPS' Center For Domestic Preparedness at Ft. McClellan, AL.
<p>Exercises are a critical element in preparing State and local public safety personnel to respond to incidents of domestic terrorism involving weapons of mass destruction (WMD). The Committee supports the work of the Center for Exercise Excellence at the Department of Energy's Nevada Test Site (NTS).  NTS trains jurisdictions in the planning and conduct of exercises, tailored to the unique threats they face as determined by the Statewide Domestic Preparedness Strategic Plans. The Center represents a component of OSLDPS' overall training program by meeting special exercise needs as defined by the States themselves.
<p><em>Domestic Preparedness Equipment Grants.</em>--A total of $175,000,000 is provided for equipment block grants to the States and District of Columbia to enable these jurisdictions to purchase specialized equipment required to respond to terrorist incidents involving chemical, biological, radiological, and explosive weapons. The availability of the necessary protective equipment, detection technology, decontamination equipment, and specialized communications equipment for the first response personnel in our cities and towns is a critical priority. Domestic Preparedness Equipment Grants will allow States and localities to acquire state-of-the-art equipment as investments in technology development bring new and improved technologies to the market. With the guidance of OSLDPS, States are expected to plan strategically in order to meet their equipment needs, taking into account the necessity of the equipment but also their ability to maintain and operate it correctly and safely. As in the past, States are required to complete their Statewide Domestic Preparedness Strategic Plans before they are eligible for these grants. States receiving domestic preparedness equipment grant funds are expected to disperse those funds based on the comprehensive plans currently being developed. OSLDPS is directed to review the States' decisions regarding the disbursement of grant funds to ensure that communities with the greatest need receive priority.
<p><em>Equipment Standards</em>- Within funds available for equipment grants, $17,000,000 is recommended for OSLDPS to oversee the development of standards for equipment for responding to terrorist incidents involving weapons of mass destruction. This effort shall take place under the direction of the DAG-CT and should include equipment testing and certification. In developing these standards, OSLDPS shall work closely with the Dartmouth Institute for Security Technology Studies (ISTS) and the Oklahoma City National Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism (MIPT). The Committee recognizes the important role that ISTS and MIPT play in this critical area. OSLDPS is also directed to consult with first responders, manufacturers, the Interagency Board (IAB) for Equipment Standardization and Interoperability, the Technical Support Working Group, the National Institute of Justice, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) as necessary.
<p>Of those funds available for Domestic Preparedness Equipment Grants, up to $5,000,000 shall be made available for the continued support of the Domestic Preparedness Equipment Technical Assistance Program--a partnership between OSLDPS and the Pine Bluff Arsenal. This program provides jurisdictions with training and technical assistance on the use, maintenance, repair, and calibration of equipment acquired under the Equipment Grant Program.  Also of the funds available for the Domestic Preparedness Equipment Grants, $8,000,000 shall be made available to the States, Territories, and the District of Columbia to support their activities related to the implementation of the State Equipment Grants Program and to develop an annual update of the status of the plan implementation.
<p>The Committee believes that it is critical that the medical community be fully engaged in this nation's domestic preparedness efforts. Public health sector professionals do not typically receive training in the medical aspects of disaster management and medical incident command. These are two areas of major importance in dealing with an attack involving weapons of mass destruction, particularly biological. Efforts in this area have, until now, been largely pro-bono. The Committee therefore provides $2,000,000 for the Virtual Medical Campus which will provide education, training, and certification for medical professionals for disaster-related events and facilitate the coordination of Federal, State, and local planners and decision makers for disaster event management.
<p><em>State and Local Domestic Preparedness Exercise Grant Program</em>- Situational exercises play a critical role in our efforts to better prepare State and local jurisdictions and their emergency response agencies to respond to incidents of domestic terrorism. Such exercises provide participants an opportunity to test their training and response plans, integrate their response constraints, and to extract valuable lessons for future action. A total of $12,000,000 is provided to enable OSLDPS to provide grants to State and local jurisdictions for the planning and conduct of  exercises to enhance their response capabilities and to test their response constructs. Grants will only be provided to States with an approved Statewide Strategic Domestic Preparedness Plan. Priority will be given to those jurisdictions identified by the States' plans as most in need of an exercise.  Based on lessons learned from TOPOFF and the development of the Domestic Preparedness Strategic Plans and the integration of the Nunn-Lugar-Domenici Domestic Preparedness Program, OSLDPS requires a more robust exercise program. OSLDPS must be able to plan and conduct a variety of exercise types, from tabletop to full scale exercises, to meet the unique requirements of State and local jurisdictions. As States complete their Domestic Preparedness Strategic Plans, they will expect OSLDPS to assist them in addressing the exercise needs identified by them. The Committee recommends a total of $8,000,000 for OSLDPS for enhanced exercise support. The purpose of these funds is to support the planning and conduct of exercises at the State and local level.
<p><em>TOPOFF II</em>- The Committee looks forward to TOPOFF II, scheduled to take place by July of 2002. The purpose of the exercise is to simulate the high pressure conditions under which top-level government officials would have to make decisions if a terrorist incident occurred on our soil. TOPOFF gives participants at all levels of government the opportunity to identify their weaknesses and demonstrate and refine their strengths. TOPOFF II will be particularly useful to the Co-Coordinators for Combating Domestic Terrorism--the DAG-CT and the Deputy Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency--in that it will allow them to work through a live-action, national exercise. The Committee recommends $4,000,000 for TOPOFF II.
<p><em>Annual Exercise Program</em>- Based on the highly successful TOPOFF exercises and on input from the State and local emergency response community, the Committee directs OSLDPS to establish an annual exercise program that will provide, in alternating years, a Federal, State and Local (FSL) regional exercise and a national-level TOPOFF exercise. The Committee recommends a total of $5,000,000 for this purpose. Of these funds, $2,000,000 is recommended to support the FSL regional exercise program and $3,000,000 for costs associated with the biennial TOPOFF exercise. The Committee recommends an additional $3,000,000 for OSLDPS for the continuation of the Improved Response Program (IRP) formerly under the Nunn-Lugar-Domenici program. The IRP provides technical evaluations and exercises focused on meeting high priority responder needs.
<p><em>International Terrorism Exercise</em>- The Department of State has unique expertise in the area of combating international terrorism, deriving primarily from its responsibility for the safety of Americans abroad. The Committee directs OSLDPS to work closely with the Department of State to compare contingency plans for terrorist incidents. Further, the Committee directs the Department of Justice and Department of State to conduct a large-scale exercise on international soil by January of 2004. The Departments of Justice and State shall jointly prepare a plan for this international exercise, to be submitted to the Committees on Appropriations no later than May 1, 2002. This plan should include a list of objectives to be accomplished, a description of potential obstacles, a description of sites under construction, a tentative schedule, and preliminary cost estimates.
<p><em>Other Training</em>- The Committee recommends a total of $35,000,000 for the OSLDPS to meet the ongoing training needs of State and local jurisdictions. Due to the completion of the transition of the Nunn-Lugar-Domenici Domestic Preparedness Program to the Department of Justice, OSLDPS requires enhanced training program capability. In the process of developing their Statewide Domestic Preparedness Strategic Plans, States have identified a number of new requirements and training gaps. Among these are WMD tactical training for State and local response teams, evidence collection and preservation, and advanced training for biological incidents. Funding provided under this heading will allow OSLDPS to develop and deliver these crucial training programs. Within funds available to OSLDPS for training, the Committee recommends $1,000,000 for the continuation of the State and Local Antiterrorism Training (SLATT) program. The purpose of SLATT is to ensure coordination of activities and to minimize the potential for confusion and conflicting training.
<p><em>Technical Assistance</em>- A total of $8,000,000 is recommended for OSLDPS to provide a continuing program of technical assistance to States, the District of Columbia, and local jurisdictions in order to enhance their capabilities to better plan for and respond to incidents of domestic terrorism. Specific priorities should include technical assistance to the States to refine their Statewide Domestic Preparedness Equipment Strategies and assist State and local jurisdictions in the planning and conduct of tailored local and regional exercises.
<p><em>Research and development</em>- The Committee is aware of the great need for sustained, creative, high-risk research, development, testing, and evaluation (RDT&E) for equipment and concepts used in combating terrorism.  The Committee directs those Federal entities involved in the RDT&E of combating terrorism technologies to explore telephony technology as a means of providing early warning and facilitating evacuation in the event of a terrorist attack. The Committee directs that RDT&E programs for combating terrorism currently administered by the National Institute for Justice be transferred to the DAG-CT. The Committee directs the DAG-CT to report to the Committees on Appropriations on the status of the Department's efforts to develop a research, development, testing, and evaluation (RDT&E) system similar to the Department of Defense System, as proposed and funded in the fiscal year 2001 Conference Report. In producing this report, the DAG-CT shall consult with the Oklahoma City National Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism (MIPT), the Dartmouth Institute for Security and Technology Studies (ISTS), the Technical Support Working Group (TSWG), and other entities responsible for research and development of technologies to combat terrorism. This new system will be applicable to all RDT&E for combating terrorism and will provide consistency and compatibility to the separate RDT&E systems used by the various research bodies. This report should be received by the Committees on Appropriations no later than December 30, 2001.
<p><em>Prepositioned equipment</em>- The Committee recognizes that the equipment needs of State and local jurisdiction are considerable, and that these can never be completely addressed. Equipment that is placed in strategic locations throughout the country can help provide coverage to jurisdictions that were not targeted for equipment grants in the States' comprehensive plans. This prepositioned equipment is standardized and configured into pods that are transportable by the National Guard. The pods are housed in secure National Guard facilities but are for the use of first responders only. The Committee recommends $8,000,000 for this effort.
<p><em>Web Site Pilot Project</em>- The Committee recognizes the enormous potential the world wide web holds for facilitating the domestic preparedness efforts of State and local first responders. The Committee believes the world wide web could be used more effectively for the sharing of information and best practices between the State and local jurisdictions and the Federal agencies that support them, as well as among first responders across the country. Each jurisdiction faces unique challenges and has unique equipment and training needs. The Committee believes that web technology will help OSLDPS tailor its assistance programs to the diverse and changing needs of its clients. The Committee therefore recommends $2,000,000 for OSLDPS for a pilot project to develop an interactive web site to serve and support this nation's State and local first responders.
<p><em>Management and administration</em>- The Committee recommendation provides $42,797,000 for the management and administration [M&A] of the Office of Justice Programs. In addition, funding will be provided from transfers from the `Juvenile justice' account and from the `State and Local Assistance' account for the administration of grants under these activities.

<p><em>Local law enforcement block grant</em>- The Committee recommendation includes $400,000,000 to continue the local law enforcement block grant program which provides grants to localities to reduce crime and improve public safety. Of the amounts provided, $19,956,000 will be provided to NIJ to assist local units to identify, select, develop, modernize, and purchase new technologies for use by law enforcement. The recommendation for funding for the local law enforcement block grant continues the commitment to provide local governments with the resources and flexibility to address specific crime problems in their communities.
<p><em>Boys and Girls Clubs</em>- Within the amounts provided for the local law enforcement block grants, the Committee recommends $80,000,000 for the Boys and Girls Clubs. The Committee commends Boys and Girls Clubs of America for its effort to reach all children who are in need of support and affirmation.
<p><em>Indian Country Grants</em>- The recommendation provides $70,191,000 for Indian Country grants, which is equal to the budget request. Of this amount, $35,000,000 is for the Cooperative Agreement Program, and $35,191,000 for Indian Country Prison Construction. Within the amount for prison construction, the Committee directs that grants be provided for the following projects:
<p> --$4,200,000 for a grant for NANA 28 bed jail for Kotzebue, Alaska;
<p> --$620,000 for the construction of a detention facility within the Spirit Lake Nation;
<p> --$4,000,000 for a grant for construction of the Detention Facility for the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe; and
<p> --$16,300,000 for the construction of the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians Detention Facility.
<p><em>State Criminal Alien Assistance Program</em>- The recommendation provides $265,000,000 for the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program [SCAAP] for the reimbursement to States for the costs of incarceration of criminal aliens. The Committee will also entertain a reprogramming request from the Department on this important issue addressing funding or administration requirements.
<p><em>Indian Tribal Courts Program</em>- The Committee recommendation provides $7,982,000 to assist tribal governments in the development, enhancement, and continuing operation of tribal judicial systems by providing resources for the necessary tools to sustain safer and more peaceful communities.
<p><em>Edward Byrne Grants to States</em>- The Committee recommendation provides $578,125,000 for the Edward Byrne Memorial State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance Program, of which $78,125,000 is for discretionary grants and is $500,000,000 for formula grants.
<p>Within the amount provided for formula grants, the Committee expects the Bureau of Justice Assistance [BJA] to provide:
<p> --$15,000,000 for Project HomeSafe for safety packets which include a gun locking device and information on how to handle and store guns safely. These safety packets are distributed by the foundation at no charge to any municipality that adopts the program. This year the program will supply nearly 500,000 gunlocks to cities and States around the country. The committee recommendation shall be used to supplement current funding and allow the foundation to provide over 8,000,000 gun locks to municipalities in fiscal year 2001. The Committee is very concerned about incidents of children gaining access to a handgun, rifle, or shotgun in the home and either harming themselves or someone else. The Committee is aware that at least 80 percent of new guns sold in the United States are equipped with gunlocks, however, there are millions of guns already on the streets that are not so equipped and a danger to children. The Committee encourages municipalities to take advantage of this initiative.
<p>Within the amount provided for BJA discretionary grants, the Committee expects the Bureau of Justice Assistance to provide:
<p> --$5,000,000 for the National Crime Prevention Council to continue and expand the National Citizens Crime Prevention Campaign [McGruff];

<p>The fiscal year 2002 funding will be used to develop and implement effective arrest and prosecution policies to prevent, identify, and respond to violent crimes against women, strengthen programs addressing stalking, and provide much needed victims services. This includes specialized domestic violence court advocates who obtain protection orders. In addition, programs should be strengthened to encourage reporting of domestic violence by providing assurances that law enforcement and attorney support systems would be available. This funding is to be distributed to States to significantly enhance the availability of services, prosecutors, and law-enforcement officials to women and children who are subjected to domestic violence. The Committee notes that Alaska has the highest rate of domestic violence in the nation. As many as 100 percent of Native women in some State prisons and 80 percent Statewide report that they have been raped, beaten, or physically or sexually abused. The Committee directs the Department to work with the State of Alaska, the Alaska Native community, and non-profit organizations involved in prevention and treatment of domestic violence to develop a comprehensive Statewide plan utilizing best practices in combating this epidemic, particularly in rural Native villages. A plan including recommendations for further action among various Federal agencies on an interdisciplinary basis should be submitted to the Committee by May 1, 2002.
<p><em>Substance abuse treatment for State prisoners</em>- The Committee recommends $68,000,000, for the Residential Substance Abuse Treatment Program for State Prisoners [RSAT]. The RSAT Program provides financial and technical assistance to assist State and local governments in developing and implementing residential treatment programs within State and local correctional and detention facilities in which inmates are incarcerated for a period of time sufficient to permit substance abuse treatment. Consistent with the authorizing statute, States must agree to require drug testing of individuals enrolled in the treatment program and give preference to projects that assist in the placement of program participants with community-based aftercare services, such as parole supervision, education and job training, and halfway houses. These aftercare programs cannot be funded with RSAT grant dollars.
<p><em>Safe Return Program</em>- The Committee recommends $898,000 to continue and expand training of law enforcement and other emergency response personnel to locate missing Alzheimer patients.
<p><em>Law enforcement family support programs</em>- The Committee recommendation provides $1,497,000 for this program to assist Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies in developing and implementing policies and programs to reduce stress and provide appropriate support services for law enforcement officers and their families.
<p><em>Senior citizens against marketing scams</em>- The recommendation provides $1,995,000 for this program to assist law enforcement in preventing and stopping marketing scams against the elderly. The Committee requests that some program sessions be held at the National Advocacy Center. Also, the Committee directs that this effort be coordinated with the Federal Trade Commission.
<p><em>Alcohol and Crime Prevention in Indian Country</em>- The recommendation provides $4,989,000 for demonstration grants to address alcohol and crime prevention in Indian Country.
<p><em>Motor Vehicle Theft Prevention</em>- The recommendation provides $1,298,000 for grants to combat motor vehicle theft.

<p>The Committee recommends an appropriation of $1,019,874,000. The recommendations is $164,765,000 above the budget request.
<p>The funds provided by the Committee for assistance to State and local law enforcement agencies are as follows:
<p><em>Police Hiring Initiatives</em>- The Committee recommends $447,606,000 for police hiring initiatives as follows: $180,000,000 for school resource officers; $190,291,000 from direct appropriations for the COPS hiring program; $46,000,000 from prior year balances to be used for UHP; and $31,315,000 for Indian Country.
<p><em>Safe Schools Initiative (SSI)</em>- The Committee continues to be concerned about the level of violence in our children's schools. To address this issue, $234,851,000 is provided for the continuation of the Safe Schools Initiative (SSI), including funds for technology development, prevention, community planning, and school safety officers. Within this total, $180,000,000 is from the COPS hiring program to provide school resource officers who will work in partnership with schools and other community-based entities to develop programs to improve the safety of elementary and secondary school children and educators in and around schools; $15,000,000 is from the Juvenile Justice At-Risk Children's Program and $22,851,000 is from the COPS program ($37,500,000 total) for programs aimed at preventing violence in schools through partnerships with schools and community-based organizations; $17,000,000 is provided from the Crime Identification Technology Program to the NIJ to develop technologies to improve school safety.
<p><em>Indian Country</em>- The Committee recommendation includes $31,315,000 to be used to improve law enforcement capabilities on Indian lands and native villages, both for hiring uniformed officers, including village public safety officers, and for the purchase of equipment and training for new and existing officers.
<p><em>Management and Administration</em>- The Committee recommendation includes a provision that provides that not to exceed $32,812,000 shall be expended for management and administration of the program.
<p><em>Non-Hiring Initiatives</em>- The Committee is aware that the COPS program reached its goal of funding 100,000 officers in May of 1999. Having reached its original goal, the Committee wants to ensure there is adequate infrastructure for the new police officers, similar to the focus that has been provided Federal law enforcement. The Committee believes this will enable police officers to work more efficiently, equipped with the protection, tools, and technology they need: to address crime in and around schools, to provide law enforcement technology for local law enforcement, to combat the emergence of methamphetamine in new areas and provide policing of `hot spots' of drug market activity, and to provide bullet proof vests for local law enforcement officers and correctional officers. Specifically, the Committee directs the program to use $493,643,000 to fund initiatives that will result in more effective policing. The Committee believes that these funds should be used to address these critical law enforcement requirements and directs the program to continue the following non-hiring grant programs:
<p>1. <em>COPS Technology Program</em>- The Committee provides $155,467,000 to be used for continued development of technologies and automated systems to assist State and local law enforcement agencies in investigating, responding to, and preventing crime.

These challenge activities are designed to improve various aspects of a State's juvenile justice and delinquency prevention program.
<p>6. $15,965,000 for the Juvenile Mentoring Program [JUMP] (Part G). This program seeks to reduce juvenile delinquency, improve academic performance, and reduce the dropout rate among at-risk youth through the use of mentors. This program has proven successful in reaching at-risk youth and has significant support at the local level. The program brings together young people in high crime areas with law enforcement officers and other responsible adults who are willing to serve as long-term mentors. The Committee encourages OJP to focus on applications submitted by community based organizations with a proven history of providing effective and efficient one-on-one services. Within the amounts provided, the Committee provides $5,000,000 for the Big Brothers/Big Sisters program to expand its capacity to serve more at-risk youth.
<p>7. $130,767,000 for the At Risk Children's Program (Title V). Under Title V of juvenile justice programs, the At Risk Children's Program provides funding to support comprehensive delinquency prevention plans formulated at the community level. The program targets truancy and school violence; gangs, guns, and drugs; and other influences that lead juveniles to delinquency and criminality.
<p><em>Safe Schools Initiative [SSI]</em>- The Committee includes $15,000,000 within the Title V grants for the Safe Schools Initiative. This effort may include training and services such as: accountability and responsibility training; violence reduction training, including dispute resolution; juvenile mentoring; training for teachers and families to recognize troubled children; and parent accountability and family strengthening education.
<p><em>Tribal Youth Program</em>- The Committee includes $12,472,000 within Title V grants for programs to reduce, control, and prevent crime both by and against tribal and Native youth; for interventions for court-involved tribal youth; for improvement to tribal and Native juvenile justice systems; and for prevention programs focusing on alcohol and drugs, including the Alaska Federation of Natives to develop an underage drinking prevention program in rural Alaska that includes assessment and education and focuses on the children of alcoholics. Within this amount, the Committee directs that $2,000,000 be provided for a grant to fund the Alaska Illegal Drug and Alcohol Use Initiative.
<p><em>Enforcing the Underage Drinking Laws Program</em>- The Committee recommends $25,000,000 within Title V grants to assist States in enforcing underage drinking laws. Each State shall receive $360,000 and $6,640,000 shall be available for discretionary grants to States.
<p><em>Juvenile justice research, evaluation, training, and technical assistance</em>- The Committee recognizes that high quality research, evaluation, and statistical analysis are critical to understanding and addressing the causes of youth crime, understanding the scope of delinquency and its impact on the juvenile justice system, and identifying effective approaches to delinquency control that can be replicated at the State and local levels. The Committee recommendation allows the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Programs [OJJDP] to set aside 2 percent for training and technical assistance and 10 percent for research, evaluation, and statistics activities.
<p>8. <em>Victims of Child Abuse Act</em>- The Committee recommends $8,481,000 for the various programs authorized under the Victims of Child Abuse Act [VOCA]. Funds, provided to establish regional and local children's advocacy centers, may not be used to provide legal aid. The recommendation includes $8,481,000 to improve investigations and prosecutions (subtitle A) as follows:
<p> --$1,247,250 to establish regional children's advocacy centers, as authorized by section 213 of VOCA;
<p> --$4,989,000 to establish local children's advocacy centers, as authorized by section 214 of VOCA;
<p> --$1,496,700 for a continuation grant to the National Center for Prosecution of Child Abuse for specialized technical assistance and training programs to improve the prosecution of child abuse cases, as authorized by section 214a of VOCA; and
<p> --$748,050 for a continuation grant to the National Network of Child Advocacy Centers for technical assistance and training, as authorized by section 214a of VOCA.

</table>
<p>The Committee recommends an appropriation of $35,619,000. The recommendation is equal to the budget request and provides all mandatory funding for death benefits under the Public Safety Officers Benefits Program. This program provides a lump-sum death benefit payment to eligible survivors of Federal, State, and local public safety officers whose death was the direct and proximate result of a traumatic injury sustained in the line of duty. In addition, $2,395,000 is provided to pay for disability benefits to public safety officers who are permanently disabled in the line of duty. Within the available carryover balances, sufficient funding is available for the program which provides payments for education purposes to the dependents of Federal, State, and local public safety officers who are killed or permanently disabled in the line of duty. No additional funding is provided to expand the education benefits program in fiscal year 2001.
<p><h3>GENERAL PROVISIONS--DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</h3>
<p>The Committee recommends the following general provisions:
<p>Section 101 makes up to $45,000 of the funds appropriated to the Department of Justice available for reception and representation expenses.
<p>Section 102 eliminates an extraneous provision.
<p>Section 103 allows the Department of Justice to spend up to $10,000,000 for rewards for information regarding acts of terrorism against U.S. citizens or property at levels not to exceed $2,000,000 per reward.
<p>Section 104 allows the Department of Justice, subject to the Committee's reprogramming procedures, to transfer up to 5 percent between appropriations, but limits to 10 percent the amount that can be transferred into any one appropriation.
<p>Section 105 expands a land border port of entry pilot program.
<p>Section 106 provides technical assistance funds to improve oversight of certain grant programs.
<p>Section 107 transitions Parole Commission caseload to a successor organization.
<p>Section 108 allows Justice to collect reimbursements from manufacturers for warranty work done in-house.
<p>Section 109 addresses an inequity in the immigration inspection process.
<p>Section 110 improves the efficiency of the immigration adjudication process.
<p>Section 111 allows amounts in the Crime Victims Fund, in any fiscal year, to be used to support the operation and maintenance of the Victim Notification System (VNS). In order to provide victims with information on case events, the Department of Justice has developed an automated victim notification system. Currently, this effort involves coordination among the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the United States Attorneys Offices, the Federal Bureau of Prisons, and the Office of Victims of Crime. The Committee understands that $1,000,000 remains available from funds transferred to the Crime Victims Fund from the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, National Fine Center in the Department's Fiscal Year 1998 Appropriations Act (Section 109, Public Law 105-119). The use of these funds to support the operation and maintenance of the VNS is consistent with the original intent of the transfer to improve services for the benefit of crime victims in the Federal criminal justice system. The Committee directs that an additional $4,000,000 be provided from the Fund to support the $5,000,000 annual estimated cost of the VNS program.
<p><h3>TITLE II--DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE AND RELATED AGENCIES</h3>
<p>The Committee recommends a total of $5,662,719,000 for the U.S. Trade Representative, the International Trade Commission, and the Department of Commerce for fiscal year 2002. This amount is $491,714,000 above the total request.
<p><h3>TRADE AND INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT</h3>
<p>The Committee has included under this section of title II, the U.S. Office of the Trade Representative, the International Trade Commission, and the Department of Commerce agencies responsible for trade promotion and enforcement and economic infrastructure development.

</table>
<p><em>Trade Development</em>- The Committee recommends an appropriation of $66,820,000. The recommendation is $14,500,000 above the budget request.  The Committee recommends continued funding for the enhancement of the agency's export data base, funding for the National Textile Center at a level of $11,000,000 and the Textile/Clothing Technology Center at a level of $3,500,000.
<p><em>Market Access and Compliance</em>- The Committee recommends an appropriation of $27,441,000. The recommendation is identical to the budget request. Assuring that U.S. companies receive the full benefit of our trade agreements is critically important. In fiscal year 2001, the Committee approved a large increase for compliance and enforcement. The Committee directs the Office of Market Access and Compliance (MAC) to continue with their compliance effort and recommends $5,700,000 within available funds for this purpose. Part of this effort is to increase the number of staff working on ensuring foreign compliance with trade agreements. The Committee recommends augmenting Washington-based staffing to focus on markets where U.S. firms face persistent compliance issues and market access barriers, in particular Japan, China, and the European Union. The Committee encourages MAC to evaluate their staffing to assure the success of this important mission
<p>Many U.S. companies are reluctant to complain about problems they are facing in foreign markets. The Committee recommends $1,700,000 within available funds for ITA to continue to place and maintain support for compliance officers in China, Japan, and the European Union, and other key markets so that they can detect and swiftly address compliance problems U.S. companies face in these markets. In addition, the Committee directs the ITA to continue with the Washington-based mobile strike force that can nimbly move to address compliance problems U.S. companies face in any market. The Committee directs that these officers be integrated into the U.S. Foreign Commercial Service offices, as U.S. business looks to the commercial officers for support and assistance.
<p><em>Import Administration</em>- The Committee recommends an appropriation of $42,859,000. The recommendation is identical to the budget request. The Committee recommendation includes $1,500,000 for the Import Administration to continue to place and maintain overseas enforcement officers, including monitoring compliance with the World Trade Organization and other international commitments on antidumping and subsidies. The Committee directed the Import Administration to station a senior official in Geneva to work with the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) on issues related to antidumping and countervailing duties in fiscal year 2001. The Committee intended that this official would participate in the meetings of the Antidumping and Subsidies Committees, assist the USTR in Dispute Settlement proceedings that are relevant to the Antidumping and Subsidies Agreements, monitor developments in the Working Party on Trade and Competition Policy, and provide policy expertise on matters pertaining to the maintenance of strong antidumping and antisubsidy laws in the United States. As a cost saving measure, the Committee anticipated that the USTR's Geneva office will provide the necessary space within its offices for use by the Import Administration. The Committee directs USTR to respond to the Committee's fiscal year 2001 directive in order to ensure Import Administration's complete participation in World Trade Organization Antidumping and Subsidies proceedings.
<p>The Committee recommendation provides $3,500,000 for the Import Administration to monitor import data and customs flows for surges in key markets and sectors, such as steel and lumber, and take immediate action when such surges are detected. Such action should include using resources to expedite unfair trade cases so U.S. companies can receive relief at the earliest possible date. In addition, Import Administration must vigorously monitor foreign subsidies so that action can be taken if the subsidies violate trade agreements.
<p>The Committee recommends $2,500,000 to review and evaluate in-depth China and Japanese compliance with antidumping and countervailing duty commitments. China and Japan represent the majority of unfair trade actions, and the Committee believes there is an urgent need for greater attention to both Japanese and Chinese trade practices.
<p><em>U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service [US&FCS]</em>- The Committee recommends an appropriation of $193,824,000. The recommendation is identical to the request.
<p>The Committee is concerned about the efficiency of the agency's domestic operations. In its' fiscal year 2001 report, the Committee recommended a consolidation of U.S. Export Assistance Centers in metropolitan areas where more than one center was present. In response to the Committee's concerns, the U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service established the Silicon Valley U.S. Export Assistance Center. This resulted in the closure of centers in San Jose and Santa Clara, California. The Committee commends the U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service on this consolidation effort. At the same time, however, new U.S. Export Assistance Centers have opened in Las Vegas, Nevada and Indio, California. The Committee remains concerned about the number of centers in certain metropolitan areas and directs the U.S. Foreign and Commercial Service to provide a report to the Committees on Appropriations on its consolidation efforts by January 15, 2002.
<p>The Committee supports the Commercial Service's work on the Appalachian-Turkish Trade Project, a project to promote opportunities to expand trade, encourage business interests, stimulate foreign studies, and to build a lasting and mutually meaningful relationship between the Appalachian States and the Republic of Turkey, as well as the neighboring regions, such as Greece. The Committee expects the agency to support the project.
<p><em>Administration and Executive Direction</em>- The Committee recommends an appropriation of $13,146,000. The recommendation is identical to the budget request. Bill language is included which prohibits certain offices from taking funds from other accounts. If additional funds are needed, a reprogramming request should be submitted to the Committee for approval.

The Export Enforcement Division detects, prevents, investigates, and assists in the sanctioning of illegal dual-use exports. Within available funds, the Committee recommendation provides $7,250,000 for Chemical Weapons Convention enforcement, $1,600,000 for replacement of the Export Control Automated Support System and $496,000 for additional export licensing personnel.

<p>The Economic Development Administration [EDA] provides grants to local governments and nonprofit agencies for public works, planning, and other projects designed to facilitate economic development.
<p>The Committee recommends an appropriation of $371,557,000. The recommendation is $6,000,000 above the budget request. Funding amounts for the two appropriations accounts under this heading are displayed below.

<p>The Committee recommends an appropriation of $341,000,000. The recommendation is $6,000,000 above the budget request.
<p>The Committee recommendation provides funding of $250,000,000 for public works grants (title I), $24,000,000 for planning assistance, $10,500,000 for trade adjustment assistance, and $40,900,000 for economic adjustment grants (title IX). The Committee recommendation does not include funding for defense economic adjustment. Public Law 101-50 stipulates that all closure and realignments must be completed no later than 6 years after recommendation for closure or realignment was made. The last round of base closure decisions was made in 1995. The Committee notes that Federal facilities provide a substantial economic benefit to local communities and that when excess infrastructure results in facility closures or realignments, local communities can be adversely impacted. Currently, Federal Departments and Agencies do not integrate or coordinate their facility investments or policies. The Committee recommendation provides $6,000,000 for the National Infrastructure Institute to establish a center for infrastructure expertise at the former Pease Air Force Base in Portsmouth, New Hampshire to assist Departments and Agencies in the development of facility best business practices and to secure improvements in the efficiency of infrastructure owned or leased by the Federal Government. The Committee expects this pilot project to demonstrate efficiencies in facility management and life cycle infrastructure costs and identify opportunities for Federal Departments and Agencies to partner with each other and with the private sector to better utilize the Federal Government's huge infrastructure investment.
<p>The Committee is aware of several proposals for economic development or adjustment assistance and strongly urges EDA to consider applications for the following proposals within applicable procedures and guidelines and provide a grant, if warranted: (1) Randolph Village School Economic Development Project, Randolf, VT; (2) infrastructure improvement at Discovery Square and Lancaster Square, PA; (3) a proposal for wiring the Southwest border in New Mexico; (4) development of an industrial park at Sawmill Cove, Sitka, AK; and (5) expansion of DePaul University's computer science facilities and programs.
<p>The Committee expects EDA to continue its efforts to assist communities impacted by economic dislocations relating to industry downswings as well as to assist communities impacted by downturns due to environmental concerns. This includes the timber and coal industries, United States-Canadian trade-related issues, communities in New England, the mid-Atlantic, Hawaii, and Alaska impacted by fisheries regulations, and communities in the Southeast impacted by downturns due to NAFTA.

<p>This account provides for the constitutionally mandated decennial census, quinquennial censuses, and other programs which are cyclical in nature. Additionally, individual surveys are conducted for other Federal agencies on a reimbursable basis. The Committee recommendation includes $694,000 for the Census Survey of Women Business. In past years, funding for this survey has been provided through the Small Business Administration account and the Census Bureau was reimbursed for the costs of conducting the survey.
<p>For other programs under this account, the Committee recommends the requested levels of $51,958,000 for economic censuses; $5,745,000 for census of governments; $6,048,000 for intercensal demographic estimates; $6,254,000 for electronic information collection; $37,624,000 for geographic support; and $23,254,000 for data processing systems. The Committee also recommends $12,397,000 for demographic survey sample redesign and $26,246,000 for the continuous measurement program.

<p>The Committee recommends an appropriation of $43,466,000. The recommendation is identical to the budget request. Public broadcasters face a significant challenge in making the transition from analog to digital broadcasting. The public broadcasters, as well as commercial broadcasters, are required to make the change from analog to digital broadcasting by 2005. This is an expensive task, and is going to be particularly challenging for public broadcasters whose networks include numerous translator stations.
<p>These challenges are particularly great for those broadcasters who are located in, or who serve, largely rural areas. As in past years, the Committee continues to urge the agency to place emphasis on the needs of these stations, and to support focusing resources on distance learning initiatives targeting rural areas.

<p>The regional information sharing system [RISS] under the Department of Justice provides funding for law enforcement entities which have traditionally obtained funding from the TOP Program. The Committee recommendation excludes law enforcement entities eligible for the RISS Program from applying for TOP funds. The Committee expects NTIA to give preference to applications from consortia and for purposes such as public safety or other uses for which there is no other funding source available.
<p>The Committee is aware of several proposals for information infrastructure grants and strongly urges NTIA to consider applications for the following proposals within applicable procedures and guidelines and provide a grant, if warranted: (1) an electronic commerce initiative at the University of Missouri-Columbia; (2) a technology training initiative proposal by Morgan State University; (3) Vermont Interactive Television; (4) Shiloh, PA Community Service; and (5) North Dakota State University Technology Park Internships.

<p>The Committee recommends total budget resources of $1,139,001,000. The recommendation is identical to the budget request and is a 9 percent increase over fiscal year 2001.
<p>The Patent and Trademark Office [PTO] is charged with administering the patent and trademark laws of the United States. PTO examines patent applications, grants patent protection for qualified inventions, and disseminates technological information disclosed in patents. PTO also examines trademark applications and provides Federal registration to owners of qualified trademarks. The PTO is subject to the policy direction of the Secretary of Commerce, but the agency has independent control of its budget, expenditures, personnel, procurement and other administrative and management functions.
<p>The PTO has experienced significant growth in recent years due to the increase in applications for patents and trademarks. Trademark applications have substantially increased since the mid-1990s, and the high technology and biotechnology industries have accounted for much of the growth in patent applications.
<p>While the agency has experienced significant growth in recent years as a direct result of workload increases, PTO's corporate plan predicts that patent pendency will rise from 26.2 months to an unacceptable 38.6 months by fiscal year 2006. PTO assumes this would occur even if the agency retains all of its projected fee collections for the next several years. The ability of the administration to formulate an adequate budget for the PTO is complicated by two factors. First, the agency historically has formulated an incremental budget based on the previous year's budget, and does not provide the Committee with a thorough business plan that demonstrates how resources will be used and what results will obtain. Second, PTO management has not been sufficiently innovative. Although patent filings have increased dramatically over the past decade, PTO management chose to remain wedded to an archaic patent process and attempted to hire its way out of its workload problems. In the April 2001 presentation to their Public Advisory Committees, PTO management proposed hiring an additional 1,100 patent examiners in fiscal year 2003, but proposed making the patent application process fully electronic only in fiscal year 2006. In addition, PTO management has moved at a glacial pace to address the attrition problem among its patent examiners. Further, substantial amounts of funds have been expended on information technology projects over the last decade, but no significant increase in examiner productivity has been noted. Finally, the Committee lacks full confidence in the information provided to it by PTO management regarding its needs and performance.
<p>The Committee is pleased that the Secretary of Commerce has made a commitment to improve PTO operations and initiate an internal review to determine what the agency needs to do its job. Consistent with that approach, the Committee directs the Secretary of Commerce to develop a 5-Year Strategic Plan for the PTO with three core objectives: (1) prepare the agency to handle the workload associated with the 21st century economy, (2) improve patent quality, and (3) reduce patent and trademark pendency. The plan should include recommendations to improve retention and productivity of the examiner workforce, targeted hiring increases to deal with high-growth areas, improved training, and E-Government and other capital improvements designed to improve productivity. The plan should also include benchmarks for measuring progress in achieving each of those objectives. The plan shall be submitted to the Committee for review by no later than January 15, 2002. In an effort to accelerate implementation of time-sensitive elements of the Secretary's 5-year Plan, the Committee would be willing to consider a reprogramming request from unobligated PTO fee balances.
<p>The Committee further directs that the `electronic file wrapper' be fully implemented by the end of fiscal year 2004.
<p>The Committee observes that the PTO received its second consecutive financial audit with no reportable conditions, and expects that the PTO will make every effort to continue this laudable record. However, the Committee observes that PTO administrative expenses may be rising unnecessarily. The Committee notes that the agency's human resources office has 40 GS-13s through GS-15s supervising 60 other personnel, but that office had to acquire contractors simply to file 3 years of personnel actions that the office itself could not. The Committee expects that the PTO will take appropriate steps to ensure its administrative resources are sufficient but not extravagant.

<p>Within the amounts provided, the Committee approves the following increases: (1) $1,000,000 in the Manufacturing Engineering Program for the development of standards pertaining to the exchange of electronic data; (2) $4,000,000 in the Physics program to provide measurements, standards, and test methods for the development of advanced nanotechnologies; (3) $4,000,000 in the Computer Science and Applied Mathematics program to develop new measurements, test methods, and guidelines for the protection of the Nation's critical infrastructures; (4) $2,000,000 in the Chemical Science and Technology Program to further develop measurement standards for in-vitro diagnostics; and (5) $4,000,000 in the Computer Science and Applied Mathematics Program for quantum computing. The Committee does not recommend funding for the Critical Infrastructure Protection Grants Program. The Advanced Technology Program was developed to evaluate these types of grant applications. No funding is provided for Commerce Department expert review teams. Presidential Decision Directive #63 clearly suggests that every department and agency of the Federal Government shall be responsible for protecting its own critical infrastructure, especially its cyber-based systems. While the program is laudable, it is clearly not the responsibility of the Department of Commerce to provide computer security to other Federal agencies; and, (4) under the Wind Research Program, the Committee recommends $2,000,000 for wind engineering and $2,500,000 to continue funding an existing cooperative agreement between NIST and Texas Tech University.

<p>The Committee recommends an appropriation of $309,337,000. The recommendation is $190,071,000 above the budget request.
<p><em>Manufacturing Extension Partnership Program [MEP]</em>- The Committee recommends an appropriation of $105,137,000 to fully fund all of the MEP centers. The Committee recommends bill language to authorize the Secretary of Commerce to enter into agreements with nonprofit organizations to carry out collective research and development initiatives through the MEP. In addition, this language authorizes the Secretary to seek and accept contributions from public and private sources to support these efforts.
<p><em>Advanced Technology Program [ATP]</em>- The Committee recommends an appropriation of $204,200,000. The recommendation is $191,208,000 above the budget request. This amount, when combined with approximately $11,000,000 in carryover, will fully fund ATP awards at current levels. Within the amounts made available, $45,200,000 shall be used for administrative costs, internal laboratory support, and for Small Business Innovation Research Program [SBIR] requirements.
<p>The Committee notes that the Advanced Technology Program has been extensively reviewed. Since the inception of the ATP, there have been 52 studies conducted on the efficacy and merits of the program. The General Accounting Office has conducted 14 studies; 10 studies have been completed by the Department of Commerce, Office of the Inspector General; former Secretary of Commerce William Daley sponsored a 60-day study, and the National Research Council published, `ATP: Challenges and Opportunities' in 1999, and, `ATP: Assessing Outcomes' in 2001. In addition, 25 studies have been done by ATP's economic assessment office. These assessments reveal that the ATP does not fund projects that otherwise could have been financed in the private sector. Rather, the ATP facilitates so called `valley of death' projects that private capital markets are unable to fund.
<p>ATP has put a number of safeguards in place to ensure program funding does not replace private, venture capital funding. Since the 1998 competition, the ATP application form has included asking applicants to describe what efforts were made, prior to applying for ATP funding, to secure private capital for the project. In addition, this issue is addressed in oral reviews of project semifinalists.
<p>The Committee maintains that the government should play a role in choosing promising technologies to fund. From the telegraph to the Internet to biomedical research, government investment has spurred the development of new technologies and new fields which have had great impact on and held enormous benefit for the American people. According to the National Academy of Sciences' National Research Council, ATP's approach is funding new technologies that can contribute to important societal goals. For example, ATP supported GE Medical Systems in the development of a new method of producing large-area, flat-panel amorphous silicon detectors for X-rays. The research significantly reduced the number of processing steps required to manufacture the panels and increased the yield. The panels are the heart of a new digital mammography system which was one of the biggest breakthroughs in mammography in 20 years. In the sense that it was possible to manufacture these panels before, the broad research goal was not unique. However, the innovative technology was unique, and its development is making digital mammography more affordable and more widely available to women.
<p>The Committee concurs with the June 2001 National Academy of Sciences assessment; the many well-documented individual case studies; the Secretary's 1997 review; the February 1998 Development, Commercialization, and Diffusion Study; and the March 1999 review of the Performance of Completed Projects, all of which find that the ATP is a valuable and well-managed innovation program.
<p>In the budget request, the administration proposed a gradual phasing out of the Advanced Technology Program. The Committee does not recommend this approach and is concerned that the ATP awarding process could be purposely hindered as a result of this difference of opinion. Therefore, the Committee directs the Department of Commerce to submit a written plan on how it intends on making timely ATP awards in fiscal year 2002. This plan should be submitted to the Appropriations Subcommittees on Commerce, Justice, State and the Judiciary before any funds are obligated for Department of Commerce, Departmental Management.

<p>The Committee recommends an appropriation of $3,349,685,000 for National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NOAA], of which $7,000,000 is mandatory spending. Transfers total $71,000,000. This amount provided includes $251,000,000 for programs in the conservation spending category. The recommendation is $286,085,000 above the budget request. During this time of continued budgetary constraint, the Committee recommendation continues to make funding for ocean, coastal, fisheries, and atmospheric programs a high priority.
<p>As in past years, the Committee expects NOAA and the Department of Commerce to adhere to the direction given in this section of the Committee report and to observe the reprogramming procedures detailed in section 605 in the general provisions of the accompanying bill. Bill language is included that authorizes a NOAA Business Management Fund.
<p>The Committee supports NOAA's efforts to restructure and simplify its budgetary request. The Committee commends the five line offices and NOAA's budget office for their efforts in realigning the various programs funded and for bringing transparency to their budget proposals. As a result of these efforts, the Committee recommendations by program are reflected in a new series of tables. In many cases, these tables replace report language carried in previous Committee Reports regarding programs, projects, and activities. The Committee considers these tables binding. The Committee advises NOAA to seek the Committee's guidance if it is unsure on any matter reflected in the tables. The Committee directs NOAA to continue its restructuring efforts and expects the fiscal year 2003 budget request to reflect the changes contained within these tables. The Committee continues to support NOAA as one integrated agency and in no way intends for this restructuring to create separate appropriations for each of NOAA's line offices.
<p><h2>OPERATIONS RESEARCH, AND FACILITIES</h2>
<p>The Committee recommends discretionary appropriations of $2,267,705,000 for operations, research, and facilities for fiscal year 2002. The recommendation is $87,396,000 above the budget request. Of this amount, $33,650,000 is provided for conservation.
<p><em>Ocean Observing System.</em>--The Committee maintains a strong interest in an integrated interagency ocean observing system. Such a system would bring together Federal, academic, and state institutions, and industry into a coordinated system for monitoring U.S. marine waters. A coordinated national approach, linked effectively with similar programs in other nations, is an essential prerequisite for effective use and management of the oceans. The nation cannot realize the economic, social, and security benefits of the oceans in a responsible, sustainable manner without such a program. A number of agencies including the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, NOAA, the National Science Foundation, and the Office of Naval Research have varying interests and responsibilities in this area. The Committee directs the relevant agencies to work through the National Science and Technology Council and the National Oceanographic Partnership Program to develop an interagency plan for an ocean observing system and submit this report to the Committee with the President's fiscal year 2003 budget request.

<p>Some of the Committee recommendations displayed in the table above are described in more detail in the following paragraphs.
<p>The Committee recommends an appropriation of $447,240,000 for the National Ocean Service [NOS]. The recommendation is $82,754,000 above the budget request.
<p>The Committee has provided bill language that allows the Secretary to proceed as he deems necessary to have NOAA occupy and operate its research facilities in Lafayette, Louisiana.
<p><em>Navigation.</em>--The Committee recommends $5,455,000 for Electronic Navigational Charts. Of this amount, the Committee recommends $1,900,000 to create a catalog of electronic navigational charts for Alaska. Of the amounts provided for the Joint Hydrographic Center, $1,000,000 is for a study to analyze the data needs for developing a U.S. claim beyond the 200 nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone. This report will be submitted to Congress by May 31, 2002, and will identify existing data, data gaps, survey costs, and contracting opportunities to prepare a U.S. claim.
<p><em>Ocean Resources Conservation and Management</em>- The Committee directs the National Ocean Service to establish a Coastal Observation Technology System. This program shall provide a national framework, technical assistance, and support for sustained coastal observation systems. Among the entities with which the National Ocean Service is directed to engage are the Alliance for Coastal Technologies, Center for Integrated Marine Technologies, the University of New Hampshire Sea Grant program, and other regional organizations as appropriate. Regarding this activity, the Secretary and the National Ocean Service have the authority to transfer funds and enter into agreements with any entity, including other Federal agencies. The Committee recommendation includes $12,000,000 for this program, of which $3,000,000 is for the Alliance for Coastal Technologies; $3,000,000 is for the Center for Integrated Marine Technologies, and $3,000,000 is for the University of New Hampshire Sea Grant program. Funding for this activity is from the conservation category.
<p>The Committee recommendation includes an additional $1,000,000 for the Oxford laboratory to fill three full-time equivalents and purchase new lab equipment. The Committee recommendation includes $20,000,000 for the Coral Reef Program. Of this amount, the Committee recommendation includes $6,000,000 to convert a T-AGS vessel to support the research, monitoring, assessment, restoration, and outreach needs of the National Ocean Service in waters around the Hawaiian Islands and the American Flag Territories, including support for sanctuary activities. Under Response and Restoration, $1,000,000 is provided for Coastal Remediation Technology to develop a cooperative program with the Cooperative Institute for Coastal and Estuarine Environmental Technology to evaluate innovative environmental technologies for estuary remediation. Of the $1,950,000 provided for the Marine Environmental Health and Research Laboratory, the Committee recommendation includes $450,000 for the Murrells Inlet Special Area Management Plan. Under funding for the Coastal Ocean Program, the Committee directs the program to work with and continue its current levels of support for the Baruch Institute's research and monitoring of small, high-salinity estuaries.
<p><em>Ocean and Coastal Management</em>- The Committee is concerned that the Federal Coastal Zone Management Program has not adequately identified State practices that may contribute to coastal hazards. The NOAA is to provide a report to the Committees on Appropriations by September 15, 2001, that identifies States with Federally approved Coastal Management Programs with policies that allow for the readjustment of beachfront zoning, building baselines, and setback regulations based upon shoreline accretion and erosional characteristics. This report will specifically identify those States with policies that allow artificial shoreline accretion and beach nourishment to be the basis for modifying placement of beachfront zoning lines, baselines, and construction setback mechanisms.
<p>The Committee recommendation includes $3,000,000 for marine protected areas. The Committee notes that a national discussion on the potential of marine protected areas to protect the country's marine resources is merited. The Committee is concerned, however, that the nature of this discussion could be limited only to the input of Federal officials and ignore the true stakeholders and users of these resources. The Committee strongly recommends that NOAA seek broad input from commercial and sport fishermen as well as from scientists, fisheries experts, and environmentalists before rendering any decisions or making any recommendations to the Secretary of Commerce or to the Congress on the matter of creating marine protected areas. NOAA will submit a spending plan to the Committees on Appropriations on how it intends to engage the above groups before any of the funds for marine protected areas are obligated. Finally, the Committee notes that NOAA skillfully facilitated a broad discussion regarding the Tortugas Ecological Reserves in Florida and recommends that similar approaches to designating marine protected areas be applied in the future.
<p>The Committee encourages NOAA to continue its work with the Mariner's Museum and the Navy on efforts to recover and preserve the Monitor. The Committee does not recommend funding for the Sustainable Seas Expedition. During this time of budgetary constraint, it is critical that NOAA use limited staff time and days at sea judiciously in order to fulfill its core scientific and research missions.  To date, NOAA has requested $1,500,000 for the Sustainable Seas Expedition and spent over $10,000,000. It appears that NOAA did not adhere to section 605 of this bill. Furthermore, the Committee expects that no ship time will be allocated to the Sustainable Seas Expedition. The Committee has provided $14,000,000 in Oceanic and Atmospheric Research for Ocean Exploration. This investment will allow for a cross-agency, multi-institution partnership with a common goal of discovery and exploration of the last major frontier on Earth. This activity should replace the Sustainable Seas Expedition as NOAA's investment in undersea exploration, research, and technology in both the deep ocean and areas of special concern, such as the National Marine Sanctuaries.

<p>Some of the Committee recommendations displayed in the table above are described in more detail in the following paragraphs.
<p>The Committee recommends an appropriation of $555,775,000 for the National Marine Fisheries Service [NMFS]. The recommendation is $42,261,000 below the budget request. The Committee has included bill language directing NMFS to obligate $6,000,000 to the NOAA Office of General Counsel. This will enable the Under Secretary and Associate Offices to remain fully funded. The Committee  directs that this realignment will only come from NMFS base funds.
<p>The Committee observes that there are opportunities to significantly improve the regulatory processes of the National Marine Fisheries Service. Currently, NMFS handles each Endangered Species Act or National Environmental Policy Act case on an ad hoc basis, causing unnecessary delays, unpredictable outcomes, and a lack of accountability. The development and application of standardized practices would improve the quality and efficiency of regulatory decisions and raise the likelihood of success in litigation. The Committee instructs NOAA and NMFS to develop and apply throughout NMFS standardized practices for regulatory decisions. Furthermore, the Committee recommends streamlining the process by reducing the layers of review and concentrating the responsibility on qualified decision makers. The Committee expects to receive a plan for accomplishing these objectives by December 15, 2001, followed by quarterly reports of progress against these objectives.
<p>The Committee remains concerned that NMFS has become overburdened by lawsuits regarding a variety of issues related to fisheries and protected species, including the Steller sea lion and the Northern right whale. In order to assist the Committee in assessing this trend, NMFS is directed to provide a quarterly status report on pending litigation.
<p>Cooperative activities by Federal and State agencies are a vital part of conservation programs for many endangered and threatened species under the jurisdiction of the National Marine Fisheries Service. Among other things, state agencies offer knowledge, personnel, expertise, resources, and the legal authority to help carry out urgent research and management tasks. The Committee encourages NOAA to examine the existing and potential role of state agencies in carrying out recovery program tasks for Hawaiian monk seals, right whales, and other endangered or threatened marine species under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of Commerce. Where appropriate and not already in effect, the Committee encourages NOAA to develop cooperative agreements with states under section 6 of the Endangered Species Act to establish or clarify state agency involvement in those recovery programs. The Committee expects NOAA to request appropriations in their fiscal year 2003 budget under section 6 to support cooperative state activities that contribute to the recovery of endangered marine species.
<p>In the past, Congress provided $7,000,000 under Magnuson-Stevens Act for the Pribilof Islands to address the severe economic impact caused by precipitous decline in crab stocks in the Bering Sea. The Committee is concerned that the economy of the village of St. George was so adversely impacted, it has not been able to provide the required local match and has not been able to access the economic recovery funds. The Committee has included bill language waiving the match consistent with Interjurisdictional Fisheries Act.
<p>Out of base funds budgeted for the Southwest Regional Office [SWR], the Committee provides $1,000,000 for the Pacific Islands Area Office [PIAO] for administrative costs associated with the transition of the PIAO to the Western Pacific Regional Office. Within 30 days of date of enactment, SWR shall provide a report identifying all funds expended in fiscal years 2000 and 2001 by the SWR to support programs relating to Western Pacific region.
<p>The Committee recommendation includes $7,000,000 for North Atlantic right whale research and management activities. Of the amount provided, $1,000,000 is for the Northeast Consortium to complete funding of right whale research grants awarded in fiscal year 2001; and, $1,500,000 is for Atlantic coastal states to implement cooperative federal-state right whale recovery plans, such as those concluded under section 6 of the Endangered Species Act [ESA]. The Committee strongly encourages NMFS to conclude ESA section 6 agreements with coastal states of concern prior to fiscal year 2003. The remaining $4,500,000 is for NMFS to expedite right whale recovery in consultation with the Implementation Team and the Take Reduction Team. The NMFS is expected to support priority management, enforcement, and ship strike prevention activities, including expedited development and deployment of innovative fishing gear and whale tracking technologies, improved stranding response and procedures, a whale-sighting advisory system, and a mandatory ship-reporting system. No more than 20 percent of funds provided to NMFS may be used for salaries of existing personnel. The Committee expects NMFS to submit a status report to Congress describing its progress in meeting the priority recovery goals established in the 5-year research and management plan, as was requested in the fiscal year 2001 Conference Report. The Committee notes that this report has not been submitted for review by the Appropriations subcommittee. None of the funds for right whale activities may be obligated until this report has been approved.
<p>The Committee supports NMFS's efforts to address international conservation and recovery of sea turtles through an international bycatch strategy under Magnuson-Stevens Act Section 202(h), which calls for the Secretary of State, in cooperation with the Secretary of Commerce, to seek international agreements to establish standards and measures for bycatch reduction that are comparable to U.S. standards. International action is urgently needed in the international longline fishery, particularly in the Pacific region. In furtherance of this goal, the Committee directs NMFS, in cooperation with the Department of State, to work with other nations and industry, including the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum, to develop alternative fishing technologies and practices designed to reduce incidental capture mortality of sea turtles in the international longline fleet. NMFS is urged to convene preparatory meetings on gear development, particularly in the Pacific region, prior to the technical workshop scheduled for 2002 to ensure that agreement on alternative gear research and data sharing, including timetables for specific action, can be concluded at this workshop. The  Department of Commerce and Department of State shall report back on the status of these efforts within 90 days of enactment of this Act. The Committee recommendation includes $500,000 under NOAA `Executive Direction and Administration' for travel expenses associated with this effort.
<p><em>Fisheries Research and Management</em>- The Committee recommendation includes $5,000,000 for the National Fisheries Information System. The NMFS will submit a spending plan on the capabilities and out-year costs of this system before any funds for it may be obligated. The Committee has provided $3,700,000 for the recreational fishing information network [RecFIN] program, and expects that the Pacific, Atlantic, and Gulf States shall each receive one-third of these funds with funding for inshore recreational species assessment and tagging efforts in South Carolina. The Committee expects that $250,000 will be used to continue the effort to enhance the annual collection and analysis of economic data on marine recreational fishing. The Committee recommends that the $750,000 for the Interstate Fish Commissions be equally divided among the three commissions. As in prior fiscal years, funds appropriated for the Hawaii Fisheries Development and Hawaii Stock Management Plan programs shall be administered by the Oceanic Institute.
<p><em>Protected Resources Research and Management</em>- The Committee recommendation provides $1,000,000 to Marine Mammal Protection--Alaska Harbor Seal Research to be split evenly between the Alaska Sea Life Center and the Alaska Native Harbor Seal Commission.
<p><em>Habitat Conservation</em>- The Committee recommendation includes $3,000,000 for Chesapeake Bay Studies. In addition, the Committee recommends that NOAA initiate a micro-grant program allowing local governments and non-profit organizations to perform fisheries and shellfish restoration on the Chesapeake Bay.
<p><em>Enforcement and Surveillance</em>- The Committee recommendation provides $250,000 for a fisheries enforcement vessel for the New Hampshire Department of Fish and Game. This vessel should be used equally for biological research and fisheries enforcement.

<p>Some of the Committee recommendations displayed in the table above are described in more detail in the following paragraphs.
<p>The Committee recommends an appropriation of $367,630,000 for Oceanic and Atmospheric Research. The recommendation is $37,442,000 above the budget request.
<p><em>Climate Observations and Services</em>- Of the amounts appropriated for Argo, no less than 275 floats shall be deployed. The Committee recommends that with the funds provided for the Carbon Cycle line, at least one sampling site be established in New Hampshire.
<p><em>Weather and Air Quality Research</em>- Of the $3,730,000 provided for the Weather Research Program base, the Committee recommends $500,000 for continued development of the 3-D ceilometer in Hawaii. In addition, the Committee recommendation includes $4,000,000 for a pilot air quality forecasting system to increase the operational efficiency of power plants while minimizing their impact on air quality. The Committee recommendation also includes $5,000,000 to operate a model and deploy meteorological sensors to improve the daily temperature forecasts in a specific region. This will foster greater energy efficiency and more accurate electrical load forecasting.
<p><em>Ocean, Coastal, and Great Lakes Research</em>- Within the amount provided for the Great Lakes Environmental Research Lab (GLERL), the Committee recommends that NOAA support research programs on aquatic invasive species mitigation and reduction in the Lake Champlain Basin. In addition, the Committee recommends $500,000 for a study on the construction of an interagency facility owned by NOAA which would replace a leasing arrangement. The Committee recommends $13,850,000 for the National Undersea Research Program (NURP). Of the amount provided, $6,925,000 is for research conducted through the east coast NURP centers and $6,925,000 is for the west coast NURP centers, including the Hawaiian and Pacific Center and the West Coast and Polar Regions Center. The Committee expects level funding will be available for Aquarius, ALVIN, and program administration.

<p>Some of the Committee recommendations displayed in the table above are described in more detail in the following paragraphs.
<p>The Committee recommends an appropriation of $668,620,000 for the National Weather Service [NWS] for operations, acquisitions, and research. The recommendation is $10,164,000 above the request.
<p><em>Local Warnings and Forecasts</em>- The `1995 Secretary's Report to Congress on Adequacy of NEXRAD Coverage and Degradation of Weather Services' requested further studies of several sites, including Williston, ND and Erie, PA. The Committee provided funds to begin mitigation in fiscal year 1999 at these sites. The Committee has provided $4,790,000 to continue current operations at these sites. In addition, the Committee directs the NWS to make appropriate arrangements to maintain a local presence for the maintenance of the NOAA weather radio antenna in Erie, PA and develop a strategy to adequately address the prediction of lake-effect snow in the area. The Committee recommendation includes funding for three data buoys off New England in accordance with the National Research Council report of 1998.
<p><em>Advanced Hydrological Prediction Service</em>- The Committee recommendation provides $1,500,000 for the Advanced Hydrological Prediction Service, an increase of $500,000. The Committee expects that this increase will cover the development of this service for New Hampshire.
<p><em>Systems Operation and Maintenance</em>- The Committee notes that Alaska has the highest pilot death rate in the nation. No weather forecasting facilities exist in dozens of remote Native Alaskan villages. Accidents are often caused by rapidly changing weather conditions for which no forecasting information is available. The Committee recommendation provides $12,650,000 for Automated Surface Observing System [ASOS], of which $5,000,000 is for the installation of forecasting equipment in remote Alaskan villages.

<p>The Committee recommends an appropriation of $162,925,000 for the NOAA program support functions. The recommendation is $1,555,000 below the request.
<p><em>Corporate Services</em>- The Committee does not recommend funding for a $15,000,000 initiative to provide funding to historically black colleges and universities to train scientists. While the Committee believes that more women and minorities should be encouraged to seek careers in mathematics and sciences, funding for this purpose should be provided by the Department of Education, the National Academy of Sciences, or the National Science Foundation.
<p><em>Office of Marine and Aviation Operations</em>- The Committee recommends that $62,000,000 for Acquisition of Data be transferred from the National Ocean Service, National Marine Fisheries Service, and Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research to NOAA's Office of Marine and Aviation Operations under the Marine Services line. The Committee recognizes this transfer of funds is necessary to enable further efficiencies in the use of both contracted and NOAA ships. Further, the Committee expects that this transfer of responsibility will result in no fewer days at sea for any NOAA program. Of the $15,185,000 provided in Aircraft Services, the Committee recommends that an additional $1,000,000 be used to support the necessary overhaul of the P-3 aircraft. Prior to the obligation of funds, NOAA is directed to provide to the Committees on Appropriations an assessment of the condition of the aircraft, especially as it relates to corrosion, and the anticipated benefits from spending $1,500,000 as it relates to aircraft performance and service life.
<p>The R/V RONALD H. BROWN, commissioned in 1997, is NOAA's premier deep ocean research vessel and the largest vessel in the NOAA fleet. Equipped with highly advanced instruments and sensors, the NOAA R/V RONALD H. BROWN is unique in the world research fleet, built to support scientific studies worldwide that will increase our understanding of oceans and climate. The Committee notes that at a time that global warming and study of the role of the oceans in climate change has taken on increasing urgency, a substantial portion of the vessel's days at sea have been used to deploy and retrieve buoys in the Pacific rather than to support important atmospheric and oceanographic research in the Atlantic and elsewhere. While the Committee acknowledges the importance of maintaining these oceanographic buoys, other NOAA vessels or smaller charter vessels are more suitable to that mission. The Committee directs NOAA to plan for the R/V RONALD H. BROWN to spend no less than 139 days at sea in the Atlantic Ocean during fiscal year 2002 for oceanographic research opportunities lost in prior years.
<p>The Committee recommendation provides $19,020,000 for Fleet Planning and Maintenance. Of this amount, the Committee recommends $7,200,000 for equipment to support NOAA's mapping and charting missions. Funds for this purpose are authorized under the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998, the National Marine Sanctuaries Amendments of 2000, and the Coral Reef Conservation Act of 2000.

<p>The Committee recommendation provides $939,610,000 for Procurement, Acquisition, and Construction. This amount includes $3,200,000 in recoveries from prior years. The recommendation is $174,749,000 above the request. The amount provided includes $83,410,000 for programs in the conservation spending category.
<p>Some of the Committee recommendations displayed in the table above are described in more detail in the following paragraphs.
<p><em>National Ocean Service</em>- The Committee recommendation includes $5,000,000 for the Beaufort Laboratory for necessary repairs to existing facilities and to construct a joint laboratory, dock, and other facilities in collaboration with the Rachel Carson National Estuarine Research Reserve. The Committee recommends $60,000,000 for the coastal and estuarine land conservation program. This program is funded under the conservation spending category. This new program will provide funds for matching grants to States, communities, and groups engaged in land conservation efforts that benefit coastal and estuarine areas. These funds will be used expressly to acquire lands or interests in lands that include significant conservation, recreation, ecological, historical or aesthetic values to further the goals of a federally approved Coastal Zone Management Program or a National Estuarine Research Reserve. Of the amount provided for this program in fiscal year 2002, the Committee recommends the following projects: $10,000,000 for ACE Basin; $6,000,000 for the Great Bay Partnership; $1,250,000 for Mill River Harbor, CT; $3,000,000 for Morris Island, SC; $10,000,000 for Long Island, SC; $370,000 for Old Woman Creek, OH; $3,000,000 for Elkhorn Slough, CA; $325,000 for Taskinas Creek, VA; $1,000,000 for Hempstead Harbor, NY; $1,100,000 for Tilamook Bay, OR; $800,000 for Kitsap County, WA; $370,000 is for Massachusetts Bay, Manchester, MA; $875,000 for Lake Ontario, Parma, NY; $2,000,000 for Maryland Coastal Bays, MD; $3,000,000 for Hawaii Coastal Conservation; $3,000,000 for Los Cerritos Wetlands, Long Beach, CA; $350,000 for Carnes acquisition, Juneau Public Parks, Juneau, AK; and $4,000,000 for Tongass National Forest coastal land acquisition.
<p><em>Program Support</em>- The Committee notes that the NOAA R/V FAIRWEATHER will conduct the vast majority of its research off the coast of Alaska, and has provided bill language to homeport the vessel in Ketchikan, Alaska. The Committee recommendation provides $14,000,000 for a Small Waterplane Area Twin Hull vessel to be homeported in New Castle, NH. In addition, the Committee recommends $6,000,000 to convert a T-AGS vessel to be homeported in Charleston, SC.

<p>The Committee recommends an appropriation of $952,000 for the fishermen's contingency fund.
<p>The fishermen's contingency fund provides compensation to U.S. fishermen for damage or loss of fishing gear and any resulting loss because of natural or man-made obstructions related to oil and gas exploration, development, and production on the Outer Continental Shelf. The Secretary of Commerce is authorized to establish an area account within the fund for any area within the Outer Continental Shelf. A holder of a lease, permit, easement, or right-of-way in such area is required to pay a fee into the appropriate area account in the fund. Each area account, if depleted, will be replenished by assessment. The authorization stipulates that amounts available in each area account can be disbursed only to the extent provided by appropriations acts. Since receipts collected may not be sufficient for this appropriation, the Committee has included language which provides that the sums necessary to eliminate the insufficiency may be derived from the general fund of the Treasury.

<p>The Committee recommends an appropriation of $42,062,000 for Departmental Management. The recommendation is $4,410,000 above the budget request.  The Committee recommendation provides $750,000 for the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a study on the nature of global intellectual property counterfeiting and piracy. The purpose of the study is to develop effective, long-term strategies for addressing these threats to U.S. economic strength. The Department of Commerce will, in conjunction with the Department of Justice and not later than 1 month after enactment of this Act, grant this award to the National Academy of Sciences. The study will be completed by September 30, 2002. The Department of Commerce, the Department of Justice and other agencies shall fully cooperate with and provide necessary information to assess the current situation related to Intellectual Property theft.
<p>The Committee is concerned by the uncontrolled growth and lack of Congressional oversight of the Working Capital Fund [`the Fund']. The Committee believes that the Department's use of bureau program funds which are appropriated for program purposes should be scrutinized through reprogramming procedures. In addition, the Committee is concerned by the Department's use of appropriated bureau program funds to finance new Departmental initiatives. It is the Committee's intent that all programs and activities financed through the Fund and all changes and increases to the Fund shall require the advance approval of the Committee under the provisions of Section 605. Consequently the Department will submit a request for reprogramming before any funds may be obligated to or from the Fund.
<p>The Committee has, over the past 6 months, engaged in discussions with Department of Commerce officials regarding the need for Departmental Fund reforms. As an outcome of these discussions and the information provided by the Department of Commerce at the Committee's request, the Committee has developed directives which should be included in the Department's request for reprogramming. They are outlined in the following paragraphs.
<p>The Committee has included bill language that caps the Fund at a level of $117,000,000 and 700 Full-Time Equivalents [FTE]. Included is language capping funding for the Commerce Administrative Management Systems [CAMS] or CAMS-related products at $40,000,000. No more than $15,000,000 for CAMS will be assessed to NOAA. Any reductions necessary to be taken to operate the Fund at the fiscal year 2002 authorized level of $117,000,000 will be based upon the numbers of FTE of the Fund service providers, beginning with those service providers which operate with the largest number of FTEs and funds. At a minimum, reductions will be taken from the three largest Fund accounts and service providers as reported in the fiscal year 2002 Congressional Budget submission for Departmental Management. These service providers are the Office of Administrative Services, the Office of General Counsel and the Office of Security. The Office of Human Resources Management, Human Resources Services project and or its equivalent(s) will be reduced by at least $1,386,000.
<p>The Office of Management and Organization Support, Office of Budget Forms and Tracking System, Office of Human Resources Management Payroll Demonstration Project, Office of Human Resources Management Employee Diversity and Classification or their equivalents will be eliminated from the Fund.
<p>The Office of Human Resources Decennial Census and the Office of Civil Rights Census 2000 and or their equivalents will be eliminated from the Fund and may be billed through the Advances and Reimbursements Account [`A and R' account].
<p>Further, the Committee notes that certain A and R projects have become permanent activities carried out by the Office of the Secretary, and, therefore, should be funded through, and subject to the scrutiny of the Appropriations process. As such, External Affairs, White House Liaison, Executive Support, Cultural Awareness, and Commerce, Government Performance and Results Act project, will be eliminated from the A and R account and the activities funded by these projects shall not be charged or billed to the Department's bureaus The Committee has recommended a total amount of $3,660,000 in the Departmental Management appropriation to fund these activities. This amount is commensurate with the level of funding planned for payment by the bureaus to these activities.
<p>Electronic Commerce, Regional Economic Growth, Class Action Suit, Diversity Employment Plan, MSI Financial Assistance and Grant Promotion Activities, MSI Conferences, Executive Assistance Management Information Technology Activities, Pioneer Fund, COMMITS, Executive Direction Support, Celebrate Department of Commerce, and Telecommuting will not be funded out of the A and R account.
<p>The USA Trade Center, Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center project will be eliminated from the Departmental A and R account and responsibility for administering the project activities shall be transferred to the International Trade Administration.
<p>In future budget submissions, the Department will submit and display the A and R project listing and the Fund project listings and associated dollar and FTE requests as part of the Congressional budget request. The Committee directs that the Department ensure that WCF budget estimates for upcoming fiscal year be provided to bureau clients no later than October 1 each fiscal year.

<p>The Committee recommends an appropriation of $21,176,000 for the Commerce Department's Office of the Inspector General. The recommendation is identical to the budget request.
<p><h3>GENERAL PROVISIONS--DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE</h3>
<p>The Committee includes the following general provisions for the Department of Commerce that were included in the fiscal year 2001 appropriations act.  Sections 201 through 208 are continuations of language included in previous appropriations acts.
<p>Section 201 makes Commerce Department funds available for advanced payments only upon certification of officials designated by the Secretary that such payments are considered to be in the public interest.
<p>Section 202 makes appropriations for salaries and expenses available for the hire of passenger motor vehicles, and for services, uniforms, and allowances as authorized by law.
<p>Section 203 prohibits any funds to be used to support hurricane reconnaissance aircraft and activities that are under the control of the U.S. Air Force or the U.S. Air Force Reserve.
<p>Section 204 provides the authority to transfer funds between Department of Commerce accounts. The language provides that no account may be decreased by more than 5 percent or increased by more than 10 percent. The language also makes the transfers subject to the Committee's standard reprogramming procedures.
<p>Section 205 allows the Secretary to award contracts for certain mapping and charting activities in accordance with the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act.
<p>Section 206 allows the Department of Commerce franchise fund to retain a percentage of earnings from services provided for capital investments.
<p>Section 207 permits the Department of Commerce franchise fund to retain a percentage of earnings from services provided for capital investments.
<p>Section 208 provides funding for three grants and a cooperative agreement.
<p>Section 209 makes administrative changes to the Department of Commerce, Working Capital Fund and Advances and Reimbursements account.
<p><h3>TITLE III--THE JUDICIARY</h3>
<p>The funds provided in title III of the accompanying bill are for the operation and maintenance of the U.S. courts and include the salaries of judges, magistrates, supporting personnel, and other expenses of the Federal judiciary.
<p>The Committee recommends a total appropriation of $4,491,578,000 for the judiciary. The recommendation is $381,135,000 below the budget request. The Committee is aware that a total of $235,365,000 in fees, reimbursables, and carryover is available in various accounts across the title.
<p>Steady growth in costs associated with Defender Services, court security, GSA rental payments, and pay and benefits at a time of declining resources is putting serious pressure on the judiciary budget. The Committee urges the judiciary to make every effort to contain mandatory costs.

<p>The Committee recommends an appropriation of $39,988,000 for the Justices, their supporting personnel, and the costs of operating the Supreme Court, excluding the care of the building and grounds. The recommendation is $2,126,000 below the budget request and fully funds current services.
<p>Various offices, a theatre, a gift shop, and mail handling have all been built out into the hallways of the Court in direct violation of fire codes. The expected renovation of the Court will only exacerbate space problems for the foreseeable future. Therefore, the Committee recommendation defers staffing increases until it is clear that there is room for additional personnel. To the degree that the positions sought are needed immediately, including the assistant food preparation specialist, forklift operator, warehousemen, and mail services clerks, the Court may, within existing manpower ceilings, use attrition to alter the skill mix of its workforce.

<p><em>Building renovations</em>- While entirely supportive of the proposal to replace building systems that have been maintained long past the end of their useful service lives, the Committee is very concerned by the linchpin of the Court's construction approach: the digging out of an underground annex as swing space for displaced staff. Better utilization of existing Court space, particularly the conversion of ceremonial or public areas into working offices, presents a far less risky and costly alternative to burrowing under the north wall. Furthermore, space can be made available in the Thurgood Marshall Building. The Committee directs the Architect of the Capitol to develop a plan for installing the necessary building services without recourse to an underground annex. The low-risk, low-cost approach to swing space used for the renovation of the Dirksen Senate Office Building should serve as a model.  The plan should be delivered not later than January 1, 2002. The recommendation funds the routine maintenance of existing building systems in anticipation of a construction start in 2003 under the revised plan.

The recommendation is $176,852,000 below the budget request. The recommendation reflects a refinement of anticipated funding requirements which is $176,852,000 below the budget request. In addition, as noted at the beginning of the title, the Committee understands that up to $70,000,000 in carryover, reimbursables, and fees will be available to apply to this account, if necessary.  Certain mandatory increases for judicial officers are provided.

<p>The Committee recommendations are discussed in more detail in the following paragraphs. The Committee notes that in order to accommodate rental payments, the Committee recommendation necessitates a downward adjustment for support staff.
<p><em>Southwest Border.</em>--In Fiscal Year 2001 the Committee devoted resources to help the hard-hit judicial districts on the Southwest Border. These Federal districts continue to handle over one quarter of all criminal court filings in the United States. While court staffing problems appear to be abating, the number of unfilled judgeships and need for new judgeships remains a persistent concern. To address this issue the Committee has provided $5,000,000 to hire additional magistrate judges along the Southwest border. The Committee directs that a spending and hiring plan and a list of proposed locations be provided to the Committee by no later than February 1, 2002.
<p><em>Juries.</em>--The Committee is concerned with increased plea bargaining, limits on jury awards, and new powers of judges to screen evidence presented to jurors. These factors  are diminishing the traditional role of the jury. The number of Federal criminal and civil cases ending in jury verdicts has fallen more than 58 and 72 percent respectively over the past few decades. Also disturbing is the number of jury verdicts that Federal appeals courts have overturned since 1987. Some estimates calculate that nearly a 40 percent increase has occurred in this area. This trend promises to undermine individual confidence in the jury system and in the courts themselves. The Committee directs the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts to report to the Committee by no later than February 1, 2002, with recommendations delineating what reforms the Federal Judiciary can make to ensure that juror and citizen confidence are not eroded.
<p><em>Relocation report</em>- Prior to opening new offices, the Justice Department is required to seek permission from Congress. In the last relocation report, the Marshals Service sought to open a new office in Lander, WY. The request was denied, because the Marshals were, and are, projected to go anti-deficient due to unexpectedly heavy and prolonged costs associated with security for the World Trade Center and East Africa bombing trials in New York City. The Committee has since learned that a magistrate is holding court in Lander, WY, and that the Marshals opened an office there at the insistence of the magistrate. The Committee acknowledges that court may be held in Lander, but, in light of the Committee's decision on the relocation report, the Judiciary must pay for Marshals support if the magistrate's work requires their presence. Therefore, the Committee recommendation transfers $33,000 from this account to the Marshals to cover their costs in Lander. The Committee understands that similar situations may exist in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and North Carolina. As additional information becomes available, additional costs may be incurred.
<p><em>Protective details</em>- The Committee is aware that a judge vacationing in Switzerland with his extended family forced his protective detail to babysit his very young grandchildren on several occasions. When the detail supervisor objected, the judge `punished' the detail in various ways. Judges are reminded that the taxpayer bears a considerable burden providing portal to portal security. The detail has one assignment and one assignment only: protection. Details are not care givers. In the future, the Committee will not ask the taxpayer to shoulder the costs of protective details if those details are found to be acting as servants.

<p>The Committee recommends an appropriation of $463,756,000. The recommendation is $57,761,000 below the budget request. The recommendation reflects a refinement of anticipated funding requirements.
<p>This account funds the operations of the Federal public defender and community defender organizations and the compensation, reimbursement, and expenses of attorneys appointed to represent persons under the Criminal Justice Act, as amended.
<p>The Committee is very concerned with the requested 19.9 percent increase in funding for this account. While every effort has been made to address the needs expressed by the Judicial Conference, growth of this magnitude cannot be funded within existing Committee resources. Funding is provided to maintain current services and additional funding is provided to increase panel attorney rates of compensation beyond what was provided in fiscal years 2000 and 2001. The new rate is $90 per hour in and out of court. A modest amount is also provided for heavier panel attorney workload. In addition, as noted at the beginning of the title, the Committee understands that up to $70,000,000 in carryover, reimbursables, and fees will be available to apply to this account, if necessary.
<p>The impact of multi-defendant litigation needs to be reassessed. The Committee directs the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts to commence a study to be provided to the Committees on Appropriations by no later than March 1, 2002, examining the feasibility of establishing `firewalls' in existing Federal defender organizations that will allow multi-defendant cases to be handled out of the same office. If these cases can be addressed in this way, concerns about the quality of panel attorney representations should decrease, and substantial savings would assuredly result.

<p>The Committee recommends an appropriation of $50,131,000. The recommendation is identical to the budget request and is a refined estimate of fiscal year 2002 requirements.

<p>The Committee recommends an appropriation of $209,762,000. The recommendation is $18,671,000 below the budget request. The recommendation is based on an estimate by the U.S. Marshals Service of court security requirements and  funds court security personnel, equipment, and perimeter enhancements. The Committee is unable to fully accommodate the 14.5 percent requested increase for this account. The recommendation includes an additional $4,000,000 to maintain courthouse security and replace obsolete systems and equipment. In addition, as noted at the beginning of the title, the Committee understands that up to $70,000,000 in carryover, reimbursables, and fees will be available to apply to this account, if necessary.
<p><em>Radios</em>- Last year, the Administrative Office of U.S. Courts [AO] sought to have its radio program included under the narrowband conversion program run by the Justice Department. Like Justice, the Judiciary must convert VHF radios by January 1, 2005. In a letter to Congress, the AO correctly noted the cost and interoperability benefits of bringing court security radio modernization under the Justice program. Left unsaid was the sad fact that radio funds have been used through the years to cover salaries and expenses, a problem that would be alleviated by shifting control of radio investments to the Wireless Management Office within the Department of Justice. The Committee recommendation includes a provision that transfers $3,580,000 from this account to the `Narrowband Conversion' account in title I to begin the process of converting court security radios.

</table>
<p>Some of the Committee recommendations displayed in the table are described in more detail in the following paragraphs.
<p><em>Diplomatic Security</em>- Explosive growth in Diplomatic Security manning has created an imbalance between seasoned and unseasoned agents that can only be solved with time because the best training available does not compare to the value of experience. In another context, the Attorney General testifies that `it is very risky to allow an agency's overall ratio of inexperienced to experienced agents to exceed 30 percent.' Today, the percentage of Diplomatic Security agents having served 4 years or less is over 30 percent. The Attorney General warned that agencies with excessive numbers of rookie agents `will find it difficult to maintain performance, professionalism and integrity.' Therefore, the Committee does not recommend full funding for an additional 186 Diplomatic Security agents.
<p><em>Diplomatic Readiness</em>- Full funding is provided for hiring an anticipated 700 replacements for attrition. In addition, full funding is provided for all training needs to ensure that new hires have the appropriate language, security, leadership, management, and professional skills needed to be successful in their new assignments.
<p><em>Worldwide security upgrades</em>- The Committee recommendation includes $459,363,000 for worldwide security upgrades, of which $50,000,000 has been made available from prior year unobligated funds available in the `Embassy Security, Construction and Maintenance' account. Of the funding provided, $349,323,000 is for ongoing security activities. In addition, full funding is provided for procedural and technical security enhancements as well as for training, operational support, and infrastructure.  None of the funds provided here for security may be obligated until a complete and thorough accounting of prior year security funds has been forwarded to the Committee.
<p>The Committee is aware of a 2-year, two-city `Weapons of Mass Destruction [WMD] Terrorism Threat Information and Training for First Responders' pilot project of the Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Monterey Institute of International Security to build effective communication and information sharing between Federal and local officials on WMD terrorism issues. The Committee urges the Department of State to support funding for this project.
<p><em>Radios</em>- The Department installed an extensive worldwide radio network with funds provided through the Fiscal Year 1999 Emergency Security Supplemental and is now seeking additional funding for replacement of its domestic wireless networks. By law, the existing wireless networks must convert to 12.5 kilohertz channel spacing by 2005. The Committee recommendation provides $6,000,000 for replacement of the domestic wireless networks in Washington, DC and elsewhere in the United States, used for diplomatic security and law enforcement. Given the Department of Justice Wireless Management Office's expertise in the area of narrowband conversion for law enforcement and addressing issues such as interoperability, the Committee recommendation includes a provision that transfers $6,000,000 from this account to the `Narrowband Conversion' account in Title I to begin the conversion of the State Department's domestic wireless network.
<p><em>Influence</em>- The Committee recommendation includes $1,000,000 out of available funds to continue the Ambassador's Fund for Cultural Preservation. U.S. Ambassadors from underdeveloped countries may submit competitive proposals for one-time or recurring projects with awards based on the importance of the site, the country's need, and the ability to make a meaningful contribution to the preservation of a site, object, or form of expression. The Department is directed to submit a report to the Committees on winning projects on an annual basis.
<p><em>Bureau of Consular Affairs</em>- The Department is directed to report to the Committee on the Bureau of Consular Affairs' programs to assist Americans who have been the victims of violent crimes while traveling or studying overseas. The report shall evaluate the current services provided by the Office of Overseas Citizens Affairs and the adequacy of resources available to it for this purpose. This report shall consider whether and what data should be collected on individual incidents and made available to victims. The report shall also consider whether a database containing information about grants available to assist victims with the high costs associated with the prosecution of a perpetrator in foreign countries--particularly remote or judicially unsophisticated foreign countries is merited. Finally, the report shall determine how best to make this information available to victims. The Committee expects that Internet technology will be utilized to accomplish this.
<p><em>Continuing language education</em>- Language skills are central to the effectiveness of State Department employees abroad, irrespective of assignment. As important, language skills ensure dependents are not overwhelmed by feelings of isolation and alienation, resulting in lowered post morale. The Committee applauds Department efforts to revive continuing language education programs at posts. Within available funds, the Committee recommendation directs that $10,000,000 shall be available only for continuing language education programs for both employees and dependents at posts worldwide. Language classes should also be open to non-State Department (Federal) employees on a space available, reimbursable basis.
<p><em>International conservation of sea turtles</em>- The Committee is concerned with the increasing threat to sea turtles, particularly those listed under the Convention on International Trade on Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora [CITES], from incidental capture by foreign fleets, particularly in the longline fishery. The Secretary of State shall, on an expedited basis, negotiate strong, enforceable management, reporting, and data collection measures (including economic measures) focused on reducing incidental capture of sea turtles in commercial fisheries under regional management agreements for living marine resources, including the Inter-American Sea Turtle Conservation Treaty, the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Convention, the International Convention for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas, and the Convention on the Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (the Multilateral High Level Conference). In addition, the Committee urges the Secretary to develop a trans-Pacific international turtle conservation agreement to include Pacific island and Pacific rim nations. In particular, the Committee urges the Secretary to work with the Secretary of Commerce under Magnuson-Stevens Act Section 202(h), which calls for the Secretary of State, in cooperation with the Secretary of Commerce, to seek international agreements to establish standards and measures for bycatch reduction that are comparable to U.S. standards. In fiscal year 2002 these efforts should focus on longline fishing. In furtherance of this goal, the Secretary of State and Secretary of Commerce, through the National Marine Fisheries Service, shall work with other nations and industry, including the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum, to develop alternative fishing technologies and practices designed to reduce incidental capture mortality of sea turtles, particularly in the international longline fleet. The Secretaries are urged to convene preparatory meetings on gear development, particularly in the Pacific region, prior to the technical workshop scheduled for 2002 to ensure that agreement on alternative gear research and data sharing, including timetables for specific action, can be concluded at this workshop. The State Department and Commerce Department shall report back on the status of these efforts within 90 days of enactment.
<p><em>Pacific salmon treaty implementation</em>- The Committee has provided $45,419,000 to implement the 1999 Pacific Salmon Treaty Agreement. Of this amount, $20,000,000 is for further capitalizing the Northern Boundary Fund, $20,000,000 is for further capitalizing the Southern Boundary Fund, and $5,419,000 is for the State of Washington for obligations pursuant to the 1999 Agreement.
<p>The Committee is concerned that National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) continues to consider further harvest restrictions in Alaska in its efforts to recover some stocks of Pacific salmon. The Committee believes Alaska has made sufficient harvest reductions under the Treaty, and that any further recovery efforts should address other impacts to listed stocks.
<p>Out of funds provided for this purpose, NMFS should continue to work with the State of Alaska in monitoring the effects of the decline of Pacific Northwest-origin salmon on the harvest off Alaska of Alaska-origin salmon.
<p><em>Biotechnology</em>- The Office of Agricultural and Textile Trade Affairs [ATTA], Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs, is playing a critical role in promoting abroad an understanding of the benefits and safety of biotechnology. The Committee is aware that the European Union [EU] has launched a misinformation campaign aimed at scaring regulators and policy makers in the developing world into opposing biotechnology. These scare tactics are intended to help protect the EU's increasingly uncompetitive agricultural sector. The Bureau is directed to provide the support to posts necessary to refute the EU's calumnies regarding biotechnology. Furthermore, the Department is directed to increase the manpower of the ATTA to the level needed both to prepare U.S. negotiators on trade related and food safety talks and to thoroughly educate foreign governments on the importance of biotechnology. In support of the latter, the Committee expects the Department to increase funding for the speaker's program promoting plant biotechnology. Program enhancements should be targeted exclusively at Southeast Asia, Latin America, Africa, and India. The Committee directs the Department, in coordination with the Foreign Commercial Service, to submit a comprehensive plan for supporting biotechnology overseas not later than December 31, 2001.
<p><em>International Trade</em>- Every year the State Department attempts to pursue international trade activities that are clearly within the traditional domain of the Commerce Department's International Trade Administration, particularly within the area of expertise of the United States and Foreign Commercial Service. This continual push by the State Department to expand its jurisdiction in this area runs counter to the wishes of the Committee which notes the expansive and intractable foreign policy issues already confronting the Department. No funding is provided for this initiative.

<p>Some of the Committee recommendations displayed in the table above are described in more detail in the following paragraphs.
<p><em>Diplomatic Telecommunications Service</em>- The Diplomatic Telecommunications Service [DTS] was established in 1992 to create a global telecommunications network for all agencies overseas. A single network was intended to reduce duplication in equipment, staffing, training, and operations, as well as achieve cost savings through economies of scale. The Committee recommendation provides the budget request for DTS to maintain program momentum.
<p><em>Internet Access at Overseas Posts</em>- The Committee commends the Department on reaching its goal of providing e-mail capability to all of its overseas posts through a global network called OpenNet. In contrast to its progress in delivering e-mail capabilities, the Department has been slow in providing Internet access to Department desktops. The Committee is aware of the Department's plan to build upon OpenNet with a system called OpenNet Plus to provide web browsing capabilities. The world wide web has become essential to the conduct of foreign policy. The Committee supports the Secretary's decision to place Information Technology (IT) among the Department's top priorities. Accordingly, the Department's fiscal year 2002 request is fully funded, with the understanding that the target dates for completion of all IT programs will be significantly expedited. The Committee expects OpenNet Plus Internet access to be provided to all State Department desktops by January of 2003. The Department is directed to report to the Committees on Appropriations no later than December 1, 2001 on the status of the implementation of its overall IT plan. At that time, the Department should also be prepared to submit a plan for the overhaul of its classified network, to include a time frame and cost estimates.
<p><em>Common Technology Platform</em>- Last year, the Committee directed the Department to create a common technology platform whereby all agencies operating overseas may communicate and coordinate their activities. This common platform, called the `Collaboration Zone' was among the recommendations of the Overseas Presence Advisory Panel (OPAP). While important, this is not as high a priority as the delivery of Internet capabilities or the upgrading of the classified network. The Department is directed to report to the Committees on Appropriations on the status of this effort by October 1, 2001, at which time the Committee will consider releasing in full the amount provided for this effort in fiscal year 2001.

<p>Some of the Committee recommendations displayed in the table above are described in more detail in the following paragraphs.
<p><em>Overseas educational advising centers</em>- The Committee strongly supports the essential mission of overseas educational advising centers [OEACs] in recruiting international students to study at U.S. colleges and universities. The Committee notes that modest funding for OEACs helped leverage $12,000,000,000 in spending by international students and their dependents in communities and higher education institutions throughout the United States in the academic year 1999-2000. In the Committee's view, OEACs must receive adequate funding to keep pace with increasing competition from other nations to attract foreign students.
<p><em>Foreign policy priority</em>- The Committee recognizes that international education--imparting global literacy to students and other citizens as an integral part of their education--is important to ensure our nation's ability to meet key challenges, including national security and the management of global conflict, competitiveness in the global market, and an increasingly multi-cultural society. The Committee suggests the Department of State, in cooperation with the Department of Education and other agencies with exchange programs, give higher priority to international education and raise its level of importance on the national agenda. In particular, the Committee urges the Department of State, the Department of Commerce, and the Department of Justice through the Immigration and Naturalization Service to coordinate efforts to promote U.S. exchange programs and U.S. higher education abroad and to remove unnecessary barriers for exchange visitors and students seeking access to the U.S. exchange programs and higher education institutions.
<p><em>Seed programs</em>- The Committee has continued a modest program begun in fiscal year 2000 that provides one-time funding to international exchange startups. These new programs are expected, after their first year, to seek funding from outside sources. The Committee will track the survival rate of new starts. The Bureau of Educational and Cultural Exchanges is directed to provide advice and assistance to these new programs and to inform the Committee immediately of any change in their status.
<p><em>Cultural, Educational, and Technical Exchanges to Africa</em>- Performances by touring U.S. dance and music troupes have afforded our diplomats unusual access to oft-times elusive senior policymakers in Africa. At the same time, the lure of technological innovation, especially the explosion of the Internet, afford American educators and entrepeneurs a rare opportunity to develop lasting links with African elites. In particular, the potential appears to exist to establish a `virtual university' in Africa that could prove critical to literacy and economic development programs continent-wide. The Committee recommendation provides $750,000 to revive Federal support for touring companies as a means of expanding and deepening diplomatic contacts throughout Africa, to establish Internet-centric educational and workforce development programs, and to explore the feasibility of establishing a virtual university in Africa.

<p>The Committee recommends an appropriation of $10,000,000. The recommendation is identical to the budget request.
<p>The Committee directs that local jurisdictions that incur such costs submit a certified billing for such costs in accordance with program regulations. The Committee also recommends that in those circumstances where a local jurisdiction will realize a financial benefit from a visit from a foreign dignitary through increased tax revenues, that such circumstances should be taken into account by the Department in assessing the need for reimbursement under this program. The Committee expects the Department to treat such submissions diligently and provide reimbursement to local jurisdictions on a timely basis if claims are fully justified.

<p>Some of the Committee recommendations displayed in the table above are described in more detail in the following paragraphs.
<p><em>Cost savings</em>- By scrubbing the costs for a number of pending construction projects, the leadership of the Office of Building Operations [OBO] was able to identify significant savings. The Committee commends the work of the OBO and believes that similar savings can be achieved with projects proposed for fiscal year 2002. The recommendation adjusts the funding levels of certain capital projects in anticipation of an OBO cost review of these projects. The Committee expects OBO to present its results on a project by project basis as part of the reprogramming process.
<p><em>Unobligated balances</em>- The Committee is aware that the Office of Overseas Building Operations [OBO] is holding large unobligated balances. The Department's continued resistance to executing certain Congressionally-designated projects, such as those in Jerusalem and Taipei, and Congressional denial of a number of ill-considered projects, affords the Committee the opportunity to apply prior year funds to current year projects, thus saving direct appropriations this year.
<p><em>Moscow, Russia</em>- Over 26 agencies currently are using the Old Embassy Building in Moscow, Russia. The Old Embassy Building is rapidly deteriorating and posing life and health concerns for the personnel which are still located in the facility. Additionally, the building is within 15 feet of one of Moscow's busiest thoroughfares and has been frequently and violently attacked during the past 5 years. The United States and Russia share numerous vital interests, including preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the long-term integration of a democratic Russia into global economic and financial institutions, and engaging Russia on a broad range of foreign policy issues, including the United Nations and the Middle East peace process. Given these shared interests, the Committee recommendation provides $95,890,000 for design, site preparation, and construction of a new Unclassified Annex.
<p><em>Family security</em>- As part of the overall response to the worldwide security threat to U.S. personnel abroad, the Committee recommendation includes $6,250,000 to enhance the security of post housing and overseas American schools. The Committee expects to be consulted prior to the release of these funds.
<p><em>Buyout of uneconomic leases</em>- High lease costs deplete Department resources. The Committee supports efforts by the Department to selectively acquire properties in cities with volatile rental markets, thus generating significant out-year savings. The Committee recommendation provides $35,000,000 for opportunity purchases.
<p><em>Marine security guards</em>- The Committee recommendation does not include funding to expand the number of Marine security guards at embassies, since the current state of guard housing is deplorable. Instead, the Committee recommendation provides $10,050,000 to repair and improve existing Marine houses and posts or acquire new housing.
<p>The Department is directed to submit, and receive approval for, only those projects or subaccounts funded under this account, whether from direct appropriations or proceeds of sales, that deviate from the financial plan outlined above. Any proposed deviations shall include project-level detail, and shall be provided to the Appropriations Committees not later than 60 days after the date of enactment of this Act. Any deviation from the above plan shall be treated as a reprogramming in the case of an addition greater than $500,000 or as a notification in the case of a deletion, a project cost overrun exceeding 25 percent, or a project schedule delay exceeding 6 months. Notification requirements also extend to the `rebaselining' of a given project's cost estimate, schedule, or scope of work.

<p>Some of the Committee recommendations displayed in the table above are described in more detail in the following paragraphs.
<p><em>Synchronization of United States and United Nations budget years</em>- Twenty years ago a decision was made to put the United States and United Nations budget years out of alignment. The budget year of the United Nations begins in January. Prior to this change, Administration requests sought funding for U.N. dues in the fiscal year beginning in the October prior to dues being due. After this change, funding for U.N. dues have been sought in the fiscal year beginning in the October after dues are due. This 9 month delay in annual payment of U.N. regular dues has caused difficulties for 20 years. The United Nations frequently chides the United States for being in `arrears' for the period between the bill for dues being received and being paid. This has had a negative impact on relations between Congress and the United Nations. The Committee is aware that there are reasons enough for discord between Congress and the United Nations without additional bookkeeping challenges adding to the list. Therefore, the recommendation provides the funds necessary to synchronize the U.S. payment of U.N. regular dues with the U.N. budget year.
<p><em>Spending decreases</em>- The recommendation assumes exchange rate savings due to the continuing strength of the U.S. dollar. The recommendation also anticipates approval of a reprogramming involving $14,900,000 in fiscal year 2001 `Contribution to International Organizations' [CIO] funds that will be used to partially prepay U.N. regular budget assessments for calendar year 2001 by a like amount.
<p><em>International Civil Aviation Organization</em>- The Committee recognizes the need for increased aviation safety and security throughout the world and commends the progress that the International Civil Aviation Organization [ICAO] has made. In view of the importance of ICAO's work to the United States and the rapid growth of international civil aviation, the Committee recommendation provides the necessary funding for the United States to continue to pay its 25 percent assessment. The Committee recommendation includes the additional budgetary resources necessary for the new and expanded programs in safety and security undertaken by the ICAO.

<p>This account funds U.S. payments for contributions for international peacekeeping activities.
<p>The Committee recommends an appropriation of $773,182,000. The recommendation is $70,957,000 below the budget request.
<p><em>Sierra Leone</em>- The Revolutionary United Front [RUF] has had several opportunities, including three cease fire agreements, to demonstrate its commitment to peace, and each time it has merely used the hiatus in the conflict as an opportunity to regroup and redeploy its forces. The Committee is concerned that the recent willingness of the RUF to honor the May 2001 ceasefire is nothing more than the continuation of the same old practice and the RUF does not desire peace, but rather fears that the Guinean army poses a serious threat to its survival. The RUF is effectively using the United Nations Peacekeeping mission to Sierra Leone [UNAMSIL] as a shield against the Guinean army. Although the Committee supports the deployment of U.N. peacekeepers to the areas of Sierra Leone most in need, it remains skeptical of the RUF's motives for allowing it to do so. The Committee considers the five principles laid out by the former U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. to the Committee to form the basis of U.S. policy. These five principles are: prevent rebel groups from having a role in government; support the British military presence; give regional and international forces and the Sierra Leonean Army [SLA] the capacity to disrupt RUF control of the diamond-producing areas; assist the government of Sierra Leone with institution-building; and develop a strategy for dealing with the current Liberian government. Therefore, concurrent to the submission of a spend plan under Section 605, the Department of State is directed to provide the Committee written assurance that neither the U.N. nor the Government of Sierra Leone has made a promise of a political role for current or former members of the RUF or of amnesty to the same.
<p><em>Twenty-Five Percent Cap</em>- Funding is provided to meet fully U.S. assessments to UN peacekeeping operations at a level that is consistent with the current legislative cap of 25 percent imposed by section 404 of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, fiscal years 1994 and 1995. When legislation is enacted to lift or modify this restriction, the Committee will consider through the regular reprogramming process a request by the Department to reallocate funding. This reprogramming would permit the United States to meet its full assessment obligations.
<p><em>East Timor</em>- The Committee is aware that, in anticipation of the East Timor's independence vote, scheduled for August 2001, the Department has requested to open a U.S. post in Dili, East Timor. While the Committee recognizes the eventual need for a U.S. presence in East Timor, it believes that the process should proceed prudently. The situation in East Timor, despite the relative success of the U.N. Transitional Administration in East Timor [UNTAET], remains highly unstable. East Timor continues to be the third largest peacekeeping initiative funded in the `Contributions for International Peacekeeping Activities' account with over 15 percent of the funding in this account directed toward the mission. The uncertainty surrounding East Timor's path to independence gives this Committee pause about sanctioning American people and assets to East Timor while it is still unclear how they might be received. The Department is therefore directed to report to the Committee on the situation in East Timor by January 1, 2002, at which time the Committee will reconsider the request.

<p>Some of the Committee recommendations displayed in the table above are described in more detail in the following paragraphs.
<p><em>Post-Independence Agreement with the Department of State</em>- The Committee is concerned by the lack of progress towards reaching an agreement between the BBG and Department of State formalizing `post-independence' actions and responsibilities of the BBG toward the Department. The Committee directs that, within 6 months of the date of enactment of this Act, the BBG and Department of State shall have signed a memorandum of understanding that delineates a formal arrangement for providing services to the Department and reimbursement for the cost of such services.
<p><em>Expansion of Broadcasting Capabilities</em>- The Committee is aware that the Department of State is looking to enhance its own broadcasting capabilities, a program decision which carries with it the potential for overlap with current BBG services. The Department is directed to report to the Committee on its reasoning for requesting additional transmission and production services.
<p><em>Shifting requirements</em>- The Committee believes an opportunity exists to reach important and isolated minorities in the Northern Caucasus. RFE/RL has in the past broadcast in native languages to this region. The Committee believes that doing so today would not be financially prohibitive, and further believes that the Chechen crisis has created a genuine need in this region for objective, uncensored information. The Committee directs RFE/RL to expand broadcasting to the Northern Caucasus and to develop programming in Avar, Chechen, and Circassian. To the degree desirable, RFE/RL should exploit VOA-TV assets. RFE/RL shall report back to the Committee on this effort not later than February 14, 2002.
<p>The Committee recommendation includes a $1,000,000 increase over the budget request for Radio Free Asia to increase daily Uyghur broadcasts. Radio Free Asia's Uyghur broadcasts are proving successful in northwest China in spite of top level officials efforts to erect `a steel wall' against `hostile radio stations from abroad.'
<p><em>Africa Broadcasting</em>- The Committee is concerned with Voice of America's proposal to reduce funding for its Africa Division. Given the political instability in numerous countries, and given the impact AIDS is having on the entire continent, funding for Africa Broadcasting should be increasing. Within available funds, the Committee recommendation includes $10,000,000 for Africa broadcasting. VOA shall report back to the Committee on its AIDS education related broadcasting activities no later than March 22, 2002.

<p><h3>GENERAL PROVISIONS--DEPARTMENT OF STATE AND RELATED AGENCIES</h3>
<p>The Committee recommends the following general provisions:
<p>Section 401 permits funds appropriated in this act for the Department of State to be available for allowances and differentials, services, and hire of passenger transportation.
<p>Section 402 permits up to 5 percent of any appropriation made available in the bill for the Department of State and the U.S. Information Agency to be transferred between their respective appropriations. The language also provides that no appropriation shall be decreased by more than 5 percent or increased by more than 10 percent by any such transfer. In addition, the language provides that any transfer pursuant to this subsection shall be treated as a reprogramming of funds under section 605 of the accompanying bill and shall not be available for obligation or expenditure except in compliance with the procedures set forth in that section.
<p>Section 403 prohibits the use of Department of State funds to support the Palestinian Broadcasting Corp.
<p>Section 404 limits the fundraising ability of criminal groups trafficking in `conflict' diamonds.
<p>Section 405 prohibits the United Nations, or any of its specialized agencies, from imposing a tax on the Internet or international currency transactions.
<p>Section 406 requires that a consulate or diplomatic facility in Jerusalem be under the supervision of the U.S. Ambassador to Israel.
<p>Section 407 requires government publications to list Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.
<p>Section 408 allows Israel to be recorded as the place of birth on registrations of birth, certifications of nationality, and passport applications for U.S. citizens born in Jerusalem.

<p>The Maritime Administration [MarAd] in the Department of Transportation is responsible for administering several programs for the maritime industry relating to U.S. foreign and domestic commerce and for national defense purposes.
<p>The Committee recommends a total appropriation of $291,732,000, which is $188,700,000 above budget request. The Committee's recommendations for specific accounts are described below.
<p>The Committee is concerned about foreign-owned hopper dredge vessels, which were grandfathered by the Oceans Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-587), inappropriately expanding their domestic operations and unfairly disadvantaging the domestic industry. The Committee directs the Administrator to review charters of vessels engaged in dredging in the navigable waters of the United States, in particular charterers who are not citizens of the United States under section 2 of the Shipping Act, 1916, in order to ensure that they are in compliance with current law and the intent of Congress.

<p>The Committee recommends an appropriation of $98,700,000.  The recommendation is $98,700,000 above the budget request. The Committee notes that the budget request recommended that jurisdiction over the Maritime Security Program be shifted to the Department of the Navy. The Committee does not recommend such a move.
<p>The Maritime Security program maintains a U.S.-flag merchant fleet crewed by U.S. citizens who serve both the commercial and national security needs of the United States. The Committee's recommendation fully funds the 47 ships authorized to participate in this program.

<p>The Committee recommends an appropriation of $89,054,000. The recommendation is identical to the budget request.
<p>This account funds operations of the Maritime Administration [MarAd], the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, and provides grants to State maritime academies.
<p>The recommendation includes $47,822,000 for the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy and $7,457,000 for the State maritime schools. Within the amounts provided for the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, $3,000,000 is included to reduce the maintenance and repair backlog at the Academy, and to begin to make needed capital improvements. Within the amounts for State maritime schools, $1,200,000 is for student incentive payments, $1,200,000 is for direct scholarship payments, and $5,057,000 is for schoolship maintanence and repair. The Committee notes that MarAd anticipates using $2,000,000 in Ready Reserve funds to support the schoolship maintenance and repair program.

</table>
<p>The Committee recommends an appropriation of $103,978,000. The recommendation is $100,000,000 above the budget request and assumes administrative expenses of $3,978,000.
<p>The Maritime Guaranteed Loan Program (title XI) provides subsidies for guaranteed loans for purchasers of vessels built in U.S. shipyards and includes the guarantee for facilities or equipment pertaining to marine operations related to any of those vessels.
<p>The Committee is concerned that the Administration did not request a title XI subsidy for fiscal year 2002. Projects currently under consideration, and many future maritime projects would be in jeopardy under this proposal. The recommended subsidy amount, when combined with $5,000,000 in anticipated carryover balances, should provide sufficient funding to cover expected out-year requirements.

<p>The Committee recommends an appropriation of $489,000. This amount is equal to the budget request. The recommendation will allow the Commission to fund its administrative expenses through appropriated funds while relying on privately donated funds for the actual purchase and restoration of property.
<p>The purpose of the Commission is to encourage the preservation of cemeteries, monuments, and historic buildings associated with the foreign heritage of the American people.
<p><em>Revolutionary War heroes</em>- In recognition of the 225th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence, the Commission is directed to develop a plan for the preservation and interpretation of sites associated with the lives and deeds of foreign-born heroes of the American Revolution, including, but not limited to, John Barry, Thaddeus Kosciusko, the Comtes d'Estaing, de Grasse, and de Rochambeau, Baron Johann De Kalb, Count Casimir Pulaski, Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben, John Paul Jones, and Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette.

<p>The Committee recommends an appropriation of $252,545,000 for the salaries and expenses of the Federal Communications Commission [FCC], of which $218,757,000 is to be derived from collection of existing fees. The remaining $33,788,000 is provided from direct appropriations. The recommendation is $4,000,000 above the budget request. The Committee recommendation includes $10,997,000 for the FCC's Information Technology requirements and initiatives. This funding will provide for continued support and critical improvements for existing systems, and will ensure compliance with government-wide standards pertaining to system security, accessibility and financial management. The funding will impact on all five key FCC activities, which includes licensing, competition, enforcement, consumer information, and spectrum management.
<p>The FCC is an independent agency charged with regulating interstate and foreign communications, including radio, television, wire, wireless, cable, and satellite. The FCC's primary mission is to promote competition, innovation, and deregulation in the communications industry. The U.S. communications markets will be characterized predominately by competition and innovation over the next 5 years that will greatly reduce the need for direct regulation and increase the need for the FCC to maintain an independent technical engineering and economic expertise. The advent of Internet-based and other new technology-driven communications services will continue to erode the traditional regulatory distinctions between different sectors of the communications industry.
<p><em>Enforcement and Consumer Access</em>- Vigorous enforcement is a fundamental prerequisite for competitive markets and expeditious dispute resolution. Enforcement remains vital but is most effective when fully and fairly implemented. Similarly, effective consumer information programs are essential during this period. Consumers must become familiar with the myriad new communications options and providers available, as well as the new demands which emerge from the advent of increased competition. Where competition does not ensure access for all Americans to communications services, the FCC will continue to promote universal service and other public interest policies to further the goal of ensuring all Americans have access to telecommunications tools.
<p><em>Excellence in Engineering</em>- The Committee recommends $4,000,000 for the Excellence in Engineering program. The purpose of the program is to reestablish the engineering preeminence of the Commission so that it is more fluent in technology than the entities it regulates.
<p><em>Broadcast television standards</em>- The Committee is concerned about the declining standards of broadcast television and the impact this decline is having on America's children. An analysis of all prime-time programming has found that overall sexual content, foul language and violence have tripled over the past decade. In December 1999, the FCC issued a notice of inquiry regarding the public interest obligations of broadcasters during and after the transition to digital transmission. The Committee directs the FCC to continue to report to Congress on the issues associated with resurrecting a broadcast industry code of conduct for content of programming that, if adhered to by the broadcast industry, would protect against the further erosion of broadcasting standards.

<p>The Federal Trade Commission [FTC] administers a variety of Federal antitrust and consumer protection laws. Activities in the antitrust area include detection and elimination of illegal collusion, anticompetitive mergers, unlawful single-firm conduct, and injurious vertical agreements. The FTC regulates advertising practices, service industry practices, marketing practices, and credit practices as it addresses fraud and other consumer concerns.
<p>The Committee recommends an appropriation of $156,270,000. The recommendation is identical to the budget request. The Committee recommendation for fiscal year 2002 provides funding for a total of 1,080 full time equivalents. The requested program level will be fully funded by fees assessed on Hart-Scott-Rodino Act premerger notification filings as authorized by section 605 of Public Law 101-162.
<p><em>Child Protection</em>- The FTC released a report last year that was very critical of the entertainment industry and their persistent and calculated marketing of violent games, movies, and music to children. In response to this report the entertainment industry has promised to place tougher regulations on itself and voluntarily comply with the report's recommendations. The Committee believes that the FTC should continue and expand its efforts in this area and directs the Commission to engage in the following three initiatives in fiscal year 2002.
<p>(1) <em>Consumer Research and Workshops</em>- The Committee directs that $500,000 be provided to conduct focus group and survey research involving parents, retailers, and others involved in children's entertainment activities. From these sessions it is hoped that the FTC will be able to determine how best to deliver messages to consumers through retail outlets in the most efficient way.
<p>(2) <em>Underage Shopper-Retail Compliance Survey</em>- The Committee directs that $275,000 be provided for the FTC to contract with an outside firm to conduct an additional `mystery shopper' survey. The study should be expanded to include the children's purchase and rental of R-rated movie videos.
<p>(3) <em>Marketing Data Collection</em>- The Committee directs that $135,000 be provided to ensure that the entertainment industry is living up to its promises. The FTC is directed to contract with a video monitoring, news clipping, and movie trailer service to record television shows, family hour programing, movies, and to clip magazines and newspapers to check for inappropriate ad placements and disclosure of rating information. In addition, actual products should be purchased to ensure that rating, label, and lyric information is properly and adequately disclosed.
<p><em>Competition</em>- The FTC's Maintaining Competition Mission is aimed at fostering and preserving our competitive market. The goal of the competition mission is to prevent anticompetitive business practices in the marketplace. The mission works to accomplish this goal by identifying and stopping anticompetitive mergers, and by preventing consumer injury through education. Mergers that are anticompetitive can drive up consumer prices by millions of dollars every year and can significantly diminish output, product quality, innovation, and consumer choice. To identify anticompetitive mergers, the FTC relies primarily on the premerger notification required by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. To distinguish between mergers that threaten free markets and those likely to promote them, the FTC uses sophisticated economic analysis and thorough factual investigation.
<p><em>Consumer Protection</em>- The FTC is charged with eliminating unfair or deceptive acts or practices affecting commerce. The goal of the consumer protection mission is to prevent fraud, deception, and unfair business practices in the marketplace. The mission works to accomplish this goal by identifying fraud, deception and unfair practices that cause the greatest consumer injury, by stopping these actions through law enforcement, and by preventing consumer injury through education. Staff in the FTC's eight regions support the consumer protection mission by bringing a wide variety of consumer protection cases in various programs and acting as contacts for State Attorneys General and other State and local consumer protection officials.
<p><em>Internet</em>- The FTC is charged with monitoring compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. The Committee's recommendation ensures the agency is adequately prepared to meet the challenges of increased fraud on the Internet and the agency's recognition that Internet fraud is an international phenomenon since the Internet has no borders.

<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission [SEC] is an independent agency responsible for administering many of the Nation's laws regulating the areas of securities and finance.
<p>The Committee recommendation provides total budget (obligational) authority of $514,047,000. The recommended amount of budget authority is $76,147,000 above the budget request.
<p>The recommendation assumes passage of the fee reduction provisions of S. 143. This legislation will result in significant reductions in SEC transaction, registration, and merger and tender offering fee rates. In fiscal year 2002, the Section 31 transaction fee rate will decline from roughly $33 per million (1/300th of 1 percent) to $15 per million, more than a 50 percent reduction. In addition, the Section 6(b) registration fee rate will decline from $250 per million (1/40th of 1 percent) to $92 per million, a reduction of nearly 63 percent. The fees associated with merger and tender offerings also will decline to $92 per million. Fees collected from all three of these sources will be made available to this appropriation as offsetting collections. The Committee's recommendation assumes that $404,547,300 in fees collected in fiscal year 2001 and $109,500,000 in fees collected in fiscal year 2002 will be available as offsetting collections.
<p>For fiscal year 2002 the Committee continues to emphasize the importance of the Office of Economic Analysis within the Commission and expects adequate funds be provided in order to carry out these functions. The Committee recommends bill language, similar to that included in previous appropriations acts, which: (1) allows for the rental of space; (2) makes up to $3,000 available for official reception and representation expenses; (3) makes up to $10,000 available for a permanent secretariat for the International Organization of Securities Commissions; and (4) makes up to $100,000 available for governmental and regulatory officials.
<p><em>Internet Fraud</em>- The Commission's Internet enforcement program has proven extremely successful. Internet fraud cases represent a growing proportion of the SEC's caseload, increasing from four percent in 1998 to sixteen percent in 2000. There have been 220 cases involving Internet fraud against 760 persons and entities. The Committee encourages the SEC to continue to aggressively carry out the multifaceted program of enforcement actions, Internet surveillance of publicly accessible areas of the Internet only, staff training in Internet investigative techniques, maintenance of the online Enforcement Complaint Center, and joint education and training sessions on Internet investigations for other Federal, State SRO and international regulators. The Committee also encourages the SEC to continue to cooperate with the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice, and other Federal agencies to maximize coordination and the efficiency of all Federal programs targeted at Internet fraud.

<p>The Committee recommends a direct appropriation of $333,233,000 for the salaries and expenses of the Small Business Administration. The recommendation is $12,014,000 above the budget request. The Committee does not recommend funding for the SBA's systems modernization initiative. The Committee has, in past years, provided $32,000,000 for this purpose, of which $8,000,000 remains unobligated. The Committee is aware that SBA has used funding appropriated for the Systems Modernization Initiative for other purposes. Further, the SBA moved funds out of the Systems Modernization Initiative without a reprogramming request as is required under Section 605 of this Act. The SBA has obligated $8,000,000 from prior year appropriations in the Federal System Integration and Management Center account (FEDSIM) to be held until projects are ready for acquisition. The Committee recommendation reduces the SBA Salaries and Expenses account by $8,000,000. The Committee recommends that SBA submit a reprogramming request to move funds from the FEDSIM account to the Salaries and Expenses account if it wishes to make up the difference in funding. Also, the Committee does not recommend funding for the workforce transition.
<p>The Committee recommendation includes requested language authorizing $3,500 for official reception and representation expenses and language authorizing SBA to charge fees to cover the cost of publications and certain loan servicing activities.
<p><h2>NON-CREDIT BUSINESS ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS</h2>
<p>For SBA's non-credit business assistance programs, the Committee recommends an appropriation of $183,914,000. The Committee recommends the following amounts for these programs:

</table>
<p>The Committee believes the Small Business Development Centers (SBDCs) provide useful services to small businesses nationwide. Federal funding of the SBDC program constitutes the seed funding for the program, which is leveraged one or two times by State, local, and private funds. In the fiscal year 2002 budget request, the administration is proposing that the SBDCs be required to collect fees from small business owners and entrepreneurs to reduce the annual appropriation by $12,207,000. Section 502(d) of the Small Business Reauthorization Act of 1997 prohibits the SBDCs from imposing or collecting fees in connection with the small business counseling services provided by the program. The Committee recommends that this prohibition should not be rescinded or modified, and further recommends that $88,000,000 be provided for this program.
<p>The Committee has in the past provided funding to the SBA to reimburse the Census Bureau for costs of conducting the regular Census Survey of Women Business. Data from this survey is critical to implementing the set-aside authority through the SBA Office of Federal Contract Assistance for Women. The Committee recommendation provides no funding for this survey through the SBA account, but instead provides the requested level of $694,000 through the Bureau of Census account. The Committee directs the Census Bureau to provide the SBA with the data that it collects in conducting this survey.
<p>The Committee is aware that there are instances in several cities where Business Information Centers and U.S. Export Assistance Centers are located in separate sites within blocks of each other, rather than in a single location. The Committee recommends that these centers be collocated whenever and wherever possible with the Small Business Development Centers. To this effect, the Committee directs the SBA to provide a plan no later than January 15, 2002 on how it plans collocations.
<p>The Committee notes that information regarding the use, services and merits of One Stop Capital Shops [OSCS] is limited. SBA reports that the OSCS counseled 43,000 people last year and yet this resulted in only 430 loans. One percent is not an impressive return for a program designed to provide access to capital. The Committee observes that the efforts of OSCS are duplicative of other more established SBA programs and recommends no funding for this program for fiscal year 2002.
<p>The Committee recommendation provides funding of $20,000,000 for the Microloan Technical Assistance Program and $15,000,000 for the PRIME technical assistance program. The Committee believes the PRIME program has great promise for providing assistance to the entrepreneurs who have no access to capital and has a training component for assisting these small businesses which is missing in some of the other SBA assistance programs.
<p>The Committee recommendation includes $7,000,000 for BusinessLINC and $3,500,000 for Drug-Free Workplace Grants.
<p>The Committee recommends $1,500,000 for Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) technical assistance and $3,500,000 for the Federal and State Technology Partnership Program (FAST). The FAST program encourages organizations in States to assist in the development of small high-technology businesses. The Committee believes that increasing the overall participation in the SBIR program by high-technology small businesses will ultimately lead to an overall increase in the quality of SBIR proposals and completed projects.
<p>The Committee recommends an appropriation of $4,000,000 for the National Veterans' Business Development Corporation, as authorized by Public Law 106-50. The Committee has, for the first time, recommended this amount as a separate appropriation found elsewhere in the bill. The Committee recommends the request of $750,000 for Veteran's Business Development Assistance.

<p>The Committee recommends an appropriation of $11,000,000 for the Office of Inspector General of the Small Business Administration. The recommendation is $927,000 below the budget request. The Committee directs the Inspector General's office to continue the activities outlined in the fiscal year 2001 Senate report, and expects the office to report on its progress in reviewing and auditing the agency's financial management systems. The bill contains language making $500,000 available to the Inspector General's office from funds made available to the disaster loan program for its activities.

<p>The Committee recommends an appropriation of $224,360,000 for the business loans program account. The recommendation is $93,860,000 above the budget request. Of the amount provided, $129,000,000 is for administrative expenses related to this account. The administrative expenses may be transferred to and merged with SBA salaries and expenses to cover the common overhead expenses associated with the business loan programs.
<p>The Committee recommendation includes an appropriation of $93,500,000 to support a $10,700,000,000 7(a) loan program. This assumes a subsidy rate of 1.07 percent and a carryover balance of $21,000,000. The small business community is dependent on the SBA 7(a) program to obtain long-term financing at a competitive interest rate. Each year, 40,000 or more small business concerns, who cannot obtain comparable credit elsewhere, turn to the 7(a) program for critical financing. Currently, both the borrowers and the lenders pay significant fees to the SBA to help offset the credit subsidy cost necessary to underwrite the program. The budget request seeks to increase the fees paid by borrowers and lenders to offset the need for an annual appropriation. The net result of the Administration's budget request would be to drive both the small business borrowers and lenders from the program. Furthermore, the Committee believes the SBA should achieve a goal of a zero subsidy rate for the 7(a) loan program. However, the same result can be achieved by a comprehensive review of subsidy cost estimates for the 7(a) program. Previous reports from the GAO indicate that subsidy costs have been inflated. OMB estimates of the subsidy cost of the 7(a) program consistently show execution rates are inflated. This could lead to the overcharging of small business owners. The Committee believes that the 7(a) program is already operating near a zero subsidy rate and that the budget request should contain a one-time accurate accounting change to reflect that reality. The Committee recommends that this one-time accounting change be reflected in future budget requests. The Senate includes bill language requiring the SBA to submit a reprogramming under section 605 if the agency wishes to exceed a program level of $10,000,000,000. The recommendation includes $1,860,000 in subsidy budget authority for the Microloan program, which will support a program level of approximately $25,500,000 in fiscal year 2002, assuming a subsidy rate of 6.78 percent. The Committee recommendation provides no funding for funds guaranteed by the SBA under the SBIC programs. The SBIC programs are a unique partnership of public and private funds in which SBA-guaranteed funds supplement the capital of private venture capital investment firms. The budget request recommends increasing fees paid by the SBICs to offset the annual appropriation needed to fund the debentures guaranteed under the SBIC Participating Security program. This change would require an increase from 1.0 percent to 1.37 percent to the annual interest surcharge paid by the SBICs to the SBA on their outstanding balances of the SBA-guaranteed investment funds. The Committee concurs with the budget request on this matter. This will allow for a $3,500,000,000 program level, as authorized.

Of the amount provided, $79,510,000 is for direct loan subsidies. This amount, combined with carryover and recoveries of $37,850,000 will provide for a program level of $800,000,000. The remaining $125,354,000 is made available for administrative expenses for the program, and can be merged with the agency's salaries and expenses account.
<p><h2>ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS</h2>
<p>The Committee wishes to underscore the reprogramming requirements outlined in section 605. This recommendation includes an administrative provision in the bill language, as in last year's bill, providing the authority to transfer funds between the Small Business Administration's appropriations accounts. The language provides that no account may be decreased by more than 5 percent or increased by more than 10 percent. The language also makes the transfers subject to the Committee's standard reprogramming procedures under section 605. In addition, a reprogramming notification is required in any proposed organization, whether or not funding transfers will be associated with the proposed reorganization.
