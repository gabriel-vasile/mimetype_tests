<P>The dozen years that followed the Brooks Expedition would set the
pieces of the frame for the Denali region's future. Three men&#151;Judge
James Wickersham, Charles Sheldon, and Harry Karstens&#151;would emerge
as the moving forces whose interaction would create the park-refuge
idea, carry it through to legislative enactment, then pioneer the new
park on the ground.</P>

<P>Wickersham made the first attempt to ascend the mountain, one year
after Brooks had gazed along its precipitous slopes. In so doing, the
judge launched a heroic chapter in mountaineering, peopled by literate
adventurers whose exploration and climbing accounts make a fascinating
history of truth, falsehood, controversy, and final summit achievement.
In aggregate, their published descriptions made Mount McKinley and its
game-rich forelands household symbols of the Alaskan wild.</P>

<P>The placer mining claims that Wickersham's party staked in the
Kantishna Hills, on the way to the mountain, created a minor gold rush
that evolved into a long-term mining community whose hospitality and
knowledge of the country would support and inform successive expeditions
of mountaineers, hunters, and explorers.</P>

<P>The isolated miners of Kantishna and neighboring mining districts
would seek government assistance to make their mining profitable and
their lives more civilized. These demands contributed to government
development of trail, mail, and rail services in the Denali
region&#151;the basic infrastructure that would in time provide access
to Mount McKinley National Park.</P>

<P>The shared concerns of Charles Sheldon and Harry Karstens over the
market hunting of Denali's game animals to supply mining camps and
future railroad construction camps translated into the threat of
wholesale slaughter of North America's premier wildlife assemblage. This
threat, carried to Congress by Charles Sheldon and the cohort he led,
motivated the legislators to create Mount McKinley National Park. Judge
Wickersham&#151;by then Alaska's Territorial Delegate to
Congress&#151;introduced the park bill. Karstens, with backing from
Sheldon and Wickersham, became the pioneer superintendent of the new
park-refuge.</P>

<P>Thus did the years 1903 through 1914 string the woof upon the loom:
committed personalities, adventure and description, mining and hunting,
definition of transportation needs and routes, the park-refuge idea. The
warp would follow with Congressional action and early park development
and access. Intervening history, from then until now, has been and
continues to be woven on that same loom, with only variations of
design.</P>

<HR NOSHADE ALIGN="center" WIDTH="75%">

<P>In 1900 Federal Judge James Wickersham set up District Court in
Eagle, Alaska, under the terms of Alaska's new Civil Code, which
followed hard upon the Gold Rush. His judicial district covered more
than half of Alaska, centering upon the vast Interior. Wickersham won
appointment to the judgeship after effective work as lawyer and
political campaigner in Tacoma, Washington. His judicial and political
career in Alaska would span more than 30 years. He helped guide Alaska's
transition from orphan outpost to full territorial status in 1912, and
subsequently served several terms as Alaska's Delegate to Congress. [<A
HREF="hrs3e.htm#1">1</A>]</P>

<P>With the Fairbanks gold discoveries and stampede of 1902, the
population of Wickersham's district gravitated to the new bonanza on the
Tanana, and so, too, did the judge. After organizing his court and
Fairbanks' civil offices in Spring 1903, Wickersham considered what to
do until his court convened in the fall. For him "...the most
interesting object on the horizon was the massive dome that dominates
the valleys of the Tanana, the Yukon, and the Kuskokwim&#151;the monarch
of North American mountains&#151;Mount McKinley." [<A
HREF="hrs3e.htm#2">2</A>]</P>

<P>After assembling four kindred spirits for the expedition, the judge
set out for the mountain in May 1903. The party chose to approach as
closely as possible by boat, thus pioneering steamboat access up the
Kantishna River. [<A HREF="hrs3e.htm#3">3</A>] This route, down the
Tanana and up the Kantishna to head of navigation, would be perfected
with boat landings, trails, and supply points during the Kantishna gold
rush of 1905, which was inspired by the Wickersham party's staking of
placer claims.</P>

<P>Wickersham and his companions enjoyed their trip. His account
sparkles with reflections on the virgin beauty of the land they had
entered, well timbered, fertile&#151;a valley scene that resembled the
lower Mississippi more than the boreal Yukon drainage. Only the distant
summits of the snowy range indicated their northern latitude. [<A
HREF="hrs3e.htm#4">4</A>]</P>

<P>Along the river they found Tena (Tanana) Indians in traditional
spring hunting camps in the neighborhood of the Toklat-Kantishna
confluence. These people had left their winter villages on the lower
Tanana in February, hauling their gear with dogs and toboggans. Foraging
through the forests and foothills, they had taken moose and caribou, and
now they hunted ducks migrating into the Kantishna's river-and-lake
lowlands. The Indians shared their fresh meat and their knowledge of the
landscape, pointing out the easiest route for the men and mules to the
base of Mount McKinley&#151;via Chitsia Creek, the lower birch-clad
slopes of the Kantishna Hills (above the swamps and deep creeks), and
the gap through those hills formed by Moose Creek and Wonder Lake.</P>

<P>Having off-loaded from their steamer, <U>Tanana</U> Chief, the men
progressed with mules, backpacks, and a poling boat, Mudlark, which they
had found and reconditioned near the mouth of the Kantishna. They
encountered first one, then two more white trappers scouting the country
for furbearers. The latter two had portaged from the Kuskokwim and after
a year in the wilderness were en route to the Tanana trading posts with
their furs. [<A HREF="hrs3e.htm#5">5</A>] Already the patterns of trade
and transportation were being traced across a country unknown to white
men just a few years earlier.</P>

<P>At the Telida Indian camp called <U>Anotoktilon</U>, near the mouth
of Bearpaw River, Wickersham's party met Chief Sesui, rescuer of the
Herron party. This band of hunters regularly pursued caribou and sheep
on the plateau and in the headwater canyons below the Denali-McKinley
massif. They gave detailed instructions for reaching the glaciers that
descend from Denali's summit. They recommended that the poling boat be
cached at this point for the trip across the foothills. [<A
HREF="hrs3e.htm#6">6</A>]</P>

<P>The cross-country march took Wickersham and his companions past lakes
alive with waterfowl and on to the flank of Chitsia Mountain, which they
would climb for a magnificent view of the country. Chitsia or Heart
Mountain (so-called because it is shaped like a moose heart) was a
sacred place of the Tena Indians. During Wickersham's visit with them a
few days earlier their blind shaman, Koonah, had told him of Yako, the
Tena's origin hero. Yako had fathered the Tena people in the ancient
past. He had magically created the Denali massif from giant sea waves
sent to destroy him by Totson the Raven Chief. During a later struggle,
Tebay the White Sheep Chief had climbed to his Chitsia Mountain lookout
to direct the enemies of Yako to his village on the banks of the Yukon.
There the treacherous warriors from the southern sea were vanquished by
Yako and his children so the Tena could live in peace. [<A
HREF="hrs3e.htm#7">7</A>]</P>

<P>From Tebay's lookout, Wickersham describes the scene:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The little peak stands in the forefront of the mountain mass, the
descent to the valley is abrupt; the Toclat spreads out at its base on
the eastern slope, and is in view from the mountains in the south to its
confluence with the Kantishna. Far to the east we can see the bluffs at
Chena, and beyond, Fairbanks; the Tanana and the Tolovana hills are in
view across the northern horizon, while the Nuchusala hills in the
west rise hardly to our level. Minchumina Lake lies to the westward and
glistens like silver in the sunlight. The view continues far south of
Minchumina to the massive McKinley range. We can trace the course of the
Kuskokwim into the Bull Moose hills and the portage from Minchumina lake
to that river. The valley view from the Tebay's aerie is a widespread
panorama of forest, lake, and river, stretching from the distant eastern
horizon around by north and west to the western flanks of Mount McKinley
due south of us. This three-quarters of a circle is a wide, flat valley,
carpeted with an evergreen forest, marked by rivers and dotted with
lakes. The sun shone in glorious radiance over Yako's land, and we now
understood and better appreciated the vivid description of it given to
us by Koonah, the blind shaman of lowland Kantishna. [<A
HREF="hrs3e.htm#8">8</A>]</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>In succeeding days the party hunted and jerked caribou, found colors
and staked claims on Chitsia Creek (the first mining claims in the
Kantishna district), passed through the Moose Creek-Wonder Lake gap, and
crossed the bars and channels of McKinley River, its silt and gravel
plucked by Muldrow Glacier from the high walls of the mountain that now
hung over them. [<A HREF="hrs3e.htm#9">9</A>]</P>

<P>The mountaineers set up base camp on the lower reaches of Peters
Glacier. Ascending its main course they aimed for the northwest buttress
of McKinley's North Peak as their route to the top. Turned by a chaotic
icefall, crevasses, and sheer cliffs where Peters Glacier plunges
through narrowed walls, Wickersham bore left up smaller Jeffery Glacier,
which, in the towering topography and obscuring walls, seemed to offer
access to the ascent ridge. After hours of careful toil avoiding
crevasses and gingerly crossing snow bridges,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>. . . we reached an arete or sharp ridge of bare rock at the extreme
upper end of the bench glacier, and found, to our intense
disappointment, that the glacier did not connect with the high ridge we
were seeking to reach, which yet seemed as far above us as when we began
the ascent. We are now about 10,000 feet above sea-level on a sharp
ridge of rock. Here our bench glacier roadway ends, for over this arete
which juts out from the mountain wall, the descent is almost
perpendicular to the great bergs of the main glacier, far below as they
crowd over each other to enter the narrow gorge. Here is a tremendous
precipice beyond which we cannot go. Our only line of further ascent
would be to climb the vertical wall of the mountain at our left, and
that is impossible. [<A HREF="hrs3e.htm#10">10</A>]</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>That vertical wall, now known as Wickersham Wall, rises 14,000 feet
from Peters Glacier to McKinley's North Peak.</P>

<P>The Wickersham climb, and another attempt the same year by Frederick
Cook, served well as reconnaissance ventures. They showed that Peters
Glacier was a dead end, at least for the pioneer climbers. The way to
the top in the early days of Mount McKinley mountaineering awaited
discovery of the ridge-hidden Muldrow Glacier route.</P>

<P>Wickersham's party returned to civilization, by raft, boat, and
steamboat after a glorious summer adventure. They had probed and mapped
the approaches to the mountain. They had found traces of gold, and when
they filed their claims at the Rampart recorder's office on the Yukon,
they assured that others would come in force to the virgin lands of the
Kantishna.</P>

<HR NOSHADE ALIGN="center" WIDTH="75%">

<P>By 1903 Dr. Frederick A. Cook&#151;a self-made man, medical doctor,
and courageous member of four Arctic and Antarctic expeditions since
1901&#151;had established impeccable credentials as an explorer. Among
his admirers and former expedition colleagues were Robert E. Peary and
Roald Amundsen of polar discovery fame.</P>

<P>Cook's 1903 attempt to climb Mount McKinley foundered in the maze of
cliffs and drop-offs surrounding Peters Glacier and its upper basin, as
had Wickersham's 2 months earlier. Cook and his companions managed to
surmount the ice fall in the Peters Glacier canyon that had blocked the
earlier party, and finally reached an elevation of about 11,000 feet on
the North Peak's northwest buttress. From their highest camp, a hole
chopped in a blue-ice precipice, the ridge</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>. . .led with an ever-increasing slope to a granite cliff which did
not appear unclimbable from below. But at close range and in a good
light we could see that farther progress . . . was impossible. There
were successive cliffs for four thousand feet. [<A
HREF="hrs3e.htm#11">11</A>]</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Acknowledging defeat, the party cached its extra food and fuel to
lighten packs, then dashed 29 miles to the face of Peters Glacier.</P>

<P>Despite the mountain's dominance Cook's expedition that year brought
richly deserved acclaim as a feat of exploration. His was the first
circumnavigation of the McKinley massif. Paralleling Brooks' 1902 route
from Tyonek, across the range, then along its northwest slope&#151;with
the climbing interlude at Peters Glacier&#151;Cook scouted the
unexplored heights northeasterly of Muldrow Glacier. There he found a
pass negotiable by the party's pack horses via the extreme headwaters
and intervening glaciers of the Toklat and Chulitna rivers. Thence,
after abandoning the horses, the party rafted down the main courses of
the Chulitna and the Susitna to Susitna Station and eventually came back
to Tyonek. [<A HREF="hrs3e.htm#12">12</A>]</P>

<P>Had Doctor Cook ended his Mount McKinley career with this 3-month,
1,000-mile trek&#151;its northern pass-finding arc through unexplored
mountains&#151;he would have capped a remarkable saga of exploration.
But the lure of the mountain and the glory he sought would lead him to
make false claims 3 years later to the destruction of his reputation.
[<A HREF="hrs3e.htm#13">13</A>]</P>

<P>Cook's expedition demonstrated the terrible toll of even approaching
the isolated mountain, much less climbing it. Moreover, the narrow
window imposed by subarctic seasons and weather nearly closed on Cook
and his men as winter marched in step with them during their September
dash across the range and down the Susitna.</P>

<P>Robert Dunn, a Harvard-educated journalist, accompanied Cook in 1903.
Cook appointed him to a role best described as operational chief of the
expedition, thus he labored and led the crew as a sweating participant,
not as an observing reporter. Dunn's mentor, editor Lincoln Steffens,
had charged him to write a completely truthful account of an exploring
expedition&#151;an expose of the rows, bickering, dissents, and
demoralizations usually hidden behind the heroic prose of the exploring
fraternity. [<A HREF="hrs3e.htm#14">14</A>]</P>

</TABLE>

<P>The pages of Dunn's <U>The Shameless Diary of an Explorer</U>
fulfilled that charge. They painted an ambivalent picture of Doctor
Cook: sometimes hero, usually kind though often petulant, sometimes
indecisive, on-again off-again as a leader and technically competent
wilderness man. Dunn's descriptions of trail conditions, mishaps, and
smoldering enmities amongst the party depict the attrition, physical and
mental, of men and animals marooned except for their own unceasing
labors in a wilderness beyond help of others.</P>

<P>First on the trail through the Skwentna River swamps:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>By noon, it seemed that we'd been traveling a year, hewing down,
down, stem by stem, among the iron-limbed alders. Winter snows flatten,
toughen, bind, and bend them into tempered springs. You can't move an
inch without an axe, or getting gouged in the face. And then to drive
fourteen, exhausted, half-wild bronchos, stampeding, snorting, as you
hear the whooping-screeching rip of canvas&#151;see the cinches dangling
from the brush! Oh, our hot oaths as we hunt and gather the packs,
chopping a clear place to pack, fighting mosquitoes! And for every foot
the beasts travel we cover forty, dashing forward to head them, unsnarl,
drag from the mud.</P>

<P ALIGN="center">..........</P>

<P>We reached a big crick paralleling the river. The banks were slewed
and clogged with drift and willows. We were an hour crossing and
ploughing through the quicksands, finding the lead for trail
beyond....</P>

<P ALIGN="center">..........</P>

<P>Cutting trail with me on the other side and piling brush to keep the
beasts from jumping into the crick where it turned and gouged the bank,
Jack suddenly lost his temper for no reason I could see, and hurled off
his axe murderously into the brush. Then he snagged his eye, and sat
down, quivering for ten minutes on the sand-bar, his head in his hands,
so no one dared to speak to him. [<A HREF="hrs3e.htm#15">15</A>]</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Next, a moment of inspiration on a highpoint overlooking Peters
Glacier:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The dizzy unworldliness of it all was intensified, compressed by
perspective. You seemed suspended in air, infinitely near, yet
infinitely far from ice or rock wall.  The sky overhead was blue-black.
The haze had dissolved, leaving rainbow islands of cloud at succeeding
spheres of the shadowy cut, casting down abnormal shadows, swift
darknesses, blazing revelations. Think of it&#151;this mile-wide trail
[Peters Glacier], unknown miles long, hemmed by one wall a mile high,
another three sheer miles, and so straight you can hit its base with a
snowball, as you look up at its summit, the apex of North America.
Somewhere a snow-slide thunders, a tiny white cloud of fuzz like the
puff from ten thousand cannon blurs the wall, its whisper dies away into
the pre-creative silence. [<A HREF="hrs3e.htm#16">16</A>]</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Finally, the doubt before choosing the doubtful exit from their
plight, across the range and down the Susitna:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>We've been discussing how to get out of the country, for ice is
beginning to rim the river slews at night. Twelve days' rafting down the
Peters stream should bring us to Tanana river and a Yukon trading post.
But northeast stretches mile on mile, white with 10,000-foot alps, and
the flat avenues of the world's biggest inland glaciers, ramifying like
the tentacles of a cuttle-fish this supreme American range. And it is
all unmapped, undiscovered, bleak and shriveled under the breath of
autumn. And south across these mountains, to the Sushitna River and Cook
Inlet, the Government Survey report we read between chapters of our one
and only Tom Sawyer, says with familiar triteness that it is "extremely
doubtful" if any pass exists. [<A HREF="hrs3e.htm#17">17</A>]</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<HR NOSHADE ALIGN="center" WIDTH="75%">

<P>One of the true heroes of McKinley mountaineering was Belmore Browne.
He was a man for all seasons: lumberjack, explorer, artist, hunter,
artful writer, scholar, and right arm to Charles Sheldon in the
political struggles of the McKinley park movement. Except for a sudden
storm at the last moment and final steps of a great climb in 1912, he
would have been the first man to achieve McKinley's summit. His love of
Alaska took him to its farthest reaches over many decades, beginning as
an 8-year-old boy in 1888. His career mingled with that of Doctor Cook,
as colleague, then as critic. Regretfully, Browne and his partner
Herschel Parker, would prove the falsehood of Cook's claim to conquest
of the mountain in 1906. [<A HREF="hrs3e.htm#18">18</A>]</P>

<P>Browne's three expeditions to Mount McKinley during the period
1906-1912 gave him profound understanding of the mountain's
challenge&#151;particularly in the pre-aircraft era of the pioneer
climbs. His book, <U>The Conquest of Mount McKinley</U> (1913), captures
the perspective of that era&#151;picturing the great mountain barricaded
by distance, labyrinthine terrain, and arctic weather from those tiny
mortals who stood at its base and longed to reach its top.</P>

<P>He describes the mountain as ". . . a gigantic mass of granite that
was forced upward through the stratum of slate that overlaid it." The
slate survives on the lower peaks, giving them "a strange, black-capped
appearance."</P>

<P>A principal difficulty for the mountaineer is the low altitude from
which the mountain rises. The plateaus of South America and Tibet allow
climbers to hike halfway up to the peaks they seek to climb. But ascent
of McKinley begins near sea level. After 30 miles of difficult ice-and
snow traverse on the glacial avenues that offer the only access through
the gorges to the climbing heights&#151;carrying all supplies in
backpacks&#151;the climber still looks up at 3 vertical miles of ice,
snow, and forbidding cliffs, toward a peak still 10 or 12 miles distant,
rimmed by sub-peaks and huge buttresses, which in themselves are major
challenges, and beyond which (in those foot-slogging days without aerial
reconnaissance) lie unseen gorges and ridges that may foil the climber's
planned route. Even on the glacier approach polar equipment is
mandatory, and the time required for the climb and weather delays
demands mountains of supplies. All this just to climb the mountain.
Getting to the mountain, geographically placed "in the most inaccessible
position obtainable," was the other half of the struggle. [<A
HREF="hrs3e.htm#19">19</A>] Until the Alaska Railroad was completed in
1923 and glacier piloting began in 1932, approach logistics consumed
such prodigious energies and supplies that many expeditions were whipped
before they started the ascent.</P>

<P>With such depletions in mind, the mountain's other challenges, beyond
technical mountaineering, came to the fore: perennial arctic conditions
above 10,000 feet-constant cold at subzero temperatures; sudden storms,
blinding snow, hurricane winds, causing wind-chill factors well below
minus 100 degrees; tents and equipment ripped, lost, buried; trails
laboriously broken, then erased by drifts, to be found and broken again
by people breathing and pumping like hummingbirds, counting to ten
between each step; climbers exhausted, disabled or dying from altitude
sickness or hypothermia; the loss of a mitt or a wet sock the difference
between life and death. All of this beyond avalanches, falls, crevasse
disappearances, and the terrible toil of simply moving upward in air
nearly devoid of oxygen. These hazards still obtain, as the mountain's
constantly growing death toll demonstrates and despite modern
improvements of aircraft and high-tech mountaineering, medical, and
rescue operations. That the pioneer climbers incrementally discovered
the way up, made their ascents, and came back to tell their stories is a
testimonial to grit, frontier improvisation, and luck. [<A
HREF="hrs3e.htm#20">20</A>]</P>

<P>Terris Moore's history of the pioneer climbs cites 11 distinct
mountaineering expeditions, beginning with Wickersham's, leading to the
first completely successful ascent of Mount McKinley in 1913. Only
highlights of the balance of these efforts can be presented in the
context of this regional history.</P>

<HR NOSHADE ALIGN="center" WIDTH="75%">

<P>Doctor Cook returned to Mount McKinley in 1906 in company with
Herschel C. Parker, professor of physics at Columbia University, and
Belmore Browne, artist, among others. This expedition resulted in a
valuable reconnaissance and mapping of the southern approaches to the
mountain. The party used a pack train and a motor launch to investigate
the Susitna's tributaries and their heading glaciers on McKinley's south
flank. After 2 months of intense work without finding a route to the
top, the party returned to Cook Inlet, and its members went their
separate ways. Doctor Cook remained in the vicinity, and in early
September with horse-packer Robert Barrill made . . . A LAST DESPERATE
ATTEMPT ON MOUNT MCKINLEY," [<A HREF="hrs3e.htm#21">21</A>] as Cook
phrased it in a dramatic telegram to Eastern backers. His subsequent
claim that he had dashed to the top and back in less than 2 weeks via
Ruth Glacier inspired instant skepticism amongst those familiar with the
country, including Parker and Browne. What came to be known as the Fake
Ascent spawned a controversy between Cook loyalists and mountaineering
detectives that even now sputters on, despite overwhelming evidence that
Cook lied.</P>

<P>Browne's <U>The Conquest of Mount McKinley</U> recounts his and
Professor Parker's sleuthing that identified a rock pinnacle in a side
basin halfway up Ruth Glacier as the site of Cook's famous "summit"
photograph. This point is about 5,300 feet above the sea and some 19
miles from McKinley's summit on a straight line. Cook trapped himself
with his own photography in a preliminary article and in his later book,
<U>To the Top of the Continent</U>. The book's unretouched summit photo,
which shows a back ground peak (not shown in the retouched article
photo), plus contextual photos of the side basin (claimed by Cook to be
thousands of feet above its actual elevation) allowed Parker and Browne
to pinpoint the rock pinnacle on the ground in 1910. Barrill, sworn to
silence by Cook, later revealed the hoax in an affidavit, stating that
Cook had dictated false entries for Barrill's diary. Brad Washburn
assembled and critiqued all available evidence, including his own ground
proofing, in his 1958 <U>American Alpine Journal</U> article, "Doctor
Cook and Mount McKinley." Despite frost-action crumbling of the rotten
rock pinnacle, which had altered its profile as shown in Cook's photos,
the photos in Washburn's article show key remaining features of the
pinnacle, and the tale-tale background mountain in a comparative photo
essay. It was the "fingerprint" of this mountain (as Browne said, "No
man can lie topographically") that had guided Parker and Browne to the
pinnacle in 1910. Aside from all this physical evidence, the timetables,
distances, logistics, and the route to the top described and mapped by
Doctor Cook seemed immediately and were later proved incredible. After
their own experiences with Cook earlier that summer of 1906, probing up
the great tendril glaciers of McKinley's weather flank, Parker and
Browne could not buy the 12-day up-and-back story from their first
hearing of it.</P>

<P>As the Mount McKinley controversy grew riper, Doctor Cook threw
another bombshell. In 1908 he claimed to have reached the North Pole,
beating his former leader Robert Peary to the prize. This claim was
immediately challenged by Peary and others, and another controversy
erupted. This claim too was later disproved.</P>

<P>The combination of claims, suspicions, and rebuttals finally impelled
the Explorers Club to call Doctor Cook before a committee of peers to
clear himself. He refused to testify and disappeared. The Explorers
Club, of which Doctor Cook had been president, expelled him in late
1909. He was also dropped from the rolls of the American Alpine Club and
various geographical and learned societies.</P>

<P>Then followed several mountaineering expeditions to Mount McKinley in
1910, both to attempt the ascent and to test Cook's claims. Two of these
came back with authoritative evidence. Parker and Browne led the
Explorers Club-American Geographical Society party that discovered the
false peak. The distinguished experts who made up this expedition had
been charged to find solid proof one way or the other respecting Cook's
claim to have climbed the mountain. For the Cook controversies&#151;both
McKinley and North Pole&#151;had turned ugly. The public suspected that
Cook, their popular hero, was the victim of individual and institutional
jealousies. Reputations were at stake&#151;including those of such
eminent third parties as Charles Sheldon and Alfred Hulse Brooks. who
had contributed technical appendices to Cook's book, thereby implicitly
endorsing his claims.</P>

<P>On the approach to Ruth Glacier in 1910, Parker and Browne
encountered C.E. Rusk leader of the Portland, Oregon Mazama
Mountaineering Club expedition. The Mazamas wanted to track Cook's route
as described in his writings and on his 1907 map. In this way they would
assess his claims on the ground. Their sympathies lay with Cook but
objectivity was their guide. The two expeditions joined in the quest for
truth but proceeded separately. Weeks of hard hiking and glacier
hazards, encumbered with polar equipment and supplies, brought the
Mazamas up Ruth Glacier's vast trench to its great amphitheater and
upper branches. At this point Rusk and his companions saw that Cook's
map was the product of his imagination, for it matched in no way the
actual scene before them. Cook had described a valley glacier route
giving access northward to Muldrow Glacier, and thence to the top. A
maze of mountains and glacial box canyons enclosed by cliffs greeted the
Mazamas. Rusk would later close his meticulous report with this sad
statement: [<A HREF="hrs3e.htm#22">22</A>]</P>

<P>Dr. Cook had many admirers who would have rejoiced to see his claims
vindicated, and I too would have been glad to add my mite in clearing
his name. But it could not be. Of his courage and resolution there can
be no doubt. He is described as absolutely fearless. He is also
considered as always willing to do his share and as an-all-around good
fellow to be out with. His explorations around Mount McKinley were
extensive. They were of interest and value to the world. Had he
persevered, he doubtless would have reached the summit on some future
expedition. He was the first to demonstrate the possibility of launch
navigation up the Susitna and Chulitna Rivers. And that one trip
alone&#151;when with a single companion he braved the awful solitude of
Ruth Glacier and penetrated the wild, crag-guarded region near the foot
of McKinley&#151;should have made him famous. But as we gazed upon the
forbidding crags of the great mountain from far up the Ruth Glacier at
the point of (Cook's and Barrill's) farthest advance and realized that
it would require perhaps weeks or months more in which to explore a
route to the summit, we realized how utterly impossible and absurd was
the story of this man who, carrying a single pack, claims to have
started from the Tokositna on the eighth of September, and to have stood
on the highest point of McKinley on the sixteenth of the month. The man
does not live who can perform such a feat. Let us draw the mantle of
charity around him and believe, if we can, that there is a thread of
insanity running through the woof of his brilliant mind... If he is not
mentally imbalanced, he is entitled to the pity of mankind. If he is
not, there is no corner of the earth where he can hide from his
past.</P>

<P>In mountaineering circles, the Cook controversy generated a mythos
and a literature similar to the Custeriana that followed and still
follows the Battle of the Little Bighorn. [<A
HREF="hrs3e.htm#23">23</A>] But this study must move on, drawing once
more the mantle of charity over a man whose genuine exploits and
deserved reputation dissolved in falsehoods meant to enhance them.</P>
