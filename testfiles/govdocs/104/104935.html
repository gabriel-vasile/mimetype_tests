            FEWER NORTHERN FUR SEAL PUPS BORN IN 2002</strong></font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NOAA 
            Fisheries scientists have finished their 2002 count of northern fur 
            seals (<a href="http://www.pinnipeds.org/species/norfursl.htm"><em>Callorhinus 
            ursinus</em></a>) in the Pribilof Islands and reported that fewer 
            pups have been born this year, and each year since 1998. The reasons 
            behind the decline are not known. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
            Administration (<a href="http://www.noaa.gov">NOAA</a>) is an agency 
            of the <a href="http://www.commerce.gov">Commerce Department</a>.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Approximately 800,000 fur seals live 
            in the North Pacific. Researchers report that pup produced has declined 
            by about 5 percent per year for at least the last four years.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Northern fur seals range from southern 
            California north to the Bering Sea and west to the Okhotsk Sea and 
            Honshu Island of Japan. NOAA Fisheries identifies two populations 
            of northern fur seals in U.S. waters &#8211; one in the Pribilof Islands, 
            which is designated under federal marine mammal law as depleted, and 
            one on San Miguel Island in California. The Pribilof Islands rookeries 
            are home to almost all of the northern fur seals inside U.S. waters, 
            and up to 72 percent of the world&#8217;s population.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Studies are providing information about 
            foraging areas for lactating female northern fur seals during the 
            breeding and pup rearing season in the Pribilofs. Managers hope to 
            use this information to refine their protections for and conservation 
            of the seals.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
            1993, <a href="http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov">NOAA Fisheries</a> managers 
            developed a conservation plan for northern fur seals. Since then, 
            NOAA Fisheries and the Tribal Governments of the <a href="http://nmml.afsc.noaa.gov/AlaskaEcosystems/nfshome/pribilof.htm">Pribilof 
            Islands</a> of St. Paul and St. George agreed to cooperatively manage 
            the fur seal population. The managers are now re-drafting the conservation 
            plan, taking into account the most recent scientific findings, population 
            trends and traditional knowledge. The revised plan is expected to 
            be completed in 2003 and will be phased in over a five-year period.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>History:</strong></font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Millions of northern fur seals were killed 
            from the late 1700s into the mid-1980s for their high quality pelts. 
            Historical records show that from 1786 until 1828 about 100,000 fur 
            seals per year were harvested commercially. That dropped to about 
            70,000 seals harvested annually through 1839. By the final years of 
            the Russian occupation of Alaska, about 35,000 seals were taken each 
            year. Many seals were also taken at sea: at the peak of such open-water 
            seal hunting, about 42,000 seals (mostly lactating females) were taken 
            each year in the Bering Sea, with more taken from the waters off British 
            Columbia.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 1911, Great Britain (for Canada), 
            Japan, Russia, and the United States ratified the Treaty for the Preservation 
            and Protection of Fur Seals and Sea Otters, which prohibited taking 
            seals at sea and limited the take on land.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From 1956 to 1968, a commercial harvest 
            of females was implemented to intentionally reduce the size of the 
            herd. Once the female harvest was stopped, the herd began to slowly 
            increase, but in the mid to late 1970s pup production again began 
            to decrease and continued to decline. The total world population is 
            approximately 40 percent of the 1956 estimated population size. The 
            commercial take of female seals between 1956 and 1968 is believed 
            to have significantly contributed to the population decline.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The commercial harvest of northern fur 
            seals in the Pribilof Islands has been prohibited on St. George and 
            St. Paul Islands since 1973 and 1985, respectively. In 1986 the harvest 
            was limited to Alaskan Native subsistence purposes only. Subsistence 
            hunters harvested less than 2,000 non-breeding male seals each year 
            from 1986 to the mid-1990s. Fewer than 1,000 seals have been taken 
            annually during the past several years. Subsistence harvests are not 
            considered a major factor in the current decline.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the mid-1960s, scientists observed 
            young seals entangled in trawl nets and packing band debris used by 
            the fishing industry at that time. Such entanglements may have contributed 
            significantly to declining trends of the population on the Pribilof 
            Islands during the late 1970's. From then until the late 1990s, entanglements 
            decreased but recent surveys and disentanglement efforts by the Tribal 
            Government of St. Paul show an increase in male fur seal entanglements 
            on Saint Paul Island. Entanglements are not thought to be a major 
            factor in the current population trend.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Possible 
            current causes of population decline:</strong></font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The ebb and flow of available prey, perhaps 
            influenced by large-scale fishing and natural ecosystem fluctuations, 
            may also be contributing to northern fur seals&#8217; decline. Though 
            malnutrition is the primary cause of mortality among fur seal pups, 
            the complexity of ecosystem interactions and limitations of data and 
            models make it difficult to determine how fishery removals may have 
            influenced the population.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Other factors which may contribute to 
            the recent decline of northern fur seals include parasites and disease, 
            injuries, pollutants, nutrition, and predation by killer whales.</font></p>
