KEY:  N = data do not exist; R = revised; U = data are not available.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a The Federal Highway Trust Fund was created with the enactment of the Highway Revenue Act of 1956. The total receipts shown for 1995 are overstated by approximately $1.59 billion due to a fiscal year (FY) 1994 error by the Treasury Department in reconciling estimated deposits to the actual tax revenue. The correction was made after the close of FY1994 and is shown in FY1995 receipts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
b Figures obtained by addition/subtraction and may not appear directly in data source.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
c Gross amounts collected by state governments from highway users. Does not include tolls. Not all revenues allocated to highway expenditures.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"d Includes distributors and dealers licenses, inspection fees, fines and penalties, and miscellaneous  receipts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"e Includes drivers licenses, title fees, special title taxes, fines and penalties; estimated service charges and local collections.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"f Includes carrier gross receipt taxes; mileage, ton-mile and passenger-mile taxes; special license fees and franchise taxes; and certificate or permit fees.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"g Mileage in federal parks, forests, and reservations that are not a part of the state and local highway system. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"h Prior to 1999, mileage for municipal roads was included with the ""other local roads"" jurisdiction. Mileage for municipal roads was included in ""Town, Township and Municipal Road"" jurisdiction after 1999.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i   Data for 1994-2002, is based on the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).  Prior to 1994, data is based on the Standard Industrial Classification System (SIC).  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"j Highway category classifications changed several times before 1980. Actual 1960 data categories were: Main Rural Roads, Local Rural Roads and Urban Streets; 1970 data categories were: Rural Interstate, Rural Other Arterial, Other Rural, Urban Interstate and Other Urban.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
NOTES,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Motor vehicle injury and crash data in this profile come from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's General Estimates System (GES). The data from GES, which began operation in 1988, are obtained from a nationally representative probability sample selected from all police-reported crashes, and the GES sample includes only crashes where a police accident report was completed and the crash resulted in property damage, injury, or death. The resulting figures do not take into account crashes which were not reported to the police or which did not result in at least property damage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Earlier editions of NTS, particularly the 1993 Historical Compendium, used crash and injury figures estimated by the National Safety Council, which employed a different set of methods to arrive at its figures. Thus, the injury and crash figures in this edition of NTS may not be comparable with those found in earlier editions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In 1998, FHWA instituted a new method of creating mileage based tables derived from the Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS).  See Chapter 1 accuracy profiles for more information about the HPMS.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
