	<b>Accomplishments</b>: A new liquid formulation of Bayluscide was developed which will further reduce hazards associated with handling the older Bayluscide powder formulations.

A treatment model that focuses on the pH and alkalinity characteristics of the treated body of water was developed which resulted in a significant reduction in the amount of lampricides required to conduct treatments.

A new timed-release granular formulation of Bayluscide was developed which (1) reduces unintended exposures to applicators and, (2) effectively distributes the active ingredient where the larvae are found.

TFM and niclosamide were determined to be eligible for reregistration in 1997, and the registration was completed in 2003.

The re-evaluations of TFM and niclosamide in Canada were completed and both chemicals were found to be eligible for continued registration.  

Submissions to the Pest Management Regulatory Agency of Health Canada were made in April 2007 to obtain a registration of TFM for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.  Review of the submissions are in progress. 

A treatment model for treating streams and rivers containing lake sturgeon, which are sensitive to TFM, was developed.

As part of the UMESC's commitment to provide technical assistance to the Great Lakes Fishery Commission sea lamprey (Petromyzon marius) control program, Center scientists conduct risk assessments of lampricide treatments to non-target organisms of special concern.  During this reporting period, studies were conducted comparing the relative toxicity of larval sea lamprey to that of lake sturgeon (Ascipenser fulvescens), mudpuppies (Necturus maculosus), and five species of unionid mussels (Elliptio complanata, Pyanodon cataracta, P. grandis, Leptodea fragilis, and Potamilus alatus). In addition, a study on a surrogate to the Hungerford's crawling water beetle (Brychius hungerford) was completed.  Results from the study indicate that the beetle or its larvae are not sensitive to the chemicals.  This research has resulted to-date in two reports and two peer-reviewed publications (see products), has allowed further improvements in the sea lamprey control program to minimize effects to non-target species of concern, and has allowed continued treatment of streams in which non-target species of concern were shown to be relatively unaffected by lampricides.  Staff also conducted tests to determine the effects of TFM and a TFM/1% niclosamide mixture on American eel (Anquilla rostrata).  Preliminary data show that the lampricides were not harmful to the eels at concentrations of up to 9 times the concentrations routinely used to control sea lamprey larvae.  Studies to determine the effects of pH cycling on sea lamprey minimum lethal concentration are in progress and will be completed in FY 2007.

A new registration for an alternate supplier of TFM Bar formulation was obtained in March 20008.

A study was completed in 2008 to determine the ability of lake sturgeon (Ascipenser fulvescens) to sense the lampricide niclosamide and move away from the chemical.<br><b>Communication Plan</b>: Completion reports for specific subtasks filed with the Great Lakes Fishery Commission

Project Status Reports<br><b>Highlights and Key Findings</b>: Two sea lamprey pheromone experimental use permits were approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the State of Michigan allowing field trials for sea lamprey migratory and male sex pheromones that may be new tools for sea lamprey control.

Four niclosamide products and one TFM product were converted from temporary to full registration with the Health Canada Pest Management Regulatory Agency as a result of the recently completed re-evaluation process.<br><b>Objectives</b>: This task addresses Primary Program Element, Invasive Species Provide approaches to contain, reduce, and eliminate populations of invasive species and restore habitats and native species (Control and Management Goal) and Fisheries:  Aquatic and Endangered Resources, and FAER program element Goal #6. Provide research support and technical assistance to DOI bureaus, other Federal and State government agencies, Tribes, and non-governmental groups to support natural resource management problem solving and decision making.  This task is an reimbursable agreement between Great Lakes Fishery Commission (GLFC) and UMESC.  GLFC funding does not support full cost accounting, and therefore cost share is an issue.  

The project addresses three major objectives.  The first is to assist the GLFC, the FWS, and the DFO with technical aspects of the chemical sea lamprey control program.  The second objective is to provide regulatory affairs liaison with Health Canada and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for maintaining the registrations of the lampricides and pursing registrations for sea lamprey pheromones.  The third is to conduct research to support the sea lamprey control program.  Goals of this research include, but are not limited to, developing new lampricide formulations, improving efficacy or efficiency of lampricide treatments, and documenting non-target effects.

This task was previously Task 5 under Project 23139J7.

"Expected Outcomes" The outcome of this task is to provide data that will be used to improve sea lamprey control operations.  Control managers will have well-developed methods available that will help them maintain desirable fish populations which will contribute to healthy Great Lakes and Lake Champlain ecosystems.  Information will be transferred in the form of reports (1 -3 per year) and in peer-reviewed publications (1 per year).  <br><b>Statement of Problem</b>: The parasitic sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) was introduced into the Great Lakes by the construction of the Welland Canal in the early 1900s. This invasive species caused precipitous declines of commercially and recreationally important fish stocks in all of the Great Lakes by the mid 1950s. An intensive multinational sea lamprey control program, implemented by the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) and the US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), has relied heavily on the use of the larval lampricides 3 trifluoromethyl 4 nitrophenol (TFM) and niclosamide (Bayluscide). Aggressive implementation of the control program has reduced adult sea lamprey populations and allowed the recovery of important fish stocks worth $3.5 billion annually to the economies of the Great Lakes states and Canadian provinces. 

The target of the chemical control program is the sea lamprey larvae, which live in the sediments of streams and rivers where sea lamprey spawn. The rate at which sea lampreys recolonize a stream necessitates retreatment every 3 to 4 years. In a typical treatment, the concentration of TFM to be used is determined by on site toxicity testing and/or analysis of the physico chemical characteristics of the water that affect TFM toxicity (pH, alkalinity, discharge). Treatment concentrations of TFM used in tributaries of the Great Lakes range from 1 to 14 mg/L depending on the water quality of the treated stream. In most applications, only TFM is applied to control sea lampreys. Occasionally a combination of TFM and Bayluscide is applied to reduce the amount of TFM required for treatment. This is a cost effective measure in instances where large quantities of TFM would normally be required, such as streams or rivers with high discharge rates.  A granular formulation of Bayluscide is also used as a control tool.  It is applied in lentic areas and streams where TFM applications are impractical, such as the St. Marys River.  In addition to chemical control of larval sea lamprey, growing emphasis continues to be placed on the integrated control of this detrimental invasive species, including trapping, sterile male release, the construction of barriers, and new research on using pheromones produced by sea lamprey to control their populations.

"Relationship to Program Goals" This task is primarily reimbursable funding from the Great Lakes Fishery Commission.  However, full cost is not supported.  Therefore, a cost share issue exists and funded with FAER funding.  This effort addresses Goal 6, Provide research and technical support to DOI bureaus, other Federal and State government agencies, Tribes, and non-governmental groups to support natural resource management and decision making.  This research program assists the US Fish and Wildlife Service, the Lake Champlain Fish and Wildlife Management Cooperative, and the Great Lakes Fishery Commission in their efforts to control the invasive sea lamprey in the Great Lakes and Lake Champlain.  Research accomplished by UMESC leads to improved management strategies and assists resource managers in determining the best methods for controlling the lamprey and maintaining a healthy ecosystem in the lakes.

Information will be transferred in the form of reports (1 -3 per year) and in peer-reviewed publications (1 per year). Additional information may be found at
