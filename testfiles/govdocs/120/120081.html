 OB:  Insect killing fungi will form the basis for the integrated pest
 management tarnished plant bug (TPB)in vegetables and small fruits. 
 AP:  A large bank of foreign and indigeneous fungal isolates will be
 bioassayed for pathogenicity against 2nd instar TPB, their optimal
 temperatures for activity determined, then six selected for development as
 biocontrol agents. They will be formulated as wettable powders or emulsifiable
 concentrates by commercial companies. Pilot testing of these formulated fungi
 for control of TPB will be done on lettuce in greenhouses. Efficacy will be
 based on TPB population management and damage to the crop. Future plans
 include actual field testing on strawberries and lettuce.
