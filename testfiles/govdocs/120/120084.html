<P>Saltcedar has become a major problem in riparian areas for
land managers in the desert southwest. Many land managers realize
the limitations of mechanical methods and fire on the long-term
control of saltcedar because of its vigorous resprouting potential
after disturbances. The use of individual plant treatments with
herbicides containing triclopyr will enhance an integrated vegetation
management program and reduce or eliminate the resprouting potential
of saltcedar. By treating individual plants with a herbicide containing
triclopyr land managers have been able to achieve desirable native
species release in riparian restoration projects.</P>

<P>Triclopyr is a synthetic auxin, a naturally occurring plant
hormone, which acts in plants to promote rapid growth and cell
division. Control of undesirable saltcedar from triclopyr treatments
is essentially due to an auxin overdose which causes uncontrolled
growth of the plant.</P>

<P>Three products containing triclopyr are available for control
of saltcedar in habitat management projects: Garlon 4, Garlon
3A and Pathfinder II. Garlon 4 and Pathfinder II are water emulsifiable
and oil soluble formulations which can penetrate bark and can
therefore be used in basal bark or cut stump applications (described
below) at any time during the year (see table below). Garlon 3A
is a water soluble amine salt formulation which needs to be directly
applied to cut surfaces for plant uptake. Therefore, it is used
only in cut stump and not for basal bark applications.</P>

<P>Pathfinder II is a ready-to-use formulation featuring a naturally
occurring non-petroleum distillate diluent. All triclopyr products
have established grazing tolerances for cattle and can be used
on sensitive sites according to label directions.</P>

<P>Several different application techniques can be used to control
saltcedar with triclopyr products.</P>

<P><B><U>Basal Bark:</U></B></P>

<P><U>Garlon 4:</U> Mix Garlon 4 at 25% volume/volume (v/v) +
75% v/v oil carrier. Use a backpack sprayer with a low volume
solid cone or flat fan nozzle to apply the mixture to the lower
12-15 inches of the stems. Spray to completely wet the entire
circumference of the stem, but not to the point of runoff.</P>

<P><U>Pathfinder II:</U> Apply <I>undiluted</I> product in the
same manner as Garlon 4.</P>

<P><B><U>Cut Stump</U></B>:</P>

<P>This application technique applies the herbicide to the exposed
cambium after the stem/trunk has been cut.</P>

<P><U>Garlon 4:</U> Apply 25% v/v + 75% v/v oil carrier to the
area adjacent to the cambium and bark around the entire circumference
<I>and</I> the sides of the stump as soon after cutting as possible.
Or apply <I>undiluted</I> product to wet the area adjacent to
the cambium and bark around the entire circumference.</P>

<P><U>Pathfinder II:</U> Apply <I>undiluted</I> product to the
area adjacent to the cambium and bark around the entire circumference
<I>and</I> the sides of the stump as soon after cutting as possible.</P>

<P><U>Garlon 3A:</U> Apply <I>undiluted </I>product to the area
adjacent to the cambium and bark around the entire circumference.</P>

<P>Individual plant treatments of saltcedar with triclopyr products:</P>

<P>allow for the selective removal of saltcedar while reducing
resprouting;</P>

<P>release desirable grasses and other native vegetation;</P>

<P>eliminate broadcast overspray and damage to desirable vegetation;</P>

<P>allow for applications to be made year round, including dormant
or non-nesting seasons;</P>

<P>offer the flexibility to fit into a variety of riparian and
habitat management plans.</P>
