Miscibility



                              Introduction

        This guideline is one of a series of test guidelines that have 
been developed by the Office of Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic 
Substances, United States Environmental Protection Agency for use in the 
testing of pesticides and toxic substances, and the development of test 
data that must be submitted to the Agency for review under Federal 
regulations.

        The Office of Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic Substances 
(OPPTS) has developed this guideline through a process of harmonization 
that blended the testing guidance and requirements that existed in the 
Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics (OPPT) and appeared in Title 
40, Chapter I, Subchapter R of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), 
the Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP) which appeared in publications of 
the National Technical Information Service (NTIS) and the guidelines 
published by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development 
(OECD).

        The purpose of harmonizing these guidelines into a single set of 
OPPTS guidelines is to minimize variations among the testing procedures 
that must be performed to meet the data requirements of the U. S. 
Environmental Protection Agency under the Toxic Substances Control Act 
(15 U.S.C. 2601) and the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide 
Act (7 U.S.C. 136, et seq.).

OPPTS 830.6319  Miscibility.

        (a) Scope--(1) Applicability. This guideline is intended to meet 
testing requirements of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and 
Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) (7 U.S.C. 136, et seq.).

        (2) Background. The source material used in developing this harmonized OPPTS test guideline is OPP guideline 63-19 Miscibility (Pesticide Assessment
Guidelines, Subdivision D: Product Chemistry, EPA Report 540/9-82-018, October
1982) and 40 CFR 158.190 Physical and chemical characteristics.


        (b) Test Method--(1) Objective. Data on the physical and 
chemical characteristics of pesticide products are used to confirm or 
provide supportive information on their identity. Such data are also 
used in reviewing the production or formulating process to produce the 
pesticide or product. This test is intended to determine whether a 
pesticide solution is suitable for application after dilution with oil 
or other nonpolar solvents, where applicable, instead of water. Data on 
miscibility also provide necessary information to support acceptable 
labeling for tank mix and spray applications (if the tank mix of the 
pesticide product is oil based or diluted with oil).

        (2) Test details. (i) For miscibility, the Agency recommends the 
method described in ``MT 23 Miscibility with Hydrocarbon Oil,'' of the 
CIPAC Handbook (see paragraph (d) of this guideline), with the exception 
that the test be conducted at 20  deg.C or 25  deg.C and observations be 
made after 30 minutes rather than 30  deg.C and 1 hour as specified in 
the CIPAC method. If an alternative method is used, it is recommended 
that the registrant consult with the Agency prior to adopting the test 
method.

        (ii) The evaluation of miscibility of emulsifiable liquid 
products bearing directions for dilution with nonpolar solvents shall be 
made at 20  deg.C or 25  deg.C.

        (iii) The product shall be mixed with nonpolar solvents whose 
composition reflects those of the label and at the rate specified on the 
label. After the mixture has stood for 30 minutes, it shall be examined 
for separation.

        (c) Reporting. (1) At the end of 30 minutes, report whether the 
solution is homogeneous, there has been any separation of solid matter, 
or any separation into layers.

        (2) Any methods used to characterize the physical properties of 
a pesticide shall be referenced or described in the application for 
registration. If the methods used are listed in paragraph (d) of this 
guideline, reference to the methods will suffice. If other methods are 
used, copies of such methods must be submitted with the application

        (3) References denoting ``CIPAC'' refer to standardized methods 
of the Collaborative International Pesticide Analytical Council, Ltd., 
Hatching Green, Harpenden, Hertfordshire, England.

        (4) The applicant shall submit his own statistical evaluations 
of the precision of these measurements (e.g., standard deviations or 
confidence intervals) when appropriate.


        (d) References. The following references should be consulted for 
additional background material on this test guideline.
