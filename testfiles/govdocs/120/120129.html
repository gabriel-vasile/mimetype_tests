  in 1996&#151;in what he defined as a <a href="http://catalyst.cit.nih.gov/catalyst/back/97.01/varmus.html">midterm 
  interview</a> with <i>The NIH Catalyst</i>&#151;NIH Director Harold Varmus foreshadowed 
  his exit from NIH with the frank declaration that he thought six years was the 
  optimal term for an NIH director. On October 7 this year, Varmus turned the 
  theoretical pronouncement into actuality, announcing that he would leave NIH 
  by the end of December to head the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in 
  New York.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b><font color="#00003F">Three 
  for the Road</font></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">There were three rationales 
  behind Varmus&#146; late 1996 statement to <i>The Catalyst.</i> His main concern 
  was the politicization of the selection of NIH directors. &quot;I see myself 
  as unlinked to the electoral process,&quot; he said. &quot;I don&#146;t believe 
  the NIH directorship should be as politicized as it&#146;s been the past eight 
  years or so. I didn&#146;t come in with the election . . . and my expectation 
  is that I&#146;ll probably leave the position before the second administration 
  is over, which would give the president a chance to name someone else who&#146;d 
  also span the electoral events and would disconnect the NIH nomination process 
  from the electoral process.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Visiting the NIH campus 
  five days after Varmus&#146; announcement, his boss, Donna Shalala, secretary 
  of Health and Human Services, made it clear she was sympathetic with Varmus&#146; 
  view. At a town meeting in Masur Auditorium, the secretary started out by saying 
  that she believed the appointment of Varmus to lead NIH during this outstanding 
  era of progress in biomedical research would prove to be a great legacy of the 
  Clinton administration. &quot;NIH ought to be seen as an extraordinary institution 
  and, thus, politics should be left out of the process&quot; of selecting a new 
  director, Shalala said.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">&quot;Whether or not that 
  is possible depends on whether there is the political will in Congress to do 
  that and on the ability to streamline the selection process,&quot; she observed. 
  She said that she had already initiated conversations about the search with 
  political leaders, was ready to put together a search committee, and would take 
  an active role in the recruitment herself. &quot;I feel very strongly that there 
  should be a seam-lessness in the NIH leadership.&quot; Asked if she felt that 
  the needed political will was indeed present in Congress, Shalala told <i>The 
  Catalyst</i>, &quot;I have some indication that the political will exists&quot; 
  to find a replacement for Varmus before the election in November 2000.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b><font color="#00003F">Roses</font></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Arguably one of the most 
  widely respected directors in NIH history, Varmus is not perceived as having 
  grown stale&#151;the second reason he cited in 1996 for a limited stand by an 
  NIH director: &quot;You can do a lot of things in six years, but beyond that 
  you probably start to get stale.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">&quot;Au contraire,&quot; 
  in the case of Varmus, say NIH leaders. NIMH director <a href="http://www.nih.gov/cgi-bin/ph-www.pl?alias=sh172r">Steven 
  Hyman</a> says &quot;Harold Varmus has been a spectacular leader because he 
  has invariably put the needs of science ahead of politics and has expressed 
  his values with great clarity and force.&quot; Hyman sees Varmus&#146; prime 
  achievement as creating &quot;a superb and collegial atmosphere in which to 
  work. There were no hidden agendas&#151;the only agenda was to make it possible 
  to perform and to fund the most worthy science.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">NIAID Director <a href="http://www.nih.gov/cgi-bin/ph-www.pl?alias=af10r">Tony 
  Fauci</a> concurs. &quot;Harold Varmus has raised the bar of excellence among 
  scientific leaders. He clearly has been an absolutely outstanding NIH director. 
  His policies and actions are driven by a passion for science superimposed on 
  a prodigious intellect.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">In addition to expressing 
  his enjoyment in working with Varmus, Fauci lauded Varmus&#146; cultivation 
  of &quot;an atmosphere in which nothing short of the highest level of scholarship 
  is acceptable.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Varmus&#146; third rationale 
  for a six-year term limit for NIH directors was the potential for faux pas and 
  accumulation of enemies over a longer haul. Some years of experience give a 
  director time to win supporters and forge alliances, he observed in late &#146;96. 
  &quot;On the other hand, the longer you&#146;re here, the more likely you are 
  to have some major screw-up. I&#146;ve been lucky so far to have avoided major 
  potholes, and I think my credibility is pretty good.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">If Varmus lived in fear 
  of potholes in the second half of his tenure at NIH, it didn&#146;t show. When 
  he perceived science to be at stake, he stood his ground in its defense. One 
  example was sticking his neck out for universal online access to the scientific 
  literature, despite heavy opposition from some scientific publishers (see &quot;<a href="http://catalyst.cit.nih.gov/catalyst/1999/99.07.01/page1.html">Varmus 
  Champions Free Cyberspace Access to All Biomedical research Reports</a>&quot;). 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">In January 2000, a revised 
  version of the E-biomed concept will go online as &quot;<a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov">PubMed 
  Central</a>&quot; and will begin receiving, storing, and distributing content&#151;including 
  peer-reviewed articles, preprints, and other screened reports from existing 
  journals, new journals, and reputable scientific organizations that have agreed 
  to participate.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">In another skirmish&#151;the 
  quest for degree-granting authority for an NIH graduate program&#151;Varmus 
  opted to retrench when faced with opposition from a few members of his Advisory 
  Committee. A revised plan calls instead for improving and expanding opportunities 
  for graduate students to be trained at NIH and receive diplomas from partner 
  institutions (see &quot;<a href="http://catalyst.cit.nih.gov/catalyst/1999/99.07.01/page2a.html">NIH 
  Morphs Graduate School Idea</a>&quot;).</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Another difficult issue&#151;human 
  embryonic stem cell research&#151;was still looming as <i>The Catalyst</i> went 
  to press. Earlier this year, Varmus said that research using human pluripotent 
  stem cells was not illegal, according to an opinion by HHS attorneys. Given 
  its potential, the work should be supported by federal funds and in accordance 
  with federal guidelines, he said. Such work now remains verboten pending finalization 
  of the guidelines and oversight procedures.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b><font color="#00003F">The 
  Road Ahead</font></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">For many of Varmus&#146; 
  admirers, it is exactly such quagmires that now make him almost indispensable. 
  Contrary to Varmus&#146; midterm prediction, his six years are not seen by others 
  as a time of accumulating mistakes but of increasingly assured defense of NIH&#146;s 
  core values. Says NHGRI director <a href="http://www.nih.gov/cgi-bin/ph-www.pl?alias=fc23a">Francis 
  Collins</a>, Varmus &quot;has made good science the essential currency for all 
  discussions about NIH&#146;s present and future. He has inspired an unprecedented 
  level of trust and respect from the leadership of the Congress and the Administration.&quot; 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Looking back at some of 
  the matters Varmus tackled earlier in his tenure, Collins says the NIH director 
  &quot;has been brilliant in his methods of addressing difficult problems&#151;from 
  mouse genomics to research tools and intellectual property&#151;by convincing 
  the best and brightest of this generation of scientists and policy experts to 
  devote their most determined energies to helping solve the problems at hand. 
  . . . He has never sacrificed ideals and truth for expediency, even if it involved 
  bucking the tide,&quot; Collins says.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1"> Offering promise for 
  the future, Collins says, is that Varmus &quot;has recruited a superb cadre 
  of NIH scientific leadership (I can say that because I&#146;m not one of them&#151;I 
  was already here!) who will continue his legacy for a long time to come.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">NICHD director <a href="http://www.nih.gov/cgi-bin/ph-www.pl?alias=da43w">Duane 
  Alexander</a> says that the combination of gifts Varmus has brought to NIH over 
  his short tenure here were responsible for one of the most conspicuous and enviable 
  advances NIH has made in the past couple of years&#150;its budget increases. 
  "Dr. Varmus has had an enormous impact on NIH in a relatively short time. He 
  has markedly increased the cooperation and collaboration among institutes, to 
  the benefit of everyone," says Alexander. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">"His presence here and 
  the atmosphere he has created have made it easier for all of us to recruit top-notch 
  scientists to NIH, both intramurally and extramurally. His personal interactions 
  with the Congress and the sense of confidence in this institution he has inspired 
  have been major factors in the remarkable increases in funding that have come 
  to NIH."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Filling Varmus&#146; shoes 
  is just the beginning for Shalala&#146;s search committee. Finding someone whose 
  appointment at the end of a Democratic administration could be confirmed by 
  a Republican Congress will surely be tougher. And persuading someone to accept 
  the position under these tenuous conditions may be the ultimate challenge. In 
  the meantime, Shalala has named NIH Deputy Director <a href="http://www.nih.gov/cgi-bin/ph-www.pl?alias=rk25n">Ruth 
  Kirschstein</a> to be acting director until a permanent replacement is found 
  [see box]. &quot;We will give Ruth all the support she needs,&quot; Shalala 
  promised the crowd at the town meeting. &quot;This [NIH] is the crown jewel 
  of my empire.&quot;</font><font face="Times"> </font> <img src="squares.jpg" width="10" height="10"></p>
