	<h1>FERC Aims to Simplify Licensing for Wave and Tidal Pilot Projects</h1>
	<p>The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is considering an
expedited licensing process for pilot projects involving wave and
tidal energy technologies. As noted by FERC, wave and tidal energy
technologies are in a developmental phase, presenting significant
risks for developers because of a limited access to financing and a
lack of information about the engineering and environmental
performance of the technologies. To help advance those technologies,
FERC is proposing a licensing process for pilot projects that could be
completed within six months. The process would be available for pilot
projects that are testing new technologies or determining appropriate
sites for larger facilities. The pilot projects must be five megawatts
or smaller in capacity, located in waters that have no sensitive
designations, and removable or able to shut down on relatively short
notice. The pilot projects could still be connected to the power
grid, both for study purposes and as a source of revenue. FERC will
convene a technical conference in Portland, Oregon, on October 2nd to
review the licensing proposal. See the <a href="http://www.ferc.gov/news/news-releases/2007/2007-3/07-19-07-hydro.asp">FERC press release</a>.</p>

<p>Wave and tidal energy projects are moving forward in several U.S.
locations. In June, officials in New York announced that a tidal
energy system on the bed of the East River had started generating
power for Roosevelt Island, which is part of the borough of Manhattan.
The Roosevelt Island Tidal Energy (RITE) project was built by Verdant
Power, Inc. and features six 35-kilowatt axial-flow turbines that are
now generating 1,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity per day. The
project is providing power to a supermarket and a parking garage on
the island. Meanwhile, the Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) in
California is working with the City and County of San Francisco and
the Golden Gate Energy Company to explore tidal power options in San
Francisco Bay, and the Snohomish County Public Utility District (PUD)
in Washington State is examining seven possible tidal energy sites
along its coast. See the press releases from
<a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/om/html/2007a/pr182-07.html">New York City</a> and <a href="http://www.pge.com/news/news_releases/q2_2007/070619a.html">PG&E</a>, the <a href="http://verdantpower.com/">Verdant Power Web site</a>,
