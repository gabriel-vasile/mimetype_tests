<P>QUESTIONS PRESENTED</P>

<P>In Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678 (2001), this Court interpreted 8 U.S.C.
1231(a)(6) to limit the detention of permanent resident aliens following
final orders directing their removal from the United States, thereby avoiding
constitutional concerns. The Court held that a resident alien may not be
detained under Section 1231(a)(6) for more than six months after being ordered
removed, if the alien demonstrates that there is not a significant likelihood
of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future, and no special circumstances
warrant continued detention. The Court distinguished Shaughnessy v. United
States ex rel. Mezei, 345 U.S. 206 (1953), which held that indefinite detention
of an alien who has not gained entry into the United States, pending the
alien's removal from the United States, does not violate due process. The
questions presented are:</P>

<P>1. Whether the six-month rule of Zadvydas applies to respondents, who
are inadmissible aliens apprehended at the border of the United States,
and who have been ordered excluded from the United States.</P>

<P>2. Whether, as the court of appeals believed, this Court has implicitly
overruled Mezei.</P>

<P>ON PETITION FOR A WRIT OF CERTIORARI<BR>
TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS<BR>
FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT<BR>
</P>

<P>PETITION FOR A WRIT OF CERTIORARI</P>

<P>The Solicitor General, on behalf of George E. Snyder, Warden of the Federal
Medical Center in Lexington, Kentucky; Randy J. Davis, Warden of the Federal
Correctional Institution in Memphis, Tennessee; and the Bureau of Immigration
and Customs Enforcement of the United States Department of Homeland Security,1
respectfully petitions for a writ of certiorari to review the judgment of
the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in these cases,
which the court of appeals consolidated for oral argument en banc.</P>

<P>OPINIONS BELOW</P>

<P>The en banc opinion of the court of appeals (App., infra, 1a-64a) is
reported at 322 F.3d 386. The orders of the district courts (App., infra,
170a-192a, 195a-200a) are unreported.</P>

<P>JURISDICTION</P>

<P>The judgment of the court of appeals was entered on March 5, 2003. The
jurisdiction of this Court is invoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1).</P>

<P>CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS, STATUTES, <BR>
AND REGULATIONS INVOLVED<BR>
</P>

<P>Relevant constitutional, statutory, and regulatory provisions are set
out in an appendix to this petition. App., infra, 203a-211a.</P>

<P>STATEMENT</P>

<P>Respondents were among approximately 125,000 Cuban nationals, many of
them convicted criminals in Cuba, who attempted to enter the United States
illegally during the 1980 Mariel boatlift. After Cuba refused to accept
the return of Mariel Cubans who were stopped at the border and denied entry
into the United States, the Attorney General, through the Immigration and
Naturalization Service (INS), soon paroled all but a few hundred of those
Cubans into this country pursuant to 8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(5) (1976 &amp; Supp.
IV 1980). See generally Fernandez-Roque v. Smith, 734 F.2d 576, 578-579
(11th Cir. 1984); Palma v. Verdeyen, 676 F.2d 100, 101-102 (4th Cir. 1982).
Section 1182(d)(5)(A) then authorized, and as amended continues to authorize,
the Attorney General to parole aliens applying for admission to the United
States into the country temporarily on conditions he prescribes, but provides
that &quot;such parole of such alien shall not be regarded as an admission
of the alien.&quot; 8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(5)(A). Section 1182(d)(5)(A) also provides
that when, in the opinion of the Attorney General, the purposes of the alien's
parole have been served, the alien shall forthwith be returned to custody
&quot;and thereafter his case shall continue to be dealt with in the same
manner as that of any other applicant for admission to the United States.&quot;</P>

<P>In 1984, the United States and Cuba reached an accord concerning immigration
between the two countries, including the return of 2746 specified individuals
with serious criminal backgrounds or mental infirmities. See Immigration
Joint Communique Between the United States of America and Cuba, Dec. 14,
1984, available at 1984 WL 161941. Approximately 1630 Mariel Cubans have
been repatriated to Cuba under the 1984 accord. Repatriations most recently
occurred in January and March 2003.</P>

<P>Pursuant to Section 1182(d)(5)(A), the Attorney General promulgated regulations
in 1987 governing the parole and revocation of parole of any Mariel Cuban
(defined to include any native of Cuba who last came to the United States
between April 15, 1980, and October 20, 1980) pending either an exclusion
hearing or his or her return to Cuba or another country. See 8 C.F.R. 212.12;
52 Fed. Reg. 48,802 (1987). Those regulations supplement the general regulations
governing the parole and release of aliens who are seeking admission to
the United States. See 8 C.F.R. 212.5, 241.4.</P>

<P>In 1990, Congress added new a new statutory provision, 8 U.S.C. 1226(e)
(1994), which imposed limitations on the Attorney General's power to grant
parole to excludable aliens. See Immigration Act of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-649,
&sect; 504(b), 104 Stat. 5050. Section 1226(e)(1) provided that, pending
a determination of excludability, the Attorney General &quot;shall take
into custody&quot; any alien convicted of an aggravated felony. 8 U.S.C.
1226(e)(1) (1994). Section 1226(e)(2) and (3) then provided that the Attorney
General &quot;shall not release such felon from custody&quot; unless the
Attorney General determined under 8 U.S.C. 1253(g) (1994) that the alien's
country of removability would not accept his return and, inter alia, the
Attorney General concluded, after review of the alien's request for relief
and the severity of the alien's felony, that &quot;the alien will not pose
a danger to the safety of other persons or to property.&quot; 8 U.S.C. 1226(e)(2)
and (3) (1994). Section 1226(e) otherwise left unaffected the Attorney General's
discretion to grant or revoke parole under Section 1182(d)(5)(A).</P>

<P>In the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of
1996 (IIRIRA), Pub. L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009-546, Congress added a
new Section 1231 to Title 8 of the United States Code. Section 1231(a)(1)
requires the detention for 90 days of aliens who have been ordered removed
from the United States (including aliens who have been stopped at the border
and were regarded as &quot;excludable&quot; under prior law).2 Section 1231(a)(6)
then provides that an alien ordered removed who is inadmissible under 8
U.S.C. 1182 or deportable for the commission of a specified crime, or who
has been determined by the Attorney General to be a risk to the community
or unlikely to comply with the order of removal, &quot;may be detained beyond
the [90-day] removal period.&quot; See Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678,
682, 688-689 (2001).</P>

<P>1. Rosales-Garcia</P>

<P>a. Respondent Rosales-Garcia was apprehended at the border in May 1980,
and prevented from entering the United States. App., infra, 3a-4a, 67a.
On May 20, 1980, the INS granted Rosales-Garcia temporary immigration parole
pursuant to 8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(5)(A). App., infra, 5a, 67a. In September 1981,
while on immigration parole, Rosales-Garcia committed grand theft, for which
he was sentenced to two years' probation. In October 1981, while still on
immigration parole, Rosales-Garcia was convicted of marijuana possession
and resisting arrest and sentenced to probation. Id. at 5a; C.A. App. 183
(No. 99-5683). In October 1983, while still on immigration parole, he was
convicted of burglary and grand larceny and sentenced to consecutive six-month
sentences. In February 1984, while still on immigration parole, he was convicted
of escaping from a penal institution and sentenced to 366 days' imprisonment.
Id. at 5a.</P>

<P>In July 1986, after Rosales-Garcia completed his sentences, the INS revoked
his immigration parole pursuant to 8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(5)(A) and 8 C.F.R. 212.5(d)(2)
(1986), because it determined that his continued release into the community
was against the public interest and that he should be detained pending exclusion
proceedings. See App., infra, 6a. The INS commenced exclusion proceedings
by charging Rosales-Garcia with being excludable under, inter alia, 8 U.S.C.
1182(a)(20) (1982), as an alien not in possession of an immigrant visa or
other valid entry document. In June 1987, an immigration judge determined
that Rosales-Garcia is excludable, denied his request for asylum, and ordered
his removal from the United States. App., infra, 68a-69a. The United States
has not been able to remove Rosales-Garcia because Cuba has not agreed to
accept his return. Id. at 5a.</P>

<P>In May 1988, the INS released Rosales-Garcia on immigration parole for
the second time. App., infra, 6a. In March 1993, Rosales-Garcia was convicted
in federal court of conspiring to possess cocaine with intent to distribute
it. He was sentenced to 63 months' imprisonment, followed by five years'
supervised release. Id. at 5a-6a.</P>

<P>In March 1997, the Attorney General revoked Rosales-Garcia's second immigration
parole because of the 1993 conviction. App., infra, 69a. Accordingly, when
Rosales-Garcia was released from federal prison in May 1997, he was returned
to INS custody. Id. at 6a. As required by the parole regulations applicable
to Mariel Cubans, see 8 C.F.R. 212.12(g), the INS reviewed Rosales-Garcia's
custody status annually. He was denied re-parole in 1998 and 1999. App.,
infra, 6a, 70a-71a, 171a-172a. In May 2000, however, the INS determined
that Rosales-Garcia was releasable under the regulations, see 8 C.F.R. 212.12(d),
and he was placed in a halfway house. App., infra, 71a n.7. Rosales-Garcia
completed that program in May 2001 and was paroled into the community under
conditions of supervision. Id. at 6a.</P>

<P>b. Meanwhile, in July 1998, Rosales-Garcia filed a habeas corpus petition
under 28 U.S.C. 2241 in the United States District Court for the Eastern
District of Kentucky, claiming in relevant part that the revocation of his
second parole in March 1997 and his continued detention violated due process.
App., infra, 6a, 172a. In May 1999, the district court dismissed the petition.
Id. at 170a-194a. The court believed that Rosales-Garcia's detention was
subject to 8 U.S.C. 1231(a), even though that provision was enacted after
his exclusion proceedings were completed. App., infra, 184a. On that premise,
the court concluded (id. 181a-187a) that after an order of removal has been
entered against an alien stopped at the border, detention beyond the 90-day
removal period is authorized by that statute.</P>

<P>The district court rejected Rosales-Garcia's due process challenge to
his detention. The court found &quot;no basis&quot; for Rosales-Garcia's
claim to have a liberty interest in being released into the United States,
App., infra, 187a, and observed that &quot;the law is clear that excludable
aliens&quot; in Rosales-Garcia's position &quot;have only the procedural
due process rights afforded by Congress,&quot; id. at 188a. See id. at 187a-189a
(discussing, e.g., Landon v. Plasencia, 459 U.S. 21, 32 (1982), and United
States ex rel. Knauff v. Shaughnessy, 338 U.S. 537, 544 (1950)). The court
determined that Rosales-Garcia had received the full process to which he
was entitled under the immigration laws and the 1987 administrative regulations
that assure detained Mariel Cubans annual parole reviews. Id. at 190a-191a;
see id. at 205a-211a (reproducing relevant regulations).</P>

<P>c. In January 2001, a divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals
for the Sixth Circuit reversed. App., infra, 65a-139a. As a threshold matter,
the court of appeals held that the INS's intervening decision to place Rosales-Garcia
in a halfway house, as a step toward a third parole, did not render the
case moot. Id. at 79a-83a.</P>

<P>The panel next determined (App., infra, 84a-85a) that Rosales-Garcia's
detention is governed by 8 U.S.C. 1226(e) (1994), rather than the current
8 U.S.C. 1231(a)(6) as the district court believed. The panel reasoned that
Rosales-Garcia was ordered excluded, and his immigration parole was last
revoked, before the April 1, 1997, effective date of IIRIRA, see Pub. L.
No. 104-208, &sect; 309(c)(1), 110 Stat. 3009-625, which added the new 8
U.S.C. 1231. The panel determined that former Section 1226(e) provided unambiguous
statutory authority for Rosales-Garcia's detention. App., infra, 85a-87a.</P>

<P>Turning to whether Rosales-Garcia's statutorily authorized detention
violated due process, the panel determined, in disagreement with the district
court, that indefinite detention of an excludable alien would implicate
a liberty interest protected by the Fifth Amendment. App., infra, 91a-98a.
The panel further concluded that, although Rosales-Garcia's continued detention
was rationally related to the government's non-punitive interest in protecting
society, the detention was unconstitutionally excessive because it was indefinite
in duration. Id. at 99a-111a. The panel stated that the automatic annual
review afforded under administrative regulations &quot;does not affect the
nature of [Rosales-Garcia's] detention as indefinite,&quot; id. at 108a,
because he &quot;can never be certain of receiving such parole,&quot; id.
at 109a.</P>

<P>District Judge Rice, sitting by designation, dissented. In his view,
excludable aliens such as Rosales-Garcia can claim no liberty interest in
being free from detention in the United States and, even if a liberty interest
is implicated, detention with annual parole reviews is not excessive in
relation to the government's non-punitive purposes of enforcing the immigration
laws and protecting public safety. App., infra, 112a-139a.</P>

<P>d. In June 2001, this Court decided Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678,
which addressed the legality of the continued detention under 8 U.S.C. 1231(a)(6)
of aliens who were admitted to the United States as permanent resident aliens,
and later ordered removed, but who could not be removed within the 90-day
statutory removal period. The Court construed Section 1231(a)(6) &quot;to
contain an implicit 'reasonable time' limitation.&quot; 533 U.S. at 682.
In particular, to avoid a serious constitutional question, the Court construed
the Attorney General's authority to detain the former permanent resident
aliens under Section 1231(a)(6) to be limited to the period of time reasonably
necessary to remove them from the United States. 533 U.S. at 689. &quot;[F]or
the sake of uniform administration,&quot; the Court further determined that
detention for a period of six months is presumptively reasonable. Id. at
701. After that presumptively reasonable period, if &quot;the alien provides
good reason to believe that there is no significant likelihood of removal
in the reasonably foreseeable future, the Government must respond with evidence
sufficient to rebut that showing.&quot; Ibid.</P>

<P>The Court emphasized in Zadvydas that &quot;[a]liens who have not yet
gained initial admission to this country would present a very different
question,&quot; which was not before the Court. 533 U.S. at 682. Furthermore,
in its analysis of the potential constitutional problem posed by detention
of deportable permanent resident aliens, the Court rejected the United States'
reliance on Shaughnessy v. United States ex rel. Mezei, 345 U.S. 206 (1953).
In Mezei, the Court had held that ongoing detention of an alien who unsuccessfully
sought entry into the United States but could not be removed did not violate
due process. See 345 U.S. at 210-216. In Zadvydas, the Court stated that
Mezei &quot;differs from [Zadvydas] in a critical respect,&quot; because
Mezei's detention on Ellis Island was a continuation of his exclusion and
did not count as a successful entry into the United States. 533 U.S. at
693. The Court noted that aliens stopped at the border remain applicants
seeking initial admission to the United States even if they are physically
present in the country. Ibid. (citing Kaplan v. Tod, 267 U.S. 228, 230 (1925),
and Leng May Ma v. Barber, 357 U.S. 185, 188-190 (1958)). Mezei's legal
status as an excludable alien at the border, the Court explained in Zadvydas,
&quot;made all the difference.&quot; Ibid.</P>

<P>e. After Zadvydas, the government petitioned for a writ of certiorari
in the Rosales-Garcia case, requesting that the Sixth Circuit's panel decision
be vacated and remanded in light of Zadvydas and its discussion of Mezei.
See Pet. at 14-22, Thoms v. Rosales-Garcia, No. 01-285 (filed Aug. 15, 2001).
The government noted that a remand also would allow the court of appeals
to reconsider its determination that the case was not moot, because Rosales-Garcia
had completed his halfway house program after the court of appeals issued
its decision. Id. at 22.</P>

<P>On December 10, 2001, this Court granted the government's petition, vacated
the judgment of the court of appeals, and remanded the case for further
consideration in light of Zadvydas. 534 U.S. 1063.</P>

<P>2. Carballo</P>

<P>a. Like Rosales-Garcia, respondent Carballo is a Mariel Cuban who was
apprehended at the border in May 1980. App., infra, 5a, 145a. The INS detained
Carballo but soon granted him immigration parole. Id. at 7a, 145a. In April
1983, after having been arrested 16 times, Carballo was convicted of attempted
first-degree murder, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, and robbery.
Id. at 7a-8a. He was sentenced to concurrent prison sentences of eight years
for attempted murder, five years for aggravated assault, and eight years
for robbery. Id. at 8a; C.A. App. 96, 107-109 (No. 99-5698).</P>

<P>In November 1983, the INS revoked Carballo's immigration parole. App.,
infra, 196a. In June 1988, when Carballo was released from prison, the INS
took him into custody. Id. at 8a. In September 1994, an immigration judge
ordered Carballo excluded from the United States for not possessing a valid
entry document, 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I) (1994), and for having been
convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude and multiple offenses for
which the sentence to confinement was five years or more, 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I),
(a)(2)(B) (1994). App., infra, 8a.</P>

<P>Carballo &quot;developed a sizable disciplinary record&quot; while in
immigration custody. App., infra, 146a. The INS denied Carballo release
in several annual parole reviews but, in December 2002, paroled him to a
nine-month, residential substance-abuse program. Id. at 8a, 146a.</P>

<P>b. Meanwhile, in December 1998, Carballo filed a habeas corpus petition
under 28 U.S.C. 2241 in the United States District Court for the Western
District of Tennessee. Carballo challenged the Attorney General's statutory
and constitutional authority to detain him, and asserted that his continued
detention violates international law. App., infra, 8a, 199a. Carballo had
presented similar claims in 1990, in a habeas corpus petition that the United
States District Court for the Northern District of Texas denied. Id. at
8a-9a. In May 1998, the Tennessee district court denied Carballo's second
petition under the law-of-the-case doctrine. Id. at 195a-200a.</P>

<P>c. In October 2001, a Sixth Circuit panel affirmed the denial of Carballo's
second habeas petition, on the ground that it was barred as a successive
petition. App., infra, 140a-169a.</P>

<P>In particular, the court determined that the January 2001 panel decision
in Rosales-Garcia, which had not yet been vacated by this Court, did not
constitute an intervening change in the law that would allow consideration
of Carballo's second petition on the merits. App., infra, 163a-169a. Like
the Rosales-Garcia panel, the Carballo panel determined that 8 U.S.C. 1226(e)
(1994), rather than 8 U.S.C. 1231(a)(6), authorized the detention. See App.,
infra, 155a-158a. But the Carballo panel further determined that the Rosales-Garcia
panel's conclusion that excludable aliens have a protected liberty interest
in freedom from detention &quot;cannot survive the Supreme Court's decision
in Zadvydas[,] and that under the analysis of Mezei the Fifth Amendment
does not present an obstacle to the potentially indefinite detention of
an excludable alien.&quot; Id. at 169a. Accordingly, the panel determined
that there had been no material change in the law since Carballo's first
habeas corpus petition was denied, and that the second petition is a prohibited
successive petition. Ibid.</P>

<P>3. The Consolidated En Banc Proceeding</P>

<P>In November 2001, the court of appeals entered a sua sponte order vacating
the panel decision in Carballo and ordering that the case be reheard en
banc. App., infra, 201a-202a. After this Court vacated the panel decision
in Rosales-Garcia and remanded for further consideration in light of Zadvydas,
Rosales-Garcia was consolidated with Carballo for argument before the Sixth
Circuit en banc. Id. at 7a. A divided en banc court of appeals reversed
the district courts' denials of both habeas corpus petitions. Id. at 1a-64a.3</P>

<P>a. At the outset, the court rejected the government's argument that the
INS's parole of Rosales-Garcia into the community mooted his habeas petition.
Stating that Rosales-Garcia's parole &quot;can be revoked by the INS at
any time for almost any reason,&quot; App., infra, 13a (citing 8 C.F.R.
212.12(b)(1) and (h)), the court concluded that Rosales-Garcia's parole
is a &quot;reprieve from detention&quot; rather than &quot;a termination
of detention&quot; and, furthermore, that Rosales-Garcia is &quot;threatened
with an actual injury traceable to [the government] and likely to be redressed
by a favorable judicial decision,&quot; id. at 13a-14a. The court of appeals
also relied on the exceptions to mootness that address the defendant's voluntary
cessation of the challenged conduct, and conduct that is capable of repetition,
yet evading review. Id. at 14a-17a.</P>

<P>The court of appeals likewise determined that Carballo's habeas corpus
petition is not barred as a successive petition, because, as the court held
later in its opinion, Zadvydas changed the relevant law. App., infra, 17a-23a.</P>

<P>b. Addressing the habeas petitions on the merits, the en banc court first
determined that any statutory basis for respondents' detention is found
in 8 U.S.C. 1231(a)(6), which was enacted in 1996 as part of IIRIRA. In
holding that current Section 1231(a)(6) applies, the court of appeals relied
primarily (App., infra, 26a-27a) upon INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289 (2001).
This Court stated in St. Cyr that a provision of IIRIRA that generally makes
IIRIRA's amendments inapplicable to aliens, like respondents, who were placed
in exclusion or deportation proceedings before April 1, 1997, &quot;is best
read as merely setting out the procedural rules to be applied to removal
proceedings pending on the effective date of the statute.&quot; 533 U.S.
at 318 (discussing IIRIRA &sect; 309(c), 110 Stat. 3009-625). Because respondents'
challenge here is to their detention after final exclusion orders were entered
against them, as distinguished from the conduct of the exclusion proceedings
themselves, the court of appeals concluded that the IIRIRA effective-date
provision discussed in St. Cyr does not apply and current law should govern.
App., infra, 27a-28a.</P>

<P>c. The court of appeals next concluded that, even though respondents
are excludable aliens who were denied admission at the border, the limiting
construction of 8 U.S.C. 1231(a)(6) that this Court set forth in Zadvydas
controls their detention. The court of appeals stated that it did &quot;not
believe that the Supreme Court intended to construe &sect; 1231(a)(6) differently
for aliens [like respondents] who are removable on grounds of inadmissibility
and aliens [like the permanent resident aliens in Zadvydas] who are removable
on grounds of deportability.&quot; App., infra, 32a.</P>

<P>The court of appeals acknowledged that the six-month rule of Zadvydas
responded specifically to &quot;the constitutional concerns raised by the
indefinite detention of aliens who are removable on grounds of deportability,&quot;
as opposed to aliens who are denied admission at the border. App., infra,
33a. But the court of appeals found it critical (id. at 31a-32a, 37a) that
Section 1231(a)(6) does not make an express distinction between aliens stopped
at the border and aliens ordered deported after entering the United States.</P>

<P>The court of appeals thus concluded that respondents &quot;may * * *
take advantage of&quot; Zadvydas's statutory interpretation even if their
own cases &quot;do[] not present the constitutional problem that prompted
the statutory interpretation.&quot; App., infra, 34a (quoting Lin Guo Xi
v. INS, 298 F.3d 832, 839 (9th Cir. 2002)). In extending Zadvydas's holding
in that manner, the court relied in part on the fact that IIRIRA changed
immigration-law nomenclature by establishing a new class of &quot;inadmissible&quot;
aliens that includes (but is not limited to) aliens denied admission at
the border, who formerly were known as &quot;excludable&quot; aliens. See
note 2, supra. In the court of appeals' view (id. at 35a-37a), the absence
from Section 1231(a)(6) of any specific reference to post-removal-period
detention of those inadmissible aliens who formerly would have been deemed
&quot;excludable&quot; suggests that those aliens should be subject to the
same rules that Zadvydas articulated for post-final-order detention of resident
aliens.</P>

<P>d. The court of appeals acknowledged that &quot;it is not completely
clear from * * * Zadvydas how the Court intended its statutory analysis
to be applied.&quot; App., infra, 38a; see id. at 43a (&quot;[W]e recognize
that the Zadvydas Court left open the question whether the indefinite detention
of excludable aliens raises the same constitutional concerns * * * as the
indefinite detention of aliens who have entered the United States.&quot;).
But the court then stated that, regardless of the correctness of its extension
of the statutory holding in Zadvydas, &quot;constitutional concerns would
independently compel us to construe IIRIRA's post-removal-period detention
provision to contain a reasonableness limitation for excludable aliens.&quot;
Id. at 38a.</P>

<P>In support of that alternative holding, the court of appeals expressed
&quot;vehement[]&quot; disagreement (App., infra, 40a) with the proposition
that constitutional due process principles are not implicated when the government
detains an alien who has been stopped at the border while seeking to enter
the United States illegally. The court of appeals stated that although such
excluded aliens have not achieved entry into the country as a matter of
law, see Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 693, they nevertheless are &quot;persons
living in the United States&quot; who &quot;must&quot; be able to invoke
due process protections against their &quot;treatment&quot; by the government.
App., infra, 42a</P>

<P>The court of appeals further reasoned that &quot;[i]f the Due Process
Clause of the Fifth Amendment applies to [respondents], as we believe that
it must, we do not see how we could conclude that the indefinite and potentially
permanent detention of [respondents] raises any less serious constitutional
concerns than the indefinite and potentially permanent detention of the
aliens in Zadvydas.&quot; App., infra, 47a. In particular, the court rejected
the government's argument that respondents may be detained to enforce the
sovereign right of preventing their entry into the United States. See Mezei,
345 U.S. at 210, 215-216. According to the court of appeals (App., infra,
47a), conditional immigration parole provides a constitutionally compelled
alternative to detention when the alien cannot be returned to his country
of origin after being denied admission.</P>

<P>The contrary holding of Mezei, the court of appeals said, &quot;does
not govern&quot; respondents' detention because (1) in the court of appeals'
view, Mezei was &quot;grounded * * * in the special circumstances of&quot;
the Cold War and Korean conflict and a &quot;determination by the Attorney
General that Mezei presented a threat to national security,&quot; App.,
infra, 49a-50a &amp; n.33, and (2) Mezei has been &quot;eclipsed&quot; (id.
at 50a) and &quot;fatally undermined by&quot; (id. at 52a) United States
v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739 (1987), and other cases that have limited civil
detention outside the immigration area.</P>

<P>For those reasons, the court invoked the canon of constitutional avoidance
to construe Section 1231(a) to place precisely the same limitation on detention
of respondents, who have been excluded from entry into the United States,
as Zadvydas placed on detention of permanent resident aliens who have been
found to be deportable. App., infra, 52a-53a. Finding &quot;no significant
likelihood that [respondents] will be removed in the reasonably foreseeable
future[,] and because the INS has detained them longer than six months,&quot;
the court of appeals &quot;conclude[d] that the INS's detention of [respondents]
is no longer reasonable and is therefore not authorized by IIRIRA's post-removal-period
detention provision.&quot; Id. at 53a.</P>

<P>e. Judge Boggs, joined by Judges Krupansky and Batchelder, dissented.
App., infra, 54a-64a. The three dissenting judges stated that the majority's
due process analysis &quot;cannot be derived from the text of the Constitution
and is contrary to [Mezei], which the Supreme Court [in Zadvydas] has recently
explicitly relied on and refused to overrule.&quot; Id. at 54a. They also
noted (id. at 57a-58a) that the Sixth Circuit's approach conflicts with
decisions of other circuits, and effects &quot;a disabling of congressional
policy choices&quot; (id. at 60a) about who should be allowed into United
States territory.</P>

<P>The dissenting judges found it &quot;remarkabl[e]&quot; to apply IIRIRA,
which &quot;tighten[ed] immigration regulations,&quot; in a way that gives
excludable aliens a new-found entitlement to release from detention. App.,
infra, 61a. They further deemed it &quot;a natural consequence&quot; (id.
at 63a) of Zadvydas's reliance on the constitutional-avoidance canon that
Section 1231(a)(6) should be applied differently to deportable aliens (as
to whom this Court found a serious constitutional question) than to aliens
stopped at the border (as to whom no such question exists under Mezei).
See id. at 61a-64a.</P>

<P>REASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION</P>

<P>The Sixth Circuit's extension of the six-month rule of Zadvydas v. Davis,
533 U.S. 678 (2001)-from the context of deportable former permanent resident
aliens presented in Zadvydas to the context of excludable aliens stopped
at the border while attempting to enter illegally-is incorrect, deepens
a circuit split, and has great practical importance. Furthermore, the Sixth
Circuit made a fundamental error of constitutional law when it determined,
in conflict with Shaughnessy v. United States ex rel. Mezei, 345 U.S. 206
(1953), and decisions of every other circuit to address the question, that
due process principles entitle respondents to be released into the United
States. This Court's review is warranted to establish the correct application
of Zadvydas to aliens detained after being stopped at the border, and to
correct the court of appeals' erroneous due process holding.4</P>

<P>1. a. The lower courts are divided about whether Zadvydas's finding of
an implied limitation on detention under 8 U.S.C. 1231(a)(6), which was
prompted by constitutional doubt about the lawfulness of indefinite detention
of permanent resident aliens who were ordered deported, applies to aliens
who have been stopped at the border and denied admission to the United States.
In the decision below, the en banc Sixth Circuit held, over a dissent, that
Zadvydas's six-month rule applies to respondents as excludable aliens. Similarly,
in Lin Guo Xi v. INS, 298 F.3d 832 (2002), a Ninth Circuit panel held, over
a dissent, &quot;that Zadvydas applies to inadmissible individuals,&quot;
id. at 836; see id. at 840-843 (Rymer, J., dissenting).</P>

<P>Those Sixth and Ninth Circuit decisions conflict with Rios v. INS, No.
02-40766, 2003 WL 734159 (5th Cir. Jan. 28, 2003) (per curiam) (designated
for publication). In Rios, a Mariel Cuban who was stopped at the border
in 1980 challenged his detention after revocation of parole on the basis
that it violates his constitutional rights and is not authorized by statute.
The Fifth Circuit upheld the ongoing detention, emphasizing that Zadvydas
&quot;distinguished the status of deportable aliens from that of excludable
aliens.&quot; 2003 WL 734159, at *1. Similarly, the Tenth Circuit has stated
after Zadvydas that Section 1231(a)(6) preserves the discretion of the Attorney
General (now exercised by the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement,
see note 1, supra) whether to deny immigration parole to an excluded Mariel
Cuban. Sierra v. INS, 258 F.3d 1213, 1219 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 534
U.S. 1071 (2001).5</P>

<P>District courts in other circuits also disagree about whether the rule
of Zadvydas applies to aliens who have been denied entry to the United States.
Compare, e.g., Herrero-Rodriguez v. Bailey, 237 F. Supp. 2d 543, 547-551
(D.N.J. 2002) (Zadvydas inapplicable to detention of excludable Mariel Cuban);
Soto-Ramirez v. Ashcroft, 228 F. Supp. 2d 566, 570-572 (M.D. Pa. 2002) (same),
appeal pending, No. 02-4145 (3d Cir. docketed Nov. 14, 2002); Morales v.
Conley, 224 F. Supp. 2d 1070, 1074-1075 (S.D. W. Va. 2002) (same), with
Borrero v. Aljets, 178 F. Supp. 2d 1034, 1039-1044 (D. Minn. 2001) (applying
Zadvydas to detention of inadmissible Mariel Cuban), appeal pending, No.
02-1506 (8th Cir. argued Dec. 11, 2002).</P>

<P>b. The Sixth and Ninth Circuits' extension of Zadvydas is incorrect.
Zadvydas addressed only Section 1231(a)(6)'s application to &quot;aliens
who were admitted to the United States but subsequently ordered removed.&quot;
533 U.S. at 682. The Court noted that detention of &quot;[a]liens who have
not yet gained initial admission to this country would present a very different
question.&quot; Ibid. Moreover, in distinguishing Mezei, the Court observed
that, even if aliens stopped at the border are paroled into the United States,
they remain as a matter of law applicants seeking initial admission to the
United States. Id. at 693 (citing cases). And the Court reaffirmed that
there is a &quot;critical&quot; distinction between detention of aliens
stopped at the border and detention of deportable aliens who have entered
the United States-a distinction that makes &quot;all the difference&quot;
for purposes of constitutional analysis. Ibid. Thus, as the Ninth Circuit
acknowledged in Lin Guo Xi, 298 F.3d at 839, ongoing detention of aliens
stopped at the border, who cannot be removed from the United States because
no country will accept them, does not present the &quot;constitutional problem,&quot;
533 U.S. at 696, that underlay the Court's construction of Section 1231(a)(6)
in Zadvydas.</P>

<P>The canon of constitutional avoidance, which supported the Court's inference
of an unarticulated statutory limitation on the detention of the aliens
before the Court in Zadvydas, therefore does not support the application
of a similar non-textual limitation on respondents' detention. By its plain
terms, 8 U.S.C. 1231(a)(6) states that the Attorney General &quot;may&quot;
detain specified aliens beyond the 90-day statutory removal period, and
does not limit the duration of that detention. The statutory language &quot;suggests
discretion,&quot; Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 697, and &quot;literally * * * sets
no limit on the length of time beyond the removal period that an alien who
falls within one of the Section 1231(a)(6) categories may be detained,&quot;
id. at 689 (internal quotation marks omitted). The constitutional-avoidance
canon is grounded in &quot;respect for Congress&quot; and &quot;minimize[s]
disagreement between the branches by preserving congressional enactments
that might otherwise founder on constitutional objections. It is not designed
to aggravate that friction.&quot; Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523
U.S. 224, 238 (1998). Accordingly, the canon should not be applied to create
an avoidable inconsistency with congressional intent as manifested in the
ordinary reading of statutory language. Yet that very sort of avoidable
friction between the Judicial and Legislative Branches is the direct result
of &quot;read[ing] an implicit limitation into the statute&quot; (Zadvydas,
533 U.S. at 689) with respect to the category of aliens at issue here, because
there is no due process problem when Section 1231(a)(6) is applied to those
aliens in accordance with its terms. See, e.g., App., infra, 61a-63a (Boggs,
J., dissenting); Lin Guo Xi, 298 F.3d at 841-842 (Rymer, J., dissenting).</P>

<P>The dissenting Justices in Zadvydas expressed concern that consistency
might dictate extending Zadvydas's interpretation of Section 1231(a)(6)
to &quot;inadmissible aliens, for instance those stopped at the border before
entry.&quot; 533 U.S. at 710 (Kennedy, J., dissenting). But even under that
view, Zadvydas would not require respondents' release. In the context of
deportable resident aliens, Zadvydas construed Section 1231(a)(6) as having
&quot;an implicit 'reasonable time' limitation,&quot; id. at 682, that is
best administered by establishing a rebuttable presumption that detention
for more than six months is unreasonable if the alien shows that removal
is not foreseeable. See id. at 696-702. The Court was clear that the statute
itself does not establish a six-month limitation on post-final-order detention
of any alien. See id. at 701. Therefore, if Zadvydas's construction of Section
1231(a)(6) did apply to respondents and other aliens stopped at the border,
there would be a &quot;reasonable time&quot; limitation on their detention,
but it would not follow that the implied &quot;reasonable time&quot; limitation
should be implemented through a six-month presumption. The Court's rationale
for adopting such a presumption in Zadvydas does not apply to aliens who
are stopped at the border and denied admission.</P>

<P>The Court explained in Zadvydas that detention of an alien becomes problematic
under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment when it &quot;no longer
bears a reasonable relation to the purpose for which the individual was
committed.&quot; 533 U.S. at 690 (quoting Jackson v. Indiana, 406 U.S. 715,
738 (1972)) (internal brackets and quotation marks omitted). The Court concluded
that when a permanent resident alien has been ordered deported, the &quot;basic
purpose&quot; of detention under Section 1231(a)(6) is &quot;assuring the
alien's presence&quot; for his physical removal from the country. Id. at
699. Therefore, if removal is not foreseeable, prolonged detention of a
deportable resident alien raises serious constitutional questions unless
it is justified by other considerations, such as protecting the community
against the alien's commission of other crimes. Id. at 699-700.</P>

<P>Unlike detention of deportable resident aliens, detention of aliens who
have been stopped at the border and ordered excluded effectuates the government's
interest in preventing the aliens' unlawful physical presence in the United
States in the first place. The exclusion orders entered against respondents
constitute determinations that respondents have not been, and should not
be, allowed to enter the United States. Respondents' continued detention
thus serves directly the political Branches' exercise of the fundamental
sovereign power to exclude aliens. See Fiallo v. Bell, 430 U.S. 787, 792
(1977). As the Court said in Mezei, exclusion is &quot;a fundamental sovereign
attribute exercised by the Government's political departments,&quot; and
the admission of an excluded alien may &quot;nullif[y] the very purpose
of the exclusion proceeding.&quot; 345 U.S. at 210, 216.</P>

<P>Under the analysis of Zadvydas, the detention of aliens stopped at the
border and denied entry therefore is reasonable and permissible beyond the
six-month period that was established for administrative convenience in
Zadvydas, see 533 U.S. at 701. Indeed, applying the six-month rule to aliens
stopped at the border would lead to the judicially compelled release of
excludable aliens into the United States, creating precisely the &quot;unprotected
spot in the Nation's armor&quot; that Zadvydas expressly disavowed. Id.
at 695-696 (quoting Kwong Hai Chew v. Colding, 344 U.S. 590, 602 (1953));
see Lin Guo Xi, 298 F.3d at 842 (Rymer, J., dissenting).</P>

<P>The court of appeals' application of Zadvydas's six-month rule to respondents
also conflicts with the parole provisions of 8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(5) and longstanding
policy regarding Mariel Cubans. Section 1182(d)(5)(A), which authorizes
the temporary parole into the United States of aliens who are applying for
admission, as well as the revocation of such parole, makes both the grant
of parole and its revocation entirely discretionary.6 Nothing in Section
1231(a)(6)-including any implicit limitation stated in Zadvydas-displaces
that independent authority to parole or revoke the parole of aliens, like
respondents, who have been stopped at the border. By contrast, in the case
of the former lawful permanent residents in Zadvydas, there was no independent
statutory basis for detention after the entry of a final order of removal.</P>

<P>It is nonsensical to read Section 1231(a)(6) as requiring the release
of respondents into the community after they have been ordered excluded
from the United States, when respondents could have been refused parole
under Section 1182(d)(5)(A) while their exclusion proceedings were pending,
and when Section 1182(d)(5)(A) expressly authorizes revocation of parole
at any time when its purposes have been served. Furthermore, prior to the
enactment of IIRIRA in 1996, the long-term detention of Mariel Cubans had
been upheld by numerous courts and had been the subject of congressional
hearings. See Barrera-Echavarria v. Rison, 44 F.3d 1441, 1447-1448 &amp;
nn. 4,5 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 976 (1995). It is not plausible
to conclude that Congress intended through new Section 1231(a)(6) to overturn
the large body of judicial precedent upholding denials of parole to Mariel
Cubans, see Guzman v. Tippy, 130 F.3d 64, 65 (2d Cir. 1997) (listing leading
cases), yet failed to amend Section 1182(d)(5)(A) to restrict the Attorney
General's discretion over parole decisions, and did not even mention such
an important policy change in the legislative history of IIRIRA.</P>

<P>Respondents, moreover, do not face a &quot;life sentence in prison,&quot;
as the court of appeals imagined. App., infra, 48a. Detained aliens who
have been ordered removed after being stopped at the border are entitled
to annual custody reviews. See 8 C.F.R. 212.12(g) (Mariel Cubans), 241.4(k)
(other aliens seeking admission). The rules applicable to respondents, for
example, permit release on parole if it is determined that the alien is
presently nonviolent, is likely to remain nonviolent, is not likely to pose
a threat to the community following his release, and is not likely to violate
the conditions of his parole. 8 C.F.R. 212.12(d)(2). Procedural safeguards
protect against arbitrary denials of parole. 8 C.F.R. 212.12(b), (c), (d)
and (g). Respondent Rosales-Garcia has obtained parole under those provisions,
and respondent Carballo has obtained placement in a halfway-house treatment
program.</P>

<P>c. The issue whether Zadvydas limits the detention of aliens who are
stopped at the border has great importance for the enforcement of the Nation's
immigration laws, foreign affairs, and national security. The Sixth and
Ninth Circuit decisions require the release into the United States of dangerous
aliens to whom Congress and the Executive Branch have denied admission.
Those decisions open a &quot;back door&quot; way into the United States
for persons from nations with which the United States does not have full
diplomatic relations, or that do not cooperate in repatriation of their
nationals. That new, court-created avenue of unlawful entry will encourage
illegal migration by inadmissible aliens from those countries. Cf. Sale
v. Haitian Ctrs. Council, Inc., 509 U.S. 155, 163-164, 187-188 (1993). If
not closed by this Court, the resulting gap in immigration enforcement may
prompt new steps to ensure that inadmissible aliens will not even reach
United States soil, resulting in immigration policies that may be less generous
to aliens than the policies that Congress and the Executive Branch have
pursued under the framework of Mezei. Cf. Mathews v. Diaz, 426 U.S. 67,
81-82 &amp; n.20 (1976) (noting danger of &quot;inhibit[ing] the flexibility
of the political branches of government to respond to changing world conditions,&quot;
and practical problems presented by extending new constitutional entitlements
to large classes of aliens); Leng May Ma v. Barber, 357 U.S. 185, 190 (1958);
Mezei, 345 U.S. at 215 (&quot;While the Government might keep entrants by
sea aboard their vessel pending determination of their admissibility, resulting
hardships to the alien and inconvenience to the carrier persuaded Congress
to adopt a more generous course.&quot;).</P>

<P>The Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement of the Department of
Homeland Security reports that it presently is detaining approximately 2057
arriving aliens who are under final orders of exclusion or removal. Approximately
1137 such arriving aliens, including 912 Mariel Cubans and 51 aliens currently
within the boundaries of the Sixth Circuit, have been detained for more
than six months. The potential court-ordered release of those criminal aliens,
whom the political Branches have determined should be denied entry into
the United States and should not be released even under conditions of supervision,
presents an immediate threat to public safety and implicates grave foreign
policy and national security concerns.</P>

<P>2. This Court also should grant review to correct the Sixth Circuit's
incorrect conclusion that Mezei has been &quot;eclipsed&quot; (App., infra,
50a) and &quot;fatally undermined by&quot; (id. at 52a) later decisions
of this Court.7 The court of appeals' determination that detention of aliens
stopped at the border is subject to the same due process analysis as detention
of permanent resident aliens or citizens, see id. at 43a-52a, conflicts
with the unanimous view of other courts of appeals. See Rios, 2003 WL 734159,
at *1; Lin Guo Xi, 298 F.3d at 837; Hoyte-Mesa v. Ashcroft, 272 F.3d 989,
991 (7th Cir. 2001), cert. denied, 123 S. Ct. 185 (2002); Sierra, 258 F.3d
at 1218; Kim Ho Ma v. Ashcroft, 257 F.3d 1095, 1107-1109 (9th Cir. 2001);
Chi Thon Ngo v. INS, 192 F.3d 390, 395-398 (3d Cir. 1999); Guzman, 130 F.3d
at 65-66; Barrera-Echavarria v. Rison, 44 F.3d at 1448-1450; Gisbert v.
United States Attorney Gen., 988 F.2d 1437, 1441-1444, amended, 997 F.2d
1122 (5th Cir. 1993); Garcia-Mir v. Smith, 766 F.2d 1478, 1450 (11th Cir.
1985), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1022 (1986); Palma v. Verdeyen, 676 F.2d 100,
103 (4th Cir. 1982). The Sixth Circuit's decision effectively establishes
a constitutional right of entry into the United States, which this Court
has consistently rejected. See Fiallo, 430 U.S. at 792; Kleindienst v. Mandel,
408 U.S. 753, 765-767 (1972); Mezei, 345 U.S. at 210, 215-216.</P>

<P>The Court reaffirmed in Zadvydas that &quot;[t]he distinction between
an alien who has effected an entry into the United States and one who has
never entered runs throughout immigration law,&quot; and deemed it &quot;well
established that certain constitutional protections available to persons
inside the United States are not available to aliens [legally treated as
being] outside of our geographic borders.&quot; 533 U.S. at 693. Therefore,
due process analysis &quot;changes&quot; when an alien enters the United
States, &quot;for the Due Process Clause applies to all 'persons' within
the United States.&quot; Ibid. The Sixth Circuit's disregard for those fundamental
principles has implications that reach far beyond the detention issue in
this case, and independently warrants review by this Court.8</P>

<P>APRIL 2003</P>

<P>1 On March 1, 2003, functions of several border and security agencies,
including certain functions of the former Immigration and Naturalization
Service (which respondent Carballo named as a respondent in his habeas corpus
petition), were transferred to the Department of Homeland Security and assigned
to its Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. See Homeland Security
Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-296, &sect; 441(2), 116 Stat. 2192 (codified
at 6 U.S.C. 251(2)).</P>

<P>2 Before IIRIRA, aliens subject to removal from the United States were
divided into two statutory categories. Aliens seeking admission and entry
into the United States were &quot;excludable.&quot; See Landon v. Plasencia,
459 U.S. 21, 25 (1982); 8 U.S.C. 1182 (1994). Aliens who had gained lawful
admission to the United States or entered without permission were deportable.
See 8 U.S.C. 1251 (1994). IIRIRA replaced the category of &quot;excludable&quot;
aliens with the new and broader category of &quot;inadmissible&quot; aliens,
consisting of aliens who are not eligible for admission into the United
States. See 8 U.S.C. 1182. Under IIRIRA, an alien who enters the United
States illegally has not been &quot;admitted,&quot; and is inadmissible.
8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(6)(A). Accordingly, the new category of &quot;inadmissible&quot;
aliens includes both aliens who have not entered the country (formerly known
as &quot;excludable&quot; aliens) and aliens who entered without permission
and formerly were deemed to be &quot;deportable.&quot; In Section 304(a)
of IIRIRA, 110 Stat. 3009-587 to 3009-597, Congress instituted a new form
of proceeding, known as &quot;removal,&quot; that applies to inadmissible
aliens as well as deportable aliens. See 8 U.S.C. 1229, 1229a.</P>

<P>3 The en banc court correctly determined that it had jurisdiction to
consider respondents' habeas corpus petitions despite statutory limitations
on review of administrative actions taken under the immigration laws. See
App., infra, 10a (citing INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289, 298-314 (2001), and
Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 688).</P>

<P>4 The government's position, argued below, is that respondents' detention
is affirmatively authorized by, inter alia, 8 U.S.C. 1226(e) (1994), and
that current Section 1231(a)(6) does not apply to respondents. The court
of appeals rejected that argument, App., infra, 23a-28a, and this petition
does not seek further review of that issue. However, as explained below,
Section 1231(a)(6) does not impose a limit on the detention of aliens who
were stopped at the border and are detained under that section, and it does
not limit the independent authority of the Bureau of Immigration and Customs
Enforcement under 8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(5)(A) to decide, in its discretion, whether
to grant parole to (or revoke the parole of) an alien who has been stopped
at the border. See pp. 21-26, infra.</P>

<P>5 Unlike these consolidated cases, the Ninth Circuit's decision in Lin
Guo Xi and the Fifth Circuit's decision in Rios both involved detention
of aliens who were placed in removal proceedings under IIRIRA, and therefore
were &quot;inadmissible,&quot; in IIRIRA's terminology, rather than &quot;excludable.&quot;
See Lin Guo Xi, 298 F.3d at 834; Rios, 2003 WL 734159, at *1 (noting that
Rios was taken into INS custody in 1998); see also note 2, supra. That difference
does not lessen the conflict among the circuits. The Sixth Circuit in this
case specifically found Zadvydas's interpretation of Section 1231(a)(6)
applicable to &quot;aliens who are removable on grounds of inadmissibility,&quot;
App., infra, 31a, 32a, 35a, 36a, and &quot;agree[d] with&quot; the Ninth
Circuit that Zadvydas's interpretation of Section 1231(a)(6) is &quot;unqualified,&quot;
id. at 33a (quoting Lin Guo Xi, 289 F.3d at 836). For its part, the Fifth
Circuit in Rios used the term &quot;excludable alien&quot; synonymously
with &quot;inadmissible alien,&quot; see 2003 WL 734159, at *1, and viewed
Zadvydas as being limited to the detention of deportable aliens, ibid. Therefore,
the circuits are in direct disagreement about whether Zadvydas's interpretation
of Section 1231(a)(6) applies to aliens who have been stopped at the border
and denied admission to the United States.</P>

<P>6 Aliens stopped at the border who have not been admitted to the United
States are deemed for purposes of the immigration laws to be applicants
for admission to the United States-even if they are physically present in
the United States, and without regard to whether a removal order has been
entered. 8 U.S.C. 1225(a)(1).</P>

<P>7 It is no obstacle to certiorari review of this issue that the Sixth
Circuit's constitutional analysis of respondents' detention was an alternative
ground for its holding. See, e.g., Woods v. Interstate Realty Co., 337 U.S.
535, 537 (1949); United States v. Title Ins. &amp; Trust Co., 265 U.S. 472,
486 (1924).</P>

<P>8 The government argued below that respondent Rosales-Garcia's habeas
petition became moot when he was released on immigration parole. If respondent
Carballo successfully completes the scheduled nine-month halfway-house treatment
program in which he was placed in December 2002, see App., infra, 8a, then
both of the consolidated cases might be moot under the position taken by
the government below. The court of apeals, however, determined that release
on parole under conditions does not moot an excludable Mariel Cuban's challenge
to his detention. See id. at 11a-17a. Furthermore, the lower courts would
benefit from this Court's consideration of the mootness issue if it is necessary
to address the issue in this case. Compare ibid. (parole does not moot habeas
challenge) with Picrin-Peron v. Rison, 930 F.2d 773, 776 (9th Cir. 1991)
(parole of excludable Cuban moots habeas challenge to detention), and Riley
v. INS, 310 F.3d 1253, 1256-1257 (10th Cir. 2002) (supervised release of
INS detainee moots habeas claim in absence of evidence showing applicability
of &quot;voluntary cessation&quot; exception to mootness). The court of
appeals' erroneous decision on the merits in this case is sufficiently important
that its vacatur under United States v. Munsingwear, Inc., 340 U.S. 36,
39-40 (1950), if there were a future determination of mootness, would have
significant benefit for the proper enforcement of the immigration laws.
For those reasons, the possibility that a mootness issue may arise during
the pendency of this Court's review does not counsel against granting the
petition for a writ of certiorari.</P>

<P>OPINION</P>

<P>KAREN NELSON MOORE, Circuit Judge.</P>

<P>Petitioners Mario Rosales-Garcia and Reynero Arteaga Carballo appeal
the denials of their petitions for the writ of habeas corpus in the district
courts. Both Petitioners, Cuban nationals who have been ordered removed
from the United States, are currently in the indefinite and potentially
permanent custody of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (&quot;INS&quot;)
because Cuba refuses to allow them to return. In its recent decision in
Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 682 (2001), the Supreme Court held that
the provision of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility
Act of 1996 (&quot;IIRIRA&quot;) that authorizes the post-removal-period
detention of removed aliens must be construed to contain an &quot;implicit
'reasonable time' limitation&quot; because the indefinite detention of aliens
who are removable on grounds of deportability &quot;would raise serious
constitutional concerns.&quot;</P>

<P>We first conclude that Rosales's and Carballo's detention by the INS
is governed by IIRIRA. We then conclude that although Rosales and Carballo
are removable on grounds of inadmissibility, as opposed to deportability,
the Supreme Court's limiting construction of IIRIRA's post-removal-detention
provision applies to their detention. Finally, we conclude that even if
the Supreme Court's construction of IIRIRA does not apply to Rosales and
Carballo, their indefinite detention independently raises constitutional
concerns, and we construe IIRIRA's post-removal-period detention provision
as it applies to Rosales and Carballo to contain an implicit reasonable-time
limitation. Because there is no significant likelihood of the petitioners'
removal in the reasonably foreseeable future, the continued detention of
the petitioners by the INS is not authorized by the applicable statute,
and we REVERSE the district courts' denials of their habeas petitions and
REMAND for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</P>

<P>I. BACKGROUND</P>

<P>Petitioners-Appellants Mario Rosales-Garcia (&quot;Rosales&quot;) and
Reynero Arteaga Carballo (&quot;Carballo&quot;) arrived in this country
as part of the Mariel boatlift in 1980, during which over 120,000 Cubans
crossed by boat from the Mariel harbor in Cuba to the United States. Rosales
and Carballo, like most of the Mariel Cubans, arrived in this country without
documentation permitting them legal entry; therefore, because they were
not authorized to enter the country and because immigration officials stopped
them at the border, they were deemed &quot;excludable&quot; under the immigration
law in effect at the time.1 Although excludable aliens have not &quot;entered&quot;
the country for the purposes of immigration law, Rosales and Carballo were
permitted physical entry into the United States pursuant to the Attorney
General's authority under 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1182(d)(5)(A) (1982) to grant
immigration parole.2 As of 1986, this parole has been governed by regulations
specifically promulgated by the INS for Mariel Cubans. 8 C.F.R. &sect; 212.12
(2002) (the &quot;Cuban Review Plan&quot;).</P>

<P>Following their independent criminal convictions, the Attorney General,
acting through the INS, revoked Rosales's and Carballo's parole and initiated
exclusion proceedings against them. Both petitioners were excluded and,
pursuant to the immigration law in effect at the time, they should have
been immediately deported. Cuba, however, has refused to repatriate most
of the Mariel Cubans whom the United States has excluded, and the U.S. government
does not contend in this appeal that a repatriation by Cuba of either Rosales
or Carballo is reasonably foreseeable.3 Because Cuba refused to accept the
deportation of either Rosales or Carballo, the INS has detained them in
prisons in the United States.</P>

<P>A. Rosales</P>

<P>Rosales was twenty-three when he arrived in the United States, and he
was soon thereafter paroled into the custody of his aunt. Beginning in 1980,
Rosales was arrested for a number of offenses, including aggravated battery,
possession of marijuana, burglary, and loitering. Rosales was convicted
of the following offenses: possession of marijuana and resisting arrest
in October 1981; grand theft in September 1981, for which he received two
years of probation in March 1983; burglary and grand larceny in October
1983, for which he received two six-month sentences, to be served consecutively;
escape from a penal institution in February 1984, for which he received
a 366-day sentence; and one count of conspiracy to possess with the intent
to distribute cocaine in March 1993, for which he received a sixty-three
month federal prison sentence and five years of supervised release.</P>

<P>On July 10, 1986, Rosales's immigration parole was revoked by the INS
on the basis of the escape and grand larceny convictions, pursuant to INS
authority under 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1182(d)(5)(A) (1982) and 8 C.F.R. &sect;
212.5(d)(2) (1986). In a separate proceeding before an immigration judge,
Rosales was denied asylum and ordered excluded on June 26, 1987, pursuant
to 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1182(a)(20) (1982), for improper documentation. Rosales
was in INS detention between July 1986 and May 1988, when he was again released
on parole. After he pleaded guilty to the cocaine conspiracy charge in 1993,
the INS revoked Rosales's parole, this time pursuant to the Cuban Review
Plan. When Rosales was released from federal prison in May 1997, the INS
detained him, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1226(e) (1994). Rosales remained
in INS detention for four years, during which time he was denied parole
twice, in November 1997 and March 1999, under the Cuban Review Plan. In
April 2001, Rosales was granted parole and released into a halfway house
program. Rosales completed the program in May 2001, and he was subsequently
released into the community under conditions of supervision.</P>

<P>Rosales filed his pro se habeas petition in the United States District
Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky on July 9, 1998. In the petition,
he alleged that his &quot;continued incarceration is illegal, it violates
Due Process, statu[t]es, and case law. . . .&quot; Rosales Joint Appendix
(&quot;Rosales J.A.&quot;) at 9. The district court initially denied Rosales's
habeas petition sua sponte in October of 1998; however, Rosales filed a
motion to amend, and the district court vacated its initial denial. On May
3, 1999, the district court denied with prejudice Rosales's amended habeas
petition. The court concluded that under the IIRIRA, 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1231(a)(6)
(Supp.V. 1999), the Attorney General was authorized to detain Rosales indefinitely,
and the court further concluded that such detention did not violate Rosales's
constitutional substantive or procedural due process rights. In regard to
Rosales's substantive due process claim, the court held that Rosales &quot;ha[d]
no fundamental right to be free to roam the United States.&quot; Rosales
J.A. at 91. With respect to Rosales's procedural due process claim, the
court held that &quot;[w]hatever the procedure authorized by Congress is,
it is due process as far as an alien denied entry is concerned.&quot; Rosales
J.A. at 91 (quoting United States ex rel. Knauff v. Shaughnessy, 338 U.S.
537, 544 (1950)).</P>

<P>On August 4, 2000, a panel of this court heard the case on appeal, and
on January 31, 2001, the panel reversed the district court's denial of Rosales's
petition. Following the Supreme Court's decision in Zadvydas v. Davis, 533
U.S. 678 (2001), the government petitioned the Court for certiorari, asking
that the panel's decision be vacated and remanded in light of Zadvydas.
On December 10, 2001, the Supreme Court granted the government's request.
Thomas v. Rosales-Garcia, 122 S.Ct. 662 (2001). Following our sua sponte
decision to hear Carballo v. Luttrell en banc, Rosales requested that his
case be heard en banc together with Carballo; we granted his request.</P>

<P>B. Carballo</P>

<P>Carballo was twenty-five when he arrived in the United States, and he
too was soon thereafter released on parole. By 1983, Carballo had been arrested
sixteen times, for offenses including aggravated assault, burglary, grand
larceny, battery, carrying a concealed weapon and an unlicensed firearm,
trespassing, and possession of marijuana.4 In April 1983, Carballo was convicted
of attempted first-degree murder, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon,
and robbery, for which he received a sentence of eight years for the murder,
eight years for the robbery, and five years for the aggravated assault.
During his incarceration, the INS initiated exclusion proceedings, and in
September 1994, an immigration judge ordered Carballo excluded, pursuant
to 8 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) (crimes of moral turpitude),
(a)(2)(B) (multiple criminal convictions), and (a)(7)(A)(i)(I) (improper
documentation) (1994). Upon the completion of his sentence, in June of 1988,
Carballo was taken into custody by the INS.5 He has been detained since
then, although his status has been reviewed annually, pursuant to the Cuban
Review Plan. While this case was pending, on December 17, 2002, Carballo
was placed by the INS in a nine-month residential substance-abuse program
at the Union Rescue Mission in Los Angeles.</P>

<P>On September 6, 1990, Carballo filed a pro se habeas petition in the
United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas. Carballo
claimed that the Attorney General did not have the authority to detain him
beyond a reasonable time to effect his exclusion and that his continued
detention violated his constitutional substantive and procedural due process
rights. A magistrate judge recommended that Carballo's petition be denied,
and on November 26, 1991, the district court denied Carballo's petition.
The district court concluded that the Attorney General had implied statutory
authority to detain Carballo under 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1227(a) (1988). Addressing
Carballo's constitutional claims, the court held that because Carballo's
detention did not constitute punishment, it did not violate substantive
due process. The court further held that Carballo was entitled to only as
much procedural due process as Congress granted him. Carballo did not appeal
this denial.</P>

<P>On December 11, 1998, Carballo filed a successive habeas petition in
the United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee.
The district court denied Carballo's successive petition on May 10, 1999.
After finding that Carballo raised the same claims in his successive habeas
petition as he had raised in his original habeas petition, the court stated
that the &quot;law of the case doctrine prevents this court from reconsidering
petitioner's entirely repetitive claim.&quot; Carballo Joint Appendix (&quot;Carballo
J.A.&quot;) at 20. Carballo appealed this denial, and a panel of this court
heard the case on March 9, 2001. On October 11, 2001, the panel affirmed
the decision of the district court. On November 3, 2001, we sua sponte granted
Carballo a rehearing en banc, vacating the decision of the panel. Carballo
requested that his case be heard together with Rosales's, and we granted
his request.</P>

<P>II. ANALYSIS</P>

<P>A. Jurisdiction</P>

<P>1. Availability of the Writ of Habeas Corpus</P>

<P>Both Rosales and Carballo filed petitions for habeas corpus relief in
the district court under 28 U.S.C.</P>

<P>&sect; 2241. Recently in INS v. St. Cyr, the Supreme Court definitively
concluded that aliens detained by the INS can petition for writs of habeas
corpus under 28 U.S.C. &sect; 2241-whether they are detained pursuant to
the pre-1996 statutory regime, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty
Act of 1996 (&quot;AEDPA&quot;), or IIRIRA. INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289,
298-314 (2001). The Court held that &quot;[a]t its historical core, the
writ of habeas corpus has served as a means of reviewing the legality of
executive detention, and it is in that context that its protections have
been strongest.&quot; Id. at 301. &quot;[U]nder the pre-1996 statutory scheme-and
consistent with its common-law antecedents-it is clear that St. Cyr could
have brought his challenge to the Board of Immigration Appeals' legal determination
in a habeas corpus petition under 28 U.S.C. &sect; 2241.&quot; Id. at 308.
Although the government argued that certain provisions of AEDPA and IIRIRA
barred habeas petitions under those statutes, the Court determined that
habeas jurisdiction under &sect; 2241 was not repealed by AEDPA or IIRIRA.
Id. at 314; see also Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 688 (&quot;&sect; 2241 habeas
corpus proceedings remain available as a forum for statutory and constitutional
challenges to post- removal-period detention.&quot;). Therefore, the district
courts properly had jurisdiction over Rosales's and Carballo's habeas petitions,
and we have jurisdiction to review the district courts' denials of those
petitions.</P>

<P>2. Mootness-Rosales</P>

<P>Rosales was released from INS detention and paroled into the United States
in May of 2001; the government contends that Rosales's appeal is therefore
moot. &quot;Under Article III of the Constitution, our jurisdiction extends
only to actual cases and contro-</P>

<P>versies. We have no power to adjudicate disputes which</P>

<P>are moot.&quot; McPherson v. Mich. High Sch. Athletic Ass'n, Inc., 119
F.3d 453, 458 (6th Cir. 1997) (quotation omitted). Even if a case was not
moot in the district court, if it becomes moot on appeal, we must dismiss
the case unless &quot;the relief sought would, if granted, make a difference
to the legal interests of the parties.&quot; Id. Because Rosales is still
&quot;in custody&quot; for the purposes of 28 U.S.C. &sect; 2241 and because
the relief he seeks, if granted, would make a difference to his legal interests,
we conclude that his appeal is not moot.</P>

<P>The government argues that &quot;if a prisoner is released from custody
during the pendency of his case, his habeas petition becomes moot.&quot;
Gov't Supp. Br. re Rosales at 19. In Jones v. Cunningham, 371 U.S. 236 (1963),
however, the Supreme Court held that a paroled prisoner was in the custody
of his state parole board for the purposes of 28 U.S.C. &sect; 2241. &quot;While
petitioner's parole releases him from immediate physical imprisonment, it
imposes conditions which significantly confine and restrain his freedom;
this is enough to keep him</P>

<P>in the 'custody' of the members of the Virginia</P>

<P>Parole Board within the meaning of the habeas corpus</P>

<P>statute . . . .&quot; Jones, 371 U.S. at 243; see also DePompei v. Ohio
Adult Parole Auth., 999 F.2d 138, 140 (6th Cir. 1993). Although Rosales's
parole was not based on a criminal conviction, it imposes similarly restrictive
conditions. See Rosales Supp. J.A. at 4-5 (Conditions of Parole). Therefore,
we conclude that even though he has been paroled into the United States,
Rosales is still in the custody of the INS for the purposes of his habeas
petition.6</P>

<P>Our inquiry into whether Rosales's claim is moot cannot end, however,
with a determination of custody. In Spencer v. Kemna, the Supreme Court
determined that a petitioner's release did not by itself moot his habeas
petition, but the Court then explained that &quot;[t]he more substantial
question . . . is whether petitioner's subsequent release caused the petition
to be moot because it no longer presented a case or controversy under Article
III, &sect; 2, of the Constitution.&quot; Spencer v. Kemna, 523 U.S. 1,
7 (1998). Rosales petitioned the district court for habeas relief, alleging
that his continued detention by the INS was impermissible on both statutory
and constitutional grounds. We thus must ask whether Rosales's claim is
moot because he is no longer being detained by the INS. &quot;The parties
must continue to have a personal stake in the outcome of the lawsuit. This
means that, throughout the litigation, the plaintiff must have suffered,
or be threatened with, an actual injury traceable to the defendant and likely
to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.&quot; Id. (quotations
and citations omitted).</P>

<P>Although Rosales is not currently being detained, his immigration parole
can be revoked by the INS at any time for almost any reason.7 Unlike parole
granted following incarceration for a criminal conviction, Rosales need
not do anything for the INS to revoke his parole; for instance, the INS
can revoke Rosales's parole if it deems such revocation to be &quot;in the
public interest.&quot; See 8 C.F.R. &sect; 212.12(h) (2002). Thus, Rosales's
&quot;release&quot; into the United States does not constitute a termination
of detention; it simply constitutes a reprieve from detention.8 Under these
circumstances, we believe that Rosales is threatened with an actual injury
traceable to the defendant and likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial
decision. We therefore conclude that Rosales's appeal is not moot.</P>

<P>Two other strands of the Supreme Court's mootness jurisprudence support
this conclusion. First, the Supreme Court has held that &quot;[i]t is well
settled that 'a defendant's voluntary cessation of a challenged practice
does not deprive a federal court of its power to determine the legality
of the practice.' . . . '[I]f it did, the courts would be compelled to leave
[t]he defendant</P>

<P>. . . free to return to his old ways.'&quot; Friends of the Earth, Inc.
v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 189 (2000) (quoting
City of Mesquite v. Aladdin's Castle, Inc., 455 U.S. 283, 289 &amp; n. 10
(1982)). Second, the Court has long recognized an exception to the mootness
doctrine for cases that are &quot;capable of repetition, yet evading review.&quot;
This exception applies where &quot;(1) the challenged action [is] in its
duration too short to be fully litigated prior to cessation or expiration,
and (2) there [is] a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party
[will] be subject to the same action again.&quot; Spencer, 523 U.S. at 17
(quotation omitted); see also Suster v. Marshall, 149 F.3d 523, 527 (6th
Cir. 1998), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1114 (1999).</P>

<P>To determine whether a case has been mooted by the defendant's voluntary
conduct, the Supreme Court has articulated the following standard: &quot;A
case might become moot if subsequent events made it absolutely clear that
the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.&quot;
Friends of the</P>

<P>Earth, 528 U.S. at 189. As discussed above, the INS can revoke Rosales's
parole at any time. We have noted that &quot;cessation of the allegedly
illegal conduct by government officials has been treated with more solicitude
by the courts than similar action by private parties.&quot; Mosley v. Hairston,
920 F.2d 409, 415 (6th Cir. 1990) (quoting 13A Charles Alan Wright, Arthur
R. Miller &amp; Edward H. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure &sect;
3533.7 (2d ed.1984)). The Ninth Circuit has even held that a Mariel Cuban's
parole did moot his habeas petition because, on the basis of government
declarations, the court concluded that &quot;the alleged wrong will not
recur.&quot; Picrin-Peron v. Rison, 930 F.2d 773, 776 (9th Cir. 1991). In
Picrin-Peron, the government stated in its dismissal motion that &quot;[a]bsent
Picrin's reinvolvement with the criminal justice system, a change in the
Cuban government enabling him to return to Cuba, or the willingness of a
third country to accept him, he will be paroled for another year,&quot;
and an INS official reiterated the statement in a declaration made under
oath. Id. The government in Rosales's case, however, has made no such promise,
nor has the government made it &quot;absolutely clear&quot; in any other
way that potentially indefinite detention of Rosales by the INS cannot reasonably
be expected to recur.</P>

<P>We also believe that the indefinite detention of Rosales by the INS is
a case &quot;capable of repetition,</P>

<P>yet evading review.&quot; Because the INS can revoke Rosales's parole
at any time and has in fact revoked Rosales's parole twice in the past fifteen
years, there is a reasonable expectation that Rosales will again be subject
to indefinite INS detention.9 Moreover, because the INS can grant Rosales
parole at any time, such detention can always evade review. The government
argues that &quot;there is no basis for concluding that when a Mariel Cuban's
parole is revoked, the alien will always be rereleased in a time that is
so short that the legality of his detention will evade review.&quot; Gov't
Supp. Br. re Rosales at 22-23. It is true that the Cuban Review Plan requires
the INS to follow certain procedures before releasing a Mariel Cuban into
the United States. However, the INS granted Rosales parole in the two years
between the denial of his habeas petition by the district court and our
review, and we have every reason to believe both that the INS could again
accomplish a release in the same amount of time and that another habeas
petition filed by Rosales would take at least as long as the instant case
in arriving in this court. See Honig v. Doe, 484 U.S. 305, 320-22 (1988).10</P>

<P>3. Successive Habeas Petition-Carballo</P>

<P>The government argues on appeal that &quot;Carballo's petition is an
abuse of the writ [of habeas corpus] because it is a second, successive
petition that raises the same claims that were denied on the merits in his
first petition, and he cannot point to any exception to overcome the bar
on successive petitions.&quot; Gov't Supp. Br. re Carballo at 57.11 &quot;A
'successive petition' raises grounds identical to those raised and rejected
on the merits on a prior petition.&quot; Schlup v. Delo, 513 U.S. 298, 318
n. 34 (1995) (quoting Kuhlmann v. Wilson, 477 U.S. 436, 444 n. 6 (1986)).12
Carballo indeed presented the same claims for relief in the petition that
gave rise to this appeal as he presented in his habeas petition in the United
States District Court for the Northern District of Texas in 1990. However,
applying the traditional successive-petition doctrine, we conclude that
we should reach the merits of Carballo's petition because there has been
an intervening change in the law.</P>

<P>Carballo petitioned the district court for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant
to 28 U.S.C. &sect; 2241. As discussed above, the Supreme Court recently
reiterated that &sect; 2241 is the appropriate means for an alien to challenge
his detention by the INS. INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. at 298-314.13 Under AEDPA,
there are strict &quot;gatekeeping&quot; provisions restricting the ability
of federal courts to hear successive habeas petitions. See 28 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;
2244(a) &amp; (b) (2000); Felker v. Turpin, 518 U.S. 651, 662-63 (1996).
By their own terms, however, these provisions do not apply to petitioners
like Carballo who are not in custody pursuant to a conviction in state or
federal court. See Barapind v. Reno, 225 F.3d 1100, 1111 (9th Cir. 2000).
In Barapind, the Ninth Circuit explained that &quot;&sect; 2244(a) cannot
apply to a &sect; 2241 petition filed by an INS detainee such as Barapind
because &sect; 2244(a) bars successive petitions seeking review of the propriety
of a detention 'pursuant to a judgment of a court of the United States.'&quot;
Id. (emphasis in original). &quot;Because &sect; 2244(b) makes no reference
to habeas petitions filed under &sect; 2241, but rather, applies only to
petitions filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &sect; 2254, the prior-appellate-review
provisions of</P>

<P>&sect; 2244(b) do not apply to habeas petitions filed under</P>

<P>&sect; 2241.&quot; Id.; see also Valona v. United States, 138 F.3d 693,
694 (7th Cir. 1998).14</P>

<P>Therefore, we apply the pre-AEDPA law governing successive habeas petitions
to determine whether we should hear Carballo's petition. The Supreme Court
held in Sanders v. United States that, &quot;[c]ontrolling weight may be
given to denial of a prior application for federal habeas corpus or &sect;
2255 relief only if (1) the same ground presented in the subsequent application
was determined adversely to the applicant on the prior application, (2)
the prior determination was on the merits, and (3) the ends of justice would
not be served by reaching the merits of the subsequent application.&quot;
Sanders v. United States, 373 U.S. 1, 15 (1963) (footnote omitted); see
also Lonberger v. Marshall, 808 F.2d 1169, 1173 (6th Cir.), cert. denied,
481 U.S. 1055 (1987).15</P>

<P>Because Carballo made the same claims in the Northern District of Texas
as he made in the district court below, and because the Northern District
of Texas denied these claims on the merits, the first two prongs of the
Sanders test for successive habeas petitions clearly apply. In regard to
the third prong, the Sanders Court stated that &quot;[e]ven if the same
ground was rejected on the merits on a prior application, it is open to
the applicant to show that the ends of justice would be served by permitting
the redetermination of the ground.&quot; Sanders, 373 U.S. at 16. &quot;If
purely legal questions are involved, the applicant may be entitled to a
new hearing upon showing an intervening change in the law.&quot; Id. at
17; see also Lonberger, 808 F.2d at 1174. Applying Sanders, Carballo argues
that IIRIRA and the Supreme Court's decision in Zadvydas constitute an intervening
change in the law and thus that the ends of justice would be served by considering
the claims in his successive habeas petition. See Carballo's Supp. Br. at
13-14. The government, however, also applying Sanders, contends that Zadvydas
does not constitute a change in the law and that IIRIRA does not apply to
Carballo. See Gov't Supp. Br. re Carballo at 57-62.</P>

<P>In our analysis below, we conclude that IIRIRA is the appropriate statute
to apply to Rosales and Carballo. We also agree with Carballo that IIRIRA,
and the Supreme Court's interpretation of its post- removal-period detention
provision in Zadvydas, constitute an intervening change in the law sufficient
to warrant our review of his petition. Although the post-removal-period
detention provision of IIRIRA is in itself not substantially different from
the detention provision in pre-IIRIRA law, the Supreme Court's construction
of IIRIRA's post-removal-period detention provision in Zadvydas is different
from the construction of the detention provision in pre-IIRIRA law that
prevailed in most circuits at the time Carballo filed his original habeas
petition. Therefore, Carballo is able in this habeas petition to raise legal
arguments that he was unable to raise in his habeas petition in the Northern
District of Texas. See Collins v. Zant, 892 F.2d 1502, 1505 (11th Cir.),
cert. denied, 498 U.S. 881 (1990) (&quot;In analyzing 'the ends of justice,'
a court may consider new arguments (based, for example, on intervening changes
in the law) that a petitioner raises in support of an old claim.&quot;)
(emphasis in original). Because, moreover, such arguments go to the constitutionality
of and statutory authorization for Carballo's indefinite detention, it serves
the ends of justice for us to reach the merits of Carballo's successive
habeas petition.16</P>

<P>B. Standard of Review</P>

<P>We review de novo a district court's denial of a petition for the writ
of habeas corpus filed under 28 U.S.C. &sect; 2241. Asad v. Reno, 242 F.3d
702, 704 (6th Cir. 2001).</P>

<P>C. Applicable Statute</P>

<P>There are two versions of the Immigration and Nationality Act (&quot;INA&quot;),
codified as amended at 8 U.S.C.</P>

<P>&sect; 1101 et seq., that could potentially apply to the petitioners
in the present appeals: (1) the version of the INA in effect between 1990
and 199517; and (2) the INA as amended by the Illegal Immigration Reform
and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (&quot;IIRIRA&quot;).18 Rosales
and Carballo argue that we should apply IIRIRA in assessing whether their
detention by the INS is a violation of statutory and constitutional law;
the government contends that we should instead apply the law in effect between
1990 and 1995.19</P>

<P>According to the petitioners, we should apply IIRIRA because, in Zadvydas,
the Supreme Court applied IIRIRA &quot;to a petitioner who had been placed
in deportation proceedings and ordered deported prior to the statute's April
1, 1997 effective date.&quot; Rosales's Supp. Br. at 9 (emphasis in original).
The Supreme Court in Zadvydas did apply IIRIRA to such a petitioner, Zadvydas,
but it did not explain its reason for so doing. See Zadvydas, 533 U .S.
at 682. Moreover, the government and the petitioner in Zadvydas agreed on
what statute to apply. See Zadvydas v. Underdown, 185 F.3d 279, 286-87 (5th
Cir. 1999), vacated and remanded sub nom. Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678
(2001). According to the government, &sect; 309(c)(1) of IIRIRA precludes
us from applying IIRIRA to an alien excluded prior to the statute's effective
date. Section 309(c)(1), entitled &quot;General rule that new rules do not
apply,&quot; provides that:</P>

<P>Subject to the succeeding provisions of this subsection, in the case
of an alien who is in exclusion or deportation proceedings before the title
III-A effective date [April 1, 1997]-(A) the amendments made by this subtitle
shall not apply, and (B) the proceedings (including judicial review thereof)
shall continue to be conducted without regard to such amendments.</P>

<P>8 U.S.C. &sect; 1101 (2000), note regarding &quot;Effective Dates&quot;
(reprinting IIRIRA &sect; 309(c)(1)). Inasmuch as the Supreme Court in Zadvydas
did not discuss the application of IIRIRA to Zadvydas, we cannot simply
assume that such application is appropriate for all aliens deported or excluded
before April 1, 1997. We are persuaded for other reasons, however, that
IIRIRA is the appropriate statute to assess in our review of the merits
of Rosales's and Carballo's habeas petitions.</P>

<P>The government contends that IIRIRA does not apply to Rosales and Carballo
because, pursuant to</P>

<P>&sect; 309(c), IIRIRA does not apply to aliens who were in exclusion
or deportation proceedings prior to April 1, 1997. It is not clear from
the government's brief whether it believes this interpretation to be of
the statute's retroactivity (i.e., that IIRIRA does not apply retroactively
to aliens ordered deported or excluded prior to its effective date) or of
the statute's general applicability (i.e., that IIRIRA generally does not
apply to aliens ordered deported or excluded prior to its effective date).
To the extent that the argument is one of IIRIRA's retroactivity, we do
not believe that retroactivity is at issue in these appeals. In Alvarez-
Mendez v. Stock, the Ninth Circuit considered the legality of an excludable
alien's detention under the statute in effect at the time of the decision.
Alvarez-Mendez v. Stock, 941 F.2d 956, 960 (9th Cir. 1991), cert. denied,
506 U.S. 842 (1992). &quot;Although the new section 1226(e) does not retroactively
authorize any of the Attorney General's acts accomplished prior to the amendment,
we are concerned here only with the legality of Alvarez-Mendez's present
detention. Because this case involves a petition for the writ of habeas
corpus, and not a claim for damages for illegal detention, the only issue
before us is whether Alvarez-Mendez's detention is illegal today.&quot;
Id. (emphasis added). We agree with this reasoning. Rosales and Carballo
are not challenging the legality of their original detention-they are challenging
the INS's authority to detain them now. Therefore, whether IIRIRA retroactively
authorizes Rosales's and Carballo's detention is irrelevant; we need only
assess whether IIRIRA currently authorizes their detention.20</P>

<P>To the extent that the government's argument is one of IIRIRA's general
applicability, the Supreme Court has stated that &quot;[s]ection 309(c)(1)
is best read as merely setting out the procedural rules to be applied to
removal proceedings pending on the effective date of the statute.&quot;
St. Cyr, 533 U.S. at 318 (emphasis in original). The St. Cyr Court also
noted that &quot;the Conference Report expressly explained, '[Section 309(c)]
provides for the transition to new procedures in the case of an alien already
in exclusion or deportation proceedings on the effective date.'&quot; Id.
(quoting H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 104-828, p. 222 (1996)) (emphasis in original).
In other words, according to the Supreme Court, &sect; 309(c) provides only
that IIRIRA does not apply to removal proceedings that were pending on April
1, 1997. See also Zadvydas, 185 F.3d at 286-87 &amp; n. 7 (&quot;[T]he natural
reading of the clause would thus seem to be that it applies only to proceedings
that are pending as of the effective date.&quot;); cf. Carrera-Valdez v.
Perryman, 211 F.3d 1046, 1048 (7th Cir. 2000) (applying pre-IIRIRA law to
an alien &quot;subject to an order of exclusion&quot; on April 1, 1997);
Duy Dac Ho, 204 F.3d at 1050 (same).21</P>

<P>As neither Carballo's nor Rosales's exclusion proceeding was pending
on April 1, 1997, and as neither petitioner is challenging his exclusion
proceeding, we conclude that IIRIRA &sect; 309(c) does not limit the applicability
of IIRIRA to Rosales or Carballo.22 IIRIRA governs the current detention
of removed aliens beyond the removal period; therefore, we apply IIRIRA
in assessing the legality of Rosales's and Carballo's current detention
by the INS.</P>

<P>D. Statutory Authority to Detain Indefinitely</P>

<P>1. Statutory Construction in Zadvydas</P>

<P>Under IIRIRA, Rosales's and Carballo's detention by the INS is governed
by 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1231(a)(6) (2000), the post-removal-period detention
provision. Normally, after a final order of removal has been entered against
an alien, the government must remove the alien from the United States within
a 90-day statutory removal period, during which the alien is held in custody.</P>

<P>8 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 1231(a)(1)(A) (2000) (&quot;Except as otherwise
provided in the [sic] section, when an alien is ordered removed, the Attorney
General shall remove the alien from the United States within a period of
90 days (in this section referred to as the 'removal period').&quot;) &amp;
(2) (&quot;During the removal period, the Attorney General shall detain
the alien.&quot;); see also Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 682. 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1231(a)(6)
(2000) provides, however, that:</P>

<P>An alien ordered removed who is inadmissible under section 1182 of this
title, removable under section 1227(a)(1)(C), 1227(a)(2), or 1227(a)(4)
of this title or who has been determined by the Attorney General to be a
risk to the community or unlikely to comply with the order of removal, may
be detained beyond the removal period and, if released, shall be subject
to the terms of supervision in paragraph (3).</P>

<P>8 U.S.C. &sect; 1231(a)(6) (2000).23 In Zadvydas, the Supreme Court addressed
the detention of two aliens who had been removed on grounds of deportability.24
Concluding that &quot;[a] statute permitting indefinite detention of an
alien would raise a serious constitutional problem,&quot; the Zadvydas Court
read the provision to limit &quot;an alien's post-removal-period detention
to a period reasonably necessary to bring about that alien's removal from
the United States.&quot; Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 689. The Court then recognized
six months as a presumptively reasonable period of post-removal-period detention.
Id. at 699-702. Because we are assessing the same provision of IIRIRA that
the Supreme Court considered in Zadvydas, the petitioners ask us simply
to apply to them the reasonableness limitation the Supreme Court read into
the provision in Zadvydas. The government contends, however, that the Zadvydas
Court's construction of 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1231(a)(6) (2000) does not apply
to Rosales and Carballo because the detention of aliens who are removable
on grounds of inadmissibility does not raise the same constitutional concerns
as the detention of aliens who are removable on grounds of deportability.</P>

<P>On the basis of the plain language of the provision, we find it difficult
to believe that the Supreme Court in Zadvydas could interpret &sect; 1231(a)(6)
as containing a reasonableness limitation for aliens who are removable on
grounds of deportability but not for aliens who are removable on grounds
of inadmissibility. Section 1231(a)(6) itself does not draw any distinction
between the categories of removable aliens; nor would there be any statutory
reason to interpret &quot;detained beyond the removal period&quot; differently
for aliens who are removable on grounds of inadmissibility and aliens who
are removable on grounds of deportability. See Brown v. Gardner, 513 U.S.
115, 118 (1994) (discussing presumption that a statutory term retains the
same meaning throughout a statute and in particular throughout a provision).
The Ninth Circuit recently addressed this issue, and it concluded that the
Supreme Court's construction of &sect; 1231(a)(6) in Zadvydas applied to
an inadmissible, formerly excludable, alien. See Lin Guo Xi v. INS, 298
F.3d 832, 834 (9th Cir. 2002) (&quot;We are now presented with the question
of whether [8 U.S.C.</P>

<P>&sect; 1231(a)(6)] bears the same meaning for an individual deemed inadmissible
to the United States under 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1182. The answer is yes.&quot;).
The court in Lin Guo Xi explained that &quot;[s]ection 1231(a)(6) . . .
does not draw any distinction between individuals who are removable on grounds
of inadmissibility and those removable on grounds of deportability.&quot;
Id. at 835.25</P>

<P>We also do not believe that the Supreme Court intended to construe &sect;
1231(a)(6) differently for aliens who are removable on grounds of inadmissibility
and aliens who are removable on grounds of deportability. The government
focuses on the Zadvydas Court's statement at the outset of its opinion that
&quot;[w]e deal here with aliens who were admitted to the United States
but subsequently ordered removed. Aliens who have not yet gained initial
admission to this country would present a very different question.&quot;
Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 682. In addition, the government looks to the portion
of Zadvydas in which the Court distinguished its decision in Shaughnessy
v. United States ex rel. Mezei, 345 U.S. 206 (1953). See Zadvydas, 533 U.S.
at 693-95. The Court stated that &quot;[a]lthough Mezei, like the present
cases, involves indefinite detention, it differs from the present cases
in a critical respect. . . . [Mezei's] presence on Ellis Island did not
count as entry into the United States.&quot; Id. at 693. The Court then
further explained:</P>

<P>The distinction between an alien who has effected an entry into the United
States and one who</P>

<P>has never entered runs throughout immigration law. . . . It is well established
that certain constitutional protections available to persons inside the
United States are unavailable to aliens outside of our geographic borders.
. . . [O]nce an alien enters the country, the legal circumstance changes,
for the Due Process Clause applies to all 'persons' within the United States,
including aliens, whether their presence here is lawful, unlawful, temporary,
or permanent.</P>

<P>Id. According to the government, &quot;[i]t is unreasonable to assume
the Zadvydas Court went to such great lengths to distinguish the Government's
authority to detain inadmissible aliens from its authority to detain aliens
who have entered the country only to mandate that the courts treat both
groups of aliens identically under &sect; 1231(a)(6).&quot; Gov't Supp.
Br. re Rosales at</P>

<P>38-39.</P>

<P>We agree with the government that the Zadvydas Court addressed only the
constitutional concerns raised by the indefinite detention of aliens who
are removable on grounds of deportability, but we also agree with the Ninth
Circuit in Lin Guo Xi that the Supreme Court's holding in Zadvydas was &quot;unqualified.&quot;
Lin Guo Xi, 298 F.3d at 836. &quot;Although Zadvydas concerned the second
prong of the statute-relating to deportable aliens-the Court's ultimate
holding addresses the statute as a whole: 'we construe the statute to contain
an implicit &quot;reasonable time&quot; limitation, the application of which
is subject to federal court review.'&quot; Lin Guo Xi, 298 F.3d at 835 (quoting
Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 682). The Zadvydas Court also noted that the statute
&quot;applies to certain categories of aliens who have been ordered removed,
namely inadmissible aliens, criminal aliens, aliens who have violated their
nonimmigrant status conditions, and aliens removable for certain national
security or foreign relations reasons. . . .&quot; Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at
688. Furthermore, in stating that the statute does not permit indefinite
detention, the Court referred generally to aliens as opposed to aliens who
are removable on grounds of deportability: &quot;[i]n our view, the statute,
read in light of the Constitution's demands, limits an alien's post-removal-period
detention to a period reasonably necessary to bring about that alien's removal
from the United States.&quot; Id . at 689 (emphasis added).</P>

<P>As in Lin Guo Xi, the government in the instant cases &quot;has offered
no authority suggesting that a litigant may not take advantage of a statutory
interpretation that was guided by the principle of constitutional avoidance
when that litigant's case does not present the constitutional problem that
prompted the statutory interpretation.&quot; Lin Guo Xi, 298 F.3d at 839.
In a case addressing a remarkably similar issue of statutory construction,
the Third Circuit recently stated that &quot;[i]t simply cannot be that
the meaning will change depending on the background or pedigree of the petitioner.
Were we to so hold, we would render the meaning of any statute as changeable
as the currents of the sea, and potentially as cruel and capricious.&quot;
Chmakov v. Blackman, 266 F.3d 210, 215 (3rd Cir. 2001). We fully agree with
this reasoning.</P>

<P>In Chmakov, the court addressed the applicability of the Supreme Court's
construction of certain provisions of IIRIRA and AEDPA to individuals who
did not raise the same constitutional concerns as the individuals in the
case in which the Court construed the statute. The Supreme Court in St.
Cyr held that, notwithstanding certain provisions of IIRIRA and AEDPA, aliens
who had been ordered deported on the basis of criminal convictions could
petition the federal courts for habeas relief from their deportation decisions.
St. Cyr, 533 U.S. at 298-314. The Court in St. Cyr interpreted IIRIRA and
AEDPA not to preclude federal habeas jurisdiction both because such preclusion
raised serious constitutional concerns under the Suspension Clause and because
there was no clear and unambiguous statement of congressional intent to
preclude habeas. In Chmakov, the government argued that although the St.
Cyr Court had interpreted IIRIRA and AEDPA not to repeal federal habeas
jurisdiction over criminal deportees, the Court's interpretation of those
statutes did not apply to the Chmakovs because, as non-criminal deportees,
the Suspension Clause could not be a cause for constitutional concern. Chmakov,
266 F.3d at 215. The Third Circuit responded to this argument by first stating
that &quot;[t]hat argument borders on the nonsensical,&quot; and the court
then held that &quot;Congress has preserved the right to habeas review for
both criminal and non- criminal aliens .&quot; Id.</P>

<P>Finally, we note that [the] Zadvydas Court did not actually distinguish
between aliens who are removable on grounds of inadmissibility and aliens
who are removable on grounds of deportability in its analysis of the constitutional
concerns raised by the indefinite detention of aliens who are removable
on grounds of deportability. The Court only refers to &quot;admission&quot;
at the outset of the opinion; in its discussion of the constitutional concern
raised by the statute, the Court distinguishes between aliens who have &quot;entered&quot;
the United States and those who have not. Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 682, 692.
As we explained above, see supra note 1, &quot;admission&quot; is a defining
principle in IIRIRA, whereas &quot;entry&quot; was a defining principle
in pre- IIRIRA immigration law. In its briefs in the instant appeal, as
in Lin Guo Xi, the government implies that &quot;the central operating terms
of the two statutes are functionally the same-namely . . . that 'entry'
and 'admission' are interchangeable and that 'excludable' and inadmissible'
are interchangeable.&quot; Lin Guo Xi, 298 F.3d at 838. As we also explained
above in note 1, however, these terms are not interchangeable. See also
id. Admission is defined as &quot;the lawful entry of [an] alien into the
United States,&quot; 8 U.S .C. &sect; 1101(a)(13)(A) (2000) (emphasis added);
aliens who enter this country illegally and who were formerly classified
as &quot;deportable&quot; are now classified as &quot;inadmissible.&quot;
Therefore, to the extent that the Zadvydas Court distinguished between categories
of aliens in its analysis of the constitutional concerns raised by the statute,
it distinguished only between excludable and deportable aliens.26</P>

<P>We explained above that, on the basis of the plain language of the statute,
we do not believe that the Zadvydas Court could construe the statute differently
for aliens who are removable on grounds of inadmissibility and aliens who
are removable on grounds of deportability. It is even less conceivable,
therefore, that the Court construed the statute differently for excludable
and deportable aliens. In enacting IIRIRA, Congress not only abolished the
use of the term &quot;excludable,&quot; but it also abolished that category
of alien. &quot;The INA is no longer denominated in terms of 'entry' and
'exclusion.' IIRIRA replaced these terms with the broader concept of 'admission.'&quot;
Lin Guo Xi, 298 F.3d at 838; see also id. (&quot;We simply cannot ignore
that 'excludable' is no longer a term that has any statutory import under
the INA.&quot;). To accept the government's argument that the Zadvydas Court's
construction of &sect; 1231(a)(6) does not apply to Rosales and Carballo,
therefore, we would have to conclude that the Zadvydas Court interpreted
a statute currently in force to apply differently to a category of alien
that no longer exists in immigration law. Without explicit instruction by
the Court, we will not reach such a conclusion.</P>

<P>As the court in Lin Guo Xi concluded, &quot;[t]he clear text of the statute,
coupled with the Supreme Court's categorical interpretation, leaves us little
choice but to conclude that Zadvydas applies to inadmissible individuals
like Lin Guo Xi. The statute, on its face, makes no exceptions for inadmissible
aliens. The Supreme Court's unqualified holding provides that the statute
'does not permit indefinite detention.'&quot; Lin Guo Xi, 298 F.3d at 836
(quoting Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 689); see also Borrero v. Aljets, 178 F.Supp.2d
1034, 1042 (D.Minn. 2001) (&quot;[W]e can find no sound reason to interpret
and apply the statute one way for one category of aliens, but a different
way for others. We therefore must conclude that &sect; 1231(a)(6), as construed
in Zadvydas, does not authorize the INS to detain Petitioner[, an excludable
alien,] indefinitely.&quot;).27 We thus agree with the petitioners that
we should apply 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1231(a)(6) (2000) to them with the reasonableness
limitation that the Court read into that provision in Zadvydas. However,
because it is not completely clear from the Court's opinion in Zadvydas
how the Court intended its statutory construction to be applied, we also
explain why constitutional concerns would independently compel us to construe
IIRIRA's post-removal-period detention provision to contain a reasonableness
limitation for excludable aliens.</P>

<P>2. Constitutional Concern Raised with Regard to Excludable Aliens</P>

<P>a. Applicability of Fifth Amendment Due Process to Excludable Aliens</P>

<P>Describing the doctrine of constitutional avoidance, the Zadvydas Court
stated &quot;when an Act of Congress raises 'a serious doubt' as to its
constitutionality, 'this Court will first ascertain whether a construction
of the statute is fairly possible by which the question may be avoided.'&quot;
Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 689 (quoting Crowell v. Benson, 285 U.S. 22, 62 (1932)).
The Court then held that &quot;the statute, read in light of the Constitution's
demands, limits an alien's post-removal-period detention to a period reasonably
necessary to bring about that alien's removal from the United States. It
does not permit indefinite detention.&quot; Id. at 689. &quot;A statute
permitting indefinite detention of an alien would raise a serious constitutional
problem. The Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause forbids the Government
to depriv[e] any person . . . of liberty . . . without due process of law.&quot;
Id. at 690. The Court concluded that while indefinite civil detention may
be permissible in some few cases, an alien's status as removable is alone
insufficient to outweigh his constitutionally protected liberty interest.
Id. at 690-92.</P>

<P>Neither the Court's holding nor the Court's discussion of the due process
problems with indefinite detention distinguish between excludable and other
aliens. Following its conclusion that an alien's status as removable alone
does not outweigh his constitutionally protected liberty interest, however,
the Court noted: &quot;The Government argues that, from a constitutional
perspective, alien status itself can justify indefinite detention, and points
to Shaughnessy v. United States ex rel. Mezei, 345 U.S. 206 (1953), as support.&quot;
Id. at 692. The Court explained that Mezei involved an excludable alien,
and, as we describe above, it then distinguished Mezei from the cases before
it by invoking the entry fiction. Id. at 693-94 (&quot;Although Mezei, like
the present cases, involves indefinite detention, it differs from the present
cases in a critical respect. . . . His presence on Ellis Island did not
count as entry into this country once again.&quot;).</P>

<P>The government first contends in these appeals that this portion of the
Court's opinion in Zadvydas demonstrates that the detention of excludable
aliens cannot raise constitutional concerns because such detention &quot;does
not implicate the Fifth Amendment.&quot; Gov't Supp. Br. re Rosales at 50
(emphasis added). We could not more vehemently disagree. Excludable aliens-like
all aliens-are clearly protected by the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth
and Fourteenth Amendments:</P>

<P>The fourteenth amendment to the constitution is not confined to the protection
of citizens. It says: &quot;Nor shall any state deprive any person of life,
liberty, or property without due process of law; nor deny to any person
within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.&quot; These provisions
are universal in their application, to all persons within the territorial
jurisdiction, without regard to any differences of race, of color, or of
nationality; and the equal protection of the laws is a pledge of the protection
of equal laws.</P>

<P>Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356, 369 (1886). While we respect the historical
tradition of the &quot;entry fiction,&quot; we do not believe it applies
to deprive aliens living in the United States of their status as &quot;persons&quot;
for the purposes of constitutional due process. In fact, in Mathews v. Diaz,
the Supreme Court held in regard to Cuban aliens who were in the United
States on immigration parole pursuant to 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1182(d)(5), that
&quot;[e]ven one whose presence in this country is unlawful, involuntary,
or transitory is entitled to that constitutional protection [of the Due
Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments].&quot; Mathews v.
Diaz, 426 U.S. 67, 75 n.7, 77 (1976); see also Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202,
210 (1982) (&quot;Whatever his status under the immigration laws, an alien
is surely a 'person' in any ordinary sense of that term.&quot;).</P>

<P>As we understand the entry fiction, and the Supreme Court's discussion
of it in Zadvydas, excludable aliens are treated differently for due process
purposes than deportable aliens: they are entitled to less process.28 In
Landon v. Plasencia, the Court explained that &quot;once an alien gains
admission to our country and begins to develop the ties that go with permanent
residence his constitutional status changes accordingly. Our cases have
frequently suggested that a continuously present resident alien is entitled
to a fair hearing when threatened with deportation.&quot; Landon, 459 U.S.
at 32 (citations omitted) (emphasis added). And in Mezei, the Court held
that:</P>

<P>It is true that aliens who have once passed through our gates, even illegally,
may be expelled only after proceedings conforming to traditional standards
of fairness encompassed in due process of law. But an alien on the threshold
of initial entry stands on a different footing: &quot;Whatever the procedure
authorized by Congress is, it is due process as far as an alien denied entry
is concerned.&quot;</P>

<P>Mezei, 345 U.S. at 212 (citations omitted) (quoting United States ex
rel. Knauff v. Shaughnessy, 338 U.S. 537, 544 (1950)) (emphasis added).
The fact that excludable aliens are entitled to less process, however, does
not mean that they are not at all protected by</P>

<P>the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. If excludable
aliens were not protected by even the substantive component of constitutional
due process, as the government appears to argue, we do not see why the United
States government could not torture or summarily execute them. Because we
do not believe that our Constitution could permit persons living in the
United States-whether they can be admitted for permanent residence or not-to
be subjected to any government action without limit, we conclude that government
treatment of excludable aliens must implicate the Due Process Clause of
the Fifth Amendment.29</P>

<P>b. Indefinite Detention of Excludable Aliens under the Fifth Amendment</P>

<P>Although we believe that the Supreme Court's decision in Zadvydas fully
supports our conclusion that the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth
Amendments apply to excludable aliens, we recognize that the Zadvydas Court
left open the question whether the indefinite detention of excludable aliens
raises the same constitutional concerns under those clauses as the indefinite
detention of aliens who have entered the United States. We now conclude
that it does.</P>

<P>In United States v. Salerno, the Supreme Court explained that &quot;the
Due Process Clause protects individuals against two types of government
action. So- called 'substantive due process' prevents the government from
engaging in conduct that 'shocks the conscience' or interferes with rights
'implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.' When government action depriving
a person of life, liberty, or property survives substantive due process
scrutiny, it must still be implemented in a fair manner. This requirement
has traditionally been referred to as 'procedural' due process.&quot; United
States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 746 (1987) (citations omitted). The Zadvydas
Court reiterated that &quot;[f]reedom from imprisonment-from government
custody, detention, or other forms of physical restraint-lies at the heart
of the liberty that [the Due Process] Clause protects.&quot; Zadvydas, 533
U.S. at 690 (citing Foucha v. Louisiana, 504 U.S. 71, 80 (1992)).</P>

<P>Therefore, government detention violates a person's substantive due process
rights unless such detention is &quot;ordered in a criminal proceeding with
adequate procedural protections&quot; or &quot;in certain special and 'narrow'
non-punitive 'circumstances,' where a special justification, such as harm-threatening
mental illness, outweighs the 'individual's constitutionally protected interest
in avoiding physical restraint.'&quot; Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 690 (citing
Salerno, 481 U.S. at 739, and quoting Foucha, 504 U.S. at 80; Kansas v.
Hendricks, 521 U.S. 346, 356 (1997)) (emphasis in original). In Zadvydas,
the Court determined that the detention of removable aliens by the INS is
&quot;civil, not criminal, and we assume that [it is] nonpunitive in purpose
and effect.&quot; Id. The Court then looked to the regulatory goals of the
statute to determine whether they constituted sufficient &quot;special justification&quot;
to outweigh the aliens' interest in avoiding detention. According to the
government's brief in Zadvydas, the regulatory goals of IIRIRA's post-removal-period
detention provision are &quot;'ensuring the appearance of aliens at future
immigration proceedings' and '[p]reventing danger to the community.'&quot;
Id. (quoting Brief for Respondents in No. 99-7791, p. 24). The Court concluded
that the flight prevention justification was &quot;weak or nonexistent where
removal seems a remote possibility at best,&quot; and the dangerousness
justification could not be supported by alien status alone. Id. at 690-91.
Explaining that &quot;[i]n cases in which preventive detention is of potentially
indefinite duration, we have also demanded that the dangerousness rationale
be accompanied by some other special circumstance, such as mental illness,
that helps to create the danger,&quot; the Court held that an alien's status
as removable did not constitute such a special circumstance because it &quot;bears
no relation to a detainee's dangerousness.&quot; Id. at 691-92 (emphasis
in original).</P>

<P>Rosales's and Carballo's status as excludable aliens does not alter the
above analysis. An excludable alien who cannot be removed to his country
of origin presents no greater risk of flight than the aliens who could not
be removed to their countries of origin in Zadvydas; nor does an excludable
alien's status relate any more to his dangerousness than the removable status
of the aliens in Zadvydas related to their dangerousness.30 However, the
government contends that because Rosales and Carballo are excludable aliens,
their detention should not be subject to the same analysis as the detention
of the aliens in Zadvydas. According to the government, because excludable
aliens do not have a constitutional right to enter the United States, the
INS must be permitted to detain them indefinitely if they cannot be removed.</P>

<P>We recognize that excludable aliens do not have a constitutional right
to enter or be admitted to the United States; indeed, no alien has a constitutional
right to enter or be admitted to the United States. We also recognize that
the INS is faced with an extremely difficult situation in the case of aliens
who legally cannot enter or be admitted to the United States, yet who, by
virtue of the fact that their country of origin will not repatriate them,
are in the United States. However, the Supreme Court in Zadvydas confronted
much the same situation. Aliens who are removed on grounds of deportability
do not have a constitutional right to stay in the United States, and, as
the Court recognized, Congress has plenary power to create immigration law.
Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 695-96. &quot;But that power is subject to important
constitutional limitations.&quot; Id. at 695. Like the Supreme Court, we
do not question &quot;the right of Congress to remove aliens, to subject
them to supervision with conditions when released from detention, or to
incarcerate them where appropriate for violations of those conditions.&quot;
Id. &quot;Rather, the issue we address is whether aliens that the Government
finds itself unable to remove are to be condemned to an indefinite term
of imprisonment within the United States.&quot; Id.</P>

<P>The Supreme Court in Zadvydas concluded that &quot;for the reasons we
have set forth, we believe that an alien's liberty interest is, at the least,
strong enough to raise a serious question as to whether, irrespective of
the procedures used, the Constitution permits detention that is indefinite
and potentially permanent.&quot; Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 696. We draw the
same conclusion with regard to excludable aliens. If the Due Process Clause
of the Fifth Amendment applies to Rosales and Carballo, as we believe that
it must, we do not see how we could conclude that the indefinite and potentially
permanent detention of Rosales and Carballo raises any less serious constitutional
concerns than the indefinite and potentially permanent detention of the
aliens in Zadvydas. We emphasize that we understand that this situation,
involving criminal aliens whose removal cannot be effected, is a difficult
one: we, too, find it unpalatable that inadmissible aliens who have previously
abused the privilege of immigration parole should be permitted additional
opportunities to live in this country simply because their country of origin
will not have them back. As the Zadvydas Court explained, though, &quot;[t]he
choice . . . is not between imprisonment and the alien 'living at large.'
It is between imprisonment and supervision under release conditions that
may not be violated.&quot; Id.31 Moreover, we find it not only unpalatable
but also untenable to conclude that under the Due Process Clause of the
Fifth Amendment persons living in the United States-whether by our choice
or not-could be subjected to a life sentence in prison simply because their
country of origin will not have them back. A life sentence in prison, in
fact, seems to us no less impermissible than the government's torture or
summary execution of these aliens.</P>

<P>The government also argues that in Mezei, the Supreme Court held that
the indefinite detention of an excludable alien was permissible under the
Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, and the government further argues
that the Zadvydas Court reaffirmed Mezei. We note at the outset that the
Zadvydas Court explicitly refused to address the continuing validity of
Mezei: &quot;we need not consider the aliens' claim that subsequent developments
have undermined Mezei's legal authority.&quot; Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 694.
Inasmuch as the Court in Mezei permitted the potentially indefinite detention
of an excludable alien, however, we agree with the government that we must
address Mezei's ramifications for Rosales and Carballo.32 We believe that
Mezei does not govern the outcome of the instant cases for two reasons.
First, the Mezei Court explicitly grounded its decision in the special circumstances
of a national emergency and the determination by the Attorney General that
Mezei presented a threat to national security.33 The Court, in fact, located
the Attorney General's authority to exclude and detain Mezei in the Passport
Act of 1918. Mezei, 345 U.S. at 210-11 (&quot;Congress expressly authorized
the President to impose additional restrictions on aliens entering or leaving
the United States during periods of international tension and strife. That
authorization, originally enacted in the Passport Act of 1918, continues
in effect during the present emergency.&quot;). Moreover, in regard to the
proposition that Mezei be released on immigration parole, the Court stated:
&quot;An exclusion proceeding grounded on danger to the national security
. . . presents different considerations; neither the rationale nor the statutory
authority for such release exists.&quot; Id. at 216. Particularly in a post-September
11 world, we recognize that in special circumstances prolonged post-removal-period
detention may be warranted. See Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 696 (&quot;Neither
do we consider terrorism or other special circumstances where special arguments
might be made for forms of preventive detention and for heightened deference
to the judgments of the political branches with respect to matters of national
security.&quot;). There are, however, no special circumstances involving
national security in the instant cases.</P>

<P>Second, we believe that the Court's implicit conclusion in Mezei is eclipsed
by the conclusion drawn from the Salerno line of cases that the indefinite
detention of excludable aliens does raise constitutional concerns. All of
the cases that the Zadvydas Court relied on in assessing the constitutional
due process concerns implicated by the indefinite detention of aliens who
are removable on grounds of deportability were decided after Mezei. See,
e.g., Kansas v. Hendricks, 521 U.S. 346 (1997); Foucha v. Louisiana, 504
U.S. 71 (1992); United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739 (1987); Jackson v.
Indiana, 406 U.S. 715 (1972). In these cases, the contours of constitutionally
permissible civil detention are rigorously delineated-a substantial jurisprudential
development from the time that Mezei was decided. As we explained above,
the Zadvydas Court held on the basis of these cases that civil detention
is constitutionally permissible only &quot;in certain special and narrow
non-punitive circumstances where a special justification . . . outweighs
the individual's constitutionally protected interest in avoiding physical
restraint.&quot; Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 690. As we also explained above,
we do not believe that any such special circumstances outweigh Rosales's
and Carballo's interest in avoiding indefinite and potentially permanent
INS detention. Although we must-as a lower federal court-apply all pertinent
Supreme Court precedent, it is not our role to reconcile cases whose application
leads to opposite conclusions.34 Therefore, to the extent that we could
conclude, in reliance on the Court's holding in Mezei, that the indefinite
detention of excludable aliens is constitutionally permissible, we believe
such a conclusion to be fatally undermined by the Court's later decisions
in the Salerno line of cases.</P>

<P>3. Statutory Construction of &sect; 1231(a)(6) as Applied to Excludable
Aliens</P>

<P>&quot;[T]he canon of constitutional avoidance has no application in the
absence of statutory ambiguity.&quot; United States v. Oakland Cannabis
Buyers' Coop., 532 U.S. 483, 494 (2001). Therefore, prior to construing</P>

<P>&sect; 1231(a)(6) (2000) to contain a reasonable time limitation, the
Zadvydas Court addressed whether Congress had clearly indicated an intent
in the statute to authorize indefinite post-removal-period detention of
aliens whose removal cannot be effected. Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 696-99. After
reviewing the history of the statute, the Court concluded that &quot;[w]e
have found nothing in the history of these statutes that clearly demonstrates
a congressional intent to authorize indefinite, perhaps permanent, detention.
Consequently, interpreting the statute to avoid a serious constitutional
threat, we conclude that, once removal is no longer reasonably foreseeable,
continued detention is no longer authorized by statute.&quot; Id. at 699.
We again see no reason to interpret the statute any differently for excludable
aliens.35</P>

<P>Like the Supreme Court in Zadvydas, then, we recognize six months as
a presumptively reasonable period for the post-removal detention of excludable
aliens. &quot;After this 6-month period, once the alien provides good reason
to believe that there is no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably
foreseeable future, the Government must respond with evidence sufficient
to rebut that showing.&quot; Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 701. In the instant cases,
we conclude that there is no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably
foreseeable future. Although the government presented evidence of our continuing
negotiations with Cuba over the return of Cuban nationals excluded from
the United States, neither Rosales nor Carballo is currently on a list of
persons to be returned.</P>

<P>III. CONCLUSION</P>

<P>Under either the Supreme Court's construction in Zadvydas or our construction
in regard to excludable aliens, we read 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1231(a)(6) (2000)
to contain an implicit reasonable time limitation. Because there is no significant
likelihood that Rosales and Carballo will be removed in the reasonably foreseeable
future and because the INS has detained them longer than six months, we
conclude that the INS's detention of Rosales and Carballo is no longer reasonable
and is therefore not authorized by IIRIRA's post-removal-period detention
provision. We REVERSE the district courts' denials of Rosales's and Carballo's
habeas petitions, and we REMAND for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>DISSENT</P>

<P>BOGGS, Circuit Judge, dissenting.</P>

<P>In deciding these two consolidated cases today, the court makes two holdings
that are both quite striking, novel and, in my opinion, incorrect. I therefore
respectfully dissent. The court first finds that Congress, in the course
of enacting a statute that virtually all concede was designed to tighten
immigration procedures, instead amended the statute in such a way as to
obliterate a longstanding distinction that recognized the lessened constitutional
protection of persons who had been affirmatively denied entry into the United
States, detained at the border, and physically allowed inside the country
only as a matter of legislative grace. Instead, the court finds that Congress
deliberately accorded such persons the same status as long-time permanent
residents. Second, and perhaps even more disturbing, the court essentially
accords such persons all of the due process rights of American citizens.
The court therefore makes it impossible, in our circuit at least, for the
United States government to detain for more than six months any number of
aliens who present themselves at our border and are denied entry, or are
paroled into the United States only conditionally. It further extends this
status regardless of whatever criminal acts those persons may have committed.
I believe that this result cannot be derived from the text of the Constitution
and is contrary to existing Supreme Court precedent, which the Supreme Court
has recently explicitly relied on and refused to overrule.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>To begin with the broader holding, the court finds that full due process
applies to all persons at or within the borders of the United States, and
that such due process is not merely procedural, but essentially accords
any such person a right to remain at liberty in the United States comparable
to that accorded to United States citizens. It does this by commencing with
the unremarkable proposition that the government may not wantonly execute
or torture a person, and then extrapolates that the government is disabled
from applying its immigration and criminal laws to such excludable aliens
in ways that are different from those that apply to deportable aliens.</P>

<P>This holding has nothing to do with what we would generally classify
as &quot;process.&quot; Rosales and Carballo have had that, in abundance.
They have been able to argue, before independent arbiters, that they are
not the persons to whom the law is intended to apply, that they do not come
within the reach of the law, and any other procedural issues they may wish
to raise. They have had this review before the various levels of the administrative
bureaucracy prescribed by Congress and before the courts of the United States.
It cannot be disputed that Rosales and Garcia are both &quot;excludable&quot;
aliens in that they sought admission to the United States, were detained
at the border before entering the United States, and were paroled into the
United States only as a matter of grace and on the condition that their
parole may be revoked at any time, and especially for the commission of
criminal offenses.</P>

<P>All of the many agencies and courts to have considered their cases have
ruled that they come within the mandate of Congress that persons who are
&quot;excludable&quot; and have committed crimes of sufficient seriousness
should be removed from the United States and, if not immediately deportable,
be detained at the discretion of the Attorney General. There is little doubt
that Carballo and Rosales fit in this category of excludable aliens who
have committed serious offenses. Simply to detail the crimes of which they
have been convicted, and others of which they have been arrested, makes
this abundantly clear. The highlights of Rosales's criminal career include
arrests for aggravated battery, possession of marijuana, burglary and loitering
and convictions for possession of marijuana, resisting arrest, grand theft,
burglary, grand larceny, escape from a penal institution, and conspiracy
with intent to distribute cocaine. Op. at 6. Carballo, no less prolific,
has been arrested for aggravated assault, burglary, grand larceny, battery,
carrying a concealed weapon and an unlicensed firearm, trespass, and possession
of marijuana. He has been convicted of attempted first-degree murder, aggravated
assault with a deadly weapon, and robbery. Op. at 8. If this law cannot
be applied to these persons, it seems clear that no alien, no matter his
degree of criminality, can be subject to this law.</P>

<P>The court provides a number of soothing statements as to how certain
actions against such aliens might be permissible, but it provides no principled
reasons for such distinctions, nor a square holding that in fact they can
be implemented. May parole conditions for excludable alien criminals be
more onerous than for citizens? It implies that they may be, by referring
to parole conditions and practices applied to Rosales that are not (and
constitutionally may not be) applied to criminals on parole. Op. at 12 &amp;
nn.7-8. However, the opinion provides no basis for such a distinction. May
Congress prescribe indefinite detention as a punishment for any violation
of such conditions when similar punishment does not apply to citizen parole-violators?
No answer is given. A careful reading of the court's logic and rhetoric
would indicate that the very same type of attack that is mounted against
the congressional mandate here would be found congenial by this court when
mounted against any such distinction. Would any more draconian punishment,
such as that suggested above, or an enactment that excludable aliens could
be detained indefinitely as punishment for any criminal infraction, pass
the muster of this court, under its broad rubric of due process, or under
its application of the Eighth Amendment? In oral argument, it was indicated
that any violation of parole, under current law, was punishable by at most
one year's additional detention. Would it violate the Ex Post Facto Clause
for any alien already excluded from this country to have applied to him
indefinite detention? Again, no logic is given that would answer the question.</P>

<P>The court's approach leads to a host of practical problems, both at the
level of this circuit and of the nation. As the court indicates, we have
jurisdiction only because the INS happened to choose to detain these aliens
within the boundaries of this circuit, at FCI Memphis and at Lexington.
Op. at 7, 9. Since our holding is generally at odds with those of most other
circuits, and explicitly at odds with four other circuits, it may well be
that the INS will simply choose to remove from the Sixth Circuit all those
aliens to whom this dictate would apply. Carrera-Valdez v. Perryman, 211
F .3d 1046, 1048 (7th Cir. 2000); Ho v. Greene, 204 F.3d 1045, 1054-55 (10th
Cir. 2000); Chi Thon Ngo v. INS, 192 F.3d 390, 397-98 (3d Cir. 1999); Guzman
v. Tippy, 130 F.3d 64, 66 (2d Cir. 1997); see also Barrera-Echavarria v.
Rison, 44 F.3d 1441, 1445 (9th Cir. 1995); Gisbert v. Attorney General,
988 F.2d 1437, 1448 (5th Cir.), amended by 997 F.2d 1122 (5th Cir. 1993)
(per curiam); Garcia-Mir v. Meese, 788 F.2d 1446, 1449-51 (11th Cir. 1993);
Palma v. Verdeyen, 676 F.2d 100, 103-04 (4th Cir. 1982).</P>

<P>As against these newly minted rights, we have longstanding and clear
Supreme Court precedent. The Supreme Court, in determining the scope of
due process rights of aliens, has consistently distinguished between deportable
and excludable aliens. In Shaughnessy v. United States ex rel. Mezei, 345
U.S. 206 (1953), the Court definitively held that excludable aliens, unlike
aliens who are merely deportable, have no constitutional right against indefinite
detention in the event that they cannot be returned to their country of
origin. Indeed, the circumstances of Mezei were far more compelling than
those of Rosales and Carballo. Mezei had committed no crime. He had been
a longtime resident of the United States, and had always been law abiding
during that time. He simply went abroad for a period of 19 months, and was
detained at the border when he returned. The Supreme Court held that he
could be detained indefinitely, if no country could be found to take him.</P>

<P>In Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678 (2001), the Supreme Court reinforced
the distinction between excludable and deportable aliens. There, the Court
suggested that deportable aliens may have a constitutional right against
indefinite detention. Id. at 682 (suggesting that &quot;indefinite detention
beyond the time necessary for removal&quot; of deportable aliens &quot;would
raise serious constitutional concerns&quot;). But the Court carefully restricted
its concerns to deportable aliens. As the Court explained, &quot;the distinction
between an alien who has effected an entry into the United States and one
who has never entered runs throughout immigration law.&quot; Id. at 691.
Specifically, the Court recognized again that &quot;it is well established
that certain constitutional protections available to persons inside the
United States are unavailable to persons outside of our geographic borders,&quot;
including those who have not formally &quot;entered&quot; the United States,
such as excludable aliens paroled into the United States. Ibid.</P>

<P>The Supreme Court specifically indicated that it was not questioning
the validity of Mezei, and noted that the case of Zadvydas &quot;differed
in a critical respect&quot; from Mezei exactly because Mezei had been detained
at the border, while Zadvydas had entered the United States. Id. at 693
(emphasis added). The Supreme Court has recently and emphatically instructed
us that we should leave the overruling of Supreme Court precedents to that
Court, even if we believe, or divine, that the Court should, or will, overrule
them. Agostini v. Felton, 521 U.S. 203, 237 (1997). No matter how much the
court may disagree with the distinction between excludable and deportable
aliens, it simply cannot be disputed that the controlling Supreme Court
precedent makes that distinction and holds that excludable aliens do not
have a constitutional right to be permitted to remain in the United States
at liberty if their removal cannot be seasonably obtained.1</P>

<P>The court's holding, applying as it does to persons with very extensive
criminal records, would obviously apply to persons otherwise blameless,
who have simply been detained attempting to enter the United States: After
a maximum of six months, if such persons can not be sent elsewhere, they
would have to be released into the United States, with some possible exception
for individualized determinations. Thus, if hundreds, or thousands, or hundreds
of thousands of such persons present themselves at our borders, this court
holds that the government of the United States is constitutionally disabled
from doing anything, after a short interval, other than set all such persons
at liberty in our country. While this result could be good policy, it seems
inconceivable that such a disabling of congressional policy choices is consistent
with a fair reading of the Immigration and Naturalization Clause of the
Constitution, see, e.g., Galvan v. Press, 347 U.S. 522, 531 (1954)</P>

<P>(&quot;That the formulation of [policies pertaining to the entry of aliens
and their right to remain here] is entrusted exclusively to Congress has
become about as firmly imbedded in the legislative and judicial tissues
of our body politic as any aspect of our government&quot;), or with the
intent of anyone in adopting the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The process
that is due to persons to whom the government has explicitly denied entry
into the country is quite different from what is due to others, as a matter
of constitutional law.</P>

<P>Turning to the statutory argument, the court essentially makes two points.
The first is that since the language of IIRIRA uses the term &quot;inadmissible,&quot;
it has, therefore, abolished the distinction between excludable and deportable
aliens, for all purposes. Op. at [36a-37a]. The court also remarkably concludes,
by holding that the statute does not permit indefinite detention for excludable
aliens as well, that Congress abolished the distinction with the result
of giving excludable aliens the same rights as deportable aliens. Of course,
Congress had quite the contrary intention: it sought to tighten immigration
regulations. As Congress itself provided in the text of the statute, courts
were not to construe IIRIRA to &quot;create any procedural right or benefit
that is legally enforceable.&quot; 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1231(h). The intent of
Congress is clear that it had intended, by using the language of &quot;inadmissibility,&quot;
to subject deportable aliens to the same potential for indefinite detention,
if they could not be removed after the commission of a serious crime, that
excludable aliens had been subject to both statutorily and constitutionally
for years.</P>

<P>The court's development of a &quot;reasonable time&quot; limitation for
the detention of &quot;excludable&quot; aliens is based wholly on the Supreme
Court's effective rewriting of the statute for deportable aliens, which
is all that the Court had before it in Zadvydas. Applying this reasonable
time limitation to excludable aliens misunderstands the Supreme Court's
analysis in Zadvydas and, more fundamentally, the canon of constitutional
avoidance. The Court in Zadvydas did not hold that the text, or even the
legislative history, of the statute indicated Congress's intent to place
a reasonable time limitation on the detention of &quot;deportable&quot;
aliens. 533 U.S. at 697-98. Instead, the Court employed the canon of construction
that Congress does not intend for its statutes to raise serious constitutional
problems, also known as the canon of constitutional avoidance. Id. at 698.
Specifically, the Court relied on the statutory text that the Attorney General
&quot;may&quot; detain individuals after the removal period. Id. at 697.
For the Court, this permissive language did not necessarily confer unfettered
discretion on the Attorney General to detain aliens, but must have meant,
because of the canon of constitutional avoidance, that the Attorney General
should exercise his discretion within constitutional limits. Of course,
as demonstrated above, governing Supreme Court precedent, including Zadvydas,
clearly indicates that there is no constitutional limit on the detention
of excludable aliens. Thus, the Attorney General &quot;may,&quot; in his
discretion, detain excludable aliens beyond the ninety-day removal period,
and the detention need not comply with the reasonable time limitation that
cabins his discretion with regard to deportable aliens arising from the
canon of constitutional avoidance and nothing else.</P>

<P>Indeed, its merits aside, the canon of constitutional avoidance has historically
contemplated precisely such a result. From the beginnings of statutory construction
in federal courts, the Supreme Court has held that &quot;an Act of Congress
ought not be construed to violate the Constitution if any other possible
construction remains available.&quot; See NLRB v. Catholic Bishop, 440 U.S.
490, 500 (1979) (discussing the opinion of Chief Justice Marshall in Murray
v. The Charming Betsy, 6 U.S. (2 Cranch) 64 (1804)). The canon of constitutional
avoidance is a majoritarian default rule. That is, the canon draws its legitimacy
from the premise that Congress generally does not intend for its statutes
to exceed constitutional limits. But this supposition cannot be significantly
expanded without straining the justification beyond reason. Congress often
intends to legislate to, even if not beyond, the limitations of the Constitution.
If the canon of constitutional avoidance is to be justifiable, it must at
least permit Congress to legislate to the limits of what is constitutionally
permissible.</P>

<P>There is no textual source for the Supreme Court's application of a specific
time limitation to the Attorney General's discretion to detain aliens under
IIRIRA. Instead, the word &quot;may&quot; on which the Supreme Court focused
in Zadvydas, if the canon of constitutional avoidance is to have any meaning,
permits the Attorney General to detain beyond the removal period, but only
as allowed by the Constitution. And the Supreme Court is clear that the
Constitution does not grant &quot;excludable&quot; aliens a right to release
into the United States after a &quot;reasonable time.&quot; Thus, that &quot;deportable&quot;
aliens may only be detained for a &quot;reasonable time&quot; after the
removal period but &quot;excludable&quot; aliens may be detained indefinitely
is not only a consistent, but the required, reading of &sect; 1231(a)(6)
in the context of the canon of constitutional avoidance.</P>

<P>In contrast, our court's holding that extends the &quot;reasonable time&quot;
limitation to excludable aliens is a classic example of the tail wagging
the dog. The Supreme Court rewrites a statute with respect to one class
of persons, to avoid constitutional doubts, and we are then required to
read the statute in the same way in cases where there are no constitutional
doubts. This does not follow.</P>

<P>I freely grant that there is some anomaly in having the same words mean
different things when applied</P>

<P>to different groups of people. However, that is a natural consequence
of an aggressive application of the constitutional-doubt standard, implemented
by a conceded rewriting of the statute, rather than by choosing between
plausible alternatives. And, while certainly not conclusive, the fact that
the Supreme Court chose to vacate our previous decision in Rosales-Garcia,
which followed the same logic as the court displays today, is some indication
that that result is not lambently clear to the Supreme Court. Thoms v. Rosales-Garcia,
534 U.S. 1063 (mem.), vacating and remanding Rosales-Garcia v. Holland,
238 F.3d 704 (6th Cir. 2001).</P>

<P>Interestingly, Justice Kennedy noted this dilemma</P>

<P>in his dissenting opinion. He did characterize both alternatives as unsustainable,
but the nature of the situation requires us to accept one or the other.
Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 710-11 (Kennedy, J., dissenting). Under these circumstances,
I believe it does far less violence to the language of the statute, to congressional
intent, and to a proper understanding of the canon of constitutional avoidance
to confront the words of the statute and interpret them according to their
tenor, in a case where any &quot;constitutional doubt&quot; is far less
than in Zadvydas, assuming that there is any doubt whatsoever.</P>

<P>In short, today's decision, perhaps out of a misplaced concern for the
individuals before us, grossly dis-</P>

<P>torts the meaning of a statute, and greatly diminishes the range of policy
choices available to the political branches in a field uniquely committed
to their discretion. Whether indefinite detention of persons as incorrigible
as Rosales and Carballo is good policy is not for us to decide. It is a
matter for Congress, subject at most to a requirement that some procedural
fairness be applied under the Due Process Clause, a requirement that has
been amply fulfilled.</P>

<P>1 The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of
1996 (&quot;IIRIRA&quot;) substantially altered the landscape in immigration
law. &quot;Among the changes brought by the IIRIRA was a shift in basic
immigration terminology.&quot; Chi Thon Ngo v. INS, 192 F.3d 390, 395 n.
4 (3d Cir. 1999). Pre-IIRIRA, the law referred to &quot;excludable&quot;
aliens, &quot;those who were ineligible for admission or entry into the
United States.&quot; Id.; see also 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1182(a) (1994). &quot;Excludable&quot;
aliens could be subject to exclusion proceedings; &quot;'[d]eportation'
proceedings, in contrast, were brought against those aliens who had gained
admission into the country.&quot; Chi Thon Ngo, 192 F.3d at 395 n. 4; see
also 8 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 1251(a), 1252 (1994). &quot;The deportation hearing
is the usual means of proceeding against an alien already physically in
the United States, and the exclusion hearing is the usual means of proceeding
against an alien outside the United States seeking admission.&quot; Landon
v. Plasencia, 459 U.S. 21, 25 (1982).</P>

<P>IIRIRA &quot;refers to 'inadmissible' aliens[, 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1182(a)
(2000),] in the place of 'excludable' aliens. Although there are still separate
grounds of 'inadmissibility' and 'deportability,' the distinction now turns
on whether an alien has been 'admitted' to the United States, rather than
on whether the alien has gained 'entry.'&quot; Chi Thon Ngo, 193 F.3d at
395 n. 4. An alien who does not enter the United States legally is not &quot;admitted.&quot;
8 U.S.C. &sect; 1101(a)(13) (2000). &quot;Inadmissible&quot; aliens, therefore,
include aliens who have not entered the United States (formerly excludable)
and those who entered illegally (formerly deportable). 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1182(a)(6)
(2000). Both &quot;inadmissible&quot; and &quot;deportable&quot; aliens
are now subject to removal proceedings. 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1229a (2000).</P>

<P>2 8 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 1182(d) (1994) stipulates that &quot;such parole
of such alien shall not be regarded as an admission of the alien.&quot;
See also Sale v. Haitian Ctrs. Council, Inc., 509 U.S. 155, 175 (1993).
This paradox of paroling aliens into the United States yet refusing to recognize
their &quot;entry&quot; into the United States has been termed the &quot;entry
fiction&quot; by some courts. See, e.g., Gisbert v. Attorney General, 988
F.2d 1437, 1440 (5th Cir. 1993).</P>

<P>3 According to the affidavit of James J. Carragher, the current Coordinator
of the Office of Cuban Affairs in the State Department, Cuba agreed to repatriate
2,746 of the excluded Mariel Cubans in 1984. Rosales Supplemental Joint
Appendix (&quot;Rosales Supp. J.A.&quot;) at 1. As of January 2002, 1,589
of these individuals have been returned to Cuba. However, neither Rosales
nor Carballo was on the list of excluded aliens in 1984-both were excluded
after that date. Although Carragher attested that negotiation between the
United States and Cuba regarding the excluded Mariel Cubans is ongoing,
there is no evidence that Cuba has any particular intention to repatriate
Rosales or Carballo.</P>

<P>4 There is also evidence that Carballo had a criminal record in Cuba.</P>

<P>5 Carballo was detained by the INS in 1988 &quot;pending exclusion proceedings,&quot;
see Carballo J.A. at 125, even though he was not actually excluded until
1994, see Carballo J.A. at 132.</P>

<P>6 We note that even if Rosales had been released from INS custody, such
release would not necessarily moot his appeal. For the purposes of the habeas
statutes, a petitioner need only be &quot;in custody&quot; at the time the
petition was filed. See Spencer v. Kemna, 523 U.S. 1, 7 (1998). Rosales
was in INS detention when he filed his habeas petition, and thus the government's
argument regarding custody fails regardless of whether Rosales was in detention
or released on parole at the time of his appeal.</P>

<P>7 Under the Cuban Review Plan:</P>

<P>The Associate Commissioner for Enforcement [of the INS] may, in the exercise
of discretion, grant parole to a detained Mariel Cuban for emergent reasons
or for reasons deemed strictly in the public interest. . . . A decision
to release on parole may contain such special conditions as are considered
appropriate. . . .</P>

<P>The Associate Commissioner for Enforcement shall have authority, in the
exercise of discretion, to revoke parole in respect to Mariel Cubans. A
district director may also revoke parole when, in the district director's
opinion, revocation is in the public interest and circumstances do not reasonably
permit referral of the case to the Associate Commissioner. Parole may be
revoked in the exercise of discretion when, in the opinion of the revoking
official:</P>

<P>(1) The purposes of parole have been served;</P>

<P>(2) The Mariel Cuban violates any condition of parole;</P>

<P>(3) It is appropriate to enforce an order of exclusion or to commence
proceedings against a Mariel Cuban; or</P>

<P>(4) The period of parole has expired without being renewed.</P>

<P>8 C.F.R. &sect; 212.12(b)(1) &amp; (h) (2002).</P>

<P>8 The statutory provision authorizing the Attorney General to parole
Rosales provides as follows:</P>

<P>The Attorney General may . . . in his discretion parole into the United
States temporarily under such conditions as he may prescribe only on a case-by-case
basis for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit any
alien applying for admission to the United States, but such parole of such
alien shall not be regarded as an admission of the alien and when the purposes
of such parole shall, in the opinion of the Attorney General, have been
served the alien shall forthwith return or be returned to the custody from
which he was paroled and thereafter his case shall continue to be dealt
with in the same manner as that of any other applicant for admission to
the United States.</P>

<P>8 U.S.C. &sect; 1182(d)(5)(A) (2000).</P>

<P>9 The government points out that the INS based its previous revocation
of Rosales's parole on his criminal conduct, and the government therefore
argues that Rosales himself controls whether the INS will indefinitely detain
him again. The Supreme Court has held that &quot;for purposes of assessing
the likelihood that state authorities will reinflict a given injury, we
generally have been unwilling to assume that the party seeking relief will
repeat the type of misconduct that would once again place him or her at
risk of that injury.&quot; Honig v. Doe, 484 U.S. 305, 320 (1988). However,
as discussed above, the INS can revoke Rosales's parole for a number of
reasons-some of which are within Rosales's control, but some of which are
not. In Olmstead v. Zimring, 527 U.S. 581 (1999), mentally disabled patients
challenged their confinement in segregated as opposed to community-based
programs. Although the patients were in community-based programs by the
time the case was heard, the Court held that &quot;in view of the multiple
institutional placements [the patients] have experienced, the controversy
they brought to court is 'capable of repetition, yet evading review.'&quot;
Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 594 n. 6. Because Rosales's parole could be revoked
for reasons that are not within his control, his parole is more like the
institutional placement described in Olmstead than parole in the traditional,
criminal sense as described in Spencer, 523 U.S. at 15, in which the parolee
can control whether his parole is revoked.</P>

<P>10 We note that the government does not claim that Carballo's recent
placement in a residential substance-abuse recovery program moots his case.
As the government observes, Carballo's habeas petition challenges the government's
authority to restrain his liberty by sending him to a halfway house or other
restrictive program.</P>

<P>11 In the district court, the government also argued that Carballo's
successive habeas petition was barred by the doctrines of res judicata and
law of the case; the district court denied Carballo's petition on the theory
of law of the case. The government does not raise the law of the case argument
on appeal, and, as the doctrine is prudential rather than jurisdictional,
we need not address it. See Christianson v. Colt Indus. Operating Corp.,
486 U.S. 800, 817 (1988) (&quot;[A] district court's adherence to law of
the case cannot insulate an issue from appellate review.&quot;). We note,
however, that it is not at all clear to us that the law-of-the-case doctrine
should apply to successive habeas petitions. &quot;Law-of-the-case rules
have developed to maintain consistency and avoid reconsideration of matters
once decided during the course of a single continuing lawsuit.&quot; 18B
Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Edward H. Cooper, Federal Practice
and Procedure &sect; 4478 (2d ed.2002). Whether successive habeas petitions
constitute stages in a single, continuing lawsuit is a question that should
be carefully considered. See Lacy v. Gardino, 791 F.2d 980, 984-85 (1st
Cir.), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 888 (1986). Although we do not decide the
question, we, like the First Circuit, think it likely that each habeas petition
is a separate and distinct case. See id.; see also McClesky v. Zant, 499
U.S. 467, 479-85 (1991) (explaining that the &quot;abuse of the writ&quot;
doctrine arose because, &quot;[a]t common law, res judicata did not attach
to a court's denial of habeas relief. [A] refusal to discharge on one writ
[was] not a bar to the issuance of a new writ.&quot; (quotation omitted));
but cf. Shore v. Warden, Stateville Prison, 942 F.2d 1117, 1123 (7th Cir.1991),
cert. denied, 504 U.S. 922 (1992) ( &quot;[T]he law of the case doctrine
is applicable to habeas proceedings.&quot;); Raulerson v. Wainwright, 753
F.2d 869, 875 (11th Cir.1985) (applying the law of the case doctrine to
a successive habeas petition).</P>

<P>12 &quot;An 'abusive petition' occurs 'where a prisoner files a petition
raising grounds that were available but not relied upon in a prior petition,
or engages in other conduct that disentitle[s] him to the relief he seeks.'&quot;
Schlup, 513 U.S. at 319 n. 34 (quoting Kuhlmann, 477 U.S. at 444 n. 6).</P>

<P>13 In fact, as an executive detainee, Carballo could file a habeas petition
only under &sect; 2241. 28 U.S.C. &sect; 2255 applies to persons &quot;in
custody under sentence of a court established by Act of Congress,&quot;
and 28 U.S.C. &sect; 2254(a) applies to persons &quot;in custody pursuant
to the judgment of a State court.&quot;</P>

<P>14 We note that because Carballo could file a habeas petition only under
&sect; 2241, the limitations we have imposed on federal prisoners who file
&sect; 2241 petitions do not apply. See, e.g., Charles v. Chandler, 180
F.3d 753 (6th Cir. 1999) (holding that federal prisoners generally may not
circumvent the requirements of &sect; 2255 by filing a second or successive
habeas petition under &sect; 2241).</P>

<P>15 In subsequent cases involving prisoners challenging their incarceration
pursuant to their convictions under state or federal law, the Supreme Court
limited the Sanders test for when federal courts may consider the merits
of successive habeas petitions. In McClesky, 499 U.S. at 493-94, the Court
required a showing of &quot;cause and prejudice,&quot; developed in the
context of procedural default, by prisoners filing second or subsequent
habeas petitions that raise new claims. Sawyer v. Whitley, 505 U.S. 333,
339 (1992), extended this requirement to prisoners filing successive habeas
petitions. See also Schlup, 513 U.S. at 318 (&quot;[A] habeas court may
not ordinarily reach the merits of successive claims . . . absent a showing
of cause and prejudice.&quot;) (citation omitted). Carballo, however, is
not being detained on the basis of a criminal conviction under either state
or federal law. Although it would be possible for him to show &quot;cause,&quot;
we do not see how he could show &quot;prejudice&quot; without a trial and
conviction. Therefore, we conclude that the Court's cause and prejudice
requirement does not apply to Carballo.</P>

<P>We note that if the cause and prejudice requirement did apply to Carballo,
we would conclude that he has cause to file a successive habeas petition.
The Ninth Circuit has construed &quot;cause&quot; in the context of successive
habeas petitions to mean &quot;cause for bringing a petition that fails
to present a new ground for relief. In other words, a petitioner must show
cause for seeking review of the same claim twice-such as the discovery of
new facts, or an intervening change in the law, that warrants reexamination
of the same ground for relief raised in an earlier petition.&quot; Campbell
v. Blodgett, 997 F.2d 512, 524 (9th Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 1215
(1994). For the reasons stated below in regard to the &quot;ends of justice&quot;
prong of the Sanders test, we believe that there has been an intervening
change in the law from the time that Carballo filed his habeas petition
in the Northern District of Texas.</P>

<P>Furthermore, the Supreme Court has recognized a &quot;miscarriage of
justice&quot; exception to the cause and prejudice requirement, and the
Court has equated this exception with the &quot;ends of justice&quot; prong
of the Sanders test. See Sawyer, 505 U.S. at 339. Arguably, the Court has
limited this exception for prisoners challenging their state or federal
convictions to cases in which &quot;the petitioner 'establish[es] that under
the probative evidence he has a colorable claim of factual innocence.'&quot;
Id. (quoting Kuhlmann, 477 U.S. at 454). However, like the cause and prejudice
requirement itself, the &quot;actual innocence&quot; requirement cannot
apply to Carballo in that he is not being detained on the basis of a conviction
for a state or federal crime.</P>

<P>16 We would still conclude that IIRIRA and its limiting construction
in Zadvydas constituted a sufficient intervening change in the law to warrant
our review of Carballo's successive habeas petition even if we had concluded
that IIRIRA was not the appropriate statute to apply to Carballo. As we
explain, infra, whether IIRIRA applies to Carballo is a complicated question;
at the very least, the Zadvydas Court's application of IIRIRA to a habeas
petitioner similarly situated to Carballo raises a new question as to what
statute authorizes Carballo's detention.</P>

<P>17 The INA was amended in 1990 by the Immigration Act of 1990, Pub.L.
No. 101-649, 104 Stat. 4471 (1990).</P>

<P>18 IIRIRA was enacted as Division C of the Department of Defense Appropriation
Act, 1997, Pub. L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009-546 (1996), and it was amended
by Pub. L. No. 104-302, 110 Stat. 3656 (1996).</P>

<P>19 We note that Rosales was excluded from the United States on July 10,
1986, he began the detention from which his habeas petition arose in May
of 1997, and he filed his habeas petition in 1998. Carballo began the detention
from which his habeas petition arose in 1988, he filed his habeas petition
in 1990, and he was excluded from the United States in September of 1994.</P>

<P>20 The Fifth Circuit has approached this question as one of retroactivity.
See Zadvydas, 185 F.3d at 286 (&quot;Zadvydas' detention could be covered
by one of four separate detention regimes, depending on the degree of retroactivity
involved.&quot;). Other circuits have noted in light of the Fifth Circuit's
discussion in Zadvydas that there is a question as to which statute applies.
See Sierra v. INS, 258 F.3d 1213, 1216 n.2 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 122
S.Ct. 676 (2001); Duy Dac Ho v.. Greene, 204 F.3d 1045, 1049-50, 1055 &amp;
n.8 (10th Cir. 2000); Chi Thon Ngo, 192 F.3d at 395.</P>

<P>21 The Court in St. Cyr also noted that &quot;[t]he INS' reliance . .
. on INS v. Aguierre-Aguierre, 526 U.S. 415, 420 (1999), is beside the point
because that decision simply observed that the new rules would not apply
to a proceeding filed before IIRIRA's effective date.&quot; St. Cyr, 533
U.S. at 318 n. 42 (emphasis in original). In Aguierre-Aguierre, the Court
had noted in regard to an alien deported prior to IIRIRA's effective date
that &quot;[t]he parties agree IIRIRA does not govern respondent's case,&quot;
and it cited IIRIRA &sect; 309(c). Aguierre-Aguierre, 526 U.S. at 420. We
emphasize that Aguierre-Aguierre involved an alien's challenge to his deportation
proceeding. See id. at 418.</P>

<P>22 At oral argument, the government also argued that we should defer
to its interpretation of IIRIRA &sect; 309(c) pursuant to Chevron U.S.A.,
Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984). At
least one other circuit has invoked Chevron in the context of determining
which statute to assess in an excluded or deported alien's petition for
habeas relief from detention. See Zadvydas, 185 F.3d at 286-87. We, however,
do not believe that Chevron applies in this context. First, the government
has only advocated in litigation the application of pre-IIRIRA law to petitioners
like Rosales and Carballo. An interpretation contained in a brief-like interpretations
contained in opinion letters, policy statements, agency manuals, and enforcement
guidelines-lacks the force of law and is therefore not entitled to Chevron
deference. See Christensen v. Harris County, 529 U.S. 576, 586-87 (2000).
Second, although the government's position is entitled to respect pursuant
to Skidmore v. Swift &amp; Co., 323 U.S. 134, 140 (1944), we conclude that
the government's position has been inconsistent and is therefore unpersuasive.
See Christensen, 529 U.S. at 587.</P>

<P>In a number of other cases in which excluded, deported, or removed aliens
challenged the legality of their continued detention, the government argued
that IIRIRA should apply to alien petitioners who had been excluded or deported
prior to April 1, 1997. See, e.g., Sierra v. INS, 258 F.3d 1213, 1216 n.2
(10th Cir.), cert. denied, 534 U.S. 1071 (2001); Zadvydas, 185 F.3d at 286.
Inasmuch as shifting agency interpretations issued in regulations are accorded
less deference under the highly deferential Chevron standard, see INS v.
Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 446 n.30 (1987), we see no reason why we
should respect shifting agency interpretations expressed in briefs.</P>

<P>23 We note that IIRIRA's removal and detention provisions are substantially
similar to the exclusion and detention provisions in pre-IIRIRA law. 8 U.S.C.
&sect; 1226(e) (1994) provided:</P>

<P>(1) Pending a determination of excludability, the Attorney General shall
take into custody any alien convicted of an aggravated felony upon release
of the alien (regardless of whether or not such release is on parole, supervised
release, or probation, and regardless of the possibility of rearrest or
further confinement in respect of the same offense).</P>

<P>(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the Attorney
General shall not release such felon from custody unless the Attorney General
determines that the alien may not be deported because the condition described
in section 1253(g) (country of citizenship delays in the acceptance of deportees)
of this title exists.</P>

<P>8 U.S.C. &sect; 1226(e) (1994). As the Third Circuit has noted, &quot;[u]nder
the IIRIRA, what was once implicit is now express-the Immigration Act now
specifically provides that the Attorney General shall detain an 'inadmissible'
alien for a 90-day period pending 'removal' from the country, and may continue
to detain him until deportation if he has been found guilty of designated
crimes.&quot; Chi Thon Ngo, 192 F.3d at 394-95.</P>

<P>24 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1231(a)(6) (2000) applies to three groups of removable
aliens: (1) aliens who are &quot;inadmissible under section 1182&quot; (&quot;aliens
who are removable on grounds of inadmissibility&quot;); (2) aliens who are
deportable under &sect;&sect; 1227(a)(1)(C) (violation of nonimmigrant status
or condition of entry), 1227(a)(2) (criminal offenses), and 1227(a)(4) (security
and related grounds) (&quot;aliens who are removable on grounds of deportability&quot;);
and (3) aliens who are &quot;a risk to the community or unlikely to comply
with the order of removal.&quot;</P>

<P>Under IIRIRA, Zadvydas and Kim Ho Ma, the two aliens at issue in Zadvydas,
are removable on grounds of deportability pursuant to 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1227(a)(2)
(2000). Pre-IIRIRA, Zadvydas was classifed as deportable, see Zadvydas,
533 U.S. at 684, and Kim Ho Ma would have been classified as deportable.
Rosales and Carballo, classified as excludable aliens under pre-IIRIRA law,
are removable under IIRIRA on grounds of inadmissibility pursuant to 8 U.S.C.
&sect; 1182(a)(6) (2000).</P>

<P>25 The court in Lin Guo Xi also noted that &quot;[t]he statute, on its
face, makes no exceptions for inadmissible aliens. . . . It is a venerable
principle of statutory interpretation 'that where the Legislature makes
a plain provision, without making any exception, the courts can make none'.&quot;
Lin Guo Xi, 298 F.3d at 836 (quoting French's Lessee v. Spencer, 62 U.S.
(21 How.) 228, 238 (1858)).</P>

<P>26 At least in its regulations, the INS appears to agree with this analysis.
The government argues in the instant cases that the Supreme Court's statutory
construction in Zadvydas should not apply to any inadmissible aliens. However,
after the Court's opinion was issued in Zadvydas, the INS promulgated regulations
limiting the post-removal-period detention both for aliens who are removable
on grounds of deportability and for aliens who are removable on grounds
of inadmissibility, excepting those formerly classified as excludable. 8
C.F.R. &sect; 241.13 (2002).</P>

<P>27 Justice Kennedy also noted in his dissent that:</P>

<P>Accepting the majority's interpretation, then, there are two possibilities,
neither of which is sustainable. On the one hand, it may be that the majority's
rule applies to both categories of aliens, in which case we are asked to
assume that Congress intended to restrict the discretion it could confer
upon the Attorney General so that all inadmissible aliens must be allowed
into our community within six months. On the other hand, the majority's
logic might be that inadmissible and removable aliens can be treated differently.
Yet it is not a plausible construction of &sect; 1231(a)(6) to imply a time
limit as to one class but not another. The text does not admit of this possibility.</P>

<P>Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 710 (Kennedy, J., dissenting).</P>

<P>28 Justice Scalia explained in his dissent in Zadvydas that the traditional
distinction between excludable and deportable aliens developed &quot;with
regard to what procedures are necessary to prevent entry, as opposed to
what procedures are necessary to eject a person already in the United States.&quot;
Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 704 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (emphasis in original);
see also Lynch v. Cannatella, 810 F.2d 1363, 1373 (5th Cir. 1987) (&quot;The
'entry fiction' that excludable aliens are to be treated as if detained
at the border despite their physical presence in the United States determines
the aliens' rights with regard to immigration and deportation proceedings.
It does not limit the right of excludable aliens detained within United
States territory to humane treatment.&quot;) (emphasis added) (footnote
omitted).</P>

<P>29 Although some other circuits have concluded that the detention of
excludable aliens does not violate constitutional due process, no circuit
has concluded that the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments
do not apply to excludable aliens. See, e.g ., Duy Dac Ho, 204 F.3d at 1059
(&quot;[W]hile aliens physically present in the United States are clearly
'persons' afforded some Fifth Amendment rights, they have no constitutional
rights regarding their application for admission.&quot;); Chi Thon Ngo,
192 F.3d at 396 (&quot;Even an excludable alien is a 'person' for purposes
of the Fifth Amendment and is thus entitled to substantive due process.&quot;);
Zadvydas, 185 F.3d at 289 (&quot;The language of the due process clause
refers to 'persons' not 'citizens,' and it is well established that aliens
within the territory of the United States may invoke its provisions. . .
. While the cases have drawn a line for some purposes between excludable
aliens who failed to effect entry into the country unimpeded and resident
aliens, in this Circuit it is clear that the former also can be considered
persons entitled to protection under the 14th Amendment.&quot;); Lynch,
810 F.2d at 1374 (&quot;[W]hatever due process rights excludable aliens
may be denied by virtue of their status, they are entitled under the due
process clauses of the fifth and fourteenth amendments to be free of gross
physical abuse at the hands of state or federal officials.&quot;); see also
Rodriguez-Fernandez v. Wilkinson, 654 F.2d 1382, 1387 (10th Cir. 1981) (construing
the statute in effect at the time not to permit indefinite detention and
stating that &quot;it would appear that an excluded alien in physical custody
within the United States may not be 'punished' without being accorded the
substantive and procedural due process guarantees of the Fifth Amendment.
Surely Congress could not order the killing of Rodriguez-Fernandez. . .
.&quot;) (footnote omitted).</P>

<P>30 The INS's detention of Rosales and Carballo is as potentially permanent
as was the INS's detention of the aliens in Zadvydas. Although Rosales's
and Carballo's detention is governed by the Cuban Review Plan, the Plan,
like the general regulations in effect at the time of the Court's decision
in Zadvydas, does not limit the period of possible post-removal-period detention.
Compare 8 C.F.R. &sect; 241.4 (2001) with 8 C.F.R. &sect; 212.12 (2002).
In fact, under the Cuban Review Plan, post-removal-period detainees may
only be released on parole &quot;for emergent reasons or for reasons deemed
strictly in the public interest.&quot; 8 C.F.R. &sect; 212.12(b)(1). Therefore,
the likelihood that they will be detained indefinitely is much greater.</P>

<P>31 For instance, Rosales's conditions of parole include the following
restrictions, any violation of which &quot;may result in the revocation
of your parole and your return to an appropriate INS detention facility,&quot;
Rosales Supp. J.A. at 4 (Conditions of Parole):</P>

<P>1. You shall not leave the geographic limits fixed by the</P>

<P>I-94 without written permission from the INS District Director. . . .</P>

<P>7. You shall abide by the curfew rules established by the resettlement
program. . . .</P>

<P>11. You shall not have visitors on the premises of the resettlement program
without the permission of the Program Director.</P>

<P>Rosales Supp. J.A. at 4.</P>

<P>32 We note that we believe that the government considerably overstates
the holding of Mezei. In its brief before the district court, the government
described the Court's holding in Mezei as follows: &quot;[The Court] held
that the 'continued exclusion' via detention of an inadmissible alien does
'not * * * deprive[ ] him of any statutory or constitutional right,' even
when custody is prolonged because no other country is willing to accept
the alien.&quot; Gov't Br. re Rosales at 20 (quoting Mezei, 345 U.S. at
208-10, 215-16) (emphasis added). In Mezei, an excludable alien was denied
reentry into the United States at Ellis Island and ordered excluded; because
other countries would not take him in, Mezei was detained on Ellis Island.
After one year of detention, Mezei filed a habeas petition in a federal
district court claiming that his exclusion without a hearing violated his
constitutional rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.
Mezei, 345 U.S. at 207. The Supreme Court held that Mezei, as an excludable
alien, was not entitled to a hearing: &quot;Whatever the procedure authorized
by Congress is, it is due process as far as an alien denied entry is concerned.&quot;
Id. at 212 (quotation omitted) (emphasis added); see also Kim Ho Ma v. Reno,
208 F.3d 815, 823 (9th Cir. 2000), vacated and remanded sub nom. Zadvydas
v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678 (2001) (&quot;In Mezei, the Court relied on the entry
fiction . . . in holding that an excludable alien is not entitled to procedural
due process.&quot;). The Mezei Court then went on to hold that &quot;we
do not think that respondent's continued exclusion deprives him of any statutory
or constitutional right.&quot; Id. at 215 (emphasis added). We believe that
the Court in Mezei, therefore, did not address indefinite or potentially
indefinite detention as a violation of Mezei's substantive due process rights.
Inasmuch as Rosales and Carballo do not challenge their exclusion, we believe
that their cases present a different question. We recognize, however, that
other circuits have not read Mezei in this way. See, e.g., Carrera-Valdez,
211 F.3d at 1048 (stating that the Mezei Court &quot;held that an excludable
alien may be detained indefinitely when his country of origin will not accept
his return&quot;); Kim Ho Ma, 208 F.3d at 823 (&quot;[T]he Court held that
Mezei could be detained indefinitely on Ellis Island.&quot;). Moreover,
the Court in Zadvydas noted that &quot;Mezei, like the present cases, involves
indefinite detention.&quot; Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 693. Therefore, we address
Mezei as &quot;it involves indefinite detention.&quot;</P>

<P>33 According to the Court, Mezei's exclusion &quot;rested on the finding
that [his] entry would be prejudicial to the public interest for security
reasons.&quot; Mezei, 345 U.S. at 208. The Court did not explain the precise
nature of the security threat, but Mezei was decided during the Korean War,
and the Court did specifically note that Mezei &quot;left the United States
and remained behind the Iron Curtain for 19 months.&quot; Id. at 214. In
addition, Justice Jackson in dissent, stated that: &quot;[M]y apprehensions
about the security of our form of government are about equally aroused by
those who refuse to recognize the dangers of Communism and those who will
not see danger in anything else.&quot; Id. at 227 (Jackson, J., dissenting).</P>

<P>34 We note that a possible means of reconciling Mezei and the Salerno
line of cases is to limit Mezei to a decision involving national security
risks. In Salerno, the Court specifically stated that national emergencies
could constitute a special justification that would outweigh an individual's
constitutionally protected liberty interest. See Salerno, 481 U.S. at 748
(&quot;[I]n times of war or insurrection, when society's interest is at
its peak, the Government may detain individuals whom the government believes
to be dangerous.&quot;).</P>

<P>35 We reiterate that in enacting IIRIRA, Congress itself abolished the
distinction between deportable and excludable aliens. See infra [sic] note
1.</P>

<P>1 One of the most perceptive commentators on Mezei argued eloquently
for a more nuanced approach that would elide and break down this rigid distinction,
based on a number of interesting factors. David A. Martin, Graduated Application
of Constitutional Protections for Aliens: The Real Meaning of Zadvydas v.
Davis, 2001 Sup. Ct. Rev. 47. However, at every step of his article he takes
it as a given that the distinction still has vitality, for the time being.</P>

<P>UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS<BR>
FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT<BR>

<P>No. 99-5683</P>

<P>MARIO ROSALES-GARCIA, PETITIONER-APPELLANT</P>

<P>v.</P>

<P>J.T. HOLLAND, WARDEN, RESPONDENT-APPELLEE</P>

<P>Submitted: Aug. 4, 2000<BR>
Decided and Filed: Jan. 31, 2001<BR>
</P>

<P>Before: MOORE and CLAY, Circuit Judges; RICE,<BR>
District Judge.**1<BR>
</P>

<P>MOORE, J., delivered the opinion of the court, in which CLAY, J., joined.
RICE, D.J. (pp. [112a-139a]), delivered a separate dissenting opinion.</P>

<P>OPINION</P>

<P>MOORE, Circuit Judge.</P>

<P>This case presents the difficult and complex question whether an excludable
alien has a liberty interest recognized by the Fifth Amendment's Due Process
Clause when the Immigration and Naturalization Service (&quot;INS&quot;)
seeks to detain him in custody, perhaps indefinitely, without charging him
with a crime or affording him a trial but simply on the ground that it cannot
effect his deportation. On July 9, 1998, Petitioner-Appellant Mario Rosales-Garcia
(&quot;Rosales&quot;) applied for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28
U.S.C. &sect; 2241 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District
of Kentucky. He sought relief from the Attorney General's decision on March
24, 1997 denying him parole from his detention at the Federal Medical Center
in Lexington, Kentucky, or in the alternative, an emergency hearing before
the Cuban Review Panel and the INS. Rosales is a Cuban citizen who arrived
in this country during the Mariel boatlift in 1980. Because he has been
declared excludable by the INS he would ordinarily be deported to his home
country; however, the United States is unable to effect his deportation
because Cuba refuses to accept his return. Thus, Rosales, after completing
a federal prison sentence, has been taken into INS custody pending an agency
determination that he is eligible for parole or that Cuba will allow him
to enter. Rosales, appearing pro se, asserts that both his substantive and
procedural due process rights under the Constitution are being violated
by the Attorney General and the INS. The district court dismissed his petition
with prejudice, and Rosales promptly appealed to this court. We REVERSE
the district court's judgment, order Rosales's release, and REMAND to the
district court for proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</P>

<P>I. Background</P>

<P>A. Facts and Procedure</P>

<P>Rosales left Cuba, his birthplace, and arrived in this country around
May 6, 1980 as part of the Mariel boatlift, so known because over 120,000
undocumented Cubans departed from the Mariel Harbor en route to the United
States. Although Rosales was initially detained by immigration authorities,
he was released into the custody of his aunt on May 20, 1980, pursuant to
the Attorney General's authority to parole illegal aliens for humanitarian
or other reasons under 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1182(d)(5)(A) (1994).1 J.A. at 97-110
(Request for Asylum, Passport). Rosales was subsequently arrested multiple
times2 and was convicted of several of the offenses including: possession
of marijuana and resisting arrest in October 1981, J.A. at 146-47; grand
theft in September 1981, for which he received two years' probation in March
1983, J.A. at 174; burglary and grand larceny in October 1983, for which
he received two six-month sentences to be served concurrently, J.A. at 152-53,
175; and escape from a penal institution in February 1984, J.A. at 177,
where he had been serving time for his previous convictions. On January
9, 1986, Rosales received a sentence of 366 days for the escape charge after
he pleaded guilty. J.A. at 155, 181.</P>

<P>Rosales's immigration parole was revoked on July 10, 1986 by the INS,
pursuant to its authority under 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1185(d)(5)(A) and 8 C.F.R.
&sect; 212.5(d)(2), for the escape and grand larceny charges. J.A. at 111-13.
In a separate proceeding before an immigration judge in Atlanta, Georgia,
on June 26, 1987, Rosales was denied asylum and deemed excludable3 from
this country because he lacked a visa or other documentation entitling him
to admission and because he had been convicted of state crimes in Florida.
J.A. at 115. Rosales remained in immigration custody until he was considered
for immigration parole a second time on April 5, 1988. J.A. at 120. He was
released on May 20, 1988 to the custody of his uncle in Miami. J.A. at 122-25.
Rosales was not deported at that time, however, because Cuba refused to
take him back.</P>

<P>On March 18, 1993, Rosales pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy
to possess with the intent to distribute cocaine in the United States District
Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin; he was sentenced to 63 months
in federal prison, followed by five years of supervised release. J.A. at
159-61. While Rosales was serving his sentence, the INS lodged a detainer
against him, directing prison officials to release him to INS custody for
deportation proceedings at the completion of his sentence. J.A. at 126-27.
On March 24, 1997, prior to his release, Rosales's immigration parole was
again revoked pursuant to the regulations governing parole of Mariel Cubans
at 8 C.F.R. &sect; 212.12 (the &quot;Cuban Review Plan&quot;).4 See 8 C.F.R.
&sect; 212.12(a). When Rosales was released from prison on May 18, 1997,
the INS promptly detained him and took him into custody, pursuant to its
authority under 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1226(e) (1994).5 On November 5, 1997, the
Associate Commissioner for Enforcement for the INS reconsidered and then
denied Rosales immigration parole. J.A. at 133. The INS rendered its decision
on December 12, 1997 and served it on Rosales on February 11, 1998. According
to its report, the Cuban Review Panel determined that Rosales had demonstrated
&quot;a propensity to engage in recidivist criminal behavior&quot; as reflected
by his criminal record and that his responses to questions at his parole
interview were &quot;non-credible.&quot; J.A. at 133. The Panel stated that
&quot;it is not clearly evident&quot; that releasing Rosales on parole was
in the public interest; that he would not pose a threat to the community;
or that he would not violate the conditions of immigration parole.6 J.A.
at 133. Rosales has remained in custody since that determination, where
he continues to receive periodic consideration for parole under the Cuban
Review Plan.7 See 8 C.F.R. &sect; 212.12(g)(2).</P>

<P>Rosales filed his habeas petition with the district court on July 9,
1998. J.A. at 5. In his petition, Rosales asserted that his due process
rights under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments were violated because he
was denied his right to be represented by counsel at the Cuban Review Panel
hearing on his parole status; to review the information used against him
at that proceeding; and the right to confront and cross-examine witnesses.
Rosales also alleged that the Cuban Review Panel improperly assessed his
prior convictions when it calculated his &quot;score&quot; in its assessment
of his candidacy for parole, in violation of the regulations governing the
Review Panel, at 8 C.F.R. &sect;&sect; 212.12-13. Finally, Rosales asserted
that the decision by the INS was an abuse of discretion, arbitrary and capricious,
and that it violated Supreme Court precedent. Rosales sought immediate release
on parole, or in the alternative, an emergency hearing at which he would
be afforded procedural due process rights.</P>

<P>On October 1, 1998, the district court dismissed the habeas petition
sua sponte, concluding that &quot;the petitioner is not being held in violation
of the U.S. Constitution or any U.S. law, rule or regulation; thus, the
petitioner is not entitled to habeas relief.&quot; J.A. at 66, 70. Rosales
then filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment on October 21, 1998,
stating that he meant to assert his due process rights, not under the Constitution,
but under 8 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 1101, 1105(a) and 5 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;
551-701 as well as Supreme Court precedents. J.A. at 13. The district court,
construing pro se petitions leniently, vacated its earlier decision to dismiss
and granted Rosales's motion for reconsideration on December 1, 1998, allowing
the case to proceed. J.A. at 71-73.</P>

<P>The government filed a response to Rosales's petition on February 4,
1999, arguing that this case is identical to those that have been rejected
by other circuits, including the Sixth Circuit in an unpublished opinion,
Gonzalez v. Luttrell, No. 96-5098, 1996 WL 627717 (6th Cir. Oct. 29, 1996).
The government noted that Rosales had received all the procedure due under
the Cuban Review Plan and that his parole had been appropriately denied
by the Attorney General. Rosales responded to the government by again asserting
his right to be free from indefinite detention and to be afforded procedural
due process rights at his parole hearings. J.A. at 58-65. Rosales also sought
the appointment of counsel through a motion to the district court, but that
request was denied on February 23, 1999. J.A. at 75.</P>

<P>The district court dismissed Rosales's amended petition with prejudice
on May 3, 1999. The district court, addressing Rosales's statutory claims
first, concluded that Congress had granted total discretionary authority
to the Attorney General over immigration matters at 8 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;
1103(a)(1)8 and 1182(d)(5)(A). After surveying the recent amendments to
the immigration laws and noting Congress's intent to provide the Attorney
General with more discretion to detain aliens, the district court concluded
that &quot;the Attorney General may continue to detain the instant petitioner
in conformity with federal law.&quot; J.A. at 88-89 (D. Ct. Op.)</P>

<P>The district court also concluded that Rosales had failed to state a
cognizable constitutional claim. The court determined that the Sixth Amendment
is not applicable to Rosales's petition &quot;because 'immigration proceedings
and detention do not constitute criminal proceedings or punishment.'&quot;
J.A. at 89 (internal citations omitted). The court next found that the Fifth
Amendment does not &quot;provide excludable aliens with procedural due process
rights with regard to admission or parole.&quot; J.A. at 89. Thus, the court
concluded that Rosales was not due any of the procedures which he sought,
namely the right to counsel, to review the information used against him,
or to confront and cross-examine people who provided information at his
parole hearing. Although the district court noted that &quot;the law is
less clear about the extent to which any substantive due process rights
are enjoyed by excludable aliens,&quot; the court denied Rosales the benefit
of the protection of the substantive component of the Fifth Amendment as
well. J.A. at 90. The district court observed that Rosales &quot;has no
fundamental right to be free to roam the United States and a fundamental
right is the first component of a substantive due process claim.&quot; J.A.
at 91. The court also found that Rosales's continued detention was &quot;neither
arbitrary, conscience-shocking nor oppressive in the constitutional sense.&quot;
J.A. at 91. Rosales then filed a prompt notice of appeal to this court.
J.A. at 95.</P>

<P>In his four-page pro se brief to this court, Rosales does not challenge
the Attorney General's right to exclude him. Rather, Rosales argues that
he should be granted procedural due process rights during his parole revocation
hearing and that his substantive due process rights are being violated by
the indefinite nature of his detention. In response to the district court's
assertion that an excludable alien is not free to &quot;roam&quot; this
country, Rosales asserts that he &quot;is not asking for permission to 'roam'
the United States.&quot; Instead, he claims that he would return to Cuba
and that &quot;[i]f he was not part of this 'Catch 22', where he is not
allowed to return to his country, he [would] gladly do so.&quot; Appellant's
Br. at 3.</P>

<P>B. Relations With Cuba</P>

<P>A brief background on the United States' relationship with Cuba is essential
to our analysis. Most of the 125,000 Cuban refugees who came to this country
in 1980 in the Mariel boatlift were found excludable because they arrived
here without proper entry documents or because they had committed crimes
in Cuba. However, a large percentage of these Cubans, including Rosales,
were paroled, pursuant to the Attorney General's authority under 8 U.S.C.
&sect; 1182(d)(5). According to the affidavit of Michael E. Ranneberger,
the Coordinator of the Office of Cuban Affairs in the State Department,
who has been responsible for negotiations with Cuba since 1995, &quot;[f]or
almost two decades, the United States has been discussing with Cuban authorities
the issue of return of excludable Cubans.&quot; J.A. at 56. The United States
reached a limited agreement with Cuba to repatriate Mariel Cubans in December
1984. Under the terms of this agreement, Cuba consented to the return of
2,746 excludable aliens from the Mariel Boatlift, at the rate of 100 per
month, whom the INS was able to identify at the time the agreement was reached.
J.A. at 56 (Ranneberger Decl.); 81 (D.Ct.Op.). Rosales was not among those
named in the 1984 Agreement because he was not declared excludable until
1987. Cuba suspended the agreement in May 1985, but agreed to reinstate
the agreement in November 1987. See Gisbert v. U.S. Attorney Gen., 988 F.2d
1437, 1440 (5th Cir. 1993). As of January 1999, 1400 Cubans had been returned
to Cuba. J.A. at 56 (Ranneberger Decl.).</P>

<P>Further talks between the two countries took place on September 9, 1994
and May 2, 1995. J.A. at 57 (Ranneberger Decl.). The September 1994 agreement
stated that the United States and Cuba &quot;agreed to continue to discuss
the return of Cuban nationals excludable from the United States.&quot; J.A.
at 57. Ranneberger noted that discussions between the two countries continued
periodically, and while he cannot offer details from these sensitive discussions,
he says that he &quot;can confirm that the return of Cuban nationals . .
. remains under discussion between the two governments.&quot; J.A. at 57.</P>

<P>The United States is currently detaining approximately 1,750 Mariel Cubans
in U.S. prison facilities who are neither eligible for parole nor deportable
because Cuba will not accept them. See Chi Thon Ngo v. INS, 192 F.3d 390,
395 (3d Cir. 1999). According to the government, the United States' position
has been and currently is that Cuba is required to take back all of its
nationals who are denied admission to the United States. Appellee's Br.
at 19.</P>

<P>II. Jurisdiction</P>

<P>The government challenged the district court's jurisdiction to hear Rosales's
28 U.S.C. &sect; 2241 habeas petition based on 8 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 1252(g)9
and 1231(h)10, as well as &sect; 1226(e)11 and conflicting case law. The
district court determined that, in light of this court's decision in Mansour
v. INS, 123 F.3d 423, 426 (6th Cir. 1997), and the absence of further clarification
from this court or the Supreme Court, it had jurisdiction to hear the petition.12
The government appears to have conceded this court's jurisdiction to hear
the instant appeal. Appellee's Br. at 2 (stating that the court of appeals'
jurisdiction arises under 28 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 1291 and 2253). However,
it is our obligation to address the predicate question of our jurisdiction,
even when it is not contested, before turning to the merits of these appeals.
See Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona, 520 U.S. 43, 73, 117 S. Ct.
1055, 137 L.Ed.2d 170 (1997).</P>

<P>The Supreme Court's recent decision in Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination
Committee (&quot;AADC&quot;), 525 U.S. 471, 119 S. Ct. 936, 142 L. Ed. 2d
940 (1999), makes clear that the district court was correct to assert jurisdiction
over Rosales's habeas petition; it also establishes the propriety of our
jurisdiction to hear Rosales's claim. In AADC, the Supreme Court addressed
the scope of 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1252(g) and its ostensibly sweeping jurisdiction-stripping
language.13 Forced to reconcile the incongruity of several provisions of
the IIRIRA which simultaneously grant and deny the right of judicial review
to certain aliens who were in deportation proceedings before April 1, 1997,
the Supreme Court determined that &sect; 1252(g) must have a &quot;narrow[
]&quot; meaning.14 See AADC, 525 U.S. at 482, 119 S. Ct. 936. Rejecting
the idea that &sect; 1252(g) &quot;covers the universe of deportation claims-that
it is a sort of 'zipper' clause that says 'no judicial review in deportation
cases unless this section provides judicial review,'&quot; the Supreme Court
restricted &sect; 1252(g) to three discrete actions that the Attorney General
may take: the decision to &quot;commence proceedings, adjudicate cases,
or execute removal orders.&quot; Id. The Court noted that &quot;[t]here
are of course many other decisions or actions that may be part of the deportation
process. . . .&quot; Id.</P>

<P>In Zhislin v. Reno, 195 F.3d 810 (6th Cir. 1999), we applied the Supreme
Court's reasoning in AADC and concluded that &sect; 1252(g) did not preclude
our review of an alien's petition for habeas corpus challenging the INS's
authority to detain him indefinitely. See Zhislin, 195 F.3d at 814. Like
Zhislin, Rosales does not seek to review the Attorney General's decision
to commence or adjudicate a case, nor does he dispute the removal order
entered against him. Instead, Rosales challenges &quot;the right of the
Attorney General to detain him indefinitely when it appears that circumstances
beyond anyone's control will prevent the deportation order from ever being
executed.&quot; Id. Such a challenge is clearly outside the purview of &sect;
1252(g) and we may therefore consider the claim. See Zhislin, 195 F.3d at
814; Carrera-Valdez v. Perryman, 211 F.3d 1046, 1047 (7th Cir. 2000) (upholding
district court's jurisdiction over Mariel Cuban's petition for release from
indefinite detention); Ho v. Greene, 204 F.3d 1045, 1051 (10th Cir. 2000);
Ma v. Reno, 208 F.3d 815, 818 n.3 (9th Cir. 2000), cert. granted, - U.S.

<P>III. Mootness</P>

<P>After this appeal was submitted to this panel, the government informed
the panel that on July 19, 2000, the INS determined that Rosales is releasable
under the custody review procedures of 8 C.F.R. &sect; 212.12. In its Notice
of Releasability, the INS conditioned Rosales's release on efforts to find
him a suitable sponsorship or placement, namely a halfway house, as required
by the Cuban Review Plan at 8 C.F.R. &sect; 212.12(f) (&quot;No detainee
may be released on parole until suitable sponsorship or placement has been
found for the detainee.&quot;). The Notice further stated that Rosales's
release from custody is conditioned on his maintaining proper behavior while
sponsorship and placement efforts are undertaken and that &quot;[f]ailure
to maintain good behavior could result in [ ] continued detention.&quot;
Because the INS has not provided any further information indicating that
such a sponsorship or placement has been found or that Rosales has been
released on parole, we must assume that he is still in custody at the Federal
Medical Center in Lexington, Kentucky.</P>

<P>The government argues that Picrin-Peron v. Rison, 930 F.2d 773, 776 (9th
Cir. 1991), stands for the proposition that the INS's notice of releasability
moots Rosales's appeal. In Picrin-Peron, the Ninth Circuit considered a
detainee's appeal from the denial of his habeas corpus petition after the
detainee had been released on parole for one year. Pursuant to the court's
request, an INS official authored an affidavit for the court declaring that
&quot;absent Picrin's reinvolvement with the criminal justice system, a
change in the Cuban government enabling him to return to Cuba, or the willingness
of a third country to accept him, he will be paroled for another year.&quot;
Picrin-Peron, 930 F.2d at 776. Based on this sworn statement, the Ninth
Circuit dismissed Picrin's petition as moot, concluding that the court could
offer the detainee no further relief. See id.</P>

<P>According to Article III of the Constitution, this court only possesses
jurisdiction over actual cases and controversies that will the affect the
rights of the litigants. See McPherson v. Michigan High Sch. Athletic Ass'n,
Inc., 119 F.3d 453, 458 (6th Cir. 1997) (en banc). A case is deemed moot
if the relief sought would make no difference to the legal interests of
the parties. See id. We are obligated to consider whether the &quot;case
or controversy&quot; justiciability requirement has been met in this case
because it must be satisfied at all stages of review, not just upon initiation
of a legal action. See id. Rosales's petition seeks either release from
custody or a hearing before the Cuban Review Panel with certain procedural
protections that he believes were denied to him in error. As a preliminary
step in our analysis, we note that Rosales appears to remain in federal
custody, as his parole is conditioned on the INS's ability to find him a
suitable halfway house as well as on his continued good behavior. We also
note that, according to 8 C.F.R. &sect; 212.12(e), &quot;[t]he Associate
Commissioner for Enforcement may, in his or her discretion, withdraw approval
for parole of any detainee prior to release when, in his or her opinion,
the conduct of the detainee, or any other circumstance, indicates that parole
would no longer be appropriate.&quot; Should the INS decide, in its discretion,
to withdraw his parole or should it be unable to find him a suitable placement,
Rosales will therefore continue to be detained in federal custody. Thus,
this case is not like Picrin-Peron, in which petitioner had already been
released from detention and the INS verified in a sworn affidavit that he
would continue to be granted yearly parole absent his involvement in any
criminal activity. Moreover, if Rosales is not released, the same procedures
that he asserts are constitutionally defective will continue to be used
against him. Based on these circumstances, we conclude that Rosales's petition
for relief is not rendered moot by virtue of the fact that he has been notified
that he is releasable. This case clearly represents a substantial ongoing
controversy between the parties, for which this court can offer relief.</P>

<P>Moreover, we believe that, should Rosales be physically released, this
case may also be adjudicated under the well-established exception to the
mootness doctrine for controversies capable of repetition yet evading review.
See Grider v. Abramson, 180 F.3d 739, 746 (6th Cir. 1999); Pinette v. Capitol
Square Review &amp; Advisory Bd., 30 F.3d 675, 677 (6th Cir. 1994); aff'd,
515 U.S. 753, 115 S. Ct. 2440, 132 L. Ed. 2d 650 (1995). Two criteria must
be satisfied for a claim to fall under this exception to the mootness doctrine.
First, the complaining party must show that the duration of the dispute
is too short to be litigated fully prior to the cessation or expiration
of the action. Second, the complaining party must show that there is a reasonable
expectation that it will be subjected to the same action again. See Suster
v. Marshall, 149 F.3d 523, 527 (6th Cir. 1998). The Cuban Review Plan confers
on the Cuban Review Panel and the Associate Commissioner for Enforcement
substantial discretion to withdraw parole approval prior to release and
to revoke a detainee's parole once he is out of custody. See 8 C.F.R. &sect;
212.12(e), (h).15 While the Plan provides yearly review for detainees who
have been refused parole, see id. at &sect; 212.12(g)(2), the Cuban Review
Plan Director may schedule a review of the detainee's status &quot;at any
time when the Director deems such a review to be warranted.&quot; See id.
at &sect; 212.12(g)(3). Due to the discretionary nature of these regulations,
the Associate Commissioner for Enforcement or the Cuban Review Panel may
grant parole, withdraw parole approval or revoke Rosales's parole repeatedly
within a time period too short to effect appellate review of a habeas corpus
petition. We have every reason to believe that future review of another
habeas petition filed by Rosales will take at least as long as the instant
case in arriving at this court. Moreover, should the INS and its officials
engage in repeated denials, revocations or withdrawals of parole, the regulations
make clear that Rosales will face the same detention and hearing procedures
that he challenges in his current petition. Because Rosales's situation
is capable of repetition yet evading review, we conclude that his appeal
is not moot.</P>

<P>IV. Standard of Review</P>

<P>This court reviews a district court's dismissal of a habeas corpus petition
de novo. See Rogers v. Howes, 144 F.3d 990, 992 (6th Cir. 1998).</P>

<P>V. Analysis</P>

<P>This circuit has not ruled definitely on the constitutionality of indefinite
detention of excludable aliens.16 In its brief to this court, the government
frames the question before us as whether Rosales has a protected statutory
or constitutional entitlement to immigration parole. The larger question,
however, is whether the executive branch of the government has the authority
under the United States Constitution to detain a person indefinitely without
charging him with a crime or affording him a trial. We hold that indefinite
detention of Mario Rosales-Garcia cannot be justified by reference to the
government's plenary power over immigration matters and that it violates
Rosales's substantive due process rights under the Due Process Clause of
the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution.</P>

<P>A. Statutory Authority to Detain Indefinitely</P>

<P>Our first point of analysis is Rosales's statutory claim that the Attorney
General and the INS violated their governing statutes and regulations by
denying him parole and detaining him indefinitely. See Reno v. Flores, 507
U.S. 292, 300, 113 S. Ct. 1439, 123 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1993) (noting reviewing
court's obligation to construe statutes to avoid constitutional problems
unless such construction is plainly contrary to Congress's intent). The
government argues that we are bound by former 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1226(e) (1994),
which, according to the government, authorizes the Attorney General to continue
to detain Rosales indefinitely. According to IIRIRA, its permanent provisions
apply only to removal proceedings commenced after April 1, 1997, IIRIRA's
effective date. See IIRIRA &sect; 309(c)(1). We agree with the government
that we must apply former &sect; 1226(e) to the instant case because Rosales
was declared excludable in 1987 and his immigration parole was last revoked
on March 24, 1997, prior to the Act's effective date.17 Cf. INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre,
526 U.S. 415, 424, 119 S. Ct. 1439, 143 L. Ed. 2d 590 (1999) (counseling
that courts of appeals must apply Chevron deference to agency's interpretations
of immigration statute).</P>

<P>According to former &sect; 1226(e), pending a determination of excludability,
the Attorney General must take into custody any alien convicted of an aggravated
felony18 upon release of the alien. See &sect; 1226(e)(1) (1994); see also
8 U.S.C. &sect; 1182(d)(5)(A) (1994) (giving the Attorney General the right
to return into custody an excludable alien when &quot;the purposes of such
parole shall . . . have been served&quot;); &sect; 1227(a) (1994) (authorizing
Attorney General immediately to deport any alien who is excludable unless
she decides, in her discretion, &quot;that immediate deportation is not
practicable or proper&quot;). Under the former statute, the Attorney General
may not release the alien from custody unless she determines that the alien
may not be deported because the alien's home country denies or unduly delays
acceptance of the alien's return. See &sect; 1226(e)(2) (incorporating 8
U.S.C. &sect; 1253(g) (1994)). If this determination is made, the Attorney
General may release the alien only after a review in which the severity
of the felony committed by the alien is considered and the review concludes
that the alien will not pose a danger to the safety of other persons or
to property. See &sect; 1226(e)(3). Many circuits, including the Second,
Third, Fifth, Seventh, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits have found former &sect;
1226(e) to authorize the Attorney General to detain indefinitely an excludable
alien who has been convicted of an aggravated offense. See Ho v. Greene,
204 F.3d 1045, 1055 (10th Cir. 2000) (Attorney General has authority to
continue indefinitely to detain excludable alien whose deportation cannot
be accomplished expeditiously because the &quot;statute is framed not as
a grant of authority to detain the alien, but as a limitation on the Attorney
General's power to release the alien from detention&quot;); Carrera-Valdez
v. Perryman, 211 F.3d 1046, 1048 (7th Cir. 2000); Chi Thon Ngo v. INS, 192
F.3d 390, 394 (3d Cir. 1999) (statute permits prolonged detention of excludable
aggravated felons); Gisbert v. U.S. Attorney Gen., 988 F.2d 1437, 1446 (5th
Cir 1993) (&quot;[W]e do not regard section 1226(e) as a limitation on the
Attorney General's authority to detain excludable aliens, either before
or after final determination of excludability, pending their removal from
this country.&quot;); Alvarez-Mendez v. Stock, 941 F.2d 956, 962 (9th Cir.
1991) (&quot;The only logical interpretation of section 1226(e) is that
it . . . provides that where deportation of an alien found excludable cannot
be immediate, the Attorney General may release [the alien] only if doing
so will not endanger society.&quot;).</P>

<P>Former &sect; 1226(e) is not ambiguous concerning the Attorney General's
discretion to detain indefinitely an excludable alien whose deportation
cannot be expeditiously accomplished. The statute explicitly states that
the Attorney General &quot;shall&quot; not release an alien from custody
unless she determines that the alien will not pose a danger to the safety
of other persons or to property. The statute does not contain any language
limiting the length of time the Attorney General may detain an alien pending
a determination that the alien no longer poses a threat to society. Nor
does the statute carve an exception to this language for aliens whose home
countries refuse to accept their return. We therefore conclude, in accordance
with the other circuits that have analyzed this issue, that the statute
clearly authorizes the Attorney General to detain an excludable alien indefinitely.
Because we cannot construe the statute to avoid constitutional inquiry,
we must now address the constitutionality of Rosales's detention.</P>

<P>B. The Immigration Statute and the Plenary</P>

<P>Power Doctrine</P>

<P>In this case, we are confronted with two principles deeply embedded in
our jurisprudence that conflict with each other: the political branches'
almost complete authority over immigration matters and a person's inalienable
right to liberty absent charges or conviction of a crime. Rosales's petition
for habeas corpus relief does not contest the government's almost complete
control over matters of immigration policy. Under Art. I, &sect; 8, cl.
4 of the Constitution19 and the plenary power doctrine,20 the executive
and legislative branches have coordinate authority to establish and enforce
policies for admission to and exclusion from this country, while the judiciary
accords those branches almost total deference. See Mathews v. Diaz, 426
U.S. 67, 81, 96 S. Ct. 1883, 48 L. Ed. 2d 478 (1976) (&quot;[T]he responsibility
for regulating the relationship between the United States and our alien
visitors has been committed to the political branches of the Federal Government&quot;);
United States ex rel. Knauff v. Shaughnessy, 338 U.S. 537, 542, 70 S. Ct.
309, 94 L.Ed. 317 (1950) (authority over immigration matters stems not just
from legislative power &quot;but is inherent in the executive power to control
the foreign affairs of the nation.&quot;); Fong Yue Ting v. United States,
149 U.S. 698, 711, 13 S. Ct. 1016, 37 L.Ed. 905 (1893) (it is the &quot;right
to exclude or to expel all aliens, or any class of aliens, absolutely or
upon certain conditions, in war or in peace, being an inherent and inalienable
right of every sovereign and independent nation, essential to its safety,
its independence, and its welfare. . . .&quot;). Under this doctrine, the
Attorney General is charged with the administration and enforcement of all
laws relating to the immigration and naturalization of aliens, and she does
so with virtually no interference from the courts.21 The Supreme Court has
&quot;long recognized the power to expel or exclude aliens as a fundamental
sovereign attribute exercised by the Government's political departments
largely immune from judicial control.&quot; Shaughnessy v. United States
ex rel. Mezei, 345 U.S. 206, 210, 73 S. Ct. 625, 97 L.Ed. 956 (1953); see
also Diaz, 426 U.S. at 82, 96 S. Ct. 1883 (noting &quot;narrow standard
of review of decisions made by the Congress or the President in the area
of immigration and naturalization&quot;).</P>

<P>Nor does Rosales contest the government's right to designate him an excludable
alien and attempt to remove him from this country. The principle that there
is no constitutional right to enter this country, see Knauff, 338 U.S. at
542, 70 S. Ct. 309, is not under review in this case. The Supreme Court
has made clear that an attempt to enter this country is considered a request
for a privilege rather than an assertion of right, because &quot;the power
to admit or exclude aliens is a sovereign prerogative.&quot; See Landon
v. Plasencia, 459 U.S. 21, 32, 103 S. Ct. 321, 74 L. Ed. 2d 21 (1982). According
to the Supreme Court, such a privilege can only be exercised according to
the procedures established by Congress and implemented by the appropriate
executive officials. See Knauff, 338 U.S. at 542-44, 70 S. Ct. 309.</P>

<P>Finally, Rosales does not challenge the government's application of the
&quot;entry fiction&quot; to his case. Under the former version of the immigration
act the government had two mechanisms for returning non-citizens to their
country of origin: &quot;exclusion&quot; was the procedure used to refuse
an alien entry at the border of this country; &quot;deportation&quot; was
the procedure used to remove an alien who has already entered the country
but is here illegally. See Plasencia, 459 U.S. at 25-26, 103 S. Ct. 321.
Although exclusion proceedings usually occurred at the port of entry, the
Supreme Court developed what has become known as the &quot;entry fiction&quot;
to govern the rights of those aliens who are deemed excludable but who have
nonetheless been allowed to enter physically the United States for humanitarian,
administrative, or other reasons, under 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1182(d)(5)(A). Under
the entry fiction, an alien deemed to have entered this country illegally
is treated as if detained or &quot;excluded&quot; at the border despite
his physical presence in the United States. See Gisbert, 988 F.2d at 1440
(explaining distinction between excludable and deportable aliens). Excludable
aliens have no rights with regard to their entry or exclusion from this
country and they are treated differently from those who have &quot;passed
through our gates.&quot; Mezei, 345 U.S. at 212, 73 S. Ct. 625; but see
Plasencia, 459 U.S. at 32-34, 103 S. Ct. 321 (resident alien detained at
border upon return to country is validly subject to exclusion proceeding
but may invoke procedural due process protections during proceedings); Kwong
Hai Chew v. Colding, 344 U.S. 590, 597-600, 73 S. Ct. 472, 97 L.Ed. 576
(1953) (resident alien returning to U.S. after five-month absence is subject
to exclusion hearing but is entitled to procedural due process protections).
According to the Supreme Court, they are due only the procedures authorized
by Congress for their removal proceedings and nothing more. See Mezei, 345
U.S. at 212, 73 S. Ct. 625 (citing Knauff, 338 U.S. at 544, 70 S. Ct. 309);
compare Zadvydas, 185 F.3d at 295-97 (extending entry fiction to deportable
aliens who have received final order of deportation and stripping them of
due process right to be free from indefinite detention) and Ho, 204 F.3d
at 1059-60 (same) with Ma, 208 F.3d at 825-26 n.23 (rejecting INS's argument
that aliens ordered deportable are on same constitutional footing as excludable
aliens seeking entry).</P>

<P>Rosales does, however, challenge the government's authority to detain
him indefinitely after he has completed his federal prison sentence and
has neither been charged with nor convicted of another crime. It is to this
challenge that we now turn our attention.</P>

<P>C. Constitutional Authority to Detain Indefinitely</P>

<P>The Fifth Amendment to the Constitution restricts the government from
depriving all persons of the right to life, liberty, or property without
due process of law. See U.S. CONST. amend. V. The Supreme Court has consistently
held that aliens physically present in this country are not wholly without
constitutional protection. Indeed, the Supreme Court has accorded aliens
a panoply of Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights. Should an excludable
alien be accused of committing a crime, he would be entitled to the constitutional
protections of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. See Wong Wing v. United States,
163 U.S. 228, 238, 16 S. Ct. 977, 41 L.Ed. 140 (1896) (&quot;[I]t must be
concluded that all persons within the territory of the United States are
entitled to the protection guaranteed by [the fifth and sixth] amendments,
and that even aliens shall not be held to answer for a capital or other
infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury, nor
be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.&quot;).
Thus, in Wong Wing v. United States, the Court struck down a federal statute
imposing a maximum of one year of hard labor on a Chinese alien upon a determination
of his deportability, finding it a violation of the alien's due process
right to be free from punishment without trial. In Yick Wo v. Hopkins, another
early immigration case, the Supreme Court announced that the Fourteenth
Amendment's protections extend to aliens as well:</P>

<P>The Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution is not confined to the protection
of citizens. It says: &quot;Nor shall any State deprive any person of life,
liberty, or property without due process of law; nor deny to any person
within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.&quot; These provisions
are universal in their application, to all persons within the territorial
jurisdiction, without regard to any differences of race, of color, or of
nationality; and the equal protection of the laws is a pledge of the protection
of equal laws.</P>

<P>Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356, 369, 6 S. Ct. 1064, 30 L.Ed. 220 (1886)
(finding imprisonment of Chinese immigrants under state statute unconstitutional
because it violated Equal Protection Clause of Fourteenth Amendment); see
also Flores, 507 U.S. at 315-16, 113 S. Ct. 1439 (O'Connor, J., concurring)
(emphasizing that juvenile aliens have a constitutionally protected liberty
interest, rooted in the Due Process Clause, in freedom from institutional
confinement); Diaz, 426 U.S. at 77, 96 S. Ct. 1883 (noting that there are
millions of aliens in this country and that &quot;[t]he Fifth Amendment,
as well as the Fourteenth Amendment, protects every one of these [aliens]
from deprivation of life, liberty, or property without due process of law&quot;
whether they are here unlawfully or not).</P>

<P>As the Supreme Court has evaluated whether to extend entitlements or
rights to aliens in addition to those protected by the Fifth, Sixth, and
Fourteenth Amendments, the Court has demonstrated a willingness to draw
lines between the rights due to citizens and those due to aliens. See Diaz,
426 U.S. at 80, 96 S. Ct. 1883 (noting that &quot;Congress regularly makes
rules that would be unacceptable if applied to citizens&quot;). The Court
has also expressed its willingness to distinguish among different classifications
of aliens. However, it has never held that aliens are utterly beyond the
purview of the Constitution. Thus, in Diaz, the Court held that Congress
may constitutionally condition an alien's receipt of federal medical insurance
benefits (Medicare Part B) on the legality of his entry and the length of
his residence in this country. See Diaz, 426 U.S. at 82-83, 96 S. Ct. 1883.
However, in Graham v. Richardson, 403 U.S. 365, 374, 91 S. Ct. 1848, 29
L. Ed. 2d 534 (1971), the Court held that state statutes conditioning welfare
benefits on a residency requirement or denying welfare benefits to resident
aliens violated the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. The
Supreme Court has also determined that the exclusion of the children of
illegal aliens from a public school system pursuant to a state statute violated
the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Rejecting the government's
argument that illegal aliens are not &quot;persons&quot; within the purview
of the Constitution, the Court stated that &quot;[w]hatever his status under
the immigration laws, an alien is surely a 'person' in any ordinary sense
of that term. Aliens, even aliens whose presence in this country is unlawful,
have long been recognized as 'persons' guaranteed due process of law by
the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.&quot; Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202,
210, 102 S. Ct. 2382, 72 L. Ed. 2d 786 (1982).</P>

<P>The government, relying on the Supreme Court's decision in Shaughnessy
v. United States ex rel. Mezei, 345 U.S. 206, 73 S. Ct. 625, 97 L. Ed. 956
(1953), asks this court to conclude, despite a long line of Supreme Court
decisions extending to aliens basic Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendment
protections, that excludable aliens have no cognizable Fifth Amendment liberty
interest under the Constitution in freedom from indefinite incarceration.
In Mezei, the Supreme Court reviewed the case of an excludable alien who
was being detained indefinitely on Ellis Island because this country deemed
him a security threat and the alien's home country, as well as other nations,
refused to allow him to return.22 When the case reached the Supreme Court
in 1953, Mezei had been detained on Ellis Island for close to two years.
Addressing the question whether the potentially indefinite detention of
an excludable alien without a hearing violated the Constitution, the Supreme
Court observed that &quot;[c]ourts have long recognized the power to expel
or exclude aliens as a fundamental sovereign attribute exercised by the
Government's political departments largely immune from judicial control.&quot;
Mezei, 345 U.S. at 210, 73 S. Ct. 625. The Court then deferred to the executive's
authority to &quot;impose additional restrictions on aliens entering or
leaving the United States during periods of international tension and strife.&quot;
Id. Noting the existence of a presidentially-declared state of emergency,
the Supreme Court found that the Attorney General's authority to act derived
from the Passport Act of 1918, which permitted the executive to &quot;shut
out aliens whose 'entry would be prejudicial to the interest of the United
States'&quot; during periods of national emergency.23 Id. at 210-11, 73
S. Ct. 625 (citing regulations at 8 C.F.R. &sect; 175.53 promulgated in
accordance with the amendments to the Passport Act). The Supreme Court decided
that &quot;the times being what they are&quot; it would not question the
Attorney General's discretion to detain Mezei at Ellis Island in deference
to his assessment that Mezei presented a security threat. Id. at 216, 73
S. Ct. 625. Deeming this case &quot;[a]n exclusion proceeding grounded on
danger to the national security,&quot; id., the Court refused to substitute
its judgment for the legislative will. Thus, it found no statutory or constitutional
impediment to Mezei's detention or denial of a hearing. See id. at 215,
73 S. Ct. 625.</P>

<P>The government would have this court accept the premise that the entry
fiction completely forecloses any need for this court to examine whether
an excludable alien, faced with the prospect of indefinite detention imposed
by an executive agency, possesses a Fifth Amendment interest in liberty
from physical constraint. We do not disagree that the entry fiction is an
important doctrinal principle that the Supreme Court has employed to uphold
this country's immigration laws and regulations, most notably our sovereign
right to determine who may enter our borders, and our concomitant policy
not to let other nations determine whom we must accept or reject by virtue
of their refusal to repatriate their own citizens. However, crucial to our
understanding and application of the Mezei decision are the circumstances
in which the case was decided: the opinion was authored in the midst of
the Korean War, as our nation labored under a fear of Communist infiltration24
and in a state of affairs defined as a national emergency.25 Courts have
always allowed the executive an extraordinary amount of leniency during
wartime or when the national security is truly at stake.26 Such incomparable
exigencies are clearly not present in the instant case. We are not operating
in a declared state of emergency nor has there been any suggestion to this
court that Rosales poses a threat to our national security.</P>

<P>Moreover, while the government argues for absolute judicial deference
to its plenary power over immigration policies, it is clear to this court
that Congress may not authorize immigration officials to treat excludable
aliens with complete impunity. For example, the INS may not, consistent
with the Constitution, execute an excludable alien should it be unable to
effect his prompt deportation. It is also evident that Congress cannot authorize
the infliction of physical torture upon an excludable alien while he is
detained in federal prison. See Gisbert, 988 F.2d at 1442; Lynch v. Cannatella,
810 F.2d 1363, 1374 (5th Cir. 1987) (excludable aliens &quot;are entitled
under the due process clauses of the fifth and fourteenth amendments to
be free of gross physical abuse at the hands of state or federal officials&quot;).
Consequently, we emphatically reject the government's premise that excludable
aliens are completely foreign to the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution.27
We therefore find ourselves asked to draw a line of constitutional dimension
between the act of torturing an excludable alien and the act of imprisoning
such an alien indefinitely. We do not believe that the Constitution authorizes
us to draw such a line. While it is true that aliens are not entitled to
enjoy all the advantages of citizenship, see Diaz, 426 U.S. at 78, 96 S.
Ct. 1883, we emphasize that aliens-even excludable aliens-are &quot;persons&quot;
entitled to the Constitution's most basic protections and strictures. We
conclude that if Rosales is indeed being detained indefinitely, discussed
infra, his Fifth Amendment interest in liberty is necessarily implicated.</P>

<P>D. Rosales's Fifth Amendment Right to Liberty</P>

<P>The right to be free from bodily restraint, the right at issue in this
case, is not a new liberty interest, but is at the heart of those interests
protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and available
to all persons within our shores.28 Rosales asserts that his continuing
confinement without trial violates his substantive due process rights under
the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution. He also argues that his procedural
due process rights have been violated because he was not afforded certain
procedural protections during his parole revocation hearing with the Cuban
Review Panel. In response, the government urges that &quot;it is undisputed
that an alien who has been denied admission to the United States has no
liberty interest that would entitle him to be at-large within our borders
even temporarily.&quot; Appellee's Br. at 25. According to the government,
once an alien has been found excludable his detention is a mere continuation
of the exclusion that has been authorized by Congress. Because detention
serves only to effectuate the exclusion order, there can be no limit on
its length, other than a statutory limit, which Congress has not chosen
to provide. See 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1226(e) (1994).</P>

<P>The Due Process Clause is comprised of two components, one substantive
and the other procedural. Substantive due process precludes &quot;the government
from engaging in conduct that 'shocks the conscience' or interferes with
rights 'implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.'&quot; See United States
v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 746, 107 S. Ct. 2095, 95 L. Ed. 2d 697 (1987)
(citing Rochin v. California, 342 U.S. 165, 172, 72 S. Ct. 205, 96 L. Ed.
183 (1952); Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U.S. 319, 325-26, 58 S. Ct. 149, 82
L. Ed. 288 (1937)). Indeed, &quot;[f]reedom from bodily restraint has always
been at the core of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause from
arbitrary governmental action.&quot; Foucha v. Louisiana, 504 U.S. 71, 80,
112 S. Ct. 1780, 118 L. Ed. 2d 437 (1992).</P>

<P>We construe Rosales's petition for habeas corpus relief to challenge
his detention as impermissible punishment in the absence of a trial. The
deprivation of a fundamental liberty interest comports with due process
only if it is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest.
See Flores, 507 U.S. at 302, 113 S. Ct. 1439. According to Salerno, in order
to determine whether Rosales's detention constitutes an impermissible restriction
on liberty or permissible regulation, this court must analyze whether the
detention is imposed for the purpose of punishment or whether it may be
considered merely incidental to another legitimate government purpose. See
Salerno, 481 U.S. at 747, 107 S. Ct. 2095. Unless Congress expressly provides
that the purpose of the legislation is punitive, this court must determine
whether there is an alternative purpose for the restriction. See id. Because
the Supreme Court has found that deportation proceedings for resident aliens
are civil actions that are not intended as punishment for unlawful entry
into this country, we must conclude, for the purposes of this case, that
Congress did not intend to punish excludable aliens by detaining them prior
to removal from this country. See AADC, 525 U.S. at 491, 119 S. Ct. 936
(&quot;While the consequences of deportation may assuredly be grave, they
are not imposed as a punishment.&quot;); INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, 468 U.S.
1032, 1039, 104 S. Ct. 3479, 82 L. Ed. 2d 778 (1984) (&quot;The purpose
of deportation is not to punish past transgressions but rather to put an
end to a continuing violation of the immigration laws.&quot;). If the detention
is intended as legitimate regulation, as in this case, we must then determine
(1) whether there is an alternative, non-punitive purpose which may rationally
be assigned to the detention, and (2) whether the detention &quot;appears
excessive in relation to the alternative purpose assigned [to it].&quot;
Salerno, 481 U.S. at 747, 107 S. Ct. 2095 (internal citation omitted).</P>

<P>Bound by this analytical framework, we first consider whether the government
has articulated an alternative purpose, other than punishment, that is rationally
related to Rosales's detention. The government has identified its interests
in detaining Rosales as the need to protect society from a person who poses
a danger to the safety of other persons or to property pursuant to 8 U.S.C.
&sect; 1226(e) (1994).29 As we note infra, we do not dispute that Rosales's
detention is rationally related to this alternative purpose. Our analysis
focuses on the second prong of the Salerno test: evaluating whether Rosales's
detention appears excessive in relation to the alternative purpose such
that it violates his Fifth Amendment interest in liberty. In order to evaluate
the question of excessiveness, we must balance the government's stated purpose
against the likelihood of Rosales's deportation.</P>

<P>The Due Process Clause clearly does not grant a person an absolute right
to be free from detention, even when convicted of no crime. See Salerno,
481 U.S. at 748, 107 S. Ct. 2095; see also Schall v. Martin, 467 U.S. 253,
281, 104 S. Ct. 2403, 81 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1984) (permitting pretrial detention
of juvenile delinquents considered dangerous); Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S.
520, 535-40, 99 S. Ct. 1861, 60 L. Ed. 2d 447 (1979) (allowing pretrial
detention of arrestee if court finds there is risk of flight); Carlson v.
Landon, 342 U.S. 524, 537-42, 72 S. Ct. 525, 96 L. Ed. 547 (1952) (allowing
detention of Communist aliens pending deportation because they posed threat
to nation's public interest). In Salerno, the Supreme Court upheld the Bail
Reform Act against a challenge asserting that pretrial detention of prisoners
amounted to a deprivation of the prisoners' liberty in violation of the
Fifth Amendment. Noting that Congress's stated goal in enacting the Bail
Reform Act was to protect the community from dangerous persons likely to
commit crime prior to trial, the Court held that &quot;preventing danger
to the community is a legitimate regulatory goal&quot; and the Act was rationally
related to that goal. Salerno, 481 U.S. at 747, 107 S. Ct. 2095; see also
Martin, 467 U.S. at 264, 104 S. Ct. 2403 (&quot;The 'legitimate and compelling
state interest' in protecting the community from crime cannot be doubted.&quot;).
However, the Court explicitly acknowledged that length of detention could
contribute to a finding of excessiveness when it observed that, at some
point, &quot;detention in a particular case might become excessively prolonged,
and therefore punitive, in relation to Congress' regulatory goal.&quot;
See Salerno, 481 U.S. at 747 n. 4, 107 S. Ct. 2095. In its conclusion that
the Bail Reform Act did not cross that point, the Court emphasized that
the Act &quot;limits the circumstances under which detention may be sought
to the most serious of crimes.&quot; Id. at 747, 107 S. Ct. 2095. Among
the factors contributing to its conclusion, the Court noted that the government
must demonstrate probable cause that the arrestee committed the charged
crime; the government must prove by clear and convincing evidence that the
arrestee presents an identified and articulable threat to an individual
or the community; the arrestee is entitled to a prompt detention hearing
at which he may be represented by counsel and has the right to testify,
present evidence and cross-examine witnesses; and the Speedy Trial Act strictly
limits the amount of time an arrestee may be detained prior to trial. See
id. at 747-51, 107 S. Ct. 2095. Thus, the Salerno Court, carefully delineating
the contours of permissible detention, held that a finding of dangerousness
alone is not enough to justify civil pretrial detention without assurances
that the detention is of finite and limited duration.</P>

<P>Just as the Supreme Court concluded in Salerno, we recognize that Rosales's
detention is rationally related to the government's non-punitive purpose
of protecting public safety. Our concern is whether Rosales's detention,
rationally related though it may be to the government's purpose, is unconstitutionally
excessive when compared with the indefinite nature of his confinement. Detention
to effectuate deportation is arguably analogous to detention prior to criminal
trial. Although Rosales has never committed a crime of violence, he has
compiled a fairly long and progressively more serious criminal record. The
government's interest in detaining Rosales to protect the community from
harm is perhaps similar to the government's interest in detaining a violent
arrestee prior to trial who presents a safety risk to the community should
he be released. As the Supreme Court held in Salerno, &quot;the Government's
regulatory interest in community safety can, in appropriate circumstances,
outweigh an individual's liberty interest.&quot; Salerno, 481 U.S. at 748,
107 S. Ct. 2095. However, in this case, there are no protections similar
to those in Salerno for aliens who are detained while the government attempts
to effect their deportation. Cf. Foucha, 504 U.S. at 82, 112 S. Ct. 1780
(indefinite civil commitment of mentally ill persons is unconstitutional
because, unlike in Salerno, the detention is not limited in duration); Martin,
467 U.S. at 269-70, 104 S. Ct. 2403 (pretrial detention of juveniles is
constitutional because it is &quot;strictly limited in time&quot; and juveniles
receive an array of procedural protections during detention such that juvenile
may not be detained more than seventeen days). As the government has repeatedly
emphasized, there are no limits on the length that the Attorney General
may, under 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1226(e) (1994), detain an excludable alien released
from prison once the Attorney General concludes that the alien presents
a danger to persons or property.</P>

<P>Moreover, we note that in this case, unlike in Salerno, Rosales has served
his prison sentence for the crime with which he was charged and to which
he pleaded guilty. The district court judge set the length of Rosales's
sentence pursuant to the United States Sentencing Guidelines, and Rosales
paid his debt to society in due course. Should Rosales commit another crime
upon his release, there is no reason why he could not be charged, prosecuted,
and convicted for that crime. His sentence would undoubtedly reflect his
recidivist tendency. Cf. Foucha, 504 U.S. at 82, 112 S. Ct. 1780 (noting
that society's &quot;normal means of dealing with persistent criminal conduct&quot;
is sufficient arsenal against threat that mentally ill person may commit
future crime if he is not indefinitely committed). Were Rosales a citizen,
he would be entitled to be free once he served his sentence absent any new
charges of criminal conduct, even if authorities believed him still to be
a dangerous person capable of inflicting future harm on society.</P>

<P>Because Congress has bestowed on the executive the authority to determine
whether an alien released from prison still presents a threat to society,
however, such an alien may be detained after serving his sentence and prior
to his deportation. This court does not dispute Congress's authority to
grant the executive that power. However, we note that in one of its earliest
immigration cases, the Supreme Court delineated between detention as a means
to ensure deportation and detention as a method of punishment. In Wong Wing,
the Supreme Court stated that &quot;[w]e think it clear that detention or
temporary confinement, as part of the means necessary to give effect to
the provisions for the exclusion or expulsion of aliens, would be valid.&quot;
Wong Wing, 163 U.S. at 235, 16 S. Ct. 977. Implicit in the Supreme Court's
opinion is the idea that the strength of the government's interest in protecting
the community and enforcing its immigration laws must be considered in relation
to the possibility that the government may actually achieve its goal to
effect Rosales's deportation. With this admonition in mind, we turn to an
evaluation of the likelihood of Rosales's return to Cuba in order to determine
whether his civil detention is excessive in relation to the government's
purpose in detaining him.</P>

<P>The government argues that Cuba's unwillingness to accept the return
of its citizens does not affect Rosales's statutory or constitutional rights.
Appellee's Br. at 18. We disagree. The government submitted an affidavit
by Michael Ranneberger, the Coordinator of the Office of Cuban Affairs in
the State Department, detailing this country's negotiations with Cuba for
the return of Mariel Cubans. Ranneberger's testimony reveals clearly that
little progress on repatriation has been made in over fifteen years of talks.
Ranneberger could only assert that the issue of repatriating Mariel Cubans
&quot;remains under discussion.&quot; J.A. at 57. No evidence was presented
to this court that any agreement between the two nations was likely or even
possible in the near future. Moreover, no evidence was presented that Rosales
is among those Mariel Cubans who may be returned even if such an agreement
were to be executed.</P>

<P>Because the government has offered this court no credible proof that
there is any possibility that Cuba may accept Rosales's return any time
in the foreseeable future, we are constrained to conclude that Rosales faces
indefinite detention.30 While other circuits have found that excludable
aliens cannot demonstrate that they are being detained indefinitely because
of the possibility that their home country will one day invite them back,
see Zadvydas, 185 F.3d at 294 (holding that detention is not indefinite
until there is a showing that &quot;deportation is impossible, not merely
problematical, difficult, and distant&quot;); Chi Thon Ngo, 192 F.3d at
398 (concluding that &quot;[i]t is extremely unlikely that the [Vietnamese]
petitioner's detention will be permanent&quot; because &quot;[d]iplomatic
efforts with Vietnam are underway, albeit at a speed approximating the flow
of cold molasses&quot;), we decline to impose such a standard on Rosales.
We will not require an alien to demonstrate that there is no conceivable
possibility that his home country will ever accept his return in order to
prove that his or her detention is indefinite in nature. Due to the vicissitudes
of national politics and the potential for change in international relations,
no alien could ever surmount such a standard, as the government need only
point to ongoing talks, as it has in this case, or the potential for renewed
relations to defeat the alien's claim that his home nation has no interest
in repatriating him. Instead, this court will require the government to
demonstrate (1) that the alien's home nation and this government are engaged
in diplomatic discussions which encompass a specific repatriation agreement
whose details are currently being negotiated; and (2) that the alien is
among those whose repatriation the agreement contemplates. We believe that,
because the government has superior access to information on our diplomatic
negotiations with other nations, the burden appropriately rests on the government
to demonstrate adequately to this court that there is a genuine likelihood
that the alien is among those whom the home country will agree to take back.31</P>

<P>Moreover, we conclude that the fact that Rosales receives periodic review
of his parole status does not affect the nature of his detention as indefinite.
The district court determined that because the Cuban Review Plan calls for
yearly consideration of a detainee's status, Rosales cannot characterize
his detention as indefinite. J.A. at 92. According to the district court,
&quot;[h]is detention is not indefinite but is for only one year at a time;
at the end of each year he has an opportunity to plead his case anew.&quot;
J.A. at 92. Other courts have held similarly. See Chi Thon Ngo, 192 F.3d
at 398 (finding prolonged detention permissible provided the appropriate
provisions for parole are available); Barrera-Echavarria v. Rison, 44 F.3d
1441, 1450 (9th Cir. 1995) (en banc) (Mariel Cuban's detention is more like
&quot;a series of one-year periods of detention followed by an opportunity
to plead his case anew&quot;); cf. Zadvydas, 185 F.3d at 291 (noting that
because a resident alien has the opportunity to be paroled by showing that
he is no longer either a threat to the community or a flight risk, and because
his case is reviewed periodically, his detention cannot be considered indefinite).
However, as Rosales noted himself in his pro se brief to this court, even
monthly review of his status would not change the fact that he will not
be released until Cuba agrees to accept him, a prospect we have already
discounted, or the Cuban Review Panel determines that his behavior comports
with its guidelines such that it may offer him parole. As we discussed earlier,
because of the broad discretion bestowed upon the INS to grant and revoke
parole, Rosales can never be certain of receiving such parole, no matter
how well he behaves himself in detention.</P>

<P>Bearing in mind our obligation to weigh the government's stated interest
in protecting the community from danger against the likelihood that the
government will be able to effectuate Rosales's deportation, we conclude
that Rosales's confinement can only be considered excessive in relation
to the purpose of protecting the community from danger and enforcing an
immigration order that is, at present, unenforceable.32 We believe that
this case no longer implicates the government's plenary power to control
the scope of our nation's immigration laws, namely its ability to enforce
final orders of exclusion and deportation. Judicial deference to the political
branches' authority over immigration matters has always been premised on
the paramount importance of our nation's self-determination and our national
prerogative to control who enters our borders and on what conditions. See
Aguirre-Aguirre, 526 U.S. at 425, 119 S. Ct. 1439 (noting that judicial
deference &quot;is especially appropriate in the immigration context where
officials exercise especially sensitive political functions that implicate
questions of foreign relations&quot;) (internal citation omitted). Such
deference becomes less compelling, however, when it directly conflicts with
other constitutional interests. Cf. INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 941, 103
S. Ct. 2764, 77 L. Ed. 2d 317 (1983) (&quot;Congress has plenary authority
in all cases in which it has substantive legislative jurisdiction, so long
as the exercise of that authority does not offend some other constitutional
restriction.&quot;) (internal citation omitted). When there is no practical
possibility that the alien will be returned home, as in this case, then
Rosales's prolonged detention can no longer be considered an ancillary administrative
element of the INS's removal procedures and judicial deference loses its
rationale altogether. We agree with the Tenth Circuit that when an alien's
home country refuses to accept him, it appears that &quot;detention is [
] used as an alternative to exclusion rather than a step in the process
of returning petitioner to his native Cuba.&quot;33 Rodriguez-Fernandez
v. Wilkinson, 654 F.2d 1382, 1386 (10th Cir. 1981); cf. Chi Thon Ngo, 192
F.3d at 398 (&quot;It is [ ] unrealistic to believe that these INS detainees
are not actually being 'punished' in some sense for their past conduct.&quot;).
We conclude, therefore, that Rosales's detention has crossed the line from
permissive regulatory confinement to impermissible punishment without trial.34
We order Rosales's release within thirty days of the issuance of the mandate,
following a hearing before the district court, upon such conditions as the
district court may impose consistent with this opinion.</P>

<P>VI. Conclusion</P>

<P>The district court held that the prospect of indefinitely detaining Rosales
was not &quot;arbitrary, conscience-shocking nor oppressive in the constitutional
sense.&quot; With all due respect, this court must disagree. We conclude
that the district court improperly denied Rosales's petition for habeas
corpus. We therefore REVERSE the district court's judgment and REMAND for
proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</P>

<P>RICE, District Judge, dissenting.</P>

<P>Petitioner Mario Rosales-Garcia (&quot;Rosales&quot;), a citizen of Cuba,
is an excludable alien who came to the United States as part of the Mariel
boatlift. Since his arrival, Rosales twice has been granted immigration
parole by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (&quot;INS&quot;)1
On each occasion, the INS revoked his parole after his conviction on various
criminal charges. He is now being detained by the INS, pending an agency
determination either (1) that he is eligible for immigration parole once
again or (2) that Cuba will accept his return. The majority frames the issue
before the court as &quot;whether the executive branch of the government
has the authority under the United States Constitution to detain a person
indefinitely without charging him with a crime or affording him a trial.&quot;
With respect to Rosales, the majority answers this question in the negative,
concluding that his indefinite detention &quot;cannot be justified by reference
to the government's plenary power over immigration matters and that it violates
[his] substantive due process rights under the Due Process Clause of the
Fifth Amendment to the Constitution.&quot;</P>

<P>In reaching the foregoing conclusion, the majority does not dispute three
key points. First, the executive and legislative branches of the government
have almost complete control over matters involving immigration and the
exclusion of aliens, with virtually no interference from the judiciary.
See, e.g., Mathews v. Diaz, 426 U.S. 67, 81, 96 S. Ct. 1883, 48 L. Ed. 2d
478 (1976); Shaughnessy v. United States ex rel. Mezei, 345 U.S. 206, 210,
73 S. Ct. 625, 97 L. Ed. 956 (1953). Second, the government has the right
to designate Rosales an excludable alien and to attempt to remove him. Rosales
has no constitutional right to enter this country, and any attempt to do
so is a request for a privilege. This privilege must be exercised in accordance
with procedures established by Congress and implemented by the executive
branch. See, e.g., United States ex rel. Knauff v. Shaughnessy, 338 U.S.
537, 542-544, 70 S. Ct. 309, 94 L. Ed. 317 (1950). Third, the &quot;entry
fiction&quot; applies to this case. The entry fiction treats an excludable
alien &quot;as one standing on the threshold of entry, and therefore not
entitled to the constitutional protections provided to those within the
territorial jurisdiction of the United States.&quot; Ma v. Reno, 208 F.3d
815, 823 (9th Cir.), cert. granted, - U.S. -, 121 S. Ct. 297, 148 L. Ed.
2d 239 (2000). The majority acknowledges that, under the entry fiction,
individuals such as Rosales are &quot;treated as detained or 'excluded'
at the border despite [their] physical presence in the United States.&quot;
Indeed, the majority notes that such individuals &quot;have no rights with
regard to their entry or exclusion from this country and they are treated
differently from those who have 'passed through our gates.'&quot;</P>

<P>After recognizing the foregoing principles, the majority examines the
&quot;constitutional authority to detain indefinitely.&quot;2 In so doing,
the court properly notes that even excludable aliens are not completely
without constitutional protection. Given that aliens have been extended
certain Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights, the majority concludes
that excludable aliens such as Rosales possess a Fifth Amendment liberty
interest in freedom from indefinite detention by the INS. After also recognizing
that Congress may not authorize immigration officials to treat excludable
aliens with &quot;complete impunity&quot; by executing or torturing them,
the majority reasons:</P>

<P>. . . . We therefore find ourselves asked to draw a line of constitutional
dimension between the act of torturing an excludable alien and the act of
imprisoning such an alien indefinitely. We do not believe that the Constitution
authorizes us to draw such a line. While it is true that aliens are not
entitled to enjoy all the advantages of citizenship, see Diaz, 426 U.S.
at 78, 96 S. Ct. 1883, we emphasize that aliens-even excludable aliens-are
&quot;persons&quot; entitled to the Constitution's most basic protections
and strictures. We conclude that if Rosales is indeed being detained indefinitely,
[as] discussed infra, his Fifth Amendment interest in liberty is necessarily
implicated.</P>

<P>After finding that excludable aliens possess a liberty interest in freedom
from indefinite bodily restraint, the majority concludes that Rosales's
continued detention violates substantive due process. In reaching this conclusion,
the majority relies upon the analytical framework set forth in United States
v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 107 S. Ct. 2095, 95 L.Ed.2d 697 (1987). In Salerno,
the Supreme Court explained that whether a restriction on liberty (in the
form of pretrial detention) violates substantive due process turns upon
whether the detention is punishment without a trial or whether it is regulatory
in nature. Id. at 746-747, 107 S. Ct. 2095. Absent evidence that Congress
intended to punish excludable aliens by detaining them indefinitely,3 the
punitive/ regulatory distinction itself turns on (1) whether the detention
is rationally related to some alternative (i.e., non-punitive) purpose,
and (2) whether the detention appears excessive in relation to the alternative
purpose that Congress sought to achieve. Id. at 747, 107 S. Ct. 2095.</P>

<P>Applying the foregoing test, the majority notes that the United States
has identified as its &quot;alternative purpose&quot; in detaining Rosales
&quot;the need to protect society from a person who poses a danger to the
safety of other persons or to property. . . .&quot; The court then recognizes
that Rosales's detention is &quot;rationally related&quot; to the government's
&quot;alternative&quot; purpose of public safety. Nevertheless, the majority
concludes that his indefinite detention is &quot;excessive&quot; in relation
to the government's alternative (i.e., non-punitive) purpose, given (1)
the probability that he never will return to Cuba and (2) the fact that
he &quot;can never be certain of receiving [immigration] parole, no matter
how well he behaves himself in detention.&quot; As a result, the court concludes
that his &quot;detention has crossed the line from permissive regulatory
confinement to impermissible punishment without trial . . . .&quot; Consequently,
the majority orders his immediate release.</P>

<P>Having reviewed the majority's analysis, I disagree with it in two primary
respects. First, I do not believe that the indefinite detention of an excludable
alien such as Rosales implicates any protected liberty interest in freedom
from bodily restraint. Second, even assuming, arguendo, that a Fifth Amendment
liberty interest is implicated, I do not believe that Rosales's detention,
which includes annual review for parole eligibility, is excessive in relation
to the government's non-punitive purpose. Consequently, under Salerno, his
detention is regulatory in nature rather than punitive, and it does not
violate substantive due process, even if a protected liberty interest is
at stake.</P>

<P>Concerning the first issue, the existence of a liberty interest, I do
not dispute that excludable aliens possess some Fifth Amendment rights.
It is true that neither the Attorney General nor the INS may shoot or torture
Rosales without running afoul of his substantive due process rights. See,
e.g., Gisbert v. U.S. Attorney General, 988 F.2d 1437, 1442 (5th Cir. 1993),
amended 997 F.2d 1122 (5th Cir. 1993) (recognizing that excludable aliens
have a substantive due process right to be free from &quot;gross physical
abuse&quot;). The majority's ruling turns upon its inability to &quot;draw
a line of constitutional dimension between the act of torturing an excludable
alien and the act of imprisoning such an alien indefinitely.&quot; The court
concludes that the Constitution does not authorize the judiciary &quot;to
draw such a line.&quot;</P>

<P>Upon review, however, I cannot agree that drawing a line between torturing
an excludable alien and indefinitely detaining him to ensure exclusion from
this country violates the Constitution. The government's indefinite detention
of an excludable alien simply is not equivalent, for Fifth Amendment purposes,
to torturing him or to killing him. It has been generally accepted that
&quot;[e]xcluded aliens may be able to challenge, under a constitutional
theory, governmental action outside of the immigration context.&quot;4 Fernandez-Roque
v. Smith, 734 F.2d 576, 582 n.8 (11th Cir. 1984) (emphasis added) (citing
United States v. Henry, 604 F.2d 908, 914 (5th Cir. 1979)); see also Zadvydas
v. Underdown, 185 F.3d 279, 295 (5th Cir. 1999), cert. granted, - U.S. -,
121 S. Ct. 297, 148 L. Ed. 2d 239 (2000) (recognizing that excludable aliens
may have substantive due process rights, but only with respect to matters
that are unrelated to the government's plenary power over immigration).
However, this principle does not &quot;limit the government's conduct in
the immigration field where it possesses plenary authority.&quot; Fernandez-Roque,
734 F.2d at 582 n.8 (citing Jean v. Nelson, 727 F.2d 957 (11th Cir. 1984)
(en banc), aff'd 472 U.S. 846, 105 S. Ct. 2992, 86 L. Ed. 2d 664 (1985)).
In Lynch v. Cannatella, 810 F.2d 1363, 1373 (5th Cir. 1987), the court articulated
a clear rationale for drawing &quot;a line of constitutional dimension&quot;
between torturing an excludable alien and detaining him indefinitely:</P>

<P>The basis for limiting the constitutional protection afforded excludable
aliens has been the overriding concern that the United States, as a sovereign,
maintain[s] its right to self-determination. &quot;As the history of its
immigration policy makes clear, this nation has long maintained as a fundamental
aspect of its right to self-determination the prerogative to determine whether,
and in what numbers, outsiders without any cognizable connection to this
society shall be permitted to join it.&quot; Courts ordinarily should abstain
from placing limits on government discretion in these circumstances because
the sovereign interest in self-determination weighs so much more heavily
in this scheme than does the alien's interest in entering the country. That
interest, however, plays virtually no role in determining whether the Constitution
affords any protection to excludable aliens while they are being detained
by state officials and awaiting deportation. Counsel has not suggested and
we cannot conceive of any national interests that would justify the malicious
infliction of cruel treatment on a person in United States territory simply
because that person is an excludable alien. We therefore hold that, whatever
due process rights excludable aliens may be denied by virtue of their status,
they are entitled under the due process clauses of the fifth and fourteenth
amendments to be free of gross physical abuse at the hands of state or federal
officials.</P>

(&quot;Lynch plainly recognizes that excludable aliens may legally be denied
other due process rights, including the right to be free of detention.&quot;).5</P>

<P>In the present case, the government is not endeavoring to deprive Rosales
of life or property, nor is it seeking to deprive him of liberty, except
to the extent necessary to exclude him from this country, which the majority
concedes the INS has an absolute right to do. It is in this context that
Rosales has no liberty interest protected by the Fifth Amendment.6 See Fernandez-Roque,
734 F.2d at 582 (footnote omitted) (&quot;[W]e are compelled to conclude
that [immigration] parole is part of the admissions process. As such, its
denial or revocation does not rise to the level of a constitutional infringement.
Because the Cubans lack a constitutional liberty interest, we need not reach
the question of whether the Attorney General's plan satisfies due process.&quot;);
Ma, 208 F.3d at 824 (quoting Barrera-Echavarria v. Rison, 44 F.3d 1441,
1450 (9th Cir. 1995)) (citations omitted) (&quot;Noncitizens who are outside
United States territories enjoy very limited protections under the United
States Constitution. Because excludable aliens are deemed under the entry
doctrine not to be present on United States territory, a holding that they
have no substantive right to be free from immigration detention reasonably
follows.&quot;).</P>

<P>While it would indeed shock the conscience to permit the INS to shoot
or to torture a person seeking entry into the United States, it is not conscience
shocking to allow the INS to enforce its immigration policies by indefinitely
detaining such a person at the border when he will not or cannot go elsewhere.7
The Supreme Court has long held that &quot;an alien seeking initial admission
to the United States requests a privilege and has no constitutional rights
regarding his application, for the power to admit or exclude aliens is a
sovereign prerogative.&quot; Landon v. Plasencia, 459 U.S. 21, 32, 103 S.
Ct. 321, 74 L. Ed. 2d 21 (1982). &quot;In the exercise of its broad power
over naturalization and immigration, Congress regularly makes rules that
would be unacceptable if applied to citizens.&quot; Mathews, 426 U.S. at
79-80, 96 S. Ct. 1883. Indeed, &quot;[c]ourts have long recognized that
the governmental power to exclude or expel aliens may restrict aliens' constitutional
rights when the two come into direct conflict.&quot; Zadvydas, 185 F.3d
at 289.</P>

<P>Consistent with the foregoing principles, the federal circuit courts
routinely have rejected constitutional arguments that are similar, if not
identical, to the one advanced by Rosales in the present case. Most recently,
the Seventh Circuit rejected a substantive due process challenge to indefinite
confinement in Carrera-Valdez v. Perryman, 211 F.3d 1046 (7th Cir. 2000),8
reasoning as follows:</P>

<P>Almost fifty years ago, the Supreme Court held that an excludable alien
may be detained indefinitely when his country of origin will not accept
his return. Shaughnessy v. United States ex rel. Mezei, 345 U.S. 206, 73
S. Ct. 625, 97 L.Ed. 956 (1953). Several Justices in more recent years have
expressed unease with that decision, but it is conclusive in the courts
of appeals. It is therefore not surprising that at least five appellate
courts have rejected constitutional challenges, similar to Carrera's, brought
by others who arrived on the Mariel boatlift. See Guzman v. Tippy, 130 F.3d
64 (2d Cir. 1997); Palma v. Verdeyen, 676 F.2d 100 (4th Cir. 1982); Gisbert
v. U.S. Attorney General, 988 F.2d 1437, amended, 997 F.2d 1122 (5th Cir.
1993); Barrera-Echavarria v. Rison, 44 F.3d 1441 (9th Cir. 1995) (en banc);
Garcia-Mir v. Meese, 788 F.2d 1446 (11th Cir. 1986). See also Chi Thon Ngo
v. INS, 192 F.3d 390 (3d Cir. 1999). The only arguably contrary decision,
Rodriguez-Fernandez v. Wilkinson, 654 F.2d 1382 (10th Cir. 1981), has not
garnered adherents and is of doubtful vitality in its own circuit. Duy Dac
Ho v. Greene, 204 F.3d 1045 (10th Cir. 2000). Given Shaughnessy there is
little point in elaborate discussion by an inferior court. Carrera is not
constitutionally entitled to release.</P>

<P>Id. at 1048.9</P>

<P>In finding that excludable aliens have no constitutional right to be
free from indefinite immigration detention, the federal courts have relied
largely upon Shaughnessy v. United States ex rel. Mezei, 345 U.S. 206, 73
S. Ct. 625, 97 L.Ed. 956 (1953), in which the Supreme Court held that an
excludable alien may be detained indefinitely, without violating the Constitution,
when his country of origin will not accept his return.10 In Mezei, the Court
reasoned as follows:</P>

<P>. . . Aliens seeking entry from contiguous lands obviously can be turned
back at the border without more. While the Government might keep entrants
by sea aboard the vessel pending determination of their admissibility, resulting
hardships to the alien and inconvenience to the carrier persuaded Congress
to adopt a more generous course. By statute, it authorized, in cases such
as this, aliens' temporary removal from ship to shore. But such temporary
harborage, an act of legislative grace, bestows no additional rights. .
. . And this Court has long considered such temporary arrangements as not
affecting an alien's status; he is treated as if stopped at the border.</P>

<P>Thus we do not think that respondent's continued exclusion deprives him
of any statutory or constitutional right. . . .</P>

<P>Id. at 215 (citations and footnotes omitted).</P>

<P>The majority reasons that Mezei is distinguishable because it was decided
in the midst of the Korean War and it involved an individual whom the executive
branch had classified as a national security threat. The majority suggests
that the Mezei Court found no constitutional violation flowing from the
alien's indefinite detention precisely because of the national security
concerns at issue. Given that such &quot;incomparable exigencies&quot; do
not exist in the present case, the majority reasons that Mezei is distinguishable.</P>

<P>Having reviewed Mezei, I cannot agree with the majority's reading of
the opinion. In Mezei, the Supreme Court cited the Korean War and national
security concerns as the impetus behind the Attorney General's decision
to exclude an alien, pursuant to the Passport Act of 1918, which permitted
the executive branch &quot;to shut out aliens whose 'entry would be prejudicial
to the interests of the United States.'&quot; Mezei, 345 U.S. at 210, 73
S. Ct. 625; see also id. at 216, 73 S. Ct. 625 (characterizing the alien's
continued detention as &quot;[a]n exclusion proceeding grounded on danger
to the national security&quot;). &quot;[T]imes being what they [were],&quot;
the Court also recognized that Congress had declined to authorize the release
of excludable aliens such as Mezei. Id. at 216, 73 S. Ct. 625. The Mezei
Court then noted that it lacked the authority to substitute its judgment
for that of Congress with respect to the legislative determination that
individuals such as Mezei were to be excluded and not released. Id. (&quot;Whatever
our individual estimate of [the policy mandating Mezei's exclusion and indefinite
detention] and the fears on which it rests, respondent's right to enter
the United States depends on the congressional will, and courts cannot substitute
their judgment for the legislative mandate.&quot;).</P>

<P>Although national security concerns may have prompted the Attorney General
to exclude and to detain Mezei under legislation passed by Congress, the
Supreme Court did not rely on national security concerns to support its
determination that he lacked a substantive due process right to be free
from indefinite detention.11 Rather, the Supreme Court's constitutional
analysis turned on the more fundamental fact that Mezei, an excludable alien,
had no constitutional rights at all. Id. at 215, 73 S. Ct. 625 (reasoning
that Mezei's continued exclusion on Ellis Island did not deprive him of
any constitutional rights because he was &quot;treated as if stopped at
the border[,]&quot; despite his physical presence in the United States).
While Congress had provided for resident aliens to be released on bond pending
deportation, the Mezei Court noted that no similar statutory authority existed
for the release of excludable aliens. The Supreme Court also recognized
that Congress's failure to provide for the release of individuals such as
Mezei likely stemmed from fears associated with the Korean War. Id. at 216,
73 S. Ct. 625. Although it questioned that congressional policy &quot;and
the fears on which it rest[ed],&quot; the Supreme Court upheld Mezei's indefinite
detention because, as an excludable alien, he had no constitutional rights
and his right to enter the United States depended solely &quot;on the congressional
will[.]&quot; Id. at 215-216, 73 S. Ct. 625.</P>

<P>Contrary to the majority's assertion herein, the Mezei Court did not
cite the Korean War and national security concerns as the impetus behind
its determination that Mezei's confinement violated no constitutionally
protected right. In other words, the Court did not suggest that Mezei would
have had a constitutionally protected liberty interest in freedom from bodily
restraint but for the conflict in Korea. To the contrary, the Court found
no due process violation because Mezei, an alien seeking initial entry,
had no constitutional right to enter the United States at all. Id. at 215,
73 S. Ct. 625 (&quot;While the Government might keep entrants by sea aboard
the vessel pending determination of their admissibility, resulting hardships
. . . persuaded Congress to adopt a more generous course. . . . But such
temporary harborage, an act of legislative grace, bestows no additional
rights. . . . Thus, we do not think that respondent's continued exclusion
deprives him of any statutory or constitutional right.&quot;). Absent a
constitutional right to enter this country, Mezei simply had no liberty
interest in being free from indefinite detention to effect his exclusion.
The &quot;exigencies&quot; associated with the Korean War were not crucial
to the Court's resolution of this constitutional issue.12 Rather, those
national security concerns merely explained why the Attorney General had
exercised his statutory authority to exclude and to detain Mezei. Notably,
a number of other circuit courts have also read Mezei as standing for the
proposition that an excludable alien has no liberty interest in freedom
from indefinite immigration detention. See, e.g., Carrera-Valdez, 211 F.3d
at 1048 (&quot;Almost fifty years ago, the Supreme Court held that an excludable
alien may be detained indefinitely when his country of origin will not accept
his return. . . . Given [Mezei] there is little point in elaborate discussion
by an inferior court. Carrera is not constitutionally entitled to release.&quot;);
Ma, 208 F.3d at 823 (&quot;While the Court held that Mezei could be detained
indefinitely on Ellis Island, because no country would take him back, it
rested its holding on the fact that Mezei's exclusion did not violate the
immigration statute, and that as an alien who had not yet entered the country
he had no other rights.&quot;); Fernandez-Roque, 734 F.2d at 582.</P>

<P>The majority also asserts that the government's reading of Mezei is contrary
to &quot;a long line of Supreme Court decisions extending to aliens basic
Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendment protections. . . .&quot; Most of
the decisions upon which the majority relies, however, involved aliens who
had entered the United States, either legally or otherwise. See, e.g., Reno
v. Flores, 507 U.S. 292, 113 S. Ct. 1439, 123 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1993); Plyler
v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 102 S. Ct. 2382, 72 L. Ed. 2d 786 (1982); Mathews
v. Diaz, 426 U.S. 67, 96 S. Ct. 1883, 48 L. Ed. 2d 478 (1976); Graham v.
Richardson, 403 U.S. 365, 91 S. Ct. 1848, 29 L. Ed. 2d 534 (1971); Wong
Wing v. United States, 163 U.S. 228, 16 S. Ct. 977, 41 L.Ed. 140 (1896);
Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356, 6 S. Ct. 1064, 30 L.Ed. 220 (1886).</P>

<P>When considering the constitutional protection to which an alien is entitled,
the Supreme Court has long distinguished between aliens who have entered
the United States, even if their presence here is illegal, and aliens who
have not yet entered this country. See, e.g., Yick Wo, 118 U.S. at 369,
6 S. Ct. 1064 (recognizing that the protections of the Fourteenth Amendment
extend &quot;to all persons within the territorial jurisdiction&quot; of
a state); Johnson v. Eisentrager, 339 U.S. 763, 770-771, 70 S. Ct. 936,
94 L.Ed. 1255 (1950) (noting that &quot;presence&quot; in the United States
gives an alien certain rights, and acknowledging that the Supreme Court
has &quot;extended to the person and property of resident aliens important
constitutional guaranties&quot;); Plyler, 457 U.S. at 212, 102 S. Ct. 2382
(recognizing that the Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments have a &quot;territorial
theme,&quot; as the protections provided by those Amendments apply &quot;'to
all persons within the territory of the United States,' including aliens
unlawfully present&quot;); United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez, 494 U.S. 259,
270-271, 110 S. Ct. 1056, 108 L. Ed. 2d 222 (1990) (recognizing that various
constitutional protections have been afforded to aliens who are present
in the United States, whereas aliens who are not voluntarily within this
nation's borders have not been granted the same protections).13</P>

<P>Without question, aliens who are present in the United States do enjoy
significant constitutional protections. In Rosales's case, however, the
entry fiction treats him as if he remains detained at the border and not
present in the United States. See, e.g., Ma, 208 F.3d at 824 (quoting Barrera-Echavarria,
44 F.3d at 1450) (recognizing that &quot; 'excludable aliens are deemed
under the entry doctrine not to be present on United States territory'&quot;).
The majority does not dispute the applicability of the entry fiction herein.
Consequently, the &quot;long line&quot; of Supreme Court precedent cited
by the majority does not controvert the government's reading of Mezei, which
involved an excludable alien who, under the entry fiction, remained detained
at this nation's border and, like Rosales, was not present in the United
States.14</P>

<P>In short, Rosales's substantive due process claim is a victim of the
entry fiction. As noted above, that doctrine treats an excludable alien
&quot;as one standing on the threshold of entry, and therefore not entitled
to the constitutional protections provided to those within the territorial
jurisdiction of the United States.&quot; Ma, 208 F.3d at 823. Although Rosales
may have a Fifth Amendment liberty interest in not being shot or tortured,
he simply has no protected liberty interest in freedom from being detained
indefinitely at this country's border.15 This is so because he has no constitutional
right to enter the United States,16 and the Attorney General has an absolute
right to effect his exclusion.17 &quot;[A] constitutionally protected [liberty]
interest cannot arise from relief that the executive exercises unfettered
discretion to award.&quot; Tefel v. Reno, 180 F.3d 1286, 1300 (11th Cir.
1999). Adopting the majority's reasoning would mean that &quot;[a] foreign
leader could eventually compel us to grant physical admission via parole
to any aliens he wished by the simple expedient of sending them here and
then refusing to take them back.&quot; Jean, 727 F.2d at 975. As a practical
matter, such a rule would bestow upon foreign leaders the power to dictate
U.S. immigration policy. Cf. Gisbert, 988 F.2d at 1447 (&quot;Accepting
petitioners' arguments here would allow one country to export its unwanted
nationals and force them upon another country by the simple tactic of refusing
to accept their return. . . . The United States cannot be forced to violate
its national sovereignty in order to parole these aliens within its borders
merely because Cuba is dragging its feet in repatriating them.&quot;); Barrera-Echavarria,
44 F.3d at 1448 (&quot;A judicial decision requiring that excludable aliens
be released into American society when neither their countries of origin
nor any third country will admit them might encourage the sort of intransigence
Cuba has exhibited in the negotiations over the Mariel refugees.&quot;).</P>

<P>Even assuming, arguendo, that a Fifth Amendment liberty interest is implicated,
Rosales's detention, which includes annual review for parole eligibility,
is not excessive in relation to the government's concern about protecting
society from a criminal alien who previously has committed felony offenses
while on immigration parole. In Alvarez-Mendez v. Stock, 941 F.2d 956 (9th
Cir. 1991), the court reached a similar conclusion with respect to a detained
Mariel Cuban, applying the balancing-of-interests approach set forth in
Salerno, 481 U.S. at 747, 107 S. Ct. 2095, and adopted by the majority herein.
In relevant part, the Alvarez-Mendez court reasoned as follows:</P>

<P>A detainee may not be punished prior to an adjudication of guilt in accordance
with due process of law. White v. Roper, 901 F.2d 1501, 1504 (9th Cir. 1990).
Not all detention, however, is punishment. Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520,
539 n.20, 99 S. Ct. 1861, 1874 n.20, 60 L. Ed. 2d 447 (1979). In the absence
of express intent to punish, the most significant factors in identifying
punishment are &quot;whether an alternative purpose to which [the restriction]
may rationally be connected is assignable for it, and whether it appears
excessive in relation to the alternative purpose assigned [to it].&quot;
United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 747, 107 S. Ct. 2095, 2101, 95 L.
Ed. 2d 697 (1987) (quotations omitted).</P>

<P>In denying Alvarez-Mendez reparole, the Associate Commissioner cited
Alvarez-Mendez's criminal arrests and convictions, and concluded on the
basis of these crimes that it was unlikely that Alvarez Mendez would &quot;remain
non-violent or honor the conditions of parole if released.&quot; Protecting
society from a potentially dangerous alien is a rational, non-punitive purpose
for Alvarez Mendez's detention. Because such protection requires separating
Alvarez Mendez from society, and because immediate removal from the country
is not possible, detention is not an excessive means of accomplishing such
protection.</P>

<P>Id. at 962.</P>

<P>The Fifth Circuit subsequently cited Alvarez-Mendez with approval in
Gisbert, 988 F.2d at 1442, concluding that the continued detention of Mariel
Cubans &quot;is not punishment&quot; and is not excessive in relation to
the government's rational purpose of protecting society from potentially
dangerous aliens. This is particularly true in the present case, given that
Rosales continues to receive annual consideration for immigration parole,
despite the fact that he has twice committed serious offenses while on such
parole. Cf. Barrera-Echavarria, 44 F.3d at 1450 (&quot;When viewed in this
light, as a series of one-year periods of detention followed by an opportunity
to plead his case anew, we have no difficulty concluding that Barrera's
detention is constitutional under Mezei.&quot;); Chi Thon Ngo v. I.N.S.,
192 F.3d 390, 398 (3rd Cir. 1999) (&quot;We therefore hold that excludable
aliens with criminal records as specified in the Immigration Act may be
detained for lengthy periods when removal is beyond the control of the INS,
provided that appropriate provisions for parole are available.&quot;); id.
at 399 (&quot;So long as petitioner will receive searching periodic reviews,
the prospect of indefinite detention without hope for parole will be eliminated.
In these circumstances, due process will be satisfied.&quot;); Zadvydas,
185 F.3d at 297 n.19 (noting that &quot;the detention of certain classes
of persons to protect society at large is not wholly alien to our constitutional
order and has been allowed in special situations when, as here, there are
procedures to insure that detention must be periodically reviewed&quot;).</P>

<P>In opposition to the foregoing conclusion, the majority reasons that
&quot;the strength of the government's interest in protecting the community
and enforcing its immigration laws must be considered in relation to the
possibility that the government may actually achieve its goal to effect
Rosales's deportation.&quot; Given that Rosales is unlikely ever to be returned
to Cuba, the court concludes that the strength of the government's interest
diminishes to the point that it is outweighed by Rosales's liberty interest
in freedom from bodily restraint. Specifically, the majority states that
&quot;Rosales's confinement can only be considered excessive in relation
to the purpose of protecting the community from danger and enforcing an
immigration order that is, at present, unenforceable.&quot;</P>

<P>By detaining Rosales, however, the government is enforcing immigration
law and the order excluding Rosales from this country. Under the entry fiction,
the applicability of which the majority does not dispute, Rosales is being
detained at the border because he has no legal right to enter this country.
He continues to have no legal right to enter this country, regardless of
how long he remains waiting at the border. Therefore, by refusing to release
Rosales into the United States, the Attorney General is unquestionably enforcing
immigration policy, which includes not only deporting him but also excluding
him. The fact that Cuba will not accept his return does not alter the fact
that the government is enforcing both its immigration law and Rosales's
order of exclusion simply by ensuring his exclusion from U.S. territory.
Indeed, the only way that U.S. immigration policy and the order of exclusion
will be rendered &quot;unenforceable&quot; is if this court orders an excludable
alien such as Rosales to be released into the general population. Finally,
the fact that Cuba will not accept Rosales's return does not alter the fact
that the government is ensuring public safety by detaining Rosales, a person
who has committed felony offenses in the United States, subject to annual
review for purposes of determining his eligibility for immigration parole.18</P>

<P>Based on the reasoning and citation of authority set forth above, I conclude
that Rosales lacks a liberty interest in freedom from continued detention
by the INS. Even assuming, arguendo, that he does possess such an interest,
I find that it is outweighed by the government's regulatory interest in
enforcing immigration laws and providing for public safety. Consequently,
Rosales's indefinite confinement does not violate substantive due process.</P>

<P>In conclusion, I pause briefly to note my agreement with the district
court's determination that Rosales's procedural due process rights have
not been violated. Although the majority fails to reach this issue, given
its finding of a substantive due process violation, the Supreme Court has
recognized that &quot;[w]hatever the procedure authorized by Congress is,
it is due process as far as an alien denied entry is concerned.&quot; Knauff,
338 U.S. at 544, 70 S. Ct. 309; see also Mezei, 345 U.S. at 212, 73 S. Ct.
625. Consequently, the district court properly examined the Attorney General's
Cuban Review Plan, found at 8 C.F.R. &sect; 212.12, to identify the procedural
rights at issue. See, e.g., Garcia-Arena v. Luttrell, 238 F.3d 420, 2000
WL 1827855 at *2 (6th Cir. Dec. 8, 2000) (unpublished) (recognizing that
excludable aliens are entitled to only the procedural rights provided by
8 C.F.R. &sect; 212.12).</P>

<P>The crux of Rosales's argument on appeal does not appear to be that the
INS violated the procedure set forth in 8 C.F.R. &sect; 212.12 when it declined
to grant him immigration parole. Rather, Rosales appears to argue that the
INS violated procedural due process rights emanating from the Constitution.19
Stated differently, Rosales suggests that the immigration parole procedure
contained in 8 C.F.R. &sect; 212.12 is itself deficient because it does
not afford him certain due process rights guaranteed by the Constitution.20
However, in Betancourt v. Chandler, 230 F.3d 1357, 2000 WL 1359634 at *2
(6th Cir. Sept. 14, 2000) (unpublished), a panel of this court recently
recognized that excludable aliens are entitled to only those procedural
rights provided by 8 C.F.R. &sect; 212.12, not the Constitution. Absent
a violation of &sect; 212.12, which Rosales has not demonstrated, he has
no procedural due process claim.</P>

<P>For the reasons set forth above, I respectfully dissent.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>* 1The Honorable Walter Herbert Rice, Chief United States District Judge
for the Southern District of Ohio, sitting by designation.</P>

<P>1 The statute read in pertinent part: &quot;The Attorney General may
. . . in his discretion parole into the United States temporarily under
such conditions as he may prescribe for emergent reasons or for reasons
deemed strictly in the public interest any alien applying for admission
to the United States, but such parole of such alien shall not be regarded
as an admission of the alien and when the purposes of such parole shall,
in the opinion of the Attorney General, have been served the alien shall
forthwith return or be returned to the custody from which he was paroled
and thereafter his case shall continue to be dealt with in the same manner
as that of any other applicant for admission to the United States.&quot;
8 U.S.C. &sect; 1182(d)(5)(A) (1994) (amended by the Illegal Immigration
Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (&quot;IIRIRA&quot;) &sect;
602(a), Pub. L. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009 (1996)).</P>

<P>2 Rosales was first arrested in 1980 for aggravated battery. That charge
was dismissed. J.A. at 145. He was arrested for other offenses, including
possession of marijuana, burglary, and loitering, but apparently he was
not convicted of those offenses. J.A. at 147-54.</P>

<P>3 Before the enactment of IIRIRA, aliens ineligible for admission into
the United States were designated &quot;excludable&quot; aliens. See 8 U.S.C.
&sect; 1182(a) (1994). Excludable aliens who were granted &quot;parole&quot;
by the Attorney General could then enter the country. If an excludable alien's
parole was revoked, exclusion proceedings would be brought to deport him.
See 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1182(d)(5)(A) (1994). These aliens are now referred
to as &quot;inadmissible&quot; aliens. See 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1182(a). Aliens
who had gained admission into the United States but were here illegally
were designated &quot;deportable&quot; aliens. See 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1251
(1994). They could be removed from this country by deportation proceedings.
See 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1252 (1994). Proceedings to remove both inadmissible
and deportable aliens are now referred to as &quot;removal&quot; proceedings.
See 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1229a. Inadmissible aliens are removable under 8 U.S.C.
&sect; 1227(a)(1)(A). Under the prior statutory scheme, Rosales was an &quot;excludable&quot;
alien.</P>

<P>4 Because of the lack of an agreement with Cuba for the return of Mariel
Cubans, the Attorney General adopted the Cuban Review Plan, at 8 C.F.R.
&sect;&sect; 212.12-.13, in 1987 to govern the grant and revocation of parole
to all Cubans who arrived in the United States between April 15, 1980 and
October 20, 1980. Under the Plan, the authority to grant parole for detained
Mariel Cubans rests with the INS Commissioner, who may act through an Associate
Commissioner for Enforcement. See id. &sect; 212.12(b)(1). The Associate
Commissioner must appoint a Review Plan Director who designates two- or
three-person panels (the &quot;Cuban Review Panel&quot;) to make parole
recommendations to the Associate Commissioner. The regulations provide for
the annual review of a detainee's status. See id. at &sect; 212.12(g)(2).
Before making a recommendation that a detainee be granted parole, the Cuban
Review Panel members &quot;must conclude that: [1] The detainee is presently
a nonviolent person; [2] The detainee is likely to remain nonviolent; [3]
The detainee is not likely to pose a threat to the community following his
release; and [4] The detainee is not likely to violate the conditions of
his parole.&quot; Id. &sect; 212.12(d)(2).</P>

<P>Each panel must weigh the following factors when making its decisions:
&quot;[1] The nature and number of disciplinary infractions or incident
reports received while in custody; [2] The detainee's past history of criminal
behavior; [3] Any psychiatric and psychological reports pertaining to the
detainee's mental health; [4] Institutional progress relating to participation
in work, educational and vocational programs; [5] His ties to the United
States, such as the number of close relatives residing lawfully here; [6]
The likelihood that he may abscond, such as from any sponsorship program;
and [7] Any other information which is probative of whether the detainee
is likely to . . . engage in future acts of violence, . . . future criminal
activity, or is likely to violate the conditions of his parole.&quot; See
id. &sect; 212.12(d)(3).</P>

<P>5 The statute provided, in pertinent part, that &quot;the Attorney General
shall take into custody any alien convicted of an aggravated felony upon
release of the alien&quot; from criminal confinement. 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1226(e)
(1994). The parties do not dispute that Rosales's conviction for conspiracy
to possess with intent to distribute cocaine was an &quot;aggravated felony&quot;
under the statute.</P>

<P>6 The Review Panel worksheet also reveals that Rosales has demonstrated
&quot;good conduct&quot; while in custody and that he has participated in
English as a Second Language classes, a drug rehabilitation program, industrial
training, automotive training, and has received his GED equivalency. J.A.
at 137.</P>

<P>7 As of July 19, 2000, Rosales had been determined to be releasable by
the INS pending placement in a suitable halfway house. The effect of this
determination is discussed infra.</P>

<P>8 This statute provides that &quot;[t]he Attorney General shall be charged
with the administration and enforcement of this chapter and all other laws
relating to the immigration and naturalization of aliens, except insofar
as this chapter or such laws relate to the powers, functions, and duties
conferred upon the President, the Secretary of State, the officers of the
Department of State, or diplomatic or consular officers: Provided, however,
That determination and ruling by the Attorney General with respect to all
questions of law shall be controlling.&quot; 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1103(a)(1).</P>

<P>9 This section provides: &quot;Except as provided in this section and
notwithstanding any other provision of law, no court shall have jurisdiction
to hear any cause or claim by or on behalf of any alien arising from the
decision or action by the Attorney General to commence proceedings, adjudicate
cases, or execute removal orders against any alien under this Chapter.&quot;
8 U.S.C. &sect; 1252(g).</P>

<P>10 This section provides: &quot;Nothing in this section shall be construed
to create any substantive or procedural right or benefit that is legally
enforceable by any party against the United States or its agencies or officers
or any other person.&quot; 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1231(h).</P>

<P>11 This section provides: &quot;The Attorney General's discretionary
judgment regarding the application of this section shall not be subject
to review. No court may set aside any action or decision by the Attorney
General under this section regarding the detention or release of any alien
or the grant, revocation, or denial of bond or parole.&quot; 8 U.S.C. &sect;
1226(e).</P>

<P>12 In Mansour, this court noted that because habeas relief was available
to aliens seeking review of final deportation orders, the statute denying
any court's jurisdiction to review those orders was constitutional. However,
this court left undecided the scope of habeas review available to such aliens.
See Mansour, 123 F.3d at 426 n.3 (&quot;[W]e need not address the scope
of review that is available on a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.&quot;).</P>

<P>13 We do not believe that either 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1226(e) or &sect; 1231(h)
limits our jurisdiction over this appeal because these newly enacted provisions
under IIRIRA do not govern this case. See IIRIRA &sect; 309(c)(1).</P>

<P>14 IIRIRA provides that the revised rules governing removal proceedings,
as well as judicial review of those proceedings, do not apply to aliens
who were already in exclusion or deportation proceedings prior to the Act's
effective date on April 1, 1997. See IIRIRA &sect; 309(c)(1). However, IIRIRA
&sect; 306(c)(1) makes &sect; 1252(g) applicable to cases &quot;arising
from all past, pending, or future exclusion, deportation, or removal proceedings&quot;
under the Act. IIRIRA &sect; 306(c)(1) (emphasis added). Section 1252(g)
purports to strip courts of their jurisdiction over most actions by the
Attorney General relating to immigration actions &quot;[e]xcept as provided
in this section.&quot; However, according to &sect; 309(c)(1), none of the
other provisions in &sect; 1252 apply to cases pending before April 1, 1997.
In order to avoid reading &sect; 309(c)(1) into a nullity, the Supreme Court
crafted an extremely narrow reading of &sect; 1252(g). See Mustata v. U.S.
Dep't of Justice, 179 F.3d 1017, 1020 n.3 (6th Cir. 1999) (explaining the
conflict between the provisions in greater depth).</P>

<P>15 The Associate Commissioner may revoke parole in the exercise of her
discretion when &quot;(1) The purposes of parole have been served; (2) The
Mariel Cuban violates any condition of parole; (3). It is appropriate to
enforce an order of exclusion or to commence proceedings against a Mariel
Cuban; or (4) The period of parole has expired without being renewed.&quot;
8 C.F.R. &sect; 212.12(h).</P>

<P>16 This court has authored several unpublished decisions including Betancourt
v. Chandler, No. 99-5797, 2000 WL 1359634, at *2 (6th Cir. Sept. 14, 2000)
(rejecting claim that Attorney General lacks authority to detain excludable
alien indefinitely); Laetividad v. INS, No. 99-5245, 1999 WL 1282432, at
*1 (6th Cir. Dec. 27, 1999); Fernandez-Santana v. Chandler, No. 98-6453,
1999 WL 1281781, at *1 (6th Cir. Dec. 27, 1999); and Gonzalez v. Luttrell,
No. 96-5098, 1996 WL 627717, at *1 (6th Cir. Oct. 29, 1996), that affirm
the district court's dismissal or denial of an excludable alien's habeas
corpus petition. However, because these cases are unpublished, they are
not binding on this court. See 6th Cir. R. 28(g); Salamalekis v. Comm'r
of Soc. Sec., 221 F.3d 828, 833 (6th Cir. 2000) (unpublished decisions are
not binding precedent).</P>

<P>17 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1226 (1994) was repealed and reenacted by Congress
in IIRIRA &sect; 303 (codified at 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1226). The amended version
of the statute is inapplicable to this case.</P>

<P>18 See 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1101(a)(43) (1994) (defining aggravated felonies).</P>

<P>19 The Constitution imbues the legislature with the power to &quot;establish

<P>20 The plenary power doctrine, articulated in Harisiades v. Shaughnessy,
342 U.S. 580, 588-89, 72 S. Ct. 512, 96 L.Ed. 586 (1952), states that &quot;any
policy toward aliens is vitally and intricately interwoven with contemporaneous
policies in regard to the conduct of foreign relations, the war power, and
the maintenance of a republican form of government. Such matters are so
exclusively entrusted to the political branches of government as to be largely
immune from judicial inquiry or interference.&quot; See also Zadvydas, 185
F.3d at 289 (&quot;The power of the national government to act in the immigration
sphere is thus essentially plenary.&quot;).</P>

<P>21 See 8 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 1103, 1182. Section 1103(a)(1) states that
the &quot;Attorney General shall be charged with the administration and
enforcement of this chapter and all other laws relating to the immigration
and naturalization of aliens&quot; and that the &quot;determination and
ruling by the Attorney General with respect to all questions of law shall
be controlling.&quot;</P>

<P>22 Mezei was born in Gibraltar and lived in the United States from 1923
to 1948. See Mezei, 345 U.S. at 208, 73 S. Ct. 625. In 1948, he went to
Romania to visit his dying mother. He was denied entry to Romania, and remained
in Hungary for 19 months before returning to the United States with a quota
immigration visa issued by this country. On February 9, 1950 he was deemed
excludable by an immigration officer at Ellis Island on the ground that
his entry would prejudice the public interest because he was a security
threat.</P>

<P>23 The Passport Act was amended in 1941 by an act of Congress pursuant
to a national emergency declared by the President on May 27, 1941 and which
continued in effect in 1953. The amendments to the Act gave the Attorney
General authority to exclude aliens whose &quot;entry would be prejudicial
to the United States.&quot; See Knauff, 338 U.S. at 540-41, 70 S. Ct. 309
(citing Act of June 21, 1941, c. 210, 55 Stat. 252, amending &sect; 1 of
the Act of May 22, 1918, c. 81, 40 Stat. 559, codified at 22 U.S.C. &sect;
223 (repealed 1952)).</P>

<P>24 The Supreme Court in Mezei specifically noted that Mezei's stateless
condition was due to the fact that he &quot;left the United States and remained
behind the Iron Curtain for 19 months.&quot; Mezei, 345 U.S. at 214, 73
S. Ct. 625. In his dissent, Justice Jackson criticized the majority for
succumbing to the government's fear of Communist &quot;infiltration.&quot;
He stated: &quot;[M]y apprehensions about the security of our form of government
are about equally aroused by those who refuse to recognize the dangers of
Communism and those who will not see danger in anything else.&quot; Id.
at 227, 73 S. Ct. 625 (Jackson, J., dissenting). He concluded by observing
that it is &quot;inconceivable&quot; that a &quot;measure of simple justice
and fair dealing,&quot; namely a &quot;fair hearing with fair notice of
the charges,&quot; would &quot;menace the security of this country. No one
can make me believe that we are that far gone.&quot; Id. at 228, 73 S. Ct.
625.</P>

<P>25 Moreover, Mezei has been severely criticized for establishing a &quot;preposterous&quot;
level of deference to Congress's authorization of due process procedures
for aliens. See Henry Hart, The Power of Congress to Limit the Jurisdiction
of Federal Courts: An Exercise in Dialectic, 66 Harv. L. Rev. 1362, 1392
(1953).</P>

<P>26 Indeed, prior to those Supreme Court cases in the 1950s allowing indefinite
detention, courts refused to permit the indefinite detention of aliens.
As one court held:</P>

<P>The right to arrest and hold or imprison an alien is nothing but a necessary
incident of the right to exclude or deport. There is no power in this court
or in any other tribunal in this country to hold indefinitely any sane citizen
or alien in imprisonment, except as a punishment for crime. Slavery was
abolished by the Thirteenth Amendment. It is elementary that deportation
or exclusion proceedings are not punishment for crime. . . . [Petitioner]
is entitled to be deported, or to have his freedom.</P>

<P>Bonder v. Johnson, 5 F.2d 238, 239 (D. Mass. 1925); see also Caranica
v. Nagle, 28 F.2d 955, 957 (9th Cir. 1928) (holding that government must
release alien if government fails to execute order of deportation &quot;within
a reasonable time&quot;).</P>

<P>27 Other circuits have noted that excludable aliens possess some form
of due process rights. See, e.g., Chi Thon Ngo, 192 F.3d at 396 (&quot;Even
an excludable alien is a 'person' for purposes of the Fifth Amendment and
is thus entitled to substantive due process.&quot;); Zadvydas, 185 F.3d
at 294 (&quot;Excludable aliens are persons, entitled to some due process,
and other, constitutional protections.&quot;); Lynch, 810 F.2d at 1366 (holding
that &quot;even excludable aliens are entitled to the protection of the
due process clause while they are physically in the United States&quot;).</P>

<P>28 We note that the Supreme Court decided Mezei before deciding a line
of cases that expanded upon its conceptions of substantive due process,
as well as cases that developed a framework for analyzing whether civil
or regulatory confinement rises to the level of criminal &quot;punishment&quot;
and thus violates a detainee's substantive due process rights.</P>

<P>29 Other courts have identified additional purposes for detention including:
the government's ability to enforce deportation or exclusion orders; and
preventing an alien's flight prior to deportation. See Hermanowski v. Farquharson,
39 F. Supp. 2d 148, 159 (D.R.I. 1999); Phan v. Reno, 56 F. Supp. 2d 1149,
1155-56 (W.D. Wash. 1999); Vo v. Greene, 63 F. Supp. 2d 1278, 1285 (D. Colo.
1999). However, because the government identified only safety to persons
and property as its rationale for Rosales's detention, we confine ourselves
to evaluating this interest.</P>

<P>30 Rosales has thus far been detained in immigration custody for over
three years.</P>

<P>31 Although the dissent states that excludable aliens &quot;will not
or cannot go elsewhere,&quot; see infra p. [120a] (emphasis added), we think
it important to note that it has never been suggested to this court that
Rosales has had the opportunity to be released to any third country. The
dissent further states, see infra note 17, that &quot;Rosales's habeas petition
does not suggest that he or his relatives, who are living in Florida, have
arranged for him to leave the United States. Instead, he wants to be released
into this country.&quot; We seriously question how an alien who is in prison
and unrepresented by counsel could ever &quot;arrange&quot; to leave this
country, much less whether there is any evidence in the record that any
other country will accept Rosales.</P>

<P>32 Several district courts have reached the same constitutional conclusion
with regard to deportable aliens. See Kay v. Reno, 94 F. Supp. 2d 546, 553
(M.D. Pa. 2000); Le v. Greene, 84 F. Supp. 2d 1168, 1175 (D. Colo. 2000);
Vo v. Greene, 63 F. Supp. 2d 1278, 1285 (D. Colo. 1999); Tam v. INS, 14
F. Supp. 2d 1184, 1192 (E.D. Cal. 1998) (&quot;At some point, indefinite
detention of a deportable alien caused by an unenforceable INS order must
intersect with the Constitution&quot;); Hermanowski v. Farquharson, 39 F.
Supp. 2d 148, 162 (D.R.I. 1999) (detention for over twenty-eight months
with the promise of continued imprisonment for the rest of his life even
though alien's country has refused to allow deportation constitutes governmental
conduct that &quot;shocks the conscience&quot; in violation of the Fifth
Amendment).</P>

<P>33 Although the dissent claims that our reasoning will undermine this
nation's ability to enforce its immigration laws by encouraging foreign
countries to send their undesirable citizens to our shores, see infra p.
[132a-133a], we believe the dissent's contention is belied by common sense.
By virtue of the fact that a nation has cast out certain of its citizens-as
in the Mariel boatlift-we can reasonably conclude that such a nation is
unlikely to be influenced by the possibility that one day its citizens might
be paroled into this country, rather than spending their remaining days
locked up in American detention centers.</P>

<P>34 Because we find that petitioner's substantive due process rights were
violated, we do not reach his procedural due process claims.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>1 Immigration parole adopts the fiction that Rosales has never entered
this country. See Vargas v. Swan, 854 F.2d 1028, 1029 (7th Cir. 1988). Despite
his parole and physical presence within the United States, the INS treats
Rosales as though he has not been admitted into this country, and, legally,
he remains at &quot;the threshold of initial entry.&quot; Shaughnessy v.
United States ex rel. Mezei, 345 U.S. 206, 212, 73 S. Ct. 625, 97 L. Ed.
956 (1953). Therefore, he &quot;stands on a different footing&quot; than
an alien who has already passed through this nation's gates. Id.</P>

<P>2 Before examining the constitutional issue, the majority resolves several
other issues. First, the majority concludes that the district court possessed
jurisdiction to hear Rosales's claim and that this court has jurisdiction
to hear his appeal. Second, the majority finds that Rosales's appeal has
not been rendered moot by virtue of the INS issuing a Notice of Releasability.
Third, the majority concludes that the Attorney General and the INS do possess
the statutory authority to detain Rosales indefinitely. I agree with each
of these conclusions for the reasons set forth by the majority.</P>

<P>3 The majority finds no evidence that Congress intended to punish Rosales
and other excludable aliens by detaining them indefinitely. I agree with
this aspect of the majority's reasoning.</P>

<P>4 But see Ma, 208 F.3d at 824 (stating that &quot;it is 'not settled'
that excludable aliens have any constitutional rights at all&quot;); Kwong
Hai Chew v. Colding, 344 U.S. 590, 596 n.5, 73 S. Ct. 472, 97 L.Ed. 576
(1953) (quoting Bridges v. Wixon, 326 U.S. 135, 161, 65 S. Ct. 1443, 89
L.Ed. 2103 (1945) (Murphy, J., concurring) (&quot;'The Bill of Rights is
a futile authority for the alien seeking admission for the first time to
these shores.'&quot;)).</P>

<P>5 In Gisbert, the Fifth Circuit expressly rejected the position taken
by the majority herein that the indefinite detention of Mariel Cubans constitutes
punishment without a trial in violation of their substantive due process
rights. Gisbert, 988 F.2d at 1441-42.</P>

<P>6 When engaging in a substantive due process analysis, a court must begin
with &quot;a careful description of the asserted right.&quot; Reno v. Flores,
507 U.S. 292, 302, 113 S. Ct. 1439, 123 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1993). In the present
case, Rosales does not dispute the Attorney General's power to exclude him
or to detain him for a reasonable time to effect his return to Cuba. Rather,
he claims that, because Cuba refuses to accept him, his detention is indefinite,
and possibly permanent, thus constituting punishment without a trial. Rosales
contends, and the majority agrees, that he has a liberty interest in being
free from this type of detention. If his habeas petition is granted, however,
he will be awarded the very right that the government lawfully denied to
him as a result of his exclusion, namely the right to be at large in the
United States. Although Rosales characterizes his request as one to be released
from incarceration, the relief that he seeks is indistinguishable from a
request to be admitted into this country until his return to Cuba can be
arranged. As set forth more fully, supra, Rosales has no constitutional
right to be released into this country, and the government has an absolute
right to ensure his exclusion.</P>

<P>7 As noted, supra, the majority does not question the applicability of
the &quot;entry fiction,&quot; which treats Rosales as if he is being detained
at the border, despite his physical presence in the United States. Although
the entry fiction may appear to be draconian in operation, it has a humanitarian
purpose. The entry fiction is a compassionate response to the hardships
that surely would have befallen Rosales if INS representatives had prevented
him and other Mariel Cubans from bringing their boats ashore, as the government
unquestionably had the right to do. In other words, the United States lawfully
could have forced Rosales and the other Mariel Cubans to remain at sea,
where they almost certainly would have died from drowning, dehydration or
starvation. Instead, the government allowed Rosales and the others to come
ashore, under the entry fiction, which treats the Mariel Cubans as if they
are still at sea, and outside of U.S. territory, for immigration purposes.</P>

<P>8 The facts of Carrera-Valdez are similar to those of the present case.
The petitioner in Carrera-Valdez was a Mariel Cuban who was declared excludable
following his arrival in this country. Like Rosales, the petitioner in Carrera-Valdez
was released several times on immigration parole only to be taken into custody
after committing crimes here. He sought a writ of habeas corpus ordering
his release until he could be returned to Cuba. Carrera-Valdez, 211 F.3d
at 1047.</P>

<P>9 The majority cites Carrera-Valdez and Gisbert for the proposition that
the Attorney General has the statutory authority to detain an excludable
alien indefinitely, while failing to acknowledge that those cases also stand
for the proposition that an excludable alien has no constitutional right
to be free from indefinite detention.</P>

<P>10 Although the alien in Mezei had lived in the United States for approximately
25 years, he left this country in 1948, without authorization or reentry
papers, and resided in Hungary for 19 months. Mezei, 345 U.S. at 208, 214,
73 S. Ct. 625. In light of those facts, the Supreme Court had &quot;no difficulty
in holding respondent an entrant alien or 'assimilated to [that] status'
for constitutional purposes.&quot; Id. at 214, 73 S. Ct. 625 (quoting Kwong
Hai Chew v. Colding, 344 U.S. 590, 599, 73 S. Ct. 472, 97 L.Ed. 576 (1953)).</P>

<P>11 In fact, as noted above, the Supreme Court appeared to question whether
Mezei was even a true national security risk. Mezei, 345 U.S. at 216, 73
S. Ct. 625 (&quot;Whatever our individual estimate of [the policy mandating
Mezei's exclusion and indefinite detention] and the fears on which it rests,
respondent's right to enter the United States depends on the congressional
will, and courts cannot substitute their judgment for the legislative mandate.&quot;).</P>

<P>12 It is noteworthy that the Supreme Court did not even require the Attorney
General to divulge the evidence upon which he based his determination that
Mezei constituted a threat to national security. Mezei, 345 U.S. at 212,
73 S. Ct. 625. The Court's refusal to &quot;retry the determination of the
Attorney General&quot; by requiring such evidence to be revealed would be
peculiar if the absence of a substantive due process right turned upon exigencies
attributable to the Korean War. In other words, if the Supreme Court believed
that Mezei lacked a substantive due process right to be free from indefinite
detention only because of exigencies created by the Korean War, it seems
likely that the Court would have required the Attorney General to present
some evidence showing that those exigencies actually existed. The Court
did not do so, however, for at least two reasons. First, Mezei's confinement
was an act of exclusion, and the decision of the Attorney General to exclude
an alien is &quot;final and conclusive[.]&quot; Id. Second, Mezei's continued
exclusion on Ellis Island did not deprive him of any constitutional right,
not because of national security concerns and the Korean War, but because
he was treated as if detained outside of U.S. territory and, therefore,
he had no substantive due process rights. Id. at 215, 73 S. Ct. 625; see
also Ethan A. Klingsberg, Note, Penetrating the Entry Doctrine: Excludable
Aliens' Constitutional Rights in Immigration Processes, 98 Yale L.J. 639,
643-644 (1989) (recognizing that Mezei rests upon the &quot;principle that
an alien arrives at the border without an interest in the right to enter&quot;
and, as a result, lacks a liberty interest in freedom from immigration detention).
Consequently, the Attorney General's national security concerns were not
critical to the Mezei Court's substantive due process analysis, despite
the majority's assertion to the contrary.</P>

<P>13 In Verdugo-Urquidez, the Supreme Court reviewed several of the cases
cited by the majority herein. According to the Verdugo-Urquidez Court, those
cases stand for the proposition that aliens enjoy constitutional protections
once they enter the United States:</P>

<P>Verdugo-Urquidez also relies on a series of cases in which we have held
that aliens enjoy certain constitutional rights. See, e.g., Plyler v. Doe,
457 U.S. 202, 211-212, 102 S. Ct. 2382, 2391-92, 72 L.Ed.2d 786 (1982) (illegal
aliens protected by Equal Protection Clause); Kwong Hai Chew v. Colding,
344 U.S. 590, 596, 73 S. Ct. 472, 477, 97 L.Ed. 576 (1953) (resident alien
is a &quot;person&quot; within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment); Bridges
v. Wixon, 326 U.S. 135, 148, 65 S. Ct. 1443, 1449, 89 L.Ed. 2103 (1945)
(resident aliens have First Amendment rights); Russian Volunteer Fleet v.
United States, 282 U.S. 481, 51 S. Ct. 229, 75 L.Ed. 473 (1931) (Just Compensation
Clause of Fifth Amendment); Wong Wing v. United States, 163 U.S. 228, 238,
16 S. Ct. 977, 981, 41 L.Ed. 140 (1896) (resident aliens entitled to Fifth
and Sixth Amendment rights); Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356, 369, 6 S.
Ct. 1064, 1070, 30 L.Ed. 220 (1886) (Fourteenth Amendment protects resident
aliens). These cases, however, establish only that aliens receive constitutional
protections when they have come within the territory of the United States
and developed substantial connections with this country. See, e.g., Plyler,
supra, 457 U.S., at 212, 102 S. Ct., at 2392 (The provisions of the Fourteenth
Amendment &quot;'are universal in their application, to all persons within
the territorial jurisdiction . . .'&quot;) (quoting Yick Wo, supra, 118
U.S., at 369, 6 S. Ct., at 1070); Kwong Hai Chew, supra, 344 U.S., at 596,
n.5, 73 S. Ct., at 477, n.5 (&quot;The Bill of Rights is a futile authority
for the alien seeking admission for the first time to these shores. But
once an alien lawfully enters and resides in this country he becomes invested
with the rights guaranteed by the Constitution to all people within our
borders&quot;) (quoting Bridges, supra, 326 U.S., at 161, 65 S. Ct., at
1455 (concurring opinion) (emphasis added)). Respondent is an alien who
has had no previous significant voluntary connection with the United States,
so these cases avail him not.</P>

<P>Verdugo-Urquidez, 494 U.S. at 270-71.</P>

<P>14 Despite the fact that the Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments have
a &quot;territorial theme&quot; and, therefore, apply &quot;'to all persons
within the territory of the United States,'&quot; Plyler, 457 U.S. at 212,
102 S. Ct. 2382, some courts have held that excludable aliens may rely upon
the Constitution to challenge &quot;governmental action outside of the immigration
context.&quot; Fernandez-Roque v. Smith, 734 F.2d 576, 582 n.8 (11th Cir.
1984); see also Gisbert, 988 F.2d at 1442 (recognizing that excludable aliens
have a substantive due process right to be free from &quot;gross physical
abuse&quot;); but see Ma, 208 F.3d at 824 (&quot;[I]t is not settled that
excludable aliens have any constitutional rights at all [.]&quot;). Even
if excludable aliens may challenge governmental conduct outside of the immigration
context, however, the act of detaining an alien to effect his exclusion
from the United States constitutes governmental action within the immigration
context. As a result, excludable aliens such as Rosales have no substantive
due process right to be free from immigration detention. See, e.g., Ma,
208 F.3d at 824; Carrera-Valdez, 211 F.3d at 1048.</P>

<P>15 Preventing the INS from killing or torturing Rosales does not infringe
upon the government's plenary power to exclude aliens at our borders. Consequently,
as noted, supra, some courts have recognized that excludable aliens have
a protected liberty interest in not being physically abused. Preventing
the INS from indefinitely detaining Rosales in order to ensure his exclusion,
however, would interfere with the government's fundamental sovereign authority
to control its borders.</P>

<P>16 &quot;It is beyond dispute that aliens have no constitutional right
to be admitted into this county.&quot; Fernandez-Roque, 734 F.2d at 581
(quoting Landon, 459 U.S. at 32, 103 S. Ct. 321); see also Jean, 727 F.2d
at 972 (&quot;[E]xcludable aliens cannot challenge either admission or parole
decisions under a claim of constitutional right.&quot;). Immigration &quot;[p]arole
is an act of extraordinary sovereign generosity, since it grants temporary
admission into our society to an alien who would probably be turned away
at the border if he sought to enter by land, rather than coming by sea or
air.&quot; Id.</P>

<P>17 This is not to say that the Attorney General could detain Rosales
indefinitely if some other country were willing to accept him. Under those
circumstances, which do not exist here, his continued detention likely would
violate the Constitution. In other words, the United States lawfully may
detain Rosales in order to regulate its border and prevent him from entering,
but it cannot constitutionally prevent him from vacating the border and
going elsewhere. Notably, however, Rosales's habeas petition does not suggest
that he or his relatives, who are living in Florida, have arranged for him
to leave the United States. Instead, he wants to be released into this country.</P>

<P>18 The majority appears to find a substantive due process violation in
part because Rosales cannot be &quot;certain&quot; of receiving immigration
parole, regardless of how well he behaves while he is detained. Given that
Rosales has no right to enter this country at all, however, the fact that
he cannot be &quot;certain&quot; of being paroled into the United States
does not give rise to a substantive due process violation.</P>

<P>19 As the majority properly notes, Rosales alleged in his habeas petition
that he was deprived of his Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights (1) to
be represented by counsel at the parole hearing, (2) to review the information
used against him at that proceeding, and (3) to confront and cross-examine
witnesses. Rosales also alleged that the INS had miscalculated his parole
candidacy score. In particular, he alleged that the INS had improperly enhanced
his score to account for prior criminal offenses, not in violation of 8
C.F.R. &sect; 212.12, but rather in violation of the Federal Rules of Evidence,
Title 28 of the United States Code and the United States Sentencing Guidelines.
J.A. at 6-7. Rosales did allege in his habeas petition, however, that the
INS had violated 8 C.F.R.&sect; 212.12 by relying upon impermissible reasons
to support its denial of immigration parole. J.A. at 7. Although Rosales
does not appear to pursue this claim on appeal, it lacks merit in any event.
The INS denied Rosales immigration parole largely because it was unable
to conclude that he would not pose a threat to the community, as evidenced
by his recidivist criminal behavior. J.A. at 133. This explanation plainly
constitutes a proper basis to deny immigration parole. See 8 C.F.R. &sect;
212.12(d).</P>

<P>20 Insofar as Rosales's appellate brief might be read to assert a violation
of 8 C.F.R. &sect; 212.12, any such claim is belied by the record. Among
other things, he has been afforded periodic parole review, the services
of a translator during his parole interview, decisions translated into Spanish,
and notice of his right to have the assistance of a representative during
his parole interview. J.A. at 130-139. Although Rosales stresses that he
was not represented by counsel during the parole review process, &sect;
212.12 does not guarantee such a right. Furthermore, this court has recognized
that an excludable alien has &quot;no constitutional right to counsel at
his parole review hearings.&quot; Fernandez-Santana v. Chandler, 202 F.3d
268, 1999 WL 1281781 at *2 (6th Cir. December 27, 1999) (unpublished). Rosales
also contends that, as a result of a language barrier, he was unable &quot;to
understand or communicate in lay or legal terms with his keepers.&quot;
As noted above, however, Rosales was informed of his right to have a representative
assist with his parole interview. J.A. at 131.</P>

<P>OPINION</P>

<P>ALICE M. BATCHELDER, Circuit Judge.</P>

<P>Petitioner Reynero Arteaga Carballo, a Cuban citizen and national presently
detained at the Federal Correctional Institution at Memphis, whom the Immigration
and Naturalization Service (&quot;INS&quot;) adjudged excludable, filed
a pro se petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. &sect; 2241.
Petitioner challenges the Attorney General's constitutional and statutory
authority to continue his detention indefinitely following his completion
of a state court sentence and transfer to federal custody to effect his
deportation, which cannot occur in the foreseeable future because of the
state of relations between the United States and Cuba. Further, Petitioner
argues that his detention under these circumstances violates international
law. Because Carballo raised substantially the same arguments in a prior
petition, the district court ruled that the law of the case doctrine precluded
reaching the merits of Petitioner's claims. This timely appeal followed.
We will affirm the judgment of the district court, but for substantially
different reasons.</P>

<P>I. Statement of Facts</P>

<P>A. The 1980 Mariel Boatlift</P>

<P>Carballo came to the United States as one of the more than 125,000 undocumented
Cuban nationals who arrived during the &quot;Freedom Flotilla,&quot; originating
at the Cuban harbor of Mariel. In early April 1980, approximately 10,800
Cuban citizens claimed status as political refugees and sought sanctuary
in the Peruvian embassy in Havana. United States v. Frade, 709 F.2d 1387,
1389 (11th Cir. 1983). On April 14, 1980, President Carter declared that
up to 3,500 of those refugees would be admitted to the United States pursuant
to the Refugee Act of 1980 and allocated $4.25 million for their resettlement.
Id. (citing 45 Fed. Reg. 28,079 (Apr. 28, 1980)). Within three days of this
announcement, Castro halted flights to the United States and declared that
anyone wishing to leave the island could do so through the harbor of Mariel.
Id. The exodus of more than 125,000 Cubans, who crossed the ninety miles
of ocean between Cuba and the United States in nearly 1,800 boats, followed.
Alonso-Martinez v. Meissner, 697 F.2d 1160, 1161 (D.C. Cir. 1983).</P>

<P>Most of the Mariel Cubans arrived without visas or documents allowing
them legal entry into the United States. Fernandez-Roque v. Smith, 734 F.2d
576, 578 (11th Cir. 1984). Immigration officials detained these aliens at
the border and decided to exclude them from the United States.1 About 25,000
of the arriving aliens confessed to some criminal history in Cuba, and immigration
officials deemed roughly 2,000 of them to have backgrounds serious enough
to warrant continued detention. Palma v. Verdeyen, 676 F.2d 100, 101 (4th
Cir. 1982). The Attorney General paroled the remainder into the United States
pursuant to his broad discretion under 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1182(d)(5)(A). Though
no longer detained, the Cubans retained their legal status as excluded aliens
subject to deportation. Fernandez-Roque, 734 F.2d at 579. By the summer
of 1981, 122,000 Cuban aliens had been paroled. Palma, 676 F.2d at 101 n.1.</P>

<P>Despite Cuba's initial refusal to accept the return of the Mariel refugees,
Fernandez-Roque, 734 F.2d at 578, the United States has consistently taken
the position that international law obligates Cuba to accept its nationals
denied admission to the United States. Gisbert v. United States Attorney
Gen., 988 F.2d 1437, 1439 n.4 (5th Cir. 1993). On December 14, 1984, Cuba
agreed to the return of 2,746 named Mariel refugees at a rate of one hundred
per month in exchange for resumption of the normal processing of preference
immigration visas for Cuban nationals as had occurred in this country prior
to the Mariel boatlift. Garcia-Mir v. Smith, 469 U.S. 1311, 1312 (1985)
(Rehnquist, Circuit Justice). This list comprises individuals whom the INS
identified as possessing serious criminal backgrounds or mental infirmities
and does not, in the estimation of the State Department, constitute a definitive
or final group selected for repatriation. Alvarez-Mendez v. Stock, 746 F.
Supp. 1006, 1010 (C.D. Cal. 1990), aff'd, 941 F.2d 956 (9th Cir. 1991).
Cuba suspended the agreement in May 1985, but agreed at the end of 1987
to reinstate it. Gisbert, 988 F.2d at 1439 n.4. In 1994 and 1995 the United
States concluded additional agreements on migration matters with Cuba, and
the two nations have further agreed to additional discussions and have undertaken
ongoing negotiations over the return of Cuban nationals excludable from
the United States. As of February 4, 1999, the United States has returned
nearly 1,400 aliens named on the 1984 list to Cuba.</P>

<P>The Attorney General has promulgated regulations providing for annual
review of the cases of Mariel Cubans who remain in custody pending deportation
or removal to determine their suitability for immigration parole. 8 C.F.R.
&sect; 212.12 (2001). This process includes examination of each alien's
records and an interview by special review panels. Id. &sect; 212.12(d)(4).
Before recommending immigration parole a review panel must conclude, based
on consideration of the alien's record of criminal behavior, institutional
disciplinary record, mental health history, and ties to the United States,
that a detainee is: (1) nonviolent, (2) likely to remain nonviolent, (3)
unlikely to pose a threat to the community upon release, and (4) not likely
to violate any conditions of parole. Id. &sect; 212.12(d)(2) &amp; (3).
The review panels make recommendations to the INS's Associate Commissioner
for Enforcement (&quot;Associate Commissioner&quot;), who exercises authority
to grant immigration parole in his discretion. Id. &sect; 212.12(b) &amp;
(d)(4)(iii).</P>

<P>Cuba's reinstatement of the 1984 agreement in 1987 and the subsequent
resumption of repatriations sparked riots among detained Mariel Cubans,
resulting in at least one death and damages exceeding $100 million. Padron-Baez
v. Warden, FCI, Fairton, No. 95-320, 1995 WL 419799, at *1 (D.N.J. July
10, 1995). As a result, on December 28, 1987, the Attorney General authorized
a single, additional review of suitability for immigration parole by an
independent panel within the Department of Justice for Mariel Cubans detained.
8 C.F.R. &sect; 212.13 (1999) (removed from the Code of Federal Regulations
by Exec. Order No. 12,988, 65 Fed. Reg. 80,294 (Dec. 21, 2000)). Presently,
the United States holds approximately 1,750 Mariel Cubans in detention.
Chi Thon Ngo v. INS, 192 F.3d 390, 395 (3d Cir. 1999).</P>

<P>B. Petitioner's Criminal History</P>

<P>As far as state and federal authorities have been able to ascertain,
Carballo's criminal record in Cuba consists of: (1) a six-month prison term
in 1973 for being a Jehovah's Witness;2 (2) a three-month period of detention
for desertion from the army in 1975; and (3) his 1980 attempt to enter the
Peruvian embassy. The Castro government issued Carballo exit documents,
and he arrived in Florida with the wave of Mariel refugees on May 4, 1980.
After a brief detention, the INS placed Carballo on immigration parole.</P>

<P>Almost immediately upon his release into the United States, Carballo
developed a criminal record. His first arrest came on August 28, 1980, in
Dade County, Florida, for grand larceny, carrying a concealed weapon, and
carrying an unlicensed firearm. Although these charges were dismissed, Carballo's
criminal record continued to grow, comprising at least sixteen arrests by
early 1983 for crimes such as aggravated assault, burglary, battery, trespassing,
and possession of marijuana. In April 1983, a Florida court found Carballo
guilty of attempted first-degree murder, aggravated assault with a deadly
weapon, and robbery and imposed a sentence of eight years imprisonment for
attempted murder, eight years for robbery, and five years for aggravated
assault.</P>

<P>During Carballo's imprisonment, the INS conducted an investigation, revoked
his immigration parole, and determined to commence exclusion proceedings
upon his release from state custody. In February 1994, the INS formally
initiated exclusion proceedings, which an immigration judge concluded later
that year. The immigration judge ordered Carballo excluded and deported
for, among other things, having been convicted of a crime of moral turpitude
and of two or more offenses carrying an aggregate sentence of imprisonment
exceeding five years. Carballo did not appeal this decision. Since his release
from state custody, the INS has detained Carballo.</P>

<P>While in federal custody Carballo has developed a sizable disciplinary
record. Incident reports show that he has committed assault, threatened
bodily harm to a staff member, trespassed in an unauthorized area, and possessed
marijuana.</P>

<P>Pursuant to the regulations governing Mariel Cubans, the INS has reviewed
Carballo's case approximately annually to determine his suitability for
immigration parole into the United States. On each occasion, the reviewing
panel recommended against parole due to Carballo's lengthy criminal record,
ongoing disciplinary problems, his apparent disregard for his criminal history,
and his minimal participation in various programs in prison. Accordingly,
the Associate Commissioner of the INS has to date denied Carballo parole.
Neither Petitioner nor the government believes that Carballo's name appears
on the 1984 list of Mariel Cubans whom Cuba agreed to repatriate; but, because
that document remains classified, Center for Nat'l Sec. Studies v. Department
of State, No. 86-295, 1987 WL 17065 (D.D.C. Aug. 27, 1987), the record provides
no definitive evidence on the matter.</P>

<P>C. Carballo's First Habeas Petition</P>

<P>On September 6, 1990, Carballo filed a pro se petition for a writ of
habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. &sect; 2241 in the United States District
Court for the Northern District of Texas. This petition challenged the authority
of the Attorney General to continue the detention of an excludable alien
after passage of a reasonable time to effect deportation. Additionally,
Carballo argued that the continued denial of immigration parole occurred
without due process of law and that international law prohibited the conditions
and duration of his confinement.</P>

<P>Recognizing the plenary power of the political branches over immigration
matters, a magistrate judge recommended denial of Carballo's petition on
the ground that protection of the American public justified his continued
confinement. Further, the magistrate judge reasoned that Carballo had regularly
received all the process to which he is due through the INS's periodic review
of his case pursuant to the Mariel regulations. Finally, the magistrate
judge concluded that promulgation of these regulations displaced the public
law of nations so that international law did not control Carballo's case.
On November 26, 1991, the district court accepted the recommendation of
the magistrate judge and entered an order denying Carballo's petition for
a writ of habeas corpus. This order became final when Carballo failed to
appeal.</P>

<P>II. Jurisdiction and Standard of Review</P>

<P>Under 28 U.S.C. &sect; 2241 a petitioner may file a petition for a writ
of habeas corpus in the district court having jurisdiction over his custodian.
Charles v. Chandler, 180 F.3d 753, 756 (6th Cir. 1999) (per curiam). 8 U.S.C.
&sect; 1252(g) provides:</P>

<P>Except as provided in this section and notwithstanding any other provision
of law, no court shall have jurisdiction to hear any cause or claim by or
on behalf of any alien arising from the decision or action by the Attorney
General to commence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders
against any alien under this chapter.</P>

<P>Notwithstanding this broad language, which on its face would appear to
preclude judicial review of a habeas petition filed by an alien in Carballo's
circumstance absent congressional direction to the contrary, the Supreme
Court has concluded that section 2241 confers jurisdiction upon the federal
courts to entertain statutory and constitutional challenges to an alien's
detention following entry of an order of removal. Zadvydas v. Davis, 121
S. Ct. 2491, 2497-98 (2001). Therefore, we have jurisdiction to entertain
Petitioner's appeal. We review the denial of a petition for a writ of habeas
corpus de novo and the district court's factual findings for clear error.
Rogers v. Howes, 144 F.3d 990, 992 (6th Cir. 1998) (footnote omitted).</P>

<P>Based on the 1990 decision of a coordinate court, the district court
invoked the law of the case doctrine and dismissed Carballo's petition.
On appeal, Respondents urge affirmance on this ground or, in the alternative,
on the ground that Carballo has not demonstrated cause and prejudice to
justify consideration of a successive and abusive petition. We turn first
to the ground on which the district court denied Carballo's petition.</P>

<P>III. Law of the Case Doctrine</P>

<P>&quot;Under the doctrine of the law of the case, a decision on an issue
made by a court at one stage of a case should be given effect in successive
stages of the same litigation.&quot; United States v. Todd, 920 F.2d 399,
403 (6th Cir. 1990) (citing Christianson v. Colt Indus. Operating Corp.,
486 U.S. 800, 816 (1988)). Operation of this doctrine depends upon whether
a court previously decided on a rule of law. Christianson, 486 U.S. at 817.
Accordingly, the doctrine only applies to identical issues decided explicitly
or by necessary inference. Hanover Ins. Co. v. American Eng'g Co., 105 F.3d
306, 312 (6th Cir. 1997). Additionally, it applies with as much force to
the decisions of a coordinate court as to a court's own decisions. Christianson,
486 U.S. at 816.</P>

<P>Rather than constituting a limit to judicial power, the doctrine expresses
the general practice of courts to refuse to revisit settled matters. Messinger
v. Anderson, 225 U.S. 436, 444 (1912); Petition of U.S. Steel Corp., 479
F.2d 489, 494 (6th Cir. 1973). These principles govern when the doctrine
operates to give effect to the judgment of the same or a coordinate court;
they &quot;never block[] a higher court from examining a decision of an
inferior tribunal.&quot; In re Reliable Drug Stores, Inc., 70 F.3d 948,
951 (7th Cir. 1995). See also Christianson, 486 U.S. at 817-18 (explaining
that &quot;a district court's adherence to law of the case cannot insulate
an issue from appellate review&quot;). Nor can law of the case doctrine
bind an appellate court in reviewing the decisions of a lower court. Christianson,
486 U.S. at 817. Nonetheless, we have held that when a party fails to appeal
a prior decision the doctrine will bar appellate review at a successive
stage of the litigation:</P>

<P>The law-of-the-case doctrine bars challenges to a decision made at a
previous stage of the litigation which could have been challenged in a prior
appeal, but [was] not. See County of Suffolk v. Stone &amp; Webster Eng'g
Corp., 106 F.3d 1112, 1117 (2d Cir. 1997). A party who could have sought
review of an issue or a ruling during a prior appeal is deemed to have waived
the right to challenge that decision thereafter, for &quot;it would be absurd
that a party who has chosen not to argue a point on a first appeal should
stand better as regards the law of the case than one who had argued and
lost.&quot; Fogel v. Chestnutt, 668 F.2d 100, 109 (2d Cir. 1981).</P>

<P>United States v. Adesida, 129 F.3d 846, 850 (6th Cir. 1997).</P>

<P>Federal law treats each petition for a writ of habeas corpus as a separate
civil action, rather than as a continuation of the criminal appeals process.
See, e.g., United States v. Morgan, 346 U.S. 502, 505 n.4 (1954) (&quot;[The
writ of error coram nobis] is a step in the criminal case and not, like
habeas corpus where relief is sought in a separate case and record, the
beginning of a separate civil Proceeding.&quot;) (citing Kurtz v. Moffitt,
115 U.S. 487, 494 (1885)). For this reason, we think that law of the case
doctrine does not apply to second and successive petitions. Instead, a body
of law governing abusive and successive petitions provides a check on the
litigiousness of habeas petitioners. Therefore, we conclude that the district
court erred in declining to consider Carballo's petition on this ground.</P>

<P>IV. Successive and Abusive Habeas Petitions</P>

<P>Respondents argue in the alternative that the court ought to dismiss
the petition as successive and abusive. On appeal, Respondents maintain
that both the statutory modifications governing successive and abusive petitions
enacted in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Pub.
L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1217 (&quot;AEDPA&quot;), and abuse of the writ
doctrine present additional hurdles to consideration of the merits of Carballo's
petition.</P>

<P>Sections 105 and 106 of the AEDPA amended 28 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 2255
and 2244, respectively, to create a default rule requiring courts to dismiss
second or successive petitions except in certain limited circumstances.
By their terms neither of these &quot;gatekeeping provisions&quot; applies
to petitions filed under section 2241. In re Hanserd, 123 F.3d 922, 930
(6th Cir. 1997) (&quot;A &sect; 2241 motion would not be barred by the new
restrictions on successive motions and petitions.&quot;). Because section
2241 potentially allows a petitioner to evade these requirements, however,
courts have attempted to define circumstances under which the AEDPA's new
gatekeeping rules will bar a second or successive petition filed under section
2241. E.g., Charles, 180 F.3d at 757 (holding that a petitioner will receive
&quot;only one bite at the post-conviction apple&quot; unless he can show
either that he has newly discovered evidence or that a new rule of constitutional
law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court,
that was previously unavailable applies); United States v. Barrett, 178
F.3d 34, 57 (1st Cir. 1999) (allowing a petitioner asserting a claim of
actual innocence to use section 2241 to circumvent the gatekeeping provisions).</P>

<P>In the immigration context, section 2241 plays a somewhat different role
since neither section 2244 nor section 2255 applies to a petitioner who
is not in federal custody pursuant to a conviction in court. Section 2244(a)
provides:</P>

<P>No circuit or district judge shall be required to entertain an application
for a writ of habeas corpus to inquire into the detention of a person pursuant
to a judgment of a court of the United States if it appears that the legality
of such detention has been determined by a judge or court of the United
States on a prior application for a writ of habeas corpus, except as provided
in section 2255.</P>

<P>(Emphasis added). Because the INS continues to detain Carballo based
on administrative actions taken pursuant to the Mariel regulations, rather
than the judgment of a court, section 2244(a) by its own terms does not
govern his petition for a writ of habeas corpus. Barapind v. Reno, 225 F.3d
1100, 1111 (9th Cir. 2000). For similar reasons section 2255, limited to
&quot;prisoners in custody under sentence of a court,&quot; does not apply.
Accordingly, section 2241 provides the only avenue for Carballo to have
access to a federal court to challenge his continued custody. See INS v.
St. Cyr, 121 S. Ct. 2271, 2280 (2001) (&quot;At its historical core, the
writ of habeas corpus has served as a means of reviewing the legality of
executive detention[.]&quot;).</P>

<P>Of course, this conclusion does not mean that unlike petitioners proceeding
pursuant to sections 2254 or 2255, Carballo can expect a court to review
his claims in second or successive petitions without limit. In fact, although
section 2241 facially escapes the AEDPA's gatekeeping provisions, the general
principles underlying these recently enacted limitations on the issuance
of the writ inform a federal court's proper handling of second or successive
petitions. In interpreting the effect of the AEDPA on its power to grant
writs of habeas corpus filed as an original matter under section 2241, the
Supreme Court has concluded:</P>

<P>The new restrictions on successive petitions constitute a modified res
judicata rule, a restraint on what is called in habeas corpus practice &quot;abuse
of the writ.&quot; In McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U.S. 467 (1991), we said that
&quot;the doctrine of abuse of the writ refers to a complex and evolving
body of equitable principles informed and controlled by historical usage,
statutory developments, and judicial decisions.&quot; Id. at 489. The added
restrictions which the Act places on second habeas petitions are well within
the compass of this evolutionary process[.]</P>

<P>Felker v. Turpin, 518 U.S. 651, 664 (1996). Accordingly, even though
the gatekeeping provisions do not expressly apply in the section 2241 context,
&quot;they certainly inform our consideration of original habeas petitions.&quot;
Id. at 663. See also Barapind, 225 F.3d at 1111; Gray-Bey v. United States,
209 F.3d 986, 990 (7th Cir. 2000) (&quot;[A] court in which a petition under
&sect; 2241 is filed must treat the new successive-petition rules as guideposts.&quot;).</P>

<P>Beyond these general principles the state of the law in the circuits
remains unsettled regarding the circumstances under which a petitioner may
bring a second or successive petition for a writ of habeas corpus under
section 2241. We need not settle the matter today because, no matter what
the standard, the doctrine of successive and abusive petitions bars consideration
of Carballo's petition.</P>

<P>A. Second and Successive Petitions under the AEDPA</P>

<P>Under section 2241(a) as amended by the AEDPA, federal courts can only
entertain second or successive petitions under the terms prescribed by section
2255. 28 U.S.C. &sect; 2255 allows consideration of a second or successive
petition in two limited circumstances: (1) when a petitioner presents newly
discovered evidence sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence
that no finder of fact would have found the petitioner guilty; or (2) in
the case of a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases
on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable.
Neither of these exceptions to the AEDPA's limitations on second and successive
petitions applies here. Therefore, under the AEDPA's standard, we could
not entertain Carballo's petition.</P>

<P>B. Traditional Successive Petition Doctrine</P>

<P>Notwithstanding Carballo's failure to satisfy all of the formal prerequisites
for consideration of his second petition under the strictures of the AEDPA,
we could arguably consider Carballo's claims under the traditional successive
petition doctrine since the new gatekeeping provisions of the AEDPA merely
&quot;inform,&quot; rather than control, consideration of a second or successive
petition under section 2241. Under the pre-AEDPA standard, when a court
has denied a prior application for a writ of habeas corpus, that judgment
will bar successive petitions if: (1) the earlier petition presented the
same ground for relief, (2) the prior determination was on the merits, and
(3) reaching the merits of a successive petition would not serve the ends
of justice. Sanders v. United States, 373 U.S. 1, 15 (1963); Lonberger v.
Marshall, 808 F.2d 1169, 1173 (6th Cir. 1987). Under the &quot;ends of justice&quot;
component of this standard, an applicant can file a successive petition
&quot;upon showing an intervening change in the law.&quot; Sanders, 373
U.S. at 16-17. See also Lonberger, 808 F.2d at 1174.</P>

<P>In light of this court's recent decision in Rosales-Garcia v. Holland,
238 F.3d 704 (6th Cir. 2001) (holding that indefinite detention violates
the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment), we must consider whether
&quot;an intervening change in the law&quot; allows consideration of Carballo's
petition. For the reasons that follow, we think that the Supreme Court's
subsequent opinion in Zadvydas v. Davis, 121 S. Ct. 2491 (2001), fatally
undermines the authority of Rosales-Garcia. Accordingly, we conclude that
even under the Sanders standard, Carballo's petition is barred.</P>

<P>1. The Statutory Basis for Carballo's Detention</P>

<P>We begin our analysis by examining whether the statute pursuant to which
the INS continues to detain Petitioner authorizes indefinite detention.
See, e.g., Crowell v. Benson, 285 U.S. 22, 62 (1932) (&quot;When the validity
of an act of the Congress is drawn in question, and even if a serious doubt
of constitutionality is raised, it is a cardinal principle that this Court
will first ascertain whether a construction of the statute is fairly possible
by which the question may be avoided.&quot;) (footnote omitted). Prior to
enactment of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility
Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009 (&quot;IIRIRA&quot;), 8
U.S.C. &sect; 1226(e) authorized the Attorney General to detain excludable
aliens indefinitely. That section provided:</P>

<P>(1) Pending a determination of excludability, the Attorney General shall
take into custody any alien convicted of an aggravated felony upon release
of the alien (regardless of whether or not such release is on parole, supervised
release, or probation and regardless of the rearrest or further confinement
in respect of the same offense).</P>

<P>(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the Attorney
General shall not release such felon from custody unless the Attorney General
determines that the alien may not be deported because [a country &quot;upon
request denies or unduly delays acceptance of the return of any alien who
is a citizen . . . thereof.&quot; 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1253(g)].</P>

<P>(3) If the determination described in paragraph (2) has been made, the
Attorney General may release such alien only after-</P>

<P>(A) a procedure for review of each request for relief under this subsection
has been established,</P>

<P>(B) such procedure includes consideration of the severity of the felony
committed by the alien, and</P>

<P>(C) the review concludes that the alien will not pose a danger to the
safety of other persons or to property.</P>

<P>8 U.S.C. &sect; 1226(e) (1994) (emphasis added). In short, former section
1226(e) unambiguously authorized the Attorney General to retain custody
of an excludable alien convicted of an aggravated felony unless he first
determined both that the alien's native land has unduly denied or delayed
deportation and that the alien will not pose a danger to the safety of people
or property.</P>

<P>Congress enacted this provision in the Immigration Act of 1990, Pub.
L. No. 101-649, &sect; 504(b), 104 Stat. 4978, 5050. This statutory amendment
took effect on November 29, 1990, and does not apply retroactively. Nonetheless,
its provisions govern Carballo's petition for a writ of habeas corpus. In
Alvarez-Mendez v. Stock, 941 F.2d 956 (9th Cir. 1991), the court considered
the effect of the enactment of section 1226(e) on the habeas petition of
a Mariel Cuban whom, like Carballo and all similarly situated aliens, the
INS had adjudged excludable in 1980. The court concluded that section 1226(e)
governed petitions filed after its effective date even in the case of an
alien determined to be excludable prior to that date.</P>

<P>Although the new section 1226(e) does not retroactively authorize any
of the Attorney General's acts accomplished prior to the amendment, we are
concerned here only with the legality of Alvarez-Mendez's present detention.
Because this case involves a petition for the writ of habeas corpus, and
not a claim for damages for illegal detention, the only issue before us
is whether Alvarez-Mendez's detention is illegal today. Therefore, even
if his detention was illegal prior to the 1990 Act, if that Act gives the
Attorney General the authority to hold Alvarez-Mendez today, his present
custody is not illegal and habeas corpus is not available.</P>

<P>Id. at 960. Since the Ninth Circuit offered this interpretation of former
section 1226(e), other circuits that have considered whether it governs
the detention of aliens found excludable prior to its enactment have concluded
that it does. Ho v. Greene, 204 F.3d 1045, 1054-55 (10th Cir. 2000); Gisbert,
988 F.2d at 1446. We have adopted this interpretation. Rosales-Garcia, 238
F.3d at 715-16.3</P>

<P>Accordingly, former section 1226(e) provides the statutory basis for
the INS's continued detention of Petitioner. Since immigration law without
question defines Carballo's convictions as aggravated felonies within the
meaning of former section 1226(e),4 Petitioner faces potentially indefinite
detention.</P>

<P>2. Former Section 1226(e) and the Supreme Court's Decision in Mezei</P>

<P>The overwhelming majority of circuits that have considered whether the
former section 1226(e) constitutionally authorizes the indefinite detention
of excludable aliens have upheld the statute. Carrera-Valdez v. Perryman,
211 F.3d 1046 (7th Cir. 2000); Chi Thon Ngo v. INS, 192 F.3d 390 (3d Cir.
1999); Guzman v. Tippy, 130 F.3d 64 (2d Cir. 1997) (per curiam); Barrera-Echavarria
v. Rison, 44 F.3d 1441 (9th Cir. 1995) (en banc); Gisbert v. United States
Attorney Gen., 988 F.2d 1437 (5th Cir. 1993). See also Fernandez-Rocque
v. Smith, 734 F.2d 576 (11th Cir. 1984) (rejecting constitutional challenges
to indefinite detention arising from the denial or revocation of immigration
parole); Palma v. Verdeyen, 676 F.2d 100 (4th Cir. 1982) (concluding that
Congress had implicitly authorized the Attorney General to detain excludable
aliens indefinitely).</P>

<P>Courts upholding the constitutionality of the Attorney General's authority
to detain excludable aliens indefinitely rely principally on Shaughnessy
v. United States ex rel. Mezei, 345 U.S. 206 (1953) (5-4 decision). In Mezei,
the Supreme Court considered whether the Attorney General's permanent exclusion
of an alien without a hearing constituted unlawful detention. Id. at 207.
Having immigrated to the United States as a child, Mezei left the country
in 1948 to visit his dying mother in Romania. Unable to obtain entry, he
stayed in Hungary for over eighteen months and then attempted to return
to the United States. Upon Mezei's arrival at Ellis Island, an immigration
inspector ordered his temporary exclusion, which the Attorney General made
permanent without a hearing on the basis of secret, undisclosed information
that Mezei posed a security threat to the United States. Attempts to locate
another nation to which Mezei could emigrate proved unsuccessful, and he
challenged his detention on Ellis Island by seeking a writ of habeas corpus.</P>

<P>Recognizing the power to exclude aliens as a sovereign prerogative largely
immune from judicial review, the Court noted that Congress had authorized
the President through the Attorney General to impose additional restrictions
on the entrance of aliens &quot;during periods of international tension
and strife.&quot; Id. at 210. That authority allowed the Attorney General
to exclude aliens on the basis of confidential information without a hearing;
therefore, the lawfulness of Mezei's detention turned on the constitutionality
of this authority. Id. at 210-11. Although aliens legally or illegally within
the United States enjoy limited due process protections when the government
seeks to expel them, the Court distinguished their circumstances from those
of an excluded alien who, even if paroled into the United States, remains
at the threshold of initial entry by operation of law. Id. at 212-13. For
such aliens, Congress defines all the process that is due. Id. at 212. Because
executive action under this authority is final and conclusive, &quot;it
is not within the province of any court, unless expressly authorized by
law, to review the determination of the political branch of the Government.&quot;
Id. That Mezei remained indefinitely detained at Ellis Island, in the Court's
estimation, did not alter his status as excludable or deprive him of any
statutory or constitutional right. Id. at 215-16. Finally, the national
security implications of Mezei's case justified a higher degree of caution
than the typical case in which the Attorney General releases a resident
alien pending proceedings to effect deportation. Id. at 216.</P>

<P>On the authority of Mezei, most courts have had little trouble turning
aside habeas petitions brought by Mariel Cubans or other excludable aliens
facing the prospect of indefinite or extended detention, albeit reaching
this result with some variations in their reasoning. Some courts have construed
the INS's Mariel regulations as establishing a series of one-year periods
of detention followed by an opportunity to seek immigration parole. E.g.,
Barrera-Echavarria, 44 F.3d at 1450. Other courts have deferred to the plenary
power of the Congress to regulate immigration and of the President to conduct
foreign affairs. E.g., Carrera-Valdez, 211 F.3d at 1047-48. As for substantive
due process, courts have found both that indefinite detention does not constitute
punishment because of the government's underlying legitimate interest in
protecting its citizens, Gisbert, 988 F.2d at 1442, and that Congress, not
the Fifth Amendment, defines the extent of protections for excludable aliens,
who after all are not-as a matter of law-within the United States. Guzman,
130 F.3d at 66; Palma, 676 F.2d at 103 (quoting Knauff v. Shaughnessy, 338
U.S. 537, 544 (1950)). Additionally, these courts have ruled that the Immigration
and Nationality Act (&quot;INA&quot;), the INS's Mariel regulations, and
the Supreme Court's decision in Mezei all displace international law. E.g.,
Guzman, 130 F.3d at 66. As one court summarized the view of the majority
of circuits:</P>

<P>[C]ase law holds there is no constitutional impediment to the indefinite
detention of an alien with a criminal record under a final order of exclusion,
deportation, or removal if (1) there is a possibility of his eventual departure;
(2) there are adequate and reasonable provisions for the grant of parole;
and (3) detention is necessary to prevent a risk of flight or a threat to
the community.</P>

<P>Chi Thon Ngo, 192 F.3d at 397.</P>

<P>Until recently only the Tenth Circuit had departed from the position
taken by the majority of circuits in reliance on Mezei. In Rodriguez-Fernandez
v. Wilkinson, 654 F.2d 1382 (10th Cir. 1981) (2-1 decision), the court considered
the habeas petition of a Mariel Cuban at a time prior to promulgation of
the Mariel regulations or the enactment of statutory authority for the Attorney
General to detain an excludable alien indefinitely in section 1226(e). There,
the Attorney General classified Rodriguez-Fernandez as suitable for immigration
parole, but nonetheless continued his detention based on a governmental
stay of all parole releases pending review of the entire situation created
by the Mariel exodus without making an individualized determination of whether
parole of Rodriguez-Fernandez was practicable or possible. Construing the
applicable statute as authorizing only temporary detention for a reasonable
period to negotiate and effect deportation, the court sought to avoid what
it considered serious constitutional problems by deciding the case on an
interpretation of the INA. Id. at 1386, 1390. Declining to draw a distinction
between excluded aliens, regarded as standing at the border, and resident
aliens, id. at 1387 n.3, the court ruled that excluded aliens enjoy the
full protections of the Fifth Amendment:</P>

<P>Thus, it would appear that an excluded alien in physical custody within
the United States may not be &quot;punished&quot; without being accorded
the substantive and procedural due process guarantees of the Fifth Amendment.
Surely Congress could not order the killing of Rodriguez-Fernandez and others
in his status on the ground that Cuba would not take them back and this
country does not want them . . . . Certainly imprisonment in a federal prison
of one who has been neither charged nor convicted of a criminal offense
is a deprivation of liberty in violation of the Fifth Amendment, except
for the fiction applied to these cases that detention is only a continuation
of the exclusion.</P>

<P>Id. at 1387 (footnote omitted). Further, the court did not regard Mezei
as controlling because of the particular facts presented there, namely the
national security risks attending the Korean War and the government's continuing
efforts to deport Mezei. Id. at 1388. Because of the serious constitutional
issues lurking in the background, the court preferred to decide Rodriguez-Fernandez's
petition on statutory grounds. Id. at 1389-90.</P>

<P>Subsequent promulgation of the Mariel regulations and Congress's enactment
of former section 1226(e) in the Immigration Act of 1990 have abrogated
the Tenth Circuit's holding in Rodriguez-Fernandez. Not only have several
other circuits so recognized, e.g., Carrera-Valdez, 211 F.3d at 1048, but
the Tenth Circuit itself recently disavowed the constitutional analysis
of Rodriguez-Fernandez as dicta on this basis. Ho, 204 F.3d at 1057.</P>

<P>3. Rosales-Garcia</P>

<P>In Rosales-Garcia v. Holland, 238 F.3d 704 (6th Cir. 2001) (2-1 decision),
this court reversed the district court's denial of a habeas petition brought
by a Mariel Cuban.5 After concluding that former section 1226(e) expressly
granted the Attorney General the authority to detain an excludable alien
indefinitely, id. at 715-16, the court discounted the government's reliance
on Mezei for two reasons. First, the court recognized that the Supreme Court
had subsequently extended &quot;to aliens basic Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth
Amendment protections.&quot; Id. at 719. Second, the court limited Mezei
to its facts by emphasizing the national security aspect of the case and
the background of the Korean War. Id. at 719-21. Based on this reading of
Mezei, the court &quot;emphatically reject[ed] the government's premise
that excludable aliens are completely foreign to the Fifth Amendment of
the Constitution.&quot; Id. at 721. Because the INS could neither execute
nor torture an excludable alien constitutionally, the court declined &quot;to
draw a line of constitutional dimension between the act of torturing an
excludable alien and the act of imprisoning such an alien indefinitely&quot;
because &quot;aliens-even excludable aliens-are 'persons' entitled to the
Constitution's most basic protections and strictures.&quot; Id.</P>

<P>Having then proceeded to the conclusion that the indefinite detention
of an excludable alien violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment,
id. at 726-27, the court announced a test for determining whether the federal
government's diplomatic efforts with an alien's home nation suffice to justify
continued detention. Id. at 725. Notwithstanding the Tenth Circuit's abrogation
of its decision in Rodriguez-Fernandez, the court concluded by adopting
the reasoning of that case in support of its holding:</P>

<P>We agree with the Tenth Circuit that when an alien's home country refuses
to accept him, it appears that &quot;detention is [] used as an alternative
to exclusion rather than a step in the process of returning petitioner to
his native Cuba.&quot; Rodriguez-Fernandez v. Wilkinson, 654 F.2d 1382,
1386 (10th Cir. 1981); cf. Chi Thon Ngo, 192 F.3d at 398 (&quot;It is []
unrealistic to believe that these INS detainees are not actually being 'punished'
in some sense for their past conduct.&quot;). We conclude, therefore, that
Rosales's detention has crossed the line from permissive regulatory confinement
to impermissible punishment without trial.</P>

<P>Id. at 726-27. In short, Rosales-Garcia rests upon two critical assumptions:
(1) the distinction in immigration law between excludable and deportable
aliens has no constitutional significance; and (2) Mezei no longer controls
the constitutional analysis of indefinite detention, at least for excludable
aliens.</P>

<P>4. The Supreme Court's Decision in Zadvydas v. Davis</P>

<P>After this court decided Rosales-Garcia, the Supreme Court considered
the constitutionality of the indefinite detention of resident aliens in
Zadvydas v. Davis, 121 S. Ct. 2491 (2001). Announcing that construction
of an ambiguous post-IIRIRA statute to authorize indefinite detention would
raise serious constitutional problems, the Court read 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1231(a)(6)
as limiting post-removal-period detention &quot;to a period reasonably necessary
to bring about that alien's removal from the United States.&quot; Id. at
2498. The Court reasoned that because the Due Process Clause of the Fifth
Amendment applies to all persons within the United States, whether in the
country legally, illegally, temporarily, or permanently, &quot;[t]he serious
constitutional problem arising out of a statute that, in these circumstances,
permits an indefinite, perhaps permanent, deprivation of human liberty without
[adequate procedural protections] is obvious.&quot; Id. at 2500.</P>

<P>The statute before the Court in Zadvydas-section 1231(a)(6)-is not the
statute at issue in this case. Interpreting section 1231(a)(6), the Zadvydas
Court concluded that indefinite detention of a resident alien would pose
serious constitutional problems, but carefully distinguished the situation
of excludable aliens, whom the law regards as standing at-but outside-the
border. At the outset of the opinion, the Court limited the issue before
it so as to except excludable aliens from its analysis:</P>

<P>We deal here with aliens who were admitted to the United States but subsequently
ordered removed. Aliens who have not yet gained initial admission to the
country would present a very different question.</P>

<P>Id. at 2495 (emphasis added).</P>

<P>When the Court discussed the constitutional principles guiding its decision,
it discussed Mezei at length and concluded that the case offered the government
no support. Id. at 2500-01. But, unlike Rosales-Garcia and Rodriguez-Fernandez,
which read Mezei as a relic of the Cold War, the Supreme Court in Zadvydas
affirmed the vitality of the case-at least for excludable aliens:</P>

<P>Although Mezei, like the present cases, involves indefinite detention,
it differs from the present cases in a critical respect . . . . His presence
on Ellis Island did not count as entry into the United States. Hence, he
was &quot;treated,&quot; for constitutional purposes, &quot;as if stopped
at the border.&quot; [Mezei, 345 U.S.] at 213, 215. And that made all the
difference.</P>

<P>Id. at 2500. Turning to the fundamental difference in immigration law
between excludable and deportable aliens, the Court recognized that this
distinction has constitutional significance. &quot;It is well established
that certain constitutional protections available to persons inside the
United States are unavailable to aliens outside of our geographic borders.&quot;
Id. (citing United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez, 494 U.S. 259, 269 (1990),
and Johnson v. Eisentrager, 339 U.S. 763, 784 (1950)). Furthermore, &quot;once
an alien enters the country, the legal circumstance changes, for the Due
Process clause applies to all 'persons' within the United States, including
aliens . . . .&quot; Id. at 2500-01 (citations omitted). Since the law regards
excludable aliens as standing outside our borders, the Fifth Amendment can
offer them no protections. 6</P>

<P>Put another way, the Court in Zadvydas declined to extend the analysis
of Mezei, which concerned the indefinite detention of an excludable alien,
to aliens who have already attained entry into the United States. For this
reason, the Zadvydas Court recognized that Mezei embodies &quot;a basic
territorial distinction&quot; that precluded the government from relying
on the case when defending the constitutionality of the indefinite detention
of resident aliens. Id. at 2501. Because the Court concluded that the status
of an alien does have constitutional significance, it declined to entertain
arguments that subsequent developments in the law had undermined the authority
of Mezei. Id.</P>

<P>5. Application of the Sanders Standard</P>

<P>From the Supreme Court's discussion in Mezei of the constitutional principles
implicated by indefinite detention of aliens, two things are clear. First,
the Court regards the distinction between excludable and deportable aliens
in immigration law as having constitutional significance. Id. at 2500-01.
Moreover, from a constitutional perspective, everything turns on this distinction
because once an alien enters the United States &quot;the legal circumstance
changes, for the Due Process Clause applies[.]&quot; Id. at 2500. On this
point the Court's opinion in Zadvydas is fundamentally at odds with this
court's decision in Rosales-Garcia, which emphasized that &quot;aliens-even
excludable aliens-are 'persons' entitled to the Constitution's most basic
protections and strictures&quot; and which &quot;emphatically reject[ed]
the government's premise that excludable aliens are completely foreign to
the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution.&quot; 238 F.3d at 721. Second,
Mezei remains good law, and its principles continue to govern the constitutional
analysis of the indefinite detention of excludable aliens. Zadvydas, 121
S. Ct. at 2495, 2500-01. This conclusion also conflicts with the position
this court took in Rosales-Garcia limiting Mezei to its facts. 238 F.3d
at 719-21. For these reasons, we conclude that our prior decision in Rosales-Garcia
cannot survive the Supreme Court's decision in Zadvydas and that under the
analysis of Mezei the Fifth Amendment does not present an obstacle to the
potentially indefinite detention of an excludable alien. 7</P>

<P>Even under the more generous standard of Sanders for determining whether
a court can consider a second or successive petition for a writ of habeas
corpus, Carballo, then, cannot establish that a change in the law has intervened
so as to allow our consideration of his petition under the &quot;ends of
justice&quot; component of the standard. Since the United States District
Court for the Northern District of Texas previously rejected on the merits
a petition asserting the same grounds for relief, the Sanders standard accords
that petition preclusive weight. Sanders, 373 U.S. at 15; Lonberger, 808
F.2d at 1173.</P>

<P>V. Conclusion</P>

<P>Whether we apply the standard of Sanders or the gatekeeping provisions
of the AEDPA, Petitioner's application for a writ of habeas corpus constitutes
a second petition, and our consideration of it is barred. Therefore, we
affirm the judgment of the district court.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>1 Immigration law draws a fundamental distinction between excludable
aliens, those who seek admission but have not been granted entry to the
United States and are considered detained at the border as a matter of law,
and deportable aliens, those who have gained entry to the United States,
whether legally or illegally. Sale v. Haitian Ctrs. Council, Inc., 509 U.S.
155, 159 &amp; n.5 (1993). Since enactment of the Illegal Immigration Reform
and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat.
3009 (&quot;IIRIRA&quot;), &quot;excludable&quot; aliens are now denominated
&quot;inadmissible,&quot; and a process of &quot;removal&quot; has replaced
&quot;deportation.&quot; 8 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 1182 &amp; 1229a.</P>

<P>2 Some evidence in the record indicates that Carballo adopted this faith
to aid his avoidance of military service in Cuba.</P>

<P>3 The IIRIRA further amended section 1226(e) and created new statutory
bases for detention of aliens; but, because section 309(c)(1) of the IIRIRA
limits these amendments to removal proceedings initiated after its effective
date of April 1, 1997, they have no effect on this action.</P>

<P>4 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1101(a)(43), as in effect prior to enactment of the
IIRIRA, defined &quot;aggravated felony&quot; to include &quot;any crime
of violence (as defined in section 16 of Title 18, not including a purely
political offense) for which the term of imprisonment imposed . . . is at
least 5 years.&quot; In turn, 18 U.S.C. &sect; 16(a) defines &quot;crime
of violence&quot; as &quot;an offense that has as an element the use, attempted
use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property
of another.&quot; Carballo's eight-year sentences for attempted murder and
robbery and his five-year sentence for aggravated assault satisfy this definition.</P>

<P>5 Prior to the decision in Rosales-Garcia, this circuit had upheld the
constitutionality of indefinite detention only in unpublished opinions of
no precedential value. See Garcia-Arena v. Luttrell, No. 99-6505, 2000 WL
1827855 (6th Cir. Dec. 8, 2000); Betancourt v. Chandler, No. 99-5797, 2000
WL 1359634 (6th Cir. Sept. 14, 2000); Laetividad v. INS, No. 99-5245, 1999
WL 1282432 (6th Cir. Dec. 27, 1999); Fernandez-Santana v. Chandler, No.
98-6453, 1999 WL 1281781 (6th Cir. Dec. 27, 1999); Marrero-Montes v. United
States, No. 98-5378, 1998 WL 808255 (6th Cir. Nov. 10, 1998); Gonzalez v.
Luttrell, No. 96-5098, 1996 WL 627717 (6th Cir. Oct. 29, 1996).</P>

<P>6 We do not, of course, mean to imply that the United States has license
to torture or summarily execute excludable aliens. See, e.g., Zadvydas,
121 S. Ct. at 2505-06 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (concluding that while excludable
aliens cannot be tortured or subjected to hard labor without a judicial
trial, &quot;neither prohibition has anything to do with their right to
be released into the United States.&quot;); accord Lynch v. Cannatella,
810 F.2d 1363 (5th Cir. 1987) and Rodriguez-Fernandez, 654 F.2d 1382.</P>

<P>7 We note that Justice Kennedy filed a dissent in Zadvydas in which he
suggested that our decision in Rosales-Garcia, which he deemed to employ
reasoning &quot;remarkably similar to the majority's,&quot; &quot;would
seem a necessary consequence&quot; of the majority's opinion. 121 S. Ct.
at 2513 (Kennedy, J., dissenting). In light of the affirmation of Mezei
and the Court's express disavowal in Zadvydas that its analysis in any way
applied to excludable aliens, we respectfully disagree with Justice Kennedy's
suggestion.</P>

<P>Civil Action No. 98-286<BR>
</P>

<P>MARIO ROSALES-GARCIA, PETITIONER</P>

<P>v.</P>

<P>J.T. HOLLAND, WARDEN, RESPONDENT</P>

<P>[Filed: May 3, 1999]</P>

<P>MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER</P>

<P>This matter stands submitted before the Court for consideration of the
petition of Mario Rosales-Garcia, pro se, for writ of habeas corpus, pursuant
to 28 U.S.C. &sect; 2241. The respondent has filed a response [Record No.
12], to which the petitioner has replied [Record No. 16].</P>

<P>BACKGROUND OF THE PETITION</P>

<P>On or about May 1, 1980, the petitioner came to the United States from
Cuba during the Mariel boatlift. By May 20, he had been granted immigration
parole into the United States and released from custody to the sponsorship
of a relative in Miami, Florida [Response Exhibits (all hereinafter Ex.)
at p. 1-2]. By the following October of 1980, the petitioner's lengthy criminal
history in the United States began with what became a series of arrests.
Although the petitioner was placed on probation for the first infractions,
later criminal activity resulted in several convictions and the imposition
of sentences. His first conviction was in July 1981; later convictions in
the 1980's included grand theft in 1983 and escape in 1985. His immigration
parole was revoked on July 10, 1986. Ex. 6.</P>

<P>After a hearing before an immigration judge in Atlanta, Georgia, on June
26, 1987, the petitioner was found excludable and ordered excluded from
the United States. Ex. 65-70.</P>

<P>The petitioner was approved for immigration parole for a second time
on April 22, 1988, and was released on May 20, 1988. However, he again engaged
in criminal conduct and in 1993 was convicted of conspiracy to traffic in
cocaine in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of
Wisconsin. While serving his federal sentence, the INS lodged a detainer
against him. On March 24, 1997, prior to his release scheduled for May,
he was reviewed (Ex. 34) and the decision was made to revoke his second
immigration parole and detain him in INS custody upon release from his sentence.
Accordingly, upon his release in May of 1997, he was returned to the custody
of the INS.</P>

<P>The INS conducted another review pursuant to the parole review procedures
for Mariel Cubans at 8 C.F.R. &sect; 212.12 in November of 1997, and on
December 12, 1997, the INS Associate Commissioner for Enforcement denied
the petitioner immigration parole. His decision (Ex.131-32) noted the petitioner's
recidivist criminal behavior when twice previously granted immigration parole
into the United States and concluded that the Commissioner was unable to
conclude that petitioner would not violate again or would not pose a threat
to the community. See Ex. 129-43. This decision was served on the petitioner
on February 11, 1998.</P>

<P>BACKGROUND OF THE CASE</P>

<P>On July 9, 1998, Rosales-Garcia filed the instant petition for writ of
habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &sect; 2241. He challenges the March
24, 1997, decision to revoke his prior parole and his continued detention
as being (1) in violation of his Fifth Amendment due process rights, including
a right to assistance of counsel, a prior opportunity to review information
which would be considered at his hearing, and his right to confront and
cross-examine a witness who would provide such information; (2) contrary
to INS governing regulations, 8 C.F.R. &sect; 212.12-.13; and (3) based
on a point score violative of his rights under 28 U.S.C. &sect; 609(b) and
U.S.S.G. A1.2(e)(1) because the score includes points for prior convictions
which were both extremely old, 1983 and 1986 convictions, and which involved
extremely short sentences. He attached a two-page memorandum of law to the
petition.</P>

<P>On October 1, 1998, the Court dismissed the petition, sua sponte, concluding
that the petitioner's due process rights were not grounded in the Constitution
and the Cuban Review Panel's rules and regulations and other authority cited
by the petitioner also did not entitle him to the due process safeguards
or results he asserted [Record No. 3]. The petitioner then filed a motion
to alter and amend [Record No. 5], stating that the due process he intended
to argue was not that arising under the Constitution but under 8 U.S.C.
&sect; 1101, &sect; 1105a and the provisions of 5 U.S.C. &sect; 551-701,
et seq., as well as well-known Supreme Court precedents. Noting its obligation
to liberally construe the pro se submissions, the Court vacated its earlier
decision and ordered [Record No. 6] a response to the petition.</P>

<P>RESPONSE</P>

<P>In the response [Record No. 12], the respondent first contends that this
Court's initial dismissal was correct and that the petitioner's contentions
since that time do not require a different result. He asserts that the petitioner
has failed to distinguish his claims from those already rejected by the
courts, including the Sixth Circuit, in a case attached to the response,
Gonzalez v. Luttrell, 100 F.3d 956, 1996 WL 627717 (6th Cir.1996) (Table,
unpublished) (affirming the decision from the Eastern District of Kentucky,
the Honorable Jennifer B. Coffman, presiding) [Attachment (all hereinafter
Att.) No. 1]. In March and November of 1997, the petitioner received the
regulatory review for parole, was appropriately denied in the discretionary
authority of the Attorney General, and will continue to receive the annual
reviews called for under 8 C.F.R. &sect; 212.12(g)(2).</P>

<P>The respondent begins his legal arguments with the caution that judicial
review of immigration matters is extremely limited, the power to exclude
aliens being a fundamental sovereign attribute exercised by political branches,
citing Kleindienst v. Mandel, 408 U.S. 753 (1972), and Shaughnessy v. United
States ex rel. Mezei, 345 U.S. 206 (1953). Therefore, historically the courts
have accorded deference in these matters, the respondent citing to numerous
cases in various circuits. He also points to recent legislation which has
further limited judicial review, most recently in the Illegal Immigration
Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (&quot;IIRIRA&quot;).1</P>

<P>As to the petitioner's specific arguments, the respondent contends that
the petitioner has no entitlement to parole or the due process safeguards
he lists. He again relies on the old Kleindienst and Mezei cases and multiple
cases since that time, holding that an alien seeking admission to this country,
even temporarily, has no constitutional rights regarding his application.
Nor is there any other source from which an enforceable liberty interest,
hence due process rights, would flow. Aliens have only those rights which
have been extended to them; Congress has placed aliens' parole in the total
discretion of the Attorney General in 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1182(d)(5)(A); detention
of aliens by the Attorney General is also specifically provided for under
other statutes; and 8 C.F.R &sect; 212.12 sets out what process is due.
The respondent contends that the instant petitioner receives all the process
he is due so long as he receives the procedures contained therein on an
annual basis and that the petitioner's cited cases to the contrary are distinguishable.</P>

<P>The respondent also refutes the petitioner's contention that he is entitled
to the adversarial process in the revocation of his parole. Such is not
required by the Constitution; the regulatory process, 8 C.F.R. 212.12, which
has been upheld in previous constitutional challenges; or the statutes relied
upon by the petitioner. Finally, the respondent urges that the petitioner
has failed to show an abuse of discretion, not only legally, but also factually,
when the record includes the petitioner's admitted criminal acts; his later
violations of conditions of parole; his reviews under the regulatory procedures;
and the Commissioner's use of pertinent factors and conclusions.</P>

<P>REPLY</P>

<P>The petitioner has filed a reply [Record No. 16] in which he repeats
and expands on his prior arguments. In addition to claiming that aliens
have the asserted procedural due process rights, he contends that the action
of the Attorney General in revoking and/or denying him parole constitutes
an arbitrary abuse of governmental power, in violation of his substantive
due process rights. He submits that certain 1998 and 1999 cases from other
circuits support this argument.</P>

<P>DISCUSSION</P>

<P>Background</P>

<P>First, the Court, like the immigration laws themselves and the response
herein, distinguishes the language used to differentiate between alien statuses
legally. Those undocumented aliens arriving like the Mariel Cubans are immediately
inadmissible or &quot;excludable.&quot; Those excludable aliens who have
been through proceedings and had an order of exclusion entered have been
deemed &quot;excluded.&quot; Neither have ever been admitted. An &quot;entry
fiction&quot; provides that even if an excludable alien is physically present
in the United States, legally he is considered to have been detained at
the border and never effected entry into this country.2 He may be allowed
to physically enter the country on parole initially, pending a later hearing
on admissibility, or later, after a decision that he will not be admitted
but removed. However, entry on parole is not an admission. Because he was
inadmissible or excludable upon arrival, an alien, such as the instant petitioner,
often retains the &quot;excludable&quot; descriptor in case law, even if
he has been ordered excluded.</P>

<P>A brief historical perspective is also in order.3 Approximately 125,000
Mariel Cubans arrived in this country in May of 1980, seeking admission.
Except for those the U.S. government determined to pose a threat, such as
those with serious criminal records or severe mental illnesses, for whom
continued detention was ordered, the vast majority of the arrivals were
released on immigration parole as excludable aliens pursuant to the usual
procedures in 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1182(d)(5). The petitioner was in this majority.</P>

<P>The United States' position then and now has been that Cuba is required,
as a matter of international law, to take back its nationals who are denied
admission here. In December of 1984, the United States and Cuba entered
into &quot;the migration agreement,&quot; wherein Cuba agreed to accept
2,746 detained Mariel Cubans at the rate of 100 per month. These were specific
persons who either had been kept in detention since arrival in 1980 or whose
immigration parole had been revoked between 1980 and the 1984 agreement.
Obviously, this agreement did not cover Mariel Cubans whose immigration
parole was revoked and inadmissability determined after 1984, such as the
instant petitioner. Nor have any subsequent agreements named him as one
permitted to return.4</P>

<P>In the years after the 1984 agreement, subsequent parole revocations
caused a growing number of Mariel Cubans to be detained in United States
facilities. In December of 1987, the Attorney General created a new plan
for reviewing them for a subsequent parole. The Cuban Review Plan (hereinafter
&quot;the Plan&quot;), 8 C.F.R. &sect;&sect; 212.12-.13, under which the
petitioner's possible parole must be determined, has applied from 1987 to
the present day, with minimal amendments. The regulations specifically provide
that the procedures apply to all detained Mariel Cubans, those excludables
and those already ordered to be excluded (8 C.F.R. &sect; 212.12(a)), and
set out in detail the review procedures to be used. Most importantly, &sect;
212.12(g) provides for a Mariel Cuban's consideration for parole initially
when immigration parole is revoked and subsequently every year thereafter.</P>

<P>Jurisdiction of this Court</P>

<P>The Court begins with the issue of its authority to review the immigration
parole decisions of the Attorney General. Contending that this Court lacks
jurisdiction to review the discretionary parole decision(s) herein, the
respondent cites to changes in judicial review wrought by the IIRIRA in
several sections, including codifications at 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1252, &sect;
1231(h), and conflicting case law interpreting the issue to date. At most,
the respondent suggests, the scope of habeas review, if permissible, is
limited to constitutional and statutory issues.</P>

<P>The Court first notes that several provisions in 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1252,
which is entitled &quot;Judicial review of orders of removal,&quot; reflect
Congress' intention to place all authority in the Attorney General and divest
this court of jurisdiction to review his decisions.5 The Court also notes
that 8 U.S.C. &sect; U.S.C. 1226(e) (West 1998), entitled &quot;Apprehension
and detention of aliens,&quot; also now explicitly provides:</P>

<P>(e) Judicial review</P>

<P>The Attorney General's discretionary judgment regarding the application
of this section shall not be subject to review. No court may set aside any
action or decision by the Attorney General under this section regarding
the detention or release of any alien or the grant, revocation, or denial
of bond or parole.</P>

<P>8 U.S.C. &sect; 1226(e). Thereafter, 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1231, entitled &quot;Detention
and removal of aliens ordered removed,&quot; contains a sweeping provision
in subsection (h).6</P>

<P>Whether viewed one by one or cumulatively, Congress' changes to immigration
law contained in both the IIRIRA and the Antiterrorism and Effective Death
Penalty Act (&quot;AEDPA&quot;)7, effective earlier in 1996, have whittled
away at the judicial review available to aliens. However, do any one or
all of these provisions strip this Court of its power to review under federal
habeas corpus law? The Court of Appeals in this circuit initially rejected
the argument that the new legislation had stripped the Court of this jurisdiction
in Mansour v. I.N.S., 123 F.3d 423, 425 (6th Cir. 1997). Presented with
an alien seeking judicial review of a deportation order, the Court upheld
the constitutionality of the provision barring direct judicial review of
a final deportation order, 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1105a(a)(10) (1996), under the
rationale that &quot;judicial involvement in the form of habeas review remains
available.&quot; However, not having been presented with a habeas petition,
it specifically reserved for another day the issue of the scope of review
that remains available on a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. Id. at
426, n.3.</P>

<P>As the respondent notes, the cases are in conflict on the issue of the
Court's jurisdiction after Congress' latest immigration amendments.8 Obviously,
the case law as to AEDPA and IIRIRA provisions will be developing over time.
At this time, as the district court concluded in Oliva v. INS, 1999 WL 61818
(S.D. NY 1999), in the absence of further clarification from the Court of
Appeals in this circuit or from the Supreme Court, this Court finds that
it has jurisdiction to entertain a petition for habeas corpus under &sect;
2241. Id. at *3. Therefore, the Court will examine all of the issues raised
in the instant &sect; 2241 habeas petition to determine if the petitioner
is being held in violation of any laws of the United States.</P>

<P>Statutory Claims</P>

<P>The Court begins its analysis on the merits of the petitioner's claims
with an examination of the overall immigration and naturalization scheme.
Under the Constitution of the United States, control over such matters is
vested in the political branches. U.S. Const. Art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 4. Congress
has granted total discretionary authority to the Attorney General in Title
8. Aliens and Nationality, Chapter 12-Immigration and Nationality, Subchapter
1, at 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1103, which begins</P>

<P>(a) Attorney General</P>

<P>(1) The Attorney General shall be charged with the administration and
enforcement of this chapter and all other laws relating to the immigration
and naturalization of aliens, except insofar as this chapter or such laws
relate to the powers, functions, and duties conferred upon the President,
the Secretary of State, the officers of the Department of State, or diplomatic
or consular officers: Provided, however, that determination and ruling by
the Attorney General with respect to all questions of law shall be controlling.</P>

<P>8 U.S.C. &sect; 1103(a)(1) (West Supp. 1998). This statutory delegation
of power and discretion to the Attorney General has been unchanged since
its enactment in 1952. Included in this power is the decision whether to
parole inadmissible or &quot;excludable&quot; aliens, contained in 8 U.S.C.
&sect; 1182.9 It and the regulation governing reparoles, 8 C.F.R. &sect;
212.5(d)(2), have been only minimally amended in recent years.10 With some
of the changes, the application of prior or later versions of some statutes
matter little. See 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1226.11</P>

<P>Other statutes, particularly those still relied upon by the petitioner,
have undergone substantial change over recent years,12 but that change is
not in the petitioner's favor. The most recent of these changes were contained
in the IIRIRA, which reorganized and amended immigration laws significantly,13
particularly with regard to the Attorney General's detention of aliens.</P>

<P>Among the changes are specific provisions dealing with this petitioner's
situation. In 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1226, now entitled &quot;Apprehension and
detention of aliens,&quot; virtually every paragraph makes clear the Attorney
General's power to detain excludable aliens. It begins with the Attorney
General's power to arrest, detain, and then release excludable aliens, on
bond or conditional parole, pending a decision on removal. 8 U.S.C. &sect;
1226(a) (West 1998). The following subsection, (b), provides that the Attorney
General may revoke parole and detain an alien &quot;at any time.&quot; 8
U.S.C. &sect; 1226(c). &quot;Detention of criminal aliens,&quot; discussed
supra at footnote 11, explicitly requires the Attorney General to take aliens
with criminal convictions into custody upon their release and permits release
thereafter only as called for in the statute.14</P>

<P>Also, 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1231 (West Supp. 1998), &quot;Detention and removal
of aliens ordered removed,&quot; provides that after an order of removal,
the Attorney General has a 90-day removal period, in which to effect removal
and, during that period, &quot;the Attorney General shall detain the alien.&quot;
Moreover, subsection (d)(1)(A), now specifically provides for prolonged
detention &quot;beyond the removal period,&quot; with no cap on the time
limit to do so, if the excludable or one ordered removed &quot;has been
determined by the Attorney General to be a risk to the community or unlikely
to comply with the order of removal.&quot; Id. at (a)(6).15</P>

<P>The petitioner contends he relies upon 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1101, the definition
section of the chapter. However, that statute does not support any argument
of the petitioner and, in fact, specifically provides that immigration parole
is not an admission to the United States in 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1101(a)(13)(B)
(West Supp. 1998). To the extent he relies upon 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1105a, &quot;Judicial
review of orders of deportation and exclusion,&quot; it also is not applicable
to his arguments about parole because the petitioner did not appeal the
exclusion order against him.&quot;16 The petitioner's current reliance on
these statutes, together with his original reliance on the equally inapplicable
28 U.S.C. &sect; 609(b) and sentencing guidelines, is unfounded. Also, the
Administrative Procedures Act does not apply to immigration proceedings.
Ardestani v. INS, 502 U.S. 129, 133 (1991).</P>

<P>The Court finds that the Attorney General's authority is not diminished
by recent legislation. The Court also finds its conclusions in Gonzalez
v. Luttrell and those of other courts, prior to any statutory changes, still
apply. &quot;Because an alien who has not been paroled must by definition
be detained, and because Congress has certainly been aware that deportation
cannot in all cases be immediately effected, it seems difficult not to conclude
that the statutory scheme implicitly authorizes prolonged detention.&quot;
Barrera-Echavarria v. Rison, 44 F.3d 1441, 1446 (9th Cir.), cert. denied,
516 U.S. 976 (1995).17 Especially after the most recent immigration law
changes, which provide for prolonged detention and set no time limits, the
Attorney General may continue to detain the instant petitioner in conformity
with federal law. See Guzman v. Tippy, 130 F.3d 64 (2nd Cir. 1997); Perez-Diago
v. True, 1999 WL 51821 (D. KS 1999).</P>

<P>Constitutional Claims</P>

<P>The Court also finds no change in the law with regard to the petitioner's
constitutional claims since its rejection of this contention in Gonzalez
v. Luttrell.</P>

<P>The Sixth Amendment is not implicated, because &quot;immigration proceedings
and detention do not constitute criminal proceedings or punishment.&quot;
Ramos v. Thornburgh, 761 F. Supp. 1258, 1260 (W.D LA 1991) (citing INS v.
Lopez-Mendoza, 468 U.S. 1032, 1038 (1984)). Accord, In re Mariel Cuban Habeas
Corpus Petitions, 822 F. Supp. 192, 196 (M.D. PA. 1993); Barrios v. Thornburgh,
754 F. Supp. 1536, 1542 (W.D. OK 1990); Sanchez v. Kindt, 752 F. Supp. 1419,
1430-31 (S.D. IN 1990). &quot;It has been recognized that excludable aliens
are entitled to some protections under the Sixth Amendment. However, those
protections are only available to those excludable aliens who face criminal
prosecution.&quot; In re Cuban, 822 F. Supp. 192, 196 (M.D. PA 1993) (citing
U.S. v. Gavilan, 761 F.2d 226 (5th Cir. 1985) (right to effective counsel)).</P>

<P>Nor does the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution provide excludable aliens
with due process rights with regard to admission or parole. Aliens such
as the petitioner enjoy only those rights which Congress extends. Landon
v. Plasencia, 459 U.S. 32 (1982). See also Pena v. Thornburgh, 770 F. Supp.
1153, 1160 (E.D. Tex. 1991) (Mariel Cuban detainee &quot;entitled to only
the due process which Congress has provided to him&quot;). This Court finds
no basis for petitioner's assertion he enjoys a liberty interest in freedom
from detention secured by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.
The Court finds no validity in the petitioner's contention that his liberty
interests springs from other sources, such as the policy of parole in 8
C.F.R. &sect;&sect; 212.12 or 212.5, public opinion, other even more vague
sources. See the discussion of other sources, considered one by one, in
Sanchez v. Kindt, 752 F. Supp. at 1427-1420; see also Garcia-Mir v. Smith,
766 F.2d 1478, 1451 (11th Cir. 1985), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1022 (1986).</P>

<P>In the petitioner's Reply [Record No. 16], he argues strongly that it
is substantive due process which has been violated in his case; i.e., his
indefinite incarceration is an act of the government shocking to the conscience
of the Court and this Court should fashion an appropriate remedy. He cites
not only to cases focusing on the importance of fundamental substantive
due process rights, but also to a few 1998 and 1999 cases purportedly standing
for the proposition that even excludable aliens have the right not to be
subjected to an arbitrary abuse of governmental power.</P>

<P>While the law is clear that excludable aliens have only the procedural
due process rights afforded by Congress, the law is less clear about the
extent to which any substantive due process rights are enjoyed by excludable
aliens. The case of Gisbert v. U.S. Attorney General denied the substantive
due process claim of an excludable alien. 988 F.2d at 1447. But see also
Doherty v. Thornburgh, 943 F.2d 204, 209 (2nd Cir. 1991) (&quot;[T]he Supreme
Court has questioned the extent to which aliens possess substantive rights
under the Due Process Clause.&quot;).</P>

<P>The cases cited by the petitioner are clearly distinguishable.18 More
helpful cases are Ncube v. INS District Directors and Agents, 1998 WL 842349
(S.D. NY 1998) (slip opinion); and Tam v. INS, 14 F. Supp. 2d 1184 (E.D.
CA 1998), which, although reaching different conclusions about inadmissible
aliens' substantive due process rights, reflect the proper analysis. In
conformity therewith, this Court finds that the instant petitioner has not
presented a substantive due process claim. He has no fundamental right to
be free to roam the United States and a fundamental right is the first component
of a substantive due process claim. This Court also finds that, based on
the petitioner's record, his continued detention is neither arbitrary, conscience-shocking
nor oppressive in the constitutional sense and that this Court's intervention
is inappropriate. Moreover, the Sixth Circuit has recently expressed the
view that &quot;[a]pplying the 'shock the conscience' test in an area other
than excessive force . . . is problematic.&quot; Pearson v. City of Grand
Blanc, 961 F.2d 1211, 1217 (6th Cir. 1992) (quoting Cassady v. Tackett,
938 F.2d 693, 698 (6th Cir. 1991); see also Pusey v. City of Youngstown,
et al., 11 F.3d 652, 657 (6th Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 114 S. Ct. 2742
(1994). Therefore, the petitioner's substantive due process claim must also
fail.</P>

<P>To repeat, &quot;[w]hatever the procedure authorized by Congress is,
it is due process as far as an alien denied entry is concerned.&quot; United
States ex rel. Knauff v. Shaughnessy, 338 U.S. at 544. Therefore, this Court
examines the Attorney General's Cuban Review Plan, contained at 8 C.F.R.
&sect; 212.12-.13, as the due process which must be afforded the petitioner
on an annual basis. Gisbert, 988 F.2d at 1443; Rodriguez v. Thornburgh,
831 F. Supp. 810, 813 (D. KS 1993). These detailed procedures still need
not and do not comport with either the Fifth or the Sixth Amendment safeguards,
which the petitioner asserts should have been afforded him, e.g., prior
opportunity to review information against him, an opportunity to face and
cross-examine people who provide information, and/or right to counsel.</P>

<P>Rather, the Cuban Review Plan,19 as previously discussed, calls for a
detained alien to be considered for parole at least once per year. 8 C.F.R.
&sect; 212.12(g)(2). Therefore, the petitioner's characterization that his
detention has been for an indefinite period of time is misleading. To the
contrary, he has had and will continue to have an opportunity on an annual
basis to show that since the prior review he would no longer constitute
a danger to society if paroled. His detention is not indefinite but is for
only one year at a time; at the end of each year he has an opportunity to
plead his case anew. Barrera-Echavarria, 44 F.3d at 1450.</P>

<P>In each review for parole consideration, both initially and annually
every year thereafter, the Plan lists specific factors which must be taken
into consideration, including the detainee's past history of criminal behavior,
and certain criteria which must be met, including conclusions that the detainee
is nonviolent, not likely to violate parole conditions, and not likely to
be a threat to the community. Id. at (d)(2) and (d)(3). The procedures begin
with a review of the detainee's file by either the Director of the Cuban
Review Plan or a panel. 8 C.F.R. &sect; 212.12(d)(4)(i). If parole is not
recommended, then the alien is entitled to a personal interview by a panel.
Id. at (d)(4)(ii). At this interview, the alien may have someone accompany
him, and he may submit any oral or written information he wishes. Id. The
panel issues a written recommendation, including a brief statement of the
factors it deemed material, to the Commissioner, who will consider it, together
with the file material, in the exercise of the discretion granted her/him
at 8 C.F.R. &sect; 212.12(b). Id. at &sect; 212.12(d)(4)(iii). These procedures
have withstood constitutional challenges many times and this Court is in
accord with the rationale in Gisbert v. U.S. Attorney General, 988 F.2d
at 1442-44.</P>

<P>The remaining question is whether the instant petitioner was given the
process he was due. Government exhibits reveal that the instant petitioner
was considered for parole upon release from his federal sentence and was
reviewed again before the end of that calendar year. In each review, pursuant
to 8 C.F.R. &sect; 212.12, he received consideration by panel members; personal
interviews; specific findings with regard to the relevant factors and criteria;
and written decisions, in Spanish and English, showing the reasons for the
decisions to deny him parole. Regardless of the complained of point count
contained in the first panel's recommendation (Ex. 34), the parole decision
was made by the designated commissioner, who has the discretion to accept
or reject the recommendation.</P>

<P>Therefore, the petitioner's claim that his confinement is in contravention
of his due process rights will be dismissed. Consistent therewith and in
consideration of statutory amendments, this Court finds no violation of
federal immigration law or of the United States Constitution.</P>

<P>CONCLUSION</P>

<P>For the foregoing reasons, this Court concludes that the petitioner has
not demonstrated that he is being held in custody in violation of the Constitution
or laws or treaties of the United States. Accordingly, the Court being advised,
IT IS ORDERED that the petition of Mario Rosales-Garcia for writ of habeas
corpus is DENIED and judgment shall be entered contemporaneously with this
memorandum opinion in favor of the respondent.</P>

<P>1 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996
(&quot;IIRIRA&quot;), Sept. 30, 1996, Pub. L. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009.</P>

<P>2 See Barrera-Echavarria v. Rison, 44 F.3d 144, 150 (9th Cir. 1995) (en
banc), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 976 (1995). At the time of Barrera-Echavarria
and the time of this petitioner's exclusion proceedings, before the IIRIRA,
there were distinctions between &quot;exclusion&quot; and &quot;deportation&quot;
proceedings, but these are now all removal proceedings, set out in 8 U.S.C.&sect;&sect;
1229 and 1229a (West Supp. 1998). &quot;Removable&quot; is now used for
aliens who are inadmissible or &quot;excludable,&quot; and for those admitted
and then considered deportable. 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1229a(e)(2) (West Supp.1998).</P>

<P>3 The Court finds the historical discussion in Padron-Baez v. Warden,
FCI, Fairton, 1995 WL 419799 (D.NJ 1995) (Not reported in F. Supp.) helpful
and summarizes it briefly.</P>

<P>4 Among the attachments to the response is the declaration of Michael
E. Ranneberger, Coordinator, Office of Cuban Affairs, in the United States
Department of State, regarding immigration discussions with Cuban officials,
beginning in 1980 and continuing to the present. Mr. Ranneberger states
that in 1984, the two governments agreed to the return of 2,746 of the criminals
who arrived from Mariel; as of February 1999, 1,400 of them have been returned.
Since the 1984 agreement was not a final list, the officials have met periodically
to discuss immigration matters, including the return of Cuban nationals
convicted of serious crimes and ordered excluded. Further agreements were
reached in 1994 and 1995; and the most recent round of talks took place
December 4, 1998. Mr. Ranneberger describes these as sensitive diplomatic
exchanges which he cannot reveal, but he can confirm that the return of
such nationals remains under discussion between the two governments. Att.
3.</P>

<P>5 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1252(a)(2)(West Supp. 1998) contains two applicable
provisions:</P>

<P>(B) Denials of discretionary relief</P>

<P>Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no court shall have jurisdiction
to review-</P>

<P>(1) any judgment regarding the granting of relief under</P>

<P>&sect; 1182(h) . . .</P>

<P>(2) any other decision or action of the Attorney General, the authority
for which is specified under this chapter to be in the discretion of the
Attorney General, other than the granting of relief under &sect; 1158(a)
of this title.</P>

<P>(C) Orders against criminal aliens</P>

<P>Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no court shall have jurisdiction
to review any final order of removal</P>

<P>against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed a criminal
offense covered in section 1182(a)(2) or 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), (B), (C), or
(D) of this title, or any offense covered by section 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii) of
this title for which both predicate offenses are, without regard to their
date of commission, otherwise covered by section 1227(a)(2)(A)(i) of this
title.</P>

<P>Also, at 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1252(g), the statute provides that &quot;no
court shall have jurisdiction to hear any cause or claim by or on behalf
of any alien arising from the decision or action by the Attorney General
to commence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders against
any alien under this chapter.&quot;</P>

<P>6 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1231(h) (West Supp. 1998), reads as follows: &quot;Nothing
in this section shall be construed to create any substantive or procedural
right or benefit that is legally enforceable by any party against the United
States or its agencies or officers or any other person.&quot;</P>

<P>7 Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (&quot;AEDPA&quot;),
Apr. 24, 1996, Pub. L. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214.</P>

<P>8 For additional discussions of whether the district courts retain habeas
jurisdiction, after the statutory changes of AEDPA and/or IIRIRA, see Ncube
v. INS District Directors and Agents, 1998 WL 842349 (S.D.NY 1998) (slip
opinion at p.7-8); Rusu v. Reno, 999 F. Supp. 1204, 1210 (N.D. IL 1998);
Hermanowski v. Farquharson, ___F. Supp. 2d___, 1999 WL 111520 (D. RI 1999),
slip op. at *5.</P>

<P>9 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1182(d)(5)(A)(1998), relied upon by the respondent,
provides that the &quot;Attorney General may . . . in [her] discretion parole
into the United States temporarily under such conditions as [she] may prescribe
only on a case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian resons or significant
public benefit any alien applying for admission to the United States, but
such parole of such alien shall not be regarded as an admission of the alien
and when the purposes of such parole shall, in the opinion of the Attorney
General, have been served the alien shall forthwith return or be returned
to the custody from which he was paroled and thereafter his case shall continue
to be dealt with in the same manner as that of any other applicant for admission
to the United States.&quot;</P>

<P>10 The Court notes that 8 C.F.R. &sect; 212.5 (1998) was last amended
63 FR 31895, June 11, 1998 and at subsection (d)(2)(i) it has been expanded
to provide that for aliens whose parole had terminated or been terminated
&quot;[i]f the exclusion, deportation, or removal order cannot be executed
by removal within a reasonable time, the alien shall again be released on
parole unless in the opinion of the district director or the chief patrol
agent the public interest requires that the alien be continud in custody.&quot;
Subsection (f) referring Cuban nationals to 8 C.F.R. &sect; 212.12 and .13,
is unchanged.</P>

<P>11 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1226(e)(1994), applying to aliens whose exclusion
proceedings commenced prior to April 1, 1997, such as the instant petitioner,
required the Attorney General to take into custody an excludable alien convicted
of an aggravated felony upon release of the alien from his criminal sentence.
The current statute (West 1998), now entitled &quot;apprehension and detention
of aliens,&quot; provides a new subsection, (c), for criminal aliens' detention
and possible subsequent parole; however, the Attorney General's obligation
to take them into custody is the same.</P>

<P>12 In addition to the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility
Act of 1996 (&quot;IIRIRA&quot;), Sept. 30, 1996, Pub. L. 104-208, 110 Stat.

WL 88922 (Feb. 24, 1999).</P>

<P>14 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1226(c)(2) (West 1998) provides as follows:</P>

<P>The Attorney General may release an alien described in paragraph (1)
only if [1] the Attorney General decides pursuant to section 3521 of Title
18, that release of the alien from custody is necessary to provide protection
to a witness, a potential witness, a person cooperating with an investigation
into major criminal activity, or an immediate family member or close associate
of a witness, potential witness, or person cooperating with such an investigation,
and [2] the alien satisfies the Attorney General that the alien will not
pose a danger to the safety of other persons or of property and is likely
to appear for any scheduled proceeding. A decision relating to such release
shall take place in accordance with a procedure that considers the severity
of the offense committed by the alien. (Emphasis added.)</P>

<P>15 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1231(a)(6) (West Supp. 1998) provides in its entirety:</P>

<P>(6) Inadmissible or criminal aliens</P>

<P>An alien ordered removed who is inadmissible under section 1182 of this
title, removable under section 1227(a)(1)(C), 1227(a)(2), or 1227(a)(4)
of this title or who has been determined by the Attorney General to be a
risk to the community or unlikely to comply with the order of removal, may
be detained beyond the removal period and, if released, shall be subject
to the terms of supervision in paragraph (3).</P>

<P>16 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1105a(a)(10) (West Supp. 1998) now reads: &quot;Any
final order of deportation against an alien who is deportable by reason
of having committed [any of certain enumerated crimes characterized as an
aggravated felony or a firearms offense] shall not be subject to review
by any court.&quot;</P>

<P>To the extent the petitioner intends to rely on an earlier version providing
that &quot;any alien held in custody pursuant to an order of deportation
may obtain judicial review thereof by habeas corpus proceedings,&quot; (8
U.S.C. &sect; 1105a(1)(10) (1995)), &sect; 306(b) of the IIRIRA repealed
the previous &sect; 1105a, in its entirety, and replaced it with the current
judicial review provisions of 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1252, discussed supra, at
p. [178a-179a].</P>

the criminal conviction of an alien for reentry into the United States after

deal with aliens at all, but a state parolee who was reincarcerated because
the state had made a mistake.</P>

<P>19 The overall framework of the Plan places the discretion of the Attorney
General in an Associate Commissioner for Enforcement (&quot;the Commissioner&quot;)
or his designate. 8 C.F.R. &sect; 212.12(b). If his decision is to continue
to detain the alien, he must set forth the reasons; and if his decision
is to grant parole, he may impose appropriate conditions. Id.; see subsection
(f) for required and acceptable conditions. To carry out his duties, the
Plan calls for appointment of a Director, who is to maintain files and designate
panels to make parole recommendations to the Commissioner. Id. at (c). The
panels consist of two INS professionals; if the two members are split as
to a recommendation, a third member is added and a majority determines the
recommendation. Id. at (d)(1).</P>

<P>v.</P>

<P>MARK LUTTRELL, ET AL.<BR>
RESPONDENTS<BR>
</P>

<P>ORDER DENYING<BR>
REYNERO ARTEAGA CARBALLO'S PETITION FOR WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS<BR>
</P>

<P>Before the court is Reynero Arteaga Carballo's petition for writ of habeas
corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C.</P>

<P>&sect; 2241. Carballo, a convicted felon, is a citizen of Cuba who arrived
in the United States during the 1980 Marial [sic] boatlift. In the present
motion, petitioner challenges both his continued detention as an excludable
alien and the Immigration and Naturalization Service's (&quot;INS&quot;)
refusal to grant him discretionary immigration parole. Because the court
finds that petitioner has previously had the opportunity to fully litigate
the issues raised in the present petition, the court denies Carballo's petition
for habeas relief.</P>

<P>Petitioner came to the United States in May 1980, as part of the Marial
[sic] boatlift, a group of 125,0000 undocumented Cuban aliens many of who
admitted to criminal activity in Cuba. Cuba intially refused to accept the
return of any Marial [sic] Cubans, and upon their arrival in the United
States, all but a very few were released on immigration parole. To date,
only a few Marial [sic] aliens have been repatriated.</P>

<P>Petitioner was on parole when, on April 25, 1983, he was convicted of
attempted murder in the first degree, aggravated assault with deadly weapon,
and robbery. He was sentenced to eight years imprisonment for attempted
murder, eight years for robbery, and five years for aggravated assault.
(Resp. Ex. A at 95-120). The record further indicates that during the time
petitioner was on immigration parole (approximately May 1980-April 1983),
he was arrested sixteen times. (Id. at 25-95). At various times, petitioner
was arrested for grand larceny, forgery, possession of burglary tools, trespassing,
possession of marijuana, resisting arrest with violence, battery, burglary,
possessing stolen property, possessing weapons to commit a felony, strong
arm robbery, and homicide. (Id.).</P>

<P>On November 25, 1983, as a result of April 23, 1983 convictions, petitioner's
immigration parole was revoked and a notice was issued charging petitioner
with excludability as an alien convicted of crimes involving moral turpitude.
(Id. at 128). The INS initiated exclusion proceedings against petitioner
on February 14, 1994. (Id. at 132-34). After a hearing on September 27,
1994, an immigration judge rendered petitioner excluded on grounds that
petitioner did not possess a valid visa or other entry document, had been
convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude, and had been convicted of
two or more offenses for which the aggregate sentence of confinement actually
imposed was five years or more. (Id. at 136). Consequently, after petitioner
completed his term of imprisonment, he was transferred to the custody of
the INS. Consistent with the Cuban Parole Review Plan, 8 C.F.R. &sect; 212.12,
petitioner's case has been regularly reviewed for possible parole (approximately
annually), most recently on March 23, 1998. Because of petitioner's lengthy
criminal record, his continued disciplinary problems while in custody, and
his &quot;apparent disregard&quot; for the significance of his criminal
history, parole has been denied in each instance. (Def. Ex. D).</P>

<P>On September 6, 1990, petitioner filed his first petition for habeas
relief in the United States District Court for the Northern District of
Texas. (Def. Ex. A at 283-307). That petition was referred to Magistrate
Clinton E. Averitte who reviewed petitioner's case and issued a report and
recommendation on the petition on October 4, 1991. (Id. at 308-15). After
completing her own review of the record, United States District Judge Mary
Lou Robinson adopted Judge Averitte's recommendation and denied petitioner's
first petition on November 25, 1991. (Id. at 317-18).</P>

<P>Respondent initially argues that this court should not review the merits
of petitioner's petition because petitioner has already had the opportunity
to litigate these issues in the Northern District of Texas. Respondent contends
that the present petition is successive and consequently, barred either
by principles of res judicata, law of the case doctrine, or abuse of the
writ jurisprudence. The court finds that, in the present case, the law of
the case doctrine prevents it from hearing petitioner's claims.1 Under the
doctrine of the law of the case, &quot;a decision on an issue made by a
court at one stage of a case should be given effect in successive stages.&quot;
United States v. Todd, 920 F.2d 399, 403 (6th Cir. 1990), citing Christianson
v. Colt Indus. Operating Corp., 486 U.S. 800, 816 (1988). This doctrine
applies with &quot;equal vigor&quot; to the decisions of a coordinate court
in the same case as to a court's own decisions. Id. Importantly, the doctrine
of law of the case, particularly as applied to decisions of coordinate courts,
is discretionary, designed as a tool to promote judicial efficiency. &quot;A
court has the power to revisit prior decisions of its own or of a coordinate
court in any circumstance, although as a rule courts should be loathe to
do so in the absence of extraordinary circumstances.&quot; Christianson,
486 U.S. at 816, quoting Messenger v. Anderson, 225 U.S. 436, 444 (1912);
see also In re Upjohn Co. Antibiotic Cleocin Products Liability Litigation,
664 F.2d 114 (6th Cir. 1981). In the Sixth Circuit, the determination of
whether a prior ruling of a coordinate court should be reconsidered is left
in the sole discretion of the court. Todd, 920 F.2d at 403. In making its
determination, a court should consider whether substantially different evidence
has been uncovered; whether a contrary view of law has been decided by controlling
authority; or whether the earlier decision was clearly erroneous and would
work manifest injustice. Billups v. Schotten, 145 F.3d 1329, 1998 WL 246440
(6th Cir. 1998), citing Hanover v. American Engineering Co., 105 F.3d 306,
312 (6th Cir. 1997); see also United States v. Moored, 38 F.3d 1419, 1421
(6th Cir. 1994).</P>

<P>Numerous courts have recognized successive habeas petitions as successive
stages of the same litigation. See e.g. Burton v. Foltz, 810 F.2d 118, 119-20
(6th Cir. 1987); Raulerson v. Wainwright, 753 F.2d 869 (11th Cir. 1985);
Lackey v. Scott, 885 F. Supp. 958, 960-63 (W.D. Tex. 1995). In the present
petition, petitioner argues that his continued detention and parole denials
violate his expectation of freedom from unreasonable detention, his procedural
due process protections, and customary international law. These are precisely
the same claims petitioner raised in his 1990 habeas petition before the
United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas. Indeed,
the two petitions differ by only a few words. The District Court for the
Northern District of Texas, a coordinate court, gave petitioner's first
petition careful consideration, issuing a detailed recommendation and opinion.
In the present petition, the petitioner has made no allegation that there
has been any change in fact or law that should alter the out come of his
first petition or even that the 1991 decision was manifestly unjust. Consequently,
law of the case doctrine prevents this court from reconsidering petitioner's
entirely repetitive claim.</P>

<P>Accordingly, petitioner's petition for habeas corpus relief is DENIED.
That court further notes that petitioner's motion for appointment of counsel,
also presently pending before the court, shall be dismissed as moot in accordance
with this order.</P>

<P>IT IS SO ORDERED.</P>

<P>1 The court observes that principles of res judicata do not apply to
habeas corpus cases. See Sanders v. United States, 373 U.S. 1, 8 (1963).
Further, while there is some support for respondent's proposition that abuse
of the writ jurisprudence should apply to bar consideration of petitioner's
&sect; 2241 petition, see Chambers v. United States, 106 F.3d 472,474-75
(2d Cir. 1997); Leyva v. Meissner, 996 F. Supp. 831, 834-35 (C.D. Ill. 1998);

5, 1997); Sinclair v. Jenkins, No. 93-3301-RDR, 1996 WL 511790, at *1 (D.
Kan. Sept. 6, 1996), recently codifications of abuse of the writ law of
Congress have noticeably omitted &sect; 2241 petitions from their coverage.
See 28 U.S.C. 2244 (imposing restriction on successive petitions challenging
confinement pursuant to state court judgement); 28 U.S.C. &sect; 2255 (imposing
restrictions on successive petitions challenging confinement pursuant to
a judgment of a federal court.). Additionally, respondent has failed to
bring to the court's attention any decision by a court of this circuit applying
abuse of the writ principles to a &sect; 2241 petition.<BR>

<P>4. Section 212.12 of Title 8 of the Code of Federal Regulations provides:</P>

<P>Parole determinations and revocations respecting<BR>
Mariel Cubans.<BR>
</P>

<P>(a) Scope. This section applies to any native of Cuba who last came to
the United States between April 15, 1980, and October 20, 1980 (hereinafter
referred to as Mariel Cuban) and who is being detained by the Immigration
and Naturalization Service (hereinafter referred to as the Service) pending
his or her exclusion hearing, or pending his or her return to Cuba or to
another country. It covers Mariel Cubans who have never been paroled as
well as those Mariel Cubans whose previous parole has been revoked by the
Service. It also applies to any Mariel Cuban, detained under the authority
of the Immigration and Nationality Act in any facility, who has not been
approved for release or who is currently awaiting movement to a Service
or Bureau Of Prisons (BOP) facility. In addition, it covers the revocation
of parole for those Mariel Cubans who have been released on parole at any
time.</P>

<P>(b) Parole authority and decision. The authority to grant parole under
section 212(d)(5) of the Act to a detained Mariel Cuban shall be exercised
by the Commissioner, acting through the Associate Commissioner for Enforcement,
as follows:</P>

<P>(1) Parole decisions. The Associate Commissioner for Enforcement may,
in the exercise of discretion, grant parole to a detained Mariel Cuban for
emergent reasons or for reasons deemed strictly in the public interest.
A decision to retain in custody shall briefly set forth the reasons for
the continued detention. A decision to release on parole may contain such
special conditions as are considered appropriate. A copy of any decision
to parole or to detain, with an attached copy translated into Spanish, shall
be provided to the detainee. Parole documentation for Mariel Cubans shall
be issued by the district director having jurisdiction over the alien, in
accordance with the parole determination made by the Associate Commissioner
for Enforcement.</P>

<P>(2) Additional delegation of authority. All references to the Commissioner
and Associate Commissioner for Enforcement in this section shall be deemed
to include any person or persons (including a committee) designated in writing
by the Commissioner or Associate Commissioner for Enforcement to exercise
powers under this section.</P>

<P>(c) Review Plan Director. The Associate Commissioner for Enforcement
shall appoint a Director of the Cuban Review Plan. The Director shall have
authority to establish and maintain appropriate files respecting each Mariel
Cuban to be reviewed for possible parole, to determine the order in which
the cases shall be reviewed, and to coordinate activities associated with
these reviews.</P>

<P>(d) Recommendations to the Associate Commissioner for Enforcement. Parole
recommendations for detained Mariel Cubans shall be developed in accordance
with the following procedures.</P>

<P>(1) Review Panels. The Director shall designate a panel or panels to
make parole recommendations to the Associate Commissioner for Enforcement.
A Cuban Review Panel shall, except as otherwise provided, consist of two
persons. Members of a Review Panel shall be selected from the professional
staff of the Service. All recommendations by a two-member Panel shall be
unanimous. If the vote of a two-member Panel is split, it shall adjourn
its deliberations concerning that particular detainee until a third Panel
member is added. A recommendation by a three-member Panel shall be by majority
vote. The third member of any Panel shall be the Director of the Cuban Review
Plan or his designee.</P>

<P>(2) Criteria for Review. Before making any recommendation that a detainee
be granted parole, a majority of the Cuban Review Panel members, or the
Director in case of a record review, must conclude that:</P>

<P>(i) The detainee is presently a nonviolent person;</P>

<P>(ii) The detainee is likely to remain nonviolent;</P>

<P>(iii) The detainee is not likely to pose a threat to the community following
his release; and</P>

<P>(iv) The detainee is not likely to violate the conditions of his parole.</P>

<P>(3) Factors for consideration. The following factors should be weighed
in considering whether to recom-mend further detention or release on parole
of a detainee:</P>

<P>(i) The nature and number of disciplinary infractions or incident reports
received while in custody;</P>

<P>(ii) The detainee's past history of criminal behavior;</P>

<P>(iii) Any psychiatric and psychological reports pertaining to the detainee's
mental health;</P>

<P>(iv) Institutional progress relating to participation in work, educational
and vocational programs;</P>

<P>(v) His ties to the United States, such as the number of close relatives
residing lawfully here;</P>

<P>(vi) The likelihood that he may abscond, such as from any sponsorship
program; and</P>

<P>(vii) Any other information which is probative of whether the detainee
is likely to adjust to life in a community, is likely to engage in future
acts of violence, is likely to engage in future criminal activity, or is
likely to violate the conditions of his parole.</P>

<P>(4) Procedure for review. The following procedures will govern the review
process:</P>

<P>(i) Record review. Initially, the Director or a Panel shall review the
detainee's file. Upon completion of this record review, the Director or
the Panel shall issue a written recommendation that the detainee be released
on parole or scheduled for a personal interview.</P>

<P>(ii) Personal interview. If a recommendation to grant parole after only
a record review is not accepted or if the detainee is not recommended for
release, a Panel shall personally interview the detainee. The scheduling
of such interviews shall be at the discretion of the Director. The detainee
may be accompanied during the interview by a person of his choice, who is
able to attend at the time of the scheduled interview, to assist in answering
any questions. The detainee may submit to the Panel any information, either
orally or in writing, which he believes presents a basis for release on
parole.</P>

<P>(iii) Panel recommendation. Following completion of the interview and
its deliberations, the Panel shall issue a written recommendation that the
detainee be released on parole or remain in custody pending deportation
or pending further observation and subsequent review. This written recommendation
shall include a brief statement of the factors which the Panel deems material
to its recommendation. The recommendation and appropriate file material
shall be forwarded to the Associate Commissioner for Enforcement, to be
considered in the exercise of discretion pursuant to &sect; 212.12(b).</P>

<P>(e) Withdrawal of parole approval. The Associate Commissioner for Enforcement
may, in his or her discretion, withdraw approval for parole of any detainee
prior to release when, in his or her opinion, the conduct of the detainee,
or any other circumstance, indicates that parole would no longer be appropriate.</P>

<P>(f) Sponsorship. No detainee may be released on parole until suitable
sponsorship or placement has been found for the detainee. The paroled detainee
must abide by the parole conditions specified by the Service in relation
to his sponsorship or placement. The following sponsorships and placements
are suitable:</P>

<P>(1) Placement by the Public Health Service in an approved halfway house
or mental health project;</P>

<P>(2) Placement by the Community Relations Service in an approved halfway
house or community project; and</P>

<P>(3) Placement with a close relative such as a parent, spouse, child,
or sibling who is a lawful permanent resident or a citizen of the United
States.</P>

<P>(g) Timing of reviews. The timing of review shall be in accordance with
the following guidelines.</P>

<P>(1) Parole revocation cases. The Director shall schedule the review process
in the case of a new or returning detainee whose previous immigration parole
has been revoked. The review process will commence with a scheduling of
a file review, which will ordinarily be expected to occur within approximately
three months after parole is revoked. In the case of a Mariel Cuban who
is in the custody of the Service, the Cuban Review Plan Director may, in
his or her discretion, suspend or postpone the parole review process if
such detainee's prompt deportation is practicable and proper.</P>

<P>(2) Continued detention cases. A subsequent review shall be commenced
for any detainee within one year of a refusal to grant parole under</P>

<P>&sect; 212.12(b), unless a shorter interval is specified by the Director.</P>

<P>(3) Discretionary reviews. The Cuban Review Plan Director, in his discretion,
may schedule a review of a detainee at any time when the Director deems
such a review to be warranted.</P>

<P>(h) Revocation of parole. The Associate Commissioner for Enforcement
shall have authority, in the exercise of discretion, to revoke parole in
respect to Mariel Cubans. A district director may also revoke parole when,
in the district director's opinion, revocation is in the public interest
and circumstances do not reasonably permit referral of the case to the Associate
Commissioner. Parole may be revoked in the exercise of discretion when,
in the opinion of the revoking official:</P>

<P>(1) The purposes of parole have been served;</P>

<P>(2) The Mariel Cuban violates any condition of parole;</P>

<P>(3) It is appropriate to enforce an order of exclusion or to commence
proceedings against a Mariel Cuban; or</P>

<P>(4) The period of parole has expired without being renewed.
