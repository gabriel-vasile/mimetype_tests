        Passport to Knowledge (P2K) mission: real science, real scientists, real 
        locations, real learning</font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#3300CC"><font size="3">. 
        </font></font><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">P2K energizes 
        the core content of secondary school science by relating classroom instruction 
        to real-world research, and connecting students with leading scientists. 
        Since 1994, P2K has developed, disseminated and evaluated two complementary 
        series of multiple media instructional materials and experiences. The 
        LIVE FROM &quot;electronic field trips&quot; have become public television's 
        longest-running interactive learning project. They are also carried by 
        NASA-TV, and streamed and archived on the Web.</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Four P2K Modules 
        (Rainforest, Weather and Climate, Antarctica, The Solar System) each include 
        eight 15-minute classroom videos and two 30-minute teacher resource programs. 
        These Modules can be implemented&#151;using videotape, the Internet, mail lists 
        and inquiry based hands-on activities&#151;at any time throughout the school 
        year. </font></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They offer an integrated 
        suite of current and comprehensive instructional materials, directly linked 
        to core Earth, space, life and physical science content targeted by the 
        National Science Education Standards and Project 2061's &quot;Benchmarks.&quot; 
        Each LIVE FROM mini-series reaches from 1.5 to 2 million viewers. PASSPORT 
        TO Modules, broadcast as instructional TV by PBS stations and educational 
        networks over multiple school years, may be seen by up to 10 million students. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> P2K has prototyped 
        and tested several innovative video and Internet techniques, such as &quot;You 
        Are There&quot; tours of sites as remote as Earth's Amundsen-Scott South 
        Pole Station, and as scientifically significant as Fermilab. Online BIOgraphies 
        and Field Journals personalize the scientific enterprise and provide role 
        models for future careers in science and high technology through portraits 
        of working researchers, both male and female, and from varied backgrounds.</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">P2K has demonstrated 
        the effectiveness of transforming the hard work of real-world research 
        into &quot;teachable moments&quot; that excite and inform students, and 
        their teachers. It has shown that ongoing support is required to encourage 
        mainstream educators to implement inquiry-based pedagogy and new technologies, 
        but that in-service experiences using the Internet can be successful and 
        reach national scale. Both real-time and &quot;evergreen&quot; materials 
        are required, in flexible formats, to accommodate the great diversity 
        of school schedules and technical resources. Evaluation, however, has 
        shown that this new kind of instructional resource can have measurable, 
        positive impact on students of diverse intelligences and aptitudes, in 
        schools of widely varying demographics.</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Both the National 
        Science Foundation and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
        have cited Passport to Knowledge as an example of the successful integration 
        of research with education and outreach in reports to Congress. P2K was 
        twice a finalist in the Education category of the Information Infrastructure 
        Awards, and was the winner of the 1997 EdNET &quot;Hero&quot; Award for 
        Excellence.</font></p>

        and Evaluation</b></font></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The International 
        Mathematics and Science Study continues to show that American students 
        lose world-class skills in math and science somewhere between elementary 
        and high school. P2K therefore focuses on the middle school years, where 
        attitudes as well as competencies and career choices are often set for 
        life. It&#146;s also the time when females may decide science and high 
        tech are &#147;not for them&#148;, and under-served populations may feel 
        excluded from what NSF Director Rita Colwell calls the &#147;male and 
        pale&#148; science and engineering community.</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> P2K features a cast 
        of on-camera researchers who &#147;look like America&#148; while being 
        leaders in their subjects. The LIVE FROM and P2K videos show people, places 
        and the research process in the dynamic TV medium most familiar and compelling 
        to today&#146;s students. Hands-on activities provide a concrete and memorable 
        experience of some of the key concepts being used to study our world and 
        the Universe at the remote locations. The Internet enables students to 
        go much deeper than any textbook or TV program allows, and also - in a 
        very important aspect of the project - to interact with some of the researchers 
        seen on camera, or read about in online BIOgraphies and Journals. </font></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Supported by NSF, 
        a 3-year evaluation by the Center for Children and Technology, EDC, found 
        positive improvements in knowledge, skills and attitude as a result of 
        participating in P2K. For example:</font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">89.6 percent of

          say participation made them &#147;more interested&#148; in science and
