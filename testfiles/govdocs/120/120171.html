    My name is Rick Klausner and I'm the Director of the National Cancer Institute, 
    and I am very pleased to inaugurate the first in what I think is going to 
    be a wonderful series, adding to the culture of the NIH, dedicated to the 
    memory of Eleanor Nealon, called "The Extraordinary Communicators Lecture 
    and Award;" and as you all know from the posters, why you are all here is 
    that the first recipient of this lecture and award is Robert Krulwich, ABC 
    News Special Correspondent, and an extraordinary communicator.<br>
    <br>
    Science and communications, it seems to me, is always inextricably entwined. 
    In the world of cancer, from research to the patient, the imperative of communication 
    deepens. Its power to connect, to enlighten, to empower, to soothe, and to 
    attempt to clarify the drama of life and death, becomes pressing.<br>
    <br>
    Today, as I said, I am very pleased to present the first in what will be a 
    series to celebrate communication; communication about science, and the science 
    of communication.<br>
    <br>
    Let me just say a few words about what brought us to this inaugural event. 
    Of course, in part, we were brought to it by a growing interest and concern 
    in communication and its possibilities, and the requirement that we think 
    more deeply and more successfully about communication, and the way we think 
    about science. Communication is a critical component of health care and of 
    research, of discovery and of fighting disease. It is an absolutely essential 
    component of achieving quality across the entire continuum, from discovery, 
    to the application of discovery, to the experience of health and disease; 
    and particularly in terms of the strategic planning, the NCI has over the 
    past few years identified communications as, in fact, one of the six extraordinary 
    opportunities for the ability to make profound advances in health. There, 
    in fact, are few activities that have a more immediate capacity to change 
    the experience of patients at risk for and with disease, than communication, 
    and access to information. And with the explosion of not only new insights 
    about communication, but of course, new technologies, there are the possibilities 
    of really capitalizing on and capturing the promise and the power of communication 
    in ways we haven't done before.<br>
    <br>
    This particular lecture and this award is named for a dear friend, Eleanor 
    Nealon, who was an employee of the NCI for 18 years, until breast cancer claimed 
    her life last year. Eleanor, and I know many of you here knew her, was devoted 
    to science, to improving health, and to the critical bridges between scientists, 
    the institutions of discovery, and patients through communication. She served 
    as the first director of the NCI Office of Liaison Activities, and led the 
    press, public inquiries, and cancer information service offices. I worked 
    closely with Eleanor, as she was insistent that we must open up the Institute 
    to consumers and patients and advocates, and she led the development of the 
    first NIH Standing Advisory Committee entirely comprised of consumers, called 
    the Director's Consumer Liaison Group. This series is fittingly named in her 
    honor.<br>
    <br>
    I would like to point out that some members of her family are with us today: 
    her husband, Tony Wolbars, just came back from China at 2 a.m. this morning; 
    her sister Kate, brothers Steve and Kevin, and of course many other close 
    friends, coworkers, and other family members.<br>
    <br>
    As I said, this award is a tribute to individuals who have advanced the science 
    of communication, and advanced the communication of science. And the recipient 
    is a fantastic example of that. Unfortunately, I don't get to introduce him. 
    But I do introduce Chris Bury, who is going to introduce Robert Krulwich. 
    Journalists are very worried about those that they cover introducing them; 
    it's our opportunity to say what we really want to say I won't get to say 
    it. But Chris is a local NIH neighbor; we usually see him, as he pointed out, 
    when there is a crisis or a scandal which I assume there will not be today; 
    although I haven't heard Mr. Krulwich's talk.<br>
    <br>
    Chris is the ABC News correspondent with <i>Nightline</i>. His reporting has 
    covered a wide spectrum of diverse and challenging stories: including politics, 
    economics, health care reform, the military, and children in poverty. He, 
    himself, is a widely recognized and highly lauded journalist, having been 
    recognized by the Radio Television News Directors Association with the Edward 
    R. Murrow Award and the Alfred I. duPont Award from the Columbia Journalism 
    School. And Chris will tell us more about the work of his friend and colleague 
    and associate, Robert Krulwich; and so please join me in welcoming Chris to 
    the NIH.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Introduction of Awardee Robert Krulwich by Chris Bury</b><br>
    <br>
    Dr. Klausner, thank you for that overly kind and generous introduction; and 
    you're usually right you don't want to see me here normally if you can help 
    it.<br>
    <br>
    I notice that you kind of played up that health care reform angle; and you 
    know, I used to think, once upon a time before I knew Robert that health care 
    was a really important story. In fact, listening to that bio, I used to think 
    I covered any number of pretty important stories: highjackings and national 
    elections, scandals, the impeachment of a President it sounds like pretty 
    big stuff; big, that is, until you consider the beat that Robert Krulwich 
    covers. And when you do, then the stories that my colleagues and I cover, 
    start to feel downright insignificant.<br>
    <br>
    While most of us cover the bread and butter of daily life on the planet, Robert 
    pays attention to the really, really, really, really, <i>really</i> big stuff. 
    And I mean huge, as in metaphysical; as in: what does it all mean. In fact, 
    it would not be a stretch to call Robert Krulwich ABC's "Cosmic Correspondent."<br>
    <br>
    In this era in which television news spends mind-numbing amounts of time on 
    the travails of a telegenic Cuban boy, or the political wisdom of a former 
    professional wrestler, or the sexual peccadilloes of our elected officials, 
    Robert is the only network correspondent I know who regularly covers the ultimate 
    stories on the meaning of our life, and our place in the planet, in the galaxy, 
    in our universe stories that, according to the conventional wisdom in our 
    business, are supposed to be absolutely impossible to produce for the highly 
    visual, fast-paced, attention-handicapped world of television news.<br>
    <br>
    Here are just a few of the questions Robert has posed and addressed for <i>Nightline</i> 
    and other ABC News programs in recent months.</font></p>
</div>
<div align=left></div>
<ul>
  <li>
    <div align=left><font size=3 color=#000000 face="Arial"> Why do we assume 
      that life as we know it started here on earth?</font></div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div align=left><font size=3 color=#000000 face="Arial"> </font><font size=3 color=#000000 face="Times New Roman"> 
      </font><font size=3 color=#000000 face="Arial">What are the true odds of 
      life on another planet?</font></div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div align=left><font size=3 color=#000000 face="Arial"> Is it possible to 
      travel back and forth in time?</font></div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div align=left><font size=3 color=#000000 face="Arial"> Is there, indeed, 
      a single design to the universe?</font></div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div align=left><font size=3 color=#000000 face="Arial"> Why do so many scientists 
      now believe our world is going to end not with a bang, but with a whimper; 
      and a hell of a lot sooner than most of us think.</font></div>
  </li>
</ul>
<div align=left> 
  <p><font size=3 color=#000000 face="Arial"> Robert has introduced our viewers 
    to string theory; he's explained the arcane physics of "WIMPs" otherwise known 
    as Weakly Interacting Massive Particles. I think I've got that right. He's 
    shown us how to measure supernovas. He's explored the dark corners and the 
    black holes of the universe.<br>
    <br>
    There are three things that I think make Robert's work so wonderful. The first 
    is a kind of a childlike curiosity about everything he does. And when you 
    think about it, those truly, truly big questions: Why this? How come that? 
    What does that mean? What's that for? Those are the questions that a 3-year-old 
    would pose; and they come so naturally to Robert.<br>
    <br>
    You know, Robert's curiosity is hardly limited to the grand things, like physics. 
    He's investigated why people so love shopping malls, it's the design apparently. 
    He's asked what life was like at the beginning of the last millennium: itchy 
    tunics, no forks, lots of porridge. He's asked how many homes Santa really 
    would have to cover on Christmas Eve. 1,178 per second, is what Robert found 
    out. And he's fathomed the origin of the word "honeymoon" and you can ask 
    that later during the Q&amp;A.<br>
    <br>
    The second thing that strikes me about Robert's reporting, and always has, 
    is its humanity. He shows us the human side of people, often respected scientists 
    and people who are experts in their fields. He shows us the human side that 
    we might not otherwise see.<br>
    <br>
    One of our favorite sayings in television news is: "Hey, it ain't brain surgery." 
    But one of Robert's great pieces was on a pair of brain surgeons, a husband 
    and wife and the story was pretty simple. It just laid out how these brain 
    surgeons juggled their marriage, their kids, their household … and yes, brain 
    surgery.<br>
    <br>
    One of my all-time Krulwich favorites features a woman named Porter Colley, 
    whose body is covered with grotesque tumors, lumps, and bumps. She suffers 
    from a genetic disease. Neurofibromatosis, I think it is? Every year, Porter 
    Colley goes to Harvard Medical School, where she gives the students perhaps 
    the most valuable training of their medical educations. She teaches medical 
    students something that so many of them seem to forget and that is empathy.<br>
    <br>
    Robert showed us, how in one phenomenal lecture, this woman gets these prospective 
    doctors to see the human being inside the patient. And she's so effective 
    at this, that by the end of her lecture, and Robert captured this beautifully 
    for <i>Nightline,</i> this woman who is covered with the most grotesque tumors 
    you can imagine, by the end of the lecture, Harvard medical students are lining 
    up to give her hugs. And by the end of Robert's piece, I was convinced that 
    most of our 5 million viewers wanted to give her a hug, too.<br>
    <br>
    Two days ago, Robert and I attended the funeral of a former colleague, a wonderful 
    man who died of brain cancer at the age of 45 and whenever Robert reports 
    on that disease, you can be sure his story will include not only the scientific, 
    but also the human dimension.<br>
    <br>
    The third thing, of course, and indeed the very reason Robert is being honored 
    here today, is his talent at explaining even those cosmic stories. Like most 
    great storytellers, Robert is not above employing any device to get you to 
    pay attention. He's hired Loudon Wainwright III, you may remember that hit 
    classic, "Dead Skunk in the Middle of the Road." Well, Robert hired Loudon 
    Wainwright III to write a song to explain the declining population in the 
    world, "The Birth Dearth." Robert stood in a field of red and white balloons, 
    to show us how red and white blood cells interact.<br>
    <br>
    Just this week, Robert interviewed his own right hand for a series of programs 
    on surfing the Internet. And it was stimulating conversation, too.<br>
    <br>
    To illustrate just how Jupiter functions in our solar system, and it functions 
    like this giant vacuum cleaner sucking up all the stuff in space that might 
    hit Earth and the other planets, Robert got four 5-year-old kids, and he had 
    them wear T-shirts -- Earth, Mars, Venus, Pluto -- and he put them into a 
    batting cage with this gigantic inflatable ball, representing Jupiter. And 
    then he turned the machine on, and all this stuff was flying, and the planets 
    were there, and Jupiter was there … and Robert explained how it all worked. 
    Lucky for him, none of the kids were hurt, or were the children of lawyers.<br>
    <br>
    But the point here, of course, is that Krulwich is shameless. He will do anything 
    to tell a story. And the reason that's so important is because there is this 
    huge chasm; because so many of you who are brilliant scientists, and so many 
    of us who are hopeless liberal arts majors. And not to offend anyone, but 
    because so many scientists are, well … as dry as soda crackers in the Sahara 
    sun; and because so many of us liberal arts majors have this "MEGO" problem 
    as in M-E-G-O: My Eyes Glaze Over. And sometimes, great communication boils 
    down to simply doing whatever it takes to bridge that gap between the boring 
    and the easily bored.<br>
    <br>
    As talented and smart as Robert is and no one doubts that I would be committing 
    journalistic malpractice, not to let a little air out of the tires I've just 
    been inflating. There is the time that Robert submitted an expense account 
    for hiring a seamstress to stitch his conception of what a one-eyed alien 
    reptile might look like. Well, ABC's bean counters, the green eye-shade division, 
    rejected that expense voucher and at the bottom the accountant wrote: "And 
    by the way: Who is Robert Krulwich?"<br>
    <br>
    A couple of weeks ago, you remember the sinister virus that was attacking 
    so many computers, the one with the "I Love You" attachment. Well, it happened 
    just during a time in which Robert had sent one of his scripts for review 
    to a mucketymuck in New York, an ABC News Vice President. A little while later 
    and mind you, this is after the "I Love You" virus has been front page news 
    for a couple of days, Robert gets an e-mail from this ABC News Vice President, 
    and there's a little attachment there, and it says "I Love You," at the bottom. 
    Now, Robert is so convinced that this e-mail is from a Vice President who 
    loves his script, and loves him … and everything is lovey-dovey, that Robert, 
    of course, opens the attachment and it ruins his hard drive.<br>
    <br>
    That wouldn't be so bad, of course; but a couple of weeks later, when the 
    "Jokes" virus hit, Robert did it again. And he's our science guy … that's 
    what I heard, anyway; that's the story and I'm sticking to it.<br>
    <br>
    Whenever Ted Koppel introduces Robert for a piece on <i>Nightline,</i> Ted 
    Koppel's Page 2 is what we call the introduction, it's always a variation 
    on: We're not really sure what this crazy guy is really up to, but we kind 
    of like him anyway, so what the hell? But my all-time favorite Koppel introduction 
    of Robert was: Well, think of your mind as soil, and Krulwich is the fertilizer.<br>
    <br>
    So without any further ado, I would like to introduce Ted Koppel's favorite 
    fertilizer, ABC's Cosmic Correspondent, and my esteemed colleague Robert Krulwich.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Awardee: ROBERT KRULWICH</b><br>
    <br>
    Oh, boy. Thank you, Chris, sort of. The thing about Chris is, in the culture 
    of TV, when you're wondering, like, who to be in awe of, it scares me I mean, 
    the thing that I would least like to have is the telephone ring, and have 
    them say: There's a missile coming in, and at exactly 2 o'clock you have to 
    run in and do that kind of reporting. It scares me to death. And there's really 
    nobody in television who can handle the breaking stories with such extraordinary, 
    just … When he goes on, it's like, sometimes like 20 minutes after whatever 
    it was happened; and there he is: the tie, so calm … it's not me. Not me.<br>
    <br>
    Before I begin, I am very honored by this invitation … Rick's invitation. 
    And I never met Eleanor, although I get the impression and this is nice, I 
    think that when someone leads a life, a magical life, or a life that just 
    is important … when they die, there's this glow that sort of just hangs in. 
    And since I got this honor, I have heard more things more often about Eleanor. 
    And when I come here … a lot of you must have known her and known her well. 
    Or, if you didn't know her well, something about what she left behind must 
    still be very much alive in the room, and day-to-day, because I feel sort 
    of a presence. It's I'm not a mystical person or anything but I … so I'm particularly 
    honored to be here.<br>
    <br>
    About 5 years ago, I had mostly covered economics and politics and diplomacy, 
    and very little science. And then I got a sense, it's a reporter's instinct 
    really, that something in the world that I cover … when you have choices … 
    that something had changed.<br>
    <br>
    When you cover people running for president, say, or the people who are covering 
    the people who are running for president, or the people whose professional 
    business is to elect presidents … you do get a sense lately, that there is 
    something kind of quiet and a little dull in the political culture. Maybe, 
    they think back to earlier presidents, President Kennedy, President Reagan 
    who just seemed to be better at it, or bigger at it in some way. But when 
    you hang at the White House or in the political culture, you do sense that 
    the moment has somehow passed a bit. I mean, it's very self-referenced. You 
    go out on campaigns and you see bubbles of people walking together and you 
    think you can draw a circle around it. And it's sort of a little quiet bubble, 
    unto itself.<br>
    <br>
    You go cover economics, as I do, and you see there's a sense of a little bit 
    of exhaustion in the air; trying formulas that have worked, that aren't quite 
    as much as before again, a sense of wistfulness.<br>
    <br>
    And then, in the daily business of being a reporter, you walk into a laboratory 
    … by accident, almost. It could be the physical sciences, biology and something 
    is in the air. You suddenly get the feeling that the people in <i>this</i> 
    room are so happy to be alive <i>right</i> now. That <i>this</i> moment when 
    things are percolating … that <i>this</i> moment, maybe 500 years from now, 
    people will remember what's going in the labs, think about the people <i>in</i> 
    the labs. That you think: Well, now … I don't know. There is something so 
    over-the-moon about these guys, and sort of under-the-weather about those 
    guys, that a sort of natural reporter's instinct, is: Well, I think I just 
    want to spend a little more time with "these" and a little less time with 
    "those." Which is, more or less, what I did.<br>
    <br>
    Because I began to look at the menu. I mean, the genome; the mystery of how 
    we're made; why we get cancer, Alzheimer's, AIDS; how we create, store a memory; 
    nature of consciousness; the things that Chris mentioned -- how the universe 
    began, dark matter, black holes. To think that they're really learning about 
    this stuff right now -- chaos theory, mass extinctions. I just want to be 
    near these people, I thought.<br>
    <br>
    There are several problems with my desire. I don't know anything.I had high 
    school biology. I had physics. I had, I think, chemistry. Although the C minus 
    3, at my high school they give you three forever, which was really unfair, 
    because I sweated it, was a long time ago. And the question, of course, is 
    like, how dare you … how would anyone dare to talk about something in front 
    of millions of people that you have no formal training in, no degrees … well, 
    it may shock you guys to learn that, really, for reporters, this is not a 
    problem. Oh! I know what you're thinking. Sure! They talk about things they 
    know nothing about. That's what they do.<br>
    <br>
    Um … let me give you our version. We learn on the job, as we go. And the best 
    of us are constantly aware and a little bit frightened by all the things we 
    know we don't know. So you'll find a fact … I mean, you know you have no peripheral 
    vision. You know you have no sense of perspective yet. You learn a fact, you 
    check it, you know it's true. But deep down, you know there is some other 
    fact that they didn't teach you because you didn't go to school, you didn't 
    run into yet that will color the facts that you know so dramatically; a fact 
    that in some way that you haven't yet learned wrong.<br>
    <br>
    So you check. You go to your editors. Bit by bit, as you do the beat, you 
    get better. But every day, in the early run, it's like a pop quiz that you 
    are not quite prepared for. It is really scary. If you love learning it's 
    so much fun. And the best part is, that you have a mike, and you have all 
    these cameras, and all this equipment.<br>
    <br>
    So, this is kind of like … if you did get the C minus 3 in chemistry, imagine 
    if you could go back to the chemistry teacher who had no time for you, and 
    who wouldn't explain anything to you when you raised your hand and spoke in 
    a mumble in the back of the room. Now you've got the mike and the cameras, 
    and when you walk into the room they have to talk to you; and most important 
    … they have to please you. Because it's on your terms. The power of this is 
    wonderful. <br>
    <br>
    One other thing. This style of journalism -- the idea that you learn as you 
    go, comes I think, from a deeper faith. That in most subjects in life, we 
    are …all of us, amateurs. We have a system of government that expects us to 
    be amateurs. We try to think for ourselves. It's the essence of our system 
    that we do not leave important decisions to Plato's philosopher kings, or 
    kings, or savants of any kind. In a democracy, we the people, claim to be 
    collectively, the wise ones; we are expected to form opinions on matters that 
    we sometimes know very little about. They're very technical: the viability 
    of life in the first 3, or second 3, or third 3 months of a pregnancy. Cloning. 
    Genetically-manipulated foods. NAFTA. Balance of trade. I mean, most people 
    really don't understand these things too well. But we try to understand them 
    because we know we are going to, at some point, have to choose between a number 
    of options. And in the end, we believe and this is the faith of all democracies 
    that when we choose, most of the time we will choose well.<br>
    <br>
    And in that sense, the journalist as amateur stands in, I think, for all of 
    us. Every day we go out and we question wizards of one kind or another, all 
    of you in this room would be in that category; as far as we're concerned and 
    we try to understand what you're saying, and of course we make mistakes; but 
    in the end, we use all our wits, and being as careful as we can the better 
    ones to tell our neighbors and everybody what we learned. This is a noble 
    business. Even though, of course, some of us are lazy; some of us are looking 
    for the quick quote so we can get out of here; some of us do come to you looking 
    for buzz or controversy, and we just want to get an argument going, we want 
    to get something exciting as Chris mentioned. Some of us want to just be beautiful 
    and glamorous and you have white coats, many of you … and you speak in three 
    syllable words, many of you … and so when you go on camera, you say: Here 
    I am with Dr. Seymour Jones; he's in the coat, he speaks this way; I'm next 
    to him, I'm talking to him; he's smart, therefore … It's like a flash</font><font size=3 color=#000000 face="Times New Roman"> 
    </font><font size=3 color=#000000 face="Arial">you know.<br>
    <br>
    But the people who do that, they're the stupid ones. We've got</font><font size=3 color=#000000 face="Times New Roman"> 
    </font><font size=3 color=#000000 face="Arial">I mean, it's no big open secret. 
    We have stupid ones. You guys have stupid ones, right. But … <br>
    <br>
    I'm here today to make a case for the smarter ones. And I know that reporters 
    and especially TV reporters suffer right now from a widespread feeling that 
    we are all … not entirely to be trusted. We are not all that way, however. 
    There are some of us trying to make sense of what we see; but it is hard. 
    And so in this talk, I want to give you a sense of the difficulties and of 
    the pleasures of doing, as it says in the title, "The Things I Do." So maybe 
    the next time one of us comes around, you'll be a little more empathetic; 
    but I suggest you be very careful, nonetheless, of what you say.<br>
    <br>
    Why is it hard. Well, first of all, television is a visual medium. It requires 
    pictures. If this were the radio, where I used to work, I could if I used 
    the right words, say: "Just close your eyes and imagine a mountain. And on 
    top of the mountain, just put a little cottage." Well, if you're following 
    me, then… how ever many hundreds of you are here, will make many hundreds 
    of mountains with a hundred little cottages. They're your cottages, they're 
    not my cottages and we're coauthors. In your ear, I get you to paint my picture. 
    But it's your picture, too. No argument.<br>
    <br>
    On television, I can't say, "close your eyes" because you're watching television. 
    You don't do that. So I have to give you a mountain. It's going to be my mountain. 
    Twenty of you, 50 of you, a hundred of you will say: What kind of a mountain 
    is that? That's not a mountain. I've never seen a mountain like that and, 
    from then on, I've lost you. Because you're arguing with the mountain. There's 
    a literalness to the medium that's tough.<br>
    <br>
    If you're going to do a story about a virus, and the virus is going to be 
    your main character, you want people to follow the action of the virus … or 
    a cancer cell, or a photon, or a quark, or whatever … the thing is, of course, 
    it's invisible most of the time, or very hard to see. So you're working in 
    the visual medium and you have a threshold problem there. If you could see 
    a photon or a virus, the average person has no idea what it's doing when it 
    does whatever it is that it's doing. They don't know.<br>
    <br>
    If you put President Clinton on the screen you know who he is, you know what 
    he does for a living, you know where he lives. That's wind at your back. You 
    can get on with it. Try that with a virus. I mean, you've got a problem. So 
    if you tell a story about, say HIV, you know that most people don't know what 
    a virus is or what it does for a living, and so on … maybe they think it's 
    something you catch, that makes you sick.<br>
    <br>
    So here's a situation. Five years ago in Vancouver, they announce they've 
    got a triple cocktail that's been extraordinarily effective against HIV. Peter 
    Jennings says, "Well, why don't you explain how it works." I go, "What?" He 
    said, "Why don't you explain how the cocktail works?" Now, understand this 
    is an invitation with certain parameters. On the evening news, we call it 
    <i>World News Tonight</i>, you get minutes - two minutes to explain how a 
    virus works. If they want to be extraordinarily generous, they give you 2:15. 
    In this case, a bequest from Peter Jennings, I get 3, 3 minutes … and remember, 
    the virus is not President Clinton. So I'm going to have to introduce a completely 
    unfamiliar landscape to the audience, introduce my main character, describe 
    as vividly as possible what the virus does and I know that I'm not talking 
    to a high school biology class, let alone a college class. I'm talking to 
    your mama, basically. That's who watches the evening news, older people at 
    the end of their workdays. And they're not on the edge of their couch saying: 
    "Martha, get in here. They're going to discuss viral loads!" They don't say 
    that. And Martha doesn't say: "Okay, dear! I'll get the popcorn!" It's not 
    that kind of thing. You're up against a sort of low level of resistance.<br>
    <br>
    It's one thing if you're on National Public Radio, which I presume many of 
    you listen to. There you're talking through the radio, first of all, and to 
    the curious. When I was there, I used to call them "the curious." They actually 
    want to know what you're going to say. On television, they're largely the 
    incurious. They're just sitting there hoping that something interesting will 
    happen, but they're not anxious for an experience, they're just there. If 
    you're on breakfast television, you're talking to the incurious and the in-the-shower. 
    This is a hole</font><font size=3 color=#000000 face="Times New Roman"> </font><font size=3 color=#000000 face="Arial">or 
    passing by, to put galoshes on a girl, or something. So imagine, I spent quite 
    a few years trying to talk about high-yield bonds on breakfast shows. Hello!<br>
    <br>
    So, what do you do in the HIV situation. There are some classical story telling 
    devices that are available to you, and you use them. And in the piece I'm 
    going to show you, I went for a sort of Red Barber - Mel Allen approach. This 
    is a play-by-play description of a virus. It is a narrative and I would never 
    say this except to an "in crowd," like you are now becoming. This is a narrative 
    of a sportscast. You create a set of pictures, and then essentially, you narrate 
    right on the picture, hoping that the combination of words on picture will 
    keep people very, very attentive.<br>
    <br>
    So in this case, my producer was Nirage Kimlani, we went on the Web to something 
    called "ProfNet" which is the public relations arm of many universities, and 
    we said, basically: "Does anybody have pictures of HIV viruses in action?" 
    And from all over the world, we began to get pictures, for some reason, principally 
    from Belgium … I always like to give kudos to the Belgians; so they came in, 
    all these pictures, and then we decided to make an assembly of them and turn 
    them into the story you're about to see. I got Disney, the parent company, 
    to lend me a computer, where we were able to take all these pictures, which 
    came in different colors and sizes, and just level out the color and render 
    them so they looked like the same action; and we put them in a progression 
    … that is, the real progression, and we created the scenario you're about 
    to see. So, I want you to watch this. I want to tell you, though, in advance, 
    that there is something wrong. Not on the fact here, but something "TV wrong" 
    about what you're about to see. So let's take a look at this first clip.<br>
    <br>
    This is the virus, and it's going to land on the T-cell. However, the thing 
    that you need to see, the thing that's wrong with it, is the way it sounds. 
    So maybe they'll give us a progress report … <i>[Audio technical glitch with 
    video; Tries to get update from crew; No response.]</i><br>
    <br>
    (Laughs) I see we're just sort of on remote control. Well, let's consider 
    this kind of a wallpaper thing. [Laughter] <br>
    <br>
    What happens in there is I get very excited. When you get a chance to play 
    Red Barber you can get into it in a big way. And if you're not careful about 
    this, as you start narrating the flow of information, you start becoming … 
    I don't know, Orson Welles, or something. I began to get mail saying: "Why 
    did you use this voice?"<br>
    <br>
    Now, it's interesting … as soon as you tip-toe into the adventure of talking 
    in somewhat theatrical terms, you run the risk that people will resent the 
    theater element. The theater element will lure them in; but on the other hand, 
    there is a sound that television people make that is the sound of credibility. 
    And you know the sound. It's <i>[demonstrates deep "reporter voice"]</i> That 
    sound. If people talk like that, that must be true … somehow. If people say 
    <i>[uses &quot;reporter voice&quot;, then &quot;high voice&quot;]</i> you 
    think there's something wrong with the nasal guy … not only is he nasal, but 
    he may not be telling me the truth. Or, if it goes <i>[uses &quot;reporter 
    voice&quot;]</i> and then goes to <i>[uses &quot;very deep voice&quot;]</i> 
    then that somewhat overly articulated sound also sounds too good to be true. 
    And that's what I ran into there.<br>
    <br>
    So the mail came in saying: "It's not a police drama; it's a news story." 
    The other classic device for storytelling would be the metaphor which also 
    has its pleasures and dangers. The simplest one is props. I love props. I 
    have a DNA molecule that I have used over, and over, and over again. I don't 
    know how many pieces it's been in. I hold it … it's a large collapsible thing, 
    and it's very multicolored, and you can see the base gene pairs colored brilliant 
    green and yellow, I believe … and you walk into somebody's office you know, 
    very shortly somebody's going to announce that they have sequenced virtually 
    all three billion base pairs that make up the human genome, and they want 
    to patent certain genes, certain segments. So it's a hugely important story. 
    It has ethical, monetary, and scientific issues of profound importance; but 
    I know that most people don't know what a genome is.<br>
    <br>
    And if you want to talk about something like a DNA landlord, someone who owns 
    a piece of the chemistry that's in every one of your cells, it's very hard 
    to talk about; but it's so much easier if you come into the office with the 
    "know-it-all," and hand them a DNA molecule. Then you can say: "Well, let's 
    say this section right here contains, say, the trigger for male pattern baldness, 
    would that be big?" And the guy who probably is bald, will say: "Yeah, that 
    would be big." [Laughter] But you get the audience to focus on the thing that 
    he's holding. And then if I say: "Well, if we fix this step here, and this 
    one, then you wouldn't have to be bald anymore." He goes, "That's right." 
    I said, "Well, if you were the landlord," and you hand him the thing, "like, 
    how much would you charge to work this section of the gene."<br>
    <br>
    See, people at home when the landscape is there, and portable, they can follow 
    the action. But it, too, has its dangers. This was a story about T. Boone 
    Pickens. I decided I would explain, a few years ago, what a leveraged buyout 
    was like. I went on television, and I said: You know, if you were in the ocean, 
    and a little minnow came up to a big whale and said to the whale, "I am going 
    to eat you up" (minnows might make comments like that); but if the whale reacted 
    in horror and seemed to be frightened by the minnow, then you'd have to imagine 
    that the minnow had some means to make itself as large as a whale. That is 
    what leveraged buyouts actually do, I said. And I had ordered from a zoo store, 
    an inflatable beluga whale. So I had, on the table in front of me this flat 
    object, and I was going to pump it with my foot. And the beluga whale was 
    going to grow and grow; and then when the beluga whale achieved whale-like 
    size, I was going to do what leveraged buyouts have to do. I was going to 
    cut it off into pieces and sell them off with a real bowie knife. And the 
    whale would get sick and so forth, which had its own political message underneath.Watching 
    at home was T.&nbsp;Boone Pickens, an actual leveraged buyout guy, and a TV 
    connoisseur.<br>
    <br>
    So I go ahead and I create the whale; the whale goes up, and I cut the whale, 
    I explain the whole thing, and I go upstairs to my office. The phone rings. 
    T.&nbsp;Boone Pickens on the phone. At first I thought it was my friend Phillip 
    Garvin from high school, who does this all the time, but … gradually I decided 
    that it really was T. Boone Pickens, and the blood flowed to my feet and I 
    felt I would never move again. My tongue got dry … And what T. Boone Pickens 
    said, he says, "You know, I don't mind," he said, "that you build this nice 
    little whale and then you get this bowie knife and you chop up the whale," 
    he says, "but the thing is, the whale had a cute smile on its face. So if 
    you're gonna use a metaphor, be careful about the details. Because this made 
    it be cruel; if it didn't have a smile, it could be abstract. But if you're 
    gonna play this game, play it carefully." I thought: Wow! This guy's not dumb 
    for nothing. He's like a real smart guy. But it does just talk about the tensions 
    that are here. And they are everywhere.<br>
    <br>
    I do like props … I was going to show you my cancer prop; this is a show I 
    did on cancer, I wanted people to understand what the nature of cancer is. 
    I knew that a lot of people thought that cancer is cells dividing and dividing 
    and dividing and dividing out of control. And so I went on television, I said: 
    Well, cells are supposed to divide, that's how you get to grow from a baby 
    into adulthood. You grow because your cells are dividing and dividing; that's 
    the reason you grow. So cells are supposed to divide. Let's not be frightened 
    that cells are dividing.<br>
    <br>
    But the other thing that cells know how to do is... our DNA has created what 
    I call the "suicide cops," these are the regulator genes that essentially 
    say to certain cells, "Okay, it's time for you to die." Particularly the bad 
    cells. So in a healthy person, I've got these cops regulating the action. 
    You get cells dividing, dividing, dividing, dividing … and then you also get 
    cells dying, and dying, and dying … especially the mutant cells; so if you 
    do this right, it should all balance out, and the cop is in control.<br>
    <br>
    So I decided to play the cop. Now, this clip that I have is a prop fiesta. 
    I built a very, very large container; and in the container, as Chris had mentioned 
    earlier, I used balloons. Balloons, I think, are very effective things. So 
    I had all these white balloons; the malignant ones were black balloons. Although 
    again, when theater issues come in, it's just difficult. Because people … 
    African Americans wonder why it is that black is always the bad guy. And so 
    you have to just adjust. You have to actually say in the copy that you're 
    choosing black, and say so just to eliminate comments like this.<br>
    <br>
    The balloons are on the floor, and underneath the floor is Max Culhain, my 
    unfortunate intern at that time, who is buried under the balloons; and I said: 
    &quot;Now what I want you to do is when I go in there, I want you to give 
    the balloons some energy, so I want you to kick the balloons. And what I will 
    go in is, as the regulator gene, I will starting stabbing the malignant balloons 
    with a very large ice pick.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    What you would have seen … and this is very interesting. I walk in … I can't 
    see where Max is because of all these balloons. The last thing I hear before 
    I begin the cut, he says, "Please … don't stab me." And then I proceed to 
    teach a lesson, there in the large balloon cage, stabbing everyone but Max, 
    happily. And then the idea is set up here, and then it gets debated, and so 
    on.<br>
    <br>
    The idea always, is to make concepts that seem a little remote, and a little 
    hard to get, totally comprehensible to an ordinary person. That means you 
    sometimes have to create the entire field, the whole world that they can see, 
    in order to talk intelligently about it. And it's a nice way to work.<br>
    <br>
    It takes time, in my case this is the key, it takes a willingness to be a 
    little silly. <i>[Cue given by crew: technical problme corrected]</i></font></p>
  <p><font size=3 color=#000000 face="Arial">So in this same show … Yeah? Okay, 
    let's go back to the glorious moment, earlier on, where you hear the voiceover</font><font size=3 color=#000000 face="Times New Roman"> 
    </font><font size=3 color=#000000 face="Arial">see, now it's ruined, but if 
    you listen closely, you'll hear the moment in the virus story, where I get 
    a little carried away. Do you want to run the virus? Well, we could try. The 
    virus one is the first one … <i>[remarks regarding video sequence]<br>
    <br>
    [Virus video clip plays with audio]</i><br>
    <br>
    So there you use the can't spawn, can't spawn, can't spawn, as your Red Barber 
    moment. Right? I mean, I think I've got a play-by-play going … if I just keep 
    it going, I get a little carried away. But it was the "dead" part, the "into 
    the center of cell," that people thought was a little much. And it's funny, 
    you know? You think you're doing okay, and some people will find some things 
    excessive that other people don't.<br>
    <br>
    Let's go on to the next one. This is Cancer-A, and this is me, Max, the balloons, 
    and the stabbing.<br>
    <br>
    <i>[Cancer cells video clip plays with audio]<br>
    <br>
    </i>All right. You get the general idea. <i>[Applause] </i>Thank you.<br>
    <br>
    The thing you have to be very careful about is "anchor faces." If Barbara 
    Walters was doing this one with me, the thing you have to control for, is 
    if the</font><font size=3 color=#000000 face="Times New Roman"> </font><font size=3 color=#000000 face="Arial">no, 
    I'll say Peter Jennings. If Peter Jennings comes off this going <i>[makes 
    pose or gesture]</i> … you lose. So you have to make sure that they have their 
    right face on. The face of … ahhhh, now I understand.<br>
    <br>
    This was a little difficult in the next section. In this next section, I decided 
    in order to discuss the various cancer therapies, I needed a focal point; 
    so I decided I would build a huge cancer cell, about four feet across, with 
    parts that I wanted to be able to manipulate.<br>
    <br>
    So I sat down with some guys at Slung, Kettering &amp; Rockefeller. We came 
    up with a design, and then I called a lady who makes pillows for a living 
    for Park Avenue people. I called her up … I only had the weekend, and I said: 
    "I know you make pillows, mostly; but could you make me a very large cancer 
    cell with an intake valve, removable wires, and it has to open like a clam 
    shell." And there was a very long silence on the other end … I said, "Hello?"<br>
    <br>
    We went down to Canal Street and bought this very large plastic thing. She 
    then stitched, and stitched, and stitched, and stitched, and stitched … and 
    now I will show you what came to the office, $1,200 later … Next section.<br>
    <br>
    <i>[Cancer cell video clip]</i><br>
    <br>
    There is, of course, another way to deal with invisible science stories on 
    television; and you don't need the dramatic effect, and you don't have to 
    use the sportscasting, or the play-by-play, or the voice, or the metaphor, 
    or the props, or even the imaginary landscape; because after all, science 
    is done by scientists. By people. And people are always interested in other 
    people.<br>
    <br>
    So when a person … a real-live person is on the screen … the audience knows 
    what people do; they know what it's like to cry, or laugh, or discover something, 
    or fail or cope. It's not a virus or a cell; but if you have people as your 
    stars, now, like with President Clinton, you have wind at your back. And as 
    a storyteller with people, you can go places that the props and the funny 
    stuff can never reach.<br>
    <br>
    The thing that Chris mentioned before I'm going to show you a little bit of. 
    It's an excerpt from a story I recently did, as he said, on the Harvard Medical 
    School. Now, the purpose here was; there was an education dean up at Harvard 
    named Dan Fetterman, who over a number of years, had pretty much helped to 
    radically change the curriculum at Harvard. It was based on his notion, that 
    as machines got better and better at diagnosing diseases, and at providing 
    steady streams of information to doctors, and at actually helping people get 
    better -- Docs would begin naturally paying more and more attention to the 
    machines, and less and less and less to the people, to the patients.<br>
    <br>
    And Fetterman, noticing this trend, among others, decided that he wanted to 
    build up the "people muscle" in his students. He wanted to make sure that 
    they had the ability to listen, and touch, and take histories … and so he 
    gradually changed the curriculum. No small business, in a very academic institution 
    like that; because he had to get professors not to lecture on the 25 pathways 
    to this or that … and he made the classes smaller, and more intimate, and 
    case studies and this is happening all over the country.<br>
    <br>
    But I wanted to capture this idea. And as Chris mentioned, we happened accidentally, 
    upon a class where a 160 students were invited to look and listen to what 
    really was, literally, a loathsome person; in the sense that she had neurofibromatosis 
    and was covered with tumors. And this is a principle with me: because so much 
    news on television now is based on conflict and on taking a little disagreement 
    and making it bigger; or taking a fear, and making it scarier; or taking anger, 
    or hate, or despair … or any vivid emotion, and making it louder. I always 
    want, whenever possible, to establish some kind of connection between adversaries; 
    not to lighten the difference. I want to leave, I want to embrace … particularly 
    the unembraceable. Or include the excluded; whether they be poor, or outlaws, 
    or different … or sick.<br>
    <br>
    And the woman who walked into this classroom, right before our eyes, was a 
    very good example of this. Her name was Porter Colley, and she had a story 
    that she told. This is a very, very tricky business to do this on television. 
    Because she is covered with these things. And the kids reacted in some shock, 
    when she sat down in front of the room. And I decided, watching this, that 
    that's what I wanted to do. I wanted to take my audience and have them have 
    the same experience … the same connecting experience, that the students were 
    having.<br>
    <br>
    The students had to look at her right away. In the classroom, they were passing 
    around a picture of this woman when she was 23 years old. And she was wonderfully, 
    radiantly beautiful, without a blemish. And I concentrated on that picture 
    being passed from hand-to-hand, and I had my V-cameraman rush two cameras 
    right in, right away and I said: I want … just take pictures of the kids watching.<br>
    <br>
    So for the first portion of this program, you'd hear the story of this woman, 
    and you'd watch the faces reacting, and you'd see occasional glimpses of her 
    when she was young, and ever-so-slight glimpses of her now, from distances.	
    We moved in, and moved in, and moved in.<br>
    <br>
    I want to let you see the beginning of the middle of this, just a bit of it 
    … and then we'll follow up. So let's just take a look at this next section.<br>
    <br>
    This program went on, and it got quite interesting. She decided that at the 
    end of the lecture she was going to remove her top and submit to a physical 
    examination.<br>
    <br>
    We had big cameras in the room. We also had a reputation in the room. Television 
    has a reputation. And the kids who attend Harvard Medical School … for whatever 
    reason, and maybe for good reason … decided that ABC in the Harvard Medical 
    School, watching a woman like this taking her clothes off, could only do ill.<br>
    <br>
    And a very brave student came down the stairs at the end of her lecture and 
    suggested that she not do this; either in front of us, or remove herself to 
    another room. She, who was a preacher for her cause, just as you guys are 
    preachers for cancer, wanted the attention. And the class had to decide whether 
    to let us … the potential perverts in the room … watch this woman do what 
    she did. They debated it. We rolled through the whole thing. The class decided 
    that if Porter Colley wanted to do this even though they weren't so sure it 
    was a good idea, that it was in the case of "Porter Colley rules," so she 
    went and proceeded.<br>
    <br>
    The thing that Chris described, I am now going to show you what happens at 
    the end. So, let's see … this is now, I should tell you, a little bit before.<br>
    <br>
    She explains to the class that</font><font size=3 color=#000000 face="Arial"> 
    these lumps and bumps on her are very, very sensitive. And therefore, she, 
    for example, can't be cleaned. She can't take shower pressure because the 
    pressure of the water on her body is just too painful. Her brother has to 
    clean her with a toothbrush, very gently. She can't be hugged, because people 
    don't know how to give light hugs, she said. So, she's gone a long time without 
    ever really being embraced.<br>
    <br>
    Sometimes the very best reporting and the very best stories, period all they 
    do is say: Look. This is what people can do. This is what <i>we</i> can do. 
    And if I get to do things like this, even once a year</font><font size=3 color=#000000 face="Times New Roman">, 
    </font><font size=3 color=#000000 face="Arial">I have a tremendous amount 
    of fun playing around and explaining, and I have a tremendous amount of fun 
    seeing things that startle me.<br>
    <br>
    But every so often you just touch the thing that makes the most difference 
    in the whole world; and then if you can show it to a lot of people, you can 
    lie down and get a really good night's sleep.<br>
    <br>
    I thank you, very, very much.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Richard Klausner, M.D.<br>
    <br>
    </b>That was fantastic. I think this series is now aptly called "The Great 
    Communicator Series." A few years ago I gave a lecture at the Lastra Awards, 
    which was entitled "Who Will Tell Our Stories of Science." And we're very 
    lucky that we have someone to tell our own stories back to us.<br>
    <br>
    We're also lucky of the fact that we checked him before he came in, and we 
    removed the ice pick … and so I feel very comfortable being around him, especially 
    as a cancer doctor.<br>
    <br>
    We do have an actual award here. From Chris's introduction, this is only the 
    world; we'll clearly have to send him a larger glass of the cosmos, but we 
    haven't finished with that full model yet.<br>
    <br>
    But in recognition, it says: "The Extraordinary Communicators Award from the 
    National Cancer Institute, June&nbsp;16, 2000, to Robert Krulwich."<br>
    <br>
    We will have time for some questions, not of me, but of him and afterward 
    there will be a reception out in the lobby. I also want to thank the people 
    in the NCI who made this possible; and particularly, Barbara Rimer, the head 
    of our Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences, whose idea this 
    was, and who has taught us all a lot about communication.<br>
    <br>
    So I think Mr. Krulwich will take questions about the cosmos, about him … 
    about anything, I suspect.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Question:</b> Climate change is a big issue, how can you present this story?</font></p>
  <p><font size=3 color=#000000 face="Arial"><b>Robert Krulwich: </b> Climate 
    change could be the most boring story ever conceived, in a way. Because it 
    has a problem. It's about a system. It's about a whole piece of machinery, 
    heavily involving the oceans, the transfer of gases from the air down back 
    into the sea, tunnels of water that go as rivers through the oceans … and 
    it's the whole thing together, that seems to be at risk. And one of the great 
    mysteries is: what part is broken, and what part needs fixing, and how the 
    consequences go.<br>
    We wanted to create a model that we could actually work with. And interestingly, 
    NOVA suggested that I do a show on that, and they didn't want to do the model 
    version; they wanted it to be beautiful pictures of Iceland melting or something, 
    and I thought that really wouldn't work. There are certain things that your 
    instinct tells you; if you don't get at the whole shape of it, it's just very, 
    very hard to do. If you do it in beautiful pieces, it's sort of public television 
    on a bad day, I think.<br>
    <br>
    The other problem with it, which we ran into at ABC with the movie star and 
    the President and all, is that it is a tentative subject. I mean, you don't 
    think so. But I mean, I think you have to reserve if it is</font><font size=3 color=#000000 face="Times New Roman"> 
    </font><font size=3 color=#000000 face="Arial">to do that story in the indicative 
    instead of the subjunctive, I think would be a mistake. It comes down an awful 
    lot of times to things like rolling dice. I mean, people think: "Gee, it was 
    hot again. Oo! And it was hot again! Oo! And it was hot again! The world is 
    ending!" It seems to be an ordinary</font><font size=3 color=#000000 face="Times New Roman"> 
    </font><font size=3 color=#000000 face="Arial">three hot days, and here comes 
    global warming.<br>
    I think one of the jobs of reporters is to pull back a little bit from the 
    anecdotal and instinctive reaction to something that just happened to you 
    because this is a story that operates in a huge way, and over long periods 
    of time. Without sort of stepping back and looking at it with some sense about 
    time and the fullness of the system, I think you'd be in trouble. So that's 
    been the problem for me. Although this is a huge subject, no question.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Question: </b>Do you direct your stories to talk to decision makers?<br>
    <br>
    <b>Robert Krulwich: </b>The only time I ever educated the government, was 
    when you were there. No, I don't do that too often. I don't know why. I mean, 
    I don't really want to.<br>
    <br>
    I once talked to a bunch of members of the Cabinet and mucketymucks; that 
    was the one time downtown. But mostly, I'm actually more interested in talking 
    to people who don't think they would get it.<br>
    </font></p>
  <p><font size="3" color="#000000" face="Arial">I mean the best gift is, you're 
    on the A train going on to Nevins Avenue in the central part of Brooklyn, 
    and a guy leans over and says, "I saw your biology … " and then they tell 
    you like, six or seven facts, and it's 3 days later. If you're a TV guy, you're 
    on your knees with pleasure. I mean, most TV viewing is at a glance, and, 
    "Yo! Saw you on TV," which makes you into a somebody; but what did you say? 
    They don't know. It's like a suppository. You went on, it was nice, it's over.	
    </font></p>
  <p><font size="3" color="#000000" face="Arial">And so for a person who does 
    this for a living, if someone can recall the subject -- do you know how many 
    times they -- you're on the 104 bus and they say: "Oh, how are you. I know 
    you from somewhere. Oh, yeah. The TV the other night, you did the, um … you 
    did the, um … oh, god. You did the, um … remind me. What did you do?" I say, 
    "Was it the talking hand?" "No, it wasn't the talking hand." I say, "Was it 
    the balloons in the … ." "No, it wasn't balloons. I just saw you." Well, that's 
    sort of deflating. Not to mix the metaphor.<br>
    <br>
    And so when you have a hit, truthfully, when you have a hit, is when someone 
    remembers something you said. I know it's a little sad and modest, but it's 
    true. And it is, however, the best thing. It is the best thing. As any teacher 
    can tell you. It's the best thing, if it's sticky. And I work as hard as I 
    possibly can to give you something to remember visually, so that you can attach 
    a thought to it. I mean, a lot of this fun and games is just really about 
    that. It's about giving you some hook that would help you remember the words 
    attached. The words in life are slippery and difficult. And the image is really 
    the trick. It's a seduction. The image gets you in, and the image hopefully 
    survives the experience.<br>
    <br>
    So you may not remember what I was doing with the cancer cell, but it had 
    something to do</font><font size=3 color=#000000 face="Times New Roman"> </font><font size=3 color=#000000 face="Arial">well, 
    so the surgery is the</font><font size=3 color=#000000 face="Times New Roman"> 
    </font><font size=3 color=#000000 face="Arial">no. Even … but, you know, if 
    I could get one of those four things remembered, I'd be okay. Why was he tearing 
    out the wires? But I remember the part about starving it, where they took 
    the blood out. That's okay. One out of four? That's okay.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Question: </b>You did a series last year, a longer show on ABC. 
    I still remember the string theory.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Robert Krulwich: </b>That was the nuttiest thing I ever tried.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Question: </b>I thought I finally understood string theory. What 
    was the reaction to that series, and will the network support more … ?<br>
    <br>
    <b>Robert Krulwich: </b>The reaction to the series was very strange, 
    I mean, among the audience. A lot of people did not say to me, what you said. 
    They said: So I followed it from A to B to C, but I decided that you really 
    don't understand string theory either. Because I couldn't quite figure out 
    at the end what you really were saying.<br>
    <br>
    And while that sounds like an insult that's fine. It's fine that I could take 
    a subject that no one in their right mind thinks that they can understand, 
    that I could hold them in place and get them through C. And the truth is, 
    I didn't really quite understand it. I went as far as I could go.<br>
    <br>
    So what you want to do, I think in these things, is you have to lower your 
    sights a little bit. I mean, you're not Tennessee Williams or William Shakespeare; 
    and the material you have also has to be true. And the other important that 
    I'm talking about in this lecture is that they have to appear to be true. 
    So if you're playing around in this more theatrical vein, you nevertheless 
    have to keep the credibility going somehow.<br>
    <br>
    The best kind of reviews sometimes, because in that particular case we had 
    kids bouncing balls on things, and there was a lot of weird stuff going on, 
    but a lot of people, if it is done right, don't pay any attention to the gimmicks.<br>
    <br>
    I once did a story about how the Federal Reserve works, in which I had a ballet 
    dancer tied completely around with chains. And I got a furious letter from 
    a member of the Fed; with copies to Larry Tish and the heads of CBS. It never 
    once mentioned the fact that it was a ballet dancer and that it was in chains; 
    he just said he thought the argument was erroneous on these, and these, and 
    these points. And I thought: This is wonderful.<br>
    <br>
    And the fact was, if that was done during the New Hampshire primary, and I 
    had the difficulty in primaries in those days anyway, all the correspondents 
    would go up to New Hampshire, and every room that was being worked on would 
    have an output, and there would be all these TV screens, and you could see 
    what was going on in every bay. So Leslie Stall was working here, and Dan 
    Rather was working here … and so their pictures were all <i>[mimics reporter 
    talk]</i>. And on one of the screens there was this ballet dancer tied up. 
    And everybody would look over in the corner and say, "Oh, man … "<br>
    <br>
    <b>Question:</b> What are you working on now?<br>
    <br>
    <b>Robert Krulwich: </b>For a future program? </font><font size=3 color=#000000 face="Arial"> 
    I'm working on a hip hop series; and I had to totally clear my head to do 
    this. Because last night I was with J.Z., a gentleman who, when he met a guy 
    with a bootlegged tape, stabbed him … and it was not a knife that was invited, 
    unlike any of your knives. The premise of this particular series is that music, 
    and a culture that seems very, very ugly on its face, full of vile language, 
    and all kinds of stereotyping and such, that when you get down under it and 
    start listening and looking through the people who are meeting at the clubs 
    and listening to the artists and just sort of meeting them, you discover that 
    it's something quite different than what it appears.<br>
    And that once you get past the rather pathetic 13, 14, and 15 year olds who 
    actually think they're gangsters with attitudes in Scarsdale, or whatever, 
    you then run into a bunch of older people, 19, 20, 21, and 22 year olds, who 
    are really using this music and the style and the culture that's associated 
    with it, to try all kinds of interesting experiments with each other and themselves. 
    Trying on skins, trying on each other's experiences, and just trying them 
    out for size. And there is a sort of very American, and very wonderful set 
    of … sort of a giant national drag ball going on, right below your eyes there. 
    </font><font size=3 color=#000000 face="Arial"><i>Nightline</i> will, so Ted 
    says, though he has to see it but he promises that he will at least give me 
    the chance for back-to-back-to-back three nights, talking about death jam 
    and so on. It doesn't have anything to do with science, but it has everything 
    to do with your younger brothers and sisters and your children.<br>
