<H3>GROUP 5- JACKS AND MACKERELS</H3>

<P><HR ALIGN=LEFT>This group includes most of the large, streamlined, silvery,
schooling, midwater, predators that are seen or caught in the vicinity of
Gray's Reef. Many are highly regarded food and game fishes. Jacks have a
narrow caudal peduncle and two free spines preceding the anal fin; the tunas
and mackerels have two or three keels on the caudal peduncle, a lunate caudal
Fm, and a series of finlets behind second dorsal and anal fins.</P>

YELLOW JACK <I>Caranx bartholomaei</I><BR>
</P>

<P>Body deep, fins distinctly yellowish in adults, juveniles silvery-yellow
and may have whitish blotches or a dark bar through the eye. Young are occasionally
seen in large schools near rocky outcrops at Gray's Reef. Massachusetts
to Brazil. 30 in.</P>

CREVALLE JACK, COMMON JACK <I>Caranx hippos</I><BR>
</P>

<P>Steep head, deep body, first rays of the second dorsal and anal fins
greatly elongated, color metallic green. The young have dark bars and are
sometimes confused with other species (e.g. pilotfish). Also called the
common jack because of its worldwide distribution and abundance, it is one
of the largest jacks and a powerful gamefish. Nova Scotia to Uruguay. 38
in.</P>

BAR JACK <I>Caranx ruber</I><BR>
</P>

<P>Body small, a pair of stripes (light blue and dark) runs along the base
of the dorsal fin across the caudal peduncle into the lower lobe of the
caudal fin. They are frequently seen near rocky outcrops at Gray's Reef
in small schools that tend to sweep upward and downward more than other
jacks. New Jersey to Brazil. 20 in.</P>

ROUND SCAD, CIGARFISH, CIGAR MINNOW <I>Decapterus punctatus</I><BR>
</P>

<P>Body small, slender and silvery; thickened scales (scutes) forming a
keel along the posterior lateral line; a dorsal and ventral finlet; two
fleshy projections of the shoulder girdle under the gill cover; small black
spots spaced on pored scales of curved lateral line. The mackerel scad (D.
macarellus), which lacks spots on lateral line, and the rough scad (Trachurus
lathami), which lacks terminal finlets, spots and has scutes present on
curved portion of lateral line, also occur at Gray's Reef but are less common.
This small jack is the commonest of the densely schooling baitfish at Gray's
Reef. Schools of hundreds to thousands are common near rocky outcrops. Nova
Scotia to Brazil. 5-7 in.</P>

PILOTFISH <I>Naucrates ductor</I><BR>
</P>

<P>Six or seven black bars on a silvery white background (the bars can fade
under the fish's control), long lateral keel on the caudal peduncle, snout
blunt, upper jaw narrow. Principally an oceanic species, this is another
fish that is found in close association with large fish, turtles, and ships.
Juveniles are often found in <I>Sargassum </I>seaweed and other floating
material. Worldwide; Nova Scotia to Argentina in the western Atlantic. 14
in.</P>

GREATER AMBERJACK <I>Seriola dumerili</I><BR>
</P>

<P>Body large, oblique darkish band through the eye extending to the base
of the first dorsal fin, amber stripe extending from the eye along the midline
of the body. The body color is darker drab above and silvery whitish below
occasionally with 7 dusky bars. The almaco jack <I>(S. rivoliana) </I>is
similar but has a deeper body with longer second dorsal and anal fin rays.
Largest of the jacks, it schools near reefs and will circle close to divers.
Though not a reef fish, big amberjacks have been observed venturing into
large crevice overhangs in search of reef-fish prey at Gray's Reef. Massachusetts
to Brazil. 36 in.</P>

PERMIT, ROUND POMPANO <I>Trachinotus falcatus</I><BR>
</P>

<P>Body deep, compressed; color silvery; tail deeply forked; anterior dorsal
and anal fins elongate. The palometa or longfinned pompano<I> (T. goodei)
</I>and the Florida pompano <I>(T. carolinus)</I> also occur on the Georgia
coast. The former is distinguished by several thin, dark bars and very elongate
dorsal and anal fins, the latter by shorter fins and a less deep, more ovoid
body. Massachusetts to Argentina. 8-10 in.</P>

LITTLE TUNNY, FALSE ALBACORE, BONITO <I>Euthynnus alleteratus</I><BR>
</P>

<P>Body robust, bullet-shaped; first dorsal fin high, concave; scales lacking
except for a corselet of thickened scales around the pectoral fin; distinct
dark spots between the pectoral and pelvic fins. This pelagic predator is
often caught on hook and line by trolling with lures near reefs. Massachusetts
to Brazil. 30 in.</P>

KING MACKEREL <I>Scomberomorus cavalla</I></P>

<P>Body large, elongate; lateral line curves sharply downward below the
second dorsal fin; 15 to 16 dorsal spines; 8-9 short gill rakers on lower
first gill arch. Young have yellow-bronze spots and are sometimes confused
with the Spanish mackerel <I>(S. maculatus)</I>. It is caught on hook and
line with live bait or by trolling. It is occasionally seen far above rocky
outcrops by divers at Gray's Reef. Maine to Brazil. 48 in.</P>

SPANISH MACKEREL <I>Scomberomorous maculatus</I><BR>
</P>

<P>Body elongate, laterally compressed; lateral line does not curve sharply
downward below the second dorsal fin; 13-15 rakers on lower first gill arch;
numerous yellow-bronze spots on a silvery iridescent bluish-green body ,anterior
third of its dorsal fin black. Young king mackerel<I> (S.. cavalla)</I>resemble
Spanish mackerel. It is caught on hook and line by trolling. Divers occasionally
observe rapidly swimming schools far above the rocky outcrops at Gray's
Reef. Maine to Brazil. 27 in.</P>
