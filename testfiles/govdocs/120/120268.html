<h3><em>Keeping loan repayments on track</em><br>
Women&#8217;s solidarity groups bring microfinance to the people </h3>

<p>Women in Senegal have proven that peer pressure can be a good thing. Just ask 
the carefully selected members of Santa Yalla, a homegrown loan association. </p>
<p>Santa Yalla, which means &#8220;praise God,&#8221; brings together women who 
partake of USAID-funded small loans from one of the only microfinance programs 
in the country&#8217;s southern Casamance region, the Association S&eacute;n&eacute;galaise 
pour l'Appui &agrave; la Cr&eacute;ation d'Activit&eacute;s Socio-Economiques 
(ASACASE). The women entrepreneurs make sure all loans are repaid. They have to 
be prudent &#8211; there&#8217;s simply too much at stake. </p>
<p>&#8220;This group is working concretely to promote women and fight poverty,&#8221; 
said Kathryn Lane, coordinator of USAID/Senegal&#8217;s Casamance program. &#8220;Their 
revenues are sound and they pay their loans on time. They are remarkably organized 
given that they live in a region troubled by conflict between government and armed 
separatist forces for two decades.&#8221; </p>
<p>Santa Yalla has branches in Bignona, Oussouye, and Ziguinchor districts of 
the Casamance, each with a president and a treasurer responsible for loan reimbursement. 
Women are divided into solidarity committees: if one member does not reimburse, 
the entire committee steps in to pay back the loan. To protect their collective 
interests, the committee scrutinizes each prospective member to make sure she 
is credible before bringing her onboard.</p>
<p>Each branch organizes an annual meeting to assess the situation before taking 
part in a general meeting in Ziguinchor. All committee members pay a yearly fee 
of 5,000 FCFA (about $10) and this money is put into Santa Yalla&#8217;s bank 
account. Each committee has its own account from which loans are awarded. USAID, 
through ASACASE, contributes its support to Santa Yalla, which in turn distributes 
the loan fund it to its different branches, from East to West.</p>
<p>A stone&#8217;s throw from Kafountine&#8217;s pristine tourist beaches in Senegal&#8217;s 
southwestern Casamance region, Sir&eacute; Man&eacute;, works to expand her smoked 
fish activity to neighboring Guinea. It&#8217;s business as usual this day as 
she prepares to ship off smoked sardinella, sompat grunt, crevalle jack, and sea 
catfish.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since I got the loan from ASACASE through Santa Yalla and built my oven 
I feel like I am really doing business,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;I frequently 
receive orders from Guinea and as you can see people travel from Guinea to Kafountine 
to buy products. I delivered an order yesterday and this gentleman in front of 
you is waiting his order. This indicates you that the business is going well.&#8221;</p>
<p>During one of her trips to Guinea she realized that the smoked fish market 
had expanded greatly, especially in Kindia, Lab&eacute;, and Z&eacute;r&eacute;kor&eacute;, 
and was far from being satisfied. &#8220;That is why I am doing everything I can 
to convince the rural community officials to allow me build more ovens,&#8221; 
said Man&eacute;, a mother of four grown children who has hired three full-time 
and 20 temporary workers to stoke her fires and market her fish.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a challenge for her to stay one step ahead of the game, but with 
her peers at Santa Yalla, she is making it happen. &#8220;Besides expansion we 
need consistent loans so we can compete with rich businessmen from the subregion 
who are now investing in the sector,&#8221; she said. Annual loans of up to $300 
made possible through the USAID program matched with some savings keep her fish 
business afloat. </p>
