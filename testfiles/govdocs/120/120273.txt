  Description: 
    Abstract: The Long-Term Monitoring at the East and West Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary 2002-2006
      data include biological and oceanographic measurements collected to satisfy the MMS and NOAA contracts
      1435-01-02-CT-85088 and 1435-01-04-CT-33137 through the monitoring year 2006.  The Flower Garden Banks are located
      in the northwest Gulf of Mexico and are unique within the region. The Flower Garden Banks are coral reefs with
      biological assemblages typical of Caribbean coral reefs, including approximately 23 Caribbean scleractinian coral
      species, a low abundance and diversity of sponges, and  reef fishes. These data are the result of yearly monitoring
      events and are used for comparison purposes required to complete technical reports and presentations. Statistical
      analyses, photographs, and videography are not included in this submission. On the East and West Flower Garden
      Banks there are 100 m by 100m study sites within which monitoring is conducted every year. The data included in
      this submission are from these study sites and include the following: (1) random transect benthic cover data
      obtained using videography (2002-2006), still photographs (2002-2003) and linear point intercept observer data
      (2002-2003).  Random transect data include the proportional cover of benthic components including coral species,
      sponges, algae, and other groups. (2) Sclerochronology data are taken during odd years to look at short-term
      (10 years) change in coral growth rates. (3) Photographs of marked Diploria strigosa colony margins are taken
      annually to track lateral growth or recession of colony margins over time. Data within this dataset start with
      comparisons between 2001 and 2002. (4) Repetitive 8m2 quadrat planimetry data follow specific coral colonies over
      time. Coral colonies are traced each year to measure lateral growth, loss, and/or replacement within a continuously
      monitored 8m2 area. Data within this dataset start with comparisons between 2001 and 2002. (5) Abiotic water
      quality parameters are recorded on a continual basis using YSI datasondes. Data include temperature, specific
      conductivity, dissolved oxygen concentration, dissolved oxygen charge, pressure, depth, pH, pHmV, par1, par2,
      turbidity, and salinity.  Additionally, HoboTemp thermographs are used as a back-up to record temperature. On YSI
      datasonde changeout cruises water samples are taken at surface, mid-water and at the benthos for nutrient and
      cholorphyll analysis. (6) Fish population surveys are completed to monitor fish species abundance and size from
      year to year.
    Purpose: The Long-Term Monitoring at the East and West Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary 2002-2006 data
      include biological and oceanographic data collected to satisfy the MMS and NOAA contracts 1435-01-02-CT-85088 and
      1435-01-04-CT-33137 through the year 2006.  The purpose of these biological and oceanographic data is to serve as
      a long-term record of the conditions of the coral reef communities within the East and West Flower Garden Banks
      study sites. MMS and NOAA continue environmental monitoring for continuity of data and for generating information
      needed for resource management and regulatory decision-making. In addition, the monitoring data are needed to
      validate and sustain the present understanding of MMS lease stipulations for providing effective mitigation of
      impacts to the offshore environment.
    Supplemental_Information: Biological Data includes corals, algae, and invertebrate data. Reef fish identified are

    Description_of_Geographic_Extent: The East Bank (27 54.5' N, 93 36.0' W) is located approximately 193 km southeast of
      Galveston, Texas. East Bank encompasses 67 km2, sloping from the shallowest point at 20 m to the terrigenous mud
      seafloor at a depth of 100-120 m. The eastern and southern edges of the bank slope steeply whereas the northern and
      western edges slope more gently. The West Bank (27 52.4' N, 93 48.8' W) is located 20 km west of East Bank, is located
      172 km southeast of Galveston and is more than twice as large (137 km2) as the East Bank. The three peaks that
      comprise the East Bank are aligned along an east-west axis. The middle high rises from a depth of 100-150 m to within
      18 m of the surface and supports coral reef habitat from 18 - 48 m.

        Classification_System_Modifications: A species list is provided in the original data files, but not all species were observed during the study. Only those species identified during the surveys are included in this metadata record. Higher level taxonomy of species was completed, and species synonyms were noted,  FOR THIS METADATA RECORD ONLY at the NODC using the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS) in conjunction with additional taxonomic and museum references as required.  No originator data has been altered at the NODC; higher level taxonomy is added at the NODC to selected biological metadata records as an aid to search engines which utilize metadata.
      Taxonomic_Procedures: GENERAL:  From video, transect monitoring,  and photography, corals were identified to
        species; sponges were combined into a single group; macroalgae were identified to species where possible and
        included anything longer than approximately 3 mm; crustose coralline algae turfs, fine turfs and bare rock were
        grouped as CTB. Reef fish and invertebrates identifed to genus and species when possible.
        
        FISH SURVEYS - Visual reef fish surveys were conducted on both East and West Banks. Size frequency distributions
        for two trophic guilds, herbivores and carnivores, were calculated as the proportion of the total number of
        herbivores or carnivores and represented as a percentage of individuals in the guild falling within different
        size categories (0-5 cm, 6-10 cm, 11-20 cm, 21-30 cm, 31-40 cm, and greater than 40 cm), based on average fish
        lengths recorded during the surveys. Parrotfishes (Scaridae), surgeonfishes (Acanthuridae), and yellowtail
        damselfish (Microspathodon chrysurus) comprised the herbivore guild, while snappers (Lutjanidae) and select
        groupers (Serranidae) comprised the demersal carnivore guild. The select groupers of the carnivore guild
        included yellowmouth grouper (Mycteroperca interstitialis), tiger grouper (M. tigris), graysby (Epinephelus
        cruentatus), and coney (E. fluvus) (Claro and Cantelar Ramos 2003; Pattengill- Semmens and Gittings 2003).
        
        INVERTEBRATES - The sea urchin Diadema antillarum and the spiny lobster Panulirus argus were identified and
        surveyed at night, at least 1.5 hours after sundown.
      Taxonomic_Completeness: To family, genus, and species; in-situ and photographic identification.
    General_Taxonomic_Coverage: Corals were identified to species; sponges were combined into a single group;
      macroalgae were identified to species where possible and included anything longer than approximately 3 mm;
      crustose coralline algae turfs, fine turfs and bare rock were grouped as CTB. Reef fish and invertebrates
      identifed to genus and species when possible.

    TRANSECT ANALYSES:
    Each transect was treated as a replicate at the scale of the study site, yielding an estimate of coral cover and
    the cover of other benthic categories. Percent covers were calculated for each transect from the resulting set of
    500 points. Data were collected on the point-counts of each coral species; sponges as a group; macroalgae to
    species; turf (greater than 3 mm), fine turf, crustose coralline algae and bare rock as a single category, CTB;
    and sand and other inanimate categories of substrate. Graphs were produced to allow the comparison of each reef in
    the average percent cover of major substrate types, coral species, coral functional types and algal functional
    types. Previous examination of means and variances, using different numbers of random dots, suggested that 500 dots
    per transect provide accurate and precise estimates of the coverage of benthic components, regardless of the length
    of the transects (Aronson et al. 1994; Carleton and Done 1995). Analyses of Variance (ANOVAs) were performed to
    test the null hypothesis that the two reefs did not differ in each type of univariate substratum cover. After tests
    for normality and homogeneity ANOVAs were calculated for each substratum variable with the statistical software
    SystatÂ® 5.0., only the data on macroalgae had to be transformed, using the arcsine transformation. Multivariate
    statistical techniques were used to compare how the two banks differed in coral species composition using the
    software package PRIMERÂ® 5.0.
    
    To place the data on coral cover in a regional context, we analyzed the species-specific coral cover data using
    multidimensional scaling (MDS). We pooled the species-specific point-count data for hard corals from the 14
    transects from each survey at a site in one year. Square-root

    Monitoring cruises were conducted aboard the M.V. Fling in October 2002, and April and August 2003. The general
    locations of the study sites are marked by permanent mooring buoys: FGBNMS permanent mooring number 2 at the East
    Bank and mooring number 5 at the West Bank. Subsurface buoys were installed at the corners of the 100m x 100m study
    sites at each bank to facilitate underwater relocation. Establishment of the perimeter and crosshairs subdivided
    each study site into four quadrants. To estimate the areal coverage of benthic components, fourteen, 10-m long
    transect tapes were randomly positioned at each study site. Coverage was estimated from these transects in three
    ways: still photography, videography, and visual assessment in the field. The linear-point intercept (LPI) method
    was used as well, to ascertain whether data recorded directly on the reef was different than data derived from
    either of the photographic methods. Four coral cores were extracted from Montastraea faveolata colonies at each
    bank in order to determine annual growth rates and any possible indicators of past coral bleaching events or other
    stressors.
    Diploria strigosa is the second largest contributor to coral cover at the FGB. For this reason D. strigosa lateral
    growth margins were monitored and photographed to detect changes, either as retreat or growth of margins, from year
    to year. Repetitive 8m2 quadrats were photographed and analyzed using random dot analysis (percent cover of species
    and coral condition) and planimetry (measure growth or loss of tissue over time) in order to monitor changes in
    coral reef community structure. Perimeter lines were videotaped each year to document change at known locations
    along the perimeter and within the study site. A general sense of coral condition and fish populations were
    obtained and compared from year to year. Physical and chemical characteristics of the seawater overlying the reef
    caps at the FGB were assessed by monitoring temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, pH, turbidity, and content in
    chlorophyll a, dissolved inorganic nitrogen, dissolved organic nitrogen, inorganic phosphorous, and trace metals.
    These water quality parameters were selected to characterize the environmental background in which the FGB coral
    reef resources exist. Surveys of fish assemblages were conducted at each bank in order to determine relative
    abundance and diversity of species. Surveys of sea urchins and lobsters were performed at night to determine
    abundance and distribution of populations.
    
    As repetitive quadrat and lateral growth (Diploria strigosa) stations were missing markers, displaced, or otherwise
    degraded in 2002, a site rehabilitation cruise was completed in April 2003. The goal of this cruise was to
    reestablish the initial sample size of forty repetitive quadrat stations and sixty lateral growth stations on the
    East and West Banks. A new numbering system was established and old stations were refurbished with new pins and
    tags, while a small number of new stations were established at each bank. Since the majority of stations were
    refurbished, the long-term dataset should not be affected for either the repetitive quadrat or lateral growth
    stations.

      Methodology_Description: All data were collected within the established 100m x 100m site at East Bank and West
        Bank in October 2002 and August 2003, except for a set of deep repetitive quadrats at East Bank, which were
        established in April 2003. The general locations of the study sites are marked by permanent mooring buoys: FGBNMS
        permanent mooring number 2 at the East Bank (27 degrees 53' 35.80 N, 93 degrees 38' 23.90 W) and mooring number 5
        at the West Bank (27 degrees 52' 50.86 N, 93 degrees 52' 25.34 W). Geographical Positioning System (GPS) positions
        taken of the site corners in 2002 allowed for quick site relocation and initial mapping of the four corners.
        Buoys were dropped from a launch to visually mark the corners from the surface and for quick location by divers.
        Divers used polypropylene lines to temporarily mark the perimeters of the study sites and the north/south and
        east/west center lines.  Metal rods were previously installed in the reef to demarcate monitoring stations.
        There were two types of permanent monitoring stations: (1) lateral growth stations on Diploria strigosa colonies
        marked by two short rods per station, and (2) 8m2 repetitive quadrats, the centers of which were marked by a tall
        rod (0.5 m long). Due to the poor condition of many of the existing rods, a site-rehabilitation was conducted in
        April 2003. At the East Bank, 60 lateral growth station pins were installed, 48 of these were replacements for
        existing pins and 12 were new stations. At the West Bank, 60 lateral growth station pins were installed and 43 of
        these were replacement pins, while 17 were new station pins. Forty repetitive quadrat station pins were installed
        at the East Bank in April 2003 and 31 of these were replacements for existing pins. At the West Bank, 40 repetitive
        quadrat station pins were installed and 36 of these were replacement pins, while 4 new repetitive quadrat pins
        were installed. A new numbering system was assigned to the new rods. Eighty new repetitive quadrats (Station
        numbers 1-40 at East Bank and 41-80 at West Bank) and 120 new lateral growth stations (1-60 at East Bank, 61-120
        at West Bank) were established. Additionally, in April 2003 nine deep repetitive quadrat stations (station numbers 81-89)
        were established at East Bank in 33-40 m water depth.

      Methodology_Description: The first method in this study for estimating benthic coverage, still photography,
        involved using a Nikonos V camera equipped with a 28-mm lens and dual strobes, mounted on an aluminum framer,
        that allowed the camera lens to be 1.0 m above the substratum. The bottom of the framer was wrapped in foam
        to protect the reef from damage. Cameras were loaded with Kodak Ektachrome EliteChrome 200 ASA 36-exposure
        color slide film and set to f11 and a distance of 0.8 m. One strobe was set on TTL and the other on slave.
        Seventeen photographs were taken on the right side of the transect in a consecutive, non-overlapping fashion
        along each transect at each site. Earlier reports reported that each photograph captured 44 x 63 centimeters
        (cm) of the benthos (2772 cm2). Through visual assessment of the photographs in 2002 and 2003, we noted that
        the foam edge of the framer appeared along one or more edges of the photograph in some instances. With the
        framer measurements and information on the camera lens, we determined that each photograph in fact covered
        an area of 78 x 52 cm (4056 cm2) using the factory lens information from Nikonos. Since coral cover was
        calculated as percent cover, a relative measure, this did not affect results except for the total area
        surveyed.

      Methodology_Description: In the videographic protocol, a diver swam slowly along each transect, videotaping
        at a height of 40 cm from the substratum, using a digital video camera in an underwater housing fitted with
        a wide-angle lens and underwater video lights. A depth gauge and scaling bar were attached to an aluminum
        bar that projected forward from the video housing. The gauge and bar ensured that the camera remained a
        constant distance from the bottom. By holding the video camera perpendicular to the substratum and swimming
        slowly along the transect it was possible to produce clear stop-action images for analysis (Aronson et al.
        1994; Murdoch and Aronson 1999).
        
        The video frames covered a 40-cm wide swath along each of the 10-m transects, for a total area of 4 m2 per
        transect, or 56 m2 videotaped per site per year. Each video frame was 40 x 27 cm, or 1080 cm2. These
        dimensions were smaller than those of the still photographs. The reason for the difference is that the
        videographic technique is designed to enable investigators to identify corals and many other sessile
        invertebrates to species down to a colony size of approximately 3 cm. This level of precision is not
        currently possible using video frames that record larger areas of the substratum.
        Data from the digital videotapes were collected and analyzed according to the Murdoch Automated Video
        Analysis method, as follows. A set of 42 video frames was captured from each video transect using a Macintosh
        PowerBook G4 with the software Adobe PhotoshopÂ® version 6.02 and the PhotoDV image capture plug-in software
        produced by RadiusÂ®. The time taken to film each transect was measured and divided into 42 equal time
        divisions and rounded down to the nearest 1/60th second time interval. Once the software captured each set
        of frames for each transect, a series of digital filters was applied to each image to enhance image quality.
        Substrate cover was assessed from the 20 evenly numbered, non-overlapping frames from the set of 42 images.
        Odd-numbered frames were intentionally captured so as to overlap even-numbered frames. Odd frames were only
        used to allow the researcher to obtain an alternate view of the area around objects in the analyzed frames
        when objects were obstructed or unclear in the even frames. Otherwise, oddnumbered frames were not used in
        the analysis. Unused odd frames were deleted from the digital image set after analysis.
        
        After image capture and enhancement, the image frames from each site had an image of a randomly placed set
        of 25 dots added as a separate layer. In the 2002 analysis the dot images added to the captured video frames
        were selected at random from a previously produced batch of 100 random-dot images. A program developed by
        Murdoch automatically carried out the process of randomly selecting each image of random dots and placing
        it on each frame of the entire data-set for each reef site. In 2003, unique random-dot images were generated
        and pasted automatically to each video frame after capture using a new program. After random-dot placement
        the image files from each transect were visually assessed and the data entered into project-specific
        Microsoft Excel spreadsheets.

      Methodology_Description: The third method of assessment, visual estimation, consisted of a diver swimming
        along each transect, recording the substratum component underlying each 10-cm mark along the tape, for a
        total of 100 points recorded per transect. The linear point-intercept (LPI) method has proven effective
        at estimating areal coverage of benthic components on coral reefs, particularly where the diversity of
        corals and other taxa is low (Ohlhorst et al. 1988; Rogers et al. 1994; Aronson and Precht 1995, 1997), as
        it is at the FGB.
        Each transect was treated as a replicate at the scale of the study site, yielding an estimate of coral
        cover and the cover of other benthic categories. Percent covers were calculated for each transect from the
        resulting set of 500 points. Data were collected on the point-counts of each coral species; sponges as a
        group; macroalgae to species; turf (greater than 3 mm), fine turf, crustose coralline algae and bare rock
        as a single category, CTB; and sand and other inanimate categories of substrate. Graphs were produced to
        allow the comparison of each reef in the average percent cover of major substrate types, coral species,
        coral functional types and algal functional types. Previous examination of means and variances, using
        different numbers of random dots, suggested that 500 dots per transect provide accurate and precise
        estimates of the coverage of benthic components, regardless of the length of the transects (Aronson et al.
        1994; Carleton and Done 1995).

      Methodology_Description: Sclerochronology is the determination of annual growth rates through the
        measurement of accretionary growth bands in coral core samples taken perpendicular to coral growth. Four
        cores were extracted from Montastraea faveolata colonies at each bank during the 2003 monitoring cruise.
        A SCUBA tank-powered pneumatic drill, fitted with a diamond tipped 7.62-cm lapidary bit, was used to
        extract cores from the center of large M. faveolata heads. Cores were 30 millimeters (mm) in diameter
        and 50 mm long, providing seven years of growth. The hole left from core extraction was filled with a
        preformed limestone plug inscribed with the date of core extraction

      Methodology_Description: Cores were longitudinally sectioned into 3- to 4-mm thick slabs using a
        single-blade diamond impregnated rock saw. Coral slabs were arranged on Kodak brand Industrix 400
        x-ray film and exposed to x-rays (70kV 15ma with an exposure time of 7 sec) to reveal annual density
        bands. Growth of the Montastraea faveolata colonies sampled was determined directly by measuring
        distances from high density to high density band. Three measurements were made along a single growth
        band and averaged for an estimate of growth rate per year.

      Methodology_Description: Diploria strigosa is the second largest contributor to coral cover at the FGB
        (Bright et al. 1984). For this reason D. strigosa lateral growth margins are monitored to detect
        changes, either as retreat or growth of margins. In 2002, 54 and 43 lateral growth stations were
        photographed at the East Bank and West Bank, respectively. During the site rehabilitation cruise in
        April 2003 sixty lateral growth stations were refurbished and/or installed on each bank. At the East
        Bank 12 new stations were established and 48 old lateral growth stations were refurbished with new
        pins and tags, for a total of 60 lateral growth stations, numbered 1-60. At the West Bank 17 new
        stations were installed, while 43 old lateral growth station pins were refurbished with new pins and
        tags, for a total of 60 new lateral growth stations, numbered 60-120. Divers tagged and photographed
        all lateral growth stations that they saw in August 2003, even if they did not have a new tag,
        therefore the number of photographed lateral growth stations exceeded 60 at each bank in 2003, and
        included new stations, refurbished stations as well as old untagged stations. Sixty-two colonies of
        Diploria strigosa on East Bank and 64 colonies on West Bank were photographed to assess coral margin
        growth rates in August 2003.
        Divers were equipped with a Nikonos V camera with a 28 mm lens (underwater application, 144x216 mm
        field, 1/6 reproduction ratio), Nikonos close-up kit and strobe. The camera was set at f22 and a
        distance of infinity, and the strobe set to TTL. This produced 13.3 x 19.7-cm (262.01-cm2) photographic
        images. The framer was placed on corner pins at each station, ensuring a repeated image of the station.
        Many stations had missing station identification tags. Those stations that did have tags were photographed
        with the tag in the frame. For stations without tags, the current photographs were matched with past
        photographs using the ridge patterns of the Diploria colonies.

      Methodology_Description: To monitor changes in coral reef community structure, repetitive 8m2 quadrats
        were photographed and analyzed in two ways. The first method of analysis measured percent benthic
        cover components in 2002 and 2003 using random dot analysis. To determine whether specific coral
        colonies grew or lost tissue laterally, selected corals within repetitive quadrats were analyzed using
        planimetry to measure growth or loss of tissue of available matches between 2001, 2002, and 2003. Due
        to the variability from year to year in photographs, dominant frame building corals that predominate
        the FGB (Montastraea spp., Diploria strigosa, Colpophyllia natans) were selected based on their
        visible margins, these corals tended to be closer to the center of the photograph.
        In 2002, 31 and 34 repetitive quadrat stations were photographed at East Bank and West Bank
        respectively. In April 2003 during the site-rehabilitation cruise pins and tags were refurbished for
        established repetitive quadrat stations, as well as the installation of new stations to return the
        sample size to 40 repetitive quadrats at each bank. At the East Bank thirty-one existing repetitive
        quadrat stations were refurbished and 9 new stations were installed, for a total of 40 repetitive
        quadrat stations, numbered 1-40. At the West Bank thirty-six stations were refurbished and 4 new
        stations were installed, for a total of 40 repetitive quadrat stations, numbered 40-80. Because divers
        tagged and photographed all repetitive quadrat stations they saw, whether they had a new tag or not,
        the number of stations photographed in 2003 exceeded 40 at each bank, these included refurbished
        stations, old non-refurbished stations and newly established stations. In 2003, 41 and 44 repetitive
        quadrats were photographed at East Bank and West Bank, to track changes of 8m2 repetitive quadrats
        over time.
        Twenty image pairs for the East Bank and 31 image pairs for the West Bank were analyzed between
        2002-2003. Less than forty quadrats were analyzed at each bank because the rehabilitation cruise
        replaced old pins as well as establishing new pins, therefore the same 40 repetitive quadrats were not
        necessarily photographed between 2002 and 2003. The rehabilitation cruise has corrected this for
        future analysis. Stations were photographed using a T-bar camera frame with a Nikonos V camera mounted
        in the middle, loaded with Kodak Ektachrome EliteChrome 200 ASA, 36-exposure slide film and a 15mm
        lens (distance equals 2m, f-stop equals 8). Two Ikelite 225 watt-second strobes were mounted on the
        ends of the T-bar and set on TTL and slave (Gittings et al. 1992). The camera was positioned in a due
        north direction to ensure repetitive photographs from year to year. The consistent orientation of the
        camera was achieved with a compass and a bubble level. Nine additional deep stations at 32-40 m depth
        were established at East Bank by MMS and NOAA in April 2003 and photographed in August 2003 using the
        technique described above. The first comparison data will be available in 2005. The deep repetitive
        quadrat pins were mapped in relation to each other and in relation to the U-bolt at the base of
        FGBNMS mooring number 2, for ease of location. Depths were recorded for each pin, while distances were
        not measured and remain relative.

      Methodology_Description: Perimeter lines were videotaped each year to document change at known locations along
        the perimeter and within the study site. A general sense of coral condition and fish populations is obtained
        and compared year to year. Divers videotaped two 100 m segments of the perimeter lines at the East (north
        and east) and West Bank (south and west) in 2002 and 2003. At the East Bank, divers started at the NW corner
        and videotaped the north line to the NE corner, then swam the east line to the SE corner. At the West Bank,
        divers captured footage of the south and west lines, starting at the SE corner and ending at the NW corner.
        The videographer maintained approximately 2 m distance above the benthos using a weighted line, attached to
        the video housing. The camera was held at a 45 degree angle to capture the substratum. At each corner divers
        recorded a 360 degree panoramic view of the reef before continuing on to video the line.
        The video footage was reviewed to record the general condition of coral health and fish populations along
        the perimeter of the study sites using IMovie (Macintosh software). Individual coral heads displaying
        disease, bleaching, paling, and tissue loss due to fish biting were identified and recorded. Analysis
        categories were as follows: bleaching, paling, healthy colony, concentrated fish biting, isolated fish biting
        (damselfish territory), increased tissue loss due to concentrated fish biting, increased tissue loss due
        isolated fish biting, growth infilling (tissue regrowth), new incident of concentrated fish biting, surface
        replaced by turf algae, and unchanged. Concentrated fish biting (CFB) is the concentrated biting which
        removes the coral polyps completely from an affected area, and may be due to activity of the parrotfish,
        Sparisoma viride. Isolated fish biting describes less dense and smaller scale fish biting, typically
        representative of damselfish territories. No disease was documented and therefore was not characterized.
        Affected coral colonies were compared between 2002 and 2003, and changes in their condition were recorded.
        In addition, coral species composition and fish counts were documented. These analyses were qualitative and
        therefore no statistical analyses were conducted.

      Methodology_Description: Physical and chemical characteristics of the seawater recorded over the reef cap and in the vicinity of the FGB characterize local water quality (Gittings et al. 1992; CSA 1996; Nowlin et al. 1998; Dokken et al. 1999; Dokken et al. 2003; this study). From October 2002 to March 2004, the water quality overlying the reef caps at the FGB was assessed by monitoring temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, pH, turbidity, and content in chlorophyll a, dissolved inorganic nitrogen (ammonia [NH4+ and NH3], nitrate [NO3 -], and nitrite [NO2-]), dissolved organic nitrogen (Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen [TKN]), inorganic phosphorous (soluble reactive phosphorous, a soluble inorganic form of phosphorous directly taken up by plant cells), and trace metals (chromium, mercury). These water quality parameters were selected to characterize the environmental background in which the FGB coral reef resources exist. As well as serving as a valuable record of environmental parameters, any changes in coral reef biota which may be linked to water quality changes, could be verified by looking at the water quality data.

      Methodology_Description: Reef-fish surveys were conducted in October of 2002 and August of 2003. Fishes
        were visually assessed using SCUBA and a stationary visual census technique (Bohnsack and Bannerot 1986).
        Observations of fishes were restricted to an imaginary cylinder with a radius and height of 7.5 m from
        the diver. All fish species observed within the first five minutes of the survey were recorded.
        Immediately following, additional time was used to record abundance (number of individuals per species)
        and total length (cm) (minimum, maximum, and average) of those species noted in the first five minutes.
        Surveys lasted from 10 to 15 minutes. When necessary, species identifications were verified using Humann
        (1994) and Humann and DeLoach (2002). Depth, visibility, temperature, and survey location were also
        recorded.
        An average of 16 surveys each were performed at East and West Banks in 2002 and 2003. The fewest surveys
        (14) occurred at the East Bank in year two. Survey dives began in the early morning, before other dive
        activities were started, generally between 0700 and 0900, and were repeated by two to three divers
        throughout the day until dusk. Two days were spent surveying each bank, except at the West Bank in year
        one (2002), in which all 16 surveys were completed in one day. Individual survey locations were spread
        evenly within the 100m x 100-m study site to achieve maximum coverage of the reef habitat while excluding
        sand patches. The visibility for all surveys was greater than 10 m, with 25 to 30 m being most common in
        year one and 20 m being the average in year two. Survey depths ranged from 19 to 25 m at the West Bank and
        16 to 23 m at the East Bank.
        Fish densities are expressed as the number of fish per 100-m2 horizontal area. For each bank and year,
        densities were calculated as the mean number of individuals recorded per species, with each diver survey
        acting as a replicate, divided by the horizontal area of the survey cylinder (176.7 m2). Relative abundance
        for each species is expressed as the percentage of the total number of times the species was recorded out
        of the total number of surveys for the site (bank and year). Species richness is the expression of the
        total number of species for each site (bank and year). Size frequency distributions for two trophic guilds,
        herbivores and carnivores, were calculated as the proportion of the total number of herbivores or
        carnivores and represented as a percentage of individuals in the guild falling within different size
        categories (0-5 cm, 6-10 cm, 11-20 cm, 21-30 cm, 31-40 cm, and greater than 40 cm), based on average fish
        lengths recorded during the surveys. Parrotfishes (Scaridae), surgeonfishes (Acanthuridae), and yellowtail
        damselfish (Microspathodon chrysurus) comprised the herbivore guild, while snappers (Lutjanidae) and
        select groupers (Serranidae) comprised the demersal carnivore guild. The select groupers of the carnivore
        guild included yellowmouth grouper (Mycteroperca interstitialis), tiger grouper (M. tigris), graysby
        (Epinephelus cruentatus), and coney (E. fluvus) (Claro and Cantelar Ramos 2003; Pattengill-Semmens and
        Gittings 2003).

      Methodology_Description: The sea urchin Diadema antillarum and the spiny lobster Panulirus argus were
        surveyed at night, at least 1.5 hours after sundown. Two belt transects were surveyed along the northern
        and western boundaries in 2002 and the southern and eastern boundaries in 2003 at the East and West Bank.
        Each belt transect was 100 m long and 1 meter wide for a total of 200 m2 surveyed along site boundaries
        each year. Additional sea urchin and spiny lobster surveys were conducted along the 14 random transects
        (140 m2), for a total of 340 m2 surveyed per bank per year.

      Methodology_Description: Accurate maps showing individual coral heads and sand patches of the FGB monitoring
        sites were deemed necessary for use in the field as well as for long-term analysis. Once a more detailed
        and accurate map is established the individual station markers (repetitive quadrat and lateral growth
        stations) can be georeferenced using GPS. Two mapping techniques, sector-scan and side-scan sonar were
        tested to produce the best quality map of the study sites at FGB. Sector-scan sonar relies on a mechanically
        rotated transducer, mounted on a tripod at a fixed position above the seabed, to produce an acoustic image
        of an area surrounding the sensor. Side-scan sonar involves towing a sensor (towfish) behind a moving boat.
        The towfish contains two transducers, which scan opposite sides of the towfish path through the water
        column.
        Sector-scan sonar was deployed only at East Bank in August 2003. The MS1000 sonar (Kongsberg Simrad
        Mesotech, Ltd.), and the MS1000 acquisition software were employed and sonar images displayed on the
        computer screen in a radial pattern, resembling radar. The software stored images as bitmaps, so image
        quality adjustments were made prior to capturing the screen display. Resolution was dependent upon the
        scan speed selected in the acquisition software and on the physical specifications of the sonar head. The
        slowest scan speed (X1) correlated with the highest screen resolution and was used for data acquisition at
        East Bank.
        A model 1071-series high-resolution sonar head (P/N 974-23030000), was deployed at the East Bank. This
        transducer operated at an acoustic frequency of 675 kHz and rotated mechanically at intervals of 0.225
        degrees. It has a horizontal beam width of 0.9 degrees and a vertical beam width of 30 degrees. The MS1000
        data acquisition software was set to image the seabed out to a range of 40 m from the transducer, so the
        entire East Bank study site could be recorded by four overlapping scans. A full rotation of the transducer
        lasted 1.5 minutes. At this range each screen pixel represents a geographic area measuring 0.17 by 0.17 m;
        however, the circumferential resolution ranges from 0.17 (equivalent to the beam width at a range of 10.8
        m) to 0.63 m at the maximum range of 40 m. This resulted in resolution degradation beyond a range of 10.8 m.
        The transducer head was deployed at an approximate height of 2.1-2.4 m above the seabed using an aluminum
        tripod with adjustable legs. Two divers deployed the tripod using a lift bag for assistance. Tripod legs
        were padded to minimize damage to substratum. The tripod was positioned near the center of each study
        quadrant prior to recording each series of scans. The tripod was oriented using a magnetic compass so that
        the top of each image would be directed toward magnetic north. Diver air bubbles marked the location of
        the nearest study site corner pin as quadrants were scanned, since the geographic positions of these
        corners had been previously mapped using GPS. Knowing the orientation of each image and having one known
        geographic location marked in each image would allow scans to be overlaid on the study area boundary.
        Balloons were partially inflated by divers and suspended above each monitoring pin prior to recording
        images. Since air produces strong acoustic reflections, it was hypothesized that these balloons would be
        visible in the images against the background of coral, revealing the exact position of markers (repetitive
        quadrat pins).
        Side-scan sonar was used to map both East Bank and West Bank. The side-scan towfish (Edgetech DF1000)
        operated at a frequency of 500 kHz, with a horizontal beam width of 0.5 degrees and a vertical beam width
        of 50 degrees tilted down 20 degrees from horizontal. The DF1000 sampled an analogue signal and transmitted
        a digital data stream through the tow cable. This process eliminated signal attenuation due to the length
        of the cable and reduced disruption by electrical noise on board the survey vessel. The towfish was
        deployed from a 50 m length of cable off the starboard stern. The towpoint at the stern was locating 2.5 m
        above the water and 13.4 m directly aft of the GPS antenna. The horizontal layback distance of the towfish
        behind the stern varied with vessel speed from 47.9 to 48.9 m, averaging 48.4 m, as the towfish ranged in
        depth beneath the surface from about 8 to 12 m.
