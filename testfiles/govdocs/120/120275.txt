  Description:
    Abstract:
      The Big Cypress national Preserve Fish Inventory database contains
      records of the inventory of freshwater fishes of the Big Cypress
      National Preserve (BICY) conducted by the National Audubon Society's
      Tavernier Science Center as part of the National Park Service (NPS)
      Inventory and Monitoring Project.  The database includes data from
      October 2002 through April 2004.

      The Big Cypress National Preserve Fish Monitoring and Assessment data
      collections for aquatic animals from BICY were begun in July 2004. 
      The spreadsheet contains worksheets for Raccoon Point, L28, and Bear
      Island.
    Purpose:
      Although a major ecosystem of the South Florida area, the Big Cypress
      National Preserve (BICY), is poorly understood in biological terms. To
      detect changes in natural and artificial habitats resulting from
      Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) restoration programs,
      baseline data on constituent aquatic communities and their ecology are
      needed before and after restoration actions. Fishes and aquatic
      invertebrates serve as indicators of the health of these wetlands.
      These organisms are also important because they are major prey for
      many of the characteristic South Florida predatory species, especially
      alligators and wading birds.

      This project has several objectives, the foremost of which is to
      continue a program of aquatic study in BICY begun in 2002. Work will
      be performed in partnership with National Audubon Society (NAS) and
      the National Park Service to design and implement a spatially and
      temporally explicit, quantitative sampling program for aquatic animals
      in BICY. This program will 1) provide baseline data which may be used
      to track changes in hydrology as a result of CERP projects 2) document
      the distribution, composition, and habitat use by native and
      introduced aquatic animals to evaluate the effects of CERP on BICY
      aquatic habitats, and 3) provide ecological data for use in the ATLSS
      fish simulation model used to plan and evaluate restoration actions
      during CERP (presently, inappropriate data from the Everglades are
      being used in the model for cells that lie in BICY). The strategy used
      to accomplish these goals will be to employ techniques used by the
      co-principal investigators in establishing monitoring programs in the
      Everglades (since 1977) and the mangrove zone of Florida Bay (since
      1989).

      Taxonomic_Procedures:
        Sampling was conducted according to a stratified design based on
        habitat type. The majority of sites were located within 250 meters
        of roads or trails passable by truck to simplify access. Sites were
        also reached by boat, all-terrain vehicle, helicopter, and airboat
        when these means of transportation were available. Habitat
        heterogeneity made random selection of sites difficult, particularly
        during the dry season, as no sufficiently detailed hydrology data
        existed to insure that randomly selected sites would be inundated.
        In those cases, sites were haphazardly selected to insure the
        presence of standing surface water.

        The diversity of habitat types in Big Cypress presents considerable
        challenges to the development of a comprehensive sampling regime, as
        the effectiveness of any given methodology varies between habitats.
        To compensate for this, numerous techniques were employed during
        this study. A variety of fish traps have been used extensively, as
        well as electrofishing gear, gill nets, cast nets, dip nets, and
        angling.

        The location of each sampling site was recorded as universal
        transverse mercator (UTM) coordinates using a Garmin Etrex Vista
        GPS.

        Project personnel collected and curated representative vouchers for
        all captured species whenever practical. Specimens too large to
        effectively preserve have been documented photographically using a
        digital camera. Vouchers have been collected independently for each
        habitat type sampled. Additionally, to ensure complete spatial
        coverage of the preserve, vouchers of each species have been
        collected from the north, central, and southern regions of Big
        Cypress. Information regarding each voucher was entered into the
        project Access database, and each was assigned a unique identifier
        to link with related sampling information. Voucher collection is an
        ongoing process and will continue for the duration of the study. 
        Upon completion of this project, vouchers will be transferred to an
        NPS-identified repository.
      Taxonomic_Completeness:
        For each sample, all specimens were identified to species, and total
        catch per species recorded.  Total lengths.were measured for the
        first 20 randomly selected individuals of each species to obtain a
        representative size distribution. Water temperature, pH, salinity,
        and dissolved oxygen were measured for each site when possible,
        however, instrumentation problems precluded this for much of the
        year. Project personnel borrowed a Hydrolab 4a minisonde and
        datalogger from the BICY hydrology department to resolve these
        problems. For electrofishing expeditions, water conductivity was
        determined using a YSI-33 conductivity meter.
    General_Taxonomic_Coverage: Specimens were identified to species.

Data_Quality_Information:
  Logical_Consistency_Report:
    Sampling was conducted according to a stratified design based on habitat
    type. The majority of sites were located within 250 meters of roads or
    trails passable by truck to simplify access. Sites were also reached by
    boat, all-terrain vehicle, helicopter, and airboat when these means of
    transportation were available. Habitat heterogeneity made random
    selection of sites difficult, particularly during the dry season, as no
    sufficiently detailed hydrology data existed to insure that randomly
    selected sites would be inundated. In those cases, sites were
    haphazardly selected to insure the presence of standing surface water.
  Completeness_Report:
    Only the June/July 2004 sampling was conducted due to funding being
    redirected.
  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
        The location of each sampling point was recorded using a Garmin
        Etrex Vista GPS unit.

    Methodology:
      Methodology_Type: Field
      Methodology_Description:
        A variety of fish traps were used extensively as well as
        electrofishing gear, gill nets, cast nets, dip nets, and angling.

        Opportunistic sampling was conducted using light-tackle,
        hook-and-line fishing with a variety of lures and live or dead
        baits. Lines of baited hooks were also occasionally deployed in
        canals in attempts to catch catfish, although hoop nets proved
        substantially more effective. Finally, sight records were kept for
        any species observed in the field that could be positively
        identified without being captured.

      Process_Description:
        Sampling was conducted according to a stratified design based on
        habitat type. The majority of sites were located within 250 meters
        of roads or trails passable by truck to simplify access. Sites were
        also reached by boat, all-terrain vehicle, helicopter, and airboat
        when these means of transportation were available. Habitat
        heterogeneity made random selection of sites difficult, particularly
        during the dry season, as no sufficiently detailed hydrology data
        existed to insure that randomly selected sites would be inundated.
        In those cases, sites were haphazardly selected to insure the
        presence of standing surface water.

        The diversity of habitat types in Big Cypress presents considerable
        challenges to the development of a comprehensive sampling regime, as
        the effectiveness of any given methodology varies between habitats.
        To compensate for this, numerous techniques have been employed
        during this study. A variety of fish traps have been used
        extensively, as well as electrofishing gear, gill nets, cast nets,
        dip nets, and angling.

        TRAPS: Traps provide a means of sampling with a standardized unit of
        effort and are suitable for use in virtually any habitat. They are
        also relatively portable, and therefore suitable for work in remote
        locations. They have the disadvantage of having inherent selection
        biases, based both on trap construction, and size and behavior of
        targeted species. To attempt to minimize these, we deployed a
        variety of small-fish traps simultaneously. These included Gee-type
        minnow traps, box traps, collapsible mesh traps, and Breder traps.
        Soak times were generally 24 hours, although one-hour sets were also
        performed. Small-fish traps were consistently fished unbaited and
        relied on passive encounters to generate captures.

        Hoop nets were used to sample larger fishes in deeper water. They
        were fished unbaited with or without leads, and were also baited
        with cheese to selectively target catfish species that had proved
        difficult to obtain otherwise. The hoop nets used here were 1.4
        meters in overall length and were constructed from four 50-cm
        diameter fiberglass hoops and tar-coated twine with a 2.5 cm mesh
        size. The nets had two throats and an approximately 15 cm diameter
        aperture. Typically, hoop nets were deployed for 24-hour intervals.

        Electrofishing: Electrofishing was conducted in locations where
        habitat composition allowed. Two electrofishing setups were used.
        The first utilized a boat-mounted Smith-Root type 6A electrofisher
        with a maximum current output of 1008 volts DC at 120 pulses per
        second or 720 volts AC at 60 hertz. It was used extensively for
        sampling in canals but was too large to penetrate into other
        habitats. Effort was generally standardized by conducting 100-meter
        transects, although opportunistic sampling around structures such as
        bridge pilings was conducted as well.

        Forested habitats and marshes were sampled using a small barge
        carrying a Smith-Root model 2.5 GPP electrofisher with a maximum
        current of 1000 volts at either 120 pulses per second DC or 60 hertz
        AC. The barge drew only several centimeters of water and was only a
        meter wide, but still could not penetrate into heavily vegetated
        habitats. Samples were standardized to 300 seconds of total shock
        time.

        NETS: Experimental gill nets were used to sample canal fishes. Two
        nets each composed of 4 242 cm deep x 180 wide cm panels were fished
        in tandem. The first had mesh sizes of 1.2, 2.5, 3.7, and 5 cm while
        the second was composed of panels with mesh of 6.2, 7.6, 8.8, and 11
        cm. Nets were typically set from 1 to 4 hours. Reptile entanglements
        were problematic when using these nets. Encounters with alligators
        were particularly damaging, precluding longer sets.

        While unsuitable for providing quantitative data, cast nets were
        used extensively in an opportunistic fashion to capture species
        sighted in canals. The cast nets had a radius of 180 cm and a 1.2 cm
        mesh size. Dip nets were used for sampling in dense vegetation.
        These nets had fine mesh (<1mm) and were the most effective method
        for collecting small species, such as least killifish (Heterandria
        formosa) and Everglades pygmy sunfish (Elassoma evergladei).

        OTHER: Opportunistic sampling was conducted using light-tackle,
        hook-and-line fishing with a variety of lures and live or dead
        baits. Lines of baited hooks were also occasionally deployed in
        canals in attempts to catch catfish, although hoop nets proved
        substantially more effective. Finally, sight records were kept for
        any species observed in the field that could be positively
        identified without being captured.

        Measurements

        We recorded the location of each sampling site as universal
        transverse mercator (UTM) coordinates using a Garmin Etrex Vista
        GPS. For each sample, all specimens were identified to species, and
        total catch per species recorded. We measured total lengths for the
        first 20 randomly selected individuals of each species to obtain a
        representative size distribution. Water temperature, pH, salinity,
        and dissolved oxygen were measured for each site when possible,
        however, instrumentation problems precluded this for much of the
        year.  We borrowed a Hydrolab 4a minisonde and datalogger from the
        BICY hydrology department to resolve these problems. For
        electrofishing expeditions, water conductivity was determined using
        a YSI-33 conductivity meter.

        Voucher Specimens

        We collected and curated representative vouchers for all captured
        species whenever practical. Specimens too large to effectively
        preserve have been documented photographically using a digital
        camera.  Vouchers have been collected independently for each habitat
        type sampled. Additionally, to ensure complete spatial coverage of
        the preserve, vouchers of each species have been collected from the
        north, central, and southern regions of Big Cypress. Information
        regarding each voucher was entered into the project Access database,
        and each was assigned a unique identifier to link with related
        sampling information. Voucher collection ws an ongoing process and
        continued for the duration of the study.  Upon completion of this
        project, vouchers will be transferred to an NPS-identified
        repository.
