assessments. It is compiled by <a href="http://www.tera.org/">Toxicology Excellence
for Risk Assessment</a> (TERA) and contains over 650 chemical
records. ITER provides a comparison of international risk
assessment information in a side-by-side format and explains
differences in risk values derived by different organizations.
ITER data, focusing on hazard identification and dose-response
assessment, is extracted from each agency&rsquo;s assessment and
contains links to the source documentation.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd><a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/factsheets/ccrisfs.html">CCRIS</a> (Chemical Carcinogenesis
Research Information System).

graphics, sounds and animation to convey connections between
chemicals, the environment, and the public's health. The Town,
City, Farm, U.S. Mexico Border and Port are designed to provide
facts on toxic chemicals found in everyday locations, information
about how the environment can impact human health, non-technical
descriptions of chemicals, links to authoritative chemical
information on the Internet, and Internet resources on
environmental health topics. Tox Town's target audience is
students above elementary-school level, educators, and the
general public. It is a companion to the extensive information in
the TOXNET collection of databases that are typically used by
toxicologists and health professionals. Tox Town also offers some
resources in Spanish (<a href=

</dd>
<dd><a href="/pubs/factsheets/trifs.html">Toxics Release
Inventory</a> (TRI)
<dl>
<dd>A series of databases that describe the releases of toxic
chemicals into the environment annually for the 1987-2006
reporting years. TRI is mandated by the Emergency Planning and
Community Right-to-Know Act and is based on data submitted to the
EPA from industrial facilities throughout the U.S. These data
include the names and addresses of those facilities, and the
amounts of certain toxic chemicals they release to the air,
water, or land, or transfer to waste sites. Information is
included on over 650 chemicals and chemical categories. Pollution
prevention data are also reported by each facility for each
chemical.  There were two changes to reporting requirements for the 2006 data.  Facilities were required to submit appropriate North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes rather than the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes previously used. To do trends analysis, EPA assigned NAICS codes to prior years’ data, so now both SIC codes and NAICS codes are searchable on TOXNET.  EPA also expanded Form A eligibility to include  PBT chemicals in 2006.</dd>
