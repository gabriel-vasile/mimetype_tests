PURPOSE

Recent advances in cancer biology, molecular biology, combinatorial chemistry, 
and screening technology provide unprecedented opportunities for discovery of 
new agents for the treatment and prevention of diseases.  Drug discovery can 
now be focused on specific molecular or regulatory sites within the diseased 
cell. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) considers exploitation of this 
knowledge and technology for discovery of new cancer therapies a high priority  
(<a href="http://plan.cancer.gov/">http://plan.cancer.gov/</a>).  It is expected that research focused on discovery 
and validation of new targets and screening design efforts to identify agents 
that affect these targets will result in a multitude of new chemical and 
biological agents with the potential for clinical benefit.  However, before 
such agents can be tested and used widely in patients, safety and acceptable 
toxicity to critical organs must be demonstrated.  Current practices and 
procedures for safety evaluations are costly and time consuming utilizing 
large amounts of compound and animals.  Thus, it is impractical to evaluate 
large number of compounds, as well as analogs in a chemical series, identified 
from new high throughput molecular target based screening models using 
traditional methods.
 
Similarly these scientific advances provide opportunities to develop new and 
innovative tests to determine the toxicity of environmental chemicals. The 
National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) has been directed 
by Congress to develop and validate alternatives for acute and chronic 
toxicity testing that will reduce or eliminate the use of animals. In 2000 the 
NIEHS convened an international workshop on in vitro methods for assessing 
acute systemic toxicity. The results of this meeting can be found at 
<a href="http://iccvam.niehs.nih.gov/methods/invidocs/finalall.pdf">http://iccvam.niehs.nih.gov/methods/invidocs/finalall.pdf</a>.   Recommendations 
include suggestions for research, development and validation efforts that 
would further advance the usefulness of in vitro methods especially those 
directed at specific organ toxicities.  

This PA encourages the development, standardization, and validation of new and 
innovative assays that determine or predict specific organ toxicities (e.g., 
hematotoxicity, cardiotoxicity, gastrointestinal toxicity, hepatotoxicity, 
nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity, bladder toxicity, neurotoxicity, pulmonary 
toxicity, and endocrine toxicity, including pancreatic beta cell toxicity) as 
well as new methodology for high throughput toxicity screening that involves 
the use of molecular endpoints, computer modeling, proteomics and genomics.  
The development of these toxicity assays and their incorporation early in the 
development process would assist in the evaluation and prediction of human 
sensitivity and allow for more cost efficient evaluations of numerous analogs 
prior to the selection of the ultimate drug development candidate. 

This PA must be read in conjunction with the current OMNIBUS SOLICITATION OF 
THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH for  SMALL BUSINESS INNOVATION RESEARCH 
(SBIR) and SMALL BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER (STTR) GRANT APPLICATIONS:  
<a href="/grants/funding/sbirsttr1/index.pdf">http://grants.nih.gov/grants/funding/sbirsttr1/index.pdf</a>.

All of the instructions within the OMNIBUS SOLICITATION apply with the 
following exceptions:
  
o  Special receipt dates    
o  Initial review convened by the NCI, Division of Extramural Activities    
o  Additional review considerations

For this PA, the Modular Grant format will not be used.

This PA will utilize the SBIR and STTR mechanisms, but will be run in parallel 
with a PA of identical scientific scope that will utilize the 
Exploratory/Developmental Grants mechanism, 
<a href="/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-02-074.html">http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-02-074.html</a>.

RESEARCH OBJECTIVES

Background

Recent advances in all branches of medical sciences provide new insight into 
the underlying mechanisms in malignancy and suggest new targets and approaches 
to therapy.  Drug discovery can now be focused on targeting key regulatory 
pathways or specific macromolecules relevant to cancer.  For example, key 
growth regulatory pathways and genes mutated in cancer cells are being 
identified and array technology for expression of thousands of genes as well 
as computer-assisted evaluation of data are available.  New technologies in 
chemistry that allow facile synthesis of millions of new chemicals, and high 
resolution structures of important target proteins are becoming available.  
These advances taken together and coupled with high throughput screening allow 
identification of large numbers of agents that could be seriously considered 
for clinical evaluation.  Translation of these new technological discoveries 
and innovations into clinical benefit for the cancer patient through these 
newly discovered agents is essential, however, the later stages in this drug 
development process are lengthy and costly.  Obviously new procedures are 
necessary to decide which of the multitude of new agents should be tested in 
animals and then in humans.  In addition, these scientific advances can be 
extremely useful for the development of new toxicity models with novel 
endpoints to determine either therapeutic agent or environmental chemical 
toxicity.

Investigations focusing on the toxicity of potential cancer, AIDS or other 
drugs or biologicals to healthy organs in intact experimental animals are the 
final steps in the preclinical stages of new drug development.  Data generated 
from these studies on each new drug are evaluated in light of potential human 
toxicity and form a major portion of the information required by the Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) for an Investigational New Drug (IND) application.  
Preclinical toxicology studies are generally conducted in two animal species 
with the following objectives: to define the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), 
Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), schedule-dependency of toxicity, 
reversibility of adverse effects, and a safe clinical Starting Dose (SD).  The 
animal studies required to obtain such information for an IND application have 
significant limitations, both in terms of cost and time requirements as well 
as prediction of problems to be encountered when agents are administered to 
humans.  For example, since animal studies are very expensive and time-
consuming, it is generally impractical to evaluate numerous analogs of a 
chemical series or large numbers of possible candidates from a high throughput 
screening program.  Another concern is the lack of information gained from 
animal toxicology studies in regard to molecular mechanisms for observed 
toxicities.  It cannot be determined if toxicities of new agents designed to 
attack a key molecular target are related to actions of inhibition of that 
target or to other unknown aspects of the drug"s action in various organs.

The National Toxicology Program (NTP) is an interagency program located at 
NIEHS, whose mission is to evaluate agents of public health concern by 
developing and applying tools of modern toxicology and molecular biology. 
Currently the NTP tests chemicals of environmental or occupational concern 
using study designs similar to that used in preclinical toxicology studies  
described above including 30 and 90 day toxicity studies, two year bioassay to 
determine the carcinogenic potential of chemicals, two generation studies to 
determine reproductive toxicity and in utero exposure to determine 
developmental toxicity. The goal of the NTP and NIEHS is in line with the goal 
of the NCI and the other NIH Institutes participating in this PA: to develop 
new and novel alternative toxicity tests that could replace or reduce the 
animal tests and in addition provide mechanistic information on the target 
environmental agent that would aid in intervention/prevention efforts.

New technology to improve toxicology approaches and define toxicity at the 
molecular level are emerging, but as yet none has been validated and accepted 
for common use.  New technology will be highly valuable when combined with 
other approaches to develop a total toxicological profile of specific organ 
toxicity and molecular mechanisms responsible for this toxicity.  In this 
regard, the NIEHS has recently established the National Center for 
Toxicogenomics (NCT) (<a href="http://www.niehs.nih.gov/nct/home.htm">http://www.niehs.nih.gov/nct/home.htm</a>).  One of the 
major goals of the NCT is to determine the usefulness of genomics data in the 
development of alternative toxicity tests.  Data analysis software programs 
are being written to predict toxicological endpoints.  Individually, these 
activities may not be sufficient, but they may be highly valuable when 
combined with other approaches to develop a total toxicological profile of 
specific organ toxicity and molecular mechanisms responsible for this 
toxicity.

Objectives and Scope

The goals of this PA are the discovery, development and validation of new 
assays and procedures to determine quickly and cheaply toxicological profiles 
of potential therapeutic drugs and environmental agents.  It is expected that 
a molecular definition of toxicity in the affected organ, tissue or cell would 
be a component of the procedure.  Approaches for new toxicology assays in 
response to this initiative are broad and are determined by the creativity of 
the applicant.  Genetically modified animals or cell lines, various non-
mammalian organisms, in vitro assays utilizing primary mammalian cells (human 
cells are of particular interest), tissue slices, isolated organs, sub-
cellular fractions or purified enzymes could be utilized for the model.  
Computer modeling utilizing existing biological and toxicological data bases 
would be appropriate.  Genomic and proteomic technology could be exploited to 
profile total gene activity or protein expression and thereby establish 
molecular correlations with specific toxicities.  Molecular endpoints to 
evaluate toxicity and high throughput toxicity screening could be used to help 
decide which agent of a chemical series should be pursued, to allow 
exploration of toxicity at an earlier stage in drug development, to define the 
toxicity profile of agents selected for clinical trial or to define the 
toxicity profile of agents selected for clinical trial or for which there is 
significant environmental exposure.

Applicants should be aware of the activities of the Inter Agency Coordinating 
Committee for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ICCVAM), a part of the 
NTP: <a href="http://iccvam.niehs.nih.gov">http://iccvam.niehs.nih.gov</a>. ICCVAM has prepared documents and 
instructions relating to the validation and regulatory acceptance of 
alternative methods that will be helpful in writing the application and in 
proper validation of the methods/tests proposed.

The NCI, through the Developmental Therapeutics Program:  
<a href="http://dtp.nci.nih.gov/">http://dtp.nci.nih.gov/</a>, on occasion utilizes its internal resources to foster 
drug development.  For this PA, drugs and toxicology data from previous drug 
development sponsored by NCI may be made available to awardees.  For 
additional information contact Dr. Adaline C. Smith at the address listed 
under INQUIRIES.

available in the NIH Guide for Grants and Contracts, October 19, 2001 at 
<a href="/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-02-004.html">http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-02-004.html</a>.

The SBIR/STTR OMNIBUS SOLICITATION is available electronically through the 
NIH, Office of Extramural Research Small Business Funding Opportunities web 
site: <a href="/grants/funding/sbirsttr1/index.pdf">http://grants.nih.gov/grants/funding/sbirsttr1/index.pdf</a>.  Application 
instructions are also available at this site.  Helpful information for 
preparation of the application can be obtained at:  
<a href="/grants/grant_tips.htm">http://grants.nih.gov/grants/grant_tips.htm</a>

THE TITLE AND NUMBER OF THIS PA MUST BE TYPED ON LINE 2 OF THE FACE PAGE OF 
THE APPLICATION.

All instructions within the solicitation apply with the following exceptions:
- special receipt dates
- initial review convened by the NCI Division of Extramural Activities
- additional review considerations

Applications can be submitted for Phase I or Phase II support, or as a 
combined Phase I and II (FAST-TRACK).  A Phase II application will be accepted 
only as continuation of a previously funded Phase I grant.  The Phase II 
proposal must be a logical extension of the Phase I research but not 
necessarily a Phase I project supported in response to this initiative.  
   
The OMNIBUS SOLICITATION indicates the normal levels of support and period of 
time for SBIR and STTR Phase I and Phase II awards.  However, some toxicology 
model discovery and validation projects are likely to require longer time 
periods and/or larger budgets to accomplish the proposed aims.  Therefore, if 
adequately justified, budgets up to $250,000 total costs per year (direct 
costs, indirect costs, and profit/fee) and time periods up to 2 years for 
Phase I and $650,000 total costs per year (direct costs, indirect costs, and 
profit/fee) and up to 4 years for Phase II can be requested.  For FAST-TRACK 
applications the total duration of Phase I plus Phase II cannot exceed 5 
years.

PHASE I:  Demonstration of feasibility of the innovative approach.  Research 
should be proposed to provide sufficient reason to continue the assay 
development in Phase II.  It would be expected that assay methodology would be 
established.  If two years of support are requested, the goals for the first 
year should be clearly stated and not simply a reiteration of specific aims.  
Support for the second year will be contingent upon Institute programmatic 
evaluation to ensure that investigators are accomplishing the goals presented.

PHASE II:  Development of approach to a stage at which the assay can be used 
for toxicology purposes.  Extensive studies designed to validate the approach 
would be expected.  Validation should include analysis of compounds with known 
organ toxicities and should follow the ICCVAM guidelines.  Innovative aspects 
of the research necessary to complete the projects such as development of new 
in vivo models that may require "surrogate endpoints" should be clearly 
described.  Goals and milestones for each year of support should be clearly 
presented.  Support for years two to four, if requested, is dependent upon 
Institute programmatic review of progress and achievement of the proposed 
goals.  For example, if a goal such as identification of a known toxicity is 
not achieved, the continuation years may not be supported.

FAST TRACK: Applications may be submitted for combined Phase I and Phase II, 
FAST TRACK consideration as described in the OMNIBUS SOLICITATION.  However, 
due to the complex nature of toxicological assay development, it is 
recommended that only well defined and more advanced projects be proposed for 
support through this mechanism.  

Phase I, FAST TRACK applications must specify clear, measurable milestones 
that should be achieved prior to Phase II funding.  Failure to provide such 
information in the Phase I application and/or sufficient detail in the Phase 
II application may be sufficient reason for the peer review committee to 
exclude the Phase II from consideration.  If so, the applicant may apply later 
for Phase II support.  Such applications will be reviewed by an appropriate 
scientific review group convened by the NIH. 

Special provisions described in this PA pertaining to Phase I and Phase II 
also apply to FAST TRACK applications.

An additional requirement of all Phase II and FAST TRACK applications is the 
Product Development Plan.  The small business must submit a Product 
Development Plan (limited to ten pages) as an Appendix to the Phase II 
application addressing the four areas described in the instructions for PHS 
398, Chapter VI, Section C. 9. j. 

Potential applicants are encouraged to contact program staff for guidance and 
to read the advice and information on the web sites.  However, responsibility 
for planning, direction, and execution of the proposed research will be solely 
that of the applicant.

The completed original application and three legible copies must be sent or

APPLICATIONS HAND-DELIVERED BY INDIVIDUALS TO THE NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE 
WILL NO LONGER BE ACCEPTED.  This policy does not apply to courier deliveries 
(i.e. FEDEX, UPS, DHL, etc.) (<a href="/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-CA-02-002.html">http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-
files/NOT-CA-02-002.html</a>)  This change in practice is effective immediately.  
This policy is similar to and consistent with the policy for applications 
addressed to Centers for Scientific Review as published in the NIH Guide 
Notice <a href="/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-02-012.html">http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-02-012.html</a>.

APPLICATION PROCESSING: Applications must be received by or mailed before the 
receipt dates listed at the top of the first page of this PA.  The CSR will 
not accept any application in response to this PA that is essentially the same 
as one currently pending initial review unless the applicant withdraws the 
pending application.  The CSR will not accept any application that is 
essentially the same as one already reviewed.  This does not preclude the 
submission of a substantial revision of an application already reviewed, but 
such application must include an Introduction addressing the previous 
critique.

PEER REVIEW PROCESS

Upon receipt, applications will be reviewed by CSR staff for completeness and 
by NCI or another participating Institute program staff for adherence to 
guidelines.  Incomplete applications and applications not adhering to 
instructions described above will be returned to the applicant without further 
review.

Applications that are complete and adhere to the guidelines of this PA will be 
evaluated for scientific and technical merit and the documented ability of the 
investigators to meet the RESEARCH OBJECTIVES of this PA by an appropriate 
peer review group convened by the NCI, Division of Extramural Activities, in 
accordance with the peer review criteria listed below.

As part of the initial merit review, all applications will:

o Receive a written critique
o Undergo a selection process in which only those applications deemed to have 
the highest scientific merit, generally the top half of applications under 
review, will be discussed and assigned a priority score
o Those that receive a priority score undergo a second level review by the 
appropriate advisory council(s) of NCI, NIDCD, NIDDK, NIDA or NIEHS.

REVIEW CRITERIA

Review criteria are described in the OMNIBUS SOLICITATION and are as follows:

1.  The soundness and technical merit of the proposed research.  (Preliminary 
data are not required for Phase I proposals.)

2.  The qualifications of the proposed Principal Investigator, supporting 
staff, and consultants.

3.  The scientific, technical, or technological innovation of the proposed 
research.

4.  The potential of the proposed research for commercial application or 
societal impact.

5.  The appropriateness of the budget requested.

6. The adequacy and suitability of the facilities and research environment.

7.  Where applicable, the adequacy of assurances detailing the proposed means 
for (a) safeguarding human or animal subjects and/or (b) protecting against or 
minimizing any adverse effect on the environment.

For this PA the following points will also be considered during review.  The 
goals of NIH-sponsored research are to advance our understanding of biological 
systems, improve the control of disease, and enhance health. Within this 
framework, the specific goals of this PA are the discovery and validation of 
new and innovative assays which predict specific toxicities of potential drugs 
and environmental agents.  Assays developed under this PA would be expected to 
be effective for a quick and cost effective determination of  toxicity of 
specific compounds and, importantly, to decrease the number of animals 
required. The reviewers will comment on the following aspects of the 
application in their written critiques in order to judge the likelihood that 
the proposed research will have a substantial impact on the pursuit of these 
goals.  Each of the criteria will be addressed and considered in assigning the 
overall score, weighting them as appropriate for each application. Note that 
the application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged 
likely to have a major impact and thus deserve a high priority rating.  For 
example, an important research project may be proposed which does not present 
novel and innovative technology but which is essential to develop an 
innovative model.

SIGNIFICANCE.  
Does the study address an important problem?  Does the proposed project have 
commercial potential to lead to a marketable product or process?  What may be 
the anticipated commercial and societal benefits of the proposed activity?  If 
the aims of the application are achieved, how will scientific knowledge be 
advanced?  Does the proposal lead to enabling technologies (instrumentation, 
software, etc.) for further discoveries?   Will the technology have a 
competitive advantage over existing/alternative technologies that can meet the 
market needs?

APPROACH.  
Are the conceptual framework, design, methods, and analyses adequately 
developed, well-integrated, and appropriate to the aims of the project?  Is 
the proposed plan a sound approach for establishing technical and commercial 
feasibility?  Does the applicant acknowledge potential problem areas and 
consider alternative strategies?  Are the milestones and evaluation procedures 
appropriate?

INNOVATION.  
Does the project challenge existing paradigms or employ novel technologies, 
approaches or methodologies?  Are the aims original and innovative?

INVESTIGATOR.  
Is the Principal Investigator capable of coordinating and managing the 
proposed SBIR/STTR?  Is the work proposed appropriate to the experience level 
of the Principal Investigator and other researchers including consultants and 
sub-contractors  (if any)?

ENVIRONMENT.  
Is there sufficient access to resources (equipment, facilities, etc.)?  Does 
the scientific and technological environment in which the work will be done 
contribute to the probability of success?  Do the proposed experiments take 
advantage of unique features of the scientific environment or employ useful 
collaborative arrangements?

For Phase II applications: In addition to the above criteria, to what degree 
was progress toward the Phase I objectives met and feasibility demonstrated in 
providing a solid foundation for the proposed Phase II activity? Is there a 
detailed validation plan?

For Phase I/Phase II Fast Track applications, the following additional 
criteria will be applied: Does the Phase I specify clear, measurable goals 
(milestones) that should be achieved prior to initiating Phase II?  Did the 
applicant submit a concise Product Development Plan that adequately addresses 
the four areas described in Section 9.j in the Instructions for the SBIR/STTR 
applications?  To what extent was the applicant able to obtain letters of 
interest, additional funding commitment and/or resources from private sector 
or non-SBIR/STTR funding sources that would enhance the likelihood for 
commercialization?  The initial review group will evaluate the specific goals 
for both the R43 and R44 phase.  A single priority score will be assigned to 
each application.  The initial review group has the option of recommending 
support for a shorter duration than that requested and basing the final merit 
rating on the recommended portion of the application.  For FAST TRACK 
applications, this may result in a recommendation that only the R43 phase be 
supported. 

ADDITIONAL REVIEW CRITERIA: In addition to the above criteria, your 
application will also be reviewed with respect to the following:

PROTECTIONS:  
The adequacy of the proposed protection for humans, animals, or the 
environment, to the extent they may be adversely affected by the project 
proposed in the application.

INCLUSION:  
The adequacy of plans to include subjects from both genders, all racial and 
ethnic groups (and subgroups), and children as appropriate for the scientific 
goals of the research.  Plans for the recruitment and retention of subjects 
will also be evaluated. (See Inclusion Criteria included in the section on 
Federal Citations, below).

BUDGET:  
The reasonableness of the proposed budget and the requested period of support 
in relation to the proposed research.

AWARD CRITERIA

Applications submitted in response to a PA will compete for available funds 
with all other recommended SBIR and STTR applications.  Portions of the SBIR 
and STTR allotments will not be designated for this initiative.  The following 
will be considered in making funding decisions:  

o Scientific merit of the proposed project as determined by peer review
o Availability of funds 
o Relevance to program priorities

FAST TRACK, Phase II applications may be funded following submission of the 
Phase I progress report and other documents necessary for continuation.  Phase 
II applications will be selected for funding based on the initial priority 
score, grant Program staff"s assessment of the Phase I progress and 
determination that Phase I goals were achieved, the project"s potential for 
commercial success, and the availability of funds.

REQUIRED FEDERAL CITATIONS 

MONITORING PLAN AND DATA SAFETY AND MONITORING BOARD: Research components 
involving Phase I and II clinical trials must include provisions for 
assessment of patient eligibility and status, rigorous data management, 
quality assurance, and auditing procedures.  In addition, it is NIH policy 
that all clinical trials require data and safety monitoring, with the method 
and degree of monitoring being commensurate with the risks (NIH Policy for 
Data Safety and Monitoring, NIH Guide for Grants and Contracts, June 12, 1998: 
<a href="/grants/guide/notice-files/not98-084.html">http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not98-084.html</a>).  

Clinical trials supported or performed by NCI require special considerations.  
The method and degree of monitoring should be commensurate with the degree of 
risk involved in participation and the size and complexity of the clinical 
trial.  Monitoring exists on a continuum from monitoring by the principal 
investigator/project manager or NCI program staff or a Data and Safety 
Monitoring Board (DSMB).  These monitoring activities are distinct from the 
requirement for study review and approval by an Institutional review Board 
(IRB).  For details about the Policy for the NCI for Data and Safety 
Monitoring of Clinical trials see: 
<a href="http://deainfo.nci.nih.gov/grantspolicies/datasafety.htm">http://deainfo.nci.nih.gov/grantspolicies/datasafety.htm</a>.  For Phase I and II 
clinical trials, investigators must submit a general description of the data 
and safety monitoring plan as part of the research application.  See NIH Guide 
Notice on "Further Guidance on a Data and Safety Monitoring for Phase I and II 
Trials" for additional information: <a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-00-038.html">http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-
files/NOT-OD-00-038.html</a>.  Information concerning essential elements of data 
safety monitoring plans for clinical trials funded by the NCI is available:  
<a href="http://www.cancer.gov/clinical_trials/">http://www.cancer.gov/clinical_trials/</a>

INCLUSION OF WOMEN AND MINORITIES IN CLINICAL RESEARCH:  It is the policy of 
the NIH that women and members of minority groups and their sub-populations 
must be included in all NIH-supported clinical research projects unless a 
clear and compelling justification is provided indicating that inclusion is 
inappropriate with respect to the health of the subjects or the purpose of the 
research. This policy results from the NIH Revitalization Act of 1993 (Section 
492B of Public Law 103-43).

All investigators proposing clinical research should read the AMENDMENT "NIH 
Guidelines for Inclusion of Women and Minorities as Subjects in Clinical 
Research - Amended, October, 2001," published in the NIH Guide for Grants and 
Contracts on October 9, 2001 (<a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-02-001.html">http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-
files/NOT-OD-02-001.html</a>), a complete copy of the updated Guidelines are 
available at 
<a href="/grants/funding/women_min/guidelines_amended_10_2001.htm">http://grants.nih.gov/grants/funding/women_min/guidelines_amended_10_2001.ht
m</a>.   The amended policy incorporates: the use of an NIH definition of 
clinical research, updated racial and ethnic categories in compliance with 
the new OMB standards, clarification of language governing NIH-defined Phase 
III clinical trials consistent with the new PHS Form 398, and updated roles 
and responsibilities of NIH staff and the extramural community.  The policy 
continues to require for all NIH-defined Phase III clinical trials that: a) 
all applications or proposals and/or protocols must provide a description of 
plans to conduct analyses, as appropriate, to address differences by 
sex/gender and/or racial/ethnic groups, including subgroups if applicable, 
and b) investigators must report annual accrual and progress in conducting 
analyses, as appropriate, by sex/gender and/or racial/ethnic group 
differences.

INCLUSION OF CHILDREN AS PARTICIPANTS IN RESEARCH INVOLVING HUMAN SUBJECTS:  
The NIH maintains a policy that children (i.e., individuals under the age of 
21) must be included in all human subjects research, conducted or supported 
by the NIH, unless there are scientific and ethical reasons not to include 
them. This policy applies to all initial (Type 1) applications submitted for 
receipt dates after October 1, 1998.

All investigators proposing research involving human subjects should read the 
"NIH Policy and Guidelines" on the inclusion of children as participants in 
research involving human subjects that is available at 
<a href="/grants/funding/children/children.htm">http://grants.nih.gov/grants/funding/children/children.htm</a>. 

REQUIRED EDUCATION ON THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECT PARTICIPANTS:  NIH 
policy requires education on the protection of human subject participants for 
all investigators submitting NIH proposals for research involving human 
subjects.  You will find this policy announcement in the NIH Guide for Grants 
and Contracts Announcement, dated June 5, 2000, at 
<a href="/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-00-039.html">http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-00-039.html</a>.  A 
continuing education program in the protection of human participants in 
research in now available online at: <a href="http://cme.nci.nih.gov/">http://cme.nci.nih.gov/</a>

HUMAN EMBRYONIC STEM CELLS (hESC): Criteria for federal funding of research on 
hESCs can be found at <a href="/grants/stem_cells.htm">http://grants.nih.gov/grants/stem_cells.htm</a> and at  
<a href="/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-02-005.html">http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-02-005.html</a>.  Only 
research using hESC lines that are registered in the NIH Human Embryonic Stem 
Cell Registry will be eligible for Federal funding (see <a href="http://escr.nih.gov">http://escr.nih.gov</a>).   
It is the responsibility of the applicant to provide the official NIH 
identifier(s)for the hESC line(s)to be used in the proposed research.  
Applications that do not provide this information will be returned without 
review. 

URLs IN NIH GRANT APPLICATIONS OR APPENDICES: All applications and proposals 
for NIH funding must be self-contained within specified page limitations. 
Unless otherwise specified in an NIH solicitation, Internet addresses (URLs) 
should not be used to provide information necessary to the review because 
reviewers are under no obligation to view the Internet sites.  Furthermore, 
we caution reviewers that their anonymity may be compromised when they 
directly access an Internet site.

HEALTHY PEOPLE 2010: The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to 
achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives of "Healthy 
People 2010," a PHS-led national activity for setting priority areas. This PA 
is related to one or more of the priority areas. Potential applicants may 
obtain a copy of "Healthy People 2010" at 
<a href="http://www.health.gov/healthypeople">http://www.health.gov/healthypeople</a>.

AUTHORITY AND REGULATIONS: This program is described in the Catalog of Federal 
Domestic Assistance Nos. 93.395, 93.847, 93.848, 93.849 and 93.115, and is not 
subject to the intergovernmental review requirements of Executive Order 12372 
or Health Systems Agency review.  Awards are made under authorization of 
Sections 301 and 405 of the Public Health Service Act as amended (42 USC 241 
and 284) and administered under NIH grants policies described at 
<a href="/grants/policy/policy.htm">http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/policy.htm</a> and under Federal Regulations 
42 CFR 52 and 45 CFR Parts 74 and 92. 

The PHS strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free 
workplace and discourage the use of all tobacco products.  In addition, Public 
Law 103-227, the Pro-Children Act of 1994, prohibits smoking in certain 
facilities (or in some cases, any portion of a facility) in which regular or 
routine education, library, day care, health care, or early childhood 
development services are provided to children.  This is consistent with the 
PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and mental health of the 
American people.
