Toxicology reports can give us some insights into fatal occupational 
injuries.  However, lack of uniformity in reporting toxicology results 
across States limits the usefulness of the data.




Workers under the influence of drugs or alcohol are a serious concern in 
the workplace today.  Although the magnitude of the substance abuse 
problem at work is difficult to measure, the goal of maintaining alcohol 
and drug free workplaces has been addressed repeatedly by industry and 
government alike.

An informative approach to defining the magnitude of the problem of drug 
and alcohol use among workers is to evaluate the traumatic deaths that 
occurred in the workplace and attempt to correlate those deaths with the 
recent use of drugs or alcohol.  To this end, an evaluation of 
toxicology data for individuals who died as a result of fatal 
occupational injuries and whose toxicology reports were submitted to the 
Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) for the Census of Fatal Occupational 
Injuries (CFOI) has been completed for the reporting years 1993 and 1994.

The Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries is the primary source of 
information on fatal work injuries in the United States.  Diverse data 
sources are used to compile comprehensive information on each 
occupational fatality, including industry, occupation, type of event, 
equipment involved, demographic characteristics, and circumstances of 
the fatal incident.  Summary data are issued annually about 8 months 
after the end of the calendar year.

Methods

In the fatality census program, participating State agencies attempt 
to collect comprehensive information on all fatal work injuries.  The 
source documents used to identify and describe occupational fatalities 
often include toxicology information about the decedent.  The toxicology 
reports provide information on whether alcohol, drugs, and other toxic 
substances were present in the deceased and, if so, at what levels. A 
variety of sources provided toxicology results: Police accident 
reports, medical examiner and coroner reports, autopsy reports, and 
follow-back questionnaires.  In addition to unintentional fatal injuries 
such as falls and motor vehicle crashes, the study also covered 
intentional injuries such as suicides and homicides that occurred 
during the time the victim was at work.

During 1993 and 1994, 6,331 and 6,632 fatal occupational injuries, 
respectively, were reported nationwide.  Thirty-two States gathered 
toxicology reports for 1,899 fatalities in 1993; 23 states did so 
for 1,242 fatalities in 1994.

Based on the information available, the majority of the toxicological 
analyses were performed using specimens that were obtained post-mortem 
or during resuscitative efforts in the pre-hospital or emergency 
department phase of care.

Cases that showed positive results for nicotine and caffeine were 
excluded from the analysis because neither is generally associated 
with cognitive or psychomotor impairment.   Cases that showed exposures 
from toxic substances in the work environment, such as carbon monoxide 
and other noxious gases, also were excluded.


Toxicology data limitations

Toxicology reports were available for approximately one-fourth of the 
occupational fatalities in the study periods.  Some toxicology reports 
are not available for research because of confidentiality policies in 
the county or State in which the fatality occurred, or because of 
pending litigation related to the incident.

Collecting toxicology data and accurately categorizing the effects 
substance use may have had on fatal occupational injuries is especially 
challenging to the State agencies that participate in the BLS fatality 
census.  It would be optimal for all States to collect and report this 
information for all fatal work injuries in a uniform fashion to make 
region-to-region, State-to-State, and case-to-case comparisons possible.  
Because drug use patterns may vary by region of the country, industry, 
or occupation of the workers, the fact that toxicology reports were 
not available for large numbers of fatalities limits the analysis of 
substance use patterns.  Data from missing reports could significantly 
change the results of this analysis.

Furthermore, toxicology reports are collected only for deceased 
workers.  Reports are not collected for coworkers, perpetrators of 
violence, or others whose actions may have contributed to the fatal 
incident.

In addition to the lack of universal reporting in the study, the 
lack of uniformity in drug and alcohol testing of decedents affects 
the ability to draw conclusions about the data.  Not all decedents 
reviewed in this study were tested for all substances: Some were 
checked only for the presence of alcohol, whereas others were tested 
for both drugs and alcohol.  Some jurisdictions test and report drug 
presence in urine only, others test and report blood test results 
only, and others may do both.  Still other jurisdictions test and 
report on other body fluids such as vitreous humor alcohol levels.

Also, it is generally accepted that the toxicokinetics of post-mortem 
drug and alcohol levels are poorly defined.  It is unknown at present 
what percentage may be due to post-mortem fluid shifts, post-mortem 
absorption, and even post-mortem putrefaction.

Finally, some of the decedents in the study died immediately as the 
result of the incident, and others survived the initial event only to 
die in the hospital later.  Of the latter group, some of the drugs 
reported may be from therapeutic interventions.  For example, an 
individual who is injured in an automobile accident while working and 
survives several days in the hospital intensive care unit may receive 
opiate drugs for pain relief or anesthetic purposes.  Unless this is 
well documented in the toxicology reports, these cases could be 
falsely classified as possible drug abuse involving opiates.  
Alternatively, such a patient may not have been screened specifically 
for alcohol or illicit drugs, in which case the toxicology report would 
miss the presence of these substances.  Consequently, the data do not 
support conclusions about the degree or level of drugs of abuse for 
some decedents.

Results

Overall, about one-fifth of the toxicology reports submitted showed 
positive readings for alcohol or one or more drugs.  This is 
about 5 percent of total fatal work injuries.  (See table 1.)

Table 2 shows the substances identified in the toxicology reports.  
Alcohol was the most common substance found in deceased individuals 
with positive toxicology results.  In 1993, 47 percent of the 277 
positive toxicology cases indicated the presence of alcohol, compared 
to 44 percent of the 339 positive toxicology cases in 1994.

Table 3 shows the toxicology results by occupation.  Construction 
trade workers, truckdrivers, and farmers accounted for almost 
two-thirds of the positive cases.

The following characteristics were also analyzed: Toxicology results 
by day of the week, month, time of day, employee status, years of 
employment, gender, age, race, injury type, event, and size of 
employer.  The percent of positive test results by gender closely 
approximates occupational fatalities by gender.  (See table 4.)

Similar patterns resulted for other worker characteristics.  For 
example, the distribution of positive toxicology reports by type 
of fatal event also follows the pattern of events for all worker 
fatalities.  For both years, motor vehicle incidents, homicides, and 
falls were the leading events for all fatal work injuries.  Likewise, 
the leading events contributing to job-related fatalities with 
positive test results for each reporting year were motor vehicle 
incidents, homicides, and falls.  (See table 5.)

Data source

The Bureau's Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries collects data for 
all fatal work injuries, including self-employed persons, farm workers, 
and government employees.  For a fatality to be included in the 
census, the decedent must have been employed at the time of the 
event-that is, working for pay, compensation, or profit; performing 
a legal work activity; and present at the site of the incident as 
a requirement of his or her job.  Fatalities that occur during a 
person's commute to or from work are excluded from census counts.  
To ensure an accurate count of fatal occupational injuries, the 
program requires that the work relationship for each case be 
substantiated by two or more independent source documents.
