We assure you that the entire leadership team at the National Institute of
Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) is fully committed to publishing EHP
and to providing the support necessary to sustain EHP as a leading journal.
We are pleased to let you know that the EHP impact factor continues to rise,
increasing from 3.929 in 2004 to 5.861 in 2007. According to Journal
Citation Reports Science Edition, EHP ranks first among 144 Environmental
Sciences journals and third among 98 Public, Environmental and Occupational
Health journals. 
 
The NIEHS is actively recruiting candidates to serve as the journal?s new
Editor-in-Chief. This position will be a full-time federal appointment, as
it has been in the past.
 
Additionally, technological support for the journal has been upgraded. A
web-based manuscript management system now being implemented will greatly
enhance the scientific peer-review and publication processes.
 
EHP has always been produced with the assistance of a publishing services
contractor. The current contract will expire this year, and the National
Library of Medicine has issued a new contract solicitation on behalf of the
NIEHS. The solicitation can be found on the Federal Business Opportunities
website, www.fbo.gov <http://www.fbo.gov/> .
 
As specified in the contract solicitation, EHP will remain an ?open-access?
publication, available free of charge on-line at www.ehponline.org . EHP
will also continue to be produced as a printed journal available through
subscription. 
Since 1972, the NIEHS has published EHP to provide a worldwide forum for
research and education on environmental health sciences. The NIEHS is proud
to continue its full support for the future success of EHP.
 
Sincerely, 
 
William Martin, M.D.

Subject: NTP UPDATE: Update on NTP Activities
Message-ID: <C2CFBFEA.120B7%soward@niehs.nih.gov>


Update on NTP Activities
Over the past few months, the National Toxicology Program (NTP) has
undertaken a number of activities to address issues related to conflicts of
interest (COI) and to ensure continued public confidence in its work. These
included an independent review of its contracts for potential COI,
development of a strong clause about COI for adding to NTP contracts, and an
audit to assess the objectivity of information in draft reports prepared on
the reproductive and developmental toxicity of bisphenol A (BPA). NTP would
like to update you on these activities.
 
Review of NTP contracts
A working group of the NTP Board of Scientific Counselors conducted a review
of NTP contracts to (1) assess potential COI, (2) develop recommendations
appropriate for reducing the potential for conflicts to occur, and (3)
address mechanisms for mitigating any current or future COI. The working
group reviewed NTP contracts, information on contract performance provided
by NTP staff, and information on policies and practices concerning COI
provided by selected NTP contractors. The working group report was presented
to the NTP Board of Scientific Counselors at its meeting on June 22, 2007,
and following discussion, accepted unanimously without revision. The working
group found no evidence of actual or apparent COI in its review of NTP
contracts; however, it did recommend a number of best practices and areas
where improvements could be made. The working group report is posted on the
NTP web site
(http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov under ?Latest News?).
 
COI clause for NTP contracts
A clause that specifically addresses contractor COI was developed and is
being added to all NTP contracts. This action complements the review of NTP
contracts by the NTP Board of Scientific Counselors Working Group, as noted
above (see BSC Working Group report, Attachment 9, available
at http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov under ?Latest News?).
 
Audit of draft BPA reports
The NTP Center for the Evaluation of Risks to Human Reproduction (CERHR)
conducts rigorous independent scientific evaluations to assess risk to human
reproduction and development caused by environmental agents, such as
bisphenol A, a chemical currently under review. In response to concerns
raised about Sciences International, Inc. (SI), the former CERHR contractor
(see March 2007 and April 2007 statements available at
http://cerhr.niehs.nih.gov under ?CERHR News?), NTP committed to a review of
the contractor?s services to CERHR.  As part of this review, NTP conducted
an audit of two key activities carried out by SI: (1) selection of
literature relevant for review by the expert panel on BPA and (2)
incorporation of input from expert panel members into draft reports.
 
NTP found that SI made available to the expert panel members for their
consideration appropriate references relevant to the BPA evaluation. NTP
also found that SI reliably made changes to the draft reports requested by
the expert panel. Based upon this audit, NTP concluded that the draft expert
panel reports are useful for the BPA evaluation.  The audit report is posted
on the NTP 
(http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov under ?Latest News?) and CERHR
(http://cerhr.niehs.nih.gov under ?CERHR News?) web sites.
 
Second BPA Expert Panel Meeting
The second BPA expert panel meeting is scheduled for August 6-8, 2007, at
the Hilton Alexandria Old Town in Alexandria, Virginia.  Details about the
meeting are available on the CERHR web site for BPA (
http://cerhr.niehs.nih.gov/chemicals/bisphenol/bisphenol-mtg.html ).

Today, the National Academies of Sciences (NAS) announced release (
http://www.nationalacademies.org/morenews/20071009.html ) of the report from
NAS National Research Council entitled ?Applications of Toxicogenomic
Technologies to Predictive Toxicology and Risk Assessment.?  NIEHS
commissioned the NAS report.

> NAS Report Offers New Tools to Assess Health Risks from Chemicals
>  
> Determining how thousands of chemicals found in the environment may be
> interacting with the genes in your body to cause disease is becoming easier
> because of a new field of science called toxicogenomics.  A new report issued
> today by the National Academies of Sciences (NAS) recognizes the importance of
> toxicogenomics in predicting effects on human health and recommends the
> integration of toxicogenomics into regulatory decision making.  The NAS report
> was commissioned by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences
> (NIEHS) part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and a leader in the
> development of toxicogenomic technologies.
>  
> Toxicogenomic technologies provide tools to better understand the mechanisms
> through which environmental agents initiate and advance disease processes.
> They can also provide important information to help identify individuals that
> are more susceptible to disease risks posed by certain environmental agents
> than the general population.
>  
> ?Using toxicogenomic technologies will open the door for public health
> decision makers who need to decide in a timely and accurate manner what
> chemicals are safe and which ones are not,? says Christopher Portier, Ph.D.,
> Associate Director, NIEHS and Director, Office of Risk Assessment Research.
>       
> The report from the NAS National Research Council (NRC) entitled ?Applications
> of Toxicogenomic Technologies to Predictive Toxicology and Risk Assessment?
> states that the technological hurdles that could have limited the
> reproducibility of data from toxicogenomic technologies have been resolved and
> recommends ways for the field to move forward.
>  
>  ?NIH and others have invested in the development of these tools and have
> already tackled many of the tough technical questions.  We are now ready to
> move to the next phase of technology development, refined standardization and
> validation, so these tools can be even more useful to regulatory agencies,?
> says Portier.
>  
> ?The NIEHS and NTP have been steadily increasing the use of toxicogenomic and
> other technologies derived from the molecular biology revolution,? said Samuel
> H. Wilson, M.D., NIEHS Acting Director.  The research and initiatives
> supported through the National Center for Toxicogenomics and the
> Toxicogenomics Research Consortium, for example, were at the forefront of
> these technologies and were leaders in the development of many of the
> standards for quality and reproducibility that are used today.
>  
> The report, which was prepared by a panel of 16 scientists assembled by the
> NRC, provides a broad overview of the potential benefits arising from
> toxicogenomic technologies, describes challenges regarding use of new
> technologies, and provides 14 recommendations to achieve the potential
> benefits of these technologies.
