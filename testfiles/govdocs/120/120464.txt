> We are pleased to inform you that the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) will continue to publish the scientific journal Environmental Health Perspectives (EHP).
> 
> According to Journal Citation Reports, EHP is now the top ranking journal among 134 Environmental Sciences journals, and top among 93 Public, Environmental and Occupational Health journals. EHP> '> s impact factor increased from 3.92 to 5.34 in just one year from 2004 to 2005.
>  
> As we move forward in publishing EHP, the NIEHS will build upon those principles that have earned the journal a strong reputation and dedicated readership: open access, independent scientific peer-review, and effective oversight for conflict-of-interest.
> 
> In addition, the NIEHS will take some specific steps to further enhance the scientific quality of EHP and to reduce production costs during difficult budgetary times.  Those steps include:
> 
> *	Identifying a scientist outside NIEHS to serve as Editor-in-Chief,
> *	Dedicating more of the journal to scientific manuscripts, and reducing the news, commentary and announcement sections, 
> *	Utilizing improved technologies to facilitate the scientific peer-review process and journal production, and
> *	Continuing partnerships with international scientific journals, while discontinuing translation services.
> 
> Our support of EHP is consistent with the goals set out in the new NIEHS Strategic Plan (available at http://www.niehs.nih.gov/external/plan2006/home.htm). We are committed to communicating high-quality, high-impact science that will assist biomedical and environmental health researchers with their important work.
> 
> Thank you for your ongoing support of EHP. We hope you will continue to use the journal as a key scientific resource.

Message-ID: <C11C53BF.9738%soward@niehs.nih.gov>

        The Institute of Medicine?s Roundtable on Environmental Health
Sciences, Research, and Medicine, which is sponsored by a consortium of
private and public sector agencies including the National Institute of
Environmental Health Sciences, will be conducting a two-day workshop on
September 14-15th at the National Academies main building. The workshop,
>From Exposure to Human Disease: Research Strategies to Address Current
Challenges will explore the current challenges facing the field of exposure
science along the exposure to disease continuum. NIEHS is sending you this
information today to make you aware of this meeting and to encourage your
participation in the rich discussion over the two days. The workshop
speakers include Dr David Schwartz, Dr Sam Wilson, Dr. Leroy Hood, and Dr
David Cox.
        
        Recognizing significant progress has been made on a number of
exposures over the last 30 years, the workshop will challenge the field to
focus on a broader array of exposures, and importantly, to better understand
the linkages along the continuum from exposure to disease outcome.  Such
linkages are needed to improve risk assessment, to increase the validity of
epidemiology studies, to enable the identification of genetic and
environmental interactions and to increase the utility of exposure
information in clinical settings.  In addition to toxicity of a substance,
factors such as the type of exposure, length of exposure, genetic
polymorphisms, and age of an individual, determine whether an exposure will
lead to a disease outcome.
     
        In an effort to increase our knowledge and understanding of the
interface between environmental agents and human disease, this workshop will
discuss the current state of knowledge along the exposure?disease continuum,
the current exposure challenges for the future, and the research and policy
strategies to inform the science. The workshop will draw from the scientific
advances in genomics, proteomics, and biomarkers in order to discuss
opportunities to provide insight into the exposure?disease linkages and
build on increased knowledge in nutrition and stress research, and improved
computer modeling to examine ways to make better linkages across the
continuum. 
     
        The workshop is free and open to the public, but does require
advance registration. To see a complete agenda and to register, please visit
the workshop?s web site at http://www.iom.edu/?id=36630. If you have any
further questions regarding the workshop, please call the project staff at
(202) 334-2548.

Subject: NTP UPDATE: Message from David Schwartz,
 NIEHS Children's Environmental Health Research
Message-ID: <C142E592.3A4D%nichols3@niehs.nih.gov>

Dear Colleague,
 
Children?s health is a top priority at NIEHS and we are committed to making
the most of every research dollar. To achieve this goal, the Institute is
conducting a review of the many ways it can fund research on children?s
environmental health. The purpose of the review is to identify the best
possible ways of supporting research on the links between environmental
exposures and childhood disease.
 
In conducting this review, the NIEHS will evaluate a number of scientific
strategies to determine the most effective method for achieving three
primary goals as they relate to children?s environmental health research: 1)
to stimulate future research on the role of environment in the etiology of
disease/dysfunction among children, 2) to develop novel effective
intervention and prevention strategies, and 3) to promote translation of
basic research findings into applied intervention and prevention methods,
thereby enhancing awareness among children, their families, and health care
practitioners regarding detection, treatment, and prevention of
environmentally related diseases and health conditions.
 
An independent review panel, convened by the Institute?s Office of Risk
Assessment Research, will review the Children?s Centers Program and its
portfolio of investigator-initiated research on children?s health. This
review panel will consist of 12 senior scientists with diverse expertise in
children?s environmental health research. The panel will be convened as a
working group to the NIEHS National Advisory Environmental Health Sciences
Council.
 
The review process will include two opportunities for public input. On
January 22-24, 2007, the NIEHS will hold a public workshop to explore
strategies for addressing emerging issues in children?s environmental health
research. In February, the panel report will be delivered to NIEHS and made
available for public comment. An official notice of the report will appear
in the Federal Register.
 
Over the past 30 years, the NIEHS has invested millions of dollars in
children?s environmental health research. For the past eight years, the
Institute has partnered with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to
support thirteen research centers devoted exclusively to children?s
environmental health and disease prevention. These centers draw upon the
resources of community partners and the expertise of top universities and
medical centers to focus on the important role that environmental toxicants
play in the development of asthma, autism, and other childhood illnesses.
 
The information obtained from this independent review will enable the NIEHS
to continue its support of basic and applied research that shows the
greatest promise for rapidly identifying links between environmental
exposures and childhood illnesses. This is a vital component of the
Institute?s overall commitment to the detection, prevention and treatment of
environmentally-related diseases in America?s children.
 
 
 
Sincerely,
 
 
 
David A. Schwartz, M.D.
Director, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and National
Toxicology Program

Below is an announcement for an upcoming workshop held by the National
Research Council Committee (NRC) on Emerging Issues and Data on
Environmental Contaminants. ?We encourage you to attend this meeting to
learn about recent scientific advances in toxicogenomics and their
implications for risk assessment.

Workshop Title: ?Use of Toxicogenomics to Understand Toxic Effects and
Improve Risk Assessment

Purpose: This workshop will seek to identify how current toxicogenomic
information can be used to inform risk assessment today and to identify
toxicogenomic research directions to facilitate risk assessment in the
future. ?Two chemicals of regulatory and scientific interest, dibutyl
phthalate and benzene, will be used as case studies to highlight the current
use, controversies, and potential for using toxicogenomic information in
risk assessment. ???

Format: ?Presentations highlighting recent toxicogenomic research and
chemical risk assessments will be followed by focused discussions among NRC
committee members, invited speakers, and audience participants. ?During
focused discussions, workshop moderators will seek to address questions with
input derived from workshop presentations and from participant discussions.
?The result of these discussions will be presented at the end of the
workshop.

Types of questions to be addressed: What are the salient controversies in
the health effects or risk assessment of these chemicals? ?What do we
currently know about mechanisms of toxic effects? ?What type of information
is appearing about this chemical in the toxicogenomics literature? ?What
does this information tell us to date? ?Can chemical specific risk
assessments be improved by these data? ?What are the most important
directions for further research in order to develop information that will be
useful to regulators? ?What omics technologies might be useful in further
developing this information? ?Why is this information important in terms of
medical treatment or public health and how can this information be used in
the future to protect public health?

?
Date: ??????????????November 13th, 2006

Agenda: ??????????8:30 AM to 5:00 PM; a full agenda will be provided shortly

Subject: NTP UPDATE: Upcoming NIEHS workshop
Message-ID: <C17F8486.B7C3%soward@niehs.nih.gov>

Below is an announcement for an upcoming workshop sponsored by the National
Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) on research approaches
for addressing children?s environmental health.

Title: Children?s Environmental Health Research: Past, Present and Future

Purpose: The goal of this workshop is to develop new strategies for
research, exposure and effects monitoring, intervention and prevention in
children's environmental health. Specific objectives are to maximize the
effectiveness of scientific research - basic science, exposure
monitoring/biomonitoring, epidemiology, toxicology, clinical medicine and
multidisciplinary studies - and to enhance the translation of research to
the bedside, to the community and to public policy.

Format: The first day will begin with discussions of two case studies that
demonstrate the successful implementation of evidence-based
intervention/prevention strategies that became possible once links between
environmental exposures and a disease in children had been identified. The
first case study will focus on lead and neurotoxicity. Findings on the
adverse effects of lead on neurodevelopment ultimately led to efforts to
reduce exposures to lead. Asthma will be used as a second case study because
it provides a clear example of environmental triggers and some science-based
prevention/intervention strategies that are already being implemented. The
second day of the workshop will focus on applying lessons learned from the
two "success" case studies to two children's disorders that appear to have
environmental etiologies but are less well understood: disorders of lipid
and carbohydrate metabolism and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder
(ADHD). 

A discussion will follow each case study presentation to consider the
opportunities, the barriers and the design challenges that confront future
clinical, toxicological, epidemiological, exposure monitoring, and basic
research in children's environmental health. Specific topics include:
* Past approaches to research translation to see what worked and what failed
to work. 
* The critical mass of researchers and mix of disciplines needed to most
efficiently advance research in children's environmental health.
* Biomarkers of exposure, susceptibility, or subclinical dysfunction.
* The use of "omics" technologies that might be incorporated into future
toxicological, epidemiological and/or biomonitoring studies to enhance their
sensitivity and efficiency.
* Is there a point at which the use of new scientific tools might slow the
pace of progress? 
* New approaches to accelerating the translation of science to treatment,
prevention, and the remediation of environmental risks to children's health.
* Potential study populations at uniquely high risk of disease.
* Data resources - records, disease registries, well-characterized cohort
populations, tissue banks, or stored DNA - in the U.S. or abroad that might
facilitate future studies.
* New partnerships in research.
This meeting is open to the public with time set aside for public
discussion.
