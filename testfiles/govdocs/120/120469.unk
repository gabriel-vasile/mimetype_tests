Biochemicals Test Guidelines


OPPTS 880.3800
Immune Response


                              Introduction

        This guideline is one of a series of test guidelines that have 
been developed by the Office of Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic 
Substances, United States Environmental Protection Agency for use in the 
testing of pesticides and toxic substances, and the development of test 
data that must be submitted to the Agency for review under Federal 
regulations.

        The Office of Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic Substances 
(OPPTS) has developed this guideline through a process of harmonization 
that blended the testing guidance and requirements that existed in the 
Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics (OPPT) and appeared in Title 
40, Chapter I, Subchapter R of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), 
the Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP) which appeared in publications of 
the National Technical Information Service (NTIS) and the guidelines 
published by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development 
(OECD).

        The purpose of harmonizing these guidelines into a single set of 
OPPTS guidelines is to minimize variations among the testing procedures 
that must be performed to meet the data requirements of the U. S. 
Environmental Protection Agency under the Toxic Substances Control Act 
(15 U.S.C. 2601) and the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide 
Act (7 U.S.C. 136, et seq.).


     Final Guideline Release:  This guideline is available from the U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402 on The Federal Bulletin Board.

OPPTS 880.3800  Immune response.

        (a) Scope--(1) Applicability. This guideline is intended to meet 
testing requirements of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and 
Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) (7 U.S.C. 136, et seq.).

        (2) Background. The source material used in developing this 
harmonized OPPTS test guideline is OPP guideline 152-24.

        (b) Immunotoxicity studies with biochemical pest control agents 
(BPCAs): tier II--When required. Data on alterations of immune responses 
(tier II) are required by 40 CFR 158.165 to support the registration of 
each manufacturing-use and each end-use product when significant 
immunotoxic effects are observed in test animals treated in any of the 
tier I immunotoxicity studies (OPPTS 880.3550), or when the 
immunotoxicity data from the tier I studies cannot be definitively 
interpreted, or when there is available data from other sources which 
indicate that the test substance, or structurally-related substances 
(including metabolites and degradation products) are immunotoxic.

        (c) Test standards--(1) Principles of the test methods. The 
tests and methods are designed to:

        (i) Provide information on the time-course of recovery from each 
significant adverse immunotoxic effect observed in tier I studies.

        (ii) Indicate whether the observed effects may result in 
impaired host resistance to infectious microbial agents and/or to tumor 
cell challenge.

        (iii) To provide additional information essential for a full 
evaluation of potential risks associated with the immunotoxicityof a 
test substance.

        (2) Test selection. (i) Selection of the appropriate tests to be 
done in tier II studies will depend on:

        (A) The particular test or tests in tier I in which significant 
immunotoxic effects were observed.

        (B) The availability of data from other sources which indicate 
that the test substance, or structurally-related substances, are 
immunotoxic.

        (C) Whether data from initial testing in tier II indicate that 
expanded testing is required, using additional tests in this tier.

        (ii) Consultation with appropriate representatives of the Agency 
is suggested to determine which tests are to be performed.

        (d) Immunotoxicity studies--(1) Recovery from adverse 
immunotoxic effects. For each study in tier I (OPPTS 880.3550) where 
significant immunotoxic effects were observed (including 
histopathological effects), the satellite group of treated test animals 
(OPPTS 880.3550(c)(3)) is to be used to evaluate the time-course for 
recovery from the effects after withdrawal of the test substance. The 
tests should be conducted in accordance with the protocols set forth for 
each test in OPPTS 880.3550, with the following modifications:

        (i) At least five treated animals in the satellite group and 
five untreated control animals are to be evaluated at 7, 14, and 28 days 
after the withdrawal of the test substance.

        (ii) Only those tests in OPPTS 880.3550 in which significant 
immunotoxic effects were observed need be repeated with the satellite 
group of test animals.

        (iii) If a satellite group of test animals, or control animals 
for the satellite group, were not included as suggested in the tier I 
studies, or if these animals were insufficient in number for proper 
evaluation of recovery from any adverse immunotoxic effects observed in 
the tier I studies, then the necessary tests should be initiated as 
described in OPPTS 880.3550, and completed as described above with the 
appropriate numbers of test and control animals.

        (iv) Studies in tier I may be required, in which both sexes of 
several strains of test animals are exposed to the BPCA at several dose 
levels for longer time periods (e.g., 90 days).

        (2) Altered host resistance after challenge with infectious 
agents or with tumor cells. (i) The selection of an appropriate host 
resistance model (or models) will depend largely on the particular 
immunotoxic effects observed from testing at the tier I level (OPPTS 
880.3550) and, on whether the model system has been established as 
providing reproducible data for detecting altered host resistance after 
exposure to environmental chemicals.

        (ii) Host resistance models that may be appropriate for use when 
alterations of cell-mediated immune responses are observed in tier I 
tests include challenge with Listeria monocytogenes or challenge with 
transplantable syngeneic (or semi-syngeneic) tumor cells, including PYB6 
fibrosarcoma or B16F10 melanoma tumor of C57BL/6 mice; or challenge with 
Herpes simplex virus type 1 or type 2 (HSV-1, HSV-2).

        (iii) Host resistance models that may be appropriate for use 
when alterations of humoral-mediated immune responses are observed in 
tier I tests include challenge with Streptococcus sp. (e.g., 
Streptococcus pyogenes) or challenge with HSV-1 or HSV-2.

        (iv) Other models, not mentioned above, involving challenge with 
other infectious agents or tumor cells, also may prove useful in 
evaluating host resistance to BPCAs.

        (v) It may be considered appropriate to include host resistance 
models as substitutes for certain immunotoxicity tests recommended in 
tier I (OPPTS 880.3550). However, documentation must be provided to show 
that the immune system parameters measured by the selected host 
resistance models are equivalent to those evaluated in the tests 
suggested in tier I.

        (vi) General test standards. (A) The resistance of host animals 
to challenge by infectious agents or tumor cells usually will involve 
exposing young adult rodents for 30 days to the highest dose of BPCA 
that did not lead to overt toxicity in the test animals.

        (B) Reporting on parameters, appropriate for each host 
resistance model system, other than the endpoint of mortality, should be 
considered so that proper interpretation can be made of any observed 
changes in host resistance.

        (C) Appropriate positive control groups of test animals, dosed 
with a known immunosuppressive chemical, should be included with each 
host resistance system used.
        (D) In addition to providing all relevant data appropriate for 
each host resistance system used, protocols should be sufficiently well-
described, and justification/ reasoning should be provided for any 
modifications in protocols of standard techniques.
  
        (E) Current knowledge on the immune system components involved 
in host resistance to the infectious agent or tumor cell should be 
included in the report.
  
        (F) In-depth host resistance studies may be required, in which 
several strains and both sexes of host animal (weanling to aged) are 
exposed to the BPCA at several dose levels for longer time periods 
(e.g., 90 days).
  
        (3) Other immunotoxicological studies. (i) Additional tests may 
be required if considered necessary for a full evaluation of potential 
risks associated with the immunotoxicity of a BPCA. These include, but 
are not necessarily limited to, available tests that are designed to 
evaluate effects of a substance on:
  
        (A) Lymphoid organs and tissues (using enzyme and immune 
histochemistry).
  
        (B) Serum complement.
  
        (C) Antibody response to T-independent antigens.
  
        (D) Enumeration of subpopulations of T- and B- lymphocytes.
  
        (E) Granulocyte function.
  
        (F) Bone marrow function.
  
        (G) Lymphokines.
  
        (H) Plaque-forming cell response to T-independent antigens.
  
        (I) Mitog stimulation of lymphocyte blastogenesis.
  
        (J) In vivo popliteal lymph node enlargement after injection of 
allogeneic lymphocytes.
  
        (K) Hormones.
  
        (L) Immune system development.
  
        (M) Macrophage development, activation and function.
  
        (N) Induction of autoimmunity.
  
        (ii) Certain additional tests may be required if evidence is 
obtained which indicates that the test substance is immunogenic.
  
        (iii) When required. Tests to measure these and other parameters 
of the immune system may be required when indicated by:
  
        (A) The extent and/or nature of the immunotoxic effects observed 
in the tier I (OPPTS 880.3550) tests.
  
        (B) The nature of immunotoxic effects observed in the host 
resistance challenge models.
  
        (C) The inability to definitively interpret the data from tier I 
studies or from the host resistance challenge models;
  
        (D) The necessity to conform, by using alternate tests, the 
results from tier I studies.
  
        (E) The availability of data from other sources which indicate 
that the test substance, or closely related substances (including 
metabolites and degradation products) are immunotoxic.
