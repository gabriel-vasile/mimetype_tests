PREDICTION METHOD ABSTRACT</h2>

The results submitted to the prediction evaluation were obtained by two
different methods: (1) Fold recognition and (2) Assembly of backbones
from small overlapping fragments.<p>
	
The fold recognition technique consists of the following parts (1) a
knowledge based energy function (mean force potentials), (2) a
technique to align sequences with structures (allowing gaps) and (3)
quality assessment of the models obtained in the alignment
(z-score).<p>
	
The energy function consists only of C-beta-C-beta interactions and an
approximation for solvent interactions.  The energy function and
z-score calculation is identical to the functions used in the PROtein
Structure Analysis program PROSA-II available from
gundi.came.sbg.ac.at, which can be used to detect incorrect folds or
faulty parts in a structure (Sippl,M.,J., Proteins, 17, 355, 1993).<p>
 
The alignment technique used is still largely experimental and
unpublished (some information on the strategies used has been described
by Sippl,M.J., J.Comput.Aided Mol.Design, 7, 473, 1993 and Sippl,M.J.
et al. in The Protein Folding Problem and Tertiary Structure
Prediction, K.Merz and S.LeGrand (eds.), Birkhauser, Boston, 1994, pp
353-407).<p>

Each target sequence was combined with a subset of structures obtained
from the brookhaven data base.  The structure yielding the highest
score was defined as the best model and the corresponding alignment was
submitted as a prediction (in terms of backbone coordinates and the
secondary structure assignments, helix or strand, obtained from the
respective X-ray structure).<p>
	
From our previous studies we found that in roughly one out of four
cases the current implementation is able to recognise a related fold in
the data base in the absence of significant sequence homology.  This,
of course, is only possible if a related fold exists in the data base.
If no related fold exists the method often yields substructures similar
to the target structure, but necessarily incorrect overall folds (in
fact the extent of similarity is difficult to assess).<p>
	
The second method employed is based on the combination of small
fragments (Sippl et al. Protein Science, 1, 625-640, 1992).  The method
yields full backbone coordinates, but uses only local energy terms.  It
can be used to predict the local structures but not the tertiary fold.
In this prediction experiment we used the results in the following
way:  The backbones were assembled and the secondary structure
assignments were calculated from the model.  These results were then
compared to the secondary structure assignments derived from the best
model obtained from the sequence structure alignment technique.  The
consistency between the two results was used as an indication for the
quality (in terms of local backbone geometry) of the predictions.<p>

We submitted the best scoring models for 15 target sequences, although
it was clear that the method has a chance to correctly predict a
structure only if a closely related fold is contained in our data base
of known structures.<br>
