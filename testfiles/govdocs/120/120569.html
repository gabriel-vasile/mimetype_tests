	<EM>Throughout the American War for Independence, Congress was powerless to tax; to
	
    raise revenue, supplies, and troops, Congress made requests to the states. Sometimes the
	
    states complied, but many times they did not. According to the following letter from
	
    Washington to Governor Joseph Reed of Pennsylvania, what does Washington think will happen
	
    if that state does not meet or exceed its requisition? Why does Washington feel that the
	
    French and Spanish allies will not be able to offer further financial assistance to the
	
    United States? Why does Washington observe that &quot;much will depend on the State of
	
    Pennsylvania&quot;?</EM>

	<P>Dear Sir: I am much obliged to you for your favour of the 23. Nothing could be more
	
    necessary than the aid given by your state towards supplying us with provision. I assure
	
    you, every Idea you can form of our distresses, will fall short of the reality. There is
	
    such a combination of circumstances to exhaust the patience of the soldiery that it begins
	
    at length to be worn out and we see in every line of the army, the most serious features
	
    of mutiny and sedition. All our departments, all our operations are at a stand, and unless
	
    a system very different from that which has for a long time prevailed, be immediately
	
    adopted throughout the states our affairs must soon become desperate beyond the
	
    possibility of recovery. If you were on the spot my Dear Sir, if you could see what
	
    difficulties surround us on every side, how unable we are to administer to the most
	
    ordinary calls of the service, you would be convinced that these expressions are not too
	
    strong, and that we have every thing to dread. Indeed I have almost ceased to hope. The
	
    country in general is in such a state of insensibility and indifference to its interests,
	
    that I dare not flatter myself with any change for the better.</P>
	
	
	<P>The Committee of Congress in their late address to the several states have given a just
	
    picture of our situation. I very much doubt its making the desired impression, and if it
	
    does not I shall consider our lethargy as incurable. The present juncture is so
	
    interesting that if it does not produce correspondent exertions, it will be a proof that
	
    motives of honor public good and even self preservation have lost their influence upon our
	
    minds. This is a decisive moment; one of the most [I will go further and saythe most]
	
    important America has seen. The Court of France has made a glorious effort for our
	
    deliverance, and if we disappoint its intentions by our supineness we must become
	
    contemptible in the eyes of all mankind; nor can we after that venture to confide that our
	
    allies will persist in an attempt to establish what it will appear we want inclination or
	
    ability to assist them in.</P>
	
	
	<P>Every view of our own circumstances ought to determine us to the most vigorous efforts;
	
    but there are considerations of another kind that should have equal weight. The combined
	
    fleets of France and Spain last year were greatly superior of those of the enemy: The
	
    enemy nevertheless sustained no material damage, and at the close of the campaign have
	
    given a very important blow to our allies. This campaign the difference between the fleets
	
    from every account I have been able to collect will be inconsiderable, indeed it is far
	
    from clear that there will not be an equality. What are we to expect will be the case if
	
    there should be another campaign? In all probability the advantage will be on the side of
	
    the English and then what would become of America? We ought not to deceive ourselves. The
	
    maritime resources of Great Britain are more substantial and real than those of France and
	
    Spain united. Her commerce is more extensive than that of both her rivals; and it is an
	
    axiom that the nation which has the most extensive commerce will always have the most
	
    powerful marine. Were this argument less convincing the fact speaks for itself; her
	
    progress in the course of the last year is an incontestible proof.</P>
	
	
	<P>It is true France in a manner created a Fleet in a very short space and this may
	
    mislead us in the judgment we form of her naval abilities. But if they bore any comparison
	
    with those of great Britain how comes it to pass, that with all the force of Spain added
	
    she has lost so much ground in so short a time, as now to have scarcely a superiority. We
	
    should consider what was done by France as a violent and unnatural effort of the
	
    government, which for want of sufficient foundation, cannot continue to operate
	
    proportionable effects.</P>
	
	
	<P>In modern wars the longest purse must chiefly determine the event. I fear that of the
	
    enemy will be found to be so. Though the government is deeply in debt and of course poor,
	
    the nation is rich and their riches afford a fund which will not be easily exhausted.
	
    Besides, their system of public credit is such that it is capable of greater exertions
	
    than that of any other nation. Speculatists have been a long time foretelling its
	
    downfall, but we see no symptoms of the catastrophe being very near. I am persuaded it
	
    will at least last out the war, and then, in the opinion of many of the best politicians
	
    it will be a national advantage. If the war should terminate successfully the crown will
	
    have acquired such influence and power that it may attempt any thing, and a bankruptcy
	
    will probably be made the ladder to climb to absolute authority. Administration may
	
    perhaps wish to drive matters to this issue; at any rate they will not be restrained by an
	
    apprehension of it from forcing the resources of the state. It will promote their present
	
    purposes on which their all is at stake and it may pave the way to triumph more
	
    effectually over the constitution. With this disposition I have no doubt that ample means
	
    will be found to prosecute the war with the greatest vigor.</P>
	
	
	<P>France is in a very different position. The abilities of her present Financier have
	
    done wonders. By a wise administration of the revenues aided by advantageous loans he has
	
    avoided the necessity of additional taxes. But I am well informed, if the war continues
	
    another campaign he will be obliged to have recourse to the taxes usual in time of war
	
    which are very heavy, and which the people of France are not in a condition to endure for
	
    any duration. When this necessity commences France makes war on ruinous terms; and England
	
    from her individual wealth will find much greater facility in supplying her exigencies.</P>
	
	
	<P>Spain derives great wealth from her mines, but not so great as is generally imagined.
	
    Of late years the profits to government is essentially diminished. Commerce and industry
	
    are the best mines of a nation; both which are wanting to her. I am told her treasury is
	
    far from being so well filled as we have flattered ourselves. She is also much divided on
	
    the propriety of the war. There is a strong party against it. The temper of the nation is
	
    too sluggish to admit of great exertions, and tho' the Courts of the two kingdoms are
	
    closely linked together, there never has been in any of their wars a perfect harmony of
	
    measures, nor has it been the case in this; which has already been no small detriment to
	
    the common cause.</P>
	
	
	<P>I mention these things to show that the circumstances of our allies as well as our own
	
    call for peace; to obtain which we must make one great effort this campaign. The present
	
    instance of the friendship of the Court of France is attended with every circumstance that
	
    can render it important and agreeable; that can interest our gratitude or fire our
	
    emulation. If we do our duty we may even hope to make the campaign decisive on this
	
    Continent. But we must do our duty in earnest, or disgrace and ruin will attend us. I am
	
    sincere in declaring a full persuasion, that the succor will be fatal to us if our
	
    measures are not adequate to the emergency.</P>
	
	
	<P>Now my Dear Sir, I must observe to you, that much will depend on the State of
	
    Pennsylvania. She has it in her power to contribute without comparison more to our success
	
    than any other state; in the two essential articles of flour and transportation. New York,
	
    Jersey, Pennsylvania and Maryland are our flour countries: Virginia went little on this
	
    article the last crop [and her resources are call'd for to the southward]. New York by
	
    legislative coercion has already given all she could spare for the use of the army. Her
	
    inhabitants are left with scarcely a sufficiency for their own subsistence. Jersey from
	
    being so long the place of the army's residence is equally exhausted. Maryland has made
	
    great exertions; but she can still do something more. Delaware may contribute handsomely
	
    in proportion to her extent. But Pennsylvania is our chief dependence. From every
	
    information I can obtain she is at this time full of flour. I speak to you in the language
	
    of frankness and as a friend. I do not mean to make any insinuations unfavorable to the
	
    state. I am aware of the embarrassments the government labours under, from the open
	
    opposition of one party and the underhand intrigues of another. I know that with the best
	
    dispositions to promote the public service, you have been obliged to move with
	
    circumspection. But this is a time to hazard and to take a tone of energy and decision.
	
    All parties but the disaffected will acquiesce in the necessity and give their support.
	
    The hopes and fears of the people at large may be acted upon in such a manner as to make
	
    them approve and second your views.</P>
	
	
	<P>The matter is reduced to a point. Either Pennsylvania must give us all the aid we ask
	
    of her, or we can undertake nothing. We must renounce every idea of cooperation, and must
	
    confess to our allies that we look wholly to them for our safety. This will be a state of
	
    humiliation and bitterness against which the feelings of every good American ought to
	
    revolt. Your's I am convinced will; nor have I the least doubt that you will employ all
	
    your influence to animate the Legislature and the people at large. The fate of these
	
    states hangs upon it. God grant we may be properly impressed with the consequences.</P>
	
	
	<P>I wish the Legislature could be engaged to vest the executive with plenipotentiary
	
    powers. I should then expect every thing practicable from your abilities and zeal. This is
	
    not a time for formality or ceremony. The crisis in every point of view is extraordinary
	
    and extraordinary expedients are necessary. [I am decided in this opinion.]
