<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Armed Services Committee be discharged from further consideration of S. Res. 373, and the Senate then proceed to its immediate consideration. 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk will report the resolution by title. 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislative clerk read as follows: 
<p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A resolution (S. Res. 373) recognizing the 225th birthday of the United States Navy. 
<p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the resolution.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, today it is my pleasure to pay tribute to the United States Navy as it celebrates the 225th anniversary of its founding. The Navy can be proud of a distinguished heritage, a heritage longer than that of the United States itself. Because of the dedicated service of our nation's sailors, Americans can feel secure that our shores are free from foreign aggression, and the world's oceans and seaways are open for peaceful commerce. The recent terrorist attack on the U.S.S. 
<em>Cole,</em> resulting in the death or presumed death of 17 sailors, reminds us of the personal risk that the members of our Navy bravely face every day, in peacetime as well as wartime. 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October 13, 1775, the Second Continental Congress authorized the acquisition of ships and establishment of a navy. Within a few days, a Naval Committee was established to coordinate the purchase of ships and the recruitment of personnel, and to draft rules regulating the Navy's administration. Although the Continental Navy of the Revolutionary War was rather humble compared to today's Navy--it was made up of only 40 vessels at its peak--it played an important role in the miraculous success 
of the American Revolution. The Navy was able to seize almost 200 British ships as prizes, including many off the British coast, and this forced the British to divert valuable warships to the protection of transport convoys. It was in one of these raids that the legendary John Paul Jones uttered his immortal words: ``I have not yet begun to fight!'' And this spirit of unflagging courage and selfless discharge of duty has animated the hearts of every sailor since.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Founding Fathers saw the role of the Navy as important enough to merit specific mention in Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution, which empowers Congress to ``provide and maintain a Navy.'' As American history has unfolded since then, the U.S. Navy has distinguished itself in every major armed conflict in the history of our country, from the War of 1812 and the Civil War all the way to the Gulf War and the conflict in Kosovo. 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we enter the 21st century, the U.S. Navy is without question the preeminent sea power in the world. On October 2, 2000, the active fleet contained 318 ships and 4,108 aircraft, and over 373,000 active-duty personnel filled the Navy's ranks. The U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis provides its midshipmen with an academically rigorous curriculum, and no less important, leadership and character development. This rigorous preparation continues at a more advanced level at the Naval War College, which 
teaches the latest naval doctrine and strategy to senior and mid-level officers. Thanks to these prestigious institutions, the U.S. Navy boasts the finest and best qualified naval officers in the world, and the ability to face with confidence any challenge to American security. 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Navy, its mission is to ``maintain, train and equip combat-ready naval forces capable of winning wars, deterring aggression and maintaining freedom of the seas.'' No matter where a sailor serves, whether on an aircraft carrier, submarine, battleship, cruiser, or naval base, his or her contribution is vital to fulfilling this mission. The Navy's worldwide reach allows our country to maintain U.S. national security through dominance of the seas, a dominance made possible by a combination 
of highly trained service members and highly sophisticated technology. 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd like to take this opportunity to thank in particular those Minnesotans who have served, or are currently serving, in the Navy. I am proud of them, and they should know that their sacrifices on behalf of the cause of freedom are not taken for granted by their friends and neighbors in Minnesota. 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm sure my colleagues will join me in recognizing the rich heritage and  <center><pre>[Page: S10737] <b><a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getpage.cgi?dbname=2000_record&page=S10737&position=all"> <cite>GPO's PDF</cite></a></b></pre></center>
dedicated service of the United States Navy on its anniversary. 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any statements relating to the resolution be printed in the <b>RECORD</b>. 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The resolution (S. Res. 373) was agreed to. 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preamble was agreed to. 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; S. Res. 373
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereas on Friday, October 13, 1775, the Continental Congress, representing the citizens of 13 American colonies, passed a resolution which stated ``That a swift sailing vessel, to carry ten carriage guns, and a proportionable number of swivels, with eighty men, be fitted, with all possible dispatch, for a cruise of three months, and that the commander be instructed to cruise eastward, for intercepting such transports as may be laden with warlike stores and other supplies for our enemies, and 
for such other purposes as the Congress shall direct.'';<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereas the founders recognized the essential nature of a Navy to the strength and longevity of the Nation by providing authority to Congress ``To provide and maintain a Navy'' in article I of the Constitution;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereas a Naval Committee was established to build a fitting Navy for our fledgling country, acquire and fit out vessels for sea, and draw up regulations;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereas the Continental Navy began a proud tradition, carried out for 225 years by our United States Navy, to protect our island Nation and pursue the causes of freedom we hold so dear;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereas, for the past 225 years, the central mission of the Navy has been to protect the interests of our Nation around the world on the high seas, to fight and win the wars of our Nation, and to maintain control of the sea lines of communication enabling this Nation and other free nations to grow and prosper;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereas, whether in peace or at war, United States citizens around the world can rest assured that the United States Navy is on watch, ever vigilant, and ready to respond;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereas, for the past 225 years, Navy men and women, as both ambassadors and warriors, have won extraordinary distinction and respect for the Nation and its Navy on the high seas, among the ocean depths, on distant shores, and in the skies above;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereas the core values of ``Honor, Courage, and Commitment'' are the guides by which United States sailors live and serve;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereas the United States Navy today is the most capable, most respected, and most effective sea service in the world;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereas 75 percent of the land masses in the world are bounded by water and 75 percent of the population of the world lives within 100 miles of the sea, assuring that our Naval forces will continue to be called upon to respond to emerging crises, to maintain freedom of the sea, to deter would-be aggressors, and to provide our allies with a visible reassurance of the support of the United States of America; and<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereas, no matter what the cause, location, or magnitude of future conflicts, the Nation can rely on its Navy to produce well-trained, well-led, and highly motivated sailors to carry out the missions entrusted to them: Now, therefore, be it<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em> Resolved,</em> That the Senate--<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) recognizes the historic significance of the 225th birthday of the United States Navy;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) expresses the appreciation of the people of the United States to the Navy, and the men and women who have served in the Navy, for 225 years of dedicated service;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) honors the courage, commitment, and sacrifice that Americans have made throughout the history of the Navy; and<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4) gives special thanks to the extended Navy family of civilians, family members, and loved ones who have served and supported the Navy for the past 225 years.<ul>
