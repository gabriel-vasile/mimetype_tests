   of pullet and layer nutrition, physical environment, husbandry practices, induced 
   molt programs and shell egg processing factors. 1) Determine the relationship 
   between body size and age at sexual maturity on subsequent layer performance 
   and egg mass produced. 2) Determine the effects and interactions of strain, 
   house type, density, husbandry practices, and layer nutrition on production 
   and economics. 3) Determine the effects and interactions of induced molt programs 
   on production, behavior, and economics. 4) Determine the effects of current 
   egg processing technology on the physical quality and microbiological safety

   of white and brown egg-type chickens and the eggs that they produce will be 
   utilized. Pullets will be reared in environmental control housing with various 
   combinations of nutritional or management programs which affect the productivity 
   of the layers at the Poultry Research Unit of the Piedmont Research Station 
   at Salisbury, NC. The factors could include: light programs, dietary regimen, 
   body weight program, molt techniques, husbandry practices, environment control 
   programs, and egg handling programs. Pullets and layers will be managed as close 
   to commercial industry standards as possible except when deviations are needed 
   to accomplish the research objectives. Pullet body weights, feed consumption 
   and mortality as well as hen feed consumption, egg production, egg quality and 
   livability data will be collected on each flock. Productivity will be defined 
   by various measurements of body weight, skeletal structure, feed consumption, 
   immune competence, physiological health, and egg production criteria. The welfare 
   status will be defined by the behavioral profile and hormonal response of the 
   birds. Egg quality will be defined by the USDA egg quality standards, physical 
   shell and membrane measurements, and through microbiological testing of the 
   shell and contents. The potential of poultry manure as an organic fuel source 
   will be evaluated from commercial sources and based upon governmental standards 
   for emissions. The general experimental design will be a factorial arrangement 
   which will allow for examination of multiple factors simultaneously.</span></span></p>

 style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="color:
 #000000">1. What major problem or issue is being resolved and how are you resolving 
   it? The objective of this project is to develop improved methods for preventing, 
   detecting, and controlling infections of chickens with Salmonella enteritidis 
   (SE) and the associated production of SE contaminated eggs. Among the specific 
   goals of the research are determining the processes and mechanisms by which 
   SE infects chickens, spreads vertically and horizontally, and is deposited in 
   eggs; characterizing the nature of SE contamination of eggs; developing more 
   sensitive and specific diagnostic tests for identifying SE infections of chickens 
   and for detecting SE contamination of eggs; and developing electrostatic space 
   charging technology to diminish airborne dust and pathogens - including SE throughout 
   - poultry hatching and housing facilities. 2. How serious is the problem? Why 
   does it matter? The association between human illness caused by SE and the consumption 
   of contaminated poultry products is an important international public health 
   and economic problem. In recent years, SE has been among the Salmonella serotypes 
   most often reported to cause human illness. Eggs have been the most frequently 
   implicated sources of human SE infections in the United States. As food-borne 
   transmission of SE threatens both the safety of consumers and the ability of 
   poultry producers to market their products, the formulation and implementation 
   of effective control strategies for reducing the incidence of SE infections 
   in chickens has been identified as an urgent priority by both government and 
   industry. 3. How does it relate to the National Program(s) and National Component(s)? 
   National Program 108, Food Safety (100%) This research contributes to the Microbial 
   Pathogens component of the Food Safety National Program by providing scientists 
   (veterinary, food, and agricultural), regulatory agency officials, and the poultry 
   industry with urgently needed tools to understand, prevent, detect, and control 
   SE infections of chickens. 4. What were the most significant accomplishments 
   this past year? A. Single most significant accomplishment during FY 2001. Replicated 
   trials conducted in a small treatment chamber showed that an electrostatic space 
   charge system (ESCS) reduced biofilms developed on stainless steel from poultry 
   carcass rinses by 97.3% in 2 hours and 99.8% in 3 hours. These results are comparable 
   to those obtained by existing disinfection chemicals and indicate that the ESCS 
   could potentially be used as a non-chemical treatment to reduce pathogens in 
   biofilms which develop in poultry egg or meat processing areas. B. Other significant 
   accomplishments. Because bacteria grow much more rapidly in egg yolk than in 
   albumen, the location at which SE cells are deposited is critical for determining 
   how quickly refrigeration must lower internal egg temperatures. After experimentally 
   infecting groups of laying hens with SE strains of different phage types, we 
   found SE more often in yolk than in albumen. Most contaminated eggs contained 
   fewer than 1 SE cell per ml. These results suggest that refrigeration standards 
   must address the possibility that SE may sometimes be deposited in yolk. When 
   contaminants were experimentally introduced into egg contents, we observed rapid 
   multiplication in yolk and extended persistence in albumen for a diverse assortment 
   of SE strains of several phage types. This suggests that egg refrigeration standards 
   may not need to address much potential variability in growth and survival characteristics 
   between SE strains, but preventing disease transmission by eggs requires rapid 
   refrigeration in combination with other control measures. When we compared the 
   levels of serum antibodies induced in experimentally infected hens to the frequency 
   at which they laid eggs contaminated by SE, we found that the relationship between 
   these two parameters was not very consistent. Accordingly, although antibody 
   tests are useful tools for preliminary screening of laying flocks to detect 
   SE infection, the magnitude of the antibody response by individuals hens does 
   not predict the overall risk of egg contamination associated with the flock. 
   5. Describe the major accomplishments over the life of the project including 
   their predicted or actual impact. This project provided the first definitive 
   experimental documentation that hens systemically infected with SE could produce 
   internally contaminated eggs. Scientists found that SE infections can be highly 
   persistent in both chicks and hens and elicit long-lasting antibody titers. 
   The project developed and assessed the sensitivity and predictive value of methods 
   for detecting specific antibodies in serum and egg yolks from infected hens. 
   The project developed effective and practical bacteriological methods for consistently 
   detecting very small numbers of SE contaminants in eggs. Efficient killed vaccines 
   were developed and evaluated for reducing the susceptibility of laying hens 
   to SE infection. Studies assessed the relationship between phage type of SE 
   isolates and their virulence, infectivity, and invasiveness in chicks. One scientist 
   determined that air movement can mediate the horizontal transmission of SE infection. 
   An ESCS was developed under a CRADA to reduce airborne dust and microorganisms 
   in hatching cabinets. The ESCS has been shown to have effectiveness comparable 
   to a 95% media filter for removing dust in laboratory experiments in hatching 
   cabinets and transmission cabinets and equal or better effectiveness for removing 
   airborne bacteria and Salmonella. The ESCS reduced airborne SE in an isolation 
   room with caged layers approximately 95%. The kill rate of the ESCS on airborne 
   and surface SE at close range has been shown to be 98% or more. The ESCS has 
   been patented and an exclusive license for poultry applications has been approved 
   with BioIon, Inc. to manufacture and distribute the system. 6. What do you expect 
   to accomplish, year by year, over the next 3 years? During FY2002, we will establish 
   how the growth patterns of SE inside eggs affects the development and application 
   of faster methods for detecting contamination. During this year we also will 
   study the effectiveness of the ESCS for pathogen reduction in egg rooms and 
   upsize pathogen reduction hatchery studies to include followup of chicks from 
   ionizer treated hatching cabinets to full-sized production houses. We will also 
   determine the effectiveness of the ESCS for reducing pathogens and airborne 
   disease transmission in a small scale breeder house and investigate the mechanism 
   by which ionization inactivates SE. Effectiveness of the ESCS for reduction 
   of biofilms in large open areas will be determined. For FY2003, we will evaluate 
   how the patterns of deposition and multiplication of SE isolates in egg contents 
   affects the probable effectiveness of proposed standards for egg refrigeration. 
   We will also design an ESCS for full sized breeder houses and test effectiveness 
   for pathogen and dust reduction. In FY2004, we will seek to develop and apply 
   improved models and methods for producing experimental SE contamination of eggs, 
   detecting SE contaminants in eggs, and detecting specific antibodies in infected 
   chickens. We will also study the effectiveness of self-cleaning ESCS devices 
   in poultry production areas and test the effectiveness of electrostatically-enhanced 
   high volume air samplers for airborne pathogens. 7. What science and/or technologies 
   have been transferred and to whom? When is the science and/or technology likely 
   to become available to the end user (industry, farmer, other scientists)? What 
   are the constraints if known, to the adoption &amp; durability of the technology 
   product? Completed commercial hatcher tests of ESCS with two commercial poultry 
   production companies. CRADA partner initiated patent applications for the ESCS 
   for several foreign countries. Participated in the 2001 International Poultry 
   and Egg Exhibition January 17-19, 2000 where the ESCS and related posters were 
   displayed in a commercial exhibit for hatchery equipment. Recent developments 
   in methods for culturing eggs and other poultry samples to detect SE contaminants 
   have been incorporated into the testing protocols of a national flock testing 
   program under development by FDA. 8. List your most important publications in

   role of photoperiod and melatonin in alleviating the negative economic impact 
   of different stressors on broiler performance, immunity and health. 2) To study 
   the influence of induced molting in laying hens on subsequent effects of different 
   stressors on production performance, immunity, health and hormone profiles. 
   3) To determine the mechanisms involved in the initiation of immune responses,

 <br>
 <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="color:
 #000000">APPROACH: In studying the effect of photoperiod on broiler performance 
   under stressful conditions, CobbxCobb broiler chicks will be used and exposed 
   to either continuous light (23L:1D) or intermittent light (1L:3D). Half of the 
   birds in each group will be exposed to 35C (heat stress) from 21 to 42 days 
   of age, the other half will be exposed to 24C (control). Production parameters 
   such as body weight, feed consumption, feed conversion, and mortality will be 
   measured weekly. Immune parameters such as cytokines and antibody production 
   will be measured at 3 and 6 weeks of age. In studying the effect of melatonin 
   on broiler performance under stressful conditions, again CobbxCobb broiler chicks 
   will be used. They will be kept under 23L:1D and receive in the feed either 
   0, 20, 40, or 60 ppm melatonin. The same heat stress treatment mentioned above 
   will be applied as well as production and immune parameters. In order to study 
   the influence of induced molting in laying hens on subsequent effects of different 
   stressors on production performance, immunity, health and hormone profiles, 
   72-week-old laying hens will be induced molted and following period of egg laying, 
   they will be exposed to different kinds of stresses. Percent hen-day egg production, 
   percentage hen-housed egg production, egg shell quality (specific gravity method), 
   albumin quality, albumin height, Haugh units, feed consumption, feed per dozen 
   eggs, and percent mortality will be measured throughout the experiment. Corticosterone 
   T3,T4, and prolactin will be measured in the plasma at different times during 
   the experiment. Antibody production and cell mediated immunity will also be 
   measured. In order to study the mechanisms involved in the initiation of immune 
   responses under different stressful conditions, Cornell K-strain Single Comb 
   White Leghorn immature male chickens will be used. The birds will be housed 
   in batteries with food and water available ad libitum, and exposed to 16L:8D 
   per day. Birds will be exposed to different environmental and management stressors. 
   Different high temperatures will be used as the environmental stressor and different 
   population densities will be used as the management stressor. Different T-independent 
   and T-dependent antigens will be used to stimulate humoral immunity in these 
   chickens. Blood and spleen samples will be collected at different time periods 
   post-injection. Specific cytokines will be measured in all samples collected 
   as appropriate. Antibodies against the different antigens will be measured in 
   all plasma samples collected. Percentage of different lymphocyte subpopulations 
   will be measured in all blood and spleen samples.</span></span></p>

 style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="color:
 #000000">While live oocyst vaccination provides a viable alternative to anticoccidial 
   usage and resulting drug-resistance in the commercial poultry industry, complete 
   resistance to coccidia is difficult to achieve due to immunovariability between 
   vaccine species and field strains. Immunovariability between coccidia species 
   in vaccines and those found in poultry rearing facilities has emerged as a potential 
   complication associated with vaccination. Additionally, there have been reports 
   of coccidia-like impacts on performance with minimal appearance of coccidia 
   lesions in the field environment. The purpose of the experiments conducted was 
   to evaluate the host response to different field isolates of Eimeria acervulina 
   (EA) by associating classical mucosal lesions with decreased body weight gain 
   in infected broilers, to compare the host response of two commercial broiler 
   breeds to the field isolates of EA, and to determine if other vectors (bacterial) 
   may contribute to the a differential host response. Experiments were conducted 
   comparing two isolates of EA, EA1 and EA2, obtained from commercial poultry 
   rearing facilities. In three experiments, commercial broilers chicks were divided 
   into control (non-challenged) and EA1 or EA2 challenged groups at 14 days of 
   age. In all 3 experiments, EA1 resulted in significantly (P is less than 0.05) 
   higher lesion scores than EA2, however weight gain of EA1 challenged birds was 
   not significantly different from controls. EA2 challenged birds had significantly 
   higher lesion scores than control birds in Expts 1 and 3, with no lesions characteristic 
   of classical EA infection in Expt 2. EA2 resulted in significantly decreased 
   weight gain as compared to EA1 or control in Expt 3. While EA1 resulted in classical 
   EA lesions with no significant difference in weight gain, EA2 resulted in few 
   classical lesions with significant depression of weight gain. Subjective observation 
   of intestines from EA2 challenged birds was suggestive of a severe secretory 
   intestinal response and weakened intestinal strength. In Expt 4, EA2 oocysts 
   were cleaned with 5.25 percent sodium hypochlorite to evaluate the possibility 
   of an external bacterial factor contributing to the observed detrimental affects 
   in the presence of few lesions. Birds were challenged with bleached or non-bleached 
   EA2. Although there was no significant difference in lesion scores between EA2 
   challenged groups, non-bleached EA2 resulted in significantly decreased weight 
   gain as compared to bleached. These data are indicative of immunovariability 
   between different isolates of the same coccidia species that result in differences 
   in clinical lesions and performance. Furthermore, the results indicate differences 
   in the host response that may contribute to the pathogenicity and suggest that 
   standard coccidia lesion scoring procedures may not be applicable for evaluation 
   of the severity of clinical infection with all Eimeria isolates.</span></span></p>

   expression in molted birds, objectives are 1) to determine if addition of dietary 
   moderate zinc-low calcium will prevent colonization of Salmonella Enteritidis 
   in the crop of chickens undergoing molting and what characteristics in the crop 
   microenvironment are associated with this type of induced molt, and 2) to understand 
   the potential role of that crop for Salmonella Enteritidis virulence expression 
   while birds are undergoing molting and if key characteristics in the chicken 
   crop microenvironment can be linked with limiting S. Enteritidis colonization 
   and virulence expression. B. The role of methanogens in establishment of anaerobic 
   microflora, the objectives are 1) to determine when methanogens become a part 
   of the cecal microflora, what characteristics in the cecal microenvironment 
   are associated with establishment of methanogens and enumerate the methanogen 
   populations, and 2) to determine how stable the cecal methanogen population 
   is by looking at whether feed deprivation alters methanogen activity while birds 
   are undergoing fasting and if key characteristics in the chicken cecal microenvironment 
   can be linked with decreased methanogen populations. The hypothesis is that 
   the final stages of cecal obligate anaerobic microfloral development will coincide 
   with the emergence of methanogens and their presence will signify completion 
   of establishment of the dynamic complex anaerobic population characteristic 
   of mature birds. In addition, we hypothesize that decreases in numbers of methanogens 
   signifies the beginning of instability in the cecal anaerobic microflora.</span></span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New
 Roman', serif"><span style="color: #000000">APPROACH: A. Salmonella virulence 
   expression in molted birds: the idea here is to compare the indigenous microbial 
   response in crops of birds that have been molted either by feed deprivation 
   or using the moderate Zn diet approach. The hypothesis is that feed intake will 
   be retained in the birds molted via moderate Zn addition and the crop microflora 
   will continue to be actively fermenting to the point of being inhibitory to 
   Salmonella Enteritidis colonization and invasion. Based on our earlier work 
   we hypothesize that the key indicators of an active fermentation in the crop 
   are low pH and a high concentration of lactate. Therefore, in addition to enumerating 
   Salmonella Enteritidis recovered after infection in the different treatment 
   groups we plan to thoroughly examine the microenvironment of the crops from 
   the birds in these different treatment groups. This will be done by quantitating 
   fermentation products and enumeration of the crop Lactobacilli. Whether these 
   key characteristics in the chicken crop microenvironment can be linked with 
   limiting S. Enteritidis in vivo invasion will be determined by examining virulence 
   activity of Salmonella Enteritidis (hilA-lacZY transcriptional operon fusion) 
   with a gene fusion strain for in vitro assays of crop contents. B. The role 
   of methanogens in establishment of anaerobic microflora: The overall experimental 
   concept in this proposal is to determine when methanogens appear in the ceca 
   as birds age on different diets and how stable the methanogen population is 
   during drastic dietary changes. To accomplish this, methanogens will be enumerated 
   from three different scenarios: 1) newly hatched chicks on different diets; 
   2) newly hatched chicks given a cecal transfer from adult birds and 3) feed 
   deprived molted laying hens. These three scenarios represent the commercial 
   settings where the cecal microflora are considered important in resisting colonization 
   by foodborne pathogens, namely, young chicks with or without a probiotic and 
   laying hens undergoing molting. In the proposed work we plan to thoroughly examine 
   the microenvironment of the ceca in the three groups of birds. This will done 
   by quantitating fermentation products (VFA, lactate, pH, and Eh) and in addition 
   to quantifying methanogens, enumerate microbial components of the ceca including 
   lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, Escherichia coli, total aerobic and anaerobic 
   bacteria. The rationale for these choices is that aerobic bacteria and E. coli 
   represent facultative populations that are generally early colonizers of the 
   chick ceca, followed by lactobacilli and bifidobacteria and finally the strict 
   anaerobes. These subgroups of organisms in addition to the fermentation products 
   should give us a representative profile of the microbial population changes 
   occurring in the ceca prior to and during the establishment of methanogens. 
   Whether these characteristics in the chicken cecal microenvironment can be linked 
   with establishment of methanogens will be the outcome of this component of the 
   proposal.</span></span></p>

   its life cycle Salmonella spp. can encounter various environmental stress conditions 
   which may have dramatic effects on their survival and virulence. One of the 
   potential stress conditions that can be frequently encountered by foodborne 
   pathogens is exposure to starvation stress. We have found that virulence expression 
   of S. enteritidis and S. typhimurium to various stress conditions associated 
   with food systems or host environments could be greatly increased by exposure 
   to SCFA, and further enhanced by feed deprivation and the resulting microenvironment 
   in the crop of molted laying hens. We continue to investigate the molecular

 <br>
 <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New
 Roman', serif"><span style="color: #000000">OBJECTIVES: Our goals for this project 
   are: Goal #1: Evaluate the host local immune responses to Salmonella infection 
   and investigate the effects of various immunomodulating factors. Goal#2: Determine 
   the effects of various vaccination and intervention strategies on the immune 
   response and colonization, persistence and shedding of Salmonella in laying 
   chickens. Goal #3: Examine the impact of forced molting on the immune status 
   of commercial laying chickens.</span></span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span
 style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="color:
 #000000">APPROACH: The immune system is still the most powerful and effective 
   system the host has in preventing and eliminating infections by microorganisms. 
   Although SE infection may not result in serious illness in chickens, a carrier 
   state may be established, suggesting that the immune system of the chicken is 
   ineffective in completely preventing SE infection, invasion and shedding. We 
   propose to systematically examine the immune system of the chicken before, during 
   and after SE infection to gain a greater understanding of how the microorganism 
   and the immune system interact. We will also examine mechanisms of altering 
   this immune response in order to enhance the resistance to colonization, enhance 
   the elimination of the microorganism and prevent shedding. Studies will not 
   only take place under controlled laboratory conditions, but will also investigate 
   the impact of the immune system on Salmonella infections of commercial laying 
   chickens on farms. In recent years, SE has been the most commonly isolated Salmonella 
   serotype in humans in the U.S.6 Between 1985 and 1991, eggs were the primary 
   vehicle of SE infection in 82% of human food borne outbreaks.7 Control of SE 
   in man will depend upon effective means of reducing SE in eggs. In order to 
   effectively do this we must first understand the pathogenesis of Salmonella 
   in poultry and the impact the immune system has on this infection. This could 
   lead to strategies to modulate the immune system to better prevent and control 
   Salmonella infections, thereby leading to effective pathogen reduction or elimination. 
   We have established a consortium of researchers with expertise relevant to addressing 
   the above research goals. This group will carry out a comprehensive evaluation 
   of the role of the immune system in SE-elimination from various age groups of 
   birds. In this proposal, we will investigate the potential of several intervention 
   strategies for controlling SE infection in hens and determine their possible 
   mechanisms of action. Additionally, the field component of this proposal is 
   a unique feature, which has been identified as a key factor in the egg safety 
   action plan (a federal initiative designed to reduce the threat of SE in shell 
   eggs). Our proposed work includes examining the impact of forced molting on 
   the immune system and SE in commercial laying hens. We have performed preliminary 
   studies on various aspects of Salmonella-host interaction and have established 
   the methodology necessary to carry out the investigations outlined in this proposal. 
   This research should not only provide basic information on the pathogen-host 
   cell interaction, but also give vital information on how the immune system of 
   the chicken can be used to control or eliminate the spread of SE from animals 
   to man.</span></span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New
 Roman', serif"><span style="color: #000000">NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY: Salmonella 
   enteritidis (SE) carried by chickens and shed into and onto shell eggs has become 
   a major source of human intestinal infections. Despite a large amount of research, 
   there are still no effective measures for preventing SE colonization, and we 
   still lack an understanding of why Salmonella infected hens remain persistently 
   infected. This study will investigate the immunobiology of Salmonella infections 
   in laying chickens and develop novel immunomodulating strategies for the intervention 
   of Salmonella colonization, persistence, shedding and egg contamination.</span></span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style="font-family: 'Times
 New Roman', serif"><span style="color: #000000">PROGRESS: 2001/01 TO 2001/12</span></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',
 serif"><span style="color: #000000">In the last 20 years there has been an increase 
   in human food-poisoning outbreaks attributable to Salmonella enteritidis (SE) 
   in the United States. Epidemiological studies of this increase have indicated 
   that grade A shell eggs are an important source of SE. Despite the tremendous 
   efforts made by the poultry industry, no effective measures for elimination 
   of SE colonization have been developed. The humoral immune responses after infection 
   with SE have been extensively studied for diagnostic purposes. However, the 
   fundamental mechanism of mucosal resistance to infection and clearance of SE 
   from the gut has received scant attention. Protection from infection by SE through 
   humoral mechanisms alone is unlikely, due to the organism being a facultative 
   intracellular bacterium. There is enough evidence in various animal models that 
   cell mediated immunity plays a major role in controlling Salmonella infection. 
   In chickens, thus far, there is lack of detailed knowledge on the immune mechanisms 
   involved in defense against Salmonella infection. Our studies thus far have 
   supported earlier conclusions that natural infection produces weak and transient 
   immune responses that are ineffective at preventing or clearing a Salmonella 
   infection. We have found that immunization with a killed vaccine provides a 
   better immune response than using a modified live vaccine. This immunity is 
   better with respect to intestinal IgA (which is the main barrier to Salmonella 
   colonization of the intestinal tract) and better in producing cellular immunity 
   (that which is responsible for eliminating the infection). This is somewhat 
   surprising, as traditional thinking indicated that killed vaccines were not 
   effective at eliciting good cellular immunity. We are currently preparing several 
   publications regarding these findings. A further goal in this research was to 
   evaluate various methods of increasing the chick's natural resistance to infection. 
   To this end we have been developing and evaluating various compounds that could 
   be administered in ovo, to increase the innate immunity of the chick at hatch. 
   One of the first substances we evaluated was a genetic adjuvant. This is a short 
   stretch of nucleic acids containing many C and G bases in a particular motif. 
   These sequences are bacterial in origin and have been shown in the mammalian 
   system to up regulate the immune system. We have synthesized several of these 
   sequences in various motifs and have shown that some of them are also powerful 
   stimulants in activating avian cells. We have shown the CpG oligonucleotides 
   to increase macrophage intracellular nitric oxide, increase expression of cell 
   surface antigens and increase expression of IL-6 in vitro. Preliminary studies 
   have also shown it to have similar effects when delivered in ovo. We are in 
   the process of preparing a publication reporting this novel and important finding. 
   As further goals in this project we are continuing to explore vaccination and 
   other methods of increasing the immunity of the hatched chick, such that it 
   is better able to resist Salmonella infection at hatch.</span></span></p>

   of research can be found in the report for the parent CRIS 3602-33000-002- 00D 
   Ethology of Food Producing Animals. A second postdoctoral associate has been 
   hired under this agreement, bringing expertise in poultry behavior from Europe 
   that is not available in the U.S. The use of gestation stalls is banned in Europe 
   and questioned in the U.S. for animal welfare reasons. A project with Dr. Ed 
   Pajor, Purdue University, comparing confinement in gestation stalls or access 
   to group areas during gestation is under analysis. Gilt cortisol, immune function, 
   and acuta phase response data is completed and will be presented at the 2002 
   National Animal Science Meeting. Gilt behavioral data and piglet immune function 
   and behavioral data are being analyzed. This work will become part of a scientific 
   data set that will be used to establish swine welfare standards by commercial 
   users. With recent dairy expansions, the time that cattle are in holding areas 
   waiting to enter the parlor has increased. A study in collaboration with Dr. 
   Mike Schutz and Dr. Ed Pajor, Purdue University, investigated short term physiological 
   and behavioral changes caused by the increased holding time (40 minutes or 2 
   hours). Data are being analyzed. This work will be useful to producers and extension 
   agents during dairy expansions for advise on appropriate holding times prior 
   to milking. A poultry behavior project in collaboration with Dr. Ed Pajor, Purdue 
   University, that will investigate imprinting affects on chick behavior is underway.

   of this research is (1) to examine differences in chicken behavior and physiology 
   under conditions of no fast-induced molting, natural molting and fast-induced 
   molting under control (no-molt) and experimental (molt) conditions using individual 
   chickens as their own controls to assess the amount of pain, suffering and/or 
   stress in chickens under various types of molting and (2) to develop protocols 
   for inducing molt that reduce pain, suffering or stress in chickens if fast-induced 
   molting is found to </span></span></p>

 <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New
 Roman', serif"><span style="color: #000000">APPROACH: Eight groups of three chickens 
   housed in standard cages at the VMTRC will be the subjects of this study. Four 
   experimental groups will be subjected to fast-induced molting. Two experimental 
   groups will be subjected to no fast-induced molting in which a low caloric diet 
   will be given to the chickens. Two control groups will be unmanaged and allowed 
   to undergo natural molting. During all experiments, feed and water consumption, 
   egg production and physical appearance will be monitored on a per cage basis. 
   Data will be collected daily to monitor au natural inanition and to follow the 
   progress of the molt. Stage 1. Normative data on chicken behavior, both social 
   and vocal interactions, will be collected on and analyzed from video and audio 
   tape to develop a comprehensive ethogram for use in the subsequent stages. Dominance 
   or pecking order will be determined for each group to account for its effects 
   on differential rates of behaviors by each individual. These normative data 
   are important because little is known on the types or rates of behaviors and 
   vocalizations of chickens that are indicative of psychological or physiological 
   pain, suffering or stress. Examples of possible types and changes in rates of 
   behaviors that might indicate increased stress include aggressive pecking, cage 
   (non-nutritive) pecking, stereotyped pacing, head flicking and alarm vocalizations. 
   Stage 2. Chickens will be subjected to a housing and lighting program that typically 
   would be used by the poultry industry during normal production. During this 
   stage, behavioral and vocal data will be collected for one hour twice on three 
   days per week on both the types and rates of aggressive and alarm behaviors 
   and vocalizations. Stage 3. Chickens will be subjected to the different treatments 
   and behavioral and vocal data will be collected as described above. Experimental 
   groups will be molted by withdrawing feed, or by a low caloric diet feeding, 
   under the housing and lighting conditions typical of an induced molting program 
   used by the poultry industry. The control groups will be similarly subjected 
   to the housing and lighting conditions but feed will not be withdrawn. For all 
   groups, data will also be collected on body weight, feather status and body 
   temperature during Stages II and III in order to monitor molting status. Blood 
   samples will be drawn from subjects for subsequent hormonal analyses to measures 
   cortisol levels, which is used as physiological indicator of chronic stress. 
   Serum prolactin (PRL) levels will also be measured as a physiologic indicator 
   of reproductive tract involution, which is an indicative of future reproductive 
   performance and egg quality. Behavioral data will be analyzed from the videotapes 
   using a focal animal and 10-second interval sampling regime. This regime will 
   permit us to analyze both the types and rates of aggressive, alarm and other 
   stress-related behaviors under control and experimental conditions with each 
   chicken acting as her own control. Behavioral and physiological data will be 
   statistically analyzed using mixed effects linear regression in S-Plus statistical 
   software.</span></span></p>

   of egg-laying chickens is cruel. This management practice is widespread in the 
   commercial industry of California and other states because it provides significant 
   benefits to both the producer and the consumer, as well to the health of the 
   chicken flock. The purpose of this study is to evaluate changes in the behavior 
   and physiology of chickens under non-molt conditions and three types of molt 
   conditions to assess the well-being of chickens subjected to induced molting.

 <p><span
 style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="color:
 #000000">Food poisoning caused by poultry meat and eggs contaminated with Salmonella 
   enteritidis (SE) are the leading causes of food poisoning in the U.S. and in 
   the developed world. We postulated that fecal shedding and egg transmission 
   of SE can be reduced by vaccination with a live, attenuated SE vaccine. The 
   goal of this project was to develop a safe and effective live Salmonella enteritidis 
   vaccine as a safeguard against food poisoning of poultry origin. The objectives 
   of the project were to: 1) improve the heterophil and adapted SE vaccine (HASE); 
   2) to test the improved HASE vaccine by long-term monitoring of chicken feces, 
   egg shells and egg contents; 3) to assess cloacal vs. vertical (transovarian) 
   SE contamination of eggs; and 4) to determine the virulence/avirulence of the 
   HASE in mammalian animal models. Objectives 1-3 were fully met in 1997. Preliminary 
   data were gathered on the mammalian safety of the HASE vaccine. Specific objectives 
   for 1998-1999 research were: 1) Continue work on demonstration of human safety 
   of HASE vaccine TK 605 using a mouse model; 2) Investigate cellular and molecular 
   basis for mechanism of action of HASE TK 605 vaccine by probing into vaccine-heterophil 
   interactions, by comparing phagocytic indices of SE and HASE at multiple adaptive 
   steps by fluorescein activated cell sorting (FACS); 3) Expand the applicability 
   of heterophil adaptation to other gram-negative bacteria of importance to the 
   poultry industry. Scientific advances over the life of the project: 1) The vaccine 
   adaptation steps were increased to 11. Fecal shedding of vaccine and of challenge 
   were very satisfactorily reduced. The vaccine strain was given at a dose of 
   10(8)CFU for three consecutive days by gavage. It was shed by 2 hens on the 
   3rd day after vaccination, and by 1 hen on the 11th day after vaccination; 3) 
   Fecal shedding of challenge ceased on the 9th day after challenge in the vaccinated 
   group, and persisted for the 40-day duration after challenge in the challenge 
   control group. 2) None of 525 eggs cultured after vaccination were infected. 
   One egg isolation was made from 422 eggs in the vaccinated group after challenge. 
   Of the 12 egg isolations in the challenge control group, 8 were egg shell (cloacal) 
   isolates, and 4 were egg content isolates (transovarian). These limited data 
   suggest the cloacal infection of eggs is the major risk factor. 3) A safe and 
   effective live SE vaccine was developed in 1997. Many vaccines are effective 
   in preventing disease, but few are also effective in preventing colonization 
   and infection. The HASE TK 605 vaccine has met this stringent criterion. 4) 
   It was shown that increasing the number of granulocyte (heterophil) passages 
   from 6X to 11X has greatly improved the safety and effectiveness of the granulocyte 
   adapted SE vaccine.</span></span></p>

   Understand the potential role of the crop for Salmonella Enteritidis virulence

 <br>
 <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New

   the indigenous microbial response in crops of birds that have been molted either 
   by feed deprivation or using a moderate Zn diet approach. The hypothesis is 
   that feed intake will be retained in the birds molted via moderate Zn addition 
   and the crop microflora will continue to be actively fermenting to the point 
   of being inhibitory to Salmonella Enteritidis colonization and invasion. In 
   addition to enumerating Salmonella Enteritidis recovered after infection in 
   the different treatment groups we plan to quantitate fermentation products and

 <br>
 <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="color:
 #000000">NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY: During the past 10-15 years, the number of cases 
   of gastroenteritis due to Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Enteritidis 
   (S. Enteritidis) infections has greatly increased in the U.S. and Europe and 
   by 1995, S. Enteritidis comprised 25% of all foodborne Salmonella isolates. 
   Between 1985 and 1991, over 80% of S. Enteritidis infections in the U.S. were 
   associated with table eggs and this may be linked to the specific stressful 
   management practice of inducing a molt to stimulate multiple egg-laying cycles 
   in hens. Feed withdrawal is the primary method used in the layer industry to 
   induce molting. However, feed withdrawal dramatically enhances S. Enteritidis 
   recovery from crops, increases invasion of organs in chickens and increases 
   horizontal transfer in flocks. The poultry industry needs alternative molting 
   procedures that do not require feed withdrawal but allow managers to keep the 
   economic advantages of recycling laying hens by molting without causing a S. 
   Enteritidis contamination problem. In this proposal we plan to determine whether 
   molt induction diets will minimize S. Enteritidis and if key characteristics 
   in the chicken crop microenvironment can be linked with limiting S. Enteritidis 
   colonization and pathogenesis.</span></span></p>

 <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',
 serif"><span style="color: #000000">1. What major problem or issue is being resolved 
   and how are you resolving it? This project focuses on explaining the pathogenesis 
   of Salmonella enteritidis (SE) infections in chickens and developing improved 
   methods for prevention, detection, and control. Among the principal goals of 
   the research are determining the processes and mechanisms by which SE infects 
   chickens, spreads vertically and horizontally, and is deposited in eggs; assessing 
   the influence of strain variations on the ability of SE to invade host organs 
   and contaminate eggs; evaluating environmental factors that result in the emergence 
   of virulent forms of SE from avirulent populations; developing more sensitive 
   and specific diagnostic tests for identifying SE infections of chickens and 
   for detecting SE contamination of eggs; developing and evaluating effective 
   killed and live vaccines for controlling SE infections in chickens and associated 
   egg contamination; and developing electrostatic space charging technology to 
   diminish the airborne spread of SE throughout poultry hatching and housing facilities. 
   2. How serious is the problem? Why does it matter? The association between human 
   illness caused by SE and the consumption of contaminated poultry products is 
   an important international public health and economic problem. In recent years, 
   SE has been among the Salmonella serotypes most often reported to cause human 
   illness. Eggs have been the most frequently implicated sources of human SE infections 
   in the United States. As food-borne transmission of SE threatens both the safety 
   of consumers and the ability of poultry producers to market their products, 
   the formulation and implementation of effective control strategies for reducing 
   the incidence of SE infections in chickens has been identified as an urgent 
   priority by both government and industry. 3. How does it relate to the National 
   Program(s) and National Component(s)? National Program 108, Food Safety (100%) 
   This research contributes to the Microbial Pathogens component of the Food Safety 
   National Program by providing scientists (veterinary, food, and agricultural), 
   regulatory agency officials, and the poultry industry with urgently needed tools 
   to understand, detect, and control SE infections of chickens. 4. What were the 
   most significant accomplishments this past year? A. Single Most Significant 
   Accomplishment during FY2000 year. No activity for this fiscal year. This project 
   has been terminated and replaced by CRIS number 6612-32000-026. All activity 
   is reported under that CRIS number. B. Other Significant Accomplishment(s), 
   if any. No activity for this fiscal year. This project has been terminated and 
   replaced by CRIS number 6612-32000-026. All activity is reported under that 
   CRIS number. 5. Describe the major accomplishments over the life of the project 
   including their predicted or actual impact. This project provided the first 
   definitive experimental documentation that hens systemically infected with SE 
   could produce internally contaminated eggs. Scientists found that SE infections 
   can be highly persistent in both chicks and hens and elicit long-lasting antibody 
   titers. The project developed and assessed the sensitivity and predictive value 
   of methods for detecting specific antibodies in serum and egg yolks from infected 
   hens. The project developed effective and practical bacteriological methods 
   for consistently detecting very small numbers of SE contaminants in eggs. Efficient 
   killed vaccines were developed and evaluated for reducing the susceptibility 
   of laying hens to SE infection. Studies assessed the relationship between phage 
   type of SE isolates and their virulence, infectivity, and invasiveness in chicks. 
   One scientist determined that air movement can mediate the horizontal transmission 
   of SE infection. An ESCS was developed under a CRADA to reduce airborne dust 
   and microorganisms in hatching cabinets. The ESCS has been shown to have effectiveness 
   comparable to a 95% media filter for removing dust in laboratory experiments 
   in hatching cabinets and transmission cabinets and equal or better effectiveness 
   for removing airborne bacteria and Salmonella. The ESCS reduced airborne SE 
   in an isolation room with caged layers approximately 95%. The kill rate of the 
   ESCS on airborne and surface SE at close range has been shown to be 98% or more. 
   The ESCS has been patented and an exclusive license for poultry applications 
   has been approved with BioIon, Inc. to manufacture and distribute the system. 
   6. What do you expect to accomplish, year by year, over the next 3 years? No 
   activity for this fiscal year. This project has been terminated and replaced 
   by CRIS number 6612-32000-026. All activity is reported under that CRIS number. 
   7. What science and/or technologies have been transferred and to whom? When 
   is the science and/or technology likely to become available to the end user 
   (industry, farmer, other scientists)? What are the constraints if known, to 
   the adoption &amp; durability of the technology product? No activity for this 
   fiscal year. This project has been terminated and replaced by CRIS number 6612-32000-026.

 <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New
 Roman', serif"><span style="color: #000000">1. What major problem or issue is 
   being resolved and how are you resolving it? Salmonella enteritidis (SE)is the 
   causative agent of pandemic salmonellosis in people, which is most often acquired 
   by consumption of contaminated eggs. The reservoir involved in transmission 
   of SE to people is well identified, namely the egg-laying hen. It can be difficult 
   to identify infected flocks, because they do not often become ill and because 
   the organism can be difficult to detect in the hen-house environment even when 
   the organs of birds are positive. It is also accepted that mice are important 
   vectors for transmission of SE to hens. Thus, the basic biology of SE appears 
   to have unique parameters as compared to what happens when other types of Salmonella 
   are in the on-farm environment. This research program addresses how the biology 
   and genetics of SE differs from that other Salmonella. 2. How serious is the 
   problem? Why does it matter? Increased illness in people from SE has existed 
   for at least 20 years and it is currently the most prevalent serotype causing 
   salmonellosis in the world and the second most prevalent in the U.S. The concern 
   is that the incidence of illness in the U.S. from SE has the potential to increase 
   to levels seen in Western Europe and other countries. 3. How does it relate 
   to the National Program(s) and National Component(s)? This projects is in the 
   Microbial Pathogens component of National Program 108, Food Safety (100%). The 
   research evaluates how the biology and genetics of SE can be used to halt its, 
   growth and survival in chickens and in the hen house, because these links in 
   the infection route to humans precede egg contamination. 4. What were the most 
   significant accomplishments this past year? A. Single Most Significant Accomplishment 
   during FY 2001 year: SE had been thought to be a single clone with minimal difference 
   between isolates from different geographic regions. This project studied surface 
   carbohydrate variation of SE, especially from mice in chickens houses, and showed 
   that SE has a significantly more variable cell surface than did Salmonella typhimurium, 
   which is another important cause of human illness not associated with egg contamination. 
   These findings supported the concept that the house mouse plays a unique role 
   in the pandemic associated with SE. B. Other Significant Accomplishment(s), 
   if any: The genetic basis for why SE is infectious was poorly understood. A 
   series of infection studies were conducted that revealed that loss of a molecule 
   called flagella enhances the ability of SE to be infectious when given by mouth. 
   This information may indicate that vaccines directed against the flagella may 
   prevent SE infections. 5. Describe the major accomplishments over the life of 
   the project including their predicted or actual impact. This research identified 
   that it is possible to use the structure of the lipopolysaccharide molecule 
   of SE and other Salmonella serotypes to conduct epidemiological investigations 
   of how strain heterogeneity potentially contributes to emerging patterns of 
   salmonellosis in people and animals. The outcome of this research is improved 
   epidemiological methods for monitoring emergence of SE and other potential pathogens 
   on-farm by increasing knowledge of how bacteria can change to cause sustained 
   illness in people through the food supply 6. What do you expect to accomplish, 
   year by year, over the next 3 years? This project was terminated. 7. What science 
   and/or technologies have been transferred and to whom? When is the science and/or 
   technology likely to become available to the end user (industry, farmer, other 
   scientists)? What are the constraints if known, to the adoption &amp; durability 
   of the technology product? The science and technology of how to assess strain 
   heterogeneity of SE has been transmitted to epidemiologists, infectious disease 
   experts, and public health officials through publications broadly available 
   in peer-reviewed journals. It is being made available to farmers and industry 
   through vaccine studies funded by CRADAS that will deliver improved products 
   to market. One aspect of the science has been made available to industry by 
   patenting. The technology is durable, because the general knowledge about how 
   to grow and analyze SE can be applied to other bacteria. 8. List your most important 
   publications in the popular press (no abstracts) and presentations to non-scientific

 <p><span
 style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="color:
 #000000">1. What major problem or issue is being resolved and how are you resolving 
   it? Induced molting is an important management tool used by 70-80% of the layer 
   industry to achieve a second egg lay from aging hens (an estimated 168-192 million 
   hens are molted annually). Previous experimental studies showed that molting 
   via long term feed removal dramatically increased problems with Salmonella enterica 
   serotype Enteritidis (SE). Because of the studies, molting has come under increased 
   scrutiny by federal regulatory agencies and animal welfare groups as a potential 
   food safety issue. Information is still too limited to determine the legitimacy 
   of such claims and the current project will provide additional information by 
   determining whether molting in a commercial setting similarly increases SE problems, 
   examining alternative molting procedures with respect to their effects on SE 
   infection, studying intervention strategies such as vaccination to ameliorate 
   the problem, investigating in detail the degree of stress in birds subjected 
   to molt and whether alternative molt procedures are less stressful, and studying 
   the physiological effects of molting to determine potential causes of the exacerbated 
   infection observed in the hens during molt. 2. How serious is the problem? Why 
   does it matter? Eggs produced by molted hens may be a food safety risk to the 
   consuming public. It is estimated that fully a third of the profits derived 
   from a flock during its life span comes from molted hens. The producer could 
   lose this very important management tool unless studies are conducted to assess 
   the problem, develop intervention strategies to reduce the problem, and generate 
   new methods to recycle flocks. 3. How does it relate to the National Program(s) 
   and National Component(s)? This project is in the National Programs 108 on Food 
   Safety (75%) and 103 on Animal Health (25%). In Food Safety, developing alternatives 
   to molting of laying hens that will prolong their productive egg laying and 
   not be conducive to SE infection supports the Microbial Pathogens Component. 
   In addition, the project's objectives and goals are aligned with the President's 
   Council on Food Safety 1999 Action Plan document that directs further research 
   to provide data on molting to federal action agencies that will support regulation 
   of industry practices based on logical, science- based information. In Animal 
   Health, the stress component of the studies addresses Disease Control Strategies 
   and Host/Pathogen Interactions components. 4. What were the most significant 
   accomplishments this past year? A. Single most significant accomplishment during

   5. Describe the major accomplishments over the life of the project including 
   their predicted or actual impact. This was a 3 month temporary bridging CRIS. 
   Previous accomplishments of the CRIS dealing with molting include - 1) molting 
   depressed cell-mediated immunity in hens; 2) molting increased the severity 
   of SE infections in hens; 3) molting made the hens 1,000-10,000-fold more susceptible 
   to an SE infection which resulted in the rapid transmission SE to uninfected, 
   but exposed, molted hens. As a result of these studies, the USDA/FSIS Salmonella 
   enteritidis Risk Assessment Team, in their 1998 Risk Assessment document, placed 
   molting as a central flock variable for increasing the risk of eggs produced 
   which contain SE. 4) developed alternative molting procedure using wheat middlings 
   which dramatically decreased SE levels in hens. As a result of these studies, 
   researchers have moved to field studies to examine the economic utility of using 
   wheat middlings in a commercial situation. 6. What do you expect to accomplish, 
   year by year, over the next 3 years? This project was a 3 month temporary bridging 
   project and is terminated. 7. What science and/or technologies have been transferred

 <br>
 <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New

   understanding of Salmonella enteritidis-chicken interactions at the molecular 
   level. This will be accomplished using unique mutants that are resistant to 
   chicken heterophil killing and by completing the following specific aims: 1)We 
   will complete the assessment of the SE mutants in chicken in order to assess 
   their pattern of colonization of infected tissues and affinity for egg laying 
   tissues; 2) Genes involved in immune cell resistance will be identified by screening 
   complemented strains in cell cultures; 3) Mutations will be constructed in these 
   genes in the wild type strain in order to confirm their role in immune cell 
   resistance; 4) Mutants will be assessed for virulence and egg transmissibility 
   in chickens. For unknown reasons, immune cell resistance is directly linked 
   to lowered virulence in SE. These studies will shed light on the possible mechanisms 
   involved and add to our understanding of salmonella pathogenesis.</span></span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style="font-family: 'Times

   strains expressing green fluorescent protein to enhance our ability to follow 
   S. enteritidis in host tissues and eggs. These strains will then be used to 
   infect chickens and bacteriological and histopathological studies undertaken. 
   Cosmid libraries of wild type S. enteritidis will be constructed and used to 
   complement the mutant strains. Complementing clones with wild type phenotype 
   will then be analyzed by subcloning and transposon mutagenesis, and the genes 
   involves in heterophil resistance (htr) sequenced and analyzed. Knockout mutations 
   in putative htr genes will be constructed in wild type strains, and the resulting 
   strains analyzed for sensitivity in heterophil cultures.</span></span></p>

 <p><span
 style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="color:
 #000000">The overall goal of this proposal was to determine the genetic basis 
   for heterophile resistance of a Salmonella enteritidis (SE) mutant (TK605) and 
   to characterize this mutant in terms of its persistence and vaccine potential. 
   The latter aim was accomplished in the first two years of the grant. A third 
   aim was to develop green fluorescent protein (GFP) producing strains of SE strain 
   TK474 and follow their transmission through the chicken to learn more about 
   the cell types and tissue locations for SE during persistence. After integrating 
   the GFPuv structural gene downstream of the lac promoter in the chromosome, 
   colonies were unexpectedly fluorescently unstable in their fluorescence after 
   in vitro passage. We then obtained another derivative of GFP on a R6 vector 
   used in Salmonella typhimurium studies, which was stable in SE after prolonged 
   passage in vitro. Studies of this construct in SE in mature hens showed that 
   the numbers of fluorescent salmonella in tissues was low, making it difficult 
   to follow the organism in specific tissues, and we did not pursue this avenue 
   further. To determine the genetic basis for heterophile adaption, we sought 
   to complement the mutations in SE strain TK605 using cosmid based approaches. 
   The differences in survival between the mutant and wild type strains in chicken 
   heterophile cultures, however, were not great enough to allow direct selection 
   for a complemented mutant strain. Instead, we focused the last 18 months on 
   invasion studies and signature tagged mutagenesis (STM) to identify genes needed 
   for SE cell invasion with the hypothesis that invasion is critical for heterophile 
   survival, tissue dissemination and persistence in the reproductive tract. STM 
   invasion negative mutants were identified using Vero cell cultures. Assays using 
   MTT or XTT to quantify the number of Salmonella present after lysis of the Vero 
   cells had high background and variability. Invasion was then assessed by a growth/no-growth 
   assay on brilliant green agar plates containing kanamycin, which led to the 
   identification of 46 invasion-negative mutants. These mutants were then tested 
   in a day-old chick model for virulence. The livers of all birds were sampled 
   for Salmonella mutants using brilliant green agar plates with kanamycin. Virulence 
   varied among the invasion-negative mutants with some low pathogenicity and some 
   retaining high virulence, rapidly killing all chicks in a group. Further, STM 
   experiments were also performed, and the mutants displayed variability in their 
   ability to persist in chickens in comparison to wild type salmonella. Identification 
   of the STM mini-transposon insertion site by DNA sequencing is currently in 
   progress. Direct cloning of the transposon and flanking sequences, and direct 
   sequencing of chromosomal DNA had little success. The most successful method 
   for obtaining junction site sequences was using inverse PCR. The insertion site 
   for eleven of the forty-six mutants has been identified. At the conclusion of 
   this stage, we will have identified different loci in SE involved in Vero cell 
   invasion and correlated that phenotype with persistence in mature chickens and 
   virulence in a day-old chick model.</span></span></p>

   of the pathogenic mechanisms of this organism. These genes might also provide 
   therapeutic targets for development of better intervention strategies both at

 <p><span
 style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="color:
 #000000">1. What major problem or issue is being resolved and how are you resolving 
   it? Pathogens such as Salmonella enteritidis (SE), avian influenza virus, and 
   Newcastle disease virus initiate their infections at mucosal surfaces such as 
   the intestinal or respiratory tract. Procedures which protect these sites from 
   infection, either by inducing active immunity or by reducing the challenge dose 
   reaching the animal would significantly reduce the morbidity, mortality, and 
   egg contamination resulting from infection. Vaccination regimens against these 
   infections generally involve parenteral injections which induce a good systemic 
   immune response. While this regimen does evoke a certain degree of protection 
   at mucosal surfaces, it is not complete - a certain percentage of the birds 
   remain infected and continue to shed organism into the environment and, in the 
   case of SE, produce eggs contaminated with the organism. This scenario is observed 
   regularly in the field and, as a result, vaccination against avian influenza 
   virus is not performed in chickens in this country and only moderate vaccination 
   against SE occurs. Recent serious outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza 
   in poultry in Mexico and in Hong Kong underscore the need for improved vaccination 
   regimens to combat this problem organism. The continuing problem of SE infections 
   in humans traced to contaminated eggs and the limited use by industry of currently 
   available vaccines indicates the need for newer and better immunization methods 
   to prevent infections. If immunity were to be elicited via mucosal vaccination 
   at the site where infection was initiated, there would be a greater chance of 
   stopping the organism before it has a chance to become firmly established within 
   the tissue. Our laboratory is taking a multiple-prong attack at this problem 
   by examining development of immunity at mucosal surfaces following infection 
   and comparing this response with that in serum. We are also developing vaccination 
   regimens which activate protective immunity at these surfaces. A third area 
   of research is the use of procedures to reduce the levels of the pathogen in 
   the air environment and therefore reduce the challenge dose reaching the bird. 
   2. How serious is the problem? Why does it matter? With highly pathogenic avian 
   influenza virus, the situation is grave and the primary remedy is massive flock 
   slaughter and quarantine of poultry products leaving the area, both of which 
   put a severe financial burden on the producer, the region, and the industry 
   as a whole. For SE, the situation is very serious. This organism is the leading 
   Salmonella serovar causing human food borne infections in the U.S. and, while 
   the number of outbreaks of food borne infections by this organism is decreasing, 
   the number of sporadic cases continues to increase. The significance of this 
   is two-fold: 1) a large number of individuals are becoming ill, and some die, 
   due to consumption of eggs contaminated with this organism; 2) this has dramatic 
   repercussions on the egg industry due to reduced egg consumption and the involvement 
   of regulatory agencies in diverting eggs to pasteurization. 3. How does it relate 
   to the National Program(s) and National Component(s) to which it has been assigned? 
   National Program 103, Animal Health (75%) National Program 108, Animal Health 
   (25%) Because of the disastrous nature of poultry infections by avian influenza 
   virus and Newcastle disease virus, regimens which prevent the initiation and 
   dissemination of the organisms within flocks fit well within the National Program 
   animal health mandate. Similarly, food safety is a major component of the National 
   Program agenda and intervention strategies which help prevent the dissemination 
   of a human disease organism within flocks and block the entry of the organism 
   into the human food chain are important areas of investigation. 4. What were 
   the most significant accomplishments this past year? Studies were conducted 
   with an electrostatic space charge system in a caged layer room to determine 
   dust reduction capabilities and potential of the system for reducing airborne 
   Salmonella enteritidis. Duplicated experiments in a caged layer room with artificially 
   and naturally generated dust indicated that electrostatic space charge system 
   treatment reduced dust concentration by 52-91%. Reductions in dust level of 
   50% reduce airborne bacterial counts by 100 fold or more. A prototype electrostatic 
   space charge system that included an automatic rinse system was developed and 
   installed in several commercial chicken hatcheries. The system reduced dust 
   by 82% and Salmonella positive cabinets by as much as 83%. Hatchability with 
   the system improved an average of 2.7%. The electrostatic space charge system 
   will decrease transmission of disease-causing organisms and improve food safety. 
   One-2 day-old chicks were unable to mount a significant antibody response in 
   either the serum or intestinal tract. In adult chickens, a strong systemic and 
   intestinal response to SE occurred within a week post challenge and the chickens 
   cleared the infection within several weeks. These results demonstrated that 
   the age when birds are exposed to infection is a very important variable with 
   regards to their ability to respond to challenge and also possibly to vaccination. 
   An ELISPOT assay was developed to detect specific antibody producing cells in 
   the spleen and cecal tonsil in birds either infected or vaccinated against SE. 
   This assay will assess the role of different intestinal tissues in the elicitation 
   of an intestinal immune response. Determined that certain compounds added to 
   Salmonella enteritidis killed vaccine emulsions resulted in an enhanced serum 
   and mucosal antibody response to the SE immunogen. This will improve vaccines 
   for use in SE control. 5. Describe the major accomplishments over the life of 
   the project including their predicted or actual impact. This a new CRIS, in 
   its third year, so a large proportion of the information was presented in Question 
   4. However, we found that chicks infected with SE at 1-2 days post hatch cannot 
   clear the infection and remain persistently infected for over 20 weeks. Serum 
   and mucosal responses in these birds were severely depressed, with many birds 
   not having any detectable SE-specific antibodies. When these individuals were 
   vaccinated or re-infected, they were only minimally able to respond immunologically 
   to the new stimulus, indicating that very little immunological memory occurred. 
   These studies point to the hatchery as a very important area to prevent SE infection 
   since challenge at this age can have serious repercussions on the health of 
   the chicks. In the previous CRIS we examined the effect of stress on immunity 
   in poultry and there were numerous accomplishments. We found that induced molting, 
   a procedure used by 70% of the layer industry to achieve a second egg lay from 
   aging flocks (affecting approximately 140-166 million hens annually) depressed 
   the immunity in the birds and substantially increased the severity of, susceptibility 
   to, and transmission of SE infections. Airborne transmission of SE, not normally 
   a route of spread of SE, was also observed in molted hens indicating that the 
   procedure could substantially affect the spread of the organism through a flock. 
   As a result of this work, molting was identified by USDA/APHIS as a major risk 
   factor for the production of eggs contaminated with SE. 6. What do you expect 
   to accomplish, year by year, over the next 3 years? Develop ELISPOT assays to 
   further delineate the immune response in various locations in the intestinal 
   tract to identify the most important areas for targeting vaccines. Determine 
   whether the cecal tonsil is an important organ for the development of an intestinal 
   immune response. Evaluate more compounds with respect to their adjuvanticity 
   in the intestinal tract and examine whether these vaccines can be adapted for 
   use in ovo vaccination protocols. 7. What science and/or technologies have been 
   transferred and to whom? When is the science and/or technology likely to become 
   available to the end user (industry, farmer, other scientists)? What are the 
   constraints if known, to the adoption &amp; durability of the technology product? 
   A patent application is pending for the electrostatic space charge system technology 
   and three license applications have been received for manufacture of the system. 
   Working under a CRADA with a manufacturer, we developed a panel system, using 
   monoclonal specific for SE flagella developed in our laboratory, for detecting 
   SE in poultry samples within 15 minutes. A Small Business Innovative Research 
   grant was awarded by USDA to further evaluate the capabilities of the panel 
   in depth. 8. List your most important non-peer reviewed publications and presentations

   Internal. Salmonella enteritidis is a pathogenic bacteria responsible for most 
   cases of human food poisoning acquired from eating chickens or eggs. Because 
   this bacterium does not usually cause symptoms in chickens, it is difficult 
   to detect contaminated flocks. The long term aim of this project is to design 
   a vaccine against S. enteritidis that can be easily administered to young chicks 
   to protect chickens and their eggs from infection.</span></span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New
 Roman', serif"><span style="color: #000000">APPROACH: Virulence factors that have 
   formed the basis of other vaccines include fimbriae, long proteinaceous molecules 
   on the bacterial surface. The SEF fimbriae are unique to S. enteritidis virulence 
   and seem to play a pivotal role in the ability of this particular bacteria to 
   infect chickens and eggs. Therefore, we will use a molecular genetic approach 
   to characterize the role of SEF fimbriae in virulence and to test the role of 
   SEF fimbriae as a protective immunogen.</span></span></p>

 <p><span
 style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="color:
 #000000">C-FAR 1999 Internal. The objective was to design an effective, inexpensive 
   vaccine against Salmonella enterica sv. enteriditis that can be administered 
   to young chicks to protect chickens and their eggs from infection. Preliminary 
   studies suggested that a type of fimbriae restricted to enteriditis may provide 
   a useful vaccine target. Fimbriae are long, proteinaceous structures that extend 
   from bacterial cells and mediate attachment to specific surfaces. Fimbriae have 
   been shown to be critical virulence factors in enteric bacteria and play multiple 
   roles in the course of infection. Salmonella infections are initiated by adherence 
   to intestinal epithelium using multiple fimbriae. Fimbriae involved in this 
   common step of Salmonella infections are found in all Salmonella serovars. Enteritidis 
   also produce a unique fimbriae encoded by the sef genes (Salmonella Enteritidis 
   fimbriae). SEF are not found in S. Typhimurium or more distantly related Salmonella 
   serovars, but all Enteritidis isolates express SEF fimbriae. Results implicated 
   SEF as a unique virulence factor for Enteritidis. Immunization of mice with 
   purified SEF protects mice from Enteritidis infection, indicating that SEF are 
   expressed in the host and elicit a strong immune response. Properties of these 
   fimbriae suggest that this may be a novel vaccine target. We showed that mutations 
   in sef reduce virulence of Enteritidis in mice by 10 4-fold and 10 5-fold. In 
   contrast, mutations in sef increase virulence in chickens, suggesting that these 
   fimbriae may play an important role in establishment of chronic, asymptomatic 
   infections in chickens. We have characterized Enteritidis infections in chickens 
   to develop a model system for subsequent characterization of disease. Our research 
   showed that day old Leghorn chicks are susceptible to Enteritidis infections 
   and a dose of 10 4-fold bacteria is lethal to young chicks. At lower doses, 
   Enteritidis colonizes the ceca, cloaca, liver, spleen and reproductive tissue 
   of chicks. Older chickens effectively clear the infection. Competition experiments 
   between the sefA mutant and wild-type Enteritidis confirm that loss of SEF results 
   in increased virulence in chickens. A simple explanation of these results may 
   be that SEF acts as an effective immunogen, stimulating an protective cell-mediated 
   immune response. This would enhance the clearance of the wild-type strain while 
   allowing a mutant lacking SEF to persist in higher numbers. This conclusion 
   is supported by previous studies indicating that SEF induces a strong T-lymphocyte 
   response. Why would SEF promote virulence in mice and decrease virulence in 
   chickens? In BALB/c mice, SEF promotes uptake of Enteritidis into macrophages 
   which may limit the direct exposure of this potential antigen to the host immune 
   system. These results imply that SEF may play different roles in the pathogenesis 
   of Enteritidis depending on the host. To test the effectiveness of SEF as a 
   vaccine, we developed methods to overproduce and purify SEF protein and we plan 
   to use this protein to immunize chickens. The immunized chickens will be subsequently 
   tested for protection against Enteritidis infections.</span></span></p>

 <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span
 style="color: #000000">IMPACT: 1998/08 TO 2000/07</span></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="color:
 #000000">Salmonella enteriditis infects a wide variety of animals, including chickens 
   and humans. enteriditis typically initiates an infection through the fecal oral 
   route where it colonizes the intestinal wall and causes diarrhea. In adult chickens 
   these infections are usually asymptomatic, but seemingly healthy chickens can 
   carry and shed enteriditis for long periods of time after the initial infection. 
   enteriditis can also colonize the developing egg in an otherwise asymptomatic 
   chicken, making enteriditis infections very insidious. Recently, the occurrence 
   of enteriditis infections in humans has increased dramatically, largely due 
   to the consumption of infected chicken eggs. Despite the impact of enteriditis 
   infections on agriculture and human health, the virulence determinants (i.e., 
   the mechanisms responsible for causing disease) that mediate the unique aspects 
   of enteriditis infections in chickens are poorly understood. Understanding the 
   unique virulence mechanisms of enteriditis may lead to new, better ways of preventing 
   infections in chickens and thereby alleviating this major source of food poisoning. 
   Although enteriditis is the principle causes of Salmonella food poisoning, most 
   research on Salmonella pathogenesis has focused on Salmonella Typhimurium. Work 
   in many labs is beginning to elucidate the Typhimurium virulence determinants. 
   Our work identified a virulence factor that is unique to Salmonella Enteritidis 
   which has potential for use as a cheap, effective vaccine for chickens.</span></span></p>

 <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',
 serif"><span style="color: #000000">1. What major problem or issue is being resolved 
   and how are you resolving it? The objectives of this research are: a) to improve 
   the diagnosis and identification of Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG) and Mycoplasma 
   synoviae (MS), b) to identify virulence factors that enable F strain MG to displace 
   S6 strain MG, c) to characterize the effects of the three currently available 
   live MG vaccines on egg production, egg and eggshell quality parameters, d) 
   to characterize the antibody responses of infected poultry to mycoplasma antigens 
   by using monoclonal antibodies and molecular techniques, and e) to evaluate 
   the impact of Mycoplasma infection in poultry. 2. How serious is the problem? 
   Why does it matter? Fully 80% of commercial egg laying chickens are believed 
   infected with Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG) which results in decreased egg production, 
   increased pharmaceutical costs, and mortality. MG infection of broiler breeders 
   is sporadic and results in either condemnation and slaughter of infected hens 
   and/or infection of progeny which in turn, results in increased mortality, feed 
   costs and slaughter house condemnation. "Backyard" flocks exist as primary reservoirs 
   of infection. Numerous other species of Mycoplasma have been found in commercial 
   poultry. Fully 20% of the approximately 125 known mycoplasmas can be found in 
   the class Aves and of these about one-half (12) are found in poultry. Of these 
   12, only four have been investigated to any depth. At least five of the 12 mycoplasmas 
   found in poultry can be isolated in commercial layer chickens. We do not know 
   the effect(s) of these other mycoplasmal species on poultry and, coupled with 
   the fact that mycoplasmal infections in poultry are not cleared with antibiotics 
   (once infected, a chicken remains infected for the duration of its life) mycoplasmal 
   infection presents a dread scenario for the poultry industry. 3. How does it 
   relate to the National Program(s) and National Component(s) to which it has 
   been assigned? This research is assigned to National Program 103 Animal Diseases. 
   It is appropriate for the sections on "pathogen detection," "epidemiology of 
   disease," and "disease prevention/control through vaccine and novel strategies." 
   4. What were the most significant accomplishments this past year? Although the 
   temperature sensitive (ts-11) live vaccine strain of MG has been available for 
   use in commercial layers for the past nine years, there has been NO information 
   available to the producer concerning the vaccines effects on egg production, 
   egg weight distribution, egg weight, blood/meat spot incidence, pimpling incidence, 
   Haugh unit determination and eggshell strength despite the fact that the vaccine 
   was developed to reduce egg production losses associated with MG infection. 
   The research included measuring, recording and analysis of the aforementioned 
   parameters together with hen mortality was conducted at the Mid South Area Poultry 
   Research Unit and involved collaborators from Mississippi State University's 
   College of Veterinary Medicine as well as from the Mid South Area Office of 
   the Director. We determined that the ts-11 MG vaccine does not detrimentally 
   affect any of the parameters measured when the hens are vaccinated at ten weeks 
   of age. The outcome of this research is that now egg producers can make an informed 
   decision regarding the use of this vaccine in their flocks. Most commercial 
   layer chickens are infected with MG and most of these chickens remain "on the 
   farm" for approximately 100 weeks of age; this becomes important when attempting 
   to eradicate MG from multi-age layer operations, particularly in view of the 
   fact that "the influence of age on resistance to disease has not been adequately 
   examined." Chickens were maintained in biological isolation units at the Mid 
   South Area Poultry Research Unit and chickens were infected at either 10 or 
   66 weeks of age whereupon recovery of the organism was attempted involving collaboration 
   from Mississippi State University's College of Veterinary Medicine. Organism 
   recovery data indicated that older infected hens are more efficient at suppressing 
   the replication of the organism than are hens infected at a younger age. The 
   ramification of this research impacts epidemiological investigations in that 
   it suggests that older infected hens do not shed (implying that transmission 
   to other hens is decreased) the organism as readily as younger infected hens. 
   Most commercial layers are infected with MG and remain "on the farm" through 
   100 weeks of age during which time they are molted at about 65 weeks of age. 
   Choanal cleft swabs were taken before and after molting during which time the 
   birds were maintained in biological isolation units at the Mid South Area's 
   Poultry Research Unit and involved collaboration from Mississippi State University's 
   College of Veterinary Medicine. Molting was shown to result in a decreased ability 
   to isolate MG from known infected chickens. This result has epidemiological 
   ramifications in that it suggests that confirmatory MG isolation tests may be 
   impaired when conducted on hens either in molt or immediately after molt. 5. 
   Describe the major accomplishments over the life of the project including their 
   predicted or actual impact. Major accomplishments over the life of the project 
   include: a) the finding that the chicken remains infected over its life and 
   that neither isolation nor disinfection of its environment will rid the chicken 
   of the organism, impact - unless you can depopulate an infected farm, you cannot 
   get rid of the organism from the flock, b) that the cellular profile of the 
   chicken's blood reflects an acute infection with mycoplasma; however, the cellular 
   blood profile of the chronically infected chicken is similar to control hens, 
   despite the fact that the organism can still be isolated from the chronically 
   infected hen, impact - the chicken's immune system is apparently "tricked" by 
   the organism into believing there is no need to continue mounting an immune 
   response, c) that the addition of the commonly used therapeutic agent ammonium 
   chloride in layer chickens hinders the bacteriological recovery of Mycoplasma 
   gallisepticum from chickens, impact - a diagnostician needs to know that a flock 
   is being treated with ammonium chloride when he is attempting to isolate the 
   organism and therefore take a greater number of swabs in order to assure the 
   organism's isolation when the flock is actually infected, d) that vaccination 
   of chickens at 10 weeks of age with the F strain of Mycoplasma gallisepticum 
   does not reduce egg production over a 44-week laying cycle, impact - since 1979, 
   flock managers have used the F strain of Mycoplasma gallisepticum with the understanding 
   that the vaccine reduces egg production by approximately 7 eggs/hen over a 45-week 
   laying cycle. 6. What do you expect to accomplish, year by year, over the next 
   3 years? In 2000, we expect to demonstrate the effects of an available live 
   MG vaccine (6/85) on egg production, egg size distribution, and egg and eggshell 
   quality parameters of layer chickens. Further, we expect to sequence the genetic 
   code and location of a putative gene associated with the ability of the MG organism 
   to adhere to a host cell (cytadhesin gene) thereby inciting infection of the 
   host. In 2001, we expect to investigate the effect of one of the most prevalent 
   Mycoplasma species (Mycoplasma gallinarum) found in commercial layer chickens 
   on egg production, egg size distribution, and egg and eggshell quality parameters. 
   Also, we expect to show the impact of MG infection on the lipoprotein content 
   of eggs and further, to evaluate the virulence of the cytadhesin gene sequenced 
   in 2000. In 2002, we expect to demonstrate the impact of Mycoplasma gallinaceum, 
   the second most prevalent Mycoplasma species found in commercial layer chickens, 
   on egg production, egg size distribution, and egg and eggshell quality parameters. 
   We also expect, contingent upon a determination of non-virulence in 2001, to 
   insert the cytadhesin gene sequenced in 2000 into Mycoplasma gallinarum to result 
   in the initiation of the development of a novel vaccine against MG. This novel 
   vaccine will be capable of preventing colonization by wild or field strains 
   of MG and will also result in enhanced interstate movement and export of commercial 
   poultry by not resulting in positive seroconversion for both MG and MS tests. 
   Finally, this vaccine should be more acceptable to the broiler and turkey industries 
   as it will be protective against MG and MS yet cause no pathology. 7. What science 
   and/or technologies have been transferred and to whom? When is the science and/or 
   technology likely to become available to the end user (industry, farmer, other 
   scientists)? What are the constraints if known, to the adoption &amp; durability 
   of the technology product? Information pertaining to the effect of ts-11 MG 
   vaccine on egg production, egg size distribution, Haugh unit measurement, egg 
   shell breaking strength, blood meat spot incidence, pimpling incidence, and 
   average egg weight has been made available to egg producers, veterinarians, 
   and diagnosticians. Similarly, information regarding both molting and age of 
   the chicken at the time of MG vaccination has been made available as it pertains 
   to these factors potential for hindrance to isolation of the MG organism. The 
   foregoing information is relevant immediately as approximately 80% of the commercial 
   layer chickens are either infected or vaccinated with MG. This technology has 
   been delivered to commercial layer managers via telephone call, reviewed journal 
   articles, and conference talks. The value will continue as long as this vaccine 
   is used in commercial layers. The only constraints to adoption of the technology 
   rest with the individual states and whether they permit use of the vaccine within

 style="color: #000000">OBJECTIVES: An understanding of the mechanism of Salmonella 
   adherence to chicken cells could be particularly valuable when developing strategies 
   to eliminate or reduce Salmonella colonization of poultry, and consequently, 
   the shedding of Salmonella in feces, its transmission to eggs, and the cross-contamination 
   of chicken carcasses which occurs during processing. The specific aims of this 
   proposal are: to identify the gene(s) encoding the iron-induced adhesin, to 
   evaluate the role of the iron-induced adhesin in the adherence of the Salmonella 
   to avian cells in culture, the colonization of the chicken intestine, and the 
   attachment of Salmonella to the surface of chicken carcasses and to determine 
   if the iron-induced adhesin is made by other serotypes of S. enterica which 
   colonize chickens.</span></span></p>

   be used to design an avirulent S. typhimurium vaccine strain which will express 
   the gene(s) encoding the Iia constitutely, and to evaluate its potential to 
   induce an immune response that would lessen the ability of S. typhimurium and 
   other serotypes to colonize the intestinal tract of chickens. The experiments 
   proposed involve using a variety of genetic and molecular biology techniques. 
   Mutants will be evaluated using tissue culture and animal models.</span></span></p>

 <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',
 serif"><span style="color: #000000">Our long-term objective is to reduce or eliminate 
   Salmonella colonization of poultry resulting in a reduction in the shedding 
   of Salmonella in feces, transmission to eggs and cross contamination which occurs 
   during processing. Toward this end, we initially constructed a S. typhimurium 
   strain possessing knockout mutations in the genes encoding type 1 fimbriae (Fim), 
   long polar fimbriale (Lpf), plasmid encoded fimbriale (Pef) and thin aggregative 
   fimbriae (Agf). A derivative of this strain was also generated but lacking the 
   ability to synthesize flagella, which can also serve as an adhesin. These strains 
   were constructed to facilitate better identification of mutants defective in 
   the expression of an iron-induced adhesin using TnphoA mutagenesis. Such a mutation, 
   iia-8::TnphoA was identified in a S. typhimurium strain with a phoP allele to 
   block synthesis of acid phosphatase which would then enable screening for strains 
   that could or could not express alkaline phosphatase encoded by the phoA gene 
   in the presence rather than in the absence of high iron concentrations. This 
   Iia-defective mutant adhered to tissue culture cells with only 5 to 10 percent 
   of the efficiency of wild-type cells under high iron conditions and with equal 
   but low efficiency under low iron conditions. Using genomic subtractive hybridization 
   and selective capture of transcribed sequences (SCOTS), we have identified another 
   unique fimbrial operon, termed stf, in the S. typhimurium genome flanking the 
   ferrochrome uptake operon. This stf fimbrial operon is similar to sequences 
   encoding a mannose- resistant fimbrial type in Proteus mirabilis. Although the 
   stf fimbrial operon is absent from the human pathogen S. typhi, it is present 
   in the genomes of broad host range serovars that are specifically adapted to 
   avian hosts. A lacZ reporter fusion was constructed, and studies demonstrated 
   that the stf fimbrial operon was not regulated by iron concentration or by other 
   environmental stimuli or stresses that affect expression of other fimbrial operons. 
   A mutant with constitutive expression of Stf fimbriae has been constructed as 
   well as a knockout mutant unable to synthesize Stf fimbriae. These mutants, 
   as well as those with combination of these mutations and those affecting synthesis 
   of other adhesins, including Iia fimbriae, will be evaluated for ability to 
   colonize day-of-hatch chicks and to cause disease. Future studies will explore 
   the potential effectiveness of the immune responses against these fimbrial adhesins 
   in blocking the ability of Salmonella of diverse serotypes to colonize the avian 
   intestinal track and thus to reduce the likelihood that the Salmonella will 
   be transmitted through the food chain to humans.</span></span></p>

 <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',

   two newly identified by our efforts, that permit Salmonella typhimurium strains

   Flagella can also facilitate adherence and contribute to colonization of the 
   avian intestinal tract. Using mutant strains with various constellations of 
   mutations, colonization of the intestinal tract and virulence can be reduced 
   significantly, if not eliminated. The results obtained permit us to postulate 
   that effective immune responses against the 7 adhesins would likely abolish 
   the ability of Salmonella strains to colonize the intestinal tract and be invasive 
   and thus reduce the likelihood for Salmonella transmission through the food 
   chain to humans.</span></span></p>

 style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="color:
 #000000">1. What major problem or issue is being resolved and how are you resolving 
   it? Induced molting is a prevalent procedure used by the layer industry to achieve 
   a second egg lay from aging flocks. It is estimated that 70% of the flocks nationwide 
   are molted. There are a variety of methods to induce a molt but taking the birds 
   off feed until they drop 25-30% body weight is the preferred method. Early studies 
   on molting showed that the effects of molting on a flock were primarily positive 
   but we showed that the procedure depressed the immune system of the birds and 
   dramatically exacerbated a Salmonella enteritidis (SE) infection. This increased 
   the chance for the production of eggs contaminated with SE and therefore presented 
   a food safety problem. Procedures need to be developed which will allow the 
   producers access to this important economic tool while, at the same time, not 
   putting the consuming public at risk for an SE infection. One procedure which 
   we examined was the use of alternative molt procedures in the place of chronic 
   feed removal to reduce or eliminate the exacerbated SE infection. We submitted 
   a grant which was funded by the U.S. Poultry and Egg Association to examine 
   the efficacy of using these alternative molt procedures to decrease or eliminate 
   the SE problem. 2. How serious is the problem? Why does it matter? A 70% prevalence 
   of molting means the procedure affects between 144-168 million hens annually 
   - a tremendous number of birds. It is estimated that approximately one third 
   of the egg industry's profits is derived from molted birds which means that 
   this is a very valuable industry tool. Successful completion of these studies 
   could mean that the egg industry could use this important procedure without 
   putting the consuming public at risk. The impact would therefore be dramatic. 
   3. How does it relate to the National Program(s) and National Component(s) to 
   which it has been assigned? National Program 103, Animal Health (25%) National 
   Program 108, Food Safety (75%) Food safety is a major component of the National 
   Program agenda and intervention strategies which help prevent the dissemination 
   of a human disease organism within flocks and block the entry of the organism 
   into the human food chain are important areas of investigation. 4. What were 
   the most significant accomplishments this past year? We wanted to see if feeding 
   the hens a nonnutritive filler such as soybean hulls, which would provide the 
   hens with bulk materials to keep the intestinal tract filled but yet provide 
   no nutrition and therefore put the hens into a egg-laying pause, would result 
   in a less severe intestinal infection compared with hens totally without feed. 
   We found that the use of soybean hulls had a minimal effect on the SE infection 
   at day 3 post challenge, compared with the fasted birds but there was a significant, 
   1000-fold SE decrease in the soybean hull group at day 10 post challenge, indicating 
   that use of a nonnutritive diet can affect the SE situation during a molt. In 
   a second group of experiments, we examined whether a shortened feed removal 
   period, 6 days, followed by 3 alternating periods of 3 days on feed/1 day off, 
   would result in lower intestinal SE levels compared with total feed withdrawal. 
   As was seen in the soybean hull experiment, no significant effects were observed 
   at day 3 post challenge but by day 10, there was a significantly lower number 
   of SE in the intestinal tract of the birds receiving the skip feed procedure 
   compared with the birds off feed for the entire time. These studies show that 
   there are molting strategies which will allow producers to recycle their birds 
   and not increase the risk of contaminated egg production. 5. Describe the major 
   accomplishments over the life of the project including their predicted or actual 
   impact. This CRADA has been going 0.5 years and question 4 is the data to date. 
   6. What do you expect to accomplish, year by year, over the next 3 years? This 
   grant terminates on March 31, 2000. 7. What science and/or technologies have 
   been transferred and to whom? When is the science and/or technology likely to

 <p><span
 style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="color:
 #000000">1. What major problem or issue is being resolved and how are you resolving 
   it? Despite the endeavors of researchers and public health agencies, the incidence 
   of human salmonellosis has continued to increase over the past 20 years. Salmonellosis 
   is now one of the most common food-borne causes of gastroenteritis. The number 
   of reported cases of human salmonellosis exceeds 40,000 per year. The CDC estimates 
   the true annual incidence of human salmonellosis in the US may be as high as 
   2 to 4 million cases/year. Animal food products are the principal source of 
   human infections. Traditional management of infectious diseases in poultry has 
   for the large part depended on the use of either broad-spectrum antibiotics 
   and/or vaccines. Inappropriate use of antibiotics and concerns of antibiotic 
   residues in meat causing microbial resistance in humans disease, has caused 
   a public outcry demanding the removal of many antibiotics from animal feed and 
   ultimately limiting future introduction of antibiotics for animal use. Vaccinations 
   have limitations, at least 7-10 days are required for the stimulation of the 
   acquired immune response for protection, and thus early protection for chicks 
   from diseases is attempted through maternal antibodies. We propose an alternative 
   immunological method for the control of infectious diseases, cytokine immunomodulation. 
   Using avian cytokines as natural enhancers of the functional activity of the 
   avian immune system results in direct protection against infectious diseases 
   and provides an adjuvant-like promotion to any vaccine administered. Additionally, 
   cytokines would be given during the first few days of life when the animals' 
   immune system is functionally immature. Cytokines induce a very rapid protective 
   response (within hours) which would last through this susceptible period of 
   life. 2. How serious is the problem? Why does it matter? More than 8 billion 
   broiler chickens are produced and commercially processed in the US each year. 
   Research has indicated that 35% or more of all processed poultry meat products 
   purchased by consumers may be contaminated by salmonellae. Because those Salmonella 
   serotypes most often associated with human illness do not cause serious disease 
   or grossly identifiable lesions in poultry, it has not been possible to eliminate 
   contaminated poultry carcasses by inspection procedures during processing. Induced 
   molting of laying hens is a common practice used by the US layer industry for 
   the continual productivity of aging hens. However, induced molting has been 
   linked to the decreased resistance and increased severity of Salmonella enteritidis 
   (SE) in these hens. In fact, table eggs have been shown to be major sources 
   of SE infections in humans with the risk of eggs becoming positive for SE contamination 
   increasing threefold in flocks molted within the previous 10 weeks. Since 60% 
   of the hens undergo a forced molt, approximately 200 million hens have an increased 
   risk to SE infection. Salmonellosis in swine has been estimated to cost swine 
   producers over $100 million dollars/year in losses. 3. How does it relate to 
   the National Program(s) and National Component(s) to which it has been assigned? 
   Food safety belongs to a cross cutting program area. A major research direction 
   in the Food Safety program (NP-108) is to decrease pathogenic bacteria. Targeted 
   microbes include Salmonella spp. There is a need to develop integrated strategies 
   for the prevention of Salmonella colonization and organ invasion in poultry 
   and swine. One such strategy is the modulation of the host immune system. Immunological 
   research on the control of intestinal and tissue colonization of poultry by 
   invasive Salmonella enteritidis (SE) has largely focused on the development 
   of live, attenuated vaccines. Regardless of the efficacy of a vaccine, at least 
   7-10 days are required for the stimulation of the acquired immune response for 
   protection. Unfortunately for the poultry industry, neonatal poultry are most 
   susceptible to Salmonella infections during the first 4 days post-hatch, after 
   which they become increasingly more resistant to infection. During this first 
   4 days post-hatch we hypothesized immunopotentiation of the innate defense mechanism(s) 
   would prevent Salmonella organ infectivity. 4. What were the most significant 
   accomplishments this past year? This year tests were undertaken to determine 
   the effects of induced molt on basal functional activities of heterophils from 
   aging hens. The results indicated that feed withdrawal to induce molt alters 
   the number and function of peripheral blood heterophils. This decreased efficiency 
   of heterophil functional activity appears to play a role in the increased susceptibility 
   of molting hens to Salmonella enteritidis infections. Preliminary investigations 
   conducted during the last year demonstrated that the oral administration of 
   Salmonella enteritidis-immune lymphokines (SILK) to hens 24 h before feed withdrawal 
   for molting will prevent SE infections in the hens. These results suggest that 
   SILK could become a commercial product for hens during induced molt that can 
   convey protection against Salmonella enteritidis infections. During the last 
   year, we conducted experiments that clearly showed that SILK delivered to day-old 
   turkey poults orally, intranasally, and subcutaneously is effective in protecting 
   the birds from SE infections. This protection is mediated by the activation 
   of peripheral blood heterophils. These results are significant because we have 
   now demonstrated in both chickens and turkeys multiple cost-effective industry 
   friendly delivery systems for SILK. We have also conducted experiments to evaluate 
   the effect of SILK on the incidence of horizontal transmission of S. arizonae 
   in turkey poults and S. gallinarum in broiler chickens. Our results demonstrated 
   that the immunoprophylactic administration of SILK to young turkey poults and 
   broiler chicks significantly reduces the horizontal transmission of Salmonella 
   in poultry. These results further suggest the possibility of using a non-vaccine 
   immunologically-based preventive strategy against Salmonella in poultry. We 
   also evaluated the effects of SILK on the phagocytic and bactericidal activities 
   of heterophils from chicks during the first 1-7 days of life. We demonstrated 
   that following the administration of SILK, the functional activities of heterophils 
   from 1-7 day-old birds is comparable to that of an immunologically mature (2-3 
   weeks of age) bird. Mechanistically, these functionally mature heterophils are 
   responsible for the protective inflammatory response, which protects the birds 
   from salmonellae infections. These data demonstrate that SILK augments the innate 
   host defenses in chicks during the greatest period of susceptibility to Salmonella 
   infections. We have also demonstrated that recombinant chicken interferon-gamma 
   (rChIFN-gamma) is capable of enhancing the functional activities of heterophils 
   from day-of-hatch chicks. These results demonstrate that the heterophils from 
   neonatal chicks possess the receptor for IFN-gamma; thus, this cytokine could 
   possibly be used either as an immunopotentiator for day-old chicks or as an 
   adjuvant for vaccines. We conducted studies to identify the specific protein 
   in SILK responsible for the protective effect in chickens. SILK was fractionated 
   by ammonium sulfate precipitation and the protective activity was recovered 
   in the 40- 60% ammonium sulfate saturation fraction. Monoclonal antibodies against 
   SILK were then linked to a solid matrix to form an immunoaffinity column over 
   which the 40-60% fraction was run. The recovered activity was then subjected 
   to size exclusion, ion exchange, and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. 
   Isolation of the SILK protein will enable us to clone the gene for this protein 
   that will be a useful tool for the development of economical and effective immunologically-based 
   treatments for the reduction of Salmonella in poultry products. 5. Describe 
   the major accomplishments over the life of the project including their predicted 
   or actual impact. Our laboratory has been evaluating the practicality of potentiating 
   the endogenous innate host defenses of poultry using immune and inflammatory 
   cytokines. Cytokines, chemical messengers secreted by various immune and non-immune 
   cells, are some of the most effective mediators of natural host defenses. Specifically, 
   we have found that the prophylactic administration of cytokines derived from 
   T cells (SILK) isolated from Salmonella enteritidis-immune chickens have a favorable 
   effect in controlling or eliminating salmonellosis in neonatal poultry and hens 
   undergoing induced molting. This resistance is associated with a dramatic peripheral 
   blood leukocytosis after the injection of the SILK followed by a marked infiltration 
   of bactericidal inflammatory heterophils in the lamina propria of the ceca. 
   Heterophils are highly phagocytic, polymorphonucleated white blood cells which 
   are important mediators of innate resistance in poultry; especially in young 
   birds that have not yet developed an acquired immune response. Under normal 
   conditions, invasion of the intestinal mucosa by Salmonella spp. initiates the 
   recruitment of heterophils to the lamina propria which control bacterial numbers 
   in the bird until the development of acquired immunity. Administration of SILK 
   into neonatal chicks induces a significant increase in the production and release 
   of heterophils into the peripheral blood and also augments the effector functions 
   of these phagocytes. Thus, salmonellae infections are not only controlled but 
   eliminated from chicks following the administration of SILK. Further studies 
   indicate that the delivery of SILK either in ovo at 18- days of embryogenesis 
   or orally and as an aerosol at hatch can be used by the poultry industry to 
   confer protection to chickens against a localized enteric SE organ invasion 
   by potentiating the systemic heterophilic innate response. 6. What do you expect 
   to accomplish, year by year, over the next 3 years? In FY-00, we hope to identify 
   and purify the effector cytokine(s) in SE- ILK and clone the gene for mass production. 
   We also hope to identify and clone genes for many avian cytokines for use in 
   the immunopotentiation of host immune responses in neonatal poultry. Genes for 
   interferon-gamma and the putative homologue of human IL- 8, 9E3/CEF4 have been 
   cloned in our laboratory and they will be evaluated for their protective abilities 
   in our Salmonella models. This CRIS will terminate in April FY-00. 7. What science 
   and/or technologies have been transferred and to whom? When is the science and/or 
   technology likely to become available to the end user (industry, farmer, other 
   scientists)? What are the constraints if known, to the adoption &amp; durability 
   of the technology product? SILK has been sent to scientists all over the world 
   for use in research in immunology enhancement of the avian and porcine immune 
   systems, as well as for evaluation in the prevention and control of various 
   viral, bacterial, and protozoal diseases of food animals. The main constraint 
   for the transfer of this technology is the purification and identification of 
   the effector molecules in the SILK. Once we can fully identify the components 
   of our SILK soup the pharmaceutical industry will license this material. In 
   addition, we have developed a CRADA with Cobb-Vantress Poultry Breeders to evaluate 
   the effect of SILK in commercial birds. 8. List your most important non-peer

 #000000">Salmonella Enteritidis is among the most virulent Salmonella Serotypes 
   in humans and animals. In the US. More than 25 percent of all cases of salmonellosis 
   in humans are associated with eating raw or undercooked eggs. In previous reports 
   we demonstrated that egg contamination may take place transovarially. Our recent 
   investigation targeted the virulence factors of Salmonella Enteritidis that 
   enable the organism to contaminate the preovulatory follicles of the laying 
   hen that leads to the contamination of laid eggs. We produced knockout mutants 
   of three phage types of Salmonella Enteritidis such that their flagellar expression 
   was suppressed. We studied the role of flagella in the in vitro attachment and 
   invasion of the avian ovary cells maintained in primary tissue culture. We found 
   that flagellar suppression was associated with the failure of the organism to 
   attach or invade the avian ovary cells compared to the parent or wild flagellated 
   strains. We also found that incubating the inoculated cells at 42C, which is 
   closer to the normal temperature of the avian species, enhanced flagellar expression. 
   These results may suggest the preference of hens by the salmonella organisms 
   as a major reservoir.</span></span></p>

 <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',
 serif"><span style="color: #000000">1. What major problem or issue is being resolved 
   and how are you resolving it? Induced molting is a prevalent procedure used 
   by the layer industry to achieve a second egg lay from aging flocks. It is estimated 
   that 70% of the flocks nationwide are molted. There are a variety of methods 
   to induce a molt but taking the birds off feed until they drop 25-30% body weight 
   is the preferred method. Early studies on molting showed that the effects of 
   molting on a flock were primarily positive but we showed that the procedure 
   depressed the immune system of the birds and dramatically exacerbated a Salmonella 
   enteritidis (SE) infection. This increased the chance for the production of 
   eggs contaminated with SE and therefore presented a food safety problem. Procedures 
   need to be developed which will allow the producers access to this important 
   economic tool while, at the same time, not putting the consuming public at risk 
   for an SE infection. One procedure which we examined was the use of antibiotics, 
   in combination with reconstituting the intestinal bacterial flora with competitive 
   exclusion cultures, to eliminate the SE problem. We established a CRADA with 
   Bayer Corporation, marketers of the fluoroquinolone antibiotic enrofloxacin 
   and a competitive exclusion culture , to examine the efficacy of treating with 
   these products to decrease or eliminate the SE problem 2. How serious is the 
   problem? Why does it matter? A 70% prevalence of molting means the procedure 
   affects between 144-168 million hens annually - a tremendous number of birds. 
   It is estimated that approximately one third of the egg industry's profits is 
   derived from molted birds which means that this is a very valuable industry 
   tool. Successful completion of these studies could mean that the egg industry 
   could use this important procedure without putting the consuming public at risk. 
   The impact would therefore be dramatic. 3. How does it relate to the National 
   Program(s) and National Component(s) to which it has been assigned? National 
   Program 103, Animal Health (25%) National Program 108, Food Safety (75%) Food 
   safety is a major component of the National Program agenda and intervention 
   strategies which help prevent the dissemination of a human disease organism 
   within flocks and block the entry of the organism into the human food chain 
   are important areas of investigation. 4. What were the most significant accomplishments 
   this past year? We wanted to see if treatment of molted infected birds with 
   antibiotics and competitive exclusion cultures would decrease the SE infection 
   after the molt. Birds were molted, infected with SE 4 days into the feed removal, 
   and then put back on feed after 14 days. They were put on a regimen of antibiotics 
   for 10 days followed by two days of competitive exclusion administration. We 
   showed that antibiotic treatment after the birds went back on feed reduced the 
   percentage of infected birds from 33% and 25% to 4% and 0% in experiments one 
   and two, respectively. The addition of the competitive exclusion cultures were 
   critical in the protection. These studies showed that there are intervention 
   strategies which will allow producers to molt their birds and not increase the 
   risk of contaminated egg production. 5. Describe the major accomplishments over

   used will be specific pathogen free (SPF) leghorn type. These birds will be 
   hatched and reared at our facility designed for maintaining SPF status. The 
   SC-54 modified live vaccine will be supplied by a commercial laboratory and 
   used at 10/8 CFUs/chick administered intranasally. A nalidixic acid resistant 
   strain of Salmonella enteritidis will be used at a challenge dosage of 10/8 
   CFUs per bird. Four groups of birds will be used as follows: 1) unvaccinated, 
   unchallenged; 2) unvaccinated, challenged; 3) vaccinated, unchallenged; 4) vaccinated, 
   challenged. Day-old birds will be intranasally vaccinated with SC-54 and will 
   be challenged at 2 weeks of age. Birds will be monitored daily for the presence 
   of clinical signs of disease. At 8 to 10 days following inoculation birds will 
   be euthanized, data and samples will be collected for evaluation. Parameters 
   of evaluation include 1) number of salmonella (CFUs) per gram of cecal content, 
   2) clinical signs and/or lesions of disease, 3) body weights, 4) serologic antibody 
   to pullorum antigen (plate test), 5) organ cultures of liver and spleen will 
   be done.</span></span></p>

   ANIMALS</span></span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style="font-family:
 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="color: #000000">OBJECTIVES: Identify internal 
   states of animal cognition and learning. Establish objective indicators of well-being 
   (behavioral, immunological, neuroendocrinological and molecular). Determine 
   how well-being in food producing animals relates to behavior, health and production 
   efficiencies.</span></span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style="font-family: 'Times
 New Roman', serif"><span style="color: #000000">APPROACH: Develop physiological 
   measures as indicators of stress and well-being including immune and neuroendocrine 
   responses as well as alterations in gene products in food producing animals. 
   Measure behavior and learning in livestock to identify animal interactions with 
   the production environment and identify conditions that both cause and alleviate 
   stress. Combine physiological and behavioral measures to define cause and effect 
   relationships between well-being and production efficiency in food animals.</span></span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New
 Roman', serif"><span style="color: #000000">PROGRESS: 1999/01 TO 1999/09</span></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',
 serif"><span style="color: #000000">1. What major problem or issue is being resolved 
   and how are you resolving it? Determination of objective indicators of animal 
   cognition and well-being in food producing animals. We have developed a team 
   consisting of expertise in ethology, immunology and neuroscience combined with 
   highly skilled technicians to ensure a multidisciplinary approach to answering 
   complex whole-animal questions. 2. How serious is the problem? Why does it matter? 
   Animal welfare is an international issue and consumers of food products in this 
   country are beginning to demand to know how the animals are raised and cared 
   for in production systems. If information on the well- being of food-producing 
   animals is not provided by scientifically assessing the animal's welfare, then 
   emotional, subjective opinions will be used to provide this information to the 
   consumer. This will in turn, be harmful to the American Producer with no scientific 
   evidence to support or contradict the opinions. Ultimately, the market for U.S. 
   livestock products will be affected both locally and internationally. 3. How 
   does it relate to the National Program(s) and National Component(s) to which 
   it has been assigned? This project is in direct concurrence with National Program 
   105. All of the research conducted in this project directly addresses the "Animal 
   Stress and Well-Being, 105" National Program. 4. What were the most significant 
   accomplishments this past year? As this project progresses, advances in determining 
   indicators of well- being are being made in the species studied. Behavioral 
   and immunological data continue to show advantages to all tail-banding first 
   calf heifers over young calves. Calves show higher levels of agitative behaviors 
   and elevations in acute phase proteins (liver proteins released in response 
   to tissue trauma) if docked in close proximity to banding date. Additionally, 
   a new study has shown improvements in immunological &amp; productivity measures 
   when first-calf heifers are exposed to a pre-milking experience prior to calving. 
   The implications of this study suggest that gradual habituation of the animal 
   to a management procedure, such as milking, improves the well-being of the animal. 
   Further progress was also made with the different genetic lines of pigs selected 
   for lean gain. The most significant accomplishment in this area of research 
   was to combine the genetic lines with a transportation stressor. Results indicated 
   that pigs selected for lean growth show significantly higher levels of aggressive 
   activity when mixed during transportation. These data compliment the previous 
   data describing greater handling problems in these pigs selected for lean growth. 
   Salivary stress hormones, although significantly elevated due to transportation 
   stress, were not higher in pigs selected for lean gain over other genotypes. 
   Furthermore, genotype did not affect the meat quality scores after transportation. 
   Finally, significant progress was made in the area of cognition work this year. 
   It was shown that piglets are capable of perceiving and remembering olfactory 
   and gustatory cues presented in their prenatal environment, affecting postnatal 
   behavior. By adding volatile compounds to diets during gestation, it may be 
   possible to increase feed consumption and reduce stress at weaning. 5. Describe 
   the major accomplishments over the life of the project including their predicted 
   or actual impact. The major accomplishment over the life of this project is 
   the building of an interdisciplinary team to address complex questions about 
   animal welfare across three species, dairy, swine and poultry. To combine neuroscience, 
   immunology, and ethology in comprehensive approaches to answering animal welfare 
   questions is very difficult. We have made significant progress in this area. 
   Furthermore, we have built teams with scientists at Purdue University to incorporate 
   genetics, nutrition and production to strengthen our approach to welfare questions. 
   This is an essential component to the success of this project. 6. What do you 
   expect to accomplish, year by year, over the next 3 years? Year 1: Addition 
   of 2 new scientists to expand our interdisciplinary team. One neuroscientist 
   with expertise in gross morphology/structure/function, and one new post-doctoral 
   scientist to focus in the area of neuroethology (relationship between the brain 
   and behavior)in dairy, swine and poultry. These two people will establish a 
   quantifiable link between management systems and animal welfare by incorporating 
   the role of the brain into new and ongoing projects in our unit. Year 2: Both 
   the first and second year will also determine both chronic and/or acute 'pain', 
   associated with common industry practices (beak trimming, induced molting, tail 
   docking)in conjunction with the expression/lack of expression of behavior in 
   these animals. There is a politically sensitive concern between forced molting 
   and food safety (Salmonella enteritidis) currently under discussion in the U.S. 
   Year 2 and 3 will try to connect this information with animal welfare (neuroscience, 
   stress physiology, immunology and behavior). Year 3: We should have a full-team 
   of scientists hired into our unit at this point. This will include: 2 ethologist 
   (one of whom will address food safety concerns in connection with behavior), 
   1 immunologist, 1 neuroscientist (1 neuroethologist, postdoc), 1 animal scientist, 
   and possibly a gut microbiologist. This unit should be up to full-speed by year 
   3 with a significant scientific contribution to the area of animal welfare science. 
   7. What science and/or technologies have been transferred and to whom? When 
   is the science and/or technology likely to become available to the end user 
   (industry, farmer, other scientists)? What are the constraints if known, to 
   the adoption &amp; durability of the technology product? Data from three research 
   projects on tail docking in dairy cattle were summarized in a letter published 
   in Hoard's Dairyman (May 25, 1999, Vol. 144 #10, p. 390). Currently being disseminated 
   to the dairy industry, are results from a study using pre-milking in dairy heifers 
   to decrease the stress of first milking in first-calf heifers. This information 
   has been shared with and presented by Purdue Dairy Extension Specialists to 
   producers in Indiana. One of our ARS scientists will present this information 
   in an invited seminar at the University College Dublin, Animal Science and Production 
   Department in September, 1999. A primer for the porcine IL-1 receptor antagonist 
   was developed and will be listed as available for other scientists as earlier 
   as October, 1999. This work will permit us to look at the microenvironment of 
   the pig for early cell signals in response to stressors (environmental, physiological, 
   social). The receptor antagonist modulates the early response of cytokines to 
   stress. 8. List your most important non-peer reviewed publications and presentations

   of hens during the molt fast reflected conservation of bodily reserves rather 
   than debilitation. A small increase in aggression occurred on the first day 
   of feed withdrawal. Increased attentiveness and stimulus generalization in foraging 
   behavioral patterns was evident on the second day of feed withdrawal. Afterward, 
   hens appeared to adjust expectations in regard to feeding opportunity although 
   behavior associated with foraging and feeding did not disappear entirely. Hens 
   which experienced feed withdrawal had significantly better survival during the 
   second production cycle than did control hens. Preparations are being made to 
   develop the next phase, which will involve investigation of the variation of 
   motivational strengths in relation to hunger. This research will shed light 
   on changes in a hen's cognitive status during feed withdrawal and determine 
   if the potential for a hen to suffer during feed deprivation reaches a steady 
   state or increases continuously with time off feed.</span></span></p>

 <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',
 serif"><span style="color: #000000">1. What major problem or issue is being resolved 
   and how are you resolving it? Vaccines made from killed cells have been made 
   by industry for years as aids to prevent colonization and organ invasion by 
   Salmonella enteritidis and other salmonellae. However, these products lack the 
   level of efficacy (greater than 90% protection) that is the usual hallmark of 
   a highly successful vaccine. We believe that partial protection by vaccines 
   can in some cases perpetuate problems with infection by this organism rather 
   than solve them. Our research indicates current products do not provide a high 
   degree of protection against S. enteritidis, possibly because new information 
   about subpopulation biology is not incorporated into current methods for preparing 
   vaccines. The research of many investigators already indicates that Salmonella 
   isolates vary in their ability to survive in the environment, to colonize the 
   intestinal tract, to invade the mucosa, to gain access to internal organs via 
   the lymphatic or circulatory systems, and to survive intracellularly. Indeed, 
   mutations introduced into Salmonella produces defined strains that target one 
   niche versus another, but do not complete a cycle of pathogenesis because an 
   essential ability to undergo change has been deleted. At SEPRL, scientists have 
   concentrated on understanding what characteristics enable Salmonella enteritidis 
   to be so invasive that eggs become routinely contaminated with this pathogen. 
   Contamination of eggs is the final outcome of infection in hens that affects 
   the food safety, because eggs are the most important source of S. enteritidis 
   for people. Research at SEPRL indicates that the ability of S.enteritidis to 
   contaminate eggs can be tracked by following the structure of the predominant 
   outer membrane molecule lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and indeed, some strains produce 
   a structure much like that of S. typhi, the causative agent of typhoid fever. 
   This phenomena is known as LPS O-chain phase variation. The importance of this 
   phenomena to manufacturers of vaccines is that production of immunogenic cell-surface 
   proteins change in coordination with changes in LPS O-chain structure. In addition, 
   S. enteritidis appears to be able to produce S. typhi-like LPS while it grows 
   to very high cell densities. Because these biological capabilities are so remarkable, 
   scientists at SEPRL have developed special strains and methods to improve second 
   generation bacterins intended to aid in the prevention of egg contamination 
   specifically and organ invasion by any salmonellae in general. 2. How serious 
   is the problem? Why does it matter? Salmonella enteritidis has emerged within 
   the last fifteen years to become the leading cause of salmonellosis around the 
   world, with overall incidence of human illness increased from 5 to 40 fold depending 
   upon the country. The most frequently identified food source for this pathogen 
   is the hen's egg, and wherever isolation of this organism from eggs has increased, 
   so has human salmonellosis. While the United States does not yet have a problem 
   of epidemic proportions, with risk of consuming a contaminated egg estimated 
   at about 1 in 5,000 to 10,000 eggs consumed, the European problem is at least 
   10 times worse, with risk of eating a contaminated egg estimated at between 
   1 in 100 (Germany) to 1 in 700 eggs consumed (United Kingdom). Since incidence 
   of infection with S. enteritidis in Central America, South America and Pacific 
   Rim countries is also estimated to be much worse than within the USA, the potential 
   for eggs produced in this country to become contaminated at epidemic levels 
   is ever present. Infection of people by S. enteritidis is indeed a serious problem 
   for USDA due to its association with poultry. 3. How does it relate to the National 
   Program(s) and National Component(s) to which it has been assigned? This research 
   allowed scientists to develop novel methods for increasing the efficacy of bacterins 
   against Salmonella enteritidis. This project ended 9/30/98. 4. What were the 
   most significant accomplishments this past year? A patent award was received 
   on a special medium and associated intellectual property that describes enhanced 
   recovery of proteins from Salmonella enteritidis that produces Typhi-like lipopolysaccharide. 
   This patented medium in general supports high cell density growth and cellular 
   differentiation of the salmonellae. 5. Describe the major accomplishments over 
   the life of the project including their predicted or actual impact? . The actual 
   impact of this research is that it broadens our knowledge about how Salmonella 
   enteritidis became a world wide problem. The predicted impact is that the information 
   can be used to understand how sustained epidemics (greater than 10 years) due 
   to bacterial pathogens come into existence. Specific accomplishments are as 
   follows: 1) A strain of Salmonella enteritidis was developed that efficiently 
   contaminates eggs and that greatly improved our ability to assess the efficacy 
   of vaccines, both killed and modified live products. This new strain produces 
   a plethora of cell-surface proteins and grows to cell densities two logs higher 
   than the parent strain. Surprisingly, use of this strain in animals also indicated 
   that parenteral adaptation is required to achieve efficient egg contamination. 
   This finding confirmed previous results that indicated an orally invasive phenotype 
   was required to be mixed with parenterally adapted phenotypes in order to achieve 
   egg contamination following oral infection. 2) Collaboration with Dr. A.C. Matin 
   of Stanford University helped expose yet another problem associated with production 
   of bacterins. Dr. Matin grew a wildtype attenuated strain of Salmonella enteritidis 
   in continuous culture, but found he could get good protein production only in 
   diluted medium. Since economical production of bacterins requires growth of 
   bacteria to high cell yields, this collaboration confirmed that SE-HCD, which 
   can produce lots of cell-surface proteins at high-cell-densities in rich broth, 
   was a crucial development. Dr. Matin has been asked for a final report on this 
   collaborative research, which is still pending. 3) At least 3 manuscripts were 
   published that described findings from these studies as they were pursued for 
   their relevance to general objectives of CRIS 6612-32000-017. One of these papers 
   describes the intellectual property associated with the patented medium. Two 
   others describe the recovery from farms of invasive Enteritidis that grows to 
   high cell density and the unique growth properties of a genetically modified 
   strain of Salmonella enteritidis that grows to high-cell-density (SE-HCD). 4) 
   Use of the patented growth medium revealed that serotyping can be used to do 
   more than just name salmonellae according to the LPS O-chain and flagellar antigens 
   they produce. It appears that the patented medium produces unexpected changes 
   in serotype that can be used to assess invasive potential and important aspects 
   of epidemiology. 5) The patented medium also detects metabolites present in 
   hen houses that can cause cells to undergo differentiation into potentially 
   more invasive forms. New lines of research with relevance to major CRIS objectives 
   are originating from this use. 6. What do you expect to accomplish, year by 
   year, over the next 3 years? This proj. has ended. However, we are now in a 
   new stage of applying these findings. We will be growing SE-HCD in continuous 
   culture to begin defining the exact conditions for maximizing both cell-surface 
   protein and cell yields. These two factors are crucial to producing pilot vaccines 
   with enhanced efficacy that can be produced en masse. 7. What science and/or 
   technologies have been transferred and to whom? When is the science and/or technology 
   likely to become available to the end user (industry, farmer, other scientists)? 
   What are the constraints if known, to the adoption &amp; durability of the technology 
   product? The patented medium is now available for non-exclusive licensing. The 
   technology is available now. One major constraint to the adoption of the technology 
   is a lack of understanding of the new information and how it addresses practical 
   issues. Another major constraint is that this research has been dependent upon 
   the efforts of one scientist who has no authority to scientific support staff 
   to build upon this research. To educate USDA staff and other scientists about 
   the impact this new information could have on issues of food safety, ARS News 
   is planning an article on how bacterial cells communicate when they grow to 
   high cell density, how high cell density growth changes gene regulation, and 
   how novel research conducted at SEPRL provides the first clear evidence that 
   these factors are important to improving food safety. 8. List your most important

 <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',
 serif"><span style="color: #000000">Vaccination of poultry against various infectious 
   disease etiologies using parenteral routes is cumbersome and costly because 
   it involves handling the birds during the vaccination process. This can be associated 
   with significant stress which may compromise the immune status of the birds. 
   We have started the evaluation of the Alginate hydrogels as carrier particles 
   for Salmonella enteritidis proteins that may offer protection to the hens against 
   natural infection with these organisms. We evaluated several lectins from: Arachis 
   hypogea, Conavalia ensiformis, Lens culinaris, Ricinus communus, Triticum esculentum 
   (wheat germ lectin) and Triticum vulgaris. These lectins were conjugated with 
   Fluoresin isothiocyanate before oral administration into the White Leghorn hens. 
   Results of these experiment suggested that there are specific pattern of attachment 
   and engulfemnet of these lectins by the different parts of the alimentary tract 
   of the hens. These results suggested the heterogenous composition of the villus 
   epithelium of the alimentary tract in chickens. Wheat germ lectin was found 
   to be the best stimulant when used to coat the Hydrogel particles uptake by 
   the intestinal and liver and spleen tissues of the hens. The mean diameter of 
   less that 5 microns appeared to be optimal in the tissue uptake of these microspheres.</span></span></p>

   identified two MHC-congenic lines of White Leghorn chickens that respond differentially 
   to an oral challenge with S. enteritidis. The project will examine the role 
   of the immune response in this differential susceptibility in 2 day old and 
   5 day old chicks from these lines. The study will also determine the effect 
   of the MHC locus differences on the shed of S. enteritidis into the eggs of 
   adult laying hens from these two lines of chickens, and the involvement of the 
   immune response in that shed. Therefore, the objectives of this project are 
   to: (1) define immune cell populations that respond to S. enteritidis infection 
   of neonatal chicks from the MHC-congenic lines, G-B1 and G-B2. (2) Compare S. 
   enteritidis tissue colonization and shed into the eggs between the adult G-B1

   immune cell populations responding to S. enteritidis challenge will be compared 
   with the specificities of immune cell populations in naive chickens by flow 
   cytometric analysis after staining isolated lymphoid cells with avian immune-cell-specific 
   monoclonal antibodies. Tissue samples will be taken 24, 72, 120 and 144 hours

   for S. enteritidis isolation of tissues from the liver, spleen, intestine, ovary 
   and oviduct, including eggs both pre-and post-oviposition, from infected and 
   un-infected adult G-B1 and G-B2 laying hens. Objective 3 will utilize adult 
   G-B1 and G-B2 laying hens, who will be inoculated with S. enteritidis at 24 
   weeks of age to compare immune cell populations that may relate to a differential 
   shed of the pathogen into eggs. The same methods as described under objective 
   1 will be employed except the immune cell populations will also be identified

   days prior to trt application, photoperiod was increased from 18L:6D to 24L:OD. 
   Photoperiod was reduced to 17L:7D at trt initiation and was maintained at this 
   level for the duration of the study. During the molt period, ZN trt proved inhibitory 
   to feed consumption. No differences between FW and ZN trt of the same length 
   were noted for days to pause, number of shell-less eggs or time to 50% production. 
   Increasing length of molt trt increased hen weight loss and days to 50% production. 
   Cumulative feed consumption per hen (36 wk post trt) was affected in a like 
   manner. Hen weight at the end of the study was the same. No differences in cumulative 
   production indices were found (egg production, egg weight, egg specific gravity, 
   and feed efficiency) although initial trt effects were noted.</span></span></p>
