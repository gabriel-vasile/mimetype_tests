    CHAPTER 20 - ELECTIVE FRANCHISE
    SUBCHAPTER I - GENERALLY

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1971. Voting rights

-STATUTE-
    (a) Race, color, or previous condition not to affect right to vote;
      uniform standards for voting qualifications; errors or omissions
      from papers; literacy tests; agreements between Attorney General
      and State or local authorities; definitions
      (1) All citizens of the United States who are otherwise qualified
    by law to vote at any election by the people in any State,
    Territory, district, county, city, parish, township, school
    district, municipality, or other territorial subdivision, shall be
    entitled and allowed to vote at all such elections, without
    distinction of race, color, or previous condition of servitude; any
    constitution, law, custom, usage, or regulation of any State or
    Territory, or by or under its authority, to the contrary
    notwithstanding.
      (2) No person acting under color of law shall - 
        (A) in determining whether any individual is qualified under
      State law or laws to vote in any election, apply any standard,
      practice, or procedure different from the standards, practices,
      or procedures applied under such law or laws to other individuals
      within the same county, parish, or similar political subdivision
      who have been found by State officials to be qualified to vote;
        (B) deny the right of any individual to vote in any election
      because of an error or omission on any record or paper relating
      to any application, registration, or other act requisite to
      voting, if such error or omission is not material in determining
      whether such individual is qualified under State law to vote in
      such election; or
        (C) employ any literacy test as a qualification for voting in
      any election unless (i) such test is administered to each
      individual and is conducted wholly in writing, and (ii) a
      certified copy of the test and of the answers given by the
      individual is furnished to him within twenty-five days of the
      submission of his request made within the period of time during
      which records and papers are required to be retained and
      preserved pursuant to title III of the Civil Rights Act of 1960
      [42 U.S.C. 1974 et seq.]: Provided, however, That the Attorney
      General may enter into agreements with appropriate State or local
      authorities that preparation, conduct, and maintenance of such
      tests in accordance with the provisions of applicable State or
      local law, including such special provisions as are necessary in
      the preparation, conduct, and maintenance of such tests for
      persons who are blind or otherwise physically handicapped, meet
      the purposes of this subparagraph and constitute compliance
      therewith.

      (3) For purposes of this subsection - 
        (A) the term "vote" shall have the same meaning as in
      subsection (e) of this section;
        (B) the phrase "literacy test" includes any test of the ability
      to read, write, understand, or interpret any matter.
    (b) Intimidation, threats, or coercion
      No person, whether acting under color of law or otherwise, shall
    intimidate, threaten, coerce, or attempt to intimidate, threaten,
    or coerce any other person for the purpose of interfering with the
    right of such other person to vote or to vote as he may choose, or
    of causing such other person to vote for, or not to vote for, any
    candidate for the office of President, Vice President, presidential
    elector, Member of the Senate, or Member of the House of
    Representatives, Delegates or Commissioners from the Territories or
    possessions, at any general, special, or primary election held
    solely or in part for the purpose of selecting or electing any such
    candidate.
    (c) Preventive relief; injunction; rebuttable literacy presumption;
      liability of United States for costs; State as party defendant
      Whenever any person has engaged or there are reasonable grounds
    to believe that any person is about to engage in any act or
    practice which would deprive any other person of any right or
    privilege secured by subsection (a) or (b) of this section, the
    Attorney General may institute for the United States, or in the
    name of the United States, a civil action or other proper
    proceeding for preventive relief, including an application for a
    permanent or temporary injunction, restraining order, or other
    order. If in any such proceeding literacy is a relevant fact there
    shall be a rebuttable presumption that any person who has not been
    adjudged an incompetent and who has completed the sixth grade in a
    public school in, or a private school accredited by, any State or
    territory, the District of Columbia, or the Commonwealth of Puerto
    Rico where instruction is carried on predominantly in the English
    language, possesses sufficient literacy, comprehension, and
    intelligence to vote in any election. In any proceeding hereunder
    the United States shall be liable for costs the same as a private
    person. Whenever, in a proceeding instituted under this subsection
    any official of a State or subdivision thereof is alleged to have
    committed any act or practice constituting a deprivation of any
    right or privilege secured by subsection (a) of this section, the
    act or practice shall also be deemed that of the State and the
    State may be joined as a party defendant and, if, prior to the
    institution of such proceeding, such official has resigned or has
    been relieved of his office and no successor has assumed such
    office, the proceeding may be instituted against the State.
    (d) Jurisdiction; exhaustion of other remedies
      The district courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction
    of proceedings instituted pursuant to this section and shall
    exercise the same without regard to whether the party aggrieved
    shall have exhausted any administrative or other remedies that may
    be provided by law.
    (e) Order qualifying person to vote; application; hearing; voting
      referees; transmittal of report and order; certificate of
      qualification; definitions
      In any proceeding instituted pursuant to subsection (c) of this
    section in the event the court finds that any person has been
    deprived on account of race or color of any right or privilege
    secured by subsection (a) of this section, the court shall upon
    request of the Attorney General and after each party has been given
    notice and the opportunity to be heard make a finding whether such
    deprivation was or is pursuant to a pattern or practice. If the
    court finds such pattern or practice, any person of such race or
    color resident within the affected area shall, for one year and
    thereafter until the court subsequently finds that such pattern or
    practice has ceased, be entitled, upon his application therefor, to
    an order declaring him qualified to vote, upon proof that at any
    election or elections (1) he is qualified under State law to vote,
    and (2) he has since such finding by the court been (a) deprived of
    or denied under color of law the opportunity to register to vote or
    otherwise to qualify to vote, or (b) found not qualified to vote by
    any person acting under color of law. Such order shall be effective
    as to any election held within the longest period for which such
    applicant could have been registered or otherwise qualified under
    State law at which the applicant's qualifications would under State
    law entitle him to vote.
      Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of State law or the
    action of any State officer or court, an applicant so declared
    qualified to vote shall be permitted to vote in any such election.
    The Attorney General shall cause to be transmitted certified copies
    of such order to the appropriate election officers. The refusal by
    any such officer with notice of such order to permit any person so
    declared qualified to vote to vote at an appropriate election shall
    constitute contempt of court.
      An application for an order pursuant to this subsection shall be
    heard within ten days, and the execution of any order disposing of
    such application shall not be stayed if the effect of such stay
    would be to delay the effectiveness of the order beyond the date of
    any election at which the applicant would otherwise be enabled to
    vote.
      The court may appoint one or more persons who are qualified
    voters in the judicial district, to be known as voting referees,
    who shall subscribe to the oath of office required by section 3331
    of title 5, to serve for such period as the court shall determine,
    to receive such applications and to take evidence and report to the
    court findings as to whether or not at any election or elections
    (1) any such applicant is qualified under State law to vote, and
    (2) he has since the finding by the court heretofore specified been
    (a) deprived of or denied under color of law the opportunity to
    register to vote or otherwise to qualify to vote, or (b) found not
    qualified to vote by any person acting under color of law. In a
    proceeding before a voting referee, the applicant shall be heard ex
    parte at such times and places as the court shall direct. His
    statement under oath shall be prima facie evidence as to his age,
    residence, and his prior efforts to register or otherwise qualify
    to vote. Where proof of literacy or an understanding of other
    subjects is required by valid provisions of State law, the answer
    of the applicant, if written, shall be included in such report to
    the court; if oral, it shall be taken down stenographically and a
    transcription included in such report to the court.
      Upon receipt of such report, the court shall cause the Attorney
    General to transmit a copy thereof to the State attorney general
    and to each party to such proceeding together with an order to show
    cause within ten days, or such shorter time as the court may fix,
    why an order of the court should not be entered in accordance with
    such report. Upon the expiration of such period, such order shall
    be entered unless prior to that time there has been filed with the
    court and served upon all parties a statement of exceptions to such
    report. Exceptions as to matters of fact shall be considered only
    if supported by a duly verified copy of a public record or by
    affidavit of persons having personal knowledge of such facts or by
    statements or matters contained in such report; those relating to
    matters of law shall be supported by an appropriate memorandum of
    law. The issues of fact and law raised by such exceptions shall be
    determined by the court or, if the due and speedy administration of
    justice requires, they may be referred to the voting referee to
    determine in accordance with procedures prescribed by the court. A
    hearing as to an issue of fact shall be held only in the event that
    the proof in support of the exception disclose the existence of a
    genuine issue of material fact. The applicant's literacy and
    understanding of other subjects shall be determined solely on the
    basis of answers included in the report of the voting referee.
      The court, or at its direction the voting referee, shall issue to
    each applicant so declared qualified a certificate identifying the
    holder thereof as a person so qualified.
      Any voting referee appointed by the court pursuant to this
    subsection shall to the extent not inconsistent herewith have all
    the powers conferred upon a master by rule 53(c) of the Federal
    Rules of Civil Procedure. The compensation to be allowed to any
    persons appointed by the court pursuant to this subsection shall be
    fixed by the court and shall be payable by the United States.
      Applications pursuant to this subsection shall be determined
    expeditiously. In the case of any application filed twenty or more
    days prior to an election which is undetermined by the time of such
    election, the court shall issue an order authorizing the applicant
    to vote provisionally: Provided, however, That such applicant shall
    be qualified to vote under State law. In the case of an application
    filed within twenty days prior to an election, the court, in its
    discretion, may make such an order. In either case the order shall
    make appropriate provision for the impounding of the applicant's
    ballot pending determination of the application. The court may take
    any other action, and may authorize such referee or such other
    person as it may designate to take any other action, appropriate or
    necessary to carry out the provisions of this subsection and to
    enforce its decrees. This subsection shall in no way be construed
    as a limitation upon the existing powers of the court.
      When used in the subsection, the word "vote" includes all action
    necessary to make a vote effective including, but not limited to,
    registration or other action required by State law prerequisite to
    voting, casting a ballot, and having such ballot counted and
    included in the appropriate totals of votes cast with respect to
    candidates for public office and propositions for which votes are
    received in an election; the words "affected area" shall mean any
    subdivision of the State in which the laws of the State relating to
    voting are or have been to any extent administered by a person
    found in the proceeding to have violated subsection (a) of this
    section; and the words "qualified under State law" shall mean
    qualified according to the laws, customs, or usages of the State,
    and shall not, in any event, imply qualifications more stringent
    than those used by the persons found in the proceeding to have
    violated subsection (a) in qualifying persons other than those of
    the race or color against which the pattern or practice of
    discrimination was found to exist.
    (f) Contempt; assignment of counsel; witnesses
      Any person cited for an alleged contempt under this Act shall be
    allowed to make his full defense by counsel learned in the law; and
    the court before which he is cited or tried, or some judge thereof,
    shall immediately, upon his request, assign to him such counsel,
    not exceeding two, as he may desire, who shall have free access to
    him at all reasonable hours. He shall be allowed, in his defense to
    make any proof that he can produce by lawful witnesses, and shall
    have the like process of the court to compel his witnesses to
    appear at his trial or hearing, as is usually granted to compel
    witnesses to appear on behalf of the prosecution. If such person
    shall be found by the court to be financially unable to provide for
    such counsel, it shall be the duty of the court to provide such
    counsel.
    (g) Three-judge district court: hearing, determination, expedition
      of action, review by Supreme Court; single-judge district court:
      hearing, determination, expedition of action
      In any proceeding instituted by the United States in any district
    court of the United States under this section in which the Attorney
    General requests a finding of a pattern or practice of
    discrimination pursuant to subsection (e) of this section the
    Attorney General, at the time he files the complaint, or any
    defendant in the proceeding, within twenty days after service upon
    him of the complaint, may file with the clerk of such court a
    request that a court of three judges be convened to hear and
    determine the entire case. A copy of the request for a three-judge
    court shall be immediately furnished by such clerk to the chief
    judge of the circuit (or in his absence, the presiding circuit
    judge of the circuit) in which the case is pending. Upon receipt of
    the copy of such request it shall be the duty of the chief judge of
    the circuit or the presiding circuit judge, as the case may be, to
    designate immediately three judges in such circuit, of whom at
    least one shall be a circuit judge and another of whom shall be a
    district judge of the court in which the proceeding was instituted,
    to hear and determine such case, and it shall be the duty of the
    judges so designated to assign the case for hearing at the earliest
    practicable date, to participate in the hearing and determination
    thereof, and to cause the case to be in every way expedited. An
    appeal from the final judgment of such court will lie to the
    Supreme Court.
      In any proceeding brought under subsection (c) of this section to
    enforce subsection (b) of this section, or in the event neither the
    Attorney General nor any defendant files a request for a three-
    judge court in any proceeding authorized by this subsection, it
    shall be the duty of the chief judge of the district (or in his
    absence, the acting chief judge) in which the case is pending
    immediately to designate a judge in such district to hear and
    determine the case. In the event that no judge in the district is
    available to hear and determine the case, the chief judge of the
    district, or the acting chief judge, as the case may be, shall
    certify this fact to the chief judge of the circuit (or, in his
    absence, the acting chief judge) who shall then designate a
    district or circuit judge of the circuit to hear and determine the
    case.
      It shall be the duty of the judge designated pursuant to this
    section to assign the case for hearing at the earliest practicable
    date and to cause the case to be in every way expedited.

    Sec. 1973. Denial or abridgement of right to vote on account of
      race or color through voting qualifications or prerequisites;
      establishment of violation

-STATUTE-
      (a) No voting qualification or prerequisite to voting or
    standard, practice, or procedure shall be imposed or applied by any
    State or political subdivision in a manner which results in a
    denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of the United
    States to vote on account of race or color, or in contravention of
    the guarantees set forth in section 1973b(f)(2) of this title, as
    provided in subsection (b) of this section.
      (b) A violation of subsection (a) of this section is established
    if, based on the totality of circumstances, it is shown that the
    political processes leading to nomination or election in the State
    or political subdivision are not equally open to participation by
    members of a class of citizens protected by subsection (a) of this
    section in that its members have less opportunity than other
    members of the electorate to participate in the political process
    and to elect representatives of their choice. The extent to which
    members of a protected class have been elected to office in the
    State or political subdivision is one circumstance which may be
    considered: Provided, That nothing in this section establishes a
    right to have members of a protected class elected in numbers equal
    to their proportion in the population.

    Sec. 1973a. Proceeding to enforce the right to vote

-STATUTE-
    (a) Authorization by court for appointment of Federal examiners
      Whenever the Attorney General or an aggrieved person institutes a
    proceeding under any statute to enforce the voting guarantees of
    the fourteenth or fifteenth amendment in any State or political
    subdivision the court shall authorize the appointment of Federal
    examiners by the Director of the Office of Personnel Management in
    accordance with section 1973d of this title to serve for such
    period of time and for such political subdivisions as the court
    shall determine is appropriate to enforce the voting guarantees of
    the fourteenth or fifteenth amendment (1) as part of any
    interlocutory order if the court determines that the appointment of
    such examiners is necessary to enforce such voting guarantees or
    (2) as part of any final judgment if the court finds that
    violations of the fourteenth or fifteenth amendment justifying
    equitable relief have occurred in such State or subdivision:
    Provided, That the court need not authorize the appointment of
    examiners if any incidents of denial or abridgement of the right to
    vote on account of race or color, or in contravention of the voting
    guarantees set forth in section 1973b(f)(2) of this title (1) have
    been few in number and have been promptly and effectively corrected
    by State or local action, (2) the continuing effect of such
    incidents has been eliminated, and (3) there is no reasonable
    probability of their recurrence in the future.
    (b) Suspension of use of tests and devices which deny or abridge
      the right to vote
      If in a proceeding instituted by the Attorney General or an
    aggrieved person under any statute to enforce the voting guarantees
    of the fourteenth or fifteenth amendment in any State or political
    subdivision the court finds that a test or device has been used for
    the purpose or with the effect of denying or abridging the right of
    any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or
    color, or in contravention of the voting guarantees set forth in
    section 1973b(f)(2) of this title, it shall suspend the use of
    tests and devices in such State or political subdivisions as the
    court shall determine is appropriate and for such period as it
    deems necessary.
    (c) Retention of jurisdiction to prevent commencement of new
      devices to deny or abridge the right to vote
      If in any proceeding instituted by the Attorney General or an
    aggrieved person under any statute to enforce the voting guarantees
    of the fourteenth or fifteenth amendment in any State or political
    subdivision the court finds that violations of the fourteenth or
    fifteenth amendment justifying equitable relief have occurred
    within the territory of such State or political subdivision, the
    court, in addition to such relief as it may grant, shall retain
    jurisdiction for such period as it may deem appropriate and during
    such period no voting qualification or prerequisite to voting or
    standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting different
    from that in force or effect at the time the proceeding was
    commenced shall be enforced unless and until the court finds that
    such qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure
    does not have the purpose and will not have the effect of denying
    or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color, or in
    contravention of the voting guarantees set forth in section
    1973b(f)(2) of this title: Provided, That such qualification,
    prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure may be enforced if
    the qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure
    has been submitted by the chief legal officer or other appropriate
    official of such State or subdivision to the Attorney General and
    the Attorney General has not interposed an objection within sixty
    days after such submission, except that neither the court's finding
    nor the Attorney General's failure to object shall bar a subsequent
    action to enjoin enforcement of such qualification, prerequisite,
    standard, practice, or procedure.

    Sec. 1973b. Suspension of the use of tests or devices in
      determining eligibility to vote

-STATUTE-
    (a) Action by State or political subdivision for declaratory
      judgment of no denial or abridgement; three-judge district court;
      appeal to Supreme Court; retention of jurisdiction by three-judge
      court
      (1) To assure that the right of citizens of the United States to
    vote is not denied or abridged on account of race or color, no
    citizen shall be denied the right to vote in any Federal, State, or
    local election because of his failure to comply with any test or
    device in any State with respect to which the determinations have
    been made under the first two sentences of subsection (b) of this
    section or in any political subdivision of such State (as such
    subdivision existed on the date such determinations were made with
    respect to such State), though such determinations were not made
    with respect to such subdivision as a separate unit, or in any
    political subdivision with respect to which such determinations
    have been made as a separate unit, unless the United States
    District Court for the District of Columbia issues a declaratory
    judgment under this section. No citizen shall be denied the right
    to vote in any Federal, State, or local election because of his
    failure to comply with any test or device in any State with respect
    to which the determinations have been made under the third sentence
    of subsection (b) of this section or in any political subdivision
    of such State (as such subdivision existed on the date such
    determinations were made with respect to such State), though such
    determinations were not made with respect to such subdivision as a
    separate unit, or in any political subdivision with respect to
    which such determinations have been made as a separate unit, unless
    the United States District Court for the District of Columbia
    issues a declaratory judgment under this section. A declaratory
    judgment under this section shall issue only if such court
    determines that during the ten years preceding the filing of the
    action, and during the pendency of such action - 
        (A) no such test or device has been used within such State or
      political subdivision for the purpose or with the effect of
      denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or
      color or (in the case of a State or subdivision seeking a
      declaratory judgment under the second sentence of this
      subsection) in contravention of the guarantees of subsection
      (f)(2) of this section;
        (B) no final judgment of any court of the United States, other
      than the denial of declaratory judgment under this section, has
      determined that denials or abridgements of the right to vote on
      account of race or color have occurred anywhere in the territory
      of such State or political subdivision or (in the case of a State
      or subdivision seeking a declaratory judgment under the second
      sentence of this subsection) that denials or abridgements of the
      right to vote in contravention of the guarantees of subsection
      (f)(2) of this section have occurred anywhere in the territory of
      such State or subdivision and no consent decree, settlement, or
      agreement has been entered into resulting in any abandonment of a
      voting practice challenged on such grounds; and no declaratory
      judgment under this section shall be entered during the pendency
      of an action commenced before the filing of an action under this
      section and alleging such denials or abridgements of the right to
      vote;
        (C) no Federal examiners under subchapters I-A to I-C of this
      chapter have been assigned to such State or political
      subdivision;
        (D) such State or political subdivision and all governmental
      units within its territory have complied with section 1973c of
      this title, including compliance with the requirement that no
      change covered by section 1973c of this title has been enforced
      without preclearance under section 1973c of this title, and have
      repealed all changes covered by section 1973c of this title to
      which the Attorney General has successfully objected or as to
      which the United States District Court for the District of
      Columbia has denied a declaratory judgment;
        (E) the Attorney General has not interposed any objection (that
      has not been overturned by a final judgment of a court) and no
      declaratory judgment has been denied under section 1973c of this
      title, with respect to any submission by or on behalf of the
      plaintiff or any governmental unit within its territory under
      section 1973c of this title, and no such submissions or
      declaratory judgment actions are pending; and
        (F) such State or political subdivision and all governmental
      units within its territory - 
          (i) have eliminated voting procedures and methods of election
        which inhibit or dilute equal access to the electoral process;
          (ii) have engaged in constructive efforts to eliminate
        intimidation and harassment of persons exercising rights
        protected under subchapters I-A to I-C of this chapter; and
          (iii) have engaged in other constructive efforts, such as
        expanded opportunity for convenient registration and voting for
        every person of voting age and the appointment of minority
        persons as election officials throughout the jurisdiction and
        at all stages of the election and registration process.

      (2) To assist the court in determining whether to issue a
    declaratory judgment under this subsection, the plaintiff shall
    present evidence of minority participation, including evidence of
    the levels of minority group registration and voting, changes in
    such levels over time, and disparities between minority-group and
    non-minority-group participation.
      (3) No declaratory judgment shall issue under this subsection
    with respect to such State or political subdivision if such
    plaintiff and governmental units within its territory have, during
    the period beginning ten years before the date the judgment is
    issued, engaged in violations of any provision of the Constitution
    or laws of the United States or any State or political subdivision
    with respect to discrimination in voting on account of race or
    color or (in the case of a State or subdivision seeking a
    declaratory judgment under the second sentence of this subsection)
    in contravention of the guarantees of subsection (f)(2) of this
    section unless the plaintiff establishes that any such violations
    were trivial, were promptly corrected, and were not repeated.
      (4) The State or political subdivision bringing such action shall
    publicize the intended commencement and any proposed settlement of
    such action in the media serving such State or political
    subdivision and in appropriate United States post offices. Any
    aggrieved party may as of right intervene at any stage in such
    action.
      (5) An action pursuant to this subsection shall be heard and
    determined by a court of three judges in accordance with the
    provisions of section 2284 of title 28 and any appeal shall lie to
    the Supreme Court. The court shall retain jurisdiction of any
    action pursuant to this subsection for ten years after judgment and
    shall reopen the action upon motion of the Attorney General or any
    aggrieved person alleging that conduct has occurred which, had that
    conduct occurred during the ten-year periods referred to in this
    subsection, would have precluded the issuance of a declaratory
    judgment under this subsection. The court, upon such reopening,
    shall vacate the declaratory judgment issued under this section if,
    after the issuance of such declaratory judgment, a final judgment
    against the State or subdivision with respect to which such
    declaratory judgment was issued, or against any governmental unit
    within that State or subdivision, determines that denials or
    abridgements of the right to vote on account of race or color have
    occurred anywhere in the territory of such State or political
    subdivision or (in the case of a State or subdivision which sought
    a declaratory judgment under the second sentence of this
    subsection) that denials or abridgements of the right to vote in
    contravention of the guarantees of subsection (f)(2) of this
    section have occurred anywhere in the territory of such State or
    subdivision, or if, after the issuance of such declaratory
    judgment, a consent decree, settlement, or agreement has been
    entered into resulting in any abandonment of a voting practice
    challenged on such grounds.
      (6) If, after two years from the date of the filing of a
    declaratory judgment under this subsection, no date has been set
    for a hearing in such action, and that delay has not been the
    result of an avoidable delay on the part of counsel for any party,
    the chief judge of the United States District Court for the
    District of Columbia may request the Judicial Council for the
    Circuit of the District of Columbia to provide the necessary
    judicial resources to expedite any action filed under this section.
    If such resources are unavailable within the circuit, the chief
    judge shall file a certificate of necessity in accordance with
    section 292(d) of title 28.
      (7) The Congress shall reconsider the provisions of this section
    at the end of the fifteen-year period following the effective date
    of the amendments made by the Voting Rights Act Amendments of 1982.
      (8) The provisions of this section shall expire at the end of the
    twenty-five-year period following the effective date of the
    amendments made by the Voting Rights Act Amendments of 1982.
      (9) Nothing in this section shall prohibit the Attorney General
    from consenting to an entry of judgment if based upon a showing of
    objective and compelling evidence by the plaintiff, and upon
    investigation, he is satisfied that the State or political
    subdivision has complied with the requirements of subsection (a)(1)
    of this section. Any aggrieved party may as of right intervene at
    any stage in such action.
    (b) Required factual determinations necessary to allow suspension
      of compliance with tests and devices; publication in Federal
      Register
      The provisions of subsection (a) of this section shall apply in
    any State or in any political subdivision of a State which (1) the
    Attorney General determines maintained on November 1, 1964, any
    test or device, and with respect to which (2) the Director of the
    Census determines that less than 50 per centum of the persons of
    voting age residing therein were registered on November 1, 1964, or
    that less than 50 per centum of such persons voted in the
    presidential election of November 1964. On and after August 6,
    1970, in addition to any State or political subdivision of a State
    determined to be subject to subsection (a) of this section pursuant
    to the previous sentence, the provisions of subsection (a) of this
    section shall apply in any State or any political subdivision of a
    State which (i) the Attorney General determines maintained on
    November 1, 1968, any test or device, and with respect to which
    (ii) the Director of the Census determines that less than 50 per
    centum of the persons of voting age residing therein were
    registered on November 1, 1968, or that less than 50 per centum of
    such persons voted in the presidential election of November 1968.
    On and after August 6, 1975, in addition to any State or political
    subdivision of a State determined to be subject to subsection (a)
    of this section pursuant to the previous two sentences, the
    provisions of subsection (a) of this section shall apply in any
    State or any political subdivision of a State which (i) the
    Attorney General determines maintained on November 1, 1972, any
    test or device, and with respect to which (ii) the Director of the
    Census determines that less than 50 per centum of the citizens of
    voting age were registered on November 1, 1972, or that less than
    50 per centum of such persons voted in the Presidential election of
    November 1972.
      A determination or certification of the Attorney General or of
    the Director of the Census under this section or under section
    1973d or 1973k of this title shall not be reviewable in any court
    and shall be effective upon publication in the Federal Register.
    (c) "Test or device" defined
      The phrase "test or device" shall mean any requirement that a
    person as a prerequisite for voting or registration for voting (1)
    demonstrate the ability to read, write, understand, or interpret
    any matter, (2) demonstrate any educational achievement or his
    knowledge of any particular subject, (3) possess good moral
    character, or (4) prove his qualifications by the voucher of
    registered voters or members of any other class.
    (d) Required frequency, continuation and probable recurrence of
      incidents of denial or abridgement to constitute forbidden use of
      tests or devices
      For purposes of this section no State or political subdivision
    shall be determined to have engaged in the use of tests or devices
    for the purpose or with the effect of denying or abridging the
    right to vote on account of race or color, or in contravention of
    the guarantees set forth in subsection (f)(2) of this section if
    (1) incidents of such use have been few in number and have been
    promptly and effectively corrected by State or local action, (2)
    the continuing effect of such incidents has been eliminated, and
    (3) there is no reasonable probability of their recurrence in the
    future.
    (e) Completion of requisite grade level of education in American-
      flag schools in which the predominant classroom language was
      other than English
      (1) Congress hereby declares that to secure the rights under the
    fourteenth amendment of persons educated in American-flag schools
    in which the predominant classroom language was other than English,
    it is necessary to prohibit the States from conditioning the right
    to vote of such persons on ability to read, write, understand, or
    interpret any matter in the English language.
      (2) No person who demonstrates that he has successfully completed
    the sixth primary grade in a public school in, or a private school
    accredited by, any State or territory, the District of Columbia, or
    the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico in which the predominant classroom
    language was other than English, shall be denied the right to vote
    in any Federal, State, or local election because of his inability
    to read, write, understand, or interpret any matter in the English
    language, except that in States in which State law provides that a
    different level of education is presumptive of literacy, he shall
    demonstrate that he has successfully completed an equivalent level
    of education in a public school in, or a private school accredited
    by, any State or territory, the District of Columbia, or the
    Commonwealth of Puerto Rico in which the predominant classroom
    language was other than English.
    (f) Congressional findings of voting discrimination against
      language minorities; prohibition of English-only elections; other
      remedial measures
      (1) The Congress finds that voting discrimination against
    citizens of language minorities is pervasive and national in scope.
    Such minority citizens are from environments in which the dominant
    language is other than English. In addition they have been denied
    equal educational opportunities by State and local governments,
    resulting in severe disabilities and continuing illiteracy in the
    English language. The Congress further finds that, where State and
    local officials conduct elections only in English, language
    minority citizens are excluded from participating in the electoral
    process. In many areas of the country, this exclusion is aggravated
    by acts of physical, economic, and political intimidation. The
    Congress declares that, in order to enforce the guarantees of the
    fourteenth and fifteenth amendments to the United States
    Constitution, it is necessary to eliminate such discrimination by
    prohibiting English-only elections, and by prescribing other
    remedial devices.
      (2) No voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or
    standard, practice, or procedure shall be imposed or applied by any
    State or political subdivision to deny or abridge the right of any
    citizen of the United States to vote because he is a member of a
    language minority group.
      (3) In addition to the meaning given the term under subsection
    (c) of this section, the term "test or device" shall also mean any
    practice or requirement by which any State or political subdivision
    provided any registration or voting notices, forms, instructions,
    assistance, or other materials or information relating to the
    electoral process, including ballots, only in the English language,
    where the Director of the Census determines that more than five per
    centum of the citizens of voting age residing in such State or
    political subdivision are members of a single language minority.
    With respect to subsection (b) of this section, the term "test or
    device", as defined in this subsection, shall be employed only in
    making the determinations under the third sentence of that
    subsection.
      (4) Whenever any State or political subdivision subject to the
    prohibitions of the second sentence of subsection (a) of this
    section provides any registration or voting notices, forms,
    instructions, assistance, or other materials or information
    relating to the electoral process, including ballots, it shall
    provide them in the language of the applicable language minority
    group as well as in the English language: Provided, That where the
    language of the applicable minority group is oral or unwritten or
    in the case of Alaskan Natives and American Indians, if the
    predominate language is historically unwritten, the State or
    political subdivision is only required to furnish oral
    instructions, assistance, or other information relating to
    registration and voting.

    local election because of his failure to comply with any test or
    device in any State with respect to which the determinations have
    been made under the first two sentences of subsection (b) of this
    section or in any political subdivision with respect to which such
    determinations have been made as a separate unit, unless the United
    States District Court for the District of Columbia in an action for
    a declaratory judgment brought by such State or subdivision against
    the United States has determined that no such test or device has
    been used during the seventeen years preceding the filing of the
    action for the purpose or with the effect of denying or abridging
    the right to vote on account of race or color: Provided, That no

    such tests or devices have occurred any where in the territory of
    such plaintiff. No citizen shall be denied the right to vote in any
    Federal, State, or local election because of his failure to comply
    with any test or device in any State with respect to which the
    determinations have been made under the third sentence of
    subsection (b) of this section or in any political subdivision with
    respect to which such determinations have been made as a separate
    unit, unless the United States District Court for the District of
    Columbia in an action for a declaratory judgment brought by such
    State or subdivision against the United States has determined that
    no such test or device has been used during the ten years preceding
    the filing of the action for the purpose or with the effect of
    denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color,
    or in contravention of the guarantees set forth in subsection
    (f)(2) of this section: Provided, That no such declaratory judgment
    shall issue with respect to any plaintiff for a period of ten years
    after the entry of a final judgment of any court of the United
    States, other than the denial of a declaratory judgment under this
    section, whether entered prior to or after the enactment of this

    guarantees set forth in subsection (f)(2) of this section through
    the use of tests or devices have occurred anywhere in the territory
    of such plaintiff.

    the Supreme Court. The court shall retain jurisdiction of any
    action pursuant to this subsection for five years after judgment
    and shall reopen the action upon motion of the Attorney General
    alleging that a test or device has been used for the purpose or
    with the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on
    account of race or color, or in contravention of the guarantees set
    forth in subsection (f)(2) of this section.

    of subsection (b) of this section or in any political subdivision
    with respect to which such determinations have been made as a

    maintained on November 1, 1972, any test or device, and with
    respect to which the Director of the Census determines that less
    than 50 per centum of the citizens of voting age were registered on

    effect on November 1, 1972, such State or subdivision may institute
    an action in the United States District Court for the District of
    Columbia for a declaratory judgment that such qualification,
    prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure does not have the
    purpose and will not have the effect of denying or abridging the
    right to vote on account of race or color, or in contravention of

    official of such State or subdivision to the Attorney General and
    the Attorney General has not interposed an objection within sixty
    days after such submission, or upon good cause shown, to facilitate
    an expedited approval within sixty days after such submission, the

    Sec. 1973d. Federal voting examiners; appointment

-STATUTE-
      Whenever (a) a court has authorized the appointment of examiners
    pursuant to the provisions of section 1973a(a) of this title, or
    (b) unless a declaratory judgment has been rendered under section
    1973b(a) of this title, the Attorney General certifies with respect
    to any political subdivision named in, or included within the scope
    of, determinations made under section 1973b(b) of this title that
    (1) he has received complaints in writing from twenty or more
    residents of such political subdivision alleging that they have
    been denied the right to vote under color of law on account of race
    or color, or in contravention of the guarantees set forth in
    section 1973b(f)(2) of this title, and that he believes such
    complaints to be meritorious, or (2) that in his judgment
    (considering, among other factors, whether the ratio of nonwhite
    persons to white persons registered to vote within such subdivision
    appears to him to be reasonably attributable to violations of the
    fourteenth or fifteenth amendment or whether substantial evidence
    exists that bona fide efforts are being made within such
    subdivision to comply with the fourteenth or fifteenth amendment),
    the appointment of examiners is otherwise necessary to enforce the
    guarantees of the fourteenth or fifteenth amendment, the Director
    of the Office of Personnel Management shall appoint as many
    examiners for such subdivision as the Director may deem appropriate
    to prepare and maintain lists of persons eligible to vote in
    Federal, State, and local elections. Such examiners, hearing
    officers provided for in section 1973g(a) of this title and other
    persons deemed necessary by the Director to carry out the
    provisions and purposes of subchapters I-A to I-C of this chapter
    shall be appointed, compensated, and separated without regard to
    the provisions of any statute administered by the Director of the
    Office of Personnel Management, and service under subchapters I-A
    to I-C of this chapter shall not be considered employment for the
    purposes of any statute administered by the Director of the Office
    of Personnel Management, except the provisions of subchapter III of
    chapter 73 of title 5 relating to political activities: Provided,
    That the Director is authorized, after consulting the head of the
    appropriate department or agency, to designate suitable persons in
    the official service of the United States, with their consent, to
    serve in these positions. Examiners and hearing officers shall have
    the power to administer oaths.

    (a) Form of application; requisite allegation of nonregistration
      The examiners for each political subdivision shall, at such
    places as the Director of the Office of Personnel Management shall
    by regulation designate, examine applicants concerning their

    in such form as the Director may require and shall contain
    allegations that the applicant is not otherwise registered to vote.
    (b) Placement of eligible voters on official lists; transmittal of
      lists

    instructions received under section 1973g(b) of this title, to have
    the qualifications prescribed by State law not inconsistent with
    the Constitution and laws of the United States shall promptly be
    placed on a list of eligible voters. A challenge to such listing
    may be made in accordance with section 1973g(a) of this title and

    such lists and supplements thereto transmitted during the month
    shall be available for public inspection on the last business day
    of the month and in any event not later than the forty-fifth day
    prior to any election. The appropriate State or local election
    official shall place such names on the official voting list. Any
    person whose name appears on the examiner's list shall be entitled
    and allowed to vote in the election district of his residence
    unless and until the appropriate election officials shall have been
    notified that such person has been removed from such list in

    appropriate election officials at least forty-five days prior to
    such election.
    (c) Certificate of eligibility
      The examiner shall issue to each person whose name appears on
    such a list a certificate evidencing his eligibility to vote.
    (d) Removal of names from list by examiners
      A person whose name appears on such a list shall be removed
    therefrom by an examiner if (1) such person has been successfully
    challenged in accordance with the procedure prescribed in section
    1973g of this title, or (2) he has been determined by an examiner
    to have lost his eligibility to vote under State law not
    inconsistent with the Constitution and the laws of the United
    States.

      Any challenge to a listing on an eligibility list prepared by an
    examiner shall be heard and determined by a hearing officer
    appointed by and responsible to the Director of the Office of
    Personnel Management and under such rules as the Director shall by

    of Personnel Management shall by regulation designate, and within
    ten days after the listing of the challenged person is made
    available for public inspection, and if supported by (1) the
    affidavits of at least two persons having personal knowledge of the
    facts constituting grounds for the challenge, and (2) a
    certification that a copy of the challenge and affidavits have been
    served by mail or in person upon the person challenged at his place
    of residence set out in the application. Such challenge shall be
    determined within fifteen days after it has been filed. A petition
    for review of the decision of the hearing officer may be filed in
    the United States court of appeals for the circuit in which the
    person challenged resides within fifteen days after service of such
    decision by mail on the person petitioning for review but no

    of witnesses and the production of documentary evidence relating to
    any matter pending before the Director under the authority of this
    section. In case of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpena, any
    district court of the United States or the United States court of
    any territory or possession, or the District Court of the United
    States for the District of Columbia, within the jurisdiction of
    which said person guilty of contumacy or refusal to obey is found
    or resides or is domiciled or transacts business, or has appointed
    an agent for receipt of service of process, upon application by the
    Attorney General of the United States shall have jurisdiction to
    issue to such person an order requiring such person to appear
    before the Director or a hearing officer, there to produce
    pertinent, relevant, and nonprivileged documentary evidence if so
    ordered, or there to give testimony touching the matter under

    Sec. 1973h. Poll taxes

-STATUTE-
    (a) Congressional finding and declaration of policy against
      enforced payment of poll taxes as a device to impair voting
      rights
      The Congress finds that the requirement of the payment of a poll
    tax as a precondition to voting (i) precludes persons of limited
    means from voting or imposes unreasonable financial hardship upon
    such persons as a precondition to their exercise of the franchise,
    (ii) does not bear a reasonable relationship to any legitimate
    State interest in the conduct of elections, and (iii) in some areas
    has the purpose or effect of denying persons the right to vote
    because of race or color. Upon the basis of these findings,
    Congress declares that the constitutional right of citizens to vote
    is denied or abridged in some areas by the requirement of the
    payment of a poll tax as a precondition to voting.
    (b) Authority of Attorney General to institute actions for relief
      against enforcement of poll tax requirement
      In the exercise of the powers of Congress under section 5 of the
    fourteenth amendment, section 2 of the fifteenth amendment and
    section 2 of the twenty-fourth amendment, the Attorney General is
    authorized and directed to institute forthwith in the name of the
    United States such actions, including actions against States or
    political subdivisions, for declaratory judgment or injunctive
    relief against the enforcement of any requirement of the payment of
    a poll tax as a precondition to voting, or substitute therefor
    enacted after November 1, 1964, as will be necessary to implement
    the declaration of subsection (a) of this section and the purposes
    of this section.
    (c) Jurisdiction of three-judge district courts; appeal to Supreme
      Court
      The district courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction
    of such actions which shall be heard and determined by a court of
    three judges in accordance with the provisions of section 2284 of
    title 28 and any appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court. It shall be
    the duty of the judges designated to hear the case to assign the
    case for hearing at the earliest practicable date, to participate
    in the hearing and determination thereof, and to cause the case to
    be in every way expedited.

    conspires with another individual for the purpose of encouraging
    his false registration to vote or illegal voting, or pays or offers
    to pay or accepts payment either for registration to vote or for
    voting shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more

    or document knowing the same to contain any false, fictitious, or
    fraudulent statement or entry, shall be fined not more than $10,000

    Representatives, Delegate from the District of Columbia, Guam, or
    the Virgin Islands, or Resident Commissioner of the Commonwealth of
    Puerto Rico.
      (3) As used in this subsection, the term "votes more than once"
    does not include the casting of an additional ballot if all prior
    ballots of that voter were invalidated, nor does it include the
    voting in two jurisdictions under section 1973aa-1 of this title,

    (a) Depriving or attempting to deprive persons of secured rights
      Whoever shall deprive or attempt to deprive any person of any
    right secured by section 1973, 1973a, 1973b, 1973c, 1973e, or 1973h

      Whoever, within a year following an election in a political
    subdivision in which an examiner has been appointed (1) destroys,
    defaces, mutilates, or otherwise alters the marking of a paper
    ballot which has been cast in such election, or (2) alters any
    official record of voting in such election tabulated from a voting
    machine or otherwise, shall be fined not more than $5,000, or
    imprisoned not more than five years, or both.
    (c) Conspiring to violate or interfere with secured rights

    section 1973, 1973a, 1973b, 1973c, 1973e, 1973h, or 1973i(a) of
    this title shall be fined not more than $5,000, or imprisoned not
    more than five years, or both.
    (d) Civil action by Attorney General for preventive relief;
      injunctive and other relief
      Whenever any person has engaged or there are reasonable grounds
    to believe that any person is about to engage in any act or
    practice prohibited by section 1973, 1973a, 1973b, 1973c, 1973e,
    1973h, 1973i, or subsection (b) of this section, the Attorney
    General may institute for the United States, or in the name of the
    United States, an action for preventive relief, including an
    application for a temporary or permanent injunction, restraining
    order, or other order, and including an order directed to the State
    and State or local election officials to require them (1) to permit
    persons listed under subchapters I-A to I-C of this chapter to vote
    and (2) to count such votes.
    (e) Proceeding by Attorney General to enforce the counting of
      ballots of registered and eligible persons who are prevented from
      voting
      Whenever in any political subdivision in which there are
    examiners appointed pursuant to subchapters I-A to I-C of this
    chapter any persons allege to such an examiner within forty-eight
    hours after the closing of the polls that notwithstanding (1) their
    listing under subchapters I-A to I-C of this chapter or
    registration by an appropriate election official and (2) their
    eligibility to vote, they have not been permitted to vote in such
    election, the examiner shall forthwith notify the Attorney General
    if such allegations in his opinion appear to be well founded. Upon
    receipt of such notification, the Attorney General may forthwith
    file with the district court an application for an order providing
    for the marking, casting, and counting of the ballots of such
    persons and requiring the inclusion of their votes in the total
    vote before the results of such election shall be deemed final and
    any force or effect given thereto. The district court shall hear
    and determine such matters immediately after the filing of such
    application. The remedy provided in this subsection shall not
    preclude any remedy available under State or Federal law.
    (f) Jurisdiction of district courts; exhaustion of administrative
      or other remedies unnecessary
      The district courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction
    of proceedings instituted pursuant to this section and shall
    exercise the same without regard to whether a person asserting
    rights under the provisions of subchapters I-A to I-C of this
    chapter shall have exhausted any administrative or other remedies
    that may be provided by law.

-STATUTE-
      Listing procedures shall be terminated in any political
    subdivision of any State (a) with respect to examiners appointed
    pursuant to clause (b) of section 1973d of this title whenever the
    Attorney General notifies the Director of the Office of Personnel
    Management, or whenever the District Court for the District of
    Columbia determines in an action for declaratory judgment brought
    by any political subdivision with respect to which the Director of
    the Census has determined that more than 50 per centum of the
    nonwhite persons of voting age residing therein are registered to
    vote, (1) that all persons listed by an examiner for such
    subdivision have been placed on the appropriate voting registration
    roll, and (2) that there is no longer reasonable cause to believe
    that persons will be deprived of or denied the right to vote on
    account of race or color, or in contravention of the guarantees set
    forth in section 1973b(f)(2) of this title in such subdivision, and
    (b), with respect to examiners appointed pursuant to section
    1973a(a) of this title, upon order of the authorizing court. A
    political subdivision may petition the Attorney General for the
    termination of listing procedures under clause (a) of this section,
    and may petition the Attorney General to request the Director of
    the Census to take such survey or census as may be appropriate for
    the making of the determination provided for in this section. The
    District Court for the District of Columbia shall have jurisdiction
    to require such survey or census to be made by the Director of the
    Census and it shall require him to do so if it deems the Attorney
    General's refusal to request such survey or census to be arbitrary
    or unreasonable.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1973aa-1. Residence requirements for voting

-STATUTE-
    (a) Congressional findings
      The Congress hereby finds that the imposition and application of
    the durational residency requirement as a precondition to voting
    for the offices of President and Vice President, and the lack of
    sufficient opportunities for absentee registration and absentee
    balloting in presidential elections - 
        (1) denies or abridges the inherent constitutional right of
      citizens to vote for their President and Vice President;
        (2) denies or abridges the inherent constitutional right of
      citizens to enjoy their free movement across State lines;
        (3) denies or abridges the privileges and immunities guaranteed
      to the citizens of each State under article IV, section 2, clause
      1, of the Constitution;
        (4) in some instances has the impermissible purpose or effect
      of denying citizens the right to vote for such officers because
      of the way they may vote;
        (5) has the effect of denying to citizens the equality of civil
      rights, and due process and equal protection of the laws that are
      guaranteed to them under the fourteenth amendment; and
        (6) does not bear a reasonable relationship to any compelling
      State interest in the conduct of presidential elections.
    (b) Congressional declaration: durational residency requirement,
      abolishment; absentee registration and balloting standards,
      establishment
      Upon the basis of these findings, Congress declares that in order
    to secure and protect the above-stated rights of citizens under the
    Constitution, to enable citizens to better obtain the enjoyment of
    such rights, and to enforce the guarantees of the fourteenth
    amendment, it is necessary (1) to completely abolish the durational
    residency requirement as a precondition to voting for President and
    Vice President, and (2) to establish nationwide, uniform standards
    relative to absentee registration and absentee balloting in
    presidential elections.
    (c) Prohibition of denial of right to vote because of durational
      residency requirement or absentee balloting
      No citizen of the United States who is otherwise qualified to
    vote in any election for President and Vice President shall be
    denied the right to vote for electors for President and Vice
    President, or for President and Vice President, in such election
    because of the failure of such citizen to comply with any
    durational residency requirement of such State or political
    subdivision; nor shall any citizen of the United States be denied
    the right to vote for electors for President and Vice President, or
    for President and Vice President, in such election because of the
    failure of such citizen to be physically present in such State or
    political subdivision at the time of such election, if such citizen
    shall have complied with the requirements prescribed by the law of
    such State or political subdivision providing for the casting of
    absentee ballots in such election.
    (d) Registration: time for application; absentee balloting: time of
      application and return of ballots
      For the purposes of this section, each State shall provide by law
    for the registration or other means of qualification of all duly
    qualified residents of such State who apply, not later than thirty
    days immediately prior to any presidential election, for
    registration or qualification to vote for the choice of electors
    for President and Vice President or for President and Vice
    President in such election; and each State shall provide by law for
    the casting of absentee ballots for the choice of electors for

    President, or for President and Vice President, in such election,
    (1) in person in the State or political subdivision in which he
    resided immediately prior to his removal if he had satisfied, as of
    the date of his change of residence, the requirements to vote in
    that State or political subdivision, or (2) by absentee ballot in
    the State or political subdivision in which he resided immediately

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1973aa-1a. Bilingual election requirements

-STATUTE-
    (a) Congressional findings and declaration of policy
      The Congress finds that, through the use of various practices and
    procedures, citizens of language minorities have been effectively
    excluded from participation in the electoral process. Among other
    factors, the denial of the right to vote of such minority group
    citizens is ordinarily directly related to the unequal educational
    opportunities afforded them resulting in high illiteracy and low
    voting participation. The Congress declares that, in order to
    enforce the guarantees of the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments
    to the United States Constitution, it is necessary to eliminate
    such discrimination by prohibiting these practices, and by
    prescribing other remedial devices.
    (b) Bilingual voting materials requirement
      (1) Generally
        Before August 6, 2007, no covered State or political
      subdivision shall provide voting materials only in the English
      language.
      (2) Covered States and political subdivisions
        (A) Generally
          A State or political subdivision is a covered State or
        political subdivision for the purposes of this subsection if
        the Director of the Census determines, based on census data,
        that - 
            (i)(I) more than 5 percent of the citizens of voting age of
          such State or political subdivision are members of a single
          language minority and are limited-English proficient;
            (II) more than 10,000 of the citizens of voting age of such
          political subdivision are members of a single language
          minority and are limited-English proficient; or
            (III) in the case of a political subdivision that contains
          all or any part of an Indian reservation, more than 5 percent
          of the American Indian or Alaska Native citizens of voting
          age within the Indian reservation are members of a single
          language minority and are limited-English proficient; and
            (ii) the illiteracy rate of the citizens in the language
          minority as a group is higher than the national illiteracy
          rate.
        (B) Exception
          The prohibitions of this subsection do not apply in any
        political subdivision that has less than 5 percent voting age
        limited-English proficient citizens of each language minority
        which comprises over 5 percent of the statewide limited-English
        proficient population of voting age citizens, unless the
        political subdivision is a covered political subdivision
        independently from its State.
      (3) Definitions
        As used in this section - 
          (A) the term "voting materials" means registration or voting
        notices, forms, instructions, assistance, or other materials or
        information relating to the electoral process, including
        ballots;
          (B) the term "limited-English proficient" means unable to
        speak or understand English adequately enough to participate in
        the electoral process;
          (C) the term "Indian reservation" means any area that is an
        American Indian or Alaska Native area, as defined by the Census
        Bureau for the purposes of the 1990 decennial census;
          (D) the term "citizens" means citizens of the United States;
        and
          (E) the term "illiteracy" means the failure to complete the
        5th primary grade.
      (4) Special rule
        The determinations of the Director of the Census under this
      subsection shall be effective upon publication in the Federal
      Register and shall not be subject to review in any court.
    (c) Requirement of voting notices, forms, instructions, assistance,
      or other materials and ballots in minority language
      Whenever any State or political subdivision subject to the
    prohibition of subsection (b) of this section provides any
    registration or voting notices, forms, instructions, assistance, or
    other materials or information relating to the electoral process,
    including ballots, it shall provide them in the language of the
    applicable minority group as well as in the English language:
    Provided, That where the language of the applicable minority group
    is oral or unwritten or in the case of Alaskan natives and American
    Indians, if the predominant language is historically unwritten, the
    State or political subdivision is only required to furnish oral
    instructions, assistance, or other information relating to
    registration and voting.
    (d) Action for declaratory judgment permitting English-only
      materials
      Any State or political subdivision subject to the prohibition of
    subsection (b) of this section, which seeks to provide English-only
    registration or voting materials or information, including ballots,
    may file an action against the United States in the United States
    District Court for a declaratory judgment permitting such
    provision. The court shall grant the requested relief if it
    determines that the illiteracy rate of the applicable language
    minority group within the State or political subdivision is equal
    to or less than the national illiteracy rate.
    (e) Definitions
      For purposes of this section, the term "language minorities" or
    "language minority group" means persons who are American Indian,
    Asian American, Alaskan Natives, or of Spanish heritage.

    the Census determines (i) that more than 5 percent of the citizens

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1973ff-2. Federal write-in absentee ballot in general
      elections for Federal office for absent uniformed services voters
      and overseas voters

-STATUTE-
    (a) In general
      The Presidential designee shall prescribe a Federal write-in
    absentee ballot (including a secrecy envelope and mailing envelope
    for such ballot) for use in general elections for Federal office by
    absent uniformed services voters and overseas voters who make
    timely application for, and do not receive, States, absentee
    ballots.
    (b) Submission and processing
      Except as otherwise provided in this subchapter, a Federal write-
    in absentee ballot shall be submitted and processed in the manner
    provided by law for absentee ballots in the State involved. A
    Federal write-in absentee ballot of an absent uniformed services
    voter or overseas voter shall not be counted - 
        (1) in the case of a ballot submitted by an overseas voter who
      is not an absent uniformed services voter, if the ballot is
      submitted from any location in the United States;
        (2) if the application of the absent uniformed services voter
      or overseas voter for a State absentee ballot is received by the
      appropriate State election official after the later of - 
          (A) the deadline of the State for receipt of such
        application; or
          (B) the date that is 30 days before the general election; or

        (3) if a State absentee ballot of the absent uniformed services
      voter or overseas voter is received by the appropriate State
      election official not later than the deadline for receipt of the
      State absentee ballot under State law.
    (c) Special rules
      The following rules shall apply with respect to Federal write-in
    absentee ballots:
        (1) In completing the ballot, the absent uniformed services
      voter or overseas voter may designate a candidate by writing in
      the name of the candidate or by writing in the name of a
      political party (in which case the ballot shall be counted for
      the candidate of that political party).
        (2) In the case of the offices of President and Vice President,
      a vote for a named candidate or a vote by writing in the name of
      a political party shall be counted as a vote for the electors
      supporting the candidate involved.
        (3) Any abbreviation, misspelling, or other minor variation in
      the form of the name of a candidate or a political party shall be
      disregarded in determining the validity of the ballot, if the
      intention of the voter can be ascertained.
    (d) Second ballot submission; instruction to absent uniformed
      services voter or overseas voter
      An absent uniformed services voter or overseas voter who submits
    a Federal write-in absentee ballot and later receives a State
    absentee ballot, may submit the State absentee ballot. The
    Presidential designee shall assure that the instructions for each
    Federal write-in absentee ballot clearly state that an absent
    uniformed services voter or overseas voter who submits a Federal
    write-in absentee ballot and later receives and submits a State
    absentee ballot should make every reasonable effort to inform the
    appropriate State election official that the voter has submitted
    more than one ballot.
    (e) Use of approved State absentee ballot in place of Federal write-
      in absentee ballot
      The Federal write-in absentee ballot shall not be valid for use
    in a general election if the State involved provides a State
    absentee ballot that - 
        (1) at the request of the State, is approved by the
      Presidential designee for use in place of the Federal write-in
      absentee ballot; and
        (2) is made available to absent uniformed services voters and
      overseas voters at least 60 days before the deadline for receipt
      of the State ballot under State law.
    (f) Certain States exempted
      A State is not required to permit use of the Federal write-in
    absentee ballot, if, on and after August 28, 1986, the State has in
    effect a law providing that - 
        (1) a State absentee ballot is required to be available to any
      voter described in section 1973ff-6(5)(A) of this title at least
      90 days before the general election involved; and
        (2) a State absentee ballot is required to be available to any
      voter described in section 1973ff-6(5)(B) or (C) of this title,
      as soon as the official list of candidates in the general
      election is complete.

    absent uniformed services voter or overseas voter for simultaneous
    voter registration and absentee ballot application (in accordance
    with section 1973ff-1(a)(4) of this title) and the voter requests
    that the application be considered an application for an absentee
    ballot for each subsequent election for Federal office held in the
    State through the next 2 regularly scheduled general elections for
    Federal office (including any runoff elections which may occur as a
    result of the outcome of such general elections), the State shall
    provide an absentee ballot to the voter for each such subsequent
    election.
    (b) Exception for voters changing registration
      Subsection (a) of this section shall not apply with respect to a
    voter registered to vote in a State for any election held after the
    voter notifies the State that the voter no longer wishes to be
    registered to vote in the State or after the State determines that
    the voter has registered to vote in another State.
    (c) Revision of official post card form
      The Presidential designee shall revise the official post card
    form (prescribed under section 1973ff of this title) to enable a
    voter using the form to - 
        (1) request an absentee ballot for each election for Federal
      office held in a State during a year; or
        (2) request an absentee ballot for only the next scheduled
      election for Federal office held in a State.
    (d) No Effect on voter removal programs
      Nothing in this section may be construed to prevent a State from
    removing any voter from the rolls of registered voters in the State
    under any program or method permitted under section 1973gg-6 of
    this title.
    (e) Prohibition of refusal of applications on grounds of early

    application or absentee ballot application (including the postcard
    form prescribed under section 1973ff of this title) submitted by an
    absent uniformed services voter during a year on the grounds that
    the voter submitted the application before the first date on which
    the State otherwise accepts or processes such applications for that
    year submitted by absentee voters who are not members of the
    uniformed services.

    Sec. 1973gg. Findings and purposes

-STATUTE-
    (a) Findings
      The Congress finds that - 
        (1) the right of citizens of the United States to vote is a
      fundamental right;
        (2) it is the duty of the Federal, State, and local governments
      to promote the exercise of that right; and
        (3) discriminatory and unfair registration laws and procedures
      can have a direct and damaging effect on voter participation in
      elections for Federal office and disproportionately harm voter
      participation by various groups, including racial minorities.
    (b) Purposes
      The purposes of this subchapter are - 
        (1) to establish procedures that will increase the number of
      eligible citizens who register to vote in elections for Federal
      office;
        (2) to make it possible for Federal, State, and local
      governments to implement this subchapter in a manner that
      enhances the participation of eligible citizens as voters in
      elections for Federal office;
        (3) to protect the integrity of the electoral process; and
        (4) to ensure that accurate and current voter registration
      rolls are maintained.

          (B) has not voted or appeared to vote in 2 or more
        consecutive general elections for Federal office.
    (c) Voter removal programs
      (1) A State may meet the requirement of subsection (a)(4) of this
    section by establishing a program under which - 
        (A) change-of-address information supplied by the Postal
      Service through its licensees is used to identify registrants

          (i) a registrant has moved to a different residence address
        in the same registrar's jurisdiction in which the registrant is
        currently registered, the registrar changes the registration
        records to show the new address and sends the registrant a
        notice of the change by forwardable mail and a postage prepaid
        pre-addressed return form by which the registrant may verify or
        correct the address information; or
          (ii) the registrant has moved to a different residence
        address not in the same registrar's jurisdiction, the registrar
        uses the notice procedure described in subsection (d)(2) of
        this section to confirm the change of address.

      (2)(A) A State shall complete, not later than 90 days prior to

      subchapter.
    (d) Removal of names from voting rolls
      (1) A State shall not remove the name of a registrant from the
    official list of eligible voters in elections for Federal office on
    the ground that the registrant has changed residence unless the
    registrant - 
        (A) confirms in writing that the registrant has changed
      residence to a place outside the registrar's jurisdiction in
      which the registrant is registered; or
        (B)(i) has failed to respond to a notice described in paragraph
      (2); and
        (ii) has not voted or appeared to vote (and, if necessary,
      correct the registrar's record of the registrant's address) in an
      election during the period beginning on the date of the notice
      and ending on the day after the date of the second general
      election for Federal office that occurs after the date of the
      notice.

      (2) A notice is described in this paragraph if it is a postage
    prepaid and pre-addressed return card, sent by forwardable mail, on
    which the registrant may state his or her current address, together
    with a notice to the following effect:
        (A) If the registrant did not change his or her residence, or
      changed residence but remained in the registrar's jurisdiction,
      the registrant should return the card not later than the time
      provided for mail registration under subsection (a)(1)(B) of this
      section. If the card is not returned, affirmation or confirmation
      of the registrant's address may be required before the registrant
      is permitted to vote in a Federal election during the period
      beginning on the date of the notice and ending on the day after
      the date of the second general election for Federal office that
      occurs after the date of the notice, and if the registrant does
      not vote in an election during that period the registrant's name
      will be removed from the list of eligible voters.
        (B) If the registrant has changed residence to a place outside
      the registrar's jurisdiction in which the registrant is
      registered, information concerning how the registrant can
      continue to be eligible to vote.

      (3) A voting registrar shall correct an official list of eligible
    voters in elections for Federal office in accordance with change of
    residence information obtained in conformance with this subsection.
    (e) Procedure for voting following failure to return card
      (1) A registrant who has moved from an address in the area
    covered by a polling place to an address in the same area shall,
    notwithstanding failure to notify the registrar of the change of
    address prior to the date of an election, be permitted to vote at
    that polling place upon oral or written affirmation by the
    registrant of the change of address before an election official at
    that polling place.
      (2)(A) A registrant who has moved from an address in the area
    covered by one polling place to an address in an area covered by a
    second polling place within the same registrar's jurisdiction and
    the same congressional district and who has failed to notify the
    registrar of the change of address prior to the date of an
    election, at the option of the registrant - 
        (i) shall be permitted to correct the voting records and vote
      at the registrant's former polling place, upon oral or written
      affirmation by the registrant of the new address before an
      election official at that polling place; or
        (ii)(I) shall be permitted to correct the voting records and
      vote at a central location within the same registrar's
      jurisdiction designated by the registrar where a list of eligible
      voters is maintained, upon written affirmation by the registrant
      of the new address on a standard form provided by the registrar
      at the central location; or
        (II) shall be permitted to correct the voting records for
      purposes of voting in future elections at the appropriate polling
      place for the current address and, if permitted by State law,
      shall be permitted to vote in the present election, upon
      confirmation by the registrant of the new address by such means
      as are required by law.

      (B) If State law permits the registrant to vote in the current
    election upon oral or written affirmation by the registrant of the
    new address at a polling place described in subparagraph (A)(i) or
    (A)(ii)(II), voting at the other locations described in
    subparagraph (A) need not be provided as options.
      (3) If the registration records indicate that a registrant has
    moved from an address in the area covered by a polling place, the
    registrant shall, upon oral or written affirmation by the
    registrant before an election official at that polling place that
    the registrant continues to reside at the address previously made
    known to the registrar, be permitted to vote at that polling place.
    (f) Change of voting address within a jurisdiction
