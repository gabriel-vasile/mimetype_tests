1. I fully support the implementation of rules which would require mutual fund
managers and any other holders of individual investment funds to fully
disclose how they vote proxy ballots.    2. This disclosure should be readily
available to both the individual investors of the fund and also to media.
3. Disclosure should be immediate following completion of balloting, if not as
soon as the fund casts it's vote.  Electronic processing can be so rapid that
there is no rational excuse for delay in disclosure of how each fund casts OUR
proxies.
4. Fund managers may have reasons why it could be financially advantageous to
the company management to cast proxies in ways that are not in the best
interest of the investors in the fund.  However, their obligation as fund
manager is to manage the assets---IN ALL WAYS, so as to derive the maximum
benefit for the investors.  Full disclosure can help investors monitor how
well management is fulfilling that duty.  Conversely, when managers fail to
look after investor's best interests this is outright dereliction of duty and
the investors not only can/should remove their money from that fund management
but should also initiate the necessary legal actions to correct the problems. 
SEC should develop rules to prevent any such necessity.
