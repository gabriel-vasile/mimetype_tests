The (26; data sheet BELOW) votes are in and Continental Shelf Research
was the narrow winner over JGR-Oceans. I suggest that folks interested in ms
submission to this journal take a look at CSR vol 18, number 11, 1998; a
special issue on the North Sea Sediment Resuspension Experiment.
Tentatively, we'll use the proposed ms list submitted for the L&O exercise
(attached) - if you want to add, edit or remove, please let me know.

Individual questions follow - PLEASE respond to eegle-kites ASAP.  Thanks

Val, are you still willing to be ombudsman:  point of contact with the
journal, determine whether we can have a special issue and under what
conditions (timing, size, review policy, cost, etc), and get the ms to the
journal on time ?

Editors - the special issue cited above had folks from within the program.
Bedford, Bundy, Churchill, Cotner, Edgington, Kerfoot, Chen, Vanderploeg,
and Green. Are you still willing to be editors for this journal ?
