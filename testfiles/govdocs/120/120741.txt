SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Domestic Mail Manual (DMM), incorporated
by reference in title 39, Code of Federal Regulations, part 111,
contains: the basic standards of the U.S. Postal Service governing its
domestic mail services; descriptions of the mail classes and special
services and conditions governing their use; and standards for rate
eligibility and mail preparation. The document is amended and
republished about every 6 months, with each issue sequentially
numbered.
    DMM Issue 53, the next edition of the DMM, is scheduled for release
on January 1, 1998. That issue will include changes in Preferred
postage rates for Periodicals and Standard Mail (A). The final rule
containing the rates for these changes was published on July 25, 1997,
in the Federal Register (62 FR 39946-39950), as approved on June 2,
1997, by the Board of Governors pursuant to its authority under 39
U.S.C. 3625(f), to implement rate changes effective at 12:01 a.m. on
October 5, 1997 (Resolution No. 97-9).
    DMM Issue 53 will also include the new weight limit for Bound
Printed Matter. The final rule to increase the weight of Bound Printed
Matter from 10 pounds to 15 pounds was published on October 1, 1997, in
the Federal Register (62 FR 51372-51373), as approved on September 8,
1997, by the Board of Governors, to implement the Decision of the
Governors of the United States Postal Service on the Recommended
Decision of the Postal Rate Commission on the Classification Changes,
Bound Printed Matter, Docket No. MC97-3. This weight increase takes
effect at 12:01 a.m. on October 5, 1997.
    DMM Issue 53 will include the standards for the new Bulk Parcel
Return Service (BPRS) and Shipper Paid Forwarding (SPF). BPRS, which
takes effect on October 12, 1997, lowers the average cost of return
service for machinable parcels weighing less than 1 pound. SPF, which
allows mailers to pay forwarding postage directly through the use of
the tracking capabilities of the existing electronic Address Change
Service, takes effect on January 4, 1998. The new standards for BPRS
and SPF were published on October 15, 1997, in the Federal Register (62
FR 53539-53541) as approved on October 6, 1997, by the Board of
Governors on the Recommended Decision of the Postal Rate Commission in
Docket No. MC97-2.
    The following excerpt from section I010, Summary of Changes, of the
transmittal for DMM Issue 53 covers the minor changes not previously
described in final rules or in other interim or final rules published
in the Federal Register. Announcements of these minor changes were
first published in various issues of the Postal Bulletin, an official
biweekly document published by the Postal Service. In addition, the
revised contents of DMM Issue 53 are also presented.
