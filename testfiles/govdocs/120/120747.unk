      2           CHAIR DAVIDSON:  All right.  I'd

      3 like to call the meeting to order.  And if

      4 everybody would put their cell phones on

      5 silent, I would appreciate it.

      6           I think we'll stand and we'll do

      7 The Pledge of Allegiance.

      9           CHAIR DAVIDSON:  I will now turn

     10 to Julie Hodgkins, our counsel, to do the

     11 roll call, please.

     12           MS. HODGKINS:  Thank you, Madam

     13 Chair.

     14           Members, if you will respond by

     15 saying "present" or "here" after I call

     16 your name.  Donetta Davidson?

     17           CHAIR DAVIDSON:  Present.

     18           MS. HODGKINS:  Rosemary

      3           MS. HODGKINS:  Madam Chair,

      4 there are four members present and a

      5 quorum.

      6           CHAIR DAVIDSON:  Thank you.

      7 Next on the agenda is the adoption of the

      8 agenda.  If it meets with everybody's

      9 okay, can I have a motion?

     10           COMMISSIONER HILLMAN:  So moved.

     11           VICE-CHAIR RODRIGUEZ:  Second.

     12           CHAIR DAVIDSON:  All those in

     13 favor, I.  Opposed?  The motion carries.

     14           Well, good morning, everybody,

     15 and thank you for attending.  I do

     16 appreciate it, and I want to take this

     17 opportunity to thank all of our panelists

     18 for their comments and their guidance that

     19 they are giving to us this morning.

     20           Today, we're going to be hearing

     21 from three chairs of our committees that

     22 has being designated by HAVA.  In order to
                                                  5



      1 address as many issues as possible, I

      2 would like to have this meeting a little

      3 bit more informal so we can make sure that

      4 we address issues that they might even

      5 have between them and us.

      6           I hope all three of them, in

      7 their testimony, give us, you know, an

      8 exchange, as much information as possible.

      9 And, again, I want to thank everybody for

     10 coming, and I look forward to their

     11 information that we will gain from today's

     12 meeting.

     13           So as we proceed, we'll have old

     14 business, and in Tab 2, you've got the

     15 minutes.  Are there any corrections to the

     16 minutes or do I have a motion to approve?

     17           COMMISSIONER HUNTER:  So moved.

     18           CHAIR DAVIDSON:  Second?

     19           COMMISSIONER HILLMAN:  Second.

     20           CHAIR DAVIDSON:  With the motion

     21 made and seconded, I will call for a vote.

     22 All those in favor, I.  Opposed?  The
                                                  6



      1 motion carries.

      2           All right.  Next, we have a

      3 report from our executive director, Tom

      4 Wilkey, and that is in Tab 3 for the

      5 Commission, and it's all yours, Mr.

      6 Wilkey.

      7           MR. WILKEY:  Thank you, Madam

      8 Chair.  Before I begin the report, I think

      9 it is appropriate to note the absence of

     10 the usual number of Congressional staff

     11 people who normally join us at these

     12 meetings.

     13           This morning, as many of you are

     14 aware, there is a memorial service in the

     15 Capitol Rotunda for the late Congresswoman

     16 Juanita Millender-McDonald.

     17 Unfortunately, this meeting was scheduled

     18 before this memorial service was also

     19 scheduled.  And we regret that because I

     20 know many of us here would have preferred

     21 to have been at that important event.

     22           Congresswoman Millender-McDonald
                                                  7



      1 was an outstanding individual and a good

      2 friend of this Commission.  She was a joy

      3 to work with, and I know she'll be missed

      4 by all of her colleagues in the House of

      5 Representatives, and in her District in

      6 the State of California.

      7           We also note with sadness the

      8 death of the son of Ronnie Gillespie, the

      9 Election Counsel to the Senate Rules

     10 Committee.  His son, Jonathan, was an

     11 outstanding individual, certainly went to

     12 his maker much too early.  And I know that

     13 all of us here at the Commission who

     14 worked closely with Ronnie over the years

     15 send our deepest sympathy and regrets on

     16 both of these occasions.

     17           Now, I am going to go ahead and

     18 continue with my report.  Under the Office

     19 of Inspector General, audits are underway

     20 in the following states:  Rhode Island,

     21 Maryland, Wyoming, Kentucky, New Mexico,

     22 and Missouri.  They expect to wrap up
                                                  8



      1 their audits in Virginia and Indiana by

      2 the end of this week.  You can visit --

      3 get any of this information, if you need,

      4 audit reports are posted on our inspector

      5 general part of our web site at,

      6 "www.eac.gov."

      7           As many of you are aware, our

      8 Chair has requested that the Inspector

      9 General review the details surrounding two

     10 research projects in both the fraud and

     11 intimidation report and our voter ID

     12 report.  That review is underway, and we

     13 will distribute the findings as soon as

     14 our Inspector General's Office has that

     15 review complete.  And we will place all of

     16 the information concerning this review on

     17 our web site.

     18           Under administrative matters, I

     19 need to update you on a few Congressional

     20 inquiries we have had.  Senator Dianne

     21 Feinstein, Chair of the Senate Rules

     22 Committee, has asked us for information
                                                  9



      1 related to the voter fraud and voter

      2 intimidation study, and the staff has

      3 almost finished with her request.

      4 Congressman Zoe Lofgren, who is the Chair

      5 of the Subcommittee on Elections and the

      6 Committee on House Administration, has

      7 requested information about this same

      8 topic, as well as for all correspondence

      9 between EAC and the Department of Justice.

     10 And I will note that after this report was

     11 compiled, we were informed this morning

     12 there has been some clarification on

     13 exactly what was needed from us in that

     14 area, and there has been some narrowing of

     15 that request as we look through this.

     16           Staff is scheduled to wrap up

     17 the first request tomorrow, and is already

     18 working on the second request.  You need

     19 to know that EAC takes these inquiries

     20 very seriously, and responding to these

     21 Congressional requests are the

     22 Commission's top priority.  Copies of
                                                 10



      1 these Congressional requests and our

      2 responses today are available up front,

      3 and they are posted on our web site as

      4 well.  In the future, EAC will dedicate a

      5 specific place on our web site for all

      6 Congressional inquiries and EAC's

      7 responses.      Under voting system

      8 certification, nine voting system

      9 manufacturers have registered for the EAC

     10 testing and certificate program.  Five

     11 voting systems have been submitted for

     12 testing.  The first test plan has been

     13 submitted.  And all of this information

     14 is, of course, available on our web site,

     15 and that will continue to be added to as

     16 we get further requests for certification

     17 from vendors as we move along.

     18           As you will hear this morning,

     19 and this was not added as part of the

     20 report, we had an outstanding meeting in

     21 Denver with state and local vendors and

     22 our test labs, and that will be reported
                                                 11



      1 by state.  Under voting system test labs,

      2 EAC is to certify labs, test high quality

      3 assurance earlier this week, as I think

      4 you will hear from the Chair of NIST.

      5           The National Institute of

      6 Standards & Technology recommended that

      7 EAC accredit Infoguard Laboratories.  EAC

      8 will conduct its non-technical review, and

      9 within the next few weeks, ask you to make

     10 a final decision regarding this

     11 accreditation.

     12           We're very excited and pleased

     13 over our glossary, Spanish and English

     14 glossary, released last month.  It is

     15 getting great reviews from a number of

     16 places.  We translate election terms from

     17 Spanish to English, English to Spanish,

     18 and it is a valuable resource to voters

     19 throughout the country and certainly to

     20 our local election administrators and

     21 state election administrators.  This is

     22 the first update since 1979.  If anyone is
                                                 12



      1 interested in either receiving a copy or

      2 electronic copy, they can call us toll

      3 free and also download it from our web

      4 site.

      5           As always, EAC distributes a

      6 monthly electronic newsletter that

      7 provides updates to our activities,

      8 upcoming meetings, and other HAVA-related

      9 issues.  To sign up, call us toll free or

     10 send us an e-mail at, "havainfo@eac.gov."

     11           Finally, Madam Chair, through

     12 the efforts the Commissioner Hillman, the

     13 EAC will be posting the first of several

     14 EAC draft documents to the Standards

     15 Board's virtually meeting room for review

     16 and comment.  EAC will also work to do a

     17 similar process with our Board of

     18 Advisors.  And Madam Chair, I believe it

     19 would be appropriate, since this is such a

     20 great deal that we'll be utilizing in the

     21 future, not just for our boards but I

     22 think we can use it in other areas, to
                                                 13



      1 have Commissioner Hillman comment on this

      2 since she's done all of the work in

      3 getting this started.

      4           CHAIR DAVIDSON:  Commissioner

      5 Hillman.

      6           COMMISSIONER HILLMAN:  Sure.

      7 Thank you.  I appreciate the opportunity.

      8 As we all know, the Standards Board is a

      9 huge committee, it's 110 people.  It takes

     10 about four to six months to plan a

     11 meeting of the Standards Board, and it is

     12 a fairly costly enterprise.

     13           In order not to restrict the

     14 work and the business of the Standards

     15 Board, I was trying to think of ways that

     16 the Standards Board could assist EAC in

     17 either reviewing draft documents or even

     18 to get its own business done in between

     19 meetings and still adhere to the rules and

     20 regulations of the Federal Advisory

     21 Committee Act for transparency and

     22 accessibility.
                                                 14



      1           So we have create what we call a

      2 virtual meeting room.  Initially, I

      3 referred to it as a chat room, and one of

      4 my executive members said no, I don't

      5 think I want to tell people that I spent a

      6 couple of hours in the chat room today.

      7 So we're calling it the virtual meeting

      8 room, and it is on the main web site of

      9 the EAC.  It is a tool where Standards

     10 Board members will be able to post

     11 password-protected comments.  The public

     12 will be able to view all of the comments.

     13           For this particular exercise,

     14 EAC has asked the Standards Board to

     15 review a draft report that was prepared

     16 for us by Design For Democracy, and that

     17 record contains suggested best practices

     18 as well as templates for the design of

     19 voter information and ballots for optical

     20 scan and DRE voting systems.  It is a

     21 fairly large document, broken up into

     22 eight sections, to make it easy for both
                                                 15



      1 the public to view as well as the

      2 Standards Board to review and comment on

      3 it.

      4           It is an exciting test.  The

      5 executive board and I have been talking

      6 about this, and we've done little tests

      7 earlier this year, and the protocols have

      8 been put in place, and the idea was

      9 embraced by both the executive board of

     10 the Standards Board, and the full

     11 Standards Board back in February when the

     12 Standards Board met.  So it's really nice

     13 to get this off.

     14           When I first started this, I

     15 wasn't sure what we would be using it for,

     16 but I knew it was prudent to get started

     17 so when we needed it, we could pick it can

     18 up right away.  It is proven to be

     19 something we can have up and going in less

     20 than a week, if we need to.  We could bump

     21 up against notice requirements, but I

     22 think, frequently, EAC finds that because
                                                 16



      1 of schedules of when draft documents will

      2 be presented to us, what the turnaround

      3 time will be so that we can get comments

      4 on them, we will periodically not be able

      5 to give 15 days notice when we're using

      6 the virtual meeting room, but the flip

      7 side is the virtual meeting room will be

      8 open for five days, 24 hours a day.

      9 People can go on any period time, see all

     10 the comments posted from the beginning.

     11 And so there is no confined period of time

     12 that the public has to get on to look at

     13 the comments.  And, additionally, the

     14 public will be able to send written

     15 statements back to the Standards Board.

     16 We have created an e-mail address for the

     17 Standards Board.  We're using this as a

     18 test.  So far, so good.  I signed on

     19 bright and early this morning to make sure

     20 that everything was working.  I had

     21 election official jitters so I said, Lord,

     22 let's see what's not working.  And sure
                                                 17



      1 enough for me, on my computer at home, I

      2 couldn't open Section 2.  But I noticed

      3 that right away the administrator of the

      4 site did tests on Section 2, and within an

      5 hour, other people were able to open

      6 Section 2.

      7           So I think the tool's going to

      8 work for us, and I do want to thank -- and

      9 it's great that Peggy Nighswonger is here

     10 today.  I want to that.  I thank the

     11 Standards Board for being willing to allow

     12 us to use their input as a test of the

     13 system.

     14           CHAIR DAVIDSON:  And as the

     15 director stated, we will then move forward

     16 to do the Advisory Board the same way and

     17 so that they have that capability also.

     18 So we appreciate the test being done.

     19           Any issues, as you said, one

     20 issue this morning, but there is always an

     21 issue it seems like and working those out.

     22 So it will be a help in the future,
                                                 18



      1 obviously, and it will be a great tool.

      2           Any questions for Mr. Wilkey

      3 from anyone?

      4           COMMISSIONER HILLMAN:  I do have

      5 a question.  If you would like for me to

      6 save it for Brian Hancock, I will.

      7           MR. WILKEY:  Sure.

      8           COMMISSIONER HILLMAN:  But you

      9 mentioned something about -- and I just

     10 need to be reminded, under the voting

     11 system certification program, the first

     12 test plan has been submitted.  Please

     13 remind me what that is.

     14           MR. WILKEY:  Basically, it is

     15 the plan of how they are going to conduct

     16 all the tests for the labs and it has to

     17 be provided by the vendor.

     18           COMMISSIONER HILLMAN:  So

     19 Mr. Hancock knows I'm going to ask the

     20 question.  He is probably going to answer

     21 it.  Thank you.

     22           MR. WILKEY:  He is shaking his
                                                 19



      1 head yes.

      2           CHAIR DAVIDSON:  Okay.  If I

      3 could ask the three panelists to come

      4 forward.  I will start in.  Today, we're

      5 going to be hearing from the three chairs

      6 of the EAC's really advisory committees in

      7 one way or another.  I am hoping that

      8 today's testimony will give all three of

      9 our panelists the opportunity to brief the

     10 Commission on how the EAC can better serve

     11 their respective committees and better

     12 prepare election officials in the United

     13 States for the 2008 election that is

     14 closely coming upon us.

     15           I encourage the panel to be open

     16 and frank with their comments, and offer

     17 their perspectives on what the EAC can do

     18 to better meet the needs.  Also, the TGDC,

     19 Technical Guidelines Development

     20 Committee, and NIST, National Institute of

     21 Standards and Technology, continue to work

     22 on the next iteration of our VVSG,
                                                 20



      1 Voluntary Voting System Guidelines.

      2 I look forward to hearing from all three

      3 of them about their involvement in the

      4 development of the process of this,

      5 because it's important that we get the

      6 chairs of the other two committees'

      7 perspective in this area to create the

      8 most comprehensive and thorough set of

      9 guidelines possible in the future.

     10           As we know, this next iteration

     11 is a total rewrite of the previous

     12 standards.  And as such, the EAC must do

     13 due diligence in reviewing and venting the

     14 document through its advisory committees

     15 and the public.  I hope to learn from our

     16 panelists today what the current feeling

     17 is in their respective committees

     18 regarding this next iteration and what the

     19 EAC can do to meet their needs as we

     20 prepare to receive the VVSG, and then

     21 accept comments from the public in the

     22 future.
                                                 21



      1           First, I'm going to turn to

      2 Christopher or we call him Chris Thomas,

      3 which is the Director of Elections in

      4 Michigan.  He has been there in this

      5 position since 1981, and he currently is

      6 the chair of the elections board of

      7 advisors and is a founding member of the

      8 National Association of the State Election

      9 Directors, which he served as president in

     10 1997.

     11           Next in the panelists will go to

     12 Peggy Nighswonger, which is the Director

     13 of Elections in Wyoming, and Peggy has

     14 been there in that capacity since 1996.

     15 Peggy currently serves as chair of our

     16 Standards Board Committee, Standards Board

     17 Executive Committee, and she serves as

     18 vice-president also of the executive board

     19 of the National Association of State

     20 Election Directors, NASED.

     21           Dr. William Jeffrey is our final

     22 panelist member, and he is the Director of
                                                 22



      1 the National Institute of Standards and

      2 Technology.  He was nominated by President

      3 Bush on May 25, 2005 and confirmed by the

      4 U.S. Senate on July 22nd of 2005.  As a

      5 director of the NIST, Dr Jeffrey serves as

      6 our chair of the EAC Technical Guideline

      7 Development Committee.  And I look forward

      8 to all three of your testimonies, so we

      9 will start out with you, Chris.

     10           MR. NELSON:  Okay.  Thank you,

     11 very much, good morning.  I bring you

     12 greetings from the board of advisors.  And

     13 I am honored to be the chair of that board

     14 and I appear before you today.  I look

     15 forward to working with the new

     16 Commissioners, Ms. Hunter, Ms. Rodriguez.

     17 And I definitely find it a pleasure, Madam

     18 Chair and Commissioner Hillman, to

     19 continue our dialogue.

     20           I have provided written comments

     21 so I will not read through those, but just

     22 make comments, give the high points, and I
                                                 23



      1 am certainly available to engage in any

      2 questions and answers.

      3           I'd like to make some comments

      4 about what we're doing on the Board of

      5 Advisors in preparation for reviewing the

      6 next iteration of guidelines, and also a

      7 few comments dealing with the vendor

      8 conference clause of certification, and

      9 along with the Technical Guidelines

     10 Development Committee, so a few topics

     11 today.

     12           I think that the Board of

     13 Advisors Board of Directors board, in

     14 fact, need a more active role than we have

     15 had in the past.  Section 247 of HAVA, I

     16 think, makes it clear that these boards

     17 are to work with you in consultation with

     18 the various studies and guidelines that

     19 you are promulgating.  I recall that the

     20 advisory panel of the election

     21 administration that was organized under

     22 the Federal Election Commission really was
                                                 24



      1 designed as an advisory committee, but

      2 never really quite made that.  We would

      3 show up to meetings and, essentially,

      4 listen and go home.  We look for a more

      5 active role, and we've seen that, and I

      6 think that was Congress's intent by

      7 specifying what the duties of these

      8 advisory boards are.

      9           And our members do look forward

     10 to a more active role.  In the instances

     11 where we reviewed studies, I believe that

     12 we have been shown, basically, two

     13 different modes.  In a few instances, we

     14 have actually reviewed the studies

     15 themselves.  In other cases, we receive a

     16 briefing on what the status and the scope

     17 of a particular study will be.

     18           Now, for example, we did see the

     19 provisional balloting study before it was

     20 released, and I do understand that once

     21 its given to the board, it becomes a

     22 public document.  We found some definite
                                                 25



      1 issues in that report, and I think the

      2 comments from both boards serve the

      3 process well, in terms of having that

      4 report brought up to snuff, if you will.

      5 There must be some avenue provided to

      6 these boards to be more actively involved

      7 in either the work groups or peer review

      8 of your studies.  And we did at our last

      9 meeting, frankly, support your decision on

     10 the fraud and intimidation study not to

     11 release certain aspects of that.  We see

     12 that as your right of ownership of that

     13 and definitely stood behind your position

     14 there.

     15           I would urge you also to

     16 continue to look to the academic community

     17 for research resources.  The academic

     18 community is discovering you, and they

     19 know that you're here.  I have had the

     20 opportunity to work with Mike Troudette

     21 from the University of Michigan, who has

     22 been active in studying in a scientific
                                                 26



      1 manner optical scan and DRE systems, and I

      2 think this is the type of research and the

      3 type of individuals that would really

      4 serve this panel very well.  And I would

      5 urge you to keep partisan and ideological

      6 concern out of the decision on balancing

      7 research teams.  I do believe that good,

      8 solid research that is closely monitored

      9 under exacting contractual provisions,

     10 under thorough peer review will carry the

     11 day.

     12           Members of the board, again,

     13 we'd like to be much more involved in that

     14 peer review process, and I would urge that

     15 all studies, after it goes through your

     16 rigorous internal reviews, be submitted to

     17 the boards before you decide whether to

     18 accept or reject the studies themselves.

     19           With regard to the Denver

     20 conference on certification, it is one of

     21 the better conferences I have attended,

     22 and that's because all the stakeholders
                                                 27



      1 are at the table.  Brian Hancock really

      2 ran a first rate meeting and should be

      3 congratulated for that.

      4           A number of issues came up to

      5 me, as I sat through that conference, the

      6 first which I think was one of the aims of

      7 this process, was that several testing

      8 protocols can be employed to actually

      9 reduce state certification cost.  One of

     10 the prime examples of that is volume

     11 testing, that few of the states had

     12 undertaken.  I think if that were done by

     13 the national labs, all the states would

     14 benefit from that type of testing.

     15           Second, it became apparent to

     16 me, a major stakeholder who is not

     17 involved in the TGDC, and that is the

     18 voting system manufacturers, as they are

     19 not represented on this critical

     20 committee.  And I urge EAC and Dr. Jeffrey

     21 to find a spot at the table for the

     22 manufacturers.
                                                 28



      1           It is my understanding that

      2 NIST's general pattern and practice of

      3 developing standards is to pull everybody

      4 together that are in the field and reach a

      5 consensus, so that would involve

      6 manufacturers as well.

      7           We had a very dynamic speaker in

      8 Denver who was in charge of the gaming

      9 standards for gaming in Nevada.  He also

     10 related his process, very collaborative,

     11 in terms of dealing with gaming operators,

     12 gaming machine manufacturers, as he

     13 developed standards that those systems

     14 need to meet.  And I think that model fits

     15 well here in the elections community.

     16           Now, I don't know whether

     17 manufacturers are really interested in

     18 sitting at the table or not.  They may

     19 not, but I think they need to be there

     20 because I think they have something to add

     21 to the development of the guidelines, and

     22 I would like them to take some
                                                 29



      1 responsibility for those guidelines.

      2 So, again, I would just urge that they be

      3 included in this process, and I do know

      4 they have access.  I am not suggesting

      5 they don't, by any means, but I'd like to

      6 see them there as a voting member where

      7 they have got to sign on along with

      8 everybody else.

      9           The third thing I found which is

     10 kind of interesting, listening to all the

     11 technical people disagree on some very

     12 basic items that a non-technical person

     13 would have thought to be easily agreeable.

     14 So it shows you that in this field,

     15 probably not most everything is not nailed

     16 down and there's lots of room for

     17 interpretation.

     18           And, finally, the conference on

     19 cost was important, but really I think the

     20 more critical aspect of the guidelines is

     21 the eventual cost that it will have for

     22 voting systems.  My question is, is there
                                                 30



      1 a cost benefit analysis being made with

      2 regard to the impact that these guidelines

      3 will have on the bottom line cost of

      4 voting systems.  And I understand that

      5 manufacturers make various claims about

      6 the impact of cost due to the guidelines,

      7 and I believe they must be verified and

      8 not taken at face value.  And I understand

      9 that some of that has been done, and

     10 that's a good thing, I think, should

     11 continue.

     12           As a state person, we have, as

     13 all the states have, used a large portion

     14 of our HAVA money to buy voting system.

     15 We either have done that as direct

     16 purchases by the states and granted the

     17 equipment to local units, or we have

     18 served as a pass-through, providing the

     19 funds for local government to purchase

     20 these systems.

     21           Suffice it to say there is an

     22 expectation that has been created by this
                                                 31



      1 that there will be some sort of state aid

      2 when voting systems are purchased in the

      3 future.  And this is a major shift.

      4 Traditionally, very few states

      5 participated in the financial part.  It

      6 has generally been a local responsibility.

      7 We're now into that, and when the next set

      8 come along to be purchased, we, no doubt,

      9 will be looked to, to pay some share of

     10 that.

     11           Now, I am told by some of the

     12 manufacturers that the life span of the

     13 optical scan system may be as short as

     14 seven years, a frightening aspect.  So we

     15 cannot have guidelines that drive voting

     16 system cost beyond reasonable levels.  And

     17 I just really urge that there be some

     18 component that attempts to discern what

     19 those costs may be.

     20           As the Board of Advisors

     21 prepares to review the next iteration, I

     22 would note that we're very pleased with
                                                 32



      1 the virtual meeting.  I think that will

      2 assist us tremendously in our work.  We're

      3 going to participate in this, and I think

      4 that makes a very reasonable and

      5 meaningful process both to us and to you.

      6 I also understand there is a contract to

      7 make -- put these guidelines into English.

      8 And I would note that we seriously believe

      9 that must precede any review period.  We

     10 cannot call upon our board members or the

     11 public to digest the implication of these

     12 guidelines if it's going to be totally

     13 technical language.  And, frankly, I think

     14 we will need nine months to a year to do

     15 the review that's necessary, given that

     16 this is an entire rewrite of the existing

     17 standards, and I assume many additions.

     18 And I would not be a bit surprised that

     19 after the review and your review of it,

     20 that another trip back to the table will

     21 be necessary to update or correct some of

     22 the guidelines based on comments received.
                                                 33



      1 I think it's important that everything

      2 that you all and the public and

      3 manufacturers and interest groups and

      4 election officials believe that need to be

      5 in the guidelines get included in this

      6 version so that you can put this process

      7 to rest for several years.

      8           Timing should be key on the next

      9 purchase period, not on the next one or

     10 two election cycles.  For example, the

     11 2005 standards, which were minimum in

     12 nature, have not yet gone into production,

     13 in terms of equipment, by all the

     14 manufacturers.  Some of them tell me that

     15 for optical scan, they are going to have

     16 to create a new box.  Whether that's true

     17 or not, I don't know, but they indicate

     18 they may have to create a whole new

     19 tabulator in order to comply.  Well, I

     20 don't think we're going to be discarding

     21 the tabulators that we bought that are

     22 2002 compliant, and repurchase new
                                                 34



      1 tabulators as they become 2005 compliant.

      2           The reality, people are going to

      3 hang on to what they have.  If at some

      4 reasonable cost, software upgrades are

      5 feasible, fine, but if we're talking about

      6 buying all new hardware, I don't see that

      7 happening.  And what I would expect is

      8 we're going to hang on to this equipment

      9 until its life span has run its course,

     10 and then we're going to go out and buy the

     11 next iteration.

     12           I would urge you to aim your

     13 next iteration of guidelines for that

     14 purchasing cycle.  That cycle is going to

     15 affect most of the states in this country,

     16 given the large amount of purchases that

     17 have occurred in the last three years.

     18           So my question is, basically,

     19 what is the rush.  And I think folks need

     20 to make sure that everything that's in

     21 there that needs to be in these guidelines

     22 is in the guidelines, and that it is cost
                                                 35



      1 effective, and that it does not result in

      2 a gold standard system that none of the

      3 states or localities can afford.  I don't

      4 really expect there to be another three

      5 billion dollars coming from the Federal

      6 Government to make the next purchase.  So

      7 I would really urge you to move in that

      8 area.

      9           Regarding current software

     10 upgrades, I know a number of the systems

     11 have started to come in.  The concern from

     12 the elections community is that we need

     13 those upgrades in order to, basically, run

     14 the 2008 election.  The one example I'll

     15 give you is Automark.  That's a system

     16 that is I'd say still in development.  It

     17 has a few shortcomings that can be

     18 corrected by software upgrades, so we're

     19 very concerned that these will actually

     20 make it through the process as these

     21 systems are being required to come in from

     22 testing.
                                                 36



      1           I understand your decision not

      2 to accept the 2002 certifications by

      3 NASED, but I am hoping that this does not

      4 result in a number of states being forced

      5 to conduct elections with software that

      6 really needs to be upgraded.

      7           So with that, I thank you for

      8 the opportunity to report on the Board of

      9 Advisors' activities, and for the

     10 opportunity to present my thoughts on

     11 these critical issues.

     12           CHAIR DAVIDSON:  Thank you.

     13 Next, Peggy Nighswonger.

     14           MS. NIGHSWONGER:  I too want to

     15 thank you for the invite to this hearing.

     16 The executive board of the National

     17 Standards Board made two initial

     18 determinations.  The first that it would

     19 make recommendations to the Standards

     20 Board for deliberation and action, and

     21 that it would not make recommendations

     22 directly to the EAC.  So I am today here
                                                 37



      1 not as an executive board member, but

      2 rather to represent the full 110-member

      3 board of the Standards Board.  And I have

      4 reported to you actually before, so I just

      5 want to give you a brief background on our

      6 recent activities as a board.

      7           At the end of the 2006 meeting

      8 in May of 2006, a call was issued to seek

      9 volunteers to serve on committees to the

     10 Standards Board.  There was a seven-member

     11 bylaws committee, and then the five-member

     12 nominating committee.  And both committees

     13 have worked really hard this year to

     14 satisfy the procedures for nominating

     15 people onto the board of directors board

     16 and also getting our bylaws in the proper

     17 format.   And so we gave -- all of those

     18 committees actually reported to the

     19 Standards Board at the February meeting.

     20 And the meeting in Atlanta actual was very

     21 well attended.  I feel like a lot of

     22 things were accomplished at this meeting.
                                                 38



      1 There was solid discussion about what the

      2 board really wanted to accomplish in the

      3 next year, and there was a lot of

      4 discussion about the voting system

      5 guidelines and what part our board really

      6 needed to play in the process of guideline

      7 determination and implementation.

      8           And so from that work, actually

      9 the board did pass five resolutions at the

     10 February meeting, and I'd like to just

     11 give you a brief overview of those

     12 resolutions that were passed.  The first

     13 one actually recommended that the EAC

     14 should be strong, and in a bipartisan

     15 fashion, inform Congress and the public

     16 that while HAVA is still being

     17 implemented, it should remain untouched

     18 for a longer period of time so it can be

     19 determined just what the effects and the

     20 benefits and the detriments really were

     21 going to be, and that Congress should

     22 provide full funding, as was promised to
                                                 39



      1 the states in the beginning.  Also, that

      2 after Congress meets its promises under

      3 HAVA, that any further changes, that such

      4 changes only be promulgated with full

      5 funding, that Congress promote a time

      6 line, and that in no case should changes

      7 proposed have effective dates before July,

      8 2010.

      9           The next resolution recommended

     10 that the EAC consider the value and

     11 importance of having NIST and the TGDC

     12 conduct with at least two elected and

     13 independent election groups, such as

     14 NASED, the election center, IACREOT, from

     15 our national groups that could secure

     16 consultation on the impact of the complex

     17 new standards that are coming into effect.

     18           The third resolution actually

     19 was a resolution that recommended that the

     20 EAC provide a period to receive public

     21 comments, to allow election officials and

     22 the voters the opportunity to provide
                                                 40



      1 observations of the impacts of NVRA.  And

      2 this would allow you to include an

      3 analysis of such observations in the

      4 report and your recommendations to

      5 Congress which you will be making on June

      6 30, 2007.

      7           The fourth resolution

      8 recommended that the EAC seriously narrow

      9 the scope of the next iteration of the

     10 VVSG to only include those matters that

     11 are time sensitive and emergency in

     12 nature.  Also, that there be a regular

     13 schedule established for future changes to

     14 the VVSG that keeps each new version in

     15 scope and understandable for

     16 manufacturers, the public, and election

     17 administrators.

     18           And the last resolution that was

     19 passed recommends that the EAC give

     20 careful consideration to the need for a

     21 policy about the VVSG updates.  The VVSG

     22 should not be updated more frequently than
                                                 41



      1 every four years after the instance of the

      2 next iteration.  We felt like there needs

      3 to be time for proper implementation and

      4 observation, and we just didn't feel like

      5 it would be wise to continue to hurry into

      6 the next versions of equipment.

      7           So those were the resolutions

      8 that were passed at the meeting in

      9 February.

     10           And I guess my next remarks I'd

     11 like to make more as an individual and as

     12 a state election director.  And the three

     13 topics that I'd like to address with you

     14 are attention to the voting system

     15 standards, assistance to states regarding

     16 voting system certification and testing,

     17 and then obtaining full fund so that HAVA

     18 can be implemented as it was intended to

     19 be.

     20           As you know, the Federal

     21 Government and the states have spent huge

     22 amounts of money in the last couple of
                                                 42



      1 years on new voting equipment.  And

      2 purchase of that equipment had to occur

      3 very quickly, and many states rushed

      4 deadlines in order to deliver the

      5 equipment, have it tested, and be

      6 certified in order to conduct the election

      7 in 2006.  And, generally, that equipment

      8 performed fairly well around the nation.

      9           Now, next steps are underway

     10 with the development of the next iteration

     11 of the voting system standards, and I

     12 think there are three items that I would

     13 like to suggest to the EAC with regard to

     14 the new voting system standards, and I,

     15 like Chris, would really like to have you

     16 assure that the right players are at the

     17 table to give input on the next iteration

     18 of the standards.

     19           And I too learned at the Denver

     20 meeting that NIST, election officials,

     21 vendors, independent testing companies and

     22 public interest groups, each provide a
                                                 43



      1 perspective that will lend to a better

      2 whole.

      3           And also from that meeting, I

      4 think we learned that other entities, as

      5 Chris said, like the gaming industry, have

      6 experience in writing equipment standards.

      7 And so I'd like to urge you all to include

      8 all the players and utilize the experience

      9 that all of those players can bring so

     10 that the next iteration can be the best

     11 they can be.

     12           The next thing I'd like to urge

     13 you to think about is the timing.  As

     14 Chris also brought up, not to

     15 intentionally rush, not to intentionally

     16 delay, I guess I would say it, during the

     17 next couple of years, rapid time frames

     18 are going to, I think, bring some problems

     19 for vendors, for independent testers, or

     20 for the election community.  And I think

     21 we generally fared well in the 2006

     22 election, but I know that it's going to be
                                                 44



      1 very difficult for us all to meet the time

      2 lines that are ahead of us.  So I'd like

      3 you to just consider being wise about the

      4 timing of the future standards.

      5           When the standards are finished,

      6 the race is just going to begin for

      7 several things.  Vendors are going to need

      8 to develop changes that meet those

      9 standards.  The states and the local

     10 jurisdictions are going to need to see the

     11 changes.  There will be a need for

     12 contracts and purchases.  There will be a

     13 need for deployment of all these, these

     14 procedures, and the training will begin.

     15 As all of us know, the training is really

     16 the thing that makes the election happen.

     17 So I'd like to ask you to give serious

     18 consideration when the standards become

     19 effective, that they are realistic for

     20 time lines, and we request that you really

     21 weigh the conduct of the 2008 election

     22 more highly than you weigh your political
                                                 45



      1 pressures that I know are upon you.

      2           My second key issue is to call

      3 your attention to the assistance that

      4 states need in regard to the voting system

      5 certification.  And I think too that it

      6 was clear in Denver, at the Denver summit

      7 meeting, that a stronger testing program

      8 at the federal level is needed, a good,

      9 solid testing program at the federal level

     10 that could provide small states with

     11 needed protections and assist large states

     12 by reducing redundancy in the federal and

     13 state testing programs.

     14           I think there needs to be

     15 attention to scale and efficiencies, and

     16 the EAC can take a strong lead in that.  I

     17 know that testing of voting systems will

     18 be expensive, and likely more expensive as

     19 this equipment is designed to require more

     20 things.  So I know the cost of testing and

     21 the liability of not testing are worse,

     22 yet testing improperly can be a huge
                                                 46



      1 burden and a problem.

      2           So I'd really like to have you

      3 take note of this problem and do what you

      4 can do about the cost of testing.  I think

      5 additional tests at the federal level

      6 would be good so that there is less

      7 redundancy of tests across states, and

      8 possibly the EAC could orchestrate

      9 communications, such as providing voting

     10 system testing templates and protocols to

     11 small states so testing can be performed

     12 at the state level appropriately and

     13 accurately.

     14              And I guess my last point,

     15 again, and I know I probably am preaching

     16 to the choir, but since I am on record, I

     17 would like to once again ask the EAC to

     18 take every opportunity that you can take

     19 when you are with Congress and have

     20 availability to them to, again, request

     21 full funding.  States have HAVA-compliant

     22 voting equipment but the maintenance, the
                                                 47



      1 testing and ongoing financial burden to

      2 states is going to be a huge item that

      3 states aren't going to be prepared to

      4 handle.

      5           So just to conclude, I would

      6 like to thank you for the opportunity to

      7 speak and to be on record pertaining to

      8 these issues.  I have had a really good

      9 experience, wonderful experience,

     10 representing the National Standards Board.

     11 And it's a group of very highly qualified

     12 professionals, and I really regard the

     13 work that everyone has done, and I think

     14 we have been really diligent this past

     15 year in our work as a board.  The

     16 110-member board is gracious.  It is very

     17 difficult to do work with 110 people and

     18 to accomplish things, but I feel like this

     19 with what your leadership has been, we

     20 have accomplished a lot this year.

     21           We all look forward to your

     22 action.  Thank you, very much.
                                                 48



      1           CHAIR DAVIDSON:  Thank you.

      2 And, finally, we'll take Dr. Jeffrey's

      3 testimony, then I will take a break and

      4 then we will come back for questions.

      5           MR. JEFFREY:  Thank you, very

      6 much, Chair Davidson, Commissioners

      7 Hillman, Hunter, and Rodriguez.  Thank you

      8 for the opportunity to testify today on

      9 NIST's goal in voluntary voting system

     10 guidelines and testing.

     11           The major items assigned to NIST

     12 by HAVA include, one, human factors report

     13 which was delivered in 2004, sharing and

     14 providing technical guidelines, technical

     15 support, to the TGDC in the following

     16 areas; security of computers, methods to

     17 detect and prevent fraud, privacy of

     18 voting, accessibility and usability of

     19 voting systems, and three, conducting an

     20 evaluation of independent, non-federal

     21 laboratories in order to commit to the EAC

     22 a list of those laboratories that NIST
                                                 49



      1 proposes to be accredited by the EAC test

      2 voting systems.

      3           HAVA provided for creation of

      4 the TGDC and mandated that the first set

      5 of recommendations for voting system

      6 guideline, known as VVSG 2005, be

      7 delivered to the EAC within nine months

      8 after the creation of the TGDC.  The VVSG

      9 2005 built upon the strengths of the

     10 previous voting system standards, enhanced

     11 areas needing improvement, and included

     12 new material, primarily in usability,

     13 accessibility, and security.

     14           The resulting document was

     15 delivered on schedule to the EAC in May of

     16 2005.  Now, immediately after completing

     17 that work, NIST and TGDC began working on

     18 the next iteration of the VVSG, which is

     19 your recently planned for delivery to the

     20 EAC in July, 2007.

     21           The new VVSG differs from the

     22 2005 version in significant ways.  It will
                                                 50



      1 be, one, is a complete rewrite with

      2 requirements that are clear and

      3 unambiguous.  Two -- we went to task on

      4 two.  Two constrains significantly

      5 expanded security material.  Three contain

      6 updated requirements for liability and

      7 accuracy, and four, contain usability

      8 requirements based on benchmarks from user

      9 testing.

     10           Let me describe a few of the

     11 major changes.  In December of 2006, the

     12 TGDC approved a resolution to include

     13 requirements in the VVSG only for those

     14 voting systems that are software

     15 independent.  This means, essentially,

     16 that the voting system can be audited

     17 through the use of voter-verified paper

     18 records so that the election fraud and

     19 errors that would result in changes would

     20 be readily detected.  To encourage

     21 innovations in voting systems that produce

     22 producible, reliable designs, the new VVSG
                                                 51



      1 will include what we call an innovation

      2 clause.  Some innovations resulting from

      3 this clause could result in voting system

      4 that would not rely on voter-verified

      5 paper records.  Other securities

      6 requirements have been updated and

      7 expanded to make them more comprehensive

      8 and productive, which includes access

      9 control, cryptography, physical security,

     10 and open-ended vulnerability testing,

     11 upgraded software coding systems, and

     12 software development practices to enable

     13 vendors to produce code that is easier to

     14 come and test.

     15           The commercial, off-the-shelf

     16 software has been narrowed, resulting in

     17 more comprehensive vetting of codes.

     18 Usability requirements are now based on

     19 actual performance benchmarks for voting

     20 accuracy and ease.

     21           There will be a TGDC meeting

     22 next week to discuss the remaining drafted
                                                 52



      1 material for the VVSG.  Details of this

      2 meeting, including all reports to be

      3 presented, are on NIST's web site.  NIST

      4 has been directed to recommend qualified

      5 labs for EAC accreditation.  NIST first

      6 accredits a voting system test according

      7 to NAVLAP's criteria, then recommends them

      8 to the EAC.  In January of 2007, NIST

      9 proposed Ibeta (sic), under provisions of

     10 HAVA.  On May 11, NIST proposed Infoguard

     11 Laboratories to EAC for accreditation.

     12 Currently, NAVLAP is proceeding with four

     13 other applicant laboratories.

     14           NIST is also developing other

     15 comprehensive test suites so that the

     16 requirements in the draft VVSG can be

     17 tested uniformly and consistently by all

     18 testing laboratories. NIST will be

     19 developing these tests throughout 2007 and

     20 2008, and will release them incrementally

     21 to the public, as they are developed.

     22 These tests will help to increase public
                                                 53



      1 confidence, regardless of which lab has

      2 performed the test.

      3           Currently, NIST is developing a

      4 formal structure for specifying test

      5 inputs and outputs for ballot variations.

      6 NIST is very pleased to be working on

      7 national boards like this, and we

      8 definitely appreciate our board and our

      9 progress from the EAC and all of the TGDC

     10 members.

     11           I'd like to thank you for the

     12 opportunity to testify, and I'd be happy

     13 to answer any questions.

     14           CHAIR DAVIDSON:  Thank you.

     15 We're going to take a quick break, just

     16 ten minutes, then come back, and we will

     17 get started with the questions.  Thank

     18 you.

     19              (Short Recess.)

     20           CHAIR DAVIDSON:  All right.

     21 Thank you.  I'm going to go ahead and

     22 start in on questions now.  I'm sorry but
                                                 54



      1 we had to find one place or another for a

      2 break, so I appreciate everybody getting

      3 back so promptly.

      4           I think that I'll start with

      5 Commissioner Rodriguez.  Would you like to

      6 start with questions?

      7           VICE-CHAIR RODRIGUEZ:  Thank

      8 you, Madam Chair.  And I appreciate all of

      9 you joining us today.

     10           Mr. Thomas, you talked a little

     11 bit about studies that you had had the

     12 opportunity to review, as a member of the

     13 Board of Advisors, before they were

     14 adopted.  And, you know, I think I'm going

     15 to get in trouble.  Our general counsel

     16 will notify me.  But in light of the some

     17 of the current controversies that we're

     18 experiencing right now, do you think we're

     19 going to be able to find research

     20 universities and other research groups who

     21 will be willing to work with us?

     22           I'm a little bit worried, and I
                                                 55



      1 am here in D.C. where I am a little bit

      2 insulated.  So I am interested in your

      3 perspective.

      4           MR. THOMAS:  I would think that

      5 would will not be a problem.  I think you

      6 will find there are folks that have been

      7 struggling in the academic world

      8 attempting to apply social science to

      9 voting technology, voting behavior.  And

     10 to be real frank, if you are a funding

     11 source for that, I believe that they will

     12 come.  And I believe though that what they

     13 will be looking for, perhaps as a result

     14 of the current controversy, is a clear

     15 road map as to what your procedures are,

     16 what the process of your review is, who

     17 owns the report at the end of the day, and

     18 all that.

     19           As I have talked to a few of

     20 these research folks, they have offered up

     21 the Bureau of Justice statistics, and

     22 Bureau of Labor statistics as models of
                                                 56



      1 organizations that work quite a bit with

      2 the academic communities, and have

      3 suggested that you all may find some good

      4 models, in terms of the collaborative

      5 efforts between the academic professor or

      6 person who you bring on board and your

      7 needs, in terms of having to review.

      8           So, yes, I think they are there,

      9 and I think they are there and have been

     10 really chumping at the bit to get into

     11 this.  I would note that there is a trust

     12 program.  You may see folks come out of

     13 the good work for that.

     14           We, in fact, in Michigan are

     15 exploring going for a grant along with the

     16 University of Michigan to study auditing,

     17 post election auditing.  So I think that

     18 the researchers are there.

     19           VICE-CHAIR RODRIGUEZ:  That's my

     20 only question right now, but as the

     21 discussion goes on.

     22           CHAIR DAVIDSON:  Sure.
                                                 57



      1 Commissioner.

      2           COMMISSIONER HUNTER:  Thank you,

      3 Madam Chair, and I also express my thanks

      4 for coming in for this meeting today.  I

      5 have a question for Ms. Nighswonger, and

      6 that is, you mentioned that the board,

      7 Standards Board, passed five resolutions

      8 in February.  And I want to get your

      9 comment on what you believe the EAC should

     10 be doing with those resolutions.

     11           Is it your opinion that there is

     12 good follow-up, and how can we best

     13 respond to the concerns of the Standards

     14 Board?

     15           MS. NIGHSWONGER:  Thank you for

     16 asking the question, because I think that

     17 the 110-member board certainly expects

     18 response or a follow-up to them.  I don't

     19 know if there was very good follow-up

     20 maybe after the first meeting where some

     21 resolutions were passed.  So I think that

     22 there could be some follow-up from the EAC
                                                 58



      1 to the board, maybe just some

      2 communication that goes out that you have

      3 the resolutions, you are looking at them,

      4 and I think the executive board can be a

      5 part in working with you on that, in

      6 making sure that information gets back to

      7 the full board about what you're doing

      8 with those resolutions, how you are

      9 considering them, if that answers your

     10 question.

     11           COMMISSIONER HUNTER:  Yes, it

     12 does.  Thank you.  May I ask another?

     13           CHAIR DAVIDSON:  Just to add to

     14 that, I think we've done one thing,

     15 especially with the TGDC.  Obviously, the

     16 people that sit on there is a lot of

     17 people.  It was mentioned that they wanted

     18 to have information, direct information,

     19 in working on the guidelines, the VVSG,

     20 but also we have put additional -- we're

     21 paying at the EAC to bring in an

     22 individual from the Standards Board and an
                                                 59



      1 individual from the Advisory Board to the

      2 meetings that we're having at NIST with

      3 the TGDC, so they will be there this next

      4 week.

      5           Also, they were at the last one,

      6 and they will be at the next one.  They

      7 help report back to the board, so it's one

      8 more point.  They are really sitting in

      9 the audience, but they get a perspective

     10 of what's going on, and help report back

     11 to them.  So that's one that I can say

     12 that we have improved upon since the

     13 resolution was done.

     14           COMMISSIONER HUNTER:  May I ask

     15 another question?  Another question is,

     16 the chemistry from both of our boards

     17 today is a little bit of why we are

     18 rushing.  Let's make sure that the

     19 standards are done in a manner that

     20 represents all of your collective

     21 concerns.  Christopher said, let's make

     22 sure that it's a key towards the next
                                                 60



      1 buying round, which I believe the machines

      2 last approximately six years.  So what

      3 would you say is the next time for the

      4 buying round?

      5           MR. THOMAS:  Well, a number of

      6 us began purchasing for the '04 election

      7 and some in '06.  You could be looking at

      8 as early as 2011, 2012, in that area, up

      9 to 2013.  That buying round is the current

     10 buying round going on, is I think --

     11 understand a number of states are looking

     12 to go to optical scan from the current

     13 DRE's, but that's going to happen pretty

     14 quickly.

     15           So I would key these along with

     16 Peggy said, are there critical things that

     17 need to be done right now.  Go ahead and

     18 do those that improve things for security

     19 issues and what not, but make sure that we

     20 have got a complete set and can put this

     21 to rest for a while.  And if they are in

     22 place within the next year or two, then I
                                                 61



      1 think manufacturers will have plenty of

      2 time to do their RD and be ready to go as

      3 that next buying round emerges sometime in

      4 2010, 2011.

      5           COMMISSIONER HUNTER:  Okay.

      6 Thank you.

      7           And one last question, if I may,

      8 Madam Chair, to Dr. Jeffrey, I have heard

      9 this within the office, but I didn't hear

     10 it in your testimony today, so I wanted to

     11 give you an opportunity to explain.  I am

     12 hearing that NIST is willing to stick

     13 around and help EAC.  In other words, you

     14 are not going to ship it to us and run off

     15 to the green pastures, which is -- thank

     16 you, very much, in this fact is true.

     17           Could you comment on not only

     18 that, but the decision -- Commissioner

     19 Rodriguez and I were not here when the

     20 decision was made to hand off the

     21 standards of the VVSG in July.  So could

     22 you talk about the decision -- something
                                                 62



      1 that's set in stone, are you willing to at

      2 least explore things that our boards may

      3 want a little bit more input before you

      4 hand it off.

      5           MR. JEFFREY:  Sure, we're

      6 absolutely sticking around.  We're tied to

      7 the hip with you.  When the VVSG 2005 came

      8 up, we continued to support the EAC's

      9 evaluation comments.  Absolutely, you have

     10 my commitment, just as TGDC, NIST

     11 director, that NIST will continue to

     12 provide whatever technical assistance we

     13 can to the EAC to make this as good a

     14 product as possible.

     15           In terms of the schedule, the

     16 schedule for July, 2007, seems to at best

     17 be agreed on between TGDC and EAC to meet

     18 deadlines discussed.  For example, if you

     19 follow-up and say within a year from now,

     20 do you really want these things

     21 essentially formalized so this gives the

     22 vendors time to produce that, given the
                                                 63



      1 number of the changes in the documents,

      2 you are going to need a public comment

      3 period of probably nine months to a year

      4 to assess public comments.  So really July

      5 is probably not a bad time frame.

      6           Now, having said that, we have a

      7 meeting next week and we skip a couple

      8 weeks.  We cannot give you a product

      9 before we feel confident that that's,

     10 essentially, the best product that we can

     11 give you.  We don't feel that there is an

     12 arbitrary that we absolutely have to meet.

     13           In terms of the comments about

     14 additional comment period, I actually may

     15 offer a hybrid model that we might

     16 consider that we'd be willing to use.  I

     17 do believe that the public comment period

     18 is going to be critical.  That's going to

     19 be the way to really get, in a very rapid

     20 amount of time, get comments from all of

     21 the possible constituents out there.  I

     22 think opening it up at that point will be
                                                 64



      1 great.  I think, in addition, getting

      2 additional comments from the two boards,

      3 obviously, we look forward to that.  And I

      4 think that when we provide you the next

      5 iteration of the VVSG, I would offer the

      6 technical staff of NIST, we have worked on

      7 this to go and spend as much time as

      8 necessary to walk both boards through all

      9 the details to make sure it's clear,

     10 unambiguous.  That would be a fast way of

     11 also expediting during the public comment

     12 period getting additional comments.

     13 We would be willing to do that.  We have a

     14 lot of invested time and energy in this.

     15           COMMISSIONER HUNTER:  Thank you.

     16 I think that's a good discussion.

     17           COMMISSIONER DAVIDSON:

     18 Commissioner Hillman.

     19           COMMISSIONER HILLMAN:  Let me

     20 start with the comment about the July,

     21 2007 delivery of the draft.  One of the

     22 things that I am sensitive to, and I need
                                                 65



      1 a little reality therapy from Ms.

      2 Nighswonger or Mr. Thomas, election

      3 officials made it very clear it's going to

      4 be very difficult for them to spend

      5 quality time reviewing the draft

      6 guidelines in 2008.  So part of the reason

      7 for wanting to get the draft posted this

      8 summer was so that election officials

      9 would have 2007 to weigh in with

     10 substantive comments and, therefore, 2008,

     11 the time needed for primaries and other

     12 elections through 2008 won't interfere

     13 with their interest and desire to

     14 participate in the review of the draft.

     15 But as I said, I need a little reality

     16 therapy back from the Standards Board and

     17 the Board of Advisors on that schedule.

     18 The Board of Advisors, maybe less so

     19 because, you have fewer election

     20 officials, but the Standards Board is all

     21 election officials.

     22           MS. NIGHSWONGER:  Right.  We had
                                                 66



      1 this discussion actually in Atlanta, if

      2 this is going to be taking place during

      3 the year 2008.  Most of us are just

      4 consumed.  And so your assessment is

      5 correct, before 2008.  Honestly, the 2008

      6 election begins in the fall of 2007

      7 because already you are just changing for

      8 the next year.  And if not then, then

      9 probably not until after 2008.

     10           COMMISSIONER HILLMAN:  I think

     11 that would be a real problem.  I don't

     12 think we can put this on hold for 18

     13 months.  I understand, don't rush, don't

     14 delay, but we have got to capture the

     15 input of our election officials.

     16           A lot of what drives the work

     17 schedules of EAC is trying to work around

     18 not only the federal election schedule but

     19 the election cycles that the election

     20 officials need to be involved in.

     21           Peggy, one of the committees

     22 that you forgot to mention that the
                                                 67



      1 Standards Board set up, we're calling it

      2 the VVSG Ad Hoc Committee.  That committee

      3 will be a committee of the Standards

      4 Board, will be working with the executive

      5 board to really figure out how the

      6 Standards Board can be thoroughly engaged

      7 in commenting on the draft VVSG between

      8 the time the draft document hits and the

      9 close of the public comment period,

     10 because one of the things that we were

     11 advised in, and I believe it's accurate,

     12 that comments from the Standards Board and

     13 the Board of Advisors would have to come

     14 to EAC during the public comment period,

     15 whether that public comment period is six

     16 months, eight months, or whatever that

     17 length of time is.  So we sort of have to

     18 kind of figure it out, and then we have to

     19 figure out when the Standards Board meets

     20 during that public comment period. So this

     21 is all a wonderful, logistical challenge.

     22           Chris, on the software
                                                 68



      1 certification issue, I just wanted to

      2 follow up with you a little bit.  It

      3 sounded like you were concerned about

      4 whether or not software submitted by

      5 vendors for testing and certification,

      6 that election officials believed or was

      7 required for the 2008 elections to be

      8 tested and certified within the prescribed

      9 time period.  And we're talking about

     10 software testing to the 2005 VVSG, is that

     11 what you were talking about?

     12           MR. THOMAS:  I think, likely, to

     13 2002.

     14           COMMISSIONER HILLMAN: 2002.  So

     15 what do you see as the delay on that?  I

     16 mean, vendors have known since 2004, 2003,

     17 that the 2002 standards have been out, and

     18 have known since 2005 that the 2005

     19 guidelines are out.  I'm not sure where

     20 the delay might kick up that is causing

     21 concern among election officials.

     22           MR. THOMAS:  I think the reality
                                                 69



      1 of how this works is like how legislatures

      2 look at the most recent election to fix

      3 the one coming up.

      4           Vendors also look at the most

      5 recent election and make software changes

      6 to correct those to improve their system.

      7 And to some extent, again, I will go back

      8 to Automark.  We're living in the reality

      9 there really was not the time under HAVA

     10 for newer systems to get fully RD'd and

     11 approved and out there without any bugs

     12 in them still prior to the '06.  I think

     13 that that time crunch, we're still all

     14 paying for it.  If you look around, there

     15 aren't a lot of new products that have

     16 been offered subsequent to the passage of

     17 HAVA, some improvement.

     18           So our discussions about

     19 software or with vendors about software is

     20 that they will always have a whole list of

     21 software changes that need to be made.

     22 And at some point, they have got to draw
                                                 70



      1 the line, freeze the frame, make the

      2 changes, and then get them submitted for

      3 testing.

      4           The issue is whether you are

      5 going for end to end testing, which is far

      6 more significant than if they were going

      7 for an upgrade testing.  Your decision was

      8 that they needed to do end to end, as you

      9 were not taking NASED's certificate

     10 forward and just allowing an upgrade to be

     11 discussed.

     12           I see that vendors have started

     13 to put their software in for testing.

     14 Much of that has just occurred quite

     15 recently, so within the last month or so.

     16 We're quite nervous.  They put it in.  I

     17 don't know when it comes out.  I know

     18 there's a lot of different factors; how

     19 many systems are there for testing, how

     20 well the software was done, how many times

     21 it has to go back and forth.  But for us

     22 to get new software in December, we
                                                 71



      1 haven't had a February 5th presidential

      2 primary.  I think a lot of us are going to

      3 be under a crunch to get new software

      4 installed in many cases.  In most cases,

      5 it is a physical installation.

      6           We have 4,500 machines out

      7 there.  We have got 1,500 -- or 5,000

      8 precincts with tabulators.  So there is a

      9 lot of logistics involved in moving that

     10 software out into the field.  So that was

     11 our concern.

     12           As I note, I see a few of them

     13 have come in and have started that

     14 process, which is good.  What we were

     15 hearing, again, that's a longer process

     16 than an upgrade would be in the future

     17 because they have to go back and do full

     18 end to end.

     19           I am not really here to argue

     20 with your decision on that.  I understand

     21 it.  I was involved in the NASED program,

     22 and I think we did what needed to be done
                                                 72



      1 at the time.  And my hats off to

      2 Congressman Allard (Sic) for inviting NIST

      3 into this process, and I think they have

      4 done a wonderful job, in terms of raising

      5 the bar in the confidence that we all and

      6 the public have with these systems, but

      7 there is a time crunch we're under right

      8 now.

      9           With regard to your first

     10 question in terms of timing, while I think

     11 we can get a significant jump in '07 on

     12 these and I think we can continue into '08

     13 at some technical level, but by the end of

     14 '07, we can get a feel as to which parts

     15 of the guidelines really need to be

     16 focused on that and use this time to

     17 really narrow that down and really focus

     18 in.  And perhaps through this Commission,

     19 we can see some research done on the

     20 implications of these guidelines with

     21 regard to the voting systems themselves.

     22           COMMISSIONER HILLMAN:  Okay.
                                                 73



      1 Thank you.

      2           Peggy, at some point in the

      3 middle of your testimony, you wanted your

      4 comments to be reflective of your position

      5 as state election director, but I am

      6 wondering if you think that the sentiments

      7 that you shared with us and the

      8 observations and recommendations would be

      9 generally reflected by the Standards

     10 Board?

     11           MS. NIGHSWONGER:  Absolutely,

     12 yes.

     13           COMMISSIONER HILLMAN:  Thank

     14 you.

     15           And then my last question for

     16 Dr. Jeffrey, and it's actually a

     17 conversation that I'd like to see happen

     18 among the three of you, so let me

     19 instigate this a little bit, and that is a

     20 comment that I believe Chris Thomas has

     21 made about the density and technical

     22 aspects of the guidelines, and how the
                                                 74



      1 guidelines can be written in a way that

      2 election officials, particularly election

      3 officials at the local level, appreciate

      4 and embrace and not be afraid of.  It

      5 would be a shame if only a handful of the

      6 7,000 or so election officials in this

      7 country embrace Florida that as an useful

      8 tool.  And so I don't know what that means

      9 with respect to the language that's used

     10 and how it doesn't diminish the technical

     11 requirements and what protocols that need

     12 to be in place for the standards, but also

     13 how these standards can be different

     14 because of who is using them, not only

     15 manufacturers and testing labs, but

     16 election officials in particular.

     17           Now, the management guidelines

     18 EAC will produce will help, to some

     19 extent, on that, but this is really sort

     20 of a conversation among the three of you,

     21 if you could start.

     22           MR. JEFFREY:  I'd be happy to
                                                 75



      1 start.  Certainly, there is a creative

      2 tension between insuring the absolute

      3 accuracy and precision one needs for

      4 standards versus what I'll call the good

      5 literature.  And some of that will be

      6 captivating, made into a good movie.

      7 Certainly, the document is not the latter,

      8 emphasizing very much precision language

      9 and being very concrete what needs to be

     10 required, what needs to be tested.

     11           Having said that, it's unlike

     12 any kind of standards document that's out

     13 there in the sense that it is

     14 intentionally drafted.  It is very

     15 different from the 2005.  It is

     16 intentionally drafted to be more

     17 accessible to non-technical experts in the

     18 field. It's been -- the formal language

     19 has been reviewed by the board, and its

     20 gotten very high marks, in terms of its

     21 comprehensibility to non-experts, but

     22 first and foremost, it is geared towards
                                                 76



      1 vendors, test groups, who have to be

      2 absolutely unambiguous as to what it

      3 means.  It won't make great literature,

      4 but I think it actually goes a long way to

      5 being accessible.

      6           MR. THOMAS:  Well, as a lawyer,

      7 I won't hold people to a double standard

      8 in terms of writing in English.  I

      9 absolutely understand that these standards

     10 or guidelines need to be written in

     11 technical terms.  I am not suggesting they

     12 try to do otherwise.  Likewise, I don't

     13 see election officials as a major audience

     14 of the standards.

     15           We will deal with the results of

     16 the standards.  As Dr. Jeffrey indicates,

     17 it's really the manufacturers, the testing

     18 labs that are going to have to deal with

     19 this.  So that's where I come back in:

     20 Tell us what the implications are, what

     21 does this standard do that wasn't done

     22 before, how has this standard changed,
                                                 77



      1 where does this take us, in terms of

      2 really changing the world in this area.

      3 And I'll come back to what are the cost

      4 benefit analysis of these changes.

      5           And I really think that from an

      6 election official, that's what we need to

      7 understand, not just the money end, but

      8 what are the implications of the standard.

      9 I don't expect that I'm going to

     10 understand, even if it's well written in

     11 English, and I'm sure with folks involved

     12 with access and what not, they can do a

     13 nice job.  But I'm really looking as an

     14 administrator at what's different, what

     15 are the implications, and how much is it

     16 going to cost.

     17           MS. NIGHSWONGER:  And I would

     18 agree with that because we're going to

     19 have to administer.  I am not technical,

     20 but in just reading through a draft that I

     21 saw a few weeks ago on even the

     22 definitions, I was like I don't think that
                                                 78



      1 is the definition of a general election.

      2 So I think just in using election

      3 officials to get their input about even

      4 something simple like the definitions, I

      5 think that we can utilize a little more --

      6 not technically maybe, but just their

      7 understanding the language.

      8           MR. JEFFREY:  One thing I will

      9 add, in terms of the changes, there is

     10 actually an entire chapter called,

     11 specifically, changes from the 2005 to

     12 2007, basically representing your first

     13 comment, which is written for the vendors

     14 and testing labs.  It's not the most

     15 fascinating read, but it has in one place

     16 a compilation of the major changes.  So

     17 you can get an idea what that is.

     18           Again, I reiterate my offer that

     19 we would be happy to have the technical

     20 folks come forward and sort through what

     21 the technical changes are and help

     22 understand what the implications.

      1           MR. THOMAS:  And I think you may

      2 find that too within your management

      3 guidelines.  In other words, do these

      4 affect guidelines, how we run elections,

      5 what is the impact there, do those have to

      6 be changed or modified in order to

      7 instruct election officials on how to

      8 operate this agreement in the real world

      9 of elections.

     10           COMMISSIONER HILLMAN:  I think

     11 my final point, it's my understanding that

     12 the Board of Advisors is likely to also

     13 set up a committee to help plan its

     14 exercise of reviewing the draft

     15 guidelines.

     16           MR. THOMAS:  Yes, that's

     17 correct, we're in the process of doing

     18 that, and will find your virtual meeting

     19 as a real helpful tool for us.

     20           COMMISSIONER HILLMAN:  And I

     21 think between the two committees and

     22 hopefully their will be points in time we
                                                 80



      1 will all have joint conference call

      2 meetings or whatever.  But I think the

      3 point that you made is excellent about

      4 tell us what the impact is, tell us, in

      5 election administrative terms, what the

      6 impact is.

      7           CHAIR DAVIDSON:  Okay.  I'm

      8 going to ask a couple questions.  First of

      9 all, taking it a step further, the

     10 question was really talking about earlier,

     11 Chris, that you talked about the testing

     12 and the end to end testing on the 2002.

     13 And that's the equipment that was utilized

     14 in the election of 2006; correct?

     15           MR. THOMAS:  Yes.

     16           CHAIR DAVIDSON:  The equipment

     17 that's been brought in right now, end to

     18 end, because they are wanting it certified

     19 either to 2002 and 2005.  One is asking

     20 for the 2005.  So in doing that, as you

     21 stated in your testimony, there is a lot

     22 of changes that were made from the
                                                 81



      1 election that was held in 2000.  So it's

      2 not the same.  We'll say it is the same

      3 hardware for 2002, but it's not the same

      4 software.  It's an upgrade to that

      5 software that they found and the issues in

      6 the last election or improvement.

      7           Am I correct on that; is that

      8 the way you really are wanting to state

      9 that?  Would you explain that?

     10           MR. THOMAS:  Yes.  I think that

     11 generally is correct.  There may be a few

     12 hardware changes, but by and large, they

     13 are software enhancements.  For example,

     14 with Automark the major change there is

     15 that in our state, we have stubs on our

     16 ballots.  When the stubs are detached,

     17 there is a perforation.  If that

     18 perforation is too course, the Automark

     19 has a difficulty in recognizing the edge

     20 of that ballot to tell us that you can see

     21 this ballot and you can flip this ballot

     22 over and print the back side now.  They
                                                 82



      1 have made software charges changes there

      2 to lower those tolerances so that

      3 perforation is not going to be the problem

      4 we saw it to be in '06.

      5           I would guess every vendor has

      6 some aspect similar to that where they

      7 have an '06 or before issue that are

      8 currently in their software submissions.

      9 So the systems you are seeing come in are

     10 not the same systems from beginning to end

     11 that were certified prior to this year,

     12 but I think that's accurate.

     13           CHAIR DAVIDSON:  I think there

     14 is a misunderstanding in the community

     15 from the public, in some ways, that they

     16 feel like we're bringing in what was used

     17 in 2006 and having it retested.  My

     18 understanding is it is an improved

     19 version, we will say of what was utilized

     20 in 2006.  And so we're not going to be

     21 testing exactly what was utilized then.

     22 It's an improved version.
                                                 83



      1           MR. THOMAS:  That's correct, it

      2 won't be exact.

      3           CHAIR DAVIDSON:  In some cases,

      4 we will say.

      5           MR. THOMAS:  Right.

      6           CHAIR DAVIDSON:  All right.  I

      7 appreciate that.  Another thing that you

      8 talked about is the Denver meeting.  You

      9 both gave high praises for that meeting.

     10           I will turn to you Peggy.  What

     11 is the next step?  You are saying we need

     12 more information on the cost of whatever

     13 the cost might be for testing.  We need to

     14 understand the cost of equipment.

     15 Obviously, that means we have all the

     16 players at the table.

     17           What do you recommend for the

     18 EAC as our next step?

     19           MR. THOMAS:  I would see if

     20 there is some sort of ongoing -- not every

     21 month, but ongoing dialogue that was

     22 started at that meeting.  As state folks,
                                                 84



      1 we can sit back, but we did enjoy watching

      2 this discussion between scientists who are

      3 working to improve labs and also who have

      4 been in the business a long time, along

      5 with the labs, along with actual

      6 developers.  I believe Diebold actually

      7 had their developer at the table.

      8           It was a fascinating discussion.

      9 As I indicated, I was surprised to see the

     10 number of disagreements over some fairly

     11 -- what I would think would be easy things

     12 to discern.  In other words, how do you

     13 tell what version control one is working

     14 on, how is that book marked on the

     15 software.

     16           So I think next steps would move

     17 in that direction, with movement towards

     18 indications of the standards themselves.

     19           CHAIR DAVIDSON:  Peggy, would

     20 you like to add anything?

     21           MS. NIGHSWONGER:  Briefly.  At

     22 this meeting, the minimum funded states,
                                                 85



      1 of which I am one, I think we feel like we

      2 just don't have the resources to do

      3 sophisticated testing and certification

      4 programs.  And so there was discussion at

      5 this meeting about consortium, mainly a

      6 western region where we would all kind of

      7 do -- and I think I realized I was going

      8 to be thrown in with California, and I

      9 said I don't want to be that consortium.

     10 No offense, but I think it kind of gave

     11 some more discussion about how it was all

     12 to be handled.  And I do think that as you

     13 all take a role in looking at something,

     14 more on the federal level, that would give

     15 assistance, especially to small states,

     16 with the way they do certification and

     17 testing.  Because right now, I feel like

     18 we're sort of out there doing things that

     19 we probably could use a little more help

     20 with.

     21           So I think it will be nice to

     22 have more discussion around the table that
                                                 86



      1 we had in Denver and get more ideas about

      2 that.  It was profitable.

      3           CHAIR DAVIDSON:  Dr. Jeffrey, in

      4 your testimony, you talked about the 2005

      5 VVSG was with controlled access, and

      6 really very controlled.  The counties and

      7 states could use wireless, mainly for

      8 election night results, wireless back into

      9 we'll say a county facility for that

     10 location, but the RF or radio frequency

     11 wiring should be prohibited entirely will

     12 be in the new version.

     13           Can you, in common terms,

     14 describe for this group -- and it had to

     15 happen to me, so that's the reason I am

     16 asking you to do it for everybody else,

     17 what you are exactly talking about when

     18 you talk about radio frequency, because I

     19 think it's really not a well understood

     20 term.

     21           MR. JEFFREY:  Absolutely, and I

     22 will avoid -- this is what I mean.  This
                                                 87



      1 is a Blackberry or cell phone.  It

      2 communicates through radio frequencies.

      3 Your radio in the car, in the home, that

      4 communicates through that.  It means that

      5 the information goes through walls.  While

      6 we're sitting here, I got 20 e-mails.  I

      7 didn't know I got them.  So information

      8 can be passed through the device without

      9 you knowing that it was updated.  Software

     10 could be updated.  Again, it could be from

     11 anywhere outside of this group, and that's

     12 why in the new version, if specifically

     13 that's a vulnerability to the system,

     14 where you don't have knowledge of who

     15 might be sending information and where it

     16 could be coming from.  Does that help?

     17           CHAIR DAVIDSON:  That certainly

     18 does.  Thank you.

     19           Any other questions?

     20           VICE-CHAIR RODRIGUEZ:  Just one

     21 follow-up.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  It's

     22 becoming pretty important, this
                                                 88



      1 translation into English, of these

      2 documents is really on my mind right now.

      3 And we actually do not have someone in our

      4 contract to do that.  And I wonder if we

      5 could prevail upon the three of you and

      6 possibly one of the advocates from public

      7 interest groups that was on the Denver

      8 trip to review names and resumes of people

      9 we might contract with to help us with

     10 that, and then see if we could get your

     11 empyemata.

     12           CHAIR DAVIDSON:  If we can have

     13 Dr. Jeffrey -- I think part of what they

     14 are doing really does give us that part.

     15 If you could explain further what they are

     16 doing at NIST.

     17           MR. JEFFREY:  We actually have

     18 somebody under contract and are hoping to

     19 translate a lot of this into -- again, I

     20 hate to use the word English.

     21           COMMISSIONER HILLMAN:  Election

     22 ease.
                                                 89



      1           MR. JEFFREY:  Exactly.  It's not

      2 a fascinating work of literature, but we

      3 do have somebody under contract helping to

      4 do that.  Hopefully, the procedure that we

      5 provide you will go a long way to meeting

      6 those goals.  If may not go as far as you

      7 would like, but we would certainly be glad

      8 to give you names of who we're currently

      9 using and examples of where we want to go.

     10           The important thing we need to

     11 make sure is that the process of

     12 translation into something more

     13 accessible, that it doesn't inadvertently

     14 change the technical substance, which is

     15 why it's never going to be great

     16 literature.

     17           VICE-CHAIR RODRIGUEZ:  Thank

     18 you.  I appreciate that point.  Thank you.

     19           CHAIR DAVIDSON:  Did you want to

     20 add anything, either one of you?  You're

     21 okay.  Commissioner Hillman, do you have

     22 any additional questions?
                                                 90



      1           COMMISSIONER HILLMAN:  No, I

      2 don't.  Thank you.

      3           CHAIR DAVIDSON:  I don't believe

      4 I have any additional questions, but the

      5 one statement I think that we heard from

      6 you two, you really feel there needs to be

      7 time.  Because if I understand you right,

      8 this is a complete rewrite this time, and

      9 you don't feel 90 days is enough time for

     10 a comment period, because the last one

     11 was, obviously, much shorter, or less

     12 changes to the VVSG, and this one is a

     13 complete rewrite, so you feel you need

     14 more time, even with it being an election

     15 year and moving forward.

     16           Okay.  I appreciate that, and

     17 thank you, committee, for all of our

     18 chairs.  Thank you, very much for your

     19 testimony, and we appreciate it.

     20           CHAIR DAVIDSON:  Take just a

     21 second and bring Brian Hancock up.  While

     22 Brian Hancock is getting settled here, I
                                                 91



      1 think you have heard us several times say

      2 that he's got over twenty years of

      3 experience in the arena of election

      4 administration and voting certification.

      5 Obviously, Brian, we definitely appreciate

      6 it.  It sounds like your idea to host the

      7 meeting in Denver, and you were very

      8 successful in doing that.  So you have

      9 reached the first step of your goal,

     10 obviously, in your testimony.  And later,

     11 I think it would be interesting to see how

     12 you feel.

     13           We should be moving forward in

     14 the future to be able to accomplish some

     15 of the things that we feel we need to

     16 accomplish.  I'm going to turn it over to

     17 you for your testimony.

     18           MR. HANCOCK:  Thank you, Madam

     19 Chair, and Commissioners.  It is my

     20 pleasure to give you a summary of what

     21 went on in Denver a few weeks ago.

     22 And you certainly heard some of the
                                                 92



      1 highlights from Mr. Thomas and Ms.

      2 Nighswonger, but I will get into a little

      3 more, better detail.

      4           On April 30th and May 1st, the

      5 EAC did convene a meeting in Denver,

      6 Colorado to discuss voting system testing

      7 cost and factors associated with such

      8 testing.  Invited participates represented

      9 a cross section of interested parties,

     10 including state election officials, voting

     11 system test labs, members of our boards,

     12 of course, staff from NIST, and NAVLAP,

     13 voting system manufacturers, public

     14 interest groups, group representatives,

     15 etc, state testers and guess speakers, the

     16 technology division chief from the Nevada

     17 Gaming Commission.

     18           Discussion sessions were led by

     19 individuals from each of the major groups

     20 represented, and they definitely, I think,

     21 as you heard, proceeded in a very lively

     22 and free-flowing give and take, over the
                                                 93



      1 course of the two days.

      2           State election officials

      3 expressed numerous concerns, including the

      4 lack of both financial and human resources

      5 when conducting state certificate testing.

      6 Smaller states, as you heard from Ms.

      7 Nighswonger, were particularly concerned

      8 with this ongoing lack of resources.

      9 State representatives were also concerned

     10 about cost associated with duplicating

     11 some of the tests conducted at the

     12 national level.

     13           California noted that testing

     14 costs in that state have increased tenfold

     15 since the enactment of the Help America

     16 Vote Act.  This cost for California did

     17 not include the approximately $150,000 for

     18 going parallel testing of two different

     19 systems in a handful of counties.  This

     20 was also prior to the presently enacted

     21 top down review of voting systems ordered

     22 by the Secretary of State.
                                                 94



      1           When asked if additional funding

      2 is the answer to these concerns, state

      3 representatives said that funding might

      4 help with state level testing, but an even

      5 bigger problem was local acceptance

      6 testing.  At the local level, the lack of

      7 trained human resources, especially in

      8 small rural jurisdictions often in the

      9 past, has forced the election officials to

     10 rely on manufacturers' assistance in this

     11 process, which we all know is not the

     12 proper way to do this.

     13           The test laboratory

     14 representative discussed the cost

     15 associated with the NAVLAP review and how

     16 they structured their pricing.  Both EAC

     17 accredited labs do bill the manufacturers

     18 on a time and materials basis for the vast

     19 majority of testing conducted.  Full cost

     20 of system testing appears to be dependent

     21 on three things from the labs' point of

     22 view:  One, the number of lines of source
                                                 95



      1 code reviewed.  Two, the amount of costs

      2 with the system.  And three, the maturity

      3 of the system, meaning certainly, new

      4 systems will generally take longer to test

      5 than more developed systems will.

      6           Cost associated.  NAVLAP,

      7 include a $4,500 application, $5,500

      8 one-time fee, and on-site assessments cost

      9 of approximately $15,000 for each two-year

     10 reevaluation of their initial

     11 accreditation.  Ramp up cost for one of

     12 our new labs, Ibeta, to meet the

     13 requirements of the NAVLAP review were

     14 estimated to be between 75 and $100,000.

     15 And they stated that that took

     16 approximately 1,500 staff hours to

     17 complete.

     18           The voting systems manufacturers

     19 noted the biggest impact on their cost for

     20 system testing was when and how often

     21 standards or guidelines are updated, and

     22 the impact of the new EAC program.  One
                                                 96



      1 manufacturers noted that their costs

      2 testing to 1990 voting system standards

      3 was about $100,000.  Cost of their testing

      4 to the 2002 voting system standards was

      5 over $200,000, and the costs of testing to

      6 the 2005 VVSG were expected to be between

      7 $400,000 and $800,000.

      8           Although none of the

      9 manufacturers ventured a guess as to

     10 possible cost of testing to the next

     11 iteration of the VVSG, they all agreed

     12 these costs would likely be from six to

     13 ten times the cost of testing to the 2005

     14 VVSG.  Several manufacturers suggested

     15 that a cost benefit analysis be done for

     16 each new iteration to identify testing

     17 costs.

     18           One manufacturers also noted

     19 that the cost for state testing for his

     20 particular organization in saying they

     21 divide states into, essentially, three

     22 categories, those states in which testing
                                                 97



      1 costs are between 100 and $500,000, those

      2 states that cost over $5,000 but less than

      3 $100,000, and those states that cost less

      4 than $5,000 to conduct state certificate

      5 testing.

      6           Representatives from voter

      7 groups noted that transparency of the

      8 process was the most important aspect,

      9 from their point of view.  Both

     10 representatives thought that the new EAC

     11 program generally addressed a number of

     12 their transparency concerns and

     13 acknowledged that a balance needs to be

     14 found between the increased security of

     15 voting machines and the cost of making

     16 those machines secure.

     17           Our panel of state experts noted

     18 that the cost of state certificate testing

     19 was to make sure that a system is suitable

     20 for use in the particular state and that a

     21 state also can be run on that voting

     22 system.  They also noted that local
                                                 98



      1 acceptance testing should be properly

      2 funded, resourced, and made as simple and

      3 affordable as possible.  They also agreed

      4 that when a voting system received federal

      5 certification, states should have

      6 confidence that the only additional thing

      7 they needed to test would be whether that

      8 system will function as required within

      9 their individual states.

     10           Our guest from the Nevada Gaming

     11 Commission spoke about the similarities in

     12 certification in elections and the gaming

     13 industry.  He was quick to point out that

     14 he was not trying to equate gambling with

     15 voting, only that both industries had

     16 similarities issues and challenges

     17 regulating the industry and compliance.

     18 He noted stakes were high in both areas

     19 regarding user trust and confidence, the

     20 proper implementation of innovations in

     21 the field, and the proper implementation

     22 of security.  As background, he noted that
                                                 99



      1 the revenues collected by the Gaming

      2 Commission generate 32 percent of the

      3 budget for the State of Nevada.  The

      4 Gaming Commission was responsible for the

      5 continuing certification of 215,000 slot

      6 machines and other gaming devices in 12

      7 major manufacturers and hundreds of

      8 smaller manufacturers.

      9           The Gaming Commission was also

     10 responsible for over 2,400 casinos'

     11 operation rate force. It was last stated

     12 that the Gaming Commission is a part-time

     13 board, making final decisions on all

     14 matters, with a full-time staff of 405

     15 individuals, including 60 in the

     16 technology and testing branch, 120

     17 auditors, and 60 investigators.  The

     18 commission has found from 50 years of

     19 experience that new system approval still

     20 takes between six and 18 months, depending

     21 on the described circumstances, with a

     22 fixed testing cost of about $150 per hour.
                                                100



      1 To make it all work, the Gaming Commission

      2 notes no one aspect of oversight is

      3 enough.  They may rely on compliance with

      4 technical standards, examination of people

      5 and organizations.  They must continue to

      6 verify those people, organizations, and

      7 systems, and continually examine the

      8 physical security component of all

      9 systems.

     10           In conclusion, the meeting

     11 produced several recurring themes that

     12 participants suggested, and I think some

     13 of what you will hear from me reflects

     14 what Mr. Thomas and Ms. Nighswonger talked

     15 about earlier.

     16           One, the involvement of

     17 development of a matrix comparing

     18 requirements of federal certification and

     19 state certification. I would note this

     20 would eliminate unnecessary overlapping in

     21 most instances.

     22           Two, was a request for an
                                                101



      1 additional formal cooperation between

      2 states and EAC to explore specific ways to

      3 reduce duplication in testing, and push as

      4 much testing up to the federal level as

      5 possible, specifically, as Mr. Thomas

      6 noted, the very expensive volume testing.

      7           Three, that the EAC should

      8 facilitate information sharing with and

      9 among states, the EAC should document best

     10 practices in state and local acceptance

     11 testing, and translate the best practices

     12 in a saleable way so they can be used by

     13 all jurisdictions, and then, of course,

     14 share this information.

     15           Next, provide the manufacturers

     16 with a seat at the table when standards

     17 and guidelines are being developed, as is

     18 done in other industries.

     19           And finally, the EAC, TGDC, and

     20 NIST, should provide an estimated

     21 implementation cost with each new

     22 iteration of the VVSG, as you have already
                                                102



      1 heard this morning.

      2           And before closing, I do need to

      3 thank the other EAC staff that helped put

      4 this meeting together and were very

      5 instrumental in making it happen; Gavin

      6 Gilmore and others.

      7           With that, I'd be happy to take

      8 any questions that you might have.

      9           COMMISSIONER HUNTER:  I don't

     10 have any questions at this time.

     11           VICE-CHAIR RODRIGUEZ:  No

     12 questions.  Maybe a comment.  I think it's

     13 apparent from the Nevada Gaming Commission

     14 that we might be under resourced for the

     15 size of job that you all are doing.

     16           MR. HANCOCK:  Well, the one

     17 thing they did note is they have been in

     18 existence for 50 years.  They didn't start

     19 out at that level, but over the course of

     20 the years, did feel they needed that level

     21 of staffing.

     22           VICE-CHAIR RODRIGUEZ:  I got the
                                                103



      1 point.

      2           CHAIR DAVIDSON:  Commissioner

      3 Hillman.

      4           COMMISSIONER HILLMAN:  My

      5 question is actually sort of a follow-up

      6 to Commissioner Rodriguez's question, but

      7 I'm wondering if any of what the Gaming

      8 Commission shared would be a constant for

      9 EAC.  For example, the $150 an hour, the

     10 six to 18 months.  I know the rest of it

     11 would have to be scaled with respect to

     12 the number of manufacturers that could at

     13 any one time be presenting their hardware

     14 or software for testing, as well as the

     15 number of different types of machines and

     16 equipment that would be coming before us.

     17           But I wondered if you were able

     18 to determine if the hourly cost and the

     19 length of time was applicable, different?

     20           MR. HANCOCK:  Well, I think at

     21 least what we've seen in the voting system

     22 testing up to this point and what they
                                                104



      1 found in their gaming testing, the time

      2 that the testing seems to be fairly

      3 closely related, that did seem to be a

      4 very close fit.  The $150 per hour cost of

      5 testing, there is a major difference there

      6 that.  I didn't know that the Gaming

      7 Commission has their own testing

      8 laboratory and does all testing in-house

      9 and they are funded by the state.

     10           They do meet some cost savings

     11 there under the current structure we

     12 cannot meet, but I do think there is room

     13 for more discussions with that

     14 organization, simply because they have 50

     15 years of experience doing this, and as the

     16 speaker noted, they have run into many of

     17 the problems that we seem to be running

     18 into in this field.

     19           It was very interesting.  I

     20 think people that were there would note

     21 that, often times, we are so hyper focused

     22 on what we're doing in this field.  So
                                                105



      1 with other nose to the grindstone, we

      2 ignore the fact other people might be

      3 doing this.  So it was very enlightening

      4 to know there are more people with more

      5 problems out there.

      6           COMMISSIONER HILLMAN:  Okay.  A

      7 question which might actually need to go

      8 to the general counsel, but there have

      9 been concerns expressed from the public

     10 and from members of the Congress about

     11 manufacturers paying the testing

     12 laboratories directly for the work that is

     13 done to test their equipment and software,

     14 and being able to self select which

     15 laboratory among the accredited would do

     16 the testing.

     17           I'm just wondering if we know if

     18 there has been any effort to introduce

     19 legislation that would fund EAC to pay

     20 those costs?

     21           MS. HODGKINS:  Sure.

     22 Commissioner Hillman.  In HRA-11, which
                                                106



      1 was marked up last week, and actually a

      2 substitute was offered to the house

      3 administration committee, there is a

      4 provision that would provide for an escrow

      5 account.  It would be the holder of funds

      6 transmitted from the vendors to the

      7 laboratories.  We would hold those funds

      8 in escrow and distribute them to the labs.

      9 We would also select the labs on as random

     10 a basis as is possible.

     11           COMMISSIONER HILLMAN:  Okay.

     12 Thank you, very much.

     13           MS. HODGKINS:  And TGDC provide

     14 an unspecified amount of money to EAC for

     15 the activities that we would have to

     16 undertake in administering that account.

     17           COMMISSIONER HILLMAN:  Did you

     18 say unspecified or unlimited, blank check?

     19           MS. HODGKINS:  Unspecified, in

     20 that there is no dollar amount there.  So

     21 I will let you draw your own conclusion as

     22 to what that means.
                                                107



      1           COMMISSIONER HILLMAN:  All

      2 right.  Two other questions.  One of our

      3 earlier panelists, and I don't remember if

      4 it was Chris Thomas or Peggy Nighswonger,

      5 mentioned about the manufacturers having a

      6 seat at the table when EAC is considering,

      7 you know, voting system guidelines and

      8 testing certificate protocols, so on and

      9 so forth, since they have a major stake in

     10 this.

     11           I just wondered the extent to

     12 which -- again, maybe this is a general

     13 counsel in part question -- that there are

     14 any rules or regulations or conflict of

     15 interests.

     16           I know that HAVA doesn't owe a

     17 lot the seat at the table to a

     18 manufacturer, but I just wondered if there

     19 was anything that would prohibit that?

     20           MR. HANCOCK:  I do not know if

     21 there is anything that would specifically

     22 prohibit that, but I'll leave the legal
                                                108



      1 research to our general counsel.

      2           COMMISSIONER HILLMAN:  Do you

      3 want a minute?  I can ask another

      4 question.

      5           MS. HODGKINS:  Just give me 30

      6 seconds.  So go ahead and ask your next

      7 question.

      8           COMMISSIONER HILLMAN:  Going

      9 back to the executive director's report,

     10 he talked about the first test plan

     11 submitted.  And my memory needed to be

     12 refreshed as to what this was, and what

     13 that meant.

     14           MR. HANCOCK:  The test plan is,

     15 essentially, the guide, the plan for how

     16 the test lab will test a very specific

     17 voting system to the standards that they

     18 are being tested against.  It's an outline

     19 and it shows exactly how the testing will

     20 be conducted.

     21           COMMISSIONER HILLMAN:  And who

     22 submits the plan?
                                                109



      1           MR. HANCOCK:  The test lab

      2 submits the plan.

      3           COMMISSIONER HILLMAN:  So each

      4 test lab submits the plan it is going to

      5 use then?

      6           MR. HANCOCK:  Each test lab will

      7 submit a voting system.

      8           COMMISSIONER HILLMAN:  So the

      9 first test plan was submitted by who?

     10           MR. HANCOCK:  I believe it was

     11 by Ibeta.

     12           CHAIR DAVIDSON:  I need to add,

     13 isn't it true that in our guidelines, that

     14 they would not have to give us a test plan

     15 prior to them testing.  Can you explain

     16 that; it's not a mandate that we have a

     17 test plan before they can start that

     18 process, is it?

     19           MR. HANCOCK:  Well, while it's

     20 not specified, we do know very

     21 specifically that if any testing is done

     22 prior to the submission of a test plan, it
                                                110



      1 is at the risk of the vendor because we do

      2 review the test plans.  And should we find

      3 some deficiencies with those test plans,

      4 those tests would need to be redone at the

      5 cost of the vendor.

      6           CHAIR DAVIDSON:  So it really

      7 benefits the individual that's being

      8 tested to make sure that the lab has a

      9 test plan in place?

     10           MR. HANCOCK:  Absolutely.  It is

     11 not an entirely linear process.  There is

     12 work that can be done  in advance.  The

     13 technical data package is often hundreds

     14 and hundreds and maybe thousands of pages

     15 of literature to review before the actual

     16 testing gets started.  And things like

     17 that can be accomplished, to some degree,

     18 ahead of time, but I certainly would agree

     19 with you that it behooves everybody to get

     20 the test plan in as early as possible.

     21           CHAIR DAVIDSON:  The other

     22 question I have, I asked earlier to Chris,
                                                111



      1 how he would suggest that we proceed in

      2 trying to accomplish what really the

      3 election community would like for us to

      4 accomplish.  We have talked about even

      5 having some forms of some sort of another

      6 with manufacturers to talk about, and I

      7 know you have done this in the past, but

      8 to talk about the cost of what is the new

      9 iteration going to cost to develop, trying

     10 to get a handle on costs in several

     11 different areas; the cost of the

     12 equipment, the cost of testing.

     13           How do you see the EAC -- what's

     14 the next steps; what do you think that we

     15 should be doing?

     16           MR. HANCOCK:  Well, I do think,

     17 as you heard this morning, there were some

     18 recurring themes.  And some of those, I

     19 think staff can work on, if the Commission

     20 wishes.  We really should do that, to

     21 present options to the Commission.

     22 Everything that we do, of course, has
                                                112



      1 budget and resouces impact.  We certainly

      2 may not be able to do everything, but

      3 there are a lot of cooperative things that

      4 we can do.

      5           We can work with our boards,

      6 work with the interest groups.  We can

      7 convene, meet also like this, to gain

      8 input, I think, to sit all the interested

      9 parties at the same table.  To my

     10 knowledge, that's the first time anything

     11 like that has been done recently.  As you

     12 heard, it was very beneficial for

     13 everyone.

     14           At the very minimum, those are

     15 some things that we can do.

     16           COMMISSIONER HILLMAN:  I'm

     17 sorry.  If I could just get the response

     18 from counsel.

     19           CHAIR DAVIDSON:  Okay.

     20           MS. HODGKINS:  Let me just

     21 repeat the question for everyone.  The

     22 question, as I understood it, from
                                                113



      1 Commissioner Hillman was whether or not

      2 there was anything in HAVA that prohibits

      3 EAC from allowing a seat on the TGDC to a

      4 vendor.

      5           COMMISSIONER HILLMAN:  Or in any

      6 of our other working group tables,

      7 whatever we do, in addition to TGDC.

      8           MS. HODGKINS:  Well, let me

      9 start with HAVA.  HAVA, obviously,

     10 specifies to some degree the membership of

     11 the TGDC, requires that it be a 15-member

     12 panel.  Currently, all seats are filled.

     13           CHAIR DAVIDSON:  We have a

     14 vacancy that just occurred.

     15           MS. HODGKINS:  Okay.  I believe

     16 all about four of those seats are filled

     17 in a representative capacity, and that is,

     18 the persons who serve there represent some

     19 other agency or organization that is

     20 specifically identified in the law.

     21           However, there are four

     22 positions that EAC and NIST jointly
                                                114



      1 appoint to the committee, and those

      2 persons must have expertise, either of a

      3 technical nature or scientific nature,

      4 related to voting systems and voting

      5 equipment.

      6           I believe it's a pretty safe

      7 assumption to say that voting system

      8 vendors could have technical expertise

      9 with regard to voting equipment, so I

     10 don't think there would be any prohibition

     11 for one of those four seats being held by

     12 a person who was a member of the vendor

     13 community.

     14           That being said, I do believe

     15 those four seats are currently filled, so

     16 that would require action on the part of

     17 EAC and NIST, if you were to pre place one

     18 of the members that is currently holding

     19 those seats.

     20           As to the other boards, their

     21 membership is much more specified in terms

     22 of the Standards Board and Board of
                                                115



      1 Advisors, and I don't think that would be

      2 as easy a possibility to put together

      3 there.  Working groups are a little

      4 easier, in terms of informal working

      5 groups.  Technically those where we're

      6 soliciting individual opinions as opposed

      7 to the group opinion, if you will, of a

      8 board or committee such as the TGDC,

      9 Standards Board, or Board of Advisors.

     10 Each of those is a federal advisory and

     11 you are asking for their consensus as

     12 opposed to their individual opinions, so

     13 it's much easier for that participation on

     14 the working group, but not impossible, to

     15 have this provision in the TGDC.

     16           COMMISSIONER HILLMAN:  Thank

     17 you.

     18           CHAIR DAVIDSON:  Mr. Wilkey, I

     19 forgot, on the last panel, I had it

     20 written down also.  Do you have any

     21 questions for Brian?

     22           MR. WILKEY:  You just didn't
                                                116



      1 want me to grill my former colleague.

      2           Just a comment and fast

      3 question.  The comment being that I have

      4 always spoken highly about the quality of

      5 individuals working at EAC, and you see a

      6 primary example of that seated before us

      7 today.  He's taken on an enormous

      8 responsibility for a program that is going

      9 to continue to grow, and has met every

     10 single one of his obligations well.  And I

     11 am very proud of him and his work, as well

     12 as everyone that works with him.

     13           I am wondering and I would have

     14 asked this of Chris and Peggy, but I think

     15 since they were both at the meeting,

     16 again, I have had a number of comments

     17 about the quality of that meeting and how

     18 very vital and important it was, but I'm

     19 wondering if there was any discussion

     20 about -- we heard in their testimony that

     21 they want a strong federal program.

     22           Now, when we adopted the 2005
                                                117



      1 guidelines we gave, for a number of

      2 reasons, one of them being we wanted state

      3 legislatures to have the opportunities to

      4 get the language right and the statues to

      5 allow for the adoption of this program.  I

      6 don't think to date we've seen much

      7 progress in that area.

      8           And so in talking about having a

      9 strong federal program, was there any

     10 discussion about how we move about getting

     11 by in to this?  I know from past

     12 experience it took a long time to get them

     13 to buy into the previous program.  But was

     14 there any discussion about how we move

     15 forward, and that level of cooperation of

     16 getting that buy-in, and also getting more

     17 of the state -- this has always been an

     18 issue, getting more of the state

     19 requirements into those federal

     20 requirements so they don't have to do it.

     21           MR. HANCOCK:  There was not a

     22 discussion about this, but it came up on
                                                118



      1 the periphery of a number of discussions.

      2 I think one of the big issues with the

      3 climate right now is the need for

      4 increased security and increased testing.

      5 A lot of the states have decided on their

      6 own volition to do more testing over the

      7 past three to five years.  And certainly

      8 that along with the increased standards

      9 have increased their cost.

     10           Issues that may not have been

     11 present a few years ago now are starting

     12 to be present.  I think one of the things

     13 that was and always has been present is

     14 the lack of funding at the local level, as

     15 I said, for good acceptance testing.  Some

     16 of the states, California, and others,

     17 have also had reasonable budgets to do

     18 testing.

     19           MR. WILKEY:  Its always

     20 intrigued me, because if we really scratch

     21 the surface and make an assessment of the

     22 problems that came out of, for example,
                                                119



      1 the last election, an enormous amount of

      2 those problems would have been obfuscated

      3 had they done good, quality acceptance

      4 testing pre election.

      5           Thank you.

      6           CHAIR DAVIDSON:  I think the

      7 time factor of the delivery of the

      8 equipment close to election and acceptance

      9 testing wasn't done to the level that it

     10 needed to be in a lot of states.  So,

     11 obviously, we hope that is being done now,

     12 that they start meeting those goals for

     13 the next elections, which we know is right

     14 around the corner.

     15           I don't have any other

     16 questions.  Does anybody on the Commission

     17 have any questions?

     18           Thank you, Brian.  We appreciate

     19 your testimony and your comments.

     20           In wrapping up, I do want to

     21 thank everybody for the presentations

     22 today.  I appreciate it, and I think that
                                                120



      1 the information will help us as well as

      2 everybody else.

      3           I just want to announce that our

      4 next putting meeting is currently

      5 scheduled for June 14th, and it will be

      6 here at the EAC.  We'll have it out on the

      7 our website, "www.eac.gov."  I don't have

      8 a time that it will start, but it will

      9 probably be about the same time.  We will

     10 get that all decided.

     11           Is there a motion to adjourn the

     12 meeting?

     13           COMMISSIONER HILLMAN:  I'm

     14 sorry.  Don't move out on me too quick.

     15 Earlier when I talked about the virtual

     16 meeting room, I did neglect to thank all

     17 the staff who have worked with me over the

     18 past several months to make the virtual

     19 meeting room a reality, and that included

     20 the staff in our communications

     21 department, Sheila Banks, my special

     22 assistant, and Lydia, who is now the
                                                121



      1 administrator for the site, as well as our

      2 consultants.  It took a lot of work.  It

      3 was a lot of human hours to go into it.

      4 And so I am very pleased with the end

      5 result, but wanted to make sure I

      6 acknowledged and thanked them for that.

      7           VICE-CHAIR RODRIGUEZ:  Madam

      8 Chair, I just wanted to mark the

      9 anniversary of my first two-and-a-half

     10 months as a member of the Election

     11 Assistance Commission.  And I readily

     12 admit that a learning curve was certainly

     13 the first thing that I had to overcome,

     14 but I cannot think of myself as new any

     15 more.

     16           So any crutch that I use would

     17 have passed, is not mine to claim.  I want

     18 to acknowledge in a public way that I am

     19 accountable for the actions of the agency

     20 as we move forward.  I believe, as

     21 evidenced today, there are lots of good

     22 things going on at the EAC, but as with
                                                122



      1 any agency, agencies can be strengthened,

      2 and I hope to be a part of the

      3 strengthening of the agency.

      4      And I want to say that I have made

      5 two requests of the agency in the past

      6 four weeks.  One was that any

      7 correspondence from Congress be shared

      8 with all Commissioners, and that we have

      9 input into the response.  And my second

     10 request is that all future budget

     11 documents be discussed and adopted in

     12 public.  Budgets are planning tools, and I

     13 think the public has a right to see what

     14 we have planned.

     15           And two weeks ago, I received a

     16 correspondence from Brad Friedman, who

     17 asked me to move the EAC post notices

     18 regarding a certain voting system.

     19 I don't know how to respond to that, but

     20 it is important for me to acknowledge his

     21 request.

     22           And with this statement, I am
                                                123



      1 going asking the director to provide

      2 Mr. Friedman with a response, and I will

      3 give you his initial inquiry to me.

      4           I thank you for the time, Madam

      5 Chair.

      6           CHAIR DAVIDSON:  All right.

      7           Now, I will look for a motion to

      8 adjourn.

      9           COMMISSIONER HILLMAN:  So moved.

     10           COMMISSIONER HUNTER:  Second.

     11           CHAIR DAVIDSON:  The meeting is

     12 now adjourned.

     13           (Whereupon, at approximately 12:30

     14           o'clock, p.m., the above meeting was 

     15           adjourned.)
