    <p><font size="3">FORCE IN READINESS<br>
    <br>
    These past few years I've seen some of the best gear coming to the individual Marine.
    We've been getting the new gortex, boots, and equipment to take care of our Marines. The
    advances in weaponry we are being equipped with is better than most countries we face
    today. The planes have become more advanced in weaponry and precision gunnery, the ships
    are adapted to carry more gear and to support you longer, and the tanks are better
    equipped to handle the world's armor threats. It is imperative that we continue in this
    direction taking care of the men who take care of us from those who would think otherwise
    of peace and freedom.<br>
    <br>
    However with all of our modernization and advances in technology it comes back to one
    point. It takes that individual Marine to secure that ground. As all this gear and
    weaponry has emerged, the number of Marines necessary to carry out the missions has
    declined, not because it takes any less Marines, but because we have been forced to reduce
    without thought for who might have to suffer to save a little money. It's the combat
    Marine who suffers.<br>
    <br>
    We have been forced to reduce the number of troops in the Marine Corps and still maintain
    the combat effectiveness. To do this they have had to cut forces, jobs, and supporting
    agencies in other areas of the Marine Corps and still try to maintain the unit integrity
    of the combat unit. This however has not been able to happen. The personnel to man these
    jobs have been cut but, the jobs are still having to be manned.<br>
    <br>
    When you look at our strengths you see that we are manned at 90% or better because it says
    so on paper. What you don't see is the number of Fleet Assistance Program (FAP) and Camp
    Assistance Program(CAP) Marines we have to give up to outside agencies. To help fill the
    voids the Marine Corps is slowly amassing we have to pull bodies from the combat units to
    fill a FAP or CAP requirement. These bodies can be doing anything from Environmental
    Supervisor to Military Police to a Gym attendant. At anytime I will give up a minimum of
    five Marines to do this for a year. That is five Marines that now cannot train with their
    troops or maintain their proficiency at their profession. This is not only low ranking
    troops it is also our leadership Marines. My Battalion alone has given up 59 Marines to
    work for outside agencies to help fill in these gaps (Attachment 1). Our Regiment has
    given up 131, that is almost equivalent to an entire rifle company. On top of this we can
    also plan on giving up two to four more Marines per platoon to work in one of the internal
    agencies that are required to make a Battalion run smoothly.<br>
    <br>
    We lose these Marines almost the entire training time we are back in the states, getting
    them back only right before we deploy. Now we are taking these Marines right into a
    deployment after being out of their specific training field. <br>
    <br>
    My last deployment in Okinawa was with a Marine Expeditionary Unit more than capable of
    carrying out any mission asked to do. But at what cost. As soon as I landed we had to give
    up our Marines again to help run the base. I didn't see them again until right before we
    returned 6 months later. As soon as we went to sea we had to give up Marines to work for
    the ship because they couldn't man all their jobs.<br>
    <br>
    My lack of adequate numbers of Marines caused me to have to work my Marines above and
    beyond the regular number of hours any man should be working. We have to maintain not only
    our gear, but also all of the gear that we can't man to keep it at a constant state of
    readiness. Our gear goes where we go, and we cannot tolerate for one piece not to be ready
    when the fight begins. <br>
    <br>
    As Marines go out to train we must still carry out the same mission that they require of
    us, we have to just do it with less bodies and still strive to do it better. Having to
    short gun crews to get more guns up weakens us but we cover those sectors. We over task
    our Marines to cover all the contingencies and they do it without hesitation. But as a
    leader I also hope they don't take any more Marines and demand that we to still perform at
    the same levels. <br>
    <br>
    We man our weapons and equipment now but with probably two thirds the men we need and
    still we don't hesitate when given a mission. Unfortunately, we cannot continue to do this
    great job with so little if you take any more Marines away from us. We must continue with
    our current manning levels at a minimum, if not raise them, so that we can continue to
    maintain our current level of readiness. The current demand for our Marines is at an all
    time high not only by the Marine Corps but by the nation. If we continue to think we can
    just cut those Marines from our forces and all will be well, one day we will sadly be
    mistaken. As the nation pulls out those Marines with its cuts the rest of us have to
    continue holding the peace with not only the demands of our nation but of the world.<br>
    <br>
    WELFARE OF OUR MARINES AND THEIR FAMILIES <br>
    <br>
    The young Marines coming in today are no doubt of the finest quality. The levels of
    education and other requirements that are required to enter the Marine Corps today ensure
    this. I interact daily with these Marines as I am at the level, being a platoon sergeant,
    that has to daily counsel these Marines about their future. Some of the main issues facing
    these Marines as they talk to me is our the quality of life issues. Many strides have been
    in made bettering the quality of life today, but we have to continue. With Marines
    deploying more often today they are concerned with well being of their families. The
    following were some of the Major topics my Marines come to me about.<br>
    <br>
    1. Adequate day care facilities for their children. When a Marine deploys he leaves his
    wife home alone with the children. A Marine loses money every time he is deployed when in
    actuality he may incur more living cost by having to maintain two separate living
    quarters. Sometimes a wife will have to work to help supplement the loss of income the
    Marine has incurred for deploying. This causes a wife to have to place any children in a
    day care facility which is hopefully near by and safe. And in turn, this gives the family
    another bill to contend with. <br>
    <br>
    We need to continue to build and improve facilities to support the children of our
    Marines.<br>
    <br>
    2. With the way the Marines are moving and deploying so often, they need more facilities
    that help them with relocation assistance and community support centers. They need help
    not only to help when a new family comes in, but to also support the family member when
    one parent is deployed. One of the key players in helping the Marine and his family is the
    Family Service Center. The Family Service Center is a step in the right direction but even
    it is having problems keeping up with the demands of the Marines. My Marines, due to the
    hectic schedule, cannot always get there during the normal working hours of most
    businesses, which results in the centers being closed when they get there. Also the
    Marines have to drive to offices that may be pretty far away. When the Marine is deployed
    and the wife has a problem, they don't know how to utilize these facilities or they are
    not accessible to them. When discussing this with the family service representative to try
    to help my Marines I discovered that they want to stay open longer hours for the Marines
    and their families, but that they don't have the money to acquire more staff. They have a
    shortage of material to get out to the families and a shortage of offices for the Marines
    families to utilize. The funding to open more offices to Marines and material to support
    them with is not there. The Navy Relief Society works strictly on donations to help our
    Marines and a staff of mostly volunteers to help our Marines. Last year Navy Relief gave
    $2 million in grants and loans in helping troubled families. The funding we don't give to
    these organizations doesn't hurt the organization that is trying to do the job as much as
    the Marines and families who need the services. We need to seriously look at supplementing
    monies to these types of organizations that work strictly on volunteers and donations and
    funding the other ones adequately enough to continue to provide vital help to our Marines
    and family's.<br>
    <br>
    WEAPONS REPLACEMENT<br>
    <br>
    The Marine Corps funding for the replacement and modernization of weapons is inadequate
    for the amount of weapons that need to be replaced and updated. The Marine Corps already
    spreads the thin budget into the priorities it deems are the most urgent which means there
    just is not enough money to go around fast enough to replace all the weapons that need to
    be replaced. Some of my .50 caliber machine-guns were made in the 1940's. As they finally
    wear out and because they have just worn down too much we turn them in. If they decide we
    can no longer repair it they say it has to be completely replaced. We now have to face the
    fact that we will not get a replacement weapon for a year to a year and a half. This is
    entirely too long to have to wait to replace a weapon vital to an infantry battalion or to
    expect a gun crew to be without a weapon. <br>
    <br>
    CONCLUSION<br>
    <br>
    In closing, we will continue to excel as Marines in every mission we are tasked with, for
    we are the Marine Corps. We will do more with less as demanded to by the American people
    because that is our nature. But the demands you ask of us do not go without repercussion
    from the Marines who are committed to succeed. We need to continue to improve taking care
    of our Marines and families by adding more adequate medical care, child care, housing and
    providing adequate services and facilities to help in their time of need. A Marine who
    knows his family is being taken care of will sacrifice more of himself to do what has to
    be done. And we must ensure that a Marine has the tools with which to carry out his job by
    continuing to provide him with the best of personal gear, the modernization of supporting
    equipment (tanks, aircraft, engineering equipment,etc), and providing enough funding to
    replace more older weapons at a faster rate.<br>
