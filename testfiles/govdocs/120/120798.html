           OVERWHELMING OPPOSITION SUSTAINED AND ENHANCED THE FININGEST
           TRADITIONS OF THE U.S. NAVAL SERVICE. THAT LEADERSHIP AND SENSE
           OF DUTY CONTINUES TO MOTIVATE HIS PUBLIC SERVICE TODAY. BOB'S
           CONTRIBUTION TO AMERICA'S GOVERNANCE MAY GROW. ALTHOUGH HE WILL
           SIT OUT NEXT YEAR'S PRESIDENTIAL RACE, HE MAY BE A CONTENDER IN
