&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Marine Corps regularly offers enlistments of four, five and six
years. Applicants must be 17 to 28 years old. Qualified applicants may be guaranteed
training under a wide variety of options. The Marine Corps also offers enlistment bonuses
up to $5,000. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to specific occupational field training, the Marine Corps
College Enlistment Program (CEP) offers progressive,&nbsp; accelerated promotion to the
rank of lance corporal (E-3) in high-tech fields. An applicant must possess an associate
degree or a post secondary education equal to an associate degree (minimum of 60 semester
hours or 90 quarter hours) from an accredited school to be eligible.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Marine Corps Quality Enlistment Program (QEP) offers similar
incentives to qualified high school graduates. Applicants may choose their military
occupational field and geographic area of assignment.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Marine Corps Enlistment Options Program (EOP) offers training and
assignments in a job skill to qualified applicants who demonstrate interest and aptitude.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Marine Corps Musician Enlistment Option Program (MEOP) offers
qualified instrumentalists training and assignment in one of the Marine Corps standard
bands. Exceptional musicians are eligible for accelerated promotion and guaranteed
duty-station assignment. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All Marine Corps applicants have several alternatives in which they can
begin active duty at a higher rank. Each applicant is also eligible for the Buddy Program,
which guarantees assignment to the same recruit unit with friends who may have enlisted.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More information on enlistment programs can be obtained from the
nearest Marine Corps recruiter or by calling toll free 1-800-MARINES.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A recruit's Marine Corps career begins with 13 weeks of recruit
training at either Parris Island, S.C., or San Diego, Calif. The training is an extensive
indoctrination into Marine Corps ways, consisting of physical fitness; weapons
handling/firing and marksmanship; field skills; close order drill; Marine Corps history,
customs and courtesies; and related subjects, culminating with The Crucible.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After completing recruit training, male and female Marines attend four
weeks of combat training, which is follow-up instruction in advanced field and combat
skills. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This training is conducted at the School of Infantry at either Marine
Corps Base (MCB) Camp Lejeune, N.C., or MCB Camp Pendleton, Calif.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Women receive their recruit training at Parris Island in a separate
battalion, with a curriculum identical to that of males.<br>
Upon completing recruit and Marine combat training, the new Marine is qualified to enter a
tailored job skill training program based on the individual's capabilities and desires and
the needs of the Marine Corps. This program consists of formal schooling at Marine Corps
or other service schools and on-the-job training. Training and schooling may last anywhere
from four weeks to more than a year. More than 95 percent of new Marines attend a formal
school after recruit training.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the officer candidate programs, male and female graduates of an
accredited four-year college or university, and graduates of accredited law schools
licensed to practice in a state or federal court are eligible for a reserve commission.<br>
Upon successful completion of a 10-week screening and evaluation program, candidates are
commissioned as second lieutenants in the Marine Corps Reserve. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon completion of this program and commissioning, second lieutenants

Corps ROTC</big></strong></em></font><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Navy/Marine Corps ROTC programs at more than 65 colleges and
universities across the country offer Marine Corps commissions to college students who
complete four years of naval science study on campus. The two types of programs are the
College Program and the Scholarship Program. In addition to students already enrolled in
college programs, or planning to attend college, some enlisted personnel are eligible to
apply for the Navy/Marine Corps ROTC Scholarship.<br>
Four-year scholarship programs: Students are selected from national competition and are
appointed midshipmen, U.S. Naval Reserve, and identified as Marine Corps options. They may
be granted the compensation and benefits authorized by law during the basic course for a
total period of not more than four years. During this period of college, the Department of
the Navy pays for tuition, fees and textbooks, and provides uniforms and a subsistence
allowance of $150 per month.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon completion of naval science requirements and graduation, students
receive reserve commissions as second lieutenants with a four-year active duty obligation.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Four-year college program:</strong> Students are selected from
among those applying for enrollment at each Navy/Marine Corps ROTC unit.&nbsp; During the
first two years in the Basic Course, students have the status of civilians who have
entered into a contract with the Navy. &nbsp; Upon completion of one term of the Basic
Course, students may apply for a change to a Marine Corps option. Upon enrollment in the
Advanced Course, College Program students enlist in the Marine Corps Reserve. Upon
graduation and completion of naval science requirements, students are commissioned as
second lieutenants in the Marine Corps Reserve with a 3.5 year active duty obligation. The
Navy provides uniforms, naval science textbooks and a $150 a month subsistence allowance
for a maximum of 20 months during the Advanced Course.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three-, two- and one-year scholarships are available to College Program
students nominated by their NROTC unit commanding officers. Selections are made by the
Commandant of the Marine Corps.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Two-year scholarship and college programs:</strong> Students selected
are those with advanced college standing who qualify for enrollment in the Advanced
Course. They must first successfully complete the six-week course at the Naval Science
Institute. Those enrolled in the Two-Year Scholarship and College Programs have the same
privileges and obligations as those in the respective Four-Year Programs.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information about the College Program is available from Navy/Marine
ROTC units. &nbsp; Students desiring information about the Scholarship Program should
contact the nearest Marine Corps recruiting station, or write to the Commanding General,
Marine Corps Recruiting Command (ON), 2 Navy Annex, Washington, DC&nbsp; 20380.<br>

<p><font face="Arial"><big><em><strong>Broadened Opportunity for <br>
Officer Selection and Training</strong></em></big></font><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BOOST offers active duty enlisted men and women between the ages of 18
and 24 the opportunity to receive up to 12 months of extensive academic preparation in
order to become more competitive for selection to the Naval Academy, Marine Corps Enlisted
Commissioning Education Program (MECEP) and Navy/Marine Corps ROTC scholarship programs.
BOOST participants attend school at the Naval Education Training Center in Newport, R.I.
If not selected for either a Navy/Marine Corps ROTC scholarship, MECEP or appointment to
the Naval Academy, BOOST students fulfill their service obligation to the Marine Corps in
the enlisted ranks.</p>

<font face="Arial"><big><em><strong>The Enlisted Commissioning Program</strong></em></big></font><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ECP provides enlisted Marines with a four-year degree from an
accredited school the opportunity to become commissioned officers. ECP is open to Marines
with a minimum of one year active duty experience and at least 12 months remaining on
their current enlistment contract.&nbsp; </p>

<p><br>
<font face="Arial"><big><em><strong>The Meritorious Commissioning Program</strong></em></big></font><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MCP provides a commissioning opportunity for enlisted Marines with
two-year degrees, 60 semester hours or more of college work, who have demonstrated rare
leadership qualities, and would ultimately better serve the Marine Corps as an&nbsp;
officer. Unlike other commissioning programs where the application process is initiated by
the applicant, the MCP requires that applicants be nominated by their commanding officers.
Marines are given a Marine Corps Reserve commission and serve on active duty. Marines must
have the same qualifications for MCP as ECP.&nbsp; For more information about these
programs, contact the unit education officer or career planner.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Qualified Marine Corps commissioned officers below the age of 29 and
with less than four years of commissioned service are eligible to apply for student naval
aviation or student naval officer training. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pilot training begins with 18 to 24 months at the Naval Air Training
Command, followed by an assignment to one of the many Marine Corps or joint Navy/Marine
Corps tactical aircraft squadrons. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assignment to training as a student naval aviator or naval flight
officer requires either a six- or eight-year commitment after designation, depending on
the type of training received.</p>

<p><br>
<a name="Education"><font face="Arial"><strong><big><big>Education</big></big></strong></font></a><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Individuals who possess a higher education improve their career
opportunities. The Marine Corps benefits too, in terms of greater efficiency and improved
readiness.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marines, regardless of rank or duty station, are encouraged to further
their education. The Marine Corps supports the educational goal of every enlisted Marine
having at least a high school education and every officer a college degree.<br>
Thus, the Marine Corps offers off-duty education programs as basic as completing a high
school education or as complex as earning a doctorate degree.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To help defray the cost of advanced education, the Marine Corps will
pay up to 75 percent of tuition costs. Tuition assistance may be used for courses leading
toward a baccalaureate or higher degree or a vocational/technical certificate taken at any
accredited institution. In addition, the Marine Corps funds 100 percent of high school
completion programs. To assist Marines in realizing their educational goals, each major
command has an education officer trained to help Marines enroll in education programs and
apply for tuition assistance.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Defense Activity for Non-Traditional Education Support (DANTES): DANTES
is an educational support service for the voluntary education programs of the military
services. They provide College Level Examination Program (CLEP) and DANTES Subject
Standardized Tests (DSST), which enable Marines to get college credit without attending
classes. DANTES also provides high school equivalency diploma testing for military members
stationed overseas. Domestic high school equivalency diploma testing is available through
the civilian high school equivalency diploma testing programs within the 50 states.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Marine Corps College Fund (MCCF) works in conjunction with the
Montgomery GI Bill to provide up to $30,000 in educational benefits to enlistees. To be
eligible for the MCCF, an applicant must be a high school graduate, score a minimum AFQT
score of 50 and GT score of 100, be a U.S. citizen, have vision correctable to 20/20,
enlist for four or five years, participate in the Montgomery GI Bill, receive an
honorable, discharge at the end of obligated service.</p>

<p><br>
<em><font face="Arial"><strong><big>Enlisted Degree Programs</big></strong></font></em><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two Marine Corps programs allow active duty enlisted members the
opportunity to earn a bachelor's degree while attending school full-time. While attending
college, they receive full pay and allowances. However, it is up to the individual to
finance his or her education. Accepting either of the two programs requires an additional
active duty obligation.<br>
<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marine Corps Enlisted Commissioning Education Program (MECEP):</strong>
This program provides selected enlisted Marines, ages 20 to 26, with an opportunity to
earn a baccalaureate degree by attending a college or university full-time. After
obtaining a degree and completing officer candidate school, MECEP graduates are
commissioned reserve second lieutenants, provided they are no older than 29.<br>
<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Degree Completion Program for Staff Noncommissioned Officers:</strong>
This program provides selected staff noncommissioned officers with the opportunity to
obtain a baccalaureate degree while attending a college or university full time.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eligibility is limited to Marines in the grades of staff sergeant
through first sergeant/master sergeant. Each must have sufficient college credits to
permit them to obtain a degree within an 18-month period.&nbsp; Each attendee is selected
by competetive board.</p>

<p><br>
<font face="Arial"><em><strong><big>Officer Degree Programs</big></strong></em></font><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Marine Corps offers eligible officers five programs through which to
receive degrees while attending full time college. Depending upon the program, selected
officers can receive either an undergraduate or a graduate degree. Funding for the various
programs ranges from fully funded to non-funded. Accepting any of the programs requires an
additional active duty obligation of service.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; College Degree Program: Participation in this program is limited to officers
in the grade of warrant officer through lieutenant colonel who have sufficient credits to
permit them to obtain a baccalaureate degree within an 18-month period. While
participating in this program, officers receive normal pay and allowances. Tuition must be
paid by the officer. Additional active duty obligation is three to four years.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Funded Legal Education Program: Participation in this program is available to
active duty officers with a college degree in the grade of second lieutenant through
captain who have between two and six years of active service. This program provides
selected officers with the opportunity to earn the degree of Juris Doctor. While
participating in this program, officers receive normal pay and allowances plus tuition.
Maximum course length is 36 months. Additional active duty obligation is six years.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Excess Leave Program: </strong>Participation in this program is
limited to commissioned officers with a college degree and who have two to eight years
commissioned service as of June 30 of the fiscal year in which the application is made.
This program also provides the opportunity to earn the Juris Doctor degree. While
participating in the program, officers receive up to three years leave of absence from the
Marine Corps. Officers receive no pay or allowances while in this program and must pay
their tuition. Active duty obligation is one to three years.<br>
<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Special Education Program:</strong> This program is limited to
commissioned officers with an undergraduate degree who are in the grade of first
lieutenant through lieutenant colonel. It provides officers an opportunity to earn a
postgraduate degree in a specified discipline. Participants receive normal pay and
allowances and tuition. Maximum course length is 24 months. Active duty obligation is four
years.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Advanced Degree Program:</strong> Participation in this program
is limited to commissioned officers who possess a college degree and are in the grade of
first lieutenant through lieutenant colonel. The program provides selected officers the
opportunity to receive a postgraduate degree in a specified discipline. Participants

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Qualified men and women 17 to 28 years of age may enlist in the Marine
Corps Reserve. Reserve enlistees attend the same boot camp, combat training and skill
training as Marines in the regular component. The length of active duty training varies
depending on the particular job skill selected. To qualify for a special assignment or
skill qualification, additional active duty for training is available.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before attending recruit training, a limited number of high school
seniors, who will graduate within six months, may attend weekend drills for full pay.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First time enlistment in certain occupational fields or selected units
entitles qualified Marine Corps reservists to enlistment bonuses of up to $2,000. Those
enlisting for six years in the Selected Marine Corps Reserve will receive educational
assistance under the provisions of the Montgomery GI Bill.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Depending upon the training program selected by the reservist, Initial
Active Duty for Training (IADT), including boot camp, will last from four to 12 months.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Incremental IADT, especially tailored for the reservist going to
college or vocational school, is also available. Under this program, recruit training,
occupational specialty training and combat training is taken during three successive
summer periods.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ultimately, Marine reservists will serve as members of hometown units.
Reservists participate in drills one weekend a month and attend two weeks of active duty
training annually, usually in the summer, at a major Marine Corps base, other service
installation, or as part of joint exercises on foreign soil.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reenlistment and affiliation bonuses are offered to prior service
members with less than 10 years total military&nbsp; <a name="service.">service. </a></p>
