<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font face="Courier New">DECISION AND ORDER</font></p>
</u></b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Courier New">&nbsp;&nbsp; Local 738, American
Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO (Union) and the Department of the
Army, Combined Arms Center &amp; Fort Leavenworth, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas
(Employer) filed a joint request for assistance with the Federal Service
Impasses Panel (Panel) to consider a negotiation impasse under the Federal
Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (Statute), 5 U.S.C. § 7119.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Courier New">&nbsp;&nbsp; Following investigation
of the request for assistance, which arose from negotiations over a proposed
reduction in force(RIF)/business based action (BBA) in the Fort Leavenworth
Lodging Non-Appropriated Fund Instrumentality,<A HREF="#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A> the Panel determined that the
dispute should be resolved through single written submissions from the parties.
The parties were informed that after receiving their submissions, the Panel
would take whatever action it deemed appropriate to resolve the impasse, which
could include the issuance of a <u>Decision and Order</u>. Written submissions
were made pursuant to this procedure, and the Panel has now considered the
entire record.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="center"><b><u><font face="Courier New">BACKGROUND</font></u></b></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Courier New">&nbsp;&nbsp; </font> <font face="Courier New">The
mission of the Combined Arms Center is to educate officers in the art of command
and staff functions of the combined arms at the tactical level, and to educate
officers in the operational art of war. The Union represents approximately
300-350 non-appropriated fund employees who work in various food service,
recreation, and housing facilities. About 138 unit employees work in the Fort
Leavenworth Lodging Non-Appropriated Fund Instrumentality. The parties are
abiding by the terms and conditions of a collective bargaining agreement last
negotiated in 1980, but which has been renewed for 2-year periods since that
time. The parties’ latest 2-year renewal period was to have expired in June
2003.</font></p>
<b><u>
<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font face="Courier New">ISSUE AT IMPASSE</font></p>
</u></b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Courier New">&nbsp;&nbsp; </font> <font face="Courier New">In
essence, the parties disagree over whether the Employer should be permitted to
conduct its proposed BBA in accordance with its last best offer, or should be
required to negotiate over revised Department of the Army Regulation (AR) 215-3,
dated August 26, 2002, before the BBA is implemented.</font></p>
<u>
<p align="center"><b><font face="Courier New">POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES</font></p>
</b></u>
<p><font face="Courier New">1. </font><u><font face="Courier New">The Employer’s
Position</font></p>
</u>
<p align="justify"><font face="Courier New">&nbsp;&nbsp; The Employer’s final offer, among
other things, would provide: (1) 32-hour workweeks for the 14 employees whose
employment status would change from regular full-time to regular part-time; (2)
information to the Union on all lodging positions and the records and documents
used to decide the positions/employees to be affected by the action; (3)
severance pay to separated employees in accordance with AR 215-3, dated August
26, 2002; (4) written notice to each affected employee stating the reason for
the action; and (5) various other rights to which affected employees are
entitled.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Courier New">&nbsp;&nbsp; Management is guaranteed the right to
layoff employees under section 7106(a) of the Statute, and on November 5, 1993,
the parties agreed to implementation of a business based system which
&quot;provides a sound basis&quot; for reducing the members of the Fort
Leavenworth non-appropriated fund workforce. The Employer is &quot;in no way
barred&quot; from exercising its authority to conduct the BBA, which it
initially intended to implement on October 1, 2002, in accordance with the
previously negotiated policy. Moreover, nothing prevented the Union from
proposing the use of any provision contained in the revised regulation and, in
fact, it &quot;made such proposals on the first day of mediation&quot; (October
21, 2002). The Employer’s final offer &quot;essentially matches the proposals
submitted by the Union to the Employer&quot; on that date. It should be adopted
by the Panel in its entirety to resolve the dispute &quot;since it responsibly
and meritoriously responds to all proposals advanced by the Union&quot; directly
pertaining to the impact and implementation of the BBA.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Courier New">&nbsp;&nbsp; The Union’s proposal, on the other
hand, &quot;has no merit.&quot; It is basically the same one the Union submitted
during the second day of mediation (October 22, 2002), after it discovered the
existence of the revised regulation. Rather than agreeing to bargain over the
revised regulation as a separate matter, as the Employer proposed on November
15, 2002, it is insisting on a process that would further delay the BBA, which
has already cost management &quot;$108,070 more than would have otherwise been
expended had the reduction been effected as planned.&quot; Additional support
for its position that the Union’s proposal should be rejected comes from the
fact that the Union filed &quot;an unfounded&quot; unfair labor practice charge
with the Federal Labor Relations Authority on April 9, 2003, alleging unlawful
implementation of the revised regulation, that it subsequently unilaterally
withdrew.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Courier New">2. </font><u><font face="Courier New">The Union’s
Position</font></p>
</u>
<p align="justify"><font face="Courier New">&nbsp;&nbsp; The Union basically proposes that the
parties be ordered to negotiate over the changes in AR 215-3, dated August 26,
2002, as a prerequisite to implementing the proposed BBA. The &quot;existing
regulation&quot; then would &quot;be the guidance&quot; that management uses
&quot;to conduct the reduction in force action.&quot; The Employer was obligated
to notify the Union about the revised regulation, which outlines procedures for
conducting a RIF, but it only did so during the second day of mediation. As a
result of the Employer’s neglect, &quot;the Union was not afforded the
opportunity&quot; to negotiate the impact and implementation of the changes
&quot;that may have a negative effect on the bargaining unit employees.&quot;
While &quot;not attempting to prevent management from exercising its
rights,&quot; it is the Union’s position that returning to the table to
bargain the revised AR 215-3 would afford the affected employees &quot;their due
process.&quot;</font></p>
<b><u>
<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font face="Courier New">CONCLUSION</font></p>
</u></b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Courier New">&nbsp;&nbsp; Having carefully considered the
evidence and arguments presented by the parties’ in support of their
positions, we conclude that the impasse should be resolved on the basis of the
Employer’s final offer. The record demonstrates that the parties have had
ample opportunity to negotiate over both the proposed BBA and the revised
regulation, and that the Employer has been prevented from implementing its
decision even though it’s proposal essentially meets the interests expressed
by the Union during the first day of mediation. In our view, the Union has
failed to show that any additional delay is warranted.</font></p>
<p align="center"><b><u><font face="Courier New">ORDER</font></p>
</u></b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Courier New">&nbsp;&nbsp; Pursuant to the authority vested in it
by the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute, 5 U.S.C. § 7119, and
because of the failure of the parties to resolve their dispute during the course
of the proceedings instituted under the Panel’s regulations 5 C.F.R. §
2471.6(a)(2), the Federal Service Impasses Panel under 5 C.F.R. § 2471.11(a) of
its regulations hereby orders the following:</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Courier New">The parties shall adopt the Employer’s final
offer.</font></p>

<P align="justify"><font face="courier new"><A NAME="N_1_">1.</A>
The BBA would affect 16 full-time employees, mainly by reducing the number of work hours for most 
of them, with the prospect that up to three employees may be separated.
