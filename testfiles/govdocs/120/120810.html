<P>PROCESS TO COORDINATE TECHNOLOGY NEEDS OF U.S. AGRICULTURE AND PARTNERED
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT </P>
<P></P>
<P>BACKGROUND:</P>
<P>NRCS and ARS have individual missions that come to a common focus in certain
areas of endeavor.  Where they most strongly interface is in forming
science-based technological approaches to the solution of real-world problems or
needs related to the sustainable practice of agriculture in the context of
natural resources, the natural environment, and society's expectations regarding
food and fiber, economics, environment, and quality of life.</P>
<P>The formation of science-based technological approaches and products
involves research and development (R&amp;D) and constitutes a critical endeavor
that often is very costly and has potential to economically impact society one
way or the other depending on how well it is done and how timely it is.</P>
<P>The term &quot;research and development&quot; covers a wide array of
activities and approaches of greatly differing scope and resource and time
requirements.  The sources of agricultural R&amp;D include universities, state
experiment stations, and other entities as well as ARS.  ARS has funding and a
mandate to serve the research needs of NRCS.  Certain problems may require
expertise not available in ARS, or, at a given time, all of ARS's resources may
be fully assigned to high priority R&amp;D when a new project must be
commissioned.  Under these circumstances, seeking R&amp;D services outside ARS
is fully justified.</P>
<P>A primary reason for the formation of the PMT was recognition that the NRCS
has a justifiable critical interest in the research of ARS, particularly that
encompassed by the Natural Resources and Systems research components.  Likewise,
ARS has an interest in and a responsibility to understand NRCS and the technical
and social issues with which it deals.  The fundmental principle upon which the
PMT is founded is that within a true partnership, each Agency should be aware of
and have an appropriate degree of influence on the policy and work of the other,
without controlling the other.</P>
<P>The overriding &quot;raison d'etre&quot; for the PMT is prioritized pursuit
and delivery of specific technological knowledge and products needed by the NRCS
in the course of serving the natural resource conservation needs of the Nation. 
The benefit to ARS will be assurance that its research is demonstrably relevant
and has positive impact.</P>
<P>Note here that natural resource conservation is inextricably bound up with
the practice of agriculture and with any other human use of landscapes, the
focus of which is nearly always on some product or benefit other than resource
conservation per se.  Natural resource conservation measures are generally
applied to offset or retard negative impacts on resources or the environment
which would otherwise be caused by primary measures applied on the land to
produce the desired social or economic benefits.  Natural resource conservation
measures are systems components.  Therefore, while the natural resources
research area of ARS is of most direct interest to NRCS needs, the animal and
plant science components are of only slightly less interest insofar as their
work contributes to farming systems for the production of food and fiber.</P>
<P>The NRCS and the ARS are agencies of nation-wide organization and structure.
 The NRCS has offices in 2500 agricultural areas of the U.S., and ARS has
laboratories in over 100 U.S. locations.  The NRCS field offices deal directly
with agricultural clientele, and it is at this level that problems and needs in
the agricultural sector of the U.S. are encountered and identified.</P>
<P>Some of these problems and needs may be met through the interaction of local
entities, such as NRCS and local problem- solving sources including other
government agencies, universities, consultants, etc.  Some may directly involve
ARS scientists.  It is the policy of the NRCS and the ARS that problems be
solved and needs met at the lowest possible levels of the two organizations and
their local governmental and private sector partners and colleagues.  However,
some problems and needs are appropriately addressed at the national level.</P>
<P>In what follows, the Partnership Management Team recommends interagency
policies and procedures to deal with agricultural resource problems and needs. 
The functions covered by these policies are effectively 1) those of the former
SCS Research Needs Committee and 2) a new ?customer' function of helping ARS to
assess its national programs for relevance.  In the case of the former SCS
Research Needs Committee, a new paradigm is to be implemented in that the new
approach is designed to facilitate designation and initiation of actual working
projects that will yield results and products of specific use to NRCS and its
clientele.  It is expected that in the course of pursuing these projects,
knowledge gaps will be identified that elucidate specific research needs to be
addressed at more fundamental levels and that these specific needs will be
transmitted to the U.S. agricultural research community, including ARS units and
national program managers.  The new ?relevance' function is to be carried out in
the context of assessing whether ARS national programs are appropriately
addressing the knowledge gaps uncovered in the search for new and improved
technology that will contribute toward NRCS meeting its mission goals.</P>
<P>In what follows, the term &quot;need&quot; refers to problems,
opportunities, lack of information, procedures, or tools, and other issues faced
by NRCS for which science-based knowledge or other products will enhance its
ability to satisfy.  &quot;Project&quot; means research and development project
undertaken to address a specific need.  &quot;Products&quot; are the results of
such projects, whether they be tangible or intangible.  </P>
<P>The ultimate beneficiary of the science-enhanced services of NRCS will be
landowners, growers, and the public.  Thus, the public is the direct customer of
NRCS, and an indirect, but ultimate customer of ARS.  The NRCS, although a
partner, is also a customer of ARS, a user of its products, in that any specific
product supplied NRCS by ARS must meet the former's requirements.</P>
<P>Mission of Project Management:</P>
<P>Facilitate planning and conduct of R&amp;D to, in timely manner, yield
needed products for use by NRCS and others.</P>
<UL>
<LI> Projects are addressed in order of importance as commensurate with
well-planned use of resources
</LI>
<LI> Products are relevant to current NRCS problems or needs
</LI>
<LI> Products meet technical operational requirements
</LI>
<LI> Products meet user requirements
</LI>
<LI> Products are developed within specified time frames
</LI></UL>
<P>LOCAL LEVEL:</P>
<P>Projects should be undertaken at the lowest feasible levels of the two
agencies.  Criteria for determining the appropriateness of local level
approaches include consideration of local availability of resources, the
complexity of the project, the uniqueness of the project to the locality, and
access to expertise pertinent to the project.  Expertise may come from any
source.  It will often be most economical to approach ARS expertise, in that ARS
has its own research budget and may be able to address problems and needs
without recourse to searches for outside resources.  At their discretion, NRCS
local offices are encouraged to contact ARS scientists directly regardless of
their location.</P>
<P>The Agencies expect that their personnel will examine potential projects as
to whether they should be considered at national scale.  If not, ARS scientists
and NRCS professionals are encouraged to immediately begin work in partnership
to resolve the issue, within the constraints of the two Agencies' policies
regarding authorized areas of work, e.g., current approved CRIS documentation
must authorize the general area of research required for involved ARS
scientists.  If this is not the case then the scientists need to consult with
the National Program Staff of ARS.  </P>
<P>The Agencies request that local groups consult with the PMT if there is
doubt about the scope of the proposed project.  The Agencies also require that
the PMT be kept informed of local projects and their annual progress.  The PMT
may, if information available to it warrants, request that the parties reexamine
the question of whether the problem is local in scope.</P>
<P>The policies of both Agencies require that local projects initiated to solve
problems or meet needs be subject to the same processing and standards as
national-scale projects discussed below.</P>
<P>PMT MANAGEMENT OF NATIONAL-SCALE RESEARCH</P>
<P>An Executive Secretary reporting to the PMT manages the national- scale
process and the PMT office.  A professional-level assistant will be provided on
a rotating, as needed basis by ARS who will assign scientists to temporary
details for periods of time up to one year in duration.  A full-time program
assistant will also be provided by ARS.  The PMT office provided by NRCS will
house these people and necessary equipment.  Operating funds will be provided on
an equal-shares basis by the two Agencies.</P>
<P>The Executive Secretary will be responsible for carrying out or overseeing
activities that:</P>
<P>- Maintain database of completed and active projects and of needs for which
projects await initiation.  The latter, referred to below as &quot;the list&quot;,
will be kept in two sections, one being the set of 10 highest national
priorities, the other being in dated, numbered order as they are received.  This
list is to be maintained in a form accessible to the public.  Interested persons
may at their own initiative submit project proposals to address needs anywhere
on the list.</P>
<P>Technological needs statements or proposed projects, when submitted, must be
accompanied by an initial study report (ISR), in conformance with good systems
engineering practice.</P>
<P>- Preliminary processing of new needs or proposed projects as they are
submitted and adding them to the dated, numbered list. </P>
<P>Preliminary processing includes such activities as assuring that the ISR is
attached and apparently sufficient; that a proposed project is not redundant to
projects already completed, currently active, or on the list; and conducting or
commissioning searches for existing technology to resolve the issue represented
by a stated need or project proposal.  Communication may take place with the
proposers, and, finally, where appropriate, the statement of need or proposed
project is entered into the list.</P>
<P>- Periodically reprioritizing the list, giving due regard to the current
political and social climate and to needs and proposed projects newly added to
the list since the last prioritization.</P>
<P>The purpose of this activity is to assure that the PMT is ready to respond
with appropriate recommendations when resources become available for undertaking
new projects.  It involves a number of subtasks and activities and is described
in greater detail below.</P>
<UL>
<LI> Identifying sources of R&amp;D services and recommend a) which to engage,
with reasons, or b) a process to select the service to contract for the
research, where contract is used equally to refer to projects in-house or
extramural to ARS.  The goal of this task is to obtain R&amp;D services that are
appropriate to the project issue and that are both meritoriously qualified and
cost-effective.
</LI>
<LI> Tracking and reviewing active projects and projects that have been
completed, but are in the process of implementation.
</LI></UL>
<P>This activity is to assure that the PMT is in readiness to rapidly respond
to Agency management requests and Congressional and other queries.  Technical
and scientific reviews are the general responsibility of the Agencies.  The PMT
review is a management-level review and is partially in the context of providing
early warning should a project appear to be going off track or stalled.  One of
the issues here is accountability on the part of the contractor.  Projects,
including locally managed projects, are required to submit minimal progress
reports at completion of certain milestones or annually as appropriate and are
subject to other review at the discretion of the PMT.  The mechanism set in
place here is specifically to avoid becoming an onerous reporting burden.</P>
<P>- Writing annual reports and briefing papers and reports as required by the
Agencies.</P>
<P>To the extent that the routine parts of the above tasks can be performed in
the Executive Secretary's office, they should be.  However, prioritization of
needs and proposed projects, recommendation of sources of R&amp;D services, and
management reviews require inputs from a cross-section of interests and
expertise.</P>
<P>Among the above tasks, a critical function is prioritization, which is a
word that refers to activities necessary to assuring that appropriate R&amp;D
responses are made to the most important NRCS (and public) needs as balanced
against availability of the expertise and funding resources needed to address
them. Thus, for example, a meritorious project proposal speaking to a stated
need in the list could affect the priority accorded to responding to that need.</P>
<P>The means of accomplishing prioritization is through use of a standing
prioritization committee consisting of a broad cross- section of interests and
backgrounds, e.g., stakeholders from a spectrum covering social to physical
backgrounds, but able to view issues from a high level.  The prioritization
committee is to be composed of Federal agency personnel capable of representing
the range of interests.  The chair and committee members will be rotated on a
staggered three-year basis.</P>
<P>The prioritization committee has two assignments:</P>
<P>1) Based on its broad, cross-sectional background, it gives needs in the
list their priority standing and recommends same to the PMT.</P>
<P>The committee determines its own procedures for assigning priorities, but is
expected to consider such criteria as:</P>
<UL>
<LI> the impacts of the problem or need if unmet
</LI>
<LI> the impacts if met, considering that some might be negative
</LI>
<LI> the costs involved in meeting the problem
</LI>
<LI> the availability of resources (funding, equipment, expertise, project
proposal, etc.) for conducting the project.
</LI>
<LI> level of societal visibility and interest
</LI></UL>
<P>2) It also serves to give priority guidelines through the PMT to ARS
national program management in the development of long and short range project
plans, ranging from the very applied to the very basic.</P>
<P>ARS's new approach to national program management of lines of research has
been implemented specifically to enhance both its relevance and its
productivity.  These priority guidelines will be valuable to ARS program
managers at all levels.</P>
<P>The role of the prioritization committee is shown in the attached figure. 
Note that its role is that of staff to the PMT and that the latter's role is
that of staff to an ARS Associate Deputy Administrator and to a NRCS Deputy
Chief.</P>
<P>The prioritization committee is supplemented by ad hoc technical
subcommittees. One is appointed for each need to be addressed.  Members are
drawn from among scientists and research administrators of the disciplines
needed.  Each technical subcommittee is responsible for technical oversight of
all aspects of the various projects.  The technical remain active for the life
of each project, although membership may change as necessary.</P>
<P>If new projects are to be funded, one or more potential R&amp;D groups
(e.g., ARS, academe, etc.) are asked to develop proposals for projects to meet
the need to be funded.  The first choice for an &quot;R&amp;D group&quot; is ARS
scientists on the basis that they are already funded.</P>
<P>An ad hoc technical subcommittee is comprised of scientists and/or
scientific administrators who are technically qualified in the disciplines
associated with a specific need.  Its lifetime is the same as that of the
project it helps to get implemented to meet its specific need.  Membership may
be constant or may change over the life of the project.</P>
<P>One purpose is to suggest sources of research and to give technical and
merit review to proposals, projects, and plans.  When there is more than one
proposal to review in connection with a need, these subcommittees also express
their sense of the priority of one proposal relative to other proposals. The
issue here is not limited to competition for scientific merit. The issue is
identifying the group most likely to produce a needed product that meets user
requirements as well as providing a science-based solution to a need.</P>
<P>As stated earlier, the principle source of research is ARS, but there may be
a question of which group of scientists to whom to assign a project.  If, for
whatever reason, ARS is not the appropriate research supplier for a specific
need, then the ad hoc subcommittee should recommend one or more alternative
sources.  In either event, project proposals, if not already in hand, are to be
solicited.  A subcommittee then reviews the proposal(s) for merit and relevance,
then recommends an action to the prioritization committee.</P>
<P>After a project is underway, the prioritization committee may call upon the
subcommittee to conduct project reviews for primarily management purposes, as
discussed above.  However, at their own discretion, ARS and NRCS may also wish
to ask the subcommittee to organise and conduct in-depth reviews of projects.</P>
<P>Ad hoc subcommittees, as asked by the PMT or prioritization committees, will
also give technical review to long and short term goals and approaches of ARS
national research programs and give a sense of whether these program groups have
addressed higher priority needs of their involved disciplines.</P>
<P>The results of the ad hoc subcommittees' activities are fed back to the
prioritization committee.  The latter considers the results of the reviews and
makes recommendations to the PMT.  To repeat, these recommendations address five
aspects of R&amp;D:</P>
<UL>
<LI> Recommend the order of priority for allocating resources to unfunded,
unmet needs from the list of needs maintained by the Executive Secretary
</LI>
<LI> Recommend the sources of research, whether ARS units, State experiment
stations, or other.
</LI>
<LI> Recommend acceptability of project proposals for satisfaction of specific
needs.
</LI>
<LI> Make recommendations based on management or other reviews of specific
projects.
</LI>
<LI> Recommend acceptance as is, acceptance with modification, or rejection of
ARS national research program plans and strategy.
</LI></UL>
<P>As shown in the attached figure, three levels of staff constitute the PMT
with regard to prioritization.  Thus, all the output of each level of staff
constitutes recommendations to the next higher level.  It is the policy of the
PMT that each level of staff that disagrees with a recommendation from the next
lower level will inform that level and will justify its judgement.</P>
<P>A comment noted that some of the products to be developed in response to
needs will be software.  It was suggested that the PMT develop and recommend a
software policy to include deciding to develop a model and certain common
requirements or standards to be met by the software.</P>
<P>A comment noted that PMT will need to establish a form or areas that must be
included in the ISR.</P>
<P>A comment requested flow or organizational diagrams for 1)a typical need
submission through the entire process to delivery of a product and 2) the
organization of ARS and NRCS all the way from the deputies to the research bench
or field office levels of the Agencies.</P>
<P>A comment noted that the needs list is likely to have perenially lower
priority needs and there should to be a mechanism to eventually bring deserving
needs to the top.</P>
<P>Dr. James Bonta, of the ARS North Appalachian Experimental Watershed,
Coshocton, has selected as a middle management development project, organization
of the Executive Secretary's Office.  The above requests along with other
implementation details will be addressed by him in consultation with Lee Herndon
and Dick Amerman who have agreed to mentor Dr. Bonta.</P></BODY></HTML>
