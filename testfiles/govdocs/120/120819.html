<p><center><pre>[Page: S9896] <b><a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getpage.cgi?dbname=2003_record&page=S9896&position=all"> <cite>GPO's PDF</cite></a></b>
<p>---</pre></center>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to speak about some very exciting and heartwarming events in Monroe, Louisiana, today and tomorrow. I regret I will be unable to attend the events. But, they are very important to Marine Sergeant Phillip Randall, II, his family, the city of Monroe, and for all the people of Louisiana. Quite frankly Sgt. Rugg's actions tell a story that will be heartwarming to the Nation. 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we consider how to best defend our borders, and also as we continue to aggressively pursue the standing up of a new government in Iraq to establish a democracy there, I wish to pay tribute to our military by highlighting the heroic actions of one of the Marines' best. 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marine Sgt Phillip Randall Rugg II, is being honored today by the city of Monroe, Louisiana. Monroe is a city of about 50,000 in northeast Louisiana that has its share of men and women in the active and reserve forces serving our country at this time. They are doing the brave and difficult work necessary for us to achieve victory. Having won the war, we are now in an all-out effort to win the peace. These men and women from Louisiana and around the Nation are putting their lives on the line, 
and the Nation is grateful. 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monroe is opening its arms and its hearts to a true hero. With his wife Nicol and his 2-year-old son Trey, Sgt. Rugg will be honored by the people of Monroe. I rise to explain why. 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few months ago, on March 22, then-Corporal Rugg was serving in Iraq with the 1st Tank Battalion, the 1st Marine Division. On that day, his tank recovery vehicle was hit by at least four rocket-propelled grenades. Shrapnel from the RPGs tore through his body, leaving him unable to use his legs. His vehicle was on fire. Using only his arms, with great injury to himself, he pulled himself out of his vehicle. Once outside, he realized that his gunnery sergeant, Guadalupe Denojean, was still inside 
the burning vehicle. 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, without regard to his own safety, obviously having been severely injured with broken legs, he climbed back into the burning vehicle which was engulfed in flames and pulled the gunnery sergeant out. Regrettably, after this incident, Sgt. Rugg's wounds were not able to heal fully and his left leg had to be amputated below the knee. He may have had part of his leg removed, but no doctor or enemy weapon could remove his spirit. 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I spoke to this young marine yesterday by phone. He is proud of his service. He is proud of his country. He said: Senator, this is not a story about sadness or pity. I am proud I went to serve in defense of my nation. 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to say how proud we are of him and his family, how proud I am that one of the cities in Louisiana is honoring him today. This is the Marine spirit. It is one that has existed for over 200 years. It is a flame that will not go out. 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has now been promoted to sergeant. Again, he is proud to serve his country. As he told me yesterday: Senator, I have no regrets. I was happy to do what I did. My family is happy to support me in this effort. 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will soon reenter school to complete his degree in accounting. His other leg is rehabilitating well, and he is working with his doctors and therapists to some day not only walk, but run. He also wants to get back on the golf course. With his positive outlook, I am sure Sgt. Rugg will go on to do great things and continue to be a proud father and devoted husband. As the city of Monroe celebrates the recovery and return of Sgt. Rugg, I am certain his faith and positive outlook will only bring 
more causes for the Rugg family to celebrate in the years to come. 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Former Senator Max Cleland of Georgia is a triple amputee as a result of a grenade explosion in Vietnam. Senator Cleland says his injuries changed his life and gave him even greater purpose to serve his country as a Senator and Cabinet Secretary. Senator Cleland always says he is stronger at the broken places. After talking with Sgt. Rugg, I know that he, too, is stronger at the broken places. 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to tell Sgt. Rugg how proud the United States Senate is of his service. I want to tell the thousands of other men and women in uniform how grateful we are for what they do each day to protect and promote liberty. I want to wish Sgt. Rugg and his family well, and know my thoughts and prayers are with them. Sgt. Rugg, I salute you. 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask unanimous consent to print the following document in the <b>RECORD</b>.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the <b>RECORD</b>, as follows:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sergeant Phillip Randall Rugg, II
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phillip Randall Rugg, II was born at St. Francis Hospital in Monroe, Louisiana on April 26, 1977 to Jan Elizabeth Falletta Rugg and Phillip Randall Rugg. Randall was christened at Our Lady of Fatima church and attended Our Lady of Fatima School from grades K-8. He attended St. Frederick High School where he lettered in football, basketball, and baseball for three years and graduated with honors in 1995. Randall attended the University of Louisiana at Monroe and Louisiana Tech University from 
1995 to 1998.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On June 28, 1999, Randall joined the Marine Corps and immediately did twelve weeks of basic training at the Marine Corps Recruit Depot in San Diego, California. After basic training, Randall attended fourteen weeks of Tank Mechanic School at Fort Knox where he graduated first in his class. On February 25, 2000, Randall was assigned permanent duty at the Marine Air Ground Task Force Training Command in Twenty Nine Palms, California.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March 25, 2000, while serving at Twenty Nine Palms, Randall married Andrea Nicol Freeman of Ferriday, Louisiana. Randall received several letters of commendation and appreciation, and was meritoriously promoted twice while stationed at Twenty Nine Palms. His military achievements were overshadowed, however, by the birth of Phillip Randall Rugg, III, on March 18, 2001, whom Randall and Nicol have nicknamed Trey.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March 22, 2003, the third day of Operation Iraqi Freedom, shortly before sunrise, Randall, Sergeant Eric W. Percy and Master Gunnery Sergeant Guadalupe Denogean (referred to by his crew as ``Master Guns'') were operating an M88 Tank Recovery Vehicle when they sustained direct hits from at least five to eight rocket-propelled grenades which were fired from a nearby farmhouse. Sergeant Percy escaped the vehicle through the side door, which had been blown off in the explosion. Randall, finding 
his legs were useless managed to pull himself up to the top hatch and roll out of the vehicle from the turret, which is eighteen feet from the ground. Once out of the M88, Randall and Sergeant Percy realized that ``Master Guns'' was still inside. Randall and Sergeant Percy managed to return to the inside of the M88 and drag him to safety. Within minutes, 
Randall, Sergeant Percy, and Master Gunnery Sergeant Denogean were flown to a field hospital to receive medical attention. Sergeant Percy had received two shrapnel wounds, Sergeant Denogean had received a head injury rendering him unconscious and Randall had sustained extensive shrapnel wounds to both legs, his face, and one shoulder. The damage to Randall's
left leg was irreparable, requiring an amputation below the knee. His right leg sustained compound fractures of both lower leg bones and tissue damage requiring skin grafts. All three soldiers are recovering.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Randall spent a week in the hospital in Ramstein, Germany before being flown to Bethesda, Maryland where he spent seventeen days in the Bethesda Naval Hospital. He returned to Louisiana on April 15th. Once Randall's injuries heal and he is able to be fitted for a prosthesis for his left leg, he plans to go back to college and graduate in accounting.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Randall's story is similar to thousands who have gone before him. This Country, founded on the belief in freedom for all of her people, stands upon the shoulders of those who have, time and again, willingly stepped into harm's way to protect our freedom. Through life-altering injury to body or mind, or by paying the ultimate price, these brave young men and women and their families have borne the weight of freedom for our families  <center><pre>[Page: S9897] <b><a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getpage.cgi?dbname=2003_record&page=S9897&position=all"> <cite>GPO's PDF</cite></a></b></pre></center>
and the families of 
our children. What makes Randall special is that he is ours, and through his sacrifice, we have become his.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What an honor and a privilege it will be to thank Randall in person on July 24th and 25th, 2003. The Community Salute to Sergeant Phillip Randall Rugg, II, will feature a free community gathering at the American Legion Hall at Forsythe Park in Monroe to meet Randall from 3 to 6 p.m. on July 24th. There will be a sponsor's reception and silent auction from 7 to 10 p.m. on July 24th also at the American Legion Hall at a cost of $15 per person. The following day, July 25th, there will be a golf 
tournament at Calvert Crossing Golf Club, For information regarding sponsorships call (318) 329-5890. All checks made payable to Sergeant Phillip Randall Rugg at American Horizons Bank.
