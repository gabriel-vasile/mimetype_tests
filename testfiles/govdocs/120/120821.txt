Preface
Pictorial and Social Section
Our Standard Blue Book publications are fashioned after the Blue Books issued by the United States Government on trade conditions, blended with the improved idea of the Social Blue Book of European countries with harmonious perfection.
The social section of the Standard Blue Book of Oregon, like all of our other city, state and national publications, is held primarily above a monetary consideration in its compilation and preparation,  and  meritorious  citizenship  is first and foremost considered.
Every personal illustration contained in the work of prominent club, musical, literary, social, professional and commercial leaders of the state was selected under the advice of an advisory board, and the pretentious and mediocre were excluded.
We have eliminated from the Standard Blue Book publications, with but rare exceptions, personal sketches, reserving the right only to preserve historical data in perpetuating some distinguished pioneer citizen whose life is a part of the history of the country.
No space rates were charged for any personal photographic illustration in any of the Standard Blue Book publications, but, to insure insertion, all photographs and engravings were furnished without cost to the publishers.
We properly and justly recognize unselfish and patriotic assistance given us in making this work a success in behalf of civic, social and industrial pride in the state's best interest by dedicating a conspicuous part in the Blue Book for the enrollment of such names of the citizens   of   Oregon   to   whom   honors   are   meritoriously due.
Commanding Influence
The rapid industrial, educational and social development of Oregon demands the production in permanent form, from time to time, of a correct account of the statistical progress, professional, commercial, educational, musical and social advantages and club life of its various cities, portraying therein the names and faces of their men and women who have assisted materially in the general welfare and progress of the country and whose lives have stood for the highest order of enlightened progress.
To encourage a better class of permanent citizenship and to gain the confidence of foreign capital, and interest it in our prolific opportunities, it is just as necessary to show the refinement and stability of a community as it is to give statistical data setting out strictly the commercial  advantages.
National Record and Family History
Then again, outside of all business considerations, this work in years to come will be prized beyond a money value as a national record and family history, giving the living a lasting pleasure in commemorating the names and faces of those loved ones long since passed away to the Great Beyond, and serving as a tribute of respect to those who have done their part  faithfully  and  well  in  the  race  and progress of human life.
Success Is Due
If we have achieved any measure of success in the issuance of this edition, we want to take this opportunity to say that our success is due in part to the useful, unselfish and progressive citizens, corporations and business firms of this section of Oregon whose names are found in the Who's Who, advertising and pictorial sections of this volume. Without this aid and unqualified support, zeal and unselfish, patriotic devotion to their city and state, such an undertaking  would  have  been,   on  our part,   the wildest folly.
Ultra-conservatism, however, confronted us so formidably, it was not conducive to the issuance of a work in harmony with our own ideals or in keeping with the marvelous progress and limitless resources  of the  great  commonwealth of Oregon.
