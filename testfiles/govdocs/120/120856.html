Photomontage in low magnification of a survey view of the ventral surface of the gaster (abdomen). The terminalia are visible (bottom right of the field). The mesomeres and other parts of the male genitalia are recessed behind and beneath the terminal (tenth) abdominal sternite. In specimen preparation, the internal gut contents probably were reduced; such shrinkage would cause the abdominal sclerites to appear compressed and to overlap more than in life. ( x 40)<P>TOP RIGHT. Higher magnification of the abdominal sternal surface showing the scalelike appearance of the epicuticle. Only branched body hairs are found in this area. ( x 650)<P>BOTTOM RIGHT. Close-up of the scalelike cuticular sculpturing on a ventral abdominal sternite. Portions of two branched body hairs are visible. (x 1,400)</BODY></HTML>
