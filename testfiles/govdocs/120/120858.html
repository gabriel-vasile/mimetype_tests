<P ALIGN="justify">The western red cedar (title page and fig. 5) ranges
from southeastern Alaska to northern California.  It is a common tree in
the park.  It occurs in patches along the river bottoms where the flat
scalelike foliage is conspicuous among the needle-shaped leaves of the
hemlock and fir.  The bark is fibrous in appearance and may be readily
separated into long strips.  The trunks of the older trees are swelled
and irregularly fluted at the base.  The leaves are fragrant and the
wood has a pleasing aromatic odor.  Nearly all of the large trees are
hollow at the butt. The roots spread laterally to a great distance, but
extend only a short distance below the surface of the ground.  The tree
is easily overthrown by the wind and usually grows in sheltered
localities.  On account of the thinness of the bark it is easily killed
by fire.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The red cedar flourishes on fertile and well-watered
soils near sea level, where it grows to an enormous size.  In the park
it is a smaller tree, 150 to 170 feet high and rarely more than 4 or 5
feet through above the swollen butt.  It grows occasionally up to an
altitude of 4,000 feet, but is a small and insignificant tree in the
high mountains.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">In the sapling stage the red cedar grows rapidly. 
The mature tree increases very slowly in size.  It exceeds all other
trees in the Cascades in longevity.  Individuals more than 500 years old
are not uncommon and there is a well-authenticated instance where the
annual rings indicated a growth of more than 1,100 years.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">While the red cedar forms no great proportion of the
forest of the Pacific Northwest, it is peculiarly valuable to the
pioneer on account of the durability of the wood and the ease with which
it can be split into boards, shakes, and planking.  The early settlers
used cedar split by hand as a substitute for sawn lumber in flooring and
finishing their cabins and for the tables and shelves with which they
were furnished.  The Indians hollowed the great trunks with fire and
made them into canoes, some of which were large and seaworthy enough to
be used on the Sound and in making voyages along the coast. They wove
the fibrous roots into baskets that carried water and plaited the bark
into matting.  The wood of the red cedar is reddish brown in color.  It
is soft, light, and very brittle, but very durable.  It is extensively
used for shingles, the manufacture of which forms one of the important
industries of the State.  The clear logs are sawed into lumber used for
siding, interior and exterior finish, moldings, tank stock, and similar
purposes.  Common logs are utilized for shingles. In many localities the
entire tree is cut into 52-inch bolts, which are hauled to the mills or
floated to them down the streams.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The western red cedar makes excellent posts and rails
for farm fences. The young trees are used for telegraph and telephone
poles.</P>
