Photomontage of the left middle (mesothoracic) leg. The coxa is obscured but, proximally to distally, the trochanter, femur tibia (with spine or wax spur pointed downward), basitarsus and three additional tarsomeres, and the pretarsus with claws are visible. ( x 31)<P>BOTTOM RIGHT .  tibia-basitarsus Joint. This is a monocondylic (singlepoint) articulation.	The relatively large size and stoutness of the tibialspine are evident. ( x 93)<P>BOTTOM LEFT. Tibia-basitarsus Joint. This view and magnification make apparent the differences in the cuticular surfaces between the scalelike tibial base, the pebble-grained tibial spine, and the smooth head of the basitarsus. The two forms of setae (branched and simple trichoid) on thetibia are visible at this articulation, as well as the scales on the mtersegmental membrane at this Joint. ( x 355)</BODY></HTML>
