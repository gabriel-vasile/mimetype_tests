****:NATIVE EVERGREENS

There are few native evergreens in this region. Your Christmas tree --&nbsp;
unless it is one of those glistening imitations -- is likely to be a young&nbsp;
spruce, balsam fir, or Scotch pine from Wisconsin, Michigan,&nbsp;
Minnesota or Canada, perhaps a Douglas fir from the northwest.

Long years ago, at Christmas time in many parts of rural Illinois, it&nbsp;
was customary to search the hillsides and pastures for a well-shaped&nbsp;
young cedar to be brought home as a Christmas tree. Or, if there was&nbsp;
none, a young oak. They were decorated with strings of popcorn,&nbsp;
cranberries and tinsel, chains of colored paper, and lighted with&nbsp;
candles wired to the branches.

Red cedar, a juniper, is the most common native evergreen in Illinois&nbsp;
and Indiana. It is usually small, straight, narrow and conical in shape.&nbsp;
It has two kinds of dark green pointed needles (leaves): one kind about&nbsp;
1/2 inch long; the other very short and scalelike. The male and female&nbsp;
cones (flowers) are borne on separate trees. The fruits are little bluish&nbsp;
berrylike cones eaten by many birds in winter. The reddish aromatic&nbsp;
wood is useful for pencils and moth-proof chests and closets. Cedar&nbsp;
fence posts are famous for their durability.

The earliest surveyors of Cook County recorded the kinds of vegetation&nbsp;
encountered as they ran their lines. Their notebooks contain several&nbsp;
references to pines and cedars, chiefly near the lake. Gurdon S.&nbsp;
Hubbard, speaking of Fort Dearborn in his autobiography, said: "Back&nbsp;
of it flowed the Chicago River which, as late as 1827, emptied into&nbsp;
Lake Michigan at a point known as "The Pines", a clump of a hundred&nbsp;
or more stunted pine trees on the sand-hills about a mile from the&nbsp;
fort."

Presumably, those and the pines observed by surveyors were Jack&nbsp;
Pines. That conifer, found on poor sandy soils on the Waukegan dunes&nbsp;
and in the Illinois Beach State Park, never became more than a small&nbsp;
scrubby tree in this region. It has small cones and short stiff curved&nbsp;
needles growing in pairs -- bundles of two.

Thousands of years ago there were white pine forests here. At the&nbsp;
Dunes State Park in Indiana there are a number of native white pines,&nbsp;
and "blow-outs" along that southern shore of Lake Michigan have&nbsp;
uncovered the stumps of white pines smothered and buried, 5000 or&nbsp;
more years ago, by the moving sands. There are a few large old white&nbsp;
pines along the ravines and lake bluff at Glencoe.

There are some big white pines at Starved Rock State Park, and some&nbsp;
fine stands at White Pines State Park. Some of the older trees are 80&nbsp;
feet tall with trunk diameters of 24 inches or more. The lower&nbsp;
branches tend to die and drop off, but the upper plumelike branches&nbsp;
grow out horizontally like the spokes of a wheel.

This tree has long blue-green needles that grow in bundles of 5, and&nbsp;
long large cones. Like all pines, the male and female flowers are borne&nbsp;
separately on the same tree. Its wood, being soft, light, even-textured&nbsp;
and remarkably durable, has always been in great demand. The&nbsp;
buildings in early Chicago and the farm buildings in northeastern&nbsp;
Illinois were built with white pine lumber from the great forests that&nbsp;
grew in the lake states. They enabled this city to rebuild after the great&nbsp;
fire in 1871. White pine trees became the masts for many a sailing&nbsp;
ship.

Four native evergreen shrubs, now rare in the Chicago region, are: the&nbsp;
Arbor Vitae or White Cedar, which prefers wet places and has short,&nbsp;
pointed leaves growing in flat sprays; the Trailing Juniper, found in&nbsp;
dense carpets on the Waukegan dunes; the Common Juniper, growing&nbsp;
as prickly mats on sandy barrens; and the American Yew on limestone&nbsp;
cliffs at the Starved Rock, White Pines, and Apple River Canyon state&nbsp;
parks.

Have a merry Christmas!
