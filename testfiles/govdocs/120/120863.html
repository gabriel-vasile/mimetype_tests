<p class="top0 bottom10">DESCRIPTION:</p>

<p class="top0 bottom10">Solano grass (<span class="italic">Tuctoria mucronata</span>), also known as Crampton's tuctoria,
is a small (1 to 8-inch) annual in the grass family (Poaceae). It produces stems and leaves covered with small droplets of 
the sticky, acrid secretion. This is characteristic of the genus <span class="italic">Tuctoria</span>, which includes the
endangered <a href="../plant_spp_accts/greenes_tuctoria.htm">Greene's tuctoria</a> (<span class="italic">Tuctoria greenei</span>) and the genus 
<span class="italic">Neostapfia</span>, which contains only the threatened <a href="../plant_spp_accts/colusa_grass.htm">Colusa grass</a> 
(<span class="italic">Neostapfia colusana</span>). The several solid stems grow somewhat decumbently (lying on the ground), 
turning up only at the tips. The leaves lack ligules, the small, scalelike leaf outgrowths found on some grasses.</p>

<p class="top0 bottom20">This species blooms from April to July. Seven to 19 spikelets overlap one another the full length 
of the spike-like inflorescence. Unlike other closely related species, the inflorescence of Solano grass remains partially
enclosed by the upper leaf sheath and is never fully exerted from the uppermost leaf. The lemma (bract) ends in a single 
tooth with a short, narrow point. See Hickman (1993) in General Information about California Plants, below,for a detailed 
description of the species (as Crampton's tuctoria.)</p>

<p class="top0 bottom10">DISTRIBUTION:</p>

<p class="top0 bottom10">Solano grass was last seen in 1993 at its original location, Olcott Lake within the Solano Land 
Trust's <a href="http://www.solanolandtrust.org/o_l_jepsonPrairie.php"> Jepson Prairie Preserve</a>, when four individual plants 
were present.</p>

<p class="top0 bottom20">A second population was discovered on private lands in 1985, and another was discovered in 1993 
on a former U.S. Air Force Base communication facility that is being transferred to the Yolo County Parks Department. Several 
thousandindividual plants were seen at this site in 2000.</p>

<p class="top0 bottom10">THREATS:</p>

<p class="top0 bottom20">Threats to Solano grass include alteration of hydrology, excessive livestock grazing, recreational uses, 
and competition from non-native plants.</p>
