</center>
<p><b>Abandoned Floodplain (Terrace):</b> Flat, depositional surface adjacent to 
and higher than the active floodplain. It never floods of floods infrequently.
</p>
<p><b>Abandoned Meanders (Cutoff or Oxbow):</b> As a meander tightens or 
decreases its radius of curvature, water is slowed as it tries to follow the 
tighter curve. The slower water tends to raise the water surface elevation at 
the entrance into the meander. The tighter curve also results in a shorter 
distance overland across the neck of the meander. High flows tend to go across 
the neck of the meander and a head cut starts where the high flows reenter the 
channel downstream at the exit point of the meander. The headcut advances 
upstream, across the neck of the meander and the new, shorter flow path captures 
the stream flow. As flows recede, the meander is abandoned or cutoff from the 
main channel. </p>
<p><b>Abatement:</b> Reducing the degree or intensity of, or eliminating, 
pollution. </p>
<p><b>Ablation:</b> The process by which ice and snow waste away as a result of 
melting and/or evaporation. </p>
<p><b>Acid rain:</b> Rainfall with a pH of less than 7.0. Long-term deposition 
of these acids is linked to adverse effects on aquatic organisms and plant life 
in areas with poor neutralizing (buffering) capacity. </p>
<p><b>Acidic:</b> The condition of water or soil in which the amount of acid 
substances are sufficient to lower the pH below 7.0. </p>
<p><b>Acre:</b> A measure of area equal to 43,560 ft<sup>2</sup> (4,046.87 m<sup>2</sup>). 
One square mile equals 640 acres. </p>
<p><b>Acre-foot (af):</b> A quantity or volume of water covering 1 acre to a 
depth of 1 ft; equal to 43,560 ft<sup>3</sup> or 325,851 gal. </p>
<p><b>Active Channel:</b> Area of stream bottom and banks void of vegetation. It 
is frequently submerged and its boundaries typically consist of sediment 
particles moved by the stream. </p>
<p><b>Active storage capacity:</b> The total usable reservoir capacity available 
for seasonal or cyclic water storage. It is gross reservoir capacity minus 
inactive storage capacity. </p>

<p><b>Adjustment process:</b> or type 
of change, that is underway due to natural causes or human activity that has or 
will result in a change to the valley, floodplain, and/or channel condition 
(e.g., vertical, lateral, or channel plan form adjustment processes).</p>

<p><b>Aeration:</b> Any active or passive process by which intimate contact 
between air and liquid is assured, generally by spraying liquid in the air, 
bubbling air through water, or mechanical agitation of the liquid to promote 
surface absorption of air. </p>
<p><b>Aerobic:</b> Characterizing organisms able to live only in the presence of 
air or free oxygen, and conditions that exist only in the presence of air or 
free oxygen. Contrast with anaerobic. </p>
<p><b>Affluent (stream):</b> A stream or river that flows into a larger one; a 
tributary. </p>
<p><b>Afterbay:</b> A reservoir that regulates fluctuating discharges from a 
hydroelectric power plant or a pumping plant. </p>
<p><b>Aggradation:</b> A progressive buildup or raising of the channel bed and 
floodplain due to sediment deposition. The geologic process by which streambeds 
are raised in elevation and floodplains are formed. Aggradation indicates that 
stream discharge and/or bed-load characteristics are changing. Opposite of 
degradation. </p>
<p><b>Algae:</b> Microscopic plants that grow in sunlit water containing 
phosphates, nitrates, and other nutrients. Algae, like all aquatic plants, add 
oxygen to the water and are important in the fish food chain. </p>
<p><b>Alluvial:</b> Deposited by running water. </p>
<p><b>Alluvium:</b> A general term for detrital deposits make by streams on 
riverbeds, floodplains, and alluvial fans; esp. a deposit of silt or silty clay 
laid down during time of flood. The term applies to stream deposits of recent 
time. It does not include subaqueous sediments of seas or lakes. </p>
<p><b>Amplitude:</b> The &quot;height&quot; of a meander or the perpendicular distance from 
an imaginary line drawn through the crossovers upstream and downstream of a 
meander to the apex of the meander. </p>
<p><b>Anabranch:</b> A diverging branch of a river that re-enters the main 
stream. </p>
<p><b>Anadromous:</b> Pertaining to fish that spend a part of their life cycle 
in the sea and return to freshwater streams to spawn. </p>
<p><b>Angler-day:</b> The time spent fishing for any part of a day by one 
person. </p>
<p><b>Apex:</b> The top of the bend at the outside bank of a channel. </p>
<p><b>Aqueduct:</b> A pipe or conduit made to bring water from a source. </p>
<p><b>Aquatic ecosystem:</b> Any body of water, such as a stream, lake, or 
estuary, and all organisms and nonliving components within it, functioning as a 
natural system. </p>
<p><b>Aquatic habitat:</b> Habitat that occurs in free water. </p>
<p><b>Aquifer:</b> A body of rock that is sufficiently permeable to conduct 
groundwater and to yield economically significant quantities of water to wells 
and springs. </p>
<p><b>Arid:</b> A term describing a climate or region in which precipitation is 
so deficient in quantity or occurs so infrequently that intensive agricultural 
production is not possible without irrigation. </p>
<p><b>Armoring:</b> A natural process where an erosion-resistant layer of 
relatively large particles is established on the surface of the streambed 
through removal of finer particles by stream flow. A properly armored streambed 
generally resists movement of bed material at discharges up to approximately 3/4 
bankfull depth. </p>
<p><b>Artificial recharge:</b> Addition of surface water to a groundwater 
reservoir by human activity, such as putting surface water into spreading 
basins. See also groundwater recharge, recharge basin. </p>
<p><b>Augmentation (of stream flow):</b> Increasing stream flow under normal 
conditions, by releasing storage water from reservoirs. </p>
<p><b>Average annual runoff:</b> For a specified area, it is the average value 
of annual runoff amounts calculated for a whole hydrologic cycle of record that 
represents average hydrologic conditions. </p>
<p><b>Average year supply:</b> The average annual supply of a water development 
system over a whole hydrologic cycle. </p>
<p><b>Average year water demand:</b> Demand for water under average hydrologic 
conditions for a defined level of development. </p>
<p><b>Avulsion:</b> A change in channel course that occurs when a stream 
suddenly breaks through its banks, typically bisecting an overextended meander 
arc. </p>

hide from predators, to avoid warm water temperatures, and to rest, by avoiding 
higher velocity water.&nbsp; These animals come in all sizes, so even cobbles on the 
stream bottom that are not sedimented in with fine sands and silt can serve as 
cover for small fish and salamanders.&nbsp; Larger fish and reptiles often use large 
boulders, undercut banks, submerged logs, and snags for cover.</p>
<p><b>Creel census survey:</b> The collection of data concerning the number of 
fish caught by sport fishers on a particular stream or in a particular area. </p>
<p><b>Critical habitat:</b> Under the Endangered Species Act, critical habitat 
is defined as (1) the specific areas within the geographic area occupied by a 
federally listed species on which are found physical and biological features 
essential to the conservation of the species, and that may require special 
management considerations or protections; and (2) specific areas outside the 
geographic area occupied by a listed species, when it is determined that such 
areas are essential for the conservation of the species. </p>

by such erosion. </p>
<p><b>Wastewater:</b> The used water, liquid waste, or drainage from a 
community, industry, or institution. </p>
<p><b>Water conservation:</b> Reduction in applied water due to more efficient 
water use such as implementation of Urban Best Management Practices or 
Agricultural Efficient Water Management Practices. The extent to which these 
actions actually create a savings in water supply depends on how they affect net 
water use and depletion. </p>
<p><b>Water demand schedule:</b> A time distribution of the demand for 
prescribed quantities of water for specified purposes. It is usually a monthly 
tabulation of the total quantity of water that a particular water user intends 
to use during a specified year. </p>
<p><b>Water pollution:</b> Generally, the presence in water of enough harmful or 
objectionable material to damage the water's quality. </p>
<p><b>Water quality:</b> A term used to describe the chemical, physical, and 
biological characteristics of water, usually in respect to its suitability for a 
particular purpose. </p>
<p><b>Water reclamation:</b> Includes water recycling, seawater desalting, 
groundwater reclamation, and desalting agricultural brackish water. </p>
<p><b>Water recycling:</b> The treatment of urban wastewater to a level 
rendering it suitable for a specific, direct, beneficial use. </p>
<p><b>Water right:</b> A legally protected right to take possession of water 
occurring in a natural waterway and to divert that water for beneficial use. </p>
<p><b>Water table:</b> See groundwater table. </p>
<p><b>Water year:</b> A continuous 12-month period for which hydrologic records 
are compiled and summarized. In California, it begins on October 1 and ends 
September 30 of the following year. </p>
<p><b>Water yield:</b> The quantity of water derived from a unit area of 
watershed. </p>
<p><b>Waterfall:</b> A sudden, nearly vertical drop in a stream, as it flows 
over rock. </p>
<p><b>Watershed:</b> An area of land whose total surface drainage flows to a 
single point in a stream. </p>
<p><b>Watershed management:</b> The analysis, protection, development, 
operation, or maintenance of the land, vegetation, and water resources of a 
drainage basin for the conservation of all its resources for the benefit of its 
residents. </p>
<p><b>Watershed project:</b> A comprehensive program of structural and 
nonstructural measures to preserve or restore a watershed to good hydrologic 
condition. These measures may include detention reservoirs, dikes, channels, 
contour trenches, terraces, furrows, gully plugs, revegetation, and possibly 
other practices to reduce flood peaks and sediment production. </p>
<p><b>Watershed restoration:</b> Improving current conditions of watersheds to 
restore degraded habitat and provide long-term protection to aquatic and 
riparian resources. </p>
<p><b>Weibul Distribution:</b> is an extreme value distribution probability plot 
based on the plotting position of Peak Annual Discharge data. Where <i>n</i> is 
the total number of values to be plotted and <i>m</i> is the rank of the Peak 
Annual Discharge values in descending order by magnitude (ie, 1 is assigned to 
the maximum peak discharge), the exceedance probability of the <i>m</i>th 
largest value, <i>x<sub>m</sub></i>, is: <b><i>P(x<sub>m</sub>) = m/(n+1)</i></b> 
The plotted data are then fitted with a straight line for interpolation, 
extrapolation, or comparison purposes. </p>
<p><b>Weir:</b> A structure to control water levels in a stream. Depending upon 
the configuration, weirs can provide a specific &quot;rating&quot; for discharge as a 
function of the upstream water level. </p>
<p><b>Weir (fish trap):</b> Usually a barrier constructed to catch upstream 
migrating adult fish. </p>
<p><b>Wild rivers:</b> Rivers or sections of rivers that are free of 
impoundments and generally inaccessible except by trail, with watersheds or 
shorelines essentially primitive and waters unpolluted. </p>
<p><b>Windfall:</b> Trees or parts of trees felled by high winds. </p>
<p><b>Wildlife tree:</b> A live tree retained to become future snag habitat. </p>
<p><b>Windthrow:</b> A tree or trees uprooted or felled by the wind. </p>
<p><b>Woody debris:</b> Referring to wood in streams. </p>
