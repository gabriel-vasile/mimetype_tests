                          <p align="center" class="head02a">&nbsp;</p>
                          <p align="left" class="whatsnew"><a href="downloads/terms.pdf"><img src="images/Cover.gif" width="143" height="186" border="0" align="left"></a>The terminology used in forest engineering and harvesting has evolved over many years, beginning with the early lumberjacks who cut trees for homes and industry. With increased mechanization since the early 1940's, the meanings of some terms have changed, and many new terms have been added. Changes in forest management and increased utilization of the forest brought about by new products have also added to the scope of forest engineering terminology. With the increasing cost and complexity of forest operations, there is an ever-growing need for standardization of forest engineering terminology. The objective of this publication is to provide a glossary of definitions for a broad group of terms used in forestry and in forest engineering, with an emphasis on harvesting. This list of terms and definitions should result in better communication among people involved in forest engineering.<br>
                          </p>
                          <p class="whatsnew">A literature review was conducted to assemble the terms from published sources in an attempt to exclude colloquial terminology. The literature citations referenced for each term follow the definition (in parentheses). References are listed in the literature cited section.<br>
                          </p>
                          <p class="whatsnew">Although this collection does not include all timber harvesting and forest engineering terms, it is hoped that the compilation will provide a sufficiently extensive glossary for forest operations. The references listed can be used as sources for terms not found in this publication.</p>

                            <em>Loader</em> - Self-propelled or mobile machine with grapple and supporting structure designed to pick up and discharge trees or parts of trees for the purpose of piling or loading. Operation may be swing-to-load, slide-to-load, or travel-to-load. Also known as hydraulic loader or knuckleboom if it swings to load and has hydraulically activated boom members.<br>
                            <em>Mobile yarder </em>- Self-propelled or mobile machine designed to perform cable logging with the use of a tower that may be integral to the machine or a separate structure.<br>
