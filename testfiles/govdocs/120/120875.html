  <p><b>urban and other areas: </b> Areas 
    developed for residential, industrial, or recreational purposes, school yards, 
    cemeteries, roads, railroads, airports, beaches, powerlines and other rights-of-way, 
    or other nonforest land not included in any other specified land use class.</p>
  <p><b>value added: </b>the sum of all income deriving from an industry, including 
    wage income and owner income, less business taxes.</p>
  <p><b>values:</b> relatively firmly held and socially 
    shared positions or expressions about what is good or right; they are abstract 
    and normative and are considered to be somewhat stable.</p>
  <p><b>volume of live trees:</b> 
 The cubic-foot volume of sound wood in live trees 
    at least 5.0 inches d.b.h. from a 1-foot stump to a minimum 4.0-inch top d.o.b. 
    of the central stem.</p>
  <p><b>water quality standard:</b>  
    a standard that defines the goals for a water body or portion of a water body, 
    by designating the beneficial use or uses to be made of the water and by setting 
    criteria necessary to protect the uses. Water quality standards should provide 
    for the protection and propagation of fish, shellfish, and wildlife and for 
    recreation in and on the water, and should take into consideration the use 
    and value of public water supplies. Such standards establish water quality 
    goals for a specific water body and serve as the regulatory basis for the 
    establishment of water quality-based treatment controls and strategies beyond 
    the technology-based treatment required by sections 301(b) and 306 of the 
    CWA.</p>
  <p><b>watershed:</b> the area of land above a given point 
    on a stream that contributes water to the volume of a body of surface water; 
    also referred to as a drainage basin.</p>
  <p><b>wetlands: </b>
those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or ground water 
    at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances 
    do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated 
    soil conditions (U.S. ACE 1987). Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, 
    bogs, and similar areas; (2) lands that are transitional between terrestrial 
    and aquatic systems where the water table is usually at or near the surface 
    of the land and is covered by shallow water. For purposes of this classification, 
    wetlands must have one or more of the following attributes: (1) at least periodically, 
    the land predominantly supports hydrophytes (plants dependent on saturated 
    soils or a water medium); (2) the substrate is predominantly undrained hydric 
    soil; and (3) the substrate is nonsoil and is saturated with water or covered 
    by shallow water at some time during the growing season of each year.</p>
  <p><b>wild rivers: </b>rivers or segments of rivers included in the NWSRS (P.L. 
    542-82 stat. 906, as amended) that are free of impoundments; are generally 
    inaccessible except by trail; and the watersheds and shorelines of which are 
    essentially primitive and unpolluted.</p>
  <p><b>wilderness:</b> a Congressionally-designated area 
    that provides opportunities for solitude and primitive, unconfined recreational 
    experiences. There are no constructed facilities such as campgrounds, picnic 
    areas, or interpretive sites and motorized and mechanized vehicles are prohibited.</p>
  <p><b>wildfire:</b> any fire that is not burning for 
    a prescribed management purpose or being managed as a prescribed fire.</p>
  <p><b>woodland range: </b>forest land (within range allotments) that produces minor 
    amounts of forage. It includes occasional even-aged timber harvest areas that 
    have higher forage value for several years before being replaced by shrubs 
    and trees.</p>
  <p><b>woodland:</b> Forest land incapable of producing 
    20 cubic feet per acre per year of industrial wood under natural   conditions, 
    because of adverse site conditions.  </p>
