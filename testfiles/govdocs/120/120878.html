Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Final Designation&nbsp;
of Critical Habitat for Four Vernal Pool Crustaceans and Eleven Vernal&nbsp;
Pool Plants in California and Southern Oregon

AGENCY: Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.

ACTION: Final rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: We, the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), designate&nbsp;
critical habitat pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as&nbsp;
amended (Act), for 4 vernal pool crustaceans and 11 vernal pool plants.&nbsp;
A total of approximately 1,184,513 ac (417,989 ha) of land falls within&nbsp;
the boundaries of designated critical habitat. This estimate reflects&nbsp;
the exclusion of National Wildlife Refuge lands and National fish&nbsp;
hatchery lands (33,097 ac (13,238 ha)), and State lands within&nbsp;
ecological reserves and wildlife management areas (20,933 ac (8,373&nbsp;
ha)) from the final designation. However, the area estimate does not&nbsp;
reflect the exclusion of lands within the following California&nbsp;
counties: Butte, Madera, Merced, Sacramento, and Solano from the final&nbsp;
designation pursuant to section 4(b)(2) of the Act.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This critical habitat designation requires us to consult under&nbsp;
section 7 of the Act with regard to actions authorized, funded, or&nbsp;
carried out by a Federal agency. Section 4 of the Act requires us to&nbsp;
consider economic and other relevant impacts when specifying any&nbsp;
particular area as critical habitat. We solicited data and comments&nbsp;
from the public on all aspects of the proposed rule, including data on&nbsp;
economic and other impacts of the designation.

DATES: This final rule is effective September 5, 2003.

ADDRESSES: Comments and materials received, as well as supporting&nbsp;
documentation used in the preparation of this final rule, will be&nbsp;
available for public inspection, by appointment, during normal business&nbsp;
hours at the Sacramento Fish and Wildlife Office, U.S. Fish and&nbsp;
Wildlife Service, 2800 Cottage, Room W-2605, Sacramento, CA 95825.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Preamble

Designation of Critical Habitat Provides Little Additional Protection&nbsp;
to Species

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 30 years of implementing the ESA, the Service has found that the&nbsp;
designation of statutory critical habitat provides little additional&nbsp;
protection to most listed species, while consuming significant amounts&nbsp;
of conservation resources. The Service's present system for designating&nbsp;
critical habitat is driven by litigation rather than biology, limits&nbsp;
our ability to fully evaluate the science involved, consumes enormous&nbsp;
agency resources, and imposes huge social and economic costs. The&nbsp;
Service believes that additional agency discretion would allow our&nbsp;
focus to return to those actions that provide the greatest benefit to&nbsp;
the species most in need of protection.

Role of Critical Habitat in Actual Practice of Administering and&nbsp;
Implementing the Act

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While attention to and protection of habitat is paramount to&nbsp;
successful conservation actions, we have consistently found that, in&nbsp;
most circumstances, the designation of critical habitat is of little&nbsp;
additional value for most listed species, yet it consumes large amounts&nbsp;
of conservation resources. Sidle (1987) stated, ``Because the ESA can&nbsp;
protect species with and without critical habitat designation, critical&nbsp;
habitat designation may be redundant to the other consultation&nbsp;
requirements of section 7.''
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, only 306 species or 25 percent of the 1,211 listed&nbsp;
species in the U.S. under the jurisdiction of the Service have&nbsp;
designated critical habitat. We address the habitat needs of all 1,211&nbsp;
listed species through conservation mechanisms such as listing, section&nbsp;
7 consultations, the Section 4 recovery planning process, the Section 9&nbsp;
protective prohibitions of unauthorized take, Section 6 funding to the&nbsp;
States, and the Section 10 incidental take permit process. The Service&nbsp;
believes that it is these measures that may make the difference between&nbsp;
extinction and survival for many species.

Procedural and Resource Difficulties in Designating Critical Habitat

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have been inundated with lawsuits regarding critical habitat&nbsp;
designation, and we face a growing number of lawsuits challenging&nbsp;
critical habitat determinations once they are made. These lawsuits have&nbsp;
subjected the Service to an ever-increasing series of court orders and&nbsp;
court-approved settlement agreements, compliance with which now&nbsp;
consumes nearly the entire listing program budget. This leaves the&nbsp;
Service with little ability to prioritize its activities to direct&nbsp;
scarce listing resources to the listing program actions with the most&nbsp;
biologically urgent species conservation needs.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The consequence of the critical habitat litigation activity is that&nbsp;
limited listing funds are used to defend active lawsuits and to comply&nbsp;
with the growing number of adverse court orders. As a result, the&nbsp;
Service's own proposals to undertake conservation actions based on&nbsp;
biological priorities are significantly delayed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The accelerated schedules of court ordered designations have left&nbsp;
the Service with almost no ability to provide for additional public&nbsp;
participation beyond those minimally required by the APA, the Act, and&nbsp;
the Service's implementing regulations, or to take additional time for&nbsp;
review of comments and information to ensure the rule has addressed all&nbsp;
the pertinent issues before making decisions on listing and critical&nbsp;
habitat proposals, due to the risks associated with noncompliance with&nbsp;
judicially imposed. This in turn fosters a second round of litigation&nbsp;
in which those who will suffer adverse impacts from these decisions&nbsp;
challenge them. The cycle of litigation appears endless, is very&nbsp;
expensive, and in the final analysis provides little additional&nbsp;
protection to listed species.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The costs resulting from the designation include legal costs, the&nbsp;
cost of preparation and publication of the designation, the analysis of&nbsp;
the economic effects and the cost of requesting and responding to&nbsp;
public comment, and in some cases the costs of compliance with NEPA,&nbsp;
all are part of the cost of critical habitat designation. These costs&nbsp;
result in minimal benefits to the species that is not already afforded&nbsp;
by the protections of the Act enumerated earlier, and they directly&nbsp;
reduce the funds available for direct and tangible conservation&nbsp;
actions.

Background

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the basis of the final economic analysis and other relevant&nbsp;
impacts, as outlined under section 4(b)(2) of the Act, certain&nbsp;
exclusions have been made, as detailed below. Because of the settlement&nbsp;
agreement that requires us to deliver this rule to the Federal Register&nbsp;
by July 15, 2003, there was insufficient time to revise the rule to&nbsp;
fully reflect these exclusions. A technical amendment to the rule to&nbsp;
take these areas out of the maps and legal descriptions, as well to&nbsp;
change all the

[[Page 46685]]

appropriate references in the text of this preamble will be completed&nbsp;
as soon as funding allows.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following counties are excluded from this rule under Section&nbsp;
4(b)(2): Butte, Madera, Merced, Solano, and Sacramento. We find that&nbsp;
the benefits of excluding these areas from critical habitat outweigh&nbsp;
the benefits of including them. See further discussion under the&nbsp;
Section 4(B)(2) analysis subheading below.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vernal pool crustaceans and plants live in vernal pools (shallow&nbsp;
depressions that hold water seasonally), swales (shallow drainages that&nbsp;
carry water seasonally), and ephemeral (short-lived) freshwater&nbsp;
habitats. None are known to occur in riverine waters, marine waters, or&nbsp;
other permanent bodies of water. The vernal pool habitats of the 4&nbsp;
vernal pool crustaceans and 11 plants addressed in this final rule have&nbsp;
a discontinuous distribution west of the Sierra Nevada that extends&nbsp;
from southern Oregon through California into northern Baja California,&nbsp;
Mexico (Holland and Jain 1978, 1988; Eriksen and Belk 1999).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vernal pools are a unique kind of wetland ecosystem. Central to&nbsp;
their distinctive ecology is that they are vernal or ephemeral,&nbsp;
occurring temporarily--typically during the spring following fall and&nbsp;
winter rains--and then disappearing until the next year. They are wet&nbsp;
long enough to be different in character and species composition from&nbsp;
the surrounding upland habitats, and yet their prolonged annual dry&nbsp;
phase prevents the establishment of species typical of more permanent&nbsp;
wetlands. In California, where extensive areas of vernal pool habitat&nbsp;
developed over long periods of time, unique suites of species specially&nbsp;
adapted to the unusual conditions of vernal pools have evolved. Fish&nbsp;
and other predators are among the species excluded by vernal pools'&nbsp;
annual drying, so vernal pool communities have developed and flourished&nbsp;
in the absence of many predators. California vernal pools are also&nbsp;
renowned for their showy displays of wildflowers, blooming in&nbsp;
concentric rings about the pools in spring.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many areas in California and portions of southern Oregon have the&nbsp;
combination of environmental conditions that favor the development of&nbsp;
vernal pools (Keeley and Zedler 1998). The climate is of a type&nbsp;
classified as Mediterranean, with a wet season when rainfall exceeds&nbsp;
evaporation, filling the pools, and a dry season when evaporation is&nbsp;
greater, drying the pools. Rainfall is relatively meager even in most&nbsp;
wet seasons, so erosion by overflowing waters does not dissect the&nbsp;
topographic irregularities that form vernal pool basins. Temperatures&nbsp;
during the fall and winter wet season are mild, so plants and animals&nbsp;
can grow, mature, and reproduce.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A second major factor in the development of vernal pools is soil.&nbsp;
Vernal pools form where there is a soil layer below or at the surface&nbsp;
that is impermeable or nearly impermeable to water (Smith and Verrill&nbsp;
1998). Precipitation and surface runoff become trapped or ``perched''&nbsp;
above this layer. In California, the restrictive soil layers underlying&nbsp;
vernal pools are of four main types: hardpans, claypans, volcanic&nbsp;
flows, and non-volcanic rock. Hardpans are formed by leaching,&nbsp;
redeposition, and cementing of silica minerals from high in the soil&nbsp;
profile to a lower (``B'') horizon (Hobson and Dahlgren 1998; Smith and&nbsp;
Verrill 1998). Claypans are formed by another redeposition process--
fine clay particles are transported to the B horizon and accumulate&nbsp;
there. Claypans may also be augmented by redeposition of saline or&nbsp;
alkaline compounds. Hardpans and claypans both develop gradually over&nbsp;
thousands of years, and can be a yard (meter) or more thick. Smith and&nbsp;
Verrill (1998) list many of the soil series associated with vernal&nbsp;
pools in the Central Valley. Volcanic flows include basaltic lavas and&nbsp;
cemented mudflows, and are most common along the lower western slope of&nbsp;
the Sierra Nevada. The soil parent material underlying vernal pools&nbsp;
greatly influences species composition and hydrologic functioning of&nbsp;
the vernal pool (Hanes and Stromberg 1998; Smith and Verrill 1998).&nbsp;
Soils beneath vernal pools are extremely variable and may not be the&nbsp;
same as soils mapped by soil surveys (Holland and Dain 1990).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A third factor, related to soil and climate, is topography or&nbsp;
relief. Vernal pools typically occur in landscapes that, on a broad&nbsp;
scale, are shallowly sloping or nearly level, but on a fine scale may&nbsp;
be quite bumpy. Complex microrelief results in shallow, undrained&nbsp;
depressions that form vernal pools. Some vernal pool landscapes are&nbsp;
dotted with numerous rounded soil mounds known as mima mounds (Scheffer&nbsp;
1947). From the air, vernal pool landscapes often show characteristic&nbsp;
patterning, produced by plant responses to mound and trough&nbsp;
microrelief. This patterning has allowed mapping of vernal pool&nbsp;
habitats throughout California's Central Valley and adjacent coastal&nbsp;
foothill areas to a scale between 10 and 40 acre units (Holland 1998,&nbsp;
2003).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vernal pools come in a variety of shapes and sizes, from less than&nbsp;
a square yard (1 meter) to 2.5 ac (1 ha) or more. Some larger vernal&nbsp;
wetlands, such as the 90 ac (36 ha) Olcott Lake in the Jepson Prairie&nbsp;
Preserve in Solano County, are also referred to as playa pools or&nbsp;
lakes. Playa pools with high alkalinity are termed alkali sinks. These&nbsp;
larger wetlands contain many of the same animals and plants of smaller&nbsp;
vernal pools, including many rare, threatened, and endangered species.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since appropriate combinations of climate, soil, and topography&nbsp;
often occur over continuous areas rather than in isolated spots, vernal&nbsp;
pools in California, particularly in the Central Valley, tend to occur&nbsp;
in clusters called ``complexes.'' A landscape that supports a vernal&nbsp;
pool complex is typically a grassland, with areas of obstructed&nbsp;
drainage that form the pools. Vernal pools can also be found in a&nbsp;
variety of other habitats, including woodland, desert, chaparral, or&nbsp;
pine forest. The pools may be fed or connected by low drainage pathways&nbsp;
called ``swales.'' Swales are often themselves seasonal wetlands that&nbsp;
remain saturated for much of the wet season, but may not be inundated&nbsp;
long enough to develop strong vernal pool characteristics. Swales, due&nbsp;
to their connection to adjacent pools, are considered part of the&nbsp;
vernal pool complex.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vernal pools begin to fill with the fall and winter rains. Before&nbsp;
ponding occurs, there is a period during which the soil is wetted and&nbsp;
the local water table may rise. Some pools have a substantial watershed&nbsp;
that contributes to their water inputs; others may fill almost entirely&nbsp;
from rain falling directly into the pool (Hanes and Stromberg 1998).&nbsp;
Although exceptions are not uncommon, the watershed generally&nbsp;
contributes more to the filling of larger or deeper pools, especially&nbsp;
playa pools. Even in pools filled primarily by direct precipitation,&nbsp;
Hanes and Stromberg (1998) report that subsurface inflows from&nbsp;
surrounding soils can help dampen water level fluctuations during late&nbsp;
winter and early spring. Vernal pools exhibit four major phases: (1)&nbsp;
The wetting phase, when vernal pool soils become saturated; (2) the&nbsp;
aquatic phase, when a perched water table develops and the vernal pool&nbsp;
contains water; (3) a water-logged drying phase, when the vernal pool&nbsp;
begins losing water as a result of evaporation and loss to the&nbsp;
surrounding soils but soil moisture remains high; and (4) the dry&nbsp;
phase, when the vernal pool and underlying soils are completely dry&nbsp;
(Keeley and Zedler 1998). Upland areas associated with vernal pools are&nbsp;
also an important source of nutrients to vernal pool organisms (Wetzel&nbsp;
1975). Vernal pool

[[Page 46686]]

habitats derive most of their nutrients from detritus (decaying matter)&nbsp;
washed into pools from adjacent uplands, and these nutrients provide&nbsp;
the foundation for a vernal pool aquatic community's food chain.&nbsp;
Detritus is a primary food source for the vernal pool crustaceans&nbsp;
addressed in this rule (Eriksen and Belk 1999). Because vernal pools&nbsp;
are mostly rain-fed, they tend to have low nutrient levels and dramatic&nbsp;
daily fluctuations in pH, dissolved oxygen, and carbon dioxide (Keeley&nbsp;
and Zedler 1998).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both the amount and timing of rainfall in California and Oregon&nbsp;
vary greatly from year to year. As a result, pools may fill to&nbsp;
different extents at different times. The duration of ponding of vernal&nbsp;
pools also varies, and in certain years some pools may not fill at all.&nbsp;
Many characteristics of vernal pool plants and animals result from&nbsp;
these organisms' adaptations to the highly variable and unpredictable&nbsp;
nature of vernal pools (Holland 1976; Holland and Dains 1990; King et&nbsp;
al. 1996; Hanes and Stromberg 1998).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compared to vernal pools worldwide, vernal pools in California and&nbsp;
Oregon are rich in species composition and contain many species that&nbsp;
are endemic to the region (found nowhere else). In addition, while most&nbsp;
of California's grasslands are now dominated by nonnative grasses and&nbsp;
other introduced plants, vernal pools remain a haven for native&nbsp;
species. Invasive nonnative plants have been introduced into California&nbsp;
and have spread and reproduced in upland habitats so successfully that&nbsp;
it is not unusual for nonnatives to account for a third of the species&nbsp;
and more than 90 percent of the biomass in a California grassland.&nbsp;
Vernal pools have dramatically resisted this invasion: 75 to 95 percent&nbsp;
of plant species found in vernal pools are native, and natives dominate&nbsp;
in biomass as well as in number (Holland and Jain 1978; Jokerst 1990;&nbsp;
Spencer and Rieseberg 1998). Vernal pool plant communities are able to&nbsp;
resist invasion of upland species because of the severe ecological&nbsp;
constraints on plants living in vernal pool environments.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The animal communities that live in vernal pools also contain&nbsp;
diverse groups of highly specialized species. The freshwater crustacean&nbsp;
communities of vernal pools are particularly well developed (Simovich&nbsp;
1998). The most visible crustaceans in vernal pools are the large&nbsp;
branchiopods (literally, ``gill-foots''), about 27 species in&nbsp;
California, of which perhaps 10 are endemic (Helm 1998; Belk and Fugate&nbsp;
2000) and 6 are federally listed as threatened or endangered. The large&nbsp;
branchiopods are easily visible to the naked eye, ranging up to 2&nbsp;
inches (in) (5 centimeters (cm)) in length, depending on the species.&nbsp;
They include the fairy shrimps (Anostraca), tadpole shrimps&nbsp;
(Notostraca), and clam shrimps (Spinicaudata and Laevicaudata). Smaller&nbsp;
crustaceans that are common in California vernal pools, many large&nbsp;
enough to see without magnification, are water fleas (Branchiopoda-
Cladocera), copepods (Copepoda), and seed shrimp (Ostracoda).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amphibians and many insect species also live in vernal pools. The&nbsp;
Pacific tree frog (Hyla (Pseudacris) regilla) and western toad (Bufo&nbsp;
boreas) are common and abundant in and around vernal pools. Two rarer&nbsp;
amphibians native to vernal pools are the California tiger salamander&nbsp;
(Ambystoma californiense) and the western spadefoot toad (Scaphiopus&nbsp;
(Spea) hammondii) (Morey 1998). While dispersing bullfrogs (Rana&nbsp;
catesbeiana), which are not native to California, are sometimes found&nbsp;
in vernal pools, they do not successfully breed there because bullfrog&nbsp;
tadpoles require 2 years to mature and cannot survive the dry season.&nbsp;
These voracious introduced predators will sometimes be found resting&nbsp;
and feeding in vernal pools close to more permanent water, frequently&nbsp;
associated with human modifications of the landscape. Fish likewise do&nbsp;
not inhabit vernal pools, except where temporarily introduced by humans&nbsp;
(e.g., mosquitofish (Gambusia sp.)) or by flooding of permanent waters.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The insect fauna of vernal pools is numerous, varied, and primarily&nbsp;
native, including aquatic beetles (Coleoptera-Dytiscidae,&nbsp;
Hydrophilidae, Gyrinidae, Halipidae, Hydraenidae); aquatic bugs,&nbsp;
including backswimmers (Hemiptera-Notonectidae), water boatmen&nbsp;
(Corixidae), water striders (Gerridae), springtails (Collembola),&nbsp;
mayflies (Ephemeroptera), dragonflies, and damselflies (Odonata); and&nbsp;
various flies with aquatic larvae, including midges (Diptera-
Chironomidae), crane flies (Tipulidae) and mosquitoes (Culicidae).&nbsp;
Rogers (1998) found that mosquitoes made up less than 2 percent of the&nbsp;
total macroscopic invertebrate population in natural and 2-year-old&nbsp;
constructed pools, perhaps because many of the other insects listed&nbsp;
above are predators. Vernal pool crustaceans are an important food&nbsp;
source for a number of aquatic and terrestrial species. Aquatic&nbsp;
predators include insects such as backswimmers (Family Notonectidae)&nbsp;
(Woodward and Kiesecker 1994), predaceous diving beetles and their&nbsp;
larvae (Family Dystictidae), and dragonflies and damselfly larvae&nbsp;
(Order Odonate). Vernal pool tadpole shrimp are another significant&nbsp;
predator of fairy shrimp (Branchinecta spp.).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The plants, invertebrate and vertebrate animals of vernal pools,&nbsp;
and vernal pool landscapes in general are important providers of food&nbsp;
and habitat for waterfowl, shorebirds, wading birds, toads, frogs, and&nbsp;
salamanders (Proctor et al. 1967; Krapu 1974; Swanson 1974; Morin 1987;&nbsp;
Simovich et al. 1991; Silveira 1996). During the spring, waterfowl feed&nbsp;
on vernal pool crustaceans and other invertebrates, which are sources&nbsp;
of protein and calcium needed for migration and egg-laying (Proctor et&nbsp;
al. 1967; Silveira 1998). Vernal pool complexes contribute to&nbsp;
continuity of wetland habitats along the Pacific Flyway (a major bird&nbsp;
migration route). Many species feed or nest near vernal pools; for&nbsp;
example, cliff swallows (Hirundo fulva) glean mud from vernal pool beds&nbsp;
for their nests, lesser nighthawks (Chordeiles acutipennis) nest in dry&nbsp;
vernal pool beds, burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia) and gopher&nbsp;
(Thomomys spp.) burrows are found in mima mounds, and many species&nbsp;
graze or hunt along vernal pool shorelines. Before their populations&nbsp;
were nearly eliminated by hunting and habitat alteration, elk (Cervus&nbsp;
spp.) and pronghorn antelope (Antilocarpa americana) undoubtedly grazed&nbsp;
vernal pool landscapes, and have been replaced by cattle. There is&nbsp;
additionally evidence that Native Americans in California's Central&nbsp;
Valley used vernal pool crustaceans as a food source (Silveira 1998).&nbsp;
Fishing net weights found near vernal pools suggest that California's&nbsp;
first human populations also made use of vernal pool resources, as do&nbsp;
hunters today (Silveira 1998).

Classification of Vernal Pools

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The variability of vernal pool types has led many researchers to&nbsp;
try and classify these ephemeral habitats. (Holland 1986; Sawyer and&nbsp;
Keeler-Wolf 1995; Ferren et al. 1996; Smith and Verrill 1998). Most of&nbsp;
these efforts have focused on classifying vernal pools based on the&nbsp;
factors that influence variation in their physical features. Primary&nbsp;
physical features that influence vernal pool size, depth, and soil and&nbsp;
water chemistry include soil type, geologic formation, and landform.&nbsp;
Landforms are physical attributes of the landscape resulting from&nbsp;
geomorphological processes such as erosion and deposition, and include&nbsp;
features such as alluvial terraces and basins and volcanic mudflows and&nbsp;
lava flows.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The types and kinds of species that are found in vernal pools are&nbsp;
largely

[[Page 46687]]

determined by these physical factors (Holland and Griggs 1976; Zedler&nbsp;
1987; Eng et al. 1990; Holland and Dains 1990; Simovich 1998). The&nbsp;
physical characteristics of the vernal pool influence the life history&nbsp;
characteristics of vernal pool species, such as the speed with which a&nbsp;
species can mature and reproduce, the amount of soil moisture required&nbsp;
for germination of plant seeds or hatching of invertebrate eggs or&nbsp;
cysts, as well as tolerance to turbidity, total dissolved solids, and&nbsp;
other aspects of vernal pool water chemistry.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sawyer and Keeler-Wolf (1995) classified vernal pools according to&nbsp;
a number of physical, geographic, and biological characteristics. They&nbsp;
identified several general vernal pool types , each of which&nbsp;
corresponds to the nature of the impermeable layer that underlies the&nbsp;
particular vernal pool and assisted that pool to form. The vernal pool&nbsp;
types were identified as Northern Hardpan, Northern Claypan, Northern&nbsp;
Basalt Flow, Northern Volcanic Mudflow, and Northern Ashflow vernal&nbsp;
pools. Northern Hardpan vernal pools are formed on alluvial terraces&nbsp;
with silicate-cement soil layers. These pool types are on acidic soils&nbsp;
and exhibit well-developed mima mound topography found on the eastern&nbsp;
margins of the Central Valley. Northern Claypan vernal pools are formed&nbsp;
on impermeable surfaces created by an accumulation of clay particles.&nbsp;
These pool types are often found on basin and basin rim landforms and&nbsp;
tend to occur in the central portion of the Central Valley and tend to&nbsp;
be alkaline. Vernal pools identified as Northern Volcanic Mudflow,&nbsp;
Northern Basalt Flow, and Northern Volcanic Ashflow are formed by an&nbsp;
impervious bedrock layer of volcanic origin. These pool types are found&nbsp;
on the eastern and coastal portions of the Central Valley, and tend to&nbsp;
be small and restricted in distribution. Northern Basalt Flow vernal&nbsp;
pools occur at greater elevations than other vernal pool types.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The vernal pools in Southern California are associated with several&nbsp;
soil series types including but not limited to Huerheuero, Olivenhain,&nbsp;
Placentia, Redding, and Stockpen (Bauder and McMillan 1998). These soil&nbsp;
types and other similar soil series like other vernal pool bearing&nbsp;
soils and geologic formations have a nearly impermeable surface or&nbsp;
subsurface soil layer with a flat or gently sloping topography (Service&nbsp;
1998). Due to local topography and geology, the pools are usually&nbsp;
clustered into pool complexes (Bauder 1986; Holland and Jain 1988).&nbsp;
Pools within a complex are typically separated by distances on the&nbsp;
order of meters, and may form dense, interconnected mosaics of small&nbsp;
pools or a more sparse scattering of larger pools. The pools within the&nbsp;
Santa Rosa Plateau in Riverside County, California are the only known&nbsp;
locality for the Southern Basalt Flow Vernal Pools. Other vernal pools&nbsp;
and pool complexes within the region, such as those at Skunk Hollow are&nbsp;
not currently classified, but some of these pools converge on vernal&nbsp;
lakes and others are associated with vernal alkali plains (Keeler-Wolf&nbsp;
et al. 1998).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The vernal pools in the Agate Desert in Southern Oregon are located&nbsp;
on alluvial fans capped with a shallow layer of clay loam over cemented&nbsp;
hardpan. Other vernal pools within the area include those formed on&nbsp;
older basaltic andesite formations such as those found on Table Rock.&nbsp;
The vernal pool complexes are characterized by patterned ground with&nbsp;
mounds and vernal pools. These pools vary in size from 1 to 30 m (3 to&nbsp;
100 ft) across, and attain a maximum depth of about 30 cm (12 in) (ONHP&nbsp;
1998). This landform is not true desert as it receives 48 cm (19 in) of&nbsp;
precipitation annually. The pools within the area support the vernal&nbsp;
pool fairy shrimp and other listed vernal pool species such as the&nbsp;
endangered Cook's lomatium (Lomatium cookii) and large-flowered woolly&nbsp;
meadowfoam (Limnanthes floccosa ssp. grandiflora) (Service 2002).

Vernal Pool Crustacean Background

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All of the vernal pool crustacean species addressed in this&nbsp;
critical habitat designation have evolved unique physical adaptations&nbsp;
to survive in vernal pools. The timing and duration of wet and dry&nbsp;
phases can vary significantly from year to year, and in some years,&nbsp;
vernal pools may not inundate at all. In order to take advantage of the&nbsp;
short inundation phase, vernal pool crustaceans have evolved short&nbsp;
reproduction times and high reproductive rates. Most of the crustacean&nbsp;
species addressed in this rule hatch within a few days after their&nbsp;
habitats fill with water, and can start reproducing within a few weeks&nbsp;
(Eng et al. 1990; Helm 1998; Eriksen and Belk 1999). Vernal pool&nbsp;
crustaceans can complete their entire life cycle in a single season,&nbsp;
and some species may complete several life cycles. Vernal pool&nbsp;
crustaceans can also produce thousands of viable cysts when&nbsp;
environmental conditions are favorable.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To survive the prolonged heat and dessication of the vernal pool&nbsp;
dry phase, vernal pool crustaceans have developed a dormant stage.&nbsp;
After vernal pool crustacean eggs are fertilized in the female's brood&nbsp;
pouch, the embryos develop a thick, usually multilayered shell. When&nbsp;
embryonic development reaches a late stage, further maturation stops,&nbsp;
metabolism is drastically slowed, and the egg, now referred to as a&nbsp;
cyst, enters a dormant state called diapause. The cyst is then either&nbsp;
dropped to the pool bottom or remains in the brood sac until the female&nbsp;
dies and sinks. Once the cyst is desiccated, it can withstand&nbsp;
temperatures near boiling (Carlisle 1968), fire (Wells et al. 1997),&nbsp;
freezing, and anoxic (deprived of oxygen) conditions without damage to&nbsp;
the embryo. The cyst wall cannot be affected by digestive enzymes, and&nbsp;
can be transported in the digestive tracts of animals without harm&nbsp;
(Horne 1967). Most fairy shrimp cysts can remain viable in the soil for&nbsp;
a decade or longer (Belk 1998).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the exact signals that cause crustacean cysts to hatch are&nbsp;
unknown, factors such as soil moisture, temperature, light, oxygen, and&nbsp;
osmotic pressure may trigger the embryo's emergence from the cyst&nbsp;
(Brendonck 1996). Because the cyst contains a well-developed embryo,&nbsp;
the animal can quickly develop into a fully mature adult. This allows&nbsp;
vernal pool crustaceans to reproduce before the vernal pool enters the&nbsp;
dry phase, sometimes within only a few weeks (Helm 1998; Eriksen and&nbsp;
Belk 1999). In some species (e.g., vernal pool tadpole shrimp), cysts&nbsp;
may hatch immediately without going through a dormant stage, if they&nbsp;
are deposited while the vernal pool still contains water. These cysts&nbsp;
are referred to as quiescent, and their presence allows the vernal pool&nbsp;
crustacean to produce multiple generations in a single wet season as&nbsp;
long as their habitat remains inundated.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another important adaptation of vernal pool crustaceans to the&nbsp;
unpredictable conditions of vernal pools is the fact that not all of&nbsp;
the dormant cysts hatch in every season. Simovich and Hathaway (1997)&nbsp;
found that only 6 percent of San Diego fairy shrimp (Branchinecta&nbsp;
sandiegonensis) cysts hatched after initial hydration, and only 0.18&nbsp;
percent of Riverside fairy shrimp (Streptocephalus woottoni) cysts&nbsp;
hatched. The cysts that do not hatch remain dormant and viable in the&nbsp;
soil. These cysts may hatch in a subsequent year and form a cyst bank&nbsp;
much like the seed bank of annual plants. Based on a review of other&nbsp;
studies (Belk 1977; Gallagher 1996; Brendonck 1996), Simovich and&nbsp;
Hathaway (1997) concluded that species inhabiting more unpredictable&nbsp;
environments, such as smaller or shorter lived pools, are more likely&nbsp;
to have a smaller percent of their

[[Page 46688]]

cysts hatch after their vernal pool habitats fill with water. This&nbsp;
strategy reduces the probability of complete reproductive failure if a&nbsp;
vernal pool dries up prematurely. This strategy has been suggested as a&nbsp;
mechanism by which rare species may persist in unpredictable&nbsp;
environments (Chesson and Warner 1981; Chesson and Huntly 1989; Ellner&nbsp;
and Hairston 1994).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the vernal pool crustaceans, and particularly the fairy&nbsp;
shrimp, addressed in this rule are not often found in the same vernal&nbsp;
pool at the same time, when coexistence does occur, it is generally in&nbsp;
deeper, longer lived pools (Eng et al. 1990; Thiery 1991; Gallagher&nbsp;
1996; Simovich 1998). In larger pools, closely related species of fairy&nbsp;
shrimp may coexist by hatching at different temperatures, and by&nbsp;
developing at different rates (Thiery 1991; Hathaway and Simovich&nbsp;
1996). Vernal pool crustacean species may also be able to coexist by&nbsp;
utilizing different physical portions of the vernal pool, or by eating&nbsp;
different food sources (Daborn 1978; Hamer and Appleton 1991; Mura&nbsp;
1991; Thiery 1991).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The primary historic dispersal mechanisms for the vernal pool&nbsp;
crustaceans probably consisted of large-scale flooding resulting from&nbsp;
winter and spring rains and dispersal by migratory birds. As a result&nbsp;
of widespread flood control and agricultural water diversion projects&nbsp;
developed during the twentieth century, large scale flooding is no&nbsp;
longer a major form of dispersal for the vernal pool crustaceans. When&nbsp;
being dispersed by migratory birds, the eggs of these crustaceans are&nbsp;
either ingested (Krapu 1974; Swanson 1974; Driver 1981; Ahl 1991) and/
or they adhere to the bird's legs and feathers and are thereby&nbsp;
transported to new habitats. Cysts may also be dispersed by a number of&nbsp;
other species, such as salamanders, toads, cattle, and humans (Eriksen&nbsp;
and Belk 1999).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The vernal pool crustaceans addressed in this rule are generally&nbsp;
confined to habitats that are low to moderate in alkalinity and&nbsp;
dissolved salts when compared with other aquatic systems (Eriksen and&nbsp;
Belk 1999). Although potentially moderated by soil type, vernal pools&nbsp;
are generally unbuffered and exhibit wide fluctuations in pH and&nbsp;
dissolved oxygen (Keeley and Zedler 1998). Vernal pool water ion&nbsp;
concentrations, such as sodium, potassium, calcium, chlorine, and&nbsp;
magnesium, also experience large daily and seasonal variations. These&nbsp;
variations are due to the concentration of ions as a result of&nbsp;
evaporation, and the dilution of ions with additional rainfall&nbsp;
throughout the wet season (Barclay and Knight 1981). How vernal pool&nbsp;
crustacean species adapt to these fluctuations in water chemistry&nbsp;
varies. Definitive conclusions on why the species has certain water&nbsp;
chemistry habitat preferences is unknown due to the anecdotal nature of&nbsp;
observations.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This final rule addresses four vernal pool crustaceans: the&nbsp;
Conservancy fairy shrimp (Branchinecta conservatio), longhorn fairy&nbsp;
shrimp (Branchinecta longiantenna), vernal pool fairy shrimp&nbsp;
(Branchinecta lynchi) and the (Lepidurus packardi). Conservancy fairy&nbsp;
shrimp , longhorn fairy shrimp, and vernal pool fairy shrimp are&nbsp;
members of the aquatic crustacean order Anostraca, while the vernal&nbsp;
pool tadpole shrimp is a member of the aquatic crustacean order&nbsp;
Notostraca. Vernal pool fairy shrimp are found in California and&nbsp;
southern Oregon, while the other three shrimp species are found only in&nbsp;
California. These species have all evolved similar adaptations to the&nbsp;
unique habitat conditions of their vernal pool habitats. The general&nbsp;
appearance and life history characteristics of these four species will&nbsp;
be described in combination below.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conservancy fairy shrimp, longhorn fairy shrimp, and vernal pool&nbsp;
fairy shrimp (fairy shrimp) have delicate elongate bodies, large&nbsp;
stalked compound eyes, and 11 pairs of phyllopods, which are swimming&nbsp;
appendages that also function as gills. They swim or glide gracefully&nbsp;
upside down by means of complex beating movements that pass in a&nbsp;
wavelike anterior-to-posterior direction. Fairy shrimp are filter&nbsp;
feeders, and consume algae, bacteria, protozoa, rotifers, and bits of&nbsp;
detritus as they move through the water. The second pair of antennae in&nbsp;
fairy shrimp adult males are greatly enlarged and specialized for&nbsp;
clasping the females during copulation. The females carry eggs in an&nbsp;
oval or elongate ventral sac (brood pouch). Once fertilized, the eggs&nbsp;
are coated (encysted) with a protective protein layer that allows them&nbsp;
to withstand heat, cold, and prolonged dehydration. These dormant&nbsp;
embryos are known as cysts. The cysts are either dropped to the pool&nbsp;
bottom or remain in the brood pouch until the female dies and sinks.&nbsp;
The cysts can remain viable in the soil for decades after deposition&nbsp;
(Eriksen and Belk 1999). When the pools refill in the same or&nbsp;
subsequent seasons, some but not all of the cysts may hatch (Eriksen&nbsp;
and Belk 1999). The cyst bank in the soil may consist of cysts from&nbsp;
several years of breeding. The cysts that hatch may do so within days&nbsp;
after the vernal pools fill, and the hatchlings rapidly develop into&nbsp;
adults within weeks. In pools that persist for several weeks to a few&nbsp;
months, fairy shrimp may have multiple hatches during a single season.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vernal pool tadpole shrimp have dorsal compound eyes, a large&nbsp;
shieldlike carapace (shell) that covers most of their body, and a pair&nbsp;
of long cercopods or appendages at the end of the last abdominal&nbsp;
segment. They are primarily benthic (living on the bottoms of the&nbsp;
pools) animals that swim with their legs down. Vernal pool tadpole&nbsp;
shrimp climb or scramble over objects, and plow along bottom sediments&nbsp;
as they forage for food. Their diet consists of organic detritus and&nbsp;
living organisms, such as fairy shrimp and other invertebrates (Fryer&nbsp;
1987). The females disperse their fully developed cysts into the pool,&nbsp;
where the cysts are then deposited into the sediment. Like fairy&nbsp;
shrimp, vernal pool tadpole shrimp pass the summer months as dormant&nbsp;
cysts in the soil. Some of the cysts hatch as the vernal pools are&nbsp;
filled with rainwater in the next or subsequent seasons, while other&nbsp;
cysts may remain dormant in the soil for many years. When winter rains&nbsp;
refill inhabited pools, tadpole shrimp reestablish from dormant cysts&nbsp;
and may become sexually mature within 3 to 4 weeks after hatching (Ahl&nbsp;
1991; Helm 1998). Mature adults may be present in pools until the&nbsp;
habitats dry up in the spring (Ahl 1991; Gallagher 1996).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Additional information specific to each of the four individual&nbsp;
vernal pool crustacean species described in this rule is provided&nbsp;
below.

Conservancy Fairy Shrimp

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conservancy fairy shrimp were first described in 1990 by Eng, Belk,&nbsp;
and Eriksen. The type specimens were collected in 1982 at Olcott Lake,&nbsp;
Solano County, California. Conservancy fairy shrimp are currently known&nbsp;
from only eight disjunct areas: Vina Plains and vicinity in southern&nbsp;
Tehama and northern Butte County, Jepson Prairie in Solano County,&nbsp;
Suisun Slough in southern Solano County, Sacramento National Wildlife&nbsp;
Refuge in Glenn County, near Caswell Memorial State Park in Stanislaus&nbsp;
County; Haystack Mountain Area in eastern Merced County, San Luis&nbsp;
National Wildlife Refuge Complex in central Merced County, and the&nbsp;
Mutau Flat area in the Los Padres National Forest area of northern&nbsp;
Ventura County. Conservancy fairy shrimp are known from 18 occurrences&nbsp;
(California Natural Diversity Database (CNDDB) 2002).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conservancy fairy shrimp look similar to other fairy shrimp&nbsp;
species, but can be distinguished by characteristics of the male second&nbsp;
antenna. The second antennae of Conservancy fairy shrimp

[[Page 46689]]

males have a distal segment which is about 30 percent shorter than the&nbsp;
basal segment, and has a tip bent medially about 90 degrees (Eng et al.&nbsp;
1990). The female brood pouch is tapered at each end, typically extends&nbsp;
to abdominal segment 8, and has a terminal opening (Eng et al. 1990).&nbsp;
Males may be from 0.6 to 1.0 in (14 to 27 millimeters (mm)) in length,&nbsp;
and females have been measured between 0.6 and 1.0 in (14.5 and 23 mm)&nbsp;
long.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further discussion on the life history and habitat requirements of&nbsp;
Conservancy fairy shrimp can be found in the final rule to list this&nbsp;
species (59 FR 48136).

Longhorn Fairy Shrimp

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Longhorn fairy shrimp were first collected in 1937, but were not&nbsp;
formally described until 1990 by Eng, Belk, and Eriksen. The type&nbsp;
specimen was collected from a sandstone outcrop pool on the Souza Ranch&nbsp;
in Contra Costa County, California. Longhorn fairy shrimp are extremely&nbsp;
rare, and are only known from three widely separated locations: the&nbsp;
Altamont Pass area in Contra Costa and Alameda Counties, the western&nbsp;
and northern boundaries of Soda Lake on the Carrizo Plain in San Luis&nbsp;
Obispo County, and Kesterson National Wildlife Refuge in the San&nbsp;
Joaquin Valley in Merced County. Vernal pool crustacean surveys&nbsp;
conducted by Sugnet (1993) found only 3 occurrences of longhorn fairy&nbsp;
shrimp out of 3,092 locations surveyed, and Helm (1998) found&nbsp;
occurrences of longhorn fairy shrimp in only 9 of 4,008 wetlands&nbsp;
sampled.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Longhorn fairy shrimp are distinguished from other fairy shrimp by&nbsp;
the male's very long second antenna, which is about twice as long,&nbsp;
relative to its body, as the second antenna of other species of&nbsp;
Branchinecta. Longhorn fairy shrimp antennae range from 0.3 to 0.4 in&nbsp;
(6.7 to 10.4 mm) in length (Eriksen and Belk 1999). Females can be&nbsp;
recognized by their cylindrical brood pouch, which extends to below&nbsp;
abdominal segments 6 or 7. Mature males have been measured between 0.5&nbsp;
to 0.8 in (12 and 21 mm) in length, and females range from 0.5 to 0.8&nbsp;
in (13.3 to 19.8 mm) in length (Eng et al. 1990).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further discussion of the life history and habitat requirements of&nbsp;
longhorn fairy shrimp can be found in the final rule to list this&nbsp;
species (59 FR 48136).

Vernal Pool Fairy Shrimp

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vernal pool fairy shrimp were first described by Eng et al. in 1990&nbsp;
from a type specimen that was collected in 1982 at Souza Ranch, Contra&nbsp;
Costa County, California. The species occurs in disjunct fragmented&nbsp;
habitats distributed across the Central Valley of California from&nbsp;
Shasta County to Tulare County and the central and southern coast&nbsp;
ranges from northern Solano County to Ventura County, California.&nbsp;
Additional disjunct occurrences have been identified in southern&nbsp;
California and in Oregon. In Oregon, the species' distribution is&nbsp;
limited to the vicinity of an approximately 32 square mile (mi2) 82.9&nbsp;
square kilometer (km2)) area known as the Agate Desert in Jackson&nbsp;
County, north of Medford. In southern California, the distribution is&nbsp;
equally limited, with populations occurring in three areas in Riverside&nbsp;
County.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vernal pool fairy shrimp are characterized by the presence and size&nbsp;
of several bulges on the male's antenna, and by the female's short,&nbsp;
pyriform or pear shaped brood pouch. Vernal pool fairy shrimp vary in&nbsp;
size, ranging from 0.4 to 1.0 in (11 to 25 mm) in length (Eng et al.&nbsp;
1990).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vernal pool fairy shrimp are currently found in 27 counties across&nbsp;
the Central Valley and coast ranges of California, inland valleys of&nbsp;
southern California, and southern Oregon. Although vernal pool fairy&nbsp;
shrimp are distributed more widely than most other fairy shrimp&nbsp;
species, they are generally uncommon throughout their range and rarely&nbsp;
abundant where they do occur (Eng et al. 1990; Eriksen and Belk 1999).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further discussion of the life history and habitat requirements of&nbsp;
vernal pool fairy shrimp can be found in the final rule to list this&nbsp;
species (59 FR 48136).

Vernal Pool Tadpole Shrimp

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vernal pool tadpole shrimp were initially described by Simon in&nbsp;
1886 and named Lepidurus packardi. After subsequent reclassification by&nbsp;
Longhurst (1955), the species was given a subspecies status based&nbsp;
primarily on the lack of apparent geographic boundaries between L. apus&nbsp;
and L. packardi populations. Lynch (1972) resurrected L. packardi to&nbsp;
full species status based on further examination of specimens, and this&nbsp;
is the currently accepted taxonomic status of vernal pool tadpole&nbsp;
shrimp. Vernal pool tadpole shrimp inhabit sites in California's&nbsp;
Central Valley and San Francisco Bay area. The geographic range of this&nbsp;
species includes disjunct occurrences found in the Central Valley from&nbsp;
Shasta County to northern Tulare County, and in the central coast range&nbsp;
from Solano County to Alameda County. Vernal pool tadpole shrimp are&nbsp;
known from 160 occurrences (CNDDB 2001).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vernal pool tadpole shrimp are distinguished by a large, shieldlike&nbsp;
carapace, or shell, that covers the anterior half of their body. Vernal&nbsp;
pool tadpole shrimp have 30 to 35 pairs of phyllopods, a segmented&nbsp;
abdomen, paired cercopods or tail-like appendages, and fused eyes.&nbsp;
Vernal pool tadpole shrimp will continue to grow as long as their&nbsp;
vernal pool habitats remain inundated, in some cases for 6 months or&nbsp;
longer. They periodically shed their shells, which can often be found&nbsp;
along the edges of vernal pools where vernal pool tadpole shrimp occur.&nbsp;
Mature vernal pool tadpole shrimp range in size from 0.6 to 3.4 in (15&nbsp;
to 86 mm) in length.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vernal pool tadpole shrimp have relatively high reproductive rates.&nbsp;
Ahl (1991) found that fecundity increases with body size. A large&nbsp;
female greater than 0.8 in (20 mm) in carapace length could deposit as&nbsp;
many as 6 clutches, averaging 32 to 61 eggs per clutch, in a single wet&nbsp;
season.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further discussion of the life history and habitat requirements of&nbsp;
vernal pool tadpole shrimp can be found in the final rule to list this&nbsp;
species (59 FR 48136).

Vernal Pool Plants Background

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 11 vernal pool plants described in this rule have developed a&nbsp;
suite of highly specialized adaptations that allow them to survive in&nbsp;
vernal pool habitats. All 11 species are annuals, meaning they&nbsp;
germinate, grow, reproduce, and die within a single year. This allows&nbsp;
the vernal pool plants to complete their life cycles during the&nbsp;
relatively short inundation and drying periods of their vernal pool&nbsp;
habitat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another adaptation of vernal pool plants is production of dormant&nbsp;
seeds. This adaptation allows vernal pool plants to survive the hot&nbsp;
summer months in the soil. The seeds may remain viable in the soil for&nbsp;
many years. The number of plants present above ground may fluctuate&nbsp;
dramatically from year to year. However, much of the population of&nbsp;
these species exists as seeds in the soil. Vernal pool plant seeds&nbsp;
germinate after winter rains in response to a complex set of&nbsp;
environmental cues that are not well understood, but generally include&nbsp;
various temperature and soil moisture. Not all of the dormant seeds&nbsp;
will germinate in any given year. This strategy reduces the probability&nbsp;
of local extirpation if environmental conditions change--for example,&nbsp;
if a vernal pool dries up prematurely. It has also been suggested the&nbsp;
strategy acts as a mechanism by which rare species may persist in&nbsp;
unpredictable environments (Chesson and Warner 1981; Chesson and Huntly&nbsp;
1989; Ellner and Hairston 1994).

[[Page 46690]]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tolerance to inundation differs greatly among species (Zedler&nbsp;
1987). Vernal pool plant zonation, in which characteristic rings of&nbsp;
flowers form around vernal pools, is a result of this differential&nbsp;
tolerance to inundation. Species that are the least tolerant to&nbsp;
inundation grow along the margins of the pools, while those that can&nbsp;
tolerate extended periods of inundation grow in the center of the&nbsp;
pools.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information for the vernal pool plants can be found in the final&nbsp;
rules to list these species (62 FR 34029; 62 FR 14338; 57 FR 24192; 43&nbsp;
FR 44810) and in the criteria section of this rule. Additional&nbsp;
information specific to each of the 11 individual vernal pool plant&nbsp;
species described in this rule is provided below.
Limnanthes floccosa ssp. californica
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Limnanthes floccosa ssp. californica (Butte County meadowfoam) was&nbsp;
first collected in 1917 at a site 10 miles (mi) (16 kilometers (km))&nbsp;
north of Chico (Service 1991b), although it was recognized as a&nbsp;
separate subspecies at that time. Kalin-Arroyo (1973) determined that&nbsp;
it was a distinct taxon and gave it the scientific name Limnanthes&nbsp;
floccosa ssp. californica. The type locality is in Butte County between&nbsp;
Chico and Oroville, near the intersection of State Highway 99 and&nbsp;
Shippee Road (Kalin-Arroyo 1973).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Limnanthes floccosa ssp. californica is a small annual of the&nbsp;
meadowfoam or false mermaid family (Limnanthaceae). It has erect stems&nbsp;
less than 10 in (25 cm) tall. The stem and leaves are densely pubescent&nbsp;
(covered with short hairs). The alternate leaves are pinnately compound&nbsp;
(divided into distinct segments which are arranged featherlike on&nbsp;
either side of a rachis), up to 3 in (8 cm) long, and consist of 5 to&nbsp;
11 leaflets on a long petiole. A single flower arises in the axil&nbsp;
(angle between the base of a leaf and the stem) of each upper leaf. The&nbsp;
flowers are white with yellow veins, cup or bowl-shaped, and consist of&nbsp;
5 petals, 5 sepals, 5 pistils (female reproductive structures of a&nbsp;
flower), and 10 stamens (male reproductive structures of a flower) on a&nbsp;
long flower stalk (Kalin-Arroyo 1973; McNeill and Brown 1979; Ornduff&nbsp;
1993b).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Limnanthes floccosa ssp. californica has always been confined to&nbsp;
small widely scattered occurrences in northwestern Butte County&nbsp;
(Keeler-Wolf et al. 1998). In her original description, Kalin-Arroyo&nbsp;
(1973) mentioned six collections, including the type locality. Five of&nbsp;
those were in the areas ranging from the original collection site&nbsp;
southeast to Oroville, and the sixth was from Table Mountain north of&nbsp;
Oroville. However, James Jokerst (1983) did not find L. f. ssp.&nbsp;
californica on Table Mountain and later suggested that the specimen had&nbsp;
been misidentified (Service 1992a).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All 13 of the occurrences described by the California Natural&nbsp;
Diversity Database (CNDDB) (2002) had been reported by 1988 (Kalin-
Arroyo 1973; McNeill and Brown 1979; Dole 1988; Jokerst 1989). Five&nbsp;
were in northern and northeastern Chico near the municipal airport,&nbsp;
four (including the type locality) were from the area around Shippee&nbsp;
(northwest of Oroville), and three were from southeastern Chico. The&nbsp;
other occurrence, northeast of the town of Nord, contained only one&nbsp;
plant that was of questionable identity (CNDDB 2002). However, the area&nbsp;
indicated would be in the same vicinity as the 1917 collection.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two occurrences of Limnanthes floccosa ssp. californica have been&nbsp;
extirpated, one each in northern and southeastern Chico (Jokerst 1989;&nbsp;
Dole and Sun 1992; Service 1992a; CNDDB 2002). Some of the other 11&nbsp;
extant occurrences have been reduced in distribution (CNDDB 2002).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Limnanthes floccosa ssp. californica normally is found in three&nbsp;
types of seasonal wetland habitats: ephemeral drainages (swales),&nbsp;
vernal pool depressions in swales, and occasionally around edges of&nbsp;
isolated vernal pools (Jokerst 1989). The swales and vernal pools where&nbsp;
L. f. ssp. californica grows are on intermediate fan terraces (Kelley&nbsp;
and Associates Environmental Sciences 1992) in annual grasslands with&nbsp;
mima mound topography. Large cobbles are present throughout the pools&nbsp;
and swales (Jokerst 1989). These pools are associated with Tuscan,&nbsp;
Redbluff, Riverbank, and Modesto geologic formations, and most of them&nbsp;
occur on soils of the Tuscan-Anita and the Redding-Igo complexes. Anita&nbsp;
and Igo soils are confined to the pools and swales. Tuscan and Redding&nbsp;
soils are restricted to the mounds. The two soils are underlain by&nbsp;
iron-silica cemented and indurated (hardened) hardpan, respectively&nbsp;
(Kelley and Associates Environmental Sciences 1993). Limnanthes&nbsp;
floccosa ssp. californica has been observed on Anita clay soils&nbsp;
annually regardless of rainfall but appears on Igo soils only in years&nbsp;
of above-average rainfall (Kelley and Associates Environmental Sciences&nbsp;
1992a; Crompton 1993; Schonholtz in litt. 1995), presumably because the&nbsp;
former can hold approximately twice as much moisture (Kelley and&nbsp;
Associates Environmental Sciences 1993). Confirmed occurrences have&nbsp;
been found at 165 to 300 ft (50 to 90 m) in elevation (McNeill and&nbsp;
Brown 1979; CNDDB 2002). The habitat associated with L. f. ssp.&nbsp;
californica includes saturated soils and pools with a short lived&nbsp;
inundation period.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further discussion of the life history and habitat characteristics&nbsp;
of Limnanthes floccosa ssp. californica can be found in the final rule&nbsp;
to list the species (62 FR 54807).

Lasthenia conjugens

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edward Greene (1888) first described this species as Lasthenia&nbsp;
conjugens (Contra Costa goldfields), from specimens collected near&nbsp;
Antioch, California. Harvey Hall (1914) later lumped it in with Baeria&nbsp;
fremontii (Fremont's goldfields). Roxana Ferris (1958) proposed the&nbsp;
name Baeria fremontii var. conjugens to recognize the distinctiveness&nbsp;
of L. conjugens. Finally, Robert Ornduff (1966) restored Greene's&nbsp;
original name and rank, returning this species to the genus Lasthenia.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lasthenia conjugens is a showy spring annual in the aster family&nbsp;
(Asteraceae). Its stems are 4 to 12 in (10 to 30 cm) tall, somewhat&nbsp;
fleshy, and usually are branched. The leaves are opposite and narrow;&nbsp;
the lower leaves are entire, but stem leaves have one or two pairs of&nbsp;
narrow lobes. The daisylike flower heads are solitary (Greene 1888;&nbsp;
Ornduff 1993a).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Twenty extant occurrences of Lasthenia conjugens are found widely&nbsp;
scattered in small vernal pool areas in Alameda, Contra Costa,&nbsp;
Mendocino, Monterey, Napa, and Solano Counties. Of these 20&nbsp;
occurrences, Solano County has 11 small scattered occurrences in a&nbsp;
general area east and south of the City of Fairfield. The Santa Barbara&nbsp;
County and Santa Clara County occurrences of L. conjugens have probably&nbsp;
been lost due to habitat alteration (CNDDB 2002). One Napa County site,&nbsp;
Milliken Canyon, contained only a single plant in 1987 whether this&nbsp;
individual is still in existence is unknown (CNDDB 2002).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lasthenia conjugens typically grows in vernal pools, swales, moist&nbsp;
flats, and depressions within a grassland matrix (CNDDB 2002). However,&nbsp;
several historical collections were from populations growing in the&nbsp;
saline-alkaline transition zone between vernal pools and tidal marshes&nbsp;
on the eastern margin of the San Francisco Bay (Baye, Service, in litt.&nbsp;
2000a). The herbarium sheet for one of the San Francisco Bay specimens&nbsp;
notes that the species also grew in evaporating ponds used to&nbsp;
concentrate salt (Baye, in litt. 2000b). The vernal pool types from&nbsp;
which this species has been reported are Northern Basalt Flow, Northern&nbsp;
Claypan, and Northern Volcanic Ashflow (Sawyer and Keeler-Wolf 1995).&nbsp;
The landforms and

[[Page 46691]]

geologic formations for sites where L. conjugens occurs have not yet&nbsp;
been determined. Most occurrences are found at elevations of 6 to 200&nbsp;
ft (2 to 61 m), but the recently discovered Monterey County occurrences&nbsp;
are at 400 ft (122 m), and one Napa County occurrence is at 1,460 ft&nbsp;
(445 m) elevation (CNDDB 2002).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The soil types that maintain vernal pool habitats for Lasthenia&nbsp;
conjugens have not yet been identified for most localities. The soil&nbsp;
series from which this species is known are Aiken, Antioch, Concepcion,&nbsp;
Conejo, Crispin, Haire, Linne, Los Robles, Rincon, Solano, and San&nbsp;
Ysidro, plus the Arnold-Santa Ynez, Hambright-rock outcrop, and Los&nbsp;
Osos complexes. Soil textures, where known, are clays or loams. At&nbsp;
least in Solano County and on the shores of San Francisco Bay, L.&nbsp;
conjugens grows in alkaline or saline-alkaline sites (Baye, in litt.&nbsp;
2000a, 2000b; CNDDB 2002).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further discussion on the life history and habitat characteristics&nbsp;
of Lasthenia conjugens can be found in the final rule to list the&nbsp;
species (62 FR 33029; June 18, 1997).

Chamaesyce hooveri

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chamaesyce hooveri (Hoover's spurge) was originally named Euphorbia&nbsp;
hooveri based on a specimen collected by Robert Hoover in Yettem,&nbsp;
Tulare County (Wheeler 1940). Koutnik (1985) placed the species in the&nbsp;
genus Chamaesyce as C. hooveri.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chamaesyce hooveri is an annual herb of the spurge family&nbsp;
(Euphorbiaceae). The species trails along the ground, forming gray-
green mats 2 to 40 in (5 to 100 cm) in diameter (Broyles 1987, Stone et&nbsp;
al. 1988). The stems are hairless and contain milky sap. The tiny (0.08&nbsp;
to 0.20 in (2 to 5 mm)) leaves are opposite, rounded to kidney-shaped,&nbsp;
with an asymmetric base and a toothed margin. In the genus Chamaesyce,&nbsp;
the structures that appear to be flowers actually are groups of&nbsp;
flowers; each group is referred to as a cyathium (Koutnik 1993).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CNDDB (2002) includes 30 occurrences of Chamaesyce hooveri. Of&nbsp;
these, one each in Tehama and Tulare Counties are classified as&nbsp;
extirpated; two others, in Butte and Tehama Counties, may no longer&nbsp;
occur because this species was not observed for 2 consecutive years&nbsp;
(Stone et al. 1988; CNDDB 2002). The Vina Plains of Tehama and Butte&nbsp;
Counties contain 14 (54 percent) of the 26 extant occurrences of C.&nbsp;
hooveri (CNDDB 2002) in an area approximately 35 mi \2\ (91 km \2\) in&nbsp;
size (Stone et al. 1988). One other site in the same region is near&nbsp;
Chico in Butte County. Seven of the 26 extant occurrences are in the&nbsp;
Southern Sierra Foothills Vernal Pool Region, including 5 in the&nbsp;
Visalia-Yettem area of Tulare County and 2 in the Hickman-La Grange&nbsp;
area of Stanislaus County. Three other occurrences are on the&nbsp;
Sacramento National Wildlife Refuge in Glenn County, which is in the&nbsp;
Solano-Colusa Vernal Pool Region. The one other extant occurrence is on&nbsp;
the Bert Crane Ranch in Merced County, which is within the San Joaquin&nbsp;
Valley Vernal Pool Region (Keeler-Wolf et al. 1998; CNDDB 2002).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vernal pools from which Chamaesyce hooveri has been reported are&nbsp;
classified as Northern Hardpan and Northern Claypan vernal pools&nbsp;
(Sawyer and Keeler-Wolf 1995). The pools supporting this species vary&nbsp;
in size from 0.47 to 600 ac (0.19 to 243 ha), with a median area of&nbsp;
1.43 ac (0.58 ha) (Stone et al. 1988). Many occurrences consist of&nbsp;
multiple pools that vary in area and depth, yet not all pools at a site&nbsp;
support C. hooveri. Deeper pools apparently provide better habitat for&nbsp;
this species because the duration of inundation is longer. This species&nbsp;
may occur along the margins or in the deepest portions of the dried&nbsp;
pool bed (Stone et al. 1988; Alexander and Schlising 1997). A&nbsp;
particularly important feature of C. hooveri microhabitat, at least in&nbsp;
the deeper pools, is that it is nearly devoid of other vegetation, and&nbsp;
thus competition from other plants is reduced (Stone et al. 1988).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vernal pools supporting Chamaesyce hooveri occur mostly on alluvial&nbsp;
fans or terraces of ancient rivers or streams, with a few on the rim of&nbsp;
the Central Valley basin. It is found on a wide variety of soils,&nbsp;
ranging in texture from clay to sandy loam. Soil series include Anita,&nbsp;
Laniger, Lewis, Madera, Meikle, Riz, Tuscan, Whitney, and Willows. All&nbsp;
of these soils may not equally support the habitat requirements for&nbsp;
this species, however. For example, in one Vina Plains pool, C. hooveri&nbsp;
grew primarily in the portion that was underlain by Tuscan loam, but&nbsp;
were nearly absent from the portion underlain by Anita clay (Alexander&nbsp;
and Schlising 1997).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Sacramento Valley, occupied pools are on acidic soils over&nbsp;
iron-silica cemented hardpan. Most pools supporting Chamaesyce hooveri&nbsp;
in the San Joaquin Valley are on neutral to saline-alkaline soils over&nbsp;
lime-silica cemented hardpan or claypan (Broyles 1987; Stone et al.&nbsp;
1988; Sawyer and Keeler-Wolf 1995; CNDDB 2002). Occurrences have been&nbsp;
reported from elevations ranging from 85 ft (26 m) in Glenn County to&nbsp;
420 ft (128 m) in Tehama County (CNDDB 2002).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further discussion on the life history and habitat characteristics&nbsp;
of Chamaesyce hooveri can be found in the final rule to list the&nbsp;
species (62 FR 14338).

Castilleja campestris ssp. succulenta

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Robert Hoover (1936a) first described this species as Orthocarpus&nbsp;
campestris var. succulentus (fleshy owl's-clover). The type specimen&nbsp;
had been collected at Ryer, in Merced County. Robert Hoover (1968)&nbsp;
subsequently raised its rank and assigned it the name Orthocarpus&nbsp;
succulentus. Chuang and Heckard (1991) reconsidered the taxonomy of&nbsp;
Orthocarpus and related genera. Based on floral morphology (external&nbsp;
structure or form), seed morphology, and chromosome number, they&nbsp;
transferred many species into the genus Castilleja. Furthermore, they&nbsp;
determined that the appropriate rank for this species was as a&nbsp;
subspecies of Castilleja campestris (field owl's-clover) and assigned&nbsp;
the plant the scientific name Castilleja campestris ssp. succulenta&nbsp;
(Chuang and Heckard 1991).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Castilleja campestris ssp. succulenta is a hemiparasitic (partly&nbsp;
parasitic) annual herb belonging to the snapdragon family&nbsp;
(Scrophulariaceae). The plant has erect or decumbent (laying on the&nbsp;
ground with the tip turned upward) stems up to 12 in (30 cm) long. The&nbsp;
stems are usually unbranched and without hairs. The leaves at the base&nbsp;
of the stem are small and scalelike, whereas those on the upper stem&nbsp;
are lance-shaped, not lobed, thick, fleshy, brittle, and easily broken.&nbsp;
The bracts (leaf-like structures in the flowering structure) are green,&nbsp;
similar to but shorter than the upper leaves, and longer than the&nbsp;
flowers. Overall, the inflorescence (entire flowering structure of a&nbsp;
plant) may occupy as much as half of the plant's height (Hoover 1936a,&nbsp;
1937, 1968; Chuang and Heckard 1991, 1993).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Castilleja campestris ssp. succulenta is known from 63 widely&nbsp;
scattered extant occurrences in vernal pool habitats along the Southern&nbsp;
Sierra Foothills Vernal Pool Region ranging from Madera County to a&nbsp;
disjunct occurrence in northern San Joaquin County. Castilleja&nbsp;
campestris ssp. succulenta is known from 11 occurrences in Fresno&nbsp;
County, 9 in Madera, 36 in Merced, 5 in Stanislaus and 1 in Tuolumne&nbsp;
(Keeler-Wolf et al. 1998; CNDDB 2002).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Castilleja campestris ssp. succulenta is known mostly from vernal&nbsp;
pools occurring on alluvial terrace landforms. These pool types have&nbsp;
been described as both Northern Claypan and Northern Hardpan vernal&nbsp;
pools (Sawyer and

[[Page 46692]]

Keeler-Wolf 1995) within annual grassland communities (CNDDB 2002).&nbsp;
However, it is found on Northern Basalt Flow vernal pools on Hideaway&nbsp;
soils series at one location in the San Joaquin Valley. It is known&nbsp;
from both small and large pools (EIP Associates 1999). Although not all&nbsp;
pools occupied by this taxon have been studied in detail, Stebbins et&nbsp;
al. (1995) collected data on six occupied pools in Fresno and Madera&nbsp;
Counties. Some were typical ``bowl-like'' pools, whereas others were&nbsp;
more similar to swales. This subspecies has been reported from pools&nbsp;
with both long and short inundation periods (EIP Associates 1999), and&nbsp;
from both shallow and ``abnormally deep vernal pools,'' but approximate&nbsp;
depth of these pools was not given (CNDDB 2002).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soil series supporting Castilleja campestris ssp. succulenta&nbsp;
include Amador, Anderson, Corning, Fallbrook, Keyes, Pentz, Ramona,&nbsp;
Redding, San Joaquin, Vista, and Yokohl, as well as the Pollasky-
Montpellier complex. Soil textures at those sites range from extremely&nbsp;
stony loam to loamy clay. In the proposed University of California-
Merced campus and community area, the species is found primarily on&nbsp;
Redding gravelly loam; however, Corning, Keyes, and Pentz soils also&nbsp;
contain occurrences of the species (EIP Associates 1999). Occurrences&nbsp;
of C. c. ssp. succulenta have been reported from elevations of 80 ft&nbsp;
(24 m) at the San Joaquin County site to 2,300 ft (700 m) at Kennedy&nbsp;
Table in Madera County (CNDDB 2002). We are uncertain about specific&nbsp;
soils that may correlate with the presence of this species, although it&nbsp;
is irregularly found on Redding soil series. Vernal pool complexes that&nbsp;
provide habitat for this species include pools ranging in depth from 6&nbsp;
in (15 cm) to 10 in (25 cm), but the species is also found less&nbsp;
frequently in shallower and deeper pools. Soil pH values for some of&nbsp;
the vernal pools in Merced County occupied by C. c. ssp. succulenta&nbsp;
range from 4.3 to 6.2. Although no comprehensive study has been&nbsp;
conducted, some vernal pools occupied by C. c. ssp. succulenta vary in&nbsp;
size from 0.02 ac (81 m<sup>2</sup>) to 0.12 ac (486 m<sup>2</sup>) in&nbsp;
Merced County. Merced County contains the largest aggregations of C. c.&nbsp;
ssp. succulenta: occurrences are found on mild to strongly acidic soils&nbsp;
on Laguna, Mehrten, North Merced Gravels, and Riverbank Formations, as&nbsp;
well as on Ione, Mehrten, and Valley Springs geological formations. The&nbsp;
parent material of vernal pools greatly influences species composition&nbsp;
and hydrologic functioning of the vernal pool (Holland and Jain 1981,&nbsp;
1988; Hanes and Stromberg 1998). Castilleja campestris ssp. succulenta&nbsp;
appears to prefer the more-weathered acidic, higher-terrace vernal pool&nbsp;
complexes that are composed of volcanic tuff sand quartzite parent&nbsp;
materials.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further discussion on the life history and habitat characteristics&nbsp;

of Castilleja campestris ssp. succulenta can be found in the final rule&nbsp;
to list the species (62 FR 14338).

Orcuttieae Tribe

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Neostapfia colusana (Colusa grass), Orcuttua pilosa (hairy Orcutt&nbsp;
grass), Tuctoria mucronata (Solano grass), Tuctoria greenei (Greene's&nbsp;
tuctoria), Orcuttia viscida (Sacramento Valley Orcutt grass), Orcuttia&nbsp;
inaequalis (San Joaquin Valley Orcutt grass), and Orcuttia tenuis&nbsp;
(slender Orcutt grass) belong to the tribe Orcuttieae in Poaceae, the&nbsp;
grass family, (Reeder 1965). Many life history characteristics are&nbsp;
common to all members of the Orcuttieae. All are wind pollinated, but&nbsp;
pollen may not be carried long distances between occurrences (Griggs&nbsp;
1980,1981; Griggs and Jain 1983). Local seed dispersal is by water,&nbsp;
which breaks up the inflorescence (Reeder 1965; Crampton 1976; Griggs&nbsp;
1980, 1981). Long-distance dispersal is unlikely (Service 1985c), but&nbsp;
seed may have been carried occasionally by waterfowl (family Anatidae),&nbsp;
tule elk (Cervus elaphus nannoides), or pronghorn (Antilocapra&nbsp;
americana) in historical times (Griggs 1980). The seeds can remain&nbsp;
dormant for an undetermined length of time, but at least for 3 or 4&nbsp;
years, and germinate underwater after they have been immersed for&nbsp;
prolonged periods (Crampton 1976; Griggs 1980; Keeley 1998a). Unlike&nbsp;
typical terrestrial grasses that grow in the uplands surrounding vernal&nbsp;
pools, members of the Orcuttieae flower during the summer months&nbsp;
(Keeley 1998a).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members of the Orcuttieae tribe share a suite of characteristics&nbsp;
that separate the genera within the tribe from all other grasses and&nbsp;
have no close terrestrial relative tribes. The semi-aquatic annual&nbsp;
plants in this distinct group contain glands that produce a viscid&nbsp;
aromatic exudate (sticky aromatic substance) exhibit no distinction&nbsp;
between the leaf blade and blade sheath, lack leaf ligules (small&nbsp;
membranous appendages at the base of a leaf), and possess small sunken&nbsp;
mushroom-shaped bicellular microhairs. These seasonally submerged&nbsp;
species germinate and grow as submerged aquatic plants for several&nbsp;
weeks to 3 months. With the exceptions of Tuctoria and the variable&nbsp;
aquatic and terrestrial leaves of Neostapfia, Orcuttia species produce&nbsp;
floating aquatic juvenile leaves that lack stomata (openings for gas&nbsp;
exchange). These partly amphibious Orcuttia species within this tribe&nbsp;
replace their juvenile leaves with terrestrial leaves as the vernal&nbsp;
pools dry out.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All members of the Orcuttieae tribe have large soil seed banks that&nbsp;
may be 50 times (or more) larger in numbers than the aboveground&nbsp;
population in any given year. In general, years of above-average&nbsp;
rainfall promote larger expressions of occurrences of Orcuttieae, but&nbsp;
occurrence responses vary by pool and by species (Griggs 1980; Griggs&nbsp;
and Jain 1983). Population sizes have been observed to vary by one to&nbsp;
four orders of magnitude among successive years and return to previous&nbsp;
levels even after 3 to 5 consecutive years when no mature plants were&nbsp;
present (Griggs 1980; Griggs and Jain 1983; Holland 1987). Thus, many&nbsp;
years of observation are necessary to determine whether any occurrence&nbsp;
of a species is increasing, stable, or declining.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eight members of the Orcuttieae tribe are endemic and restricted to&nbsp;
vernal pools in California. The Orcuttieae tribe contains the three&nbsp;
genera Neostapfia, Orcuttia, and Tuctoria. The genus Neostapfia&nbsp;
contains one species, Neostapfia colusana. The genus Orcuttia has five&nbsp;
species and Tuctoria has two species. Although the various species&nbsp;
within the tribe have been found in vernal pools ranging widely in&nbsp;
size, the vast majority are found within vernal pools of 0.03 ac (0.01&nbsp;
ha) to 24.7 ac (10 ha) (Stone et al. 1988). Larger vernal pools retain&nbsp;
water until May or June, creating optimal conditions for Orcuttieae&nbsp;
(Crampton 1959; Crampton 1976; Griggs 1981; Griggs and Jain 1983).&nbsp;
Orcuttieae usually occur in patches within the pools that are&nbsp;
essentially devoid of other plant species (Crampton 1959, 1976).&nbsp;
Typically, these plants near the center of a vernal pool grow larger&nbsp;
and produce more spikelets than those near the margins, but patterns&nbsp;
vary depending on individual pool characteristics and seasonal weather&nbsp;
conditions (Griggs 1980).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A discussion of each of the seven Orcuttieae species in this rule&nbsp;
is provided below. The number of subject extant occurrences of the 3&nbsp;
genera within the tribe total 219, and an additional 80 occurrences&nbsp;
have been extirpated or are considered possibly extirpated by intensive&nbsp;
agriculture, land use conversions, urban development, and other factors&nbsp;
(CNDDB 2002).

Neostapfia colusana

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Joseph Burtt-Davy (1898) first described Neostapfia colusana&nbsp;
(Colusa grass) and gave the Latin name Stapfia

[[Page 46693]]

colusana. He collected the type specimen near the town of Princeton in&nbsp;
Colusa County, but soon realized that the name Stapfia had already been&nbsp;
assigned to a genus of green algae, and thus changed the scientific&nbsp;
name to Neostapfia colusana (Davy 1899). Two other taxonomists proposed&nbsp;
alternate Latin names for the genus in the same year, but neither is&nbsp;
accepted today. There are no other known species of Neostapfia (Reeder&nbsp;
1982, 1993).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, CNDDB (2002) considers 41 occurrences of Neostapfia&nbsp;
colusana to be extant and 19 other occurrences to no longer exist or to&nbsp;
be possibly extirpated. Of the 41 extant occurrences, 23 occurrences of&nbsp;
N. colusana are found in Merced County and 14 occurrences exist east of&nbsp;
Hickman in Stanislaus County. Two occurrences each are found in&nbsp;
southeastern Yolo County in central Solano County (Stone et al. 1988;&nbsp;
Keeler-Wolf et al. 1998; CNDDB 2002). This species has been extirpated&nbsp;
from Colusa and Glenn Counties (CNDDB 2002).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Neostapfia colusana occurs on the rim of alkaline basins in the&nbsp;
Sacramento and San Joaquin Valleys, as well as on acidic soils of&nbsp;
alluvial fans and stream terraces along the eastern margin of the San&nbsp;
Joaquin Valley and into the adjacent foothills (Stone et al. 1988).&nbsp;
Neostapfia colusana has been found in Northern Claypan and Northern&nbsp;
Hardpan vernal pool types (Sawyer and Keeler-Wolf 1995) within rolling&nbsp;
grasslands (Crampton 1959). This species typically grows in the deepest&nbsp;
portion of the pool (Crampton 1959), but may also occur on the margins&nbsp;
(Hoover 1937; Stone et al. 1988). Deeper pools are most likely to&nbsp;
provide the long inundation period required for germination (EIP&nbsp;
Associates 1999). It appears to favor somewhat larger vernal pools that&nbsp;
are shallower as compared to other vernal pool plants. Neostapfia&nbsp;
colusana occurrences vary in elevation from near 16 ft (5 m) to near&nbsp;
350 ft (100 m).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vernal pool complexes that provide habitat for this species include&nbsp;
two different physiographic and edaphic settings: (1) claypan soils of&nbsp;
saline-alkali basins and remnant alluvial fans and (2) old stream&nbsp;
terrace areas with strongly acidic, gravelly, and cobbly soils having&nbsp;
an iron-silica cemented hardpan and shallow, slightly acidic residual&nbsp;
soils of the Pentz series underlain by cemented tuffaceous alluvium.&nbsp;
Additional settings for Neostapfia colusana are found in vernal pool&nbsp;
complexes where resistant beds of tuffaceous deposits are exposed along&nbsp;
intermittent drainages and, in Stanislaus County, neutral-to-slightly-
alkaline claypan soils on dissected alluvial fans. Not all areas of N.&nbsp;
colusana have been identified as to the specific soil series or soil&nbsp;
mapping units where they occur. However, in Merced County, N. colusana&nbsp;
occurs on clay soils on Merhten and Laguna formations and Riverbank,&nbsp;
North Merced gravels. Of the Orcuttieae grasses, N. colusana inhabits&nbsp;
the widest range of vernal pool sizes, with the smallest being 1,075&nbsp;
ft<sup>2</sup> (100 m<sup>2</sup>) and the largest 618 ac (250 ha).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Solano and Yolo County sites where Neostapfia colusana grows&nbsp;
contain vernal pools formed by soils in the Pescadero series, whereas&nbsp;
those in central Merced County are formed by soils in the Landlow and&nbsp;
Lewis series. The eastern Merced County and Stanislaus County sites&nbsp;
include vernal pool habitats formed by the Bear Creek, Corning,&nbsp;
Greenfield, Keyes, Meikle, Pentz, Peters, Raynor, Redding, and Whitney&nbsp;
series (Stone et al. 1988; EIP Associates 1999; CNDDB 2002). The type&nbsp;
and composition of impermeable layers underlying occupied vernal pools&nbsp;
also vary, ranging from claypan in the Sacramento Valley to lime-silica&nbsp;
cemented hardpan in the San Joaquin Valley basins, to iron-silica&nbsp;
cemented hardpan in the eastern margin of the San Joaquin Valley.&nbsp;
Tuffaceous alluvium underlies some eastern San Joaquin Valley pools and&nbsp;
intermittent streams where N. colusana grows (Stone et al. 1988).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further discussion on the life history and habitat characteristics&nbsp;
of Neostapfia colusana can be found in the final rule to list the&nbsp;
species (62 FR 14338).

Tuctoria greenei

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; George Vasey (1891) originally assigned this species the name&nbsp;
Orcuttia greenei. Edward Greene had collected the type specimen in 1890&nbsp;
(Vasey 1891), presumably in Butte County (Hoover 1941; Crampton 1959).&nbsp;
Citing differences in lemma morphology, arrangement of the spikelets,&nbsp;
and other differences, Robert Reeder (1982) segregated the genus&nbsp;
Tuctoria from Orcuttia and created the new scientific name Tuctoria&nbsp;
greenei (Greene's tuctoria).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tuctoria greenei is an erect-to-low-growing annual with fragile&nbsp;
stems that easily break apart at the nodes, which are often purplish.&nbsp;
The leaves are flat and curve outward and the plants are sparsely&nbsp;
hairy. The inflorescence is crowded near the tip, with the lower&nbsp;
spikelets more or less separated. Optimum germination of T. greenei&nbsp;
seed occurs when the seed is exposed to light and anaerobic (lacking&nbsp;
oxygen) conditions after a cold period of time (stratification) (Keeley&nbsp;
1988). Germination occurs several months after initial inundation&nbsp;
(Keeley 1998a). Tuctoria seedlings do not develop floating juvenile&nbsp;
leaves as does Orcuttia (Griggs 1980; Keeley 1998a). Tuctoria greenei&nbsp;
flowers from May to July (Skinner and Pavlik 1994), with peak flowering&nbsp;
in June and July (Griggs 1981; Broyles 1987).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tuctoria greenei is known from 21 extant widely separated&nbsp;
occurrences in Butte, Merced, Shasta, and Tehama Counties. Sixty&nbsp;
percent of the extant occurrences of T. greenei are in the Vina Plains&nbsp;
area of Tehama and Butte Counties. Eastern Merced County has about 30&nbsp;
percent of the known occurrences. Other occurrences are located in&nbsp;
Glenn (Oswald and Silveira 1995) and Shasta Counties (CNDDB 2002).&nbsp;
Tuctoria greenei has been extirpated from Fresno, Madera, San Joaquin,&nbsp;
Stanislaus, and Tulare Counties (Stone et al. 1988; Skinner and Pavlik&nbsp;
1994; CNDDB 2002).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tuctoria greenei has been found in three types of vernal pools:&nbsp;
Northern Basalt Flow, Northern Claypan, and Northern Hardpan (Stone et&nbsp;
al. 1988; Sawyer and Keeler-Wolf 1995). Occupied pools are (or were)&nbsp;
underlain by iron-silica cemented hardpan, tuffaceous alluvium, or&nbsp;
claypan (Stone et al. 1988). Of pools where the species was known to be&nbsp;
extant in 1987, the median size was 1.5 ac (0.6 ha), with a range of&nbsp;
0.01 ac (50 m\2\) to 8.4 ac (3.4 ha) (Stone et al. 1988). Stone et al.&nbsp;
(1988) noted that T. greenei grew in shallower pools than other members&nbsp;
of the tribe or on the shallow margins of deeper pools, but they did&nbsp;
not quantify pool depth. At the Vina Plains, T. greenei grew in pools&nbsp;
of ``intermediate'' size, which dried in April or early May of 1995&nbsp;
(Alexander and Schlising 1997). The Central Valley pools containing T.&nbsp;
greenei are (or were) in grasslands; the Shasta County occurrence is&nbsp;
surrounded by pine forest (CNDDB 2002). Occupied pools in the Central&nbsp;
Valley are (or were) at elevations of 110 to 440 ft (33.5 to 134 m)&nbsp;
(Stone et al. 1988), whereas the Shasta County occurrence is at 3,500&nbsp;
ft (1,067 m) (CNDDB 2002).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Tehama and Butte Counties, Tuctoria greenei grows mostly on&nbsp;
Anita clay and Tuscan loam soils, with one occurrence on Tuscan stony&nbsp;
clay loam. Soil types are not certain for several other occurrences in&nbsp;
this region; one is on either the Rocklin or the San Joaquin series,&nbsp;
and the others are unknown. On the eastern margin of the San Joaquin&nbsp;
Valley, T. greenei is known to grow on a number of different soil&nbsp;
series, including Archerdale, Bear Creek, Exeter, Meikle, Ramona,&nbsp;
Raynor, Redding, and San Joaquin.

Orcuttia pilosa

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Robert Hoover (1941) described Orcuttia pilosa (hairy Orcutt grass)&nbsp;
from specimens he collected in Stanislaus County in 1937. Orcuttia&nbsp;
pilosa grows in tufts consisting of numerous stems. The stems are&nbsp;
decumbent or erect and branch from only the lower nodes. Almost the&nbsp;
entire plant is pilose or hairy, giving it a grayish appearance. The&nbsp;
spikelets near the tip of the inflorescence are crowded together,&nbsp;
whereas those near the base are more widely spaced.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Orcuttia pilosa is known from 28 extant occurrences at widely&nbsp;
scattered sites in the southern portion of the Sacramento Valley and&nbsp;
the southern Sierra foothills (Keeler-Wolf et al. 1998). In the&nbsp;
Sacramento Valley, Butte County has one occurrence, Glenn County has&nbsp;
six occurrences, and Tehama County has nine occurrences. In the&nbsp;
Southern Sierra Foothills Vernal Pool Region, the remaining 12&nbsp;
occurrences of the species are found in widely scattered locations in&nbsp;
Stanislaus, Madera, and Merced Counties (Hoover 1941; Crampton 1959;&nbsp;
Reeder 1982, Stone et al. 1988; CNDDB 2002). Nineteen of those&nbsp;
occurrences have been confirmed as existing within the past decade&nbsp;
(CNDDB 2002).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This species is found within vernal pools formed on high or low&nbsp;
stream terraces and alluvial fans (Stone et al. 1988). The median size&nbsp;
of occupied pools measured in the late 1980s was 4.2 ac (1.7 ha), with&nbsp;
a range of 0.8 to 617.5 ac (0.34 to 250 ha) (Stone et al. 1988). At the&nbsp;
Vina Plains, Orcuttia pilosa was found growing only in pools that held&nbsp;
water until May, June, or July in 1995, not in those that dried in&nbsp;
April (Alexander and Schlising 1997). This species is known from&nbsp;
elevations of 85 ft (26 m) in Glenn County to 405 ft (123 m) in Madera&nbsp;
County (CNDDB 2002).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Orcuttia pilosa is found on both acidic and saline-alkaline soils,&nbsp;
in pools with an iron-silica cemented hardpan or claypan. In Tehama and&nbsp;
Butte Counties, pools supporting O. pilosa occur on the Anita and&nbsp;
Tuscan soil series (Stone et al. 1988; CNDDB 2002). At one pool in the&nbsp;
Vina Plains that spans both Anita clay and Tuscan loam soils, O. pilosa&nbsp;
was found growing primarily on the Anita clay (Alexander and Schlising&nbsp;
1997). At the Sacramento National Wildlife Refuge, O. pilosa occurs on&nbsp;
the Willows and Riz soil series, whereas in the Southern Sierra&nbsp;
Foothills Vernal Pool Region it occurs on the Cometa, Greenfield,&nbsp;
Hanford, Meikle, and Whitney soil series (Stone et al. 1988).

of Orcuttia pilosa can be found in the final rule to list the species&nbsp;
(62 FR 14338).

Orcuttia viscida

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Robert Hoover (1941) first described Orcuttia viscida (Sacramento&nbsp;
Orcutt grass) as Orcuttia californica var. viscida based on the type&nbsp;
specimen he collected from in Sacramento County. John Reeder (1980)&nbsp;
determined that the differences in morphology, seed size, and&nbsp;
chromosome number were sufficient grounds to elevate it to the species&nbsp;
level as Orcuttia viscida.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Orcuttia viscida grass resembles other members of the tribe and&nbsp;
genus. Although all members of the Orcuttieae produce a sticky exudate,&nbsp;
O. viscida is particularly sticky even when young. The plants are&nbsp;
densely tufted, bluish green, and covered with hairs. The stems are&nbsp;
erect or spreading, 1 to 4 in (3 to 10 cm) long, and do not branch. The&nbsp;
inflorescence occupies the upper one-third to one-half of the stem and&nbsp;
consists of between 5 and 15 spikelets. The spikelets are closely&nbsp;
spaced, and although distichous (arranged in two opposing rows), they&nbsp;
are oriented towards one side of the stem.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Orcuttia viscida is endemic to the southeastern Sacramento Valley&nbsp;
(Keeler-Wolf et al. 1998) and always has been restricted to Sacramento&nbsp;
County. From 1990, this species was known from a total of seven natural&nbsp;
occurrences and one introduction (Stone et al. 1988; CNDDB 2002).&nbsp;
Within the past decade, O. viscida has been discovered at one new site&nbsp;
in Sacramento County within the previously known range. However, one&nbsp;
entire occurrence and a portion of another have been extirpated. Thus,&nbsp;
eight of the nine occurrences are still in existence. Five occurrences,&nbsp;
comprising more than 70 percent of the occupied habitat, are&nbsp;
concentrated into a single small area east of Mather Field. Two other&nbsp;
occurrences are adjacent to each other: Phoenix Field Ecological&nbsp;
Reserve and the introduced occurrence at Phoenix Park. The eighth&nbsp;
existing occurrence is near Rancho Seco Lake (Stone et al. 1988:&nbsp;
Cochrane, in litt. 1995a; CNDDB 2002).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Orcuttia viscida has been found in Northern Hardpan and Northern&nbsp;
Volcanic Mudflow vernal pools (Sawyer and Keeler-Wolf 1995). It occurs&nbsp;
on high terrace sites (Stone et al. 1988) at elevations of 150 to 270&nbsp;
ft (46 to 82 m) (CNDDB 2002). Occupied pools occur in blue oak woodland&nbsp;
and annual grassland (Crampton 1959; Griggs 1977; CNDDB 2002). Among&nbsp;
occupied pools discovered prior to 1988, the median area was 0.69 ac&nbsp;
(0.28 ha) and ranged from 0.25 ac (0.1 ha) to 2.03 ac (0.82 ha).&nbsp;
Orcuttia viscida grows are acidic with an iron-silica hardpan (Stone et&nbsp;
al. 1988), and the pools contain numerous cobbles (Crampton 1959; Stone&nbsp;
et al. 1988). Four of the known occurrences are on soils in the Redding&nbsp;
series, two are on Red Bluff-Redding complex soils, two are (or were)&nbsp;
on Xerarents-urban land-San Joaquin complex, and one is on Corning&nbsp;
complex soils.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further discussion on the life history and habitat characteristics&nbsp;
of Orcuttia viscida can be found in the final rule to list the species&nbsp;
(62 FR 14338).

Orcuttia inaequalis

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Robert Hoover (1936b) described Orcuttia inaequalis (San Joaquin&nbsp;
Valley Orcutt grass) based on a collection from ``Montpellier [sic],&nbsp;
Stanislaus County.'' Robert Hoover (1941) subsequently reduced this&nbsp;
taxon to a variety of californica, using the combination Orcuttia&nbsp;
californica var. inaequalis. Based on differences in morphology, seed&nbsp;
size, and chromosome number, John Reeder (1980) restored the taxon to&nbsp;
species status.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mature plants of Orcuttia inaequalis grow in tufts of several erect&nbsp;
stems. Plants of this species appear grayish-green due to the long&nbsp;
hairs on the stem and leaves and produces exudate. Orcuttia plants grow&nbsp;
underwater for 3 months or more and have evolved specific adaptations&nbsp;
for aquatic growth (Keeley 1998a).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the 49 occurrences of Orcuttia inaequalis reported in CNDDB&nbsp;
(2002), 28 occurrences are presumed extant; 18 are certainly extirpated&nbsp;
and three others are possibly extirpated because the habitat has been&nbsp;
modified (CNDDB 2002). However, only 12 of the occurrences presumed&nbsp;
still in existence have been revisited within the past decade, so even&nbsp;
the most recent information is outdated. Of the 28 occurrences of&nbsp;
Orcuttia inaequalis, Fresno County has two, Madera County has seven,&nbsp;
Merced County has 18, and Tulare County has one occurrence. This&nbsp;
species has been completely extirpated from Stanislaus County (Stone et&nbsp;
al. 1988; Skinner and Pavlik 1994; CNDDB 2002).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Orcuttia inaequalis occurs on alluvial fans, high and low stream&nbsp;
terraces (Stone et al. 1988), and tabletop lava flows (Stebbins et al.&nbsp;
1995; CNDDB 2002). This species has been reported in Northern Claypan,&nbsp;
Northern Hardpan, and Northern Basalt Flow vernal pools (Sawyer and&nbsp;
Keeler-Wolf 1995) within rolling grassland (Crampton 1959). Occupied&nbsp;
pools range in surface area from 0.05 to 12.1 ac (0.02 to 4.9 ha), with&nbsp;
a median area of 1.54 ac (0.62 ha)

[[Page 46695]]

(Stone et al. 1988). Orcuttia inaequalis has been reported at&nbsp;
elevations of 100 to 2,475 ft (30 to 755 m); the highest elevation&nbsp;
sites are those on the volcanic tabletops of Fresno and Madera Counties&nbsp;
(Stebbins et al. 1995; CNDDB 2002).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pools where Orcuttia inaequalis is known to occur form on&nbsp;
acidic soils that vary in texture from clay to sandy loam. Soil series&nbsp;
represented include the Hideaway series on Fresno-Madera County&nbsp;
volcanic tabletops, and Amador, Cometa, Corning, Greenfield, Los&nbsp;
Robles, Madera, Peters, Pollasky-Montpellier complex, Raynor, Redding,&nbsp;
and San Joaquin soil series elsewhere in the range. The impermeable&nbsp;
layer at historical or extant occurrences included iron-silica cemented&nbsp;
hardpan, tuffaceous alluvium, and basaltic rock from ancient volcanic&nbsp;
flows (Stone et al. 1988; Stebbins et al. 1995; EIP Associates 1999;&nbsp;
CNDDB 2002).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further discussion on the life history and habitat characteristics&nbsp;
of Orcuttia inaequalis can be found in the final rule to list the&nbsp;
species (62 FR 14338).

Orcuttia tenuis

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Albert Hitchcock (1934) named Orcuttia tenuis (slender Orcutt&nbsp;
grass). The type specimen was collected in Goose Valley, Shasta County,&nbsp;
in 1912. Orcuttia tenuis grows as single stems or in small tufts&nbsp;
consisting of a few stems. Plants are sparsely hairy and branch only&nbsp;
from the upper half of the stem. Although its stems typically are&nbsp;
erect, they may become decumbent if many branches form near the stem&nbsp;
tip (Reeder 1982). The inflorescence comprises more than half of the&nbsp;
plant's height, and the spikelets are more or less evenly spaced&nbsp;
throughout the inflorescence.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similar to other vernal pool annuals, the number of individual&nbsp;
plants within an occurrence of Orcuttia tenuis can vary greatly in size&nbsp;
from year to year. Fluctuations of up to four orders of magnitude have&nbsp;
been documented in Lake and Shasta Counties (Griggs 1980; Griggs and&nbsp;
Jain 1983). At the Vina Plains Preserve, the single occurrence ranged&nbsp;
in size from 1,000 to 147,700 individuals during the five times it was&nbsp;
reported over a 13-year period (Stone et al. 1988; Alexander and&nbsp;
Schlising 1997). However, O. tenuis occurrences do not always fluctuate&nbsp;
in numbers of plants. Among five occurrences of O. tenuis that Griggs&nbsp;
tracked from 1973 to 1979, two in the Dales area remained at the same&nbsp;
order of magnitude for the entire period. None of the other five&nbsp;
species of Orcuttieae included in the study remained stable for the&nbsp;
full 7 years (Griggs 1980; Griggs and Jain 1983).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Orcuttia tenuis has the largest geographical range of all the&nbsp;
members of the Orcuttieae. The species is known from 35 occurrences in&nbsp;
Tehama County, 24 in Shasta County, 5 from Lassen County, 4 from Plumas&nbsp;
County, 2 in Sacramento County, and 2 each in Butte, Lake, Modoc,&nbsp;
Sacramento, and Siskiyou Counties (CNDDB 2002). An additional&nbsp;
occurrence has recently been found in Sacramento County (ESA 2001).&nbsp;
Extirpated occurrences of O. tenuis occur near Reading Airport and&nbsp;
Stillwater Plains in Shasta County, and additional possibly extirpated&nbsp;
occurrences were near Goose Valley and Battle Creek in Tehama and&nbsp;
Shasta Counties (CNDDB 2002).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Orcuttia tenuis is found primarily on substrates of volcanic origin&nbsp;
(Crampton 1959; Corbin and Schoolcraft 1989). Vernal pools in which&nbsp;
Orcuttia tenuis grows are classified as Northern Volcanic Ashflow and&nbsp;
Northern Volcanic Mudflow vernal pools (Sawyer and Keeler-Wolf 1995).&nbsp;
Impervious layers range from iron-silica hardpan to bedrock (Stone et&nbsp;
al. 1988; Corbin and Schoolcraft 1989; CNDDB 2001). Among the&nbsp;
populations studied by Stone and others (1988), the median area of&nbsp;
pools occupied by O. tenuis was 1.6 ac (0.65 ha) and ranged from 0.2 to&nbsp;
111 ac (0.08 to 45 ha). On the Modoc Plateau, occupied pools known as&nbsp;
of 1989 ranged in size from 5 to 100 ac (2 to 40 ha) and were typically&nbsp;
at least 11.8 in (30 cm) deep; this species was restricted to the&nbsp;
deepest areas of these pools (Corbin and Schoolcraft 1989). Orcuttia&nbsp;
tenuis occurs through a wide range of elevations corresponding to its&nbsp;
broad geographical range. The lowest reported elevation was 90 ft (27&nbsp;
m) in Sacramento County (Stone et al. 1988) and the highest was 5,761&nbsp;
ft (1,756 m) in Plumas County (Corbin, in litt. 1999).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soil types supporting vernal pools where Orcuttia tenuis is known&nbsp;
to occur are diverse, ranging from slightly to strongly acidic (Stone&nbsp;
et al. 1988), and from clay to sandy, silty, or cobbly loam (Corbin and&nbsp;
Schoolcraft 1989; CNDDB 2001). The soil series has not been reported&nbsp;
for all O. tenuis sites, but the species has been reported on&nbsp;
Collayomi-Aiken-Whispering complex and the Konocti-Hambright complex&nbsp;
soils. Modoc Plateau occurrences occur on the Gooval, Lasvar, Lasvar-
Pitvar complex, and Nosoni soil series, whereas occurrences in&nbsp;
northeastern Sacramento Valley are on the Anita, Guenon, Inks, Inskip,&nbsp;
Laniger, Moda, Redding, Toomes, and Tuscan soil series. The Redding&nbsp;
soil series also supports O. tenuis in Sacramento County (Stone et al.&nbsp;
1988; CNDDB 2001).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Associated species vary throughout the range of Orcuttia tenuis.&nbsp;
Although O. tenuis grows in the same vernal pool complexes as O.&nbsp;
pillosa in Tehama County (including the Vina Plains Preserve), and&nbsp;
Orcuttia viscida in Sacramento County, it has not been found to share&nbsp;
any pools with either species (Stone et al. 1988; Cochrane in litt.&nbsp;
1995a; Alexander and Schlising 1997; CNDDB 2001).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further discussion on the life history and habitat characteristics&nbsp;
of Orcuttia tenuis can be found in the final rule to list the species&nbsp;
(62 FR 14338).

Tuctoria mucronata

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tuctoria mucronata (Solano grass) was originally described under&nbsp;
the name Orcuttia mucronata based on specimens collected ``12 miles due&nbsp;
south of Dixon, Solano County'' (Crampton 1959, p. 108). John Reeder&nbsp;
(1982) transferred this species to a new genus, Tuctoria, resulting in&nbsp;
the currently accepted name Tuctoria mucronata.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tuctoria mucronata is grayish-green, pilose, and sticky. The tufted&nbsp;
stems are decumbent and do not branch. The long leaves are rolled&nbsp;
inward and have pointed tips. The base of the inflorescence is&nbsp;
partially hidden by the uppermost leaves. As is characteristic of the&nbsp;
genus, the spikelets are arranged in a spiral; the spikelets in the&nbsp;
inflorescence of Tuctoria mucronata are crowded together.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Annual estimates or individual plant counts at Olcott Lake (Holland&nbsp;
1987; CNDDB 2002) indicated that occurrence sizes for this species&nbsp;
fluctuate dramatically from year to year, as do other members of the&nbsp;
Orcuttieae. Tuctoria mucronata was not observed at Olcott Lake from&nbsp;
1976 through 1980, then reappeared in 1981 (Holland 1987), indicating&nbsp;
that viable seeds can persist in the soil for a minimum of 5 years.&nbsp;
Apparently both drought years and years of excessively high rainfall&nbsp;
are unfavorable for Tuctoria mucronata; the largest expressions of this&nbsp;
species were observed after rainfall seasons of 17.7 to 23.6 in (45 to&nbsp;
60 cm) of precipitation (Holland 1987).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prior to 1985, Tuctoria mucronata was known only from Olcott Lake&nbsp;
in Solano County, which is believed to be the type locality (Crampton&nbsp;
1959; CNDDB 2002). A second occurrence was discovered in 1985&nbsp;
approximately 2.5 mi (4 km) southwest of Olcott Lake (CNDDB 2002).&nbsp;
Tuctoria mucronata is considered to be possibly extirpated from its&nbsp;
type locality, because only four individual plants have been found&nbsp;
within the last decade, all in 1993 (CNDDB 2002). The other Solano

[[Page 46696]]

County site is still in existence. A third occurrence, comprising the&nbsp;
largest occurrence known, was discovered in 1993 on a Department of&nbsp;
Defense (DOD) communications facility in Yolo County (CNDDB 2002).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tuctoria mucronata has been found only in the Northern Claypan type&nbsp;
of vernal pool (Sawyer and Keeler-Wolf 1995) within annual grassland&nbsp;
(CNDDB 2002). Pools where T. mucronata occurs tend to be milky from&nbsp;
suspended sediments (Holland 1987). The occupied pools in Solano County&nbsp;
are more properly described as alkaline playas or intermittent lakes&nbsp;
due to their large surface area (Crampton 1959), whereas those at the&nbsp;
Yolo County site are ``relatively small'' (Witham, in litt. 2000a).&nbsp;
Soils underlying known T. mucronata sites are saline-alkaline clay or&nbsp;
silty clay in the Pescadero series (Crampton 1959; CNDDB 2002). Known&nbsp;
occurrences are at elevations of approximately 15 to 35 ft (5 to 11 m)&nbsp;
(CNDDB 2002).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further discussion of the life history and habitat characteristics&nbsp;
of Tuctoria mucronata can be found in the Delta Green Ground Beetle and&nbsp;
Solano Grass Recovery Plan (Service 1985c), and in the final rule to&nbsp;
list the species (43 FR 44810; September 28, 1978).

Previous Federal Action

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This rulemaking is being made in accordance with a consent decree&nbsp;
reached in the U. S. District Court for the Eastern District of&nbsp;
California, on December 5, 2002. The following outlines the previous&nbsp;
Federal actions and litigation filed after the publication of the&nbsp;
proposed rule. For more information regarding Federal actions prior to&nbsp;
the publication of the proposed rule, see the Previous Federal Action&nbsp;
section in the proposed rule (67 FR 59884).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On September 24, 2002 (67 FR 59884), we published a proposed&nbsp;
critical habitat designation for four vernal pool crustaceans and 11&nbsp;
vernal pool plants. Publication of the proposed rule opened a 60-day&nbsp;
public comment period, which closed on November 25, 2002. On October&nbsp;
10, 2002, we published a notice (67 FR 63067) announcing three public&nbsp;
hearings. The public hearings were held on October 22, 2002, in San&nbsp;
Luis Obispo, California; and October 24, 2002, in Sacramento,&nbsp;
California, and Medford, Oregon. In addition, public workshops were&nbsp;
held in Chico, Sacramento, and Fresno in California and Medford,&nbsp;
Oregon. On November 21, 2002, we published a notice announcing the&nbsp;
availability of our draft economic analysis (DEA) on the proposed&nbsp;
critical habitat designation (67 FR 70201). The notice opened a public&nbsp;
comment period on the DEA, and extended the comment period on the&nbsp;
proposed critical habitat designation. This comment period was extended&nbsp;
for approximately 30 days, closing on December 23, 2002.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On December 5, 2002, the district court approved a settlement&nbsp;
agreement between the parties that extended the deadline for&nbsp;
designation of critical habitat from February 14, 2003, until July 15,&nbsp;
2003. On March 14, 2003, we published a notice announcing the reopening&nbsp;
of the public comment period for approximately 14 days on the proposed&nbsp;
designation of critical habitat for these 15 vernal pool species (68 FR&nbsp;
12336) and the DEA, closing on March 28, 2003.

Summary of Comments and Recommendations

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the September 24, 2002, proposed critical habitat designation&nbsp;
(67 FR 59884) and subsequent comment periods, we requested all&nbsp;
interested parties to submit comments on the specifics of the proposal,&nbsp;
including information related to the critical habitat designation, unit&nbsp;
boundaries, species occurrence information and distribution, land use&nbsp;
designations that may affect critical habitat, potential economic&nbsp;
effects of the proposed designation, benefits associated with critical&nbsp;
habitat designation, potential exclusions and the associated rationale&nbsp;
for the exclusions, and methods used to designate critical habitat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We contacted all appropriate State and Federal agencies, county&nbsp;
governments, elected officials, and other interested parties and&nbsp;
invited them to comment. This was accomplished through telephone calls,&nbsp;
letters, and news releases faxed and/or mailed to affected elected&nbsp;
officials, media outlets, local jurisdictions, interest groups and&nbsp;
other interested individuals. In addition, we invited public comment&nbsp;
through the publication of legal notices in numerous newspaper and news&nbsp;
media throughout California and Oregon. We provided notification of the&nbsp;
DEA and proposed rule to all interested parties. At the request of the&nbsp;
Merced County Board of Supervisors, we attempted to notify all Merced&nbsp;
County landowners within the proposed vernal pool critical habitat and&nbsp;
requested that they provide comments. We provided them contacts where&nbsp;
they could direct questions regarding the proposed designation. We also&nbsp;
posted the proposed rule and DEA and associated material on our&nbsp;
Sacramento Fish and Wildlife Office internet site following their&nbsp;
release on September 24, 2002, and November 21, 2002, respectively.&nbsp;
Additionally, we developed an internet site to provide interactive&nbsp;
Geographic Information Systems (GIS) maps of the proposed critical&nbsp;
habitat boundaries overlaid on 250K USGS. quadrangle maps.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We received a total of 955 comment letters during the 2 comment&nbsp;
periods. Comments were received from Federal, State, and local&nbsp;
agencies, and private organizations and individuals. We reviewed all&nbsp;
comments received for substantive issues and comments and new&nbsp;
information regarding the vernal pool plants and vernal pool&nbsp;
crustaceans. Similar comments were grouped into several general issue&nbsp;
categories relating specifically to the proposed critical habitat&nbsp;
determination and the DEA and are identified below.

Peer Review

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We requested 6 biologists, who have knowledge of vernal pool&nbsp;
ecosystems and the 15 species addressed in this rule, to provide&nbsp;
scientific review of the proposed designation of critical habitat.&nbsp;
Three of the six reviewers submitted comments on the proposed&nbsp;
designation. Two of the reviewers strongly endorsed the approach in the&nbsp;
proposal that protecting vernal pools in the context of surrounding&nbsp;
upland watersheds is crucial for the conservation and long-term&nbsp;
survival of the listed vernal pool species, and stated that the rule&nbsp;
placed appropriate emphasis on protecting intact vernal pool complexes.&nbsp;
The reviewers also cited the importance of conserving a wide range of&nbsp;
vernal pool habitat types and biological diversity. The reviewers&nbsp;
recommended that additional historical locations of the listed species&nbsp;
be considered for critical habitat, and specifically recommended&nbsp;
inclusion of vernal pool habitat in Santa Barbara County that once&nbsp;
supported Lasthenia conjugens. The third reviewer provided specific&nbsp;
technical comments on the proposed rule and those recommendations have&nbsp;
been incorporated into this final rule.

State Agencies

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We received comments from the following California State agencies:&nbsp;
Department of Fish and Game (CDFG), Department of Forestry and Fire&nbsp;
Protection (CDF), Department of Transportation (Caltrans), and the&nbsp;
Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD). Technical data&nbsp;
provided by the CDFG has been incorporated into or addressed in this&nbsp;
final rule, while other issues raised by State agencies are addressed&nbsp;
below.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; State Comment 1: The CDFG has considerable knowledge of wildlife&nbsp;
resources within California, and we

[[Page 46697]]

should work with CDFG in developing critical habitat designations for&nbsp;
federally listed species.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Response: In developing the proposed rule, we solicited&nbsp;
information from CDFG biologists familiar with the local land areas&nbsp;
through out California, vernal pool species, and vernal pool habitat.&nbsp;
We used the local expertise of our counterparts in CDFG regional&nbsp;
offices to help us determine which areas were essential to the 15&nbsp;
vernal pool species addressed in this rule, and to determine the&nbsp;
appropriate boundaries for the critical habitat. Further, one of the&nbsp;
primary data sources that was used in the development of our proposal&nbsp;
and this final rule was the State Natural Heritage occurrence and&nbsp;
natural diversity database--the CNDDB. We additionally consulted with&nbsp;
the CDFG when we had questions regarding species occurrence data and if&nbsp;
any new information was available which was not in the database. We&nbsp;
view the CDFG as a partner in natural resource management and&nbsp;
protection in California, and will continue to work closely with them.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; State Comment 2: Some areas within the proposed critical habitat&nbsp;
designation do not contain the necessary habitat requirements for the&nbsp;
species (e.g., Grasslands Ecological Unit, Merced County).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Response: On the basis of information provided by the public,&nbsp;
the scientific community, and other Federal, State, and local&nbsp;
government officials, we have revised the critical habitat unit&nbsp;
boundaries for the 15 vernal pool species, including the area&nbsp;
encompassing the Grasslands Ecological Unit, to better reflect those&nbsp;
areas containing the primary constituent elements (PCEs) (see Methods,&nbsp;
Summary of Changes from Proposed Rule, and Unit Maps).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; State Comment 3: The CDFG believes all CDFG lands should be&nbsp;
excluded from critical habitat, given the requirement of consultation&nbsp;
pursuant to section 7 of the Act for Federal actions, and CDFG's&nbsp;
trustee responsibility for protecting the State's wildlife resources,&nbsp;
including federally listed species.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Response: We have excluded CDFG owned lands within the Battle&nbsp;
Creek, Big Sandy, Grizzly Island, Hill Slough, North Grasslands, and&nbsp;
Oroville Wildlife Areas and State-owned lands within Allensworth, Boggs&nbsp;
Lake, Butte Creek Canyon, Calhoun Cut, Carrizo Plains, Dales Lake,&nbsp;
Fagan Marsh, Phoenix Field, San Joaquin River, Stone Corral, and Thomes&nbsp;
Creek Ecological Reserves. The total amount of land excluded for State-
owned lands excluded within wildlife areas or ecological reserves is&nbsp;
approximately 20,933 ac (8,373 ha). These exclusions are based on the&nbsp;
CDFG's trustee responsibility for protecting the State's wildlife&nbsp;
resources, including federally listed species.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; State Comment 4: The CDFG believes that designating critical&nbsp;
habitat on lands covered under Habitat Conservation Plans (HCPs) and&nbsp;
Natural Community Conservation Plans (NCCPs) provides little benefits&nbsp;
for species covered under these plans.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Response: We recognize that critical habitat is only one of&nbsp;
many conservation tools for federally listed species. However, HCPs are&nbsp;
one of the most important tools for reconciling land use with the&nbsp;
conservation of listed species on non-Federal lands. Section 4(b)(2) of&nbsp;
the Act allows us to exclude from critical habitat designation areas&nbsp;
where the benefits of exclusion outweigh the benefits of designation,&nbsp;
provided the exclusion will not result in the extinction of the&nbsp;
species. We believe that in most instances the benefits of excluding&nbsp;
HCPs from critical habitat designations will outweigh the benefits of&nbsp;
including them. For this designation, we find that the benefits of&nbsp;
exclusion outweigh the benefits of designation for all approved and&nbsp;
legally operative HCPs in which vernal pool species are covered. Please&nbsp;
refer to the Relationship of Critical Habitat to Habitat Conservation&nbsp;
Plans and Relationship of Critical Habitat to the Western Riverside&nbsp;
Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan sections of this final rule&nbsp;
for a more detailed discussion of how approved and pending HCPs have&nbsp;
been addressed in this final designation.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; State Comment 5: The CDFG believes that all future HCPs and NCCPs&nbsp;
should be removed from critical habitat once they are approved.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Response: We anticipate that future HCPs in the range of the 15&nbsp;
vernal pool species will include them as a covered species and provide&nbsp;
for their long term conservation. We expect that HCPs undertaken by&nbsp;
local jurisdictions (e.g., counties and cities) and other parties will&nbsp;
identify, protect, and provide appropriate management for those&nbsp;
specific lands within the boundaries of the plans that are essential&nbsp;
for the long term conservation of the species. Section 10(a)(1)(B) of&nbsp;
the Act states that HCPs must meet issuance criteria, including&nbsp;
minimizing and mitigating any take of the listed species covered by the&nbsp;
permit to the maximum extent practicable, and that the taking must not&nbsp;
appreciably reduce the likelihood of the survival and recovery of the&nbsp;
species in the wild. We fully expect that our future analyses of HCPs&nbsp;
and section 10(a)(1)(B) permits under section 7 will show that covered&nbsp;
activities carried out in accordance with the provisions of the HCPs&nbsp;
and section 10(a)(1)(B) permits will not result in the destruction or&nbsp;
adverse modification of critical habitat designated for the vernal pool&nbsp;
species. The take minimization and mitigation measures provided under&nbsp;
these HCPs are expected to adequately protect the essential habitat&nbsp;
lands designated as critical habitat in this rule, such that the value&nbsp;
of these lands for the survival and recovery of the vernal pool species&nbsp;
is not appreciably diminished through direct or indirect alterations.&nbsp;
If an HCP that addresses the vernal pool species as covered species is&nbsp;
ultimately approved, we will reassess the critical habitat boundaries&nbsp;
in light of the HCP. If, consistent with available funding and program&nbsp;
priorities, we elect to revise this designation, we will do so through&nbsp;
a subsequent rulemaking.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The designation of critical habitat should not deter participation&nbsp;
in the NCCP or HCP processes. Approvals issued under these processes&nbsp;
include assurances of no additional mitigation through the HCP No&nbsp;
Surprises regulation (63 FR 8859). The development of new HCPs or NCCPs&nbsp;
should not be affected by designation of critical habitat primarily&nbsp;
because we view the standards of jeopardy for listed species and of&nbsp;
adverse modification for critical habitat as being virtually identical.&nbsp;
We discuss these standards in detail in the Section 7 Consultation&nbsp;
section portion of this document.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; State Comment 6: CDFG expressed concern that designation of&nbsp;
critical habitat will increase the regulatory and/or economic burden&nbsp;
for project proponents, because many of their programs, such as&nbsp;
vegetation management and fire hazard reduction, are administered on&nbsp;
private lands with Federal cost-share funds. CDFG also requested us to&nbsp;
address land management activities that benefit vernal pool habitats.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Response: We do not anticipate that this designation will&nbsp;
result in significant increases in regulatory requirements for programs&nbsp;
involving Federal cost-share funds over those which have existed since&nbsp;
the time of the listing of each of the 15 vernal pool species. All of&nbsp;
these activities, to the extent that they modify vernal pool habitat,&nbsp;
have the potential to affect federally listed species and thus trigger&nbsp;
the informal or formal consultation requirements of section 7 of the&nbsp;
Act. Even beneficial land management actions, if they are likely to&nbsp;
result in ``take'' of listed vernal pool crustaceans, must receive&nbsp;
appropriate incidental take

[[Page 46698]]

authorization through section 7 or section 10 of the Act. The&nbsp;
regulatory requirements of section 7 consultation that are established&nbsp;
with the listing of a species and the requirements associated with&nbsp;
critical habitat designation are discussed in detail in the section&nbsp;
Effects of Critical Habitat Designation. A discussion of land&nbsp;
management activities, including prescribed burning and grazing, that&nbsp;
are beneficial to vernal pool habitats, can be found in the section&nbsp;
Special Management Considerations.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; State Comment 7: Caltrans requested that we exclude transportation&nbsp;
infrastructure, particularly operating right-of-way, from the&nbsp;
designation because these areas are not essential to the conservation&nbsp;
of the species.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Response: We understand the concern of the transportation&nbsp;
agencies over having habitat within transportation infrastructure&nbsp;
designated as critical habitat. Such areas are included in this&nbsp;
designation for several reasons: (1) many areas contain occurrences of&nbsp;
the listed vernal pool species and the PCEs; and (2) we did not have&nbsp;
the time, resources, or the appropriate GIS data layers to segregate&nbsp;
these areas from adjacent vernal pool habitat, evaluate their&nbsp;
importance to the conservation of the 15 vernal pool species separately&nbsp;
from adjacent vernal pool habitat that we had determined to be&nbsp;
essential, and then produce maps and legal descriptions of essential&nbsp;
habitat around them, but not including them. Many transportation agency&nbsp;
activities involving right-of-way maintenance already trigger section 7&nbsp;
consultation requirements because they support habitat occupied by&nbsp;
listed vernal pool species, and because of the Federal nexus provided&nbsp;
by the Federal Highway Administration. We do not anticipate that this&nbsp;
designation will result in a significant increase in regulatory&nbsp;
requirements over those that have existed since the time of the listing&nbsp;
of each of the 15 vernal pool species. A more detailed explanation of&nbsp;
regulatory requirements of section 7 consultation that are established&nbsp;
with the listing of a species, and the requirements associated with&nbsp;
critical habitat designation, are discussed in the section Effects of&nbsp;
Critical Habitat Designation.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; State Comment 8: The HCD commented that the information and public&nbsp;
review period for the draft economic analysis was insufficient,&nbsp;
expressed concern over the broad standardized scale of the economic&nbsp;
analysis, and suggested that a more discrete level of analysis is&nbsp;
necessary to credibly project economic costs and benefits of the&nbsp;
designation through the 20-year analysis period.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Response: The draft economic analysis of the proposed critical&nbsp;
habitat designation was made available to the public for review and&nbsp;
comment on November 21, 2002, (67 FR 70201). At that time, we opened a&nbsp;
30-day public comment period, on both the proposal and the draft&nbsp;
economic analysis, which closed on December 23, 2003. On March 14,&nbsp;
2003, we reopened the comment period for both the proposal and the&nbsp;
draft economic analysis for an additional 14 days, ending March 28,&nbsp;
2003 (68 FR 12336). Consequently, the public was provided approximately&nbsp;
45-days to review and provide comment on the draft economic analysis.&nbsp;
As stated in this final rule, we acknowledge the limitations imposed by&nbsp;
conducting public rulemaking under abbreviated, court mandated&nbsp;
schedules, and that, as a result, we are not always able to provide&nbsp;
adequate public participation in the process.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For large designations, such as this rule, the 4(b)(2) decision&nbsp;
will consider broad geographic areas, rather than individual parcels or&nbsp;
projects. The level of detail provided in this analysis is appropriate&nbsp;
to the size of areas considered for exclusion. In addition, a more&nbsp;
detailed analysis would not necessarily produce a more accurate&nbsp;
estimate of potential impacts. Parcel-by-parcel analysis of costs may&nbsp;
achieve greater certainty for projects that have already been approved&nbsp;
by local planners. However predicting the location and characteristics&nbsp;
of future projects on a parcel-by-parcel basis using the same sources&nbsp;
of data will result in greater uncertainty as the time frame for the&nbsp;
analysis increases. For this rulemaking, it is unlikely that a more&nbsp;
detailed analysis would produce a significantly different answer.

Other Public Comments and Responses

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We address other substantive comments and accompanying information&nbsp;
in the following summary. Relatively minor editing changes and&nbsp;
reference updates suggested by commenters have been incorporated into&nbsp;
this final rule or the final economic analysis, as appropriate.

Issue 1--Habitat and Species Specific Information

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comment 1: Several commenters, including county and local&nbsp;
governmental representatives, stated that the designation was not based&nbsp;
on the best scientific data available, and that we have not adequately&nbsp;
established that the areas identified as critical habitat contain PCEs&nbsp;
essential for the species.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Response: We believe that we used the best scientific and&nbsp;
commercial information available in determined those areas essential&nbsp;
for the 15 vernal pool species that were proposed as critical habitat&nbsp;
and subsequently finalized. However, the mapping scale that we used&nbsp;
resulted in a more inclusive proposal. In our final determination, we&nbsp;
had additional information available to us, including detailed aerial&nbsp;
imagery and other information provided by commenters to assist us in&nbsp;
refining our mapping of essential habitat. Please refer to the&nbsp;
Background, Criteria Used to Identify Critical Habitat, and Unit&nbsp;
Description sections of this rule for further discussion on how we&nbsp;
determined habitat that is essential to the conservation of the 15&nbsp;
vernal pool species. After refining our proposal and weighing the best&nbsp;
available information, we conclude that the areas designated by this&nbsp;
final rule, including currently occupied and unoccupied areas, are&nbsp;
essential for the conservation of these species.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comment 2: Several commenters held that nothing has changed from&nbsp;
the listing of the species, and that our determination that the&nbsp;
designation of critical habitat was not prudent or determinable should&nbsp;
remain in place. One commenter stated that we did not evaluate whether&nbsp;
critical habitat was determinable and that an analysis needs to be&nbsp;
performed according to regulations.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Response: As outlined in the Prudency Redetermination section&nbsp;
of the proposed rule, at the time of the final listing determination&nbsp;
for the 15 vernal pool species, we found that designation of critical&nbsp;
habitat was not prudent for the vernal pool crustaceans and plants&nbsp;
(excluding Tuctoria mucronata) because of potential threats, and that a&nbsp;
designation of critical habitat was not beneficial for these species.&nbsp;
Case law (Conservation Council For Hawai'i v. Babbitt, 2 F. Supp.2d&nbsp;
1280 (D.Hawai'i 1998) and Natural Resources Defense Council v. U.S.&nbsp;
Dept. of Interior, 113 F.3d 1121 (9th Cir. 1997)) has changed how we&nbsp;
balance the risks and benefits of critical habitat designations since&nbsp;
we listed the 15 vernal pool species. In Building Industry Association&nbsp;
v. Babbitt, 979 F Supp. 893 (1997), we were directed by the court to&nbsp;
reevaluate our not prudent determination for the four listed vernal&nbsp;
pool crustaceans. Our record lead us to reconsider our previous not&nbsp;
prudent determinations for the 11 plants in light of the new case law&nbsp;
and policy. We have

[[Page 46699]]

determined that the threats to the vernal pool crustaceans and plants&nbsp;
and their habitat from the specific instances of habitat destruction we&nbsp;
identified in the final listing rules do not outweigh the broader&nbsp;
educational, regulatory, and other possible benefits that a designation&nbsp;
of critical habitat would provide for these species. We believe there&nbsp;
is sufficient information available on the 15 vernal pool species to&nbsp;
find that critical habitat is determinable for these species, and that&nbsp;
an analysis of the impacts of the designation can be performed&nbsp;
according to 50 CFR 424.12(a)(2)(i).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comment 3: Several commenters stated that the species are not&nbsp;
threatened or endangered because of their widespread distribution.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Response: Species may be listed under the Act if the species is&nbsp;
in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its&nbsp;
range by one or more of the five listing factors (endangered species),&nbsp;
or if the species is likely to become endangered in the foreseeable&nbsp;
future, throughout all or a significant portion of its range by one or&nbsp;
more of the five listing factors (threatened species). The five listing&nbsp;
factors as defined in the Act are: (A) The present or threatened&nbsp;
destruction, modification, or curtailment of [a species'] habitat or&nbsp;
range; (B) overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or&nbsp;
educational purposes; (C) disease or predation; (D) the inadequacy of&nbsp;
existing regulatory mechanisms; and (E) other natural and manmade&nbsp;
factors affecting [a species'] continued existence. These factors apply&nbsp;
to both narrowly and widely distributed species.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As discussed in the final rules to list the 15 vernal species&nbsp;
addressed herein, the vernal pool crustaceans and plants are threatened&nbsp;
by habitat loss, degradation, and modification from land conversion and&nbsp;
degradation to the extent that known populations are endangered, or&nbsp;
likely to become endangered, throughout all or a significant portion of&nbsp;
their range. Thus, the vernal pool species are threatened by Factor A&nbsp;
and appear to meet the definitions of threatened or endangered,&nbsp;
regardless of having a relatively extensive distribution.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comment 4: Several commenters believe that we cannot realistically&nbsp;
determine critical habitat without first developing a recovery plan,&nbsp;
and that the determination of critical habitat should be postponed&nbsp;
until site specific surveys have been conducted and a recovery plan is&nbsp;
in place.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Response: Section 4 of the Act requires us to designate&nbsp;
critical habitat at the time of listing to the maximum extent prudent&nbsp;
and determinable. We concur that a recovery plan is a useful tool in&nbsp;
assisting us with determining which areas are essential for the&nbsp;
conservation of a species. We are currently developing a draft recovery&nbsp;
plan for these vernal pool species, and have been able to use the&nbsp;
information and gathered and analysis conducted to date for the draft&nbsp;
recovery plan in helping us determine areas essential to the&nbsp;
conservation of the 15 vernal pool species addressed herein.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comment 5: Several commenters reported that vernal pools provide a&nbsp;
breeding source for mosquitoes. They stated that the designation would&nbsp;
lead to an increase in diseases such as infection of the West Nile&nbsp;
virus (Flavivirus sp.) and other mosquito-vectored diseases.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Response: The best information available to us indicates that&nbsp;
non-degraded vernal pools and swales do not provide a significant&nbsp;
breeding source for mosquitoes. Mosquitoes do not appear in vernal&nbsp;
pools until very late in the season, when they are unlikely to complete&nbsp;
their development before the pools dry (Wright 1991). Female mosquitoes&nbsp;
are attracted to gases produced by fermentation that indicate an&nbsp;
abundance of decaying organic matter suitable for food for mosquito&nbsp;
larvae (Wright 1991). This is the likely cue used by females mosquitos&nbsp;
to select oviposition sites. Healthy vernal pools appear to have&nbsp;
relatively low levels of decaying organic material, which makes them&nbsp;
undesirable as oviposition sites for gravid mosquitoes (Wright 1991).&nbsp;
Only late in the season, when the abundance of invertebrates in vernal&nbsp;
pools begins to decline, are enough nutrients and organic material&nbsp;
available to make the vernal pools attractive to mosquitos. By this&nbsp;
time, however, it is often too late for the mosquito larvae to develop&nbsp;
before the pools dry.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comment 6: One commenter stated that there are occurrences of the&nbsp;
vernal pool plants and vernal pool crustaceans on protected lands, and&nbsp;
for this reason, additional lands are not needed for the conservation&nbsp;
of the species. Other commenters contended that the acreage in the&nbsp;
proposed rule should represent the minimum amount of land considered&nbsp;
critical for the 15 vernal pool species.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Response: We recognize that while some occurrences of the&nbsp;
vernal pool plants and vernal pool crustaceans are found on protected&nbsp;
public and private lands, only about 16 percent of the lands designated&nbsp;
as critical habitat are on Federal land or are protected by a&nbsp;
conservation easement. A smaller percentage of these lands are managed&nbsp;
for protection of vernal pool resources and specifically for the&nbsp;
species addressed in this rule. Restricting the designation to&nbsp;
currently protected lands would exclude areas that we believe are&nbsp;
essential to the conservation of the 15 vernal pool species. We based&nbsp;
the designation on the best scientific available and determined that&nbsp;
the designation identifies those areas believed to be essential for the&nbsp;
conservation of the species.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comment 7: The California Army National Guard (ARNG) asks that Camp&nbsp;
Roberts be excluded from the final critical habitat designation (ARNG&nbsp;
2002a). Letters from Fort Hunter Liggett and the Headquarters of the&nbsp;
United States Army Reserve Command state they do not agree with&nbsp;
designating critical habitat on the base, and that the designation is&nbsp;
not necessary to protect vernal pool fairy shrimp (Fort Hunter Liggett&nbsp;
2002b; Department of the Army 2002).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The letters from Camp Roberts and Fort Hunter Liggett present&nbsp;
numerous reasons why critical habitat designation is not warranted on&nbsp;
the two bases. Some of these reasons include: suggestions that each&nbsp;
installation has an Integrated Natural Resources Management Plan&nbsp;
(INRMP) that provides protective measures for vernal pool fairy shrimp;&nbsp;
the two bases are implementing numerous activities that conserve vernal&nbsp;
pool fairy shrimp habitat; and critical habitat designation would&nbsp;
adversely affect the National Guard and Army's abilities to meet their&nbsp;
mission, i.e., train soldiers for combat situations.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Response: Camp Roberts and Fort Hunter Liggett have drafted&nbsp;
INRMPs that we have not signed. The current documents are therefore&nbsp;
working drafts that are being revised as the National Guard and Army&nbsp;
work together with us to finalize conservation strategies that will&nbsp;
benefit all listed species on the two bases. After adequate&nbsp;
conservation strategies for all listed species on the bases are&nbsp;
incorporated into the two INRMPs, we expect to sign the documents and&nbsp;
will consider them final. We recognize the military is implementing&nbsp;
measures to conserve existing locations of vernal pool fairy shrimp and&nbsp;
the habitat they occupy. These activities include periodic monitoring&nbsp;
of selected pools, control of exotic plant species that may alter&nbsp;
vegetation communities around vernal pool habitat, fencing or&nbsp;
delineation of areas known to contain vernal pool fairy shrimp, and use&nbsp;
of review processes designed to avoid or minimize effects that may&nbsp;
arise during military training activities and base operations. We

[[Page 46700]]

believe additional measures are needed to promote natural ecosystem&nbsp;
processes that benefit listed fairy shrimp and these items will&nbsp;
continue to be the focus of future discussions with the military. We&nbsp;
recognize that designation of critical habitat has the potential to&nbsp;
modify military training operations and the use or development of base&nbsp;
facilities. We have determined that the benefits of excluding these&nbsp;
facilities outweigh the benefits of including them. Subsequently, Camp&nbsp;
Roberts and Fort Hunter Liggett have been excluded from this final&nbsp;
designation of critical habitat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comment 8: One commenter requests that the Indian Valley Cattle&nbsp;
Company and Porter Ranch Estate properties be excluded from the&nbsp;
Bradley-San Miguel critical habitat subunit in Monterey County. The&nbsp;
commenter references a letter from a consulting firm which states that&nbsp;
habitat mapping on one or both of the above-mentioned properties was&nbsp;
done, and that suitable habitat for fairy shrimp does not appear to be&nbsp;
present. The consultant's letter states that another company conducted&nbsp;
fairy shrimp surveys on the Porter Ranch Estate, and these&nbsp;
investigators did not find fairy shrimp.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Response: The Service's ``Interim Survey Guidelines to&nbsp;
Permittees under Section 10(a)(1)(A) of the Endangered Species Act for&nbsp;
the Listed Vernal Pool Branchiopods'' is used to establish the presence&nbsp;
or absence of listed fairy shrimp on a particular property. The&nbsp;
guidelines recommend that two wet season surveys for adult fairy&nbsp;
shrimp, or one wet season survey for adult and one dry season survey&nbsp;
for fairy shrimp cysts, be done at a site to determine the presence or&nbsp;
absence of fairy shrimp. Both surveys should demonstrate that fairy&nbsp;
shrimp are absent before the Service will concur with a determination&nbsp;
that fairy shrimp are absent from a site. We received a report from a&nbsp;
consultant in 2001 that states ephemeral aquatic habitat may occur on&nbsp;
the Porter Ranch Estate. We also received documents that indicate two&nbsp;
wet season surveys were conducted on that property. The second wet&nbsp;
season survey was done during a year when rainfall conditions were not&nbsp;
conducive to detecting adult fairy shrimp, i.e., aquatic habitat was&nbsp;
not present during the second survey, and it would not therefore have&nbsp;
been possible to determine the presence or absence of fairy shrimp. We&nbsp;
do not have appropriate documentation at this time that allows us to&nbsp;
conclude that fairy shrimp are absent from the Porter Ranch Estate.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While we do not have specific information that demonstrates that&nbsp;
fairy shrimp occur on the Indian Valley Cattle Company and Porter Ranch&nbsp;
Estate properties, we know vernal pool fairy shrimp occur on the Camp&nbsp;
Roberts military base 1 mi (1.6 km) west of Porter Ranch Estate and 0.5&nbsp;
mi ( 0.8 km) south of the Indian Valley Cattle Company property. We&nbsp;
believe additional undocumented occurrences of listed fairy shrimp are&nbsp;
likely to occur in suitable habitat on private property near Camp&nbsp;
Roberts. We also believe several unmapped vernal pools are likely to&nbsp;
occur on or near the two aforementioned properties because the presence&nbsp;
of several hundred vernal pools on Camp Roberts suggests that these&nbsp;
features are present within the local landscape. The Indian Valley&nbsp;
Cattle Company and Porter Ranch Estate properties are up gradient and&nbsp;
in close proximity to known and suspected vernal pool fairy shrimp&nbsp;
occurrences, and it is likely that water that originates on these&nbsp;
properties travels down gradient and contributes to the maintenance of&nbsp;
the hydrology and water quality of vernal pools that are occupied by&nbsp;
listed fairy shrimp on or near the Camp Roberts military base.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Following our evaluation of these lands, we still believe the&nbsp;
Indian Valley Cattle Company and Porter Ranch Estate properties are&nbsp;
within the localized watershed that contains essential vernal pool&nbsp;
habitat, and they contribute to the maintenance of their hydrology.&nbsp;
Consequently, it is our determination the land on these properties is&nbsp;
essential to the conservation of vernal pool habitat and should not be&nbsp;
excluded from designated critical habitat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comment 9: One individual asks that the Estrella Ranch area in San&nbsp;
Luis Obispo County be removed from the Paso Robles critical habitat&nbsp;
subunit. The landowner does not believe fairy shrimp or vernal pool&nbsp;
habitat exist on that ranch, and they are concerned that critical&nbsp;
habitat designation will affect their family's ranching activities.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Response: The Estrella Ranch occurs within a localized&nbsp;
watershed that contains documented occurrences of listed fairy shrimp.&nbsp;
Vernal pools complexes measuring at least 10 ac (4 ha) in size have&nbsp;
been mapped within 1-2 mi (1.6-3.2 km) of Estrella Ranch. These&nbsp;
complexes were identified during a habitat mapping contract (Holland&nbsp;
2003). The mapping contract did not attempt to map wetlands less than&nbsp;
10 ac (4 ha) in size, and it is likely that smaller, unmapped vernal&nbsp;
pools or vernal pool complexes which provide the necessary conditions&nbsp;
for vernal pool fairy shrimp to hatch, grow, and reproduce are present&nbsp;
in the local area.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Estrella Ranch is up gradient of vernal pool complexes that have&nbsp;
been mapped, and the topography of the ranch suggests water that&nbsp;
originates on that property is likely to travel down gradient and&nbsp;
contribute to the amount, duration, and frequency of water flow&nbsp;
necessary to maintain vernal pools southwest of the ranch property&nbsp;
boundary.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We believe Estrella Ranch occurs within a localized watershed that&nbsp;
contains essential vernal pool habitat, and the ranch contributes to&nbsp;
the maintenance of their hydrology. Consequently, it is our&nbsp;
determination this property is essential to the conservation of&nbsp;
documented vernal pool habitats, and should not be excluded from&nbsp;
designated critical habitat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Critical habitat designation will not affect the private landowner&nbsp;
unless specific portions of their property possess the primary&nbsp;
constituent elements associated with vernal pool fasiry shrimp critical&nbsp;
habitat, and the landowner proposes a project that would involve a&nbsp;
Federal nexus. The landowner has told Service employees he has&nbsp;
historically avoided projects that would create a Federal nexus.&nbsp;
Consequently, we do not believe the designation of critical habitat on&nbsp;
Estrella Ranch will significantly affect the landowner's ranching&nbsp;
activities.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comment 10: One individual associated with the Coastal Alliance on&nbsp;
Planned Expansion asks that we evaluate the possibility that fairy&nbsp;
shrimp are adversely affected by the operation of a power plant near&nbsp;
the Morro Bay National Estuary in San Luis Obispo County. The commentor&nbsp;
is concerned that use of ocean water to cool various hardware&nbsp;
components at the power plant may affect fairy shrimp.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Response: Fairy shrimp are inland species and are not&nbsp;
associated with marine environments. The intake of water to cool the&nbsp;
power plant near Morro Bay does not have the potential to adversely&nbsp;
affect vernal pool fairy shrimp or their habitat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comment 11: A number of commenters expressed concern over the&nbsp;
appropriateness of the proposal of Unit 33A for vernal pool fairy&nbsp;
shrimp. Riverside County Flood Control and Water Conservation District&nbsp;
stated that the Unit boundary is based on their ``approximate riverine&nbsp;
flood plain'' boundary and suggested that a more detailed analysis of&nbsp;
local hydrologic sources and watersheds associated with vernal pools&nbsp;
would be more accurate. Other concerns raised were: (1) The vernal pool&nbsp;
fairy shrimp is not associated with riverine systems; (2) the Unit&nbsp;
contains areas which do not

[[Page 46701]]

contain vernal pools and do not meet the proposed rule's definition of&nbsp;
critical habitat; (3) vernal pool fairy shrimp have not been documented&nbsp;
in the San Jacinto Unit (33A); and (4) vernal pool fairy shrimp and the&nbsp;
common versatile shrimp (Branchinecta lindahli) cannot co-occur.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Response: Although the boundary of the Unit 33A is the&nbsp;
approximate 20-year floodplain as identified by Riverside County Flood&nbsp;
Control and Water Conservation District, it was used because more than&nbsp;
99 percent of the known vernal pool associated species in the&nbsp;
floodplain occur within area delineated by that boundary. The reach of&nbsp;
the San Jacinto River included in the designation is extremely flat,&nbsp;
causing the river to pond on the floodplain from the low-flow channel&nbsp;
to the approximate 100-year floodplain. In the rainy season, the river&nbsp;
floodplain contains vernal pools, moist flats, and other ephemeral&nbsp;
wetlands. Areas which do not expressly contain ephemeral wetlands or&nbsp;
vernal pools are included to provide hydrology to vernal pools.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although surveys conducted in this unit during 2000 failed to&nbsp;
detect vernal pool fairy shrimp, although the common versatile fairy&nbsp;
shrimp was detected, it is important to note that not all of the pools&nbsp;
in the floodplain were surveyed, and rainfall conditions were not&nbsp;
conducive to detecting fairy shrimp. (i.e., in some places pools did&nbsp;
not fill or filled only briefly'an insufficient time for shrimp, if&nbsp;
present, to hatch).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit can be characterized as an alkali playa, one of the&nbsp;
habitat types that supports vernal pool fairy shrimp, and shares soil&nbsp;
and hydrologic characteristics with Unit 33B, where the common&nbsp;
versatile and vernal pool fairy shrimp co-occur. Both species are also&nbsp;
present at Skunk Hollow. Eriksen and Belk (1999) also report that the&nbsp;
common versatile fairy shrimp is known to co-occur with the vernal pool&nbsp;
fairy shrimp, although the two species may be detectable at varying&nbsp;
times during a vernal pool's wet phase.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit is essential to vernal pool fairy shrimp because it&nbsp;
represents the largest unfragmented, hydrologically and ecologically&nbsp;
functional vernal pool complex in the southern portion of the species'&nbsp;
range. The area of habitat is large enough to allow localized&nbsp;
occurrences to expand and contract, providing for normal population&nbsp;
dynamics and making the populations within this unit less susceptible&nbsp;
to environmental variation or negative impacts associated with human&nbsp;
disturbances or naturally occurring catastrophic events. Although it is&nbsp;
not known to be occupied, it contains the same edaphic and land form&nbsp;
characteristics as lands within Unit 33B, which is occupied by the&nbsp;
species.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comment 12: One commenter stated that the Riverside County units&nbsp;
(33-35) should be removed from designation because they represent only&nbsp;
a small portion of the range of the vernal pool fairy shrimp, and these&nbsp;
areas are already being protected.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Response: The area proposed as critical habitat for the vernal&nbsp;
pool fairy shrimp in Riverside County does comprise a small portion of&nbsp;
the overall area proposed as critical habitat for the species. However,&nbsp;
the vernal pools in these units supporting populations of the vernal&nbsp;
pool fairy shrimp represent the southernmost distribution of the&nbsp;
species in the Unites States. They are essential to ensuring the&nbsp;
genetic and geographic distribution of the species necessary for its&nbsp;
long-term conservation.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are excluding the critical habitat in Riverside County,&nbsp;
California (Units 33, 34 and 35) from this final designation. We are&nbsp;
excluding Unit 33 for the vernal pool fairy shrimp from final&nbsp;
designation because the vernal pool habitat within this unit will be&nbsp;
covered by the draft Western Riverside Multiple Species Habitat&nbsp;
Conservation Plan (MSHCP). Although the MSHCP has not been finalized&nbsp;
the measures afforded within the plan and the current assurances that&nbsp;
the plan will be completed will assist in the conservation of the&nbsp;
species. We are also excluding Unit 34 for the vernal pool fairy shrimp&nbsp;
from final designation because the vernal pool within this unit is&nbsp;
covered by an approved, legally operative HCP. Although the Rancho&nbsp;
Bella Vista HCP does not include the vernal pool fairy shrimp as a&nbsp;
covered species, the endangered Riverside fairy shrimp is covered by&nbsp;
this HCP. Because the Riverside fairy shrimp co-occurs with the vernal&nbsp;
pool fairy shrimp in this unit, we anticipate that management actions&nbsp;
taken to conserve Riverside fairy shrimp will provide equal benefits to&nbsp;
the vernal pool fairy shrimp. We have also excluded Unit 35 for vernal&nbsp;
pool fairy shrimp from final designation because this area, which lies&nbsp;
within the Santa Rosa Plateau Ecological Reserve, is managed for the&nbsp;
conservation of vernal pools that support populations of the vernal&nbsp;
pool fairy shrimp. Please refer to the Relationship of Critical Habitat&nbsp;
to Habitat Conservation Plans, Relationship of Critical Habitat to the&nbsp;
Western Riverside Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan, and&nbsp;
Relationship of Critical Habitat to Santa Rosa Plateau Ecological&nbsp;
Reserve: A State, Federal, and Local Cooperatively Managed Reserve&nbsp;
sections of this final rule for a more detailed discussion of these&nbsp;
exclusions.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comment 13: Riverside County Flood Control and Water Conservation&nbsp;
District stated that they are working with the City of Hemet to model&nbsp;
the watershed in Unit 33B. They suggested that the designation be&nbsp;
reduced or eliminated until the information is available.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Response: We have excluding Unit 33 from this final designation&nbsp;
of critical habitat for the 15 vernal pool species on the basis of the&nbsp;
development of the Western Riverside Multi-Species Habitat Conservation&nbsp;
Plan (see Response to Comment 12 above).

Issue 2--Costs and Regulatory Burden

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comment 14: Regarding the Fort Ord Unit of critical habitat for&nbsp;
Lasthenia conjugens, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) provides&nbsp;
comments about inclusion of two parcels, totaling less than 40 ac (16.2&nbsp;
ha), that are (or will be) transferred to the BLM and are designated&nbsp;
for development under the Army's existing base cleanup, disposal, and&nbsp;
reuse plan. The BLM expresses concern that inclusion of these parcels&nbsp;
may require numerous consultations with us for small BLM development&nbsp;
projects, such as the construction of a storage shed, that would have&nbsp;
minor or negligible impacts on the species and its critical habitat.&nbsp;
This would add an undue regulatory burden on BLM and the Service.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Response: All Federal agencies are required to evaluate whether&nbsp;
projects they authorize, fund, or carry out, may adversely affect a&nbsp;
federally listed species and/or its designated critical habitat. The&nbsp;
parcels under discussion do not possess ephemeral wetlands themselves,&nbsp;
but activities on them may affect the watershed of ephemeral wetlands&nbsp;
located on adjacent parcels. To improve the efficiency of the&nbsp;
consultation process, we recommend BLM staff with hydrologic expertise&nbsp;
evaluate the potential for BLM activities to affect the hydrology of&nbsp;
ephemeral wetlands in critical habitat. If BLM projects are not likely&nbsp;
to adversely affect critical habitat, then a consultation with us would&nbsp;
not be necessary. For projects that are likely to have only&nbsp;
discountable, insignificant, or wholly beneficial effects on critical&nbsp;
habitat, we would concur in writing and no further consultation will be&nbsp;
necessary. For projects likely to have adverse affects on critical&nbsp;
habitat, formal consultation would be required pursuant to section 7 of&nbsp;
the Act. We encourage BLM to pursue a programmatic evaluation of, and&nbsp;
consultation on, its current and future activities on former Fort Ord&nbsp;
lands. In regard to these specific parcels, we have

[[Page 46702]]

adjusted the boundaries of Unit 9 to remove the steep terrain in and&nbsp;
around Impossible and Wildcat Canyons, for reasons discussed in the&nbsp;
Summary of Changes From the Proposed Rule section. This has resulted in&nbsp;
the removal of one of the above-mentioned parcels from this critical&nbsp;
habitat designation. A 13 ac (5.3 ha) BLM development parcel remains in&nbsp;
critical habitat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comment 15: The Army requests that we exclude areas from Lasthenia&nbsp;
conjugens critical habitat within former Fort Ord (Unit 9) that are&nbsp;
designated for future development under the Army's Habitat Management&nbsp;
Plan (HMP). They state that their HMP, which describes the conservation&nbsp;
strategy for cleanup, disposal, and reuse of the former base, meets the&nbsp;
three criteria we use to consider whether a plan provides adequate&nbsp;
special management or protection. The Army suggests these areas be&nbsp;
excluded pursuant to section 3(5)(A) of the Act, because they do not&nbsp;
require additional special management or protection under the HMP. The&nbsp;
Army also requests that we exclude these areas, pursuant to section&nbsp;
4(b)(2) of the Act, because the benefits of excluding them outweigh the&nbsp;
benefits of including them in critical habitat. The specific parcels&nbsp;
they request be excluded are the BLM development parcel, the Military&nbsp;
Operations-Urban Terrain Facility, Wolf Hill, and those portions of&nbsp;
East Garrison identified for future development, a total of fewer than&nbsp;
200 ac (90 ha).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Response: The 28,000 (11,331 ha) former Army base at Fort Ord&nbsp;
is managed under an HMP that, along with several additional commitments&nbsp;
from the Army, provided the basis for a non-jeopardy biological opinion&nbsp;
in 1999 on the effects of base closure and reuse on Lasthenia&nbsp;
conjugens. This biological opinion encompassed the full base and,&nbsp;
therefore, the entire critical habitat unit. We determined at that time&nbsp;
that the configuration of habitat reserve and development lands in the&nbsp;
HMP will not jeopardize the continued existence of Lasthenia conjugens.&nbsp;
The HMP requires that management of designated development parcels that&nbsp;
border habitat reserve lands incorporate measures to avoid erosion and&nbsp;
vehicle access that could degrade habitat reserve lands, including&nbsp;
those designated as critical habitat for Lasthenia conjugens. However&nbsp;
we conclude that, at this time, the conservation strategy outlined in&nbsp;
the HMP for base reuse and closure does not provide sufficient&nbsp;
management and protections to the extent that these lands do not meet&nbsp;
the definition of critical habitat. Completion of the Comprehensive&nbsp;
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA)&nbsp;
process in which the Army is currently engaged, and completion of an&nbsp;
HCP by entities that are to receive transferred lands, followed by our&nbsp;
issuance of an incidental take permit for these lands, would likely be&nbsp;
considered adequate special management such that these lands could be&nbsp;
removed from critical habitat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have reviewed the circumstances at former Fort Ord and conclude&nbsp;
that exclusions under sections 3(5)(A) and 4(b)(2) of the Act are not&nbsp;
appropriate for lands in this unit. In past circumstances, we have&nbsp;
either not included or excluded lands from critical habitat, pursuant&nbsp;
to section 3(5)(A) of the Act, when we have determined that the lands&nbsp;
are either not essential to the conservation of the species, or have&nbsp;
adequate special management considerations or protections. If an area&nbsp;
has adequate management or protections for the species and its habitat&nbsp;
then the area does not meet the definition of critical habitat and&nbsp;
consequently either not included or excluded if originally proposed. At&nbsp;
former Fort Ord, the lands for which exclusions were requested are&nbsp;
designated for development under the base closure and reuse plan and&nbsp;
the management of these lands for vernal pool habitat and species is&nbsp;
not adequately addressed under the HMP. The lands are also not intended&nbsp;
to receive further protection under that plan. Therefore, a&nbsp;
definitional exclusion from critical habitat pursuant to section&nbsp;
3(5)(A) of the Act, where lands would not require special management&nbsp;
considerations or protections because those provisions are already in&nbsp;
place, would not be warranted for these lands.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also evaluated these parcels for exclusion from critical habitat&nbsp;
pursuant to section 4(b)(2) of the Act. Section 4(b)(2) of the Act&nbsp;
allows the Secretary to ``exclude any area from critical habitat if [it&nbsp;
is determined] that the benefits of such exclusion outweigh the&nbsp;
benefits of specifying such area as part of the critical habitat, * * *&nbsp;
unless the failure to designate such area * * * would result in the&nbsp;
extinction of the species.'' In evaluating whether the benefits of&nbsp;
excluding these lands outweigh the benefits of including them, we&nbsp;
considered economic impact and any other relevant impact associated&nbsp;
with their inclusion. In the case of former Fort Ord, we evaluated&nbsp;
whether an increase in Federal consultations was likely to occur due to&nbsp;
the inclusion of these lands, resulting in an economic cost. We&nbsp;
concluded that Federal consultation requirements would be essentially&nbsp;
unchanged by the inclusion of theselands. Therefore, none of the costs&nbsp;
associated with increased consultation requirements base-wide are&nbsp;
likely to result from inclusion of these lands. The Army did not&nbsp;
indicate any other costs associated with inclusion of these lands, nor&nbsp;
could we identify any. Therefore, we concluded there are no benefits of&nbsp;
excluding these lands from critical habitat. We weighed this against&nbsp;
any benefits that might accrue from inclusion of these lands in&nbsp;
critical habitat. We determined that a small benefit of inclusion would&nbsp;
be the increased attention the designation would bring to those parcels&nbsp;
designated for development that are adjacent to, and likely within the&nbsp;
watershed of, vernal pools. The inclusion of these lands in critical&nbsp;
habitat would remind land managers of the need to consider the presence&nbsp;
of the vernal pool watershed in planning and implementing Federal&nbsp;
actions. We weighed this benefit of inclusion against the benefits of&nbsp;
exclusion. We conclude that the benefits of exclusion do not outweigh&nbsp;
the benefits of inclusion. We have, therefore, included these lands in&nbsp;
the critical habitat designation, except as discussed below.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have adjusted the boundaries of the Fort Ord Unit to remove the&nbsp;
steep terrain in and around Impossible and Wildcat Canyons, for reasons&nbsp;
discussed in the Summary of Changes From the Proposed Rule section. The&nbsp;
Military Operations-Urban Terrain Facility and Wolf Hill parcels&nbsp;
(totaling about 110 ac (44.5 ha) discussed above are located in this&nbsp;
region and are therefore not part of designated critical habitat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comment 16: The U.S. Air Force requests that lands at Beale Air&nbsp;
Force Base (AFB) and Travis AFB be excluded because the designation&nbsp;
would increase the costs and regulatory requirements and hamper the Air&nbsp;
Force on carrying out the mission objectives for the two AFBs.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Response: In response to the U.S. Air Force's requests that&nbsp;
lands at Beale AFB and Travis AFB be excluded because the designation&nbsp;
would increase the costs and regulatory requirements and hamper the Air&nbsp;
Force's ability to carry out their mission objectives for the two AFBs,&nbsp;
we have excluded these AFB installations from final designated critical&nbsp;
habitat pursuant to section 4(b)(2) of the Act. Please refer to the&nbsp;
Relationship of Critical Habitat to Military Lands section of this&nbsp;
final rule for a detailed discussion of our rationale for excluding&nbsp;
these AFBs pursuant to section 4(b)(2) of the Act.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comment 17: Several commenters expressed concern that the&nbsp;
designation would curtail or eliminate livestock grazing in areas&nbsp;
containing vernal pools.

[[Page 46703]]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Response: Only those activities which are federally funded or&nbsp;
authorized that may affect critical habitat would be subject to the&nbsp;
regulations pertaining to critical habitat. We recognize and&nbsp;
acknowledge that certain levels of livestock grazing likely have no&nbsp;
impact on vernal pool ecosystems, and may be beneficial for maintaining&nbsp;
them. Since the vast majority of vernal pool habitat within the&nbsp;
designation is occupied by the listed vernal pool species and occurs on&nbsp;
privately owned lands, the designation of critical habitat is not&nbsp;
likely to result in a significant increase in regulatory requirements&nbsp;
above those already in place due to the presence of the listed species.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vernal pools and the species within this rule evolved with the&nbsp;
presence of large ungulate grazing. Grazing deters the encroachment of&nbsp;
grass and other upland species into the vernal pools, and reduces the&nbsp;
vegetative cover of upland areas potentially allowing space for soil&nbsp;
dwelling pollinator species to exist. However, the amount and timing of&nbsp;
grazing can greatly influence species abundance and composition within&nbsp;
each vernal pool.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comment 18: California Army National Guard-Camp Roberts and Fort&nbsp;
Hunter Liggett provide analyses that describe anticipated economic&nbsp;
impacts that would arise on the military bases and in surrounding&nbsp;
communities if critical habitat is designated for vernal pool fairy&nbsp;
shrimp on their property. Camp Roberts estimates the impacts from&nbsp;
critical habitat to be approximately $95.4 million (ARNG 2002b). The&nbsp;
majority of these costs would accrue because the military believes a&nbsp;
critical habitat designation would create a need to relocate training&nbsp;
activities to other military bases where critical habitat is not&nbsp;
designated. They also believe 31 projects may need to be canceled or&nbsp;
substantially modified during the next 20 years. The letter from Camp&nbsp;
Roberts also states that local communities around the base would also&nbsp;
be affected by critical habitat designation, and the potential effects&nbsp;
to these communities are estimated to be $50.5 million.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Staff at Fort Hunter Liggett believe the cost of designating&nbsp;
critical habitat on their base would be approximately $7.35 million&nbsp;
over a 10-year period (FHL 2002b). The Army believes a $5 million cost&nbsp;
would be incurred because of changes to a prescribed fire program.&nbsp;
Additional costs may be incurred because Fort Hunter Liggett staff&nbsp;
estimate they will need to complete 36 informal and 16 formal&nbsp;
consultations during the next 20 years as a result of the critical&nbsp;
habitat designation. The letter also states that the Army believes our&nbsp;
cost estimates associated with the critical habitat designation, as&nbsp;
described in the economic analysis, are too low.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Response: California Army National Guard-Camp Roberts and Fort&nbsp;
Hunter Liggett provide analyses that describe anticipated economic&nbsp;
impacts that would arise on the military bases and in surrounding&nbsp;
communities if critical habitat is designated for vernal pool fairy&nbsp;
shrimp on their property. Camp Roberts estimates the impacts from&nbsp;

cost estimates associated with the critical habitat designation, as&nbsp;
described in the economic analysis, are too low.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comment 19: A planner from the City of El Paso Robles asks that we&nbsp;
describe what effect critical habitat designation has on new&nbsp;
development projects. The letter suggests critical habitat designation&nbsp;
results in the need to set aside vernal pools as ecological preserves.&nbsp;
A facsimile transmittal from a small farming company also asks that we&nbsp;
describe how critical habitat designation could affect their farming&nbsp;
operations.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Response: The designation of critical habitat requires that&nbsp;
Federal agencies consult with us on actions they carry out, fund, or&nbsp;
authorize that might destroy or adversely modify the critical habitat.&nbsp;
A critical habitat designation has no effect on actions where a Federal&nbsp;
agency is not involved (Federal nexus). For example, a landowner&nbsp;
undertaking a lawful project on private land that involves no Federal&nbsp;
funding or Federal permits would not be affected by the critical&nbsp;
habitat designation. If a Federal nexus did develop on private land&nbsp;
that was included in a critical habitat unit, e.g., a private landowner&nbsp;
needed a permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) for fill&nbsp;
to be placed in a wetland, the project would need to undergo a review&nbsp;
process with the Service.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the Act, a critical habitat designation establishes a&nbsp;
geographic area that is essential for the conservation of threatened or&nbsp;
endangered species and may require special management considerations or&nbsp;
protections. However, a designation does not affect the land ownership&nbsp;
or establish a refuge, wilderness, reserve, preserve, or other special&nbsp;
conservation area. It does not allow government or public access to&nbsp;
private land, and will not result in the closure of the area to all&nbsp;
access or use. Rather, it triggers the requirement that Federal&nbsp;
agencies must consult with us on activities they fund or carry out that&nbsp;
might affect critical habitat. Please refer to the Effects of Critical&nbsp;
Habitat section below for further explanation of effects of critical&nbsp;
habitat designation and its effects on development and farming&nbsp;
operations.

Issue 3--Notification and Public Comment

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comment 20: A number of commenters stated that landowners were&nbsp;
either not notified, or not notified in a timely manner, and given an&nbsp;
adequate opportunity to comment on the proposed designation. The&nbsp;
commenters also stated that the number of public hearings was&nbsp;
inadequate to obtain full public input on the proposal and that&nbsp;
additional public hearings should be held. Several commenters stated&nbsp;
that the 30-day comment period for the DEA violated 50 CFR 424.16(c)(2)&nbsp;
and requested that we extend the comment period on the proposed&nbsp;
designation and draft economic analysis to allow for additional&nbsp;
outreach to interested parties as well as hold more public hearings.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Response: We are obligated to hold at least one public hearing&nbsp;
on a listing proposal if requested to do so prior to 15 days before the&nbsp;
end of a comment period (16 U.S.C. 1533(b)(5)(E)). We held a total of 6&nbsp;
public hearing on our proposal to designate critical habitat for the 15&nbsp;
vernal pool species: two public hearings on October 22, 2002, in San&nbsp;
Luis Obispo, California; two in Medford, Oregon, on October 24, 2002;&nbsp;
and two on October 24, 2002, in Sacramento, California. We also&nbsp;
organized three public workshops to notify the public of

[[Page 46704]]

the proposed designation and to answer questions regarding critical&nbsp;
habitat and the proposed rule: October 3, 2002, in Chico, California;&nbsp;
October 16, 2002, in Fresno, California; and October 17, 2002,&nbsp;
Sacramento, California. In addition to the public hearings and public&nbsp;
workshops, we attended a public meeting organized by the Merced County&nbsp;
Council in Merced, California on November 12, 2002, to discuss the&nbsp;
proposed designation of critical habitat and answer questions regarding&nbsp;
the area designated within Merced County. We provided information on&nbsp;
where to obtain copies of the proposed rule and how to access the&nbsp;
critical habitat website showing maps of the designation.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Written public comments were accepted at all the public hearings,&nbsp;
workshops, and the Merced County Council meeting and entered into the&nbsp;
supporting record for the rulemaking. Oral comments given at the public&nbsp;
hearings were also accepted into the supporting record. In making our&nbsp;
decision on the critical habitat designation, written comments were&nbsp;
given the same weight as oral comments presented at hearings. We&nbsp;
conducted much of our outreach through legal notices in numerous&nbsp;
regional newspapers, telephone calls, letters, and news releases faxed&nbsp;
and/or mailed to affected officials, local jurisdictions, and interest&nbsp;
groups. We also posted the proposed determination, schedule of&nbsp;
workshops and hearings, and other associated material on our Sacramento&nbsp;
Fish and Wildlife Office internet site. We believe that we went through&nbsp;
an elaborate and extensive notification and outreach process to make&nbsp;
the public aware of this proposal. Further, our efforts in this process&nbsp;
satisfied the requirements of the Act and the Administrative Procedures&nbsp;
Act (5 U.S.C. 551 et seq.) (APA) for promulgating Federal regulations&nbsp;
regarding listing actions.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comment 21: The broad scale of the proposed critical habitat maps&nbsp;
are not specific enough to allow for reasonable public comment,&nbsp;
therefore, violating the Act, the APA, and 50 CFR 424.12(c).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Response: Regulation 50 CFR 424.12(c) requires us to define&nbsp;
critical habitat according to ``specific limits using reference points&nbsp;
and lines as found on standard topographic maps of the area.'' We have&nbsp;
done this by basing critical habitat legal descriptions on Universal&nbsp;
Transverse Mercator (UTM) gridlines set every 328 feet (ft) (100 meters&nbsp;
(m)). In addition to the legal descriptions, we also published maps&nbsp;
providing an overview of the critical habitat boundaries in the&nbsp;
proposed rule. While the Federal Register maps are only intended for&nbsp;
illustrative purposes, we do provide more detailed critical habitat&nbsp;
maps on request. These detailed maps show specific critical habitat&nbsp;
areas of interest overlaid on 1:24,000 scale U.S. Geological Survey&nbsp;
(USGS) topographic maps. Additionally, we developed an interactive&nbsp;
internet site which shows vernal pool critical habitat boundaries&nbsp;
overlaid on a 1:250,000 scale USGS topographic maps. The site allows&nbsp;
users to pan to and magnify any area of interest. The Internet site was&nbsp;
not completed by the September 24, 2002, publication date of the&nbsp;
proposed rule, but we did direct interested parties who contacted us to&nbsp;
the site when it became available on October 10, 2002, and posted&nbsp;
information and a link to the internet site from our Sacramento Fish&nbsp;
and Wildlife Office Internet site.

Issue 4--Property Rights

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comment 22: Several commenters stated that the designation will&nbsp;
result in a loss of public property rights and will decrease land&nbsp;
values.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Response: The designation of critical habitat does not affect&nbsp;
land ownership or establish a refuge, preserve, or other special&nbsp;
conservation area. It does not allow government or public access to&nbsp;
private lands, and will not result in closure of private or State areas&nbsp;
to all access or use. The designation of critical habitat on privately-
owned land does not mean the government wants to acquire or control the&nbsp;
land. Critical habitat does not require landowners to carry out any&nbsp;
special management actions or restrict the use of their land.&nbsp;
Activities on private lands that do not require Federal permits,&nbsp;
funding, or authorization are not affected by the designation of&nbsp;
critical habitat. Consequently, critical habitat should not result in&nbsp;
effects to property rights, and as previously discussed, property&nbsp;
values.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comment 23: Several commenters expressed concern that the proposed&nbsp;
rule and subsequent designation will have significant takings&nbsp;
implications, and that the designation is a ``land grab'' by the&nbsp;
Federal government and that the landowners should be compensated.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Response: As we discussed in the Takings section of our&nbsp;
proposed rule, we believe that, in accordance with Executive Order&nbsp;
12630, the designation of critical habitat for the 15 vernal pool&nbsp;
species will not have significant takings implications. Our conclusion&nbsp;
was based on the results of an initial takings implication assessment&nbsp;
in which we determined that: (1) The designation would result in little&nbsp;
additional regulatory burden above that currently in place due to the&nbsp;
15 vernal pool species being federally listed because the majority of&nbsp;
the designation is occupied by the species, and (2) the designation of&nbsp;
critical habitat will not affect private lands in which there is not a&nbsp;
Federal nexus. Consequently, we do not anticipate that property values,&nbsp;
rights or ownership will be significantly affected by the critical&nbsp;
habitat designation.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comment 24: Several commenters expressed confusion regarding the&nbsp;
types of agricultural activities and land use practices that, as a&nbsp;
result of the designation, would may trigger a consultation under&nbsp;
section 7 of the Act. Other commenters stated that the government will&nbsp;
now oversee agricultural and ranching practices as a result of the&nbsp;
Borden Ranch case (Borden Ranch Partnership v U.S. Army Corps of&nbsp;
Engineers (9th Cir. 2001) 261F.3d 810,816.).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Response: Activities carried out, funded, authorized or&nbsp;
permitted by a Federal agency (i.e., Federal nexus) require&nbsp;
consultation pursuant to section 7 of the Act if they may affect a&nbsp;
federally listed species and/or its designated critical habitat. Our&nbsp;
experience with consultations on the 15 listed vernal pool species is&nbsp;
that few agricultural activities have involved a Federal nexus and have&nbsp;
not required a consultation under section 7 of the Act. The Borden&nbsp;
Ranch legal case, referenced above, involved the Clean Water Act and&nbsp;
unauthorized fill of wetlands. Specifically, the activity that took&nbsp;
place was not considered a routine agricultural practice, and thereby&nbsp;
subject to regulation by the Army Corps of Engineers under the Clean&nbsp;
Water Act. In regard to grazing, we do not foresee any change in the&nbsp;
ability of private landowners to graze their property as a result of&nbsp;
this designation. In addition, we anticipate that many activities,&nbsp;
including grazing, presently occurring in areas designated as critical&nbsp;
habitat can be managed to be compatible with the needs of vernal pool&nbsp;
species and their habitat.

Issue 5--Mapping Methodology

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comment 25: Several commenters noted that the proposed critical&nbsp;
habitat includes areas that do not contain the PCEs for the vernal pool&nbsp;
crustaceans and vernal pool plants. This resulted in the following&nbsp;
concerns: (a) That the boundaries of critical habitat should have been&nbsp;
more precisely defined to exclude areas which obviously did not contain&nbsp;
PCEs; (b) that private property would be affected by the designation&nbsp;
even though it did not support the federally listed vernal pool species&nbsp;
or

[[Page 46705]]

their PCEs; (c) that the designation would place a burden on landowners&nbsp;
to refute the presumption that specific lands within critical habitat&nbsp;
boundaries possess the PCEs of the species; (d) that we had incorrectly&nbsp;
stated in the proposed rule that we would only designate areas&nbsp;
containing the PCEs of the species; (e) that there was no biological&nbsp;
justification for using a landscape-scale approach when more detailed&nbsp;
information is available; and (f) that the designation, as proposed,&nbsp;
was not in keeping with the requirement of the Act to ``narrowly define&nbsp;
critical habitat.''
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Response: As we have discussed in our response to Comment 21,&nbsp;
we are required to define and delimit critical habitat ``by specific&nbsp;
limits using reference points and lines as found on standard&nbsp;
topographic maps of the area'' (50 CFR 424.12(c)). We have delimited&nbsp;
the boundaries of critical habitat boundaries in this rule based on a&nbsp;
minimum mapping scale of 100 meters. This mapping scale was based on&nbsp;
the availability and accuracy of aerial photography and GIS data layers&nbsp;
used to develop the designation. In drawing our lines for the proposed&nbsp;
rule, we attempt to exclude areas that do not contain essential&nbsp;
occurrences of the vernal pool species and habitat as defined by the&nbsp;
PCEs. On the basis of information obtained through public comments and&nbsp;
updated imagery and GIS data layers, we have been able to refine the&nbsp;
boundaries of critical habitat during the development of this final&nbsp;
rule. However, due to the limitations of our mapping scale, we were not&nbsp;
able to exclude all areas that do not contain the PCEs. We have&nbsp;
determined that existing man-made features and structures, such as&nbsp;
buildings, roads, railroads, airports, runways, other paved areas,&nbsp;
lawns, and other urban landscaped areas are not likely to contain one&nbsp;
or more of the PCEs. Because activities in these areas are unlikely to&nbsp;
affect PCEs (i.e., essential habitat for the vernal pool species), a&nbsp;
consultation under section 7 of the Act would not be required.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We disagree with the comment that private property will be&nbsp;
adversely affected by the designation. Without any PCEs or presence of&nbsp;
listed species, we regard that no adverse effects to private landowners&nbsp;
will occur. If private landowners suspect or have listed vernal pool&nbsp;
species and PCEs on their lands, those landowners may or may not chose&nbsp;
to ascertain any biological information absent any fill of vernal pools&nbsp;
that would require some consultation with us. We also disagree with the&nbsp;
comment about our approach in designating critical habitat when&nbsp;
additional detailed information is available. We used the best&nbsp;
scientific and commercial information available to us. We opened two&nbsp;
comment periods to obtain as much current information that is available&nbsp;
to assist us in developing this final rule.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comment 26: A number of commenters identified specific areas that&nbsp;
they thought should not be designated as critical habitat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Response: Where site-specific documentation was submitted to us&nbsp;
providing a rationale as to why an area should not be designated&nbsp;
critical habitat, we evaluated that information in accordance with the&nbsp;
definition of critical habitat pursuant to section 3 (5)(A) of the Act&nbsp;
and the provisions of section 4(b)(2) of the Act. Following our&nbsp;
evaluation of the parcels we made a determination as to whether&nbsp;
modifications to the proposal were warranted. In the preparation of the&nbsp;
final rule, we further examined the area proposed and refined the&nbsp;
critical habitat boundaries to exclude, where possible within the&nbsp;
limitations of our minimum mapping scale, those areas that did not, or&nbsp;
were not likely to, contain the PCEs for the 15 vernal pool species. We&nbsp;
also excluded lands from the final designation that may contain vernal&nbsp;
pool habitat, the vernal pool species, and the PCEs, but that we&nbsp;
determined to not be essential to the conservation of the vernal pool&nbsp;
crustaceans and vernal pool plants. Please refer to the Summary of&nbsp;
Changes from the Proposed Rule section of this final rule for a more&nbsp;
detailed discussion of changes and exclusion from the proposed rule.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comment 27: Several commenters had specific concerns relating to&nbsp;
the upland component of the PCEs. One commenter indicated that the&nbsp;
upland component was not well defined and would result in additional&nbsp;
costs and regulatory burdens.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Response: Upland areas adjacent to vernal pools are function as&nbsp;
part of the localized watershed and are essential to maintaining the&nbsp;
hydrological and ecological processes essential to the conservation of&nbsp;
the listed vernal pool species. Upland areas buffer the effects of&nbsp;
varying rainfall patterns and establish patterns of overland and&nbsp;
groundwater flow which help determine the timing and duration of&nbsp;
ponding and drying. Listed vernal pool species depend on intermittent&nbsp;
periods of ponding and drying to prevent the establishment of strictly&nbsp;
terrestrial or aquatic competitors. The timing and duration of such&nbsp;
ponding and drying periods affects seed germination, and production of&nbsp;
vernal pool plants, as well as the hatching and growth of vernal pool&nbsp;
crustaceans. Upland areas also provide a major source of food, in the&nbsp;
form of detritus, for vernal pool crustaceans; support pollinator&nbsp;
populations for vernal pool plants; improve pond water quality by&nbsp;
filtering sediment and contaminants; and moderate pond water&nbsp;
temperature (see Background and Primary Constituent Elements sections).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We determined the extent of essential upland areas using the best&nbsp;
available data, as required by the Act. Such data include topological&nbsp;
and land use features useful for identifying natural watershed&nbsp;
boundaries, (as shown by USGS Digital Orthorectified Quarter&nbsp;
Quadrangles (DOQQs) and other aerial photography), information provided&nbsp;
during the comment period, watershed boundaries identified in CALWATER&nbsp;
(CALWATER 2.2), and information on the ecology and life history of the&nbsp;
15 vernal pool species (see Background section).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comment 28: Several commenters suggested that the area being&nbsp;
proposed as critical habitat for the vernal pool crustaceans and vernal&nbsp;
pool plants represents the entire range of all the species, and that&nbsp;
this broad of a designation is in violation of the Act. Other&nbsp;
commenters stated that we have failed to provide adequate justification&nbsp;
for why we determined that all areas proposed as critical habitat for&nbsp;
the 15 vernal pool species are essential to their conservation.&nbsp;
Further, it was also suggested that there was a lack of species&nbsp;
occurrence information for the proposed, bring into question our&nbsp;
justification for including these areas into our designation.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Response: In developing our proposal of critical habitat for&nbsp;
the 15 vernal pool species, we identified those areas that, based on&nbsp;
the scientific and commercial data available, we have determined&nbsp;
contain essential occurrences of each of the species and/or are defined&nbsp;
by the physical and biological features essential to their&nbsp;
conservation. We used a number of criteria in defining critical habitat&nbsp;
including, but not limited to, the known species occurrence and&nbsp;
distribution data, habitat types, degree of habitat fragmentation, soil&nbsp;
and landform relationships, connectivity and dispersal factors, and&nbsp;
conservation biology principles. We did not include all vernal pool&nbsp;
landscapes within each species' range even though surveys in these area&nbsp;
may result in the detection of other occurrences. In developing the&nbsp;
final rule, all the critical habitat units were reviewed and, where&nbsp;
appropriate, further refined to ensure that nonessential habitat and&nbsp;
areas not

[[Page 46706]]

containing the PCEs (where identifiable) were excluded from the final&nbsp;
designation.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We recognize that not all specific areas designated as critical&nbsp;
habitat are occupied by the vernal pool species addressed in this rule,&nbsp;
in that we included portions of localized upland watershed areas that&nbsp;
we have determined to be essential to the conservation of the vernal&nbsp;
pool species and their habitat. However, these upland areas are within&nbsp;
the geographic range occupied by each of the respective species&nbsp;
resulting in our designation being in compliance with section 3(5)(A)&nbsp;
of the Act.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comment 29: One commentor believes that habitat monitoring results&nbsp;
from Camp Roberts can be used to understand the effects of land use&nbsp;
activities on other areas outside the military base.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Response: Following a review of the reports related to the&nbsp;
habitat monitoring at Camp Roberts, we believe that the reports provide&nbsp;
limited insight into the effects of land use activities off the base&nbsp;
because the activities discussed in the reports are predominantly&nbsp;
military specific such as the use of large, tracked military vehicles.&nbsp;
Other studies addressed in the reports examine effects associated with&nbsp;
grazing activities may have relevance to areas outside the base&nbsp;
boundary. Results from these studies have been taken into consideration&nbsp;
in the development of this designation.

Issue 6--Economic Analysis

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comment 30: Several commenters stated that the economic analysis&nbsp;
fails to recognize other Federal funding (e.g., farming subsidies)&nbsp;
which may provide nexuses and therefore, resulting in the need for&nbsp;
additional consultations triggered solely by the designation.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Response: The economic analysis focuses on the principle&nbsp;
economic areas that could be potentially effected by the designation of&nbsp;
critical habitat. In the preface of the economic analysis, we made an&nbsp;
attempt to forecast the effects of future section 7 formal&nbsp;
consultations resulting from the proposed designation of critical&nbsp;
habitat. The 20-year future forecast was based on the history of formal&nbsp;
consultation with Federal agencies occurring to date. Historically, we&nbsp;
have had no consultations regarding vernal pool complexes, farming&nbsp;
activities, and any nexus with the Farm Service Agency. However, if the&nbsp;
Farm Service Agency were to fund, authorize, permit, or conduct&nbsp;
activities that may adversely effect designated critical habitat, then&nbsp;
they are required to consult with us pursuant to section 7 of the Act&nbsp;
on those activities.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comment 31: Several commenters stated that the economic analysis&nbsp;
neglects to consider all impacts potentially resulting from the&nbsp;
designation of critical habitat for the 15 vernal pool species.&nbsp;
Specifically, commenters expressed concern that the economic analysis:&nbsp;
(1) Minimizes potential impacts and costs that may result from the&nbsp;
designation; (2) is based on unreasonable assumptions that are&nbsp;
incomplete and outdated; (3) fails to analyze impacts on federally&nbsp;
authorized water activities; and (4) understated the economic impact to&nbsp;
the agricultural industry and ranching operations, and focused on urban&nbsp;
effects to local economies and not that of the agricultural.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Response: In developing the draft economic analysis of the&nbsp;
proposed designation, we attempted to provide the best analysis of the&nbsp;
measured differences between the world with and without the designation&nbsp;
of critical habitat for the 15 vernal pool species. Impacts considered&nbsp;
in the analysis include costs associated with section 7 consultations&nbsp;
for reasonably foreseeable activities, such as real estate development,&nbsp;
highway construction and maintenance, and the supply and delivery of&nbsp;
water. Data to predict reasonably foreseeable activities were obtained&nbsp;
from proposed plans currently available to the public, discussions with&nbsp;
staff at Federal and State agencies, and local governmental&nbsp;
jurisdictions, and urban growth projections such as the California&nbsp;
Urban Biodiversity Assessment (CURBA) model. Estimated costs associated&nbsp;
with section 7 consultations are composed of both administrative costs&nbsp;
and project modification costs. Indirect costs were also considered in&nbsp;
the economic analysis, including costs associated with the delay of&nbsp;
planned real estate development to address critical habitat issues as&nbsp;
well as property value effects associated with regulatory uncertainty.&nbsp;
The final economic analysis considered many of the comments submitted&nbsp;
by the public and accordingly made several changes to the estimates of&nbsp;
the above impacts. In addition, the final economic analysis also&nbsp;
included a new component of potential economic impact--losses in&nbsp;
consumer surplus that may be associated with a foreseeable reduction in&nbsp;
the number of new homes built because of the designation. We disagree&nbsp;
with the viewpoint that the economic analysis focuses on urban effects&nbsp;
and not agriculture or rural effects. All effects were considered,&nbsp;
however the greatest economic impact is likely to occur in those areas&nbsp;
where land is constrained and less substitute land is available for&nbsp;
economic activities that otherwise would destroy vernal pool habitat&nbsp;
but for the designation of critical habitat. This assessment was based&nbsp;
upon: (1) The history of formal consultations under section 7 of the&nbsp;
Act, to date, on locations and activities that resulted in affects to&nbsp;
vernal pool species and their habitat; and (2) because the majority of&nbsp;
vernal pool habitat losses expected to occur within 20 years are&nbsp;
anticipated to occur as a result land conversions from agricultural or&nbsp;
rural to urban as the local economies develop and bid up the value land&nbsp;
based on its best use.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comment 32: Several commenters stated that the economic analysis&nbsp;
does not assess impacts on proposed or permitted HCP/NCCPs.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Response: The economic analysis does not address the effects of&nbsp;
designation of critical habitat on any permitted HCP, NCCP/HCP or&nbsp;
proposed HCPs or NCCP/HCPs. We believe the designation of critical&nbsp;
habitat for the 15 vernal pool species will not result in significant&nbsp;
additional regulatory impacts to any currently permitted HCPs or NCCP/
HCPs having covered federally listed vernal pool species. Those plans&nbsp;
have sufficient biological conservation for covered vernal species and&nbsp;
their aquatic and associated upland habitats to avoid adverse&nbsp;
modification of critical habitat. Additionally, we believe that the&nbsp;
proposed HCPs and NCCP/HCPs that cover vernal pool species also provide&nbsp;
sufficient biological conservation of vernal pool species and their&nbsp;
habitats to support the long-term vernal pool species conservation.&nbsp;
Please refer to our discussion of HCPs under Relationship of Critical&nbsp;
Habitat to Habitat Conservation Plans later in this rule.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comment 33: Several commenters stated that the economic analysis&nbsp;
does not assess cost of removal of critical habitat through future rule&nbsp;
makings.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Response: The scope of our economic analysis to is to&nbsp;
reasonably assess the potential cost that may result from the proposed&nbsp;
designation so as to provide the Secretary information to be used in&nbsp;
the development of this final agency action. We do not take into&nbsp;
consideration any potential costs that may occur from future&nbsp;
modification or revisions to this designation. Those potential costs,&nbsp;
if the designation were to be revised, are not in the scope of this&nbsp;
analysis and would be addressed at the time of the rulemaking for those&nbsp;
revisions.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comment 34: Several commenters stated that the economic analysis&nbsp;
does not assess the costs to project

[[Page 46707]]

proponents who want to conduct activities on their lands that do not&nbsp;
contain the PCEs.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Response: As indicated in this rule, we attempted to exclude&nbsp;
lands from the final designation that do not contain the PCEs essential&nbsp;
to the conservation of the 15 vernal pool species. Activities, for&nbsp;
which there is not a Federal nexus, occurring on lands with the&nbsp;
boundaries of designated critical habitat that do not effect the&nbsp;
species and/or their PCEs would not result in a consultation pursuant&nbsp;
to section 7 of the Act. Consequently, we would not anticipate that the&nbsp;
designation of critical habitat in these areas would result in an&nbsp;
increased regulatory burden or cost to the project proponent. In areas&nbsp;
where a Federal nexus does not exist, these is not regulatory burden of&nbsp;
critical habitat. As such, we would not anticipate that activities in&nbsp;
these areas would result in a significant additional regulatory burden&nbsp;
resulting from the designation.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comment 35: Some landowners expressed concern that because their&nbsp;
property was located within the proposed critical habitat designation&nbsp;
they would be subject to additional constraints, costs and regulations&nbsp;
under CEQA and NEPA. The commenters further expressed that the draft&nbsp;
economic analysis inaccurately characterized impact that would result&nbsp;
from both CEQA and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)&nbsp;
following the designation of critical habitat for the 15 vernal pool&nbsp;
species.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Response: According to section 15065 (California Code of&nbsp;
Regulations Title 14, Chapter 3) of CEQA guidelines, environmental&nbsp;
impact reports are required by local lead agencies when, among other&nbsp;
things, a project has the potential to ``reduce the number or restrict&nbsp;
the range of an endangered, rare or threatened species.'' Because nine&nbsp;
of the 11 vernal pool plants are either State listed endangered or&nbsp;
threatened, and federally listed species are presumed to meet the CEQA&nbsp;
definition of ``endangered, rare or threatened species'' under 15380&nbsp;
(California Code of Regulations Title 14, Chapter 3), no significant&nbsp;
additional constraints, or costs, should result from the designation of&nbsp;
critical habitat beyond those now in place for all federally listed&nbsp;
species, including the 15 vernal pool species in this rule.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We believe that we made the best 20-year estimation of what the&nbsp;
added costs would be from impacts of the designation of critical&nbsp;
habitat for the 15 vernal pool species. Under both the environmental&nbsp;
review processes of CEQA and NEPA, a project proponent is required to&nbsp;
identify biological resources or conduct an environmental assessment,&nbsp;
including any designated critical habitat on proposed project sites,&nbsp;
and identify any significant environmental effects to those resources&nbsp;
that could result from the project. The processes also need to be&nbsp;
disclosed and have opportunities for public comments. We believe that&nbsp;
the economic analysis accurately assesses the impacts to State and&nbsp;
Federal regulatory processes.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comment 36: One commenter stated that, contrary to our assumption&nbsp;
in the draft economic analysis, the Los Angeles District Office of the&nbsp;
Corps may take regulatory jurisdiction over vernal pools that occur&nbsp;
within their geographic jurisdication.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Response: The economic analysis made the assumption that the&nbsp;
Los Angeles District may not take jurisdiction of the vernal pools that&nbsp;
are in critical habitat for the vernal pools within their watershed-
based jurisdiction based on conversations with the representatives from&nbsp;
the Los Angeles District Office of the Corps. We believe that the Corps&nbsp;
has the discretion of whether or not to take jurisdiction of any waters&nbsp;
of the United States. The consequences of this discretion may increase&nbsp;
or decrease the number of formal consultations and associated costs&nbsp;
that may occur over the next 20 years. We made the best estimate of the&nbsp;
number of formal consultations and their associated costs that we may&nbsp;
have over the next 20 years based upon our history of formal&nbsp;
consultations with the Corps across the range of the 15 vernal pool&nbsp;
species.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comment 37: Several commenters stated that the economic analysis&nbsp;
should be completed and made available concurrently with the proposal&nbsp;
to designate critical habitat, and that critical habitat should not&nbsp;
have been proposed before an economic analysis of the proposal was&nbsp;
complete.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Response: Pursuant to Act and clarified in our implementing&nbsp;
regulations at 50 CFR 424.19, we are required to, ``after proposing&nbsp;
designation of such an area, consider the probable economic and other&nbsp;
impacts of the designation upon proposed or ongoing activities.''&nbsp;
Following the publication of our prosed designation of critical habitat&nbsp;
for the 15 vernal pool species, we developed a draft economic analysis&nbsp;
of the proposed designation that was released for public review and&nbsp;
comment. The analysis was subsequently revised based on public comment&nbsp;
and other information made available to us and a final economic&nbsp;
analysis was produced. This final analysis was used to assist us in&nbsp;
developing the final designation. Consequently, we believe that we have&nbsp;
interpreted the regulations and process correctly. Please refer to the&nbsp;
draft and final economic analyses for this rulemaking for more detailed&nbsp;
discussions of the methods employed in the analysis and the results.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comment 38: Several commenters stated that the economic analysis&nbsp;
estimates far too few section 7 consultations under the Act.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Response: After using our historical database of section 7&nbsp;
consultations, and speaking with numerous Federal agencies about the&nbsp;
likelihood of future consultations after critical habitat is&nbsp;
designated, we believe that we correctly and reasonably estimated the&nbsp;
number of section 7 consultations that would occur despite the lack of&nbsp;
certainties about 20-year growth models used to predict urban growth,&nbsp;
multiple uses of open space that includes vernal pool preservation&nbsp;
areas, the lack of a fixed amount of upland habitat associated with&nbsp;
vernal pool complexes, and the locally variable values of non-
residential lands.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comment 39: Several commenters stated that the CURBA model&nbsp;
underestimates the growth and costs associated with the impacts of&nbsp;
critical habitat designation for the 15 vernal pool species.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Response: We used the CURBA model, along with information from&nbsp;
interviews with representatives of Federal agencies, county and local&nbsp;
government planning officials, information we had on the number of&nbsp;
completed formal consultations, and those consultations that were&nbsp;
initiated but not completed, to improve our attempt to correctly&nbsp;
estimate the number and costs of formal consultations within the next&nbsp;
20 years. Based upon additional discussions with these representatives&nbsp;
from the above-mentioned entities, we have revised upward the number of&nbsp;
informal consultations from 240 to 470, and decreased the number of&nbsp;
formal consultations from 235 to 157. Because, the pace of development&nbsp;
in any region fluctuates broadly from year to year due to the&nbsp;
unevenness in market timing and planning practices, the CURBA model&nbsp;
offers a more standard method of forecasting the acreage required to&nbsp;
accommodate new growth throughout the proposed critical habitat area.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comment 40: Several commenters stated that the economic analysis&nbsp;
should focus on the potential costs attributable solely to critical&nbsp;
habitat and not on the costs associated with the listing of the&nbsp;
species.

[[Page 46708]]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Response: In developing our draft economic analysis, we&nbsp;
attempted to differentiate between the costs attributed to the proposed&nbsp;
designation of critical habitat from those attributable to the species&nbsp;
being federally listed. These impacts are presented and discussed in&nbsp;
our draft economic analysis and the final economic analysis. However,&nbsp;
as discussed below in response to Comment 41, the methodology of our&nbsp;
economic analysis is consistent with the 10th Circuit Court's&nbsp;
instructions to make our economic analyses of critical habitat&nbsp;
meaningful, which in the Court's mind, requires the economic analysis&nbsp;
to consider all of the potential costs associated with the designation&nbsp;
of critical habitat, regardless of whether or not those costs are co-
extensive with other parts of the Act. As a result, our economic&nbsp;
analysis now also consider the total costs associated with section 7 of&nbsp;
the Act. Please refer to our draft and final economic analyses for a&nbsp;
more thorough discussion of the methodology employed in the our&nbsp;
analysis.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comment 41: The economic analysis not done in a manner consistent&nbsp;
with the New Mexico Cattle Growers Association v. U.S. Fish and&nbsp;
Wildlife Service, 248 F. 3d 1277 (10th Cir. 2001) decision.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Response: In this 10th Circuit Court case, the court instructed&nbsp;
us to conduct a full analysis of all the economic impacts of critical&nbsp;
habitat designation, regardless of whether or not those impacts are&nbsp;
attributable co-extensively to other causes. In order to ensure that no&nbsp;
costs of the proposed designation are omitted, the economic analysis&nbsp;
for the 15 vernal pool species examined and fully considered all&nbsp;
potential effects associated with all section 7 consultation effects in&nbsp;
or near proposed critical habitat. In doing so, the economic analysis&nbsp;
ensures that any critical habitat impacts that are co-extensive with&nbsp;
the listing of the species are not overlooked. As a result of this&nbsp;
approach, the economic analysis may likely overstate the regulatory&nbsp;
effects under section 7 of the Act that are attributable to the&nbsp;
proposed designation of critical habitat. Therefore, we believe that&nbsp;
our analysis has been done in compliance with the Court's decision.&nbsp;
Please refer to the draft and final economic analyses for a more&nbsp;
detailed discussion of this issue.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comment 42: Several commenters stated that the assumptions in the&nbsp;
DEA suggesting that the designation of critical habitat for the 15&nbsp;
vernal pool species is not expected to result in significant&nbsp;
restrictions in addition to those currently in place due to the species&nbsp;
already being federally listed are flawed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Response: In the proposed rule and DEA, we indicated that we do&nbsp;
not expect that the designation of critical habitat would result in&nbsp;
significant additional regulatory or economic burdens or restrictions&nbsp;
incremental to those afforded the species pursuant to being listed&nbsp;
under the Act. This assertion is based on the regulatory protections&nbsp;
afforded the 15 vernal pool species from them being federally listed&nbsp;
under the Act, and the fact that the majority of the lands designated&nbsp;
as critical habitat are considered occupied by the species.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comment 43: One commenter stated that the DEA failed to adequately&nbsp;
consider the effect the proposed rule could have on the development&nbsp;
community.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Response: The DEA discussed the potential impact the proposed&nbsp;
rule could have on the development community. Specifically, the&nbsp;
analysis discussed how the proposal would not impose any significant&nbsp;
additional economic impacts beyond those currently in existence for&nbsp;
occupied areas of critical habitat. We acknowledged that critical&nbsp;
habitat designation could have slight effects on certain industries&nbsp;
such as real estate development, farming, and ranching. But the biggest&nbsp;
effects to these industries result from the impact their activities&nbsp;
have on the vernal pool crustaceans, which are afforded protection due&nbsp;
to their status as federally protected threatened or endangered&nbsp;
species. Because the majority of critical habitat units are currently&nbsp;
occupied by the vernal pool crustaceans or vernal pool plants, we do&nbsp;
not expect any significant increase in consultations or related project&nbsp;
delay or costs to be attributable to the designation of critical&nbsp;
habitat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comment 44: Several commenters stated that the DEA was biased&nbsp;
because it analyzed costs and not benefits, and that it should further&nbsp;
expand on the value of protecting vernal pool habitats. Several&nbsp;
commenters stated that the DEA overestimates costs. One commenter&nbsp;
stated that the development industry would simply avoid those areas&nbsp;
which would require compensation for vernal pool habitats focusing&nbsp;
their efforts on adjacent properties, thus minimizing costs associated&nbsp;
with the designation.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Response: There may be many opinions as to a particular&nbsp;
species' contribution to society, including their aesthetic,&nbsp;
scientific, or other significant contribution. However, placing a&nbsp;
specific monetary value on endangered species, critical habitat, and&nbsp;
other non-consumptive environmental or natural systems is subjective&nbsp;
and not quantifiable in terms of economics. Although the recreational&nbsp;
use aspect of natural areas can be identified, the economical benefit&nbsp;
of a species' existence in relation to a monetary figure cannot be&nbsp;
analyzed. The final economic analysis has taken into account the factor&nbsp;
that the development industry would simply avoid areas which had&nbsp;
habitat for the vernal pool crustaceans and vernal pool plants.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comment 45: Numerous commenters said that the designation would&nbsp;
greatly increase the costs (surveys, consultant fees, habitat&nbsp;
compensation fees, land acquisition, etc.) and regulatory burden&nbsp;
(California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), section 7 or section 10&nbsp;
of the Act, section 404 of the Clean Water Act (CWA), etc.) on&nbsp;
landowners and local governments, as well as delays in permit&nbsp;
processing and issuance of biological opinions. These cost and burdens&nbsp;
would have a negative impact on ranching/farming activities, local&nbsp;
economies, the development industry, and personal income. A few&nbsp;
commenters stated that we should pay for any increased costs required&nbsp;
for surveying.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Response: In the development of the draft and final economic&nbsp;
analyses for this rulemaking, our economist evaluated potential&nbsp;
economic effects of the issues raised by the commenters that could&nbsp;
potentially result from the proposed designation, as well as the co-
extensive costs associated with the species being federally listed.&nbsp;
Please refer to both the draft and final economic analyses for a more&nbsp;
thorough discussion of how these issues were addressed. Additionally,&nbsp;
while our analysis did show that approximately $23.4 million per year&nbsp;
would be attributed to the designation, it is small in comparison to&nbsp;
the value of new construction activities in the affected counties,&nbsp;
which amounted to over $19 billion in 2000 alone. Critical habitat&nbsp;
designation only affect actions with a Federal nexus, so any actions&nbsp;
carried out on non-Federal lands without Federal funding, permitting,&nbsp;
or authorization should not be affected. Further, critical habitat&nbsp;
designation may actually reduce delays and help prevent the possibility&nbsp;
of arbitrary biological opinions by establishing the habitat needs of&nbsp;
the species prior to the evaluation of specific projects. By alerting&nbsp;
the public to those habitat needs during the critical habitat&nbsp;
designation process, we may also help to avoid unpleasant surprises for&nbsp;
people who might not otherwise have been aware of the need to take&nbsp;
section 7 considerations into account.

[[Page 46709]]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comment 46: Dr. David Sunding, University of California, Berkeley,&nbsp;
submitted an alternate economic analysis of our proposed designation of&nbsp;
critical habitat for the 15 vernal pool species that questioned the&nbsp;
accuracy and robustness of our draft economic analysis.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Response: We have thoroughly reviewed and address the&nbsp;
substantive issues and concerns raised by Dr. Sunding's in his analysis&nbsp;
in the final economic analysis for this rulemaking. Please refer to&nbsp;
that document for a detailed discussion of Dr. Sunding's analysis and&nbsp;
our responses.

Issue 7--Procedural Concerns

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comment 47: One commenter stated that we violated the Commerce&nbsp;
Clause power and exceeded our jurisdiction by regulating species which&nbsp;
are in no way involved in interstate commerce.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Response: The Federal government has the authority under the&nbsp;
Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution to protect these species, for&nbsp;
the reasons given in Judge Wald's and Judge Henderson's concurring&nbsp;
opinion in Nat'l Ass'n of Home Builders v. Babbitt, 130 F.3d 1041 (D.C.&nbsp;
Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 1185 S. Ct. 2340 (1998). See also Gibbs v.&nbsp;
Babbitt, No.99-1218 (4th Cir. 2000). The Home Builders case involved a&nbsp;
challenge to application of Act prohibitions to protect the listed&nbsp;
Delhi Sands flower-loving fly (Rhaphiomidas terminatus abdominalis). As&nbsp;
with the species at issue here, the Delhi Sands flower-loving fly is&nbsp;
endemic to only one State. Judge Wald held that application of the Act&nbsp;
to this fly was a proper exercise of Commerce Clause power because it&nbsp;
prevented loss of biodiversity and destructive interstate competition.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comment 48: One commenter stated that since the we identified the&nbsp;
proposed rule as a significant regulatory action under Executive Order&nbsp;
12866, we violated it by: (1) Not submitting the economic analysis to&nbsp;
the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) along with the&nbsp;
proposed rule prior to publication in the Federal Register; (2) not&nbsp;
allowing a 60-day review period for the economic analysis; (3) not&nbsp;
identifying changes made to the proposed rule as a result of the&nbsp;
economic analysis; and (4) not considering the economic analysis during&nbsp;
the proposed designation process.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Response: Because this rulemaking is subject to a court imposed&nbsp;
deadline, section 6(a)(3)(D) of Executive Order 12866 allows us to&nbsp;
comply ``to the extent practicable'' with OIRA submission requirements&nbsp;
(commenter's point 1). We have done so by submitting both the proposed&nbsp;
rule and the economic analysis to OIRA for review as soon as was&nbsp;
possible prior to publication. It was not practicable to complete the&nbsp;
economic analysis prior to publication of the proposed rule, but we did&nbsp;
complete it and utilized it in reaching this final designation&nbsp;
(commenter's point 4).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With regard to the length of the comment period following&nbsp;
publication of the economic analysis (commenter's point 2), section&nbsp;
6(a)(1) of Executive Order 12866 states that we ``should, afford the&nbsp;
public a meaningful opportunity to comment on any proposed regulation,&nbsp;
which in most cases should include a comment period of not less than 60&nbsp;
days.'' The proposed regulation in this case is the proposed critical&nbsp;
habitat designation, not the economic analysis. We provided a total of&nbsp;
104 days for the public to comment on the proposed critical habitat&nbsp;
designation. Of those 104 days, 47 were after publication of the notice&nbsp;
of availability of the economic analysis on November 21, 2002 (67 FR&nbsp;
70201).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With regard to the identification of changes made to the proposed&nbsp;
rule (commenter's point 3), paragraphs 6(a)(3)(E)(ii) and (iii) of the&nbsp;
Order require us, subsequent to publication of a proposed rule, to&nbsp;
identify any substantive changes made to the proposed rule between&nbsp;
submission to OIRA and to the public. We made no substantive changes to&nbsp;
the proposed rule during that time period. Substantive changes made to&nbsp;
the rule following public review and comment are addressed in the&nbsp;
Summary of Changes from the Proposed Rule section of this final rule.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comment 49: One commenter stated that due to the U.S. Supreme Court&nbsp;
ruling in Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County v United States&nbsp;
Army Corp of Engineers (2001) 531 U.S. 159 (SWANCC), we do not have the&nbsp;
authority to list species or implement regulatory actions related to&nbsp;
such listings in isolated vernal pools.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Response: The SWANCC decision pertained to the Corps and their&nbsp;
authority under the Clean Water Act to take regulatory jurisdiction&nbsp;
over wetlands which may be isolated from navigatable waters. The 15&nbsp;
vernal pool species will continue to receive the protections afforded&nbsp;
them under the Act, including designation of critical habitat,&nbsp;
regardless of whether vernal pools are determined to be regulated as&nbsp;
waters of the United States under the Clean Water Act.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comment 50: One commenter stated that we failed to comply with&nbsp;
prescribed procedures mandated by the APA by not providing access to&nbsp;
the administrative record for the proposed rule and economic analysis.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Response: In the proposed rule, we stated that all supporting&nbsp;
documentation, including the references and unpublished data used in&nbsp;
the preparation of the proposed rule, would be available for public&nbsp;
inspection at the Sacramento Fish and Wildlife Office. A public viewing&nbsp;
area was made available at the Sacramento Fish and Wildlife Office&nbsp;
where the proposed critical habitat units, superimposed on 7.5 minute&nbsp;
topographic maps, could be inspected. In addition, we responded to each&nbsp;
request for GIS maps and data supporting the rulemaking in a timely&nbsp;
manner by providing copies of detailed maps and data specific to their&nbsp;
needs. Additionally, data concerning the occurrences of the vernal pool&nbsp;
crustaceans and vernal pool shrimp used in the analysis for the&nbsp;
proposed designation were also made available to the public, if&nbsp;
requested. Therefore, we believe that we have complied with provisions&nbsp;
of the APA as it relates to this rulemaking.

Summary of Changes From the Proposed Rule

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the basis of a review of public comments received on the&nbsp;
proposed designation of critical habitat and DEA for the 4 vernal pool&nbsp;
crustaceans and 11 vernal pool plants in California and southern&nbsp;
Oregon, we reevaluated our proposed critical habitat designation and&nbsp;
made changes as necessary. In the development of our final designation&nbsp;
of critical habitat for these 15 vernal pool species, we considered new&nbsp;
information provided to our office after the proposed designation was&nbsp;
published.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The refinements to the amount of land determined to be essential&nbsp;
for the 15 vernal pool species and incorporated into this final&nbsp;
designation resulted in a net reduction of approximately 466,504 ac&nbsp;
(186,601 ha) of land. Most of the units received some refinement, and a&nbsp;
few were divided into subunits depending on the amount of nonessential&nbsp;
lands that were removed. Information regarding the extent of the&nbsp;
changes from the proposed rule in the individual units is in the unit&nbsp;
descriptions for each species and acreage tables.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The common name for the species Castilleja campestris ssp.&nbsp;
succulenta was changed in the final rule (from succulent owl's-clover&nbsp;
to fleshy owl's-clover) to reflect the name used under the listing of&nbsp;
the species (Service 1997a). This was done to avoid

[[Page 46710]]

confusion between species listing and the designation of critical&nbsp;
habitat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Following publication of the proposed critical habitat rule for the&nbsp;
15 vernal pool species (67 FR 59884), we re-evaluated the proposed&nbsp;
critical habitat for each of the species to ensure that the areas&nbsp;
within the designation were essential to the conservation of the&nbsp;
species (see Methods section below).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the majority of instances, we continued to used the 328 ft (100&nbsp;
m) grid in determining the legal boundaries for the critical habitat.&nbsp;
As a result, some areas not containing the PCEs may still be within the&nbsp;
critical habitat boundary. Because these areas do not have one or more&nbsp;
of the PCEs for the 15 species, the landowners would not be required to&nbsp;
consult as a result of this determination. In some areas where precise&nbsp;
boundaries were required as a result of land ownership exclusions, or&nbsp;
for small areas surrounded by nonessential habitat, we used a 32.8 ft&nbsp;
(10 m) grid for further refinement. However due to time limits,&nbsp;
staffing, and funding required for completion of this rule, we were not&nbsp;
able to use the finer detailed 32.8 ft (10 m) grid for all the critical&nbsp;
habitat boundaries.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We excluded the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service owned lands within&nbsp;
the boundaries of the Kern, Sacramento, San Francisco Bay, and San Luis&nbsp;
National Wildlife Refuges and National Wildlife Refuge Complexes and&nbsp;
the Coleman National Fish Hatchery. The total amount of refuge and&nbsp;
hatchery land excluded totals approximately 33,097 ac (13,238 ha). We&nbsp;
also excluded California Department of Fish and Game owned lands within&nbsp;
the Battle Creek, Big Sandy, Grizzly Island, Hill Slough, North&nbsp;
Grasslands, and Oroville Wildlife Areas and State-owned lands within&nbsp;
Allensworth, Boggs Lake, Butte Creek Canyon, Calhoun Cut, Carrizo&nbsp;
Plains, Dales Lake, Fagan Marsh, Phoenix Field, San Joaquin River,&nbsp;
Stone Corral, and Thomes Creek Ecological Reserves. The total amount of&nbsp;
land excluded for State-owned lands excluded within wildlife areas or&nbsp;
ecological reserves is approximately 20,933 ac (8,373 ha). These areas&nbsp;
were excluded based on the benefits of inclusion verses the benefits of&nbsp;
exclusion and from information received from the California Department&nbsp;
of Fish and Game. We have determined that the benefits of exclusion&nbsp;
outweigh the benefits of inclusion for these areas (see Effects of&nbsp;
Critical Habitat Section below).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also excluded four military installations, three areas with&nbsp;
HCPs, and one area containing Tribal lands. Based on information&nbsp;
received from the military installations and the Tribal entity, we have&nbsp;
determined that the benefits of exclusion outweigh the benefits of&nbsp;
inclusion for these five areas (see Effects of Critical Habitat Section&nbsp;
below). The total amount of land excluded is approximately 64,803 ac&nbsp;
(25,921 ha). The specific land area for each exclusion is outlined&nbsp;
below and in the tables.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The four military installations include Beale AFB (5,028 ac (2,011&nbsp;
ha) excluded) in Yuba County, Travis AFB (5,089 ac (2,036 ha) excluded)&nbsp;
in Solano County, Fort Hunter Liggett (16,298 ac (6,519 ha) excluded)&nbsp;
in Monterey County, and Camp Roberts (33,117 ac (13,247 ha) excluded)&nbsp;
in San Luis Obispo and Monterey Counties, totaling approximately 59,532&nbsp;
ac (23,813 ha) excluded for all four military bases. The species&nbsp;
affected as a result of this determination include: the vernal pool&nbsp;
fairy shrimp, vernal pool tadpole shrimp, Conservancy fairy shrimp,&nbsp;
Tuctoria mucronata, Neostapfia colusana, and Lasthenia conjugens.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In comparing the benefits of inclusion of critical habitat for the&nbsp;
species versus benefits of exclusion of these areas, we determined that&nbsp;
it is appropriate to exclude these military installations from this&nbsp;
critical habitat designation under section 4(b)(2). The main benefit of&nbsp;
this exclusion is ensuring that military training activities can&nbsp;
continue without interruption while the INRMPs move toward full&nbsp;
implementation. One of the management strategies for each INRMP on the&nbsp;
four bases is to establish guidance for the conservation of vernal pool&nbsp;
ecosystems and the species inhabiting them. We have been working&nbsp;
closely with the various military installations to finalize the INRMPs&nbsp;
and have made significant progress toward conservation of the resources&nbsp;
at these facilities. In addition, after re-evaluating the habitat&nbsp;
associated with the proposed designation and making changes to the&nbsp;
critical habitat unit boundaries, the actual amount of habitat on&nbsp;
several of the bases was reduced since the habitat did not contain the&nbsp;
PCEs for the species. We expect that when the INRMPs are completed and&nbsp;
adopted in the near future, they will provide equal or greater&nbsp;
protection to vernal pool species habitat than a critical habitat&nbsp;
designation.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As described in the proposed rule, the area within the proposed&nbsp;
Unit 35 for vernal pool fairy shrimp in Riverside County may be subject&nbsp;
to exclusion. After further evaluation, we determined that the area&nbsp;
known as the Skunk Hollow critical habitat unit is appropriate for&nbsp;
exclusion based on the determination that the special management&nbsp;
considerations and protections afforded by its inclusion in a reserve&nbsp;
established within an approved mitigation bank in the Rancho Bella&nbsp;
Vista Habitat Conservation Plan area.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the vernal pool fairy shrimp is not expressly covered by&nbsp;
the Assessment District 161 Subregional HCP (AD161 HCP), we believe&nbsp;
that management actions undertaken in the Skunk Hollow watershed to&nbsp;
benefit the endangered Riverside fairy shrimp, threatened Navarretia&nbsp;
fossalis (spreading navarretia), and the endangered Orcuttia&nbsp;
californica (California Orcutt grass)--all of which are included as&nbsp;
covered species under the HCP--will provide equal conservation benefits&nbsp;
for the vernal pool fairy shrimp. The total area excluded for vernal&nbsp;
pool fairy shrimp as a result of this exclusion is approximately 239 ac&nbsp;
(97 ha).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are also excluding Unit 33 (Hemet-San Jacinto Unit ABC) and Unit&nbsp;
34 (Santa Rosa Plateau Unit) of the vernal pool fairy shrimp critical&nbsp;
habitat based on section 4(b)(2) of the Act. The habitat within Unit 33&nbsp;
is included in the Draft Western Riverside HCP which will provide&nbsp;
protections for the species and habitat. Vernal pools within the Santa&nbsp;
Rosa Plateau Ecological Reserve, including those in Unit 34, are&nbsp;
conserved and managed for the benefit of the species that occur within&nbsp;

the vernal pools and surrounding watersheds. Exclusion of units 33 and&nbsp;
34 from vernal pool fairy shrimp critical habitat will not result in&nbsp;
the extinction of the species. The removal of these units from critical&nbsp;
habitat designation reduces the total amount of critical habitat&nbsp;
designated for the species by approximately 8,425 ac (3,370 ha).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, a small portion of the area within the proposed vernal&nbsp;
pool fairy shrimp critical habitat (Unit 18) in San Joaquin County also&nbsp;
has an approved and legally operative NCCP/HCP (San Joaquin Multi-
Species Conservation Plan), which includes measures for the&nbsp;
conservation of these two species. It would be appropriate to exclude&nbsp;
these units. The total amount of area excluded for vernal pool fairy&nbsp;
shrimp as a result of this exclusion is approximately 141 ac (56 ha).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We proposed critical habitat on Tribal lands of the Mechoopda in&nbsp;
Butte County, although at that time we were unaware that these were&nbsp;
Tribal lands. The Mechoopda brought this to our attention during the&nbsp;
comment period and requested that their lands be excluded from the&nbsp;
final designation. We evaluated the lands proposed as critical habitat&nbsp;
and find that the benefits of excluding these areas from critical&nbsp;
habitat designation outweigh the

[[Page 46711]]

benefits of including these areas. The Mechoopda Tribe submitted a&nbsp;
management plan that provides for special management considerations or&nbsp;
protections for listed vernal pool species. The Tribe demonstrated its&nbsp;
commitment to ensuring the long-term viability of federally listed&nbsp;
species on Tribal lands by implementing appropriate conservation&nbsp;
measures that will contribute to species' long-term survival by&nbsp;
ensuring the conservation of vernal pool resources on Tribal property.&nbsp;
The approximate amount of land which the Mechoopda Tribe requested to&nbsp;
exclude is approximately 645 ac (260 ha). The proposed critical habitat&nbsp;
for the area included habitat for the vernal pool tadpole shrimp (Unit&nbsp;
4). The benefits of including the Tribe's land are limited to minor&nbsp;
educational benefits, since the Tribe has committed to consult with us&nbsp;
on any effects to the species. The benefits of excluding these areas&nbsp;
from being designated as critical habitat are more significant, and&nbsp;
include encouraging the continued development and implementation of&nbsp;
special management measures. The exclusion of critical habitat for the&nbsp;
Mechoopda trust lands is consistent with our published policies&nbsp;
(Secretarial Order 3206, Presidential Memorandum dated April 29, 1994:&nbsp;
Government-to-Government Relations with Native American Tribal&nbsp;
Governments (May 4, 1994, 59 FR 22951)) on Native American natural&nbsp;
resource management because this exclusion allows the Tribe to manage&nbsp;
its own natural resources.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, as a result of comments received, we made editorial&nbsp;
changes to the sections of the rule pertaining to the methods used, the&nbsp;
PCEs, the criteria used to identify critical habitat, and the unit&nbsp;
descriptions for all 15 vernal pool species. We made these changes to&nbsp;
eliminate redundancy, improve clarity, and provide a more in-depth&nbsp;
explanation of the biological necessity of the designation for the 15&nbsp;
vernal pool species.

Critical Habitat

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Critical habitat is defined in section 3 of the Act as: (i) The&nbsp;
specific areas within the geographic area occupied by a species at the&nbsp;
time it is listed in accordance with the Act, on which are found those&nbsp;
physical or biological features (I) essential to the conservation of&nbsp;
the species and (II) that may require special management considerations&nbsp;
or protection; and (ii) specific areas outside the geographic area&nbsp;
occupied by a species at the time it is listed, upon a determination&nbsp;
that such areas are essential for the conservation of the species.&nbsp;
``Conservation,'' as defined by the Act, means the use of all methods&nbsp;
and procedures that are necessary to bring an endangered or a&nbsp;
threatened species to the point at which listing under the Act is no&nbsp;
longer necessary.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 7(a)(2) of the Act requires that Federal agencies shall, in&nbsp;
consultation with us, insure that any action they authorize, fund, or&nbsp;
carry out is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a&nbsp;
listed species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of&nbsp;
critical habitat. Section 7 also requires conferences on Federal&nbsp;
actions that are likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any&nbsp;
species proposed to be listed or result in the destruction or adverse&nbsp;
modification of critical habitat proposed to be designated for such&nbsp;
species. Aside from the added protection that may be provided under&nbsp;
section 7, the Act does not provide other forms of protection to lands&nbsp;
designated as critical habitat. Consultation under section 7 of the Act&nbsp;
does not apply to activities on private or other non-Federal lands that&nbsp;
do not involve a Federal nexus, and consequently critical habitat&nbsp;
designation does not afford any additional regulatory protection under&nbsp;
the Act under those circumstances.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to be included in a critical habitat designation, the&nbsp;
habitat must be essential to the conservation of the species. Critical&nbsp;
habitat designations identify, to the extent known and using the best&nbsp;
scientific and commercial data available, habitat areas that provide&nbsp;
essential life-cycle needs of the species (i.e., areas on which are&nbsp;
found the PCEs, as defined at 50 CFR 424.12(b)).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 4 requires that we designate critical habitat for a&nbsp;
species, to the extent such habitat is determinable, at the time of&nbsp;
listing. When we designate critical habitat at the time of listing or&nbsp;
under short court-ordered deadlines, we may not have sufficient&nbsp;
information to identify all the areas essential for the conservation of&nbsp;
the species or, alternatively, we may inadvertently include areas that&nbsp;
later will be shown to be nonessential. Nevertheless, we are required&nbsp;
to designate those areas we know to be critical habitat, using the best&nbsp;
information available to us. Section 4(b)(2) of the Act requires that&nbsp;
we take into consideration the economic impact, and any other relevant&nbsp;
impact, of specifying any particular area as critical habitat. We may&nbsp;
exclude areas from critical habitat designation when the benefits of&nbsp;
exclusion outweigh the benefits of including the areas within critical&nbsp;
habitat, provided the exclusion will not result in extinction of the&nbsp;
species.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within the geographic area occupied by the species, we will&nbsp;
designate only areas currently known to be essential. Essential areas&nbsp;
already have the features and habitat characteristics that are&nbsp;
necessary to sustain the species. If the information available at the&nbsp;
time of designation does not show that an area provides essential life-
cycle needs of the species, then the area should not be included in the&nbsp;
critical habitat designation.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our regulations state that ``The Secretary shall designate critical&nbsp;
habitat outside the geographic areas presently occupied by the species&nbsp;
only when a designation limited to its present range would be&nbsp;
inadequate to ensure the conservation of the species'' (50 CFR&nbsp;
424.12(e)). Accordingly, when the best available scientific and&nbsp;
commercial data do not demonstrate that the conservation needs of the&nbsp;
species require designation of critical habitat outside of occupied&nbsp;
areas, we will not designate critical habitat in those areas outside.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Policy on Information Standards Under the Endangered Species&nbsp;
Act, published on July 1, 1994 (59 FR 34271), provides criteria,&nbsp;
establishes procedures, and provides guidance to ensure that our&nbsp;
decisions represent the best scientific and commercial data available.&nbsp;
It requires us, to the extent consistent with the Act, and with the use&nbsp;
of the best scientific and commercial data available, to use primary&nbsp;
and original sources of information as the basis for recommendations to&nbsp;
designate critical habitat. When determining which areas are critical&nbsp;
habitat, a primary source of information should, at a minimum, be the&nbsp;
listing package for the species. Additional information may be obtained&nbsp;
from recovery plans, articles in peer-reviewed journals, conservation&nbsp;
plans developed by States and Ccunties, scientific status surveys and&nbsp;
studies, biological assessments, unpublished materials, and solicited&nbsp;
expert opinion.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 4 of the Act requires that we designate critical habitat&nbsp;
based on what we know at the time of the designation. Habitat is often&nbsp;
dynamic, and species may move from one area to another over time.&nbsp;
Furthermore, we recognize that designation of critical habitat may not&nbsp;
include all of the habitat areas that may eventually be determined to&nbsp;
be necessary for the conservation of the species. For these reasons,&nbsp;
all should understand that critical habitat designations do not signal&nbsp;
that habitat outside the designation is unimportant or may not be&nbsp;
required for the conservation of the species. Areas outside the&nbsp;
critical habitat designation will continue to be subject to&nbsp;
conservation actions that may be

[[Page 46712]]

implemented under section 7(a)(1), the regulatory protections afforded&nbsp;
by the section 7(a)(2) jeopardy standard, and the applicable&nbsp;
prohibitions of section 9 of the Act, as determined on the basis of the&nbsp;
best available information at the time of the action. Federally funded&nbsp;
or assisted projects affecting listed species outside their designated&nbsp;
critical habitat areas may still result in jeopardy findings in some&nbsp;
cases. Similarly, critical habitat designations made on the basis of&nbsp;
the best available information at the time of designation should not&nbsp;
control the direction and substance of future recovery plans, HCPs, or&nbsp;
other species conservation planning efforts if new information&nbsp;
available to these planning efforts calls for a different outcome.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The action of designating critical habitat does not automatically&nbsp;
lead to recovery of a listed species, but it may contribute to species&nbsp;
long-term conservation. Critical habitat units are not preserve areas;&nbsp;
designation does not target and establish specific preserves and their&nbsp;
boundaries. Critical habitat is designated to make Federal agencies&nbsp;
aware that these areas are critical to the species. Although the&nbsp;
designation of critical habitat can identify areas where a variety of&nbsp;
conservation strategies may be developed to ensure the survival and&nbsp;
recovery of target species, the development of these strategies are&nbsp;
most appropriately taken through local planning efforts, such as the&nbsp;
development of HCPs. The action of designating critical habitat does&nbsp;
not result in the creation of management plans, establish numerical&nbsp;
population goals, or prescribe specific management actions, whether&nbsp;
inside or outside of such designated critical habitat. Specific&nbsp;
management recommendations for areas designated as critical habitat are&nbsp;
most appropriately addressed in recovery, conservation, and management&nbsp;
plans, and through consultations and permits under section 7 and&nbsp;
section 10 of the Act.

Prudency Determination

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, and implementing&nbsp;
regulations (50 CFR 424.12) require that, to the maximum extent prudent&nbsp;
and determinable, we designate critical habitat at the time the species&nbsp;
is determined to be endangered or threatened. Our regulations (50 CFR&nbsp;
424.12(a)(1)) state that designation of critical habitat is not prudent&nbsp;
when one or both of the following situations exist--(1) The species is&nbsp;
threatened by taking or other human activity, and identification of&nbsp;
critical habitat can be expected to increase the degree of such threat&nbsp;
to the species, or (2) such designation of critical habitat would not&nbsp;
be beneficial to the species. At the time of the final listing&nbsp;
determinations (62 FR 34029; 62 FR 14338; 59 FR 48136; 57 FR 24192), we&nbsp;
found that designation of critical habitat was not prudent for the&nbsp;
vernal pool crustaceans and plants (excluding Tuctoria mucronata). At&nbsp;
the time of final listing of Tuctoria mucronata (43 FR 44810), we did&nbsp;
not make any determination about whether or not designation of critical&nbsp;
habitat was prudent.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, in the past few years, several of our determinations that&nbsp;
the designation of critical habitat would not be prudent have been&nbsp;
overturned by court decisions. For example, in Conservation Council for&nbsp;
Hawaii v. Babbitt, the United States District Court for the District of&nbsp;
Hawaii ruled that the Service could not rely on the ``increased&nbsp;
threat'' rationale for a ``not prudent'' determination without specific&nbsp;
evidence of the threat to the species at issue (2 F. Supp. 2d 1280 [D.&nbsp;
Hawaii 1998]). Additionally, in Natural Resources Defense Council v.&nbsp;
U.S. Department of the Interior, the United States Court of Appeals for&nbsp;
the Ninth Circuit issued a ruling that limited the application of the&nbsp;
no benefit justification and required the Service to balance the&nbsp;
potential threats against any benefits to the species of designating&nbsp;
critical habitat 113 F. 3d 1121, 1125 (9th Cir. 1997).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The courts also have ruled that, in the absence of a finding that&nbsp;
the designation of critical habitat would increase threats to a&nbsp;
species, the existence of another type of protection, even if it offers&nbsp;
potentially greater protection to the species, does not justify a not&nbsp;
prudent finding (Conservation Council for Hawaii v. Babbitt 2 F. Supp.&nbsp;
2d 1280).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the basis of these court decisions and the decision specific to&nbsp;
these species, we have re-evaluated our original prudency&nbsp;
determinations for the 14 vernal pool species for which we had made a&nbsp;
determination, using the information available at the time we made our&nbsp;
final listing decisions and that which has become available since. We&nbsp;
further evaluated the prudency of designation critical habitat for&nbsp;
Tuctoria mucronata in light of these court decisions.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If critical habitat is designated for the 15 vernal pool species,&nbsp;
Federal agencies will be required to consult with us on actions they&nbsp;
carry out, fund, permit, or authorize, to ensure that their actions&nbsp;
will not destroy or adversely modify critical habitat . It may also&nbsp;
provide information to Federal agencies and the general public of the&nbsp;
importance of the vernal pool species and their habitat and the need&nbsp;
for special management considerations or protection. A critical habitat&nbsp;
designation may assist Federal agencies in planning future actions&nbsp;
because it establishes, in advance, those habitats that will be&nbsp;
reviewed in section 7 consultations.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have determined that the instances of likely vandalism,&nbsp;
discussed in the final listing rules as the rationale for why we did&nbsp;
not believe critical habitat to be prudent, though real, have been&nbsp;
relatively isolated since the species have been listed. Consequently,&nbsp;
we conclude that designating critical habitat will not increase&nbsp;
incidences of habitat vandalism above current levels for these species.&nbsp;
Accordingly, we withdraw our previous determinations that the&nbsp;
designation of critical habitat is not prudent. We find that&nbsp;
designation of critical habitat is prudent and determinable for the 15&nbsp;
vernal pool species addressed herein because there is not likely to be&nbsp;
increased threats to the species that may result from the critical&nbsp;
habitat designation. Therefore, we are subsequently designating&nbsp;
critical habitat for the four vernal pool crustaceans and 11 vernal&nbsp;
pool plants in this final rule.

Methods

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As required by section 4(b)(2) of the Act and regulations at 50 CFR&nbsp;
424.12, we are to use the best scientific and commercial data available&nbsp;
to determine areas that contain the physical and biological features&nbsp;
essential for the conservation of the 15 vernal pool species. This&nbsp;
included data and information contained in, but not limited to, the&nbsp;
final rules listing the 15 species addressed herein, the Vernal Pools&nbsp;
of Southern California Final Recovery Plan (Service 1998), the Delta&nbsp;
Green Ground Beetle and Solano Grass Recovery Plan (Service 1985), the&nbsp;
California Vernal Pool Assessment Preliminary Report (Keeler-Wolf&nbsp;
1998), Report of Science Advisors for the Eastern Merced County Natural&nbsp;
Community Conservation Plan Habitat Conservation Plan (Noss et al.&nbsp;
2002a), research and survey observations published in peer reviewed&nbsp;
articles, vernal pool mapping and other data collected for the&nbsp;
development of HCPs, reports submitted by biologists holding section&nbsp;
10(a)(1)(A) recovery permits, biological assessments provided to us&nbsp;
through section 7 consultations, data collected for the development of&nbsp;
a Wetland Conservation Plan in Oregon, reports and documents that are&nbsp;
on file in our field offices, and personal discussions with experts&nbsp;
outside of our agency with extensive knowledge of vernal pool species&nbsp;
and habitats.

[[Page 46713]]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The critical habitat units were delineated by using ArcView&nbsp;
(Environmental Systems Research Institute, Inc.), a computer GIS&nbsp;
program to evaluate GIS data derived from a variety of Federal, State,&nbsp;
and local agencies, and from private organizations and individuals.&nbsp;
Data layers included current and historic species occurrence locations&nbsp;
(CNDDB 2002), mapped vernal pool grassland habitats (Holland 1998,&nbsp;
2003), and/or other vernal pool location information. We presumed&nbsp;
occurrences identified in CNDDB to be extant unless there was&nbsp;
affirmative documentation that an occurrence had been extirpated. We&nbsp;
also relied on unpublished species occurrence data contained within our&nbsp;
files including section 10(a)(1)(A) reports and biological assessments.&nbsp;
These data layers were then mapped onto SPOT imagery (satellite aerial&nbsp;
photography) (CNES/SPOT Image Corporation 1993-2000) for each vernal&nbsp;
pool region identified by Keeler-Wolf et al. 1998 to help us identify&nbsp;
which specific areas contained the vernal pool species and their&nbsp;
habitat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We then evaluated the areas defined by the overlap of the combined&nbsp;
coverages (data layers) to initially focus on which areas may provide&nbsp;
those physical and biological features essential to the conservation of&nbsp;
the 15 vernal pool species. The areas were further refined by using&nbsp;
satellite imagery, watershed boundaries, geologic landform coverages,&nbsp;
elevational modeling data, soil type coverages, vegetation/land cover&nbsp;
data, and agricultural/urban land use data to eliminate areas that did&nbsp;
not contain the appropriate vegetation or associated native plant&nbsp;
species, as well as features such as cultivated agriculture fields,&nbsp;
housing developments, and other areas that are unlikely to contribute&nbsp;
to the conservation of the 15 vernal pool species. Each of the factors&nbsp;
identified above had a bearing on the total size and spatial&nbsp;
configuration of the conglomeration of units for each species, as well&nbsp;
as the size and location of each of the individual units. Whenever&nbsp;
possible, geographic features (e.g., ridge lines, valleys, streams,&nbsp;
plateaus, geologic formations, shorelines, etc.) or manmade features&nbsp;
(e.g., roads or obvious land use) that created an obvious boundary for&nbsp;
a unit were used as unit area boundaries.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The resulting delimited areas or lands for each species were then&nbsp;
considered to define all habitat for that species, including occupied&nbsp;
and unoccupied habitat. These lands were further evaluated to determine&nbsp;
which of specific areas are essential to the conservation of each of&nbsp;
the 15 listed vernal pool species. Several tools were used to assist us&nbsp;
in delineating the specific areas that we believed to contain the&nbsp;
primary constituent elements for each species and therefore essential&nbsp;
to the species' conservation. These included: (1) Generally accepted&nbsp;
conservation biology principles as described below; (2) information in&nbsp;
recovery plans covering the subject species; (3) peer reviewed,&nbsp;
published literature; (4) expert opinion for each of the species. The&nbsp;
resulting areas were subsequently proposed as critical habitat for the&nbsp;
15 vernal pool species.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Following publication of the proposed critical habitat rule for the&nbsp;
15 vernal pool species (67 FR 59884), we re-evaluated the lands&nbsp;
proposed based on information received during the public comment&nbsp;
period, from local habitat and species experts, or otherwise made&nbsp;
available to us. We also used updated detailed aerial photography&nbsp;
provided by county planning departments, and DOQQs from the USGS. In&nbsp;
Merced County, local experts including National Wildlife Refuge and&nbsp;
CDFG biologists were consulted to identify and verify habitat areas. We&nbsp;
also visited selected locations to determine if they contained the&nbsp;
PCEs.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because the minimum mapping unit of the Holland (1998) vernal pool&nbsp;
habitat data was 40 ac (16 ha), and the resolution of the SPOT imagery&nbsp;
did not allow us to identify all vernal pool habitat, we refined unit&nbsp;
boundaries based on additional GIS data layers when necessary and&nbsp;
available, including soils information from the Soil Survey Geographic&nbsp;
data bases (U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) 1998-2001), and the&nbsp;
California State Soil Geographic data bases (USDA 1994). We used&nbsp;
geologic information developed by the California Department of Mines&nbsp;
and Geology (2000) and Liss (2001). To identify the extent of flat or&nbsp;
gently sloping topography where vernal pools are found, we evaluated&nbsp;
Digital Elevation Models from the USGS (2000).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also used a number of local GIS data sets for specific areas,&nbsp;
including information developed through the Riverside Multiple Species&nbsp;
HCP and the Vernal Pools of Southern California Final Recovery Plan&nbsp;
(Service 1998), habitat mapping for Butte County (U.S. Environmental&nbsp;
Protection Agency (EPA) 1994), Tehama County (2001), Shasta County&nbsp;
(2001), Placer County (Glazner 2001), Solano County (2000), Yolo County&nbsp;
(1995), Sacramento County (1999), and San Joaquin County (2000) in&nbsp;
California, and by the Rogue Valley Council of Governments in Oregon&nbsp;
(Evans 2000). Other smaller scale mapping efforts were reviewed from&nbsp;
Solano County Farmlands and Open Space (2000) and East Bay Regional&nbsp;
Parks District (2001). Aerial photographs for eastern Merced County&nbsp;
were used to determine habitat conditions. The specific layers used and&nbsp;
the methodology employed for each unit is described within the Unit&nbsp;
Descriptions section. To determine land ownership within each unit, we&nbsp;
used data from the State of California (Davis et al. 1998) and the U.S.&nbsp;
Bureau of Indian Affairs in Sacramento, California (2001).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We excluded areas that do not contain one or more of the PCEs or&nbsp;
were not essential for the conservation of the vernal pool species&nbsp;
because: (1) The area is highly degraded and may not be restorable; (2)&nbsp;
the area is small, highly fragmented, or isolated, and may provide&nbsp;
little or no long-term conservation value; or (3) the area is excluded&nbsp;
under section 4(b)(2) of the Act for military, economic or other&nbsp;
reasons (See Exclusions Under section 4(b)(2)). The critical habitat&nbsp;
units were further refined to remove lands determined not to be&nbsp;
essential to the conservation of the vernal pool species through&nbsp;
analysis conducted through the section 7 or section 10 process. The&nbsp;
specific modifications are described in the Summary of Changes from the&nbsp;
Revised Proposed Rule section of this rule.

Primary Constituent Elements

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In accordance with section 3(5)(A)(i) of the Act and regulations at&nbsp;
50 CFR 424.12(b), in determining which areas to propose as critical&nbsp;
habitat, we consider those physical and biological features essential&nbsp;
to the conservation of the species and that may require special&nbsp;
management considerations or protection. These include, but are not&nbsp;
limited to, the following: (1) Space for individual and population&nbsp;
growth, and for normal behavior; (2) food, water, air, light, minerals,&nbsp;
or other nutritional or physiological requirements; (3) cover or&nbsp;
shelter; (4) sites for breeding, reproduction, rearing of offspring,&nbsp;
germination, or seed dispersal; and, generally; and (5) habitats that&nbsp;
are protected from disturbance or are representative of the historic&nbsp;
geographical and ecological distributions of a species. Our regulations&nbsp;
at 50 CFR 424.12(b) further direct that when considering the&nbsp;
designation of critical habitat, we are to focus on the principal&nbsp;
biological or physical constituent elements within the defined area&nbsp;
that are essential to the conservation of the species, and we are to&nbsp;
list known PCEs with the critical habitat description. Our regulations

[[Page 46714]]

describe known PCEs in terms that are more specific than the&nbsp;
description of physical and biological features. Specifically, PCEs may&nbsp;
include, but are not limited to, the following: roost sites, nesting&nbsp;
grounds, spawning sites, feeding sites, seasonal wetland or dryland,&nbsp;
water quality or quantity, host species of plant pollinator, geological&nbsp;
formation, vegetation type, tide, and specific soil types.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on our current knowledge of the life history and ecology of&nbsp;
the 15 listed vernal pool species, the relationship of their essential&nbsp;
life history functions to their habitat, and the ecological and&nbsp;
hydrologic functions of vernal pool complexes, as summarized above in&nbsp;
the Background section, we determined that all of the 15 vernal pool&nbsp;
species share the following two PCEs. These are:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) Vernal pools, swales, and other ephemeral wetland features of&nbsp;
appropriate sizes and depths that typically become inundated during&nbsp;
winter rains and hold water for sufficient lengths of time necessary&nbsp;
for the 15 species to complete their life cycle.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) The geographic, topographic, and edaphic features that support&nbsp;
aggregations or systems of hydrologically interconnected pools, swales,&nbsp;
and other ephemeral wetlands and depressions within a matrix of&nbsp;
surrounding uplands that together form hydrologically and ecologically&nbsp;
functional units called vernal pool complexes. These features&nbsp;
contribute to the filling and drying of the vernal pool, maintain&nbsp;
suitable periods of pool inundation, and maintain water quality and&nbsp;
soil moisture to enable the 15 vernal pool species to carry out their&nbsp;
lifecycles.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first PCE provides the necessary soil moisture and aquatic&nbsp;
environment required for seed germination, cyst hatching, growth,&nbsp;
maturation, reproduction, and dispersal, and the appropriate periods of&nbsp;
dry-down for seed and cyst dormancy. Both the wet and dry phases of the&nbsp;
vernal pool help to reduce competition with strictly terrestrial or&nbsp;
strictly aquatic plant or animal species. The wet phase provides the&nbsp;
necessary cues for hatching, germination, and growth, while the drying&nbsp;
phase allows the vernal pool plants to flower and produce seeds and the&nbsp;
vernal pool crustaceans to mature and produce cysts. We conclude this&nbsp;
element is essential to the conservation of the 15 vernal pool species&nbsp;
because these species are ecologically dependent on seasonal&nbsp;
fluctuations, such as absence or presence of water during specific&nbsp;
times of the year, and duration of inundation and the rate of drying of&nbsp;
their habitats. They cannot persist in perennial wetlands or wetlands&nbsp;
that are inundated for the majority of the year, nor can they persist&nbsp;
without periodic seasonal inundation.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second PCE (the entire vernal pool complex, including the&nbsp;
pools, swales, and associated uplands) is essential to maintain both&nbsp;
the aquatic phase and the drying phase of the vernal pool habitat.&nbsp;
Although the vernal pool species addressed in this rule do not occur in&nbsp;
the strictly upland areas surrounding vernal pools, they are dependent&nbsp;
on these upland areas to maintain the aquatic and drying phases of the&nbsp;
vernal pool. The germination of vernal pool plants and hatching of&nbsp;
cysts is dependent on the timing and length of inundation of the vernal&nbsp;
pool habitat. The rate of vernal pool drying, during which vernal pool&nbsp;
plants must flower and produce seeds, is also largely controlled by&nbsp;
interactions between the vernal pool and the surrounding uplands (Hanes&nbsp;
et al. 1990; Hanes and Stromberg 1998). The uplands also provide a&nbsp;
source of nutrients and food sources for the 15 vernal pool species and&nbsp;
provide habitat for pollinator species that may be specifically adapted&nbsp;
to some of the plant species in this rule (Thorp 1998; Eriksen and Belk&nbsp;
1999). The uplands also provide habitat for avian species and other&nbsp;
animals known to aide in the dispersal of the 15 vernal pool species&nbsp;
(Zedler and Black 1992; Silveira 1998).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first of these PCEs provides for space, physiological&nbsp;
requirements, shelter, and reproduction sites for the 15 vernal pool&nbsp;
species. Vernal pools and other ephemeral wetlands provide space during&nbsp;
their wetted periods for individual and population growth and normal&nbsp;
behavior of vernal pool species by providing still, freshwater habitat&nbsp;
of appropriate depth, duration, temperature, and chemical&nbsp;
characteristics for: (1) Juvenile and adult vernal pool crustaceans to&nbsp;
hatch, swim, grow, reproduce and behave normally; (2) the aquatic stage&nbsp;
of the seven Orcuttieae tribe plants to germinate and grow under water;&nbsp;
and (3) saturating areas of ground to the extent and duration necessary&nbsp;
to allow the four non-Orcuttiae plants to germinate and grow. Vernal&nbsp;
pools and other ephemeral wetlands also provide soil space during both&nbsp;
dry and wetted periods for the maintenance of dormant cyst and seed&nbsp;
banks, which allow populations of vernal pool species to maintain&nbsp;
themselves throughout the unpredictable and highly variable&nbsp;
environmental conditions experienced by their nondormant life history&nbsp;
stages.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vernal pools and other ephemeral wetlands also provide various&nbsp;
physiological requirements for both vernal pool plants and crustaceans.&nbsp;
For crustaceans they provide water, oxygen, and food such as plankton,&nbsp;
detritus, and (in the case of vernal pool tadpole shrimp) other small&nbsp;
crustaceans. For vernal pool plants, they provide water and various&nbsp;
nutrients from detritus that sinks to the bottom. They also provide&nbsp;
oxygen for the aquatic leaves of Orcuttieae tribe plants.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By drying seasonally, ephemeral wetlands provide cover or shelter&nbsp;
from many aquatic predators and competitors (see background section).&nbsp;
Similarly, by undergoing seasonal inundation, these areas provide&nbsp;
shelter for vernal pool plants from terrestrial plants which would&nbsp;
otherwise outcompete them for space, light, water, or nutrients.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, vernal pool crustaceans require wetted ephemeral wetlands&nbsp;
in which to mate, and both vernal pool crustaceans and vernal pool&nbsp;
plants deposit cysts or eggs in these wetland areas, which must then&nbsp;
dry to allow hatching or germination. Wetted ephemeral wetlands may&nbsp;
also tend to attract waterfowl, which act as important seed and cyst&nbsp;
dispersers (Proctor 1965; Silveira 1998).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second PCE, upland areas and vernal swales hydrologically&nbsp;
associated with ephemeral wetlands, is essential for maintaining the&nbsp;
seasonal cycle of ponding and drying in the ephemeral wetland areas.&nbsp;
Upland areas are therefore essential for providing the same physical&nbsp;
and biological factors as are provided by the ephemeral wetland areas.&nbsp;
Additionally, they provide an important (and often primary) source of&nbsp;
detritus, which is an important food source for vernal pool crustaceans&nbsp;
and nutrient source for vernal pool plants. Upland and swale areas also&nbsp;
provide habitat for waterfowl, amphibians, mammals, or insects, all of&nbsp;
which are important for seed, pollen, or cyst dispersal. Certain upland&nbsp;
and swale areas may also help disperse seeds and cysts more directly,&nbsp;
and also provide for population growth by channeling flood waters from&nbsp;
overflowing ephemeral wetland areas so that seeds, cysts, or adult&nbsp;
individuals are washed from one such wetland to another.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have used vernal pool complexes as the basis for determining&nbsp;
populations of vernal pool crustaceans since the species were first&nbsp;
proposed for listing. The final rule to list the four vernal pool&nbsp;
crustaceans states that ``[t]he genetic characteristics of the three&nbsp;
fairy shrimp and vernal pool tadpole shrimp, as well as ecological&nbsp;
conditions, such as watershed contiguity, indicate that

[[Page 46715]]

populations of these animals are defined by pool complexes rather than&nbsp;
by individual vernal pools'' (Fugate 1992, 1998; King 1996). Therefore,&nbsp;
the most accurate indication of the distribution and abundance of the&nbsp;
four vernal pool crustaceans is the number of inhabited vernal pool&nbsp;
complexes. Individual vernal pools occupied by the four species listed&nbsp;
herein are most appropriately referred to as ``subpopulations'' (59 FR&nbsp;
48136). Our use of vernal pool complexes to define populations of the&nbsp;
four listed crustaceans was upheld by the U.S. District Court in post-
listing challenge to the listing (Building Industry Association of&nbsp;
Superior California, et al. v. Babbit et al., CIV 95-0726 PLF). The&nbsp;
July 25, 1997, court decision stated that the plaintiffs were on notice&nbsp;
that the Service would consider vernal pool complexes as a basis for&nbsp;
determining fairy shrimp populations. The court also concluded that the&nbsp;
use of this methodology was neither arbitrary nor capricious. The Court&nbsp;
of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit upheld the district court's decision,&nbsp;
and the Supreme Court has declined to hear the case.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each of the critical habitat units likely includes some areas that&nbsp;
are unoccupied by the vernal pool crustaceans and vernal pool plants.&nbsp;
``Unoccupied'' is defined here as an area that contains no hatched&nbsp;
vernal pool crustaceans or observed above-ground vernal pool plants,&nbsp;
and that is unlikely to contain a viable cyst or seed bank. Determining&nbsp;
the specific areas that the vernal pool crustaceans or vernal pool&nbsp;
plants occupy is difficult because, depending on climatic factors and&nbsp;
other natural variations in habitat conditions, the size of the&nbsp;
localized area in which above-ground plants or hatched crustaceans&nbsp;
appear may fluctuate dramatically from one year to another. In some&nbsp;
years, individuals may be observed throughout a large area, and in&nbsp;
other years they may be observed in a smaller area or not at all.&nbsp;
Because it is logistically difficult to determine how extensive the&nbsp;
cyst or seed bank is at any particular site, and because hatched vernal&nbsp;
pool crustaceans or above-ground vernal pool plants may or may not be&nbsp;
present in all vernal pools within a site every year, we cannot&nbsp;
quantify in any meaningful way what proportion of each critical habitat&nbsp;
unit may actually be occupied by the vernal pool crustaceans or vernal&nbsp;
pool plants. Therefore, areas of unoccupied habitat are probably&nbsp;
interspersed with areas of occupied habitat in each unit. The inclusion&nbsp;
of unoccupied habitat in our critical habitat units reflects the&nbsp;
dynamic nature of the habitat and the life history characteristics of&nbsp;
the vernal pool crustaceans and vernal pool plants. Unoccupied areas&nbsp;
provide areas into which populations might expand, provide connectivity&nbsp;
or linkage between groups of organisms within a unit, and support&nbsp;
populations of pollinators and seed dispersal organisms. Both occupied&nbsp;
and unoccupied areas that are designated as critical habitat are&nbsp;
essential to the conservation of the species.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All of the above described PCEs do not have to occur simultaneously&nbsp;
within a unit for the unit to constitute critical habitat for any of&nbsp;
the 15 vernal pool species. We determined the PCEs of critical habitat&nbsp;
for the 15 species based on studies on their habitat and population&nbsp;
biology, including but not limited to Kalin-Arroyo 1973; Ellias 1986;&nbsp;
Corbin and Schoolcraft 1989; Jokerst 1989; Eng et al. 1990; Alexander&nbsp;
and Schlising 1997; Helm 1998; Witham 1998; Eriksen and Belk 1999;&nbsp;
Grosberg 2002. Additional information on species-specific PCEs are&nbsp;
outlined below in Descriptions of Critical Habitat Units for each&nbsp;
species.

Conservation Criteria Used to Identify Critical Habitat

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on the best scientific information available, all areas&nbsp;
identified as critical habitat for the 15 vernal pool species addressed&nbsp;
by this rule are within the historical and current ranges of each of&nbsp;
the species and contain the two PCEs identified above. Rather than&nbsp;
designate every area containing PCEs, however, we designated only those&nbsp;
areas which available evidence clearly demonstrated were essential to&nbsp;
the conservation of each species. Areas for which the evidence&nbsp;
available at this time was less certain were not included in this&nbsp;
designation, although we believe these areas to be important to the&nbsp;
species and may include them in future recovery plans. Areas essential&nbsp;
to the conservation of the species are those that are necessary to&nbsp;
advance at least one of the following conservation criteria:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) The conservation of areas representative of the geographic&nbsp;
distribution of the species. Species that are protected across their&nbsp;
ranges have lower chances of extinction (Soule and Simberloff 1986;&nbsp;
Murphy et al. 1990; Primack 1993; Given 1994; Hunter 1996; Pavlik 1996;&nbsp;
Noss et al. 1999; Grosberg 2002). Maintenance of representative&nbsp;
occurrences of the species throughout its geographic range helps ensure&nbsp;
the conservation of regional adaptive differences and makes the species&nbsp;
less susceptible to environmental variation or negative impacts&nbsp;
associated with human disturbances or natural catastrophic events&nbsp;
across the species' entire range at any one time (Primack 1993; New&nbsp;
1995; Hunter 1996; Helm 1998; Redford and Richter 1999; Rossum et al.&nbsp;
2001; Grosberg 2002). Additionally, the conservation of the geographic&nbsp;
distribution of the species is one of the physical and biological&nbsp;
features we are required to consider under our regulations (50 CFR&nbsp;
424.13(b)). Accordingly, we considered the number of occupied areas in&nbsp;
each vernal pool region (Sawyer and Keeler-Wolf 1995), and determined&nbsp;
roughly the extent to which each occupied area would likely be&nbsp;
necessary for the conservation of the species in the region or as a&nbsp;
whole.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) The conservation of areas representative of the ecological&nbsp;
distribution of the species. Each of the 15 vernal species is&nbsp;
associated with various combinations of soil types, vernal pool&nbsp;
chemistry, geomorphic surfaces (landforms), and vegetation community&nbsp;
associations. Maintaining the full range of varying habitat types and&nbsp;
characteristics for a species is essential because it would include the&nbsp;
full extent of the physical and environmental conditions necessary for&nbsp;
the species (Zedler and Ebert 1979; Ikeda and Schlising 1990; Fugate&nbsp;
1992; Gonzales et al.1996; Fugate 1998; Platenkamp 1998; Bainbridge&nbsp;
2002; Noss et al. 2002a). Vernal pool species are extremely adapted to&nbsp;
the physical and chemical characteristics of the habitat in which they&nbsp;
occur. Additionally, the conservation of the ecological distribution of&nbsp;
the species is one of the physical and biological features we are&nbsp;
required to consider under our regulations 50 CFR 424.13(b), and was&nbsp;
also strongly endorsed by at least one peer reviewer (see Peer Review&nbsp;
section). Accordingly, we considered the extent to which habitat types&nbsp;
occupied by the species could be expected to be conserved in light of&nbsp;
the number of occupied areas and the threats involved.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) The conservation of areas necessary to allow movement of cysts,&nbsp;
pollen, and seeds between areas representative of the geographic and&nbsp;
ecological distribution of the species. As a result of dispersal events&nbsp;
within and between vernal pool complexes, and environmental conditions&nbsp;
that may prevent the emergence of dormant cysts and seeds for up to&nbsp;
several decades, the presence of vernal pool species is dynamic in both&nbsp;
space and time (Eriksen and Belk 1999; Noss et al. 2002a). We therefore&nbsp;
determined that essential habitat for the vernal pool

[[Page 46716]]

species must provide for movement within and between vernal pool&nbsp;
complexes to provide for the varying nature and expression of vernal&nbsp;
pool species,and also allow for gene flow and dispersal and habitat&nbsp;
availability that accommodate natural processes of local extirpation&nbsp;
and colonization over time (Stacey and Taper 1992; Falk et al. 1996;&nbsp;
Davies et al. 1997; Husband and Barrett 1998; Holt and Keitt 2000;&nbsp;
Keymer et al. 2000; Donaldson et al. 2002).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4) In cases where more occupied areas were present than were&nbsp;
needed for the conservation of the geographic or ecological&nbsp;
distribution of the species, we gave priority to areas which already&nbsp;
possessed a measure of protection or which possessed the largest&nbsp;
unfragmented vernal pool complexes. Other criteria being equal, such&nbsp;
areas are likely to contribute more to the conservation of the species&nbsp;
because threats posed by habitat fragmentation are more easily&nbsp;
minimized within them. Small, isolated habitat populations are more&nbsp;
likely to be extirpated by direct or indirect natural or human impacts&nbsp;
(Fahrig 1997; Noss and Csuti 1997; Debinski and Holt 2000; Grosberg&nbsp;
2002; Noss et al. 2002a), and are less likely to maintain the&nbsp;
hydrological processes of pooling and drying on which the vernal pool&nbsp;
species depend.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on these criteria, we determined that all currently known&nbsp;
extant occurrences of the 11 vernal pool plants and 2 of the 4 vernal&nbsp;
pool crustaceans (Conservancy fairy shrimp and longhorn fairy shrimp)&nbsp;
are essential to the conservation of the species, due to their limited&nbsp;
geographic and ecological distributions (criteria 1 and 2), low overall&nbsp;
number of populations (criterion 1), and the seriousness of the threats&nbsp;
posed to remaining populations, including fragmentation of habitat. For&nbsp;
the other two vernal pool crustaceans (vernal pool fairy shrimp and&nbsp;
vernal pool tadpole shrimp), we were able to meet the criteria listed&nbsp;
above without designating all occupied areas.

Special Management Considerations

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In designating critical habitat, we also have considered how this&nbsp;
designation highlights habitat that needs special management&nbsp;
considerations or protection. For example, we have many regional HCPs&nbsp;
under development, and this designation will be useful in helping&nbsp;
applicants determine what vernal pool habitat areas should be highest&nbsp;
priority for special management or protection, and where there may be&nbsp;
more flexibility in conservation options. This designation will guide&nbsp;
them and us in ensuring that all local habitat conservation planning&nbsp;
efforts are consistent with conservation objectives for these species.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once a vernal pool habitat has been protected from direct filling,&nbsp;
it is still necessary to ensure that the habitat is not rendered&nbsp;
unsuitable for vernal pool species because of factors such as altered&nbsp;
hydrology, contamination, nonnative species invasions, or other&nbsp;
incompatible land uses. Even the best-designed vernal pool preserve may&nbsp;
still be susceptible to alterations that render it unsuitable for&nbsp;
vernal pool species. Many of the factors that cause the decline and&nbsp;
localized extirpation of vernal pool species can be controlled through&nbsp;
special management actions. Examples of special management actions that&nbsp;
may be necessary to prevent further declines and loss of populations of&nbsp;
species addressed in this rule include the following:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) Actions to prevent or reduce competition of vernal pool plants&nbsp;
with invasive species. Many of the species addressed in this rule are&nbsp;
threatened by invasion of nonnative species (CNDDB 2001). Special&nbsp;
management actions can be taken to reduce the negative effects of such&nbsp;
invasions. For example, grazing can be effectively used to control a&nbsp;
variety of upland exotic plants. However, the timing and intensity of&nbsp;
grazing is critical to its success as a management tool, and these&nbsp;
factors should be closely monitored. Alternatively, inappropriate&nbsp;
grazing can also pose a threat to many of the vernal pool plant species&nbsp;
(CNDDB 2001). Prescribed burning is another management tool that may be&nbsp;
effective in controlling nonnative plant species (Pollack and Kan&nbsp;
1998).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fire must be appropriately timed, and fire frequency is important.&nbsp;
The potential for alteration of nutrient cycling must be also&nbsp;
considered. Other management techniques for control of invasive species&nbsp;
include mowing, hand removal, and selective herbicide applications. Any&nbsp;
technique employed must be carefully controlled and monitored to ensure&nbsp;
that it does not negatively affect the vernal pool species.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) Actions to restore vernal pool hydrology. Alteration of natural&nbsp;
hydrology threatens many of the species addressed in this rule (CNDDB&nbsp;
2001). In many cases other threats, such as the invasion of nonnative&nbsp;
species or contamination, are facilitated by alterations of natural&nbsp;
vernal pool hydrology. Special management actions, such as the removal&nbsp;
of dams or other structures that artificially increase the length of&nbsp;
vernal pool inundation, the removal of ditches that artificially drain&nbsp;
vernal pools, or the construction of berms or reconstruction of&nbsp;
culverts to prevent water from flowing artificially into vernal pools&nbsp;
from adjacent areas, can be taken to restore natural vernal pool&nbsp;
hydrology. Modification of grazing regimes may also restore natural&nbsp;
vernal pool hydrology (Barry 1998). Monitoring of vernal pool hydrology&nbsp;
is important to ensure that restoration actions are successful.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) Actions to reduce human degradation of vernal pools. Special&nbsp;
management actions such as fencing, trail building, and posting signs&nbsp;
can help to reduce human activities that threaten vernal pool species.&nbsp;
These actions may reduce the damage resulting from off-road vehicle&nbsp;
use, dumping, and vandalism that threatens many of the species&nbsp;
addressed in this rule.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4) Actions to restore severely degraded habitats. Active&nbsp;
restoration of highly degraded vernal habitats may be necessary in some&nbsp;
areas. Such restoration may involve earth-moving activities designed to&nbsp;
restore historic pool and swale topography and to reestablish natural&nbsp;
vernal pool hydrology (Ferren and Hubbard 1998; Black and Zedler 1998).&nbsp;
These types of actions are extremely complex, and require diligent&nbsp;
planning and monitoring to ensure their success. Active restoration is&nbsp;
only recommended for seriously degraded habitats that otherwise would&nbsp;
not maintain natural vernal pool ecosystem processes.

Critical Habitat Designation

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The approximate area of critical habitat by county and land&nbsp;
ownership is shown in Tables 1 and 2. Because many of the units of&nbsp;
overlap due to species occurrences within the same area, the total of&nbsp;
all critical habitat designated is much less than the sum of critical&nbsp;
habitat areas for each species. Lands designated are under private,&nbsp;
State, and Federal ownership and divided into 125 Critical Habitat&nbsp;
Units. The tables provide separate columns for privately owned land&nbsp;
subject to conservation easements or agreements and other privately&nbsp;
owned lands. The amount of land area identified as critical habitat for&nbsp;
vernal pool tadpole shrimp unit 15, Butte County meadowfoam unit 3, San&nbsp;
Joaquin Valley Orcutt grass unit 2, and Contra Costa goldfields unit 3,&nbsp;
differ from those identified in the tables due to changes in the GIS&nbsp;
coverages used to calculate those areas. The total amount of critical&nbsp;
habitat for all species is not affected.

crustaceans and plants in California and Oregon.

Description of Species Specific Criteria and Critical Habitat Units

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As discussed in the''Exclusions Under Section 4(b)(2) of the Act''&nbsp;
section of this final rule, we have excluded from the final designation&nbsp;
National Wildlife Refuge lands, National fish hatchery lands, State&nbsp;
wildlife areas and ecological reserves, as well as all critical habitat&nbsp;
units in the following California counties: Butte, Madera, Merced,&nbsp;
Sacramento, and Solano. The descriptions below are for the units&nbsp;
entirely or partially included in the final critical habitat&nbsp;
designation. The descriptions, including acreage of units, do not&nbsp;
necessarily reflect all of the subsequent exclusions of areas pursuant&nbsp;
to section 4(b)(2) of the Act in the final designation. Please refer to&nbsp;
that section of the rule for additional discussion of areas excluded&nbsp;
from the final designation.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Except where otherwise noted, all units contain known occurrences&nbsp;
of the species in question, as well as both of the PCEs listed above,&nbsp;
and at least one of the specific PCEs of the species (e.g., involving&nbsp;
specific soil types, ponding depths). Each unit was chosen for its&nbsp;
ability to advance at least one of the conservation criteria listed&nbsp;
above.

Conservancy Fairy Shrimp

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most occurrences of Conservancy fairy shrimp are limited to large&nbsp;
clay-bottomed pools that are rare within the vernal pool landscapes&nbsp;
within California (Vollmar 2002). Helm (1998) observed that most&nbsp;
Conservancy fairy shrimp occurrences were on Anita, Pescadero, or&nbsp;
Peters Clay soils. Conservancy fairy shrimp are typically found in&nbsp;
turbid and large ((0.4 ha to 0.8 ha)(1 to 2 ac)) to very large ((35 ha&nbsp;
(88 ac)) vernal pools (Helm and Vollmar 2002). However, the pools&nbsp;
inhabited by conservancy fairy shrimp near the Montezuma Hills in&nbsp;
Solano County and in Butte County are relatively small and have a low&nbsp;
turbidity (Vollmar 2002). The species is found in large playa pools on&nbsp;
Tuscan or Mehrten geologic formations and on Basin Rim landforms in&nbsp;
Tehama, Merced, and Solano Counties (Helm 1998) on various soil types.&nbsp;
The parent material of vernal pools greatly influences species&nbsp;
composition and hydrologic functioning of the vernal pool (Hanes and&nbsp;
Stromberg 1998; Smith and Verrill 1998). Soils beneath vernal pools are&nbsp;
extremely variable and are not the same as soils mapped by soil&nbsp;
surveys, but are usually undescribed hydric inclusions that vary by&nbsp;
location (Holland and Dain 1990). The Vina Plains area in Tehama County&nbsp;
supports occurrences of the species within numerous large pools&nbsp;
throughout the area (Eriksen and Belk 1999; Helm 1998; Helm and Vollmar&nbsp;
2002). The pools in the Sacramento National Wildlife Refuge area in&nbsp;
Glenn and Colusa Counties as well as in parts of the San Luis National&nbsp;
Refuge Complex in Merced County are associated with alkaline sink areas&nbsp;
and tend to be higher in pH and salinity than in other pools where the&nbsp;
species is found. The primary constituent elements of critical habitat&nbsp;
for Conservancy fairy shrimp are the habitat components that provide:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) Vernal pools, swales, and other ephemeral wetlands and&nbsp;
depressions of appropriate sizes and depths that typically become&nbsp;
inundated during winter rains and hold water for sufficient lengths of&nbsp;
time necessary for Conservancy fairy shrimp incubation, reproduction,&nbsp;
dispersal, feeding, and sheltering, including but not limited to large&nbsp;
playa vernal pools often found on basin rim landforms and alkaline&nbsp;
soils, but which are dry during the summer and do not necessarily fill&nbsp;
with water every year; and
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) The geographic, topographic, and edaphic features that support&nbsp;
aggregations or systems of hydrologically interconnected pools, swales,&nbsp;
and other ephemeral wetlands and depressions within a matrix of&nbsp;
surrounding uplands that together form hydrologically and ecologically&nbsp;
functional units called vernal pool complexes.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These features contribute to the filling and drying of the vernal&nbsp;
pool and

[[Page 46722]]

maintain suitable periods of pool inundation, water quality, and soil&nbsp;
moisture for vernal pool crustacean hatching, growth and reproduction,&nbsp;
and dispersal, but not necessarily every year.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit contains vernal pools found on Anita clay and Tuscan loam&nbsp;
soils (EPA 1994; Holland 1998; Tehama County 1999; USDA 2001), and&nbsp;
represents the northern extent of Conservancy fairy shrimp range.&nbsp;
Conservancy fairy shrimp in this area occupy vernal pools that are&nbsp;
classified as Northern Hardpan by Sawyer and Keeler-Wolf (1995) and&nbsp;
occur on the Tuscan, Red Bluff, and Riverbank geologic formations.&nbsp;
Within this unit vernal pools occur in complexes with a range of pool&nbsp;
sizes, from over several acres (hectares) to less than a 0.1 ac (500&nbsp;
m\2\), in areas of hummocky ground on old terraces above recent river&nbsp;
flood plains below the foothills (Alexander and Schlising 1997; Keeler-
Wolf et al. 1998). The unit is essential to ensure the conservation of&nbsp;
the species in general, as well as in the northern extent of its range&nbsp;
(criterion 1). It is also essential to the conservation of the&nbsp;
ecological distribution of the species, because of the wide range of&nbsp;
occupied pool sizes and because the combination of soils, geologic&nbsp;
formations, and pool type is not otherwise well represented for the&nbsp;
species (criterion 2). The unit is also important because it includes&nbsp;
relatively undisturbed, hydrologically intact vernal pool habitats that&nbsp;
will likely continue to support natural vernal pool ecosystem processes&nbsp;
and meet the appropriate habitat conditions for Conservancy fairy&nbsp;
shrimp (criterion 4), and because it provides seasonal habitat for&nbsp;
waterfowl and other migratory bird species that aid in the dispersal of&nbsp;
Conservancy fairy shrimp among vernal pools within the unit, as well as&nbsp;
between other habitats across the species range (criterion 3).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The majority of the lands included within this unit are privately&nbsp;
owned. This unit contains The Nature Conservancy's (TNC) Vina Plains&nbsp;
preserve as well as other TNC lands 5,660 ac (2,264 ha) and&nbsp;
conservation easements 10,870 ac (4,348 ha). The Natural Resource&nbsp;
Conservation Services (NRCS) also holds Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP)&nbsp;
conservation easements or agreements on 142 ac (57 ha).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Vina Plains Unit extends from south of Deer Creek to north of&nbsp;
Rock Creek and the Chico Airport near the City of Chico. State Highway&nbsp;
99 bisects this unit. The western boundary generally parallels the&nbsp;
Southern Pacific Railway line. The eastern boundary of this unit&nbsp;
extends to the boundary of the East Red Bluff watershed.

Unit 6, Merced Unit, Merced and Mariposa Counties (132,902 ac (53,785&nbsp;
ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit contains Conservancy fairy shrimp occurrences within&nbsp;
large playa vernal pools found on Raynor Cobbly clay soils on the&nbsp;
Mehrten Formation (EIP Associates 1999; CNDDB 2001). This soil and&nbsp;
geologic formation combination is not represented by any of the other&nbsp;
units (criterion 2). The Merced Unit encompasses the largest block of&nbsp;
pristine, high-density vernal pool grasslands remaining in California&nbsp;
(Vollmar 2002). The relatively undisturbed, hydrologically intact&nbsp;
condition of the unit increases the likelihood that it will continue to&nbsp;
support natural vernal pool ecosystem processes and maintain suitable&nbsp;
habitat conditions for Conservancy fairy shrimp (criterion 4). The&nbsp;
Conservancy fairy shrimp occurrence at the Flying M Ranch is already&nbsp;
being managed through a conservation easement with TNC that conserves&nbsp;
over 5,000 ac (2,023 ha) of vernal pool and upland habitat (criterion&nbsp;
4). Land ownership within the unit includes approximately 8 ac (3 ha)&nbsp;
of Federal lands and TNC has a total of 11,283 ac (4,513 ha) of&nbsp;
conservation easements within this unit.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A majority of the vernal pool habitat in the Merced Unit is in&nbsp;
eastern Merced County. The eastern edge of the unit overlaps into&nbsp;
western Mariposa County, and in the south, it extends to Deadman Creek.&nbsp;
The northern boundary parallels the Merced River. The unit is located&nbsp;
east of Highway 99 and the City of Merced, Planada, and Le Grand. The&nbsp;
eastern boundary extends into the low elevation foothills of the Sierra&nbsp;
Nevada.

Unit 8, Ventura County Unit, Ventura County (46,531 ac (18,831 ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ventura County Unit is located in the north-central portion of&nbsp;
Ventura County. With the exception of 1,951 ac (790 ha) that are&nbsp;
privately owned, all other land within this unit occurs within the Los&nbsp;
Padres National Forest. Vernal pool fairy shrimp and Conservancy fairy&nbsp;
shrimp co-occur at relatively high-elevation (5,500 ft (1,700 m))&nbsp;
forested sites within this unit. This combination of attributes is&nbsp;
ecologically unique because these species normally occur at much lower&nbsp;
elevations in grassland habitat. The critical habitat perimeter&nbsp;
encompasses an area that is known to contain vernal pool and&nbsp;
Conservancy fairy shrimp and isolated pools that provide habitat for&nbsp;
both species. Few fairy shrimp surveys exist for this unit. However,&nbsp;
listed fairy shrimp probably occur at several additional locations with&nbsp;
suitable ephemeral aquatic habitat. A further potential benefit of&nbsp;
designating this unit is that it may help to promote efforts to&nbsp;
identify and proactively manage such locations, which are not typically&nbsp;
associated with these invertebrates. The Ventura County Unit is&nbsp;
essential for the conservation of Conservancy fairy shrimp because it&nbsp;
contains high elevation ephemeral aquatic environments that are rarely&nbsp;
associated with fairy shrimp (criterion 2). This unit also represents&nbsp;
the extreme southern end of the species range, and is 124 mi (200 km)&nbsp;
from other species occurrences in the Great Central Valley (criterion&nbsp;
1).

Longhorn Fairy Shrimp Criteria

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Longhorn fairy shrimp occurrences are highly disjunct and scarce&nbsp;
within the geographic range in which they occur. There are fewer areas&nbsp;
in which this species is known to occur than any other listed vernal&nbsp;
pool crustacean. The specific pool characteristics that determine&nbsp;
suitability for longhorn fairy shrimp reproduction and growth are not&nbsp;
well understood. We identified critical habitat areas essential to the&nbsp;
conservation of longhorn fairy shrimp in three areas in which it is&nbsp;
known to occur. In determining areas that are essential to conserve&nbsp;
longhorn fairy shrimp, we used the best scientific and commercial data&nbsp;
available. Longhorn fairy shrimp occurrences are known from Contra&nbsp;
Costa County to San Luis Obispo County with an elevational variation of&nbsp;
near 15 m (50 ft) to near 600 m (2,000 ft). A broad distribution of&nbsp;
longhorn fairy shrimp across its geographical and elevational&nbsp;
distribution protects the natural environmental processes for the&nbsp;
species and provides the best chance for retaining the species across&nbsp;
the full extent of the species range. The vernal pool types and soils&nbsp;
associated with the three general areas of concentration of longhorn&nbsp;
fairy shrimp differ greatly across the geographic range of the species&nbsp;
and leads to different species compositions and environmental&nbsp;
conditions between longhorn fairy shrimp occurrences. Providing for a&nbsp;
mosaic of habitat types both between and among vernal pool species is&nbsp;
essential because it would include the full extent of the physical and&nbsp;
environmental conditions for the species (Fugate 1992; Fugate 1998;&nbsp;
Gonzales et al. 1996; Ikeda and Schlising 1990; Noss et al. 2002a,&nbsp;
Platenkamp 1998; Zedler et al. 1979). The Altamont Pass subunits (unit&nbsp;
1abc)

[[Page 46723]]

support occurrences of the species within clear depression pools in&nbsp;
sandstone outcrops (Eriksen and Belk 1999; EBRPD 2001; CNDDB 2002).&nbsp;
Midway in the species' range, the alkaline pools supporting longhorn&nbsp;
fairy shrimp are found on Edminster loam and Turlock sandy loam. In the&nbsp;
species' southern range, they are found on shallow alkaline Northern&nbsp;
Claypan type vernal pools within a valley saltbush scrub matrix. The&nbsp;
parent material of vernal pools greatly influences species composition&nbsp;
and hydrologic functioning of the vernal pool (Hanes and Stromberg&nbsp;
1998; Holland and Jain 1981, 1988). Soils beneath vernal pools are&nbsp;
extremely variable and are not the same as soils mapped by soil&nbsp;
surveys, but are usually undescribed hydric inclusions which vary upon&nbsp;
location (Holland and Dain 1990). The primary constituent elements of&nbsp;
critical habitat for longhorn fairy shrimp are the habitat components&nbsp;
that provide:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) Vernal pools, swales, and other ephemeral wetlands and&nbsp;
depressions of appropriate sizes and depths that typically become&nbsp;
inundated during winter rains and hold water for sufficient lengths of&nbsp;
time necessary for longhorn fairy shrimp incubation, reproduction,&nbsp;
dispersal, feeding, and sheltering, including but not limited to, large&nbsp;
playa vernal pools often on basin rim landforms and alkaline soils, but&nbsp;
which are dry during the summer and do not necessarily fill with water&nbsp;
every year; and
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) The geographic, topographic, and edaphic features that support&nbsp;
aggregations or systems of hydrologically interconnected pools, swales,&nbsp;
and other ephemeral wetlands and depressions within a matrix of&nbsp;
surrounding uplands that together form hydrologically and ecologically&nbsp;
functional units called vernal pool complexes. These features&nbsp;
contribute to the filling and drying of the vernal pool and maintain&nbsp;
suitable periods of pool inundation, water quality, and soil moisture&nbsp;
for vernal pool crustacean hatching, growth and reproduction, and&nbsp;
dispersal, but not necessarily every year.

Unit 1, Altamont Hills Unit A and B, Contra Costa and Alameda Counties&nbsp;
(791 ac (320 ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit supports occurrences of the species within clear&nbsp;
depression pools in sandstone outcrops (Eriksen and Belk 1999; EBRPD&nbsp;
2001; CNDDB 2002). The essential habitat for the species occurs in&nbsp;
sandstone rock outcroppings with the pools sometimes being less than a&nbsp;
meter (3 ft) across. This is a unique habitat for longhorn fairy&nbsp;
shrimp, and helps to maintain a diversity of habitats for the species&nbsp;
(criterion 2). The Altamont Hills Unit is also an important area for&nbsp;
the species because it represents the northern limit of its range, and&nbsp;
is one of only three locations where the species is known to occur&nbsp;
(criterion 1).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit is located in Altamont Hills north and northeast of the&nbsp;
City of Livermore, and consists of two subunits, both near the Contra&nbsp;
Costa and Alameda County line. Subunit A is located in Contra Costa&nbsp;
County directly north of the Alameda County line near the Vasco Caves.&nbsp;
Subunit B is located directly in Alameda County just south of the&nbsp;
Contra Costa County line in the vicinity of Brushy Peak. This unit is&nbsp;
located primarily on East Bay Regional Park District and Contra Costa&nbsp;
Water District land.

Unit 3, Carrizo Plain Unit, San Luis Obispo, Kern, and Monterey&nbsp;
Counties (10,466 ha (25,862 ac))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit contains occurrences of the species living within&nbsp;
Northern Claypan type vernal pools as described by Sawyer and Keeler-
Wolf (1995) (CNDDB 2001). Longhorn fairy shrimp in the Carrizo Unit are&nbsp;
found in shallow alkaline vernal pools within a valley saltbush scrub&nbsp;
matrix. These ecological characteristics are not represented by the&nbsp;
other units (criterion 2). The Carrizo Plain Unit also represents the&nbsp;
southern extent of the range of longhorn fairy shrimp (criterion 1).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit is located in the vicinity of California Valley and Soda&nbsp;
Lake. State Highway 58 is located north of the unit. Most of the&nbsp;
habitat is east of Soda Lake Road. To the east, the unit is bordered by&nbsp;
the San Andreas Rift Zone. The Carrizo Plain Unit contains portions of&nbsp;
the Carrizo Plain National Monument administered by the BLM, TNC, and&nbsp;
the CDFG. The BLM lands within the unit total approximately 15,549 ac&nbsp;
(6,220 ha), and CDFG lands total approximately 234 ac (95 ha). Other&nbsp;
vernal pool habitats in the unit are located on private land.

Vernal Pool Fairy Shrimp

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vernal pool fairy shrimp are distributed across a large geographic&nbsp;
range from southern Oregon to southern California (Eriksen and Belk&nbsp;
1999). Although the habitat of vernal pool fairy shrimp is highly&nbsp;
fragmented and occurrences are isolated from each other by varying&nbsp;
degrees across the species' range, the distribution of remaining extant&nbsp;
occurrences is somewhat evenly spread throughout its range. Vernal pool&nbsp;
fairy shrimp occur in a wide variety of habitat types from the Agate&nbsp;
Desert area in southern Oregon, to throughout the Sacramento and San&nbsp;
Joaquin valleys, the central Coast Range, and into Riverside County,&nbsp;
California. Although some of the habitat characteristics of the species&nbsp;
are known, specific pool characteristics that determine suitability for&nbsp;
vernal pool fairy shrimp hatching, growth, and reproduction are not&nbsp;
well understood. Vernal pool fairy shrimp occurrences are known to&nbsp;
occur in eight general areas of concentration on basin rim, low&nbsp;
terrace, high terrace, volcanic mudflow, valley floor, alkaline playa,&nbsp;
and coastal mountain landforms. The elevational differences in the&nbsp;
distribution of vernal pool fairy shrimp range from near 8 m (25 ft) in&nbsp;
the Central and Sacramento Valleys to near 150 m (500 ft) in Shasta&nbsp;
County. A broad distribution of vernal pool fairy shrimp across its&nbsp;
geographical and elevational distribution protects the natural&nbsp;
environmental processes for the species and provides the best chance&nbsp;
for retaining the species across the full extent of the species' range.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The vernal pool types and soils associated with the eight general&nbsp;
areas of concentration of vernal pool fairy shrimp differ greatly&nbsp;
across the geographic range of the species and lead to different&nbsp;
species compositions and ecological conditions between vernal pool&nbsp;
fairy shrimp occurrences. Providing for a mosaic of habitat types both&nbsp;
between and among vernal pool species is essential because it would&nbsp;
include the full extent of the physical and environmental conditions&nbsp;
for the species (Barclay and Knight 1984; Bauder and McMillan 1998;&nbsp;
Fugate 1992, 1998; Gonzales et al.1996; Noss et al. 2002a; Noss et al.&nbsp;
2002b; Platenkamp 1998; Zedler et al. 1979).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vernal pool fairy shrimp are usually found in vernal pools (79%),&nbsp;
although they are sometimes found in a range of natural and&nbsp;
artificially created ephemeral habitats such as alkali pools, seasonal&nbsp;
drainages, stock ponds, vernal swales, and rock outcrops (Vollmar&nbsp;
2002). Vernal pool fairy shrimp are most frequently found in small&nbsp;
((&lt;200 m<sup>2</sup>)(&lt;2,125 ft<sup>2</sup>)) and shallow ((mean of 5&nbsp;
cm)(2 in)) pool habitats; however, this species can be found in large&nbsp;
(44,534 m<sup>2</sup>)(480,967 ft<sup>2</sup>) and very deep (122 cm)&nbsp;
(48 in) pool habitats as well (Helm and Vollmar 2002). The landform&nbsp;
associations for the vernal pool fairy shrimp include alluvial fans,&nbsp;
bedrock, bedrock escarpments, basin rim, floodplain, high terrace,&nbsp;
stream terrace, volcanic mudflow, and low terrace formations (Helm&nbsp;
1998). The soils that contain occurrences of vernal pool fairy shrimp&nbsp;
in the delineated units vary significantly throughout the species'&nbsp;
range. In the north, the rare Northern Mudflow formation underlies&nbsp;
vernal pools in Shasta and Tehema Counties.

[[Page 46724]]

Tehema and Butte Counties contain Northern Basalt Flow vernal pools&nbsp;
that are limited to ancient terraces and hilltops that comprise some of&nbsp;
the oldest geologic formations in California. Northern Volcanic Mudflow&nbsp;
vernal pools are delineated in Butte and Yuba Counties. Throughout the&nbsp;
Central Valley, the habitat ranges from high terrace landforms to&nbsp;
claypan and hardpan pool types. Northern Basalt Flow vernal pools are&nbsp;
found in Fresno County in the low elevation foothills. In the Suisun&nbsp;
Marsh area, vernal pool fairy shrimp are found in the saline-alkaline&nbsp;
transition zone. The parent material of vernal pools greatly influences&nbsp;
species composition and hydrologic functioning of the vernal pool&nbsp;
(Hanes and Stromberg 1998; Holland and Jain 1981, 1988). Soils beneath&nbsp;
vernal pools are extremely variable and are not the same as soils&nbsp;
mapped by soil surveys, but are usually undescribed hydric inclusions&nbsp;
which vary upon location (Holland and Dain 1990). The primary&nbsp;
constituent elements of critical habitat for vernal pool fairy shrimp&nbsp;
are the habitat components that provide:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) Vernal pools, swales, and other ephemeral wetlands and&nbsp;
depressions of appropriate sizes and depths that typically become&nbsp;
inundated during winter rains and hold water for sufficient lengths of&nbsp;
time necessary for vernal pool fairy shrimp incubation, reproduction,&nbsp;
dispersal, feeding, and sheltering, including but not limited to&nbsp;
Northern Hardpan, Northern Claypan, Northern Volcanic Mud Flow, and&nbsp;
Northern Basalt Flow vernal pools formed on a variety of geologic&nbsp;
formations and soil types, but which are dry during the summer and do&nbsp;
not necessarily fill with water every year; and
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) The geographic, topographic, and edaphic features that support&nbsp;
aggregations or systems of hydrologically interconnected pools, swales,&nbsp;
and other ephemeral wetlands and depressions within a matrix of&nbsp;
surrounding uplands that together form hydrologically and ecologically&nbsp;
functional units called vernal pool complexes. These features&nbsp;
contribute to the filling and drying of the vernal pool, and maintain&nbsp;
suitable periods of pool inundation, water quality, and soil moisture&nbsp;
for vernal pool crustacean hatching, growth and reproduction, and&nbsp;
dispersal, but not necessarily every year.

Oregon

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vernal pool fairy shrimp is the only species addressed in this&nbsp;
final rule that occurs in Oregon. Four units in Oregon are designated&nbsp;
as essential to the conservation of vernal pool fairy shrimp, and there&nbsp;
are 29 units in California. The Oregon units occur approximately 200 km&nbsp;
(125 mi) north of the nearest unit designated for this species in&nbsp;
California. We identified critical habitat areas essential to the&nbsp;
conservation of vernal pool fairy shrimp to reflect the species&nbsp;
geographic distribution and varying habitat types and species&nbsp;
associations across its range. Maintaining vernal pool fairy shrimp&nbsp;
across their full geographic distribution would make the species less&nbsp;
susceptible to environmental variation or negative impacts associated&nbsp;
with human disturbances or natural catastrophic events across the&nbsp;
species entire range at any one time (Grosberg 2002, Helm 1998; Hunter&nbsp;
1996, New 1995, Primack 1993; Redford and Richter 1999; Rossum et al.&nbsp;
2001). Variation in environmental conditions such as precipitation&nbsp;
amount, precipitation timing, and temperature, influence vernal pool&nbsp;
species including hatching and reproduction of vernal pool fairy shrimp&nbsp;
from year to year (Eriksen and Belk 1999, Grosberg 2002, Helm 1998,&nbsp;
Helm and Vollmar 2002, Service 1994c, Simovich 1998).

Unit 1A, B, C ,D, E, F, and G, North Agate Desert Unit, Jackson County&nbsp;
(2,130 ac (862 ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit consists of seven subunits, all located to the north of&nbsp;
Little Butte Creek. This unit represents the northern limit of the&nbsp;
species' distribution (criterion 1). It is of sufficient size to&nbsp;
sustain the natural ecosystem processes (e.g., fires) that have&nbsp;
historically influenced vernal pool habitat, and is separated from the&nbsp;
nearest other unit designated for Oregon, Unit 4, by over 2 mi (3.2&nbsp;
km). Three of the subunits are west of the Rogue River, and the&nbsp;
remaining four are to the east. All but one of these subunits are&nbsp;
located to the south of U.S. Route 234 (Sam's Valley Highway). The one&nbsp;
remaining unit is located to the east of the Rogue River, about 1.5 mi&nbsp;
(2.4 km) north of the confluence with Reese Creek.

Unit 2A, B, C, D, and E, White City East Unit, Jackson County (2,251 ac&nbsp;
(911 ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit consists of five subunits, located east of U.S. Route 62&nbsp;
(Crater Lake Highway) and south and southeast of Dutton Road. This unit&nbsp;
provides the easternmost extent of the species' range in Oregon&nbsp;
(criterion 1). It represents a significant component of the species'&nbsp;
original range in the State and is of a sufficient size to sustain the&nbsp;
natural ecosystem processes (e.g., fires) that have historically&nbsp;
influenced vernal pool habitat (Borgias 2003). The largest and&nbsp;
easternmost of the subunits occurs just to the east and north of Agate&nbsp;
Lake. It is separated by more than 1 mi (1.6 km) from Unit 3, White&nbsp;
City West, and by approximately 3.5 mi (5.6 km) from the North Agate&nbsp;
Desert Unit.

Unit 3A, B, and C, White City West Unit, Jackson County (2,301 ac (931&nbsp;
ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit consists of three subunits, located west of Agate Road,&nbsp;
south of the Rogue River, and east of Bear Creek. This unit contains&nbsp;
the least fragmented intact examples of the original Agate Desert&nbsp;
mounded vernal pool grassland habitat (criterion 3). It is of&nbsp;
sufficient size to sustain the natural ecosystem processes (e.g.,&nbsp;
fires) that have historically influenced vernal pool habitat; it is&nbsp;
separated from the White City East Unit by more than 1 mi (1.6 km) and&nbsp;
from the Table Rocks Unit by over 1.5 mi (2.4 km).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We believe that, taken together, the designated Agate Desert units&nbsp;
(Units 1-3) comprise a functional vernal pool complex consisting of&nbsp;
vernal pools, mounded grassland and associated uplands, where natural&nbsp;
processes, including connectivity, function within or near the natural&nbsp;
range of variability. Each of the three designated Agate Desert units&nbsp;
is essential to the conservation of vernal pool fairy shrimp in the&nbsp;
Agate Desert.

Unit 4A and B, Table Rocks Unit, Jackson County (892 ac (361 ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit consists of two subunits, located on two flat-topped&nbsp;
mesas known as Upper and Lower Table Rocks, situated north and west of&nbsp;
the Rogue River. These rimrock features are remnants of ancient lava&nbsp;
flows that filled portions of the Rogue River nearly 10 million years&nbsp;
ago (BLM 1998). Subsequent erosion of softer geologic layers has left&nbsp;
these harder andesite (volcanic rock) formations rising some 800 ft&nbsp;
(245 m) above the present Rogue Valley. Vernal pools on the Table Rocks&nbsp;
differ from those of the Agate Desert, in that they are formed over an&nbsp;
impervious layer of bedrock. This unit represents a unique habitat for&nbsp;
vernal pool fairy shrimp in Oregon (criterion 2). The Table Rocks Unit&nbsp;
is disjunct from the North Agate Desert Unit by over 2 mi (3.2 km), and&nbsp;
from the White City West Unit by approximately 1.5 mi (2.4 km).

California

Unit 5, Redding Unit, Shasta County (3,666 ac (1,485 ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit contains the largest intact vernal pool habitat in the&nbsp;
Sacramento Valley and represents the northern portion of vernal pool&nbsp;
fairy shrimp's range in California (criteria 1 and 4).

[[Page 46725]]

Occurrences of the species (CNDDB 2002) within vernal pools mapped by&nbsp;
Holland (1998) are found on old alluvial terraces above the Sacramento&nbsp;
River and often on Redding and Corning soil complexes (Shasta County&nbsp;
2001). Generally these pools are small in size, although the Stillwater&nbsp;
Plains area supports unique pools that are several acres in size.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of the land included within this unit is privately owned. The&nbsp;
BLM owns 41 ac (17 ha) within this unit, and 130 ac (52 ha) of private&nbsp;
land is protected under conservation easement or agreement as part of&nbsp;
the WRP. The Stillwater Plains Conservation Bank, specifically&nbsp;
established to contribute to the recovery of vernal pool fairy shrimp,&nbsp;
is located within this unit, thereby increasing the likelihood that the&nbsp;
unit will persist (criterion 4). The City of Redding and other local&nbsp;
and State planning organizations are currently developing an HCP to&nbsp;
provide for the conservation of vernal pool fairy shrimp. This unit&nbsp;
would provide an area where conservation efforts for vernal pool fairy&nbsp;
shrimp could take place.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit is located in the area east of the Redding Municipal&nbsp;
Airport between Airport Road to the west and Deschutes Road to the&nbsp;
east. The unit extends to Dersch Road in the south and towards Lassen&nbsp;
Park Highway in the north. This unit comprises a portion of the&nbsp;
Stillwater Plains.

Unit 6, Red Bluff Unit, Tehama County (39,629 ac (16,038 ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit contains vernal pools formed on alluvial terraces west of&nbsp;
the Sacramento River and associated with Newville/Corning and Redding/
Corning soil complexes (USDA 2001) exhibiting well-developed mima mound&nbsp;
topography. The vernal pools within this unit are generally small and&nbsp;
may not be inundated long enough to support other longer-lived vernal&nbsp;
pool species.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit contains several large (e.g., over 10,000 ac (4,068 ha))&nbsp;
vernal pool habitat complexes. These areas are relatively undisturbed,&nbsp;
hydrologically intact vernal pool habitats that will likely continue to&nbsp;
support natural vernal pool ecosystem processes and maintain suitable&nbsp;
habitat conditions for vernal pool fairy shrimp (criterion 4). This&nbsp;
unit also provides essential habitat for migratory waterfowl that aid&nbsp;
in the dispersal of vernal fairy shrimp and other vernal pool&nbsp;
crustacean cysts (criterion 3).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The majority of the lands included within this unit are privately&nbsp;
owned, although CDFG owns 430 ac (174 ha ) within this unit. This unit&nbsp;
also contains large private conservation areas established specifically&nbsp;
to contribute to the recovery of vernal pool fairy shrimp and&nbsp;
compensate for the loss of vernal pool habitat, including the 5,000-ac&nbsp;
(2,023-ha) Tehama Fiber Farm mitigation area (criterion 4). CDFG's&nbsp;
Thomes Creek Ecological Reserve is also located within this unit.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit extends from southwest of Red Bluff at Red Bank Creek&nbsp;
south to Thomes Creek. The eastern boundary includes the vernal pool&nbsp;
habitat from the Southern Pacific Railroad near Coyote Creek south&nbsp;
paralleling Interstate 5 to Thomes Creek.

Unit 7, Vina Plains Unit, Tehama and Butte Counties (48,588 ac (19,663&nbsp;
ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit contains Northern Volcanic Mudflow vernal pools. These&nbsp;
pools are generally small and tend to be inundated for relatively short&nbsp;
periods of time. Vernal pool fairy shrimp are also found within larger&nbsp;
vernal pools forming on hardpans within this unit. These pools tend to&nbsp;
be larger and longer lasting than Northern Volcanic Mudflow pools,&nbsp;
providing a variety of habitats available for the species to expand and&nbsp;
contract in size and place over time.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pool types within this unit maintain the diversity of habitats&nbsp;
in which vernal pool fairy shrimp are known to occur and provide&nbsp;
relatively undisturbed, hydrologically intact vernal pool habitats that&nbsp;
will likely continue to support natural vernal pool ecosystem processes&nbsp;
and maintain suitable habitat conditions for vernal pool fairy shrimp&nbsp;
(criterion 4). This unit also provides habitat for migratory waterfowl&nbsp;
that aid in the dispersal of vernal pool fairy shrimp and other vernal&nbsp;
pool crustacean cysts (criterion 3).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The majority of the lands included within this unit are privately&nbsp;
owned. This unit contains TNC's Vina Plains preserve as well as other&nbsp;
TNC lands (5,660 ac (2,264 ha)) and conservation easements (10,870 ac&nbsp;
(4,348 ha)), thereby increasing the likelihood that the habitat will&nbsp;
persist (criterion 4). Other ownership within this unit includes 142 ac&nbsp;
(57 ha) of private land protected under conservation easement or&nbsp;
agreement under the NRCS's WRP.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit is located in the northeastern portion of the Sacramento&nbsp;
Valley from Deer Creek in Tehama County to Chico in Butte County. The&nbsp;
unit extends south and east of the Sacramento River paralleling the low&nbsp;
elevation foothill region of the Sierra Nevada and represents the&nbsp;
northeastern extent of vernal pool fairy shrimp's range in California.

Unit 8, Orland Unit, Tehama County (12,676 ac (5,130 ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit contains vernal pools formed on alluvial terraces of&nbsp;
Northern Hardpan formations west of the Sacramento River and associated&nbsp;
with Anita clay and Tuscan loam soils (USDA 1994). These vernal pools&nbsp;
are generally small and exhibit well-developed mima mound topography.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit contains large vernal pool habitat areas in the&nbsp;
northwestern portion of the range of vernal pool fairy shrimp&nbsp;
(criterion 1). These areas provide relatively undisturbed,&nbsp;
hydrologically intact vernal pool habitats that will likely continue to&nbsp;
support natural vernal pool ecosystem processes and maintain suitable&nbsp;
habitat conditions for vernal pool fairy shrimp (criterion 4).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit extends from the Tehama/Glenn County border in the south,&nbsp;
west of Ingrahm Road and east of the Black Butte Reservoir, to the&nbsp;
vicinity of Rice Creek in the north. It also contains a Pacific Gas and&nbsp;
Electric pipeline mitigation area established specifically for the&nbsp;
conservation of vernal pool fairy shrimp.

Unit 11, Beale Unit, Yuba County (1,324 ac (536 ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit is adjacent to Beale AFB which contains large, relatively&nbsp;
undisturbed vernal pool grassland habitats and an unusual diversity of&nbsp;
vernal pool habitat types supporting vernal pool fairy shrimp (Jones&nbsp;
and Stokes 1997b; Platenkamp 1998; CNDDB 2001; Jones and Stokes 2002).&nbsp;
Vernal pool fairy shrimp within the area are found throughout several&nbsp;
large vernal pool complexes of which this unit is a part. These&nbsp;
complexes occur on four major geologic formations: the Modesto&nbsp;
Formation, the Riverbank Formation, the Laguna Formation, and the&nbsp;
Mehrten Formation (Platenkamp 1998). Different geologic formations&nbsp;
provide a diversity of habitats for vernal pool fairy shrimp primarily&nbsp;
through their effects on pool size and depth (Helm 1998; Platenkamp&nbsp;
1998). The unit, therefore, represents an important subsection of the&nbsp;
ecological diversity of the species (criterion 2).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The critical habitat boundary identified in the proposed rule&nbsp;
included a portion of Beale AFB. Since the portion of land within the&nbsp;
base has been excluded based on the benefits of exclusion versus&nbsp;
benefits of inclusion, this unit only covers those areas adjacent to&nbsp;
the base which provide the necessary habitat characteristics to support&nbsp;
the species. All the lands within this unit are privately owned. This&nbsp;
unit is found east of Yuba City and

[[Page 46726]]

State Highway 65, generally south of Hammonton Road and north of South&nbsp;
Beale Road and 6th Street adjacent to Beale AFB.

Unit 12, Western Placer County Unit (32,230 ac (13,043 ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Western Placer Unit contains numerous occurrences of the&nbsp;
species (CNDDB 2002) within functionally intact vernal pool complexes.&nbsp;
Vernal pool fairy shrimp within this unit occur in both Northern&nbsp;
Hardpan and Northern Volcanic Mudflow vernal pools as described by&nbsp;
Sawyer and Keeler-Wolf (1995). This unit also supports vernal pool&nbsp;
fairy shrimp found in vernal pools on Exchequer soils on the Mehrten&nbsp;
geologic formation, a rare type of Northern Volcanic Mudflow vernal&nbsp;
pool which has been reduced to only a few acres within Placer County&nbsp;
(criterion 2). The pools are relatively short-lived and do not provide&nbsp;
habitat for most other species of fairy shrimp (CNDDB 2002).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit includes a large number of conservation areas established&nbsp;
specifically to contribute to the recovery of vernal pool fairy shrimp,&nbsp;
and partly established through conservation efforts under section 7 of&nbsp;
the Act. It is, therefore, more likely to maintain its occupied habitat&nbsp;
over time (criterion 4). These protected areas include the Ahart&nbsp;
Preserve, one of the few remaining examples of Northern Volcanic&nbsp;
Mudflow vernal pools in the region (criterion 2), as well as the&nbsp;
Orchard Creek Conservation Bank. This conservation bank was established&nbsp;
for the protection of vernal pool fairy shrimp, and to compensate for&nbsp;
the loss of thousands of acres of vernal pool grassland habitats&nbsp;
throughout Placer and Sacramento Counties. Additional smaller&nbsp;
conservation areas in this unit are located within the cities of&nbsp;
Lincoln and Roseville, and in Placer County. Approximately 20 percent&nbsp;
of all mitigation areas established for the long-term protection of&nbsp;
vernal pool fairy shrimp are found within this unit. Placer County is&nbsp;
currently developing a NCCP/HCP for the conservation of vernal pool&nbsp;
fairy shrimp in this area. A WRP easement of 157 ac (63 ha) for the&nbsp;
protection of wetland resources occurs within this unit.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Western Placer Unit contains 70 percent of the remaining vernal&nbsp;
pool habitats in Placer County. TNC identified this area as one of the&nbsp;
outstanding vernal pool sites remaining in the Sacramento Valley&nbsp;
(criterion 4). This unit generally occurs in western Placer County&nbsp;
immediately north of the Sacramento County line, north of the City of&nbsp;
Roseville, and northeast of the City of Rocklin. The northern boundary&nbsp;
occurs just north of the City of Lincoln. This unit occurs mostly west&nbsp;
of State Highway 65.

Unit 17, Napa River Unit, Napa and Sonoma Counties (1,554 ac (629 ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Napa River unit represents the western extent of the species'&nbsp;
range (criterion 1). This unit represents the only area where vernal&nbsp;
pool fairy shrimp occur in vernal pool habitats forming a transition&nbsp;
zone with tidal marshes (criterion 2). The boundaries of this unit were&nbsp;
designed to include vernal pool complexes mapped by Holland (1998) and&nbsp;
within the Fagan Marsh Ecological Area owned by CDFG (901 ac (420 ha)).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Napa River parallels the western boundary of this unit. This&nbsp;
unit is located on private and CDFG land, including the Napa-Sonoma&nbsp;
Marsh and Fagan Marsh Wildlife Areas. Most of this unit is situated&nbsp;
south and southwest of the City of Napa, primarily west of Highway 29,&nbsp;
south of Highway 12, and east of Highway 121. This unit forms a narrow&nbsp;
strip following the northwestern banks of the Napa River and extending&nbsp;
westward along Hudeman and Schell sloughs.

Unit 18, San Joaquin Unit, San Joaquin County (14,343 ac (5,805 ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit contains vernal pool habitats identified by Holland&nbsp;
(1998) and San Joaquin County (1998) that support populations of vernal&nbsp;
pool fairy shrimp (CNDDB 2002) found within Northern Volcanic Mudflow&nbsp;
vernal pools on the Laguna geologic formation, as well as high terrace&nbsp;
pools on the Valley Springs geologic formation. The Northern Volcanic&nbsp;
Mudflow vernal pools tend to be short-lived, and are a relatively rare&nbsp;
habitat type for vernal pool fairy shrimp (criterion 2). This unit&nbsp;
contains the largest vernal pool complex remaining in San Joaquin&nbsp;
County and the southern Sacramento Valley (criterion 1).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit occupies the area from the Calaveras River south to Duck&nbsp;
Creek. The eastern boundary extends to near Valley Springs at the&nbsp;
intersection of State routes 12 and 26. The western boundary extends to&nbsp;
near Tully Road east of the City of Lodi.

Unit 19A, B, and C, Altamont Hills Unit, Contra Costa, and Alameda&nbsp;
Counties (7,902 ac (3,198 ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit contains vernal pool habitats mapped by Holland (1998)&nbsp;
and East Bay Regional Parks District (2001) supporting vernal pool&nbsp;
fairy shrimp occurrences identified by CNDDB (2002) within unique&nbsp;
sandstone outcrops. These habitats include very small (less than 3.3 ft&nbsp;
(1 m) in diameter) clear water depression pools in sandstone outcrops&nbsp;
which provide the necessary inundation to support vernal pool fairy&nbsp;
shrimp (Eriksen and Belk 1999). The unit represents the only known&nbsp;
location that supports vernal pool fairy shrimp within sandstone&nbsp;
outcrop pools (criterion 2) (Eriksen and Belk 1999).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The unit is comprised of three subunits in the general vicinity of&nbsp;
Mount Diablo and Morgan Territory Regional Park. The unit primarily&nbsp;
consists of private land, with 108 ac (44 ha) owned by the State, and&nbsp;
an additional 711 ac (288 ha) administered by the CDFG for conservation&nbsp;
purposes.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The unit lies north of Corral Hollow Road, west of Clifton Court&nbsp;
Forebay, east of the City of Danville, southeast of Concord, and south&nbsp;
of Antioch. It includes vernal pool habitat within the Altamont Hills,&nbsp;
around the northern and eastern boundaries of the City of Livermore,&nbsp;
and east of the Altamont Hills and west of Clifton Court Forebay.

Unit 21, Stanislaus Unit, Stanislaus and Merced Counties (48,599 ac&nbsp;
(19,668 ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit contains occurrences of the species within large,&nbsp;
relatively intact, and contiguous vernal pool complexes ranging from&nbsp;
the floor of the valley to the low-elevation foothills (Holland 1998;&nbsp;
CNDDB 2001). These areas are essential to the conservation of vernal&nbsp;
pool fairy shrimp because they provide relatively undisturbed,&nbsp;
hydrologically intact vernal pool habitats that will likely continue to&nbsp;
support natural vernal pool ecosystem processes and maintain suitable&nbsp;
habitat conditions for vernal pool fairy shrimp (criterion 4). This&nbsp;
unit contains vernal pool fairy shrimp living within hardpan pools that&nbsp;
occur on soils of alluvial fans and terraces forming numerous small&nbsp;
pools and swales on mima mound topography. Soils supporting these&nbsp;
vernal pools are typically older than those of the alluvial terraces in&nbsp;
the Sacramento area.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Stanislaus Unit is in the northern portion of the chain of&nbsp;
vernal pools that runs through the southern Sierra Nevada foothills,&nbsp;
within the Southern Sierra Foothill vernal pool region described by&nbsp;
Keeler-Wolf et al. (1998). This vernal pool region contains 35 percent&nbsp;
of all remaining vernal pool habitat in the Central Valley, and is&nbsp;
extremely important to the conservation of vernal pool fairy shrimp and&nbsp;
other vernal pool species (criterion 1 and 2). Land ownership within&nbsp;
this unit includes the BLM (7 ha (17 ac)) and California State Parks&nbsp;
(61 ac (25 ha). The well-known Hickman vernal pool complex is located&nbsp;
within this unit as well as Hickman Pool, one of the largest

[[Page 46727]]

vernal lakes in California, at more than 300 ac (121 ha) (Medeiros&nbsp;
2000).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Stanislaus Unit is located in the southeast corner of&nbsp;
Stanislaus County and the northeast corner of Merced County. It lies&nbsp;
between the Tuolumne River and the Merced River. The Mariposa County&nbsp;
line is located east of the unit. Turlock Lake and Dawson Lake are&nbsp;
adjacent to the northern boundary. County Road J9 and the High Line&nbsp;
Canal are west of the unit.

Unit 22, Merced Unit, Merced and Mariposa Counties (111,459 ac (45,108&nbsp;
ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit encompasses the largest block of pristine, high density&nbsp;
vernal pool grasslands supporting the species remaining in California&nbsp;
(criterion 4) (Holland 1998; Vollmar 1999; CNDDB 2001). There are more&nbsp;
documented occurrences of vernal pool fairy shrimp in this unit than&nbsp;
any other area throughout the species range, implying it contains&nbsp;
ecological features that are unusually supportive of vernal pool fairy&nbsp;
shrimp populations (criterion 2) (CNDDB 2002). Almost 15 percent of all&nbsp;
remaining vernal pool habitats in the Central Valley are located within&nbsp;
this unit (criterion 1) (Holland 1998).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Merced Unit is located midway in a chain of vernal pool&nbsp;
complexes that straddles the valley floor and the foothills of the&nbsp;
southern Sierra Nevada. Forty percent of vernal pool habitats in the&nbsp;
Southern Sierra Foothill vernal pool region are found within this unit&nbsp;
(criterion 1). This unit helps to maintain connectivity between vernal&nbsp;
pool fairy shrimp habitats on the valley floor and habitats to the&nbsp;
north and south of the Merced Unit (criterion 4).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A majority of vernal pool habitat in the Merced Unit is in Merced&nbsp;
County. The eastern edge of the unit overlaps into Mariposa County.&nbsp;
Bear Creek flows along the southern boundary of the unit, crossing&nbsp;
through it in several locations. The City of Merced is south of the&nbsp;
unit, Bear Reservoir is southeast of the unit, and the Castle Airport&nbsp;
is located outside of the southwest boundary. The northern boundary&nbsp;
parallels the Merced River. The entire unit is located east of Highway&nbsp;
99. Land ownership within the unit includes mostly private lands and&nbsp;
approximately 8 ac (3 ha) of BLM lands. TNC has a total of 11,283 ac&nbsp;
(4,513 ha) of conservation easements within this unit.

Unit 24B, Madera Unit, Fresno Counties (41,032 ac (16,606 ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Madera Unit contains occurrences of the species living within&nbsp;
hardpan vernal pool complexes composed of numerous small pools and&nbsp;
swales on mima mound topography (Holland 1998; Keeler-Wolf et al. 1998;&nbsp;
CNDDB 2001). These vernal pools occur on alluvial fans and terraces.&nbsp;
South of this unit, in Fresno County, these pools become less common,&nbsp;
because the soils that support them are less widespread (Keeler-Wolf et&nbsp;
al. 1998).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Located in western Madera County, this unit is located between the&nbsp;
Fresno River and San Joaquin River. All lands within this unit are&nbsp;
privately owned. All vernal pools in this unit are located east of&nbsp;
Highway 99 and the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railroad, extending&nbsp;
east toward the low-elevation foothill region of the Sierra Nevada.&nbsp;
State Route 145 bisects the unit.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit consists of two subunits. Subunit A contains vernal pool&nbsp;
habitats south of Millerton Lake. The western boundary of this unit is&nbsp;
bordered by the San Joaquin River. Gordon Road cuts through the&nbsp;
southernmost tip of the unit. Owens Mountain and Table Mountain&nbsp;
Rancheria are located east of the Unit. The Friant Kern Canal crosses&nbsp;
through the unit in a southeasterly direction. Subunit B is located&nbsp;
mostly west of State Route 41 along Little Dry Creek and Cottonwood&nbsp;
Creek.

Unit 26A, B, and C, Cross Creek Unit, Tulare and Kings Counties (7,579&nbsp;
ac (3,067 ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit contains vernal pools that support occurrences of the&nbsp;
species (Holland 1998; CNDDB 2001) formed on Lewis and Youd soils (USDA&nbsp;
2001). This area represents the southern extent of vernal pool fairy&nbsp;
shrimp range along the eastern margin of the Central Valley, and is the&nbsp;
largest contiguous vernal pool habitat in this region (criteria 1 and&nbsp;
4) (Holland 1998; CNDDB 2001).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit contains CDFG's Sequoia Field and Stone Corral Ecological&nbsp;
Reserves in Tulare County. These reserves are one of the few vernal&nbsp;
pool conservation areas in the eastern portion of the San Joaquin&nbsp;
Valley, and they have been the focus of several monitoring and&nbsp;
management efforts (criterion 4). Land ownership within this unit&nbsp;
includes 213 ac (86 ha) of CDFG lands. All other land within this unit&nbsp;
is privately owned. TNC, Tulare County, and the Sierra Los Tulares Land&nbsp;
Trust have identified this area as one of the best remaining examples&nbsp;
of vernal pool habitats in the region. Much of the remaining vernal&nbsp;
pool habitat within Tulare County has been severely degraded and&nbsp;
converted.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit is comprised of three subunits. Subunit A is located in&nbsp;
northwest Tulare County and contains vernal pool habitat located west&nbsp;
of Seville. The Friant Kern Canal is north of the unit and the&nbsp;
Cottonwood Creek Levee is south of the unit. Road 140 runs west of the&nbsp;
unit. Subunit B contains vernal pools in northeastern Kings County and&nbsp;
northwestern Tulare County. Highway 99 and St. Johns River cut through&nbsp;
the unit in a southeasterly direction. Cross Creek and Cottonwood Creek&nbsp;
cut through the unit in a southwesterly direction. Road 112 is east of&nbsp;
the unit and the Lakeland Canal is west of the unit. The towns of&nbsp;
Goshen and Visalia are south of the unit and Traver and London are&nbsp;
north of the unit. Subunit C is known as Sequoia Field Unit and is&nbsp;
located in northwestern Tulare County. This unit is south of County&nbsp;
Road J36. Road 112 crosses through the western edge of the unit, Avenue&nbsp;
352 crosses through the southern edge, and State Route 63 crosses&nbsp;
through the eastern edge.

Unit 27A and B, Pixley Unit, Tulare County (16,706 ac (6,761 ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit contains the largest contiguous area of habitat for the&nbsp;
species in the southern portion of the San Joaquin Valley (criteria 1&nbsp;
and 4) (Holland 1998; CNDDB 2001). Vernal pool fairy shrimp in this&nbsp;
area occur within Northern Claypan vernal pools that tend to be&nbsp;
alkaline and larger than other vernal pool fairy shrimp habitats, such&nbsp;
as those found on the eastern margin of the San Joaquin Valley&nbsp;
(criterion 2).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit contains wintering areas for migratory waterfowl,&nbsp;
shorebirds, marsh, and waterbirds in the southern San Joaquin Valley,&nbsp;
and includes natural valley grasslands and developed marsh habitats&nbsp;
within the Pixley National Wildlife Refuge complex (3,366 ac (1,362&nbsp;
ha)) (criterion 4). Other ownership within this unit include TNC lands&nbsp;
(3,274 ac (1,309 ha)). All other lands within this unit are privately&nbsp;
owned. These habitats are important for migratory waterfowl that aid in&nbsp;
the dispersal of vernal pool fairy shrimp and other vernal pool&nbsp;
crustacean cysts (criterion 3). This unit represents one of only three&nbsp;
areas designated for vernal pool fairy shrimp in the San Joaquin Valley&nbsp;
vernal pool region described by Keeler-Wolf et al. (1998) (criterion&nbsp;
1).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit consists of two subunits that lie south of the Cities of&nbsp;
Hanford and Lemoore, north of the City of Wasco, and east of the City&nbsp;
of the Tulare. In addition to vernal pool fairy shrimp, western&nbsp;
spadefoot toad and California tiger salamander are present within this&nbsp;
unit.

[[Page 46728]]

Unit 28, San Benito County Unit, San Benito and Monterey Counties&nbsp;
(118,869 (48,125 ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The San Benito County Unit is located in the southwestern portion&nbsp;
of San Benito County and the easternmost portion of Monterey County.&nbsp;
Land ownership within this unit includes parcels that are managed by&nbsp;
the BLM (3,906 ac (1,581 ha)) and State Land Commission (5 ac (2 ha)).&nbsp;
All other lands within this unit are privately owned. The critical&nbsp;
habitat unit perimeter is defined by the presence of low slope areas&nbsp;
within watershed boundaries that are known to contain vernal pool&nbsp;
habitats and the primary constituent elements for vernal pool fairy&nbsp;
shrimp to occur. This unit consists of a distinct collection of&nbsp;
ephemerally flooded wetlands west of the Great Central Valley, and&nbsp;
overlaps a portion of the Central Coast vernal pool region that has&nbsp;
been delineated by CDFG (Keeler-Wolf et al. 1998). The unit contains a&nbsp;
minimum of 13 vernal pool complexes that are 17 to 356 ac (7 to 144 ha)&nbsp;
in size, and includes a number of unmapped vernal pools or pool&nbsp;
complexes that are less than 10 ac (4 ha) in size. Systematic surveys&nbsp;
designed to determine the presence and distribution of vernal pool&nbsp;
fairy shrimp have not been conducted for this unit. However, the&nbsp;
habitat in the 13 vernal complexes is likely to be similar to other&nbsp;
local habitats that are known to contain the species. Therefore, the&nbsp;
species is probably present in many of the pools in this unit.&nbsp;
Conservation of vernal pools in this unit is necessary to maintain and&nbsp;
restore occurrences of vernal pool fairy shrimp that are disjunct from&nbsp;
other listed fairy shrimp localities in the Great Central Valley&nbsp;
(criterion 1). The need for conserving vernal pool habitats within this&nbsp;
unit is further highlighted by the loss of eight large vernal pool&nbsp;
complexes totaling 3,155 ac (1,276 ha) outside of the critical habitat&nbsp;
unit in northern San Benito County between 1994 and 2000 (Holland&nbsp;
2003). Data from systematic surveys are not available for these areas,&nbsp;
but the loss of such a large area of ephemeral aquatic habitat is&nbsp;
symptomatic of the challenge currently facing the species.

Unit 29A, B, and C, Central Coastal Ranges Unit, Monterey and San Luis&nbsp;
Obispo Counties (51,825 ac (20,974 ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the sake of clarity, the Fort Hunter Liggett subunit described&nbsp;
in the proposed rule is now the Lockwood subunit in the final rule.&nbsp;
This reflects the removal of Fort Hunter Liggett lands from the final&nbsp;
rule. Also, the Camp Roberts subunit in the proposed rule is now the&nbsp;
Bradley-San Miguel subunit in the final rule. This reflects the removal&nbsp;
of Camp Roberts lands from the final critical habitat rule.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Central Coastal Ranges Unit includes three subunits that occur&nbsp;
in Monterey and San Luis Obispo Counties. The three subunits include&nbsp;
areas adjacent to the town of Lockwood, the towns of Bradley and San&nbsp;
Miguel, and the City of Paso Robles.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Lockwood subunit (29A) includes a single parcel that is located&nbsp;
directly east of the Fort Hunter Liggett military base. Land ownership&nbsp;
in the subunit is mostly private, and includes a 2-ac (1-ha) parcel&nbsp;
managed by the BLM. Intensive surveys on Fort Hunter Liggett document&nbsp;
the occurrence of listed fairy shrimp in a minimum of 65 pools within&nbsp;
the base boundary (Fort Hunter Liggett 2000). The Lockwood subunit is&nbsp;
present within one or more hydrologic units that contribute to the&nbsp;
amount, duration, and frequency of water flow that is necessary to&nbsp;
maintain seasonally flooded habitats that possess vernal pool fairy&nbsp;
shrimp at Fort Hunter Liggett.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bradley-San Miguel subunit (29B) consists of five separate&nbsp;
parcels that are privately owned. Four of these parcels are located&nbsp;
immediately adjacent to the northern or eastern boundary of the Camp&nbsp;
Roberts military base, and the fifth is immediately adjacent to the&nbsp;
western boundary of the base. Surveys on Camp Roberts document the&nbsp;
presence of vernal pool fairy shrimp at 61 sites (Jones and Stokes&nbsp;
Associates 1997a). The Bradley-San Miguel subunit is present within one&nbsp;
or more hydrologic units that contribute to the amount, duration, and&nbsp;
frequency of water flow that is necessary to maintain seasonally&nbsp;
flooded habitats that possess vernal pool fairy shrimp on the Camp&nbsp;
Roberts military base.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Paso Robles subunit (29C) consists of a polygon that is 2 to 15&nbsp;
mi (3.2 to 24 km) northeast of the Paso Robles city boundary. All of&nbsp;
the land within this subunit is privately owned. Surveys along State&nbsp;
Highway 46 document the occurrence of vernal pool fairy shrimp within&nbsp;
the subunit (Mitch Dallas, Catrans, pers. comm.). The Paso Robles&nbsp;
subunit possesses several large vernal pool complexes that are 105-776&nbsp;
ac (42-314 ha) in size. The discovery of vernal pool fairy shrimp in an&nbsp;
area 4 mi (6 km) east of Paso Robles suggests that the species is&nbsp;
likely to be widely dispersed in remnant vernal pools or complexes that&nbsp;
still exist within the critical habitat subunit. The Paso Robles&nbsp;
subunit perimeter is defined by the presence of low slope areas within&nbsp;
watershed boundaries that are known to contain vernal pool fairy shrimp&nbsp;
and vernal pool habitats.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Lockwood subunit occurs within the Central Coast vernal pool&nbsp;
region that has been delineated by the CDFG (Keeler-Wolf et al. 1998),&nbsp;
and the Bradley-San Miguel and Paso Robles subunits occur within the&nbsp;
Carrizo vernal pool region. Conservation of vernal pools in the region&nbsp;
is necessary to stabilize and recover remnant populations of vernal&nbsp;
pool fairy shrimp in the central coastal county area of southern&nbsp;
California (criterion 1).

Unit 30, Carrizo Plain Unit, San Luis Obispo County (25,851 ac (10,466&nbsp;
ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit contains Northern Claypan vernal pools (Sawyer and&nbsp;
Keeler-Wolf 1995) in numerous shallow alkaline depressions within a&nbsp;
Valley Saltbush Scrub matrix. This is the only area where vernal pool&nbsp;
fairy shrimp are known from saline salt brush scrub vernal pool&nbsp;
habitats (criterion 2). Many vernal pools in the region are adjacent to&nbsp;
the 3,000 ac (1,214 ha) Soda Lake, the largest alkali wetland in&nbsp;
central and southern California, which provides a winter haven for&nbsp;
thousands of migratory birds that provide dispersal mechanisms for the&nbsp;
species (criterion 3). Vernal pool fairy shrimp in the Carrizo Plain&nbsp;
Unit are located 146 mi (235 km) southeast of the closest known&nbsp;
occurrences at Kesterson National Wildlife Refuge in Merced County, and&nbsp;
represent an unusual geographic area (criterion 1).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Carrizo Plain unit contains examples of native bunch grass,&nbsp;
needle grass, and blue grass uplands which assist in maintaining the&nbsp;
hydrology of the vernal pools and vernal pool complexes. Most of the&nbsp;
habitat within this unit is part of the Carrizo Plain National&nbsp;
Monument, which is administered by BLM, TNC, and CDFG for the&nbsp;
protection of natural habitat (criterion 4). BLM lands within the unit&nbsp;
total approximately 15,549 ac (6,293 ha) and CDFG lands total&nbsp;
approximately 233 ac (93 ha). Other vernal pool habitats in the unit&nbsp;
are located on private land.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit includes vernal pool habitat in the interior basin of the&nbsp;
Carrizo Plain. It encompasses California Valley and Soda Lake. State&nbsp;
Highway 58 is located north of the unit. Most of the habitat is east of&nbsp;
Soda Lake Road; however, Soda Lake Road crosses through the western&nbsp;
edge of the unit in several areas. To the east, the unit is bordered by&nbsp;
the San Andreas Rift Zone.

[[Page 46729]]

Unit 31, Lake Cachuma Area Unit, Santa Barbara County (20,754 ac (8,399&nbsp;
ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Lake Cachuma critical habitat unit is located within a 10 mi&nbsp;
(16 km) radius of the northwestern portion of Lake Cachuma in central&nbsp;
Santa Barbara County. Land ownership includes the U.S. Forest Service&nbsp;
(USFS) (5,434 ac (2,199 ha)) and BLM (92 ac (37 ha)). All other land&nbsp;
within the unit is privately owned. The unit boundary contains four&nbsp;
vernal pool complexes that are at least 10 ac (4 ha) in size (Holland&nbsp;
2003); these complexes vary in size from 40 to 199 ac (16 to 81 ha).&nbsp;
The unit also contains one documented occurrence of vernal pool fairy&nbsp;
shrimp. Limited survey data for fairy shrimp exist for this unit. We&nbsp;
believe listed fairy shrimp probably occur at several additional&nbsp;
locations with suitable ephemeral aquatic habitat. A portion of the&nbsp;
critical habitat unit overlaps the Santa Barbara vernal pool region&nbsp;
delineated by the CDFG (Keeler-Wolf et al. 1998). The Lake Cachuma unit&nbsp;
is essential for the conservation of vernal pool fairy shrimp because&nbsp;
it contains seasonally flooded aquatic habitats that are located at&nbsp;
least 36 mi (60 km) from other wetlands that are known to possess the&nbsp;
species. Compared to most counties mentioned in this rule, Santa&nbsp;
Barbara County contains a relatively small acreage of remaining vernal&nbsp;
pool habitat, thereby highlighting the need to proactively manage the&nbsp;
ephemeral aquatic habitats that still remain (criterion 1).

Unit 32, Ventura County Unit, Ventura County (46,531 ac (18,830 ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ventura County Unit is located in the north-central portion of&nbsp;
Ventura County. With the exception of 1,951 ac (790 ha) that are&nbsp;
privately owned, all other land within this unit occurs within the Los&nbsp;
Padres National Forest. Vernal pool fairy shrimp and Conservancy fairy&nbsp;
shrimp co-occur at relatively high-elevation (5,500 ft (1,700 m))&nbsp;
forested sites within this unit. This combination of attributes is&nbsp;
unique because these species normally occur at much lower elevations in&nbsp;
grassland habitat. The critical habitat perimeter encompasses an area&nbsp;
that is known to contain vernal pool and Conservancy fairy shrimp and&nbsp;
isolated pools that provide habitat for both species. Few fairy shrimp&nbsp;
surveys exist for this unit. However, listed fairy shrimp probably&nbsp;
occur at several additional locations with suitable ephemeral aquatic&nbsp;
habitat. The Ventura County Unit is essential for the conservation of&nbsp;
vernal pool fairy shrimp because it contains ephemeral aquatic&nbsp;
environments that are rarely associated with fairy shrimp, and the&nbsp;
occupied sites are disjunct from others, in that they are located at&nbsp;
least 36 mi (60 km) from the closest known site (criteria 1 and 2).

Vernal Pool Tadpole Shrimp

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vernal pool tadpole shrimp occurrences are known from Shasta County&nbsp;
to Tulare County, California, with an elevational variation of near 3 m&nbsp;
(10 ft) to near 150 m (500 ft). The vernal pool types and soils&nbsp;
associated with areas of concentration of vernal pool tadpole shrimp&nbsp;
differ greatly across the geographic range of the species; these&nbsp;
differences lead to different species compositions and environmental&nbsp;
conditions between vernal pool tadpole shrimp occurrences. Providing&nbsp;
for a mosaic of habitat types and conditions both between and among&nbsp;
vernal pool species is essential because it would include the full&nbsp;
extent of the physical and environmental conditions for the species&nbsp;
(Barclay and Knight 1984; Bauder and McMillan 1998; Fugate 1992 and&nbsp;
1998; Gonzales et al. 1996, Noss et al. 2002a, Noss et al. 2002b;&nbsp;
Platenkamp 1998; Zedler et al. 1979). The soils that contain&nbsp;
occurrences of vernal pool tadpole shrimp in the delineated units vary&nbsp;
significantly throughout the species' range. In the north, the rare&nbsp;
Northern Mudflow formation underlies vernal pools in Shasta and Tehema&nbsp;
Counties. Tehema and Butte Counties contain Northern Basalt Flow vernal&nbsp;
pools that are limited to ancient terraces and hilltops that comprise&nbsp;
some of the oldest geologic formations in California. Northern Volcanic&nbsp;
Mudflow vernal pools are delineated in Butte and Yuba Counties.&nbsp;
Throughout the Central Valley, the habitat ranges from high terrace&nbsp;
landforms to claypan and hardpan pool types. Northern Basalt Flow&nbsp;
vernal pools are found in Fresno County in the low elevation foothills.&nbsp;
In the Suisun Marsh area, vernal pool tadpole shrimp are found in the&nbsp;
saline-alkaline transition zone. The parent material of vernal pools&nbsp;
greatly influences species composition and hydrologic functioning of&nbsp;
the vernal pool (Hanes and Stromberg 1998; Holland and Jain 1981,&nbsp;
1988). Soils beneath vernal pools are extremely variable and are not&nbsp;
the same as soils mapped by soil surveys, but are usually undescribed&nbsp;
hydric inclusions which vary upon location (Holland and Dain 1990). The&nbsp;
primary constituent elements of critical habitat for vernal pool&nbsp;
tadpole shrimp are the habitat components that provide:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) Vernal pools, swales, and other ephemeral wetlands and&nbsp;
depressions of appropriate sizes and depths that typically become&nbsp;
inundated during winter rains and hold water for sufficient lengths of&nbsp;
time necessary for vernal pool tadpole shrimp incubation, reproduction,&nbsp;
dispersal, feeding, and sheltering, but which are dry during the summer&nbsp;
and do not necessarily fill with water every year, including but not&nbsp;
limited to, vernal pools on Redding and Corning soils on high terrace&nbsp;
landforms, and
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) The geographic, topographic, and edaphic features that support&nbsp;
aggregations or systems of hydrologically interconnected pools, swales,&nbsp;
and other ephemeral wetlands and depressions within a matrix of&nbsp;
surrounding uplands that together form hydrologically and ecologically&nbsp;
functional units called vernal pool complexes. These features&nbsp;
contribute to the filling and drying of the vernal pool and maintain&nbsp;
suitable periods of pool inundation, water quality, and soil moisture&nbsp;
for vernal pool crustacean hatching, growth and reproduction, and&nbsp;
dispersal, but not necessarily every year.

Unit 1, Stillwater Plains Unit, Shasta County (3,538 ac (1,432 ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit contains the species (CNDDB 2002) within vernal pools&nbsp;
mapped by Holland (1998) that are found on old alluvial terraces above&nbsp;
the Sacramento River, often on Redding and Corning soil complexes&nbsp;
(Shasta County 2001). Generally, these pools range in size from small&nbsp;
(30 ft <sup>2</sup> (10 m<sup>2</sup>)) to several acres (hectares) in&nbsp;
size at the Stillwater Plains area. This unit is geographically&nbsp;
important because it comprises the northern extent of the species range&nbsp;
in California (criterion 1). The vernal pool tadpole shrimp within this&nbsp;
unit were found to be genetically different from other populations,&nbsp;
particularly those in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada (King 1996).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit is located in the area east of the Redding Municipal&nbsp;
Airport between Airport Road to the west and Deschutes Road to the&nbsp;
east. The unit is north of Dersch Road and south of Lassen Park&nbsp;
Highway. This unit comprises a portion of the Stillwater Plains. This&nbsp;
unit includes the Stillwater Plains Conservation Bank. Most of the land&nbsp;
included within this unit is privately owned, but 130 ac (52 ha) of&nbsp;
that is protected by WRP easements or agreements. The BLM owns 42 ac&nbsp;
(17 ha).

Unit 2, Dales Unit, Shasta and Tehama Counties (33,975 ac (13,750 ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit is ecologically important because it is one of the few&nbsp;
areas where vernal pool tadpole shrimp are known

[[Page 46730]]

to occur in Northern Mudflow vernal pools (criterion 2). Northern&nbsp;
Mudflow vernal pools are generally small and tend to be inundated for&nbsp;
relatively short periods of time (Keeler-Wolf et al. 1998). This unit&nbsp;
contains some of the largest remaining vernal pool complexes supporting&nbsp;
vernal pool tadpole shrimp in the northern portion of the species'&nbsp;
range, including the Dales Plains. These areas provide relatively&nbsp;
undisturbed, hydrologically intact vernal pool habitats that will&nbsp;
likely continue to support natural vernal pool ecosystem processes and&nbsp;
maintain suitable habitat conditions for vernal pool tadpole shrimp&nbsp;
(criterion 4). The unit also provides habitat for migratory waterfowl&nbsp;
that aid in the dispersal of vernal pool tadpole shrimp and other&nbsp;
vernal pool crustacean cysts (criterion 3).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Dales Unit is located in northern Tehema County. A portion of&nbsp;
the unit overlaps into Shasta County. The vernal pool habitats west of&nbsp;
Inskip Hill are included in this unit, as well as the area west of the&nbsp;
Sacramento River known as Table Mountain and Table Mountain Lake. Land&nbsp;
ownership within this unit includes BLM (14,826 ac (6,000 ha)) and&nbsp;
State lands 709 ac (287 ha). CDFG administers approximately 42 ac (17&nbsp;
ha) and TNC has conservation easements on 15,575 ac (6,230 ha) within&nbsp;
this unit. The remaining lands are privately owned.

Unit 3, Vina Plains Unit, Tehama and Butte Counties (31,195 ac (12,916&nbsp;
ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit is ecologically important (criterion 2) because it is one&nbsp;
of the few areas where vernal pool tadpole shrimp are known to occur in&nbsp;
Northern Basalt Flow vernal pools. Northern Basalt Flow vernal pools&nbsp;
are limited to ancient terraces and hilltops that comprise some of the&nbsp;
oldest geologic formations in California. This unit also provides&nbsp;
habitat for migratory waterfowl that aid in the dispersal of vernal&nbsp;
pool tadpole shrimp and other vernal pool crustacean cysts (criterion&nbsp;
3).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit is located in the northeastern portion of the Sacramento&nbsp;
Valley, from south of Deer Creek in Tehama County to Big Chico Creek&nbsp;
north of Chico in Butte County. The unit is geographically important&nbsp;
(criterion 1) because it is one of only two vernal pool tadpole shrimp&nbsp;
units within the Northeastern Sacramento Valley vernal pool region&nbsp;
identified by CDFG (Keeler-Wolf et al. 1998). The unit extends south&nbsp;
and east of the Sacramento River, paralleling the low-elevation&nbsp;
foothill region of the Sierra Nevada. A majority of the lands included&nbsp;
within this unit are privately owned. This unit may be more likely to&nbsp;
support the species over time (criterion 4) because it includes&nbsp;
protected areas such as TNC's Vina Plains preserve as well as other TNC&nbsp;
lands 5,660 (2,264 ha) and conservation easements 10,870 ac (4,348 ha).&nbsp;
The unit also includes 142 ac (57 ha) of private lands protected by WRP&nbsp;
easements or agreements.

Unit 6, Dolan Unit, Colusa County (980 ac (397 ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit, like Unit 5, is noteworthy for its Northern Claypan&nbsp;
vernal pools, as defined by Sawyer and Keeler-Wolf (1995). These vernal&nbsp;
pools occur on alkaline soils and typically form alkali playas which&nbsp;
are larger and contain a more diverse species composition than the&nbsp;
hardpan pools further south (criterion 2) (Keeler-Wolf et al. 1998).&nbsp;
They may display white salt deposits following pool drying.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit occurs east of Interstate 5, south of the City of Colusa,&nbsp;
and west of the Colusa National Wildlife Refuge. All the lands within&nbsp;
this unit are privately owned. This unit is primarily located on the&nbsp;
Dolan Ranch Conservation bank.

Unit 7, Beale Unit, Yuba County (1,324 ac (536 ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Beale Unit is ecologically important (criterion 2) because it&nbsp;
contains vernal pool grasslands occurring on four major geologic&nbsp;
formations: the Modesto Formation; the Riverbank Formation; the Laguna&nbsp;
Formation; and the Mehrten Formation. Different geologic formations&nbsp;
provide a diversity of habitats for vernal pool tadpole shrimp&nbsp;
primarily through their effects on pool size and depth (Helm 1998;&nbsp;
Platenkamp 1998). King (1996) found that vernal pool tadpole shrimp&nbsp;
within this unit were genetically different from occurrences in other&nbsp;
portions of the species' range, particularly those on the floor of the&nbsp;
Central Valley. This unit is also important because it can help&nbsp;
maintain an opportunity for long-distance dispersal of vernal pool&nbsp;
tadpole shrimp cysts (criterion 3); the nearest unit to the north is&nbsp;
over 28 mi (45 km) away, and the nearest unit to the south is over 40&nbsp;
mi (65 km) away.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Beale Unit is located in southwestern Yuba County, south of the&nbsp;
Yuba River and Yuba Goldfields, east of State Route 70, and north of&nbsp;
the Bear River adjacent to Beale AFB. All the lands within this unit&nbsp;
are privately owned.

Unit 9, Cosumnes Unit, Sacramento, Amador, and San Joaquin Counties&nbsp;
(26,754 ac (10,827 ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit is geographically important because it contains over 30&nbsp;
percent of the remaining vernal pool habitats in the southern&nbsp;
Sacramento Valley area (Holland 1998; Sacramento County 1999). It is&nbsp;
also ecologically noteworthy (criterion 2) because it includes a&nbsp;
diversity of pool types occupied by the species, including Northern&nbsp;
Volcanic Mudflow vernal pools on the Mehrten and Valley Springs&nbsp;
geologic formation overlain by Pardee and Pentz soils, vernal pools&nbsp;
occurring on low terrace landforms associated with San Joaquin soils,&nbsp;
and high terrace landforms associated with Redding and Corning soils&nbsp;
(USDA 2001). This area has been identified by the Sacramento Valley&nbsp;
Open Space Conservancy, the CNPS, and TNC as an excellent example of&nbsp;
vernal pool grasslands, supporting a rich and diverse community of&nbsp;
vernal pool endemic plants and animals within Sacramento County. King&nbsp;
(1996) found that vernal pool tadpole shrimp within this unit were&nbsp;
genetically most similar to those in Stanislaus County and nearby in&nbsp;
Sacramento County. However, vernal pool tadpole shrimp within this unit&nbsp;
were generally different from occurrences at other sites sampled&nbsp;
throughout the species' range and were very different from vernal pool&nbsp;
tadpole shrimp sampled at sites found further to the west on the floor&nbsp;
of the Central Valley for example, at Jepson Prairie or the Kesterson&nbsp;
Unit of the San Luis National Wildlife Refuge (King 1996).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit contains State and federally owned land, as well as&nbsp;
private properties. Portions of the Cosumnes River Preserve occur&nbsp;
within this unit. These areas provide habitat for migratory waterfowl&nbsp;
and other avian species that aid in the dispersal of vernal pool&nbsp;
tadpole shrimp and other vernal pool crustacean cysts (criterion 3).&nbsp;
Several large, diverse, vernal pool landscapes are protected within&nbsp;
this unit (criterion 4), including the Howard Ranch and Valensin Ranch.&nbsp;
The Clay Station Mitigation Bank, Laguna Creek Mitigation Bank, and the&nbsp;
Borden Ranch Mitigation site are included in this unit, as well as a&nbsp;
number of smaller conservation areas, including the Rancho Seco&nbsp;
Preserve.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit occupies the area south of Deer Creek and the Cosumnes&nbsp;
River to an area just south of the Sacramento and San Joaquin County.&nbsp;
The eastern boundary is the low-elevation foothills of western Amador&nbsp;
County. The western limit is the Sacramento River. Land ownership and&nbsp;
protection within the unit includes TNC (9,970 ac (3,988 ha)) lands and&nbsp;
WRP easements (11 ac (4 ha)).

[[Page 46731]]

Unit 10, Davis Communications Annex Unit, Yolo County (440 ac (178 ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit is ecologically important (criterion 2) because it&nbsp;
contains claypan vernal pools, which are generally larger and stay&nbsp;
inundated for relatively longer periods than vernal pools on alluvial&nbsp;
terraces or volcanic mudflows and lava flows. This unit is essential to&nbsp;
the species because it represents some of the last remaining claypan&nbsp;
vernal pools in Yolo County and west of the Sacramento River.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit is located southeast of the City of Davis and south of&nbsp;
the South Fork of Putah Creek. This unit's western boundary coincides&nbsp;
with the Solano and Yolo County line. The unit contains land owned by&nbsp;
Yolo County. This unit contains DoD (1,258 ac (310 ha)) owned land.

Unit 13, Stanislaus Unit, Stanislaus County (16,323 ac (6,606 ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit contains hardpan pools on soils of alluvial fans and&nbsp;
terraces. It is important ecologically (criterion 2) for its numerous&nbsp;
small pools and swales on mima mound topography, supported by soils&nbsp;
that are typically older than those of the alluvial terraces in the&nbsp;
Sacramento area. The unit is also geographically important (criterion&nbsp;
1) because it contains almost 25 percent of vernal pool habitats found&nbsp;
along the eastern margin of the San Joaquin Valley. King (1996) found&nbsp;
that vernal pool tadpole shrimp within this unit, although similar to&nbsp;
vernal pool tadpole shrimp in eastern Sacramento County, were&nbsp;
genetically different from other tadpole shrimp occurrences sampled&nbsp;
throughout the species' range, particularly those on the floor of the&nbsp;
Central Valley. The Stanislaus Unit contains very high quality,&nbsp;
hydrologically intact vernal pool complexes likely to persist over time&nbsp;
(criterion 4), including the well-known Hickman pools in Stanislaus&nbsp;
County.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Stanislaus Unit is bordered by the Stanislaus River to the&nbsp;
north and Dry Creek to the south and southeast in western Stanislaus&nbsp;
County. All the land within this unit is privately owned.

Unit 14, San Francisco Bay Unit, Alameda and Santa Clara Counties (802&nbsp;
ac (325 ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit is geographically important (criterion 1) because it&nbsp;
represents the only location where vernal pool tadpole shrimp occur in&nbsp;
the San Francisco Bay region, and because it represents the western&nbsp;
extent of the species range. The unit is over 37 mi (60 km) from the&nbsp;
nearest unit to the north, and over 56 mi (90 km) from the nearest&nbsp;
units to the east and south. Vernal pool tadpole shrimp within this&nbsp;
unit are found in a unique tidal marsh estuary area that represents an&nbsp;
unusual habitat type for the species (criterion 2).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit is situated south of the cities of Fremont and Newark,&nbsp;
west of Interstate 880 and north of Mud Slough. Portions of this unit&nbsp;
are particularly likely to persist over time (criterion 4) because they&nbsp;
occur within the boundaries of San Francisco Bay National Wildlife&nbsp;
Refuge. This unit also includes a preserve established as a&nbsp;
conservation measure for vernal pool tadpole shrimp as part of the&nbsp;
Pacific Commons development project (Service 2000b).

Unit 15, Merced Unit, Merced and Mariposa Counties (61,379 ac (24,840&nbsp;
ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit is important for the conservation of the species because&nbsp;
it contains more documented occurrences of the species than any other&nbsp;
area throughout the species' range (criterion 1) (CNDDB 2001). The&nbsp;
Merced Unit contains almost 15 percent of all remaining vernal pool&nbsp;
habitats in the Central Valley, and 40 percent of vernal pool habitats&nbsp;
along the eastern margin of the San Joaquin Valley (Holland 1998). The&nbsp;
vernal pool tadpole shrimp in this unit occur in the largest block of&nbsp;
pristine, high-density vernal pool grasslands remaining in California&nbsp;
(Vollmar 1999). These vernal pools support multiple large vernal pool&nbsp;
tadpole shrimp occurrences that are capable of producing large numbers&nbsp;
of cysts in good years, which is important for this species to survive&nbsp;
through a variety of natural and environmental changes, as well as&nbsp;
stochastic events (criterion 4). Genetic analyses of vernal pool&nbsp;
tadpole shrimp revealed that occurrences in this unit are genetically&nbsp;
different from other sampled occurrences (King 1996). Of all&nbsp;
occurrences studied, King (1996) found these to be the most highly&nbsp;
divergent.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A majority of the vernal pool habitat in the Merced Unit is in&nbsp;
Merced County. The eastern edge of the unit generally follows the&nbsp;
Mariposa County line. The Chowchilla River in Madera County flows along&nbsp;
the southern boundary of the unit. The northern boundary parallels the&nbsp;
Merced River. The entire unit is located east of Highway 99. As part of&nbsp;
TNC's Merced Grasslands Project, approximately 20,288 ac (8,210 ha) of&nbsp;
vernal pool habitat in this unit have been conserved through the&nbsp;
establishment of conservation easements.

Unit 17, Table Mountain Unit, Fresno County (1,802 ac (729 ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit contains Northern Basalt Flow vernal pools found on&nbsp;
narrow, sinuous basalt mesas above the surrounding low-lying terrain.&nbsp;
Basalt flow vernal pools are a very rare habitat type for vernal pool&nbsp;
tadpole shrimp, and the habitats within this unit are important for&nbsp;
maintaining the range of ecological conditions in which the species&nbsp;
occurs (criterion 2). They typically contain small, irregularly&nbsp;
clustered pools with ``flashy hydrology'' (Keeler-Wolf et al. 1998).&nbsp;
The occurrences of vernal pool tadpole shrimp in this unit are&nbsp;
genetically different from occurrences in other portions of the&nbsp;
species' range, particularly those occurring on the floor of the&nbsp;
Central Valley (King 1996).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Located in Fresno County, this unit contains vernal pool habitats&nbsp;
east and south of the San Joaquin River and east of Millerton Lake. The&nbsp;
unit is west of Marshall Station and North of Table Mountain Rancheria.&nbsp;
Table Mountain occurs within this unit, and land ownership within the&nbsp;
unit includes BLM (190 ac (77 ha)), CDFG lands (419 ac (170 ha)), and&nbsp;
TNC conservation easements (639 ac (256 ha)). All other lands within&nbsp;
this unit are privately owned.

Unit 18A, B and C, Tulare Unit, Tulare County (7,579 ac (3,067 ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit contributes to the conservation of the species because it&nbsp;
contains pools formed on San Joaquin, Cometa, and Madera soils, among&nbsp;
others (criterion 2). The unit is geographically essential (criterion&nbsp;
1) because it represents the southern extent of the vernal pool tadpole&nbsp;
shrimp's range. The unit is essential because it maintains the genetic&nbsp;
diversity of the species. The Sequoia Field occurrence was most closely&nbsp;
related to occurrences at Kesterson National Wildlife Refuge, and was&nbsp;
generally more similar to other occurrences on the valley floor than&nbsp;
occurrences found on the eastern margin of the valley in the Sierra&nbsp;
Nevada Foothills. However, King (1996) found that vernal pool tadpole&nbsp;
shrimp within this unit were genetically different from other&nbsp;
populations studied.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit is comprised of three subunits located in northwest&nbsp;
Tulare County. CDFG manages vernal pool habitats at the Stone Corral&nbsp;
and Sequoia Field Ecological Reserves found within this unit. Keeler-
Wolf et al. (1998) identified the vernal pools in these areas as&nbsp;
``high-quality hardpan pools.'' Much of the area within this unit is&nbsp;
owned by

[[Page 46732]]

CDFG (212 ac (86 ha)) or occurs on private land.

Limnanthes floccosa ssp. californica

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Butte County meadowfoam is found in four general areas of&nbsp;
concentration in a narrow band from south to north of Chico,&nbsp;
California. The vernal pool types and soils associated with the four&nbsp;
general areas of concentration of Butte County meadowfoam include those&nbsp;
vernal pools on Tuscan formation or terraced-alluvials with mostly&nbsp;
Anita, Riverbank, Redbluff, Modesto, and Redding soils. The habitat&nbsp;
associated with Butte County Meadowfoam includes saturated soils and&nbsp;
pools with a ``flashy'' (short lived) inundation period. A vernal&nbsp;
pool's parent material greatly influences that pool's species&nbsp;
composition and hydrologic functioning (Hanes and Stromberg 1998;&nbsp;
Holland and Jain 1981, 1988). Soils beneath vernal pools are extremely&nbsp;
variable and are not the same as soils mapped by soil surveys, but are&nbsp;
usually undescribed hydric inclusions that vary upon location (Holland&nbsp;
and Dain 1990).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Butte County Meadowfoam is found more often within the swale system&nbsp;
between vernal pools than in the pools themselves (Jokerst 1989). The&nbsp;
swale habitat forms a branch or net-like pattern between the vernal&nbsp;
pools and around mound topography and connects the vernal pools&nbsp;
hydrologically. These swale systems are inundated by surface flow and&nbsp;
post-storm runoff from adjacent areas and have a greater variability in&nbsp;
environmental conditions than do the vernal pools. The swale systems&nbsp;
also have different species compositions, depending on parent soil and&nbsp;
moisture regime (Holland and Jain 1981, 1988; Jokerst 1989). Butte&nbsp;
County meadowfoam at the southern extent of its range occurs on&nbsp;
volcanic mudflows with Corning variant soils. Occurrences near Chico&nbsp;
are on formations of eroded mudflow formations. Butte County meadowfoam&nbsp;
in the northern extent of the species range occur on very shallow&nbsp;
Tuscan formation soils (Dole 1988). All four areas designated as&nbsp;
critical habitat have a different species composition, depending on&nbsp;
soil and hydrologic conditions. We believe that providing for a mosaic&nbsp;
of habitat types both between and among vernal pool species is&nbsp;
essential because it would include the full extent of the physical and&nbsp;
environmental conditions for the species (Dole 1988; Fugate 1992;&nbsp;
Fugate 1998; Gonzales et al.1996; Ikeda and Schlising 1990; Noss et al.&nbsp;
2002a; Platenkamp 1998; Zedler et al. 1979). The primary constituent&nbsp;
elements of critical habitat for Limnanthes floccosa ssp. californica&nbsp;
are the habitat components that provide:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) Vernal pools, swales, and other ephemeral wetlands and&nbsp;
depressions of appropriate sizes and depths and the adjacent upland&nbsp;
margins of these depressions that sustain Limnanthes floccosa ssp.&nbsp;
californica germination, growth and reproduction, including but not&nbsp;
limited to vernal pool swales and the margins of vernal pools on the&nbsp;
Tuscan, Redbluff, Riverbank, and Modesto geologic formations underlain&nbsp;
by Tuscan-Anita and Igo-Redding complex soils, among others. These&nbsp;
habitats typically become inundated during winter rains, but are dry&nbsp;
during the summer and do not necessarily fill with water every year;&nbsp;
and
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) The associated watershed(s) and hydrologic features, including&nbsp;
the pool basin, swales, and surrounding uplands (which may vary in&nbsp;
extent depending on pool size and depth, soil type and depth, hardpan&nbsp;
or claypan type and extent, topography, and climate) that contribute to&nbsp;
the filling and drying of the vernal pool or ephemeral wetland, and&nbsp;
that maintain suitable periods of pool inundation, water quality, and&nbsp;
soil moisture for Limnanthes floccosa ssp. californica germination,&nbsp;
growth and reproduction, and dispersal, but not necessarily every year.

Unit 1, Rock Creek Unit, Butte, and Tehama Counties (15,086 ac (6,105&nbsp;
ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit contains the species identified by CNDDB (2002) within&nbsp;
vernal pools on the Tuscan formation, which are ecologically noteworthy&nbsp;
(criterion 2) because they typically contain water for shorter periods&nbsp;
of time than other types of vernal pools. The unit is also&nbsp;
geographically important (criterion 1) because it represents the&nbsp;
northern extent of Limnanthes floccosa ssp. californica's range, and&nbsp;
because it represents one of only four areas where L. f. ssp.&nbsp;
californica occurs throughout its entire range. Each unit is likely&nbsp;
important to allow the species to tolerate natural and environmental&nbsp;
changes, as well as stochastic events. The unit includes occurrences&nbsp;
from the northern race of L. f. ssp. californica. This race is&nbsp;
genetically different from the southern race (Jokerst 1989; Dole and&nbsp;
Sun 1992) and is important to maintain genetic diversity within the&nbsp;
species. An introduced occurrence, thought to be of the southern race,&nbsp;
also occurs within this unit.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit for Limnanthes floccosa ssp. californica occupies an area&nbsp;
north of the City of Chico and includes vernal pool habitats east of&nbsp;
Highway 99 along the Sierra foothills from near Pine Creek southeast to&nbsp;
Rock Creek. All the lands within this unit are privately owned.

Lasthenia conjugens

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contra Costa goldfields occurrences are found in five centers of&nbsp;
concentration in the northern and central Coast Range and western part&nbsp;
of the Central Valley in Solano and Contra Costa County. By far the&nbsp;
greatest concentration of this species is in the area east of Fairfield&nbsp;
in Solano County. Contra Costa goldfields normally are found in vernal&nbsp;
pools, swales, moist flats, and depressions within open grassy areas of&nbsp;
woodland and valley grassland habitats. However, several historical&nbsp;
collections were from populations growing in the saline-alkaline&nbsp;
transition zone between vernal pools and tidal marshes on the eastern&nbsp;
margin of the San Francisco Bay (CNDDB 2002).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although some of the habitat characteristics of the species are&nbsp;
known, specific pool characteristics that determine suitability for&nbsp;
Contra Costa goldfields germination, growth, reproduction, and&nbsp;
dispersal are not well understood. Contra Costa goldfields normally is&nbsp;
observed in only a few of the pools within the vernal pool complexes in&nbsp;
which it is found, and the pool characteristics that determine&nbsp;
suitability for Contra Costa goldfields germination and growth are&nbsp;
unknown. By overlapping known occurrences of Contra Costa goldfields&nbsp;
with appropriate soil types, elevations, slopes, vegetation community&nbsp;
associations, and vernal pool types, where we know Contra Costa&nbsp;
goldfields to occur, we have designated what we believe is the likely&nbsp;
distribution of the seed bank around Contra Costa goldfield&nbsp;
occurrences. Due to the species' highly restricted nature and disjunct&nbsp;
distribution, the long-term survival of Contra Costa goldfields depends&nbsp;
upon the protection and management of all extant populations and their&nbsp;
associated seed banks, and the maintenance of ecological functions&nbsp;
within and between these populations. The primary constituent elements&nbsp;
of critical habitat for Lasthenia conjugens are the habitat components&nbsp;
that provide:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) Vernal pools, swales, moist flats, and other ephemeral wetlands&nbsp;
and depressions of appropriate sizes and depths and the adjacent upland&nbsp;
margins of these depressions that sustain Lasthenia conjugens&nbsp;
germination, growth, and reproduction, including, but not limited to,&nbsp;
vernal pools on clay soils from a variety of soils series, rock outcrop&nbsp;

Unit 1, Manchester Unit, Mendocino County (2,637 ac (1,067 ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit for Lasthenia conjugens contains the habitat essential&nbsp;
for the species and is geographically noteworthy (criterion 1) for its&nbsp;
location at the northern and western limit of the species' range (CNDDB&nbsp;
2002). It represents the only occurrence of L. conjugens in the&nbsp;
Mendocino coast area, and is over 87 mi (140 km) from the closest L.&nbsp;
conjugens unit to the south. The unit is also ecologically important&nbsp;
(criterion 2) because it is the only location where L. conjugens has&nbsp;
been found on Crispin loam soils. Some of the vernal pool habitats on&nbsp;
this site were last surveyed in 1987, and L. conjugens was not observed&nbsp;
at that time (CNDDB 2002). However, the essential habitat requirements&nbsp;
for the species still remain and represent an example of the varying&nbsp;
habitat types on which the species occurs.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit is on private land and is located in the vicinity of the&nbsp;
town of Manchester just north of the Garcia River and east of the&nbsp;
Pacific Ocean. State Highway 1 bisects this unit and Brushy Creek forms&nbsp;
the northern and northeastern boundary.

Unit 2, Berryessa Unit, Napa County (1,016 ac (411 ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit is ecologically noteworthy for its rock outcrop pools on&nbsp;
soils derived from Rhyolite lava flows, within chaparral ecosystems&nbsp;
(Holland 1998; USDA 2001; CNDDB 2002). This is also the only unit where&nbsp;
Lasthenia conjugens occurs on Northern Basalt Flow vernal pools, making&nbsp;
the area important to maintain the range of habitats in which the&nbsp;
species is known to occur (criterion 2). The unit is geographically&nbsp;
important (criterion 1) because it represents some of the last&nbsp;
remaining vernal pool habitats in the north bay foothills, and is the&nbsp;
only unit for L. conjugens in this area. This unit is over 15 mi (25&nbsp;
km) from the nearest L. conjugens unit.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit is located south of Lake Berryessa and lies in the&nbsp;
Milliken Canyon area east of the City of Yountville and northeast of&nbsp;
the City of Napa. All the lands within this unit are privately owned.

Unit 3, Napa River Unit, Napa County (678 ac (275 ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vernal pools in which Lasthenia conjugens are found in this unit&nbsp;
occur on Hambright rock-outcrop complex soils. This is the only&nbsp;
location where L. conjugens is found on this soil type (criterion 2).&nbsp;
This unit is located on private land and is located near the Napa River&nbsp;
east of the intersection of State Route 121 and 29. All the land within&nbsp;
this unit are privately owned.

Unit 6, Rodeo Creek Unit, Contra Costa County (399 ac (162 ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit is ecologically noteworthy (criterion 2) because it&nbsp;
supports occurrences of the species within vernal pool habitats formed&nbsp;
on Conejo clay loam soils (USDA 2001; CNDDB 2002). It is geographically&nbsp;
important (criterion 1) in that it is the only area where the species&nbsp;
occurs in the vicinity of the Sacramento-San Joaquin delta (criterion&nbsp;
1). This unit is over 16 mi (25 km) from the closest unit to the north,&nbsp;
and almost 32 mi (50 km) from the closest unit to the south.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The unit is situated along Rodeo Creek and adjacent to State&nbsp;
Highway 4, southeast of the City of Rodeo and northeast of the City of&nbsp;
Hercules. It contains a 10 ac (4 ha) conservation easement area&nbsp;
established in 1999 to protect three known locations of Lasthenia&nbsp;
conjugens along Rodeo Creek from highway construction activities along&nbsp;
State Route 4 (criterion 4). All the lands within this unit are&nbsp;
privately owned.

Unit 7, Byron Hot Springs Unit, Contra Costa County (3,284 ac (1,329&nbsp;
ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit is geographically noteworthy (criterion 1) because it&nbsp;
contains the only remaining extant occurrence of Lasthenia conjugens in&nbsp;
southeastern Contra Costa County (CNDDB 2001). This occurrence is&nbsp;
located in vernal pools formed on Linne clay loam soils, and has been&nbsp;
characterized as alkaline meadow, a unique habitat type for the species&nbsp;
(criterion 2) (USDA 2001; CNDDB 2002). This unit is over 22 mi (35 km)&nbsp;
from the closest unit to the north, and almost 32 mi (50 km) from the&nbsp;
closest unit to the south.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit is in the vicinity of Byron Hot Springs and Byron Airport&nbsp;
and lies directly west of Clifton Court Forebay. This unit includes&nbsp;
habitat in low-lying areas east of the Altamont Hills, but also&nbsp;
includes habitat within a small portion of Altamont Hills.&nbsp;
Approximately 99 ac (40 ha) within this unit are owned by the State and&nbsp;
the rest is privately owned.

Unit 8, Southeastern San Francisco Bay Unit, Alameda and Santa Clara&nbsp;
Counties (802 ac (325 ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit contains occurrences of this species within vernal pools,&nbsp;
swales, moist flats, and other ephemeral wetlands in saline alkaline&nbsp;
transition zones with tidal marsh habitats, an ecologically unusual&nbsp;
habitat for the species (criterion 2) (Holland 1998; CNDDB 2002). The&nbsp;
southern and western boundaries of the unity were delineated to exclude&nbsp;
estuarine habitats and urban areas visible on SPOT imagery.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The unit includes a 450-ac (180-ha) preserve established&nbsp;
specifically to contribute to the recovery of Lasthenia conjugens&nbsp;
(Wetland Research Associates 1999; Service 2000b). Additionally, 425 ac&nbsp;
(172 ha) of this unit is on the San Francisco Bay National Wildlife&nbsp;
Refuge, and is therefore more likely to persist over time (criterion&nbsp;
4). The unit is relatively isolated geographically (criterion 1), being&nbsp;
over 31 mi (50 km) from the nearest units to the north, and almost 62&nbsp;
mi (100 km) from the nearest L. conjugens unit to the south.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The unit occurs in southeastern San Francisco Bay and also&nbsp;
represents Unit 14 for vernal pool tadpole shrimp. It lies between the&nbsp;
northernmost and southernmost subunits and is situated south of the&nbsp;
cities of Fremont and Newark and north of Mud Slough. Portions of this&nbsp;
unit are found within the boundaries of San Francisco Bay National&nbsp;
Wildlife Refuge and the rest is privately owned.

Unit 9, Fort Ord Unit, Monterey County (6,878 ac (2,784 ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Fort Ord Unit encompasses the southernmost remaining occurrence&nbsp;
of the species, located 62 mi (100 km) from its next closest neighbor&nbsp;
to the north (criterion 1). It contains seasonally flooded pool habitat&nbsp;
and mima mound grassland areas within the former Fort Ord army base.&nbsp;
These lands are currently owned and managed by the Army and BLM. The&nbsp;
Army will eventually divest itself of all of the land it manages. It is&nbsp;
likely BLM will receive the majority of the land that is scheduled for&nbsp;
transfer; all or a major portion of this land will be managed as

[[Page 46734]]

a Natural Resource Management Area, which will increase the chances of&nbsp;
the habitat and population persisting over time (criterion 4).&nbsp;
Population sizes of Lasthenia conjugens at two locations within the&nbsp;
Fort Ord Unit are monitored and have been found to vary on an annual&nbsp;
basis. These differences may be due to variations in annual rainfall&nbsp;
and duration of ponded water (Harding Lawson Associates 2001). The&nbsp;
combined population estimates for both areas where monitoring occurred&nbsp;
in 1998, 1999, and 2000 were 500-1500; 56,000; and 162,500 individuals,&nbsp;
respectively. The Federal government owns 6,874 ac (2,782 ha), the&nbsp;
State owns 4 ac (2 ha), and the rest is privately owned.

Chamaesyce hooveri

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hoover's spurge is found in naturally occurring widely scattered&nbsp;
vernal pool complexes in a narrow zone of rolling topography and&nbsp;
remnant alluvial fans and stream terraces at the base of the Sierra&nbsp;
Nevada foothills and two locations in alkali sink areas at the&nbsp;
Sacramento National Wildlife Refuge and San Luis National Wildlife&nbsp;
Refuge Complex in three general areas of concentration in Tehama,&nbsp;
Butte, Glenn, Colusa, Stanislaus, Merced, and Tulare Counties in the&nbsp;
Sacramento and San Joaquin Valleys (CNDDB 2002, Stone et al. 1988). The&nbsp;
elevation of these areas of concentration varies from near 15 m (50 ft)&nbsp;
to near 150 m (500 ft). Conserving a broad geographic range of Hoover's&nbsp;
spurge across its geographical and elevational distribution protects&nbsp;
the natural environmental processes for the species and provides the&nbsp;
best chance for retaining the species across the full extent of the&nbsp;
species' range. The vernal pool types and soils associated with the six&nbsp;
areas of concentration of Hoover's spurge differ greatly across the&nbsp;
geographic range of the species; these differences lead to different&nbsp;
species compositions and environmental conditions between Hoover's&nbsp;
spurge occurrences. Providing for a mosaic of habitat types both&nbsp;
between and among vernal pool species occurrences is essential to the&nbsp;
species' conservation because it would include the full extent of the&nbsp;
physical and environmental conditions for the species (Fugate 1992;&nbsp;
Fugate 1998; Gonzales et al.1996; Ikeda and Schlising 1990; Noss et al.&nbsp;
2002a; Platenkamp 1998; Zedler et al. 1979).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The distribution of Hoover's spurge reflects a diversity of vernal&nbsp;
pool habitat types that provide habitat for the species on the alluvial&nbsp;
fans and old stream terraces of the Sierra Nevada foothills. Vernal&nbsp;
pool complexes that provide suitable habitat for this species include&nbsp;
three different physiographic and edaphic settings--old high and lower&nbsp;
old stream terrace areas with soils having an iron-silica hardpan and&nbsp;
sites with shallow soils underlain by cemented tufaceous alluvium. The&nbsp;
Tehama County occurrences of Hoover's spurge are associated with&nbsp;
slightly to medium acid soils of the Tuscan and Anita soil series that&nbsp;
are underlain by an iron-silica cemented hardpan (Broyles 1987). The&nbsp;
Glenn and Colusa County occurrences at the Sacramento National Wildlife&nbsp;
Refuge are associated with alkaline vernal pools on Willows and Riz&nbsp;
soil types (Holland 1998; Silveira 2000; CNDDB 2002). The Stanislaus&nbsp;
County occurrences are associated with neutral to slightly alkaline&nbsp;
claypan soils of the Meikle series that formed in small drainages of&nbsp;
Pleistocene alluvium. The Merced County occurrences in the Arena Plains&nbsp;
are within saline-alkaline vernal pools on Lewis soils (USDA 2001;&nbsp;
CNDDB 2002). The Tulare County occurrences are associated with lime-
silica cemented hardpan and low-terrace neutral to slightly alkaline&nbsp;
soils of the Madera soil series. Not all areas of Hoover's spurge have&nbsp;
been identified as to the specific soil series or soil mapping units on&nbsp;
which they occur. Many of the occupied vernal pools vary in size from&nbsp;
1,900 m\2\ (20,520 ft\2\) to 250 ha (618 ac). A vernal pool's parent&nbsp;
material greatly influences the pool's species composition and&nbsp;
hydrologic functioning (Hanes and Stromberg 1998; Holland and Jain&nbsp;
1981, 1988). Soils beneath vernal pools are extremely variable and are&nbsp;
not the same as soils mapped by soil surveys, but are usually&nbsp;
undescribed hydric inclusions that vary upon location (Holland and Dain&nbsp;
1990). Field observations suggest that Hoover's spurge is restricted to&nbsp;
specific microsites within the vernal pools and may behave somewhat&nbsp;
independently, depending on environmental and edaphic conditions and&nbsp;
are likely locally adapted (Alexander and Schlising 1997; Stone et al.&nbsp;
1988; Vollmar 2002). The primary constituent elements of critical&nbsp;
habitat for Chamaesyce hooveri are the habitat components that provide:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) Vernal pools, swales, and other ephemeral wetlands and&nbsp;
depressions of appropriate sizes and depths and the adjacent upland&nbsp;
margins of these depressions that sustain Chamaesyce hooveri&nbsp;
germination, growth, and reproduction, including but not limited to,&nbsp;
vernal pools formed on neutral to saline-alkaline soils over lime-
silica cemented hardpan or claypan, or on acidic soils over iron-silica&nbsp;
cemented hardpan, that typically become inundated during winter rains,&nbsp;
but are dry during the summer and do not necessarily fill with water&nbsp;
every year; and
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) The associated watershed(s) and hydrologic features, including&nbsp;
the pool basin, swales, and surrounding uplands (which may vary in&nbsp;
extent depending on pool size and depth, soil type and depth, hardpan&nbsp;
or claypan type and extent, topography, and climate) that contribute to&nbsp;
the filling and drying of the vernal pool or ephemeral wetland, and&nbsp;
that maintain suitable periods of pool inundation, water quality, and&nbsp;
soil moisture for Chamaesyce hooveri germination, growth and&nbsp;
reproduction, and dispersal, but not necessarily every year.

Unit 1, Vina Plains Unit, Tehama and Butte Counties (25,102 ac (10,159&nbsp;
ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit, along with Unit 2, is ecologically unusual (criterion 2)&nbsp;
in that it supports numerous occurrences of the species within vernal&nbsp;
pools on acidic soils over iron-silica cemented hardpan, including&nbsp;
Anita and Tuscan soils (Holland 1998; USDA 2001; CNDDB 2002). The Vina&nbsp;
Plains Unit is also geographically important (criterion 1) because it&nbsp;
contains over 50 percent of the known occurrences of Chamaesyce&nbsp;
hooveri, including several large, stable occurrences (CNDDB 2002), and&nbsp;
because it represents the northern extent of the species' range.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The unit for Chamaesyce hooveri occupies the area south of Toomes&nbsp;
Creek and north of Pine Creek to near Cana Highway in southeast Tehema&nbsp;
County and northwest Butte County. State Route 99 bisects this unit and&nbsp;
the western boundary generally parallels the Southern Pacific Railway&nbsp;
line. This unit contains TNC's 4,600 (1,862 ha) Vina Plains preserve,&nbsp;
making occurrences in the unit more likely to persist over time&nbsp;
(criterion 4). The majority of the lands included within this unit are&nbsp;
privately owned. Property ownership and protection within this unit&nbsp;
includes CDFG (0.4 ha (1 ac)), CDFG administration (1 ac (0.4 ha), TNC&nbsp;
(5,738 (2,295 ha), TNC easements (11,653 ac (4,661 ha), and WRP&nbsp;
easements and agreements (142 ac (57 ha)).

Unit 4, Waterford Unit, Stanislaus and Tuolumne Counties (39,038 ac&nbsp;
(15,799 ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit supports Chamaesyce hooveri occurrences within vernal&nbsp;
pools on Whitney sandy loam soils (USDA 2001; CNDDB 2002), which are&nbsp;
not otherwise well represented (criterion 2). These soils are typically&nbsp;
older than those of the alluvial terraces in the Sacramento area, which&nbsp;
are estimated to

[[Page 46735]]

be of early Pleistocene origin. The Waterford Unit contains very high&nbsp;
quality, hydrologically intact vernal pool complexes important for the&nbsp;
conservation of C. hooveri (criterion 4). The unit is located primarily&nbsp;
in southeastern Stanislaus County, extending on its eastern border into&nbsp;
the low elevation foothills of the Sierra Nevada in Tuolumne County. It&nbsp;
is geographically noteworthy (criterion 1) because known occurrences of&nbsp;
C. hooveri are sparsely distributed in the southern Sierra Nevada&nbsp;
foothills, and because these occurrences are highly disjunct from&nbsp;
occurrences of the species in the northern portion of its range. This&nbsp;
unit is over 140 mi (225 km) from the nearest units to the north. CDFG&nbsp;
administers approximately (2 ac (0.8 ha), and the remaining land within&nbsp;
this unit is privately owned.

Unit 5, Turlock Unit, Stanislaus and Merced Counties (35,508 ac (14,370&nbsp;
ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit contains occurrences of the species within large vernal&nbsp;
pools on Meikle soils, including two of the seven known occurrences of&nbsp;
Chamaesyce hooveri on the eastern margin of the San Joaquin Valley&nbsp;
(Holland 1998; CNDDB 2002). The unit also includes an occurrence of C.&nbsp;
hooveri within the well-known Hickman pools in Stanislaus County. Not&nbsp;
only does the Hickman pool complex contain one of the largest vernal&nbsp;
lakes in California at more than 300 ac (121 ha), but it also exhibits&nbsp;
tremendous biodiversity (criterion 2) (Medeiros 2002).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Turlock Unit contains large intact and contiguous vernal pool&nbsp;
grassland areas that help maintain connectivity between Chamaesyce&nbsp;
hooveri habitat to the north and south (criterion 3). There are&nbsp;
numerous vernal pools, swales, and other ephemeral wetlands and&nbsp;
depressions of appropriate sizes and depths in this unit to sustain C.&nbsp;
hooveri germination, growth, and reproduction. Chamaesyce hooveri&nbsp;
populations in Stanislaus County typically flower from mid-June into&nbsp;
October, whereas those in central Merced and Tulare Counties typically&nbsp;
flower from late May through July (Alexander and Schlising 1997). The&nbsp;
C. hooveri habitat in this unit is important to conserve phenotypic&nbsp;
variation within the species and to maintain the geographic&nbsp;
distribution of C. hooveri throughout its range (criteria 1 and 2).&nbsp;
Vernal pools in the Turlock Unit are located in southeastern Stanislaus&nbsp;
and northeastern Merced Counties. They extend from the San Joaquin&nbsp;
Valley floor to the low-elevation foothills of the Sierra Nevada.

Unit 7A, B, C, and D, Tulare Unit, Tulare County (23,537 ac (9,526 ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit is geographically important because it supports almost 20&nbsp;
percent of the known occurrences of Chamaesyce hooveri (CNDDB 2002).&nbsp;
This unit also comprises the southern extent of the range of the&nbsp;
species. Occurrences within this unit are more than 68 mi (110 km)&nbsp;
distant from the nearest C. hooveri unit to the north. Chamaesyce&nbsp;
hooveri populations in Tulare County typically flower from late May&nbsp;
through July, whereas those in Stanislaus and Sacramento County&nbsp;
typically flower from mid-June into October (Alexander and Schlising&nbsp;
1997). This phenotypic variation also suggests there may be regional&nbsp;
differences between these and other occurrences in other portions of&nbsp;
the species' range (criterion 2).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are four subunits within the Tulare Unit located in&nbsp;
northeastern Tulare County. The unit includes several protected areas&nbsp;
(criterion 4), including the Sequoia Fields Ecological Reserve and the&nbsp;
Stone Corral Ecological Reserve in Tulare County managed by CDFG (218&nbsp;
ac (88 ha)), as well as 33 ac (13 ha) of BLM land. Other areas within&nbsp;
this unit are privately owned. This unit contains scattered vernal pool&nbsp;
complexes in northwestern Tulare County.
Orthocarpus campestris var. succulentus
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fleshy owl's-clover is found usually in low plant numbers in seven&nbsp;
naturally occurring widely scattered vernal pool complex areas in&nbsp;
Fresno, Madera, San Joaquin, Stanislaus, and Tuolumne Counties in the&nbsp;
San Joaquin Valley. Fleshy owl's-clover has a sporadic distribution&nbsp;
within vernal pools, between vernal pools and between vernal pool&nbsp;
complexes. The specific vernal pool characteristics that determine the&nbsp;
suitability for fleshy owl's-clover germination and growth are unknown;&nbsp;
however, it appears that the species seems to favor somewhat smaller,&nbsp;
somewhat acidic vernal pools as compared to other vernal pool plants.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fleshy owl's-clover occurrences are known from with an elevational&nbsp;
variation of near 50 m (160 ft) to near 550 m (1,800 ft). Conserving a&nbsp;
broad distribution of fleshy owl's-clover across its geographical and&nbsp;
elevational distribution protects the natural environmental processes&nbsp;
for the species and provides the best chance for retaining the species&nbsp;
across the full extent of its range. The vernal pool types and soils&nbsp;
associated with the six areas of concentration of fleshy owl's-clover&nbsp;
differ across the geographic range of the species; these differences&nbsp;
lead to different species compositions and environmental conditions&nbsp;
between fleshy owl's-clover occurrences. Providing for a mosaic of&nbsp;
habitat types both between and among vernal pool species occurrences is&nbsp;
essential to the species' conservation because it would include the&nbsp;
full extent of the physical and environmental conditions for the&nbsp;
species (Fugate 1992; Fugate 1998; Gonzales et al.1996; Ikeda and&nbsp;
Schlising 1990; Noss et al. 2002a; Platenkamp 1998; Zedler et al.&nbsp;
1979). The distribution of fleshy owl's-clover reflects a diversity of&nbsp;
vernal pool habitat types and sizes that provide habitat for the&nbsp;
species. We are uncertain about specific soils that may correlate with&nbsp;
the presence of this species, although the species is irregularly found&nbsp;
on Redding soil series. Vernal pool complexes that provide suitable&nbsp;
habitat for this species include pools ranging in depth from 15 cm (6.0&nbsp;
in) to 25 cm (10.0 in), but the species is also found less frequently&nbsp;
in shallower and deeper pools. Soil pH values for some of the vernal&nbsp;
pools in Merced County occupied by fleshy owl's-clover range from 4.3&nbsp;
to 6.2. Although no comprehensive study has been conducted, Merced&nbsp;
County some vernal pools occupied by fleshy owl's-clover vary in size&nbsp;
from 80 sq m (0.02 ac) to 486 sq m (0.12 ac). Merced County contains&nbsp;
the largest aggregations of fleshy owl's-clover, and the occurrences of&nbsp;
the species are found on mild to strongly acidic soils on Laguna,&nbsp;
Mehrten, North Merced Gravels, and Riverbank Formations as well as&nbsp;
Ione, Merthen, and Valley Springs geological formations. The parent&nbsp;
material of vernal pools greatly influences species' composition and&nbsp;
hydrologic functioning of the vernal pool (Hanes and Stromberg 1998;&nbsp;
Holland and Jain 1981, 1988). Although fleshy owl's-clover appears to&nbsp;
prefer the more weathered acidic, higher-terrace vernal pool complexes&nbsp;
that are composed of volcanic tuff sand quartzite parent materials,&nbsp;
soils beneath vernal pools are extremely variable and are not the same&nbsp;
as soils mapped by soil surveys, but are usually undescribed hydric&nbsp;
inclusions that vary upon location (Holland and Dain 1990). The primary&nbsp;
constituent elements of critical habitat for Castilleja campestris ssp.&nbsp;
succulenta are the habitat components that provide:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) Vernal pools, swales, and other ephemeral wetlands and&nbsp;
depressions of appropriate sizes and depths and the adjacent upland&nbsp;
margins of these depressions that sustain Castilleja campestris ssp.&nbsp;
succulenta germination, growth, and reproduction, including but

[[Page 46736]]

not limited to, hardpan vernal pools on alluvial terraces and San&nbsp;
Joaquin, Redding, Corning, Keyes, and Pentz soils series, among others,&nbsp;
and northern basalt flow vernal pools on Hideaway soils series, which&nbsp;
typically become inundated during winter rains, but are dry during the&nbsp;
summer and do not necessarily fill with water every year; and
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) The associated watershed(s) and hydrologic features, including&nbsp;
the pool basin, swales, and surrounding uplands (which may vary in&nbsp;
extent depending on pool size and depth, soil type and depth, hardpan&nbsp;
or claypan type and extent, topography, and climate) that contribute to&nbsp;
the filling and drying of the vernal pool or ephemeral wetland, and&nbsp;
that maintain suitable periods of pool inundation, water quality, and&nbsp;
soil moisture for Castilleja campestris ssp. succulenta germination,&nbsp;
growth and reproduction, and dispersal, but not necessarily every year.

Unit 1, Southeast Sacramento Valley Unit, Sacramento and San Joaquin&nbsp;
Counties (2,422 ac (980 ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit contains occurrences of the species in vernal pools&nbsp;
occurring on San Joaquin soils (Holland 1998; Sacramento County 1999;&nbsp;
CNDDB 2002). The unit is geographically important because it represents&nbsp;
the northernmost extent of the species' range, and because it is the&nbsp;
only unit designated for this species within the Sacramento Valley. The&nbsp;
unit is isolated from other Orthocarpus campestris var. succulentus&nbsp;
occurrences to the south in the San Joaquin Valley by a distance of&nbsp;
over 50 mi (80 km). This unit occupies the area east of Galt in&nbsp;
southeastern Sacramento and northeastern San Joaquin Counties. All of&nbsp;
the lands included within this unit are privately owned.

Unit 2, Waterford Unit, Stanislaus and Tuolumne Counties (33,705 ac&nbsp;
(13,640 ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit supports Orthocarpus campestris var. succulentus&nbsp;
occurrences within hardpan vernal pools on alluvial terraces on Amador&nbsp;
and Redding soils (CNDDB 2002). These soil types are not otherwise well&nbsp;
represented (criterion 2). The unit represents the northernmost extent&nbsp;
of O. c. var. succulentus range within the San Joaquin Valley, and is&nbsp;
over 50 mi (80 km) from the isolated occurrence to the north (criterion&nbsp;
1). It contains a variety of pools and ephemeral habitats in which the&nbsp;
plants are known to occur, including shallow and deep pools and pools&nbsp;
with both long and short inundation periods (criterion 2). The&nbsp;
Waterford Unit is important for the survival of O. c. var. succulentus&nbsp;
because it represents large areas of contiguous habitat with relatively&nbsp;
intact hydrology. Vernal pools in the Waterford Unit are located mainly&nbsp;
in eastern Stanislaus County, but overlap into western Tuolumne County,&nbsp;
extending into the low elevation foothills of the Sierra Nevada. All&nbsp;
the lands within this unit are privately owned.

Unit 5, Fresno Unit, Fresno County (26,406 ac (10,686 ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit contains occurrences of the species growing within vernal&nbsp;
pools formed on Fallbrook, Ramona, San Joaquin, Vista, and Pollasky&nbsp;
soil series (CNDDB 2002). Essential habitat in this unit consists of&nbsp;
typical ``bowl-like'' pools, whereas other areas are more similar to&nbsp;
swales. The diversity of vernal pool types found within the Fresno Unit&nbsp;
contributes to the range of ecological conditions in which Orthocarpus&nbsp;
campestris var. succulentus occurs (criterion 2). This area is also&nbsp;
noteworthy because it represents the southern extent of the species'&nbsp;
range (criterion 1). The Fresno Unit is located south of Millerton&nbsp;
Lake. Property ownership and protection within this unit includes CDFG&nbsp;
(1 ac (0.4 ha) and CDFG-administered land (1 ac (0.4 ha)). The&nbsp;
remainder of the property within this unit is privately owned.

Unit 6A, Table Mountain Unit, Fresno County (4,258 ac (1,723 ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This area supports occurrences of the species within Northern&nbsp;
Basalt Flow vernal pools (CNDDB 2002). This is the only area where&nbsp;
Orthocarpus campestris var. succulentus is found on this vernal pool&nbsp;
type (criterion 2). Northern Basalt Flow pool complexes, such as Table&nbsp;
Mountain, are extremely rare, occurring only on ancient terraces and&nbsp;
hilltops. Basalt tables are perched on narrow, sinuous basalt mesas&nbsp;
above the surrounding low-lying terrain. They typically contain small,&nbsp;
irregularly clustered pools with ``flashy hydrology'' (Keeler-Wolf et&nbsp;
al. 1998). They are less common than hardpan and claypan pools that are&nbsp;
typically found in this region, and occur in complexes that are less&nbsp;
dense than habitat in units further north.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three occurrences of Orthocarpus campestris var. succulentus within&nbsp;
this unit are wholly or partly in designated reserves, which are on two&nbsp;
mountains near Millerton Lake. The Sierra Foothill Conservancy's Big&nbsp;
Table Mountain Preserve includes one of these occurrences, and a&nbsp;
portion of another, which is shared with BLM. The other is in CDFG's&nbsp;
Big Table Mountain Ecological Reserve. A fourth nearby occurrence is&nbsp;
partially under the control of BLM and partly in private ownership. BLM&nbsp;
owns approximately 350 ac (142 ha) and CDFG owns approximately 419 ac&nbsp;
(170 ha) of land within this unit. TNC has 650 ac (256 ha) of&nbsp;
conservation easements within this unit. These preserved areas increase&nbsp;
the likelihood that the species will persist in the unit over time&nbsp;
(criterion 4).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Table Mountain Unit is comprised of two subunits. Both subunits&nbsp;
are located east of Millerton Lake on basalt mesas above the San&nbsp;
Joaquin River. Subunit 6B is located on Kennedy Table in Madera County,&nbsp;
and Subunit 6A is directly south of this unit across the San Joaquin&nbsp;
River on Table Mountain in Fresno County.

Neostapfia colusana

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Colusa grass occurrences are known from eight areas of&nbsp;
concentration with an elevational variation of near 5 m (16 ft) to near&nbsp;
100 m (350 ft). Conserving a broad distribution of Colusa grass across&nbsp;
its geographical and elevational distribution protects the natural&nbsp;
environmental processes for the species and provides the best chance&nbsp;
for retaining the species across the full extent of the species range.&nbsp;
The vernal pool types and soils associated with the eight areas of&nbsp;
concentration of Colusa grass differ greatly across the geographic&nbsp;
range of the species; these differences lead to different species&nbsp;
compositions and environmental conditions between Colusa grass&nbsp;
occurrences. Providing for a mosaic of habitat types both between and&nbsp;
among vernal pool species occurrences is essential to the species'&nbsp;
conservation because it would include the full extent of the physical&nbsp;
and environmental conditions for the species (Fugate 1992; Fugate 1998;&nbsp;
Gonzales et al. 1996; Ikeda and Schlising 1990; Noss et al. 2002a;&nbsp;
Platenkamp 1998; Zedler et al. 1979). The distribution of Colusa grass&nbsp;
reflects a diversity of vernal pool habitat types and sizes that&nbsp;
provide habitat for the species. Vernal pool complexes that provide&nbsp;
suitable habitat for this species include two different physiographic&nbsp;
and edaphic settings: claypan soils of saline-alkali basins and remnant&nbsp;
alluvial fans and old stream terrace areas with strongly acidic,&nbsp;
gravelly, and cobbly soils having an iron-silica cemented hardpan, and&nbsp;
shallow, slightly acidic residual soils of the Pentz series underlain&nbsp;
by cemented tuffaceous alluvium. Additional settings for Colusa grass&nbsp;
are found in vernal pool complexes where resistant beds of tuffaceous&nbsp;
deposits are exposed along intermittent drainages and, in Stanislaus

[[Page 46737]]

County, neutral to slightly alkaline claypan soils on dissected&nbsp;
alluvial fans. Not all areas of Colusa grass have been identified as to&nbsp;
the specific soil series or soil mapping units where they occur.&nbsp;
However, in Merced County, Colusa grass occurs on clay soils on Mehrten&nbsp;
Formation and also on Riverbank, North Merced Gravels, and Laguna&nbsp;
Formations. Of the Orcuttieae grasses, Colusa grass inhabits the widest&nbsp;
range of vernal pool sizes, with the smallest being 100 sq m (1,075 sq&nbsp;
ft) and the largest at 250 ha (618 ac). The parent material of vernal&nbsp;
pools greatly influences species composition and hydrologic functioning&nbsp;
of the vernal pool (Hanes and Stromberg 1998; Holland and Jain 1981,&nbsp;
1988). Soils beneath vernal pools are extremely variable and are not&nbsp;
the same as soils mapped by soil surveys, but are usually undescribed&nbsp;
hydric inclusions that vary by location (Holland and Dain 1990). The&nbsp;
primary constituent elements of critical habitat for Neostapfia&nbsp;
colusana are the habitat components that provide:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) Vernal pools, swales, and other ephemeral wetlands and&nbsp;
depressions of appropriate sizes and depths and the adjacent upland&nbsp;
margins of these depressions that sustain Neostapfia colusana&nbsp;
germination, growth, and reproduction, and that typically become&nbsp;
inundated during winter rains, including but not limited to vernal&nbsp;
pools formed on the rim of alkaline basins in the Sacramento and San&nbsp;
Joaquin valleys, as well as on acidic soils of alluvial fans and stream&nbsp;
terraces along the eastern margin of the San Joaquin Valley and into&nbsp;
the adjacent foothills. All of these pool types are dry during the&nbsp;
summer and do not necessarily fill with water every year; and
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) The associated watershed(s) and hydrologic features, including&nbsp;
the pool basin, swales, and surrounding uplands (which may vary in&nbsp;
extent depending on pool size and depth, soil type and depth, hardpan&nbsp;
or claypan type and extent, topography, and climate) that contribute to&nbsp;
the filling and drying of the vernal pool or ephemeral wetland, and&nbsp;
that maintain suitable periods of pool inundation, water quality, and&nbsp;
soil moisture for Neostapfia colusana germination, growth and&nbsp;
reproduction, and dispersal, but not necessarily every year.

Unit 1, Davis Communications Annex and Grasslands Area Unit, Yolo&nbsp;
County (440 ac (178 ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit is geographically important (criterion 1) because it&nbsp;
contains one of only six areas where Neostapfia colusana is known to&nbsp;
occur (EIP Associates 2001; Yolo County Parks 2001; CNDDB 2002).&nbsp;
Species occurrences within the unit grow in large vernal playa pools of&nbsp;
the Pescadero soil series (Yolo County 1995; Holland 1998; USDA 2001).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit is located southeast of the City of Davis and south of&nbsp;
the South Fork of Putah Creek. This unit's western boundary coincides&nbsp;
with the Solano and Yolo County line. The unit contains land owned by&nbsp;
Yolo County. Approximately 322 ac (128 ha) is owned by the DoD.

Unit 3, Farmington Unit, Stanislaus County (38,408 ac (15,544 ha)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit supports Neostapfia colusana within vernal pools on&nbsp;
ecologically noteworthy high terrace landforms and Redding-Pentz-Peters&nbsp;
soil mapping unit complexes (criterion 2) (USDA 2001; CNDDB 2002). The&nbsp;
impermeable layers underlying these occupied vernal pools are generally&nbsp;
iron-silica cemented hardpan. Habitat in this unit includes deeper&nbsp;
pools that provide the long inundation period required for germination&nbsp;
of N. colusana (EIP Associates 1999). This unit is geographically&nbsp;
isolated from the other N. colusana units to the north by over 50 mi&nbsp;
(80 km) (criterion 1).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Farmington unit is located in northeast Stanislaus County. It&nbsp;
is hydrologically separated from other Neostapfia colusana units to the&nbsp;
south by the Stanislaus River. The eastern boundary generally parallels&nbsp;
the Calaveras County Line. Woodward Reservoir and the town of Oakdale&nbsp;
are all located outside and to the west of the unit. The unit is&nbsp;
generally south of State Highway 4 and north of State Highway 108. The&nbsp;
unit boundary is drawn to include these species' occurrences and the&nbsp;
vernal pool complexes that Holland (1998) mapped and are visible on&nbsp;
SPOT imagery. Lands within this unit are privately owned.

Unit 4, Waterford Unit, Stanislaus and Tuolumne Counties (70,810 ac&nbsp;
(28,657 ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Waterford Unit is important for the conservation of the&nbsp;
geographic diversity of the species (criterion 1) because it contains&nbsp;
20 percent of all extant Neostapfia colusana occurrences (CNDDB 2002).&nbsp;
These occurrences are found within vernal pool complexes formed on&nbsp;
alluvial terraces and associated Whitney soils, among others. This unit&nbsp;
contains vernal pools, swales, and other ephemeral wetlands formed on&nbsp;
acidic soils of alluvial fans and stream terraces along the eastern&nbsp;
margin of the San Joaquin Valley and into the adjacent foothills. These&nbsp;
varied vernal pool habitats are essential for the conservation of the&nbsp;
species because they provide a diversity of habitat for the species&nbsp;
(criterion 2).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Waterford Unit is bordered by the Stanislaus River to the north&nbsp;
and the Tuolumne River to the south. The City of La Grange is located&nbsp;
southeast of this unit. Stanislaus County Road J9 runs west of the&nbsp;
unit, and the City of Oakdale is located outside of the northwest&nbsp;
corner. The eastern boundary extends into the low-elevation foothills&nbsp;
of the Sierra Nevada. Vernal pool complexes in the Waterford Unit are&nbsp;
mainly located in eastern Stanislaus County, but overlap into&nbsp;
southwestern Tuolumne County. Lands within this unit are mostly&nbsp;
privately owned. Approximately 2 ac (0.8 ha) of this unit are lands&nbsp;
administered by the CDFG.

Unit 5, Turlock Unit, Stanislaus and Merced Counties (35,508 ac (14,370&nbsp;
ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit encompasses large, playa vernal pools where the species&nbsp;
is found, including the Hickman vernal pool complex in Stanislaus&nbsp;
County (Holland 1998; CNDDB 2002). This unusual vernal pool complex&nbsp;
provides a unique habitat for Neostapfia colusana (criterion 2), as&nbsp;
well as a number of other vernal pool species. Not only does the&nbsp;
Hickman pool complex contain one of the largest vernal lakes in&nbsp;
California, occupying more than 300 ac (121 ha), but it also exhibits&nbsp;
tremendous biodiversity (Medeiros 2000).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Turlock Unit is bordered by the Tuolumne River to the north and&nbsp;
the Merced River to the south. The unit lies between the towns of La&nbsp;
Grange and Snelling. Stanislaus County Road J9 runs west of the unit&nbsp;
and the eastern edge is located in the low elevation foothills of the&nbsp;
Sierra Nevada. Vernal pool complexes in the Turlock Unit are located in&nbsp;
Stanislaus and Merced Counties. Approximately 41 ac (17 ha) of lands&nbsp;
within this unit are owned by the California State Parks.

Unit 6, Merced Unit, Merced and Mariposa Counties (93,125 ac (36,688&nbsp;
ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit is geographically important (criterion 1) because it&nbsp;
contains over 40 percent of all known Neostapfia colusana occurrences&nbsp;
(CNDDB 2002). The unit also contains a diversity of vernal pool&nbsp;
habitats for N. colusana, including the only locations where this&nbsp;
species is known to occur on Keyes'--Pentz, Redding, and Keyes soils&nbsp;
(criterion 2) (USDA 2001). Although many occurrences of N. colusana&nbsp;
have been extirpated in the past two decades, the occurrences in the&nbsp;
Merced Unit are among the most robust remaining

[[Page 46738]]

(criterion 4) (Holland 2000). The area within this unit encompasses the&nbsp;
largest block of pristine, high-density vernal pool grasslands&nbsp;
remaining in California (Vollmar 1999).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A majority of the vernal pool habitat in the Merced Unit is in&nbsp;
Merced County, although the eastern edge of the unit overlaps into&nbsp;
Mariposa County in the low-elevation foothills of the Sierra Nevada.&nbsp;
The northern boundary parallels the Merced River, and Bear Creek serves&nbsp;
as the southern border. The entire unit is located east of Highway 99.&nbsp;
The majority of the land in this unit is privately owned and&nbsp;
approximately 8 ac (3 ha) of lands within this unit are owned by the&nbsp;
Federal government.

Tuctoria greenei

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Greene's tuctoria occurrences are known from eight general areas of&nbsp;
concentration from Shasta County to Madera County with an elevational&nbsp;
variation of from near 30 m (100 ft) to near 1,067 m (3,500 ft).&nbsp;
Conserving a broad distribution of Greene's tuctoria across its&nbsp;
geographical and elevational distribution protects the natural&nbsp;
environmental processes for the species and provides the best chance&nbsp;
for retaining the species across the full extent of the its range. The&nbsp;
vernal pool types and soils associated with the eight areas of&nbsp;
concentration of Greene's tuctoria differ greatly across the geographic&nbsp;
range of the species; these differences lead to different species&nbsp;
compositions and environmental conditions between Greene's tuctoria&nbsp;
occurrences. Providing for a mosaic of habitat types both between and&nbsp;
among vernal pool species occurrences is essential to the species&nbsp;
conservation because it would include the full extent of the physical&nbsp;
and environmental conditions for the species (Fugate 1992; Fugate 1998;&nbsp;
Gonzales et al.1996; Ikeda and Schlising 1990; Noss et al. 2002a;&nbsp;
Platenkamp 1998; Zedler et al. 1979). The wide-ranging distribution of&nbsp;
Greene's tuctoria reflects a diversity of vernal pool habitat types&nbsp;
that provide habitat for the species. Vernal pool complexes that&nbsp;
provide suitable habitat for this species include four different&nbsp;
physiographic and edaphic settings--old high stream terrace, lower old&nbsp;
stream terrace areas with soils having an iron-silica hardpan, sites&nbsp;
with shallow soils underlain by cemented tuffaceous alluvium, and&nbsp;
vernal pool complexes on claypan soils that are slightly acid to&nbsp;
slightly alkaline. Not all areas of Greene's tuctoria have been&nbsp;
identified as to the specific soil series or soil mapping units where&nbsp;
they occur. The Butte County occurrences of Greene's tuctoria are&nbsp;
associated with soils underlain by tuffaceous alluvium, are considered&nbsp;
to occur in Northern Basalt Flow and Northern Volcanic Mudflow type&nbsp;
vernal pool complexes, and one occurrence is found on Tuscan soils. The&nbsp;
Tehama County occurrences are associated with slightly to medium acid&nbsp;
soils of the Tuscan and Anita soil series that are underlain by an&nbsp;
iron-silica cemented hardpan occurring vernal pools and are the only&nbsp;
area where vernal pools are associated with this type of landform. Many&nbsp;
of these pools are a fraction of an acre and have a short inundation&nbsp;
period and fewer number of shallower larger pool sizes well over an&nbsp;
acre with a comparatively longer inundation period. A vernal pool's&nbsp;
parent material greatly influences the pool's species composition and&nbsp;
hydrologic functioning (Hanes and Stromberg 1998; Holland and Jain&nbsp;
1981; 1988). Soils beneath vernal pools are extremely variable and are&nbsp;
not the same as soils mapped by soil surveys, but are usually&nbsp;
undescribed hydric inclusions that vary by location (Holland and Dain&nbsp;
1990). The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for&nbsp;
Tuctoria greenei are the habitat components that provide:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) Vernal pools, swales, and other ephemeral wetlands and&nbsp;
depressions of appropriate sizes and depths and the adjacent upland&nbsp;
margins of these depressions that sustain Tuctoria greenei germination,&nbsp;
growth and reproduction, including but not limited to, Northern&nbsp;
Claypan, Northern Hardpan, and Northern Basalt flow vernal pools that&nbsp;
typically become inundated during winter rains, but are dry during the&nbsp;
summer and do not necessarily fill with water every year; and
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) The associated watershed(s) and hydrologic features, including&nbsp;
the pool basin, swales, and surrounding uplands (which may vary in&nbsp;
extent depending on pool size and depth, soil type and depth, hardpan&nbsp;
or claypan type and extent, topography, and climate) that contribute to&nbsp;
the filling and drying of the vernal pool or ephemeral wetland, and&nbsp;
that maintain suitable periods of pool inundation, water quality, and&nbsp;
soil moisture for Tuctoria greenei germination, growth and&nbsp;
reproduction, and dispersal, but not necessarily every year.

Unit 1, Modoc Plateau Unit, Lassen and Shasta Counties (1,703 ac (689&nbsp;
ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit contains a Tuctoria greenei occurrence within Northern&nbsp;
Basalt Flow vernal pools (CNDDB 2002). It is the only location where&nbsp;
the species grows on this vernal pool type. The occurrence is located&nbsp;
in an area described as a large vernal pool in an open flat in an&nbsp;
eastside pine forest. It is at a higher elevation, with lower average&nbsp;
temperatures, than any other occurrence. Thus the unit is ecologically&nbsp;
unique (criterion 2). It also represents the northern extent of the&nbsp;
species' range, and is separated from occurrences to the south by over&nbsp;
68 mi (110 km) (criterion 1).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit occurs within the volcanic plateau of northeastern&nbsp;
California. The unit is located in the area surrounding Murken Lake&nbsp;
east of Hat Creek near Cinder Butte. Bidwell Road crosses through the&nbsp;
southern boundary. The USFS owns approximately 1,530 ac (619 ha) of the&nbsp;
unit. The remaining lands within this unit are privately owned.

Unit 2, Vina Unit, Tehama and Butte Counties (25,102 ac (10,159 ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit is essential to the conservation of Tuctoria greenei&nbsp;
because it includes 60 percent of the remaining extant occurrences of&nbsp;
the species (criterion 1) (CNDDB 2002). The unit also represents one of&nbsp;
only two areas throughout the species' range where T. greenei&nbsp;
occurrences are not considered to be declining (CNDDB 2002). The&nbsp;
species occurs in vernal pool complexes within the unit found on Anita&nbsp;
and Tuscan series soils.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit for Tuctoria greenei occupies the area south of Toomes&nbsp;
Creek, and north of Pine Creek and the Cana Highway. State Route 99&nbsp;
bisects this unit and the western boundary generally parallels the&nbsp;
Southern Pacific Railway line. The majority of the lands included&nbsp;
within this unit are privately owned. Property ownership within this&nbsp;
unit includes various types of protected lands (criterion 4), including&nbsp;
CDFG (1 ac (0.4 ha)), CDFG administered lands (1 ac (0.4 ha)), TNC&nbsp;
(5,738 ac (2,295 ha)), TNC easements (11,653 ac (4,661 ha)), and WRP&nbsp;
easements and agreements (142 ac (57 ha)).

Unit 6, Waterford Unit, Stanislaus and Tuolumne Counties (73,111 ac&nbsp;
(29,588 ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit supports occurrences of the species within the only&nbsp;
vernal pools where Tuctoria greenei is known to occur on slightly&nbsp;
alkaline soils of the Meikle and Paulsell series (criterion 2) (Holland&nbsp;
1998; USDA 2001; CNDDB 2002). It is also important to the conservation&nbsp;
of the geographic distribution of the species because it is one of only&nbsp;
eight locations where the species remains extant (criterion 1). The&nbsp;
Waterford Unit is bordered by the Stanislaus River to the north and the&nbsp;
Tuolumne River to the south. The City of La Grange is located southeast&nbsp;
of the unit. Stanislaus County Road J9 runs

[[Page 46739]]

west of the unit, and the Oakdale Airport is located outside of the&nbsp;
northwest corner. The eastern boundary extends into the low-elevation&nbsp;
foothills of the Sierra Nevada. Vernal pool complexes in the Waterford&nbsp;
Unit are located mainly in eastern Stanislaus County, but overlap into&nbsp;
southwestern Tuolumne County. Approximately (2 ac (0.8 ha)) of this&nbsp;
unit is administered by the CDFG. The remaining lands within this unit&nbsp;
are privately owned.

Unit 7, Merced Unit, Merced, Madera, and Mariposa Counties (133,460 ac&nbsp;
(54,011 ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit contains numerous occurrences of the species within&nbsp;
large, hydrologically intact vernal pool complexes areas (criterion 4)&nbsp;
(Holland 1998; Vollmar 1999), including Northern Hardpan vernal pools&nbsp;
on Redding, Raynor, and Bear Creek soils series (EIP 1999; USDA 2001).&nbsp;
These soil and vernal pool type combinations are not otherwise well&nbsp;
represented (criterion 2). Over 30 percent of the extant occurrences of&nbsp;
Tuctoria greenei are in the Merced Unit (criterion 1) (CNDDB 2002).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A majority of the vernal pool habitat in the Merced Unit is in&nbsp;
Merced County. The eastern edge of the unit overlaps into Mariposa&nbsp;
County and in the south it extends to the Chowchilla River in Madera&nbsp;
County. The northern boundary parallels the Merced River. The entire&nbsp;
unit is located east of Highway 99. Approximately 8 ac (3 ha) is owned&nbsp;
by the Federal government and the rest is privately owned. TNC has&nbsp;
11,283 ac (4,513 ha) of easement lands within this unit. The remaining&nbsp;
lands within this unit are privately owned.

Orcuttia pilosa

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hairy Orcutt grass occurrences are known from southern Tehama&nbsp;
County in the Sacramento Valley to southern Madera County in the San&nbsp;
Joaquin Valley with a predominate elevational variation of from near 55&nbsp;
m (180 ft) to near 123 m (405 ft). Conserving a broad distribution of&nbsp;
hairy Orcutt grass across its geographical and elevational distribution&nbsp;
protects the natural environmental processes for the species and&nbsp;
provides the best chance for retaining the species across the full&nbsp;
extent of its range. The vernal pool types and soils associated with&nbsp;
the six areas of concentration of hairy Orcutt grass differ greatly&nbsp;
across the geographic range of the species; these differences lead to&nbsp;
different species compositions and environmental conditions between&nbsp;
hairy Orcutt grass occurrences. Providing for a mosaic of habitat types&nbsp;
both between and among vernal pool species occurrences is essential to&nbsp;
the species' conservation because it would include the full extent of&nbsp;
the physical and environmental conditions for the species (Fugate 1992;&nbsp;
Fugate 1998; Gonzales et al.1996; Ikeda and Schlising 1990; Noss et al.&nbsp;
2002a; Platenkamp 1998; Zedler et al. 1979). The distribution of hairy&nbsp;
Orcutt grass reflects a diversity of vernal pool habitat types that&nbsp;
provide habitat for the species on the alluvial fans and old stream&nbsp;
terraces of the Sierra Nevada foothills. Vernal pool complexes that&nbsp;
provide suitable habitat for this species include mostly three&nbsp;
different physiographic and edaphic settings--old high and lower old&nbsp;
stream terrace areas with soils having an iron-silica hardpan and sites&nbsp;
with shallow soils underlain by cemented tuffaceous alluvium. The&nbsp;
Tehama County occurrences of hairy Orcutt grass are associated with&nbsp;
slightly to medium acid soils of the Tuscan and Anita soil series that&nbsp;
are underlain by an iron-silica cemented hardpan. Not all areas of&nbsp;
hairy Orcutt grass have been identified as to the specific soil series&nbsp;
or soil mapping units on which they occur. Many of the occupied vernal&nbsp;
pools vary in size from 3,400 sq m (36,600 sq ft) to 250 ha (618 ac). A&nbsp;
vernal pool's parent material greatly influences the pool's species&nbsp;
composition and hydrologic functioning (Hanes and Stromberg 1998;&nbsp;
Holland and Jain 1981, 1988). Soils beneath vernal pools are extremely&nbsp;
variable and are not the same as soils mapped by soil surveys, but are&nbsp;
usually undescribed hydric inclusions that vary upon location (Holland&nbsp;
and Dain 1990). The primary constituent elements of critical habitat&nbsp;
for Orcuttia pilosa are the habitat components that provide:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) Vernal pools, swales, and other ephemeral wetlands and&nbsp;
depressions of appropriate sizes and depths and the adjacent upland&nbsp;
margins of these depressions that sustain Orcuttia pilosa germination,&nbsp;
growth and reproduction, including but not limited to features&nbsp;
occurring on both acidic and saline-alkaline soils, with an iron-silica&nbsp;
cemented hardpan or claypan, and that typically become inundated during&nbsp;
winter rains, but are dry during the summer and do not necessarily fill&nbsp;
with water every year; and
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) The associated watershed(s) and hydrologic features, including&nbsp;
the pool basin, swales, and surrounding uplands (which may vary in&nbsp;
extent depending on pool size and depth, soil type and depth, hardpan&nbsp;
or claypan type and extent, topography, and climate) that contribute to&nbsp;
the filling and drying of the vernal pool or ephemeral wetland, and&nbsp;
that maintain suitable periods of pool inundation, water quality, and&nbsp;
soil moisture for Orcuttia pilosa germination, growth and reproduction,&nbsp;
and dispersal, but not necessarily every year.

Unit 1, Vina Plains Unit, Tehama and Butte Counties (19,306 ac (7,813&nbsp;
ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This area supports over 25 percent of all known occurrences of the&nbsp;
species, and represents the northern extent of the species range&nbsp;
(criterion 1) (CNDDB 2002). It is over 25 mi (40 kmi) from the nearest&nbsp;
occurrence to the south. Species occurrences in the unit grow in large&nbsp;
vernal pools on Tuscan and Anita soils (USDA 2001). This area&nbsp;
represents one of only two occupied locations that have some form of&nbsp;
special habitat protection (criterion 4).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The unit for Orcuttia pilosa occupies the area south of Deer Creek&nbsp;
and north of Pine Creek to near Cana Highway. California State Route 99&nbsp;
bisects the unit and the western boundary generally parallels the&nbsp;
Southern Pacific Railway line. The majority of the lands included&nbsp;
within this unit are privately owned. Land ownership includes 5,660 ac&nbsp;
(2,264 ha) owned by TNC, which also has additional 9,564 ac (3,826 ha)&nbsp;
of conservation easements within this unit, and 142 ac (57 ha) of&nbsp;
private land protected by conservation easement or agreement under the&nbsp;
WRP.

Unit 4, Turlock Unit, Stanislaus and Merced Counties (48,649 ac (19,688&nbsp;
ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vernal pool complexes in the Turlock Unit are located in eastern&nbsp;
Stanislaus and Merced Counties. The unit contains occurrences of&nbsp;
Orcuttia pilosa within vernal pool complexes on Whitney and Meikle soil&nbsp;
mapping units, which are not otherwise well represented (criterion 2)&nbsp;
(Holland 1998; USDA 2001; CNDDB 2002). This unit also contains the&nbsp;
Hickman pools in Stanislaus County, and a high concentration of O.&nbsp;
pilosa occurrences (CNDDB 2002). The Hickman pool complex contains one&nbsp;
of the largest vernal lakes in California at more than 300 ac (121 ha)&nbsp;
and represents a unique habitat for O. pilosa (criterion 2). The unit&nbsp;
encompasses large, intact vernal pool complexes that are more likely to&nbsp;
allow the species to persist over time (criterion 4).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Turlock Unit is bordered by the Tuolumne River to the north and&nbsp;
the Merced River to the south. It lies between the towns of La Grange&nbsp;
and Snelling. Stanislaus County Road J9 runs west of the unit and the&nbsp;
eastern edge is located in the low elevation foothills of the Sierra&nbsp;
Nevada. Land ownership within this unit includes BLM (17 ac (7 ha)) and&nbsp;
California State Parks (41 ac (17 ha)). The remaining land within this&nbsp;
unit is privately owned.

[[Page 46740]]

Orcuttia viscida

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sacramento Orcutt grass is found in naturally occurring scattered&nbsp;
vernal pool complexes in Sacramento County, California, and is the most&nbsp;
geographically restricted Orcuttieae species. The specific vernal pool&nbsp;
characteristics that determine the suitability for Sacramento Orcutt&nbsp;
grass germination, growth and reproduction are not well understood.&nbsp;
Sacramento Orcutt grass occurrences are known from only in eastern&nbsp;
Sacramento County in the Sacramento Valley with a predominant&nbsp;
elevational variation of 45 m (150 ft) to 114 m (375 ft). Conserving a&nbsp;
broad distribution of Sacramento Orcutt grass across its rather&nbsp;
relatively narrow geographical and elevational distribution protects&nbsp;
the natural environmental processes for the species and provides the&nbsp;
best chance for retaining the species across the full extent of the&nbsp;
species range.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The vernal pool types and soils associated with the three areas of&nbsp;
concentration of Sacramento Orcutt grass differ across the geographic&nbsp;
range of the species and leads to different species compositions and&nbsp;
environmental conditions between Sacramento Orcutt grass occurrences.&nbsp;
Providing for a mosaic of habitat types both between and among vernal&nbsp;
pool species occurrences is essential to the species conservation&nbsp;
because it would include the full extent of the physical and&nbsp;
environmental conditions for the species (Fugate 1992, Fugate 1998,&nbsp;
Gonzales et al. 1996, Ikeda and Schlising 1990, Noss et al. 2002a,&nbsp;
Platenkamp 1998, Zedler et al. 1979). The distribution of Sacramento&nbsp;
Orcutt grass reflects a relatively smaller diversity of vernal pool&nbsp;
habitat types that provide habitat for the species on the old stream&nbsp;
terraces of the Sierra Nevada foothills. Vernal pool complexes that&nbsp;
provide suitable habitat for this species include one physiographic and&nbsp;
edaphic settings-remnant depositional stream terraces at the base of&nbsp;
the Sierran foothills. The Sacramento County occurrences of Sacramento&nbsp;
Orcutt grass are associated with Redding soils that are strongly acidic&nbsp;
underlain by an iron-silica cemented hardpan and with soils mapped in&nbsp;
the Pentz-Pardee-Red Bluff association. Not all areas of Sacramento&nbsp;
Orcutt grass have been identified as to the specific soil series or&nbsp;
soil mapping units where they occur. Many of the occupied vernal pools&nbsp;
vary in size from 1,000 sq m (0.3 ac) to 8,260 sq m (2 ac). The parent&nbsp;
material of vernal pools greatly influences species composition and&nbsp;
hydrologic functioning of the vernal pool (Hanes and Stromberg 1998,&nbsp;
Holland and Jain 1981, 1988). Soils beneath vernal pools are extremely&nbsp;
variable and are not the same as soils mapped by soil surveys, but are&nbsp;
usually undescribed hydric inclusions that vary upon location (Holland&nbsp;
and Dain 1990). The primary constituent elements of critical habitat&nbsp;
for Orcuttia viscida are the habitat components that provide:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) Vernal pools, swales, and other ephemeral wetlands and&nbsp;
depressions of appropriate sizes and depths and the adjacent upland&nbsp;
margins of these depressions that sustain Orcuttia viscida germination,&nbsp;
growth and reproduction, including but not limited to vernal pools on&nbsp;
high terrace landforms on acidic soils such as Red Bluff, Redding, and&nbsp;
Corning soil series. These habitats typically become inundated during&nbsp;
winter rains, but are dry during the summer and do not necessarily fill&nbsp;
with water every year; and
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) The associated watershed(s) and hydrologic features, including&nbsp;
the pool basin, swales, and surrounding uplands (which may vary in&nbsp;
extent depending on pool size and depth, soil type and depth, hardpan&nbsp;
or claypan type and extent, topography, and climate) that contribute to&nbsp;
the filling and drying of the vernal pool or ephemeral wetland, and&nbsp;
that maintain suitable periods of pool inundation, water quality, and&nbsp;
soil moisture for Orcuttia viscida germination, growth and&nbsp;
reproduction, and dispersal, but not necessarily every year.

Unit 3, Rancho Seco Unit, Sacramento and Amador Counties (35,078 ac&nbsp;
(14,196 ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit marks the southern extent of the range of Orcuttia&nbsp;
viscida, and is one of only three areas where the species remains&nbsp;
extant (criterion 1). It supports occurrences of the species within&nbsp;
relatively undisturbed high terrace vernal pool complexes on Corning&nbsp;
and Redding soil mapping units. Corning soils are not common to the&nbsp;
other two units (criterion 2).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit occupies the area south of Laguna Creek and north of the&nbsp;
Sacramento and San Joaquin County line along Dry Creek. The eastern&nbsp;
boundary is the low elevation foothills of western Amador County. The&nbsp;
western limit is bounded by urban and agricultural areas near the&nbsp;
cities of Galt and Elk Grove, and along the foothill region of the&nbsp;
southeastern Sacramento Valley. The western boundary also marks a&nbsp;
change from high terrace soils in the region, including Corning and&nbsp;
Redding soil mapping units that comprise the extent of Orcuttia viscida&nbsp;
habitat. The northern and southern boundaries of this unit exclude&nbsp;
urban and agricultural areas. The majority of land within this unit is&nbsp;
privately owned, but some includes additional protection which will&nbsp;
help the species occurrences to persist over time (criterion 4). TNC&nbsp;
owns 7,736 ac (3,094 ha) and an additional 11 ac (5 ha) of private land&nbsp;
is protected by WRP easements or agreements.

Orcuttia inaequalis

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; San Joaquin Valley Orcutt grass is found in naturally occurring&nbsp;
widely scattered vernal pool complexes in Fresno, Madera, Merced,&nbsp;
Stanislaus, and Tulare counties in the northeastern San Joaquin&nbsp;
Valleys. San Joaquin Valley is the only species found just in the San&nbsp;
Joaquin Valley. The specific vernal pool characteristics that determine&nbsp;
the suitability for San Joaquin Valley Orcutt grass germination,&nbsp;
growth, and successful reproduction are unknown. However, San Joaquin&nbsp;
Valley is a strict endemic to usually larger vernal pools that range in&nbsp;
area from 140 sq m (1,500 sq ft) to 4.9 ha (12.1 ac) in size and 30.5&nbsp;
cm (12 in) to 55.9 cm (22 in) deep but can be found in both smaller and&nbsp;
larger and shallower and deeper vernal pools (Stone et al. 1988, Volmar&nbsp;
2002). San Joaquin Valley is found in vernal pool complexes on a&nbsp;
variety of geological surfaces including Ione, Laguna, Merthen,&nbsp;
Modesto, North Merced Gravels, Riverbank, Turlock Lake, and Valley&nbsp;
Springs in the northeastern San Joaquin Valley.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; San Joaquin Valley Orcutt grass occurrences are known from central&nbsp;
Merced County to northern Tulare County in the northeastern San Joaquin&nbsp;
Valley with a predominate elevational variation of near 47 m (155 ft)&nbsp;
to near 570 m (1,870 ft). Conserving a broad distribution San Joaquin&nbsp;
Valley Orcutt grass across its geographical and elevational&nbsp;
distribution protects the natural environmental processes for the&nbsp;
species and provides the best chance for retaining the species across&nbsp;
the full extent of the species range.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The vernal pool types and soils associated with the six areas of&nbsp;
concentration of San Joaquin Valley Orcutt grass differ greatly across&nbsp;
the geographic range of the species and leads to different species&nbsp;
compositions and environmental conditions between San Joaquin Valley&nbsp;
Orcutt grass occurrences. Providing for a mosaic of habitat types both&nbsp;
between and among vernal pool species occurrences is essential to the&nbsp;
species conservation because it would include the full extent of the&nbsp;
physical and environmental conditions for the species (Fugate 1992,&nbsp;
Fugate 1998, Gonzales et al.1996, Ikeda and Schlising 1990, Noss et al.&nbsp;
2002a,

[[Page 46741]]

Platenkamp 1998, Zedler et al. 1979). The distribution of San Joaquin&nbsp;
Valley Orcutt grass reflects a diversity of vernal pool habitat types&nbsp;
that provide habitat for the species on the alluvial fans and old&nbsp;
stream terraces of the Sierra Nevada foothills. Vernal pool complexes&nbsp;
that provide suitable habitat for this species include mostly three&nbsp;
different physiographic and edaphic settings; old high old stream&nbsp;
terrace areas with Redding and related soil series; lower old stream&nbsp;
terraces with San Joaquin and related soil series having an iron-silica&nbsp;
hardpan but less strongly acidic sites with shallow, residual soils of&nbsp;
the Pentz and related soil series underlain by a well-cemented&nbsp;
tuffaceous alluvium. One occurrence in Fresno County is found in a&nbsp;
rather shallow stony moderately to strongly acidic vernal pool complex&nbsp;
on residual soils of the Hideaway series at a relatively high&nbsp;
elevation. Not all areas of San Joaquin Valley Orcutt grass have been&nbsp;
identified as to the specific soil series or soil mapping units on&nbsp;
which they occur. The parent material of vernal pools greatly&nbsp;
influences species composition and hydrologic functioning of the vernal&nbsp;
pool (Hanes and Stromberg 1998, Holland and Jain 1981, 1988). Soils&nbsp;
beneath vernal pools are extremely variable and are not the same as&nbsp;
soils mapped by soil surveys, but are usually undescribed hydric&nbsp;
inclusions that vary upon location (Holland and Dain 1990). The primary&nbsp;
constituent elements of critical habitat for Orcuttia inaequalis are&nbsp;
the habitat components that provide:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) Vernal pools, swales, and other ephemeral wetlands and&nbsp;
depressions of appropriate sizes and depths and the adjacent upland&nbsp;
margins of these depressions that sustain Orcuttia inaequalis&nbsp;
germination, growth and reproduction, including but not limited to&nbsp;
vernal pools on alluvial fans, high and low stream terraces, and&nbsp;
tabletop lava flows. These habitats typically become inundated during&nbsp;
winter rains, but are dry during the summer and do not necessarily fill&nbsp;
with water every year; and
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) The associated watershed(s) and hydrologic features, including&nbsp;
the pool basin, swales, and surrounding uplands (which may vary in&nbsp;
extent depending on pool size and depth, soil type and depth, hardpan&nbsp;
or claypan type and extent, topography, and climate) that contribute to&nbsp;
the filling and drying of the vernal pool or ephemeral wetland, and&nbsp;
that maintain suitable periods of pool inundation, water quality, and&nbsp;
soil moisture for Orcuttia inaequalis germination, growth and&nbsp;
reproduction, and dispersal, but not necessarily every year.

Unit 1, Merced Unit, Merced and Mariposa Counties (93,125 ac (37,699&nbsp;
ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit is an important representative of the geographic&nbsp;
diversity of Orcuttia inaequalis (criterion 1) because it supports over&nbsp;
half of the known occurrences of the species, and represents the&nbsp;
northernmost extent of the species' current range (CNDDB 2001). It is&nbsp;
also ecologically important (criterion 2) because it contains the only&nbsp;
area where O. inaequalis is found on vernal pools formed on Corning and&nbsp;
Greenfield soils, and one of only two sites where it is found on San&nbsp;
Joaquin soils (Holland 1998; EIP 1999; USDA 2001). This unit supports&nbsp;
some of the largest, most robust occurrences of the species (Holland&nbsp;
2000). The area within this unit encompasses the largest block of&nbsp;
pristine, high density vernal pool grasslands remaining in California,&nbsp;
increasing the likelihood that it will continue to support occurrences&nbsp;
of the species into the future (criterion 4) (Vollmar 1999).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A majority of the vernal pool habitat in the Merced Unit is in&nbsp;
Merced County, although the eastern edge of the unit overlaps into&nbsp;
Mariposa County in the low elevation foothills of the Sierra Nevada.&nbsp;
The entire unit is located east of State Highway 99. A majority of the&nbsp;
land in the Merced Unit is privately owned. Approximately 8 ac (3 ha)&nbsp;
of this unit is owned by the Federal government. TNC has 8,559 ac&nbsp;
(3,424 ha) of easement lands within this unit.

Unit 2, Le Grand Unit, Merced, Mariposa, and Madera Counties (32,152 ac&nbsp;
(13,012ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit supports Orcuttia inaequalis occurrences within vernal&nbsp;
pools formed on alluvial terraces on Raynor clay soils (CNDDB 2001).&nbsp;
The lack of such soils at other occurrence sites makes the unit&nbsp;
ecologically important (criterion 2). The Le Grand Unit is also&nbsp;
essential for the conservation of the species because it contains large&nbsp;
intact and contiguous vernal pool grassland areas that provide&nbsp;
connectivity between units to the north and south (criterion 3). This&nbsp;
unit is important to maintain the range of habitats in which the&nbsp;
species is known to occur.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Le Grand Unit contains an area where Orcuttia inaequalis was&nbsp;
introduced into six created pools. It germinated and flowered in five&nbsp;
of them during the 2 years following its introduction (Durgarian 1995;&nbsp;
Stebbins et al. 1995) and was still present in 2000 (Faubion, in litt.&nbsp;
2000), thus demonstrating the suitability of the habitat to support&nbsp;
this species. This site is now treated as an occurrence by the CNDDB&nbsp;
(2001). The Madera Irrigation District manages the property, which is&nbsp;
owned by the BOR (Stebbins et al. 1995).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A majority of the vernal pool habitat in the Le Grand Unit is in&nbsp;
eastern Merced County. The eastern edge of the unit overlaps into&nbsp;
Mariposa County and in the south it extends to the Madera County line.&nbsp;
Bear Creek serves as the northern boundary. The entire unit is located&nbsp;
east of State Highway 99. TNC has 1,070 ac (428 ha) of easement lands&nbsp;
within this unit. The remaining lands are privately owned.

Unit 4, Fresno Unit, Fresno County (7,451 ac (3,016 ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit contains Orcuttia inaequalis occurrences within vernal&nbsp;
pools formed on Fallbrook, Ramona, San Joaquin, Vista, and Pollasky&nbsp;
soil series (CNDDB 2002). Possibly due to this variation of soil types,&nbsp;
vernal pool habitat in this unit is less dense than habitat in units&nbsp;
further north. The diversity of vernal pool types found within the&nbsp;
Fresno Unit contributes to the range of ecological conditions in which&nbsp;
O. inaequalis occurs (criterion 2). Vernal pool types within this unit&nbsp;
include Northern Hardpan vernal pools. The unit is also likely to be&nbsp;
important because it provides connectivity for pollen and seeds between&nbsp;
units 3 and 5 (criterion 3).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Located in Fresno County, this unit contains vernal pool habitat&nbsp;
south of Millerton Lake and east of the San Joaquin River. The eastern&nbsp;
boundary parallels the low elevation foothill region of the Sierra&nbsp;
Nevada. All the land within this unit is privately owned.

Unit 5A, Table Mountain Unit, Fresno County (4,258 ac (1,723 ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This area supports Orcuttia inaequalis occurrences within Northern&nbsp;
Basalt Flow vernal pools (Holland 1998; Keeler-Wolf et al. 1998; CNDDB&nbsp;
2002). This is the only area in which the species is known to occur&nbsp;
within these pool types (criterion 2) (CNDDB 2002). Northern Basalt&nbsp;
Flow vernal pool complexes are an extremely rare vernal pool habitat&nbsp;
occurring only on ancient terraces and hilltops above the surrounding&nbsp;
low-lying terrain. They typically contain small, irregularly clustered&nbsp;
pools with ``flashy hydrology'' (Keeler-Wolf et al. 1998). This unit is&nbsp;
also geographically noteworthy (criterion 1) because it marks the&nbsp;
easternmost extent of the range, and includes occurrences at the&nbsp;
highest elevations for the species.

[[Page 46742]]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit contains protected lands at the Big Table Mountain&nbsp;
Ecological Reserve, which may help the species persist here over time&nbsp;
(criterion 4). The Federal government owns 350 ac (142 ha) of this&nbsp;
unit, the State owns 419 ac (170 ha), and TNC has 650 ac (260 ha) of&nbsp;
conservation easements within this unit. This unit also contains an&nbsp;
occurrence of Orcuttia inaequalis that is partially on public land&nbsp;
administered by the BLM. The pool supports the second-largest&nbsp;
population of the species known to be extant (CNDDB 2001).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unit 5 for Orcuttia inaequalis is comprised of two subunits. Both&nbsp;
subunits are located east of Millerton Lake on basalt mesas above the&nbsp;
San Joaquin River. Subunit 5B is located on Kennedy Table in Madera&nbsp;
County, and Subunit 5A is directly south of this unit across the San&nbsp;
Joaquin River on Table Mountain in Fresno County.

Unit 6A and B, Tulare Unit, Tulare County (15,243 ac (6,169 ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit contains Orcuttia inaequalis occurrences within vernal&nbsp;
pools on Madera and Greenfield soils (CNDDB 2001; USDA 2001). It&nbsp;
represents the southernmost extent of O. inaequalis range (criterion&nbsp;
1).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are two subunits within the Tulare Unit. The Tulare Unit is&nbsp;
located in northwestern Tulare County. Orcuttia inaequalis occurs on&nbsp;
CDFG land at Sequoia Fields Ecological Reserve (215 ac (88 ha));&nbsp;
however, most of the area within this unit is privately owned.

Orcuttia tenuis

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Slender Orcutt grass is found in five general areas of&nbsp;
concentration from south Sacramento County to the Modoc Plateau and&nbsp;
west to Lake County with an elevational variation of near 61 m (200 ft)&nbsp;
to near 1,067 m (3,500 ft). A broad distribution of slender Orcutt&nbsp;
grass across its geographical and elevational distribution protects the&nbsp;
natural environmental processes for the species and provides the best&nbsp;
chance for retaining the species across the full extent of the species&nbsp;
range.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The vernal pool types and soils associated with the five general&nbsp;
areas of concentration of slender Orcutt grass differ greatly across&nbsp;
the geographic range of the species and leads to different species&nbsp;
compositions and environmental conditions between slender Orcutt grass&nbsp;
occurrences. Providing for a mosaic of habitat types both between and&nbsp;
among vernal pool species is essential because it would include the&nbsp;
full extent of the physical and environmental conditions for the&nbsp;
species (Fugate 1992, Fugate 1998, Gonzales et al.1996, Ikeda and&nbsp;
Schlising 1990, Noss et al. 2002a, Platenkamp 1998, Zedler et al.&nbsp;
1979). The wide ranging distribution of slender Orcutt grass has lead&nbsp;
to a large diversity of vernal pool habitat types for the species. The&nbsp;
Modoc Plateau occurrences are associated mostly with Northern Basalt&nbsp;
Flow and Northern Volcanic Mudflow type vernal pools. These pools range&nbsp;
in size from a fraction of an acre to well over an acre with smaller&nbsp;
pools having a short inundation period. The parent material of vernal&nbsp;
pools greatly influences species composition and hydrologic functioning&nbsp;
of the vernal pool (Hanes and Stromberg 1998, Holland and Jain 1981,&nbsp;
1988). Soils beneath vernal pools are extremely variable and are not&nbsp;
the same as soils mapped by soil surveys, but are usually undescribed&nbsp;
hydric inclusions which vary upon location (Holland and Dain 1990). The&nbsp;
Lake County occurrences are associated with Ashflow type vernal pools&nbsp;
and are the only area where vernal pools are associated with this type&nbsp;
of landform. The Redding area vernal pools in the Northeastern&nbsp;
Sacramento Valley Vernal Pool Region occur on volcanic Tuscan Formation&nbsp;
or terrace-alluvial Redding soils. The hydrology within the terrace-
alluvial pools tend to be less flashy than those with a volcanic origin&nbsp;
(Keeler-Wolf et al. 1998). The soils associated with the Sacramento&nbsp;
County occurrences include those occurring on old terrace formations.&nbsp;
The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for Orcuttia&nbsp;
tenuis are the habitat components that provide:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) Vernal pools, swales, and other ephemeral wetlands and&nbsp;
depressions of appropriate sizes and depths and the adjacent upland&nbsp;
margins of these depressions that sustain Orcuttia tenuis germination,&nbsp;
growth and reproduction, including but not limited to, Northern&nbsp;
Volcanic Ashflow and Northern Volcanic Mudflow vernal pools (Sawyer and&nbsp;
Keeler-Wolf 1995) with iron-silica and bedrock hardpan impervious&nbsp;
layers, and that typically become inundated during winter rains, but&nbsp;
are dry during the summer and do not necessarily fill with water every&nbsp;
year; and
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) The associated watershed(s) and hydrologic features, including&nbsp;
the pool basin, swales, and surrounding uplands (which may vary in&nbsp;
extent depending on pool size and depth, soil type and depth, hardpan&nbsp;
or claypan type and extent, topography, and climate) that contribute to&nbsp;
the filling and drying of the vernal pool or ephemeral wetland, and&nbsp;
that maintain suitable periods of pool inundation, water quality, and&nbsp;
soil moisture for Orcuttia tenuis germination, growth and reproduction,&nbsp;
and dispersal, but not necessarily every year.

Unit 1A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and I, Modoc Plateau Unit, Plumas,&nbsp;
Lassen, Shasta, Modoc, and Siskiyou Counties (33,146 ac (13,414 ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit is important for the conservation of the geographic&nbsp;
diversity of the species because it represents the northernmost extent&nbsp;
of the range, and contains almost 25 percent of all known Orcuttia&nbsp;
tenuis occurrences. The species is found growing within Northern Basalt&nbsp;
Flow vernal pools occurring on Gooval, Lasvar, Lasvar-Pitvar, and&nbsp;
Nosoni soils (CNDDB 2002). These soils and vernal pool types are not&nbsp;
otherwise well represented (criterion 2). Occurrences in the unit are&nbsp;
all found on the Modoc Plateau, where they are located at higher&nbsp;
elevations (criterion 1) and experience colder climatic conditions&nbsp;
(criterion 2) than in any other area throughout the species range. The&nbsp;
Federal government owns 22,994 ac (9,306 ha) of this unit. The&nbsp;
remainder is privately owned.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit for Orcuttia tenuis consists of nine subunits largely&nbsp;
within the volcanic plateau of northeastern California. The nine&nbsp;
subunits are identified as the Lake Almanor, Crater Lake Mountain,&nbsp;
Poison Lake, Badger Mountain, Lost Creek, Goose Valley, Long Valley,&nbsp;
Cayton Creek, and Timbered Crater subunits. The Lake Almanor subunit is&nbsp;
located in Plumas County, on the southwestern part of Lake Almanor&nbsp;
along Humbug Humboldt Cross Road and State Route 89. The area extends&nbsp;
from near the shoreline upslope to the watershed boundary. The Crater&nbsp;
Lake Mountain subunit is located along Route 44 and encompasses the&nbsp;
northwestern portion of Crater Lake Mountain as well as Grays and&nbsp;
Harvey valleys. The watershed boundary was used to determine the extent&nbsp;
of this subregion. The Poison Lake subunit north of State Route 44 near&nbsp;
Pittville Road adjacent to South Cabin Reservoir and Ebey Lake. The&nbsp;
western boundary is near Halls Flat Road. The Badger Mountain subunit&nbsp;
is located north of Badger Mountain and east of State Route 89 and&nbsp;
South of Potato Butte. Little Bunch Grass Meadow is included in this&nbsp;
unit. The Lost Creek subunit is located south of Cinder Butte and west&nbsp;
of the Hat Creek Rim. Lost Creek near Wilcox Road is within this&nbsp;
subunit. The Goose Valley subunit is located in Shasta County northwest&nbsp;
of the intersection of State Route 299 and Route 89 in Goose Valley&nbsp;
north of Burney, California. The Long Valley subunit is located in Long&nbsp;
Valley west of Black Ranch Road south of Long Valley Mountain and east&nbsp;
of Lookout Mountain. The Cayton Creek

[[Page 46743]]

subunit is located in Shasta County north of Cayton Valley and Lake&nbsp;
Britton east of Route 89. The area includes the northwestern portion of&nbsp;
the watershed boundary for Fort Mountain along Red Mountain Road. The&nbsp;
subunit is located in the Shasta National Forest. The Timbered Crater&nbsp;
subunit is located on the Shasta/Modoc/Siskiyou County border near&nbsp;
Little Hot Springs Valley. The subunit includes the area adjacent to&nbsp;
Timbered Crater up to the Whitehorse Mountains and Day Road. The&nbsp;
Timbered Crater subunit includes an area which has been proposed to be&nbsp;
designated by the BLM as a Research Natural Area for vernal pools.

Unit 2A, B, and C, Stillwater Plains Unit, Shasta County (10,364 ac&nbsp;
(4,194 ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit is comprised of old alluvial terraces above the&nbsp;
Sacramento River associated with Igo, Tuscan, Moda, and Redding soils&nbsp;
(CNDDB 2002), which provide an important diversity of vernal pool&nbsp;
habitat (criterion 2) for the species. This unit represents the&nbsp;
northernmost extent of the range of Orcuttia tenuis in the Sacramento&nbsp;
Valley (criterion 1). The majority of the lands included within this&nbsp;
unit are privately owned. The BLM owns 81 ac (33 ha) in the unit, while&nbsp;
the NRCS holds conservation easements or agreements on an additional&nbsp;
130 ac (52 ha) through its WRP program.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Stillwater Plains Unit 2 contains three subunits. These are&nbsp;
located in the area east and south of the city of Redding near the&nbsp;
Redding Municipal Airport encompassing Stillwater Plains to the&nbsp;
confluence of the Sacramento River and Cow Creek.

Unit 3, Inskip Hill, Tehama and Shasta Counties (48,820 ac (19,757 ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit supports occurrences of Orcuttia tenuis within vernal&nbsp;
pools on Guenon, Inskip, Inks, and Toomes soils (CNDDB 2002). It is&nbsp;
important for maintaining a diversity of habitats for the species&nbsp;
(criterion 2), and to maintain the geographic distribution of the&nbsp;
species (criterion 1) because it supports over 40 percent of the known&nbsp;
species occurrences (CNDDB 2002). This unit is also geographically&nbsp;
important (criterion 1) because it contains large vernal pool complexes&nbsp;
that represent some of the last remaining lower elevation vernal pool&nbsp;
habitats in the northern Sacramento Valley.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Land ownership within this unit includes BLM (14,839 ac (6,005&nbsp;
ha)), and the State owns 709 ac (287 ha). TNC has conservation&nbsp;
easements on 15,575 ac (6,230 ha) within this unit. The remaining lands&nbsp;
included within this unit are privately owned. This unit occupies the&nbsp;
area south of the Tehama/Shasta County line south to Sevenmile Creek&nbsp;
near the Tuscan Buttes. The eastern boundary encompasses the vernal&nbsp;
pool habitats along the lower elevation bordering the Sacramento River.&nbsp;
The western boundary roughly follows the Sacramento River. Table&nbsp;
Mountain west of the Sacramento River north of Paynes Creek and Red&nbsp;
Bluff is included in this unit.

Unit 4, Vina Plains Unit, Tehama and Butte Counties (25,102 ac (10,159&nbsp;
ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit supports Orcuttia tenuis occurrences within vernal pools&nbsp;
on Tuscan loam and Inks soils (CNDDB 2002). It is geographically&nbsp;
noteworthy (criterion 1) for being the southernmost area occupied by&nbsp;
the species in the Northeastern Sacramento Valley vernal pool region,&nbsp;
as defined by Keeler-Wolf et al. (1998). The unit is over 100 mi (160&nbsp;
km) from the nearest area occupied by O. tenuis to the south.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit contains TNC's 4,600 ac (1,862 ha) Vina Plains preserve,&nbsp;
which will help assure that the species persists at the location into&nbsp;
the future (criterion 4). The majority of the lands included within&nbsp;
this unit are privately owned. Property ownership and protection within&nbsp;
this unit includes CDFG (1 ac (0.4 ha)), CDFG administered land (1 ac&nbsp;
(0.4 ha)), TNC (192 ac (77 ha)), TNC easements (11,653 ac (4,661 ha)),&nbsp;
and private land under WRP easements or agreements (142 (57 ha)).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit for Orcuttia tenuis occupies the area south of Toomes&nbsp;
Creek, and north of Pine Creek and the Cana Highway. State Route 99&nbsp;
bisects this unit and the western boundary generally parallels the&nbsp;
Southern Pacific Railway line in southeastern Tehama and northern Butte&nbsp;
Counties.

Unit 5A and B, Bogg's Lake Unit, Clear Lake Area, Lake County (4,191 ac&nbsp;
(1,696 ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit is ecologically important (criterion 2) because it is the&nbsp;
only place where Orcuttia tenuis occurrences occupy Northern Volcanic&nbsp;
Ashflow vernal pools (Keeler-Wolf et al. 1998; CNDDB 2002). This area&nbsp;
is geographically important (criterion 1) because it represents the&nbsp;
western extent of the range of Orcuttia tenuis, and some of the last&nbsp;
remaining vernal pool habitats in Lake County. The unit is over 84 mi&nbsp;
(135 km) from the nearest units to the north and west.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The majority of lands within this unit are privately owned. TNC has&nbsp;
protected the area around Bogg's Lake south of Clear Lake, but most of&nbsp;
the area is not protected. Property ownership and protection within&nbsp;
this unit includes CDFG (13 ac (5 ha)) and TNC (192 ac (77 ha)) lands.&nbsp;
This unit consists of two subunits that are both located south of Clear&nbsp;
Lake. The southernmost subunit includes Little High Valley.

Tuctoria mucronata

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Solano grass is found in two naturally occurring scattered vernal&nbsp;
pool complex areas in Solano and Yolo counties in the Sacramento&nbsp;
Valley. The specific vernal pool characteristics that determine the&nbsp;
suitability for Solano grass germination and growth are unknown;&nbsp;
however, it appears that the species seems to favor somewhat larger and&nbsp;
deeper vernal pools as compared to other vernal pool plants.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Solano grass occurrences are known from with an elevational&nbsp;
variation of near 5 m (15 ft) to near 11 m (35 ft). Conserving the&nbsp;
distribution of Solano grass across its geographical and elevational&nbsp;
distribution protects the natural environmental processes for the&nbsp;
species and provides the best chance for retaining the species across&nbsp;
the full extent of the species range. The vernal pool types and soils&nbsp;
associated with the two areas of concentration of Solano grass differ&nbsp;
across the geographic range of the species and leads to different&nbsp;
species compositions and environmental conditions between Solano grass&nbsp;
occurrences. Providing for a mosaic of habitat types both between and&nbsp;
among vernal pool species occurrences is essential to the species&nbsp;
conservation because it would include the full extent of the physical&nbsp;
and environmental conditions for the species (Fugate 1992, Fugate 1998,&nbsp;
Gonzales et al.1996, Ikeda and Schlising 1990, Noss et al. 2002a,&nbsp;
Platenkamp 1998, Zedler et al. 1979). The distribution of Solano grass&nbsp;
reflects a diversity of vernal pool habitat types and sizes that&nbsp;
provide habitat for the species. Vernal pool complexes that provide&nbsp;
suitable habitat for this species include similar physiographic and&nbsp;
edaphic settings-claypan soils of saline-alkali flood basin rims basins&nbsp;
soils. The parent material of vernal pools greatly influences species&nbsp;
composition and hydrologic functioning of the vernal pool (Hanes and&nbsp;
Stromberg 1998, Holland and Jain 1981, 1988). Soils beneath vernal&nbsp;
pools are extremely variable and are not the same as soils mapped by&nbsp;
soil surveys, but are usually undescribed hydric inclusions that vary&nbsp;
upon location (Holland and Dain 1990). The primary constituent elements&nbsp;
of critical habitat for Tuctoria mucronata are the habitat components&nbsp;
that provide:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) Vernal pools, swales, and other ephemeral wetlands and&nbsp;
depressions of appropriate sizes and depths and the

[[Page 46744]]

adjacent upland margins of these depressions that sustain Tuctoria&nbsp;
mucronata germination, growth and reproduction, including but not&nbsp;
limited to, Northern Claypan vernal pools (Sawyer and Keeler-Wolf 1995)&nbsp;
on saline-alkaline clay or silty clay in the Pescadero soil series that&nbsp;
typically become inundated during winter rains, but are dry during the&nbsp;
summer and do not necessarily fill with water every year; and
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) The associated watershed(s) and hydrologic features, including&nbsp;
the pool basin, swales, and surrounding uplands (which may vary in&nbsp;
extent depending on pool size and depth, soil type and depth, hardpan&nbsp;
or claypan type and extent, topography, and climate) that contribute to&nbsp;
the filling and drying of the vernal pool or ephemeral wetland, and&nbsp;
that maintain suitable periods of pool inundation, water quality, and&nbsp;
soil moisture for Tuctoria mucronata germination, growth and&nbsp;
reproduction, and dispersal, but not necessarily every year.

Unit 1, Davis Communications Annex and Grasslands Area Unit, Yolo&nbsp;
County (440 ac (178 ha))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit is an important representative of the geographic&nbsp;
distribution of the species (criterion 1) because it represents the&nbsp;
northern extent of the species' range, and because it is one of only&nbsp;
two areas where Tuctoria mucronata is known to occur (CNDDB 2002). It&nbsp;
also includes the largest remaining T. mucronata occurrence (CNDDB&nbsp;
2002). Tuctoria mucronata within the unit grows in Northern Claypan&nbsp;
vernal pools on Pescadero soils (CNDDB 2002).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit is located southeast of the City of Davis and south of&nbsp;
the South Fork of Putah Creek. Its western boundary lies along the&nbsp;
border between Solano and Yolo Counties. The unit contains land owned&nbsp;
by Yolo County and by the DOD (310 (125 ha)).

Effects of Critical Habitat Designation

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The regulatory effects of a critical habitat designation under the&nbsp;
Act are triggered through the provisions of section 7, which applies&nbsp;
only to activities conducted, authorized, or funded by a Federal agency&nbsp;
(Federal actions). Regulations implementing this interagency&nbsp;
cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part 402.&nbsp;
Individuals, organizations, States, local governments, and other non-
Federal entities are not affected by the designation of critical&nbsp;
habitat unless their actions occur on Federal lands, require Federal&nbsp;
authorization, or involve Federal funding.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 7(a)(2) of the Act requires Federal agencies, including us,&nbsp;
to insure that their actions are not likely to jeopardize the continued&nbsp;
existence of a listed species or result in the destruction or adverse&nbsp;
modification of designated critical habitat. This requirement is met&nbsp;
through section 7 consultation under the Act. Our regulations define&nbsp;
``jeopardize the continued existence'' as to engage in an action that&nbsp;
reasonably would be expected, directly or indirectly, to reduce&nbsp;
appreciably the likelihood of both the survival and recovery of a&nbsp;
listed species in the wild by reducing the reproduction, numbers, or&nbsp;
distribution of that species (50 CFR 402.02). ``Destruction or adverse&nbsp;
modification of designated critical habitat'' is defined as a direct or&nbsp;
indirect alteration that appreciably diminishes the value of the&nbsp;
critical habitat for both the survival and recovery of the species (50&nbsp;
CFR 402.02). Such alterations include, but are not limited to, adverse&nbsp;
changes to the physical or biological features, i.e., the primary&nbsp;
constituent elements, that were the basis for determining the habitat&nbsp;
to be critical. However, in a March 15, 2001, decision of the United&nbsp;
States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (Sierra Club v. U.S. Fish&nbsp;
and Wildlife Service et al., 245 F.3d 434), the Court found our&nbsp;
definition of destruction or adverse modification to be invalid. In&nbsp;
response to this decision, we are reviewing the regulatory definition&nbsp;
of adverse modification in relation to the conservation of the species.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 7(a)(4) requires Federal agencies to confer with us on any&nbsp;
action that is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a&nbsp;
proposed species or result in destruction or adverse modification of&nbsp;
proposed critical habitat. Conference reports provide conservation&nbsp;
recommendations to assist the agency in eliminating conflicts that may&nbsp;
be caused by the proposed action. The conservation recommendations in a&nbsp;
conference report are advisory.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We may issue a formal conference report, if requested by the&nbsp;
Federal action agency. Formal conference reports include an opinion&nbsp;
that is prepared according to 50 CFR 402.14, as if critical habitat&nbsp;
were designated. We may adopt the formal conference report as the&nbsp;
biological opinion when critical habitat is designated, if no&nbsp;
substantial new information or changes in the action alter the content&nbsp;
of the opinion (see 50 CFR 402.10(d)).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a species is listed or critical habitat is designated, section&nbsp;
7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to ensure that activities they&nbsp;
authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the&nbsp;
continued existence of such a species or to destroy or adversely modify&nbsp;
its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect a listed species&nbsp;
or its critical habitat, the responsible Federal agency (action agency)&nbsp;
must enter into consultation with us. Through this consultation, the&nbsp;
action agency would ensure that the permitted actions do not destroy or&nbsp;
adversely modify critical habitat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we issue a biological opinion concluding that a project is&nbsp;
likely to result in the destruction or adverse modification of critical&nbsp;
habitat, we would also provide reasonable and prudent alternatives to&nbsp;
the project, if any are identifiable. Reasonable and prudent&nbsp;
alternatives are defined at 50 CFR 402.02 as alternative actions&nbsp;
identified during consultation that can be implemented in a manner&nbsp;
consistent with the intended purpose of the action, that are consistent&nbsp;
with the scope of the Federal agency's legal authority and&nbsp;
jurisdiction, that are economically and technologically feasible, and&nbsp;
that the Service's Regional Director believes would avoid the&nbsp;
destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat. Reasonable and&nbsp;
prudent alternatives can vary from slight project modifications to&nbsp;
extensive redesign or relocation of the project. Costs associated with&nbsp;
implementing a reasonable and prudent alternative are similarly&nbsp;
variable.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regulations at 50 CFR 402.16 require Federal agencies to reinitiate&nbsp;
consultation on previously reviewed actions in instances where critical&nbsp;
habitat is subsequently designated and the Federal agency has retained&nbsp;
discretionary involvement or control over the action or such&nbsp;
discretionary involvement or control is authorized by law.&nbsp;
Consequently, some Federal agencies may request reinitiation of&nbsp;
consultation or conference with us on actions for which formal&nbsp;
consultation has been completed, if those actions may affect designated&nbsp;
critical habitat or adversely modify or destroy proposed critical&nbsp;
habitat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Federal activities that may affect vernal pool crustaceans or&nbsp;
vernal pool plants or their critical habitat will require consultation&nbsp;
under section 7. Activities on private, State, county, or lands under&nbsp;
local jurisdictions requiring a permit from a Federal agency, such as&nbsp;
Federal Highway Administration or Federal Emergency Management Act&nbsp;
funding, or a permit from the Corps under section 404 of the Clean&nbsp;
Water Act, will continue to be subject to the section 7 consultation&nbsp;
process. Federal actions not affecting listed species or critical&nbsp;
habitat, and actions on non-Federal lands that are not federally

[[Page 46745]]

funded, authorized, or permitted do not require section 7 consultation.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 4(b)(8) of the Act requires us to evaluate briefly and&nbsp;
describe, in any proposed or final regulation that designates critical&nbsp;
habitat, those activities involving a Federal action that may adversely&nbsp;
modify such habitat or that may be affected by such designation. We&nbsp;
note that such activities may also jeopardize the continued existence&nbsp;
of the species.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Activities that, when carried out, funded, or authorized by a&nbsp;
Federal agency may directly or indirectly destroy or adversely modify&nbsp;
critical habitat for vernal pool crustaceans or vernal pool plants&nbsp;
include, but are not limited to:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) Activities regulated by the Corps, EPA, or NRCS under the Clean&nbsp;
Water Act and other acts or regulations, including but not limited to,&nbsp;
discharge of fill into waters of the U.S., and promulgation of water&nbsp;
quality standards;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) Construction and maintenance of roads, highways, and rights-of&nbsp;
way by Caltrans which may modify vernal pool habitat or affect their&nbsp;
hydrologic functions;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) Sale or exchange of lands by a Federal agency to a non-Federal&nbsp;
entity;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4) Construction, relicensing, and operation of dams or other water&nbsp;
impoundments by the BOR, Corps, or Federal Energy Regulatory Commission&nbsp;
(FERC);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5) Airport construction, improvement, or maintenance activities&nbsp;
funded or authorized by the Federal Aviation Administration;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (6) Licensing of construction of communication sites by the Federal&nbsp;
Communications Commission;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (7) Funding of construction or development activities by the U.S.&nbsp;
Department of Housing and Urban Development;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (8) Military training and maneuvers on DoD lands;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (9) Execution of water service by the BOR;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (10) Promulgation and implementation of a land use plan by a&nbsp;
Federal agency such as the BLM, USFS, or DoD that may alter management&nbsp;
practices for critical habitat; and
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (11) Approval of pesticide labels by EPA.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have questions regarding whether specific activities may&nbsp;
constitute adverse modification of critical habitat in California,&nbsp;
contact the Field Supervisor, Sacramento Fish and Wildlife Office (see&nbsp;
ADDRESSES section). If the critical habitat occurs in Oregon, contact&nbsp;
the Field Supervisor, Oregon Fish and Wildlife Office, 2600 SE. 98th&nbsp;
Avenue, Portland, OR 97266. Requests for copies of the regulations on&nbsp;
listed plants and wildlife, and inquiries about prohibitions and&nbsp;
permits may be addressed to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Branch&nbsp;

Exclusions Under Section 4(b)(2) of the Act

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 4(b)(2) of the Act requires us to designate critical&nbsp;
habitat on the basis of the best scientific and commercial information&nbsp;
available, and to consider the economic and other relevant impacts of&nbsp;
designating a particular area as critical habitat. We may exclude areas&nbsp;
from critical habitat upon a determination that the benefits of&nbsp;
exclusions outweigh the benefits of specifying such areas as critical&nbsp;
habitat. We cannot exclude areas from critical habitat when the&nbsp;
exclusion will result in the extinction of the species concerned.

Economic Exclusions

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the basis of the final economic analysis and other relevant&nbsp;
impacts, as outlined under section 4(b)(2) of the Act, and the economic&nbsp;
effects associated with this rule, certain exclusions have been made to&nbsp;
this final designation, as detailed below. Because of the settlement&nbsp;
agreement that requires us to deliver this rule to the Federal Register&nbsp;
by July 15, 2003, there was insufficient time to revise the rule to&nbsp;
fully reflect these exclusions. A technical amendment to the rule to&nbsp;
take these areas out of the maps and legal descriptions, as well to&nbsp;
change all the appropriate references in the text of this preamble will&nbsp;
be completed as soon as funding allows.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following counties are excluded from this rule under Section&nbsp;
4(b)(2): Butte, Madera, Merced, Solano, and Sacramento. We find that&nbsp;
the benefits of excluding these areas from critical habitat outweigh&nbsp;
the benefits of including them.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 4(b)(2) of the Act requires us to designate critical&nbsp;
habitat on the basis of the best scientific information available, and&nbsp;
to consider the economic and other relevant impacts of designating a&nbsp;
particular area as critical habitat. We may exclude areas from critical&nbsp;
habitat upon a determination that the benefits of such exclusions&nbsp;
outweigh the benefits of specifying such areas as critical habitat. We&nbsp;
cannot exclude such areas from critical habitat when such exclusion&nbsp;
will result in the extinction of the species concerned. Following the&nbsp;
publication of the proposed critical habitat designation, we prepared a&nbsp;
draft economic analysis of the proposed rulemaking to estimate the&nbsp;
potential economic effect of the proposed designation. The draft&nbsp;
analysis was made available for review on November 21, 2002 (67 FR&nbsp;
70201). We accepted public comment on the draft analysis until December&nbsp;
23, 2002. On March 14, 2003, we reopened the public comment period and&nbsp;
accepted comments on the proposed rule and DEA until March 28, 2003 (68&nbsp;
FR 12336). On the basis of public comment, we prepared a final economic&nbsp;
analysis of the proposed designation that was used in the development&nbsp;
of this final rule.

(1) Benefits of Excluding

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In our final analysis, we found that future section 7 consultations&nbsp;
resulting from the listing of the 15 vernal pool species and the&nbsp;
critical habitat designation could potentially impose total economic&nbsp;
costs for consultation and modifications to projects of $1.3 billion&nbsp;
over 20 years or $115 million per year.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of the costs arise from our assumptions about land value and&nbsp;
consumer surplus losses. Some of the costs result from the loss in land&nbsp;
value of land that may need to be set aside on project sites under&nbsp;
section 7 requirements. Other costs are from the unavailability of&nbsp;
developable land in certain areas. For most regions, the scale and&nbsp;
significance of the additional project modifications associated with&nbsp;
section 7 and critical habitat designations are not sufficient to&nbsp;
affect regional real estate market dynamics. In other words, although&nbsp;
some land may not be developed as a result of critical habitat, plenty&nbsp;
of substitute land is available. In these geographic areas, the overall&nbsp;
number of new housing units built over the next 20 years is not&nbsp;
expected to change as a result of the designation. The cost burden of&nbsp;
project modifications falls on regulated landowners. However, in more&nbsp;
land-constrained counties the setting-aside of vernal pool habitat may&nbsp;
result in a reduction in the number of new homes that are built.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For each of the excluded counties these costs were high. Costs in&nbsp;
Butte County $64 million, Madera County $24 million, Merced County $91&nbsp;
million, Solano County $321 million, and Sacramento County $682&nbsp;
million. We believe that these costs are disproportionately high when&nbsp;
compared to the costs of section 7 impacts elsewhere in this and other&nbsp;
designations. In addition, we have considered the following factors.:


[[Page 46746]]


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Butte County: The County's unemployment rate is 7 percent, the&nbsp;
designation affects 6.6 percent of the county's land, and the annual&nbsp;
costs represent 0.157 percent of the total annual taxable sales in&nbsp;
the county.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madera County: The County's unemployment rate is 11.8 percent,&nbsp;
the designation affects 8.2 percent of the county's land, and the&nbsp;
annual cost represents 0.139 percent of the annual taxable sales in&nbsp;
the county.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Merced County: The County's unemployment rate is 14.4 percent,&nbsp;
the designation affects 27.4 percent of the county's land, and the&nbsp;
annual cost represents 0.263 percent of the annual taxable sales in&nbsp;
the county.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sacramento County: The designation affects 17.12 percent of the&nbsp;
county's land, and the annual cost represents 0.206 percent of the&nbsp;
annual taxable sales in the county.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Solano County: The designation affects 18.1 percent of the&nbsp;
county's land, and the annual cost represents 0.362 percent of the&nbsp;
annual taxable sales in the county.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The combination of monetary costs as a percent of the actual&nbsp;
economic activity in the area, existing unemployment rate, and area of&nbsp;
land affected in the county represents a more specific picture of the&nbsp;
potential economic damage that would flow from this particular&nbsp;
designation.

(2) Benefits of Including

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The benefits of including this areas within critical habitat are&nbsp;
that these areas contribute to the conservation of the species. In&nbsp;
developing our proposal of critical habitat for the 15 vernal pool&nbsp;
species, we identified those areas that, based on the scientific and&nbsp;
commercial data available, we determined contain essential occurrences&nbsp;
of each of the species and/or are defined by the physical and&nbsp;
biological features essential to their conservation. We used a number&nbsp;
of criteria in defining critical habitat including, but not limited to,&nbsp;
the known species occurrence and distribution data, habitat types,&nbsp;
degree of habitat fragmentation, soil and landform relationships,&nbsp;
connectivity and dispersal factors, and conservation biology&nbsp;
principles.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Solano County contains essential habitat for six of the listed&nbsp;
vernal pool species: Contra Costa goldfields, Solano grass, Colusa&nbsp;
grass, Conservancy fairy shrimp, vernal pool tadpole shrimp, and vernal&nbsp;
pool fairy shrimp. We believe that critical habitat provides&nbsp;
conservation value for all of these species because it emphasizes the&nbsp;
importance of the interrelationship of uplands and pools within vernal&nbsp;
pool complexes. The uplands support physical and biological features&nbsp;
that are essential to the conservation of all of these species.&nbsp;
Exclusion of critical habitat in Solano County may be perceived as&nbsp;
diminishing the added value of highlighting the essential functions of&nbsp;
uplands that is provided by critical habitat designation.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, since the protections of Sections 7, with respect to the&nbsp;
jeopardy standard and section 9 will still be in effect, and will&nbsp;
result in actions that will protect the species, the loss in protection&nbsp;
of the species will be minimal.

(3) The Benefits of Exclusion Outweigh the Benefits of Inclusion

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on the above considerations, and in accordance with section&nbsp;
4(b)(2) of the Act, we have determined that the benefits of exclusion&nbsp;
outweigh the benefits of inclusion. The economic analysis found&nbsp;
unusually high economic costs. Given the fact that much of the existing&nbsp;
protections for the species will continue, the benefits of exclusion&nbsp;
outweigh the benefits of inclusion. We find that since the protections&nbsp;
of Sections 7, with respect to the jeopardy standard and section 9 will&nbsp;
still be in effect, and will result in actions that will protect the&nbsp;
species, the loss in protection of the species will be minimal.&nbsp;
Therefore we do not believe that these exclusions will result in the&nbsp;
extinction of the species.

Relationship of Critical Habitat to Approved Habitat Conservation Plans

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As described above, section 4(b)(2) of the Act requires us to&nbsp;
consider other relevant impacts, in addition to economic impacts, of&nbsp;
designating critical habitat. Section 10(a)(1)(B) of the Act authorizes&nbsp;
us to issue permits for the take of listed wildlife species incidental&nbsp;
to otherwise lawful activities. An incidental take permit application&nbsp;
must be supported by an HCP that identifies conservation measures that&nbsp;
the permittee agrees to implement for the species to minimize and&nbsp;
mitigate the impacts of the permitted incidental take. Although take of&nbsp;
listed plants is not generally prohibited by the Act on private land,&nbsp;
listed plant species may also be covered in an HCP for wildlife&nbsp;
species.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three proposed critical habitat units (Skunk Hollow Unit 35, a&nbsp;
portion of San Joaquin Unit 18 for vernal pool fairy shrimp) warrant&nbsp;
exclusion from the final designation of critical habitat under section&nbsp;
4(b)(2) of the Act based on the special management considerations and&nbsp;
protections afforded the vernal pool habitat through several approved&nbsp;
and legally operative HCPs or NCCP/HCPs. We believe that in most&nbsp;
instances, the benefits of excluding legally operative HCPs from the&nbsp;
critical habitat designations will outweigh the benefits of including&nbsp;
them. The following represents our rationale for excluding the Skunk&nbsp;
Hollow critical habitat unit (Unit 35), a portion of the San Joaquin&nbsp;
critical habitat unit (Unit 18 for vernal pool fairy shrimp, and Unit&nbsp;
14 for vernal pool tadpole shrimp) from the final designated critical&nbsp;
habitat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Skunk Hollow vernal pool basin (Unit 35) consists of a single,&nbsp;
large vernal pool and its essential associated watershed in western&nbsp;
Riverside County. Several federally listed species have been documented&nbsp;
from the Skunk Hollow vernal pool basin. These include the vernal pool&nbsp;
fairy shrimp (Simovich, in litt. 2001), the Riverside fairy shrimp&nbsp;
(Service 2001), Navarretia fossalis, and Orcuttia californica (Service&nbsp;
1998). The vernal pool complex and watershed is currently protected as&nbsp;
part of a reserve established within an approved wetland mitigation&nbsp;
bank in the Rancho Bella Vista HCP area, and as part of the&nbsp;
conservation measures contained in the Assessment District 161&nbsp;
Subregional HCP (AD161 HCP).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The San Joaquin County Multi-Species Conservation Plan (SJMSCP)&nbsp;
identifies the vernal pool fairy shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole&nbsp;
shrimp as covered species. The SJMSCP has identified areas where growth&nbsp;
and development are expected to occur (build-out areas). A portion of&nbsp;
one of these build-out areas overlaps with the San Joaquin Unit 18 for&nbsp;
vernal pool fairy shrimp.

(1) Benefits of Inclusion

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The benefits of including HCPs or NCCP/HCPs in critical habitat are&nbsp;
normally small. The principal benefit of any designated critical&nbsp;
habitat is that federally funded or authorized activities in such&nbsp;
habitat that may affect it require consultation under section 7 of the&nbsp;
Act. Such consultation would ensure that adequate protection is&nbsp;
provided to avoid adverse modification of critical habitat. Where HCPs&nbsp;
are in place, our experience indicates that this benefit is small or&nbsp;
non-existent. Currently approved and permitted HCPs and NCCP/HCPs are&nbsp;
already designed to ensure the long-term survival of covered species&nbsp;
within the plan area. Where we have an approved HCPs or NCCP/HCPs,&nbsp;
lands that we ordinarily would define as critical habitat for covered&nbsp;
species will normally be protected in reserves and other conservation&nbsp;
lands by the terms of the HCPs or NCCP/HCPs and their Implementing&nbsp;
Agreements (IAs). These HCPs or NCCP/HCPs and IAs include management&nbsp;
measures and protections for conservation lands designed to protect,&nbsp;
restore, and enhance their value as habitat for covered species.

[[Page 46747]]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another possible benefit to including these lands is that the&nbsp;
designation of critical habitat can serve to educate landowners and the&nbsp;
public regarding the potential conservation value of an area. This may&nbsp;
focus and contribute to conservation efforts by other parties by&nbsp;
clearly delineating areas of high conservation value for certain&nbsp;
species. Any information about the vernal pool species for which&nbsp;
critical habitat was proposed in units 35 and 14, and a portion of unit&nbsp;
18 that reaches a wide audience, including other parties engaged in&nbsp;
conservation activities, would be considered valuable.

(2) Benefits of Exclusion

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The benefits of excluding HCPs or NCCP/HCPs include relieving&nbsp;
landowners, communities and counties of any additional regulatory&nbsp;
burden that might be imposed by critical habitat. This benefit is&nbsp;
particularly compelling because we have made the determination that&nbsp;
once a HCP of NCCP/HCP is negotiated and approved by us after public&nbsp;
comment, activities consistent with the plan will satisfy the&nbsp;
requirements of the Act. Many HCPs or NCCP/HCPs, particularly large&nbsp;
regional HCPs or NCCP/HCPs, take many years to develop and, upon&nbsp;
completion, become regional conservation plans that are consistent with&nbsp;
the conservation of covered species. Imposing an additional regulatory&nbsp;
review after HCP or NCCP/HCP completion may jeopardize conservation&nbsp;
efforts and partnerships in many areas, and could be viewed as a&nbsp;
disincentive to those developing HCPs or NCCP/HCPs. Excluding HCPs or&nbsp;
NCCP/HCPs provides us an opportunity to streamline regulatory&nbsp;
compliance, and provides regulatory certainty for HCP and NCCP/HCP&nbsp;
participants.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another crucial benefit of excluding HCPs or NCCP/HCPs is that it&nbsp;
would encourage the continued development of partnerships with HCP or&nbsp;
NCCP/HCPs participants, including states, local governments,&nbsp;
conservation organizations, and private landowners, that together can&nbsp;
implement conservation actions we would be unable to accomplish. By&nbsp;
excluding areas covered by HCPs or NCCP/HCPs from critical habitat&nbsp;
designation, we clearly maintain our commitments, preserve these&nbsp;
partnerships, and, we believe, set the stage for more effective&nbsp;
conservation actions in the future.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, an HCP or NCCP/HCP application must itself be&nbsp;
consulted upon. While this consultation will not look specifically at&nbsp;
the issue of adverse modification of critical habitat, unless critical&nbsp;
habitat has already been designated within the proposed plan area, it&nbsp;
will look at the very similar concept of jeopardy to the listed species&nbsp;
in the plan area. Because HCPs or NCCP/HCPs, particularly large&nbsp;
regional HCPs or NCCP/HCPs, address land use within the plan&nbsp;
boundaries, habitat issues within the plan boundaries will have been&nbsp;
thoroughly addressed in the HCP or NCCP/HCP and consulted upon. Federal&nbsp;
actions in areas occupied by listed species would still require&nbsp;
consultation under section 7 of the Act.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, HCPs and NCCP/HCPs typically provide for greater&nbsp;
conservation benefits to a covered species than section 7 consultations&nbsp;
because HCPs and NCCP/HCPs assure the long-term protection and&nbsp;
management of a covered species and its habitat, and funding for such&nbsp;
management through the standards found in the 5 Point Policy for HCPs&nbsp;
(64 FR 35242) and the HCP No Surprises regulation (63 FR 8859). Such&nbsp;
assurances are typically not provided by section 7 consultations which,&nbsp;
in contrast to HCPs, often do not commit the project proponent to long-
term special management or protections. Thus, a consultation typically&nbsp;
does not accord the lands it covers the extensive benefits a HCP or&nbsp;
NCCP/HCP provides. The development and implementation of HCPs or NCCP/
HCPs provide other important conservation benefits, including the&nbsp;
development of biological information to guide conservation efforts and&nbsp;
assist in species conservation, and the creation of innovative&nbsp;
solutions to conserve species while allowing for development.

(3) The Benefits of Exclusion Outweigh the Benefits of Inclusion

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have reviewed and evaluated HCPs and NCCP/HCPs currently&nbsp;
approved and have been implemented within the areas being designated as&nbsp;
critical habitat for the vernal pool crustaceans and plants. Based on&nbsp;
this evaluation, we find that the benefits of exclusion outweigh the&nbsp;
benefits of designating the Skunk Hollow area (Unit 35 for vernal pool&nbsp;
fairy shrimp), and a portion of the San Joaquin area (Unit 18 for&nbsp;
vernal pool fairy shrimp and Unit 14 for vernal pool tadpole shrimp as&nbsp;
critical habitat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While neither HCP or NCCP/HCP includes vernal pool fairy shrimp as&nbsp;
a covered species, both HCPs provide protection for the vernal pool&nbsp;
complex and its associated watershed in perpetuity. Further, the Rancho&nbsp;
Bell Vista HCP addresses the endangered Riverside fairy shrimp as a&nbsp;
covered species. The management and protections afforded the vernal&nbsp;
pool and Riverside fairy shrimp provide for the long-term conservation&nbsp;
of this pool and vernal pool fairy shrimp. It also preserves the&nbsp;
partnerships that we have developed with the local jurisdiction and&nbsp;
project proponents in the development of the HCP and NCCP/HCP. We also&nbsp;
believe that the management and protections afforded the vernal pool&nbsp;
fairy shrimp and vernal pool tadpole shrimp in the build-out areas&nbsp;
through the SJMSCP are adequate for the long-term conservation of these&nbsp;
species.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The education benefits of critical habitat, including informing the&nbsp;
public of areas that are important for long-term survival and&nbsp;
conservation of the species, are essentially the same as those that&nbsp;
would occur from the public notice and comment procedures required to&nbsp;
establish a HCP or NCCP/HCP, as well as the public participation that&nbsp;
occurs in the development of many regional HCPs or NCCP/HCPs. For these&nbsp;
reasons, then, we believe, that designation of critical habitat has&nbsp;
little benefit in areas covered by HCPs, provided that the HCP or NCCP/
HCP and its associated IA are legally operative, and that the HCP or&nbsp;
NCCP/HCP specifically and adequately covers the species for which&nbsp;
critical habitat is being designated. We do not believe that this&nbsp;
exclusion would result in the extinction of these vernal pool species.

Relationship of Critical Habitat to the Draft Western Riverside&nbsp;
Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan (MSHCP)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Draft Western Riverside MSHCP has been in development for&nbsp;
several years. Participants in this HCP include 14 cities, the County&nbsp;
of Riverside, including the County Flood Control and Water Conservation&nbsp;
District, County Waste Department; the California Department of&nbsp;
Transportation, and the California Department of Parks and Recreation.&nbsp;
The Western Riverside MSHCP is also proposed as a subregional plan&nbsp;
under the State's NCCP and is being developed in cooperation with CDFG.&nbsp;
Within the 1.26 million-acre (510,000 ha) planning area of the MSHCP,&nbsp;
approximately 153,000 ac (62,000 ha) of diverse habitats are proposed&nbsp;
for conservation. The proposed conservation of 153,000 ac (62,000 ha)&nbsp;
will compliment other, existing natural and open space areas that are&nbsp;
already conserved through other means (e.g., State Parks, USFS, and&nbsp;
County Park lands).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The County of Riverside and the participating jurisdictions have&nbsp;
signaled their sustained support for the Western Riverside MSHCP as&nbsp;
evidenced by the November 5, 2002, passage of a local

[[Page 46748]]

bond measure to fund the acquisition of land in support of the MSHCP.&nbsp;
On November 14, 2002, a Notice of Availability of a Draft Environmental&nbsp;
Impact Report (EIS/EIR) and Receipt of an Application for an Incidental&nbsp;
Take Permit was published in the Federal Register. Public comment on&nbsp;
these documents was accepted until January 14, 2003. Additionally, on&nbsp;
June 17, 2003, the County of Riverside Board of Supervisors voted&nbsp;
unanimously to support the completion of the Western Riverside MSHCP.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unit 33 (Hemet-San Jacinto Area) contains the PCEs essential to the&nbsp;
conservation of the vernal pool fairy shrimp. This Unit also lies&nbsp;
within the boundaries of the planning area for the proposed Western&nbsp;
Riverside MSHCP. The proposed MSHCP indicates that conservation actions&nbsp;
within this area will be implemented such that the long-term&nbsp;
conservation of the vernal pool fairy shrimp will be addressed.&nbsp;
Although the MSHCP is not yet completed and implemented, significant&nbsp;
progress has been achieved in the development of this HCP, including&nbsp;
the preparation of an EIS/EIR, the solicitation of public review and&nbsp;
comment, and the initiation of a consultation with us on the issuance&nbsp;
of incidental take permits for those species identified for coverage&nbsp;
within the draft plan.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In light of the progress made to date on the development of the&nbsp;
proposed Western Riverside MSHCP and the anticipated future&nbsp;
implementation of this HCP, we have excluded Unit 33 from designated&nbsp;
critical habitat pursuant to section 4(b)(2) of the Act. Our rationale&nbsp;
for excluding these lands from designated critical habitat is outline&nbsp;
below.

(1) Benefits of Inclusion

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As stated previously, the benefits of designating critical habitat&nbsp;
on lands within the boundaries of approved HCPs are normally small.&nbsp;
Where HCPs are in place that include coverage for the vernal pool fairy&nbsp;
shrimp or co-occurring vernal pool species, our experience has shown&nbsp;
that the HCPs and their IAs include management measures and protections&nbsp;
designed to protect, restore, monitor, manage, and enhance the habitat&nbsp;
to benefit the conservation of the species. The principal benefit of&nbsp;
designating critical habitat is that federally authorized or funded&nbsp;
activities that may affect a species' critical habitat would require&nbsp;
consultation with us under section 7 of the Act. In the case of the&nbsp;
proposed Western Riverside MSHCP, we must evaluate the impact of the&nbsp;
plan on the species for which the participants are seeking incidental&nbsp;
take permits, pursuant to section 7 of the Act.

(2) Benefits of Exclusion

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Excluding lands defined by Unit 33 from designated critical habitat&nbsp;
will provide several benefits, as follows: (1) Exclusion of the lands&nbsp;
from the final designation will enhance our ability to continue working&nbsp;
with the participants in a spirit of cooperation and partnership; (2)&nbsp;
other jurisdictions, private landowners, and other entities will likely&nbsp;
continue to see the benefit of working cooperatively with us to develop&nbsp;
HCPs which can provide the basis for future opportunities to conserve&nbsp;
species and their habitats. A more detailed discussion concerning our&nbsp;
rationale for the benefits of excluding HCPs from critical habitat is&nbsp;
outlined under in the previous discussion concerning the exclusion of&nbsp;
approved HCPs. Further, we believe that the analysis conducted&nbsp;
evaluating the benefits of excluding HCPs from critical habitat versus&nbsp;
the benefits of including these lands, as previously discussed for the&nbsp;
exclusion of approved HCPs, is applicable and appropriate for the&nbsp;
exclusion of the Western Riverside MSHCP from designated critical&nbsp;
habitat.

Relationship of Critical Habitat to Santa Rosa Plateau Ecological&nbsp;
Reserve: A State, Federal, and Local Cooperatively Managed Reserve

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Santa Rosa Plateau Ecological Reserve (SRPER) (Unit 34 for&nbsp;
vernal pool fairy shrimp) covers approximately 8,300 ac (3360 ha) near&nbsp;
the town of Murrieta, California. The SRPER is situated on a large mesa&nbsp;
composed of basaltic and granitic substrates and contains one of the&nbsp;
largest vernal pool complexes remaining in southern Riverside County.&nbsp;
Several endemic vernal species are known to occur within the complex&nbsp;
including the vernal pool fairy shrimp, Riverside fairy shrimp, Santa&nbsp;
Rosa fairy shrimp (Linderiella santarosae), Orcuttia californica,&nbsp;
Brodiaea filifolia (Thread-leaved brodiaea), and Eryngium aristulatum&nbsp;
var. parishii (San Diego button-celery). Established in 1984, the SRPER&nbsp;
is owned by The Nature Conservancy (TNC), and is cooperatively managed&nbsp;
by TNC, the Riverside County Regional Park and Open Space District,&nbsp;
CDFG, and the Service.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The draft Western Riverside Multiple Species Habitat Conservation&nbsp;
Plan (MSHCP) identifies the SRPER as an existing natural area that will&nbsp;
compliment the MSHCP's future establishment of 153,000 ac (62,000 ha)&nbsp;
of additional conservation lands.

(1) Benefits of Inclusion

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is minimal benefit from designating critical habitat for the&nbsp;
vernal pool fairy shrimp within the SRPER because these lands are&nbsp;
already jointly managed for the conservation of wildlife. One possible&nbsp;
benefit of including these lands as critical habitat would be to&nbsp;
educate the public regarding the conservation value of SRPER and the&nbsp;
vernal pool complex. Additionally, the designation of critical habitat&nbsp;
for the vernal pool fairy shrimp on SRPER would require consultation&nbsp;
with us for any action undertaken, authorized, or funded by a Federal&nbsp;
agency that may affect the species or its designated critical habitat.

(2) Benefits of Exclusion

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, the SRPER provides for regular public education programs&nbsp;
highlighting the unique ecological features of the area, including the&nbsp;
vernal pool complex and the species found therein. Designation of&nbsp;
critical habitat will not have any appreciable effect on the&nbsp;
development or implementation of public education programs within the&nbsp;
SRPER. Human activities that would negatively affect the vernal pool&nbsp;
fairy shrimp and the PCEs that support it are prohibited on SRPER.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Recovery Plan for Vernal Pools of Southern California (Recovery&nbsp;
Plan) (Service 1998) identifies the vernal pool complex on the SRPER in&nbsp;
the Riverside Management Area. The Recovery Plan was developed with&nbsp;
assistance from numerous entities and individuals, including the CDFG&nbsp;
and Metropolitan Water District. Because the SRPER is cooperatively&nbsp;
managed by local, state, and Federal agencies, including the Service,&nbsp;
CDFG, TNC, the Riverside County Regional Park and Open Space District,&nbsp;
and the Metropolitan Water District, proposed activities that could&nbsp;
affect the vernal pool fairy shrimp would be reviewed by all the&nbsp;
cooperating management entities.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Service, as one of the cooperating management agencies for the&nbsp;
SRPER, ensures that actions it would authorize on the SRPER will not&nbsp;
jeopardize the continued existence of the vernal pool fairy shrimp. It&nbsp;
is highly unlikely that a proposed activity that would jeopardize the&nbsp;
existence of the species would not also adversely modify the habitat&nbsp;
essential for the conservation of the vernal pool fairy shrimp.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TNC is anticipating transferring ownership of SRPER to CDFG. The&nbsp;
CDFG has already indicated its intent to oversee the SRPER in a manner

[[Page 46749]]

consistent with the present conservation management scheme agreed to by&nbsp;
the cooperating agencies. Designation of critical habitat on the SRPER&nbsp;
could be interpreted by CDFG as an unfair burden. Although designation&nbsp;
of critical habitat would not have any effect of the present management&nbsp;
of the vernal pool complex on the SRPER, the CDFG would likely view&nbsp;
such designation as unnecessary.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Excluding critical habitat designation from the SRPER will preserve&nbsp;
the cooperative spirit already established among the managing agencies,&nbsp;
including the CDFG. Such exclusion will not jeopardize the existence of&nbsp;
the vernal pool fairy shrimp on SRPER, nor will such exclusion provide&nbsp;
increase the likelihood that activities would be proposed which would&nbsp;
appreciably diminish the value of the habitat for the conservation of&nbsp;
the species.

Relationship of Critical Habitat to National Wildlife Refuge and&nbsp;
National Fish Hatchery Lands

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have determined that proposed critical habitat units on the&nbsp;
Sacramento, San Francisco Bay, San Luis, and Kern National Wildlife&nbsp;
Refuge Complexes, and the Coleman National Fish Hatchery Complex,&nbsp;
warrant exclusion pursuant to section 4(b)(2) of the Act because the&nbsp;
benefits of excluding these lands from final critical habitat outweigh&nbsp;
the benefits of their inclusion.

(1) Benefits of Inclusion

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is minimal benefit from designating critical habitat for the&nbsp;
vernal pool species within National Wildlife Refuge and National Fish&nbsp;
Hatchery lands because these lands are already managed for the&nbsp;
conservation of wildlife. One possible benefit of including these lands&nbsp;
as critical habitat would be to educate the public regarding the&nbsp;
conservation value of these areas and the vernal pool complex they&nbsp;
support. However, critical habitat designation provides little gain in&nbsp;
the way of increased recognition for special habitat values on lands&nbsp;
that are expressly managed to protect and enhance those values.&nbsp;
Additionally, the designation of critical habitat will not have any&nbsp;
appreciable effect on the development or implementation of public&nbsp;
education programs on these areas.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Critical habitat designation provides little gain in the way of&nbsp;
increased recognition for special habitat values on lands that are&nbsp;
expressly managed to protect and enhance those values. All of these&nbsp;
refuges are developing comprehensive resource management plans that&nbsp;
will provide for protection and management of all trust resources,&nbsp;
including federally listed species and sensitive natural habitats.&nbsp;
These plans, and many of the management actions undertaken to implement&nbsp;
them, will have to undergo consultation under section 7 of the Act and&nbsp;
be evaluated for their consistency with the conservation needs of&nbsp;
listed species.

(2) Benefits of Exclusion

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the consultation requirement associated with critical habitat&nbsp;
on the National Wildlife Refuge and Fish Hatchery lands add little&nbsp;
benefit, it would require the use of resources to ensure regulatory&nbsp;
compliance that could otherwise be used for on-the ground management of&nbsp;
the targeted listed or sensitive species. Therefore, the benefits of&nbsp;
exclusion include relieving additional regulatory burden that might be&nbsp;
imposed by the critical habitat, which could divert resources from&nbsp;
substantive resource protection to procedural regulatory efforts.

(3) The Benefits of Exclusion Outweigh the Benefits of Inclusion

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We believe that the potential disincentives to actively manage&nbsp;
trust resources that is provided by designation of critical habitat are&nbsp;
appreciably greater than the benefits to be derived from such&nbsp;
designation. This is a result of the fact that these lands already are&nbsp;
publically-owned and managed to protect and enhance unique and&nbsp;
important natural resource values. We therefore conclude that the&nbsp;
benefits of excluding National Wildlife Refuge and National Fish&nbsp;
Hatchery lands from the final critical habitat designation outweigh the&nbsp;
benefits of including them. Exclusion of these lands will not increase&nbsp;
the likelihood that management activities would be proposed which would&nbsp;
appreciably diminish the value of the habitat for conservation of the&nbsp;
species. Further, such exclusion will not result in the extinction of&nbsp;
the vernal pool species. We therefore conclude that the benefits of&nbsp;
excluding refuge and Fish Hatchery lands from the final critical&nbsp;
habitat designation outweigh the benefits of including them.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In accordance with section 4(b)(2) of the Act, we have excluded&nbsp;
lands within the Sacramento, San Francisco Bay, San Luis, and Kern&nbsp;
National Wildlife Refuge Complexes, and the Coleman National Fish&nbsp;
Hatchery Complex from final critical habitat. The total amount of&nbsp;
refuge and fishery land excluded from the final designation is&nbsp;
approximately 33,097 ac (13,238 ha).

Relationship of Critical Habitat to State Managed Ecological Reserves&nbsp;
and Wildlife Areas

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The State of California establishes ecological reserves ``to&nbsp;
protect threatened or endangered native plants, wildlife, or aquatic&nbsp;
organisms or specialized habitat types, both terrestrial and nonmarine&nbsp;
aquatic, or large heterogeneous natural gene pools'' (Fish and Game&nbsp;
Code section 1580). They are to ``be preserved in a natural condition,&nbsp;
or which are to be provided some level of protection as determined by&nbsp;
the commission, for the benefit of the general public to observe native&nbsp;
flora and fauna and for scientific study or research.'' (Fish and Game&nbsp;
Code section 1584). Wildlife areas are for the purposes of propagating,&nbsp;
feeding and protecting birds, mammals, and fish (Fish and Game Code&nbsp;
section 1525); However, they too provide habitat for and are also&nbsp;
managed for the benefit of listed and sensitive species (CDFG in litt.&nbsp;
2003).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take of species except as authorized by State Fish and Game Code is&nbsp;
prohibited on both State ecological reserves and wildlife areas&nbsp;
(section 1530 and section 1583). While public uses are permitted on&nbsp;
most wildlife areas and ecological reserves, such uses are only allowed&nbsp;
at times and in areas where listed and sensitive species are not&nbsp;
adversely affected (CDFG in litt. 2003). The management objectives for&nbsp;
these State lands include: ``to specifically manage for targeted listed&nbsp;
and sensitive species to provide protection that is equivalent to that&nbsp;
provided by designation of critical habitat; to provide a net benefit&nbsp;
to the species through protection and management of the land; to ensure&nbsp;
adequate information, resources, and funds are available to properly&nbsp;
manage the habitat; and to establish conservation objectives, adaptive&nbsp;
management, monitoring and reporting processes to assure an effective&nbsp;
management program, monitoring and reporting processes to assure an&nbsp;
effective management program'' (CDFG in litt. 2003).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We proposed as critical habitat, but have now considered for&nbsp;
exclusion from the final designation, the CDFG owned lands within the&nbsp;
Battle Creek, Big Sandy, Grizzly Island, Hill Slough, North Grasslands,&nbsp;
and Oroville Wildlife Areas and State-owned lands within Allensworth,&nbsp;
Boggs Lake, Butte Creek Canyon, Calhoun Cut, Carrizo Plains, Dales&nbsp;
Lake, Fagan Marsh, Phoenix Field, San Joaquin River, Stone Corral, and&nbsp;
Thomes Creek Ecological Reserves.

[[Page 46750]]

(1) Benefits of Inclusion

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is minimal benefit from designating critical habitat for the&nbsp;
vernal pool species within the ecological reserves and wildlife&nbsp;
management areas because these lands are already managed for the&nbsp;
conservation of wildlife. One possible benefit of including these lands&nbsp;
as critical habitat would be to educate the public regarding the&nbsp;
conservation value of these areas and the vernal pool complex they&nbsp;
support. However, critical habitat designation provides little gain in&nbsp;
the way of increased recognition for special habitat values on lands&nbsp;
that are expressly managed to protect and enhance those values.&nbsp;
Additionally, the designation of critical habitat will not have any&nbsp;
appreciable effect on the development or implementation of public&nbsp;
education programs on these areas.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The designation of critical habitat would require consultation with&nbsp;
us for any action undertaken, authorized, or funded by a Federal agency&nbsp;
that may affect the species or its designated critical habitat.&nbsp;
However, the management objects for State ecological reserves and&nbsp;
wildlife management area already include specifically managing for&nbsp;
targeted listed and sensitive species (CDFG in litt. 2003); therefore,&nbsp;
the benefit from additional consultation is likely also to be minimal.

(2) Benefits of Exclusion

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the consultation requirement associated with critical habitat&nbsp;
on the Ecological Reserves and Wildlife Management Areas add little&nbsp;
benefit, it would require the use of resources to ensure regulatory&nbsp;
compliance that could otherwise be used for on-the ground management of&nbsp;
the targeted listed or sensitive species (CDFG in litt. 2003).&nbsp;
Additionally, the State has expressed a concern that the designation of&nbsp;
these lands and associated regulatory requirements may cause delays&nbsp;
that could be expected to reduce the CDFG's ability to respond to&nbsp;
vernal pool management issues that arise on the ecological reserves and&nbsp;
wildlife areas. Therefore, the benefits of exclusion include relieving&nbsp;
additional regulatory burden that might be imposed by the critical&nbsp;
habitat, which could divert resources from substantive resource&nbsp;
protection to procedural regulatory efforts.

(3) The Benefits of Exclusion Outweigh the Benefits of Inclusion

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We believe that the potential disincentives to actively manage&nbsp;
State trust resources that is provided by designation of critical&nbsp;
habitat are appreciably greater than the benefits to be derived from&nbsp;
such designation. This is a result of the fact that these lands already&nbsp;
are publically-owned and managed to protect and enhance unique and&nbsp;
important natural resource values. We therefore conclude that the&nbsp;
benefits of excluding CDFG ecological reserves and wildlife areas from&nbsp;
the final critical habitat designation outweigh the benefits of&nbsp;
including them. Such exclusion will not result in the extinction of the&nbsp;
vernal pool species. Further, we do believe that such exclusion will&nbsp;
increase the likelihood that activities would be proposed that would&nbsp;
appreciably diminish the value of the habitat for the conservation of&nbsp;
these species.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In accordance with section 4(b)(2) of the Act, we have excluded&nbsp;
California Department of Fish and Game owned lands within the Battle&nbsp;
Creek, Big Sandy, Grizzly Island, Hill Slough, North Grasslands, and&nbsp;
Oroville Wildlife Areas and State-owned lands within Allensworth, Boggs&nbsp;
Lake, Butte Creek Canyon, Calhoun Cut, Carrizo Plains, Dales Lake,&nbsp;
Fagan Marsh, Phoenix Field, San Joaquin River, Stone Corral, and Thomes&nbsp;
Creek Ecological Reserves. The total amount of land excluded for State-
owned lands excluded within wildlife areas or ecological reserves is&nbsp;
approximately 20,933 ac (8,373 ha).

Relationship of Critical Habitat to Military Lands

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 4(b)(2) of the Act requires us to base critical habitat&nbsp;
designations on the best scientific and commercial data available,&nbsp;
after taking into consideration the economic and any other relevant&nbsp;
impact of specifying any particular area as critical habitat. It also&nbsp;
requires us to gather information regarding the designation of critical&nbsp;
habitat and the effects thereof from all relevant sources, including&nbsp;
the Unites States Air Force and the United States Army. The following&nbsp;
discussions are provided on Travis AFB, Beale AFB, Camp Roberts, and&nbsp;
Fort Hunter Liggett.

Travis Air Force Base

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Travis AFB has several vernal pool complexes that support the&nbsp;
vernal pool fairy shrimp and Lasthenia conjugens and also contain PCEs&nbsp;
for Neostapfia colusana, Conservancy fairy shrimp, Tuctoria mucronata,&nbsp;
and vernal pool tadpole shrimp. As a result of wetland surveys, Travis&nbsp;
AFB had identified 235 vernal pools on approximately 40 ha (100 ac) of&nbsp;
the 445 ha (1,100 ac) that are not developed on the base. To date, only&nbsp;
Lasthenia conjugens and the vernal fairy shrimp have been discovered on&nbsp;
Travis AFB within these 40 ha (100 ac).

(1) Benefits of Inclusion

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The benefits of designating critical habitat on Travis AFB are&nbsp;
small because the vernal pool complexes on the base are already the&nbsp;
focus of vernal pool conservation activities on the base; existing&nbsp;
controls on base development already preserve habitat for listed&nbsp;
species located there. Travis AFB has completed development of an INRMP&nbsp;
to outline protection and management strategies for natural resources&nbsp;
on the base, including vernal pool species and habitats. In addition,&nbsp;
Travis AFB has provided private researchers and the general public&nbsp;
opportunities for scientific and educational benefits, and controls&nbsp;
access to the vernal pool complexes to avoid causing inadvertent harm&nbsp;
to the species.

(2) Benefits of Exclusion

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Designating critical habitat on Travis AFB would significantly&nbsp;
impact their ability to: (1) Fulfill present and future mission systems&nbsp;
and taskings supporting national defense; (2) adversely impact routine&nbsp;
operations and maintenance activities; (3) hinder improvements with the&nbsp;
base water supply; (4) hinder the time line for construction and&nbsp;
increase the costs associated with the proposed 350-room visitor's&nbsp;
quarters; (5) conflict with the management of the air space to support&nbsp;
airfield safety; (6) impair the ability to protect military aircrew,&nbsp;
aircraft, and public safety; (7) impede essential training; and (8)&nbsp;
limit their ability to prevent or reduce aircraft bird strikes (Travis&nbsp;
AFB, in litt. 2002). Additionally, designation of critical habitat&nbsp;
would adversely impact civilian contracting in Solano County. Travis&nbsp;
AFB is Solano County's largest employer and local contracting totaled&nbsp;
$75 million dollars in fiscal year 2002. Also, the designation of&nbsp;
critical habitat will increase costs associated with environmental&nbsp;
documentation of proposed projects, may restrict future critical&nbsp;
training missions to jeopardize the bases's viability and operational&nbsp;
capabilities, impact future associated economic benefits to the&nbsp;
surrounding communities, and may affect future base closing decisions&nbsp;
(Travis AFB in litt. 2002).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The main benefits of exclusion are ensuring that the mission&nbsp;
execution and military training activities can continue without&nbsp;
interruption at Travis AFB while the Habitat Conservation Management&nbsp;
Plan (HCMP) for the base is being implemented. Additionally, future&nbsp;
mission assignments to Travis

[[Page 46751]]

AFB will not be precluded based upon vernal pool critical habitat&nbsp;
designation (Travis AFB, in litt. 2002).

(3) The Benefits of Exclusion Outweigh the Benefits of Inclusion

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on the above considerations, and consistent with the&nbsp;
direction provided in section 4(b)(2) of the Act, we have determined&nbsp;
that the benefits of excluding Travis AFB as critical habitat outweigh&nbsp;
the benefits of including it as critical habitat for vernal pool&nbsp;
species. Further, we have determined that excluding the Travis AFB will&nbsp;
not result in the extinction of the Conservancy fairy shrimp, the&nbsp;
vernal pool fairy shrimp, the vernal pool tadpole shrimp, N. colusana,&nbsp;
T. mucronata, and L. conjugens. If significant additional information&nbsp;
become available that changes our analysis of the benefits of excluding&nbsp;
compared to the benefits of including Travis AFB in the critical&nbsp;
habitat designation, we may revise this final designation accordingly.

Beale Air Force Base

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beale AFB completed their INRMP in 1999. Within their INRMP, Beale&nbsp;
AFB established a Vernal Pool Conservation and Management Area to&nbsp;
protect vernal pool complexes on the western side of the base. In&nbsp;
cooperation with Beale AFB, we agreed not to sign the INRMP and are&nbsp;
awaiting the draft Habitat Conservation and Management Plan (HCMP) so&nbsp;
that we can consult on both documents. Beale AFB has several&nbsp;
substantial vernal pool complexes that support the vernal pool fairy&nbsp;
shrimp and vernal pool tadpole shrimp, especially on the western side&nbsp;
of the base.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Beale AFB HCMP may be completed in 2004 depending on funding.&nbsp;
We will consult with Beale AFB under section 7 of the Act on the&nbsp;
development and implementation of the INRMP, HCMP and base&nbsp;
comprehensive plan.

(1) Benefits of Inclusion

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The benefits of designating critical habitat on Beale AFB are small&nbsp;
because the vernal pool complexes on the western side of the base are&nbsp;
already the focus of vernal pool conservation activities on the base.&nbsp;
Beale AFB is completing the development of their HCMP to outline&nbsp;
protection and management strategies for natural resources on the base,&nbsp;
including vernal pool species and habitats. In addition, Beale AFB has&nbsp;
provided private researchers and the general public opportunities for&nbsp;
scientific and educational benefits, and controls access to the vernal&nbsp;
pool complexes to avoid causing inadvertent harm to the species.

(2) Benefits of Exclusion

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Designating critical habitat on Beale AFB would significantly&nbsp;
impact their ability to: (1) Fulfill present and future mission systems&nbsp;
and taskings supporting national defense; (2) adversely impact routine&nbsp;
operations and maintenance activities; (3) hinder improvements with the&nbsp;
base water supply; (4) hinder the time line for construction and&nbsp;
increase the costs associated with the proposed 350-room visitor's&nbsp;
quarters; (5) conflict with the management of the air space to support&nbsp;
airfield safety; (6) impair the ability to protect military aircrew,&nbsp;
aircraft, and public safety; (7) impede essential training; and (8)&nbsp;
limit their ability to prevent or reduce aircraft bird strikes (Beale&nbsp;
AFB, in litt. 2002). Additionally, the economic costs to Beale AFB and&nbsp;
the economy of Yuba County could be considerable as the designation of&nbsp;
critical habitat may restrict enough future critical training missions&nbsp;
to jeopardize the bases's viability and operational capabilities,&nbsp;
impacting future associated economic benefits to the surrounding&nbsp;
communities, and may affect future base closing decisions (Beale AFB,&nbsp;
in litt. 2002).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The main benefit of exclusion would be ensuring that the military&nbsp;
training activities can continue without interruption at Beale AFB&nbsp;
while the HCMP is being completed. Additionally, future mission&nbsp;
assignments to Beale AFB will not be precluded from the decision making&nbsp;
process based upon vernal pool critical habitat designation (Beale AFB,&nbsp;
in litt. 2002).

(3) The Benefits of Exclusion Outweigh the Benefits of Inclusion

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on the above considerations, and consistent with the&nbsp;
direction provided in section 4(b)(2) of the Act, we have determined&nbsp;
that the benefits of excluding Beale AFB as critical habitat outweigh&nbsp;
the benefits of including it as critical habitat for vernal pool&nbsp;
species. Further, we have determined that excluding the Beale AFB will&nbsp;
not result in the extinction of the Conservancy fairy shrimp, the&nbsp;
vernal pool fairy shrimp, the vernal pool tadpole shrimp, N. colusana,&nbsp;
T. mucronata, and L. conjugens. If significant additional information&nbsp;
become available that changes our analysis of the benefits of excluding&nbsp;
compared to the benefits of including Beale AFB in the critical habitat&nbsp;
designation, we may revise this final designation accordingly.

Fort Hunter Liggett and Camp Roberts

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fort Hunter Liggett (6,519 ha (16,298 ac)) and Camp Roberts (13,247&nbsp;
ha (33,117 ac)) occur in San Luis Obispo and Monterey Counties. We are&nbsp;
reviewing but have not approved INRMPs for Camp Roberts and Fort Hunter&nbsp;
Liggett. Both bases have several substantial vernal pool complexes that&nbsp;
support the vernal pool fairy shrimp.

(1) Benefits of Inclusion

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Analysis of remote sensing data collected since 1994 suggests the&nbsp;
loss of vernal pools in the coastal county area of California is&nbsp;
occurring at a steady, and possibly increasing, rate. These trends are&nbsp;
based on a recent vernal pool mapping report for Monterey, San Benito,&nbsp;
San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, and Ventura Counties (Holland 2003). It&nbsp;
is also likely that the species that depend on these habitats are also&nbsp;
being adversely affected to an increasing degree.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We do not believe, at the present time, that the management plans&nbsp;
on either base demonstrate how they will help recover vernal pool fairy&nbsp;
shrimp. Additionally, the current plans do not provide an assurance of&nbsp;
implementation, or demonstrate that proposed conservation efforts will&nbsp;
be effective in promoting conservation.

(2) Benefits of Exclusion

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At Camp Roberts, activities potentially affected include the use of&nbsp;
field artillery pieces, range training, drop zone use, and use of tank&nbsp;
trails or roads. Military operations in training areas with listed&nbsp;
fairy shrimp at Fort Hunter Liggett would also be modified. One of&nbsp;
these training areas contains a multi-purpose range complex that only&nbsp;
occurs at four military bases in the country (FHL 2002b). Consistent&nbsp;
access to the facility is critical because comparable facilities at&nbsp;
other locations are scheduled for use several months to years in&nbsp;
advance. Initiating and completing section 7 consultations that would&nbsp;
arise from a critical habitat designation would likely result in&nbsp;
alterations to, and delays in, training schedules at the multi-purpose&nbsp;
range complex. If critical habitat is designated on these bases, the&nbsp;
military would need to consider and possibly implement alternatives&nbsp;
that modify the timing, location, and intensity of training activities.&nbsp;
The main benefit of these 4(b)(2) exclusions is to ensure that mission-
critical military training activities can continue without interruption&nbsp;
while we continue to work with military staff to jointly refine and

[[Page 46752]]

complete the INRMPs for the two military bases.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, the maintenance of positive working relationships between our&nbsp;
agency and the military is essential to completing the INRMPs for Camp&nbsp;
Roberts and Fort Hunter Liggett. The number of listed species and the&nbsp;
diversity of training operations on these military bases will&nbsp;
ultimately result in two inherently complicated documents. Crafting&nbsp;
conservation strategies for multiple species that require different&nbsp;
habitats, while ensuring the lands on the military bases are still&nbsp;
available for training purposes, requires that working relationships&nbsp;
between the different agencies are optimized. We expect that when the&nbsp;
INRMPs are completed and adopted in the upcoming months, they will&nbsp;
provide equal or greater protection to vernal pool fairy shrimp habitat&nbsp;
than a critical habitat designation.

(3) The Benefits of Exclusion Outweigh the Benefits of Inclusion

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on the above considerations, and consistent with the&nbsp;
direction provided in section 4(b)(2) of the Act, we have determined&nbsp;
that the benefits of excluding Fort Hunter Liggett and Camp Roberts as&nbsp;
critical habitat for vernal pool fairy shrimp (unit 29) outweigh the&nbsp;
benefits of including it as critical habitat for vernal pool species.&nbsp;
We base this determination on the need for maintaining mission-critical&nbsp;
military training activities (ARNG 2002a; Fort Hunter Liggett 2002a),&nbsp;
the need to maintain positive working relationships that are necessary&nbsp;
to complete plans designed to conserve vernal pool fairy shrimp and its&nbsp;
habitat, and economic considerations relating to section 7 consultation&nbsp;
costs and other indirect effects (EPS 2002).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, we have determined that excluding these two bases will not&nbsp;
result in the extinction of the vernal pool fairy shrimp. If&nbsp;
significant additional information become available that changes our&nbsp;
analysis of the benefits of excluding compared to the benefits of&nbsp;
including either of these two bases in the critical habitat&nbsp;
designation, we may revise this final designation accordingly.

Relationship of Critical Habitat to Tribal Lands

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 4(b)(2) of the Act requires us to gather information&nbsp;
regarding the designation of critical habitat and the effects thereof&nbsp;
from all relevant sources, including Indian Pueblos and Tribes. In&nbsp;
accordance with Secretarial Order 3206, ``American Indian Tribal&nbsp;
Rights, Federal-Tribal Trust Responsibilities, and the Endangered&nbsp;
Species Act'' (June 5, 1997); the President's memorandum of April 29,&nbsp;
1994, ``Government-to-Government Relations with Native American Tribal&nbsp;
Governments,'' and Executive Order 13175, we recognize the need to&nbsp;
consult with federally recognized Indian Tribes on a Government-to-
Government basis. In the Secretarial Order 3206, it is stated that,&nbsp;
``American Indian Tribal Rights, Federal-Tribal Trust Responsibilities,&nbsp;
and the Endangered Species Act'' (1997) provides that critical habitat&nbsp;
should not be designated in an area that may impact Tribal trust&nbsp;
resources unless it is determined to be essential to conserve a listed&nbsp;
species.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the public comment period, the Mechoopda Indian Tribe of&nbsp;
Chico Rancheria, California sent us a letter requesting to have 260 ha&nbsp;
(645 ac) of their trust lands excluded from critical habitat&nbsp;
designation for the vernal pool tadpole shrimp (unit 4). The Mechoopda&nbsp;
Tribe want to work on a government-to-government basis. They believe&nbsp;
that the designation of critical habitat on their land will impede&nbsp;
their ability to beneficially manage it, and will interfere with their&nbsp;
sovereign governmental interests. The letter also stated that they&nbsp;
intend to independently manage the environmental resources on their&nbsp;
lands in a manner that protects these resources while preserving their&nbsp;
cultural values and heritage.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Along with their letter, the Tribe sent us a copy of the Mechoopda&nbsp;
Indian Tribe Environmental Management Plan. We reviewed the plan, and&nbsp;
although it afforded some protection to listed species, we found that&nbsp;
it did not meet our conservation goals. In response to the Tribe's&nbsp;
request to be excluded from critical habitat, we solicited additional&nbsp;
information from the Tribe and requested a meeting. During this&nbsp;
meeting, we communicated our desired conservation goals and objectives,&nbsp;
and provided technical advice for the modification of the management&nbsp;
plan to enhance its benefits for the conservation of listed species. We&nbsp;
established an effective working relationship and the technical&nbsp;
assistance that we provided enabled them to develop voluntary measures&nbsp;
to better conserve vernal pool species and their habitat on Tribal&nbsp;
lands. These voluntary measures are contained within a letter and&nbsp;
revised Mechoopda Indian Tribe Environmental Management Plan dated&nbsp;
March 2003, which the Tribal chairman submitted during the second open&nbsp;
comment period.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their revised management plan demonstrates the Tribe's willingness&nbsp;
to work cooperatively with us toward landscape-scale conservation&nbsp;
efforts that will benefit vernal pool species. The Tribe's revised&nbsp;
management plan includes early consultation for activities with us to&nbsp;
determine the potential for effects to listed species, coordination&nbsp;
with us to follow methods and protocols to survey for listed vernal&nbsp;
pool species, and appropriate actions to conserve listed species based&nbsp;
on the results of the surveys. The revised management plan also&nbsp;
specifically provides periodic updates as appropriate. We have&nbsp;
determined that the plan provides sufficient conservation benefit to&nbsp;
the species and assurances that the conservation management strategies&nbsp;
will be implemented and effective. In short, their revised management&nbsp;
plan allows the Tribe to exercise their sovereign status and provide&nbsp;
for special management protections and conservation of the vernal pool&nbsp;
habitat.

(1) Benefits of Inclusion

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Few additional benefits are provided by including the Mechoopda&nbsp;
Indian Tribe lands in this critical habitat designation beyond what&nbsp;
will be achieved through the implementation of their revised management&nbsp;
plan. Although surveys for listed vernal pool species have not been&nbsp;
conducted on their property, occurrences of listed vernal pool species&nbsp;
are known on adjacent lands. This increases the likelihood that listed&nbsp;
species also occupy the Mechoopda's land because the habitat is&nbsp;
similar, and in some parts, contiguous with the Tribal lands.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another possible benefit to including these lands is that the&nbsp;
designation of critical habitat can serve to educate landowners and the&nbsp;
public regarding the potential conservation value of an area. This may&nbsp;
focus and contribute to conservation efforts by other parties by&nbsp;
clearly delineating areas of high conservation value for certain&nbsp;
species. Any information about the vernal pool species for which&nbsp;
critical habitat was proposed on Mechoopda Tribeland that reaches a&nbsp;
wide audience, including other parties engaged in conservation&nbsp;
activities, would be considered valuable.

(2) Benefits of Exclusion

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We believe that exclusion of Mechoopda Tribal lands from critical&nbsp;
habitat would have substantial benefits including: (1) The furtherance&nbsp;
of our Federal Trust obligations and our deference to the Mechoopda&nbsp;
Tribe to develop and implement Tribal conservation and natural resource&nbsp;
management plans for their land; (2) the establishment and maintenance&nbsp;
of effective working relationships to promote the conservation of&nbsp;
vernal pool species while streamlining the

[[Page 46753]]

consultation process; (3) the allowance for meaningful collaboration&nbsp;
and cooperation in scientific studies to learn more about the life&nbsp;
history and habitat requirements of species that may occur on their&nbsp;
land; and (4) providing conservation benefits to the vernal pool&nbsp;
ecosystem and vernal pool species that depend on it, that might not&nbsp;
otherwise occur.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Mechoopda Tribe has committed to greater conservation measures&nbsp;
on their lands than would be available through the designation of&nbsp;
critical habitat. As described in the Mechoopda's revised management&nbsp;
plan, our working relationship with the Mechoopda Tribe will result in&nbsp;
the implementation of beneficial natural resource programs, including&nbsp;
species preservation. The Mechoopda Tribe has demonstrated their&nbsp;
commitment to ensuring the long-term viability of federally listed&nbsp;
species on Tribal lands by implementing conservation measures that will&nbsp;
contribute to their recovery. Exclusion from critical habitat will&nbsp;
contribute to an improved partnership with the Mechoopda Tribe, the&nbsp;
incentive of avoiding the perceived additional regulatory requirements,&nbsp;
and opportunities to streamline regulatory compliance.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If listed vernal pool species are found on the Tribe's land, the&nbsp;
Mechoopda consult with us for any project that may adversely affect&nbsp;
listed species under section 7(a)(2), regardless of whether critical&nbsp;
habitat is designated or not. Thus, we find little additional benefit&nbsp;
through section 7 consultation for critical habitat. Furthermore, the&nbsp;
Mechoopda Tribe has been under the Environmental Protection Agency's&nbsp;
(EPA's) General Assistance Program. The Mechoopda Tribe has adopted an&nbsp;
Environmental Policy Act that is intended to establish and maintain the&nbsp;
highest attainable standards of environmental quality within any and&nbsp;
all land held in trust for the benefit of the Tribe. In addition to the&nbsp;
Mechoopda Tribe's environmental protection ordinances, activities on&nbsp;
Tribal lands are subject to the provisions the Clean Water Act.&nbsp;
Projects proposed on Tribal lands subject to Federal funding or&nbsp;
approval will also be subject to compliance with NEPA.

(3) The Benefits of Exclusion Outweigh the Benefits of Inclusion

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on the above considerations, and consistent with the&nbsp;
direction provided in section 4(b)(2) of the Act, we have determined&nbsp;
that the benefits of excluding Mechoopda Tribal land as critical&nbsp;
habitat outweigh the benefits of including it as critical habitat for&nbsp;
the vernal pool tadpole shrimp (unit 4).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In summary, the benefits of including the Tribe's land are limited&nbsp;
to minor educational benefits. The benefits of excluding these areas&nbsp;
from being designated as critical habitat are more significant, and&nbsp;
include encouraging the continued development and implementation of&nbsp;
special management measures. The Mechoopda Tribal lands has their own&nbsp;
environmental organization, the Mechoopda EPA, which is responsible for&nbsp;
the management of the Tribe's natural resources, and which recognizes&nbsp;
the importance of implementing conservation measures that will&nbsp;
contribute to the conservation of federally-listed species on their&nbsp;
lands. The Mechoopda Tribe have already demonstrated their willingness&nbsp;
to work with us to address the habitat needs of listed species that may&nbsp;
occur on their lands. The exclusion of critical habitat for the&nbsp;
Mechoopda trust lands is consistent with our published policies on&nbsp;
Native American natural resource management by allowing the Mechoopda&nbsp;
Tribe to manage their own natural resources.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, we have determined that excluding these lands will not&nbsp;
result in the extinction of the vernal pool tadpole shrimp. If&nbsp;
significant additional information become available that changes our&nbsp;
analysis of the benefits of excluding compared to the benefits of&nbsp;
including Mechoopda Tribal land in the critical habitat designation, we&nbsp;
may revise this final designation accordingly.

Exclusion Summary

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have reviewed the overall effect of the exclusion of the above&nbsp;
mentioned approved and draft HCPs, the Santa Rosa Plateau Ecological&nbsp;
Reserve, State managed lands, National Wildlife Refuge lands, National&nbsp;
Fish hatchery lands, Tribal trust lands, military installations, and&nbsp;
Butte, Madera, Merced, Solano, and Sacramento Counties, California on&nbsp;
the vernal pool species and their designated critical habitat and have&nbsp;
determined that the benefits of excluding these areas outweighs the&nbsp;
benefits of including them in this critical habitat designation. The&nbsp;
lands removed from critical habitat as a result of these exclusions&nbsp;
will not jeopardize the long-term survival and conservation of the&nbsp;
species or lead to their extinction.

Economic Analysis

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our draft and final analyses evaluated the potential future effects&nbsp;
associated with the section 7 consultation requirements for the 15&nbsp;
vernal pool species that may occur coextensively with this designation,&nbsp;
as well as the subset of effects associated solely with the critical&nbsp;
habitat designation. To quantify the economic impacts that are&nbsp;
coextensive with the critical habitat designation, the analysis&nbsp;
evaluated a ``without section 7'' scenario and compared it to a ``with&nbsp;
section 7'' scenario. The ``without section 7'' baseline represented&nbsp;
the level of protection currently afforded the species under the Act if&nbsp;
section 7 protective measures were absent, and includes protections&nbsp;
afforded by other Federal, State, and local laws such as the CEQA. The&nbsp;
``with section 7'' scenario identifies land-use activities likely to&nbsp;
involve a Federal nexus that may affect the species or its designated&nbsp;
critical habitat, and that therefore have the potential to be subject&nbsp;
to future consultations under section 7 of the Act.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon identifying section 7 impacts, the analysis considers the&nbsp;
subset of impacts that can be attributed exclusively to the critical&nbsp;
habitat designation. The subset of section 7 impacts likely to be&nbsp;
affected solely by the designation of critical habitat represents a&nbsp;
lower-bound estimate of potential impact. The categories of potential&nbsp;
costs and benefits considered in the analysis includes costs associated&nbsp;
with: (1) Conducting section 7 consultations associated with the&nbsp;
listing or with the critical habitat; (2) modifications to project,&nbsp;
activities, or land uses resulting from the section 7 consultations;&nbsp;
(3) uncertainty and public perceptions resulting from the designation&nbsp;
of critical habitat; (4) surplus effects associated with changes in the&nbsp;
housing market, and (5) potential offsetting benefits associated with&nbsp;
critical habitat including educational benefits. There may also be&nbsp;
indirect economic effects associated with the designation of critical&nbsp;
habitat. Indirect effects are impacts associated with actions that do&nbsp;
not have a Federal nexus or otherwise are not subject to the provisions&nbsp;
of section 7 under the Act. Examples of indirect effects that are&nbsp;
considered in the economic analysis include impacts associated with&nbsp;
creation of Habitat Conservation Plans, impacts under other State and&nbsp;
local laws, and impacts associated with timing delays and regulatory&nbsp;
uncertainty.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In our final analysis, we found that total costs that may be&nbsp;
attributable to future section 7 consultations resulting from the&nbsp;
listing of the 15 vernal pool species and the critical habitat&nbsp;
designation could be about $1.3 billion over the next 20 years, or&nbsp;
about $115 million annually. The costs attributable

[[Page 46754]]

solely to the designation of critical habitat are a result of expected&nbsp;
project modifications and a reduction in the net number of new housing&nbsp;
associated with real estate development. Several counties have been&nbsp;
excluded from this rule because of the high economic impacts found by&nbsp;
our economic analysis.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following counties are excluded from this rule under Section&nbsp;
4(b)(2): Butte, Madera, Merced, Solano, and Sacramento. The exclusion&nbsp;
of these counties substantially reduces the economic effect of this&nbsp;

rule.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A copy of the final economic analysis and supporting documents are&nbsp;
included in our supporting record for this rulemaking and may be&nbsp;
obtained by contacting the Sacramento Fish and Wildlife Office (see&nbsp;
ADDRESSES section). Copies of the final economic analysis also are&nbsp;
available on the Internet at <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/leaving.cgi?from=leavingFR.html&amp;log=linklog&amp;to=http://pacific.fws.gov/news/">http://pacific.fws.gov/news/</a>.

Required Determinations

Regulatory Planning and Review

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In accordance with Executive Order 12866, this document is a&nbsp;
significant rule and was reviewed by the Office of Management and&nbsp;
Budget (OMB). Our detailed assessment of the economic effects of the&nbsp;
proposed designation are described in the Final Economic Analysis of&nbsp;
Critical Habitat Designation for Vernal Pool Species. This analysis&nbsp;
indicates that the total costs that may be attributable to future&nbsp;
section 7 consultations resulting from the listing of the 15 vernal&nbsp;
pool species and the critical habitat designation could be about $1.3&nbsp;
billion over the next 20 years, or about $115 million annually. It is&nbsp;
important to note the estimated economic includes impacts to areas&nbsp;
ultimately excluded from the final designation and therefore likely&nbsp;
over estimates the potential economic impact of the final designation.&nbsp;
Several counties have been excluded from this rule because of the high&nbsp;
economic impacts found by our economic analysis. The following counties&nbsp;
are excluded from this rule under section 4(b)(2): Butte, Madera,&nbsp;
Merced, Solano, and Sacramento. The exclusion of these counties&nbsp;
substantially reduces the economic effect of this rule.

Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (as amended by the Small&nbsp;
Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA) of 1996),&nbsp;
whenever a Federal agency is required to publish a notice of rulemaking&nbsp;
for any proposed or final rule, it must prepare and make available for&nbsp;
public comment a regulatory flexibility analysis that describes the&nbsp;
effect of the rule on small entities, i.e., small businesses, small&nbsp;
organizations, and small governmental jurisdictions. However, no&nbsp;
regulatory flexibility analysis is required if the head of the agency&nbsp;
certifies that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on&nbsp;
a substantial number of small entities. SBREFA amended the RFA to&nbsp;
require Federal agencies to provide a statement of the factual basis&nbsp;
for certifying that a rule will not have a significant economic impact&nbsp;
on a substantial number of small entities.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on the information in our economic analysis (DEA and&nbsp;
Addendum), we are certifying that the critical habitat designation for&nbsp;
the 15 vernal pools species will not have a significant effect on a&nbsp;
substantial number of small entities because a substantial number of&nbsp;
small entities are not affected by the designation. Several counties&nbsp;
have been excluded from this rule because of the high economic impacts&nbsp;
found by our economic analysis. The following counties are excluded&nbsp;
from this rule under Section 4(b)(2): Butte, Madera, Merced, Solano,&nbsp;
and Sacramento. The exclusion of these counties substantially reduces&nbsp;
the economic effect of this rule.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Small entities include small organizations, such as independent&nbsp;
nonprofit organizations, and small governmental jurisdictions,&nbsp;
including school boards and city and town governments that serve fewer&nbsp;
than 50,000 residents, as well as small businesses. The RFA/SBREFA&nbsp;
requires that agencies use the Small Business Administration's&nbsp;
definition of ``small business'' that has been codified at 13 CFR&nbsp;
121.201. Small businesses include manufacturing and mining concerns&nbsp;
with fewer than 500 employees, wholesale trade entities with fewer than&nbsp;
100 employees, retail and service businesses with less than $5 million&nbsp;
in annual sales, general and heavy construction businesses with less&nbsp;
than $27.5 million in annual business, special trade contractors doing&nbsp;
less than $11.5 million in annual business, and agricultural businesses&nbsp;
with annual sales less than $750,000. The RFA/SBREFA defines ``small&nbsp;
governmental jurisdiction'' as the government of a city, county, town,&nbsp;
school district, or special district with a population of less than&nbsp;
50,000. Our analysis showed that only two percent of the small land&nbsp;
developers affected by section 7 are expected to experience effects&nbsp;
that on average would constitute three percent of its gross annual&nbsp;
revenue. The effects to small businesses associated solely with the&nbsp;
designation, which would occur only in the San Francisco Bay Area,&nbsp;
would be less given the findings in the analysis that showed these&nbsp;
effects constituted about one-half of the estimated coextensive costs.&nbsp;
Although certain State agencies may be affected by this critical&nbsp;
habitat designation, State governments are not considered small&nbsp;
governments, for the purposes of the RFA. SBREFA further defines&nbsp;
``small organization'' as any not for profit enterprise that is&nbsp;
independently owned and operated and is not dominant in its field.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The RFA/SBREFA does not explicitly define either ``substantial&nbsp;
number'' or ``significant economic impact.'' Consequently, to assess&nbsp;
whether a ``substantial number'' of small entities is affected by this&nbsp;
designation. This analysis considers the relative number of small&nbsp;
entities likely to be impacted in an area. In addition, Federal courts&nbsp;
and Congress have indicated that an RFA/SBREFA is properly limited to&nbsp;
impacts to entities directly subject to the requirements of the&nbsp;
regulation (Service 2002). Therefore, entities not directly regulated&nbsp;
by the listing or critical habitat designation are not considered in&nbsp;
this section of the analysis.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even where the requirements of section 7 might apply due to&nbsp;
critical habitat, based on our experience with section 7 consultations&nbsp;
for all listed species, virtually all projects, including those that,&nbsp;
in their initial proposed form, would result in jeopardy or adverse&nbsp;
modification determinations under section 7, can be implemented&nbsp;
successfully with, at most, the adoption of reasonable and prudent&nbsp;
alternatives. These measures by definition must be economically&nbsp;
feasible and within the scope of authority of the Federal agency&nbsp;
involved in the consultation.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For these reasons, we are certifying that the designation of&nbsp;
critical habitat for the 15 vernal pool species will not have a&nbsp;
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.&nbsp;
Therefore, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required.

Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (5 U.S.C. 801 et&nbsp;
seq.)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (5&nbsp;
U.S.C. 801 et seq.), this rule is not a major rule. Our detailed&nbsp;
assessment of the economic effects of this designation are described in&nbsp;
the DEA and final economic analysis.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Several counties have been excluded from this rule because of the&nbsp;
high economic impacts among small entities estimated from our economic&nbsp;
analysis. Based on the economic analysis, the

[[Page 46755]]

following counties are excluded from this rule under section 4(b)(2) of&nbsp;
the Act: Butte, Madera, Merced, Solano, and Sacramento. The exclusion&nbsp;
of these counties substantially reduces the economic effect of this&nbsp;
rule. Based on the effects identified in the economic analysis and the&nbsp;
exclusions we have made, we believe that this critical habitat&nbsp;
designation will not have an effect on the economy of $100 million or&nbsp;
more, will not cause a major increase in costs or prices for consumers,&nbsp;
and will not have significant adverse effects on competition,&nbsp;
employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or the ability of&nbsp;
U.S.-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises. Refer&nbsp;
to the final economic analysis for a discussion of the potential&nbsp;
effects of the proposed designation.

Executive Order 13211

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On May 18, 2001, the President issued Executive Order 13211, on&nbsp;
regulations that significantly affect energy supply, distribution, and&nbsp;
use. Executive Order 13211 requires agencies to prepare Statements of&nbsp;
Energy Effects when undertaking certain actions. Although this rule is&nbsp;
a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866, it is not&nbsp;
expected to significantly affect energy production supply and&nbsp;
distribution facilities because no energy production, supply, and&nbsp;
distribution facilities are included within designated critical&nbsp;
habitat. Further, for the reasons described in the economic analysis,&nbsp;
we do not believe the designation of critical habitat for the 15 vernal&nbsp;
pool species in California and Oregon will affect future energy&nbsp;
production. Therefore, this action is not a significant energy action&nbsp;
and no Statement of Energy Effects is required.

Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (2 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (2 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.) requires&nbsp;
each agency, unless otherwise prohibited by law, to assess the effects&nbsp;
of Federal regulatory actions on State, local, and tribal governments,&nbsp;
and the private sector. Under section 202 of UMRA, we must prepare a&nbsp;
written statement, including a cost-benefit analysis, for significant&nbsp;
regulatory actions that include a Federal mandate resulting in the&nbsp;
expenditure by State, local, and tribal governments, in the aggregate,&nbsp;
or by the private sector, of $100 million or more in any one year. Even&nbsp;
though the economic analysis that was prepared in support of this&nbsp;
rulemaking fully assesses the effects of this designation on Federal,&nbsp;
State, local, and tribal governments, and to the private sector, the&nbsp;
designation of critical habitat will not result in a Federal mandate&nbsp;
imposing an enforceable duty upon those entities and a written&nbsp;
statement is not required.

Takings

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In accordance with Executive Order 12630 (``Government Actions and&nbsp;
Interference with Constitutionally Protected Private Property&nbsp;
Rights''), we have analyzed the potential takings implications of&nbsp;
designating critical habitat for these 15 vernal pool species in a&nbsp;
takings implications assessment. The takings implications assessment&nbsp;
concludes that this final designation of critical habitat for the 15&nbsp;
vernal pool species does not pose significant takings implications.

Federalism

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In accordance with Executive Order 13132, this final rule does not&nbsp;
have significant Federalism effects or impose substantial direct&nbsp;
compliance costs on State and local governments. This designation&nbsp;
requires Federal agencies to ensure that their actions do not adversely&nbsp;
modify critical habitat; it does not impose direct obligations on State&nbsp;
or local governments. A Federalism assessment is not required. In&nbsp;
keeping with Department of Interior policy, we requested information&nbsp;
from appropriate State agencies in California and Oregon. The economic&nbsp;
analysis does address possible impacts to State programs that may&nbsp;
receive Federal funding. However, it does not conclude that there will&nbsp;
be substantial costs to those programs due to the designation of&nbsp;
critical habitat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The designations may have some benefit to these governments, in&nbsp;
that the areas essential to the conservation of the 15 vernal pool&nbsp;
species are more clearly defined, and the primary constituent elements&nbsp;
of the habitat necessary to their survival are specifically identified.&nbsp;
While this definition and identification do not alter where and what&nbsp;
federally sponsored activities may occur, they may assist these local&nbsp;
governments in long-range planning, rather than causing them to wait&nbsp;
for case-by-case section 7 consultation to occur.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In accordance with Executive Order 12988, the Department of the&nbsp;
Interior's Office of the Solicitor has determined that this rule does&nbsp;
not unduly burden the judicial system and does meet the requirements of&nbsp;
sections 3(a) and 3(b)(2) of the Order. We have designated critical&nbsp;
habitat in accordance with the provisions of the Endangered Species&nbsp;
Act. The rule uses standard property descriptions and identifies the&nbsp;
primary constituent elements within the designated areas to assist the&nbsp;
public in understanding the habitat needs of the vernal pool&nbsp;
crustaceans and vernal pool plants.

Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This rule does not contain any information collection requirements&nbsp;
for which OMB approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act is required.&nbsp;
An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to&nbsp;
respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a valid OMB&nbsp;
control number.

National Environmental Policy Act

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have determined that we do not need to prepare an Environmental&nbsp;
Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement as defined by the&nbsp;
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 in connection with&nbsp;
regulations adopted pursuant to section 4(a) of the Endangered Species&nbsp;
Act. We published a notice outlining our reason for this determination&nbsp;
in the Federal Register on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244).

Government to Government Relationship With Tribes

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In accordance with the President's memorandum of April 29, 1994,&nbsp;
``Government-to-Government Relations with Native American Tribal&nbsp;
Governments'' (59 FR 22951); Executive Order 13175 (November 9, 2000;&nbsp;
65 FR 67249) and the Department of the Interior's manual at 512 DM 2,&nbsp;
we readily acknowledge our responsibility to communicate meaningfully&nbsp;
with recognized Federal Tribes on a government-to-government basis. We&nbsp;
have excluded Tribal trust lands of the Mechoopda Indian Tribe of Chico&nbsp;
Rancheria, California, from this final critical habitat designation&nbsp;
pursuant to section 4(b)(2) of the Act. Please refer to Relationship of&nbsp;
Critical Habitat to Tribal Lands for further discussion of our&nbsp;
exclusion of these Tribal trust lands.

4. In Sec.&nbsp; 17.95 add critical habitat for Conservancy fairy shrimp&nbsp;
(Branchinecta conservatio), longhorn fairy shrimp (Branchinecta&nbsp;
longiantenna), vernal pool fairy shrimp (Branchinecta lynchi), and&nbsp;
vernal pool tadpole shrimp (Lepidurus packardi) under paragraph (h) in&nbsp;
the same alphabetical order as this species occurs in Sec.&nbsp; 17.11(h),&nbsp;
to read as follows:


Sec.&nbsp; 17.95&nbsp; Critical habitat--fish and wildlife.

* * * * *
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (h) Crustaceans.
* * * * *
Conservancy fairy shrimp (Branchinecta conservatio)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Tehama, Glenn, Colusa,&nbsp;
Stanislaus, Mariposa and Ventura Counties, California, on the map&nbsp;
below.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for&nbsp;
Conservancy fairy shrimp are the habitat components that provide:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) Vernal pools, swales, and other ephemeral wetlands and&nbsp;
depressions of appropriate sizes and depths that typically become&nbsp;
inundated during winter rains and hold water for sufficient lengths of&nbsp;
time necessary for Conservancy fairy shrimp incubation, reproduction,&nbsp;
dispersal, feeding, and sheltering, including but not limited to large,&nbsp;
playa vernal pools often on basin rim landforms and alkaline soils, but&nbsp;
which are dry during the summer and do not necessarily fill with water&nbsp;
every year; and
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) The geographic, topographic, and edaphic features that support&nbsp;
aggregations or systems of hydrologically interconnected pools, swales,&nbsp;
and other ephemeral wetlands and depressions within a matrix of&nbsp;
surrounding uplands that together form hydrologically and ecologically&nbsp;
functional units called vernal pool complexes. These features&nbsp;
contribute to the filling and drying of the vernal pool, and maintain&nbsp;
suitable periods of pool inundation, water quality, and soil moisture&nbsp;
for vernal pool crustacean hatching, growth and reproduction, and&nbsp;
dispersal, but not necessarily every year.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) Existing manmade features and structures, such as buildings,&nbsp;
roads, railroads, airports, runways, other paved areas, lawns, and&nbsp;
other urban landscaped areas do not contain one or more of the primary&nbsp;
constituent elements. Federal actions limited to those areas,&nbsp;
therefore, would not trigger a consultation under section 7 of the Act&nbsp;
unless they may affect the species and/or primary constituent elements&nbsp;
in adjacent critical habitat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4) Critical habitat does not include the following lands although&nbsp;
they may fall within the legal descriptions below:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) Lands within the following California counties: Butte, Madera,&nbsp;
Merced, Sacramento, and Solano;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) Federally-owned lands within the boundaries of the Kern,&nbsp;
Sacramento, San Francisco Bay, and San Luis National Wildlife Refuges&nbsp;
and National Wildlife Refuge Complexes, and the Coleman National Fish&nbsp;
Hatchery;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iii) State-owned lands within the boundaries of the Allensworth,&nbsp;
Boggs Lake, Butte Creek Canyon, Calhoun Cut, Carrizo Plains, Dales&nbsp;
Lake, Fagan Marsh, Phoenix Field, San Joaquin River, Stone Corral, and&nbsp;
Thomes Creek Ecological Reserves;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iv) State-owned lands within the boundaries of the Battle Creek,&nbsp;
Big Sandy, Grizzly Island, Hill Slough, North Grasslands, and Oroville&nbsp;
Wildlife Areas.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5) Unit 1: Butte and Tehama Counties, California. From USGS&nbsp;
1:24,000 quadrangle maps Acorn Hollow, Campbell Mound, Foster Island,&nbsp;

Longhorn Fairy Shrimp (Branchinecta longiantenna)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Alameda, Contra Costa,&nbsp;
and San Luis Obispo Counties, California, on the map below.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for&nbsp;
longhorn fairy

[[Page 46763]]

shrimp are the habitat components that provide:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) Vernal pools, swales, and other ephemeral wetlands and&nbsp;
depressions of appropriate sizes and depths that typically become&nbsp;
inundated during winter rains and hold water for sufficient lengths of&nbsp;
time necessary for longhorn fairy shrimp incubation, reproduction,&nbsp;
dispersal, feeding, and sheltering, including but not limited to,&nbsp;
large, playa vernal pools often on basin rim landforms and alkaline&nbsp;
soils, but which are dry during the summer and do not necessarily fill&nbsp;
with water every year; and
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) The geographic, topographic, and edaphic features that support&nbsp;
aggregations or systems of hydrologically interconnected pools, swales,&nbsp;
and other ephemeral wetlands and depressions within a matrix of&nbsp;
surrounding uplands that together form hydrologically and ecologically&nbsp;
functional units called vernal pool complexes. These features&nbsp;
contribute to the filling and drying of the vernal pool, and maintain&nbsp;
suitable periods of pool inundation, water quality, and soil moisture&nbsp;
for vernal pool crustacean hatching, growth and reproduction, and&nbsp;
dispersal, but not necessarily every year.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) Existing manmade features and structures, such as buildings,&nbsp;
roads, railroads, airports, runways, other paved areas, lawns, and&nbsp;
other urban landscaped areas do not contain one or more of the primary&nbsp;
constituent elements. Federal actions limited to those areas,&nbsp;
therefore, would not trigger a consultation under section 7 of the Act&nbsp;
unless they may affect the species and/or primary constituent elements&nbsp;
in adjacent critical habitat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4) Critical habitat does not include the following lands although&nbsp;
they may fall within the legal descriptions below:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) Lands within the following California counties: Butte, Madera,&nbsp;
Merced, Sacramento, and Solano;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) Federally-owned lands within the boundaries of the Kern,&nbsp;
Sacramento, San Francisco Bay, and San Luis National Wildlife Refuges&nbsp;
and National Wildlife Refuge Complexes, and the Coleman National Fish&nbsp;

Vernal Pool Fairy Shrimp (Branchinecta lynchi)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Jackson County, Oregon;&nbsp;
Shasta, Tehama, Glenn, Colusa, Placer, Napa, Contra Costa, Alameda,&nbsp;
Amador, San Joaquin, Stanislaus, Mariposa, Fresno, Tulare, Kings, San&nbsp;
Benito, Monterey, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, and Ventura Counties,&nbsp;
California on the map below:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for vernal&nbsp;
pool fairy shrimp are the habitat components that provide:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) Vernal pools, swales, and other ephemeral wetlands and&nbsp;
depressions of appropriate sizes and depths that typically become&nbsp;
inundated during winter rains and hold water for sufficient lengths of&nbsp;
time necessary for vernal pool fairy shrimp incubation, reproduction,&nbsp;
dispersal, feeding, and sheltering, including but not limited to,&nbsp;
Northern Hardpan, Northern Claypan, Northern Volcanic Mud Flow, and&nbsp;
Northern Basalt Flow vernal pools formed on a variety of geologic&nbsp;
formations and soil types, but which are dry during the summer and do&nbsp;
not necessarily fill with water every year; and
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) The geographic, topographic, and edaphic features that support&nbsp;
aggregations or systems of hydrologically interconnected pools, swales,&nbsp;
and other ephemeral wetlands and depressions within a matrix of&nbsp;
surrounding uplands that together form hydrologically and ecologically&nbsp;
functional units called vernal pool complexes. These features&nbsp;
contribute to the filling and drying of the vernal pool, and maintain&nbsp;
suitable periods of pool inundation, water quality, and soil moisture&nbsp;
for vernal pool crustacean hatching, growth and reproduction, and&nbsp;
dispersal, but not necessarily every year.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) Existing manmade features and structures, such as buildings,&nbsp;
roads, railroads, airports, runways, other paved areas, lawns, and&nbsp;
other urban landscaped areas do not contain one or more of the primary&nbsp;
constituent elements. Federal actions limited to those areas,&nbsp;
therefore, would not trigger a consultation under section 7 of the Act&nbsp;
unless they may affect the species and/or primary constituent elements&nbsp;
in adjacent critical habitat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4) Critical habitat does not include the following lands although&nbsp;
they may fall within the legal descriptions below:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) Lands within the following California counties: Butte, Madera,&nbsp;
Merced, Sacramento, and Solano;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) Federally-owned lands within the boundaries of the Kern,&nbsp;
Sacramento, San Francisco Bay, and San Luis National Wildlife Refuges&nbsp;
and National Wildlife Refuge Complexes, and the Coleman National Fish&nbsp;
Hatchery;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iii) State-owned lands within the boundaries of the Allensworth,&nbsp;
Boggs Lake, Butte Creek Canyon, Calhoun Cut, Carrizo Plains, Dales&nbsp;
Lake, Fagan Marsh, Phoenix Field, San Joaquin River, Stone Corral, and&nbsp;
Thomes Creek Ecological Reserves;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iv) State-owned lands within the boundaries of the Battle Creek,&nbsp;
Big Sandy, Grizzly Island, Hill Slough, North Grasslands, and Oroville&nbsp;
Wildlife Areas.

Vernal Pool Tadpole Shrimp (Lepidurus packardi)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Shasta, Tehama, Glenn,&nbsp;
Colusa, Alameda, Amador, Stanislaus, Mariposa, Fresno, Tulare and Kings&nbsp;
Counties, California on the map below.

[[Page 46795]]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for vernal&nbsp;
pool tadpole shrimp are the habitat components that provide:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) Vernal pools, swales, and other ephemeral wetlands and&nbsp;
depressions of appropriate sizes and depths that typically become&nbsp;
inundated during winter rains and hold water for sufficient lengths of&nbsp;
time necessary for vernal pool tadpole shrimp incubation, reproduction,&nbsp;
dispersal, feeding, and sheltering, but which are dry during the summer&nbsp;
and do not necessarily fill with water every year, including but not&nbsp;
limited to, vernal pools on Redding and Corning soils on high terrace&nbsp;
landforms, and
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) The geographic, topographic, and edaphic features that support&nbsp;
aggregations or systems of hydrologically interconnected pools, swales,&nbsp;
and other ephemeral wetlands and depressions within a matrix of&nbsp;
surrounding uplands that together form hydrologically and ecologically&nbsp;
functional units called vernal pool complexes. These features&nbsp;
contribute to the filling and drying of the vernal pool, and maintain&nbsp;
suitable periods of pool inundation, water quality, and soil moisture&nbsp;
for vernal pool crustacean hatching, growth and reproduction, and&nbsp;
dispersal, but not necessarily every year.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) Existing manmade features and structures, such as buildings,&nbsp;
roads, railroads, airports, runways, other paved areas, lawns, and&nbsp;
other urban landscaped areas do not contain one or more of the primary&nbsp;
constituent elements. Federal actions limited to those areas,&nbsp;
therefore, would not trigger a consultation under section 7 of the Act&nbsp;
unless they may affect the species and/or primary constituent elements&nbsp;
in adjacent critical habitat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4) Critical habitat does not include the following lands although&nbsp;
they may fall within the legal descriptions below:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) Lands within the following California counties: Butte, Madera,&nbsp;
Merced, Sacramento, and Solano;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) Federally-owned lands within the boundaries of the Kern,&nbsp;
Sacramento, San Francisco Bay, and San Luis National Wildlife Refuges&nbsp;
and National Wildlife Refuge Complexes, and the Coleman National Fish&nbsp;
Hatchery;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iii) State-owned lands within the boundaries of the Allensworth,&nbsp;
Boggs Lake, Butte Creek Canyon, Calhoun Cut, Carrizo Plains, Dales&nbsp;
Lake, Fagan Marsh, Phoenix Field, San Joaquin River, Stone Corral, and&nbsp;
Thomes Creek Ecological Reserves;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iv) State-owned lands within the boundaries of the Battle Creek,&nbsp;
Big Sandy, Grizzly Island, Hill Slough, North Grasslands, and Oroville&nbsp;
Wildlife Areas.

Sec.&nbsp; 17.96&nbsp; Critical habitat--plants.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) Flowering plants.
* * * * *
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Family Asteraceae: Lasthenia conjugens (Contra Costa Goldfields).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Mendocino, Napa, Contra&nbsp;
Costa, Alameda, Santa Clara and Monterey Counties, California, on the&nbsp;
map below.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for&nbsp;
Lasthenia conjugens are the habitat components that provide:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) Vernal pools, swales, moist flats, and other ephemeral wetlands&nbsp;
and depressions of appropriate sizes and depths and the adjacent upland&nbsp;
margins of these depressions that sustain Lasthenia conjugens&nbsp;
germination, growth and reproduction, including, but not limited to,&nbsp;
vernal pools on clay soils from a variety of soils series, rock outcrop&nbsp;
pools on basalt flows, and vernal pools in saline alkaline transition&nbsp;
zones with tidal marsh habitats. All of these habitats typically become&nbsp;
inundated during winter rains, but are dry during the summer and do not&nbsp;
necessarily fill with water every year; and
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) The associated watershed(s) and hydrologic features, including&nbsp;
the pool basin, swales, and surrounding uplands (which may vary in&nbsp;
extent depending on pool size and depth, soil type and depth, hardpan&nbsp;
or claypan type and extent, topography, and climate) that contribute to&nbsp;
the filling and drying of the vernal pool or ephemeral wetland, and&nbsp;
that maintain suitable periods of pool inundation, water quality, and&nbsp;
soil moisture for Lasthenia conjugens germination, growth and&nbsp;
reproduction, and dispersal, but not necessarily every year.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) Critical habitat does not include existing manmade features and&nbsp;
structures, such as buildings, roads, aqueducts, railroads, airport&nbsp;
runways and buildings, other paved areas, lawns, and other urban&nbsp;
landscaped areas not containing one or more of the primary constituent&nbsp;
elements.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4) Critical habitat does not include the following lands although&nbsp;
they may fall within the legal descriptions below:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) Lands within the following California counties: Butte, Madera,&nbsp;
Merced, Sacramento, and Solano;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) Federally-owned lands within the boundaries of the Kern,&nbsp;
Sacramento, San Francisco Bay, and San Luis National Wildlife Refuges&nbsp;
and National Wildlife Refuge Complexes, and the Coleman National Fish&nbsp;
Hatchery;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iii) State-owned lands within the boundaries of the Allensworth,&nbsp;
Boggs Lake, Butte Creek Canyon, Calhoun Cut, Carrizo Plains, Dales&nbsp;
Lake, Fagan Marsh, Phoenix Field, San Joaquin River, Stone Corral, and&nbsp;
Thomes Creek Ecological Reserves;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iv) State-owned lands within the boundaries of the Battle Creek,&nbsp;
Big Sandy, Grizzly Island, Hill Slough, North Grasslands, and Oroville&nbsp;
Wildlife Areas.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Family Euphorbiaceae: Chamaesyce hooveri (Hoovers Spurge).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Tehama, Glenn, Colusa,&nbsp;
Stanislaus, Tulare and Tuolumne Counties, California, on the map below.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for&nbsp;
Chamaesyce hooveri are the habitat components that provide:

[[Page 46817]]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) Vernal pools, swales, and other ephemeral wetlands and&nbsp;
depressions of appropriate sizes and depths and the adjacent upland&nbsp;
margins of these depressions that sustain Chamaesyce hooveri&nbsp;
germination, growth and reproduction, including but not limited to,&nbsp;
vernal pools formed on neutral to saline-alkaline soils over lime-
silica cemented hardpan or claypan, or on acidic soils over iron-silica&nbsp;
cemented hardpan, that typically become inundated during winter rains,&nbsp;
but are dry during the summer and do not necessarily fill with water&nbsp;
every year; and
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) The associated watershed(s) and hydrologic features, including&nbsp;
the pool basin, swales, and surrounding uplands (which may vary in&nbsp;
extent depending on pool size and depth, soil type and depth, hardpan&nbsp;
or claypan type and extent, topography, and climate) that contribute to&nbsp;
the filling and drying of the vernal pool or ephemeral wetland, and&nbsp;
that maintain suitable periods of pool inundation, water quality, and&nbsp;
soil moisture for Chamaesyce hooveri germination, growth and&nbsp;
reproduction, and dispersal, but not necessarily every year.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) Critical habitat does not include existing manmade features and&nbsp;
structures, such as buildings, roads, aqueduct, railroads, airport&nbsp;
runways and buildings, other paved areas, lawns, and other urban&nbsp;
landscaped areas not containing one or more of the primary constituent&nbsp;
elements.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4) Critical habitat does not include the following lands although&nbsp;
they may fall within the legal descriptions below:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) Lands within the following California counties: Butte, Madera,&nbsp;
Merced, Sacramento, and Solano;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) Federally-owned lands within the boundaries of the Kern,&nbsp;
Sacramento, San Francisco Bay, and San Luis National Wildlife Refuges&nbsp;
and National Wildlife Refuge Complexes, and the Coleman National Fish&nbsp;
Hatchery;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iii) State-owned lands within the boundaries of the Allensworth,&nbsp;
Boggs Lake, Butte Creek Canyon, Calhoun Cut, Carrizo Plains, Dales&nbsp;
Lake, Fagan Marsh, Phoenix Field, San Joaquin River, Stone Corral, and&nbsp;
Thomes Creek Ecological Reserves;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iv) State-owned lands within the boundaries of the Battle Creek,&nbsp;
Big Sandy, Grizzly Island, Hill Slough, North Grasslands, and Oroville&nbsp;
Wildlife Areas.

Family Limnanthaceae: Limnanthes floccosa ssp. californica (Butte&nbsp;
County Meadowfoam).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Tehama County,&nbsp;
California, on the map below.

[[Page 46824]]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for&nbsp;
Limnanthes floccosa ssp. californica are the habitat components that&nbsp;
provide:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) Vernal pools, swales, and other ephemeral wetlands and&nbsp;
depressions of appropriate sizes and depths and the adjacent upland&nbsp;
margins of these depressions that sustain Limnanthes floccosa ssp.&nbsp;
californica germination, growth and reproduction, including but not&nbsp;
limited to, vernal pool swales and the margins of vernal pools on the&nbsp;
Tuscan, Redbluff, Riverbank, and Modesto geologic formations underlain&nbsp;
by Tuscan-Anita and Igo-Redding complex soils among others. These&nbsp;
habitats typically become inundated during winter rains, but are dry&nbsp;
during the summer and do not necessarily fill with water every year;&nbsp;
and
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) The associated watershed(s) and hydrologic features, including&nbsp;
the pool basin, swales, and surrounding uplands (which may vary in&nbsp;
extent depending on pool size and depth, soil type and depth, hardpan&nbsp;
or claypan type and extent, topography, and climate) that contribute to&nbsp;
the filling and drying of the vernal pool or ephemeral wetland, and&nbsp;
that maintain suitable periods of pool inundation, water quality, and&nbsp;
soil moisture for Limnanthes floccosa ssp. californica germination,&nbsp;
growth and reproduction, and dispersal, but not necessarily every year.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) Critical habitat does not include existing manmade features and&nbsp;
structures, such as buildings, roads, aqueducts, railroads, airport&nbsp;
runways and buildings, other paved areas, lawns, and other urban&nbsp;
landscaped areas not containing one or more of the primary constituent&nbsp;
elements.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4) Critical habitat does not include the following lands although&nbsp;
they may fall within the legal descriptions below:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) Lands within the following California counties: Butte, Madera,&nbsp;
Merced, Sacramento, and Solano;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) Federally-owned lands within the boundaries of the Kern,&nbsp;
Sacramento, San Francisco Bay, and San Luis National Wildlife Refuges&nbsp;
and National Wildlife Refuge Complexes, and the Coleman National Fish&nbsp;
Hatchery;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iii) State-owned lands within the boundaries of the Allensworth,&nbsp;
Boggs Lake, Butte Creek Canyon, Calhoun Cut, Carrizo Plains, Dales&nbsp;
Lake, Fagan Marsh, Phoenix Field, San Joaquin River, Stone Corral, and&nbsp;
Thomes Creek Ecological Reserves;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iv) State-owned lands within the boundaries of the Battle Creek,&nbsp;
Big Sandy, Grizzly Island, Hill Slough, North Grasslands, and Oroville&nbsp;
Wildlife Areas.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) Vernal pools, swales, and other ephemeral wetlands and&nbsp;
depressions of appropriate sizes and depths and the adjacent upland&nbsp;
margins of these depressions that sustain Orcuttia inaequalis&nbsp;
germination, growth and reproduction, including but not limited to&nbsp;
vernal pools on alluvial fans, high and low stream terraces, and&nbsp;
tabletop lava flows. These habitats typically become inundated during&nbsp;
winter rains, but are dry during the summer and do not necessarily fill&nbsp;
with water every year; and
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) The associated watershed(s) and hydrologic features, including&nbsp;
the pool basin, swales, and surrounding uplands (which may vary in&nbsp;
extent depending on pool size and depth, soil type and depth, hardpan&nbsp;
or claypan type and extent, topography, and climate) that contribute to&nbsp;
the filling and drying of the vernal pool or ephemeral wetland, and&nbsp;
that maintain suitable periods of pool inundation, water quality, and&nbsp;
soil moisture for Orcuttia inaequalis germination, growth and&nbsp;
reproduction, and dispersal, but not necessarily every year.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) Critical habitat does not include existing manmade features and&nbsp;
structures, such as buildings, roads, aqueducts, railroads, airport&nbsp;
runways and buildings, other paved areas, lawns, and other urban&nbsp;
landscaped areas not containing one or more of the primary constituent&nbsp;
elements.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4) Critical habitat does not include the following lands although&nbsp;
they may fall within the legal descriptions below:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) Lands within the following California counties: Butte, Madera,&nbsp;
Merced, Sacramento, and Solano;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) Federally-owned lands within the boundaries of the Kern,&nbsp;
Sacramento, San Francisco Bay, and San Luis National Wildlife Refuges&nbsp;
and National Wildlife Refuge Complexes, and the Coleman National Fish&nbsp;
Hatchery;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iii) State-owned lands within the boundaries of the Allensworth,&nbsp;
Boggs Lake, Butte Creek Canyon, Calhoun Cut, Carrizo Plains, Dales&nbsp;
Lake, Fagan Marsh, Phoenix Field, San Joaquin River, Stone Corral, and&nbsp;
Thomes Creek Ecological Reserves;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iv) State-owned lands within the boundaries of the Battle Creek,&nbsp;
Big Sandy, Grizzly Island, Hill Slough, North Grasslands, and Oroville&nbsp;
Wildlife Areas.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Family Poaceae: Orcuttia pilosa (Hairy Orcutt Grass).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Tehama, Glenn, Colusa,&nbsp;
Stanislaus, Mariposa and Fresno Counties, California, on the map below.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for&nbsp;
Orcuttia pilosa are the habitat components that provide:

[[Page 46839]]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) Vernal pools, swales, and other ephemeral wetlands and&nbsp;
depressions of appropriate sizes and depths and the adjacent upland&nbsp;
margins of these depressions that sustain Orcuttia pilosa germination,&nbsp;
growth and reproduction, including but not limited to features&nbsp;
occurring on both acidic and saline-alkaline soils, with an iron-silica&nbsp;
cemented hardpan or claypan, and that typically become inundated during&nbsp;
winter rains, but are dry during the summer and do not necessarily fill&nbsp;
with water every year; and
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) The associated watershed(s) and hydrologic features, including&nbsp;
the pool basin, swales, and surrounding uplands (which may vary in&nbsp;
extent depending on pool size and depth, soil type and depth, hardpan&nbsp;
or claypan type and extent, topography, and climate) that contribute to&nbsp;
the filling and drying of the vernal pool or ephemeral wetland, and&nbsp;
that maintain suitable periods of pool inundation, water quality, and&nbsp;
soil moisture for Orcuttia pilosa germination, growth and reproduction,&nbsp;
and dispersal, but not necessarily every year.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) Critical habitat does not include existing manmade features and&nbsp;
structures, such as buildings, roads, aqueducts, railroads, airport&nbsp;
runways and buildings, other paved areas, lawns, and other urban&nbsp;
landscaped areas not containing one or more of the primary constituent&nbsp;
elements.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4) Critical habitat does not include the following lands although&nbsp;
they may fall within the legal descriptions below:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) Lands within the following California counties: Butte, Madera,&nbsp;
Merced, Sacramento, and Solano;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) Federally-owned lands within the boundaries of the Kern,&nbsp;
Sacramento, San Francisco Bay, and San Luis National Wildlife Refuges&nbsp;
and National Wildlife Refuge Complexes, and the Coleman National Fish&nbsp;
Hatchery;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iii) State-owned lands within the boundaries of the Allensworth,&nbsp;
Boggs Lake, Butte Creek Canyon, Calhoun Cut, Carrizo Plains, Dales&nbsp;
Lake, Fagan Marsh, Phoenix Field, San Joaquin River, Stone Corral, and&nbsp;
Thomes Creek Ecological Reserves;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iv) State-owned lands within the boundaries of the Battle Creek,&nbsp;
Big Sandy, Grizzly Island, Hill Slough, North Grasslands, and Oroville&nbsp;
Wildlife Areas.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Family Poaceae: Orcuttia tenuis (Slender Orcutt Grass).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Siskiyou, Modoc,&nbsp;
Shasta, Lassen, Tehama, Plumas, and Lake Counties, California, on the&nbsp;
map below.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for&nbsp;
Orcuttia tenuis are the habitat components that provide:

[[Page 46843]]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) Vernal pools, swales, and other ephemeral wetlands and&nbsp;
depressions of appropriate sizes and depths and the adjacent upland&nbsp;
margins of these depressions that sustain Orcuttia tenuis germination,&nbsp;
growth and reproduction, including but not limited to, Northern&nbsp;
Volcanic Ashflow and Northern Volcanic Mudflow vernal pools (Sawyer and&nbsp;
Keeler-Wolf 1995) with iron-silica and bedrock hardpan impervious&nbsp;
layers, and that typically become inundated during winter rains, but&nbsp;
are dry during the summer and do not necessarily fill with water every&nbsp;
year; and
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) The associated watershed(s) and hydrologic features, including&nbsp;
the pool basin, swales, and surrounding uplands (which may vary in&nbsp;
extent depending on pool size and depth, soil type and depth, hardpan&nbsp;
or claypan type and extent, topography, and climate) that contribute to&nbsp;
the filling and drying of the vernal pool or ephemeral wetland, and&nbsp;
that maintain suitable periods of pool inundation, water quality, and&nbsp;
soil moisture for Orcuttia tenuis germination, growth and reproduction,&nbsp;
and dispersal, but not necessarily every year.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) Critical habitat does not include existing manmade features and&nbsp;
structures, such as buildings, roads, aquaducts, railroads, airport&nbsp;
runways and buildings, other paved areas, lawns, and other urban&nbsp;
landscaped areas not containing one or more of the primary constituent&nbsp;
elements.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4) Critical habitat does not include the following lands although&nbsp;
they may fall within the legal descriptions below:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) Lands within the following California counties: Butte, Madera,&nbsp;
Merced, Sacramento, and Solano;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) Federally-owned lands within the boundaries of the Kern,&nbsp;
Sacramento, San Francisco Bay, and San Luis National Wildlife Refuges&nbsp;
and National Wildlife Refuge Complexes, and the Coleman National Fish&nbsp;
Hatchery;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iii) State-owned lands within the boundaries of the Allensworth,&nbsp;
Boggs Lake, Butte Creek Canyon, Calhoun Cut, Carrizo Plains, Dales&nbsp;
Lake, Fagan Marsh, Phoenix Field, San Joaquin River, Stone Corral, and&nbsp;
Thomes Creek Ecological Reserves;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iv) State-owned lands within the boundaries of the Battle Creek,&nbsp;
Big Sandy, Grizzly Island, Hill Slough, North Grasslands, and Oroville&nbsp;
Wildlife Areas.

BILLING CODE 4310-55-C
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Family Poaceae: Orcuttia viscida (Sacramento Orcutt Grass).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Amador County,&nbsp;
California, on the map below.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for&nbsp;
Orcuttia viscida are the habitat components that provide:

[[Page 46849]]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) Vernal pools, swales, and other ephemeral wetlands and&nbsp;
depressions of appropriate sizes and depths and the adjacent upland&nbsp;
margins of these depressions that sustain Orcuttia viscida germination,&nbsp;
growth and reproduction, including but not limited to vernal pools on&nbsp;
high terrace landforms on acidic soils such as Red Bluff, Redding, and&nbsp;
Corning soil series. These habitats typically become inundated during&nbsp;
winter rains, but are dry during the summer and do not necessarily fill&nbsp;
with water every year; and
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) The associated watershed(s) and hydrologic features, including&nbsp;
the pool basin, swales, and surrounding uplands (which may vary in&nbsp;
extent depending on pool size and depth, soil type and depth, hardpan&nbsp;
or claypan type and extent, topography, and climate) that contribute to&nbsp;
the filling and drying of the vernal pool or ephemeral wetland, and&nbsp;
that maintain suitable periods of pool inundation, water quality, and&nbsp;
soil moisture for Orcuttia viscida germination, growth and&nbsp;
reproduction, and dispersal, but not necessarily every year.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) Critical habitat does not include existing manmade features and&nbsp;
structures, such as buildings, roads, aquaducts, railroads, airport&nbsp;
runways and buildings, other paved areas, lawns, and other urban&nbsp;
landscaped areas not containing one or more of the primary constituent&nbsp;
elements.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4) Critical habitat does not include the following lands although&nbsp;
they may fall within the legal descriptions below:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Family Poaceae: Tuctoria greenei (Greene's Tuctoria).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Shasta, Tehama, Glenn,&nbsp;
Colusa, Stanislaus, Tuolumne, and Mariposa Counties, California, on the&nbsp;
map below.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for&nbsp;
Tuctoria greenei are the habitat components that provide:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) Vernal pools, swales, and other ephemeral wetlands and&nbsp;
depressions of appropriate sizes and depths and the adjacent upland&nbsp;
margins of these depressions that sustain Tuctoria greenei germination,&nbsp;
growth and reproduction, including but not limited to, Northern&nbsp;
Claypan, Northern Hardpan and Northern Basalt flow vernal pools, that&nbsp;
typically become inundated during winter rains, but are dry during the&nbsp;
summer and do not necessarily fill with water every year; and
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) The associated watershed(s) and hydrologic features, including&nbsp;
the pool basin, swales, and surrounding uplands (which may vary in&nbsp;
extent depending on pool size and depth, soil type and depth, hardpan&nbsp;
or claypan type and extent, topography, and climate) that contribute to&nbsp;
the filling and drying of the vernal pool or ephemeral wetland, and&nbsp;
that maintain suitable periods of pool inundation, water quality, and&nbsp;
soil moisture for Tuctoria greenei germination, growth and&nbsp;
reproduction, and dispersal, but not necessarily every year.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) Critical habitat does not include existing manmade features and&nbsp;
structures, such as buildings, roads, aqueducts, railroads, airport&nbsp;
runways and buildings, other paved areas, lawns, and other urban&nbsp;
landscaped areas not containing one or more of the primary constituent&nbsp;
elements.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4) Critical habitat does not include the following lands although&nbsp;
they may fall within the legal descriptions below:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) Lands within the following California counties: Butte, Madera,&nbsp;
Merced, Sacramento, and Solano;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) Federally-owned lands within the boundaries of the Kern,&nbsp;
Sacramento, San Francisco Bay, and San Luis National Wildlife Refuges&nbsp;
and National Wildlife Refuge Complexes, and the Coleman National Fish&nbsp;
Hatchery;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iii) State-owned lands within the boundaries of the Allensworth,&nbsp;
Boggs Lake, Butte Creek Canyon, Calhoun Cut, Carrizo Plains, Dales&nbsp;
Lake, Fagan Marsh, Phoenix Field, San Joaquin River, Stone Corral, and&nbsp;
Thomes Creek Ecological Reserves;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iv) State-owned lands within the boundaries of the Battle Creek,&nbsp;
Big Sandy, Grizzly Island, Hill Slough, North Grasslands, and Oroville&nbsp;
Wildlife Areas.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Family Poaceae: Tuctoria mucronata (Solano Grass).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Yolo County,&nbsp;
California, on the map below.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for&nbsp;
Tuctoria mucronata are the habitat components that provide:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) Vernal pools, swales, and other ephemeral wetlands and&nbsp;
depressions of appropriate sizes and depths and the adjacent upland&nbsp;
margins of these depressions that sustain Tuctoria mucronata&nbsp;
germination, growth and reproduction, including but not limited to,&nbsp;
Northern Claypan vernal pools (Sawyer and Keeler-Wolf 1995) on saline-
alkaline clay or silty clay in the Pescadero soil series that typically&nbsp;
become inundated during winter rains, but are dry during the summer and&nbsp;
do not necessarily fill with water every year; and
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) The associated watershed(s) and hydrologic features, including&nbsp;
the pool basin, swales, and surrounding uplands (which may vary in&nbsp;
extent depending on pool size and depth, soil type and depth, hardpan&nbsp;
or claypan type and extent, topography, and climate) that contribute to&nbsp;
the filling and drying of the vernal pool or ephemeral wetland, and&nbsp;
that maintain suitable periods of pool inundation, water quality, and&nbsp;
soil moisture for Tuctoria mucronata germination, growth and&nbsp;
reproduction, and dispersal, but not necessarily every year.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) Critical habitat does not include existing manmade features and&nbsp;
structures, such as buildings, roads, aqueducts, railroads, airport&nbsp;
runways and buildings, other paved areas, lawns, and other urban&nbsp;
landscaped areas not containing one or more of the primary constituent&nbsp;
elements.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4) Critical habitat does not include the following lands although&nbsp;
they may fall within the legal descriptions below:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) Lands within the following California counties: Butte, Madera,&nbsp;
Merced, Sacramento, and Solano;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) Federally-owned lands within the boundaries of the Kern,&nbsp;
Sacramento, San Francisco Bay, and San Luis National Wildlife Refuges&nbsp;
and National Wildlife Refuge Complexes, and the Coleman National Fish&nbsp;

Boggs Lake, Butte Creek Canyon, Calhoun Cut, Carrizo Plains, Dales&nbsp;
Lake, Fagan Marsh, Phoenix Field, San Joaquin River, Stone Corral, and&nbsp;
Thomes Creek Ecological Reserves;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iv) State-owned lands within the boundaries of the Battle Creek,&nbsp;
Big Sandy, Grizzly Island, Hill Slough, North Grasslands, and Oroville&nbsp;
Wildlife Areas.
