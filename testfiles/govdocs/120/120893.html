<TH ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3 FACE SIZE=3 FACE=Verdana>From the Medieval to the Modern: A Conversation with Caroline Walker Bynum</TH>
<TR><TD><FONT SIZE=3>
The chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities, William 
R. Ferris, spoke recently with medievalist Caroline Walker Bynum 
about the legacy of the Middle Ages to the modern world. Bynum, 
who has been chosen as the 1999 Jefferson Lecturer in the 
Humanities, is University Professor at Columbia University in New 
York and the author of <I>Holy Feast and Holy Fast</I> and <I>The 
Resurrection of the Body</I>. 
<P>
<B>William R. Ferris:</B> The Middle Ages, which is your scholarly 
world, runs from the fall of the Roman Empire to Renaissance 
humanism.  When we talk about Middle Ages, the question is, what 
does that mean?  Is it a time period or a geographic boundary?  A 
way of thinking?
<P>
<B>Caroline Walker Bynum:</B> I would say that it is fundamentally 
a chronological period, and I would extend it beyond fourteenth-
century humanism, too.
<P>
	We talk about the Middle Ages because the Renaissance 
humanists thought of a middle age that came between them and 
classical antiquity. Most medievalists today put an emphasis on 
the “ages” part -- plural!  Most would say that there are at least 
two middle ages -- an early medieval period that is a preparation 
and then a Middle Age proper running from around 1050 right on 
down to Luther and the Reformation of the sixteenth century.  In 
any case, it is a period or periods in which much of what we think 
of as the Western tradition was formed. 
<P>
<B>Ferris:</B> How has our understanding of the Middle Ages 
changed over the last thirty years?
<P>
<B>Bynum:</B>  Thirty years ago the Middle Ages were seen as 
important because of institutional, political, and constitutional 
developments.  They were seen as the beginning, on a small scale, 
of the modern world.  More recently the Middle Ages, particularly 
the early Middle Ages, have been seen as interesting because they 
are different from the modern world.
<P>
	There has been a shift from looking at institutions, 
politics, and government as the building blocks of much what is 
considered to be typical of the Western tradition, including 
liberalism and constitutional government, to looking at the Middle 
Ages as different and more "primitive."  The shift is marked by 
the use of anthropology rather than political science in the study 
of institutions.  Models from African or Asian history are used to 
understand social and political life rather than those from the 
Anglo-American legal tradition. 
<P>
<B>Ferris:</B>  What are the questions you feel still need to be 
answered about the Middle Ages?
<P>
<B>Bynum:</B>  Almost everything you could think of asking.  There 
is so much material to be explored.  We need to know more about 
the nature of medieval communities on the local level and how they 
functioned.  We still do not understand who joined certain 
religious movements and why.  We do not understand who 
commissioned and paid for many of the devotional and artistic 
objects or many of the important works of literature or art.  
There is even a great deal we do not understand about linguistic 
change.  In some cases we do not actually know what language 
people were communicating in. 
<P>
	Basic questions also remain about cross-cultural contacts and 
exchange.  We still know far too little about relationships 
between Eastern and Western Christendom.  We know far too little 
about cultural borrowings, influences, prejudices and resistance 
in places where Christians were in close contact with Muslims.
<P>
<B>Ferris:</B>  So there is plenty of work to be done.
<P>
<B>Bynum:</B>  There is plenty of work to be done, for both Middle 
Ages.  There are new paradigms to be used.  And for the fourteenth 
and fifteenth centuries there is a tremendous amount of unedited 
material still in manuscripts and still in archives.  The later 
you get, the more material there is that hasn't been published.  
Therefore, in a curious sense, the later you get in time, the more 
there is potentially to know and the less we know of the total 
picture.
<P>
<B>Ferris:</B>  Let me ask you two questions that are connected.  
Why study the Middle Ages, and are there any parallels between the 
Middle Ages that we can draw to modern life?
<P>
<B>Bynum:</B>  Those are big questions.  Why study the Middle 
Ages?  The answer is implicit in the two kinds of paradigms for 
studying it, or approaches to studying it, I just alluded to.  The 
older one, which sees the Middle Ages as the roots of the modern 
world, is still in many ways valid.  We do not actually understand 
modern constitutional government if we do not understand the 
central and later Middle Ages.  Without knowing their medieval 
roots, one cannot understand the whole Anglo-American legal 
tradition, for example, or constitutionalism; one cannot 
understand the modern university, or the modern curriculum. 
<P>
	The other reason is almost the contradiction of that: The 
Middle Ages in many ways is not like the modern world.  I think 
understanding this is just as useful because it gives you a built-
in contrast within your own tradition.  The only way to understand 
yourself or your own society is by seeing how it might be other.  
Where some things are familiar, the differences stand out more 
starkly. 
<P>
<B>Ferris:</B>  Beginning in the 1980s you made a name for 
yourself in medieval history with your works such as <I>Jesus as 
Mother: Studies in the Spirituality of the High Middle Ages</I>, 
and <I>Holy Feast and Holy Fast: The Religious Significance of 
Food to Medieval Women</I>.  Both of these works look at the 
complex relationship between women and religion.  How did you come 
to write these works?
<P>
<B>Bynum:</B>  <I>Jesus as Mother</I> is really more about gender 
than about women.  Much of it is about men's use of female images.  
That project came about because I had been working on monastic 
reform movements in the twelfth century and had noticed that men, 
particularly men who were worried about their exercise of 
authority as religious leaders, tended to use images of themselves 
as women to talk about their anxieties. To some extent they were 
also using feminine issues to talk about God and God's exercise of 
authority.  
<P>
	That led me to wonder how religious women used similar kinds 
of gender images, so I worked on gender images in women's writing.  
What I was basically doing was working on people's self-
conceptions and how gender images relate to their self-
conceptions. And gender images turn out to be very complicated.  
It is not just that women think in female images or men think in 
male images, nor is it the reverse.  
<P>
	Then it occurred to me that beginning with gender images -- 
that is, male and female -- might itself be a prejudicial way of 
asking the question.  Maybe I should just stand back and ask, “Are 
there differences in the images that men and women use to think 
about themselves?” rather than assuming that men and women imagine 
themselves in different ways and express this difference in gender 
images.  In other words, it could be that both men and women used 
maternal -- that is, mothering -- images for God but women might 
think of religious community as a household while men thought of 
it as an army.  Or even this might be too simple.  Once I asked 
the question this way, new areas to explore opened up.
<P>
	I had noticed that food imagery seemed crucial not only to 
women’s writing, but also to their actual religious behavior, in a 
way that was not central to men’s concerns.  That led me to 
<I>Holy Feast and Holy Fast</I>.  The book became an exploration 
of a variety of connected images in women's practices, as well as 
their writing.  I talked about food multiplication miracles, food 
denial, the image of food, the idea of consuming God, and the 
Eucharist.  But the book became more than simply an exploration of 
food practices.  It became as well an exploration of images of the 
body, of physicality, of bodily location, and bodily expression.  
So that is how that came about.  If that makes sense.
<P>
<B>Ferris:</B>  It makes absolute sense.  My wife is doing a study 
of Jewish foods in the South and acculturation.
<P>
<B>Bynum:</B>  There is, of course, a lot of anthropological and 
sociological theory about why food is so important in constituting 
communities.  Excluding from the table is a major way of 
indicating who is the “out” group.  Those you eat with are the 
“in” group.   The sharing of food is a sharing of community and a 
sharing of self.  
<P>
<B>Ferris:</B>  What about these works do you feel captured the 
public's attention, as they clearly did?
<P>
<B>Bynum:</B>  My husband said once that if <I>Jesus as Mother</I> 
had had a different title, it would have sold only a fraction as 
many copies.  I'm sure that is true.
<P>
	The image of God as woman, as mother, although it was only 
one theme in the book, caught people’s attention.  There had been 
in the seventies a hunger on the part of women, particularly 
religious women, to find female images to talk about their 
experience.  As a result, there was some unfortunately simplistic 
discussion of female imagery that assumed women would respond to 
the female and men respond to the male. When one thinks about it, 
that is not very convincing.  We are embodied people with fairly 
strong desires towards our own sex and also toward the other sex 
in complicated ways, regardless of who we are.  I think the book 
managed to make available some beautiful texts from the Western 
tradition that talked about God in feminine as well as masculine 
terms without making the simplistic assumption that men and women 
respond religiously only, or, even primarily, because of their 
gender. 
<P>
<I>Jesus as Mother</I> fed into a discussion about language, 
imagery, and identity that was very important in the culture, both 
among religious people and among scholars.  <I>Holy Feast and Holy 
Fast</I> picked up on some of this.  At the time I wrote it, the 
writings by medieval religious women and the writings about them 
were relatively unknown.  Many of the texts had been edited and 
published, but they had been studied mostly from a philological 
point of view -- as in some cases the first examples we have of a 
particular vernacular language, for example, Old Flemish  -- but 
they hadn't really been studied as women's texts.
<P>
	An enormous amount of that material is now out there in 
English translation.  There are dozens and dozens of undergraduate 
courses in which these texts are now read in the wonderful 
translations that the Paulist Press and others have been 
publishing.  But at the time I wrote <I>Holy Feast and Holy 
Fast</I>, most of this literature was not familiar, even to 
scholars.
<P>
	The other thing that was important was that, insofar as 
people had read these texts, they had noticed how bizarre they 
were from a modern perspective -- bizarre in their intense 
physicality, and eroticism.  On the other hand, some of them are 
bizarre in the tradition of negative theology -- the denial of the 
possibility of speaking about God except in negatives.  Some of 
them are radically antinomian, that is, they reject or violate 
ordinary language, ordinary rules, this kind of thing.   So some 
of these thinkers appear to be heretical.  Indeed, an early 
article that I wrote and submitted to a journal was turned down by 
a reader who said --  
<P>
<B>Ferris:</B>  I know -- that it was heretical.
<P>
<B>Bynum:</B>  “If what Bynum says about these women is right, 
then the women are heretical, and if they are heretical, then we 
shouldn't publish this article.”  That was worrisome.  I think 
<I>Holy Feast and Holy Fast</I> was important because it was not 
afraid to describe the complex characteristics of this 
religiosity.
<P>
	When I gave a lecture in the early eighties before <I>Holy 
Feast and Holy Fast</I> came out, a young scholar came up to me 
afterwards and said, "Everybody knows that that is true, but I 
have never heard anyone say it in public.  How wonderful just to 
have someone say what these texts are really like." That in itself 
was stunning.  I think it is a problem that some people still have 
with the book.  It is more than ten years old, which is a long 
time in current scholarship given how fast things change, and yet 
there are people who still are frightened and disturbed by the 
book.  It is disturbing to some feminists because the women do not 
come out the way they want them to.  It is disturbing to some 
conservatives because the Church doesn't come out the way they 
want it to.  It is deeply disturbing material.  But this, of 
course, also made it attractive.
<P>
<B>Ferris:</B>  Let me ask you about your most recent book, <I>The 
Resurrection of the Body</I>, which looks at how men and women in 
the Middle Ages viewed the relationship between themselves and 
their bodies.  
<P>
<B>Bynum:</B>  In part it is about the relationship to the dead 
body, in part it is about the body that dies and rises again.  It 
has a subtext, if you will, of being about death and dying and the 
way in which people make sense out of that.  But the other, more 
profound way in which it is about the body has to do with issues 
of identity.  It is about how medieval people thought about “Who I 
am.”
<P>
	Identity to a philosopher has at least three meanings.  My 
“identity” can be my personality or what makes me unique.  My 
“identity” can also be what many people today would call my 
“identity position” -- that is, those groups that define me: 
white, middle aged, female, etc.  That would also be who I am.  
But identity has a third meaning as well -- that is,  what 
accounts for my continuity over time and space.  How am I the same 
person that I was when I was five years old?
<P>
	The doctrine of the resurrection of the body in the Middle 
Ages -- people's ways of thinking about what comes back at the end 
of time -- was really a way of thinking about identity in all 
three senses of the word: who I am, what characterizes me, and 
most importantly for the medieval discussion, how one can be the 
same person not only over time, but into eternity.
<P>
What I was looking at was the way in which the doctrine of bodily 
resurrection -- which the Church was, if I can be irreverent, 
stuck with from about 200 A.D. on -- said that your exact body 
will come back at the end of time, even if you are Moses or Isaac 
and have been moldering in the ground for thousands and thousands 
of years.  This is a quite bizarre doctrine, after all.  Yet 
people were stuck with it and not just Christians.  Orthodox Jews 
are stuck with it, too.  It is one of the three core beliefs of 
Rabbinic Judaism.  It is also very important in Islam.  Only the 
three Western religions among the great traditions of the world 
have this notion of the return of the physical self.  This then 
becomes a kind of definition of what it is to be a self -- it 
makes the body crucial to the self in a way that it is not in most 
other cultural traditions.
<P>
	What I was exploring was the way in which that doctrine -- 
and the complicated need to figure out what that doctrine meant -- 
became throughout the Middle Ages a way of thinking about self.  
<P>
<B>Ferris:</B>  Let me ask you a sequential question.  Your work 
has been at the forefront of what is being called body history.  
When a historian says that the body has a history, what does that 
mean?
<P>
<B>Bynum:</B> Of course, them’s fightin' words, in a way.  How far 
you can put an actual physical entity in historical context is a 
very interesting question.  Historians would debate this with 
physiologists and biologists, but I think that there are a number 
of senses in which the body has a history.  
<P>
Conceptualizations of the body have a history.  The Galenic way of 
thinking about the body in the Middle Ages -- that the body is 
basically a set of four humors -- is very different from the way 
of thinking that begins to prevail in the Renaissance with 
Vesalius and others, who think of the body in terms of anatomy and 
organ systems.  If you think of your body as fundamentally humors, 
you are actually thinking of it in a more fluid and complicated 
manner than if you think of it as a skeleton and a bunch of organs 
. 
<P>
	There is a history of the body in the physiological sense as 
well, in that one can study actual physical changes in the body.  
Modern people are taller.  Modern people go through puberty at a 
much younger age.  Modern people are fertile longer.  There are 
basic physical changes that have to do with changes in diet, 
climate, and social situation. Those can also be studied.
<P>
	I also think that -- and this is the most radical and 
problematic thing I have argued -- the way the body behaves may 
change profoundly over time because the body is not simply an 
appendage of the mind, nor a separate thing to which mind or soul 
is attached. The person is a psychosomatic unit.  What we are is a 
complicated and unitary self, so as pressures, society, and ideas 
change, the way in which the body actually performs changes. 
<P>
	I have taken some of the radical behaviors that one can find 
in history -- things like the somatic miracles that are talked 
about in the thirteenth century -- stigmata and trances and 
levitations -- and argued that these may be genuinely new bodily 
behaviors. 
<P>
	I also think that sexuality itself has a history.  Sexual 
response itself may be different in a period in which one of the 
major turn-ons for people's desire is religious experience and 
God.  In other words, basic emotional and erotic responses may 
change over time as much as, say, social structures or economic 
opportunities. 
<P>
<B>Ferris:</B>  You have devoted an enormous amount of time 
exploring the role of women in the Middle Ages, everything from 
saints to mystics to heretics.  What are the common misconceptions 
that we have about medieval women?
<P>
<B>Bynum:</B> The most fundamental misconception among the general 
public is that the Middle Ages was a dark and bleak time 
characterized by rampant misogyny and therefore by an almost 
complete lack of -- to use the  current buzzword -- female  
“agency.”  And also that Christianity was a vast rejection of the 
physical -- that it was a dualistic religion -- and everybody was 
sitting around sticking nails in their hands and flagellating 
themselves.  
<P>
	Now, it is true that there was misogyny in the Middle Ages.  
But it is also true -- just to speak in terms of religious life -- 
that there were significant institutions for women, chief among 
them nunneries, in which they were able to get education, and 
produce religious and theological writing.  And in the high Middle 
Ages, one sees the first significant professional role for single 
women living in the world, not withdrawn from it in cloisters -- 
the Beguines.  Beguines and tertiaries -- sometimes called quasi-
religious -- were single women who lived in women's communities 
and did handicraft or social service.  They thought about 
theology, wrote, taught.  It is significant that these sorts of 
roles, outside marriage and motherhood, were created.
<P>
	Moreover, in towns there were very complicated opportunities 
for women to engage in business, brewing beer, for example, or 
weaving.  There were also within noble families significant 
opportunities for women to manage property, which they could 
inherit.
<P>
	Despite the misogyny, which was rampant, and which in some 
ways got worse in the later Middle Ages, there were clearly women 
who reacted against it. 
<P>
	There is even a sense in which the equation of Woman with The 
Irrational had more complicated effects than most people think.  
The notion that what she was not was rational led to the 
understanding that she could have special access to inspiration, 
both demonic and divine.    In the later Middle Ages there were 
probably more women visionaries than men, and some of them -- for 
example Catherine of Siera or Joan of Arc -- had enormous 
influence.
<P>
	Some of the misconceptions about women in the Middle Ages are 
simply misconceptions about people in the Middle Ages.  My 
students are always saying to me, "Not much happened in the Middle 
Ages, did it?"  Well, it was more than a thousand years.  A lot 
happened.
<P>
<B>Ferris:</B>  One of the refreshing things about your work is 
how interdisciplinary it is.  You draw on religion, art, 
philosophy, literature, and anthropology.  How have these 
approaches shaped the kind of history that you write?
<P>
<B>Bynum:</B>  I came out of graduate school wanting to study the 
history of attitudes -- of what the French would call 
<I>mentalité</I> -- to look not so much at the history of ideas as 
the history of assumptions and conceptions about the world and 
about the self.
<P>
	In the sixties, there was more of this kind of work going on 
in fields such as anthropology.  So it was natural for me to look 
at the work of anthropologists. It was also, given what I wanted 
to do, natural to look for evidence in the literary field, art 
history, the history of philosophy and theology.  
<P>
	So there were really two reasons I was led to be 
interdisciplinary.  One was methodological; I was looking for 
models for how to think.  The other was the evidence.  When I was 
in graduate school, historians were inclined to look at charters, 
at land grants, at legal documents.  I wanted to look at other 
kinds of material.  The history of attitudes and conceptions that 
I wanted to do was really just emerging in the sixties.   I was 
trained in older paradigms that saw only certain kinds of 
questions in philosophy and theology as appropriate for 
intellectual historians.
<P>
<B>Ferris:</B>  In my work as a folklorist, I have used oral 
history as a way of accessing the subjects I work with.  Your 
subjects are certainly long past giving oral histories.  What are 
the sources that you use in your own work?
<P>
<B>Bynum:</B>  I work generally with devotional, theological, and 
philosophical texts, but I don’t use them to do doctrinal history.  
Instead I read them for their assumptions, their contradictions, 
the things they don’t quite say.  I have also worked on saints' 
lives, which are a very, very rich source for the Middle Ages.  
Some saints' lives actually do include material that is almost 
folkloric. 
<P>
	Recently, I have also been looking at what we can call 
literature of entertainment -- the things people in the high 
Middle Ages wrote about the marvels of the world, travel 
literature, chronicles, and collections of miracles and ghost 
stories. I have been trying to use such materials to explore my 
new topic -- marvels and monsters -- which is really a way of 
examining how people drew the line between self and other, in-
group and out-group.  
<P>
I also use art historical material, mostly iconographically.  If I 
look at a doctrine such as the Immaculate Conception or the 
Fatherhood of God, for example, I'm interested in why in certain 
periods God is a man with a long white beard and in other periods 
God is a hand that comes down from the sky.
<P>
	Or, if we look at depictions of the Immaculate Conception, 
why is it often presented as a grandmother and a daughter, as Ann 
and Mary?  I think such depictions tell us about more than just 
the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception; surely we see something 
here about social structure as well.
<P>
	But really it is above all texts -- the text <I>qua</I> text 
-- that I work on.  I'm not interested in running around and 
getting tidbits from a lot of different sources.  I like to read 
the texts in their own complexity and in their fullness.  I do 
not, in other words, want to say, “Let's look at women.  Here is a 
mother and there is a daughter, and let's pull them all together 
and say, ‘Ah, this gives us a picture of women in such-and-such a 
century.’”
<P>
	I want to look at the text and say, “What is the author 
doing?  How is this text working?  How does it move?  How does 
this argument contradict an earlier one?  Is there an assumption 
here that seems to be fallacious, that seems to be paradoxical, 
that seems to be a slippage from what the person was saying in an 
earlier part?”
<P>
	So, although I do not think it is easy to figure out what 
people mean and I know it is <I>impossible</I> to figure out what 
people intend, I think it is dangerous just to take things out of 
a lot of different texts and string them together and say, “Ah ha, 
here we've got the 1220s.”  I really, really try to treat the text 
and the voices in them as a whole before I move to other texts and 
voices.  So I stay pretty close to the text, and I work more 
slowly in getting from text to text than some people do.
<P>
<B>Ferris:</B>  In <I>Fragmentation and Redemption</I>, more than 
a fourth of the book is footnotes.   I do not know if that is a 
medieval quality that I share, but I'm always drawn to read the 
footnotes before the book in some ways because they contain such 
interesting material.  I felt that in your work, the footnotes 
were as revealing as the text itself.
<P>
<B>Bynum:</B>  A lot of people say that about my books.  Some 
people even prefer the ones that have the footnotes in the back 
because they say, "We can just flip to the back and read the 
footnotes.  We do not have to read the text.  We can imagine any 
kind of text on top of it.  We just like to read the notes."
<P>
<B>Ferris:</B>  It is in some ways revealing about the diversity 
of your interests.  I found that a fascinating dimension.  
<P>
<B>Bynum:</B> I love to find little nuggets in other people's 
footnotes, so I never feel hesitant about burying some nuggets in 
mine.
<P>
	But the footnote is also a fundamental commitment.  I do not 
really have a post-modern sense that history is all construction 
or that it is all opinion.  The footnote is the proof -- not that 
you’ve got it right necessarily, but that you got it from 
someplace.
<P>
	I know how hard it is to find the past, and I know that you 
never get back to the past.  Historians have always known that.  
What do we find when we dig into the past?  We find a trace or 
vestige conveyed to us in a text or an artifact.  We do not find 
the past.
<P>
	Nonetheless, if we do not take it as our fundamental 
obligation to be true to something other than ourselves -- to 
voices from the past, to the texts, the pictures, the landscape -- 
why be historians?  We could be novelists or something else.
<P>
<B>Ferris:</B>  Exactly.
<P>
<B>Bynum:</B>  So what’s in the footnote is the voice in the text 
and my doubts about whether I have heard the voice correctly -- my 
doubts about whether the voice is the voice of the author or the 
voice of what the author is recording -- and all my efforts to 
quarrel with that, to work with that, to explore that.   What you 
put in your footnotes is your bona fides, your indication to other 
people of how they can go and check up on you.  But it is not just 
for the other historians or for the reviewers.  It is for the 
people in the past themselves; they, ultimately, are what you put 
in the footnotes; it is to <I>them</I> that you owe the obligation 
to get it right -- as right as you can.
<P>
<B>Ferris:</B>  Let me switch gears a little here and ask what 
originally drew you to the study of history and, more 
specifically, to the study of the Middle Ages?
<P>
<B>Bynum:</B>  I am a Southerner, and I think Southerners tend to 
be more interested in history than people in the rest of the 
country, not just as an interest, but as a living memory.  We feel 
more than the rest of the country a certain guilt about our past.  
I think that a Southerner has a complicated relationship to a past 
as both self and other.   Southerners are drawn to the Middle Ages 
as a period that is both the root of some modern things and “other 
than” modern things; also it is a complicated legacy that is not 
all “good.”  And then I, having been raised in a family in which 
religion was central, was drawn also to the period in Western 
history in which religion was important and problematic.  Religion 
was a defining aspect of my life when I grew up, but not an 
entirely liberating one.  A continuing and deep and serious 
quarrel with religion shaped me, and it was of course a quarrel 
with a particular kind of religion because I was raised as an 
Episcopalian, in a liturgical tradition.
<P>
	It is hard to even know at what point the Middle Ages began 
to fascinate me.  I have memories of being fascinated by medieval 
pictures and by medieval stories, by medieval legends, you know, 
from very early years.  When I was in the tenth grade, a friend of 
mine and I wrote a long -- it must have been ghastly -- historical 
novel about a little girl who went on the Children’s Crusade.  We 
were involved for a number of months in writing and illustrating 
this historical novel.
<P>
	And then in college I had some wonderful teaching.  Charles 
Taylor at Harvard taught my introductory social sciences courses -
- a very traditional kind of Western Civ. But he was a 
medievalist, and he did a wonderful job with medieval ideas.  It 
was really as a result of that that I decided that I wanted to 
work on the Middle Ages.
<P>
	I probably knew that I wanted to study the Middle Ages long 
before I knew that doing it as a historian was going to be the 
particular disciplinary route.
<P>
	I think also, finally, that it wasn't just that history and 
religious history enabled me to explore things about my Southern 
past.  I also wanted to quarrel with certain ways in which my 
religious upbringing was doctrinaire.  The sort of Episcopalianism 
I was raised in combined many of the most severe aspects of 
Catholicism and Protestantism.  It was a tremendous burden on a 
young woman who wanted to fight free of certain other basically 
Southern assumptions about what she should do with her life, that 
is, grow up, get married, and have kids.
<P>
	I clearly wanted to do something else.  And I felt 
constrained by many of the assumptions, I’d been reared with, but 
they had been too important in shaping me for me simply to discard 
them.  I needed to fight with them.  And the way in which you 
fight with something that is doctrinaire is to put it in context.
<P>
	So the wonderful thing about history was that it enabled me 
to understand that what I had inherited was the product of a 
particular time and place.  I didn't have to throw it all out.  I 
could continue to live with it and think about it; indeed, I  
could spend the rest of my life thinking about religion, and 
thinking about society, and thinking about women's roles.
<P>
	I could say to my parents, “Oh, it is not that you tell me 
this because it is true.  You tell me this because you have a 
particular situation in the world.  I can explain you.”  It gave 
me a very powerful weapon against an upbringing which had been 
filled with absolutes -- Thou Shalt Nots of all sorts -- without 
throwing them out. Because it wasn't that I felt that all the Thou 
Shalt Nots that I'd been told were wrong; it is just that I needed 
to be able to work with them, to change some of them, to make 
others my own.
<P>
	So I think history is a wonderful tool for contextualizing, 
working with, rejecting part of your world without throwing out 
the whole tradition from which you come.
<P>
<B>Ferris:</B>  We are having more and more conversations about 
the role and responsibility of a historian to interact with the 
public, to share his or her work outside the academy, which in 
part is a mission we have here at the Endowment and that our State 
Humanities Councils share.  Can you talk about the relationship of 
the historian in the academy with the public?
<P>
<B>Bynum:</B>  Sure.  There are two important needs for 
interaction between historians in the academy and the wider 
public.
<P>
	The first is simply the crying need for all of us who teach 
at the college level to be more involved in secondary education.  
There is a crisis in secondary education in this country.  All of 
us have an obligation to work much more actively with people in 
high schools than we do.
<P>
	We all have an obligation to join the associations for the 
teaching of history, to do workshops in high schools, and to talk 
about how we can get our expectations of college study to dovetail 
better with the training that is going on in the high schools.  
The high schools are bearing a tremendous burden these days, and 
they are not in many cases doing very well with it.  We must 
ourselves pay more attention to some of the problems that they are 
facing.
<P>
	For a long time, I have had an approach to my time that I 
have thought of as something like tithing.  So instead of always 
saying yes to Harvard and Chicago and Berkeley, I try to say yes 
to, for example, the Death and the Dying Project in Minnesota, or 
to a local community college, or a high school History Day.  
Sometimes I give the honorarium back or donate it to the local 
scholarship fund.
<P>
	The second aspect of increasing the interaction between 
historians and the community is that I think that the teaching of 
European history generally needs to change, both at the high 
school and at the college level.  The buzzword -- globalization -- 
that everybody uses is in fact right.   
<P>
	I have students at Columbia from all over the world.  Even 
when they have been born in this country, they represent a far 
wider variety of cultural, religious, social traditions than they 
did in colleges and universities twenty-five years ago.  We cannot 
continue to teach the Western tradition simply as the roots of 
ourselves.  We need to work out ways of presenting the history of 
Europe much more as area studies, the way we present Southeast 
Asian area studies, or Latin American area studies.
<P>
	We cannot assume that students today understand the basic 
terminology -- whether it is "parliament" or "priest" or 
"sacrament.”  They do not know the map of Europe.  We cannot 
assume that the things we refer to when we are using a paradigm 
from European history -- such as aristocracy or feudalism -- are 
things that our students are familiar with.
<P>
	Although as a medievalist I know much less about it, I would 
suggest that the teaching of American history needs to be 
globalized, too.  Obviously the Second World War looks far 
different from a global perspective than it does from an American 
one.  And I think one would learn a great deal by putting it in a 
larger setting.
<P>
	But we are just beginning to think about how to do this and 
what materials to use.  Globalization doesn't mean giving up the 
teaching of European history.   We should continue to teach 
Europe, but we have to do it from a different point of view, and 
we have to do it in conjunction with some re-examination of the 
relationship between college and secondary school education.
<P>
	Those are ways in which people in my part of the academy need 
to think beyond the academy.
<P>
<B>Ferris:</B>  You deal wonderfully with art as a historian.  
Could you talk about the importance of images, photographs, works 
of art for the historian?
<P>
<B>Bynum:</B>  Art is a wonderful primary source from my period, 
although we can never know exactly what people thought when they 
saw it.  Nonetheless, art is one of the ways in which you are in 
the same world with people who were not literate.  It puts you 
into the world of the stories that shaped their lives in a way 
that the written text may never do, unless the written texts 
record folk material, which is relatively rare.
<P>
	I also use archeology and photographs in my teaching.  It 
might seem odd because, of course, you cannot have a photograph of 
the fifteenth century.  But I have, for example, sometimes shown 
my students just the landscape in Burgundy.   I have shots that I 
took that avoid modern superhighways and power lines, so that the 
students can see the way in which dozens of hills and small 
mountains shape the countryside.  Then they can understand 
something like feudalism and how with a castle on a hill you could 
dominate the surrounding countryside in a way that you wouldn't do 
in a place that was completely flat.
<P>
	Or I show them a photograph of the fen country in England and 
they understand what back-breaking work it was to drain that area 
and what it agriculturally.
<P>
	Aerial photography can be wonderful for the Middle Ages 
because we can see sometimes where the Roman villas were and where 
the roads were.  From something that was there two thousand years 
ago, a vestige remains. It can give you an almost magic feeling of 
being back in the period.
<P>
	It is also true that today's students in general read and 
write with a little less ease than students did twenty-five years 
ago.  They respond to the visual, and therefore the visual can be 
a way of drawing them in and getting them to ask questions, simply 
by showing them a photograph and saying, “How do you imagine you 
might live in this sort of landscape?"
<P>
<B>Ferris:</B>  Let me carry this a little further.  I was 
fascinated that in your essay, “Continuity, Survival, and 
Resurrection” from your book <I>Fragmentation and Redemption</I>, 
you used twentieth century popular culture.
<P>
	There is a cover of <I>Weekly World News</I> with the 
painting of Elvis weeping real tears.  And you also talk about the 
<I>Invasion of the Body Snatchers</I> and <I>The Fly</I> in trying 
to evoke the relationships to the medieval period.  Can you talk 
about this idea of things enduring no matter what age or what 
level of culture?
<P>
<B>Bynum:</B>  The kinds of issues I was trying to explore in 
<I>The Resurrection of the Body</I> -- questions about identity 
and what it means to be embodied -- are very, very pressing 
questions at the end of the twentieth century.  I find that one of 
the best ways to get students to think about complicated 
philosophical and theological issues is to talk about, for 
example, a <I>Star Trek</I> episode.
<P>
	<I>Star Trek</I> is a tremendously sophisticated examination 
of some of the kinds of problems that present-day philosophers of 
mind are engaged in exploring.  It raises questions about identity 
as sophisticated as those of the philosopher Bernard Williams or 
Robert Nozick. 
<P>
	Students get confused reading Bernard Williams and say, “Oh, 
I think this is just silly.  Who would ever transplant a brain?”  
It tends to seem dry and academic, and they think this is a bunch 
of effete intellectuals worrying about odd things.  Whereas, if 
you've got a <I>Star Trek</I> episode or a movie to talk about, 
they've seen it, they've been excited by it.  And then you can 
say, “But what is it that is so puzzling about this?  Why is it 
that you are unsure about the identity of this character?  What 
might it mean, therefore, to ask about identity?”
<P>
	Suddenly they are talking about things that are very 
disturbing to them.  That is, of course, the way to get people 
into thinking about issues from the past.  They realize that there 
is something that disturbs them as modern people, and that people 
in the past were disturbed by the same kinds of problems.
<P>
	Today's students, I think, are in some ways afraid to engage 
with hard questions, in part because of the intensely political 
environment in which they live. Because they are so different from 
each other, they are very much afraid of saying something that is 
politically incorrect.  They do not want to hurt someone who comes 
from a very different place culturally.  They do not want to say 
something that is insensitive to Islam, for example.  They do not 
want to say something that is insensitive to the Midwest.  
Therefore they are hesitant to speak up.  They are not as 
argumentative and forthright as young people were twenty-five 
years ago, when students were actually much more the same and 
therefore much more willing to get in there and scrap.
<P>
	The real challenge for the teacher is to get students to see 
that ideas matter so profoundly that they have got to explore 
them, they have got to disagree about them.  It matters too much.  
You cannot teach if everybody is just sitting around saying it is 
all a matter of opinion.  It is not all a matter of opinion.  We 
are living beings who have to think about who we are.  If we do 
not explore who we are, life is going to be over, and we will 
never have engaged with it.
<P>
<B>Ferris:</B>  That is right.
<P>
<B>Bynum:</B>  So the real struggle is to get students to see it 
is not all a matter of opinion.  There are good ideas and bad 
ideas.  There is right and wrong.  It matters, and they, as some 
of the most privileged people in the world today, have an 
obligation to engage with these issues.
<P>
	How do you get students to understand that it matters?  You 
have to have something that comes close enough to them that they 
can talk about it and yet that can be distanced in some way.
<P>
	Popular culture is wonderful.  All these movies about people 
going to heaven or turning into flies or traveling in space -- it 
is far enough away from them that you can get them to engage, and 
suddenly they are talking about diversity, about selfhood, about 
values.
<P>
	And then you can come back and say, “But look, Hobbes is 
talking about the nature of society.  Thomas Aquinas is talking 
about identity.  Descartes is talking about whether or not 
thinking is enough to let you know who you are.  These things 
matter.”
<P>
	If you can get the students to see that it is okay for them 
to argue and disagree and to believe in the things that they 
believe in, then you've taken a step forward.  And popular culture 
is one of the ways of getting them going on this.
<P>
<B>Ferris:</B>  Let me close with one final question.  What do you 
see as the future of the field of history?
<P>
<B>Bynum:</B>  I think that history is going to continue to be 
central to the humanities.  Whether it’s music or art or 
literature or philosophy, scholars are going to continue to 
understand it in its historical context -- its situation in time 
and place.  Some of the post-modern attack, which would seem to 
make the writing of history impossible, has faded slightly. And 
from what has been good about post-modern questioning, we have 
profited.
<P>
	That is, we've learned to be more careful and more sensitive 
to the way in which we are always constructing and always 
reflecting ourselves. That has been useful.
<P>
	But I think the danger of four or five years ago -- that we 
might actually succumb to either a narcissism that says, “We 
cannot really do history, therefore we might as well write about 
ourselves,” or to a kind of relativism, which proposes that 
nothing is there -- I think that danger is past.
<P>
	There is new material to be found, but even if there were 
not, there is always history to be written.  I cannot see how 
there can be any humanities without history at the center.
<P>
	I think that history is going to continue to be absolutely 
crucial not only to people who study politics and institutions, 
but to people who study literature and art and philosophy as well.
<P>
<B>Ferris:</B>  That is wonderful. I cannot tell you how much I 
appreciate your taking this time.
<P>
<B>Bynum:</B>  Well, thank you very much. I have enjoyed talking 
with you, too.
