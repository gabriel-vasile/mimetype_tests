<P>
In the introduction to her book, <I>Fragmentation and 
Redemption</I>, medievalist Caroline Walker Bynum writes:  " 
I argue . . . that the writing of history must come to terms 
gracefully with the incomplete, that it must be a 
conversation open to new voices, that its essential mode is 
a comic one."
<P>
	Bynum is this year's Jefferson Lecturer in the 
Humanities, the highest honor the federal government 
bestows.  She has been teaching for the past decade at 
Columbia University in New York, where she holds the rank of 
University Professor.  
<P>
	In her classrooms at Columbia, Bynum willingly risks 
the unorthodox.  Discussion can turn to <I>Star Trek</I> or 
<I>Invasion of the Body Snatchers</I> as easily as to 
Aquinas as she and her students explore the philosophical 
and theological underpinnings of the Middle Ages.  Modern-
day "body-hopping" in movies and television -- in which 
people inhabit other bodies or bargain with Death -- to 
Bynum's way of thinking can offer a flash of identification 
across the centuries.  It is not to draw parallels, she 
cautions, but to begin to get a glimmering of what the 
questions might be.
<P>
 Bynum has written a number of books, among them 
<I>Jesus as Mother, Holy Feast and Holy Fast</I>, and her 
most recent, <I>The Resurrection of the Body in Western 
Christianity</I>.   "Her meticulous and imaginative 
exploration of the texts and artworks that have come down to 
us from these centuries has changed the way scholars, 
students, and general readers alike understand the age," 
says Martha Howell, the head of Columbia's history 
department.
<P>
	The age stretches a thousand years, give or take a 
century or two, from the fall of the Roman Empire to the 
Renaissance. It wears no easy label.  It was a time of the 
building of cathedrals, of the copying of manuscripts, of 
inventions like the windmill and the mechanical clock, of 
quarrels over the rule of law and theologies.  A Florentine 
named Dante wondered over the whole of life and afterlife in 
an epic called <I>The Divine Comedy</I>; a century later a 
diplomat-turned-writer named Chaucer looked on the vagaries 
of humanity in a more earthly way in a work called <I>The 
Canterbury Tales</I>.  It was a time in which a young man of 
Assisi, whose father was a woolen merchant, found sainthood, 
and a red-bearded German emperor, Frederick Barbarossa, 
ravaged the cities of Italy, and a scientist named Roger 
Bacon dreamed of machines that could fly. 
<P>
In this issue of <I>Humanities</I> we travel back to a 
little-visited corner of the early Middle Ages, a place 
called Thingvellir in Iceland, where a thousand years ago 
feuding chieftains learned to settle their disputes without 
bloodshed at the <I>Althing</I>.  Scholar Jesse L. Byock 
calls their society a "proto-democracy."  We also visit the 
murky and mythic world of <I>Beowulf</I> -- not just Beowulf 
himself but how the manuscript has come down to us -- lost 
for five hundred years, found again, damaged in a 1731 fire, 
pieced together by scholars.  We now have a newer version, 
this one done by Kevin Kiernan and his colleagues at the 
University of Kentucky, who have used fiber optics and 
ultraviolet light to recover obscured passages and to 
correct miswritings.  The Electronic <I>Beowulf</I> Project 
is attracting young students as well as scholars, says 
Kiernan.  "They think it is so 'cool' that these pictures 
are on the Internet.  And I hear from high school teachers, 
too."
<P>
The casual and questing style sounds a little like 
Bynum herself.  In <I>Fragmentation</I>, she goes on to say:  
"I suggest that the pleasure we find in research and in 
storytelling about the past is enhanced both by awareness 
that our own voices are provisional and by confidence in the 
revisions the future will bring. . . . I dedicate this 
volume to my students.  May they find that the comedy of 
history welcomes them, both as actors and as authors."
