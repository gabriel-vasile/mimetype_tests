<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>To children and lovers of fairy tales, the <cite>Chronicles of Narnia,</cite> 
  by the prolific British novelist, medievalist, poet, and literary critic, C.S. 
  Lewis, are stories of a magical land called Narnia, where animals behave as 
  equals with humans, witches wage war, and dragons and horses fly overhead. It 
  is a land where hunting parties ride seahorses and silver apples can restore 
  health. To readers searching for more than a fairy tale of an imaginary world, 
  the <cite>Chronicles of Narnia</cite> may also be seen as a Christian allegory 
  with Aslan, the talking lion, as a Christ figure. The destruction of Narnia 
  has been compared to the Apocalypse. In addition to the fairy tale and Christian 
  elements, the <cite>Chronicles of Narnia</cite> also reflect events of Lewis's 
  own life. The Pevensie children were evacuated to Professor Kirk's house just 
  as four children were at one time evacuated to Lewis's house. Lewis owned wardrobes 
  similar to the one described in <cite>The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.</cite> 
  The professor's house that the children explore is similar to Lewis's childhood 
  home. </p>
<p>NLS has recorded the series as a single book, as listed below. Following that
  is a list of the individual titles of the seven <cite>Chronicles
    of Narnia</cite> in
  chronological order of their contents as given in <cite>C.S. Lewis</cite>,
  by Margaret Patterson Hannay. This order differs considerably from the order
  in which the books were written or published, but is the one in which Lewis
  scholars understand he intended for them to be read.</p>
