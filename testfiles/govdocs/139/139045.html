               INTERNATIONAL SWEEP TARGETS REPTILE
SMUGGLERS</h2>

Suspected smugglers of various reptiles, including the frilled
dragon, were served search warrants today by special agents of
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.  The warrants were issued as
part of an international investigation involving reptiles illegally
imported from Indonesia, Australia, the Netherlands, and other
countries. 
<p>
The investigation into reptile smuggling in the United States
was initiated by a request for assistance from the Netherlands
Ministry of Justice; Netherlands National Police; and
Netherlands Ministry of Agriculture, Nature Conservation, and
Fisheries.
<p>
Federal search warrants were executed in New York, Florida,
North Carolina, and New Mexico in coordination with other
warrants executed at businesses and residences in Indonesia and
the Netherlands.  Officials from the Netherlands uncovered the
elaborate smuggling scheme involving live reptiles, including
the frilled dragon (Chlamydosaurus kingii), shipped out of
Indonesia, into the Netherlands, and then on to other European
countries and the United States.
<p>
The United States is the world's largest importer of wildlife and
in recent years the demand for live reptiles as collectibles and
exotic pets has increased rapidly.  The various species of reptiles
involved in the investigation are highly prized by collectors in
Europe, Japan, and the United States.  
<p>
Frilled dragons, certain Australian and Indonesian skinks,
pythons, and some unique turtles, all species of concern in this
smuggling investigation, may sell in the United States for $250
to $1,500 each.  These animals are protected by law in their
countries of origin and their export is tightly controlled. 
Although some of these species can be bred in captivity, the
high level of demand by reptile collectors often encourages
smuggling of wild-caught specimens.
<p>
The frilled dragon, used as a model for &quot;Jurassic Park's&quot; spitting
dinosaur, is a non-venomous, 18-inch-long lizard native to
Indonesia and Australia.  This reptile is particularly striking
when it becomes excited and opens a scaly fold of skin
surrounding its head.  The lizard is also remarkable for standing
upright and running on its hind legs.
<p>
The Netherlands Police began their investigation into the illegal
trafficking of protected reptiles from Indonesia in September
1994.  They gathered information for more than a year before
initiating an official request for assistance through international
channels to the U.S. Department of Justice.  Through an
agreement with the Kingdom of the Netherlands, known as the
Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty, the United States and the
Netherlands provide a broad range of cooperation with each
other in criminal matters.  Special agents of the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service were chosen to assist the Department of Justice
because of their expertise in wildlife import, export, smuggling,
and illegal commercialization offenses.
<p>
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Netherlands and
Indonesian authorities continue to investigate illegal trade in
reptiles.  Reptile smugglers in the United States face possible
Federal conspiracy, smuggling, false statement, and money
laundering charges.  The investigations in the United States are
being coordinated by the United States Attorney's Offices in
Miami, Florida; New York, New York; Greensboro, North
Carolina; and Albuquerque, New Mexico, with support from
attorneys in the Wildlife and Marine Resources Section of the
Environment and Natural Resources Division of the United
States Department of Justice.
