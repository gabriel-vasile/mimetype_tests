          &#147;I think that the pull, the attraction of history, is in our human 
          nature,&#148; writer David McCullough says. &#147;What makes us tick? 
          Why do we do what we do?&#148;</font></p>
        <p><FONT SIZE=3>In this issue of <i>Humanities</i> he talks with NEH Chairman 
          Bruce Cole about the art of history as storytelling. McCullough, whose 
          book John Adams recently won the Pulitzer Prize, warns against the misperceptions 
          that can arise when delving into another time. He mentions Adams and 
          his colleagues of the eighteenth century: &#147;We see them in paintings 
          in their frilled shirts and their satin pants and the powdered hair 
          and they look like fops. They look like softies. Nothing doing. They 
          were tough. And life was tough.&#148; Nobody, he reminds us, has ever 
          lived in the past. For them it is<br>
          the present, and no one knows how it will turn out.</font></p>
        <p><FONT SIZE=3>From our own fledgling democracy, we travel further back 
          to a different world: the realm of the Medicis. Our journey begins in 
          the darkness of Florence at the time of the plague and emerges in the 
          glories of Michelangelo&#146;s Renaissance. The values and ideas of 
          Italian society are illuminated in unexpected ways by the storytellers 
          of the Decameron and the gossips of the Medici court. The thousands 
          of letters in the Medici archives tell us about much more than governing: 
          a delicious note from Duke Cosimo tsk-tsks the reputation the family 
          has for poisoning its rivals. &#147;In regard to that man who offered 
          to poison Piero Strozzi&#146;s water or wine, impelling you to send 
          a courier here to obtain a recipe from us, we inform you that we have 
          never looked into such matters nor authorized others to do so.&#148; 
          Adds the duke, &#147;we find such matters excessively horrid.&#148;</font></p>
        <p><FONT SIZE=3>For the Medicis, the appearance of power was as important 
          as the exercise of it. They built chapels; their palazzos filled with 
          decorative art; their cardinals and popes were memorialized in Michelangelo&#146;s 
          sculptures. And the family thrived for two hundred years. Their plans 
          were on a grand scale and some went unfinished, but they left a cultural 
          inheritance to the next generation of Florentines and much of the Western 
          world.</font></p>
        <p><FONT SIZE=3>The links between a society&#146;s values and its culture 
          have been debated in the centuries since. In this issue, we examine 
          the fabric of our own culture by honoring some exemplary people of today.</font></p>
        <p><FONT SIZE=3>We profile seven people and an institution that have added 
          to the richness of present-day America. They are the winners of the 
          2001 National Humanities Medal, which is awarded for work in the public 
          humanities. They include a doctor who applies the humanities to psychiatry 
          and law, an advocate for literacy, an artist who captures history in 
          pen and ink, a biographer of twentieth-century heroes, a chronicler 
          of our vanities, an author of young adult books, a scholar of African 
          American music, and last, an institution, the National Trust for Historic 
          Preservation, which is committed to protecting the irreplaceable buildings 
          and spaces in our lives. </font></p>
