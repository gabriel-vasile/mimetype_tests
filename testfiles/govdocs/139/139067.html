        <img src="images/imelda.jpeg" alt="a photo of Imelda"> 
        <h3> Group Leader of the Test Engineering Group</h3>
      </center>
      <h4 align="center" class="body"><a href="#archives">Chat Archives</a></h4>
      <p><b><span class="body">Who I Am</span></b> <span class="body"><br>
        My job is very exciting. I work for the Thermophysics Facilities Branch. 
        This branch operates test facilities which are very much like high temperature 
        wind tunnels, called "arc jets". The arc jets are used to test heatshield 
        materials which protect spacecraft from the extreme heat that they encounter 
        when they enter the atmosphere of a planet. Our facilities were used extensively 
        for Space Shuttle testing and in developing the tiles for the Space Shuttle. 
        </span> 
      <p><span class="body"> My official job title is Aerospace Engineer, but 
        I think just about everyone at the Center is an Aerospace Engineer, so 
        the title doesn't really say much about what I do. On our organizational 
        charts, I'm listed as Group Leader of the Test Engineering Group. This 
        is a pretty neat title and the job that goes along with it is also pretty 
        neat, except for the fact that the group consists of one person in addition 
        to me. Since the group is so small, most of my job falls under test engineering. 
        </span> 
      <p><span class="body"> As the group leader, I'm responsible for scheduling 
        tests in our test facilities and for making sure that the tests get done 
        in a timely manner. This means that when one test is running over, or 
        something breaks down, I need to work with all of our customers to see 
        how we can move things around to make sure everyone gets all of their 
        tests done. I also work with our customers to help them plan their tests. 
        </span> 
      <p><span class="body"> As a test engineer, I'm responsible for getting individual 
        tests done. The test program consists of individual "runs". I tell the 
        facility operators what settings to use for each run to obtain the conditions 
        that the customer wants -- in effect, I'm back-seat driving. After the 
        run is done, I check the data to make sure there are no errors. After 
        I verify that the data is ok, I pass it on to the customers for them to 
        analyze. Then, I start on the next run. At the completion of the test, 
        I prepare a post-test report and move on to the next test program. </span> 
      <p> <span class="body"><b>My Career Path</b><br>
        I decided I wanted to become an aerospace engineer some time during high 
        school. I don't remember when, but when I was applying to college, I was 
        looking at colleges with aerospace majors. I didn't really prepare for 
        a specific career until I got to college -- at this point, I just followed 
        the prescribed curriculum for my chosen major. During high school, I took 
        the classes that were required for admission to the University of California 
        system with no particular goal in mind. During high school, my main goal 
        was to graduate so that I could go to college. I liked school and academics, 
        so I took all of the college-prep classes I could take. My electives consisted 
        of classes like Advanced Placement Biology. I enjoyed taking the hardest 
        classes available to me because I really got a lot out of them. This turned 
        out pretty well, because even though I didn't really have a specific goal 
        in mind, I was well-prepared to study for just about anything. </span> 
      <p> <span class="body"><b>Why I like my Job</b><br>
        My job is never boring. This is both good an bad. The good part is that 
        my job is really fun most of the time. I work with very good people and 
        we work as a "team", so we're pretty close. </span> 
      <p><span class="body"> Sometimes, however, my job is not boring because 
        we're having to deal with some sort of crisis. This is the kind of excitement 
        I could do without. Most of our crises arise because of failures in our 
        equipment. Most of our equipment is very old and our group does a really 
        good job of keeping it running. However, every once in a while something 
        fails. This usually happens in the middle of some critical test, so we 
        have to find some way of making sure that we are able to complete the 
        test. Luckily, our staff is very dedicated: they are here to do the job 
        and they take pride in doing their job, so they are usually willing to 
        do whatever it takes to finish the job - sometimes this means coming in 
        to work at 4:30 am, or staying until midnight. If it weren't for our great 
        crew, my job would be very difficult. </span> 
      <p> <span class="body"><b>Advice</b><br>
        I don't think you can really prepare for a career. Of course, you have 
        to go to school and take all the right classes (math, science), but most 
        of what you need for your career will be learned on the job. The schoolwork 
        will give you a good foundation, but I don't think you can expect to come 
        to work right after school and immediately solve NASA's problems. </span> 
      <p><span class="body"> A lot of the time we may think that because we went 
        to a good school and got good grades we're going to be God's gift to the 
        world of Aeronautics. However, there's still a lot to be learned after 
        we get out of school. </span> 
      <p><span class="body"> Random thought: One of my mentors used to like to 
        tell me and other colleagues who were close in age that some of the great 
        thinkers of our time (Shroedinger and others) had made their great discoveries 
        by the time they were our age. </span> 
      <p><span class="body"><b>Early Influences</b><br>
        My mother, of course, was very supportive and she never pushed me to go 
        into one field or another (I think she probably would have like me to 
        become a doctor, but medical stuff grosses me out). So, it was nice to 
        go through school knowing that I could do whatever I wanted with my education. 
        </span> 
      <p><span class="body"> My high school counselor was also very influential 
        and I give her a lot of credit for where I ended up. She encouraged me 
        to apply to the schools I wanted to even if I didn't think I'd be going 
        there for one reason or another. If it hadn't been for her, I might not 
        have applied and gone to Stanford. </span> 
      <p><span class="body"> Finally, I think it was a Marines recruiter that 
        was responsible for me choosing aeronautical engineering. I was talking 
        to him about joining the Marines to become a pilot. He pretty much told 
        me that there was no way I'd become a pilot in the Military (my eyesight 
        wasn't good enough and they didn't allow women pilots, except maybe for 
        helicopters, at the time); I could probably become a commercial pilot, 
        though. Since I couldn't become a pilot, I looked for something else that 
        was related to aviation. Since I was pretty good at math and science, 
        I settled on aeronautical engineering - or maybe I was already considering 
        aeronautical engineering to supplement my flying career??? </span> 
      <p> <span class="body"><b>Personal</b><br>
        I love wildlife: I especially love the cute, furry animals, like baby 
        polar bears. One of my favorite TV shows is the "tale of twin polar bears" 
        that shows up on PBS every-so-often - I would pay to have an experience 
        like that - or simply to be able to hold a baby polar bear. I think it's 
        a cruel trick of nature that the cutest animals are also among the fiercest. 
        I'm also very fond of the less-cute animals: I love crocodiles, alligators, 
        and other reptiles - amongst my favorites are the frilled lizards. I love 
        watching wildlife shows on Animal Planet. I don't own any exotic animals, 
        though, but I do have a little love bird who likes to pretend not to like 
        me. </span> 
      <p><span class="body"> I also love to sew. I make most of my clothes because 
        that way I can fit them to my likes and I can use the materials that I 
        want. I like to use natural (like cotton and silk) and high-tech (microfiber) 
        materials. I like to support industries that care about our environment, 
        that's why I made a fake-fur coat for myself. Not that our weather really 
        warrants heavy coats, but because I wanted to make a statement that we 
        don't need real animal furs to have luxurious coats. Unfortunately, with 
        our weather, I don't get to wear it much. I would love to see fake fur 
        replace real-fur products. It's very difficult to find ready-made eco-friendly 
        clothing. I am looking into buying organic cotton cloth, but that is very 
        difficult to find - I love natural, undyed cotton - it just doesn't compare 
        to the over-processed cotton that is readily available.</span>
