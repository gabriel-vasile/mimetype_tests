<H3> <A NAME="design-cent"><hr>design-cent-*</A> </H3>
Design centering problem cast as an MPEC, from an idea by
O. Stein and G. Still, "Solving semi-infinite optimization 
problems with Interior Point techniques", Lehrstuhl C fuer 
Mathematik, Rheinisch Westfaelische Technische Hochschule,
Preprint No. 96, November 2001.

<br>
Maximize the volume of the parameterized body B(x) contained 
in a second body G, described by a set of convex inequalities,

<br>
	maximize volume( B(x) )
<br>
	subj. to B(x) \subset G

<br>
where B(x) is a circle (problem 1), an ellipsoid (problems 2 & 3)
and a box (problem 4). The set G is a nonconvex wedge in all cases.
<br>
Starting points were generated according to Stein and Still using the
following AMPL models, 
<a href="problems/design-init-1.mod">design-init-1.mod</a>, 
<a href="problems/design-init-2.mod">design-init-2.mod</a>, 
<a href="problems/design-init-3.mod">design-init-3.mod</a>, 
<a href="problems/design-init-4.mod">design-init-4.mod</a>.
<br>
The solution to Problems 1,2 and 4 can be found 
<a href="solutions.html#design-cent">here</a>.
<br>
Two problems (design-cent-2 and design-cent-3) involve division by 
design variables, which could be small giving rise to badly scaled
constraints. This can be remedied by multiplying through by the 
denominators. Two new problems are added, design-cent-21 and design-cent-31,
which have better scaled constraints.

QPEC from ideas by Jiang & Ralph illustrating the effect of the 
complementarity multiplier.
<P>

<H3> <A NAME="kth"><hr>kth(1-3)</A> </H3>
Three simple MPECs which illustrate the three generic cases of
strong stationarity. The first solution is (0,0) and both 
multipliers are 1; the second solution is (0,1) and the 
complementarity constraint multiplier is 0 (i.e. we could have
ignored complementarity in both cases). The third problem's 
solution is also (0,1) but now the multiplier of the complementarity
constraint is 1 and in this case, the lower bound z1 >= 0 is 
redundant.
<P>

<H3> <A NAME="liswet1-inv"><hr>liswet1-(050,100,200)</A> </H3>
QPEC from an idea Stefan Scholtes, University of Cambridge.
Take a QP problem and its solution. Perturb the right hand 
side of the constraints by some control variable z and look
for the controls that give a solution closest to the original
QP solution (measured in l2 norm). This gives rise to a QPEC,
where the constraints include the first order conditions of
the original QP and possibly some polyhedral constraints on
the controls.
