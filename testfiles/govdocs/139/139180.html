PURPOSE
     GEOMV is a VICAR applications program which makes geometric
     changes in pictures.  It can be used for many purposes including
     correcting geometric distortion, increasing picture <A HREF="geomv_level2.html#size">size</A>, reducing 
     picture <A HREF="geomv_level2.html#size">size</A>, and rotating a picture.  The motive for creating
     GEOMV was to use approximately 1000 x 1000 geometric transformation
     grids to allow modelling terrain, etc.  The following are the
     principal differences with respect to the programs LGEOM and
     GEOMV:

	1. No limits on <A HREF="geomv_level2.html#size">size</A> of input/output pictures in GEOMV.
	   For really large images the program automatically goes
           into a strip processing mode, see parameters <A HREF="geomv_level2.html#vmemsize">VMEMSIZE</A>
           and <A HREF="geomv_level2.html#tmpfile">TMPFILE</A>.
	2. No limits on <A HREF="geomv_level2.html#size">size</A> of interpolation grid in GEOMV
	   except due to virtual memory limits.  There is about
	   a thousandfold increase in capacity vs the older geom
	   programs.  The large grids can only be transferred by
	   means of IBIS files.  TIECONV has been designed as a
	   companion program to handle large numbers of irregular
	   tiepoints as input and large grids as output.  A 4000
	   by 4000 image was transformed by a 500 x 500 grid
	   in 99 seconds on a SPARCstation 20.
	3. GEOMV uses double precision throughout.  There are 
	   frequent differences in LGEOM and GEOMV results for
	   cells larger than 150 pixels.  It appears that GEOMV is
	   much more accurate.  Making LGEOM more accurate would
	   probably make it slower than GEOMV.
	4. Preparation of "sharp edges" for mosaicking is
           available using <A HREF="geomv_level2.html#znoin">ZNOIN</A> (GEOMV) and NOIZ (LGEOM).  The
           two programs may do it differently, if so there should 
           probably be a standardization of this operation.  In
           GEOMV, any 0 input to the bilinear interpolation (the
           four neighbors) causes nearest neighbor interpolation.
	5. GEOMV is a little slower than LGEOM (249 seconds for an 
	   8000 x 8000 image vs 221 seconds for LGEOM).
	6. GEOMV has no bad cases.  The old restriction of less
	   than 85 degree rotation in MGEOM is gone.  Reading of
	   data for grid cells one at a time is gone.
	7. GEOMV is written entirely in C and uses dynamic allocation
	   for all data dependent arrays.
	8. The parameters <A HREF="geomv_level2.html#nah">NAH</A> and <A HREF="geomv_level2.html#nav">NAV</A> are ignored but are kept for
	   compatibility with the profusion of data sets.  The actual
	   values are calculated from the grid while the grid is
	   checked for rectangularity.
	9. GEOMV precalculates from the grid what part of the input
	   is needed.  For example, if you GEOMV a tiny portion of
	   Australia, then the program will only read in the tiny
	   portion of huge input that is needed.  This precalculation
	   is not affected by the fact that the grid might cover a
	   much larger output.  The result is not only speedup of
	   smaller cases but it also allows truly huge GEOM's to
	   be calculated in the strip mode.
       10. Grid spacing requirements differ from LGEOM.  The output
           points do not have to be integral, but the spacing has
           to be uniform in each direction.  This is easy to meet
           for mathematically generated grids, or for grids that
           come from routine TIECONV.  Incidentally, LGEOM does not
           presently check for non-integral output tiepoints, but
           seems to calculate an erroneous output.
       11. Automatic GeoTIFF labelling is supported.
	   
CALL
     geomv (INPUT,GRID) OUTPUT <A HREF="geomv_level2.html#size">SIZE</A> '(QUALIFIERS) <A HREF="geomv_level2.html#tiepoint">TIEPOINT</A>-GRID
  WHERE:
     INPUT          is the input data set.
     GRID           is an IBIS file containing a warp grid.
     OUTPUT         is the output data set.
     <A HREF="geomv_level2.html#size">SIZE</A>           is a VICAR size field for the output file
     QUALIFIERS     consist of any of the following keywords:
          NOIN          no interpolation is to be done.
          <A HREF="geomv_level2.html#znoin">ZNOIN</A>         no interpolation for points with 0 DN.
     <A HREF="geomv_level2.html#tiepoint">TIEPOINT</A>-GRID      is an alternative form for the warp grid.

     The two forms of the warp grid will now be described.

     The IBIS-file form of the grid contains four columns of
single or double precision <A HREF="geomv_level2.html#tiepoint">tiepoint</A> records.  The columns in
order are (newline,newsamp,oldline,oldsamp); or the column order
can be user specified.  <A HREF="geomv_level2.html#nah">NAH</A> and <A HREF="geomv_level2.html#nav">NAV</A> will be calculated from the
grid and the grid must be rectangular.

     The <A HREF="geomv_level2.html#tiepoint">TIEPOINT</A>-GRID is a set of points describing the relation
of the output file to that of the input file using the keyword
<A HREF="geomv_level2.html#tiepoint">TIEPOINT</A> and optionally <A HREF="geomv_level2.html#nah">NAH</A> and <A HREF="geomv_level2.html#nav">NAV</A> which are ignored.
   <A HREF="geomv_level2.html#nah">NAH</A>=nah  <A HREF="geomv_level2.html#nav">NAV</A>=nav
     <A HREF="geomv_level2.html#tiepoint">tiepoint</A>=(nl1,ns1,ol1,os1,nl2,ns2,ol2,os2,...
                   ...nlk,nsk,olk,osk)

where the grid is rectangular in the output image space, <A HREF="geomv_level2.html#nah">nah</A> is
the number of grid cells horizontally (across the top in the sample
direction), <A HREF="geomv_level2.html#nav">nav</A> is the number of grid cells vertically in the output
image space, the point pairs (nli,nsi,oli,osi) are line-sample
coordinates in the output (new) and input (old) spaces respectively.
the number of pairs k must equal (<A HREF="geomv_level2.html#nah">nah</A>+1)*(<A HREF="geomv_level2.html#nav">nav</A>+1).  The grid must be
perfectly rectangular in the output image space (the rows and
columns must be perfectly horizontal and vertical respectively).
Each direction must be evenly spaced as well, but all values can
br fractional.  The keywords <A HREF="geomv_level2.html#nah">NAH</A> and <A HREF="geomv_level2.html#nav">NAV</A> are ignored and the true
values are calculated from the grid.

The input image may either be byte or halfword data.  The data format is taken
from the VICAR label of the input file.  The output image has the same data 
format (byte or halfword) as the input image.  

Truly large cases (I envision 100 GB) are done by computing a strip <A HREF="geomv_level2.html#size">size</A>
that depends on the parameter <A HREF="geomv_level2.html#vmemsize">VMEMSIZE</A>.  VMEMSIZE is presently defaulted to
300 MB under the assumption that a 2 GB memory can handle that pretty easily
without too much paging.  But it can be reset larger or smaller as needed and
should be defaulted larger in the future (say when 10 GB memories are common).
Then, if the warp area of the input image is larger than <A HREF="geomv_level2.html#vmemsize">VMEMSIZE</A>, the program
shifts into a "strip processing" mode using the filename given by parameter
<A HREF="geomv_level2.html#tmpfile">TMPFILE</A> followed by a sequence of digits to create one file for each strip.
Then all of the strips are concatenated to give the final output.  Each piece
of each strip is designed to fit within the user provided or defaulted virtual
memory <A HREF="geomv_level2.html#size">size</A>.  Do not use a link for <A HREF="geomv_level2.html#tmpfile">tmpfile</A>.  Instead, you can use a path/filename
for the <A HREF="geomv_level2.html#tmpfile">TMPFILE</A>.  This is because multiple files will be created with TMPFILE as a
root.  You must delete the <A HREF="geomv_level2.html#tmpfile">TMPFILE</A> files after the run.
  
OPERATION

GEOMV calculates what part of the input is needed for the output, and
reads that entire amount into (virtual) memory.  Images up to 8000
square can be handled easily by the current (1999) generation of
workstations.  Larger images can be handled by sectioning of the output
into a set of tiles, warping them, and then mosaicking the tiles.
The tiles are guaranteed to butt together perfectly.

Unlike MGEOM, GEOMV does not tile the input for the warp grid cells.
It holds all of the cells for a cell-row of output in memory and holds
all of the input image in memory.  Thus there is little penalty for
having a vast number of grid cells.

PERFORMANCE

A 4000 by 4000 image was transformed by a 500 x 500 grid
in 99 seconds on a SPARCstation 20.  Reducing the grid to 30 x 30
cut the time to 39 seconds.  This shows that the use of a large 
grid doesn't penalize the time too much.

Restrictions
------------

The output grid must cover the output image.  The program gives an
error message and stops if it doesn't.  The output grid can be larger.
There are no restrictions on the input grid. 

THE OUTPUT GRID MUST ALSO BE UNIFORMLY SPACED IN EACH DIRECTION
(MORE RESTRICTIVE THAN LGEOM).  THE SPACING VERTICALLY DOES
NOT HAVE TO EQUAL THE SPACING HORIZONTALLY THOUGH.
ON THE OTHER HAND, THE OUTPUT GRID VALUES CAN BE FRACTIONAL (LGEOM
REQUIRES WHOLE NUMBERS).  THESE REQUIREMENTS ARE EASY TO MEET IF THE
GRID IS GENERATED MATHEMATICALLY OR IF A PROGRAM SUCH AS TIECONV IS
USED.
