<HR>The following World Wide Web sites offer information relevant to
your project. Depending on your particular research interest, some
sites will obviously be more relevant than others. To optimize the
efforts of your Web search, each site has been described so that you
might judge its usefulness in advance. As you proceed with your World
Wide Web search, document your progress (both successes and failures)
using the <A HREF="wst.html">Web Site Trail</A> sheet.</P>

         <P>Cornell University operates a Bioacoustics Research
         Program. This site describes the research efforts conducted
         by the program, which focus primarily upon whale migration
         and bird calls and songs. The BRP has collected over 70,000
         sounds of bird calls and ultimately plans to make them
         available (in part) on the WWW. A CD of whale sounds can
         also be purchased for a minimal price through the BRP. An
         additional treat involves the opportunity to subscribe to
         the BIOACOUSTICS-L mailing list in order to ask questions and
         receive answers from experts in the field of bioacoustics.

         practical applications in regard to the monitoring and
         censusing of cetaceans, the development of advanced methods

         Sciences' Museum of Biological Diversity. The BLB houses one

         world. The collection contains approximately 23,200
         recordings of over 1,000 species of animals. Many of these

         <P>This lab conducts research and development on acoustic
         control. Desired audio signals (speech, music) are processed
         such that they have optimal quality and intelligibility,
         undesired sound (noise) is optimally suppressed. To achieve
         these goals, the concept of wave field synthesis is applied:
         not only the temporal, but also the spatial properties of
         the sound field are fully controlled. Transducer arrays are
         required to registrate and generate the relevant sound
         waves. The processing is performed with advanced
         DSP-technology.
