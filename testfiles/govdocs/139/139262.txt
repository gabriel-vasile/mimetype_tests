obtain reliable means for each month. The relations, if any esist, between the daily variability of temperature and the mean nionthly temperature have not been vpry
thoroughly investigated. For instance, it is possible t.mi in estremely cold nionths the variabi1it.y of temperature
is reater, and in wnrni monblis less, thnn the average. fTsing data compiled by Wa.hl6n from long recorcls of Russian stations, the author has unrlert,aken this in- vestigation. The Russian st.ations used are Warsaw
(101 years), Port Baltic (44 years), Brcha.nge1 (GS years), Astrakhan (44 years), Katharinenhurg (52 years). Rilr-
naul (45 years), and Ynkut.sb (37 venrsj. ’In addit.ion, data for Vienna (73 years) ancl for Pola (40 years) coiii- piled by von Hann, were used. The results of the investigabion were three fold: For Pola, which typifies the cliniate influenced by the occnn, there was no relation between the variahilit,y ancl tlie departure f r p i the monthly mean. Vitmnn, Wursnw, Port Baltic, Archa.nge1, and Ast,rakhnn fall into a second
croup, in which the following relation seenis to hold: In
b e months colder than normal the variithility of daily temperatures is greater .than the nvernge; in months warmer than normal, it IS less t.han t.he avernge. This region seenis to form a t.ransit.ion between oceanic and continental climates. At Barnnul nnd Kat.lia.rinenhur,airg in west Siberia, t.1iis rule does not hold, nnd nt, Y’c?kutsk in east Siberia the relat.ion is reversed; i. e.,, in wint.er months colder than normal there is a smnll variahility of t,emperat.urF, and in those warmer than normnl the variability IS large. The proof that these relat,ions are not, accidental is to be found in the sniooth progression of values from Poln t.0 Yakutsk. The relation is weakest in regions of most, intense cold. Great variahi1it.y of tenipmit,ure implies cold nnd warm waves following one mother rapidly. But in Yakut.sk the lower the iiionthly n i r ~n lies the more uniform the temperature, because of fewer w r m
waves.’-C! L. M.
THE LAWS OF APPROACH TO THE GEOSTROPHIC WIND-
By F. J. R’. WHIPPLE.

In the steady state, t.he forces n t each level in the atmosphere due to rotation, radieiib, and intt~nal fric-
surface, t i e addit,ional drag clue, to frict,ion is pract,iciilly equal and opposite to the drag clue t.o t.he eddies, since it may be shown that the conihined effect of pressure t i n d
rotation is only one-thirtieth that of one of the ot.lier two forces, and hence mav be ignored. The actual wind
at any level is considered as the vector suni of the gra- dient wind and a fictitious “relative wind.” In t,he case of stra.ight,, parallel, mot,ionless isolmrs. with uni- form distribution of density, gradient, and eddy niot,ion throughout the heiuht considered, t.he above conditions
lead to three laws: ?. The relative wind fiills off w-ith in- crease of height according to the exponential law x=R,e-@Z-a), where R is tlie relative wind at t.he height z, and R, that a t height 2,; B is a constnnt., B? = w sin X (pip) . 11. The direction of the relat.ivc wind turns uniformly wit,h increase of height, the circular mensure of ita azimuth being given by 4 - +” = B (.z - 2,).

111. The angle between the actual wind near the sur-
face and the relative wind there is 135O. Tlie velocity curve traced out by the lines, drawn from a fised origin, representing t.he relative winds at all heights, is t.he equi- nnwlar spiral of Ekman, the constant angle between the r&us vector and t,he tungent (the latter representing transfer of moment.um by the eddies) being 45’. The Law of Dynniiiic Siniilarity t.hen lends t.o Taylor’s rcl.st.ion. V, = G (cos a - sin a).
Tlie first. two laws also hold when G changes with height: G=G,+h; then e-3ilr14 R,=n(V,-IT), where
IT =A/nB JB, and a = SpV,/pBJZ, a eneralization of Liw 111. With V,, arid IT known, 6, may be com- uted; and with tlic law of chsnge of G wibh height
!nown, V at any l e d may he computed. Tlie t8heory is applied to the case where observation shows east whds at the surface to be replaced by wst winds at 3,000
met,ew, so that the chapge of gnrlicnt wind with in- creasing height is equivnlent to the addition of a westerly component,; then for surface winds of equal st,rength, it is found t.hat the backing of the surface wind is least for south winds, greatest for north winds; the ratio of surface wind to adient wind is least for southeast graditmt wind ancrgreatt.st for northwest. This shows tdic tendency for tlie surface wind to be governed by the wost,rophic wind alof t rathrr than tlie geostrophic
winci‘at tlie suiqace. Tlie theory is applied in iletnil t80 Dobson’s Salisbury Plain observations, and again tlie fact is theoret,ically confirmed that the gradient speed is attained at about 300 meters, while the paclient direction is not attained unt,il a much ,mater lieidit. Comparisons of theory
with observat,ion are rtw&red difficult because of the influence of the anemometer exposures, but such com- tu-isons as have been made, cs ec.ially with the data of
being much lighter in compnrison with gradient winds

that, variations of lat,ltucle were caused by sudden internal movenient,s, of seismic . origin; Moiitcssus de Ballore’s former d0ubt.s about this would not now hold, since he has come to believe that earthquakes and epeirogenic movement.s are one and t,lie same. (C! R., 155, 1S33,
1914.) The present author states that on a rrrallel of labitude,
