              <h3>Level 3 National Winner: Ayesha Usmani</h3>

              <p>Dear Amy Tan,</p>
              <p>My mother sits at her corner at the table: the East, her home,
                her memories. I sit at the West, opposite from her. East and
                West, two cultures constantly colliding, but both fit in one
                world. Fit together like mahjong tiles, but I cannot see. I see
                our definite differences, I see the distance between us, I see
                her coming towards me, but I run away, far away to the other
                side of the world. I love the West, but must I give up the East,
                too?</p>
              <p>The sun rises in the East and kisses the sky with its golden
                hues, and my mother rises and pounds the dough with her small,
                flour-covered hands. A new idea dawns in her head as she twists
                and stretches the dough. She calls me, and I grudgingly come
                downstairs, groggy and confused because it's seven in the morning.
                My mother has that gleam in her eyes. I have seen that look before--a
                look that makes you cringe and twist in annoyance and despair.
                I reluctantly snatch the dough from the plate and start rolling
                and pounding it. Smack, thud, and flip. By the end of the cooking
                lesson, I am covered in flour, the trashcan is overflowing with
                my disasters, and my mother is frustrated. I wash my face with
                a splash of cold water and look up. June stares at me from the
                mirror. She whispers about not letting my mother change and control
                me.</p>
              <p>My mother wanders about the store, and I make sure I wander
                in another direction. I come with her in the check out line,
                avoiding the peculiar stares of the salesclerk. My mother asks,
                in her not-so-perfect English, if there is a sale. The clerk
                mumbles an answer, and my mother is confused. I quietly whisper
                to her in Urda that the sale was last week. My mother responds
                to me loudly in Urda, and I feel embarrassed. I distance myself
                from her as we head towards the car. People turn and look at
                us, muffling their giggles. I am imagining, but I am not imagining
                the shame. Why doesn't my mother understand me? Can't she fit
                in with American culture? Waverly shined within me. Independent,
                stubborn, and ashamed of cultural ties, I mimicked her moves
                and prepared for the attack.</p>
              <p>I must transcend these linguistic and cultural barriers. Barriers
                that block me from my mother. A mother, with all her energy,
                who loves and guides me. This guidance must direct me to a new
                path. A path that will allow me to appreciate my mother and my
                vibrant culture.</p>
              <p>I wear my <i>shalwar kameez</i> and brush my hair back. I feel
                uncomfortable. I carefully pour the green tea for my aunt and
                uncles. I feel subservient. I sit upright and talk, mostly listen,
                with my grandmother. I feel bored. I listen quietly and patiently
                to my mother and aunts complain about prices, daughters, cooking,
                husbands, aging, and daughters. I feel awkward. I look aimlessly
                out the window, and Jing-mei stares back at charlatan.</p>
              <p>I strive to find the connection with mother. A connection that
                will balance independence and loyalty to my heritage. A balance
                of Pakistani values of love, obedience, and humility in harmony
                with American values of independence, free speech, and self-esteem.
                A journey that will always be difficult but worth the effort.
                I desired that connection with your guidance Amy Tan. A connection
                that I have now found. My mother sits at her corner in the East,
                and I at the West. But we unite in harmony. A harmony that appreciates
                our similarities and our dependence for each other.</p>
              <p>With sincere gratitude,</p>
              <p>Ayesha Usmani</p>
