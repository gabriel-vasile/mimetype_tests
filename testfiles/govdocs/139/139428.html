        <h2>Introduction<a name="introduction"></a></h2>
        <p> Under the 1976 Copyright Act as amended (title 17 of the United States 
          Code), a work is protected by copyright from the time it is created 
          in a fixed form. In other words, when a work is written down or otherwise 
          set into tangible form, the copyright immediately becomes the property 
          of the author who created it. Only the author or those deriving their 
          rights from the author can rightfully claim copyright.</p>
        <p> Although the general rule is that the person who creates a work is 
          the author of that work, there is an exception to that principle: the 
          copyright law defines a category of works called &#8220;works made for 
          hire.&#8221; If a work is &#8220;made for hire,&#8221; the employer, 
          and not the employee, is considered the author. The employer may be 
          a firm, an organization, or an individual.</p>
        <p> To understand the complex concept of a work made for hire, it is necessary 
          to refer not only to the statutory definition but also to its interpretation 
          in cases decided by courts.</p>
        <h3></h3>
        <hr class="1" size="1">
        <h2>Statutory<a name="statutory"></a> Definition</h2>
        <p>Section 101 of the copyright law defines a &#8220;work made for hire&#8221; 
          as:</p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p> (1) a work prepared by an employee within the scope of his or her 
            employment; or</p>
          <p> (2) a work specially ordered or commissioned for use as a contribution 
            to a collective work, as a part of a motion picture or other audiovisual 
            work, as a translation, as a supplementary work, as a compilation, 
            as an instructional text, as a test, as answer material for a test, 
            or as an atlas, if the parties expressly agree in a written instrument 
            signed by them that the work shall be considered a work made for hire. 
            For the purpose of the foregoing sentence, a &#8220;supplementary 
            work&#8221; is a work prepared for a publication as a secondary adjunct 
            to a work by another author for the purpose of introducing, concluding, 
            illustrating, explaining, revising, commenting upon, or assisting 
            in the use of the other work, such as forewords, afterwords, pictorial 
            illustrations, maps, charts, tables, editorial notes, musical arrangements, 
            answer material for tests, bibliographies, appendixes, and indexes; 
            and an &#8220;instructional text&#8221; is a literary, pictorial, 
            or graphic work prepared for publication and with the purpose of use 
            in systematic instructional activities.</p>

        <h2>Determining<a name="determining"></a> Whether aWork Is Made for Hire</h2>
        <p>Whether or not a particular work is made for hire is determined by 
          the relationship between the parties. This determination may be difficult, 
          because the statutory definition of a work made for hire is complex 
          and not always easily applied. That definition was the focus of a 1989 
          Supreme Court decision (<em>Community for Creative Non-Violence</em> 
          v. <em>Reid</em>, 490 U.S. 730 [1989]). The court held that to determine 
          whether a work is made for hire, one must first ascertain whether the 
          work was prepared by (1) an employee or (2) an independent contractor.</p>
        <p> If a work is created by an employee, part 1 of the statutory definition 
          applies, and generally the work would be considered a work made for 
          hire.<strong> IMPORTANT</strong>: The term &#8220;employee&#8221; here 
          is not really the same as the common understanding of the term; for 
          copyright purposes, it means an employee under the general common law 
          of agency. This is explained in further detail below. Please read about 
          this at &#8220;Employer-Employee Relationship Under Agency Law.&#8221;</p>
        <p> If a work is created by an independent contractor (that is, someone 
          who is not an employee under the general common law of agency), then 
          the work is a specially ordered or commissioned work, and part 2 of 
          the statutory definition applies. Such a work can be a work made for 
          hire only if <strong>both</strong> of the following conditions are met: 
          (1) it comes within one of the nine categories of works listed in part 
          2 of the definition and (2) there is a written agreement between the 
          parties specifying that the work is a work made for hire. </p>
        <p><b>Employer<a name="employer"></a>-Employee Relationship Under Agency 
          Law</b></p>
        <p> If a work is created by an employee, part 1 of the copyright code&#8217;s 
          definition of a work made for hire applies. To help determine who is 
          an employee, the Supreme Court in <em>CCNV</em> v. <em>Reid</em> identified 
          certain factors that characterize an &#8220;employeremployee&#8221; 
          relationship as defined by agency law:</p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p> 1)<strong> Control by the employer over the work</strong> (e.g., 
            the employer may determine how the work is done, has the work done 
            at the employer&#8217;s location, and provides equipment or other 
            means to create work) </p>
          <p>2) <strong>Control by employer over the employe</strong>e (e.g., 
            the employer controls the employee&#8217;s schedule in creating work, 
            has the right to have the employee perform other assignments, determines 
            the method of payment, and/ or has the right to hire the employee&#8217;s 
            assistants)</p>
          <p>3) <strong>Status and conduct of employer</strong> (e.g., the employer 
            is in business to produce such works, provides the employee with benefits, 
            and/or withholds tax from the employee&#8217;s payment)</p>
          <p> These factors are not exhaustive. The court left un-clear which 
            of these factors must be present to establish the employment relationship 
            under the work for hire definition, but held that supervision or control 
            over creation of the work alone is not controlling.</p>
          <p> All or most of these factors characterize a regular, salaried employment 
            relationship, and it is clear that a work created within the scope 
            of such employment is a work made for hire (unless the parties involved 
            agree otherwise).</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p> Examples of works for hire created in an employment relationship are:</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p> A software program created within the scope of his or her duties 
            by a staff programmer for Creative Computer Corporation.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p> A newspaper article written by a staff journalist for publication 
            in the newspaper that employs him.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p> A musical arrangement written for XYZ Music Company by a salaried 
            arranger on its staff.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p> A sound recording created by the salaried staff engineers of ABC 
            Record Company.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
        <p> The closer an employment relationship comes to regular, salaried employment, 
          the more likely it is that a work created within the scope of that employment 
          would be a work made for hire. However, since there is no precise standard 
          for determining whether or not a work is made for hire under the first 
          part of the definition, consultation with an attorney for legal advice 
          may be advisable.</p>
        <hr class="1" size="1">
        <h2>Who<a name="who"></a> Is the Author of aWork Made for Hire?</h2>
        <p>If a work is a work made for hire, the employer or other person for 
          whom the work was prepared is the author and should be named as the 
          author in Space 2 of the application for copyright registration. The 
          box marked &#8220;work-made-for-hire&#8221; should be checked &#8220;yes.&#8221;</p>
