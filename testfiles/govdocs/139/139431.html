AMY BIEHL FOUNDATION TRUST<BR>
MEDIA CONFERENCE-Thursday, 30 September 1999<BR>
USAID Speaker:  Henry W. Reynolds, Deputy Director</CENTER></B>
<P>

Ladies and Gentlemen,</P>
<P>
It is a deep honor to be here with you today.  </P>
<P>
I like to think of myself as a development worker, yet I've also given quite a few speeches during my 25 years with USAID.  But today is a very different occasion.  I'm NOT going to give a conventional speech.  I want to share some intense thoughts and feelings about a program that has captured my heart-the Amy Biehl Foundation.  At the same time, I will, of course, tell you some official new USAID information that relates to the wonderful activities that the Foundation is doing around Cape Town.  </P>
<P>
First, some history about USAID's relationship with Peter and Linda Biehl and the Foundation named after their daughter, Amy:</P>
<P>
 On September 19, 1997, we-meaning USAID/South Africa-signed a cooperative agreement with the Amy Biehl Foundation Trust to support specific activities to halt violence among vulnerable teenagers and other youth in Gugulethu.  </P>
<P>
 The agreement recognized the Amy Biehl Foundation's "special relationship" with South Africa (that you are all aware of).  It also launched a major violence prevention initiative aimed at adolescents and their families living in townships and squatter camps near Cape Town.</P>
<P>
 The project was called "Weaving a Barrier against Violence".  This slogan is still used very appropriately by the Amy Biehl Foundation today.  It is a holistic approach to inhibit the plague of violent behavior.  </P>
<P>
I used to work as a Probation Officer in Los Angeles, California, before joining USAID.  So I know how a gang mentality works.  Gangs appeal to teenagers and even younger children who have been victims of forced poverty, broken families and inferior education.  They don't have places to study or play in their poor neighborhoods.  Resentment and boredom conspire to cast a persuasive spell over young people looking for acceptance and a better life.  But this enticing curse CAN be broken.  I've seen it happen.  I've seen it happen with the young people in Gugulethu who participate with the Amy Biehl Foundation after-school care and development programs.  </P>
<P>
This project is the continuation of Amy's unfinished agenda of building bridges and racial harmony  - linking people, cultures and countries.</P>
<P>
These programs have achieved excellent results because they are community-inspired, created by the people for themselves, under the able administration of the Amy Biehl Foundation leadership.</P>
<P>
 The dedication of Amy's parent and my friends, Peter and Linda Biehl, has converted Amy's vision into a reality.  Scores of changed lives bear testimony to this claim in the Cape Flats today.  Young people are learning and growing as productive young adults.  Some have already entered the field of work with skills they learned through the Foundation.  Others are talking excitedly about their desires to be part of a healthy family some day, modeling characteristics of parenting they have seen in the Biehls.  </P>
<P>
 Linda and Peter's path to forgiveness has laid a solid, effective groundwork to prevent future generations of South Africans from getting sucked in to the circle of violence.</P>
<P>
 In this spirit, USAID/South Africa is pleased to announce a new grant to the Amy Biehl Foundation Trust in the amount of $1,435,000 (that's about 8,610,000 RAND) to continue and expand their program of reversing the trend towards violence.  This brings total funding of USAID/South Africa's grant to the Foundation to $2,345,000, or approximately 14,070,000 RAND.</P>
<P>
 I've seen countless successes of  development supported by USAID across the world.  Right now, I want to personally attest to the effectiveness of the Amy Biehl Foundation's outreach, with support from USAID, in South Africa:</P>
 <P>
 Bakeries have been started in townships that not only provide employment, but also serve as skills and business management training centers.  Not to mention the delicious and nutritious bread they provide at an affordable price.</P>
<P>
 The development of sports fields allow the kids in the townships to be kids, while offering a healthier environment both physically and socially</P>
<P>
 As you can see, the crafts on this table have been hand-made by "Amy Biehl's kids" from the after-school program.  Caring, patient teachers instruct children in these and other skills that do not receive emphasis in the public school systems.</P>
<P>
 We at USAID are proud to work in partnership with the Amy Biehl Foundation and the people of South Africa.  Amy's visions, hopes and ideals are truly living on.  And as we work we can be proud that we embody Amy's motto:  "Make a Difference".</P>
<P>
Somehow, it's not surprising that Amy's hero was Nelson Mandela.  Let me close by quoting South Africa's former President as he remembered Amy in Washington, DC:</P>
<P>
 "She made our aspirations her own and lost her life in the turmoil of our transition as the new South Africa struggled to be born in the dying moments of apartheid.  Through her, our peoples have also shared the pain of confronting a terrible past as we take the path of reconciliation and healing of our nation."</P>
<P>
<U>I URGE you to continue to heal</U>.  You have come so far with your shining rainbow.  We at USAID pledge to help your impressive strides in development.  Today is one such illustration. <P>
Thank you.</P>
