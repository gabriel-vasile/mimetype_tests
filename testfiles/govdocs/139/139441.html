      <P> <b>W<span class="body">ho I Am and What I Do</span></b><br>        <span class="body">Hello, my name is Amy Ross. I work on space suits at         the NASA/Johnson Space Center. I like working on space suits because that         means that I get to get into the suits, too. I've been in five different         Extra-Vehicular Activity (EVA) suits, including the Russian space suit,         and I've been in two different versions of the crew escape suit (the orange         suits astronauts where when they launch and land). I've even gotten to         work in the some of the suits in the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory (NBL,         the big water tank where astronauts train for space walks) and on the         KC-135 Reduced Gravity Aircraft (the 'Vomit Comet'). Being in and working         in the space suits is a neat experience! I work on advanced space suits         and have worked on the Shuttle/Space station suit and crew escape suit.         My title is space suit project engineer. I help design and test improvements         to the space suits and new designs for Mars. </span>       <P> <span class="body"><b>What I like best and least about my job </b> <BR>        I like testing space suits, from the inside and outside. I don't like         paperwork and bureaucracy. </span>       <P><span class="body"> One fact I'd like you to remember about me is that         I try to do a good job, but I'm always learning so that I can do better.         </span></p>      <span class="body"><b>Career Journey<br>      </b></span><span class="body">I decided in high school to work on the space       program, after working in a vet clinic for a summer. I decided that being       a vet wasn't for me and I'd had a long time interest in the space program.       I took calculus, chemistry and physics in high school, as well as English.       Then I went to college at Purdue University for both a bachelor's and master's       degree in mechanical engineering. While I went to college, I participated       in the Cooperative Education Program at the NASA/Johnson Space Center. The       Co-op program is a work- study program in which I spent ever other semester       working. I got to work in different areas of JSC and decide in which place       I wanted to work permanently.</span>       <p><span class="body"><b>Growing Up<br>        </b>I grew up in Friendswood, Texas, which is a small town about ten miles         from the Johnson Space Center. We moved there from Edwards Air Force Base         in California when I was in the second grade. People who live in Friendswood         primarily work for the space program, or the oil business. My dad works         and has worked for the space program for most of his career. (This was         his dream since the fourth grade.) He shared his enthusiasm for it with         my brother and I. We launched model rockets, we watched every shuttle         launch, we went to work with him, and we star-gazed. His enthusiasm was         contagious, and quite an influence on me. A lot of my friends' parents         also worked on the space program and my brother and I went to NASA a lot         with my dad. So, I was surrounded by the space program. </span> </p>      <P><span class="body"> When I was growing up, I wanted to be a veterinarian.         Instead of playing house or school, I played vet office. When I got into         high school I also thought about being a librarian and working for the         space program. </span>       <P><span class="body"> Every summer, when I was a kid, our family went to         Indiana. My mom's parents live on a farm, so my brother, my cousins, and         I would play with the animals, in the hay mow, in the creek, and in the         barn. We had a great time. We had ten acres to roam all day. Plus, Grammie         would feed us good farm cooking. Other people would talk about the places         that they went on vacation, but I thought (and still do think) that Indiana         is the best vacation spot in the world. </span>       <P><span class="body"> I read a lot. I enjoyed Madeline L'Engle, Louisa         May Alcott, <I>Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIHM</I>, <I>The Lord of the         Rings</I>, <I>The Rescuers</I>, Dodie Smith's <I>101 Dalmations</I>, <I>Oliver         Twist</I>, and others. Reading opened up ideas, new people, new lands,         and new ways of doing things for me. It made me realize that there are         possibilities and encouraged me to explore those possibilities. The space         program also is all about exploring possibilities, new lands, ideas, and         ways of doing things. </span></p>      <span class="body"><b>My Family<br>      </b>I now live in my own house in Friendswood. My parents still live in       Friendswood too. I like having them close. My mom and I walk my dog together       and my dad helps me with home repairs. My family is originally from Indiana       and most of my family (grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins) still lives       there, so I visit Indiana often. My family likes to play cards and board       games, go to the movies, and to go on vacation together. </span>       <P><span class="body"> I'm single. My pets are my kids. I have a Great Dane         named Darcy. Her coloring is harlequin, which means that she looks like         a Holstien cow (white with black splotches). She is BIG, but a sweety.         I also have a parakeet named Henry. His singing is cheery. I'm thinking         about getting two kittens, too. </span></p>      <span class="body"><b>Future Plans and Goals<br>      </b>My goal is to be a major contributor to the design of the Mars space       suit and to see people wear it on the surface of Mars. I work with a man       who has worked on every space suit from the Mercury suit on. He is a space       suit expert. I'm trying to learn as much as I can from him and hope to become       as good a space suit engineer as he is so that I can design the suit that       goes to Mars.</span> <!-- #EndEditable --></td>    <td width="20">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td width="6" align="center" valign="top" bgcolor="#003366"><img src="../../../img/new_iface/main_iface/pix_dkblue.gif" width="6" height="1" alt="Spacer"></td>    <td width="167" align="center" valign="top" bgcolor="#99CC00">&nbsp;</td>    <td width="20">&nbsp;</td>    <td width="473">&nbsp;</td>    <td width="20">&nbsp;</td>  </tr></table><table width="686" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">  <tr align="center" valign="middle">     <td>       <p><img src="../../../img/new_iface/main_iface/bar_bot_new.jpg" width="686" height="20" alt="Footer Bar Graphic"><br>        <img src="../../../img/new_iface/main_iface/footer_icons/left_spacer.gif" width="39" height="52" alt="Spacer"><a href="../../../projects/space/index.html"><img src="../../../img/new_iface/main_iface/footer_icons/space.gif" width="63" height="52" alt="Space Icon" border="0"></a><a href="../../../projects/aero/index.html"><img src="../../../img/new_iface/main_iface/footer_icons/aero.gif" width="71" height="52" alt="Aerospace Icon" border="0"></a><a href="../../../projects/astro/index.html"><img src="../../../img/new_iface/main_iface/footer_icons/astro.gif" width="69" height="52" alt="Astrobiology Icon" border="0"></a><a href="../../../projects/won/index.html"><img src="../../../img/new_iface/main_iface/footer_icons/won.gif" width="69" height="52" alt="Women of NASA Icon" border="0"></a><img src="../../../img/new_iface/main_iface/footer_icons/right_spacer.gif" width="35" height="52" alt="Spacer">         <br>        <img src="../../../img/new_iface/main_iface/footer_icons/credits.gif" width="432" height="34" alt="Footer Info"></p>    </td>  </tr></table></body><!-- #EndTemplate --></html>ÿ
