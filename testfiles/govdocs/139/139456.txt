Headquarters training for FFS Remote Data Entry was held this week. 
Beginning Monday, May 6, 1996, any financial documents needing a document 
number should be placed in the inbox marked "RDE" in Amy Corwell's office 
(Room 5A-231). Document numbers will be assigned on the document itself 
rather than over the phone.

Listed below are new procedures that you will need to note:

Requisitions/POs: Amy will provide a document number and will return to 
the requesting office for further processing. Once the PO is cut, the 
finance copy should be forwarded to Amy for obligation.

Invoices: After certification, please forward the original to Amy rather 
than OFM.

Training Forms: When preparing the Training Form, please ensure the 
Billing address includes Mail Stop 442 rather than OFM's (MS 270). Amy 
will need to provide a document 
number for these as well.

This means all of the documents above will no longer be entered into AIS. 
Amy will be paying or obligating these documents in FFS and they will be  
reported the next day in AIS reports.

Federal Express, Self Service Store invoices, and Travel Voucher 
procedures remain the same.

These procedures are subject to change. Suggestions are welcome.  I can 
be reached at x5040 if there are any questions. 

Thanks for everyone's assistance and support in this effort.

Kelly
