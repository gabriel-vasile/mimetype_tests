Dear Dr. Henney:

I strongly support the FDA's proposal to require manufacturers to label the amount of trans fat in their products. Trans-fat labeling is important because trans fat increases blood cholesterol levels and heart disease risk. Labeling also is necessary so that people are provided with complete information about the healthfulness of products such as margarines, cookies, crackers, snack cakes, French fries, and doughnuts, which often contain more artery-clogging fats than their labels indicate.

The FDA also should maintain the current daily value (DV or day's budget) for saturated fat even though the DV will include both trans fat and saturated fat under the proposed labeling format. Furthermore, I strongly support the idea to limit the amount of trans fat in foods that make low saturated fat, no cholesterol, lean, made with vegetable oil, health, and other claims. Claims that currently have limits on saturated fat are misleading if a product contains significant amounts of trans fat, which also increases the risk of heart disease.

I commend the FDA for its strong proposal regarding trans-fat labeling. Thank you for providing Americans with another tool to help improve our diets and reduce our risk of heart disease.


Sincerely,

Amy Stock
