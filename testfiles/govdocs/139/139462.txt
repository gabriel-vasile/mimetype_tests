Robyn,

Here is my letter.  I hope you don't mind, but I basically copied the 
information you sent.  Please let me know if I can write any more letters.

Dear FDA,

I am aware that a petition (Docket # 98P-0151/CP1) is currently before the 
FDA to prohibit the slaughter of 'downed' animals. As you know, this 
petition stems from the basis that animals too sick to even stand should not 
enter the human food chain, due to the increased risk of bacterial 
contamination, and evidence that some downed cows may even be afflicted with 
a form of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or "Mad Cow Disease".  In 
addition, there is no humane way to move a downed animal; they are typically 
dragged with chains, or lifted with a forklift, causing suffering and 
further injuries.

Downed animals comprise a  very small percentage of animals slaughtered,
and prohibiting their marketing would cause no undue economic hardship. In 
fact, removing the market for downed animals would encourage better
treatment and handling, thus preventing most downers in the first place.

There is growing consensus for such a prohibition, and I'd like to say that 
I am absolutely for this petition.  Please grant Docket # 98P-0151/CP1.

Sincerely,
Amy K. Wilks
