Dear U.S.  TTB,

I am writing today to request that the TTB approve a proposal to allow the amount of calories, carbohydrates and alcohol per serving size to be included on beer and other alcoholic beverage bottles. This information is on everything else that I eat and drink. I would like this kind of information for beer as well.

Because this information is provided elsewhere, I believe it is common sense to allow it to be printed on a beer bottle.
Therefore, I urge you to approve this proposal. It will be much appreciated.


Sincerely,

Amy Fachko
