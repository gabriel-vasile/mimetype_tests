Dear U.S.  TTB,

I am writing to ask that you allow alcohol beverages in this country to include basic information such as serving size and alcohol per serving on their labels. 

For years, state and federal authorities have encouraged Americans to eat and drink responsibly. Today American consumers are able to make healthier decisions about what they eat because nearly all edible products have nutritional and serving facts displayed prominently on the outside packaging. 

It is time that drinks with alcohol are allowed to do the same.
With regard to labels, it is time that spirits, wine and beer follow the same guidelines as all other consumable products. Let the American consumer know the facts about what he or she is drinking.

Thank you for your consideration.


Sincerely,

Amy Elliott
