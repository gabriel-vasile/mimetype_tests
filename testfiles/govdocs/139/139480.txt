			Title:  shorebird
	Description:  
		Abstract:  This data layer is a subset of a statewide coverage.  Coastal Wildlife Concentration Areas (CWCA) data was used as a starting point.  Extensive field surveys began in 1993 to present further refined feeding and roosting areas and identify new areas.  Areas are labeled as feeding sites, roosting sites or both.
		Purpose:  This subset of the statewide data layer was developed for use in the Habitat Consultation Areas Mapping Project (HCAMP).
		Supplemental_Information:  This data layer specifically addresses migratory shorebird coastal staging areas.  Staging habitat is defined as areas that meet shorebird feeding and roosting requirements during migration.
