	Description:  
		Abstract:  This coverage includes more than 1300 occurrence records for rare wildlife species in Maine.  Buffer polygon coverage associated with point coverage.
		Purpose:  Data is used for status assessment, species management and habitat conservation for Endangered, Threatened and other rare species.  This subset of the statewide data layer was developed for use in the Habitat Consultation Areas Mapping Project (HCAMP).
		Supplemental_Information:  The BCD is an information management component of the Natural Heritage Program Network created by the Nature Conservancy.  It is designed to track information on the status, life history, conservation needs, and occurrences for rare species and natural communities.  MDIFW is responsible for maintaining the zoological portion of the database, which contains information on approximately 1050 animal species native to the State.
