ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDINGS
     

SEC SETTLES FINANCIAL FRAUD CASE AGAINST WILLIAM BUETTNER, MARK KIRSTEIN, AND
AMY  FRAZIER, FORMER AUDITORS FOR AHERF AND RULE 102(e)(3) PROCEEDING AGAINST
BUETTNER
     
     The  Commission announced today that on July 28, the Honorable Norma  L.
     Shapiro,  U.S.  District Court Judge, Eastern District  of  Pennsylvania
     entered  Final Judgments against William F. Buettner, Mark D.  Kirstein,
     and  Amy  S.  Frazier,  members  of the  Coopers  &  Lybrand,  LLP  (now
     PricewaterhouseCoopers,   LLP)  engagement   team   that   audited   the
     consolidated  financial statements of Allegheny  Health,  Education  and
     Research Foundation (AHERF) for the year ending June 30, 1997.
     
       *  The Final Judgment as to defendant Buettner permanently enjoins him from
          violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act)
          and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and requires him to pay a civil money penalty of
          $40,000.00.
     
       *  The Final Judgments as to defendants Kirstein and Frazier enjoin them
          from participating as a member of the engagement team of any independent
          auditing firm that issues audit reports in connection with the financial
          statements of any public or private entity for a two-year period.
     
     The  defendants  consented to the entry of the final  judgments  without
     admitting  or  denying the allegations of the Second  Amended  Complaint
     (complaint).
     
     According  to the allegations of the complaint, Buettner, Kirstein,  and
     Frazier,  all certified public accountants, served respectively  as  the
     engagement  partner, the senior manager, and the manager on  the  failed
     audit   of  AHERF,  at  its  height  the  largest  nonprofit  healthcare
     organization  in Pennsylvania.  The Commission's complaint alleged  that
     each  of  them  actively  participated in a fraudulent  scheme  to  mask
     AHERF's  deteriorating financial condition.  In so doing, the defendants
     participated  in  the creation and issuance of, and failed  to  correct,
     audit  reports  that  contained unqualified opinions concerning  AHERF's
     1997  consolidated  financial statements and AHERF's 1997  supplementary
     consolidating and combining financial information.  For its fiscal  year
     1997,  AHERF  reported net income when, in reality, it was operating  at
     substantial net loss.
     
     The  scheme,  as  alleged  in  the complaint,  involved  the  fraudulent
     transfer  of  $99.6 million of reserves from the books  of  a  recently-
     acquired  entity  to  the  books of a group  of  AHERF-related  entities
     collectively  known  as  the Delaware Valley Obligated  Group  (Delaware
     Valley). The transferred reserves were used by Delaware Valley to either
     increase its own reserves or to reduce expenses related to the write-off
     of  uncollectible  accounts receivable. Buettner, Kirstein  and  Frazier
     played an active role in the fraud by, among other things, helping AHERF
     plan  fraudulent transfers of reserves and subsequently  conducting  the
     1997  audit  in  a  manner intended to hide both  the  fraud  and  their
     involvement in it. Furthermore, the Commission's complaint alleged  that
     they failed to expand their audit to address the improper transfers,  or
     to  investigate  evidence  of other transfers  that  violated  Generally
     Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), as required by Generally Accepted
     Auditing Standards (GAAS).
     
     The  Commission  also announced that on August 2 it had  instituted  and
     simultaneously  settled  a Rule 102(e)(3) proceeding  against  Buettner,
     which  was  based  upon  the  entry of the  District  Court  injunction.
     Buettner  consented  to  an  Order  suspending  him  from  appearing  or
     practicing  before  the Commission as an accountant with  the  right  to
     apply  for reinstatement after a period of four years.  [SEC v.  William
     F. Buettner, Mark D. Kirstein and Amy S. Frazier, USDC EDPA, 01-CV-3898]

     AAE Rel. 2070; File No. 3-11571)

FRANKLIN  ADVISERS, INC. TO PAY $50 MILLION AND UNDERTAKE COMPLIANCE  REFORMS
TO SETTLE SEC CHARGES CONCERNING MUTUAL FUND MARKET TIMING

     On  August 2, the Commission filed settled administrative and cease  and
     desist  proceedings  against  Franklin  Advisers,  Inc.  (Franklin),   a
     registered  investment  adviser for many of  the  mutual  funds  in  the
     Franklin  Templeton  Investments (FT) complex.  The  Commission's  order
     finds  that  Franklin violated the federal securities laws  by  allowing
     improper market timing in FT funds.  Under the settlement, Franklin will
     pay a civil penalty of $20 million, pay disgorgement of $30 million, and
     undertake  compliance  measures  designed  to  protect  against   future
     violations.  The penalty and disgorgement amounts will be distributed to
     shareholders of the FT funds affected by the market timing.
     
     The  Commission's  order finds that Franklin engaged  in  the  following
     misconduct:
     
       ú    During at least 1996-2001, Franklin followed an undisclosed practice
          under which it approved requests to conduct market timing in a manner that
          conflicted with certain guidelines in FT mutual fund prospectuses.
       
       ú    During 1998-2000, Franklin allowed a representative of a broker-dealer
          to market time a fund that prohibited investments by market timers.
     
       ú    Franklin failed to disclose that over 30 identified market timers were
          allowed to freely market time for several months in 2000, contrary to
          prospectus language that indicated market timing would be monitored and
          restricted.
     
       ú    After other identified timers were told to stop their activities in
          September 2000, Franklin gave one favored timer permission to continue to
          time $75 million in assets with unlimited trades for several more months.
     
       ú    Also after September 2000, Franklin gave a known market timer permission
          to  time a mutual fund that prohibited investments by market timers
          simultaneously with the timer making a $10 million investment in a new hedge
          fund.
     
     The order finds that Franklin violated Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the
     Investment  Advisers  Act of 1940 and Section 34(b)  of  the  Investment
     Company  Act  of  1940, and requires Franklin to cease and  desist  from
     violating  these provisions.  Franklin consented to entry of  the  order
     without  admitting  or denying the findings.  (Rels. IA-2271;  IC-26523;
     File No. 3-11572)
     
RONALD  HOFFMAN, CPA, REINSTATED TO APPEAR AND PRACTICE BEFORE THE COMMISSION
AS  AN  ACCOUNTANT  RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PREPARATION OR  REVIEW  OF  FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS REQUIRED TO BE FILED WITH THE COMMISSION

     Pursuant  to  Rule 102(e)(5)(i) of the Commission's Rules  of  Practice,
     Ronald  H.  Hoffman, CPA, has applied for and been granted reinstatement
     of  his  privilege  to appear and practice before the Commission  as  an
     accountant  responsible  for  the preparation  or  review  of  financial
     statements  required to be filed with the Commission.  Mr. Hoffman,  who
     was   denied  the  privilege  of  appearing  or  practicing  before  the
     Commission  on  April  30, 1997, pursuant to a settled  proceeding,  has
     represented  that he has complied and will continue to comply  with  the
     terms  of the order that denied him from appearing or practicing  before
     the  Commission  as  an  accountant.   Mr.  Hoffman's  reinstatement  is
     effective immediately.   (Rel. 34-50135; AAE Rel. 2071; File No. 3-9304)

DIVISION  OF  ENFORCEMENT SEEKS PENNY STOCK BARS AGAINST  HAROLD  HARRIS  AND
RONALD CREWS
     
     On  August  3,  the  Commission  instituted  administrative  proceedings
     pursuant  to  Section 15(b)(6) of the Securities Exchange Act  of  1934,
     against  Harold F. Harris (Harris) and Ronald E. Crews (Crews) (together
     Respondents),  based  on  the  final judgment  and  injunctions  entered
     against  them  in  Securities and Exchange Commission  v.  U.N.  Dollars
     Corp., et al., 01-CV-9059 (S.D.N.Y.). The Commission's complaint in that
     case  alleged that Harris and Crews, as officers and directors  of  U.N.
     Dollars Corp., violated the registration and antifraud provisions of the
     federal  securities laws by participating in a scheme to manipulate  the
     price  and trading volume of U.N. Dollars Corp. common stock.  According
     to  the Commission's complaint, Harris and Crews improperly provided ten
     million shares of unrestricted stock to pay a manipulator to affect  the
     price  and  trading  of their company's shares, and  drafted  materially
     false  and misleading press releases to deceive investors and create  an
     artificial market for U.N. Dollars Corp. stock.
     
     On  March 13, 2003, the Honorable Allen G. Schwartz, U.S. District Judge
     for the Southern District of New York, entered final judgment of default
     against  Harris  and Crews and permanently enjoined them from  violating
     Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and  Section
     10(b)  of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.
     The  Court  also  ordered Harris and Crews to disgorge proceeds  of  the
     fraud and pay civil monetary penalties and barred Harris and Crews  from
     acting  as  an officer or director of any public company.   On  May  13,
     2004,  the  U.S.  Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit  affirmed  the
     entry of judgment by Judge Schwartz.
     
     A  hearing  will  be  scheduled before an administrative  law  judge  to
     determine  whether the allegations contained in the Order are true,  and
     in  connection  therewith,  to  afford  Respondents  an  opportunity  to
     establish  defenses to such allegations, and to determine whether  penny
     stock bars are appropriate and in the public interest.
     
     The  Order  requires the Administrative Law Judge to  issue  an  initial
     decision no later than 210 days from the date of service of this  Order,
     pursuant to Rule 360(a)(2) of the Commission's Rules of Practice.  (Rel.

SEC  ISSUES  A  CEASE-AND-DESIST ORDER AGAINST HALLIBURTON  COMPANY  AND  ITS
FORMER CONTROLLER AND FILES SUIT AGAINST HALLIBURTON'S FORMER CHIEF FINANCIAL
OFFICER  FOR FAILING TO DISCLOSE ACCOUNTING CHANGE THAT MATERIALLY  INCREASED
HALLIBURTON'S REPORTED INCOME

     On  August  3, the Commission announced that it filed a civil action  in
     federal  district  court,  and issued a cease-and-desist  order  (Order)
     relating  to Halliburton Company's (Halliburton) failure to  disclose  a
     change  to its accounting that materially increased its reported income.
     Halliburton  is a Texas-based provider of products and services  to  the
     petroleum and energy industries.  Halliburton and its former controller,
     Robert  C. Muchmore, Jr. consented to the cease-and-desist order without
     admitting  or  denying  the  findings in  the  Order.   Halliburton  and
     Muchmore also agreed to pay civil penalties of $7.5 million and $50,000,
     respectively.  The Commission's Order noted that the penalty,  in  part,
     reflects  the Commission's view that there were unacceptable  lapses  in
     the  company's conduct during the course of the investigation, which had
     the  effect  of delaying the production of information and documentation
     necessary to the staff's expeditious completion of its investigation.
     
     The  Commission finds in its Order that commencing in the second quarter
     of  1998,  Halliburton altered its accounting practice on several  large
     project  contracts so that it could begin offsetting cost overruns  with
     estimated  recoveries on claims it had not yet resolved with  customers.
     According  to  the  Order, although permitted under  Generally  Accepted
     Accounting Principles in appropriate circumstances, this practice was  a
     significant departure from Halliburton's longstanding public  disclosure
     regarding  its  recognition of claims revenue.   In  the  previous  five
     consecutive  years, dating back to 1993, Halliburton  disclosed  in  its
     Forms  10-K that it recognized revenue from such claims only  after  the
     claim  was resolved with the customer.  Pursuant to that practice, until
     the  claim  was  resolved the company recorded  losses  caused  by  cost
     overruns.
          
     The  Commission  finds in its Order that, as a result  of  Halliburton's
     undisclosed  change in accounting practice, cost overruns and  resulting
     losses  on  several  contracts were reduced  or  eliminated,  triggering
     material  increases to Halliburton's income: in its 1998 Form  10-K,  by
     46.1%, and in its Forms 10-Q for the second and third quarters of  1998,
     by  24.8%  and 5.7%, respectively, and in its Forms 10-Q for the  first,
     second   and  third  quarters  of  1999,  by  14.8%,  7.5%  and   11.6%,
     respectively.   Additionally, the change in  claims  recognition  policy
     materially enhanced Halliburton's publicly disclosed 1997-1998  quarter-
     to-quarter  income  comparisons.  Despite the  material  impact  of  the
     accounting change on Halliburton's reported income, the company did  not
     disclose the change until March 2000, in its 1999 Form 10-K - almost two
     years after the change went into effect.
     
     The  settled  Order  requires that Halliburton and  Muchmore  cease  and
     desist  from  committing or causing violations and future violations  of
     Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and that
     Halliburton  cease and desist from committing or causing,  and  Muchmore
     cease  and  desist  from causing, violations and  future  violations  of
     Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act)  and
     Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.

     In  its civil suit, the Commission charges Gary V. Morris, Halliburton's
     former  chief  financial officer, with violating Sections  17(a)(2)  and
     17(a)(3)  of  the  Securities Act and aiding and abetting  Halliburton's
     violations  of  the  reporting provisions of the Exchange  Act:  Section
     13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.
     Morris,  Halliburton's highest-ranking financial officer, bore  ultimate
     responsibility  for ensuring that Halliburton disclosed  its  accounting
     change.   The  Commission  alleges that  Morris  improperly  caused  the
     revenue related to this undisclosed accounting change to be reported  in
     Halliburton's  Commission filings, each of which he  signed.   Moreover,
     Morris  participated  in  the preparation of earnings  releases  and  in
     analyst  teleconferences in which Halliburton's net income was touted  -
     without  disclosure  of  the change in accounting  that  had  materially
     enhanced  the  net  income figures.  In its lawsuit, the  Commission  is
     seeking a permanent injunction and a civil money penalty against Morris.

     Division)];  [SEC  v. Halliburton Company and Robert  Charles  Muchmore,

     Rel. 2072; File No. 3-11574)

IN THE MATTER OF FIDELITY BROKERAGE SERVICES, LLC

     On  August  3, the Commission issued an Order Instituting Administrative
     And Cease-And-Desist Proceedings, Making Findings, And Imposing Remedial
     Sanctions Pursuant To Sections 15(b) And 21C Of The Securities  Exchange
     Act  Of  1934 (Order) against Fidelity Brokerage Services, LLC (Fidelity
     Brokerage).
     
     The  Order  finds  that  between January 2001 and  July  2002,  Fidelity
     Brokerage violated the broker-dealer record-keeping requirements of  the
     federal  securities  laws because employees in at least  21  of  its  88
     branch  offices altered or destroyed the firm's books and records.   The
     violations  related to Fidelity Brokerage's annual internal inspections,
     which  were designed to determine whether branch offices were  complying
     with  the  firm's policies and procedures, NYSE rules, and  the  federal
     securities laws.  The firm's managers pressured branch office  employees
     to  obtain  perfect  inspections and gave advance  notice  of  when  the
     inspections  would occur.  Certain Fidelity employees took advantage  of
     the  advance  notification and improperly prepared for the  inspections.
     In  preparing for these inspections, the employees discovered that  some
     branch  office  records were incomplete or not completed  in  accordance
     with  firm  policies  and  procedures.  The employees  then  altered  or
     destroyed  the  records so that the inspectors would  not  discover  the
     incomplete  records.   The  records included new  account  applications,
     letters of authorization, and variable annuity forms maintained  at  the
     branch offices.  These actions were not discrete or isolated.  At  least
     62  employees engaged in some form of this conduct in at least 21 branch
     offices,  primarily  in the firm's Western region.  The  conduct  caused
     Fidelity  Brokerage  to  maintain inaccurate  or  incomplete  books  and
     records in violation of the federal securities laws.

     Based  on  the  above, the Order censures Fidelity, orders  Fidelity  to
     cease  and  desist  from committing or causing any  violations  and  any
     future  violations of Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act and  Rule  17a-4
     thereunder,  and  orders Fidelity to pay a civil money  penalty  in  the
     amount  of $1,000,000.  Fidelity consented to the issuance of the  Order
     without  admitting or denying any of the findings in the  administrative
     proceeding.  In determining to accept Fidelity's settlement  offer,  the
     Commission  considered remedial acts promptly undertaken and cooperation
     afforded  the  Commission staff.  The Commission also acknowledged  that
     pursuant  to  Fidelity's agreement with the NYSE in related proceedings,
     Fidelity  will pay a fine in the amount of $1,000,000 to the NYSE.   The
     Commission acknowledges the assistance of the NYSE in its investigation.
