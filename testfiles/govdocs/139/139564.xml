 <Description><![CDATA[The purpose of this study was to determine if spatially-explicit commercial timber inventories (CTI) could be used in conjunction with satellite imagery to improve timber assessments and forest biomass estimates in Amazonia. As part of a CTI, all commercial trees >45 cm DBH were measured and georeferenced in 3500 ha of a logging concession in NW Mato Grosso, Brazil. A scientific inventory was conducted of all trees and palms >10 cm DBH in 11.1 ha of this area. >20,000 trees were sampled for both inventories. To characterize vegetation radiance and topographic features, regional LANDSAT TM and ASTER images were obtained. Using a stream network derived from the ASTER-based 30 m digital elevation model (DEM), a procedure was developed to predict areas excluded from logging based on reduced impact logging (RIL) criteria. A topographic index (TI) computed from the DEM was used to identify areas with similar hydrologic regimes and to distinguish upland and lowland areas. Some timber species were associated with convergent landscape positions (i.e., higher TI values). There were significant differences in timber density and aboveground biomass (AGB) in upland (6.0 stems ha-1, 33 Mg ha-1) versus lowland (5.4 stems ha-1, 29 Mg ha-1) areas. Upland and lowland, and timber and non-timber areas could be distinguished through single and principal component analysis of LANDSAT bands. However, radiance differences between areas with and without commercial timber on a sub-hectare scale were small, indicating LANDSAT images would have limited utility for assessing commercial timber distribution at this scale. Assuming a 50 m stream buffer, areas protected from logging ranged from 7% (3rd order streams and above) to 28% (1st order and above) of the total area. There was a strong positive relationship between AGB based on the scientific inventory of all trees and from the commercial timber, indicating that the CTI could be used in conjunction with limited additional sampling to predict total AGB (276 Mg ha-1). The methods developed in this study could be useful for facilitating commercial inventory practices, understanding the relationship of tree species distribution to landscape features, and improving the novel use of CTIs to estimate AGB.  ]]></Description>

 <Publication_Abstract><![CDATA[We examined carbon export in whole logs and carbon accumulation as coarse woody debris (CWD) produced from forest damage during all phases of the first and second year of a certified reduced impact logging (RIL) timber harvest in southern Amazonia. Our measurements included a 100% survey of roads and log decks, assessment of canopy damage and ground disturbance in skid trails and tree-fall gaps and measurement of carbon exported from the site in logs. Log deck and road construction crushed one and five trees in the 10-60 cm. diameter at breast height (DBH) class per hectare logged, disturbed areas of 24 and 100 m^2ha^-1 , respectively, and together disturbed about 1% of the forest. On average, 1.1 to 2.6 trees ha^-1 were harvested over the two years. Logged gaps constituted the greatest disturbance on an area basis (4-10% of the forest) and CWD generation (1.9-4.4 Mg ha^-1 logged). In gaps, felled trees severed or crushed 10 trees >= 10 cm DBH per tree logged, which corresponded to 1.7 Mg ha^-1 of CWD per tree logged. Crown height- measured from the first bifurcation to the top of the crown- rather than tree height was the better predictor of gap size formed from tree felling (R^2 = 0.41). Logging activities significantly reduced leaf area in roads, log decks and gaps, with the greatest reduction (48%) in log decks and least in logged gaps and roads (28-33%) compared to undisturbed forest. A total of 37 species were harvested, with 36% of the total trees harvest and 48% of the total carbon exported from the site in three of the most common species. Logging damage produced 4.9-8.8 Mg C ha^-1 logged of CWD from all phases of the operation. Carbon export in whole logs (2.1-3.7 Mg C ha^-1 logged)represented 1-3 % of the total standing forest carbon  > = 10 cm DBH (138 Mg C ha^-1). The mean carbon ratio (per hectare logged) of C in CWD to C exported in logs was 2.4.  The disturbance, damage, carbon export and CWD data we present advances understanding of the effect of selective logging on tropical forest dynamics of hte Amazon Basin. Our results indicated that certified timber harvest in Amazonia under RIL is a viable forest management option to reduce damage and CWD production compared to conventional logging (CL) practices; however the benefits of disturbance reduction from RIL relative to CL are only realized at greater volumes of timber extraction]]></Publication_Abstract>

 <Data_Characteristics><![CDATA[Data were collected in logging concession at the Fazenda Rohsamar in the municipality of Juruena in northwestern Mato Grosso.  Estimates of damage associated with logging operations were made after logging operations were complete in 2003 and 2004.  Damage associated with gaps created by felling single trees was estimated in 54 individual gaps.  Stratified transects in two logging blocks were used to estimate damage associated with road building and skid trails.

 <Data_Acquisition_Materials_and_Methods><![CDATA[Logging Damage Transect Survey file: <br>Sampling was stratified to provide full coverage of each logging block- within a stratified area the transect start point was randomly selected. Twenty-six transects were established in Block 5 and 21 transects in Block 18 to assess frequency of damage by log skidders and tree felling. Intersection along a tape was measured for each type of damage. Transect sections (25 m) were assigned to one of three topographic positions (upland lowland or slope) based on estimates of hardwood vs. palms, slope and proximity to streams. Road and deck location in Blocks 5 and 18 were mapped with a GPS. Road width was measured at 11 random points and deck size was measured at 10 decks (representing 11% of the total). Total length and area in roads were calculated and maps produced using GIS (see ND11_Logging_Damage_Blocks_readme.doc)
<br><br>Logging Damage Gap Survey file: <br>Gap damage: to quantify the effect of tree fall following logging, damage was measured in 54 logged gaps formed by single logged trees. Characteristics of the tree harvested during gap formation (species DBH, commercial height, total height, canopy proportions) were recorded as well as damage to all surrounding trees and trees damaged or killed within each gap. Gap damaged trees were assigned to one of 9 classes based on the degree of damage. Gaps were defined as the actual projected canopy and gap area was measured using the center point system (Runkle 1982) based on the summation of the area of six triangles using the distance from the center of the gap to the edge to define the triangles.
