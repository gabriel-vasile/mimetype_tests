	<h2></h2>
	
	<p><p>In November  2006, Americans elected Democrats to take the country in a new direction, in  part because we pledged to seek better jobs and better pay for working  Americans.&nbsp;&nbsp; Six months into the 110th  Congress, Democrats are delivering on that promise.&nbsp; In May, after a ten year battle, Congress gave lower-income workers a  long overdue raise by increasing the federal minimum wage to $7.25/hour,  benefiting millions of workers and their families.&nbsp; Though a major victory for the American  people, there is much more work to be done.</p>  <p>As more and more  working Americans struggle to make ends meet, the ability to form a union is  key to the economic stability, health, and well-being of American  families.&nbsp; Union workers&rsquo; median weekly  earnings are 30 percent higher than those of non-union workers, union workers  are 63 percent more likely to have employer-sponsored health insurance, and  union workers are 77 percent more likely to have short-term disability  benefits.&nbsp; According to a recent poll,  nearly 60 percent of Americans would join a union if they could.&nbsp; (AFL-CIO, &ldquo;The Union Difference: Union  Advantage by the Numbers.&rdquo;)</p>  <p>Loopholes in our  current labor laws have left millions of workers vulnerable to aggressive  anti-union campaigns, in which unscrupulous employers intimidate, harass, and  even fire workers who try to form unions.&nbsp;  Even when they succeed in forming a union -- often despite intense  pressure from their employers -- nearly one-third of newly-organized workers are unable to enter into a collective  bargaining agreement.&nbsp; The widespread  failure to attain a first contract is due in large part to the lack of  effective penalties for employers that fail to bargain in good faith.&nbsp;</p>  <p>The <em>Employee Free Choice Act </em>(EFCA),  sponsored by Senate and House Democrats, would level the playing field and  restore workers&rsquo; freedom to form unions and collectively bargain by: 1)  strengthening penalties for companies that coerce or intimidate employees; 2)  establishing mediation and binding arbitration guidelines when employers and  workers cannot agree on a first contract; and 3) enabling employees to form  unions when a majority express their desire to do so by signing authorization  cards.</p>  <p>Despite the need  for reform, critics of EFCA continue to misinform the public about the bill and  hide the serious shortcomings of current labor law.&nbsp; Democrats are committed to setting the record  straight and passing this important legislation on behalf of American workers  and their families.&nbsp;</p>  <p><strong><em>MYTH: &nbsp;EFCA will prevent the use of secret-ballot  elections.</em></strong></p>  <p><strong><em>REALITY: &nbsp;</em></strong><strong>EFCA does not strip workers  of their right to choose a secret-ballot election to decide whether to select  -- or not to select -- a union representative. &nbsp;EFCA simply gives workers the additional  option of selecting a union representative by majority sign-up.&nbsp; </strong><br />  Under  the <em>National Labor Relations Act </em>(NLRA),  there are three ways for workers to form a union:</p>  <blockquote>  <p>1) <u>By  secret-ballot:</u> &nbsp;The National Labor  Relations Board (NLRB) will conduct a secret-ballot election to select a  bargaining representative if at least 30 percent of workers have signed a  petition or authorization cards in favor of a union.&nbsp; If a majority of workers voting select a  particular union, the NLRB will certify that union as the employees&rsquo; bargaining  representative.&nbsp; EFCA does not change  this process.&nbsp;</p>  <p>2) <u>By  voluntary card-check recognition:</u> &nbsp;An  employer can voluntarily decide to recognize a union representative if a  majority of employees have signed authorization cards in favor of the union.&nbsp; EFCA does not change this process.&nbsp;</p>  <p>3) <u>By  NLRB-ordered recognition:</u> &nbsp;As a last  resort, the NLRB can order an employer who has engaged in unfair labor  practices that make a fair election unlikely to recognize a labor union if a  majority of employees have signed authorization cards in favor of the  union.&nbsp; EFCA does not change this  process.&nbsp;</p>  </blockquote>  <p>EFCA would simply add a  fourth choice for workers seeking to form a union.&nbsp; The legislation would require the NLRB to  certify a union representative if a majority -- more than half -- of workers sign  authorization cards in favor of the union.&nbsp;</p>  <p>The majority sign-up, or  &ldquo;card-check,&rdquo; option would simply streamline the union selection process for workplaces  that have a majority of workers who want to join a union.&nbsp; This is the same majority that would be  voting in a secret-ballot election.&nbsp;  Moreover, the majority sign-up process already exists, but only if the <em>employer</em> chooses to recognize it.&nbsp; EFCA would extend the right to select a union  representative via the majority-sign up process to <em>workers </em>themselves.&nbsp;</p>  <p><strong><em>MYTH: &nbsp;Secret-ballot elections are the fairest way to  select a union representative.</em></strong></p>  <p><strong>REALITY:&nbsp;Secret-ballot elections in  the union context can leave employees vulnerable to virtually un-checked  employer intimidation and coercion. &nbsp;</strong></p>  <p>Under current  law, once workers have petitioned the NLRB to hold a secret-ballot election,  there is no set timetable for holding that election.&nbsp; Employers who are determined to prevent the  formation of a union often use this period to threaten, discriminate against,  de-mote, dock the pay of, and even fire pro-union employees.&nbsp; Studies have shown that one-quarter of private-sector  union organization drives result in employee firings, and one out of every five  workers who openly advocate for a union is fired.&nbsp; Unfortunately, current law includes weak  remedies that fail to deter employers from engaging in these practices.&nbsp; At best, the NLRA will order the employer to  stop its wrong-doing and reinstate an improperly fired employee and force the  employer to pay back-pay, that is, unless the employee has found a job in the  interim.&nbsp;</p>  <p>EFCA would  toughen the penalties against employers who engage in these unfair labor  practices.&nbsp; In addition to ordering an  employer to stop the practices, the legislation would require employers to pay  employees who are fired as a result of union organizing activity, during an  organizing campaign or first contract drive, treble damages (i.e. back-pay, plus liquidated damages two times that  amount.).&nbsp; The bill would also impose  civil fines of up to $20,000 per violation against employers who willfully or repeatedly  violate workers&rsquo; rights in forming a union.&nbsp;</p>  <p><strong><em>MYTH: Secret-ballot  elections are the most democratic way to choose a union.</em></strong></p>  <p><strong>REALITY:&nbsp;Though EFCA gives workers  the choice to select a secret-ballot election<em> or</em> the majority sign-up process, these secret-ballot elections are  nothing like our federal, state, or local candidate elections. &nbsp;The NLRB&rsquo;s election process, for example, stifles  free speech and democratic debate by restricting the ability of unions and  pro-union workers to communicate with employees, while allowing employers free  access to workers every day.&nbsp; </strong></p>  <p>Unlike other elections,  where candidates are allowed equal access to voters during the campaign, current  labor laws allow employers to bar unions from the workplace and refuse access  to employee contact information until just days before the election.&nbsp; While strict limits apply to when and where  pro-union employees can campaign to form a union, employers can require workers  to attend anti-union meetings during work hours, one-on-one or in a group.&nbsp; Employers may also direct supervisors, who  control pay and promotion, to deliver anti-union messages to workers and attach  anti-union literature to paychecks. &nbsp;A  recent survey found that employees who have gone through the NLRB election  process are twice as likely to report employer coercion as those who  participated in a majority sign-up process.&nbsp;</p>  <p>EFCA would give  workers the option to choose a different, simpler, and fairer method of union  selection -- majority sign-up, which reflects a key tenet of Democracy -- majority  rule.&nbsp;</p>  <p><strong><em>MYTH: &nbsp;Majority sign-up is untested and will increase  intimidation and harassment of workers by labor unions.</em></strong></p>  <p><strong>REALITY: &nbsp;Majority sign-up has been well-tested for over  70 years.&nbsp; Further, under EFCA, worker  intimidation and/or coercion by any party, including unions, will remain  strictly prohibited.&nbsp; </strong></p>  <p>Majority sign-up is nothing new.&nbsp; Workers have been forming unions through  majority sign-up since 1935.&nbsp; The method  for obtaining authorization cards is already established and used via the  voluntary card check recognition <em>and</em> the secret-ballot election processes.&nbsp; Indeed,  more workers form unions via card check than via secret-ballot elections.&nbsp; In 2004, approximately 375,000 workers joined  AFL-CIO unions through majority sign-up, while approximately 73,000 workers  used the NLRB election process.&nbsp;&nbsp; (AFL-CIO,  &ldquo;Over 70 Years of Experience with Majority Sign-up.&rdquo;)&nbsp;</p>  <p>While the critics of EFCA claim that,  under the legislation, unions may intimidate workers, under current law,  employers, employees, <em>and</em> unions are  barred from engaging in unfair labor practices.&nbsp;  Improperly obtained authorization cards are already invalid and cannot be  counted towards majority sign-up.&nbsp; Moreover,  in more than 70 years, there have been very few instances of fraud or  misrepresentation in obtaining card signatures.&nbsp;  Nevertheless, to ensure the integrity of the card check process, EFCA  would require that the NLRB develop  guidelines for selecting a bargaining representative via majority-sign up,  including model language for authorization cards and procedures to verify the  validity of authorization cards.&nbsp;</p>  <p><strong><em>MYTH</em></strong><strong><em>: &nbsp;EFCA  would require &ldquo;public&rdquo; union card signings.</em></strong></p>  <p><strong>REALITY:</strong><strong> &nbsp;EFCA would preserve current confidentiality  requirements</strong>, which  require the NLRB to keep authorization cards and the identity of signers  confidential to protect workers from employer retaliation.&nbsp;</p>  <p><strong><em>MYTH</em></strong><strong><em>: &nbsp;EFCA  will &ldquo;silence&rdquo; employers.</em></strong></p>  <p><strong>REALITY:</strong><strong> &nbsp;Nothing in EFCA alters the rights of  employers to speak-out against a labor union.&nbsp; </strong></p>  <p>Under the  legislation, employers would still be free to campaign against a union, as long  as they do not threaten or intimidate workers.&nbsp;  EFCA only strengthens penalties for employers who engage in unfair labor  practices.&nbsp;</p>  <p><strong><em>MYTH</em></strong><strong><em>: &nbsp;EFCA&rsquo;s  mediation/arbitration guidelines will force unwanted contracts on employers and  employees.&nbsp; </em></strong></p>  <p><strong>REALITY:</strong><strong> &nbsp;EFCA does not force unwanted first contracts  on parties acting in good faith; the legislation, however, would give parties an incentive to come to the bargaining table. </strong></p>  <p>Under current  law governing the first contract process, there is no effective penalty for  refusing to bargain with newly certified union representatives. &nbsp;As a result, employers may &ldquo;stonewall&rdquo; the  first contract and effectively block the benefits of a labor union.&nbsp; A recent study found that 34 percent of union  election certifications do not result in a contract for workers. &nbsp;</p>  <p>To get parties to the table, EFCA provides  a starting schedule and a framework for negotiations. The parties have a  minimum of 90 days to bargain on their own and may extend negotiations for as  long as they need to.&nbsp; If the  negotiations are unsuccessful, either party can seek help from a mediator with  the Federal Mediation and Conciliation  Service (FMCS), which enjoys an 86 percent success  rate.&nbsp; If after 30 days mediation fails  to result in a first contract, FMCS can refer the dispute to an arbitration  panel, but the parties can still extend the period by mutual agreement or agree  to return to the bargaining table.&nbsp; Only  if the parties agree to arbitration and arbitration fails to result in a first  contract will the arbitration panel impose contract terms on the issues the  parties have not yet decided.&nbsp; Even then,  the contract is only binding for two years and can be amended by written  consent of the parties.&nbsp;</p> <P></p>
