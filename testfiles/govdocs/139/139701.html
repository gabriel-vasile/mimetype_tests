             2.     STANDARD FORMAT AND CONTENT FOR
                        EMERGENCY PLANS

2.1  Introduction

     Emergency Management Programs for each DOE site/facility and Operations/Field Office
     are documented in an emergency plan, which describes the provisions for responses to
     Operational Emergencies.  Recommended emergency plan format and content for both
     Operational Emergency Base Programs and Operational Emergency Hazardous Material
     Programs are provided in this chapter.  Every DOE site/facility is required to have a Base
     Program.  A site/facility with no Hazardous Material Program would develop an
     Emergency Plan for the Base Program; the Base Program requirements for a hazardous
     material site/facility should be seamlessly integrated with the Hazardous Material
     Emergency Plan.

     Section 2.2 contains a recommended format and content for a Base Program emergency
     plan.  Section 2.3 addresses the format and content of the Hazardous Materials Program
     emergency plan.  Both plans address the same topical and functional areas, but the Base
     Program plan only explicitly addresses the minimum requirements specified in the Order,
     while more extensive requirements of the Base Program derived from other sources (e.g.,
     other DOE orders, Federal/state regulations, local ordinances) can be referenced.  Base
     Programs with substantial response requirements (i.e., those having organizational
     structures and functions similar to a hazardous material program) may use the more
     detailed plan structure addressed in Section 2.3.

     Facilities/sites also have the option of following the National Response Team's guidance
     on Integrated Contingency Planning, also known as the "One-Plan".  The One-Plan is a
     cooperative effort by the 16 member agencies of the NRT to illustrate how a facility can
     develop one emergency response plan to address the myriad of emergency planning
     requirements.  Using the One-Plan guidance to address the requirements of DOE O 151.1
     and other federal requirements is encouraged.  The guidance is available in the Federal
     Register and on the NRT's web site at http://www.nrt.org.

     Base Program.  Section 2.2 provides a candidate format and associated content for the
     Base Program Emergency Plan.

          what is included in each chapter.

     TABLE OF CONTENTS

          See Figure 2.1.

     1.   INTRODUCTION

          State the overall function and mission of the site.  Broadly describe the site and
          the buildings and facilities within the site.  Use maps as appropriate to describe
          the site.  Do not use classified information.  State the maximum number of
          employees in each facility described.  Provide facility floor plans where
          appropriate.

          The qualitative Hazards Survey establishes the scope of the Operational
          Emergency Base Program required at a site by identifying potential hazards,
          possible consequences, and the applicable emergency planning and preparedness
          requirements.  Include or summarize the results of the Hazards Survey.  Describe
          known hazards originating outside the DOE facility that could affect the health
          and safety of onsite personnel or other DOE interests.

     2.   EMERGENCY RESPONSE ORGANIZATION (INTERNAL)

          List the individual (e.g., building manager, facility manager, or similar position)
          who has been assigned to manage and control all aspects of the site/facility
          planning, preparedness, and response.

     3.   OFFSITE RESPONSE INTERFACES

          Outline any and all coordination with state, tribal, and local agencies and
          organizations responsible for emergency response and/or protection of the health
          and safety of the public.  If there is no offsite coordination, provide a brief
                    justification statement.

     1.1  Purpose of Emergency Plan.

          State that the purpose of this Emergency Plan is to provide the DOE community
          with an effective and efficient emergency management operation that will provide
          acceptable levels of protection.  For example, the Emergency Plan provides an
          efficient and effective response operation that, should an emergency occur, will
          protect the health and safety of workers, responders, the public, and the
          environment.  State the DOE Orders and legislation that require this plan and
          that this Emergency Plan satisfies.  Describe the operational use of the
          Emergency Plan and Emergency Plan Implementing Procedures (EPIPs).  

          1.1.1     Update of Emergency Plan.

               State the process and time table for Emergency Plan updates, including
               required periodic updates and updates made necessary by changes in
               emergency planning or site operations.

          1.1.2     Distribution of Copies.

               Identify which organizations, DOE and non-DOE, are to receive copies of
               the Emergency Plan.

     1.2  Scope.

          State the types of emergencies, per DOE O 151.1, to which this Emergency Plan
          applies and does not apply.  (Emergency Plans generally are for Operational
          Emergencies and not Energy or Emergency Assistance emergencies.)  Identify the
          boundaries and define the site to which this Emergency Plan applies (i.e., site
          emergency plan versus building or facility Emergency Plan).  
               
     1.3  Concept of Operation.
