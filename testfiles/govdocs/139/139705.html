		</TABLE><BR><BR><B>Narrative: </B>This is a comprehensive base-line or
		screening examination for all body systems, not just specific conditions
		claimed by the veteran. It is often the initial post-discharge examination of a
		veteran requested by the Compensation and Pension Service for disability
		compensation purposes. As a screening examination, it is not meant to elicit
		the detailed information about specific conditions that is necessary for rating
		purposes. <B>Therefore, all claimed conditions, and any found or suspected
		conditions that were not claimed, should be addressed by referring to and
		following all appropriate worksheets, in addition to this one, to assure that
		the examination for each condition provides information adequate for rating
		purposes</B>. This does not require that a medical specialist conduct
		examinations based on other worksheets, except in the case of vision and
		hearing problems, mental disorders, or especially complex or unusual problems.
		<B>Vision, hearing, and mental disorder examinations must be conducted by a
		specialist</B>. <BR><BR> The examiner may request any additional studies or
		examinations needed for proper diagnosis and evaluation (see other worksheets
		for guidance). All important negatives should be reported. The regional office
		may also request a general medical examination as evidence for
		nonservice-connected disability pension claims or for claimed entitlement to
		individual unemployability benefits in service-connected disability
		compensation claims. Barring unusual problems, examinations for pension should
		generally be adequate if only this general worksheet is followed.<BR><BR> <B>A.
