<h1>2004 President's Quality Award Program <br>Criteria and Application Information</h1>
<h3>PRESIDENTIAL AWARD FOR MANAGEMENT EXCELLENCE</h3>
<p>The Office of Personnel Management proudly announces the 2004 President's Quality Award Program.  In his management agenda, President George W. Bush has focused on several Governmentwide priorities for enhancing service to the American people.  This award program focuses on those priorities and recognizes the accomplishments of organizations that further the Administration's objectives.  Organizations will be recognized for their <b>performance</b> and <b>results</b>.  They will serve as role models and benchmarks for other organizations to attain similar success - so together we will attain President Bush's vision of a Government that is citizen-centered, results-oriented, and market-based.  </p>
<h4>AWARD CATEGORIES</h4>
<ul><li><p>Agencies that are scored under the President's Management Agenda (PMA) Scorecard and meet the required baseline status score(s) can apply under all three categories.  Agencies that are not scored under the PMA Scorecard can apply only for category one award. </p></li></ul>
