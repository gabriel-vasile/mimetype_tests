        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Reviewers will be looking for evidence of cultural competence in each section of the Project Narrative. Points will be assigned based on how well you address the cultural competence aspects of the evaluation criteria. SAMHSA&rsquo;s guidelines for cultural competence can be found on the SAMHSA web site at <a href="http://www.samhsa.gov/">www.samhsa.gov</a>. Click on &ldquo;Grant Opportunities.&rdquo;</p>

          <p>Clearly state the purpose, goals and objectives of your proposed project. Describe how achievement of the goals will address both the overall program purpose as specified in the NOFA and the needs you have identified in Section A. Provide a logic model (see Glossary) that links need, key components of the proposed project, and goals/objectives/outcomes of the proposed project.</p>
        </li>    
          <li>            Identify the evidenced based practice that you propose to implement. Describe the evidence-base for the proposed practice and show that it incorporates the best objective information available regarding effectiveness and acceptability. Follow the instructions provided in #1, #2 or #3 below, as appropriate. Depending on the evidence you provide, you may follow more than one set of instructions:<strong></strong>
            <p><u> 1. If you are proposing to implement a practice included in NREPP (see Appendix C), one of the CMHS tool-kits on evidence-based practices (see Appendix D), the list of Effective Substance Abuse Treatment Practices (see Appendix E), or the NOFA (if applicable), simply identify the practice and state the source from which it was selected. </u>You do not need to provide further evidence of effectiveness. </p>
            <p> <u> 2. If you are providing evidence that includes scientific studies published in the peer-reviewed literature or other studies that have not been published, describe the extent to which: </u></p>
            <ul>
              <li>the practice has been evaluated and the quality of the evaluation studies (e.g., whether they are descriptive, quasi-experimental studies, or experimental studies)</li>
              <li>the practice has demonstrated positive outcomes and for what populations the positive outcomes have been demonstrated</li>
              <li>the practice has been documented (e.g., through development of guidelines, tool kits, treatment protocols, and/or manuals) and replicated</li>
              <li>fidelity measures have been developed (e.g., no measures developed, key components identified, or fidelity measures developed) </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>   
        <blockquote>
          <p> 3. <u>If you are providing evidence based on a formal consensus process involving recognized experts in the field, describe: </u> </p>
        </blockquote>        <ul>
          <ul>
            <li>the experts involved in developing consensus on the proposed service/practice (e.g., members of an expert panel formally convened by SAMHSA, NIH, the Institute of Medicine or other nationally recognized organization). The consensus must have been developed by a group of experts whose work is recognized and respected by others in the field. Local recognition of an individual as a respected or influential person at the community level is not considered a &ldquo;recognized expert&rdquo; for this purpose.</li>
            <li>the nature of the consensus that has been reached and the process used to reach consensus</li>
            <li>the extent to which the consensus has been documented (e.g., in a consensus panel report, meeting minutes, or an accepted standard practice in the field)</li>
            <li>any empirical evidence (whether formally published or not) supporting the effectiveness of the proposed services/practice</li>
            <li>the rationale for concluding that further empirical evidence does not exist to support the effectiveness of the proposed services/practice</li>

            <p>Describe the nature of the problem and extent of the need for the target population based on data. The statement of need should include a clearly established baseline for the project. Documentation of need may come from a variety of qualitative and quantitative sources. The quantitative data could come from local data or trend analyses, State data (e.g., from State Needs Assessments), and/or national data (e.g., from SAMHSA&rsquo;s National Household Survey on Drug Abuse and Health or from National Center for Health Statistics/Centers for Disease Control reports). For data sources that are not well known, provide sufficient information on how the data were collected so reviewers can assess the reliability and validity of the data.</p>

            <p> 1. <u>If you are proposing to implement a service/practice included in NREPP (see Appendix C), one of the CMHS tool-kits on evidence-based practices (see Appendix D), the list of Effective Substance Abuse Treatment Practices (see Appendix E), or the NOFA (if applicable),</u> simply identify the practice and state the source from which it was selected. You do not need to provide further evidence of effectiveness. </p>
            <p> 2. <u>If you are providing evidence that includes scientific studies published in the peer-reviewed literature or other studies that have not been published, describe the extent to which: </u></p>
            <ul>
              <li>the service/practice has been evaluated and the quality of the evaluation studies (e.g., whether they are descriptive, quasi-experimental studies, or experimental studies)</li>
              <li>the service/practice has demonstrated positive outcomes and for what populations the positive outcomes have been demonstrated</li>
              <li>the service/practice has been documented (e.g., through development of guidelines, tool kits, treatment protocols, and/or manuals) and replicated</li>
              <li>fidelity measures have been developed (e.g., no measures developed, key components identified, or fidelity measures developed</li>

            <li>the experts involved in developing consensus on the proposed service/practice (e.g., members of an expert panel formally convened by SAMHSA, NIH, the Institute of Medicine or other nationally recognized organization). The consensus must have been developed by a group of experts whose work is recognized and respected by others in the field. Local recognition of an individual as a respected or influential person at the community level is not considered a &ldquo;recognized expert&rdquo; for this purpose.</li>

        <p> NOTE: Although the<strong></strong> budget for the proposed project is not a review criterion, the Review Group will be asked to comment on the appropriateness of the budget after the merits of the application have been considered.</p>
        <h3> 2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS </h3>
        <p>SAMHSA applications are peer-reviewed according to the review criteria listed above. For those programs where the individual award is over $100,000, applications must also be reviewed by the appropriate National Advisory Council.</p>
        <p>Decisions to fund a grant are based on:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>the strengths and weaknesses of the application as identified by peer reviewers and, when appropriate, approved by the appropriate National Advisory Council;</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>availability of funds; </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>equitable distribution of awards in terms of geography (including urban, rural and remote settings) and balance among target populations and program size; and </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>after applying the aforementioned criteria, the following method for breaking ties: When funds are not available to fund all applications with identical scores, SAMHSA will make award decisions based on the application(s) that received the greatest number of points by peer reviewers on the evaluation criterion in Section V-1 with the highest number of possible points (for Phase I, Proposed Evidence-Based Practice&mdash;30 points; for Phase II, Need, Justification of Best Practice, and Readiness&mdash;30 points). Should a tie still exist, the evaluation criterion with the next highest possible point value will be used, continuing sequentially to the evaluation criterion with the lowest possible point value, should that be necessary to break all ties. If an evaluation criterion to be used for this purpose has the same number of possible points as another evaluation criterion, the criterion listed first in Section V-1 will be used first.</li>
