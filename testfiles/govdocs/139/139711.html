            <p> Final Proposals will be requested at the invitation of EPA, after 
              review of Initial Proposals. </p>
            <p>An invitation to submit a Final Proposal for one grant program 
              is not indicative of an invitation to submit a proposal for all 
              grant programs.</p>
            <p>Applicants must submit separate proposals for each grant program 
              for which they receive an invitation. Applicants should not resubmit 
              their Initial Proposals. Generally, Final Proposals should be between 
              7 and 10 pages in length, not including attachments. Final Proposal 
              attachments should be kept to a minimum. You should not resubmit 
              attachments provided in the Initial Proposal. EPA will not review 
              or evaluate attachments such as strategies or plans developed for 
              other programs, newspaper articles, and videotapes. Information 
              in these types of attachments should be distilled and incorporated 
              into the responses to criteria.</p>
            <p>The final proposal for each type of grant funding should consist 
              of the following:</p>
          
            <ul>

        <p>Assessment Grant Proposal Budget (a maximum of 15 points may 
                be received for this criterion)</p>
              <p>Provide the proposed budget(s) for your proposal. Note that you 
                must provide separate budgets for funds intended for use on petroleum-contaminated 
                sites and funds intended for use on sites contaminated by hazardous 
                substances, pollutants, or contaminants (including hazardous substances 
                co-mingled with petroleum). The budgets should show the distribution 
                of funds, including cost estimates for each of the proposed activities.</p>
              <p>A local government may use up to 10 percent of its grant funds 
                for monitoring the health of populations exposed to one or more 
                hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants from a brownfield 
                site and monitoring and enforcement of any institutional control 
                used to prevent human exposure to any hazardous substance, pollutant, 
                or contaminant from a brownfield site. To effectively oversee 
                assessments and cleanups, local governments may use grant funds 
                (subject to the 10 percent limit) for other related program development 
                and implementation activities.</p>
              
            <p>Typical tasks might include &quot;Phase I Assessments,&quot; &quot;Community

        <p><sup>1</sup> EPA defines equipment as items that cost $5,000 or more 
          with a useful life of more than one year. Items costing less than $5,000 
          are considered supplies.<br />
                <sup>2</sup> Applicants must comply with the procurement procedures contained 
                in 40 CFR 31.36, or for nonprofits, with 40 CFR 30.40.</p>
              <p>Assessment Grant Criteria</p>
              <p>Provide responses to the following assessment ranking criteria:</p>
              <p>Note: Many of the criteria are common to all three types of grants. 
                Applicants may copy responses to common criteria and provide these 
                responses in the appropriate place for each type of grant requested. 
                Final proposals will be submitted separately for each type of 
                grant and will be reviewed independently, so each proposal must 
                stand on its own merits.</p>
              
        <p>A. Sustainable Reuse of Brownfields/Development Potential (a maximum 
          of 15 points may be received for this criterion)<br />
          <br />
                1. Describe your vision for promoting sustainable reuse of brownfields 
                and preventing the creation of future brownfields. Describe how 
                you will implement this vision and how it will protect and restore 
                the quality of the natural environment, improve the quality of 
                life for the community, broaden prospects for future generations, 
                and help reduce resource consumption.</p>
              <p> 2. Describe the redevelopment plans for the sites or targeted 
                areas, and how those plans fit into your community's master plan, 
                economic development plan, or economic development activities.</p>
              <p> 3. Describe how this project will stimulate economic development, 
                including the creation of jobs, capital investment, and increases 
                to the local tax base.</p>
              <p>B. Reduction of Threats to Human Health and the Environment (a 
                maximum of 20 points may be received for this criterion)</p>
              <p> 1. Describe how the funds will be used to address/facilitate 
                the identification and/or reduction of threats to human health 
                and the environment within the target area (including cancer, 
                asthma, or birth defects) that may be associated with exposure 
                to hazardous substances, pollutants, contaminants, or petroleum.</p>
              <p> 2. Describe how, by conducting the activities mentioned in B.1. 
                above, your actions could affect the environment. If your actions 
                could affect the environment, describe the alternatives you would 
                use to mitigate the environmental impacts of your actions.</p>
              <p> 3. Describe sensitive populations (e.g., children, pregnant 
                women, minority or low-income communities, etc.) in the community 
                surrounding the target area or site(s) and how you derived this 
                information.</p>
              <p> 4. Describe how the funds provided by this grant will be used 
                to address/facilitate the identification and/or reduction of threats 
                to the health and welfare of these sensitive populations.</p>
              <p> 5. Describe whether you are working with your local public health 
                department to ensure that public health issues are considered 
                during the redevelopment process.</p>
              <p>C. Reuse of Existing Infrastructure (a maximum of 15 points may 
                be received for this criterion)</p>
              <p> 1. Describe whether the project will use existing infrastructure 
                (e.g., public transportation, utilities, buildings) or require 
                its expansion.</p>
              <p> 2. Describe whether the project will encourage the development 
                or redevelopment of properties with existing infrastructure and 
                describe the infrastructure that may be reused.</p>
              <p>D. Greenspace/Open Space (a maximum of 15 points may be received 
                for this criterion)</p>
              <p> 1. Describe the extent to which a grant would facilitate the 
                creation, preservation, or addition to a park, greenway, undeveloped 
                property, recreational property, or other property used for nonprofit 
                purposes. </p>
              <p> 2. Explain how this project integrates other efforts to improve/redevelop 
                brownfields, including ongoing project(s) proposed under this 
                grant.</p>
              <p>E. Community Involvement (a maximum of 20 points may be received 
                for this criterion)</p>
              <p> 1. Describe how you involved the local community in the development 
                of this proposal. Provide a list of the community-based organizations 
                involved and a contact person, phone number, and a brief description 
                of the organization's activities and representation (these organizations 
                may include, but are not limited to, local citizen groups, environmental 
                organizations, civic organizations, local business groups and 
                institutions, educational institutions, and local labor organizations).</p>
              <p> Note: EPA may conduct reference checks to ensure that organizations 
                identified are supportive and involved with the brownfields project.</p>
              <p> 2. Describe your efforts and/or plans to develop partnerships 
                at the local, state, and/or tribal level with other stakeholders 
                to ensure appropriate and sustainable cleanup and redevelopment 
                of brownfields.</p>
              <p> 3. Discuss your plan for involving the local community (e.g., 
                neighborhood organizations, citizens' groups, borrowers, redevelopers, 
                and other stakeholders) in cleanup decisions or reuse planning. 
              </p>
              <p> 4. Describe the means by which you will communicate the progress 
                of your project to citizens, including plans for communicating 
                in languages indigenous to the community.</p>
