    <h1>Lesson Plans</h1>
    <p>Educators and scientists working with NOAA developed a series of lesson plans for students in Grades 5 - 12 that are specifically tied to the science behind the Deepwater Coral Expedition: Reefs, Rigs, and Wrecks. These lesson plans focus on cutting-edge ocean exploration and research using state-of-the-art technologies.</p>
    <p>In addition to being tied to the National Science Education Standards and the Ocean Literacy Essential Principles and Fundamental Concepts, the hands-on, inquiry-based activities include focus questions, background information for teachers, links to interesting Internet sites, and extensions. Web logs that document the latest discoveries and complement the lesson plans, complete with compelling images and video, will be sent back each day from sea. Teachers are encouraged to use the daily logs from the Deepwater Coral Expedition: Reefs, Rigs, and Wrecks, which are posted on this site, to supplement the lesson plans.</p>
    <p>Read a description of each lesson plan and/or download them to your computer. All of the lesson plans are available in a PDF format, and may be viewed and printed with the <a href="http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/rediroutoe.cgi?url=http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html" title="free Adobe Acrobat Reader">free Adobe Acrobat Reader</a>. To download a lesson plan, click on its title from the listing below. (Note: if you have problems downloading one of these lessons, right-click on the link and save the lesson to your desktop.)</p>
