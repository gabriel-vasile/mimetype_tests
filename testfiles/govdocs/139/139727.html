	<h1><center><b><u>Hydromania's Ecology Unit <br>and the Oregon Benchmarks</u></b></center></h1>
	<blockquote>
	<p style="font-size=15;">The following chart travels through the Water Unit, tying it to the <a href="http://www.open.k12.or.us/os2000">Oregon Benchmarks 2000</a> (this will link you to the <i>Oregon Public Education Network</i> website) that are addressed by that unit.  Sometimes only parts of a particular benchmark will be applicable to a <b>Hydromania</b> unit, but we thought it best to cite the entire benchmark for easier reference to these state goals.  Please note also that because a lesson can be taught and expanded on at many levels of thoroughness, benchmarks were included assuming the <i>most thorough</i> coverage of the topic.  Therefore, each teacher will want to review the listed benchmarks in order to see for her/himself which ones are in agreement with their plans.  Hopefully you will find this to be a helpful and timesaving tool as you help students rise to the challenge of meeting these goals.</p>
