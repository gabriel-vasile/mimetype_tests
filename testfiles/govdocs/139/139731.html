    <h1>Lesson Plans for Exploring Ancient Coral Gardens Expedition</h1>
    <p>Educators and scientists working with NOAA developed a series of lesson plans for students in Grades 5 - 12 that are specifically tied to the science behind the Exploring Ancient Coral Gardens Expedition. These lesson plans focus on cutting-edge ocean exploration and research using state-of-the-art technologies.
    </p><p><strong>The lesson plans are grouped into the following categories:</strong><br />
        <a href="#Grades56" title="Grades 5-6">Grades 5-6</a><br />
        <a href="#Grades78" title="Grades 7-8">Grades 7-8</a><br />
        <a href="#Gradeshs" title="Grades 9-12">Grades 9-12</a> (Chemical, Biological, Earth, and Physical Science)<br />
            <a href="#other" title="other">Other Relevant Lessons</a><br />
    </p>
    <p>In addition to being tied to the <a title="NSF guidelines" href="http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/rediroutoe.cgi?url=http://coexploration.org/oceanliteracy/documents/OceanLitConcepts_10.11.05.pdf" target="window_name">National Science Education Standards and the Ocean Literacy Essential Priniciples and Fundamental Concepts</a>, the hands-on, inquiry-based activities include focus questions, background information for teachers, links to interesting Internet sites, and extensions. Web logs that document the latest discoveries and complement the lesson plans, complete with compelling images and video, will be sent back each day from sea. Teachers are encouraged to use the daily logs from the Exploring Ancient Coral Gardens Expedition, which are posted on this site, to supplement the lesson plans.</p>
    <p>Read a description of each lesson plan and/or download them to your computer.
      All of the lesson plans are available in a PDF format, and may be viewed
      and printed with the free <a title="Adobe Acrobat Reader" href="http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/rediroutoe.cgi?url=http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html" target="window_name">Adobe
