CDS - FOT MEETING MINUTES


##########################################################

SUMMARY

CDS is a complex instrument that may make use of all the 
different methods of commanding. The sub-commutation of 
their VC0 telemetry is based on modulo(4) of the packet 
counter. They will provide database layouts, telemetry 
layouts, critical parameters to monitor, Procedure 
sequencing and details for GSCT.

-- Document provided.  AI closed.

CDS-2 - To provide screen layouts for telemetry parameters 
to be displayed by POCC.
-- Document provided.  AI closed.

CDS-3 - To provide the subset of critical parameters to be 
monitored by the FOT.

PURPOSE
--To define Flight Operations Team (FOT) activities for 
TESTING.

INSTRUMENT:  CDS
ATTENDEES:  Jeff Payne (CDS-RAL), Eric Sawyer (CDS-RAL), L. 
Sanchez (ESA), S. Vaghi (ESA), G. Escande (Matra), K. 
Walyus (NASA), E. Larduinat (NASA-SOC), C. Cazeau (NASA-
FOT), C. St.Cyr (NASA-EOF)
DATE:  14 Sep 94
LOCATION:  The PortaCabine, Matra, Toulouse.

BACKGROUND

We request that each experimenter provide the following at 
these meetings:

-- Suggested screen layout for all VC0 mnemonics for this 
instrument

-- "English language" versions of each procedure that the 
FOT will send during testing (ELISA procedures may also be 
provided as reference material)

There are three tests scheduled between the spacecraft and 
the NASA Ground System:
- Ground System Compatibility Test #2 in Jan 95 with SOHO 
at Matra 
- Ground System Compatibility Test #3 in April 95 with SOHO 
at Matra 
- Launch Site Test in July 95 with SOHO at Cape Canaveral.

The time allocated for these tests is extremely limited.  
The POCC can only command a single experiment at a time -- 
there is no provision for simultaneously running procedures 
for all instruments, as is done during an SFT.  Therefore, 
the purpose of these two tests will not be to recreate an 
SFT.  Instead, the goal of this testing is to insure that 
the ground system can successfully command and monitor the 
spacecraft and payload.

The ELISA Procedures for the instruments are scheduled for 
delivery to NASA in the December 1994 Spacecraft Users' 
Manual (SUM).  Therefore, we must rely on the experimenters 
to provide input for any Ground System testing activities.  
We address these activities through this questionnaire.


##########################################################


(1) Will this instrument participate in these tests?  

-- Yes.


(2) TELEMETRY PROCESSING ACTIVITIES


(a) Describe any super-commutation or sub-commutation in 
VC0 telemetry.

-- It is decommutated as one of four (4) templates.  The 
packet counter (0-256) is used to define the template.  The 
sub-commutation depends on the value of the packet counter 
Modulo 2 or Modulo 4.  The condition field in the SDB 
(MOCON) is used to specify the validity of each parameter 
in the packet.


(b) Define the telemetry page(s) layout you would like to 
see on the POCC system.

-- CDS would like to reproduce their EGSE Housekeeping 
pages (approximately 6).


(c) Define the subset of telemetry points that the FOT will 
monitor for this instrument.  What is the mnemonic?  Are 
the limits that the POCC will receive in the SDB accurate 
for test?  What action should be taken by the FOT in "out-
of-limits" situation?

-- TBD.  Will be provided.


(d) Describe differences in the limits in the SDB between 
test and flight.

-- The ³test limits² specified in the SDB should be used as 
the initial set of flight limits.


(3) COMMANDING ACTIVITIES


(a) Activity requests to the FOT will be via a SOHO 
Activity Request form (see example)

-- Discussed.


(b) Define each TSTOL Procedure that the FOT will send for 
this instrument.  (See Appendix to Flight Operations Plan 
"TSTOL Style Guide")

-- The experiment has the following modes: OFF, SNOOZE, 
STANDBY, READY-GIS, READY-VDS, READY-BOTH, EXEC-GIS, EXEC-
VDS.  Mode changes except OFF to/from SNOOZE can be 
performed via OBDH Block from the EOF


Procedure Names:

POWER OFF To SNOOZE MODE 
RECOVERY-returns to SNOOZE mode from any condition

EMERGENCY-quick way to turn-off

SAFE-

SNOOZE to Power OFF

- Description of Approval Cycle and Configuration 
Management for Procedures

-- Description of Procedure testing
Proc will be syntax and logic-checked in POCC system.
Proc will be run against Ground System Simulator to insure 
consistency with database.
**Simulator does not provide any fidelity for instruments**

Procedure name for Test will be X_TS_XXXXXXXX

English language script (or clearly commented ELISA code) 
will be required.

For each TSTOL Procedure:
Are there system or instrument constraints to be monitored 
before sending this Procedure?
What telemetry points can be monitored to verify the 
response of this Procedure?
Does a representative from your instrument need to be 
present in order to send this Procedure?

-- TBD


(c) Describe the instrument activities to be performed 
using the EOF near-realtime throughput (NRT) commanding 
channel.

-- Discussed.  NRT commanding will be used.  Details are 
TBD.


Will the Remote Procedure Request (RPR) be used?  

-- Yes.  TBD.


Will the Remote Command Request (RCR) be used?  

-- Yes. TBD.


(d) Describe the instrument activities to be performed 
using Delayed Commanding.

-- TBD. Most commanding will be performed during NRT.


(e) Describe any use of the Background Queue (for large 
table loads).

-- Possible use. TBD.


OTHER TOPICS:

Hazardous commands discussion.  

-- 


(4) OTHER POSSIBLE TEST ACTIVITIES


(a) Describe any constraints of switching telemetry modes 
(Low, Medium, High).

-- None known.


(b) Describe any constraints of switching between High rate 
telemetry modes.

-- None known.


(c) Describe any constraints of switching telemetry sub-
modes.

-- As it now stands, the EGSE operator will have to be 
notified. CDS will investigate changing its own EGSE 
software to handle accepting all possible APIDs that they 
may produce.


(d) Describe any constraints associated with the OBT 
distribution

-- None identified.  CDS only requires the LOBT 
distribution at Power Up (TBC)


(e) Describe any constraints of the Inter-Instrument Data 
Exchange.

-- This will have to be coordinated during the daily 
planning meeting so that CDS will have the correct software 
loaded to act as either Master or Receiver prior to FOT 
commanding.


(f) Describe any constraints of using the Daily Pulse.

-- The daily pulse is ignored by CDS.


(5) FUTURE ACTIVITIES FOR FLIGHT

(a) Any necessary modifications to (1) through (4).

-- 

(b) Describe the state of the Experiment Operations Manual 
(EOM).

-- The only current version is quite old (the Green Book).


(c) Describe the timeline for commissioning activities of 
this instrument.

-- Submitted to Project Scientist's office.


(d) Describe any constraints associated with Thruster 
Operations.

-- CDS will close aperture door and probably change power 
dissipation to insure thermal stability.


(e) Describe any known jitter created by this instrument.

-- CDS pointing system does cause jitter according to 
models (possibly as much as 0.2-0.3 arc sec for other 
instruments).  The experiment is sensitive to jitter 
produced by other experiments.


(f) Describe any special pointing accuracy requirements for 
this instrument.

-- All observations require nominal pointing.


(g) Can this instrument provide relevant information to 
Flight Dynamics regarding - absolute pitch, yaw, or roll?

-- Yes for pitch and yaw (within ~10 arc sec) 
simultaneously reported every 8 seconds.


(h) Describe any anticipated power dissipation changes for 
this instrument.

-- Should always be within EID-B specifications.  It varies 
from mode-to-mode, and within a mode. An example was 
identified above as door closed during maneuvers. This 
should not be a concern for other experiments since CDS is 
isostatically-mounted.
