DOE Guides are part of the DOE directives system and are issued to provide supplemental information regarding the Department’s expectations of its requirements as contained in rules, Orders, Manuals, Notices, and regulatory standards.  Guides are used to identify Government and non-Government standards and methods that DOE finds acceptable for implementing its requirements.  Guides are not substitutes for requirements, nor do they replace technical standards that are used to describe established practices and procedures for implementing requirements.

PREFACE


Preservation and protection of America’s cultural heritage are important functions and responsibilities of the Federal government for properties under its control or jurisdiction.  The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) recognizes its stewardship responsibilities for managing the cultural resources on DOE-owned and other lands that are impacted by DOE programs.  Concern for this public trust has prompted the development of a DOE-wide cultural resource management (CRM) program for all DOE facilities and programs.  The goal of the program is to identify and consolidate compliance actions associated with a number of statutory and regulatory requirements and to reflect DOE’s commitment to meet not only the letter but also the spirit of these laws, Executive orders, and regulations.  One component of this program is the development of guidance documents that assist the field in meeting the policy goals for this agency.  
DOE P 141.1, Management of Cultural Resources, dated 5201, ensures that DOE programs, including the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) and field elements integrate cultural resources management into their missions and activities and raises the level of awareness and accountability among DOE (including NNSA) contractors concerning the importance of the Department’s cultural resource-related legal and trust responsibilities.  This policy helps ensure that DOE maintains a program that reflects the spirit and intent of the legislative and other mandates.  
DOE O 450.1, Environmental Protection Program, dated 11503, requires all DOE elements to implement Environmental Management Systems (EMS) as part of their Integrated Safety Management Systems (ISMS).  (See DOE P 450.4, Safety Management System Policy, dated 101596)  EMSs must include policies, procedures, and training to 
* identify activities with significant environmental impacts;
*  manage, control, and mitigate the impacts of these activities; and 
* assess performance and implement corrective actions where needed. 
 The Order specifically notes that the protection of cultural resources should be considered in EMSs [DOE O 450.1, paragraph 4b(1)(f)].  The accompanying discretionary guidance,  DOE G 450.1-1, Implementation Guide for Use with DOE O 450.1, Environmental Protection Program, dated 2-18-04, recognizes that many DOE sites have already implemented ISMSs and should, therefore, have most, if not all, of the elements of an EMS already in place.
DOE P 454.1, Use of Institutional Controls, dated 4903, delineates how DOE will use institutional controls to manage its resources, facilities, and properties.  Institutional controls may include administrative or legal controls, physical barriers or markers, and methods to preserve information and data.  The policy specifically notes that DOE uses a wide range of such controls to manage and protect the cultural resources under its control.  
DOE O 430.1B, Real Property Asset Management, dated 92403, describes DOE’s system for establishing a corporate, holistic, and performancebased approach to real property lifecycle asset management that links planning, programming, budgeting, and evaluation to program mission projection and performance outcomes.  It requires cultural asset management and historic preservation to be considered in land use and disposition plans [e.g., see DOE O 430.1B, paragraph 4b(3); paragraph 4e(2)(b); and Attachment 2, paragraph 6c(2)].  
On March 3, 2003, Executive Order (E.O.) 13287, Preserve America, was issued.  Its purpose is to encourage publicprivate historic preservation partnerships, improve Federal agency planning and accountability, enhance Federal stewardship of historic properties, promote the benefits of historic preservation, foster recognition of historic properties as assets with economic as well as intrinsic value, and support preservation through heritage tourism.  Under this Executive order, Federal agencies such as DOE shall maximize their efforts to integrate the policies, procedures, and practices of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) and this order into their program activities to advance historic preservation objectives while pursuing their missions efficiently and effectively.  
This Guide—Environmental Guidelines for Development of Cultural Resource Management Plans—Update—has been developed and updated by the Office of Air, Water and Radiation Protection Policy and Guidance under the Assistant Secretary for Environment, Safety and Health.  This guide imposes no requirements.  Its purpose is to provide guidelines to the DOE field managers who are responsible for development of an individual Cultural Resource Management Plan (CRMP) for each DOE facility and program.  Implementation of this Guide is intended to ensure that each DOE facility and program complies with the requirements set forth in the various Executive orders, statutes, implementing regulations, and DOE directives governing the management of cultural resources.  Thus, it provides recommendations, alternatives, and approaches for implementing those requirements.  As with all guidance, each site should consider its individual needs and tailor its CRMP to the unique conditions and requirements present at its site.

OVERVIEW OF DOE CRM PROGRAM AND GUIDELINES


DOE CRM PROGRAM OBJECTIVES

DOE recognizes its stewardship responsibilities for managing cultural resources on DOEowned and other lands that are impacted by DOE programs.1  Concern for this public trust has prompted the development of a comprehensive cultural resources policy, Department of Energy Management of Cultural Resources (DOE P 141.1), that requires implementation and maintenance of a Cultural Resource Management (CRM) program for all DOE facilities and programs.  There are statutory and regulatory bases for this program and an Agency commitment to meet not only the letter but also the spirit of these laws and regulations.  In addition, other DOE directives (e.g., DOE O 450.1; DOE P 454.1) guide DOE’s management and protection of cultural resources.  Thus, this Guide provides recommendations, alternatives, and approaches for implementing all those requirements.  
Recognizing this concern for the public trust and to implement DOE’s cultural resources policy, the Office of Air, Water and Radiation Protection Policy and Guidance, under the Assistant Secretary for Environment, Safety and Health, has developed a comprehensive CRM program for all DOE facilities or programs.  The program is designed to raise the level of awareness of DOE personnel with respect to the statutory and regulatory basis for, and the Department’s commitment to, cultural resource management.  
The cultural resource planning process must be integrated into compliance actions driven by other environmental statutes such as the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA); the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA); and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA).  The DOE CRM program structure encompasses—
* policy and guidance,
* planning, 
* implementation, 
* training and outreach, 
* quality assurance, and 
* technical mission/environmental coordination.  
This program encourages a proactive approach by DOE managers and their recognition of the cultural and scientific value of the resources that are under their jurisdiction.  
The DOE historian is the Department’s Federal Preservation Officer (FPO).  The Deputy Assistant Secretary for Environment has responsibility for developing DOEwide guidance for compliance with the various cultural resource statutes.  In addition, the Office of Air, Water and Radiation Protection Policy and Guidance and the DOE FPO coordinate CRM activities and standards for implementing DOE’s CRM program, including activities that affect Native American2 and other cultural resource sites and items.  
Comprehensive planning is especially important for DOE because it owns and potentially affects large land areas and because its lands and projects are distributed across a diverse geographic area.  Plans will improve the understanding of prehistoric, historic, and ethnic life and environments on DOE lands and ensure that DOE’s cultural resource policy is implemented appropriately.  Plans should also include studies of the technological histories of DOE facilities and programs and those of their predecessor agencies and include strategies for the preservation of representative properties, archives, and objects.  
The Office of Environment, Safety and Health guidance memorandum3 of February 23, 1990, addresses the need for developing cultural resource management plans (CRMPs) to ensure compliance with a number of CRM statutes and Executive orders.  As discussed in that memorandum, the development of a CRMP is required under Section 110(a)(2) of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA).  DOE P 430.1, Land and Facility Use Planning, dated 7996, defines the Department’s intent to manage all of its land and facilities as valuable national resources.  Thus, DOE sites are to implement a comprehensive land use planning process to complement, utilize, link, support, and fully integrate with the processes required by NHPA and related historic and cultural preservation laws, regulations, and Executive orders.  
These guidelines will assist managers in—
* taking a proactive role in managing the cultural resources under DOE’s responsibility; 
* ensuring and documenting compliance with applicable cultural resource laws, regulations, Executive orders (e.g., E.O. 13287), and DOE directives; 
* identifying and selecting qualified technical staff with regional expertise to prepare and implement the plan (e.g., archaeologists, ethnohistorians, historians, cultural anthropologists, and architectural historians that meet appropriate Federal and professional academic standards); 
* establishing historic preservation as an integral part of DOE’s environmental mission; 
* ensuring consistency in the cultural resource planning process among the facilities or programs; 
* enhancing contractor, facility, and program recognition of the cultural and scientific value of the resources that may exist on properties under DOE management; 
* establishing governmenttogovernment relationships and consultations with Native Americans who may be impacted by DOE activities, in accordance with DOE O 1230.2, American Indian Tribal Government Policy, dated 4892, and E.O. 13175, Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments dated 11600; 
* identifying and selecting appropriate technical experts following consultation with the affected tribal government, who may include tribal elders; and 
* improving consultations, interactions, outreach, and partnerships with municipal, county, state, and tribal governments, other Federal agencies, and interested persons.  
This Guide provides a format for the preparation of CRMPs.  Use of this format is voluntary; but it gives a means for structuring the CRMP review process.  As with all guidance, each site should consider its individual needs and tailor its CRMP to its unique conditions and requirements.  While some facilities already have cultural resource programs in place and others have unique land or project requirements, every effort should be made to prepare as complete a CRMP as possible or to demonstrate that responsibilities for the management of cultural resources are being carried out under another agreement.  
This Guide is a planning vehicle for ensuring that all compliance activities are being met and that interests of local, state, and tribal governments and other Federal agencies are part of this planning process.  Implementation of this Guide for specific land units supports the broader Department policy (see DOE P 141.1) that forms the basis for developing a comprehensive CRM program for all DOE facilities and programs.  
CRM STATUTORY AUTHORITIES
Principal Federal CRM statutes that apply to DOE actions on Federal, Indian, and tribal lands are—
* the Antiquities Act of 1906; 
* the Historic Sites Act of 1935; the NHPA of 1966, as amended; 
* the Archeological and Historic Preservation Act of 1974 (AHPA); 
* the American Indian Religious Freedom Act of 1978 (AIRFA); 
* the Archeological Resources Protection Act of 1979, as amended (ARPA); and 
* the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990 (NAGPRA).  
The principal Federal CRM statutes that apply to DOEfunded or -authorized actions on other nonDOE lands are NHPA, AHPA, AIRFA, and NAGPRA.  These four statutes would apply, for example, to DOEfunded research or restoration activities.  
Cultural resource statutes, regulations, and Executive orders that may directly affect DOE facilities or projects are listed in Appendix B.  >From a compliance perspective the combined effect of these Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations and their implementing guidance appear to be complex.  However, with a sound CRMP in use, objectives consistent with the facility or program mission can be efficiently met.  These laws establish a framework and delineate responsibilities for managing historic properties on Federal lands.  Taken together, these laws require Federal agencies to manage and protect what are defined in the legislation as historic properties, also commonly called “cultural resources.”  For purposes of this Guide cultural resources include, but are not limited to, the following broad range of items and locations:
* archeological materials (artifacts), ethnographic resources, and prehistoric and historic sites currently located on the ground surface or buried beneath it; 
* standing structures that are more than 50 years old or, if younger, are important because they represent a major historical theme or era;
* cultural and natural places, select natural resources, and sacred objects important to Native Americans; 
* American folk life traditions and arts; and 
* places significant to the facility’s history.  
Paleonotological specimens (i.e., fossils) are not considered to be cultural resources; however, they are protected by the Antiquities Act and, if found in association with archeological resources, by ARPA.  Protection of paleontological specimens should be addressed, as appropriate, in the ARPArelated preservation aspects of the planning process.  
A matrix (see Tables 1 and 2) has been developed that illustrates the statutory and regulatory basis for a DOE CRM program.  In these tables, specific components of the CRM program are correlated with the specific laws and regulations to define the regulatory basis for the DOE CRMP guidelines clearly.  
DOE CRM PLAN GUIDELINES
DOE operations office managers, field office managers, service center managers, project office managers and lead program secretarial officers (LPSOs) (including those of NNSA) have primary responsibility for implementing DOE’s cultural resources policy (DOE P 141.1 and DOE O 450.1).  Thus, they must ensure that the responsible DOE managers, including those in NNSA, develop, fully implement, and periodically review the CRMP at all DOE facilities and Governmentowned, contractoroperated facilities, as needed.  
Planning Responsibilities
Federal CRM statutes contain jurisdictional elements that establish where and when they apply.  When the lands or operations of a DOE facility or program meet any of these jurisdictional elements, a CRMP should be prepared for that facility or program.  Facilities or programs that manage very small amounts of land or have little potential for effecting cultural resources might have correspondingly less detailed CRMPs, but they would be in the same format as those of facilities or programs that manage large amounts of land with a greater potential to impact known and unidentified cultural resources.  
Alternative documentation may be prepared in lieu of a CRMP.  This documentation must address the elements and requirements of DOE’s CRM policy and DOE O 450.1.  The CRM program manager has the responsibility for determining the adequacy of the alternative documentation and for ensuring that the alternative documentation is appropriately integrated into EMS and EMS review.  
If the lands or operations of a DOE facility or program are not under the jurisdiction of any of the Federal CRM statutes, preparation of a CRMP is not required.  Facilities or programs that are not required to prepare a CRMP should document the absence of Federal jurisdiction and should be prepared to provide such documentation when requested to do so.  
In situations where all lands have been surveyed and no sites have been found to be eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places (the National Register), this finding should be reflected in the sections of the plan that deal with survey methods and the related aspects of compliance with the NHPA.  A similar process should be developed for addressing the absence of places of religious and traditional importance to Native Americans.  Documentation of the State or Tribal Historic Preservation Officer’s (SHPO’s or THPO’s) concurrence with these findings should be provided as an attachment to the plan or be readily available as supporting documents.  (See Section 6 of this guidance.) 
A CRMP is still necessary in these situations because unanticipated discoveries of cultural resources not located in the initial surveys may require compliance with NHPA (see Section 5.1.6 of this guidance).  In addition, ARPA, AIRFA, NAGPRA, and 36 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 79, Curation of Federally Owned and Administered Archaeological Collections, place CRM requirements on facilities and programs beyond compliance with NHPA.  
Plan Objectives
The objective of the CRMP is to ensure that cultural resources are managed effectively.  To do that, the CRM program manager must be aware of all ongoing or planned activities at the facility that may affect cultural resources.  In accordance with DOE P 141.1, the CRM program manager must ensure that cultural resources are addressed early in the planning process and that the proper coordination exists among all appropriate line and staff functions.  CRMPs are intended to serve as management tools for DOE managers with environmental compliance, contract management, and budgetary responsibilities.  This plan documents that the DOE manager is aware of all activities that may affect cultural resources and effectively ensures proper coordination by all appropriate line and staff functions, beginning with program or project inception.

DOE O 430.1B, Real Property Asset Management, describes the DOE system for establishing a corporate, holistic, and performancebased approach to real property lifecycle asset management that links planning, programming, budgeting, and evaluation to program mission projection and performance outcomes.  It requires cultural asset management and historic preservation to be considered in land use and disposition plans [e.g., see DOE O 430.1B, paragraph 4b(3); paragraph 4e(2)(b); and Attachment 2, paragraph 6c(2)].  It is essential to identify the points where the CRM program can be integrated into the overall DOE real property asset management process.  Draft DOE G 450.12, Implementation Guide for Integrating Environmental Management Systems into Integrated Safety Management System, dated 02-12-04, provides guidance on identifying “environmental aspects.”  Environmental aspects are defined as how the activities, products, and services of the organization may interact with the environment. For example, conducting an open or prescribed burn may disturb or impact cultural resources. This potential interaction is an environmental aspect.
Administrative Responsibilities
Administrative responsibilities for managing facility or program cultural resource program activities and implementing procedures should be specified in the CRMP.  The responsible managers in the contractor organization and DOE area and field offices must be identified.  These managers should develop a specific administrative structure and procedures for ensuring that coordination takes place among all project and program activities on lands to which the CRMP applies.  The systems approach of the ISMS/EMS can help integrate administrative structures and procedures.  
The designated managers should also develop a mechanism for integrating CRMP goals and administrative procedures into broader plans and procedures that control the implementation of site development planning; restoration actions; and compliance with health, safety, and environmental statutes, Executive orders, and DOE directives (e.g., DOE P 454.1).  Referencing the CRMP in these other documents to be used for conducting internal audits and establishing quality control systems is an appropriate way to comply with the DOE cultural resources policy (DOE P 141.1).  DOE O 450.1, Environmental Protection Program, states that part of integrating EMS into site ISMS is considering protection of cultural resources.  
As part of the CRMP, an internal quality assurance mechanism can form the basis for cooperative agreements with state, tribal, and other Federal agencies.  This quality assurance system is to be used for the internal management of contractors and technical individuals implementing the CRM programs at a DOE facility.  Draft DOE G 450.12 provides guidance on developing and maintaining procedures to monitor and measure progress of the ISMS/EMS. This process, commonly referred to as “checking and corrective action,” provides a systems approach to continuous improvement.
Facility- or program-specific CRMPs should be developed and implemented to meet the objective of DOE’s CRM program as described in this Guide.  Plan requirements at the facility or program level are intended to facilitate flexibility in the planning and development of detailed implementation procedures that suit the size and function of specific land holdings.  These plans should ensure that DOE managers consider, to the extent possible, both known and potential future cultural resource sites and items that may be impacted by daily operations, new construction, and remedial actions at DOE facilities or programs.  
DOE CRMP Review
The plan review process is intended to meet, in part, the quality assurance objectives of the DOE comprehensive CRM program.  CRMPs are subject to DOE’s guidelines implementing the information dissemination quality guidelines of the Office of Management and Budget (http://cio.doe.gov/informationquality/).  To ensure that the CRMPs remain useful to DOE managers and continue to be integrated into the longterm planning for facility or program operations, CRMPs should be reviewed and updated periodically, as appropriate, but at least every 5 years.  The cultural resource manager has the responsibility for developing measures for evaluating the success of the CRMP.  The Office of Environment, Safety and Health should be notified of updated plans, and an electronic version should be provided for posting on the cultural resource section of the office Web site.  
CRMP Format and Content
Existing CRMPs and related documents prepared or executed by the facility or program may fulfill some or all of the CRMP guidelines.  In this case, the pertinent section of the existing plan or document should be crossreferenced at the corresponding numerical designation and heading in the CRMP prepared by the facility or program in accordance with these guidelines.  In cases where large site and survey files have been compiled in separate documents, these large files may also be crossreferenced, and only summary tables provided in the appropriate sections.  
Parts 1 through 6 of this Guide provide the headings to be used for the development of DOEsitespecific facility or program CRMPs.  They also explain the kinds of information and administrative procedures that should be in place for the effective and efficient management of individual cultural resources.  The prescribed outline format is annotated to encourage consistency in the scope and content of the individual CRMPs.  
To the extent possible, CRMPs should follow the format and use the headings and subheadings presented in Parts 1 through 6.  The content of each of the six parts of the CRMP should be as follows:
* Part 1 consists of the executive summary and introduction.  
* Part 2 includes a discussion of short- and long-term goals.  
* Part 3 provides an overview of existing conditions and past CRM accomplishments.  
Part 4 discusses the technical requirements for complying with current cultural resource laws, regulations, and Executive orders and addresses current CRM goals, methods, and procedures for the ongoing management of facility- and program-impacted cultural resources.  
* Part 5 identifies administrative requirements for managing facility and program CRM activities to comply with specific executive, statutory, and regulatory authorities.  
* Part 6 contains or references supporting documents such as—
* cultural resource site, project, or other forms; 
* report outlines and bibliographies; 
* permits; contracts, memoranda, and agreements for curatorial services; 
* agreement forms for using collections; documentation for NAGPRA summaries; 
* treaties and cultural resource management cooperative agreements with tribal governments; and 
* Programmatic Agreements (PAs) with the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) and the SHPO or THPO.  
Appendix A of this Guide contains a glossary of terms relevant to cultural resource management and protection.  Appendix B lists laws, regulations, and Executive orders governing the management of cultural resources.  Appendix C references documents that will assist DOE facility managers and contractors in meeting their CRM compliance responsibilities.  


CRMP FORMAT AND CONTENT

DESCRIPTION OF PART 1 OF THE CRMP4
The CRMP should begin with an executive summary and an introduction.  The prescribed format and content of this preliminary information are as follows.  


EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The CRMP should include an executive summary that identifies the authorities under which the plan was prepared and provides a synopsis of the plan’s six major parts.  
1.  INTRODUCTION
The introduction should include, at a minimum, a statement of purpose and reference to the organization of Parts 2 through 6 of the plan.  The introduction should provide a brief overview of the short- and long-term CRM goals (Part 2); the history, status, and direction of the CRM program (Part 3); how the program is technically structured to achieve CRM goals (Part 4); and how program managers will administratively meet future CRM goals (Part 5).  The introduction should mention any supporting documents that are part of the plan and that are essential to its development or implementation (Part 6).  

DESCRIPTION OF PART 2 OF THE CRMP
Each CRMP should have a statement of CRM goals.  The prescribed format and content of the headings follow and should reflect the outline shown below.  


2.  CRM GOALS
This section should describe and discuss the goals of the DOE facility or program that is establishing a proactive CRM program.  General goals should reflect a clear intent to 
* achieve compliance with laws, regulations, Executive orders, and DOE directives related to cultural resources; 
* ensure that DOE stewardship responsibilities are being met; 
* enhance DOE managers’ awareness of and appreciation for cultural resource preservation and improve the effectiveness of their decision making; 
* promote outreach with traditional people who are the stakeholders in the local, natural and cultural resources and ensure their access to these resources; and 
* adopt an approach to protection of archeological resources that is consistent with the Department of the Interior’s National Strategy for Federal Archeology (http://www.cr.nps.gov/aad/TOOLS/NATlstrg.htm).  
DOE O 450.1 requires that ISMS/EMS include measurable environmental goals, objectives, and targets that are reviewed annually and updated when appropriate.  Goals established as part of a proactive CRM program may be used to satisfy this requirement of DOE O 450.1.  
Other facility or program goals should focus on maximizing the cultural and scientific value of the resources that remain on DOE-owned lands or on non-DOE-owned lands that may be affected either directly or indirectly by DOE actions.  Resources, however small and apparently insignificant, should be viewed as having the potential to contribute information to old and new questions being asked by the academic community, Native Americans, local historical organizations, and interested persons.  
This section should reflect the cultural and environmental baseline information provided in Part 3 of the plan.  Specific short- and long-term goals should be defined, and the rationale for their selection discussed.  Goals should be technical and administrative in nature.  
2.1 SHORT-TERM GOALS
Identify short-term management goals for both known and unidentified cultural resources located on the individual facility or program lands.  These goals should reflect current issues, problems, and deficiencies identified through an environmental aspects/impacts analysis (see draft DOE G 450.1-2) that are in need of immediate attention.  Short-term goals should be prioritized to reflect such issues as immediate stabilization and protection needs; determination of the locations of existing collections and records; consultation with Native American tribal governments, local historical organizations, local governments, the SHPO or THPO, and interested persons; and the development of administrative procedures to ensure that the site-specific goals are implemented.  
Assessments should be performed by technical experts with demonstrated regional expertise.5  If not already accomplished, development of a cultural resource research design that identifies key questions concerning the occupation and use of the facility or program area during the prehistoric and historic periods should be an important short-term goal.  Other suggested topics include, improvements in compliance procedures for a new construction project, automation of site and survey data/record management, identification of sensitive areas for Native American groups, stabilization of a particular site or structure, implementation of a new analytical procedure, location for the designated repository, and completion of cultural resource surveys for facility or program land holdings.  
2.2 LONG-TERM GOALS
Identify long-term goals that reflect how facility or program managers will meet their stewardship responsibilities and recognize the cultural and scientific values of the resources under their individual jurisdictions.  One important long-term goal should be evaluation and refinement of the existing facility or program cultural resource research design to ensure that it continues to be a coherent and defensible set of research questions.  
Particular attention should be given to the cultural items/sites, themes, and research topics identified by the SHPO or THPO, local historical organizations, experts in local academic institutions, and interested persons.  Interests and concerns of Native American tribal governments and traditional leaders and those of other ethnic groups should be considered throughout the cultural resource planning process.  DOE’s policy on Use of Institutional Controls (DOE P 454.1) delineates how DOE will use such controls to manage resources, facilities, and properties under its control.  The policy addresses DOE’s responsibilities related to its role as a steward of Federal lands and properties including protecting cultural resources.  


DESCRIPTION OF PART 3 OF THE CRMP
The CRMP should provide an overview of accomplishments and existing conditions.  The prescribed format and content of the headings and subheadings under this part follow and should reflect the numerical outline shown below.  In cases where large site and survey files and maps have been compiled in separate documents, these documents may be cross-referenced, and only summary information provided in this section.  


3.  EXISTING CONDITIONS
3.1 FACILITY OR PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS
3.1.1 Current Physical Setting
Provide a description of the physical setting of the facility or program, including its size.  Briefly describe the current natural environment at the facility or program area, addressing topics such as topography, geology, soils, vegetation, fauna, and climate.  Include environmental base maps, as appropriate, including information obtained using Geographic Information Systems (GIS).  Identify areas where the predevelopment natural environment remains intact.  Include maps of past and current land use, buildings, utilities, and roads.  
This description should be as comprehensive as possible and should indicate whether adequate information exists.  In cases where large site and survey files have been compiled in separate documents, these documents may be cross-referenced, and only summary information provided in this section.  
3.1.2 Current Operational Context
Briefly characterize the operational context of the facility or program and describe current activities.  Identify areas, buildings, and structures associated with specialized functions.  As part of the ISMS/EMS, this would be the environmental aspects identification.  
3.1.3 Potential Impacts to Cultural Resources
This section should be divided into two subsections:  past practices and planned activities.  It should explain the kinds of operational and remedial activities that potentially could disturb or destroy cultural resources that remain on the ground surface or buried beneath it.  An environmental aspect/impacts analysis identifies significant aspects at a site (i.e., interactions with the environment).  Draft DOE G 450.12 provides guidance on determining the significance of an environmental aspect. There is no scientific test for determining significance; however, activities with regulatory implications are usually deemed significant.

3.1.3.1 Past Practices
This section should focus on geographic areas of the facility, program, or lands that have been used by a program and that have experienced previous ground-disturbing activities (e.g., grading, filling, tree planting, building demolition).  Describe in detail—
* locations by disturbance type, 
* current use of the disturbed lands, and 
* information management tools for overall facility or program management (e.g., data compilations, computer databases, GIS).  
Describe, in general terms, the impact that past practices have had upon cultural resources.  
3.1.3.2 Planned Activities
This section should provide an overview of planned activities, including the following activities:  operational repairs and improvements, new construction, emergency repairs, remedial actions, and land transfers.  
Briefly identify and describe scheduled short- and long-term projects and their proposed locations.  Project schedules should include sufficient lead times to accommodate CRM planning and implementation activities in concert with overall project schedule requirements.  This section of the plan should be updated annually.  
3.1.4 Summary of Current Planning Procedure
This section should provide a brief summary of the facility’s or the program’s CRM program.  An explanation should be provided if a CRM program does not exist.  
The CRMP should reflect coordinated management of cultural resources if multiple administrative organizations use a specified land unit.  However, DOE projects and programs that have responsibilities involving complex land units in a wide variety of geographic areas may elect to prepare a programmatic CRMP to track the preparation of their input into facilityspecific CRMPs and ensure that their administrative responsibilities are being adequately carried out.  
3.1.5 Funding
Funding for cultural resource management planning and program implementation should be integrated into the normal operational budgeting process.  In some cases, the availability of funding may make it necessary to produce the CRMP in stages.  Individual compliance projects may be funded in various ways.  [For example, see Section 7(a) of the Archaeological Recovery Act of 1960 for budgetary guidance for construction projects.]
3.2 CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL SETTING
Each facility or program has a cultural and historical context created by human use of its physical location and natural resources.  Various cultural resources produced by this use are still extant today.  These resources may meet legal significance criteria that affect their management, and some resources may be important to Native Americans or other ethnic groups.  Include any pertinent introductory comments concerning the facility’s or the program’s cultural and historical setting.  Where appropriate, describe historic properties, particularly standing structures of architectural or scientific significance.  Emphasize properties related to the historic development of DOE.  DOE’s History Division can provide information and assistance.  
3.2.1 Historic and Prehistoric Environments
Summarize available information on historic and prehistoric environments of the facility or program area (e.g., existing environmental reconstructions based on macrobotanical, paleoecological, or faunal data).  
3.2.2 Prehistory and History
Summarize available information on the prehistory and history of the location of the facility or program.  Currently accepted classification systems and chronologies for the geographic region of the facility or program should be used in describing this information.  Examples of relevant topics are chronological periods, major events and dates, ethnic or cultural groups, group behavioral patterns, subsistence-settlement systems, technologies, and historically significant people.  
3.2.3 Traditional Lands and Resource Uses
Summarize available information on traditional land and resource uses by Native Americans or other ethnic groups in the facility or program area.  Examples of traditional land uses include religious usage areas, such as mountains used for vision quests, and locations with indigenous plants and animals that may be integral to religions, cemeteries, or burials.  
3.2.4 Treaties, Executive Orders, and Land Grants
Provide an overview of current government-to-government relations with Native Americans who retain legal rights to the geographical area where a facility or program is located.  Identify known treaties, Executive orders, and land grants that control these relations.  
3.2.5 Recent Scientific Significance
Briefly describe the recent scientific significance of the facility or program.  Identify facility mission, major scientific achievements, important events, dates, and people associated with these accomplishments.  The DOE historian may be an important source of information on the recent scientific significance.  Information provided by the Departmental History Program may be used in the preparation of this section and in the analysis of historical comments, official project and departmental records, and oral histories.  (EH232 Information Brief, Historic Preservation and the DOE Historian)
3.3 KNOWN CULTURAL RESOURCES
If cultural resources are known to exist at the facility or program area, this section should present information on their kind, number, and distribution.  Provide specific information on known cultural resources in the four subsections that follow.  (See Appendix A, Glossary, for definitions of the terms used for the general and specific types of cultural resources in the following subsections.)  The information on known cultural resources presented here should summarize the information contained in the facility or program cultural resource site records and in other sources (e.g., the National Register of Historic Places; state historic places registers; state, county, and local cultural resource site inventory files).  If the site has large land holdings and/or numerous resources and maintains an electronic database with GPS capabilities, indicate where and how this information is stored.  
The DOE Historic Preservation Officer (or designated review team) can perform an audit of the facility databases to determine whether a database can produce information necessary to support a request for a Section 106 review; maps showing surveyed and unsurveyed areas and distribution and density of sites by types; and a predictive model of likely site locations.  If cultural resources have not been recorded for the area in question, provide a statement about the probability of finding previously unidentified cultural resources that may remain on the ground surface or buried beneath it.  Describe evidence to support this conclusion.  
When large numbers of cultural resource sites are documented, lists, tables, or databases should be prepared to summarize this information.  Site data should be keyed to the site designation number and should specify, at minimum, the site type, age or period (if known), and National Register status (if applicable).  If lists, tables, or databases are used, individual descriptions also may be appropriate for special examples of a particular site type or for other important resource types not identified as sites.  Lists, tables, or databases should summarize the full cultural resource site records that are on file at the DOE facility or program area.  
The Archeological Resources Protection Act (ARPA) precludes public access to maps or other information concerning the nature and location of cultural resources under the Freedom of Information Act Title 5 United States Code (U.S.C.), Chapter 5, Subchapter II, or under any other provision of law unless certain conditions specified in the Act are met.  Sections of the CRMP that contain maps or other information of this type should be considered sensitive, and distribution should be restricted appropriately.  
3.3.1 Prehistoric Properties
Topics to be addressed include districts, sites, structures, objects, and other important prehistoric properties that are known to exist at the facility or program area.  

3.3.1.1 Districts, Sites, and Structures
Describe or list known prehistoric districts, sites, and structures at the facility or program area.  Provide or indicate sources for a map or maps of the facility or program area that show the location of those properties or reference databases where that information is available.  (See ARPA statement in Section 3.3, Known Cultural Resources.)
3.3.1.2 Objects
Describe or list any isolated or special prehistoric objects or object types recovered from or known to be present at the facility or program area.  Provide current locational information for these properties.  (See ARPA statement in Section 3.3.)  
3.3.1.3 Other Important Properties
Describe or list any other special prehistoric properties recovered from or known to be present at the facility or program area.  Examples of properties in this category are isolated features and important or unusual paleoenvironmental specimens.  Provide current locational information for these properties.  (See ARPA statement in Section 3.3.)
3.3.2 Historic Properties
Topics to be addressed include historic districts, sites, buildings, structures, objects, and other important historic resources that are known to exist at the facility or program area.  
3.3.2.1 Districts, Sites, Buildings, and Structures
Describe or list known historic and protohistoric districts, sites, buildings, and structures at the facility or program area.  Provide or indicate sources for a map or maps of the facility or program area that show the location of those properties or reference databases where that information is available.  (See ARPA statement in Section 3.3.)
3.3.2.2 Objects
Describe or list any isolated or special historic and protohistoric objects or object types recovered from or known to be present at the facility or program area.  Provide current locational information for these properties.  (See ARPA statement in Section 3.3.)
3.3.2.3 Other Important Properties
Describe or list any other special historic and protohistoric property types recovered from or known to be present at the facility or program area.  Examples of properties in this category are isolated features or objects and important or unusual environmental specimens.  Provide locational information for these properties.  (See ARPA statement in Section 3.3.)
3.3.3 Resources of Ethnic Importance
Topics to be addressed include sacred sites, traditional-use resources, Native American cultural items, and other resources of ethnic importance that are known to exist at the facility or program area.  Restrictions on publicizing site descriptions and locations are also discussed.  
3.3.3.1 Sacred Sites
Following consultation with Native American tribes, it may be appropriate to describe or list known sacred sites at the facility or program area.  There may be Native American tribes that will not release descriptions, lists, or maps of known sacred sites at any facility or program area.  Therefore, it is important for DOE to consult with individual tribal governments on a casebycase basis before each project commences.  The consultation process will determine the preferred strategy for managing sacred sites and the information that might be restricted, recorded, and published on each sacred site.  
When identifying and describing the locations and structures of sacred sites, exercise sensitivity to Native American and other ethnic concerns.  Descriptions of sacred sites and any maps showing the locations of these sites should be considered sensitive information and should not be included with any versions of the CRMP to which access is not appropriately restricted in accordance with legal requirements and agreements with Native Americans or other ethnic groups.  
3.3.3.2 Traditional-Use Resources
Describe or list known traditional-use resources at the facility or program area.  Provide or indicate sources for a map or maps of the facility or program area that show the location of resource areas or reference databases where that information is available.  Include references to appropriate treaty rights regarding specific resources (e.g., plants, animals, minerals, natural features).  (See ARPA statement in Section 3.3.)
3.3.3.3 Native American Cultural Items
Describe or list any Native American cultural items that recovered or known to be present at the facility or program area.  Describe categories of items and provide locational information for these items.  Discuss current procedures for consulting with Native American tribes to manage cultural items that remain in situ at the facility or program area.  
3.3.3.4 Other Resources of Ethnic Importance
Describe or list any other traditional resources of ethnic importance recovered from or known to be present at the facility or program area.  Provide locational information for these resources.  (See ARPA statement in Section 3.3.)
3.3.4 Properties of Recent Scientific Significance
Topics to be addressed include districts, sites, buildings, structures, other facilities, objects, and other properties at the facility or program area that are associated with scientific, engineering, and other technological themes of historical significance.  
3.3.4.1 Districts, Sites, Buildings, Structures, and Other Facilities
Describe or list the structures and other facilities of recent scientific significance at the facility or program area.  Provide or indicate sources for a map or maps of the facility or program area that show the location of those properties or reference databases where that information is available.  (See ARPA statement in Section 3.3.)  
3.3.4.2 Objects
Describe or list any objects of recent scientific significance at the facility or program area.  Examples of objects in this category include major pieces of equipment or apparatus.  Provide locational information for these objects.  (See ARPA statement in Section 3.3.)
3.3.4.3 Other Properties
Describe or list any other properties that have recent scientific significance at the facility or program area.  Provide locational information for these other properties.  (See ARPA statement in Section 3.3.)
3.4 CRM ACCOMPLISHMENTS
This section of the CRMP should address past accomplishments in the management of the cultural resources present at the facility or program area.  Accomplishments (i.e., achievements, deliverables) may exist in   records and reports, inventory, excavation, laboratory treatment, curation, preservation, research, outreach, and other CRM accomplishments.  Present any pertinent introductory information concerning the facility’s or the program’s CRM accomplishments.  Provide specific information concerning these accomplishments in the subsections that follow.  (See Appendix A, Glossary, for definitions of the terms used for general and specific types of CRM activities.)
When large numbers of CRM accomplishments are documented, use lists, tables, or databases to summarize projects by number (if assigned).  At a minimum, the following information should be provided:  the type of activity, the activity dates, the methods used, and relevant findings or other results.

DESCRIPTION OF PART 4 OF THE CRMP

 
	The CRMP should address CRM methods.  The prescribed format and content of the headings and subheadings under this part follow and should reflect the numerical outline shown below.  In cases where information about CRM methods has been compiled in separate documents, these documents may be cross-referenced, and only summary tables provided in this section.  


4.  CRM METHODS
There are several accepted, effective methods for developing CRM procedures for the facility or program.  Such methods apply to preparing and maintaining records and reports and conducting inventories, excavations, laboratory treatments, curation, preservation, and outreach.  In the following subsections, provide specific information concerning facility or program CRM methods.  (See Appendix A, Glossary, for definitions of the terms used in relation to CRM methodology.)
4.1 RECORDS AND REPORTS
This section should address methods for preparing and maintaining facility or program cultural resource records and reports.  Clearly indicate in Section 4.1.1 whether the existing cultural resource records and reports system described in Section 3.4.1, or some parts of that system, will continue in effect.  If not, indicate what parts will be changed and how (e.g., whether a GIS will be implemented).  
4.1.1 Cultural Resource Site Records
Describe the system to be used.  Address the cultural resource site form; site numbering system; site record cataloging system; site location mapping; and site record storage, access, and security.  Indicate in Part 6 of the CRMP how to obtain a copy of the cultural resource site form to be used.  Cultural resource site records must be maintained permanently at the DOE site.  Indicate how permanent, cumulative maintenance of records will be accomplished.  
4.1.2 Cultural Resource Project Records
Describe the system to be used.  Address the cultural resource project form; project numbering system; project record cataloging system; project location mapping; and project record storage, access, and security.  Indicate in Part 6 of the CRMP how to obtain a copy of the cultural resource project form or permit.  
4.1.3 Other Cultural Resource Records
Describe any other recordkeeping systems in addition to site and project records, to be used.  Include record categories (e.g., inventory, excavation, laboratory treatment, curation, preservation, research, outreach, legal compliance, other CRM activities) and the formats of record categories (e.g., notes, forms, photographs, drawings, and maps; record cataloging systems such as databases; records storage, access, and security).  Indicate in Part 6 of the CRMP how to obtain copies of any such forms.  
4.1.4 Cultural Resource Reports
4.1.4.1 Standardized Report Outlines
Describe any standardized format and content outlines for reports on facility or program CRM activities such as inventory or excavation.  Indicate in Part 6 of the CRMP how to obtain copies of any report outlines to be used.  
4.1.4.2 Report Library
Describe the system that will be used for acquiring, storing, protecting, and accessing copies of reports and other written documents dealing with cultural resources at the facility or program area.  
4.2 INVENTORY
This section should address methods for cultural resource inventories to be used at the facility or program area.  The methods should be appropriate for the specific cultural resource inventory conditions associated with the facility or program area and take into account the recommendations made by consulting tribal governments.  
4.2.1 Archival Searches
Describe the methods to be used for locating and retrieving information from archival records relating to cultural resources at the facility or program area.  The types of archival records known to exist for the facility or program area will help determine the types of archival search methods that are appropriate and how broad an area must be investigated (e.g., county, municipal, family records).  
4.2.2 Ethnographic Fieldwork
Describe the ethnographic fieldwork methods to be used for identifying and documenting resources of ethnic importance at the facility or program area.  The usefulness of different ethnographic methods (e.g., observing or interviewing participants) will depend on various characteristics of the groups that may have religious or other affiliations to cultural resources at the facility or program area.  For example, local families who have lived in the area for a long time and, thus, have continuity with its history could be identified and contacted even if they have moved out of the area.  In addition, treaty tribes and individuals must be included in the study, even tribes that are currently located in other states.  
Native American religions are not organized in a bureaucratic structure or hierarchy, such as nonNative American religions that generally have a national or international level of organization.  Interaction with Native Americans should take place through their individual tribal governments and the elder, traditionalist, or native practitioner designated by the tribe to address cultural/religious issues.  When ethnographic fieldwork involving the traditional lands and resources of several tribes will take place, it may be necessary to contact multiple tribal governments and their cultural/religious representatives.  
4.2.3 Structure and Facility Surveys
Describe the survey methods to be used for locating and recording buildings and other structures and facilities of historic or recent scientific significance at the facility or program area.  The survey methods used will be determined by the type and integrity of the buildings, structures, or facilities being recorded.  
4.2.4 Archeological Surveys
Describe the archeological survey methods to be used for locating and recording cultural resources at the facility or program area.  Describe the strategy for involving tribal elders, traditional leaders, and other technical experts recognized by the tribes in designing and implementing archaeological surveys.  Conservative approaches that avoid false negative findings and results are recommended.  Environmental conditions and cultural resource characteristics are important factors in developing the sampling procedure or selecting an appropriate method.  For example, shovel tests or surface stripping may be required to locate certain types of cultural resources at some locations, but not at others.  
In addition to addressing the types of archeological surveys that are appropriate at the facility or program area, identify all applicable coverage requirements, such as survey transect intervals and other statistically valid sampling strategies.  If shovel test surveys are to be conducted, identify the shovel test intervals to be used and the rationale for selecting each interval in locating previously unidentified sites.  If surface walkover is used in an arid environment or if plowing/disking is selected, identify the transect interval to be used and the rationale for selecting each interval in locating previously unidentified sites.  
The methods selected for site identification should be conservative and designed to locate the total range of site types and sizes, particularly in areas scheduled for new construction projects.  (See Appendix A, Glossary, for terms used to describe archeological survey methods.)
4.3 EXCAVATION
This section should address methods to be used for cultural resource excavations at the facility or program area and take into account the recommendations made by consulting tribal governments.  Methods should be appropriate for the specific cultural resource excavation conditions associated with the facility or program area.  Methods also should be selected to maximize the kinds and amount of data recovered.  
4.3.1 Test Excavations
Describe the methods for conducting test excavations of cultural resources at the facility or program area.

Describe the methods to be used for structure and facility documentation.  Identify the criteria to be used for selection of full Historic American Buildings Survey or Historic American Engineering Board documentation versus less exhaustive documentation.  
4.4.2 Maintenance
Describe the methods to be used for structure and facility maintenance.  Maintenance methods should be selected that will most effectively preserve the historic or scientific integrity of the structure or facility.  
4.4.3 Mitigation
Describe the methods to be used for structure and facility mitigation.  In addition to full Historic American Buildings Survey or Historic American Engineering Board documentation, methods should be identified that may potentially be used to mitigate the unavoidable loss of buildings or other structures or facilities of historic or recent scientific significance.  Dismantling and reconstructing a building, structure, or facility at a new location would be one potential mitigation method.  
4.5 LABORATORY TREATMENT
This section should address the laboratory treatment methods to be used for processing and analyzing cultural resources recovered at the facility or program area.  Methods should be appropriate for the specific types of cultural resources known to be present at the facility or program area and take into account the recommendations made by consulting tribal governments.  
4.1.1 
4.5.1 Processing
Describe the methods to be used for laboratory processing of cultural resources recovered at the facility or program area.

4.5.2 Analysis
Describe the methods to be used for laboratory analysis of cultural resources recovered at the facility or program area.  Discuss new analytical methods that could help to answer questions about the kind, number, and distribution of site types (e.g., petrographic analysis of ceramics, lithic microwear, blood residues, and spectrographic analysis of artifactual source materials).  If a particular facility or program has special analytical capabilities in an area that is well suited to cultural resource investigations, specialized research is encouraged in this technical area.  Discuss any new internal facilities or external arrangements with other institutions that will be necessary to analyze recovered materials effectively.  
4.6 CURATION
This section should address curation methods to be used for cultural resources recovered at the facility or program area.  (Cultural resources mean all categories of materials identified in 36 CFR Part 79, including organic material and environmental and chronometric specimens.)  The curation methods must be appropriate for the specific types of cultural resources known to be present at the facility or program area and take into account the recommendations made by consulting tribal governments.  It is particularly important to develop a strategy for involving tribal elders, traditional leaders, and other technical experts recognized by the tribes in the curation of items that a tribal government believes are culturally sensitive.

GLOSSARY 

APPENDIX A.  GLOSSARY12


Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP):  An independent Federal agency created by Section 106 of the NHPA.  Its mission is to promote the preservation, enhancement, and productive use of our Nation’s historic resources and to advise the President and Congress on national historic preservation policy.  ACHP is the only entity with the legal responsibility to encourage Federal agencies to factor historic preservation into Federal project requirements.  
Analysis:  Examination and classification of cultural resources or data about them.  Important types of analysis are typological (i.e., what a resource is), chronological (i.e., how old it is), technological (i.e., how it was made), functional (i.e., how it was used), and stylistic (i.e., what are important characteristics of its appearance).  
Archeological Research:  The scientific study of cultural resources through the analysis of prehistoric and historic material remains and data about them recovered during archeological surveys and excavations.  
Archeological Resource:  “Any material remains of past human life or activities which are of archaeological interest, . . . [including], but not . . . limited to:  pottery, basketry, bottles, weapons, weapon projectiles, tools, structures or portions of structures, pit houses, rock paintings, rock carvings, intaglios, graves, human skeletal materials, or any portion or piece of any of the foregoing items. . . . No item shall be treated as an archaeological resource under regulations under this paragraph unless such item is at least 100 years of age.” [ARPA, Section 3(1)]  
Archeological Survey:  The process used to locate and record basic information about prehistoric and historic cultural resources in the field.  Archeological survey methods include walking over the project area, walking over and shovel testing the area, and walking over the area following plowing and disking.  
Archeological Survey Report:  A cultural resource report that documents the methods, findings, and other important information about an archeological survey.  
Architectural or Engineering Survey:  The process used to produce or collect measured drawings, photographs, and written records that document historic buildings and structures, as well as objects such as equipment and apparatus.  The data gathering techniques involved may be required to meet the Historic American Buildings Survey or Historic American Engineering Record standards of the NPS.  
Archival Records:  Unpublished documentary records of human existence in the past that are deposited in archives.  Important types of archival information include historic period chronicles of Native American groups and sites; period descriptions of the construction, occupancy, and use of historic buildings and other structures; and documentary records of properties associated with recent scientific achievements.  
Archival Search:  The process used to locate and retrieve information relating to cultural resources from archival records.  
Area of Potential Effects:  “The geographic area or areas within which an undertaking may directly or indirectly cause alterations in the character or use of historic properties, if any such properties exist.  The area of potential effects is influenced by the scale and nature of an undertaking and may be different for different kinds of effects caused by the undertaking.”  [36 CFR Part 800, Protection of Historic Properties, Section 800.16(d)]

CRM DOCUMENTS OF DOE AND OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES


This appendix lists documents that will be of assistance to DOE facility managers and their contractors in meeting their cultural resource management (CRM) compliance responsibilities.  These documents serve several functions.  First, they compile appropriate Federal regulatory materials.  Second, the documents emphasize reasons for identifying, evaluating and protecting cultural resources and the importance of consulting with local, state, and Federal agencies and Native Americans when DOE activities might affect cultural resource sites and items.  Third, the documents identify the importance of developing written cultural resource management plans, a theme that runs throughout the Federal regulations and guidance [particularly the Annotated Guidelines for Federal Agency Responsibilities under Section 110 that are authorized by Section 101(g) of the National Historic Preservation Act].
