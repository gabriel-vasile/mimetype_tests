	Definition:
		A name, code, or date describing an event or period in geologic
		time, expressed either as an absolute date calculated using a
		named dating method, or as a relative date that is drawn from
		stratigraphy or biostratigraphy.
	Rationale:
		To provide the capability to describe the geologic dates
		relevant to a data set.  Calendar dates as provided in the ISO
		8601 dating system used in the standard CSDGM are not adequate
		to describe geologic time periods.  Absolute geologic time is
		usually measured in "millions of years" before present, but may
		use different units and relative base times.  Relative geologic
		time is measured by subdivisions of the earth's geology in an
		order based upon relative age, most commonly, vertical or
		stratigraphic position.  The actual dating systems used in
		geologic studies often tie relative times measured through
		stratigraphy or biostratigraphy to a particular absolute time
		using radioisotope dating techniques, among others.  As these
		methods for absolute dating have improved, the estimates of the
		dates for strata have changed, consequently, it would be
		inaccurate to record absolute dates in situations where
		relative dates were measured.  This structure is provided as an
		optional alternative to the standard calendar dates provided by
		ISO 8601.

	Definition:

		"Absolute" as the name of the time scale for measuring geologic
		dates before the present and names of geologic dating systems
		that are arrangements of symbols or names in order of relative
		geologic time.

		To provide the capability to completely and accurately describe

	Parent: Geologic_Age
	Optionality: mandatory
	Definition:
		Either an absolute geologic date or a relative geologic age
		name describing an event or period in geologic time based on
		the Geologic_Time_Scale.  For example, "300 Ma" (300 million
		years before present) is a Geologic_Age_Estimate based on the
		"Absolute" Geologic_Time_Scale, "C28r" is a chron name from the
		Geomagnetic Polarity Time Scale, and "Maastrichtian" and "
		Jurassic" are names from the International Geological Time
		Scale.  Since different relative geologic time scales are often
		not aligned, multiple geologic dates may need to be specified.
		For example, the Geomagnetic Polarity Time Scale chron "C29r",
		at the K/T boundary lies in both the Maastrichtian and the
		Danian stages from the International Geological Time Scale,
		thus if you were documenting this event using the International
		Geological Time Scale, both "Maastrichtian" and "Danian" should
		be included here.
	Rationale:
		To provide the capability to completely and accurately describe
		the geologic dates relevant to a data set.
