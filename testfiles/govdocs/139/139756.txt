What does this data set describe?
    Title: MAS/MILS mineral location database information 
    Abstract: 
    This coverage and associated databases contain data from selected fields of 
    five tables in the MAS/MILS database. This database was transferred to the 
    U.S. Geological Survey from the U.S. Bureau of Mines upon its closure in 
    1996. The database is considered archival and will be incorporated into the 
    U.S. Geological Survey mineral location database along with the MRDS 
    database. 
  How should this data set be cited?

  How does the data set represent geographic features?
    How are geographic features stored in the data set?
    This is a Point data set. It contains the following vector data types (SDTS 
    terminology): 
      Point (224096) 
    What coordinate system is used to represent geographic features?
    Horizontal positions are specified in geographic coordinates, that is, 
    latitude and longitude. Latitudes are given to the nearest unknown. 
    Longitudes are given to the nearest unknown. Latitude and longitude values 
    are specified in Decimal Degrees. 
    The horizontal datum used is North American Datum of 1927.
    The ellipsoid used is Clarke 1866.
    The semi-major axis of the ellipsoid used is 6378206.4.
    The flattening of the ellipsoid used is 1/294.98.

Why was the data set created?
  To provide searchable mineral locations for the U.S. Geological Survey Spatial 
  Data Delivery Website. 



How was the data set created?
  Where did the data come from?
    USBM/USGS (source 1 of 1) 
      U.S. Bureau of Mines, unpublished, MAS/MILS database.
      Type_of_Source_Media: digital 
      Source_Contribution: Previous repository for the data presented here. 
  What changes have been made?
    Date: 1998 (change 1 of 1) 
    Selected fields were extracted from the MAS/MILS database using and SQL 
    query. The information in the DLAT and DLON fields was used to create an 
    Arc/Info coverage (mas_sdd) using the GENERATE command. The SEQ field was 
    attached to the .pat feature attribue table using the JOINITEM command. The 
    information in all the ArcInfo tables were then turned into .dbf (dBASE) 
    format to create the mas1.dbf, name.dbf, state.dbf, commodity.dbf, and 
    reference.dbf files. The reference.dbf file was updated on 04/06/2001. All 
    tables except the state.dbf are linked by the SEQ field. The state.dbf links 
    to the mas1.dbf by the combination of STA and COU fields to form a unique 
    join. An ArcView shapefile called masmil.shp was created from the original 
    ArcInfo coverage (mas_sdd). All of the dbf files, except the state.dbf, can 
    be joined to the masmil.shp using the seq field as the relate key. 
    Data sources used in this process: 
      USBM/USGS 



How reliable are the data; what problems remain in the data set?
  How well have the observations been checked?
  How accurate are the geographic locations?
  How accurate are the heights or depths?
  Where are the gaps in the data? What is missing?
  Contains all locations in MAS/MILS database as of time of download. 
  How consistent are the relationships among the observations, including 
  topology?



How can someone get a copy of the data set?
  Are there legal restrictions on access or use of the data?
      Access_Constraints: None 
      Use_Constraints: 
      None. Acknowledgement of the U.S. Geological Survey would be appreciated.
