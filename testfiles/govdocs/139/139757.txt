PREFACE

Background

At its October 1994 meeting, the Depository Library Council to the Public Printer endorsed the self-study process and initial questionnaire proposed by the Library Programs Service (LPS).  This set of written questions is designed to assist documents staff as they critically review their operations.  It also gives them the opportunity to assess their compliance with Title 44, United State Code (U.S.C.), chapter 19, and GPO regulations in advance of a possible on-site audit.  This self-study can be a strategic assessment document which will walk the documents staff through issues such as collection development policy, compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), public access computer work stations, etc., which need careful consideration.

Purpose

This self-study has been developed as a component of the GPO's inspection of each depository library's Federal documents operation "where need is indicated" under 44 U.S.C. Section 1909.  Depositories will perform a mandatory self-evaluation that, in some cases, replaces an on-site inspection.

Citations to appropriate GPO-supplied publications which contain the rules and regulations for the Federal Depository Library Program appear at the end of the self-study document.  The self-study format and questions apply to all types of depositories, with the following two exceptions:

* Weeding - Federal agency and Federal court depository libraries weed through the Library of Congress' Exchange and Gift Division under 44 U.S.C. Section 1907 rather than through a Regional library.  Highest appellate court libraries also have different weeding guidelines.

* Free access to the public to use depository documents in the library is required of all depositories except those depositories designated as the library of the highest appellate court in the state under 44 U.S.C. Section 1915.

Procedures

Each year, LPS will request self-studies from a group of libraries in chronological order from the date of last inspection.  A copy of the self-study will be provided by the depository to LPS and to the appropriate Regional library.  Federal agency and Federal court depositories will correspond directly with LPS.  Inspectors will evaluate each self-study.  A telephone interview with the documents librarian will take place to clarify any issues.  All depositories will receive a Self-Study Evaluation report.

LPS will determine whether an on-site inspection is warranted based on the self-study, follow-up questions, consultation with the Regional library, and specific criteria including recent staff and facility changes, results of prior inspections, and, if applicable, any complaints from depository library users.

Some questions have yes-no answers, in others, choices are indicated or a narrative response is requested.  Add sufficient narrative to all questions so an inspector reading the self-study will more fully understand the library's operation.  Guidance for preparing the self-study can be found on the FDLP Administration home page at: <www.access.gpo.gov/su_docs/dpos/selfstudy/>.

In preparing the library's self-study, use the template provided on GPO's World Wide Web site at <www.access.gpo.gov/su_docs/dpos/selfstud.html>.  Download the template to a word processing system, input responses below each question, print the completed self-study, and mail it to LPS.

OPTION: Any depository may conduct a self-study at any time.  LPS will review the self-study and provide a report to the library explaining perceived strengths, weaknesses, corrective actions, and recommendations.  Such a "desk audit" review and report is not a substitute for any future on-site inspection, but is an option open to all depositories, e.g., for a new documents librarian's orientation, planning purposes, etc.

Self-Study

The self-study must be completed by depository library staff and returned to LPS and the Regional library by the due date provided in the notification letter.  As noted earlier, an evaluation of this self-study may result in an on-site inspection.  Note: Where appropriate the library may append various attachments such as relevant handouts, organizational charts, portions of or complete documents department or library annual reports which pertain to depository operations, etc.

The library's completed self-study must be transmitted to GPO by mail.
