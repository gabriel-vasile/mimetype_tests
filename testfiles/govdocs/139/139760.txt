Title: Enhanced_WQ_locations 
Abstract: 
Three existing monitoring networks (monthly compliance monitoring, monitoring at 
inflow and outflow structures, and 11 stations along two transects in the southwest) 
operated by the South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) regularly monitor 
water quality within the Arthur R. Marshall Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge. The 
current marsh network is estimated to cover approximately 60% of the refuge, leaving 
40% of the marsh uncharacterized. The uncharacterized areas of greatest concern are 
those between the canals and existing stations and in the immediate vicinity of existing 
or proposed structures (STA-1E and STA-1W for example). 

The Enhanced Water Quality network focuses on these uncharacterized areas. Thirty 
of the new sample sites are located on six transects extending from the canal to 4 km 
into the interior. Nine additional new points are located in the northwest and southeast. 
Data collected at these stations include parameters consistent with the existing 
Everglades Protection Area (EVPA) sampling. Sampling began in June 2004. 
Supplemental Information: 
Locations of the Enhanced Water Quality sites were determined through analysis of 
past data from the existing marsh monitoring stations, topography, current conductivity 
sampling collected monthly by Refuge staff, and conductivity sampling conducted 
during February 2004 by SFWMD staff (Sue Newman), and other relevant studies 
(Childers et al. 2003; Richardson et al. 1990; Scheidt et al. 2000). Thirty of the new 
sample sites are located on six transects extending from the canal to 4 km into the 
interior. Nine additional new points are located in the northwest and southeast. The 
number and location of sample sites will be adaptively modified as data becomes 
available in order to reduce redundancy and maximize the value of the information 
collected. 
PVC pipe markers have been placed at each new sampling station and each new 
station was assigned an identification number that is consistent with other samples 
taken in the refuge. Sampling is conducted via helicopter and follows procedures 
defined in the South Florida Water Management District’s Water Quality Sampling 
protocol (SFWMD 2002). 
Positions for each of the sampling points were taken at the northernmost PVC pipe with 
a Trimble GeoExplorer 3. A minimum of 5 positions were recorded at 5 second 
intervals for each station. The Trimble automatically averages these readings to 
produce a single data point. The data were then post-processed in the lab to achieve 
differential positions for each station. Pathfinder Office v2.8 was used to download, 
correct for differential using the CORS Miami 3 station information, and export to an 
ESRI ARCGIS shape file.

Why was the data set created? 
The primary purpose of these data is to collect water quality data. The information collected 
during these studies will help resource managers identify potential threats to Refuge 
resources, keep unimpacted areas from becoming impacted, maximize the potential for the 
recovery of impacted areas, and better understand the hydrology and ecology of the 
Refuge. 
How was the data set created? 
1. Where did the data come from?
Positions for each of the sampling points were taken at the most Northern PVC pipe 
with a Trimble GeoExplorer 3. A minimum of 5 positions were recorded at 5 second 
intervals for each station. The data were then post-processed in the lab to achieve 
differential positions for each station. Pathfinder Office v2.8 was used to download, 
correct for differential using the CORS Miami 3 station information, and export to an 
ESRI ARCGIS shape file. 
2. What changes have been made?
No changes have been made as of 12 Dec 2005.

How reliable are the data; what problems remain in the data 
set? 
1. How well have the observations been checked?
Triple checked 
2. How accurate are the geographic locations?
The points were differentially corrected using the CORS Miami 3 station. The CORS 
system enables positioning accuracies that approach a few centimeters relative to the 
National Spatial Reference System, both horizontally and vertically. For more 
information, please see 
<http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/CORS/cors-data.html> 
3. How accurate are the heights or depths?
Not applicable 
4. Where are the gaps in the data? What is missing?
LOXA125 is not in the sequence of stations because this station does not exist. 
5. How consistent are the relationships among the observations, including 
Corrected positions are consistent with field observations and other GIS data. 
How can someone get a copy of the data set? 
Are there legal restrictions on access or use of the data?
