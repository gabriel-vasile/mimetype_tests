Inst/Host Relationship
SH - Todd's memo - concern that we're not including entire insthost in 
     inst template
RS - What if the inst is defined w/ two hosts simultaneously?
AR - There is no temporal relation
RS - Insthost has a ground component - inst can have 3 components, ground 
     transmit, gnd receive & s/c inst (HGA) - there exist 3 insthosts
SH - We do describe each entity separately - are allowed to describe 
     instruments seperately, Dick has unique situation - may describe inst 
     collection triad in insthost
RJ - Can't solve Dick's problem with this SCR
SH - 1) Is concept of inst & host still useful?
     2) Is changing relationship to many-to-many useful?
     3) What is exact relationship - opt#1 Instrument template contains 
     instrument host ID; or, Opt#2 (SCR as written)

Vote on two options:

Option #1 (Instrument template contains instrument host ID)
   ATMOS      - yes
   SBN        - yes
   RS         - conditional yes
   PPI        - yes
   IMG        - yes
   CN DE Lead - yes
   GEO        - yes
   RINGS      - yes
   NAIF       - not present
   Proj Eng   - yes

Option #2 (SCR as written)
   ATMOS      - yes
   SBN        - yes
   RS         - yes
   PPI        - yes
   IMG        - yes
   CN DE Lead - yes
   GEO        - yes
   RINGS      - yes
   NAIF       - not present
   Proj Eng   - yes

TK - Not convinced we adequately describe the many-to-many relationship
SH - Data Set Host implements a trinary relationship between DS-Inst-Host
SH - Explicitly make host id part of inst id
TK - Solve for 3 examples: single inst/single host, three inst/single 
     host, inst on two hosts; ID/ host - inst - ID

1) go - mag - go mag
2) go - mag - add go ssi
          ssi
3) T1*
   T2  - CCD photometer - 
   T3    
   
(* T = Telescope)

AR - Only two reqd entities; lvtool kicks back error for multiple objects
TK - Insthost id will be multi-valued

SH 1) Do you specify in insthost a set?
   2) create new sub-object inst/insthost?

Vote on Option #1 or #2:
  ATMOS      - 1
  SBN        - 1
  RS         - neither
  PPI        - 1
  IMG        - no pref
  CN DE Lead - 1
  GEO        - abstain
  RINGS      - 1
  NAIF       - not present
  Proj Eng   - 1
  
(#1 carries: Specify a set in the instrument host cat)

---
Dick's example - 3 related hosts - distributed instruments
---

Vote to send SCR to MC, with agreed-upon changes:
  ATMOS      - yes
  SBN        - yes
  RS         - abs
  PPI        - yes - pending modification
  IMG        - yes
  CN DE Lead - yes
  GEO        - abstain
  RINGS      - yes
  NAIF       - not present
  Proj Eng   - yes

SCR is RECOMMENDED

=================================
Header Type SCR (Steve Joy)

One column tables w/ 10 line headers

SH says to move immediately to implementation queue.  General assent.

=================================
product_type SCR - (Steve Joy)

It is decided that this is a complex issue, and should be deferred until 
an overall ontology or taxonomy is developed to describe products

=================================
Remove Anne from Undefined Elements in the PSDD SCR, replace with SE Team
