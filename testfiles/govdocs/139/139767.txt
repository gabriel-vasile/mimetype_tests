  NCAR SABRELINER, PARTICLE MEASUREMENT SYSTEM (PMS) 2D-P PROBE, CONCENTRATION COUNTS

Provide a definition and/or brief description of all geophysical parameters,
sensor/instruments and source/platforms.

  The PMS 2D-C and 2D-P probes illuminate a linear array of photodiodes with a
  He-Ne laser.  As a particle passes through this focused beam, a shadow image
  is cast on the diodes and a count of the total number of occulted diodes
  represents the particle size.

Are there currently any plans to reprocess this data set? YES 

   If so, when will the data set be reprocessed?

      SPRING 1997

   Why will the data set be reprocessed?

      Recent SUCCESS measurements will help establish the validity
      of the processing techniques and a better idea of how to
      convert particle size to diameter.

Is this data set in HDF (EOS Standard Data Format) or ASCII?

   If you are willing to convert the data to HDF, will you need guidance from the
   Langley DAAC?

   Do you need HDF documentation?
