<h2> <img border="0" src="WB01625_.gif" alt="red square; denotes beginning of article" align="bottom" hspace="3" width="28" height="28">Summer Food Safety Concerns&nbsp;</h2>
<p><i>Illness
outbreaks and research continue to show that summer can bring more than hot sun
and vacation. Educators can help consumers stay safe by tuning in to these food
safety issues and resources:</i>
<h3> <img border="0" src="redsq2.gif" alt="  " hspace="3" width="12" height="12"> Fruits and Vegetables&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Nothing says &quot;summer&quot; like fresh produce: tomatoes still warm from
the sun, strawberries meltingly sweet, the sharp tang of arugula.&nbsp;
<p> At the same
time, consumers need to remember that dangerous micro-organisms can be
everywhere--even on our summertime vegetables.&nbsp;
<p> Whether they're grown in another
country or our own back yard, our fruits and vegetables can harbor dangerous
pathogens. They can become contaminated by the soil they're grown in or water
used for irrigation or rinsing.&nbsp;
<p> But many resources are available for both
consumers and producers to reduce risks of illness. Key tips to remember:&nbsp;
<ul>
  <li>The
fresher the better: Avoid buying produce with wilted, moldy or slimy parts where
bacteria can multiply. Only buy what you need. According to the Produce
Marketing Association, most items should be used within a few days.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Clean,
clean, clean: Just before you use it, wash it all--fruits and vegetables. This
includes fruits with rinds or skin. Don't use detergent or bleach--it could be
absorbed through the skin.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Keep the other germs away! Don't let fresh fruit
or vegetables come in contact with raw meat, poultry, or seafood. This also
means making sure that you thoroughly wash any plates or knives that might have touched raw meat before you use them with produce.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Refrigerate cut-up fruit immediately.</li>

<p>Interested in preserving some of that summer
harvest? Kansas State University has posted a terrific Web page with links to
preservation information and publications from around the country. The Web page
also links to a new Food Preservation Database created by the Penn State
Department of Food Science. Go to: <a href="http://www.oznet.ksu.edu/extrapidresponse/Food%20Preservation.htm"> http://www.oznet.ksu.edu/extrapidresponse/Food%20Preservation.htm</a>&nbsp;
<h3><img border="0" src="redsq2.gif" alt="  " hspace="3" width="12" height="12">Fairs&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Public health officials, fair promoters, and consumers are all
paying more attention to health hazards from fairs and petting zoos.&nbsp;
<p> These sites
can present special health hazards, especially because of the presence of farm
animals. In addition, fairs are frequently dealing with untrained or volunteer workers,
temporary cooking and sanitation facilities as well as lots of animals around--including accompanying flies and rodents.
<h4>Reducing Risks From Animals:</h4>
<p>Outbreak investigations as well as case
control studies from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
confirm there can be numerous modes of transmission for <i>E. coli </i>O157:
H7.&nbsp;
<p> According to CDC's FoodNet Coordinator Malinda Kennedy, most illnesses have
been associated with contaminated food or drink, such as undercooked ground beef
or raw uncooked produce. These products have usually been contaminated with
animal feces containing <i>E. coli </i>O157: H7.&nbsp;
<p> Not surprisingly then, contact
with farm animals--such as calves--can significantly increase the risk of
illness from <i>E. coli </i>O157: H7, according to Kennedy. This fecal bacteria
can be present on the animal's skin or even on railings of the pen. When you
touch those surfaces, your hands can become contaminated. When your hand goes to
your mouth, you could be ingesting enough bacteria to make you sick.&nbsp;
<p> On April 6,
2001, the CDC's <i>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) </i>published
results of the first outbreaks in the U. S. confirming that <i>E. coli </i>O157:
H7 can be directly transmitted from farm animals to humans. These outbreaks,
occurring in 2000, also emphasized the special risks of illness faced by young
children. In one of the outbreaks, the median age of those who became ill was 4
years old (median meaning half above and half below).&nbsp;
<p> The article is titled <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5015a5.htm">
&quot;Outbreaks of <i>Escherichia coli </i>O157: H7 Infections Among Children Associated With Farm Visits.&quot;</a> Go to: http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5015a5.htm&nbsp;
<p>To deal with these types of hazards,
many health officials are devoting more time to checking fairs and petting zoos.
They are also inspecting water supplies which can become contaminated with
runoff from farm animals.&nbsp;
<p> Consumers need to take precautions as well. While
petting zoos are terrific fun for the kids, they can spell trouble when a hand
that just petted a calf goes into a child's mouth.&nbsp;
<p> To help reduce risks of
illness, the <i>MMWR </i>article includes the following advice (go to the
article for the complete list of recommendations):&nbsp;
<ul>
  <li>Petting zoos and farms
open to the public should inform visitors about the risks of illness from farm
animals.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Food and beverages should be prepared, served and eaten only in
&quot;animal-free&quot; areas.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Handwashing stations should be available
including running water, soap, and disposable towels. Handwashing stations
should be available in the petting zoo areas as well as the
&quot;animal-free&quot; areas where food is served and eaten.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>People at high
risk for infections should observe &quot;heightened precautions&quot; and
&quot;weigh the risks for contact with farm animals.&quot; People at risk
include children under 5, the elderly, pregnant women and people with weakened
immune systems.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p> A 1997 FoodNet case control study also found a link between
exposure to farm animals and illness from <i>E. coli </i>O157: H7. Go to: <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/foodnet/pub/iceid/1998/kassenborg_h.htm">
http://www.cdc.gov/foodnet/pub/iceid/1998/kassenborg_h.htm</a>&nbsp;
<h4>Food Safety at Fairs:&nbsp;</h4>
<p>In addition to washing hands-- and eating only
in &quot;animal-free&quot; areas--consumers need to remember that food safety at fairs revolves around
&quot;hot,&quot; &quot;cold,&quot; and &quot;clean.&quot; Food that's supposed
to be hot should be steaming hot. Cold foods should be cold, and if facilities
don't look clean, don't eat there.&nbsp;<p> Finally, check out this new publication. It's
an important resource for volunteer cooks at fairs: <i><a href="../pubs/cfg/cfg.htm">Cooking for Groups: A
Volunteer's Guide to Food Safety</a>, </i>produced by the Food Safety and Inspection
Service, http://www.fsis.usda.gov/OA/pubs/cfg/cfg.htm&nbsp;
<h3><img border="0" src="redsq2.gif" alt="  " hspace="3" width="12" height="12">Safe Grilling</h3>
<p> For many people, there's nothing better than a steak,
chicken or fish cooked out over the grill. Smoke wafting up, that nice charred
outside.&nbsp;
<p> Hold that picture. Zoom in on the &quot;nice charred outside.&quot; It
looks good, but is it good for you?&nbsp;
<p> For more than 10 years now, scientists have
been studying the link between mutagens that can be formed in charred meats and
cancer--including colon cancer, lung cancer and even breast cancer.&nbsp;
<p> According
to one of the country's primary researchers in the field, Dr. Rashmi Sinha of
the National Cancer Institute, &quot;Something is going on with grilled meats. There's a clear
relationship between very high temperatures and the risk of cancer-causing
agents.&quot;&nbsp;
<p> Is this just another &quot;hassle&quot; for hazard-weary
consumers? Not really. It's <i>easy </i>to keep meat safe from dangerous
charring.&nbsp;
<p> Dr. Sinha's advice includes:&nbsp;
<ul>
  <li>Cook foods in the center of the grill
and move coals to the side. That helps prevent fat from meat from dripping on
the coals and causing flare-ups. &quot;Flare-ups are the problem,&quot;
according to Dr. Sinha. &quot;The more caramelized the meat-- the blackened the
    outside-- the greater the risk.&quot;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Precook meat in the microwave
immediately before placing it on the grill. &quot;This helps release some of the
juices that contain the precursors of mutagens,&quot; said Dr. Sinha.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Cut
charred portions off the meat.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p> &quot;It's important to help consumers understand
how to cook without undercooking or overcooking,&quot; Dr. Sinha added. That's
one more reason to use a food thermometer-- food is safely cooked without being
overcooked. (See the <a href="../../thermy/index.htm"> &quot;Thermy&#153;&quot;
campaign</a>: http://www.fsis.usda.gov/thermy)&nbsp;

Safety Facts,&quot;</a> http://www.fsis.usda.gov/oa/pubs/facts_barbecue.htm&nbsp;<p>
Of special interest to health professionals-- In November 2001, Dr. Sinha is
coordinating a conference on cancer-causing agents and meat to be held in
Washington, DC.

<p>&nbsp;<i>FoodNet is an active foodborne illness
surveillance system operating in sentinel sites throughout the U. S. It is a
collaborative project among the sites, the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC), the Food Safety and Inspection Service, and the Food and Drug
Administration.&nbsp; </i><p><i> To help readers access information being produced by FoodNet, </i>The
Food Safety Educator <i>periodically highlights FoodNet findings.<img border="0" src="map350.jpg" alt="map symbolizing FoodNet data collection at sentinel sites" align="right" width="350" height="221"></i>
<p>According to preliminary data from FoodNet for the year 2000, <i>Campylobacter
</i>continues to be the leading cause of bacterial foodborne disease in sentinel
site areas, followed by <i>Salmonella, Shigella, </i>and <i>E. coli </i>O157:H7.&nbsp;
<p> At the same time, the data also show substantial regional and year-to-year
variations.&nbsp;
<p> Despite these variations, however, the general magnitude of illness
and rate of illness caused by different pathogens have remained fairly constant.
According to FoodNet Coordinator Malinda Kennedy, there are no dramatic ups or
downs.&quot;&nbsp;
<p> The data for 2000, along with comparisons to surveillance data from
past years, appeared in the April 6, 2001, <i>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly
Report (MMWR), </i>published by CDC.&nbsp;
<p> In assessing the data, Kennedy said it's
important for people to take into account the dramatically different rates of
illness from site to site.&nbsp;
<p> For instance, the incidence of laboratory-diagnosed campylobacteriosis ranged from 6.6 per 100,000 population in Tennessee to 38.2
in California.
<p>&quot;This
leads us to caution in interpreting the data,&quot; Kennedy said. &quot;Because
of the variations from site to site, it's difficult to draw conclusions for the
whole.&quot;&nbsp;
<p>&quot;The variations in data from site to site are both a challenge
and an opportunity,&quot; said Kennedy. &quot;It gives us an opportunity to
target sites with high rates of illness and an opportunity to learn from sites
with low rates.&quot;
<p>In looking at foodborne illness trends over time, Kennedy
explained that currently FoodNet only examines trends from the five original
sites in order to keep the surveillance base constant.&nbsp;
<p> That's because the number
of sites and people under surveillance has approximately doubled since FoodNet
began in 1996. In 2001, FoodNet sentinel sites cover more than 30 million
people; the original 5 sentinel sites covered 14 million people.
<p>As time goes by, the data regarding trends will be drawn from the entire
population under surveillance.&nbsp;
<p> The <i>MMWR </i>article also notes that the
reasons for changes in foodborne illness are complex because foodborne pathogens
are transmitted by a variety of food and nonfood routes.&nbsp;
<p> For example, although
foods of animal origin are the major source of <i>Salmonella </i>and <i>E. coli </i>O157:
H7, transmission through fresh produce and direct contact with animals has been
increasingly recognized. In assessing the data, FoodNet researchers concluded
that the expanded surveillance system will be useful in monitoring progress
toward our national health objectives to reduce infections from foodborne
pathogens.&nbsp;<p> To read the article, go to: <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5013a1.htm"> http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5013a1.htm</a>&nbsp;<img border="0" src="redball.gif" alt="end of article" hspace="3" width="12" height="12">

<h3>&nbsp;<img border="0" src="redsq2.gif" alt="item" hspace="3" width="12" height="12"><b>New Access to Consumer Research</b>
</h3>
<p>As educators, we're always trying to find out what people are doing-- how are
they handling food, where do they get their food safety information? Research
into consumer behavior is becoming more and more accessible via the Web.&nbsp;<img border="0" src="ers.jpg" alt="USDA Economic Research Service symbol" align="right" width="280" height="122">
<p> The U.
S. Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service (ERS) has created a new
Web site focusing just on consumers and food safety. This Web site--<a href="http://www.ers.usda.gov/briefing/consumerfoodsafety/">http://www.ers.usda.gov/briefing/consumerfoodsafety/</a>-- is one of the richest
sources of information concerning research into consumers and food safety
behavior. It includes a variety of research reports published by ERS as well as
links to other organizations and agencies and their research. As the Web site
notes:
