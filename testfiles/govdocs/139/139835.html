      The UK Organic Foods Market

Overview                                                                        
                                                                                
There are currently around 860 registered organic producers                     
in the UK.  Nearly 50,000 hectares (less than 0.2 percent of                    
the UK agricultural land area) is classified as organic.                        
However, this total includes around 23,000 ha which is under                    
conversion to full organic status.                                              
                                                                                
Industry estimates suggest the UK market for organic foods                      
is worth around BPS 150 (USD 234) million in 1995.  While                       
fruits and vegetables are the most common organic produce                       
sold at retail level, other organic foodstuffs available                        
include cheeses, coffee, chocolate, herbs, flour, pastas,                       
teas and baby food.  Trade sources indicate that the demand                     
for organic meat is increasing due to consumer concerns                         
surrounding BSE, and animal welfare issues.  Estimates                          
suggest that around two-thirds of the UK organic foods                          
market is comprised of imports, although many of these being                    
ingredients in processed foods such as baby food.  We are                       
unaware of any organic foods being promoted by country of                       
origin.                                                                         
                                                                                
Trade sources believe that increased EU production of                           
organic produce will not only satisfy current latent                            
consumer demand for organic foodstuffs, but will stimulate                      
demand further.  Estimates of future growth vary widely, but                    
median estimates suggest that the UK organic food market is                     
likely to double within the next 2 to 3 years.                                  
                                                                                
In 1993, a European Community regulation (2092/91) became                       
effective describing the inputs and practices which may be                      
used in organic farming and growing, and the inspection                         
system which must be in place to ensure this.  The                              
Regulation also applies to processing, processing aids and                      
ingredients in organic foods.  All organic foods must come                      
from growers, processors or importers who are registered and                    
subject to regular inspection.  The regulation stipulates                       
that organic food imported from outside the EU is grown and                     
certified to an equivalent standard.  The standards and                         
inspection system of the exporting country must be notified                     
to and assessed by the EU before it can be sold as organic.                     
                                                                                
In the United Kingdom (UK), the Regulation is administered                      
by the United Kingdom Register Of Organic Food Standards                        
(UKROFS).  UKROFS consists of an independent Board appointed                    
by Agriculture Ministers.  It regulates the various bodies                      
in the UK which register organic farmers and processors.
