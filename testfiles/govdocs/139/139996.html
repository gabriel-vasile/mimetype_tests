<h2><b>Baby Appleseed Recalls Cribs Due to Fall Hazard</b></h2>

<p>WASHINGTON, D.C. - The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, in cooperation with the firm named below, today announced a voluntary recall of the following consumer product. Consumers should stop using recalled products immediately unless otherwise instructed. 

<p><b>Name of Product: </b>Davenport Cribs</p>

<p><b>Units: </b>About 500</p>

<p><b>Importer: </b>Baby Appleseed, of City of Industry, Calif.</p>

<p><b>Hazard: </b>The cribs fail to meet the federal safety standards for cribs. The cribs have a two mattress support system. The secondary mattress support, used for the lowest position, does not meet the full 26 inch minimum height in its lowest position, allowing children inside to crawl over the railing, posing a fall hazard.</p>

<blockquote>
<b>Note from CPSC Staff:</b><br>
Federal Regulations require that all full-size cribs have a minimum rail height of 26” to help prevent fall hazards.  To determine whether or not a crib meets this requirement, the mattress support platform must be placed in the lowest configuration (for the oldest users of the crib).  Once in the lowest setting, remove the mattress and measure the distance from the top of the mattress platform (NOT the top of the mattress) to the top of the front rail. If the crib has a drop side or movable front rail, the measurement should be taken when the rail is in the uppermost locked position.
</blockquote>

<p><b>Incidents/Injuries: </b>None reported.</p>

<p><b>Description: </b>The recall includes Davenport crib models that begin with the model numbers 273-xxxx-xxxx and have manufacture dates on or before August 2007 printed on a label located on the right side of the lower inner panel of the crib. The recalled cribs have two mattress support systems-a metal one and a wooden one. Newer Davenport cribs with model numbers beginning with 244-xxxx-xxxx that have one mattress support are not included in the recall.</p>

<p><b>Sold at: </b>Specialty juvenile product stores nationwide from December 2006 through September 2007 for between $600 and $800.</p>

<p><b>Manufactured in: </b>Vietnam</p>

<p><b>Remedy: </b>Consumers should stop using the recalled cribs in the third lowest position, which uses the wooden mattress support, and contact Baby Appleseed to receive a repair kit. Consumers who are currently using the crib with the metal mattress support in the top or middle positions can continue to use the crib in those positions while awaiting a repair kit. (<i>NOTE: Repair Kits will be available from the firm in mid-August 2008</i>)</p>

<p><b>Consumer Contact: </b>For additional information, contact Baby Appleseed at (877) 348-2199 anytime, or visit the firm’s Web site at www.babyappleseed.com</p>
