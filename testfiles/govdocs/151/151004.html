IA #45-06,  REVISED 2/2/96, ATTACHMENT REVISED 4/24/08

SUBJECT        :    "AUTOMATIC DETENTION OF STEVIA LEAVES, EXTRACT OF
                    STEVIA LEAVES, AND FOOD CONTAINING STEVIA"


NOTE              : This alert has been revised to incorporate analytical
                    methodology.  Changes are bracketed by asterisks
                    (***).

TYPE OF ALERT     : Automatic Detention

                    (Note:  This import alert contains guidance to FDA
                    field personnel only.  It does not establish any
                    requirements or obligations on FDA or on regulated
                    entities.)

PRODUCT           : Stevia leaves, stevioside (extract of stevia leaves),
                    foods containing stevia, unless explicitly labeled as
                    a dietary supplement or for use as a dietary
                    ingredient of a dietary supplement.

PRODUCT CODE      : 45T[][]99

                    All food product codes where the leaves or stevioside
                    are present as an ingredient (except for dietary
                    supplements).

                    pursuant to Section 801(a)(3) in that it appears to
                    contain a food additive which is unsafe within the
                    meaning of Section 409, namely stevia leaves or the
                    extract thereof (stevioside) [Adulteration, Section
                    402(a)(2)(c)]."

OFFICE            : DAL-DO (HFR-SW140);

                    Branch, (HFS-456);

                    (HFS-637)









REASON FOR
ALERT             : Stevia leaves are a native product in Brazil and
                    Paraguay. The extract, stevioside, has reportedly been
                    approved for use in foods in Brazil and Japan.  The
                    product is used in these countries as a table-top
                    sweetener in virtually all food commodities and as a
                    flavor enhancer in such products as teas. Stevioside
                    is reportedly 250-300 times sweeter than sugar and
                    contributes no calories to the diet.

                    With regard to its use in foods, stevia is not an
                    approved food additive nor affirmed as GRAS in the
                    United States.  Available toxicological information on
                    stevia is inadequate to demonstrate its safety as a
                    food additive or to affirm its status as GRAS.
                    However, with  regard to its use in dietary
                    supplements, dietary ingredients, including stevia,
                    are not subject to food additive regulations.

                    Stevia leaves and stevioside have been offered for
                    entry both in bulk and in finished products.  Examples
                    of products detained because of stevia include teas,
                    drinks, seafood, fruits, vegetables, and candies.  FDA
                    analysis performed by Dallas district found diet teas
                    to consist of up to six percent of stevioside.

GUIDANCE          : Districts may detain without physical examination all
                    products identified on the attachment to this alert.
                    If review of the labeling or import paperwork reveals
                    stevia leaves, stevioside, or products containing
                    stevioside, districts may detain these items without
                    physical examination, unless explicitly labeled as a
                    dietary supplement, or for use solely as a dietary
                    ingredient in the manufacture of a dietary supplement
                    product.

                    If stevia is to be used in a dietary supplement for a
                    technical effect, such as use as a sweetener or
                    flavoring agent, and is labeled as such, it is
                    considered an unsafe food additive.  However, in the
                    absence of labeling specifying that stevia is being or
                    will be used for a technical effect, use of stevia as
                    a dietary ingredient in a dietary supplement is not
                    subject to the food additive provisions of the FD&C
                    Act.

                    If districts determine through analysis that a product
                    contains stevia leaves or stevioside, recommendations
                    for automatic detention should be forwarded to DIOP,
                    HFC-170, with the analytical package unless the
                    product is explicitly labeled as a dietary supplement
                    or for use solely as a dietary ingredient in the
                    manufacture of a dietary supplement product.

                    In FY'95, there have been several shipments of pickled
                    radishes from Japan detained because of presence of
                    stevioside.  Also, in recent years stevia has been
                    found in many seafood products from Japan.  Districts
                    should consider sampling these products for the
                    presence of stevioside if its presence cannot be
                    determined from the label.




                    Stevia leaves/stevioside may be under study in the
                    United States in research settings as a basis for
                    establishing toxicological information for future food
                    additive petitions.  As stevia leaves/stevioside are
                    not available in the United States, imported shipments
                    of stevia leaves/stevioside may be considered for
                    release when documentation exists to demonstrate that
                    the pending destination and use of the product is for
                    research purposes.

                    ***The Division of Field Science recommends that
                    district laboratories utilize the method published in
                    the Journal of Chromatography, 474 (1989), p. 447-451,

                    Rebaudioside A and C and Dulcoside A on Foods by
                    High-Performance Liquid Chromatography."

                    A laboratory must assure that recommended
