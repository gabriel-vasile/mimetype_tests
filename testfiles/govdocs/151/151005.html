<h3>Marketing Sobering Messages On Campuses</h3>

<p>THOSE WHO BELIEVE the drinking habits of college students are a fact of life that
can&#146;t be changed are in for a surprise. A concept called social marketing is making
impressive progress in giving students by the thousands a new respect for sobriety.</p>

<p>True, some students still insist on spending time, money, and energy on marathon
drinking parties, and risking life and limb in the process. But a social marketing
strategy called the &#147;social norms approach&#148; to prevention is proving effective
in reducing their numbers significantly. On some campuses, high-risk drinking rates are
down by 20 percent or more from their levels a few years ago.</p>

<p>Nationwide surveys during most of the 1990s have shown that about 40 percent of college
students drink at high-risk levels on a regular basis, five or more drinks on an occasion
for men, or four or more for women.</p>

<p>That figure should decline in the next decade if more colleges and universities follow
the lead of those who have been experimenting with social norming as an approach to
prevention.</p>

<p>High-risk drinking at the University of Arizona in Tucson dropped dramatically from
43.2 percent in 1995 to 30.6 percent in 1998. Using a similar strategy, Western Washington
University saw a 20 percent reduction in risky drinking levels, and Northern Illinois
University measured an 18 percent reduction. Smaller schools have done as well. Hobart and
William Smith College, a private liberal arts college in upstate New York with fewer than
1,800 students, reduced high-risk drinking by 21 percent.</p>

<p><b>Determining Drinking Decisions<br>
</b>Health educators at these schools and others are building their prevention programs on
research accumulated over the years into how people make decisions about their behavior. A
powerful motivation, according to sociologists, is what we perceive others to be doing,
especially others whom we may admire and want to emulate. In other words, freshmen
arriving at college may drink heavily at parties because that&#146;s what everybody on the
campus does.</p>

<p>But campus surveys show that students typically have an exaggerated idea of how much
drinking is going on. The secret of social marketing is to let them know in a convincing
way that they&#146;re wrong and that the norm of alcohol consumption in the campus
population is less than what they think. It&#146;s not as simple, though, as just writing
an article for the student newspaper explaining the divergence between perception and
reality in campus drinking patterns and waiting for everyone to conform.</p>

<p>Wesley Perkins, PhD, a professor of anthropology and sociology at Hobart and William
Smith Colleges in Geneva, NY, says the one-shot treatment just doesn&#146;t work.</p>

<p>&#147;When a story runs in a newspaper, only a certain percentage of students will see
it. When people are presented with information in one way, at one point in time, they may
not believe it and internalize it. It won&#146;t generate much of a reaction or
conversation or thought process.&#148;</p>

<p>What Perkins and his colleagues at Hobart and William Smith aim for is a synergistic
effect--conveying their message in a multitude of ways so that the impact is greater than
the sum of the parts. Not only do students see the drinking-norm information in diverse
forms in newspapers and on posters, but it is infused into the curriculum of sociology and
psychology courses. Incoming freshmen hear about it in orientation lectures. It&#146;s
emphasized in workshops for resident advisors. The information is slipped in among the
campus factoids on the school&#146;s computing network.</p>

<p>The result at Hobart and William Smith goes beyond a decline in the drinking rates of
students. In the first 18 months of the campaign there was a 36 percent decline in
property damage attributable to drinking behavior, and a 31 percent decline in the number
of students who say they missed a class because of their drinking. The number of students
saying they drank to get drunk declined by 16 percent, while the number saying they drank
to &#147;break the ice&#148; socially went down by 34 percent.</p>

<p>At the University of Arizona, a media campaign is based on the information that the
norm for student partying is 4 or fewer drinks. The message is incorporated in a variety
of ads running regularly in the campus newspaper and in other information channels. The
ads and posters emphasize the positive aspects of drinking at less than high-risk levels,
including one series pointing out that sex is better with one drink or none at all.</p>

<p>Koreen Johannesen, director of health promotion and prevention services at U of A,
believes the &#147;social norming&#148; strategy is more productive than trying to
restrain drinking through a crackdown on student partying.</p>

<p>&#147;We want to get across the idea that most students are moderate drinkers and are
not causing a problem to themselves or anyone else,&#148; she says. &#147;We find that as
soon as you talk about cracking down and taking away rights, even the students who
don&#146;t drink at all will take up the cause in a protest.&#148;</p>

<p>At the U of A, the moderate and non-drinking students are happy to help in the program,
providing insight and feedback for the development of media materials and even
volunteering to have their pictures appear in newspaper ads.</p>

<p>Results on the Tucson campus have been dramatic. In a 1995 survey 17.5 percent of
students said drinking had gotten them into trouble with police, their residence hall, or
other college authority. In 1998 that number had dropped to 6.1 percent. The number who
said they had done something under the influence that they later regretted was cut in half
from 41.8 percent to 20.8 percent. The number who said they had been taken advantage of
sexually after drinking went down from 14.7 percent to 8.4 percent.</p>

<p><b>A Comprehensive Approach<br>
</b>The Arizona program also includes an internal committee to deal with aspects of
student life involving alcohol consumption, and a campus/community coalition that brings
student and university representatives together with people from the surrounding
community&amp;emdash;law enforcement, city and county government, the state liquor control
board, and business and neighborhood associations.</p>

<p>&#147;The idea is to come to the table and talk about community issues, like the
neighborhood parties that are not under the jurisdiction of the university and often
involve a lot of non-students,&#148; Johannessen says.</p>

    <td>A campaign to discourage underage and binge drinking among Boston-area college
    students is taking prevention messages to the streets. Five billboards that depict three

    campaign.<p>The ads include a picture of a man lying on a bed while the room spins around

    <p>Boston Mayor Thomas Menino said: &#147;No one wants to look like the fool in front of

<p>&#147;We see that 75 percent of our students drink 25 percent of the alcohol consumed,
and 25 percent drink 75 percent. The campus/community coalition is to identify changes we
can make for that 25 percent drinking 75 percent of the alcohol.&#148;</p>

<p>Another feature of the Arizona program provides help to students who are getting into
trouble because of their drinking habits. This &#147;moderation skills training&#148; is
based on research by Alan Marlatt, PhD, at the University of Washington (see Prevention
File, Vol. 13, No. 2, Spring 1998) and a curriculum developed by Allen Ebel at the
University of Wisconsin. The goal is to arm students with tools to reduce their risk and
provide motivation for change. They learn skills that support safe drinking strategies or
non-drinking habits.</p>

<p>While such counseling and training can turn reckless students into safer ones, one of
the advantages of a social marketing strategy is that it can achieve goals with a minimum
of investment in personnel time.</p>

<p>&#147;Traditional programs with a lot of counseling or other one-on-one work take a lot
more professional labor than a social norming campaign,&#148; says Perkins.
&#147;Depending on the size of the student body, a school can run a campaign like this
with very little investment.&#148; He calculates the outlay at Hobart and William Smith at
around $1,000 a year but costs on larger campuses would run to multiples of that figure.</p>

<p>When costs are compared with benefits, getting students to tailor their drinking closer
to the campus norm has a big payoff in dollars and cents. There are savings to be
calculated in less damage to university property, in fewer students seeking medical help,
and in a reduced dropout rate. Social marketing based on perceptions of the norm appears
to be a cost-efficient and peaceful way to approach campus prevention. </p>

<h3><b>Discouraging Mischief: Using Environmental Management to Curb High-Risk Drinking</b></h3>

<p>By William DeJong</p>

<p>WHEN STANFORD UNIVERSITY opened in 1891, 400 male students moved into Encina Hall, a
lavish, four-story dormitory modeled on a Swiss resort favored by Leland and Jane
Stanford, the university&#146;s founders.</p>

<p>Many of Stanford&#146;s first students had grown up in the rural West, and attending
college was their first taste of independence. Encina Hall suffered for it. <i>Stanford
Magazine</i> (Sept/Oct 1998) reports that on November 22, 1891, freshman Henry Boutelle
wrote his mother: &#147;At 11:30 p.m. the lights went out, and the fellows fired a chair,
a spittoon, and several other things downstairs . . . the chair came pretty nearly hitting
Professor Swain on the head as he walked by.&#148; Boutelle and his roommate went down the
hall: &#147;We saw three streaks of fire shoot out and heard three shots, so Fred and I
concluded that we were in a dangerous locality and quietly went back to our room.&#148;</p>

<p>Stanford&#146;s first registrar Orrin Leslie Elliott, wrote about Encina House in his
University history: &#147; . . . As time went on, everything that could be abused was
abused. Roughhousing spared nothing. Encina was . . . known to outsiders as the
&#145;madhouse.&#146;&#148;</p>

<p>Andrew D. White, a former president of Cornell University, after staying in Encina Hall
in Spring 1892, offered this advice to the Stanfords while giving a lecture series:
&#147;I would urge you not to repeat the Encina plan. For a family hotel it is perfect . .
. but the fundamental principle in erecting dormitories is separation and segregation.
Long halls encourage too much mischief.&#148;</p>

<p><b>Environmental Management<br>
</b>At the Higher Education Center for Alcohol and Other Prevention, we have expanded on
White&#146;s counsel to articulate a new doctrine for the prevention of high-risk drinking
and other drug problems on college campuses, which we call environmental management. The
basic idea is the same: People&#146;s behavior is shaped by their environment.</p>
<div align="center"><center>

<table BORDER="1" WIDTH="30%">
  <tr>
    <td BGCOLOR="#FFFFCC"><p align="center"><b>Mixed messages about high-risk drinking are

</center></div>

<p>Therefore, if we are to change their behavior&amp;emdash;that is, if we are to
discourage mischief&amp;emdash;we need to change that environment. What in the environment
needs to change?</p>

<p>To start, faculty and other higher education leaders need to review the rigor of their
school&#146;s academic program. In an era of rampant grade inflation, the majority of
students have few adult responsibilities and a great deal of unstructured free time,
especially at residential colleges.</p>

<p>A second key factor is the ready availability of cheap alcohol, with local alcohol
retailers competing for business with low-price promotions that encourage excessive
drinking. Voluntary agreements with retailers can be crafted to eliminate this practice,
as is the case in Albany, New York (see <i>Prevention File</i>, Vol. 13, No. 2, Spring
1998), but higher education officials should be prepared to fight for municipal ordinances
or state laws to get this done. The possibility of higher alcohol excise
taxes&amp;emdash;a demonstrated way to reduce access to alcohol, especially by young
people&amp;emdash;should also be considered.</p>

<p>Mixed messages about high-risk drinking are common on college campuses, helping convey
the dangerous idea that it is a normal part of the college experience. With this in mind,
many schools are moving to eliminate alcohol advertising from campus, in particular the
alcohol industry&#146;s sponsorship of intercollegiate sports. That&#146;s an obvious
target, but there are other worrisome mixed messages that should be addressed, from alumni
tailgating parties to unenforced rules about underage drinking.</p>

<p>The relative lack of social and recreational options for students that aren&#146;t
centered around alcohol is another factor. Concerts and other special events are part of
the answer, but only part. Spontaneous sources of entertainment are also needed during the
late hours kept by today&#146;s college student. Last fall Dartmouth College decided to
keep its student union and gym open into the wee hours of the night.</p>

<p>A final consideration is that students who may be in trouble with alcohol or other
drugs are not readily identified or referred to early intervention services. This is of
concern, not only for the students involved, but for the impact those students have in
shaping perceptions of the environment. Quick identification and referral of troubled
students sends a clear message that high-risk drinking is not the norm.</p>

<p>All of this is hard work, but there is no alternative, for education alone will not get
the job done. Nearly 20 years of work to stem alcohol-impaired driving tells us that
progress can be made in reducing high-risk drinking by changing the environment in which
students make decisions about their behavior. That work also tells us that this will take
time.</p>

    1997 alcohol-poisoning death of freshman Scott Krueger at a Beta Theta Pi party. The new
    policy, which is aimed at curbing high-risk drinking, has been proposed several times over
    the years but postponed due to heavy opposition from alumni and faculty who had their own
    memories of freshman year in MIT fraternity houses.</p>
    <p>But in May 1998 a special working group, convened by MIT president Charles M. Vest,
    reported that it &#147;strongly believes that requiring freshmen to live on campus would
    reduce that population&#146;s risk of being involved in dangerous drinking. Clearly,
    on-campus housing for freshmen would not preclude their participation in drinking, but it
    might help to reduce the perceived social pressure for such activity.&#146;&#146;</p>

    &#147;A Degree in Distinction&#148; is less an affirmation of academic excellence than a

    name of a beer that enjoys enormous popularity on New Zealand campuses and is a regular

    <p>According to Elliot, at the University of Otago, as at most other New Zealand

    the Harvard Brewing Company, which closed in 1964.</p>

    that people will buy the beer for the same reason that they purchase T-shirts and caps

    percent of the company&#146;s sales of Harvard lager comes from the Cambridge area.

<h3>PARENTAL NOTIFICATION: FACT OR FICTION</h3>

<p>IT HAPPENS EVERY WEEKEND. A son or daughter, away at college for the first time, drinks
him- or herself into a drunken stupor at an off-campus bar. Around 3:00 a.m. two
less-intoxicated friends help their roommate, hardly able to stand, onto the Happy Bus,
the local college shuttle, where they join nine other similarly inebriated undergraduates
for the bumpy ride back to campus. This trip is an uneventful one. No major fights ensue
and none of the dozen heavily besotted souls on this outing lose it on the way back to
their dorm room.</p>

<p>Upon staggering off the bus at the college student union, several of the more
intoxicated students are approached by campus police. What&#146;s happening here? Quickly
the drunk and underage students are advised that they are being charged with violating the
school&#146;s policy against underage drinking. The students are written up and told that
under a newly enacted disciplinary policy their parents will be notified that the students
have been charged with violating the school policy and state law.</p>

<p>Can a school really confront high-risk student drinking in this manner? New law aimed
at curtailing college student drinking and drug use was one of several major legislative
initiatives passed during the recently completed 105th Congress. At first glance, these
new laws appear to represent important developments in the evolving attitude of the public
toward student drinking and drug use and disorder. But some question the conviction with
which the new approaches will be embraced and the debate rages on about whether student
privacy rights prohibit approaches like parental notification. Indeed, Section 952,
Alcohol or Drug Possession Disclosure, of the Higher Education Act, is still being widely
debated both on- and off-campus.</p>

<p>Signed into law in October the new law clearly permits schools to disclose to parents
violations of not only local, state, and federal laws but also school policies and rules
governing the use or possession of alcohol or controlled substances. The parental
notification amendment came about largely as a result of the efforts of Jeffrey Levy, the
father of a college student killed last year in an alcohol-related traffic crash.</p>

<p>Levy lobbied hard for the proposal after his 20-year-old son, a student at Radford
University in Virginia, was killed while riding as a passenger in a car driven by a drunk
driver.</p>

<p>Appointed to a Virginia attorney general&#146;s task force on college drinking, Levy
encouraged the task force to act forcefully with respect to parental notification. The
other members of the task force listened. One of the group&#146;s leading recommendations
was the parental notification idea and eventually the task force persuaded Virginia
Senator John W. Warner to introduce legislation in the U.S. Senate. As enacted, the law
permits but does not require schools to notify parents of a student&#146;s alcohol or
other drug violation.</p>

<p><b>The Death of the In Loco Parentis Doctrine</b><br>
Congress giving its blessing to parental notification represents a significant shift in
public thinking about the problem of college student drinking and drug use. Prior to 1960
the country&#146;s courts viewed schools as standing in loco parentis to their students.
Recalling this judicial thinking which extended well into the 1960s, Stetson University
Law Professor Peter Lake describes an era in which the university was like a parent to the
student and most problems were handled within the university, by the university, and often
quietly.</p>

<p>In their new book on the rights and responsibilities of the modern university (Carolina
Academic Press, 1999) Professors Lake and Robert Bickel explain:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The most important feature of in loco parentis was to place a blanket of security and
  insularity around university culture . . . Under the blanket, the university was free to
  exercise disciplinary power&amp;emdash;or not &amp;emdash;with wide discretion and little
  concern for litigation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With the widespread social and political upheaval of the 1960s, college and university
administrators found themselves influenced and challenged by the largely young student
messengers of the new wave. Freed from the shackles of parental control and life at home,
though often not yet financially and emotionally independent, this group created an
unprecedented atmosphere on college campuses. Drinking and illicit drug use flourished,
often involving both students and faculty.</p>

<p>According to Bickel and Lake, to accommodate this new campus lifestyle, American courts
stopped relying on the fallen parental legal model and adopted an approach to tort
lawsuits against the university using the notion of &#147;duty&#148; and &#147;no
duty.&#148; What emerged was the idea of the university as a helpless legal
&#147;bystander&#148; to student life and danger. As bystanders, schools then owed no
legal duties to students and hence were not legally responsible for harm.</p>

<p>In turn, the bystander era was a transitional one and soon what emerged was what Bickel
and Lake call the university as &#147;facilitator.&#148; In such a world, the current one,
parental notification for student drug and alcohol violations represents the university
helping the not-yet fully independent student navigate the difficult transition to
adulthood and independence. In this sense, the university is indeed a facilitator.</p>

<p><b>A Student&#146;s View</b><br>
Opinions vary widely however as to whether schools should notify parents of their
child&#146;s alcohol or drug violation. Jessica Kirshner, a first-year student at Harvard
University thinks maybe at a certain point parents should be notified, but not if the
violation is just an isolated incident.</p>

<p>&#147;Perhaps after repeated incidents or if the incident is serious enough that the
student has to be hospitalized, but otherwise I do not believe parents need to be
notified,&#148; says Kirshner.</p>

<p>In Cambridge and Boston, undergraduates witness a great deal of drinking by underage
students.</p>

<p>&#147;It permeates campus life,&#148; explains Kirshner. &#147;Underage students
definitely need fake IDs. Bars are conscious that these students are underage, but if the
student has an ID to show at the door, they&#146;re in.&#148;</p>

<p>As for local enforcement efforts, Kirshner adds, &#147;I know that liquor stores in
Cambridge have Cops in Shops, so it&#146;s a deterrent, but there are other ways to get
around that.&#148;</p>

<p>One of the most common ways underage students obtain beer and liquor is simply by
having of-age students purchase the alcohol. And a lot of the time students don&#146;t
even have to buy it, &#147;it&#146;s just around.&#148;</p>

<p>A close observer of campus alcohol policy, Kirshner is not aware of any disciplinary
incidents this year at Harvard involving alcohol that resulted in parents being notified.</p>

<p>&#147;I have seen underage students who got drunk at campus parties sent before the
disciplinary board, but I have not seen any expulsions. Typically they get put on
probation. It doesn&#146;t look good for the time being but assuming there is no
subsequent violation, the charge gets taken off the student&#146;s record by the end of
the term,&#148; Kirshner said. In her view, students are little concerned about under-age
drinking, and parental notification is not even on their radar. She adds, &#147;I
don&#146;t know if underage drinking would be considered a right of passage, it&#146;s
just something to do.&#148;</p>

<p>As for the types of drinking taking place among underage students, &#147;it tends to
depend on the venue. Around the dorms it&#146;s not binge drinking or heavy drinking.
Heavy drinking sitting around your room is not &#145;socially acceptable.&#146; But once
you get out in the bars, there it is heavier,&#148; explains Kirshner.</p>

<p><b>Who&#146;s Responsible?</b><br>
Before passage of the federal parental notification law, officials at most schools across
the country had refused to tell parents about student drug and alcohol violations, citing
the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), also known as the Buckley
Amendment, a 1974 law on the privacy of student records. Nonetheless, some parents had for
years argued that they have a right to be alerted to their children&#146;s
life-threatening habits. Now the new law is causing many school administrators to rethink
their position on parental notification, although a few schools, including Virginia&#146;s
Radford University had changed their policy even before Congress acted.</p>

<p>Today, many university administrators believe that both students and their parents need
to take more accountability and responsibility for their actions. But before the recent
media focus on the problem of high-risk student drinking, most parents had little sense of
the scope of the problem. Those who did know, more often than not saw it as the aberrant
behavior of someone else&#146;s son or daughter.</p>

<p>While Jeffrey Levy views the recently enacted parental notification amendment as an
important first step, he remains skeptical about the willingness of most schools to take
meaningful steps to address the heavy drinking that has become a way of life for too many
college students. Levy fears that many universities will now simply make the empty promise
that they have a notification policy in place. The bereaved father suspects that even at
many of those schools that adopt a parental notification policy, no or few notifications
will be made.</p>

<p>&#147;What we had hoped for was a clear statement that schools will notify parents when
their son or daughter has been involved in aggressive or binge drinking. Instead, at most
colleges a report will only be made if there is evidence of a legal or disciplinary
violation . . .&#148; [Many campus police and school administrators would not even
consider apprehending heavily intoxicated students as described in the fictional scenario
above], explains Levy.</p>

<p>Advocates of parental notification warn that students know exactly what is going on.
They fear that by not having a strong parental notification policy in place and by failing
to say, &#147;I will not tolerate abusive or binge drinking on my campus,&#148; schools
may be sending the message that nothing has changed.</p>

<p>Levy says: &#147;If the notifications were going out, the students would know about it
and on most campuses the students can tell you that they do not.&#148;</p>

<p>Levy has had a hard time finding out how many notifications are actually being made. He
says, &#147;I&#146;ve also spoken to many parents and I&#146;ve never met a parent who had
been notified.&#148;</p>

<p>A notable exception to what Levy has observed is the experience of the University of
Delaware, which last year sent letters to the parents of 1,414 students who had violated
the school&#146;s disciplinary rules. According to Timothy F. Brooks, Delaware&#146;s dean
of students, most of these letters reported a student&#146;s alcohol or drug violation.
Brooks notes that student recidivism has declined precipitously since Delaware enacted its
three-strikes policy and initiated the practice of parental notification.</p>

<p>Parental notification advocates however are not persuaded by the exception to the
general rule. Explains Levy, &#147;A lot of schools have a three-strikes policy, but how
many kids wander around campus drunk out of their minds and still there is no action.
There&#146;s a big difference between, &#145;Oh, I had one too many to drink,&#146; and
&#145;I&#146;m going to get wasted&#146;. I can accept the first, I can&#146;t and I
don&#146;t think any parent can accept the second. The whole attitude &#145;I&#146;m going
to open up the door, pick up a glass and drink as much as I can, as fast as I can, with
the prime purpose of getting wasted&#146;, that is different from the intention of going
out to have fun. . . The failure to stand up to that is unacceptable. Parents don&#146;t
know about this and in failing to notify them, universities are not helping either the
students or their parents.&#148;</p>

<p>In Levy&#146;s experience university presidents want this problem to go away, but they
do not want to be seen by students as the heavy. He predicts that on most campuses, for
parental notification to be triggered the student will have to have violated a state law,
or campus policy which mirrors state law. The catch is, most college officials believe
they must catch the student in the act of drinking and much campus drinking has been
pushed off-campus or underground. For all intents and purposes, there are no laws against
public intoxication on campus.</p>

<p>&#147;The sight of two sober students carrying a passed-out student into the dorm
should trigger a college to say, &#145;you are in violation of my policy.&#146; But it
doesn&#146;t. I want to see more colleges stand up and say, &#145;Binge or problem
drinking is against our policy,&#146; &#148; says Levy.</p>

<p>Advocates of parental notification will have to look carefully at campuses where
problems continue and critically scrutinize how many parental notifications there have
been.</p>

<p>Robert Metcalf, counsel to the Attorney General of Virginia and a prime mover behind
the parental notification amendment, is the first to admit the new law is not a silver
bullet.</p>

<p>&#147;It doesn&#146;t force colleges to do anything,&#148; notes Metcalf. &#147;It
should be called the drunkenness in the sunshine amendment. The way the system was
colleges were reluctant to go after students who were clearly violating the law. This new
law is just one of a number of methods schools can now use to address the problem. The law
removes an artificial barrier that some schools used in the past to not notify parents.
Now they can. In Virginia, the development of policy is still at the school level. We just
hope that they adopt the amendment approach.&#148;</p>

<p>With passage of the parental notification law many more schools are now considering
adopting a policy of parental notification. Not surprisingly, Virginia and District of
Columbia schools have been among the first to take advantage of parental notification.
Recently, Virginia Tech, where two students died last year in alcohol-related incidents,
became the first major Virginia college to make use of the new federal law. Effective in
Spring 1999, the new policy will permit the notification of parents of underage students
sanctioned for alcohol or drug violations on and off campus.</p>

<p>Virginia Tech&#146;s new policy is also noteworthy because it forges a partnership with
the local police who will notify the school if students are caught off campus with alcohol
or drugs. The new collaborative approach will mean students may face both campus
disciplinary penalties and public prosecution. In Washington, D.C., both American
University and George Washington University are also reviewing their parental notification
policies.</p>

<p>In considering adopting a parental notification policy, schools need to remember what
the amendment is not. Schools should know that the amendment does not impose any
affirmative obligation on the institution to inform parents of the disciplinary violation.
Rather, it specifically states that such action does not violate FERPA or the Higher
Education Act. Basically, it&#146;s all up to the schools.</p>

    <td>Some early indicators of alcohol problems on college campuses in Virginia show that
    high risk drinking may be declining, according to the State&#146;s Attorney General Mark
    L. Earley.<p>Earley, who headed a statewide task force aimed at reduce campus alcohol
    problems, said that there&#146;s been a reduction in students showing up in emergency
    rooms across Virginia. He has also gotten anecdotal reports of declines in problems from
    university administrators, campus police, and campus leaders. The task force was
    instigated in part after the alcohol-related deaths of five Virginia college students in
    Fall 1997.</p>
    <p>The task force recommended that each college develop a plan to curb binge drinking;

    Destruction in residence halls, often caused by inebriated students, has also lessened.</p>
    <p>In Harmon&#146;s view other strategies that have helped reduce high-risk drinking at

<h3><b>Alcohol at Work: Debunking Myths</b></h3>

<p>COMMON WISDOM would have it that most alcohol-related problems in the workplace are
caused by those so-called problem drinkers who drink on the job, show up with hangovers,
or routinely miss work. Not so, says a recent corporate drinking study. It&#146;s the
casual drinkers who cause the majority of workplace problems.</p>
<div align="center"><center>

<table BORDER="1" BGCOLOR="#FFFFCC" WIDTH="35%">
  <tr>
    <td><p align="center"><b>Occasional drinkers cause nearly 29 percent more incidents such
    as absenteeism, tardiness, less than acceptable work or arguments with colleagues than
    workers who said they didn&#146;t drink at all.</b> </td>
  </tr>
</table>
</center></div>

<p>And those problems spill over to co-workers, who say that their productivity on the job
goes down because of &#147;secondhand&#148; effects of the alcohol use of others. The
study found that &#147;fully 21 percent of workers reported being injured or put into
danger, having to redo work or to cover for a co-worker, or needing to work harder or
longer due to others&#146; drinking.&#148;</p>

<p>The report <i>New Perspectives for Worksite Alcohol Strategies: Results from a
Corporate Drinking Study</i> is drawn from one of the largest worksite studies ever
conducted. Researchers surveyed 7 corporations, 114 worksites, and nearly 14,000
employees. These survey findings lead report authors Thomas W. Mangione, PhD, JSI Research
and Training Institute; Jonathan Howland, PhD, Boston University; and Marianne Lee,
Harvard School of Public Health, to believe that the cost of lost productivity due to
alcohol use alone exceeds the $27 billion estimated in the National Institute of
Health&#146;s 1995 <i>Report to Congress</i>.</p>

<p>&#147;It may seem harmless, but an employee who drinks too much champagne at a Sunday
evening wedding, consumes a few too many beers during Monday Night Football, or has a
drink at lunch could be costing you money,&#148; say the authors.</p>

<p>They found that people considered occasional drinkers cause nearly 29 percent more
incidents such as absenteeism, tardiness, less than acceptable work or arguments with
colleagues than workers who said they didn&#146;t drink at all.</p>

<p>According to the researchers, it&#146;s not that those who are alcohol dependent or
alcoholic don&#146;t cause serious problems at work. It&#146;s just that there are so many
nondependent drinkers who occasionally drink too much that &#147;the total sum of their
problems outweighs the problems caused by employees who are truly alcohol-dependent.&#148;</p>

<p>However, most worksite policies and efforts are directed at identifying and treating
alcohol- dependent workers. While this is important work, it won&#146;t get rid of the
majority of alcohol problems in the workplace, because those 20 percent of drinkers who
are dependent account for only 40 percent of alcohol-related performance problems. The 80
percent of drinkers who are not alcohol-dependent account for the remaining 60 percent of
problems.</p>

<p>&#147;This study is a wake-up call for business. Employee Assistance Programs have not
paid sufficient attention to the role of the non-addicted drinker on workplace
productivity and safety,&#148; says Bruce Davidson, an EAP manager at Compaq Computer.</p>

<p><b>Who Is Doing the Drinking? </b><br>
One perception of senior executives surveyed in corporate study is that hourly workers are
more likely to drink during work hours than managers or supervisors. In fact, the opposite
is true. The study found that upper-level managers were three times more likely to report
drinking during working hours within the last 30 days than either first-line supervisors
or hourly workers. However, because there are proportionally more hourly workers than
managers, hourly workers account for the majority of workday drinking incidents.</p>

<p>Most of the workday drinking takes place during lunchtime or at company-sponsored
functions. Only a fraction of drinking events takes place before work, during breaks, or
actually on the job. The researchers found that most corporate policies prohibit alcohol
use on the worksite unless a special waiver is granted. But lunchtime drinking is not
specifically prohibited. Essentially, corporate policy takes the view that lunchtime is
personal time, and that policies prohibiting working &#147;under the influence&#148; are
sufficient to keep employees from imbibing too much at lunch.</p>

<p>But the researchers say that even small amounts of drinking during work hours can
affect work performance, regardless of where it occurs or by whom. In fact, employees who
drink during the workday are more likely to report poor work-performance incidents than
those who don&#146;t. And that&#146;s true for nondependent and dependent drinkers alike.</p>

<p><b>What&#146;s an Employer to Do?</b><br>
Even though the corporate executives interviewed for this study believe that they have
little influence over their employees&#146; drinking practices away from the job, the
researchers say that companies already influence employee drinking behaviors.</p>

<p>&#147;This study highlights that worksites and workgroups develop their own
micro-cultures about drinking; that is, they develop norms which influence how an employee
drinks at work as well as away from work . . . If where you work influences how much you
drink, then harnessing the power of these groups is an underutilized strategy for
influencing employee drinking practices.&#148;</p>

<p>In addition to recommending that employers examine their overall attitudes toward
alcohol and how the corporate culture influences drinking behavior, the researchers call
for more employee awareness campaigns and other public health measures in the workplace.</p>

<p>&#147;The precedent to exert an influence on drinking behaviors already exists when
businesses use education and normative strategies for other health-related lifestyle
issues, such as fitness, nutrition, cholesterol reduction, and smoking cessation,&#148;
said the study authors.</p>

<p>The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and
Alcoholism funded the Corporate Alcohol Study. The seven participating corporations
included an insurer, an oil company, a paper manufacturer, a building-materials concern,
and two conglomerates.</p>

<h3><b>Q &amp; A with Mary Sue Coleman</b></h3>

<p><b>What can you tell us about the overall health and safety of the University of Iowa
from an alcohol and other drug standpoint? Are we getting better?</b><br>
A. I like to believe that the University of Iowa is a pretty safe environment. But we are
not out of the woods yet. Our data indicate that some of our students are consuming too
much alcohol and that they get into trouble because of this excess consumption. We think
that the problem is probably most severe for people under the age of 21&amp;emdash; that
is, underage drinkers. We recognize that some binge drinkers are of legal age, but we
believe we can have the biggest impact on safety by concentrating our efforts on the
younger drinkers first.</p>

<p>One of the issues that we&#146;re beginning to understand&amp;emdash; and it&#146;s
been a real learning process for us in our Stepping-up Project for the Matter of Degree
program&amp;emdash;is the extent to which abuse of alcohol affects other people, even
those who are not drinking. It comes in a number of ways&amp;emdash; through property
damage, through assaults on people, through higher insurance costs, through clean-up the
city has to do, neighborhoods have to do, through more police protection. That impact is
far greater on the nondrinking public than it is on the drinkers, though of course
there&#146;s always the health and safety risk for people who are drinking themselves.</p>

<p><b>How does the University of Iowa compare with other Big Ten schools in problems with
alcohol use?</b><br>
A. Alcohol use is very prevalent in colleges across the United States. I would imagine
that if you look at the age of our undergraduate population, that other Big Ten schools
probably have similar problems. I believe that the research literature
finds&amp;emdash;and my own experience confirms this&amp;emdash;that the older the mean
age of the student population the lower the incidence of high-risk drinking, simply
because older students have other responsibilities and don&#146;t engage so much in binge
drinking. We&#146;re probably pretty comparable with other schools that have a large
cohort of students between the ages of 17 and 22, where the problems are most dramatic.</p>

<p><b>What measures are in place to gauge change in the extent of alcohol and other drug
problems?</b><br>
A: We use self-report surveys to look each year at what students have to say about their
own consumption of alcohol. In addition, we are monitoring reports of alcohol-related
incidents, such as assaults on others. Some indicators will go up simply if we do a better
job of reporting and a better job of controlling data collection, so I&#146;m not
necessarily concerned if those figures go up. But in <font COLOR="#000000">the long haul
we want to see reductions in those kinds of incidents&amp;emdash;and that&#146;s the
direction that I hope we&#146;re headed. </font></p>

<p><b>Several states such as Ohio, Massachusetts, and Virginia have developed state-wide
mechanisms to work on alcohol policies that affect the majority of public universities
within those states. Is something similar contemplated for Iowa?</b><br>
A: I certainly hope that we will really look at what other communities are doing and
compare ourselves with those communities. I have encouraged the mayor of Iowa City to
contact the city councils of cities where the other two state universities are located.
But we can&#146;t take the attitude that one size fits all or that there are blanket
solutions for the whole state because, in fact, our communities are very different. Our
student populations are very different. Something that might work in Cedar Falls at the
University of Northern Iowa may not work here because we are different schools. We have a
different dynamic between the town and the university.</p>

<p>I am not necessarily looking for statewide solutions. We need local solutions for our
issues, our problems. And we need to have the city working with us. I think that&#146;s
the most effective way to get change&amp;emdash;it&#146;s our responsibility, it
isn&#146;t the state&#146;s responsibility to solve our problems.</p>

<p><b>What measures are being taken by the University to divert the attention of
first-year students from the bar scene and get them to focus more on University-sponsored
activities and projects?</b><br>
A. I really have become a believer that we have to start earlier than we do, so I want to
start communicating with students before they even come to the campus. We want them to
know that we want students to get involved and have them help us craft solutions. We
understand that we need to have activities that are alcohol-free, but that those
activities have to be social, they have to be fun, and they have to be at the hours that
students might otherwise go to the bars.</p>

<p>In the past we often developed activities that we, who are in our mid-50s, might enjoy.
But these are not necessarily the activities that students who are under 21 want to engage
in. One of our most successful so far has been &#147;night games&#148; at the recreation
center&amp;emdash;with activities, food, and fun late at night.</p>

</center></div>

<p><b>At the beginning of the academic year&amp;emdash;a critical time for students who
are new to campus to get involved in things&amp;emdash; this year a lot of departments
worked together on the Weeks of Welcome activities. Is that something you were involved
with?</b></p>

<p>A: Yes, we think the first few weeks are very critical because students set patterns
that they will follow throughout the year. The more that we can do to get people
introduced to and engaged in activities that don&#146;t revolve around alcohol, the better
off we are all going to be. Students have to find a fit; they&#146;ve got to find friends;
they&#146;ve go to find things that they can be comfortable with and enjoy.</p>

<p><b>Our campus has been a grant recipient under the Robert Wood Johnson
Foundation&#146;s Matter of Degree program for the past two years. What has been
accomplished and what can we expect next from that program?</b><br>
A: The Robert Wood Johnson&#146;s Matter of Degree program has helped us create some
alliances with the city. We&#146;ve gotten to know each other better at all levels. We sit
together on the executive committee and talk about the kinds of problems we are
experiencing. We have started task forces; we&#146;ve gotten a lot more people involved.
And we have certainly raised awareness levels so that we can speak about these issues in
common terms.<br>
I&#146;m very excited about the fact that we&#146;re communicating better. So far we have
gotten the Disorderly House Ordinance amended by the City Council, which is also willing
to look at some other ordinances that will help. I am very encouraged about what
we&#146;ve been able to do. We are also getting a lot more articles in the newspaper now
about alcohol and other drug issues.</p>

<p>I think the community better understands what we&#146;re trying to do. We have done a
community- wide survey so we know how people feel in the community. We didn&#146;t know
any of that before we started the Matter of Degree program. We have come a long way and I
really look forward to the next few years of building on those strengths and achievements.</p>

  </tr>
</table>
</center></div>

<p><b>What&#146;s the students&#146; role in all this?</b><br>
A: The students are involved in the task forces. Student government leaders are involved
in the executive committee. The more students that we can get into the process the better
off we&#146;re going to be. I don&#146;t want to insult the students or have them believe
that we think they&#146;re the problem. I&#146;d like to encourage more students to come
and talk to us about the issues and craft the solutions. I think that&#146;s happening.</p>

<p>We&#146;re beginning to get the kind of dialog that occurs when people realize that we
respect each other. The fraternity leadership has been trying to be helpful and, while the
fraternities still face some big challenges, they&#146;ve tried to take ownership of
problems and actively deal with them.</p>

<p><b>Speaking of the media, how can the media such as the <i>The Daily Iowan</i>, our
student paper, aid in this effort?<br>
</b>A: <i>The Daily Iowan</i> is crucial, but I don&#146;t think that the staff understand
yet where they need to be, though they&#146;re getting a little bit better. The paper
publishes more articles now about the harmful effects of alcohol than before. When I first
came to the University, people sort of looked at drinking as, oh, this is part of going to
college and just fun and games. They didn&#146;t take it seriously. But I think that
attitude is changing. I do wish that The Daily Iowan would look very hard at what it does
in accepting advertisements for drink specials. Promoting cheap drinks is a major piece of
the problem. As long as The Daily Iowan doesn&#146;t place controls on these ads then what
we&#146;re doing is basically reaching to an underage population and creating the kind of
pressure that will encourage that population to drink. At some point the newspaper has got
to say, hey, wait a minute&amp;emdash;we&#146;re stopping. And I hope they will.</p>

<h3><b>Prevention Updates</b></h3>

<p><b>Big Changes at Dartmouth</b><br>
The 1978 film <i>Animal House</i>, which for many still epitomizes fraternity life, was
co-written by a Dartmouth alumni who was a member of Alpha Delta when he was a student.</p>

<p>Founded in 1769 Dartmouth has had fraternities for more than 150 years, and they are a
major part of campus life. But all that may change with the college&#146;s decision to put
an end to single-sex fraternities and sororities. According to campus officials, plans to
phase out the current Greek system are intended to make college life &#147;substantially
coed&#148;&#146; and to encourage &#147;respectful relations between women and men.&#148;
The administrators said the decision reflects concerns about problem drinking and the
exclusive nature of the Greek system.</p>

<p>This isn&#146;t the first time that Dartmouth fraternities have come under fire. In
1978 the faculty recommended that fraternities and sororities be abolished, believing that
they fostered anti-intellectualism and sexism.</p>

<p>A more recent report from the college's committee on diversity and community leveled
similar criticisms.</p>

<p>Commenting on the decision Stephen Bosworth, chairman of Dartmouth&#146;s board of
trustees, said: &#147;What we&#146;re really looking for is more of a socializing effect
in terms of preparing young men and women for life in a world in which there is much more
diversity in the workplace.&#148;</p>

<p>Students aren&#146;t happy with the decision and mounted protests in the form of
canceled Greek events for Dartmouth&#146;s Winter Carnival. According to an Associated
Press dispatch, Jamie Paul, a member of the Coed Fraternity Sorority Council, said the
cancellations were intended to show that without Greek life there&#146;s simply nothing to
do at Dartmouth.</p>

<p>Dartmouth trustees are aware that they cannot simply abandon the Greek system without
replacing it with new types of housing and places for students to socialize. They say they
are prepared to make the necessary investments.</p>

<p><b>Restaurateurs Get in the Prevention Act</b><br>
In an effort to curb high-risk drinking, especially by students at Michigan State
University, two East Lansing restaurateurs are calling on their colleagues to join them in
a council to promote more responsible alcohol sales and service.</p>

<p>&#147;The goal is to discourage binge drinking among young people in this community.
We&#146;re trying to say, &#145;drinking &#145;til you can&#146;t walk isn&#146;t
cool,&#146;&#148; Vaughn Schneider, owner of Small Planet Food and Spirit, told <i>The
Michigan Daily</i>.</p>

<p>The council, a joint effort of Schneider and Joe Bell of the <i>Peanut Barrel
Restaurant</i>, has asked all of East Lansing&#146;s alcohol licensees for their support
of measures such as reducing drink specials like $1 pitchers and quarter drafts. So far
the response has been positive.</p>

<p>&#147;We&#146;re not saying they shouldn&#146;t run drink specials,&#148; Schneider
said. &#147;It&#146;s about encouraging the restaurants and bars to advertise
responsibly.&#148;</p>

<p>According to Nate Smith-Tyge, chair of MSU&#146;s student government, the council has
asked students to participate on the council.</p>

<p>&#147;It shows the need for restaurateurs and bar owners to put together responsible
hospitality,&#148; Smith-Tyge said. &#147;People are sort of learning their lesson from
what happened at Rick&#146;s with Bradley McCue.&#148;</p>

<p>McCue, a junior at MSU, died in November after celebrating his 21st birthday by
drinking 24 shots in 90 minutes. Rick&#146;s American Cafe in East Lansing, where McCue
drank the night of his death, is serving a 30-day suspension for violating state liquor
laws.</p>

<p><b>Michigan Colleges Combat Deadly Drinking</b><br>
All 15 public colleges and universities in Michigan got together last February to hammer
out ways to get students to understand that passing out isn&#146;t the worst consequence
of high-risk drinking. It can result in alcohol poisoning, emergency room admissions, and
sometimes death.</p>

<p>M. Peter McPherson, president of Michigan State University said: &#147;We want to focus
on &#145;celebration drinking.&#146; Students think they will sleep it off. But if they
had a lot to drink quickly, there is more alcohol in the stomach and the alcohol poisoning
will continue.&#148;</p>

<p>According to a report in The Detroit News, students think that colleges and
universities need to do a better job informing students about the dangers of drinking. One
MSU sophomore said that she had no idea drinking alcohol could lead to death. Another said
that students who are drinking while they are celebrating don&#146;t think that anything
bad can happen to them.</p>

<p>Royster Harper, dean of students at University of Michigan, wants to push for a major
cultural change in how drinking is seen.</p>

<p>&#147;Most students do not believe it&#146;s possible to have a good time without
alcohol. We have to help make that shift,&#148; he said.</p>

<p>Things that have been tried at some Michigan campuses include alcohol-free nightclub
activities, laser tag and virtual reality games at Ferris State University. Administrators
at the University of Michigan are working with a coffee shop to provide a late-night
alternative to bars. </p>

<h3>RAISING ALCOHOL TAXES: DEFICIT REDUCTION WOULD PAY A BONUS IN PREVENTION</h3>

<p>Pressure to reduce the federal deficit appears to be tilting the scale toward an
increase in federal excise taxes on alcohol beverages.</p>

<p>The case for an alcohol tax increase can be made on its own merits&amp;emdash;as a
prevention measure. The deficit crisis simply gives Washington more reason to resist the
arguments of the beverage industry that its products should continue to enjoy an immunity
to higher taxes.</p>

<p>&#147;Increased alcohol taxes would both provide substantial funds to reduce the
deficit and improve our nation&#146;s economic and social health,&#148; says William B.
Snyder, chairman and chief executive officer of Government Employees Insurance Co.
(GEICO). He is one of 29 executives of major corporations who petitioned congress last
year to use alcohol taxes as a deficit-reduction measure.</p>

<p>There is growing political support for higher alcohol taxes. The bi-partisan National
Economic Commission was urged by many economists to include such as tax increases among
its recommended deficit-reduction measures. Former presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter
recommended increases in alcohol taxes in their proposals to incoming president George
Bush. Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volker is backing higher excise taxes on
alcohol, and they have the editorial support of major newspapers including <i>The New York
Times, The Washington Post</i>, and <i>The Los Angeles Times</i>.</p>

<p>The general public is behind the tax increase, too. A Louis Harris poll has indicated
that three out of four Americans believe increased excise taxes on alcohol and tobacco
should be part of a deficit-reduction strategy.</p>

<p><i>Editor&#146;s note: Support for increased alcohol taxes remains strong. According to
a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation survey conducted in 1997 by Mathematica Policy Research,
Inc., 82 percent of respondents would be willing to raise alcohol taxes by 5 cents per
drink if the funds were used to pay for programs to prevent minors from drinking and to
increase alcohol treatment programs. Nearly three-quarters (70 percent) would support the
tax if it were used to lower other taxes such as income taxes. </p>

    <td><b>What Can Parents Do?</b><br>
    Although I agree with the intent of Rodney Skager&#146;s article (&#147;We&#146;re Not the
    Problem, It&#146;s the Parents!&#148; Vol. 14, No. 1, Winter 1999), it is missing one key
    element. What can parents do, within the family context, to prevent alcohol and other drug
    problems amongst their sons and daughters? They cannot single handedly make that decision
    for their kids, but surely you have an idea of what they can do to help the situation. As
    a parent, and a prevention specialist working with parents, after reading your article I
    am left with no direction. What is your response?<br>
    <i>Bob Walberg</i><br>
    Prevention Education Consultant<br>
    Addictions Foundation of Manitoba<br>
    Canada<p><b>Rodney Skager responds:<br>
    </b>Good question, but not one that can be answered in a way that will make everyone
    happy. I do suggest getting hold of the Harris book The Nurture Assumption and reading
    chapter 14, &#147;What parents can do.&#148;</p>
    <p>Parents of course are very conscious&amp;emdash;or should be&amp;emdash;of the peer
    groups their children join. Affluent parents choose schools and neighborhoods accordingly.
    That is obviously one significant area. As Harris points out, even home schooling is an
    answer to this issue, one pursued by some parents today. Parents also do influence their
    children in many ways&amp;emdash;choice of career, how to behave at home, how to parent,
    and so on.</p>
    <p>Telling parents to talk to their kids about marijuana, as the current U.S. television
    ad blitz recommends, might be a good thing if there were absolute honesty on the part of
    the parent, because kids ask difficult questions and know when we are hiding. But the ads
    don&#146;t recommend such a radical idea, needless to say. Admitting that you used
    marijuana a few times when you were in high school or college and suffered no ill effects
    may not stop your kid from experimenting, but it would help establish an open, honest,
    frank dialog which, in the long run, is more important, in my view. Saying that you never
    tried marijuana if you have of course undercuts your credibility, especially if your kid
    has, and maybe even for many who haven&#146;t. It doesn&#146;t do any good to tell parents
    to talk to kids about marijuana unless the realities of the situation are understood.</td>
