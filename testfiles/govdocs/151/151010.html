<p>The Honorable E. Clay Shaw, Jr. <br>
  Chairman, Subcommittee on Social Security<br>
  Committee on Ways and Means<br>
  House of Representatives<br>
  Washington, D.C. 20515</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Shaw:</p>
<p>Thank you for your interest in the Social Security Administration's disability 
  programs. In a January 27, 2004 letter, you requested that we review allegations 
  made in a letter from a former medical consultant that the Chicago Regional 
  Office may have manipulated its calculation of the Disability Determination 
  Services net accuracy rate by discouraging medical reviewers from finding errors. 
  You also requested an evaluation of the degree to which the Disability Determination 
  Services net accuracy rate performance indicator is being manipulated or has 
  the potential to be manipulated by employees of the Social Security Administration. 
  The results of our review are presented in the enclosed report.</p>
<p>My office is committed to eliminating fraud, waste, and abuse in the Social 
  Security Administration's operations and programs. If you have any questions 
  concerning this matter, please call me or have your staff contact H. Douglas 
  Cunningham, Assistant Inspector General for Congressional and Intra-Governmental 
  Liaison, at (202) 358 6319.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p></p>
<p> Patrick P. O'Carroll, Jr.<br>
  Acting Inspector General</p>

<p>Mission</p>
<p>We improve SSA programs and operations and protect them against fraud, waste, 
  and abuse by conducting independent and objective audits, evaluations, and investigations. 
  We provide timely, useful, and reliable information and advice to Administration 
  officials, the Congress, and the public.</p>
<p> Authority</p>
<p>The Inspector General Act created independent audit and investigative units, 
  called the Office of Inspector General (OIG). The mission of the OIG, as spelled 
  out in the Act, is to:</p>
<p> Conduct and supervise independent and objective audits and investigations 
  relating to agency programs and operations.<br>
  Promote economy, effectiveness, and efficiency within the agency.<br>
  Prevent and detect fraud, waste, and abuse in agency programs and operations.<br>
  Review and make recommendations regarding existing and proposed legislation 
  and regulations relating to agency programs and operations.<br>
  Keep the agency head and the Congress fully and currently informed of problems 
  in agency programs and operations.</p>
<p>To ensure objectivity, the IG Act empowers the IG with:</p>
<p> Independence to determine what reviews to perform.<br>
  Access to all information necessary for the reviews.<br>
  Authority to publish findings and recommendations based on the reviews.</p>
<p> Vision</p>
<p>By conducting independent and objective audits, investigations, and evaluations, 
  we are agents of positive change striving for continuous improvement in the 
  Social Security Administration's programs, operations, and management and in 
  our own office.</p>
<p>Background<br>
  OBJECTIVES</p>
<p>The objectives of our review were to determine whether (1) evidence exists 
  to support allegations that the Social Security Administration (SSA) Chicago 
  Regional Office (RO) manipulated its Disability Determination Services (DDS) 
  net accuracy rate by discouraging reviewers from finding errors and (2) the 
  DDS net accuracy rate calculation process is vulnerable to manipulation.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>SSA assures the quality of initial State disability determinations by reviewing 
  a random sample of allowances and denials from each State. A random, stratified 
  sample of initial allowances and denials is selected from each State by an automated 
  sample selection process at the time of DDS input to the National DDS System. 
  The basic design is to obtain a sample of 70 allowances and 70 denials per quarter 
  per State. Sample cases are sent to the Office of Quality Assurance and Performance 
  Assessment Disability Quality Branch (DQB) in each region for quality assurance 
  review. The review process replicates the DDS' disability determination process 
  to the extent possible. The review team consists of a DQB examiner and one or 
  more medical consultants. Physicians performing medical reviews of disability 
  determinations must always evaluate and rate the sufficiency of medical evidence 
  in the file; current impairment severity and duration; and when applicable, 
  current residual functional capacity, onset, ending and cessation dates; and 
  diary actions. </p>
<p>The quality assurance review process results in the calculation of DDS net 
  accuracy, which is defined as the percentage of correct initial disability determinations. 
  The net accuracy rate is based on the net error rate, which is defined as the 
  number of corrected deficient cases with changed disability decisions, plus 
  the number of deficient cases that are not corrected within 90 days from the 
  end of the calendar quarter, divided by the number of cases reviewed. See Appendix 
  C for an overview of the quality assurance review process for initial disability 
  determinations.</p>
<p>In a letter dated January 27, 2004, Congressman E. Clay Shaw, Jr., asked the 
  Office of Inspector General to review the allegations made in a letter from 
  a former medical consultant that the Chicago RO may have manipulated its calculation 
  of the net accuracy rate by discouraging medical reviewers from finding errors 
  in DDS disability determinations. Congressman Shaw requested an evaluation of 
  the degree to which the DDS net accuracy rate performance indicator is being 
  manipulated or has the potential to be manipulated by employees at SSA. See 
  Appendix B for the scope and methodology of our review.<br>
  <br>
  Results of Review<br>
  Our review did not identify evidence to support allegations that the Chicago 
  RO manipulated its DDS net accuracy rate. Furthermore, the DDS net accuracy 
  rate calculation does not appear to be vulnerable to manipulation because of 
  existing management controls that are in place over the net accuracy rate calculation.</p>
<p>MEDICAL CONSULTANT ALLEGATIONS</p>
<p>In a letter to Congressman E. Clay Shaw, Jr., a medical consultant formerly 
  under contract with the Chicago RO made five specific allegations regarding 
  activities at the Chicago RO that could result in an inaccurate calculation 
  of the DDS net accuracy rate. To determine if the allegations were valid, we 
  conducted interviews with Chicago RO staff and medical consultants currently 
  under contract with the Chicago RO. We also reviewed the policies and procedures 
  in place at the Chicago RO for the review process resulting in the net accuracy 
  rate calculation. The following presents the former medical consultant's allegations 
  and the results of our review of each allegation.</p>
<p>ALLEGATION NUMBER 1: Medical consultants who find few or no medical errors 
  in DDS decisions are awarded more contract hours than those who find many medical 
  errors.</p>
<p>According to staff at the Chicago RO's Center for Disability, the number of 
  contract hours awarded to a medical consultant is based on the amount of work 
  available, the medical consultant's schedule, and the medical consultant's prior 
  work performance in the Region. The Center for Disability staff also stated 
  that the number of errors a medical consultant identifies in his or her reviews 
  of disability determinations does not impact how contract hours are awarded 
  and data on the number of errors medical consultants find in their reviews are 
  not maintained by the RO. Since data on the number of errors medical consultants 
  identify in their reviews does not exist, we could not determine if there was 
  a basis for this allegation. However, during our review no evidence came to 
  our attention that would indicate that contract hours are awarded to a medical 
  consultant based on the number of errors identified in previous reviews of disability 
  determinations. <br>
  <br>
  ALLEGATION NUMBER 2: To avoid negative consequences for finding medical errors 
  in DDS decisions, medical consultants select only easy and fast cases to review.</p>
<p>The Center for Disability staff admitted that in the past, there were some 
  instances of medical consultants who attempted to identify and select cases 
  that were less difficult for review. We were unable to determine why certain 
  medical consultants attempted to select only easy and fast cases for review. 
  However, as of Fiscal Year (FY) 2004, medical consultants do not have a choice 
  in what case they will review, because the Disability Case Adjudication and 
  Review System (DICARS) has a list of cases from which medical consultants must 
  select the oldest case to review. Since the selection is electronic, the ability 
  to select only easy or fast cases is eliminated.</p>
<p>ALLEGATION NUMBER 3: Medical consultants are instructed not to use certain 
  terms or phrases in their narratives on cases.</p>
<p>Medical consultants are instructed to use language that is supported by medical 
  evidence in the case file. Accordingly, the Center for Disability staff will 
  instruct a medical consultant to remove language from a narrative when it reflects 
  a personal opinion that is not supported by medical evidence. For example, medical 
  consultants should not use subjective terms, such as &quot;malingering&quot; 
  or faking symptoms unless they are quoting from a medical report in which the 
  examining physician uses such a term. <br>
  <br>
  ALLEGATION NUMBER 4: The medical consultant was instructed by an administrator 
  of the Regional Office not to find medical errors.</p>
<p>We interviewed five medical consultants currently under contract with the Chicago 
  RO to determine if there was a basis for this allegation. All five medical consultants 
  stated that they had never been given instructions not to find errors. </p>
<p>ALLEGATION NUMBER 5: Occasionally, SSA management insists that physicians come 
  up with a certain medical conclusion, even when the medical evidence does not 
  support this conclusion.</p>
<p>We asked the five medical consultants we interviewed if they were asked to 
  arrive at a medical conclusion that was not supported by medical evidence. All 
  five medical consultants stated that they had never been asked to make unsupported 
  medical conclusions. Furthermore, random samples of medical consultants' cases 
  are selected for quality review by the Center for Disability and the review 
  is performed by an employee that had no prior involvement in the case. With 
  the absence of collusion, this separation of duties in the review process would 
  identify unsupported medical conclusions. According to staff at the Center for 
  Disability, quality reviewers and medical consultants might disagree on a medical 
  conclusion; however, they either discuss the disagreement until it is resolved 
  or refer the case to a lead medical consultant for resolution. </p>
<p>We also compared the Chicago Region's net accuracy rate to the rates for other 
  regions for FYs 2001 through 2003. We found that the net accuracy rates for 
  the Chicago Region did not differ significantly from the rates of other regions. 
  In addition, the rank of the Chicago Region's net accuracy rates as compared 
  to other regions varied during the period under review, which would discount 
  any sustained net accuracy rate manipulation. These comparisons, along with 
  the above facts, make it unlikely that the Chicago Region manipulated data to 
  improve its net accuracy rate. See Appendix D for our comparison of national 
  and regional net accuracy rates.</p>
<p>VULNERABILITY OF NET ACCURACY RATE TO MANIPULATION</p>
<p>We found that it would be difficult to manipulate the data used to calculate 
  net accuracy because of the controls in place for the review process resulting 
  in the net accuracy calculation. Given these controls, it would require a substantial 
  amount of collusion among SSA employees and/or medical consultants for data 
  to be manipulated. We found no evidence of collusion during our review. The 
  following is a summary of the controls in place over the net accuracy rate calculation.</p>
<p>Cases included in the net accuracy rate calculation are reviewed by at least 
  two staff including a DQB examiner and a medical consultant. </p>
<p>Cases are randomly selected for a quality review by the Center for Disability 
  and the review is performed by a policy specialist with no prior involvement 
  with the cases. </p>
<p>All cases with disability determination errors are reviewed by a DQB team leader 
  before being returned to the DDS for correction. </p>
<p>DQB team leaders review a random sample of cases where no errors are identified 
  before the cases are released for effectuation of the determination. </p>
<p>If disagreements about the disability determinations in cases occur throughout 
  the review process, other medical consultants, DQB team leaders, or DQB management 
  review the cases. </p>
<p>In addition to the work performed for this review, the Office of the Inspector 
  General's Performance Indicator Audit: DDS Net Accuracy Rate-Allowances and 
  Denials Combined (A-15-04-14074) is currently in process. This audit will address 
  critical controls over the data generation and calculation processes for the 
  net accuracy rate, including tests of DICARS. <br>
  <br>
  Conclusion</p>
<p>We found no evidence to support allegations that the SSA Chicago RO manipulated 
  its DDS net accuracy rate by discouraging reviewers from finding errors. Furthermore, 
  the DDS net accuracy rate calculation does not appear to be vulnerable to manipulation 
  because of existing management controls that are in place over the net accuracy 
  rate calculation.</p>
