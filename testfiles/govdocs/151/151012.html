Highlights of GAO-04-536, a report to congressional requesters 

Why GAO Did This Study:

The nation’s roads, highways, and bridges are essential to mobility but 
can have negative effects on plants, animals, and the habitats that 
support them (collectively called ecosystems in this report). Federally 
funded transportation projects progress through three planning phases: 
long range (20 or more years), short range (3 to 5 years), and early 
project development, (collectively defined as planning in this report) 
before undergoing environmental review (which includes assessing air 
and water quality, ecosystems, and other impacts) required under the 
National Environmental Policy Act. Federal law requires planners to 
consider protecting and enhancing the environment in the first two 
phases, but does not specify how and does not require such 
consideration in the third phase. 

GAO reported on (1) the extent to which transportation planners 
consider ecosystem conservation in planning, (2) the effects of such 
consideration, and (3) the factors that encourage or discourage such 
consideration. GAO contacted 36 planning agencies (24 states and 12 of 
approximately 380 metropolitan planning organizations), as well as 
officials in 22 resource agencies that maintain ecological data and 
administer environmental laws. The Department of Transportation and 
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers had no comments on a draft of this report. 
The Department of the Interior generally agreed with the contents of 
our draft report.

What GAO Found:

Of the 36 transportation planning agencies that GAO contacted, 31 
considered ecosystem conservation in transportation planning, using a 
variety of methods. For example, Colorado conducts studies that 
incorporate ecosystem issues to guide future transportation decisions, 
uses advance planning to avoid or reduce impacts, and actively involves 
stakeholders. New Mexico uses planning studies to identify locations 
where wildlife are likely to cross highways and design underpasses to 
allow safe crossings. In the absence of specific requirements, federal 
agencies encourage ecosystem consideration in planning. 

Planners and state resource agency officials most frequently reported 
reduced ecosystem impacts and improved cost and schedule estimates as 
positive effects. For example, planners in New York changed a planned 
five-lane highway to a lower-impact two-lane boulevard after weighing 
the area’s mobility needs and the project’s impact on the surrounding 
habitat. In Massachusetts, resource agency officials said that 
addressing ecological requirements in planning improved schedule 
certainty during the federally required environmental review. 
Furthermore, planners and resource agency officials reported that 
working together has improved relationships between their agencies, 
thereby allowing ecosystem concerns to be resolved in a more timely and 
predictable manner. Officials also listed negative effects, such as 
higher project costs and more work for resource agencies.

Conservation:

[End of figure]

Constituent support from agency staff, political appointees, or the 
public was the most frequently reported factor (27 instances) that 
encouraged planners to consider ecosystem conservation. For example, 
New Mexico’s “pro-environment” culture reportedly encourages planners 
to consider ecosystem conservation. The cost in time and resources of 
considering ecosystem conservation was most often cited as a 
discouraging factor (23 instances). For example, Colorado planners 
cited the significant amount of time needed to collect and maintain 
access to ecosystem data.

Congressional Requesters:

The nation's vast network of roads, highways, and bridges is essential 
to interstate commerce, economic growth, national defense, and leisure 
mobility. Yet the construction, improvement, rehabilitation, and even 
maintenance of the tens of thousands of miles of this transportation 
infrastructure each year can cause permanent environmental change by 
disturbing plant and animal habitats, creating barriers to animal 
movement, and producing other impacts. By one estimate, roads 
ecologically affect about one-fifth of the U.S. land mass.[Footnote 1]

Although federal agencies must assess the environmental impact of 
proposed federally funded transportation projects under the National 
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), state and metropolitan planners have 
the opportunity to consider these issues earlier during three planning 
phases: (1) as they develop long-range (20 or more years) plans; (2) as 
they develop short-range (3-5 years) plans known as transportation 
improvement programs; and (3) as they conduct early project 
planning.[Footnote 2] The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st 
Century requires that planners develop these long-range plans and 
short-range programs and that the plans consider projects and 
strategies that will, among other things, protect and enhance the 
environment. However, the act provides no guidance on how planners 
should meet this requirement.

You requested that we identify the extent to which planners consider 
the conservation of plants, animals, and the habitats that support them 
(collectively called "ecosystems" in this report) in transportation 
planning.[Footnote 3] In response, we asked transportation planners and 
others to identify (1) the extent to which state and metropolitan area 
transportation planners consider ecosystem conservation and how federal 
agencies are involved; (2) the effects, if any, of considering 
ecosystem conservation during transportation planning; and (3) the 
factors that encourage or discourage transportation planners from 
considering ecosystem conservation.

To carry out this work, we reviewed laws and regulations relating to 
transportation planning and ecosystem conservation and spoke with 
officials of federal transportation agencies, resource agencies (those 
having responsibility for maintaining ecological data and administering 
federal environmental laws) and transportation and environmental 
conservation associations. We also selected a nonprobability sample of 
24 states and 12 metropolitan planning organizations, primarily on the 
basis of geographic diversity, to reflect a variety of 
ecosystems.[Footnote 4] We spoke with officials in each of our sample 
states' departments of transportation and metropolitan planning 
organizations to ascertain (1) the extent to which, if at all, they 
consider ecosystem conservation during state and metropolitan area 
transportation planning before they are required to consider the 
proposed project's environmental impact under NEPA; (2) anticipated and 
observed effects of considering ecosystems during transportation 
planning; and (3) factors that may encourage or discourage planners 
from considering ecosystems during transportation planning. To gain an 
understanding of the breadth and depth of each sample states' and 
metropolitan planning organizations' consideration of ecosystem 
conservation in transportation planning, we asked a variety of 
questions about how planners implement this approach, whether and how 
they involve stakeholders, what types and sources of data they 
consider, what positive and negative effects they have observed or 
expect to observe, and what factors encourage and discourage them from 
these efforts. (See app. I for a complete listing of these questions.) 
To obtain an additional perspective on the information that planning 
agencies reported, we contacted officials in resource agencies in 22 of 
our sample states.[Footnote 5] We asked these officials how they are 
involved in transportation planning, whether they collect ecological 
data and make these data available to transportation planners, what 
they believe are the effects of considering ecosystem conservation in 
transportation planning, and what factors encourage and discourage them 
from participating in transportation planning. (See app. II for a 
complete listing of these questions.) Finally, we reviewed 
transportation plans that were available from the state departments of 
transportation and metropolitan planning organizations in our sample. 
Although we requested planners' and resource agency officials' 
observations about the effects of considering ecosystem conservation in 
transportation planning, we did not evaluate the effectiveness of their 
efforts, or determine whether one agency's efforts were more effective 
than another's. We did not verify the statements of state and 
metropolitan transportation planners or resource agency officials 
because it was not practical to do so. The results of our work cannot 
be projected to all states and metropolitan planning organizations. In 
order to make reliable generalizations, we would have needed to 
randomly select a larger sample of states and metropolitan planning 
organizations than time allowed. We conducted our work from May 2003 
through April 2004 in accordance with generally accepted government 
auditing standards. (See app. III for additional information on our 
scope and methodology.):

Results in Brief:

The majority of the state and metropolitan planners that we contacted 
reported considering ecosystem conservation in transportation 
planning, and federal agencies encourage them to do so. (See fig. 1.) 
Planners in 31 of the 36 agencies (86 percent) described considering 
ecosystem conservation at varying points in transportation planning 
using a variety of methods. Planners in four statesæOregon, South 
Dakota, Colorado, and North Carolinaædescribed extensively considering 
ecosystem conservation during planning through methods such as studies 
that incorporate ecosystem issues to guide future transportation 
decisions, advance planning to avoid or reduce ecosystem impacts, and 
active stakeholder participation. Twenty-two of the 31 said they 
conduct corridor studies or use project screening, among other methods, 
to consider ecosystem conservation.[Footnote 6] For example, New Mexico 
used corridor studies to plan for, among other things, where bear and 
deer were likely to cross highways, and designed underpasses for them 
at these locations to help prevent vehicle collisions with wildlife. 
Planners in two agencies described focusing most of their ecosystem 
conservation efforts on ecological resources within areas of specific 
interest to their region, such as wetlands. Finally, planners in three 
agencies reported using mainly resource agency data and input from 
other stakeholders to determine whether their transportation plans 
could affect ecosystems, or incorporated in their transportation plans 
locally developed plans that consider ecosystem conservation. Planners 
in five agencies said they do not consider ecosystem conservation in 
transportation planning before projects are subject to federal 
environmental review because, among other things, these agencies lack 
the time and resources or guidance on how to do so. Officials we 
contacted in state wildlife conservation or natural resource 
departments, as well as similar resource agencies, generally agreed 
that they assist transportation planners in considering ecosystem 
conservation during transportation planning. However, 11 of the state 
resource agency officials said they would like to be more involved in 
transportation planning or commented that communication with their 
state departments of transportation could be improved. Although federal 
law does not specifically require planners to consider ecosystem 
conservation in transportation plans, the Federal Highway 
Administration and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service encourage state 
transportation planners to do so. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 
and the Army Corps of Engineers often assist planners by providing 
ecosystem data or comments on transportation plans.

Planning:

[End of figure]

The effects of considering ecosystem conservation in transportation 
planning were mostly positive, according to the planners and state 
resource agency officials we interviewed. Specifically, planners in 29 
of the 31 agencies that consider ecosystem conservation in 
transportation planning, and 16 of the 19 state resource agency 
officials that we interviewed in the states that consider ecosystem 
conservation, described one or more positive effects on the 
environment. These positive effects include conserving habitat, 
reducing habitat fragmentation, or scheduling construction times to 
reduce impacts on breeding of certain species. For example, 
metropolitan planners in New York told us that they changed plans for a 
five-lane highway to a lower-impact two-lane boulevard after finding 
that the wider highway would significantly affect the surrounding 
habitat and that, according to an updated traffic study, the wider 
highway was not needed to ensure mobility. In addition, 12 planners and 
three state resource agency officials reported that considering 
ecosystem conservation in transportation planning leads to more certain 
project costs and schedules. In Massachusetts, for example, resource 
agency officials told us that addressing ecosystem conservation in 
planning improves schedule certainty as the project progresses through 
federally required environmental reviews. In 13 instances, 
transportation planners and state resource agencies reported that 
working together to address ecosystem issues in transportation planning 
had improved relationships between their agencies, which allowed 
environmental issues to be resolved in a timely and predictable manner. 
Officials also reported other positive effects, including better 
relationships with the public and a heightened awareness of ecosystem 
issues among transportation planning staff. On the other hand, eight 
transportation planners and one state resource agency official reported 
that addressing ecosystem issues during project planning resulted in 
negative effects, such as higher project costs and workload increases 
for resource agencies.

Support from constituents and transportation agency personnel was the 
key factor that reportedly encouraged transportation planners to 
consider ecosystem conservation, while the cost in time and resources 
was the key discouraging factor identified. Of the 31 planners we 
interviewed who said they considered ecosystem conservation in 
transportation planning, 27 cited support from staff in their own 
agencies, political appointees, or the public as an encouraging factor. 
For example, planners in Oregon and New Mexico told us that the state's 
pro-environment culture and citizens' concerns about protecting 
ecological resources encourage them to consider ecosystem conservation. 
Planners mentioned other encouraging factors that are similar to the 
positive effects they identified, such as more certain cost estimates 
and project implementation schedules and fewer adverse effects on 
ecological resources. The most frequently cited discouraging factor, 
identified by 23 of the planners we interviewed, was the time and 
resources required to consider ecosystem conservation. For example, 
transportation planners in Colorado and North Carolina told us that 
collecting and maintaining access to the data needed to consider 
ecosystem conservation in transportation planning, while beneficial, 
required significant time and resources. The time and resources 
required were also a factor that discouraged three of the five agencies 
that do not consider ecosystem conservation in transportation planning. 
Other planners reported discouraging factors such as difficulty in 
obtaining stakeholders' involvement and pressure from proponents of 
development to move forward with projects without considering ecosystem 
conservation.

The Department of Transportation and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers had 
no comments on a draft of this report. The Department of the Interior 
generally agreed with the contents of our draft report and provided 
technical clarifications, which we incorporated as appropriate.

Background:

Federally funded highway projects are typically completed in four 
phases:

* Planning: State departments of transportation and metropolitan 
planning organizations begin with a vision and a set of long-term goals 
for their future transportation system, and translate these into long-
range transportation plans and short-range plans known as 
transportation improvement programs. Although not required by federal 
law, a state department of transportation may perform additional 
planning once a project is started, such as consulting with resource 
agencies to determine the project's potential ecosystem impacts. We 
refer to this final phase of planning as "pre-NEPA planning" in this 
report.

* Preliminary design and environmental review: State departments of 
transportation identify a project's cost, level of service, and 
construction location; assess the potential effects on environmental 
resources as required by NEPA; and select the preferred alternative.

* Final design and right-of-way acquisition: State departments of 
transportation finalize design plans, acquire property, and relocate 
utilities.

* Construction: State departments of transportation award construction 
contracts, oversee construction, and accept the completed project.

The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century lays out general 
requirements for transportation planning and consideration of the 
environment. The act requires that state and metropolitan area long-
range plans consider projects and strategies that will, among other 
things, protect and enhance the environment. It also requires states 
and metropolitan planning offices to provide the public with an 
opportunity to comment on the transportation improvement programs. 
Governors review and approve metropolitan transportation improvement 
programs within their respective states.

However, the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century does not 
specifically address how ecosystem conservation should be considered in 
transportation planning. The act does not require that long-range 
transportation plans contain projects and strategies that protect and 
enhance the environment, and provides no guidance on how planners are 
to consider ecosystem conservation. Although the Federal Highway 
Administration reviews and approves each state's transportation 
improvement program to, among other things, ensure that the plans meet 
the requirements of the act, failure to meet these requirements is not 
reviewable in court.

Congress is considering the 6-year surface transportation 
reauthorization bill. Separate bills have passed in each 
chamber.[Footnote 7] The House bill leaves in place the existing 
legislation's framework of requiring planners to consider the 
protection and enhancement of the environment in their plans. The 
Senate bill provides more explicit language on environmental 
considerations and new consultation requirements for planners. 
Specifically, it indicates that protecting and enhancing the 
environment includes "the protection of habitat, water quality, and 
agricultural and forest land while minimizing invasive species." 
Additionally, the Senate bill requires that long-range transportation 
plans include a discussion of (1) the types of potential habitat 
mitigation activities that may assist in compensating for habitat loss 
and (2) the areas that may have the greatest potential to restore and 
maintain habitat types affected by the plan. Further, the bill requires 
planning agencies to consult with state and local agencies responsible 
for protecting natural resources.

In addition to meeting the planning requirements of the Transportation 
Equity Act for the 21st Century and NEPA, planning agencies must adhere 
to a number of other federal laws pertaining to transportation and the 
environment before construction can begin on federally funded projects, 
including:

* The Endangered Species Act of 1973 is intended to conserve threatened 
and endangered species and the ecosystems on which they depend. Section 
7 of the act requires federal agencies to ensure that projects they 
authorize, fund, or carry out, including transportation projects, are 
not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any threatened or 
endangered species (including fish, wildlife, and plants) or result in 
the destruction or adverse modification of designated critical habitat 
for these species. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National 
Marine Fisheries Service administer and enforce this law.

* The Clean Water Act of 1977 is intended to restore and maintain the 
chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the nation's waters 
through the prevention and elimination of pollution. Section 404 of the 
act pertains to wetland development.[Footnote 8] Under this section, 
the Army Corps of Engineers provides permits to transportation agencies 
whose projects affect wetlands. To obtain permits, applicants must 
first attempt to avoid adverse impacts to wetlands or, if this is not 
possible, to minimize the impacts to the extent practicable and 
compensate for any unavoidable impacts through mitigation.

To comply with these and other laws, transportation planners may 
coordinate with a variety of state and federal agencies. They do so to 
obtain ecological data, such as information on threatened and 
endangered species and wetlands; advice on how to address adverse 
impacts of transportation projects; or both.

Most Planners Contacted Reported Considering Ecosystem Conservation 
during Transportation Planning:

Of the 36 transportation planners we interviewed, a total of 31 (21 out 
of 24 in state departments of transportation and 10 out of 12 in 
metropolitan planning organizations) reported using various methods to 
consider ecosystem conservation during transportation planning. Some of 
these 31 planning agencies begin considering ecosystem conservation in 
transportation planning as they develop their long-range plans while 
others begin considering ecosystems conservation just prior to starting 
the federally required environmental review under NEPA. Four of these 
agencies reported using multiple approaches to consider ecosystem 
conservation, 22 stressed their use of corridor studies or project 
screening, 2 emphasized their consideration of the ecological resources 
of specific interest in the surrounding area, and 3 reported using 
methods similar to other agencies but do not use corridor studies or 
project screening or focus on specific resources. (See fig. 2.) 
Planners in 5 agencies said they do not consider ecosystem conservation 
during transportation planning. In the absence of specific federal 
requirements to consider ecosystem conservation in transportation 
planning, federal agencies encourage state and metropolitan area 
planners to do so and they provide technical assistance.

Transportation Planning for 36 Planning Agencies:

Note: Other methods do not include corridor studies, project screening, 
or focus on specific ecological resources.

Planning Agencies Vary on How Early They Consider Ecosystem 
Conservation:

Of the 31 planning agencies that consider ecosystem conservation in 
transportation planning, 21 (68 percent) first do so as they develop 
their long-range plans. (See table 1.) Four agencies (13 percent) begin 
considering ecosystem conservation as they develop transportation 
improvement programs. The remaining six agencies (19 percent) begin 
just before starting the federally required environmental review under 
NEPA (pre-NEPA planning). Twenty of 31 agencies reported considering 
ecosystem conservation at more than one point, and 14 reported 
considering ecosystem conservation during corridor studies that begin 
at varying times during planning.

Four State Planning Agencies Consider Ecosystem Conservation Using 
Several Approaches:

Oregon, South Dakota, Colorado, and North Carolina reported extensively 
considering ecosystem conservation in transportation planning using 
several approaches. The Oregon Department of Transportation has 
included a policy in its long-range plan to, among other things, 
maintain or improve the natural and built environment, including fish 
passage and habitat, wildlife habitat and migration routes, vegetation, 
and wetlands. The long-range transportation plans of Colorado and North 
Carolina each contain specific references to goals or policies to 
conserve ecosystems, while South Dakota's plan contains a less specific 
goal aimed at protecting the environment.

Oregon planners said they meet monthly with state and federal resource 
agencies and with the Federal Highway Administration to discuss project 
proposals before beginning to address NEPA requirements. To plan for 
each project's potential impact, the planners said they obtain data 
from a variety of sources, such as field studies led by biologists, the 
Oregon Natural Heritage Data System, the National Wetlands Inventory, 
and the state department of transportation's ecological survey of all 
the roads in the state.[Footnote 9] The planners then use these data 
and a set of criteria developed by stakeholders to screen projects 
before programming them for construction.

The South Dakota Department of Transportation becomes increasingly 
involved with federal and state resource agency stakeholders--including 
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; Army Corp of Engineers; U.S. Forest 
Service; South Dakota Game, Fish, and Parks; and the South Dakota 
Department of Natural Resources--as a project evolves from a conceptual 
plan through final design. Initially, the department works with state 
resource agency stakeholders to obtain ecological data in geographic 
information system or paper formats that identify ecological resources 
located within the study boundaries and uses these data to avoid 
sensitive habitat.[Footnote 10] The department then develops plans to 
avoid, minimize, or mitigate the project's impact. Later, when more 
specific project design plans become available, the department works 
with resource agency stakeholders to determine habitat locations, 
adjust project alignments to avoid habitat, or consider other design 
changes to minimize the project's impact before beginning the 
environmental review required under NEPA.

The Colorado Department of Transportation has assigned one of its 
employees to work with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to focus on 
transportation issues, according to state transportation planners. The 
planners said that numerous stakeholders from federal, state, and 
nongovernmental agencies assist the department in determining species 
and habitat locations throughout the state and in focusing efforts on 
conservation and mitigation planning. The planners reported that the 
department is conducting advance planning to integrate ecosystem issues 
into corridor studies that they expect to develop over the life of the 
long-range plan. They also said that Colorado has established a 
revolving fund to acquire habitat for mitigation before specific 
projects are actually developed.

Finally, the North Carolina Department of Transportation considers 
ecosystem conservation in transportation planning by making extensive 
use of resource agency personnel and geographic information system 
data. According to state planners, the department funds 33 resource 
agency positions to help identify and resolve ecosystem issues early in 
project development. The planners told us they use the geographic 
information system data to identify where ecosystems may conflict with 
transportation plans and determine the potential cost of addressing the 
conflicts. They said that the department, in partnership with the Army 
Corps of Engineers, also identifies and acquires property for future 
mitigation. Finally, the planners said that the department assists 
small metropolitan planning organizations and localities in broad-based 
ecosystem screening on all projects to identify any ecological issues 
and potential costs associated with those issues.

Most Planners Said They Considered Ecosystem Conservation in 
Transportation Planning When Conducting Corridor Studies or Screening 
Projects:

Twenty-two of the 31 planners who consider ecosystem conservation 
during transportation planning conduct corridor studies or screen 
projects for ecosystem impact. These planners survey ecosystems in the 
corridor and take steps to avoid or mitigate ecological impacts. For 
example, planners in New Mexico, with data from their Department of 
Game and Fish, used corridor studies to identify areas of high 
potential for animal-vehicle crashes. Planners described how such 
planning studies led to the construction of underpasses that allow bear 
and deer to pass beneath highways in the state. (See fig. 3.) Nebraska 
reviews ecological databases to identify potential impacts of planned 
transportation projects; considers avoidance strategies; and, if 
avoidance is not possible, documents the conflict so that project 
designers can develop mitigation measures, according to state 
transportation planners.

Highway Right-of-way without Danger of Collisions with Vehicles:

Some planning agencies screen out projects from their plans that would 
have undesirable ecosystem impacts. For example, metropolitan planners 
for the Merrimack Valley area in Massachusetts told us that they use 
data from a geographic information system in planning to identify 
ecological resources in the path of proposed projects. Using this 
information, together with public comments on the project, they 
determine whether the ecological impacts require that the project be 
redesigned or terminated prior to beginning the environmental review 
required under NEPA.

Nearly all planning agencies that develop corridor studies or use 
ecosystem impacts to screen projects involve stakeholders in developing 
their plans. For example, Alaska invites federal agenciesæincluding the 
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Army Corps of Engineers, National Park 
Service, Bureau of Land Management, and National Marine Fisheries 
Serviceæand its Departments of Fish and Game, and Natural Resources to 
meetings to provide input for transportation plans. After a meeting, 
each agency has the opportunity to write a letter of concern about 
specific resources or areas. Metropolitan planning organizations, local 
governments, municipal officials, tribes, elected officials, and anyone 
else who has expressed interest in Alaska's transportation planning are 
also invited to review and comment on transportation plans.

Of the 22 planning agencies that consider ecosystems by conducting 
corridor studies or project screening, 12 include ecosystem 
conservation as a policy or goal in their long-range transportation 
plans. For example, the Central Virginia Metropolitan Planning 
Organization's long-range transportation plan calls for an assessment 
of the social and environmental impacts of the transportation plan's 
recommendations, and establishes the policy of removing projects with 
unacceptably high environmental or community impacts from planning 
consideration.

In addition to considering ecosystem conservation in transportation 
planning through corridor studies or as a means to screen potential 
projects, these 22 planning agencies reported using one or more of the 
following common methods either in addition to or in combination with 
corridor studies or screening:

* using resource agencies as stakeholders in developing transportation 
plans;

* considering the views of environmental interest groups in developing 
transportation plans;

* using resource agency data to determine mitigation requirements, 
develop alternative locations, or to avoid planning projects with 
unacceptably high ecosystem impact;

* using geographic information systems to determine ecological resource 
locations;

* providing funding for ecological impact studies;

* having planning agency or resource agency personnel conduct site 
visits to determine or confirm the location of ecological resources; 
and:

* incorporating in transportation plans local plans that have 
considered ecosystem conservation.[Footnote 11]

Six of these agencies reported using at least 4 of the methods listed 
above. The remaining 16 used 3 or fewer methods. Because we did not 
evaluate the effectiveness of these methods, the number of methods used 
by a planning agency does not necessarily indicate effectiveness. (See 
table 4 in app. IV for a summary of the specific methods that each 
agency reported using.):

Two Agencies Focus on One or More Specific Ecological Concerns in the 
Area:

Transportation planners in Georgia told us they focus on preserving the 
state's wetlands through mitigation banking.[Footnote 12] The state 
department of transportation has established funding accounts to 
purchase land for wetland mitigation banking and to pay for consultants 
to design wetland mitigation banks, according to planners in Georgia. 
They told us that the department has also entered into a memorandum of 
agreement with a state resource agency for the long-term maintenance of 
these mitigation banks. These planners said that nongovernmental 
organizations, including The Nature Conservancy, Georgia Trust for 
Public Land, and Georgia Conservancy, help identify properties for sale 
and conduct on-site reviews of potential sites for wetland mitigation 
banks. Federal resource agencies assist by reviewing proposed land 
acquisitions to determine if the land is suitable for use as a wetland 
mitigation bank, according to the planners. They added that, when 
transportation projects are at the conceptual design stage, state 
resource agencies identify wetlands, streams, and endangered species 
habitats that could be adversely affected by the project and point out 
avoidance or mitigation opportunities.

Planners in Montana's Yellowstone County/Billings metropolitan area 
told us that their focus is on the natural resources of the Yellowstone 
River corridor and the Rim Rocks. These planners said they consider 
ecosystem conservation in planning transportation projects that would 
affect these natural resources, primarily through consultations with 
stakeholders such as the Yellowstone River Parks Association, Bike Net, 
local government representatives, planning boards, and neighborhood 
task forces. The planners said these planning boards and neighborhood 
task forces are involved throughout transportation planning.

Three Agencies Consider Ecosystem Conservation in Transportation 
Planning Through Other Methods:

The Delaware Department of Transportation, Butte County Association of 
Governments, California, and Madison Athens-Clarke Oconee Regional 
Transportation Study (the metropolitan planning organization in Athens, 
Georgia) reported considering ecosystem conservation in transportation 
planning by using some of the same methods used by other agencies but 
do not use corridor studies, project screening, or focus on a specific 
ecological resource. Each of these agencies includes ecosystem 
conservation as a policy or goal in its long-range transportation plan. 
Delaware Department of Transportation planners said they consider input 
from resource agencies and environmental interest groups and use 
geographic information system data to determine transportation 
projects' potential impact on ecological resources and develop 
alternatives as needed. Planners at the Butte County Association of 
Governments told us they receive input from resource agencies to 
determine mitigation requirements and use geographic information system 
data to determine ecological resource locations. Finally, the Madison 
Athens-Clarke Oconee Regional Transportation Study planners said that 
local land use plans consider ecosystem conservation as it relates to 
transportation and they incorporate the local plans in the metropolitan 
area's transportation plans.

Five Agencies Do Not Consider Ecosystem Conservation in Transportation 
Planning:

Planners in the Arizona, New Hampshire, and Illinois departments of 
transportation, as well as metropolitan planners in Great Falls City, 
Montana, and Montachussett, Massachusetts, said they do not consider 
ecosystem conservation in transportation planning and instead rely on 
compliance with NEPA to address ecological issues. The reported factors 
that discouraged these agencies from considering ecosystem conservation 
in transportation planning include a lack of time and resources 
required or guidance on how to do so. These factors are discussed in 
more detail in the final section of this report.

State Resource Agency Officials Generally Agreed That They Are Involved 
in Transportation Planning but Would Like More Involvement:

Resource agency officials in 19 of the 21 states that consider 
ecosystem conservation in transportation planning generally agreed that 
they assist transportation planners in doing so. (We were not able to 
contact resource agency officials in the two remaining states.[Footnote 
13]) However, over half (11) of these resource agency officials said 
that they would like to be more involved in transportation planning or 
that communication with their state's department of transportation 
could be improved. For example, officials of the Oklahoma Department of 
Wildlife Conservation explained that they need to be involved early in 
transportation planning because the pressure from supporters of 
transportation projects often results in concerns about ecosystems 
surfacing as afterthoughts. Similarly, officials in Utah's Division of 
Wildlife Resources said that they are involved too late in planning 
because the project design is already set and budgeting for necessary 
mitigation sometimes has been inadequate.

Federal Agencies Encourage Consideration of Ecosystem Conservation in 
Transportation Planning:

Although federal law does not specifically require planners to consider 
ecosystem conservation in transportation plans, the Federal Highway 
Administration encourages state and metropolitan planners to do so by 
identifying and promoting exemplary initiatives that are unique, 
innovative, attain a high-level environmental standard, or are 
recognized as particularly valuable from an environmental perspective, 
according to the agency's fiscal year 2004 performance plan. These 
could be planning or project-level initiatives that involve, for 
example, designing mitigation projects that support wildlife movement 
and habitat connectivity, developing watershed-based environmental 
assessment and mitigation approaches, or using wetland banking. The 
agency has identified eight such initiatives and plans to identify and 
promote at least 30 initiatives by September 30, 2007.

North Carolina's Ecosystem Enhancement Program is one of the eight 
exemplary initiatives that the Federal Highway Administration has 
identified. In view of a rapidly expanding transportation program with 
a high volume of projects affecting an estimated 5,000 acres of 
wetlands and 900,000 feet of streams over 7 years, North Carolina plans 
to consider and mitigate the potential impacts of many planned projects 
in a comprehensive manner by assessing, restoring, enhancing, and 
preserving ecosystem functions and compensating for impacts at the 
watershed level. This approach to ecosystem conservation aims to 
decouple ecosystem mitigation from individual project reviews.

Federal Highway Administration officials believe that such integrated 
approaches help break down organizational barriers between state 
departments of transportation and state resource agencies. They added 
that publicizing exemplary initiatives helps show that addressing 
ecosystem conservation in transportation planning improves working 
relationships between these agencies and facilitates interagency 
cooperation in the future. As noted in the next section of this report, 
many planners and resource agency officials that we interviewed cited 
improved interagency relationships as a positive effect of considering 
ecosystem conservation in transportation planning.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service also encourages state departments of 
transportation and state resource agencies to share project planning 
and ecosystem information to incorporate more forethought to wildlife 
habitats, before project designs are set and while flexibility still 
exists, according to agency officials. To this end, the Service, in 
cooperation with the International Association of Fish and Wildlife 
Agencies, has conducted several regional workshops on state wildlife 
conservation plans. Officials told us that during these workshops they 
discussed how the plans could be used to provide transportation 
planners with important information that they could consider in 
transportation planning.[Footnote 14]

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and other federal resource agencies 
also administer and enforce environmental laws and generally help state 
planners consider ecosystem conservation by responding to requests for 
data and providing comments on transportation plans. The federal 
agencies most frequently consulted by the transportation planners we 
interviewed were the Fish and Wildlife Service and the Army Corps of 
Engineers. Transportation planners said they often ask these resource 
agencies to provide ecological data from geographic information systems 
or ecological maps to help identify and evaluate a project's impact. 
Many planners also said these federal resource agencies provide 
technical expertise or actively participate in transportation planning. 
For example, a New York Department of Transportation planner told us 
that the Fish and Wildlife Service and the Army Corps of Engineers 
provide technical expertise on the long-term impacts of transportation 
projects on ecosystems.

Planners and Resource Agency Officials Reported Mainly Positive Effects 
of Considering Ecosystem Conservation:

Regardless of the ways planning agencies consider ecosystem 
conservation in transportation planning, 29 of the 31 transportation 
planners and 16 of 19 resource agency officials we interviewed reported 
one or more positive effects of doing so.[Footnote 15] These officials 
listed fewer negative effects.

Twenty-eight planners and resource agency officials reported that 
considering ecosystem conservation in transportation planning enabled 
them to avoid or reduce adverse impacts on ecological resources--the 
most frequently reported positive effect. (See fig. 4.) For example, 
planners and state resource agency officials reported:

* preventing irreparable habitat damage in New York by changing 
planning from a five-lane highway to planning for a lower-impact two-
lane boulevard after a study revealed that the original project would 
be detrimental to the surrounding habitat, and updated traffic studies 
indicated that the wider highway was not needed to ensure mobility;

* decreasing habitat fragmentation in North Carolina by using 
geographic information system data on state ecological resources during 
project planning to avoid or mitigate unacceptable potential impacts on 
habitat; and:

* working with the state resource agency in Nebraska to identify 
preferred times for construction in order to reduce impacts on the 
breeding of certain species.

Figure 4: Effects of Considering Ecosystem Conservation in 
Transportation Planning Reported by Planners and Resource Agency 
Officials:

[See PDF for image]

[End of figure]

Fifteen transportation planners and state resource agency officials 
reported that considering ecosystem conservation improves a project's 
cost and schedule estimates. For example, planners and state resource 
agencies reported:

* better project cost estimating in Colorado because planners become 
aware of, and can plan to avoid, unacceptable adverse impacts on 
ecological resources;

* improved schedule certainty in Massachusetts, because addressing 
state resource agency requirements during planning provides more 
certainty that projects will not need to be redesigned to meet these 
requirements later, during federally required environmental reviews; 
and:

* improved preparedness to address ecological issues during the 
development of a project in California by identifying those issues 
early in planning.

In 13 instances, transportation planners and state resource agency 
officials reported improved relationships between departments of 
transportation and state resource agencies. For example, improved 
relationships through partnership and coordination among stakeholders 
can help resolve environmental issues in a timely and predictable 
manner. Additional positive effects that planners and state resource 
agency officials cited include an increased awareness of ecosystem 
conservation among the transportation planning agency's staff, an 
improved public image of the department of transportation, and a 
stimulus to consider transportation alternatives such as transit.

Compared with the number of positive effects attributed to considering 
ecosystem conservation in transportation planning, planners and 
resource agency officials reported relatively few negative effects. 
Planners in South Dakota and at the Benton-Franklin Council of 
Governments, Washington, told us that considering ecosystem 
conservation in transportation planning requires additional cost and 
time. A resource agency official in Iowa said that working with 
planners to determine project impacts and select mitigation sites adds 
to the agency's workload. Finally, planners in Louisiana noted that the 
general public, as well as elected officials who support specific 
projects, become dissatisfied with the state department of 
transportation when environmental issues affect a project's delivery.

Support from Constituents and Transportation Agency Personnel Most 
Often Encouraged Consideration of Ecosystem Conservation:

Support from constituents and transportation agency personnel was the 
most often reported factor that encouraged planners to consider 
ecosystem conservation in transportation planning. The cost in staff 
time and money was the most often reported discouraging factor for 
agencies that reported considering ecosystem conservation. Planners at 
three of the five agencies, who said they do not consider ecosystem 
conservation in transportation planning, also cited the cost in time 
and resources, while the remaining two listed other discouraging 
factors.

Planners Identified Support from Constituents and Transportation Agency 
Personnel and Other Encouraging Factors:

Twenty-seven of the 31 transportation planners we interviewed, who said 
they consider ecosystem conservation in transportation planning, cited 
support from within their own agencies, from political appointees, or 
from external constituents as a factor that motivated them to do so. 
(See table 2.) For example, transportation planners in Mississippi told 
us that their agency is committed to being environmentally aware, and 
that this culture has encouraged them to consider ecosystem 
conservation in planning. Metropolitan planners in Albany, New York, 
noted that their corporate culture provides a strong foundation to 
consider ecosystem conservation as they develop transportation plans. 
Similarly, metropolitan planners in central Virginia said that the 
planning commission's staff are concerned about being good stewards and 
maintaining a balance between transportation and other concerns.

Table 2: Factors that Reportedly Encourage Consideration of Ecosystem 
Conservation in Transportation Planning:

Encouraging factor: Constituent support and support from transportation 
agency personnel; 
Number of planners reporting: 27.

Encouraging factor: More certain cost estimates/schedules for project 
implementation; 
Number of planners reporting: 18.

Encouraging factor: Fewer adverse impacts on ecological resources; 
Number of planners reporting: 7.

Encouraging factor: Improvement in the public's perception of the 
transportation agency; 
Number of planners reporting: 6.

Encouraging factor: Improved relations with resource agencies; 
Number of planners reporting: 5.

Encouraging factor: Other (each was mentioned only once); 
Number of planners reporting: 4.

Source: GAO analysis of interview responses.

Note: We asked planners to list the three most important factors. This 
table includes responses from planners in the 31 agencies that consider 
ecosystem conservation during transportation planning.

[End of table]

The views of elected officials and agency heads were another facet of 
constituent support. For example, the governor of New York has strongly 
encouraged planners there to improve their environmental performance, 
and the governor of New Mexico has initiated a new program that 
explores several environmental issues, according to planners in those 
states. This support from elected officials has influenced planners in 
these states to consider ecosystem conservation during transportation 
planning. Finally, planners in Delaware and Oregon emphasized the 
importance of their agency leaders' support for ecosystem conservation.

In addition, the general public's attitude toward ecosystem 
conservation motivated planners to consider ecosystem conservation 
during transportation planning. Planners in Oregon and New Mexico 
attributed their consideration of ecosystem conservation partly to the 
pro-environment culture in their states. They told us, for example, 
that citizens are concerned about wildlife protection and view the 
natural environment as a major asset to the state. Metropolitan 
planners in Albany, New York, told us that citizens are concerned about 
excessive land consumption which is one factor that encourages them to 
consider ecosystem conservation during transportation planning.

Transportation planners also listed encouraging factors that were 
similar to the positive effects that were discussed earlier in this 
report. For example, 18 planners said that they were encouraged to 
consider ecosystem conservation in transportation planning by 
expectations of more certain cost estimates and construction schedules. 
Nine of these planners also listed positive effects that centered on 
developing more accurate cost estimates and determining more 
predictable project delivery dates. Similarly, seven planners listed 
having fewer adverse effects on ecological resources as an encouraging 
factor, while five of these planners also listed this as a positive 
effect. Planners also listed improved relationships with the state 
resource agencies as an encouraging factor as well as a positive effect 
of considering ecosystem conservation in transportation planning.

Planners Identified Time and Resource Requirements and Other 
Discouraging Factors:

Although most of the planners we interviewed reported that considering 
ecosystem conservation in transportation planning was beneficial, doing 
so presented challenges. Chief among these challenges was the staff 
time and money required to consider ecosystem conservation in 
transportation planning, reported by 23 planners, including those in 
Arizona, New Hampshire, and Montachusett, Massachusetts, who do not 
consider ecosystem conservation in transportation planning. (See table 
3.) An Arizona planner said that state reductions in funding and 
staffing have discouraged the department from considering ecosystem 
conservation during transportation planning, adding that the planning 
department staff has been reduced by 75 percent since the mid-1990s. 
New Hampshire planners said they do not have sufficient funds to enter 
into long-range studies. Therefore, there is pressure to wait until 
NEPA, which requires, among other things, an assessment of the impact 
of proposed transportation projects on the natural and human 
environment.

Table 4: Factors that Reportedly Discourage Consideration of Ecosystem 
Conservation in Transportation Planning:

Discouraging factor: Time and monetary/staffing resources required; 
Number of planners reporting: 23.

Discouraging factor: Difficulty obtaining stakeholder involvement/
guidance; 
Number of planners reporting: 15.

Discouraging factor: Political/proponent pressure to move ahead/lack of 
political support; 
Number of planners reporting: 11.

Discouraging factor: Inappropriate to do so during long-range planning; 
Number of planners reporting: 9.

Discouraging factor: Negative public response/public expectations; 
Number of planners reporting: 6.

Discouraging factor: It is not required; 
Number of planners reporting: 2.

Discouraging factor: Other (each was mentioned only once); 
Number of planners reporting: 6.

Source: GAO analysis of interview responses.

Note: We asked planners to list the three most important factors. This 
table includes responses from planners in all 36 agencies that we 
contacted.

[End of table]

The staff time and money required was also the major discouraging 
factor for those planning agencies that do consider ecosystem 
conservation in transportation planning. For example, planners in 
Colorado and North Carolina told us that, while beneficial, it takes a 
significant amount of time and effort to develop, maintain, and provide 
access to the data required to consider ecosystem conservation during 
transportation planning. Additionally, some metropolitan area planners 
told us that small planning agencies are particularly hard-pressed, 
because of their small size, to consider ecosystem conservation. For 
example, a metropolitan planner in central Virginia noted that the 
limited funding his agency receives for long-range transportation 
planning precludes more focused activities to address environmental 
factors, even though the agency would like to do so. Similarly, 
metropolitan area planners in Athens, Georgia, told us their ability to 
conduct detailed ecological analyses during planning is very limited 
because they do not have enough staff.

Difficulties in obtaining involvement or guidance from stakeholders was 
the second most often cited discouraging factor, according to the 
planners we interviewed. This was the chief discouraging factor 
mentioned by a planner in Montachusett, Massachusetts, a metropolitan 
planning organization that does not consider ecosystem conservation 
before project developers prepare environmental impact assessments 
under NEPA. The planner stated that the planning organization lacks 
guidance from the state or federal agencies on the priority of 
ecosystem conservation. The planner noted that the planning 
organization addresses all federal requirements in transportation 
planning, as well as those issues the state emphasizes, but ecosystem 
consideration has not been one of them. Planners in Utah, a state that 
does consider ecosystem conservation in transportation planning, told 
us that resource agencies prefer to comment on projects that are better 
defined than is typically the case when they appear in transportation 
planning documents. On the other hand, a Utah resource agency official 
told us that his agency would like to be involved in these earlier 
planning phases, but the state department of transportation does not 
notify it early enough in planning.[Footnote 16]

In addition, some planners told us that they lacked guidance from 
stakeholders, namely state resource agencies, on how to consider 
ecosystem conservation in transportation planning. They noted that 
long-term or comprehensive plans for managing the state's ecological 
resources would help them make decisions about what resources to 
consider during planning; however, their state resource agencies had 
not completed such plans. A few of the state and federal resource 
agencies we interviewed noted, though, that some states are developing 
wildlife conservation plans as part of a new federal program or other 
habitat management plans that they believe will be useful to state 
departments of transportation.

Third, pressure from political leaders or project proponents to move 
forward in spite of ecological concerns, or because of competing 
priorities, also discouraged planners from considering ecosystem 
conservation in transportation planning. For example, planners in North 
Carolina told us that developers give little credence to environmental 
concerns. Economic development in Iowa takes precedence over ecosystem 
concerns, according to a planner there. A state resource agency 
official in Oregon echoed these sentiments, stating that, in some 
instances, regional transportation planners and the state department of 
transportation value improving economic development over conserving 
ecological resources.

A few other planners cited additional discouraging factors. Local 
expectations that a project will be built, regardless of ecosystem 
concerns, is a discouraging factor, according to a transportation 
planner in North Carolina. Also, planners in three jurisdictions noted 
that circumstances might change between early planning for a project 
and its implementation. This was the chief discouraging factor for 
Illinois, where planners do not consider ecosystem conservation before 
NEPA. Finally, planners in Great Falls City-County, Montana, a 
jurisdiction that does not consider ecosystem conservation in 
transportation planning, stated that their existing policy is to rely 
on NEPA to assess the ecosystem and other environmental impacts of 
proposed transportation projects.

Appendix I: Telephone Interview Questions for State and Metropolitan 
Area Planners:

Before each telephone interview with officials at state departments of 
transportation and metropolitan planning organizations, we provided 
participants with the following questions and encouraged them to review 
the questions and to invite others as appropriate to participate in the 
interview in order to provide as accurate and complete answers as 
possible. Question numbers preceded by "SLR" are those referring to the 
development of the long-range transportation plan. Questions preceded 
by "ST" are those referring to the development of the state 
transportation improvement program. Finally, questions preceded by 
"SPN" refer to a phase of project planning that immediately precedes 
NEPA, which we termed "pre-NEPA planning." Questions for metropolitan 
area planners were similarly numbered except that they began with the 
letter "M" to easily differentiate between the state and metropolitan 
planners' questions and responses.[Footnote 17]

Pre-NEPA Planning:

We would like to learn about how your state considers ecosystem 
conservation as it begins project development--after the project has 
been listed on the state transportation improvement program, but before 
the NEPA process begins. As previously discussed, we call this phase 
the "pre-NEPA" phase.

(Answer if applicable):

SPN1) How does your state consider ecosystem conservation during the 
pre-NEPA phase?

SPN2) What stakeholders, if any, are involved in helping you consider 
ecosystem conservation during the pre-NEPA phase (federal or state 
agencies, non-government organizations, other)?

SPN3) How are these stakeholders involved in helping you consider 
ecosystem conservation during the pre-NEPA phase?

SPN4) What type of ecosystem data, if any, do you include in the pre-
NEPA phase?

SPN5) Please provide any other ways, not discussed above, that your 
state considers ecosystem conservation in the pre-NEPA phase.

We would now like to discuss the effects of considering ecosystem 
conservation in the pre-NEPA phase.

SPN6) Please describe any anticipated or observed effects, positive or 
negative, that you can attribute to the consideration of ecosystem 
conservation in the pre-NEPA phase.

We would like to know about factors that encourage or discourage 
consideration of ecosystem conservation in the pre-NEPA phase.

SPN7) Please list the three factors that have been the most important 
in encouraging your state to consider ecosystem conservation during the 
pre-NEPA phase.

SPN8) Similarly, please list the three factors that have been the most 
important in discouraging your state to consider ecosystem conservation 
during the pre-NEPA phase.

Is there anything else that you would like to tell us about considering 
ecosystem conservation in transportation planning?

We would like to contact someone in the state resource agency 
(Department of Natural Resources, Department of Environmental 
Protection, etc.) that is most involved with your agency in considering 
ecosystem conservation during the transportation planning process. 
Please provide the name, official title, and contact information.

Appendix III: Scope and Methodology:

To obtain a basic understanding of how transportation planners consider 
ecosystem conservation in transportation planning and how federal 
agencies are involved, we discussed transportation laws, regulations, 
and planning procedures with officials in the following agencies:

* Federal Highway Administration in headquarters and Phoenix, Arizona; 
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in headquarters, Phoenix and Tucson, 
Arizona, and Denver, Colorado; and Army Corps of Engineers in 
headquarters, Baltimore, Maryland, and Phoenix, Arizona.

* State departments of transportation, resource agencies, and 
metropolitan planning organizations in Virginia, Massachusetts, 
Wisconsin, Mississippi, and Colorado; the metropolitan planning 
organizations for the Washington, D.C., area and Pima County, Arizona; 
and state departments of transportation and resource agencies in 
Florida and Maryland.

* The American Association of State Highway Transportation Officials, 
Association of Metropolitan Planning Organizations, The Nature 
Conservancy, International Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, 
and Defenders of Wildlife.

At each of these locations, we also obtained and reviewed 
transportation planning documents. We defined ecosystems as plants and 
animals and the habitats that support them. We defined planning as 
activities associated with developing the federally required long-range 
transportation plan, short-range transportation improvement program, 
and the nonfederally required project planning that some jurisdictions 
perform just prior to beginning the environmental review required by 
the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), as well as any 
activities, such as corridor studies, that are performed concurrently 
with, but independently of, federally mandated transportation planning 
activities. Because federal law already requires that states and local 
governments meet air and water quality standards, our inquiry did not 
include identifying whether state departments of transportation and 
metropolitan planning organizations were considering these issues in 
transportation planning.

To identify (1) how state and metropolitan area transportation planners 
consider ecosystem conservation and how federal agencies are involved, 
(2) the effects these planners have seen from this consideration, and 
(3) the factors that encourage or discourage them from doing so, we 
developed a set of questions to ask transportation planners selected 
through a nonprobability sample of 24 states and 12 metropolitan 
planning:

organizations. We divided the nation into eight geographic zones 
containing a roughly equal number of states to ensure that our sample 
was geographically and ecologically diverse. To ensure that our sample 
included states with a variety of population sizes, we used census data 
to divide states in each zone into three subgroups according to 
population--high, low, and medium. We then randomly selected 1 state 
from each of the 24 subgroups to obtain a 24-state sample, which 
included the following states:

* Alabama:

* Alaska:

* Arizona:

* Colorado:

* Delaware:

* Georgia:

* Idaho:

* Illinois:

* Indiana:

* Iowa:

* Louisiana:

* Massachusetts:

* Mississippi:

* Nebraska:

* Nevada:

* New Hampshire:

* New Mexico:

* New York:

* North Carolina:

* North Dakota:

* Oklahoma:

* Oregon:

* South Dakota:

* Utah:

To ensure ecosystem diversity among the 12 metropolitan planning 
organizations in our sample, we divided the nation into quadrants 
containing a roughly equal number of states. Then, to ensure that our 
sample would reflect the varying extent to which metropolitan planning 
organizations consider ecosystem conservation in transportation 
planning, we used the results from our 2002 survey of all metropolitan 
planning organizations. The survey asked how much consideration, if 
any, they give to the impact of transportation projects on 
environmentally sensitive lands, such as wetlands, when they develop 
their transportation plans.[Footnote 19] According to their answers, we 
divided the metropolitan planning organizations in each quadrant into 
three subgroups: (1) those that indicated little or no, or some 
consideration; (2) those that indicated moderate consideration; and (3) 
those that indicated great or very great consideration. We then 
randomly selected one metropolitan planning organization from each of 
the 12 subgroups, resulting in the following sample:

* Benton-Franklin Council of Governments, Washington;

* Butte County Association of Governments, California;

* Capital District Transportation Commission, New York;

* Central Virginia Metropolitan Planning Organization, Virginia;

* Flagstaff Metropolitan Planning Organization, Arizona;

* Great Falls City-County Planning, Montana;

* Greensboro Transportation Advisory Committee, North Carolina;

* Madison Athens-Clarke Oconee Regional Transportation Study, Georgia;

* Merrimack Valley Planning Commission, Massachusetts;

* Montachusett Regional Planning Commission, Massachusetts;

* Waco Metropolitan Planning Organization, Texas; and:

* Yellowstone County/Billings Metropolitan Planning Organization, 
Montana.

To gain an understanding of the breadth and depth of each sample 
state's and metropolitan planning organization's consideration of 
ecosystem conservation in transportation planning, we developed a 
variety of questions about how planners implement this consideration, 
whether and how they involve stakeholders, what types and sources of 
data they consider, what positive and negative effects they have 
observed or expect to observe, and what factors encourage and 
discourage them from these efforts. (See app. I for a complete listing 
of these questions.) Through telephone interviews, we asked planners to 
address these questions for each of three phases of transportation 
planning: (1) as they develop their long-range transportation plans, 
(2) as they develop their short-range transportation improvement 
programs, and (3) in the project planning stage that immediately 
precedes the environmental review under NEPA.[Footnote 20] Planners 
reported similar effects of considering ecosystem conservation in 
transportation, planning and similar encouraging and discouraging 
factors across these three phases. Therefore, we did not report answers 
to these questions by phase. Appendix II contains the questions that we 
asked planners who we interviewed in state departments of 
transportation and metropolitan planning organizations. We also 
reviewed the available long-range transportation plans of each state 
and metropolitan planning organization in our samples to determine 
whether these plans contained goals related to ecosystem conservation.

To obtain the perspectives of state resource agency officials, we asked 
officials at each department of transportation in our sample to 
identify the official at the state resource agency who was most 
involved with the department of transportation during 
planning.[Footnote 21] We conducted telephone interviews with resource 
agency officials in 22 of our 24 sample states, asking these officials 
how they participate in considering ecosystem conservation in 
transportation planning, whether they collect ecological data and make 
these data available to transportation planners, the effects that they 
can attribute to considering ecosystem conservation, and the factors 
that encourage or discourage their participation.[Footnote 22] See 
appendix II for a complete listing of the questions that we asked 
resource agency officials.

In analyzing our interview responses, we used content analysis and 
consensus agreement among four analysts to categorize similar 
responses, and grouped state and metropolitan planning organizations 
accordingly. To increase the reliability of our coding of responses, we 
used consensus agreement among the same four analysts. We did not 
verify the accuracy of the information that we obtained in our 
interviews or determine whether or how the consideration of ecosystem 
conservation that planners described affected transportation projects 
or ecosystems because it was not practical to do so. However, the 
variety of questions that we asked of transportation planners, combined 
with the perspectives of resource agency officials, mitigates the 
potential that our results portray more extensive consideration of 
ecosystem conservation in transportation planning than may actually 
exist. Although we requested planners' and resource agency officials' 
observations about the effects of considering ecosystem conservation in 
transportation planning, we did not evaluate the effectiveness of their 
efforts, or determine whether one agency's efforts were more effective 
than another's. The results of our work cannot be projected to all 
states and metropolitan planning organizations. In order to make 
reliable generalizations, we would have needed to randomly select a 
larger sample of states and metropolitan planning organizations than 
time allowed.

Appendix V: Comments from the Department of the Interior:

Note: We included these specific comments in this final report, where 
appropriate.

United States Department of the Interior:

OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY 
Washington, DC 20240:

APR 23 2004:

Mr. James Ratzenberger 
Assistant Director:
U.S. General Accounting Office 
441 G Street, N.W. 
Washington, D.C. 20548:

Dear Mr. Ratzenberger:

Thank you for providing the Department of the Interior the opportunity 
to review and comment on the draft U.S. General Accounting Office 
report entitled, "Highway Infrastructure: Many State and Regional 
Agencies Report Considering Ecosystem Conservation during Planning, " 
GAO-04-536, dated March 26, 2004. In general, we agree with the 
findings that pertain to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

The Department is pleased with the finding that most agencies found 
benefits to considering various aspects of ecosystem conservation in 
their planning efforts. We believe that benefits to transportation 
planning will continue to increase as agencies expand their efforts to 
consider ecosystem conservation. The Department is working 
cooperatively with other Departments under Executive Order 13274 to 
streamline the environmental review process and promote environmental 
stewardship for transportation projects. We believe through the 
cooperative efforts under this Executive Order, project costs and 
workload can be more effectively managed while fulfilling our 
stewardship responsibilities.

The enclosure provides specific comments from the Service. We look 
forward to receiving the final report.

Sincerely,

Signed by: 

[ILLEGIBLE NAME]

Assistant Secretary for Fish and Wildlife and Parks:

[12] A mitigation bank is a site where wetlands, other aquatic 
resources, or both are restored, created, enhanced, or, in exceptional 
circumstances, preserved expressly for the purpose of providing 
compensatory mitigation in advance of authorized impacts to similar 
resources.

[13] We asked transportation planners in each state in our sample to 
provide the name of the resource agency official that they most 
frequently contacted. Nevada planners did not provide a resource agency 
contact. We were unable to arrange an interview with the New York 
resource agency contact. 

[14] States are required to submit, or commit to develop, wildlife 
conservation plans by October 1, 2005, to be eligible for wildlife 
conservation grants under the State Wildlife Grant Program. According 
to U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service officials, all states have committed 
to develop these plans. 

[15] This section reflects the results of 50 interviews out of a 
possible 60 (24 state and 12 metropolitan planners, and 24 state 
resource agency officials). It does not include any views on ecosystem 
conservation that may have been expressed by the transportation 
planners and resource agency officials that we interviewed in the three 
states that do not consider ecosystem conservation, nor does it include 
the views of transportation planners in the two metropolitan planning 
organizations that do not consider ecosystem conservation in 
transportation planning. Finally, we did not interview resource agency 
officials in Nevada and New York for reasons previously stated.

[16] We did not attempt to reconcile the differences between the 
statements of Utah planners and resource agency officials.

[17] Questions asked of metropolitan area planners were identical 
except where noted.

[18] In the metropolitan planning organization interviews, we asked the 
same questions but about the transportation improvement program.

Incentives Could Help Promote Land Use That Protects Air and Water 
Quality, GAO-02-12 (Washington, D.C.: Oct. 31, 2001).

[20] We asked all planners the same questions. We did not provide the 
planners with sets of possible responses from which to choose.

[21] Because state resource agencies are organized in a variety of 
ways, independently identifying the appropriate resource agency contact 
in each of our 24 sample states was not practical. 

[22] We asked each resource agency official the same questions. We did 
not provide these officials with sets of possible responses from which 
to choose. Nevada did not provide a state resource agency contact, and 
the New York state resource agency contact did not respond to requests 
to be interviewed. Because Idaho Department of Transportation officials 
told us that their primary resource agency contact was with the Boise 
office of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, we interviewed an 
official at that agency, rather than a state resource agency official.
