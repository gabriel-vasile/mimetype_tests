Subject: Proposed rule
 
I strongly support your proposed rule discouraging selective disclosure of 
material corporate information. After all, equity trading based upon "insider 
information" is illegal. For the favored analyst or fund manager to obtain 
material corporate information selectively, before the general public, is 
tantamount to the same thing. The small guy seems to always wonder why the stock
price surged or crashed, only to find out later.
     
Respectfully,
