    A discouraging example of discrimination against a small investor 
occurred last week.  The stock of Electronic Data Systems suffered a great 
drop in price in a peculiar manner.  
     
    Trades were made in after-hours trading at a price considerably lower 
than the closing price.  The well known advisory service to which I subscribe 
gives a phone Hot Line update every business day at 4:30 PM EDT.  Later I 
read that EDS had in fact offered news indicating much lower sales and profit 
forecast.  
     
    There was no update on June 8th.  Not at the appointed time or later.  
There has been no mention by that advisory firm of the stock of EDS in print 
or by phone to this time.
     
    I called the advisory service and was told by the man who makes the Hot 
Line updates that the omission was his fault, that he'd been busy and 
forgotten.  He offered to and did connect me with the analyst who deals with 
EDS for the firm.  That man said he had not removed his recommendation or 
changed it.
     
    I did not record all that I experienced, heard, or read.  I hope that 
your group has been reviewing the action of EDS stock in the recent period.
     
    Sincerely yours,
