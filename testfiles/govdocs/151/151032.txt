Here is a very brief report on the scans of 17 Jun 1999.  Not much to
report on these cross scans (primarily in E-W direction).

* SLX 1735-269 has dropped again, this time from about 160 ct/s/5PCU
  to 55 ct/s.
* XTE J1710-281 is near about 15 ct/s.  This is discouraging, since we
  stare at it next week for two orbits.

We stare at 1710 on Monday and 1819 on Thursday, two orbits (=6500 s)
each.
