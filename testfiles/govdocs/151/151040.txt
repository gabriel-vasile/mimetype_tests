MIX OF SUN AND RAIN

For the week ending September 7, 2003, there were 5.8 days
available for field work across New England.  Topsoil
moisture was rated 1% very short, 17% short, 76% adequate,
6% surplus. Subsoil moisture was rated 0% very short, 21%
short, 77% adequate, 2% surplus.  Pasture condition was
rated as 4% very poor, 13% poor, 28% fair, 48% good, 7%
excellent.  A mix of sun and rain was generally beneficial
to New England crops last week, though some areas reported
too much rain and others reported too little. Cool, fall-
like temperatures continued throughout the week,
discouraging insect activity and disease.  Major farm
activities included: cutting haylage and making dry hay;
harvesting broadleaf and shade tobacco, potatoes, small
grains, apples, peaches, highbush blueberries and
vegetables; completing Maine wild blueberry harvest;
desiccating potato vines; spreading manure; irrigating;
mowing; pruning; cultivating; monitoring fields; preparing
harvest equipment; applying insecticides and fungicides;
performing general farm maintenance.

-- Field Crops Report --

Hay was harvested between showers last week; second cut
progress was on schedule with the five-year average at 90
percent complete, while progress of the third crop harvest
was slightly behind normal.  The recent cool, moist
weather slowed field corn development; harvest has yet to
begin, when normally ten percent of the crop would have
been harvested.  Potato harvest in Maine continued for
those harvesting early for direct shipping or processing.
Others readied equipment and killed vines in preparation
for harvest.  Southern New England growers proceeded with
potato harvest when weather allowed.  Blue mold and brown
spot continue to affect broadleaf tobacco crops. 
Broadleaf tobacco harvest was nearly complete in
Massachusetts by week's end.

-- Fruit, Vegetable, and Specialty Crops Report --

FRUIT: Apples, peaches and pears were harvested last week,
along with highbush blueberries and fall raspberries. 
Highbush blueberry harvest was completed in Maine and
continued to wind down in other states.  Maine growers
also finished wild blueberry harvest last week, with an
above average crop expected.  White cranberry harvest
began in Massachusetts; recent rain improved berry size
and cool nights have started to color the berries.

VEGETABLES: Growers harvested an array of vegetables,
including beans, beets, cabbage, cucumbers, greens,
onions, peas, peppers, pumpkins, radishes, squash,
tomatoes and zucchini last week.  Persistent rains and
damp conditions have promoted rotting in some areas. 
Sweet corn harvest progress remained on schedule last week
at 80 percent complete.  Sales of late season vegetables
and mums have begun at local markets.

-- Other Agricultural Comments and News --

CONNECTICUT - Ross Eddy (FSA), Hartford/Tolland: A rather
damp midweek with sun and dryer conditions over the
weekend pushed harvesting of vegetable crops back some
more. Broadleaf tobacco harvest resumed Friday. More
notices of loss on tobacco due to blue mold and brown spot
on broadleaf still in the field. Orders for sweet corn,
etc. dropped off significantly after Labor Day. Dairy
farmers advertising for truck drivers for corn harvest.
Dawn Pindell (FSA), Windham: A glorious weekend, chopping,
haying and apple picking. Sharing ideas while selling at
the farmers' markets. Field corn beginning to mature.
Peaches and most crops are still running late. Vegetables
doing well, apples a bit on the small side, but tasty.
Nancy Welsh/Karen Vozarik (FSA), New Haven: This week of
wet weather did in a lot of producers. Fields had standing
water in between plastic. Crops rotted and weeds were
uncontrollable. It is bad in this part of the state. Mums
are big and beautiful, late flowering but many buds.
Richard Meinert (Ext), CT Cooperative: Cool days and cold
nights are not helping to ripen field corn. Farmers are
still waiting for corn to dry down enough to harvest. 

MAINE - Marvin Hedstrom, Northern Aroostook: Potatoes and
small grains: Growers busy applying fungicides and
pesticides as necessary. Vine dessication continues but
growers reluctant to dessicate late maturing varieties of
potatoes as they would like to get more size of tubers.
Continue to ready equipment and storages for harvest. A
few potatoes being harvested for processor. It was a
difficult week to harvest grain due to high moisture in
the fields. Soil is actually getting somewhat dry. Pam
Hickey (Ext), Central Aroostook: Canola is being harvested
- about 10 percent of acreage. Oats and barley being
harvested. Harvesting of potatoes should be starting
within the next week. A few potatoes in the area have been
dug for direct shipment and processing. Steve London,
Southern Aroostook: Potatoes and small grains: Crops are
looking well. There are still a few aphids around. Albert
Dow (NRCS), Piscataquis: Farmers were killing potato tops.
Rains have kept all crops growing well. Rick Kersbergen
(Ext), Waldo: Beneficial rains last week helped to
alleviate the dry conditions in this area. Lots of hay
being cut and harvested with good weather predicted. Corn
silage harvest expected to begin this week with some corn
in the dent stage. Trudy Soucy (FSA), Knox/Lincoln:
Perfect weather for outdoor work continues. Thursday's
rain helped crops still in the ground. Weed control on
blueberry fields underway. Some winter squash never
developed because of poor pollination weather. Dr. David
Yarborough (Ext), Washington: Wild blueberries: Crop
harvest finished up the first week of September Downeast.
Since harvest went beyond Labor Day, a better than average
crop is expected. Parker Rand (FSA), Cumberland/York: The
nights are cooler and fall is in the air. Third crop hay
is very heavy, and the corn is getting close to harvest.
The apple harvest has begun and the pumpkins are showing
up at the farm stands. This will be a very busy month.
Gary Raymond (FSA), Franklin: Rain came at an excellent
time. There has been more hay harvested in this area than
the producers know what to do with. Laura Rand (FSA),
Oxford: The weather is perfect for hay harvest! Producers
have been busy gathering the hay crop, pumpkins, squash,
and other late vegetables. Potato producers are busy
killing vines and starting harvest. Apple producers are
reporting a good crop and have received no hail in the
upper part of Oxford County. Warm days and cool nights are
the norm. 

MASSACHUSETTS - Arthur Williams (FSA), Berkshire: A bit
rainy and dreary this week. Temperatures were a little
cooler and seasonal. Some silage harvested and hay cut
late in the week with promise of dry weather in the
forecast. Farmers' markets beginning to highlight fall
veggies and flowers, and the foliage is just starting. Kip
Graham (FSA), Worcester: The cooler weather has slowed
crops down a bit. Below normal temperatures this time of
year. Still cutting haylage and making hay. Apple picking
continues, peaches and pears are coming into harvest.
Irrigating, cultivating and monitoring fields continues.
Preparing and maintaining farm equipment. Frank Caruso
(Ext), Plymouth: Cranberries: First white berries
harvested, but the bulk of those berries will be harvested
next week. Good rainfall continues to aid in the sizing of
the berries. Size is very good so far. Fruitworm injury is
rampant. So far fruit rot is not a problem. Color coming
along with a few cool nights. John Devine (FSA), Franklin:
Fall harvest is in full swing. Clear and dry weather
finally allowed hay producers to start cutting hay this
weekend. The tobacco harvest has concluded and the crop is
drying quickly. In spite of the nice weather, silage corn
is still slow to ripen. This is not expected to start for
another two weeks. Potato digging is going along at an
even pace but hasn't hit high gear yet, the crop has sized
nicely. The same is true with the apple crop. Ted
Smiarowski, Jr. (FSA), Hampshire/Hampden: Cool
temperatures with a few rain showers have slowed crop
growth. These cooler temperatures have also reduced plant
diseases and insect pressure. An array of fall crops are
being harvested such as pumpkins, Indian corn, winter
squash, potatoes, apples and cabbage. A rye cover crop is
being applied to many of the fields already harvested.
Gary Guida, Worcester: Another busy week on the farm.
Retail sales for locally grown produce booming! Spraying
herbicides in fallow fields in anticipation for fall
plowing. Winter squash and pumpkins just starting to ripen
here. Harvesting second planting of summer squash, cukes,
zukes and pickling cukes. Mums selling real well. Corn
borer and fall army worm less than one percent in corn.
Big seller this weekend - silver queen. 

NEW HAMPSHIRE - Amy Ouellette (Ext), Belknap: It was a
very good week for field work. Farm stands are busy with
summer vegetable and mum sales. Started picking pumpkins
and gourds this week. Lots of powdery mildew on vine crops
and ear worms in the corn. Early apple harvest is underway
- looking good so far. Carl Majewski (Ext), Cheshire:
Producers are getting ready for corn chopping; some early
hybrids will be ready to harvest this week. Longer-season
hybrids still in milk stage. Third cutting haylage is
finishing up; scattered rain in the first part of the week
made for poor drying conditions. Regrowth on fields is
strong. Early apple harvest continues. Farm stands are
getting into late-season sweet corn and tomatoes. Steve
Turaj (Ext), Coos: Foggy mornings in lowland areas, along
river, feels like early fall. Scattered frosts burning
back squash, pumpkin leaves in northern part of county,
doesn't appear to have affected vines. Pumpkins coloring
up, showing up increasingly along with winter squashes at
stands and markets. Sweet corn, other summer veggies
abundant yet. Fall mums common sight now. Over an inch of
rain this week, field corn looking quite good, lots yet in
milk stage, hoping weather will hold. Second cut still
taken, close thing with midweek rains. Grass fields
growing well. Typical late season pests: powdery mildew,
large grasshoppers, etc. showing up. Blister beetles
spotted and being brought in for ID. Reports of bears in
corn, haven't run into any yet, lots of sightings this
year. Tom Buob (Ext), Grafton: Corn continues to mature.
Third cutting continues. Quality is good to excellent.
Steve Schmidt (FSA), Grafton: Last week brought anywhere
from an inch to two inches of rain mid-week. The later
part of the week was cooler and partly cloudy, making it
hard to dry hay. Corn generally looks good, some fields
are ready to harvest. Some harvesting of corn should start
by the 10th of September on the earlier plantings. Apple
harvest has begun, and size and quality look good. Some
orchardists thought volume might be down a little, but too
early to tell. George Hamilton (Ext), Hillsborough:
Vegetables: Harvesting an array of vegetables: beans,
beets, cole crops, cucumbers, greens, peas, potatoes,
radishes, summer squash, sweet corn, tomatoes, zucchini
and other vegetables. Mildew can be found on pumpkins and
winter squash, farmers need to cut and pick up pumpkins
and winter squash to help stop fruit from rotting. Very
good demand for produce at local farmers' markets and farm
stands. Fruit: Orchardists harvesting early season apple
varieties, peaches and raspberries. Orchardists busy
applying apple maggot sprays and getting ready for
harvest. Field Crops: Hay cutting continued at a rapid
pace during the week with the second cut being made.
Silage corn looking good, most field are in late milk
stage and some are starting to dent. David Seavey (Ext),
Merrimack: Excellent field corn crop although ears are a
little small. Farmers are preparing to cut early field
corn. Farmers are winding up cutting a second and third
dry hay harvest. Excellent growing weather for all crops.
Early apple harvest continues. Sunny weather needed to
improve apple color. Orchardists are mowing. Trees and
shrubs are moving out of wholesale nurseries. Garden
center sales are good. Sweet corn and other vegetables
harvested. Sprays applied for apple maggot. Fall bearing
raspberries harvested. As of Monday, September 8, the
growing degree days in Merrimack County are 1,815.
Geoffrey Njue (Ext), Strafford: The last week was nice
with a few days of rain showers and few days of sunshine.
A few farmers were making third cut. Vegetable growers
continue to harvest a wide array of vegetables, including
tomatoes, beans, cole crops, sweet corn, etc. Fruit
growers continue to harvest peaches and early varieties of
apples. Some apple growers are experiencing small and
seedless fruits. However, all in all the apple crop is
good. Harvesting of fall raspberries has also started.
Nurseries and greenhouses have started fall mum sales.
Sales of pumpkins have also started for most growers. 

VERMONT - John St. Onge/Kim Peterson (FSA), Lamoille:
Abundant corn crop has made for happy tourists making
their way through the county's two corn mazes. Corn
producers started preparing for corn silage harvest last
week. This week should see quite a few acres harvested.
Also should be a good week for haying even though foggy
mornings are the norm. Lynette Hamilton/Perley Sparrow
(FSA), Windham: Another week of inclement weather. This
week looks better for some drying of third cutting. Corn
needs the dryer weather to start that dry down process and
early planted corn is in the early dough stage but the
stalks are still too green. The winter squash and pumpkin
harvest looks about average this year. Its seems like
production will depend on variety. Apple harvest has not
reached its peak yet. Blueberry season is all over with
smaller than average production. Jeff Carter (Ext),
Addison: Harvesting of second cutting of dry hay and third
cut of chopped or wrapped haylage simultaneously. Good
yields and quality. Corn is not ready for harvest yet, 10%
with down and drying ears. Vigorous late season growth, so
many tall plants. Wheat headed and ripe. Pasture regrowth
good for grasses and clover. Some liquid manure spread on
harvested hay fields. Dry hay harvest very good this cut.
Dennis Kauppila (Ext), Caledonia: Quite a bit of haying
going on, once it dried up. Showers brought us an inch and
a half of rain, plus a severe thundershower, with some
damage just to the south. Turning into fall. Chris
Benedict (Ext), Chittenden: Cooler temperatures have
slowed starch conversion to sugars in maturing apples.
This has set back picking almost a week. Mid-week moisture
allowed for good sizing of those maturing apples. Heather
Darby (Ext), Franklin: Lots of great field work weather
last week! High quality third cut being harvested. Some
early season corn being chopped. The pastures could use
some rain.
