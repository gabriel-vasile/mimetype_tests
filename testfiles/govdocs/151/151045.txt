          PETITION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF COMMON CARRIER
      BUREAU ORDER REQUIRING THAT PETITIONERS FOR STUDY AREA
    WAIVERS OBTAIN STATE CERTIFICATION FOR UNDERLYING EXCHANGE
     TRANSFERS PRIOR TO FILING PETITIONS WITH THIS COMMISSION

     On July 21, 1995, Blooston, Mordkofsky, Jackson & Dickens (BMJD), a law firm which
represents various rural telephone companies, filed a Petition for Reconsideration of a Common
Carrier Bureau (Bureau) Order released June 21, 1995 (AAD 95-78).  In that Order, the Bureau
required that petitioners for study area waivers obtain state certification for underlying exchange
transfers prior to filing petitions with this Commission.  BMJD contends that this requirement would
prolong the completion of exchange sales causing hardship to employees, customers, buyers and
sellers, ultimately discouraging local exchange carriers from making investment in rural exchanges. 
BMJD also states that this requirement constitutes a rulemaking in violation of the Commission's
rules and Administrative Procedure Act notice and comment procedures.
     
     Parties may file comments on the petition no later than April 21, 1997.  Replies should be
filed by May 1, 1997.  Comments should reference file number AAD 95-78.  A copy of each
pleading should be sent to Matthew Vitale, FCC, Common Carrier Bureau, 2000 L Street, N.W.,
Room 257, Washington, DC 20554 and the International Transcription Service (ITS), 2100 M Street,
N.W., Suite 140, Washington, DC 20037, (202)857-3800.  Copies of all filings will be available for
public inspection and copying in the Accounting and Audits Division's Public Reference Room 2000
L Street, N.W., Room 812, Washington, DC.  Copies are also available from ITS.
