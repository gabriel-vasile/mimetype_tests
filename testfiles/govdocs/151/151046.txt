Subject: Not home yet....

Thursday night
Dear Friends and Family,

I have been waiting to write this hoping I could write "They're Home!".  But
it didn't happen.  All day Sara had been told they'd be going home today.
Discharge papers had been written up and Stan was on his way with Steven when
the Dr. in charge (a new Dr. who has been on the floor less than a week) came
in and said, "You can't go home tonight."  It was too late to contact Stan--He
was 1/2 way to S.F.

So Stan is there now and they are eating dinner and then he and Steven will go
back home---alone.  Stan has a 9:00 a.m. app't tomorrow.

Brian is still vomiting, but not as much.  His white blood count is still ok.
His red counts are down so he got a blood transfusion this afternoon.  He
doesn't feel great, but they figure he can do ok at home for a few days.

The delay tonight is very discouraging.  Now they say maybe tomorrow morning.
He must successfully take all his medications by mouth all night---there are
not many.  

Pray that Brian will make it home tomorrow and get to stay for the weekend.
Over a month in the hospital is just TOO long!  Pray that he is able to keep
down the medications tonight without vomiting.  

God bless you all.
Love,
Susan
