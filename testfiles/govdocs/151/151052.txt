following persons or entities have an interest in the outcome of

               STATEMENT REGARDING ORAL ARGUMENT
     The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)
respectfully requests that oral argument be granted in this case. 
The district court's award of attorney's fees and costs to the
Defendant-Respondent Asplundh Tree Expert Company (Asplundh) on
the ground that EEOC failed to adequately conciliate the matter
is inconsistent with the standards established by the United
States Supreme Court for an award of fees against a plaintiff in
an action brought under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of
1964, 42 U.S.C.  2000e et seq.  Given the substantial size of
the fees awarded here, the district court's ruling has the
potential to interfere significantly with EEOC's future conduct
of enforcement litigation, by discouraging EEOC from filing
litigation where there is any doubt concerning whether a court
may subsequently conclude, on the eve of trial, that EEOC's prior
efforts at conciliation were insufficient in a particular case. 
EEOC previously requested oral argument in its related appeal
from the district court's dismissal of this action, EEOC v.
Asplundh Tree Expert Co. (Asplundh I), No. 02-12386-E.  That
appeal has now been consolidated with this appeal pursuant to
this Court's order of August 30, 2002.  EEOC respectfully submits
that oral argument will assist this Court in a proper resolution
of the important issues arising in these consolidated appeals.

I.   THE DISTRICT COURT ERRED IN AWARDING ATTORNEY'S
     FEES TO ASPLUNDH BECAUSE EEOC SATISFIED TITLE
     VII'S CONCILIATION REQUIREMENTS AND EVEN ASSUMING,
     ARGUENDO, THAT CONCILIATION WAS INADEQUATE, THE
     PROPER REMEDY WOULD HAVE BEEN TO STAY THE LITIGATION
     TO PERMIT FURTHER CONCILIATION   . . . . . . . . . . .  16

II.  THE COURT BELOW ERRED IN AWARDING ATTORNEY'S FEES TO
     THE DEFENDANT BECAUSE ASPLUNDH WAS NOT A PREVAILING

    On Appeal from the United States District Court for the 
       Northern District of Florida, Gainesville Division
                                                           

           BRIEF OF THE EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY
               COMMISSION AS PLAINTIFF-APPELLANT
     ______________________________________________________

                   STATEMENT OF JURISDICTION

     The district court had jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.
 1331 & 1345 and 42 U.S.C.  2000e-5(f)(1) & (3).  The
district court's order and judgment entered on June 12, 2002, R.
99, 100, constitute a final decision which this Court has
jurisdiction to review pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  1291.  The Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC" or "Commission") filed
a timely notice of appeal on June 28, 2002.  R. 102.
                      STATEMENT OF ISSUES
1.  Whether the district court erred in awarding attorney's fees
against EEOC because EEOC's actions satisfied the conciliation
requirements of Title VII and even assuming, arguendo, that EEOC
ended conciliation prematurely, the appropriate remedy would have
been to stay the matter for further conciliation and an award of
fees would be improper in connection with such a stay.
2.  Whether the award of attorney's fees against EEOC was
improper under 42 U.S.C.  2000e-5(k) because Asplundh is not a
"prevailing party" under that provision and EEOC's claims were
not "frivolous, unreasonable or without foundation." 
3.  Whether the district court abused its discretion in awarding
attorney's fees to Asplundh because EEOC reasonably believed that
it had adequately conciliated this matter before filing suit and
the district court's finding that EEOC failed to satisfy Title
VII's conciliation requirement was based, in critical part, on a
clearly erroneous view of the facts and potential relief.

                     STATEMENT OF THE CASE
1.  Nature of the Case and Course of Proceedings
     This is an appeal from the district court's June 12, 2002,
award of attorney's fees to Defendant-Appellee Asplundh Tree
Expert Company, R. 99, 100, following the district court's
February 20, 2002, decision to dismiss the Commission's cause of
action based on the court's finding that EEOC did not satisfy the
conciliation requirement of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of
1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C.  2000e et seq. (Title VII).  R. 90,
91.  On May 12, 1999, EEOC filed a complaint against Asplundh
alleging that former Asplundh employee Robert B. Lewis was
subjected to harassment at the workplace because of his race
(African-American) and was subjected to retaliation, in violation
of Title VII, when Asplundh terminated him after he complained of
the harassment.  R. 1 (EEOC's Complaint).  EEOC's complaint
alleged that Lewis filed a charge with the Commission more than
30 days prior to institution of this lawsuit and that "[a]ll
conditions precedent to the institution of the lawsuit have been
fulfilled."  Id. at 2-3.  
     In its Answer, Asplundh admitted that Lewis had filed a
charge with the EEOC at least 30 days before EEOC instituted
suit, but denied the Commission's remaining allegations
pertaining to the Commission's satisfaction of the conditions
precedent to suit.  R. 5 (Asplundh's Answer) at 2.  The
Commission moved for partial summary judgment on the issue of
conciliation, R. 67, and Asplundh opposed the motion.  R. 77, 78.
     On February 20, 2002, the district court held that the
Commission did not satisfy the conciliation requirements of Title
VII and dismissed EEOC's lawsuit, R. 90, 91, and the Commission
appealed that decision.  R. 93.  In its February 20, 2002,
decision, the district court also indicated that Asplundh was
entitled to its costs, expenses and attorney's fees in defending
the action, and reserved jurisdiction to enter the same.  R. 90
at 11-12; R. 91.  Asplundh thereafter moved for attorney's fees
and costs in the amount of $235,308.71.  R. 92.  On June 12,
2002, the district court sustained the Commission's objection to
costs related to the court-ordered mediation and awarded fees and
costs to Asplundh in the reduced amount of $231,265.82.  R. 99,
100.  This appeal followed.  R. 102. 
2.  Statement of Facts - Underlying Action
     On August 26, 1996, Robert B. Lewis filed a Charge of
Discrimination against Asplundh alleging that Asplundh subjected
him to racial harassment, paid Black employees lower wages than
White employees and denied Black employees pay increases, and
discharged him in retaliation for complaining about race
discrimination.  RE42.  Asplundh had hired Lewis to perform work
in connection with a three-year contract between Asplundh and the
Gainesville Regional Utilities ("GRU") to install underground
cable.  The alleged harasser was a GRU electric utility inspector
who inspected the site daily to ensure Asplundh's contractual
compliance.  Among other forms of racial harassment, Lewis claims
that on one occasion two of Lewis's co-workers witnessed the
alleged harasser place a noose around Lewis's neck, point to a
nearby tree with "branches that resembled 'monkeys,'" and "t[ell]
Lewis that he would hang him up there with the 'rest of your
family.'"  R. 90 at 3-4.
     The Commission investigated the charge, conducted a pre-
determination interview with Asplundh on March 4, 1999, and
issued a Letter of Determination ("LOD") on March 31, 1999,
finding cause on Lewis's charges of racial harassment and
retaliation, but not on the wage issue.  The LOD invited the
parties to engage in "informal methods of conciliation," and
enclosed EEOC Form 153 ("Invitation to Participate in Settlement
Discussions") for the parties to fill out and return indicating
their interest in conciliation.  Lewis returned the form
indicating his willingness to engage in settlement discussions;
Asplundh did not return the form.  
     On April 7, 1999, EEOC sent Asplundh's General Counsel a
proposed Conciliation Agreement for his "review and
consideration," with a cover letter asking Asplundh to respond by
April 23, 1999.  The EEOC's letter advised Asplundh that 
     an executed Agreement, a specific counter proposal, or
     a decision to enter into no agreement must be submitted
     [to the attention of EEOC Investigator Debora West] no
     later than the close of business on April 23, 1999.
  
Asplundh did not respond in any way to the Commission's proposed
Conciliation Agreement by the designated date.  Almost a week
later, on April 29, 1999, the Commission sent the defendant a
letter stating that efforts to conciliate were unsuccessful based
on Asplundh's failure to return the Form 153 or respond to the
April 7th conciliation proposal by the designated date. 
     That same day, EEOC investigator Debora D. West received a
letter from Peter L. Sampo dated April 28, 2002.  Sampo
identified himself as Defendant's newly retained outside counsel
and said that he wanted to discuss the case with West so he could
"attempt to understand the Commission's basis for its
determination" and "provide informed advice" to Asplundh on the
issue.  The letter further asked West to "extend the time for
responding to the proposed Conciliation Agreement" until Sampo
had an opportunity to review the matter and discuss the issues
with West.  The letter made no attempt to explain why it took
Asplundh approximately one month to contact the Commission after
the agency first extended an invitation to the parties to
conciliate.
     Investigator West thereafter attempted, without success, to
reach Sampo by telephone.  As indicated by West's telephone and
correspondence log, which Asplundh appended as an exhibit to its
response to the Commission's motion, West made the first call to
Sampo the same day she received his letter.  A few days later,
Sampo returned her call and left a telephone message for West. 
West thereafter returned Sampo's telephone call and left him a
voice message advising him that "the case is out of my hands" and
that any further communications about the status of the case
should be directed to the Regional Attorney.  Sampo never
contacted the Regional Attorney after West left this message. 
     EEOC filed suit on May 12, 1999, alleging that Asplundh
violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Title I of
the Civil Rights Act of 1991 by subjecting Robert Lewis to racial
harassment and retaliatory discharge.  In its Answer, Asplundh
admitted that Lewis had filed a charge with the EEOC at least 30
days before suit was filed, but denied that the Commission met
the other conditions precedent to suit.  Discovery proceeded, and
a trial date was set.  On February 6, 2001, the parties engaged
in a day-long mediation session, see R. 92, Ex. 4, but were not
able to resolve the matter.      
     The Commission moved for partial summary judgment, asking
the district court to rule that the Commission had satisfied
Title VII's conciliation requirement.  R. 67.  Asplundh opposed
the motion, arguing that the Commission 1) did not adequately
explain the basis for its determination, 2) denied Asplundh an
adequate opportunity to make a counter-offer to the Commission's
conciliation proposal, and 3) never responded to Asplundh's
request for more information and for an extension of time.  
R. 77.  Asplundh asked the court to dismiss the litigation on
this basis.  
3.  Decision Below - Underlying Action
     On February 20, 2002, the district court held that EEOC had
failed to satisfy the conciliation requirement of Title VII.  
R. 90.  The court recognized that in similar circumstances,
courts have stayed litigation to permit the parties to engage in
further conciliation.  The court concluded that in this case,
however, EEOC did not act in good faith.  R. 90 at 10-11. 
Therefore, the court dismissed the action and indicated that
Asplundh is entitled to its costs, expenses and attorney's fees
in defending the action.  R. 90 at 11-12, R. 91.
     In concluding that EEOC did not conciliate this case
adequately, the court stated that Sampo forwarded a letter to
Investigator West on April 28, 1999, and that the Commission
mailed the notice stating that conciliation was unsuccessful the
next day.  R. 90 at 5-6, 9-10.  The court considered that the
Sampo letter "[c]learly . . . establishe[d] an intent on behalf
of the Defendant to resolve the matter outside of the courtroom." 
Id. at 10.  Before this Court, Asplundh now concedes that EEOC
responded to Sampo's letter.  See discussion in EEOC's Reply
Brief in EEOC v. Asplundh I, No. 02-12386-E, at 3-6.  In ruling
against the Commission on February 20, 2002, however, the
district court accepted Asplundh's repeated, erroneous
representations, based on the sworn affidavit of Peter Sampo,
that EEOC never responded to Sampo's letter or even acknowledged
having received it.  R. 90 at 6; see EEOC's Reply Brief in EEOC
v. Asplundh I, No. 02-12386-E, at 4-5 and n.2.  Based on this
clearly erroneous view of the facts, the lower court concluded
that EEOC "arbitrarily created a deadline and was particularly
inflexible in enforcing [it]."  Id. at 10.  
     As noted in EEOC's opening brief in EEOC v. Asplundh I, the
district court was also influenced by its perception that Lewis
would be entitled only to limited damages, even if the Commission
prevailed in this case.  The court stated: 
     In addition to the foregoing, and what makes this
     particular case so egregious and the need to negotiate
     before filing suit so essential, the employee, Lewis,
     even assuming that the defendant retaliated by firing
     him, would have been out of a job in 4 months, as well
     as all other Asplundh employees on the Gainesville
     project, because at that time the GRU contract would
     have expired, and did expire, by its own terms. 

Id. at 10 [emphasis omitted].  Based on all these considerations,
the court held that EEOC "act[ed] in a grossly arbitrary manner
and engage[d] in unreasonable conduct in failing to fulfill its
statutory requirement to conciliate the matter."  Ibid.
     Significantly, the district court made no findings on the
merits of EEOC's claims of racial harassment and retaliation. 
Although the district court had before it Asplundh's motion for
summary judgment, R. 65, 71, EEOC's response, R. 74, 75, 82, and
Asplundh's reply, R. 88, 89, the district court expressly
declined to address the motion, R. 90 at 12, R. 91, and did not
address the merits of EEOC's claims in conjunction with its
discussion of conciliation.
4.  Statement of Facts - Application for Fees and Costs
     In response to the district court's statement that Asplundh
was entitled to attorney's fees and costs, Asplundh filed a
Statement of Costs, Expenses and Attorneys' Fees seeking fees and
costs totaling $235,308.17.  R. 92.  EEOC, reserving its right to
challenge the propriety of fees and costs in their entirety on
appeal, objected specifically to Asplundh's application for costs
incurred to attend the court-ordered mediation on February 6,
2001.  R. 95 at 2-3.  
5.  Decision Below - Fees and Costs
     On June 12, 2002, the district court issued its decision
awarding attorney's fees and costs to Asplundh.  The district
court sustained EEOC's objection to the mediation-related costs
and then awarded attorney fees of $207.666.50 and costs in the
amount of $23,599.32, for a total of $231,265.82.  R. 99, 100. 
The district court did not issue any separate findings or legal
conclusions to support the award of fees and costs, apart from
the February 20, 2002, order dismissing the Commission's action
and stating that Asplundh was entitled to fees and costs.  R. 90. 
In its June 12, 2002, order, the district court, again, made no
findings concerning the merits of EEOC's claims.  See R. 99.
                       STANDARD OF REVIEW
     This case raises the question whether, as a matter of law, a
district court may award attorney's fees and costs to a Title VII
defendant when dismissal of EEOC's lawsuit was based solely on
the district court's conclusion that EEOC failed to conciliate
the claims fully before filing suit, where the district court
made no findings with respect to the merits of the EEOC's
underlying claims.  This Court reviews de novo the legal basis
for a district court's decision to award attorney's fees to a
defendant in an employment discrimination case.  Turlington v.
Atlanta Gas Light Co., 135 F.3d 1428, 1437 (11th Cir. 1998); see
also Marquart v. Lodge 837, Int'l Ass'n of Machinists, 26 F.3d
842, 844-45 (8th Cir. 1994).  Where a particular case falls
within the appropriate legal standards for an award of attorney's
fees, this Court reviews the district court's award of fees under
an abuse of discretion standard.  EEOC v. Reichhold Chemicals,
Inc., 988 F.2d 1564, 1569 (11th Cir. 1993); see also EEOC v.
Bruno's Restaurant, 13 F.3d 285, 287 (9th Cir. 1993)(court of
appeals reviews district court's award of attorney's fees for
abuse of discretion, but reviews de novo correctness of legal
standards applied).

                      SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT
     The district court's award of fees and costs to Asplundh is
improper in this instance for several reasons.  First, as
explained in the Commission's opening and reply briefs in EEOC v.
Asplundh I, No. 02-12386-E, the Commission conciliated this case
adequately under the standards established by this Court in EEOC
v. Klingler Electric Co., 636 F.2d 104 (5th Cir. Feb. 1981).  In
concluding otherwise, the district court misapplied the Klingler
standard and relied on Asplundh's misrepresentation of the facts. 
Since EEOC's conciliation efforts were adequate, the district
court had no basis to award attorney's fees against the EEOC. 
Even assuming, arguendo, that this Court concludes the Commission
ended conciliation prematurely, dismissal was improper because it
is too harsh a remedy under these circumstances.  The appropriate
remedy would have been to stay the litigation so the parties
could conciliate the matter further, and an award of attorney's
fees would be improper under such circumstances.  
     Second, the district court's award of attorney's fees
against the Commission cannot be sustained under 42 U.S.C. 
2000e-5(k) because the district court never reached the merits of
EEOC's underlying Title VII claims of racial harassment and
retaliation when it determined that EEOC did not adequately
conciliate this case before filing suit.  Without a determination
in its favor on the merits, Asplundh is not a "prevailing party"
and, therefore, fees cannot be awarded to Asplundh under Title
VII's fee-shifting provision.  
     In addition, this case does not meet the stringent standards
established under Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, 434 U.S.
412 (1978), for an award of fees to a Title VII defendant.  Under
Christiansburg, fees are properly awarded to a Title VII
defendant only where the district court finds the plaintiff's
claims "frivolous, unreasonable or without foundation."  The
district court made no such finding here with respect to EEOC's
claims of racial harassment and retaliation, nor is there any
basis for such a finding.  Even if the Christiansburg standards
are applied to the Commission's conciliation efforts, as opposed
to the merits of EEOC's lawsuit, the evidence establishes that
the Commission had a reasonable basis to believe the steps it
took to conciliate this matter before filing suit satisfied the
conciliation requirements of Title VII.  Thus, wholly apart from
the fact that Asplundh is not a "prevailing party" within the
meaning of  2000e-5(k), Christiansburg's strict standards for an
award of fees to a Title VII defendant are not met here.  
     Finally, the district court's dismissal and, presumably, its
award of attorney's fees was premised on the district court's
erroneous view of the facts surrounding the conciliation of this
case and the nature of EEOC's claims.  The district court's
conclusion that EEOC did not conciliate in good faith relied, in
critical part, on the lower court's beliefs that EEOC ignored
Asplundh's response to the Commission's conciliation proposal and
that the case involved only minimal potential monetary relief
(approximately four months of backpay).  As explained in EEOC's
opening and reply briefs in EEOC v. Asplundh I, No. 02-12386-E,
both of these beliefs are unfounded.  The district court's belief
that EEOC never responded to, or even acknowledged having
received, Asplundh's belated response to EEOC's conciliation
proposal was based on Asplundh's repeated assertions to that
effect in opposition to the Commission's motion for partial
summary judgment.  Asplundh now concedes that EEOC responded to
the Sampo letter by attempting to reach Sampo by telephone.  The
district court also improperly relied on the potential monetary
relief in this case as a factor in assessing whether conciliation
was adequate, and erred in its assessment of the potential relief
where EEOC alleges racial harassment based on an incident
involving a noose.  Thus, there is no foundation for the critical
underpinnings of the district court's conclusion that EEOC did
not conciliate this case in good faith.


                            ARGUMENT
I.   THE DISTRICT COURT ERRED IN AWARDING ATTORNEY'S FEES TO
     ASPLUNDH BECAUSE EEOC SATISFIED TITLE VII'S
     CONCILIATION REQUIREMENTS AND EVEN ASSUMING, ARGUENDO,
     THAT CONCILIATION WAS INADEQUATE, THE PROPER REMEDY
     WOULD HAVE BEEN TO STAY THE LITIGATION TO PERMIT
     FURTHER CONCILIATION.

     The Commission relies on and expressly incorporates herein
its opening and reply briefs in EEOC v. Asplundh I, No. 02-12386-
E, at pp 14-31 (Opening Brief) and 3-23 (Reply Brief), in support
of its position that the district court erred in holding that the
Commission failed to satisfy the conciliation requirements of
Title VII in this case.  Since the Commission's conciliation
efforts were adequate here, there is no basis for the district
court's dismissal of EEOC's lawsuit against Asplundh and,
likewise, no basis for the district court's award of attorney's
fees and costs against the Commission.
     The Commission similarly relies on and expressly
incorporates herein its opening and reply briefs in EEOC v.
Asplundh I, No. 02-12386-E, at pp 31-40 (Opening Brief) and 23-29
(Reply Brief), in support of its position that the district court
erred in dismissing this case, even assuming, arguendo, that the
Commission's conciliation efforts were insufficient.  As EEOC
explained in its opening and reply briefs in Asplundh I, EEOC
commenced conciliation with respect to each of the claims that
formed the basis of this litigation.  EEOC then waited an
appropriate period of time before concluding that Asplundh's non-
response to both EEOC's general invitation to conciliate (in the
Letter of Determination) and EEOC's specific conciliation
proposal indicated the company's lack of interest.  EEOC
reasonably concluded that Sampo's letter, arriving after
conciliation had ended, did not provide a basis for re-opening
conciliation, and telephoned Sampo instead.  Even if this Court
disagrees and concludes that EEOC should have re-opened
conciliation upon receipt of the Sampo letter, the proper remedy,
under such circumstances, would be to stay the litigation
pursuant to 42 U.S.C.  2000e-5(f)(1) to allow the parties to
engage in further conciliation.  Clearly, an award of attorney's
fees would be inappropriate in connection with such a stay.
II.  THE COURT BELOW ERRED IN AWARDING ATTORNEY'S FEES TO
     THE DEFENDANT BECAUSE ASPLUNDH WAS NOT A PREVAILING
     PARTY ON THE MERITS, THE COMMISSION'S CLAIMS WERE NOT
     FRIVOLOUS OR UNREASONABLE, AND THE COMMISSION DID NOT
     ACT IN BAD FAITH.   

     The district court did not specify, in either its February
20, 2002, or June 12, 2002, decisions, the statutory basis or
factual foundation for awarding attorney's fees to Asplundh.  The
Commission submits that the award of attorney's fees in this case
lacks any proper statutory basis and is not factually warranted
under these circumstances.
A.   Asplundh is not Entitled to An Award of Attorney's Fees and
     Expert Costs Under Title VII.

     It is well-established that "parties are ordinarily required
to bear their own attorney's fees [and] the prevailing party is
not entitled to collect from the loser" absent explicit statutory
authority.  Buckhannon Bd. & Care Home, Inc. v. W. Va. Dep't of
Health & Human Resources, 532 U.S. 598, 602 (2001) (citations
omitted).  Such statutory authorization does exist in section
706(k) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 
2000e-5(k).  That provision, however, does not warrant an award
of fees to Asplundh in this instance.   
     Section 706(k) provides, in pertinent part:  "In any action
or proceeding under this subchapter the court, in its discretion,
may allow the prevailing party . . . a reasonable attorney's fee
. . . ."  Although a prevailing plaintiff in a Title VII action
is generally entitled to an award of fees as a matter of course,
Christiansburg Garment Co.v. EEOC, 434 U.S. 412, 416-17 (1978),
a more stringent standard applies with respect to an award of
fees to a prevailing defendant.  EEOC v. Reichhold Chemicals,
Inc., 988 F.2d 1564, 1568 (11th Cir. 1993); see also Walker v.
NationsBank of Florida, 53 F.3d 1548, 1558 (11th Cir. 1995).  In
construing section 706(k) in the context of reviewing a district
court's refusal to award attorney's fees against the EEOC, the
Supreme Court held that "a plaintiff should not be assessed his
opponent's attorney's fees unless a court finds that [the
plaintiff's] claim was frivolous, unreasonable, or groundless, or
that the plaintiff continued to litigate after it clearly became
so."  Christiansburg Garment Co., 434 U.S. at 422.  Applying this
standard, the Court concluded that the district court properly
declined to award fees against the EEOC.  
     The Supreme Court has reminded us that the use of a more
stringent standard for determining whether to award attorney's
fees to a prevailing defendant furthers important congressional
goals.  The presumptive award of attorney's fees to a prevailing
plaintiff is consistent with the fact that Congress chose Title
VII plaintiffs as the means to vindicate a public policy "that
Congress considered of the highest priority" (namely, enforcement
of the provisions of Title VII).  Id. at 418-19.  Imposing a more
stringent standard on an award of attorney's fees to a prevailing
defendant, on the other hand, is justified by the fact that "a
fee award to a plaintiff is assessed against a violator of
federal law" and serves a deterrent effect on future violations,
"whereas a fee award to a defendant is determined against a
merely improvident litigant."  Reichhold Chemicals, 988 F.2d at
1568 (citing Christiansburg, 434 U.S. at 418).  The standard
articulated by the Court in Christiansburg thus serves to
discourage plaintiffs from filing claims that appear, at the
outset, to have little chance of success, without "discourag[ing
plaintiffs from filing] all but the most airtight claims."  434
U.S. at 422.  
     Recognizing that the course of litigation is rarely
predictable, the Court cautioned district courts to resist "the
understandable temptation to engage in post hoc reasoning by
concluding that, because a plaintiff did not ultimately prevail,
his action must have been unreasonable or without foundation." 
Id. at 421-22; Walker v. NationsBank, 53 F.3d at 1558.  The Court
noted that even where the law or facts appear questionable at the
outset, a plaintiff may have an entirely reasonable ground for
bringing suit.  Christiansburg, 434 U.S. at 421-22; Reichhold
Chemicals, 988 F.2d at 1568-69.
     There are two separate reasons why Asplundh is not entitled
to an award of attorney's fees in this instance.  First, Asplundh
is not a "prevailing party" within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. 
2000e-5(k).  Second, even apart from this defect, the
circumstances below do not satisfy the stringent Christiansburg
standards for an award of fees to a Title VII defendant.  Each of
these reasons is discussed in turn.
     1.   Asplundh Is Not a Prevailing Party Within the Meaning 
          of Section 706(k). 

     An award of fees under 42 U.S.C.  2000e-5(k) is reserved
for a "prevailing" party.  A prevailing party, for purposes of
this section, is a party that prevailed on some aspect of the
merits of the case.  See Hanrahan v. Hampton, 446 U.S. 754, 756-
58 & n. 4 (1980); Marquart v. Lodge 837, Int'l Ass'n of
Machinists, 26 F.3d 842, 852 (8th Cir. 1994).  As the Eighth
Circuit noted in Marquart, proof that a plaintiff's claims are
frivolous, unreasonable or groundless "is not possible without a
judicial determination of the plaintiff's case on the merits." 
Ibid.  That determination never happened here.  The court below
never found that the Commission's claims of racial harassment and
retaliation lacked merit.  Indeed, the district court expressly
refrained from addressing Asplundh's then-pending motion for
summary judgment, see R. 90 at 1, 12; R. 91, and made no findings
concerning the merits of EEOC's underlying claims of
discrimination and retaliatory discharge in conjunction with its
dismissal of EEOC's lawsuit in response to the Commission's
motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of conciliation. 
Thus, Asplundh is not entitled to an award of fees under section
706(k) because it was not a "prevailing party" within the meaning
of that section. 
     There do not appear to be any reported decisions addressing
this issue in the context of a finding that EEOC did not
adequately conciliate a case before filing suit.  A number of
courts, however, have considered whether a defendant is a
"prevailing party" for purposes of a fee award when a lawsuit is
resolved on some procedural ground, such as on a plaintiff's
motion for voluntary dismissal or a court's determination that it
lacks jurisdiction.  These courts have concluded that the
defendant, in those instances, is not entitled to an award of
attorney's fees because there was no determination on the merits.
     In Chacon v. Ezekiel, 957 F. Supp. 1265 (S.D. Fla. 1997),
for instance, the court denied the defendants' application for
attorney's fees after the court granted the plaintiff's motion
for voluntary dismissal.  The defendants had argued that the
plaintiff's action had been brought "without foundation" based on
indications that plaintiff's discrimination charges had been
untimely filed with EEOC and the local agency.  Relying on the
Eighth Circuit's decision in Marquart, the court reasoned that
the defendants could not be deemed to be a prevailing party under
section 706(k) because "[t]he court did not adjudicate the case
on the merits prior to Plaintiff's electing to dismiss her
claims."  Id. at 1267.  The court further stated that "[s]ince
Defendants are not prevailing parties it is immaterial whether
Plaintiff's suit was frivolous, unreasonable, or without
foundation."  Ibid.
    Similarly, in DeShiro v. Branch, 183 F.R.D. 281 (M.D. Fla.
1998), the district court denied an award of fees to the
defendant after the court dismissed the plaintiffs' Title VII
claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction (inability to
establish that the defendant employed the requisite number of
employees to be a covered employer under Title VII), id. at 285-
86, and allowed plaintiffs to take a voluntary dismissal on their
other, state law claims.  Id. at 283.  The district court noted
that it was necessary to consider, as a threshold matter, whether
the defendant qualified as a prevailing party, id. at 285, and
concluded that it did not.  Id. at 286.  Relying on Marquart and
a number of other decisions from other jurisdictions, id. at 285-
86, the court reasoned that regardless of whether the disposition
of a plaintiff's claim is under a voluntary dismissal or a
dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, "the defendant
cannot then be said to have 'prevailed' if any of the claims that
are being defended have met that fate."  Ibid.    
     If a defendant is not entitled to attorney's fees where a
Title VII suit was dismissed for lack of subject matter
jurisdiction, as was the case in DeShiro, then it should be even
more clear that a defendant is not entitled to recover attorney's
fees in a case, such as this, where the alleged deficiency is not
even one of jurisdiction but rather involves a filing
prerequisite which can be cured by a stay of proceedings under 42
U.S.C.  2000e-5(f)(1).
     2.   The District Court's Findings Do Not Meet the
          Christiansburg Standard for an Award of Fees to a
          Prevailing Title VII Defendant. 

     Even apart from the fact that Asplundh was not a "prevailing
party" here within the meaning of section 706(k), the district
court's findings do not meet the standard under Christiansburg
for an award of attorney's fees to a defendant.  Attorney's fees
are not awarded to a prevailing Title VII defendant as a matter
of course, but are awarded "only sparingly," EEOC v. L.B. Foster,
123 F.3d 746, 751 (3d Cir. 1997)(citation omitted), and only upon
a finding that the plaintiff's claims were frivolous, groundless
or without foundation.  Christiansburg, 434 U.S. at 421-22;
Walker v. NationsBank, 53 F.3d at 1558.  This Court has said that
"[i]n determining whether a suit is frivolous, 'a district court
must focus on the question [of] whether the case is so lacking in
arguable merit as to be groundless or without foundation rather
than whether the claim was ultimately successful.'"  Sullivan v.
School Bd. of Pinellas County, 773 F.2d 1182, 1189 (11th Cir.
1985)(quoting Jones v. Texas Tech Univ., 656 F.2d 1137, 1145 (5th
Cir. Unit A Sept. 1981); see also Walker v. NationsBank, 53 F.3d
at 1558 ("[I]n determining whether a prevailing defendant is
entitled to attorney's fees under Title VII, the district court
must focus on the question of whether the case is seriously
lacking in arguable merit.")(citing Sullivan, supra).  Even civil
rights claims that are dismissed for failure to state a claim are
not automatically deemed frivolous.  See, e.g., Ferroni v.
Teamsters, Chauffeurs & Warehousemen Local No. 222, 297 F.3d
1146, 1153 (10th Cir. 2002)(citing Jane L. v. Bangerter, 61 F.3d
1505, 1513 (10th Cir. 1995).  As this Court noted in Sullivan,
where findings of "frivolity" have been sustained on appeal, the
plaintiffs typically did not introduce any evidence to support
their claims.  773 F.2d at 1189; see also EEOC v. L.B. Foster,
123 F.3d at 751.  Where a plaintiff, on the other hand,
presents evidence that arguably supports its claim, a finding of
"frivolity" will not be warranted even if the factfinder
ultimately does not believe plaintiff's evidence, as long as the
district court does not find the plaintiff's evidence "to be
absolutely incredible and pure fabrication."  Sullivan, 773 F.2d
at 1189-90; see also Bruce v. City of Gainesville, 177 F.3d 949,
952 (11th Cir. 1999)(citing Sullivan)(reversing award of fees to
a prevailing ADA defendant under Christiansburg/Sullivan
standards).
     The reason for limiting fee awards against Title VII
plaintiffs to cases that meet this rigorous standard is the
important role that Title VII plaintiffs play in enforcing
federal civil rights laws, and the critical need to avoid
discouraging the filing of all but the most airtight claims. 
Christiansburg, 434 U.S. at 418, 422; Sayers v. Stewart Sleep
Center, Inc., 140 F.3d 1351, 1353 (11th Cir. 1998)("Policy
concerns militate against awarding attorney's fees to defendants
in civil rights cases because such practice may discourage
plaintiffs from bringing civil rights lawsuits.").  The same
considerations apply when EEOC is the losing plaintiff in a Title
VII action.  Christiansburg, 434 U.S. at 422 n.20.  Assessing
fees against EEOC simply because it did not prevail in a Title
VII claim would undermine Congressional efforts "to promote
vigorous enforcement of the provisions of Title VII."  EEOC v.
Bruno's Restaurant, 13 F.3d 285, 290 (9th Cir. 1993)(reversing
fee award against EEOC).  Therefore, a fee assessment against the
Commission, as with any Title VII plaintiff, must be limited to
those circumstances where EEOC's claims clearly lack any
"arguable legal merit or factual support."  See Jones v. Texas
Tech Univ., 656 F.2d at 1145-46.  EEOC's identification of
admissible evidence to support its discrimination claims will
defeat a Title VII defendant's claim for fees, even if EEOC's
evidence later turns out to be insufficient to prevail, because
under those circumstances EEOC's lawsuit would not be baseless. 
See EEOC v. Reichhold Chemical, 988 F.2d at 1571 (reversing fee
award against EEOC on grounds that "plaintiff merely must
establish a credible claim, not a successful one"); see also EEOC
v. Kenneth Balk & Assoc., 813 F.2d 197, 198 (8th Cir. 1987)
(reversing fee award against EEOC because "[h]owever unpersuasive
the EEOC's evidence ultimately proved to be, this evidence
provided 'some basis' for the EEOC's claim."); EEOC v. L.B.
Foster, 123 F.3d at 751 (reversing fee award against EEOC and
listing other cases in which fee awards against EEOC were
reversed on appeal).
     This case does not meet the stringent standards established
by the Supreme Court and this Court for an award of fees to a
Title VII defendant.  As a threshold matter, the district court
failed to make any findings that EEOC's claims lacked merit. 
This alone is a fatal flaw in the district court's fee award
decision. See EEOC v. Bruno's Restaurant, 13 F.3d at 288; see
also EEOC v. First Alabama Bank of Montgomery, 595 F.2d 1050,
1059 (5th Cir. 1979)(Rubin, C.J., dissenting). 
     Indeed, it is noteworthy that the lower court recounted in
some detail, and without significant criticism, many of the
factual allegations underlying the Commission's claims in its
February 20, 2002, order dismissing the EEOC's lawsuit.  See R.
90 at 2-4.  Among other things, the district court noted that
Robert Lewis began working for Asplundh as a laborer in November
1995 and that, while Lewis was employed by Asplundh, Pete Evans,
an inspector employed by the Gainesville Regional Utilities, made
daily inspection visits to the Asplundh worksite.  Id. at 2.  The
district court further noted that Lewis asserted he was subjected
to several incidents of racial harassment by Evans leading up to
an incident on April 1, 1996, when Evans came up behind Lewis,
placed a noose around his neck, pointed to a nearby tree and told
Lewis he would "hang him up there with the 'rest of your
family.'"  Id. at 3-4.  Two other Asplundh employees, including
Lewis's immediate foreman, witnessed the incident.  Id. at 3. 
Evans thereafter allegedly made similar comments to other
employees and referenced the incident with Lewis, stating that
"he [Evans] would hang [these other employees] up in the 'tree
with the rest of the monkeys--just ask Robert.'"  Id. at 4. 
Lewis stated that he complained to company representatives, id.
at 3-4, that sometime thereafter the General Foreman suggested
his job was in jeopardy as a result and, two months later, Lewis
was fired.  Id. at 4.  It is evident from this brief summary in
the district court's February dismissal decision that the EEOC's
factual allegations assert a claim for both harassment based on
race and retaliation under Title VII.  Whether these allegations
would be credited by a fact-finder, given Asplundh's contrary
version of some of these events, has not yet been tested.  For
purposes of this appeal, however, it is clear that EEOC's claims
of racial harassment and retaliation have not been and, indeed,
could not be found to be frivolous, unreasonable or wholly
without foundation, as Christiansburg requires for a fee award to
a Title VII defendant.
     The Commission has identified only one Court of Appeals that
applied the Christiansburg standard to EEOC's conciliation
actions, but even that case supports the Commission's position
that the award of fees here was improper.  In EEOC v. Bruno's
Restaurant, supra, the district court dismissed EEOC's claims
at the close of EEOC's case-in-chief at trial, finding that EEOC
failed to present credible evidence of discriminatory conduct. 
The court went on to find, as a separate matter, that EEOC had
also failed to conciliate the "pattern and practice" claims.  In
awarding attorney's fees to the defendant, the district court
stated that either finding was sufficient for the court to
conclude that the action was "frivolous, unreasonable, or without
foundation."  Id. at 287-88.  
     The Court of Appeals reversed the award of fees, finding
that the district court had failed to heed Christiansburg's
warning against engaging in post hoc reasoning that, because a
plaintiff did not ultimately prevail, his action must have been
unreasonable from the outset.  Id. at 290.  With respect to the
district court's findings on conciliation, the Ninth Circuit
stated that it "need not decide whether the EEOC in fact
conciliated the pattern and practice claim" but only "whether
[EEOC's] belief that it had done so was reasonable."  Id. at 288-
89; see also id. at 290 ("To justify an award of attorney's fees,
the district court would have had to find not merely that the
EEOC failed to conciliate adequately, but that its belief that
its conciliation efforts were adequate was unreasonable."). 
Concluding that EEOC could have reasonably believed that its
efforts to conciliate were sufficient, the Ninth Circuit reversed
the award of fees to the defendant.  Id. at 289.   
     Applying the Christiansburg standard to EEOC's conciliation
efforts in this instance leads to a similar conclusion that
EEOC's decision to end conciliation when it did and proceed with
the filing of this lawsuit was not unreasonable, frivolous or
without foundation.  In light of the absence of any explanation
from Asplundh for its belated response to the Commission's
conciliation proposal, the absence of any indication in the Sampo
letter that the company actually wanted to settle the claims, and
Sampo's failure to follow up by contacting the EEOC Regional
Attorney, the Commission reasonably believed, at the time, that
it had fully complied with the conciliation requirements of Title
VII.  Even if it is determined ultimately that the Commission
should have done more, the Commission's reasonable belief that
its actions were appropriate makes the award of attorney's fees
improper here under Christiansburg's rigorous standards.  As this
Court noted in Sullivan v. School Bd. of Pinellas County, "[e]ven
when the law or the facts appear questionable . . . at the
outset, a party may have an entirely reasonable ground for
bringing suit."  773 F.2d at 1189 (quoting Christiansburg, 434
U.S. at 422).   
B.   To the Extent the District Court Based its Fee Award on its
     Belief that EEOC Ignored the Sampo Letter and Could Recover
     Only Limited Monetary Damages in this Case, the Court
     Committed an Abuse of Discretion.

     The apparent bases for the district court's award of
attorney's fees   its view that EEOC never responded to, or even
acknowledged receiving, the Sampo letter, and its belief that
EEOC could recover only limited monetary damages for Lewis in
this case   are both critically flawed. 
     With respect to EEOC's response to the Sampo letter,
Asplundh now concedes that EEOC telephoned Sampo after it
received his letter.  Although Asplundh now argues that EEOC
should have done more, the district court did not have the
opportunity to assess that argument because Asplundh never
advanced it in the court below.  In any event, the award of fees
against the Commission cannot stand where it rests on a clearly
erroneous factual premise.  Moreover, even assuming, arguendo,
that this Court considers Asplundh's belated argument and
concludes the Commission should have done more after it received
Sampo's letter, the assessment of attorney's fees against the
Commission would still not be justified because, as noted above
at pp 30-31, supra, the question, in the context of a fee award,
is not whether EEOC erred in concluding that conciliation was
adequate, but whether EEOC's determination that it adequately
conciliated had a reasonable basis.  See EEOC v. Bruno's
Restaurant, 13 F.3d at 289-90.  In this instance, EEOC reasonably
believed that its conciliation efforts satisfied Title VII.  See
discussion at 32, supra.  In light of this reasonable belief, the
district court abused its discretion in awarding attorney's fees
to Asplundh. 
     With respect to the lower court's view on the amount of
potential monetary relief, EEOC submits that the amount of
damages potentially at issue in a Title VII case is not a proper
factor in determining whether conciliation was adequate or
whether attorney's fees should be awarded to the defendant.  See
EEOC's Opening Brief in EEOC v. Asplundh I at 35-37; see also
Sayers v. Stewart Sleep Center, Inc., 140 F.3d at 1354 (amount of
damages plaintiff sought in litigation not a proper factor in
considering whether to award fees to defendant after jury
returned verdict in defendant's favor).  
     The district court's view of the potential damages in this
case is, however, not only irrelevant, but also legally flawed. 
In concluding that EEOC could recover only limited monetary
damages on Lewis's behalf (four months of backpay, see R. 90 at
10), the district court ignored the potentially extensive
compensatory and punitive damages that a jury might award for
EEOC's claim that Asplundh failed to take effective steps to
address GRU Inspector Evans' racial harassment of Lewis at the
worksite.  See EEOC's Opening Brief in EEOC v. Asplundh I at 37-
39 (discussing egregious nature of racial harassment based on
nooses and threats of lynching in the workplace); 42 U.S.C. 
1981a (compensatory and punitive damages available in Title VII
action against a defendant who engaged in unlawful intentional
discrimination).  Accordingly, the lower court's views on the
amount of monetary damages recoverable in this case was not only
an improper factor in determining whether to grant fees to
Asplundh, but was legally unsupportable, as well.
                                

                           CONCLUSION
     For all of the foregoing reasons, the EEOC respectfully
submits that the district court erred when it awarded attorney's
fees and costs against the Commission and in favor of Asplundh. 
That fee award should be reversed and the matter should be
remanded to the district court for entry of an appropriate order.
                                Respectfully Submitted,

1. Citations to the record refer to the district court docket entries 
and are abbreviated R. followed by the district courts docket number.
  Citations to the Record Excerpts are abbreviated RE followed by the
 page number in Appellant EEOCs Record Excerpts filed with this Court
 on June 17, 2002, in conjunction with EEOCs opening brief in EEOC v.
 Asplundh I, No. 02-12386-E, which has now been consolidated with this
 appeal.

2. Wests log indicates, specifically, that West received a fax from RR
 (Respondents representative, or Sampo) on 4/29/99 and then called Sampo 
the same day and left a message.  The log further indicates that on 5/5/99
 Sampo returned Wests call and left a message on Wests voice mail.  The 
log indicates that West returned Sampos call three business days later, 
on 5/10/99, and left a message to contact the Regional Attorney because
 the case is out of my hands.  RE67.

	Asplundh presented a different version of these facts to the court
 below.  In his March 8, 2001, affidavit, R. 81, Sampo indicated that after 
he sent the letter, he never received any communication from Ms. West, or
 from anyone with the EEOC.  Id. at 9 (RE63). 

3. The court did not reach two other matters pending before it at the time:  
Asplundhs motion for summary judgment and EEOCs motion for partial summary 
judgment regarding a number of the defendants affirmative defenses.  R. 90 
at 1, 12.

4. The court also stated, erroneously, that the Commission filed this lawsuit 
the day after Sampo sent his letter.  See R. 90 at 10 (The EEOCs response to 
the [Defendants letter of April 28, 1999] was the filing of the instant lawsuit
 one day thereafter.).  This statement is clearly erroneous, and is inconsistent
 not only with the undisputed facts but also with statements the district court
 made elsewhere in its opinion.

5. This Court has adopted as binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth 
Circuit handed down prior to the close of business on September 30, 1981.  See 
Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.3d 1209 (11th Cir. 1981) (en banc). 

6. The factual basis on which the district court premised its award of attorneys
 fees is not clear because the court did not issue any separate findings of fact 
or conclusions of law in conjunction with its June 12, 2002, order and judgment 
awarding fees and costs.  See R. 99, 100.  The lower courts failure to make specific
 findings regarding the applicable legal standards leaves this Court (and the parties)
 at a distinct disadvantage in their respective efforts to review (and present 
arguments) concerning the propriety of the award of fees.  We can only assume the
 court awarded fees for the same reasons that it dismissed EEOCs lawsuit, as reflected
 in the courts February 20, 2002, order (R. 90). 

7. The Court in Christiansburg found it established that under  706(k) of Title
 VII a prevailing plaintiff ordinarily is to be awarded attorneys fees in all but
 special circumstances.  434 U.S. at 417 (emphasis in original; citing Albemarle
 Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405, 415 (1975); other citations omitted).

8. The Supreme Court made clear in Christiansburg that although it was announcing 
a general standard for awarding attorneys fees to prevailing Title VII defendants,
 the same standard applied where EEOC was the plaintiff.  See 434 U.S. at 422 n.20.

9. Although Hanrahan involved an award of attorneys fees under 42 U.S.C.  1988, 
the Supreme Court has applied the same standards to fee awards under  2000e-5(k) and
  1988, see Hughes v. Rowe, 449 U.S. 5, 14 (1980), and the reasoning in Hanrahan has
 been applied to petitions for attorneys fees brought by defendants in Title VII actions.
  See, e.g., DeShiro v. Branch, 183 F.R.D. 281, 285 (M.D. Fla. 1998); see also Burke v.
 Furniture House of North Carolina, No. C-89-169-S, 1990 WL 209662 (M.D.N.C. Sept. 13,
 1990)(copy attached).

10. See, e.g., EEOC v. Zia, 582 F.2d 527, 533 (10th Cir. 1978)(adequacy of conciliation 
not a matter of jurisdiction).

11. This Court, in Sullivan, identified several additional factors to be considered, including:
 (1) whether a plaintiff established a prima facie case; (2) whether the defendant offered to 
settle; and (3) whether the trial court dismissed the case prior to trial or held a full-blown
 trial on the merits.  773 F.2d at 1189.  This Court has emphasized, however, that these are 
general guidelines only, not hard and fast rules, and that [d]eterminations regarding frivolity
 are to be made on a case-by-case basis.  Ibid.; Walker v. NationsBank, 53 F.3d at 1559.  As 
this Court recently noted in reversing a fee award to a Title VII defendant following summary 
judgment in the defendants favor, Sullivan does not create a bright line checklist nor does 
it permit of a mechanical application.  Bonner v. Mobile Energy Servs. Co., 246 F.3d 1303, 
1304 n.9 (11th Cir. 2001)(per curiam)(citations omitted).

12. Brunos Restaurant cited EEOC v. Pierce Packing Co., 669 F.2d 605, 609 (9th Cir. 1982), for
 the principle that failure to conciliate can be a basis for awarding attorneys fees to a defendant
 in a Title VII case.  13 F.3d at 288.  Although Pierce also applied the Christiansburg standard
 in awarding fees against the Commission, 669 F.2d at 609, the case is factually distinguishable 
from the present matter because in Pierce EEOC was attempting to enforce a pre-reasonable cause 
settlement agreement with an employer without first investigating a charge, issuing a reasonable
 cause finding, and then engaging in conciliation on the asserted claims.  See discussion in EEOCs
 Reply Brief in EEOC v. Asplundh I at 26 n.16.
