AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION...UPDATED AVIATION DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE SPOKANE WA
351 PM PST TUE FEB 10 2009
.SYNOPSIS...
A MORE ACTIVE WEATHER PATTERN WILL RESULT IN A SERIES OF PACIFIC
STORMS PASSING MOSTLY SOUTH OF THE REGION THROUGH THE WEEK. THE
INLAND NORTHWEST OF WASHINGTON AND IDAHO WILL LIKELY RECEIVE MINOR
SNOW ACCUMULATIONS FROM THE FRINGES OF THESE STORMS.
&&
.DISCUSSION...
TONIGHT...LIGHT PRECIPITATION WILL SPREAD ACROSS THE INLAND 
NORTHWEST TONIGHT AS A WARM FRONT ADVANCES ACROSS THE REGION. THE 
20Z SATELLITE WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS THE MOISTURE ASSOCIATED WITH 
THE WARM FRONT BEING PUSHED AHEAD OF THE UPPER LOW SPINNING OFF THE 
WASHINGTON COAST. MODELS ARE IN VERY GOOD AGREEMENT ON TRACKING THE 
SURFACE LOW SOUTH ALONG THE COAST BUT HAVE SLOWED THE EASTWARD 
PROGRESSION OF THE PRECIPITATION FIELD SOMEWHAT. WEBCAMS INDICATE 
THAT SNOW HAS BEEN FALLING THIS AFTERNOON AT THE CASCADE PASSES BUT 
IS ONLY SLOWLY ADVANCING PAST THE CREST. POPS HAVE BEEN TRIMMED
BACK FOR THE AFTERNOON HOURS TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS. THERE IS
AGREEMENT ON THE FORMATION OF A DEFORMATION BAND ACROSS THE
SOUTHEAST PORTION OF THE FORECAST AREA AS A BOUNDARY SETS UP OVER
THE AREA OVERNIGHT. THE EXACT LOCATION OF THIS BOUNDARY WILL
DETERMINE WHICH AREA RECEIVES ANY SIGNIFICANT SNOWFALL. LATEST
GUIDANCE PLACES IT IN THE GENERAL AREA OF THE PALOUSE SO HIGHEST
POPS HAVE BEEN PAINTED ACROSS THIS AREA TONIGHT. POPS HAVE BEEN
TRIMMED ACROSS THE NORTHEAST ZONES AS WE EXPECT THE BOUNDARY WILL
HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME MAKING IT THAT FAR NORTH AS THE PARENT LOW
CONTINUES TO SINK SOUTH. SNOW LEVELS WILL CONTINUE AT VALLEY
FLOORS WITH AN INCH OR LESS OF SNOWFALL EXPECTED FOR MOST OF THE
FORECAST AREA. THE EXCEPTION WILL BE ALONG THE EAST SLOPES AND
UNDER THE DEFORMATION BAND WHERE GENERALLY 1 TO 2 INCHES CAN BE
EXPECTED WITH LOCAL AMOUNTS UP TO 3 INCHES POSSIBLE DEPENDING ON
THE STRENGTH AND DURATION OF ANY SNOWBANDS. LOCAL SNOWFALL AMOUNTS
WILL BE BORDERLINE ADVISORY BUT I DO NOT HAVE THE CONFIDENCE LEVEL
REQUIRED TO ISSUE WINTER WEATHER HIGHLIGHTS AT THIS TIME. /KELCH
WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT...MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT
DURING THIS PERIOD. VERTICALLY STACKED LOW OFF THE CENTRAL OREGON
COAST WED AM WILL DROP SOUTH TOWARDS NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WED
AFTERNOON. AS THIS OCCURS WHAT IS LEFT OF A DEFORMATION ZONE OVER
SE WASHINGTON INTO THE CENTRAL PANHANDLE WILL RAPIDLY WEAKEN. THUS
LIGHT SNOW ACCUMULATIONS WILL CONTINUE ON WEDNESDAY OVER THESE
AREAS BEFORE ENDING. THE SPOKANE/COEUR D'ALENE AREAS LOOK TO BE ON THE
EDGE OF THIS DEFORMATION ZONE WEDNESDAY RESULTING IN A CHANCE FOR
LIGHT SNOW...WITH PRECIP CHANCES QUICKLY DECREASING NORTH AND WEST
OF THE SPOKANE AREA. FOR WED NGT A SHORT WAVE RIDGE BUILDS IN
BRINGING LIGHT WINDS...WHICH IN COMBINATION WITH A MOIST BOUNDARY
LAYER WILL LEAD TO AREAS OF FREEZING FOG ESPECIALLY AREAS THAT
HAVE FRESH SNOW COVER FROM TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY SNOWFALL.
THE PATTERN FOR WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY FOR CENTRAL AND
EASTERN WA...AS WELL AS NORTH IDAHO WILL BE FOR GENERALLY DRY
CONDITIONS AS ANOTHER LOW DROPS SOUTH TOWARDS CALIFORNIA THU
NGT/FRIDAY. JUST A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR SNOW SHOWERS IS FORECAST FOR
THE EAST SLOPES OF THE NORTH WA CASCADES GIVEN CLOSEST PROXIMITY
TO THIS FEATURE ALONG WITH A LOW AND MID LEVEL UPSLOPE FLOW
COMPONENT. THERE WILL ALSO BE A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR MOUNTAIN SNOW
SHOWERS OVER NORTH IDAHO AS VERY WEAK IMPULSES TRACK SE FROM
BRITISH COLUMBIA INTO MONTANA. TEMPERATURES WILL REMAIN BELOW
NORMAL FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR WITH THE TROUGH PATTERN PERSISTING
ALONG THE WESTERN US. JW
SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY...THE PRIMARY STORM TRACK WILL LIKELY
CONTINUE TO REMAIN FOCUSED INTO CALIFORNIA THIS WEEKEND INTO EARLY
NEXT WEEK. THERE IS SOME INDICATION THAT THE WEATHER PATTERN MAY
SHIFT A BIT BY THE MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK...BUT THE MEDIUM RANGE
MODELS CONTINUE TO FOCUS THE POLAR JET INTO CALIFORNIA THROUGH AT
LEAST NEXT WEDNESDAY. THE GFS ENSEMBLES AS WELL AS THE OPERATIONAL
ECMWF AGREE THAT THE RIDGE CURRENTLY ANCHORED ALONG 150W WILL
SLOWLY RETROGRADE TO ABOUT 170W BY EARLY NEXT WEEK. SO BY THE
SECOND HALF OF NEXT WEEK...WE MAY EXPERIENCE A PATTERN SHIFT THAT
WILL BE MORE FAVORABLE FOR MORE PRECIPITATION. UNTIL THEN...THE
MAIN JET DYNAMICS AND DEEP MOISTURE PLUME WILL BE WELL SOUTH OF
THE SPOKANE FORECAST AREA.
PRECIPITATION CHANCES WERE HELD BELOW CLIMATOLOGY ON SATURDAY WITH
THE PRESENCE OF A WEAK SHORTWAVE RIDGE. THE MODELS BEGIN TO
DIVERGE ON SUNDAY...WITH THE 06Z AND 12Z RUNS OF THE GFS
FORECASTING A WEAK UPPER TROUGH TRANSLATING ACROSS WASHINGTON
SUNDAY INTO MONDAY. THE ECMWF CARRIES ALMOST NO UPPER TROUGH.
GIVEN THE MODEL UNCERTAINTY...THE FORECAST HAS BEEN TRENDED TOWARD
CLIMATOLOGY SUNDAY...MONDAY...AND TUESDAY. EVEN IF THE GFS
VERIFIES...I WOULDN'T EXPECT ANY BIG SNOW ACCUMULATIONS. AS FOR
TEMPERATURES...GFS GUIDANCE LOOKS TOO WARM GIVEN THE LIGHT
PRESSURE GRADIENT AND COOL 850MB TEMPERATURES. HIGHS HAVE BEEN
KEPT AT OR BELOW AVERAGE...WHICH IS CLOSER TO THE GFS ENSEMBLE
NUMBERS. /GKOCH

.AVIATION...
A BAND OF -SN THAT STRETCHED FROM KYKM TO KEAT AS OF 2330Z WILL MOVE 
EAST THIS EVENING LEADING TO LOWERING CIGS AND VSBYS AT ALL TAF 
SITES.  MVFR AND IFR CIGS/VSBYS WILL BE COMMON ONCE -SN DEVELOPS.  
LIGHT SNOW ACCUMULATIONS ARE EXPECTED WITH THE HIGHEST ACCUMULATIONS 
AT KPUW.  SOME IMPROVEMENT IS FORECAST ON WEDNESDAY...BUT VERY MOIST 
CONDITIONS IN THE LOW LEVELS WILL LIKELY LEAD TO MVFR/IFR STRATUS 
AFTER SNOW STOPS.  JW
