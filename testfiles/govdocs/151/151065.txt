A NATIONAL MODEL OF SMART GROWTH 

ARLINGTON COUNTY’S EXPERIENCE WITH TRANSIT RELATED DEVELOPMENT

Introduction

-OVERVIEW OF EFFORTS TO CONNECT LAND USE & TRANSIT

-HOW WE PLANNED AND SOME OF THE TOOLS WE USED

-IDENTIFY SOME OF THE SUCCESSES AND LESSONS LEARNED


SETTING THE STAGE

-ARLINGTON IS A 26 SQ. MILE, URBAN COUNTY WHICH WAS A PART OF THE ORIGINAL DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA


SETTING THE STAGE

- 1960 - 7.5 MILLION SQ. FT. OFFICE
- DECLINING RETAIL CORRIDORS
- EMERGING MARKET FOR GOVERNMENT OFFICE SPACE
- STRONG SINGLE FAMILY
- LARGE NUMBER OF GARDEN APARTMENTS
- 97,505 JOBS
- 71,230 HOUSING UNITS


SETTING THE STAGE
- BEGINNING OF THE PLANNING FOR A REGIONAL TRANSIT SYSTEM
- ARLINGTON LOBBIED STRONGLY FOR UNDERGROUND ROUTE  VS WITHIN THE MEDIAN OF I-66
- EMBARKED ON AN AMBITIOUS COMMUNITY PLANNING EFFORT

SETTING THE STAGE
- 25 + YEAR EFFORT TO ORIENT SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT TO TRANSIT AND USE IT FOR REVITALIZATION
- THE COUNTY DECIDED IT WANTED TO ENCOURAGE GROWTH
- ENCOURAGE TRANSIT RIDERSHIP


HOW WE DID IT
- SERIES OF PLANNING EFFORTS TO LOOK AT THE FUTURE OF THE COUNTY
- MAJOR POLICY GOALS RESULTED 
- 50/50 TAX BASE MIX OF RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL
- MIXED-USE DEVELOPMENT WITH A SIGNIFICANT LEVEL OF RESIDENTIAL
- PRESERVE EXISTING SINGLE FAMILY AND GARDEN APARTMENTS
- FOCUS REDEVELOPMENT WITHIN 1/4 MILE OF METRO STATION ENTRANCES

HOW WE DID IT
- AFTER ADOPTING A CORRIDOR-WIDE GLUP, THE COUNTY FOCUSED ON DEVELOPING SECTOR PLANS
- FOCUSED ON AREA 1/4 MILE FROM THE METRO STATION 
- THE SECTOR PLANS IDENTIFY
	- DESIRED PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS
	- LOCATION FOR RETAIL
	- URBAN DESIGN STANDARDS
	- PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS
	- OPEN SPACE, STREETS CAPE STANDARDS
	- TRANSITIONS TO ADJACENT NEIGHBORHOODS


KEY TO SUCCESS
- WHEN THE PLANNING STARTED FOR METRO
– 95% OF COUNTY PLANNED LOW DENSITY RESIDENTIAL, GARDEN APARTMENT OR RETAIL.  LITTLE UNPLANNED DEVELOPMENT CAN OCCUR
- 5 % OF COUNTY (2 RAIL CORRIDORS) WERE RE-PLANNED TO ENCOURAGE MIXED-USE, HIGH DENSITY DEVELOPMENT



HOW WE DID IT
- GLUP FOR METRO CORRIDORS INDICATED THE COUNTY’S WILLINGNESS TO REZONE FOR HIGHER DENSITY BUT LAND REMAINED ZONED FOR FAIRLY LOW DENSITY
- IN RESPONSE TO DEVELOPMENT PROPOSALS, COUNTY BOARD WOULD REZONE FOR HIGHER DENSITY USE
n- A SPECIAL EXCEPTION, SITE PLAN IS USED TO APPROVE THE DEVELOPMENT
- THE SITE PLAN ALLOWS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER DENSITY & HEIGHT THAN UNDERLYING ZONING	 (1.5 - 3.8, 55 ft - 153 ft)
- SITE PLAN IS APPROVED ONLY IF:
- IT COMPLIES WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE ZONING ORDINANCE,
- IT IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE MIX REQUIRED BY THE GLUP
- IT PROVIDES THE FEATURES CALLED FOR IN THE SECTOR PLAN FOR THE AREA - INCLUDING PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS
- PROPERTY OWNER ALWAYS MAINTAINS UNDERLYING BY-RIGHT ZONING
