<p align="center"><a name="2"></a><b><u>NATURE AND STAGE OF THE PROCEEDING</u></b>

<p>The United States filed this case on January 5, 1999, to prevent Dentsply
International, Inc. ("Dentsply") from continuing to violate the antitrust laws by denying
rival tooth manufacturers access to independent tooth dealers and maintaining its
monopoly in the prefabricated artificial tooth market. On April 3, 2000, Dentsply moved
for summary judgment (D.I. 230).

<p align="center"><a name="3"></a><strong><u>SUMMMARY OF ARGUMENT</u></strong>

<p>Dentsply, with a 70%-80% share of the artificial tooth market, has repeatedly
coerced tooth dealers to drop (or not add) competing tooth lines, in order to "block
competitive distribution points [and] not allow competition to achieve toeholds in
dealers." (B-315).<a href="#N1"><sup>1</sup></a> In doing so, it has maintained its monopoly power. It has kept prices
artificially high. It has restricted the availability of aesthetically superior teeth sold by
Dentsply's competitors. It has raised barriers to entry. And it has foreclosed its closest
competitors from approximately 80% of the market. These anticompetitive effects far
outweigh the theoretical and unsubstantiated justifications Dentsply has proffered.

<p>The evidence set forth below should be viewed in the light most favorable to the
United States, the non-moving party. <u>Redden v. Unum Life Ins. Co of Am.</u>, 2000 WL
135137, *1 (D. Del. Jan. 18, 2000). Dentsply's motion provides no basis for judgment as a
matter of law. First, Dentsply fails to address the relevant case law under Section 2 of the
Sherman Act ("Section 2"). Second, Dentsply mischaracterizes exclusive dealing cases
under Section 1 of the Sherman Act
("Section 1") and Section 3 of the Clayton Act ("Section 3"). Those cases involved
defendants with lower market shares, lower foreclosure rates, and few, if any,
demonstrated anticompetitive effects.<a href="#N2"><sup>2</sup></a> Indeed, most of the cases Dentsply relies upon
are private cases, brought by a single, terminated dealer (<u>e.g.</u>, <u>Roland Machinery</u>) or a
single, disgruntled competitor (<u>e.g.</u>, <u>CDC Technologies</u>) where there was little if any
evidence of harm to competition or consumers. In this case, there is substantial evidence
of market-wide effects on consumer choice, price, and quality, resulting from foreclosure
that has been widespread, pervasive and longstanding.

<p>While appropriate in some circumstances, summary judgment is infrequently
merited in complex antitrust litigation because of its fact-intensive nature. <u>Barr Lab., Inc.
v. Abbott Lab.</u>, 978 F.2d 98, 105 (3d Cir. 1992). Courts should be especially cautious before
entering summary judgment where, as here, liability turns on factual questions about the
purpose and effects of conduct whose existence is not disputed. <u>See</u>, <u>e.g.</u>, <u>Eastman Kodak
Co. v. Image Technical Servs. Inc.</u>, 504 U.S. 451, 482-86 (1992)


<p align="center"><a name="4"></a><b><u>STATEMENT OF FACTS</u></b>

<p>1. Dentsply is the world's leading manufacturer of dental prosthetics and other
dental products. (B-769). Its Trubyte Division sells products, including artificial teeth,
used by dental laboratories to make dentures and other removable dental prosthetics. 
(B-770). <b>[REDACTED]</b>

<p>2.        Vita Zahnfabrik ("Vita") and Ivoclar AG ("Ivoclar") are Dentsply's closest
competitors in the tooth market.<a href="#N3"><sup>3</sup></a> Dentsply, dealers, and labs agree that Vita and
Ivoclar sell
"excellent," "high quality" teeth<a href="#N4"><sup>4</sup></a> Each has achieved significant success in several
foreign markets.

<p>Vita and Ivoclar have competed in the U.S. market since the late 1970s.
(Rebuttal Expert Report of Prof. Howard P. Marvel.,<b>[REDACTED]</b>).


<p>3. Over the past ten years, Dentsply has maintained a market share in the artificial
tooth market of 70% to 80%. (Expert Report Dr. David Reitman, B-1060).<a href="#N5"><sup>5</sup></a> In a 1991
study
commissioned by Dentsply, its market share was 80%. (B-294-302; B-280-93; Thumim
(DS), B-
2179-95). In two other studies, survey results were "comparable." Thumim (DS),
B-2187-90;
<u>see</u> <u>also</u> Weiland (DS), B-<b>[REDACTED]</b>2253 (Dentsply's share during his 1991-96 tenure was 80%).
Dentsply's competitors in the U.S. tooth market each have single-digit market shares.
Vita's share
is below 5%.<a href="#N6"><sup>6</sup></a> Ivoclar's share is only slightly larger.<a href="#N7"><sup>7</sup></a> Austenal, Inc.'s share is likely
below 5%.<a href="#N8"><sup>8</sup></a>
<p>
4. Dentsply sells Trubyte teeth only to independent dealers.   These dealers sell
thousands of products manufactured by hundreds of vendors to dental laboratories.
These dealers
market themselves under their own name, and not the name of Dentsply or any other
vendor.<a href="#N9"><sup>9</sup></a>
<p>
5. In 1993, through publication of its "Dealer Criteria," Dentsply expressly stated its
refusal to deal with dealers that added its rivals' tooth lines. (B-273) (Dealer Criterion 6,
stating
that dealers "may not add further tooth lines to their product offering").   Dentsply's
practice of
refusing to deal on these terms existed and was enforced before 1993.<a href="#N10"><sup>10</sup></a> This policy 
<b>[REDACTED]</b> appears
to be unique in the industry; no other vendor prohibits dealers selling its lab products
from adding competitive products.<a href="#N11"><sup>11</sup></a>

<p>6. Dealers offer many services for dental lab customers, including the regular
reordering and restocking of teeth, facilitating tooth returns, and "one-stop shopping"
for the numerous products labs need.<a href="#N12"><sup>12</sup></a> Dealers with a nearby tooth stock are also able
to provide teeth on a same-day basis, either by pick up or delivery, which is important
generally and essential for cases involving denture repairs and other emergencies.
(Reitman Rept., B-1063-64).<a href="#N13"><sup>13</sup></a> Labs prefer to buy teeth from a dealer, even when those
same teeth may be purchased directly from the manufacturer. <u>Id.</u>, B-l062-68.<a href="#N14"><sup>14</sup></a>


<p>7.        Since 1987, Dentsply has used its monopoly power to coerce dealers into
dropping (or not adding) Vita, Ivoclar, and other rival tooth lines. For example:

<p><ul><li>In 1987, Frink Dental agreed to start selling Ivoclar teeth because its
owner, Thomas Cavanaugh, saw aesthetic advantages with them.
Dentsply terminated Frink as both a tooth and merchandise dealer.
Dentsply also threatened to terminate other dealers that were supplying
Frink with Trubyte teeth. When his supply of Trubyte teeth dried up, and
he began worrying about losing other Dentsply business, Cavanaugh
agreed to drop the Ivoclar teeth and was promptly reinstated. (Cavanaugh
(Frink), B-1514-48; Brennan (DS), B-1494).

<p><li>Sometime after 1993, Atlanta Dental Supply ("ADS") became interested in
selling Vita teeth because it had received a number of requests for them
from its lab customers. ADS came to a tentative agreement with Vident,
but backed off after Dentsply threatened ADS with termination. (Harris
(Atlanta), B-l737-58).

<p><li>In 1994, after receiving customer requests for Vita teeth, Pearson Dental Supply
("Pearson") took on a consignment of Vita teeth and began advertising
them in its catalog. When Dentsply threatened to terminate Pearson, it not
only dropped Vita but also declined to add Austenal's Myerson line, in
which it also had an interest. (Kashfian (Pearson), B-l827-48, 1864-66,
1869-70).

<p><li>In 1995, Dental Technicians Supply ("DTS") was permitted to resume
selling Trubyte teeth only after DTS agreed to stop selling Vita, Ivoclar, and
Justi teeth at its Kansas City and Denver locations. In New York, it was
required to stop selling Ivoclar and limit the areas in which it marketed
and sold Vita. (Raths (DTS), B-2048-71, 2075-80;</ul>

<p align="center"><a name="5"></a><strong><u>ARGUMENT</u></strong>


<p><a name="6"></a>
<ol type="I"><strong><li>Dentsply is not entitled
to summary judgment under &#167; 2 of the Sherman Act</li></strong></ol>

<p>Section 2 of the Sherman Act prohibits a firm with monopoly power from
maintaining that monopoly power through means that go beyond competition on the
merits:

<p><blockquote>"The offense of monopoly under &#167; 2 of the Sherman Act has two elements:
(1) the possession of monopoly power in the relevant market and (2) the
willful acquisition or maintenance of that power as distinguished from
growth or development as a consequence of a superior product, business
acumen, or historic accident."</blockquote>

<p><u>Kodak</u>, 504 U.S. at 480 (quoting <u>United States v. Grinnell Corp.</u>, 384 U.S. 563, 570-71
(1966)).

<p><a name="7"></a><ol><ol type="A"><strong><li>Dentsply possesses monopoly power.</li></strong></ol></ol>

<p>Monopoly power is "the power to control market prices or exclude competition."
<u>United States v. E.I. duPont de Nemours &amp; Co.</u>, 351 U.S. 377, 391 (1956). A defendant's
high market share is sufficient to support an inference of monopoly power unless ease
of entry negates the inference. <u>Oahu Gas Serv., Inc v. Pacific Resources, Inc.</u>, 838 F.2d
360, 366 (9th Cir. 1988). In this case, Dentsply's high market share is sufficient to infer
monopoly power, and there are significant barriers to entry and expansion.

<p><a name="8"></a><ol><ol><ol><strong><li>Dentsply's market share of 70%-80% is sufficient to infer
monopoly power.</li></strong></ol></ol></ol>

<p>Dentsply does not dispute, nor could it, that its market share is sufficiently high
to infer the existence of monopoly power. A market share in excess of 70% is almost
always sufficient for this purpose. <u>American Tobacco Co. v. United States</u>, 328 U.S. 781,
797 (1946) (over 66% of the market is a monopoly). Dentsply has consistently maintained
over the past ten years a market share between 70% and 80%. (Statement of Facts
("Facts") &#182; 3).

<p><a name="9"></a><ol><ol><ol start="2"><strong><li>There are significant barriers to entry and expansion.</li></strong></ol></ol></ol>

<p>Dentsply claims that "[i]t is apparent that there are no barriers to entry in the
market for artificial teeth." Dentsply Memorandum ("DS Mem.") (D.I. 231) at 38. But
within the last ten years, at least two companies declined to enter the United States tooth
market after concluding that entry barriers are high and that Dentsply's control over
dealers would limit their ability to achieve more than a minimal market share. <b>[REDACTED]</b>


<p>Similarly, Heraeus Kulzer, Inc. ("Heraeus"), a subsidiary of its German parent
Heraeus Kulzer GmbH ("Heraeus GmbH"), considered and rejected entering the tooth
market on several occasions, concluding that the "barriers to introduce [teeth] were just
too great and it would not be financially worthwhile to be successful." (Foyle (Heraeus),
B-1646-47; <u>see</u> <u>also</u> <u>id.</u>, B-1644-45).   A "key factor" in its decision was Dentsply's dealer
criteria.   (Id., B-1648). <b>[REDACTED]</b>

<p>Dentsply asserts that Heraeus GmbH has recently entered the market through a
different affiliate, and that this demonstrates the lack of entry barriers. DS Mem. at 18, 22,
38. But the only evidence it cites -- the testimony of Austenal's General Manager James
Swartout that an Austenal manager once saw one Heraeus tooth stock (of undetermined
size) in one laboratory (Swartout (Austenal), B-2162) -- shows that any such entry would
be too small and ineffective to be a serious threat to Dentsply. And because Heraeus
GmbH would be selling directly, Swartout expects that it would have a difficult time
succeeding in the market. (<u>Id.</u>, B-2163-65).<a href="#N15"><sup>15</sup></a>

<p>Such "entry" would be insufficient to prevent Dentsply from exercising monopoly
power. "The fact that entry has occurred does not necessarily preclude the existence of
'significant' entry barriers. If the output or capacity of the new entrant is insufficient to
take significant business away from the predator, they are unlikely to represent a
challenge to the predator's market power." <u>Rebel Oil Co. v. Atlantic Richfield Co.</u>, 51 F.3d
1421, 1440 (9th Cir. 1995). Thus, in <u>Oahu Gas</u>, the court affirmed a finding of monopoly
power even though <u>two</u> rivals entered the market and collectively gained a 32% market
share. 838 F.2d at 366, 367. In <u>Reazin v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Kansas, Inc.</u>, 899 F.2d
951 (10th Cir. 1990), despite <u>200</u> rivals and theoretically low barriers, "the fact remains
that no other entrant remotely approached [defendant's] domination of the market."
<u>Id.</u> at 971.<a href="#N16"><sup>16</sup></a>

<p>In the tooth market, no entrant has remotely approached Dentsply's dominant
position. (Facts &#182; 3). Dentsply cites increases in Vita and Ivoclar's sales (<u>see</u> DS Mem. at
20-21, 38), but ignores the even larger growth in its own sales.<a href="#N17"><sup>17</sup></a> Despite competing for
over 20 years, the market shares of both Vita and Ivoclar are still stuck in the mid-single
digits. (Facts &#182 3). Austenal's share is similarly low. <u>Id.</u>

<p>Dentsply's own documents and the testimony of its executives
show that the failure of its competitors to achieve greater success is tied to their
lack of an effective dealer network.<a href="#N18"><sup>18</sup></a> As a result, none of its rivals has been able
to expand sufficiently to discipline Dentsply's exercise of monopoly power.

<p>Dentsply's monopoly power is evident from its ability to sell, for many
years, an aesthetically inferior tooth without losing substantial market share.
Dentsply was aware throughout the early 1990s that its premium teeth were rated
below both Ivoclar's and Vita's in overall aesthetics, and that more and more
dentists were prescribing teeth using Vita's popular shade guide. (B-544-45, 547).<a href="#N19"><sup>19</sup></a>
Because the vast majority of Dentsply's teeth did not match these Vita shades,
consumers were dissatisfied. (B-549).<a href="#N20"><sup>20</sup></a> This dissatisfaction existed for a long time,
and Dentsply was "late" in addressing it. (B-260).<a href="#N21"><sup>21</sup></a>


<p>Despite this long-running dissatisfaction, Dentsply did not lose substantial
market share. When receiving a prescription for a Vita-shaded tooth, labs
continued to settle for a Trubyte tooth 72% of the time, (B-548), and Vita's market
share remained low due to this "significant lab substitution and cross-matching
to [Dentsply's] shades." <u>Id.</u> Dentsply vigorously exercised its monopoly power
during this period to ensure that dealers did not respond to the growing
consumer demand for Vita-shaded teeth.<a href="#N22"><sup>22</sup></a> Dentsply's ability to prevent dealers
from adding rival tooth lines in spite of the consumer demand for them is telling
evidence of its monopoly power and the inability of its competitors to challenge
that power. <u>See</u> <u>Byars v. Bluff City News Co.</u>, 609 F.2d 843, 853 n.26 (6th Cir.
1979)(evidence of inferior service "lends strong support" to finding of monopoly
power).<a href="#N23"><sup>23</sup></a>

<p>The second element under Section 2 is "the willful acquisition or maintenance of
[monopoly] power as distinguished from growth or development as a consequence of
a superior product, business acumen, or historic accident." <u>Grinnell</u>, 384 U.S. at 570-71.
This requires a determination of whether the monopolist has engaged in exclusionary
conduct that '"either does not further competition on the merits or does so in an
unnecessarily restrictive way."' <u>Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp.</u>, 472
U.S. 585, 605 n.32 (1985) (quoting 3 P. Areeda &amp; D. Turner, <u>Antitrust Law</u> &#182; 626, at 78

<p><a name="11"></a><ol><ol><ol><strong><li>Dentsply's intent has been exclusionary and anticompetitive.</li></strong></ol></ol></ol>

<p>Evidence of Dentsply's intent in foreclosing its competitors from tooth dealers is
"relevant to the question whether the challenged conduct is fairly characterized as
'exclusionary' or 'anticompetitive.'" <u>Aspen Skiing</u>, 472 U.S. at 602. Dentsply's documents
reflect very clearly its intent to "block competitive distribution points [and] not allow
competition to achieve toeholds in dealers." (B-315). Dentsply's exclusionary intent was
particularly apparent before its introduction of the Portrait line in late 1995, when
blocking the distribution of Vita and Ivoclar's aesthetically superior teeth was of
paramount importance.




<p>In 1987, when Dentsply learned of Frink Dental's interest in Ivoclar teeth,
its high-level executives met with Frink's owner, Thomas Cavanaugh. (Borgelt
(DS), B-1451-52; Cavanaugh (Frink), B-1514-15, 1534-35). When Cavanaugh asked
why Dentsply would terminate him for adding Ivoclar teeth, Dentsply's chief
executive officer replied, "[w]e cannot let Ivoclar get a foothold in the United
States. This is our most highly profitable product ..." (Cavanaugh (Frink),
B-1536).<a href="#N24"><sup>24</sup></a> According to Gordon Hagler, who became Trubyte's Director of Sales
and Marketing two years later, "Ivoclar was a threat; they had a different mold
and different shading technique, and we never wanted them to get a foothold in
the distributor network." (Hagler, B-1677).<a href="#N25"><sup>25</sup></a>

<p>Dentsply executives have conceded that it has had more dealers than
necessary to properly distribute its teeth. (Brennan (DS), B-1497-98; Clark (DS),
B-1591). Nonetheless, it has recruited new dealers for the purpose of depriving its
closest competitors of effective distribution. For example, Dentsply initially
turned down several requests from Jan Dental, which wanted to sell Trubyte
teeth, because Dentsply felt it had sufficient distribution and had concerns that
Jan Dental posed a credit risk and ran a "pretty loose operation." (Hagler,
B-1678-80; B-253-54; Brennan (DS), B-1473). But then in October 1992, Dentsply
agreed to sell teeth to Jan Dental in exchange for its agreement to drop Vita and
other lines. (B-250-52; Mazz (Schein), B-1907).
The agreement was beneficial to Dentsply because it "eliminate[d] several
competitors."  (B-250).<a href="#N26"><sup>26</sup></a>

<p>Likewise, Dentsply began selling Trubyte teeth to Darby Dental to prevent
it from selling Vita teeth. In June 1994, Dentsply turned down Darby's request to
sell Trubyte teeth, stating that it had adequate distribution in Darby's area.
(B-258). Subsequently, Vident asked Darby's Sidney Nordhauser to sell Vita teeth.
(Nordhauser (Darby), B-1993-94). When Nordhauser told his Dentsply
representative, who was visiting his office, of his interest in Vita, "she said 'Wait
a minute,' and she got on the phone right there and then... and she said, 'Don't do
anything, we will see you next week.'" (<u>Id.</u>, B-1995-96). Shortly thereafter,
Dentsply authorized Darby as a Trubyte tooth dealer upon Darby's agreement
not to add the Vita tooth line. (B-224; Nordhauser (Darby), B-1998-2000).
Internally, the "key issue" for Dentsply in recognizing Darby was that Vita was
"having a tough time getting teeth out to customers" and that one of Vita's "key
weaknesses [was] their distribution system." (B-249).<a href="#N27"><sup>27</sup></a>

<p><a name="12"></a><ol><ol><ol start="2"><strong><li>Dentsply has maintained its monopoly through exclusionary and
anticompetitive means.</li></strong></ol></ol></ol>

<p>A monopolist may not engage in conduct "to foreclose competition, to gain a
competitive advantage, or to destroy a competitor." <u>Kodak</u>, 504 U.S. at 482-83 (quoting
<u>United States v. Griffith</u>, 334 U.S. 100, 107 (1948)). Moreover, "[w]here a defendant
maintains substantial market power, his activities are examined through a special lens:
Behavior that might otherwise not be of concern to the antitrust laws -- or that might
even be viewed as procompetitive -- can take on exclusionary connotations when
practiced by a monopolist." <u>Kodak</u>, 504 U.S. at 488 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (citing 3 P.
Areeda &amp; D. Turner, <u>Antitrust Law</u> &#182; 813, at 300-02 (1978)).<a href="#N28"><sup>28</sup></a> Instead of competing "on
the merits" by allowing dealers selling Trubyte teeth to decide for themselves whether
to complement their product offerings, Dentsply excludes its closest rivals from dealers
and maintains its monopoly power.

<p>Dentsply's exclusionary conduct has caused numerous anticompetitive effects.
First, it has restricted the availability of teeth that consumers want to buy, thereby
keeping its own market share artificially high. Dentsply concedes that in the absence of
Dealer Criterion 6, some of its dealers would take on rival tooth lines and it would lose
market share.<a href="#N29"><sup>29</sup></a> Given the number of dealers it has pressured since 1987, this market share
loss likely would be significant. Indeed, in
seeking a declaratory judgment against the United States on these same issues in
December 1998, Dentsply alleged rival tooth lines could displace an "enormous" amount
of Trubyte teeth in its dealerships if it were forced to surrender Dealer Criterion 6.<a href="#N30"><sup>30</sup></a>

<p>Second, Dentsply's conduct has caused tooth prices to remain artificially high.
Based on the survey of dental laboratories conducted by Professor Jerry Wind of the
Wharton School of Business, Dr. David Reitman has estimated that without Dealer
Criterion 6, the average price for premium artificial teeth would fall in the short term by
5%-20%. (Reitman Rept., B-1078, 1080). Dr. Reitman's opinion is supported not only by
his analysis of data from Professor Wind's survey but by other evidence demonstrating
that Dentsply is currently insulated from vigorous price competition. <b>[REDACTED]</b>
; <u>see</u> <u>also</u> Reitman Rept., B-1060
(Dentsply's share stable for at least a decade)). In the absence of Dealer Criterion 6, the
market would become more responsive to price differences among products as "demand
elasticity" increases. (Reitman Rept., B-1078).<a href="#N32"><sup>32</sup></a>

<p>Third, for many years Dentsply restricted the availability of Vita and Ivoclar's
aesthetically superior teeth, causing many consumers to receive aesthetically inferior
denture teeth. (<u>See</u> pp.
10-11). Given Vita's aesthetic superiority during this period, it is not surprising that labs
wanted to buy Vita teeth from their dealers. (<u>E.g.</u>, Harris (Atlanta), B-1737-38, 1744-45;
Vetrano (DLDS), B-2238). But because Dentsply successfully excluded Vita and others
from dealers, labs kept buying Trubyte teeth. (B-548 ("Vita's denture case share (brand
share) is low"); B-259 (labs converted Vita shades 72% of the time)). This was a
substantial consumer harm, given how long the problem lasted and the importance of
aesthetics and shading.

<p>Fourth, Dentsply has caused dealers selling Trubyte teeth to be less efficient than
they would have been without Dealer Criterion 6. Several dealers have attempted to add
rival lines of teeth and, if they had done so, they would have achieved greater economies
of scale as their fixed costs were spread over more units of sales. (Reitman Rept., B-1081;
<u>see</u> <u>also</u> <u>id.</u>, B-1056-57, 1080-82 (other adverse effects include higher entry barriers and
lower marketing expenditures)).

or &#167;3 of the Clayton Act</li></strong></ol>

<p>Dentsply argues that the Section 1 and 3 counts should be dismissed because there
is no genuine issue of material fact that: (1) it does not have "agreements" with dealers
(DS Mem. at 30-32); (2) any agreements are terminable at will, and thus dealers are "free
to walk away" at any time (<u>id.</u> at 32-34); and (3) there is no foreclosure because its rivals
are free to sell teeth to other "dental dealers" (who do not sell teeth) or directly to labs
themselves (<u>id.</u> at 26-30). Dentsply misstates the law and ignores the factual record on
each issue.<a href="#N33"><sup>33</sup></a>

<p><a name="14"></a><ol><ol type="A"><b><li>Dentsply has coerced independent tooth dealers to agree not to sell

<p>Both Dentsply and its dealers consider Dealer Criterion 6 to be an agreement
between them. Christopher Clark, general manager of the Trubyte Division from 1996
to 1999, testified that Dealer Criterion 6 is "an understanding" between Dentsply and its
dealers. (Clark (DS), B-1571). An internal Dentsply document stated that "[d]ealers, being
considered partners in selling
the Divisions products, <u>agree</u> to the stipulations of the DEALER CRITERIA ...." (B-219). In
the late 1980's, when Norman Weinstock of Zahn Dental considered adding Ivoclar teeth,
Dentsply called him and told him "of an agreement that [Zahn] had with Dentsply that
we couldn't take on a premium line of teeth." (Weinstock (Zahn), B-2260-61; <u>see</u> <u>also</u> <u>id.</u>, at B-2270 ("That's what they told us, that we have an agreement")).<a href="#N34"><sup>34</sup></a>

<p>A written contract signed by both Dentsply and its dealers is not required; even
under <u>Un ited States v. Colgate &amp; Co.</u>, 250 U.S. 300 (1919), and its progeny, an agreement
may be inferred from a course of dealing and other circumstances.<a href="#N35"><sup>35</sup></a> <u>Roland Machinery
Co. v. Dresner Indus., Inc.</u>. 749 F.2d 380, 392 (7th Cir. 1984). An agreement exists "[w]hen
[a] manufacturer's
actions ... go beyond mere announcement of his policy and the simple refusal to deal,
and he employs other means which effect adherence..." <u>United States v. Parke Davis &amp; Co.</u>, 362 U.S. 29,44 (1960). An announced policy, accompanied by threats of termination,
active surveillance, and reinstatement conditioned on assurances of future compliance,
is sufficient. <u>Yentsch v. Texaco, Inc.</u>, 630 F.2d 46, 52 (2d Cir. 1980); <u>Baker's Carpet
Gallery, Inc v. Mohawk Indus.</u>, 942 F. Supp. 1464, 1477-79 (N.D. Ga. 1996)(summary
judgment denied; agreement found where threats of termination made while dealer "on
hold").

<p>Dentsply has gone beyond a mere announcement of a policy by actively
monitoring<a href="#N36"><sup>36</sup></a> and coercing compliance, and seeking and obtaining assurances of
continued compliance, with Dealer Criterion 6. When it has found violators, it has not
terminated them immediately but given them a chance to "comply, explain, [or] discuss"
the situation. (Brennan (DS), B-1495-96).<a href="#N37"><sup>37</sup></a> And <b>[REDACTED]</b>


Dentsply has induced several dealers expressly to agree not to sell competitive teeth.<a href="#N38"><sup>38</sup></a>
<b>[REDACTED]</b><a href="#N39"><sup>39</sup></a>

<p>The Frink incident in 1987 was the one time Dentsply failed initially to persuade
a dealer not to add a competitive line of teeth. Despite Dentsply's effort to talk Frink's
owner Tom Cavanaugh out of adding Ivoclar teeth, he began selling them. (Cavanaugh
(Frink), B-l 540-50)). So Dentsply went a step further. Through some "detective work," it
identified the dealers that were secretly supplying Cavanaugh with Trubyte teeth, met
with them, and threatened to "take away the[ir] dealership" if they didn't stop.<a href="#N40"><sup>40</sup></a> Then
Dentsply's representatives from <u>other</u> divisions started telling Cavanaugh that Dentsply
was "very unhappy" with him, and he began to worry about losing those other product
lines as well. (<u>Id.</u>, B-l548-53). Finally, Cavanaugh relented and agreed to drop the Ivoclar
line. (<u>Id.</u>, B-l555-57. As a result, he was promptly reinstated. <u>Id.</u>; Borgelt (DS), B-1461-62;
Brennan (DS), B-1470-72).

<p>This evidence is more than enough to demonstrate agreement between
Dentsply and dealers selling Trubyte teeth.<a href="#N41"><sup>41</sup></a> In the cases cited by Dentsply, the
defendants had not sought their dealers' agreements through coercive tactics,
<u>Roland Machinery</u>, 749 F.2d at 393 (no evidence that defendant used "stick that
forced dealers into a tacit understanding"); <u>Acton v. Merle Norman Cosmetics,
Inc.</u> 1995-1 Trade Cas. (CCH) &#182; 71,025 at 74,815-18 (CD. Cal. May 16, 1995) (no

<p><a name="15"></a><ol><ol type="A" start="2"><b><li>Dentsply's exclusive dealing agreements have unreasonably

<p>Exclusive dealing agreements are evaluated under the rule of reason. The
lawfulness of any particular exclusive dealing agreement depends not on
mechanical measures or formulas, but on a careful investigation of all of the facts
in the case. The ultimate question is whether the arrangement is "'unreasonable,'
i.e., whether its anticompetitive effects outweigh its procompetitive effects,"
<u>Atlantic Richfield Co. v. USA Petroleum Co.</u>, 495 U.S. 328, 342 &amp; n. 12 (1990), and
thus "whether the challenged agreement is one that promotes competition or one
that suppresses competition." <u>National Soc'y of Prof'l Eng'rs v. United States</u>, 435
U.S. 679, 691 (1978).

<p>Analysis of an exclusive dealing agreement examines "probable" or "likely"
anticompetitive effects. <u>Tampa Electric Co. v. Nashville Coal Co.</u>,   365 U.S. 320, 327
(1961); <u>Barry Wright</u>, 724 F.2d at 327. Exclusive dealing agreements violate the antitrust laws if they "<u>tend[]</u> to
'foreclose' existing competitors or new entrants." <u>Gilbarco</u>, 127 F.3d at 1162. Specific
factors, such as duration of contracts or percentages of market foreclosure, are sometimes
useful guides for predicting the likely effects of an exclusive dealing arrangement, but
neither alone is dispositive.<a href="#N43"><sup>43</sup></a> Moreover, harm to competition and consumers can result
not only from the elimination of a rival through complete foreclosure, but also from the
imposition of added costs that impair the ability of rivals to lower price or innovate to
improve their products. <u>See</u> T. Krattenmaker &amp; S. Salop, "Anticompetitive Exclusion:
Raising Rivals' Costs to Achieve Power over Price," 96 Yale L.J. 209, 214 (1986). Thus, the
Court needs to "evaluate the restrictiveness and the economic usefulness of the
challenged practice in relation to the business factors extant in the market." <u>Id.</u> (quoting
<u>American Motor Inns, Inc. v. Holiday Inns, Inc.</u>, 521 F.2d 1230, 1251-52 n.75 (3d Cir.
1975)).

<p>There is overwhelming evidence that Dentsply's exclusive dealing agreements
have harmed competition. This evidence, summarized above, which must be accepted as
true for purposes of Dentsply's summary judgment motion, demonstrates that Dentsply's
exclusive dealing agreements have persistently foreclosed its rivals from the market. As
a result, Dentsply has maintained its monopoly market share, increased prices, lowered
the quality of teeth available to denture wearers, and deterred entry. (<u>See</u> pp. 15-17).

<p><a name="16"></a><ol><ol><ol><b><li>Dentsply's agreements with dealers selling Trubyte teeth are, as a
practical matter, self-perpetuating.</li></b></ol></ol></ol>

<p>Dentsply's argument that at-will agreements are lawful per se was raised and rejected
in <u>3M v. Appleton Papers, Inc.</u>, 35 F. Supp.2d 1138 (D. Minn. 1999). In that case, Appleton had
a 67% share of the carbonless paper sheet market. 3M sued Appleton, alleging that its
exclusive dealing agreement with paper merchants blocked the avenues of distribution.
<u>Id.</u> at 1140. Appleton moved for summary judgment, arguing, among other things, that
its agreements were terminable at will and that 3M and other rivals were free to convert
its distributors at any time. <u>Id.</u> at 1144. The court disagreed:

<p><blockquote>[T]here are genuine issues of fact as to whether Appleton's agreements are
actually terminable at will. ... 3M has produced evidence that Appleton's
sole-sourcing agreements often include incentives that have the practical
effect of tying up the paper sheet inventory of a merchant over a period of
several years. . . . Further, 3M asserts that Appleton's high market share
and the deeply rooted customer preference for [Appleton's] brand of paper
prevent merchants from surrendering Appleton as a supplier, which they
must do under these agreements if they desire to distribute non-Appleton
brands. <u>Id.</u><a href="#N44"><sup>44</sup></a></blockquote>

<p>The same holds true in this case. Dentsply's agreements do not, as a technical
matter, include a stated duration. But they are, as a practical matter, self-perpetuating.
Dealer Criterion 6 presents Dentsply's tooth dealers with an all-or-nothing choice: if they
add a rival's tooth line, they lose all of their Trubyte teeth. Given Dentsply's monopoly
market share, no dealer is willing to "walk away" from its substantial Trubyte tooth sales
to take on a competitive line of teeth. Indeed, the United States is not aware of <u>any</u> dealer
that has given up its Trubyte tooth business
to take on a rival tooth line. For example, Zahn Dental decided not to add Ivoclar teeth,
which could have brought an additional $800,000 in sales, because it would have lost $10
million in Dentsply business. (Weinstock (Zahn), B-2262-63). DLDS gave up Vita and
Universal because it "couldn't operate without the Trubyte line." (Vetrano (DLDS),
B-2230-31). When put to a choice between Dentsply and Vita, Pearson Dental chose
Dentsply because it was "doing a tremendous amount of business" with it. (Kashfian
(Pearson), B-1828). DTS wanted Dentsply's business "at almost any conditions." (Raths
(DTS), B-2034-35). And Betsy Harris of Atlanta Dental Supply decided not to sell Vita to
"protect [her] business" and avoid "losing a million dollars a year business." (Harris
(Atlanta), B-1751-56). Ms. Harris testified, "I wished that I was brave enough to do it
because the only person that's ever called [Dentsply's] bluff was Mr. Cavanaugh [of Frink
Dental]. . .." <u>Id.</u> B-1751).<a href="#N45"><sup>45</sup></a>

<p>Even Mr. Cavanaugh's decision to start selling Ivoclar in 1987 illustrates that
dealers cannot freely "walk away" from the Trubyte business. Cavanaugh took on the
Ivoclar line because he thought Dentsply's threats <u>were</u> a bluff. (Cavanaugh (Frink),
B-1540). When he was terminated, Cavanaugh continued selling Ivoclar only because
other dealers were supplying him with Trubyte teeth. <u>Id.</u>, B-l 545-48). When Dentsply
closed off that supply, Cavanaugh had to choose between Dentsply and Ivoclar, and he
returned to Dentsply. (<u>Id.</u>, B-l547-55).

<p>No case has held that exclusive dealing agreements of short duration are lawful
without regard to their effect on competition. The cases cited by Dentsply considered
duration as only one
factor in assessing the legality of the agreements, and in each case the court noted
that the defendant lacked market power and the agreements did not restrict
competition.<a href="#N46"><sup>46</sup></a> For example, <u>Paddocx Publications, Inc. v. Chicago Tribune Co.</u>,
103 F.3d 42 (7th Or. 1996), involved exclusive distributorships, not exclusive
dealing, <u>see</u> <u>id.</u> at 46 (describing difference), and the court emphasized that the
plaintiff newspaper was not foreclosed from "hundreds, if not thousands of
opinion and entertainment features." <u>Id.</u> at 44. In <u>Concord Boat Corp. v.
Brunswick Corp.</u>, 2000 WL 303035 (8th Cir. Mar. 24, 2000), plaintiffs failed to
prove that defendant's program had excluded competitors, given evidence of
significant market share shifts when defendant's rivals lowered prices. <u>Id.</u> at *1,
*17. And in <u>Roland Machinery</u>, defendant's market share of only 16%-17% made
the lack of market power obvious and plaintiff had made "very little effort" to
show that any competitor had been hindered or that prices were higher because
of defendant's conduct. 749 F.2d at 382, 394. The court's oft-quoted dicta<a href="#N47"><sup>47</sup></a> that
agreements of less than a year are "presumptively lawful" cited no cases and was
merely one of many reasons plaintiff had failed to prove its &#167; 3 claim. Even if this
Court relies on that dicta and applies such a presumption, the facts here are more
than sufficient to overcome it.<a href="#N48"><sup>48</sup></a>

<p>By any measure, Dentsply has foreclosed Vita and Ivoclar, and, to a lesser extent,
its other competitors, from a large majority of the market. In <u>Omega Environmental, Inc.
v. Gilbarco Inc.</u>, 127 F.3d 1157 (9th Cir. 1997), a case on which Dentsply relies heavily, the
Ninth Circuit held that foreclosure was properly defined as the percentage of the
defendant's market share sold through its distributors. <u>Id.</u> at 1162. Under that method,
Vita and Ivoclar are foreclosed from 70%-80% of the market.<a href="#N49"><sup>49</sup></a>

<p>Foreclosure could also be defined as the percentage of dealer outlets (or their tooth
stocks) foreclosed to Dentsply's rivals. <u>See</u> <u>Stitt Spark Plug Co. v. Champion Spark Plug
Co.</u>, 840 F.2d 1253, 1258 (5th Cir. 1988) (foreclosure referred to as "comparison between
the number of distribution outlets available and the number of those foreclosed"). That
is a particularly appropriate way to measure foreclosure where, as here, direct sales of
teeth are an inadequate
substitute for sales to tooth dealers. (<u>See</u> pp. 31-35).<a href="#N50"><sup>50</sup></a> Vita and Ivoclar have been
foreclosed from 86.9% and 87.3%, respectively, of the outlets operated by tooth
dealers. (B-04). The foreclosure rates for American Tooth (78.7%), Austenal
(81.3%), and Universal (67.4%) are high as well. <u>Id.</u><a href="#N51"><sup>51</sup></a> Given that some dealers do
not stock teeth at all of their locations <b>[REDACTED]</b>, foreclosure may also be measured as the percentage of dealer tooth stock
locations from which Dentsply's competitors are foreclosed. These numbers are
also high: Ivoclar (79.1%); Vita (78.3%); American Tooth (67.4%); Austenal
(69.8.%); and Universal (59.7%). <u>Id.</u> (also measuring foreclosure from outlets
operated by dealers that sell products other than teeth to labs).


<p>The foreclosure rates in this case far exceed those that have been found
sufficient to support a violation.<a href="#N52"><sup>52</sup></a> In <u>American Motor Inns</u>, the Third Circuit
analyzed an exclusive dealing arrangement that Holiday Inns imposed upon its
franchisees. Because Holiday Inns constituted the largest hotel group in the
country, and was three times larger than its largest competitor, the court stated
that a foreclosure rate of only 14.7% might well have been sufficient to find
liability under Section 3 of the Clayton Act. 521 F.2d at 1252.<a href="#N53"><sup>53</sup></a> Here, the
foreclosure rates are not only far higher, but Dentsply's market share dwarfs those
of its closest rivals. (Facts &#182; 3). By contrast, in the cases cited by Dentsply in
which the foreclosure rate was even mentioned, the rates were lower, and in most
cases far lower, than 80%. <u>See</u> n. 2 (foreclosure rates of 15%, 25%, 38%, and
65%).

<p>As the Eighth Circuit stated in <u>Ryko</u>, "[w]here the degree of foreclosure
caused by the exclusivity provisions is so great that it invariably indicates that the
supplier imposing the provisions has substantial market power, we may rely on
the foreclosure rate alone to establish the violation." 823 F.2d at 1233.<a href="#N54"><sup>54</sup></a> The high
foreclosure rates here corroborate the evidence of Dentsply's substantial market
power, (<u>see</u> pp. 7-11), and together these facts are more than sufficient to defeat
its motion for summary judgment.<a href="#N55"><sup>55</sup></a>

foreclosure analysis.</li></b></ol></ol></ol></ol>

<p>The foreclosure percentages asserted by Dentsply (DS Mem. at 26, 29) are lower
because it includes dealers that do not sell teeth -- and have no interest in doing so -- in the
universe of dealers "available" to its artificial tooth competitors. Dentsply has failed to
show that these additional dental dealers, called "operatory" dealers because they sell
various merchandise and equipment to dentist office operatories (not to labs, which
purchase teeth), would be willing to enter into the entirely new business of selling teeth
to labs -- in other words, could "readily" and "easily" compete. <u>Gilbarco</u>, 127 F.3d at 1162,
quoting 2A P. Areeda, et al., <u>Antitrust Law</u> &#182; 570b 1 at 278 (1995). In fact, the record
shows just the opposite.<a href="#N56"><sup>56</sup></a> <b>[REDACTED]</b>

Dental lab dealers sell artificial teeth
and other products (<u>e.g.</u>, acrylics, waxes, and gypsums) to dental laboratories. (<u>E.g.</u>,
B-779). Operatory dealers sell impression materials, dental chairs, x-ray units,
handpieces, and other
merchandise and equipment primarily to dentists.<a href="#N57"><sup>57</sup></a> One Dentsply regional
manager testified that he does not know of any operatory dealers who do not
carry teeth that might be candidates to sell teeth. (Gosney(DS),B-1666).

<b>[REDACTED]</b> The "general view" at Dentsply has been that very few
dealers who do not sell teeth are interested in selling teeth. (Crane (DS),
B-1615-17). Indeed, every operatory dealer deposed during this case testified that
it has no interest in selling teeth.<a href="#N58"><sup>58</sup></a>

<p>Dentsply has touted Becker-Parkin and Sullivan Dental Products as
operatory dealers that
<p>could serve as potential "significant distribution outlet[s]" for the
distribution of competitors'
artificial teeth. (Miles (DS), B-1952-54 <b>[REDACTED]</b>).<a href="#N59"><sup>59</sup></a> But Becker-Parkin doesn't sell teeth
and is "very leery about doing lab business." (Salzman (Becker-Parkin), B-2095). As its
president testified, "I think there is the dental supply industry, then there is the
dental laboratory industry and we are into the dental supply industry." (<u>Id.</u>,
B-2099). Similarly, despite several attempts by Dentsply itself to persuade Sullivan
to sell Trubyte teeth, Kevin Ackeret of Sullivan testified that
it was not considering entering the market. (Ackeret (Sullivan), B-1445-46). In
order to sell teeth effectively, Sullivan would need to start selling other lab
products (such as gypsums and porcelains) as well. Like other operatory, dealers,
Mr. Ackeret felt that Sullivan did not have the time or the expertise to add teeth
to its inventory. (<u>Id.</u>, B-1440-44). Even Chris Clark, then Trubyte General Manager,
testified in 1996 that Sullivan has not "been overly interested in getting into the
tooth business . . ." (Clark (DS), B-1589-90). Operatory dealers that do not sell
teeth, and particularly those that have declined an offer from the largest tooth
manufacturer to enter the market, should not be considered available dealers for
Dentsply's much smaller rivals. <u>FTC v. Cardinal Health, Inc.</u> 12 F. Supp.2d 34,
57(D.D.C. 1998) (entry into pharmaceutical distribution market by suppliers of
other medical and surgical products "theoretical at best" in light of recent rejection
of offer to enter).<a href="#N60"><sup>60</sup></a>

<p><a name="20"></a><ol><ol><ol><ol type="a" start="3"><strong><li>Direct sales are not an adequate substitute for sales
to independent tooth dealers.</li></strong></ol></ol></ol></ol>

<p>Dentsply contends it should prevail merely because Vita and Ivoclar make
some direct sales and thus have not been completely foreclosed from the market.
Yet the law does not require complete foreclosure, only foreclosure of "a
substantial share of the line of commerce affected." <u>Tampa Electric</u>, 365 U.S. at 327.
<u>See</u> <u>also</u> <u>Barr Labs</u>, 978 F.2d at 110.<a href="#N61"><sup>61</sup></a> Were it otherwise, a
plaintiff would have to prove a foreclosure rate of 100% in order to prevail under
Sections 1 and 3. The existence of alternative channels of distribution is relevant where
those channels are adequate to enable rivals to compete effectively. <u>E.g.</u>, <u>CDC
Technologies</u>, 186 F.3d at 80-81 (plaintiff's sales increased by "successfully" reaching
customers through alternatives); <u>Ryko</u>, 823 F.2d at 1234 (no evidence that exclusive
dealing prevented competitors from finding "effective" distributors or other means of
promoting and selling products); <u>Roland Machinery</u> 749 F.2d at 394 (Komatsu, the
competitor, became "a major factor in the U.S. market, apparently in a short period
of time").<a href="#N62"><sup>62</sup></a>

<p>In this case, direct distribution has not been successful. "It's much more expensive
to sell direct than it is through the dealer network." (Hagler, B-1685). A manufacturer
must absorb the cost of all the services dealers provide for them: "the cost of inventory,
the cost of sales force, of distribution of product and carrying the receivable for the
customer." (Wiltz (Patterson), B-2277).

<b>[REDACTED]</b>


And
it would need to set up local tooth stocks around the country. "[I]f we were a
direct company, we would have to have multiple buildings around the United
States to house teeth. We couldn't do it out of York. We would have to hire all
new people. We would have major expense. Why wreck a good thing?"   
(Kirchheimer (DS), B-l 878-79).<a href="#N64"><sup>64</sup></a> <b>[REDACTED]</b>

<p>For a variety of reasons, labs often prefer to buy teeth from a local dealer.
(Facts &#182; 6). Dentsply concedes that "most of [their] dealers ... are local dealers
serving a rather local area," (Clark (DS), B-1585), and that having Dentsply teeth
"readily available" to labs "makes it more convenient for the laboratory and
ultimately the dentist to get the right teeth, the right shape, the right size, the right
color quickly to fulfill any denture case." (Turner (DS), B-2205). Delivery
from a direct selling manufacturer is more expensive and often takes longer.<a href="#N66"><sup>66</sup></a>
Immediate availability is particularly important in emergency cases requiring
same-day service, (Facts &#182; 6), as Dentsply itself recognized when opening a new
dealer in Miami that was located very close to an existing dealer. (B-262-63
("customers in the Miami area need a local presence to be able to drive over and
pick up teeth in rapid turnaround situations")). Same-day pick up or delivery can
constitute a significant percentage of a dealer's business.<a href="#N67"><sup>67</sup></a>

<p>Dealers also offer their labs the benefit of one-stop shopping, something that
a direct-selling manufacturer could not offer <u>even</u> if it set up numerous tooth
stocks nationwide. (Facts &#182; 6). Dealers agree: "most customers prefer being able to
get as many products if not all of their products from one supplier..." (Weinstock
(Zahn), B-2266; <u>see</u> <u>also</u> Nordhauser (Darby), B-1978-82; Kashfian (Pearson),
B-1859-63; Ryan (Sonshine Dental Lab), B-2091-93 ("I would like to have a choice
of all the brands that are available").

<p>Labs develop loyalty to their local dealer because personal representation
is important to the sale of teeth to labs. (Miles (DS), B-1945-46). This "is an age-old
industry and the relationships have been built over the years on personal delivery
by dental supply personnel to laboratories within reach via car or truck." (Turner
(DS), B-2205-06). <b>[REDACTED]</b>





<p>It is not surprising, therefore, that Dentsply's rivals have fared so poorly in the
market
despite years of trying. As	<b>[REDACTED]</b> its major competitors have testified, direct distribution
is a poor
alternative to a national dealer network.<a href="#N68"><sup>68</sup></a> <b>[REDACTED]</b>

<p><a name="21"></a><ol><ol><ol start="3"><b><li>Dentsply's agreements have caused substantial
anticompetitive effects.</li></b></ol></ol></ol>

<p>By foreclosing such a substantial share of the market, Dentsply's exclusive dealing
agreements have caused numerous anticompetitive effects. It has kept prices too high,
quality too low, and raised barriers to entry, (<u>See</u> pp. 15-17). Even if Dentsply had offered
evidence to support its procompetitive justifications, these adverse effects are more than
sufficient to raise a genuine fact issue about whether its agreements are, on balance
"'unreasonable,' i.e., whether
[their] anticompetitive effects outweigh [their] procompetitive effects." <u>Atlantic
Richfield Co.</u> , 495 U.S. at 342 &amp; n. 12.

<p><a name="22"></a><ol type="I" start="3"><b><li>Dentsply is not entitled to summary judgment based on its unsupported
"business justifications."</li></b></ol>

<p>Dentsply contends that it is entitled to summary judgment merely because
it engages in promotional marketing activity that increases demand for its teeth.
DS Mem. at 34-37.<a href="#N69"><sup>69</sup></a> Dentsply cites no cases supporting this astoundingly bold
assertion. To the contrary, to prevail as a matter of law, Dentsply must show not
only that its exclusive dealing agreements have procompetitive benefits, but also
that those benefits are valid and sufficient in light of the evidence of substantial
foreclosure and adverse effects.

<p>Dentsply simply cannot prevail by making theoretical and unqualified
"business justifications"; instead, Dentsply must prove that there are no disputed
material facts regarding the validity and sufficiency of those justifications.<a href="#N70"><sup>70</sup></a> The
United States is not aware of any case, and Dentsply has cited none, holding that
a monopolist that had foreclosed 80% of the market was entitled to judgment as
a matter of law based on its asserted procompetitive justifications.<a href="#N71"><sup>71</sup></a>


<p>Where it is apparent that the defendant's asserted justifications are pretextual,
summary judgment should be denied. <u>Alvord-Polk, Inc. v. F. Schumacher &amp; Co.</u>, 37 F.3d
996, 1010-13 (3d Cir. 1994). That is the case here, where the evidence "makes it less likely
that the free rider problem was really uppermost in the minds of defendants' executives."
<u>Brokers' Assistant, Inc. v. Williams Real Estate Co.</u>, 646 F. Supp. 1110, 1120 n.38 (S.D.N.Y.
1986).<a href="#N72"><sup>72</sup></a> Here, there is more than sufficient evidence to raise a genuine issue that what was
"uppermost" in the minds of Dentsply's executives was not free riding, but an intent to
"block competitive distribution points" and prevent its closest competitors from gaining
a "foothold" in the U.S. market. (<u>See</u> pp. 12-14).<a href="#N73"><sup>73</sup></a>

<p>Moreover, Dentsply has not met its burden of offering evidence to support its
justifications. Dentsply has not shown there is no genuine fact issue that in the
absence of Dealer
Criterion 6, free riding would occur and Dentsply would reduce its
demand-creating promotional
expenditures. Fourteen dealers selling Trubyte teeth today,	<b>[REDACTED]</b> already sell some
of the "grandfathered" competitive lines (such as Austenal and American Tooth
brands). (DS
Mem. at 19; <b>[REDACTED]</b>.<a href="#N74"><sup>74</sup></a> Yet Dentsply has not offered evidence that it has
been


unable to promote its teeth effectively through these dealers. It also has not
offered evidence that non-exclusive dealers today actively convert their Trubyte
tooth customers over to less expensive brands, and there is substantial evidence
to the contrary. Zahn Dental is a large, non-exclusive dealer selling not only
Trubyte teeth but the Myerson, Kenson, Universal, Justi, Dentorium, and
Accutone brands as well. (Weinstock (Zahn), B-2256). Despite its broad product
line, Zahn considers itself "neutral" and strives first and foremost to meet the
needs of its customers, not to sell one product over another. (<u>Id.</u>, B-2267).<a href="#N75"><sup>75</sup></a> As one
of Dentsply's own high-level executives frankly admitted, there is no incentive for
dealers to switch customers from one brand to another, and "there's a huge risk
in doing so ... ." (Crane (DS), B-1613. <u>See</u> <u>also</u> Reitman Rebuttal Rept., B-1114
(evidence that dealers could or would switch customers "weak, at best")).

<p>Indeed, Dentsply continues to treat its non-exclusive and exclusive
dealers equally, in the amount of training it provides and otherwise.<a href="#N76"><sup>76</sup></a>
<b>[REDACTED]</b>

<p>Moreover, the real issue is not whether Dentsply's <u>own</u> promotional efforts might
decrease, but rather the effect on promotional efforts <u>industrywide</u>. (Reitman Rebuttal
Rept., B-1059). If Dentsply's rivals are given greater access to dealers, promotional
Spending is likely to increase, not decrease. For example, when Frink Dental sold Ivoclar
teeth for six months, Ivoclar trained Frink's entire sales force. (Cavanaugh (Frink),
B-1522-23). The training it offered was equal to Dentsply's training, and Ivoclar's samples
and other materials were better. <u>Id.</u> at 93. Similarly, Zuckerman Dental, a small dealer
selling Vita teeth, testified that Vident is "supportive with information if I need it, and
[has] a tremendous marketing group and support group . . .," and that it has provided
marketing materials for distribution to customers. (Zuckerman (Zuckerman Dental),
B-2313-16). Even without access to dealers today, Ivoclar and Vita also call upon dentists
and labs and provide many of the same types of promotion and training services as
Dentsply.<a href="#N77"><sup>77</sup></a> With a dealer network, these rivals would increase their expenditures even
more. (Reitman Rept., B-1080-81).

<p>In short, Dentsply has not met its burden of showing there are no disputed factual
issues regarding its alleged business justifications. Even if these justifications are not
pretextual, they are unsupported by the facts. And even if they have some factual
support, they fall far short of outweighing the significant adverse effects of Dentsply's
exclusive dealing agreements or justifying such substantial foreclosure.

In addition, in 1995, Dentsply forced <u>Darby Dental</u> to agree not to add the Vita line, B-224, and to discontinue (within three months of Portrait's introduction) the sale of Odipal teeth, a "higher priced quality" tooth in Vita shades made by a Spanish
company. B-223; Nordhauser (Darby), B-1990-92, 2003-04. Darby was interested in selling
Odipal because of the demand for Vita-shaded teeth. B-223; Nordhauser (Darby), B-1990-91. Because
of its agreement with Dentsply, Darby cancelled its initial order for Odipal teeth. Nordhauser
(Darby), B-2001-02. Odipal "sell[s] all over the world ... but not in this country." <u>Id.</u>, B-1992.

<p><a name="N23"></a><sup>23	</sup>Dentsply's introduction of the Portrait line does not mean it lacks monopoly
power, particularly given its lengthy delay in doing so.   A firm may possess monopoly power in
an industry notwithstanding that innovation has occurred. <u>See</u>, <u>e.g.</u>, <u>United States v.
Microsoft Corp.</u>, 87 F. Supp.2d 30, 37 (D.D.C. 2000)("neither Microsoft's efforts at technical
innovation nor its pricing behavior is inconsistent with the possession of monopoly power") (citing 84 F.
Supp.2d at 26-28 (Findings of Fact &#182;&#182; 61-66)). Moreover, there is some evidence that the Portrait
line did not completely solve Dentsply's problem. Ryan (Sonshine Dental Lab), B-2085-87.
Nevertheless, labs continue to opt to use Dentsply teeth, and forego using Vita, simply because
they are available from dealers. <u>Id.</u>, Harris (Atlanta), B-1762-63.

<p><a name="N24"></a><sup>24	</sup>Borgelt viewed Ivoclar as a formidable competitor in Europe at the time and
feared that Dentsply would lose market share to Ivoclar if Frink started selling the Ivoclar
line. Borgelt (DS), B-1457, 1459-60.

<p><a name="N25"></a><sup>25	</sup>According to Hagler, who was tasked, in part, "to keep competitive lines of
teeth out of the distributors" (Hagler, B-1670), "[t]here was only one purpose for this policy,
and that's to dominate the tooth market and ... get as much market share as you can." <u>Id.</u>,
B-1671. After Dentsply fired Hagler in 1993, he was employed by Universal (<u>id.</u>,
B-1668-69, 1684).

<p><a name="N26"></a><sup>26	</sup>Dentsply's subsequent actions are also telling. After Dentsply drove Vita
teeth from Jan Dental, Vident turned to Trinity Dental, another Chicago-area dealer selling Trubyte
merchandise, but not teeth. Morgano (Trinity), B-1959-60; Brennan (DS), 1474. When Trinity Dental
added Vita, Dentsply terminated it as a merchandise dealer.	<b>[REDACTED]</b> Dentsply's "free
riding" defense cannot justify this retaliatory action, given that Trinity did not sell
Trubyte teeth. Even Dentsply executives agree Dealer Criterion 6 should not be interpreted to
prohibit merchandise-only dealers from adding a competitor's teeth. <b>[REDACTED]</b> ; Brennan
(DS), B-1489-93.

<p><a name="N27"></a><sup>27	</sup><u>See</u> <u>also</u> Raths (DTS), B-2072-73 &amp; B-269 ("significant reason" for selling teeth to DTS, despite earlier position that DTS would never get the Dentsply line, was
"eliminat[ing] Vita and Ivoclar competition in Kansas City and the surrounding areas"). Dentsply's
targeting of its closest rivals is also clear from its allowing dealers such as Jan Dental to keep teeth
sold by Universal, a far weaker competitor, while requiring it to drop Vita (B-250-52), and
permitting dealers such Pearson Dental to add a competitor's economy teeth. Kashfian (Pearson),
B-1821-26.  This specific targeting of Vita and Ivoclar violates the principle, espoused by
Dentsply's general counsel in his compliance manual that refusals to deal with customers "must
not be a part of a scheme to monopolize a market,... or to handle or not handle a particular
product or brand, or otherwise to intrude on the customer's independence in the conduct of its business." B.
Addison, "Antitrust Compliance Programs." B-771.

<p><a name="N28"></a><sup>28	</sup>The material fact issues precluding summary judgment under Sections 1 and 3 also provide a basis for denying Dentsply's motion to dismiss the Section 2 count. A monopolist
violates Section 2 if it "maintain[s] monopoly [power] by means of those restraints of trade which are
cognizable under [Sherman Act] &#167; 1." <u>United States v. Griffith</u>, 334 U.S. 100, 106 (1948); <u>Barry

claims. Similarly, <u>Roland Machinery</u> assumed <u>Colgate</u> applied to exclusive dealing cases,
but its discussion of <u>Colgate</u> was clearly dicta, as the court found no "hint" of a meeting
of minds. 749 F.2d at 392. Likewise, <u>Parkway Gallery Furniture, Inc. v.
Kittinger/Pennsylvania House Group, Inc.</u>, 878 F.2d 801 (4th Cir. 1989), addressed
territorial restrictions, not exclusive dealing. It is not at all clear that <u>Colgate</u> applies
where the case is based on a defendant's exclusion of competitors. This Court need not
resolve any issue regarding the applicability of <u>Colgate</u>, however, to decide the present
motion, given the record evidence supporting the finding of agreement under the <u>Colgate</u>

thing").

<p><a name="N38"></a><sup>38</sup> In 1992, Dentsply sold teeth to <u>Jan Dental</u> after it agreed to drop its Vita, Kenson, Dentorium and Justi lines. B-250-52; Mazz (Schein), B-l907. In 1994, to ensure <u>Pearson</u> would
acquiesce to Dentsply's demand and withdraw its new stock of Vita teeth, Dentsply told Pearson
to send a letter to Dentsply stating its intention to comply. Kashfian (Pearson), B-1835-44. Pearson
discussed the "contents of the letter" with Dentsply prior to sending it, and Dentsply told
Pearson that "this would be sufficient." <u>Id.</u>, B-l842-43 ("he was happy and satisfied and [said] that
that's the way we do it"). In 1995, <u>DTS</u> acquired the Trubyte line after it agreed to drop Vita,
Ivoclar, and Justi teeth from its Kansas City, Denver, and Orlando outlets, and not sell Vita teeth
from its New York location outside of the Northeast. Brennan (DS), B-1475-80 &amp; B-245-46,

unpublished and, therefore, not precedential and should not be cited. <u>Id.</u> at 76,841 n.**.

<p><a name="N49"></a><sup>49</sup> All of Dentsply's tooth sales are made through dealers, so the foreclosure rate for rivals that do not sell any teeth to these dealers is identical to Dentsply's market share (100% of
70%-80%). That is true for Ivoclar, which sells teeth only directly. DS Mem. at 13. It is also
true for Vident with the exception of one outlet of one dealer that sells Vita teeth, by an
agreement with Dentsply, in a limited area only.

<p><a name="N50"></a><sup>50	</sup>Indeed, Dentsply itself seems to concede the validity of this approach in its
motion concerning the damage claim in the <u>Howard Hess Dental Labs</u> private action. There,
Dentsply argues that the plaintiff labs are indirect purchasers because Dentsply sells its teeth exclusively
to dealers. B-1404 ("Defendant Dentsply International, Inc.'s Memorandum in Support of its
Motion for Summary Judgment on Standing Grounds," <u>Howard Hess Dental Laboratories Inc., et al.
v. Dentsply International, Inc.</u>, No. 99-255 (D. Del.), filed April 3, 2000). <u>If</u> that is true, then
dealers are the relevant consumers for antitrust purposes, and foreclosure should be measured
by the percentage of dealers foreclosed.

<p><a name="N51"></a><sup>51	</sup>The foreclosure rates for American Tooth, Austenal and Universal are lower
because these brands are most commonly "grandfathered" under Dealer Criterion 6. Contrary
to Dentsply's assertion (DS Mem. at 30 n.42), this grandfathering does not cure the
anticompetitive effects of Dentsply's exclusive dealing agreements. <u>Dairymen, Inc.</u>, 1983-2 Trade Cas.
(CCH) &#182; 65,651, at 69,338 (W.D. Ky. 1983)(exclusive dealing contracts with similar grandfather
clauses found unlawful). Dentsply's reliance on <u>Empire Volkswagen, Inc. v. World-Wide
Volkswagen Corp.</u>, 814 F.2d 90, 97 (2d Cir. 1987) is misplaced because in that case the defendant's
franchise agreement did not prevent plaintiff from selling a rival's car at a separate
salesroom facility. <u>Id.</u> <b>[REDACTED]</b> In addition, Dentsply's claim that Universal has "nearly
one hundred dealers" (DS Mem. at 22) is misleading because many dealers carry
Universal merchandise but not its teeth.

<p><a name="N52"></a><sup>52	</sup><u>See</u> <u>Microsoft</u>, 1998-2 Trade Cas. (CCH) &#182; 72,261 at 82,680 (in general, foreclosure must be at least 40% for plaintiff to prevail); 11 Herbert Hovenkamp, <u>Antitrust Law</u> &#182; 1821 at 160 (1998) (foreclosure above 50% "routinely condemned").

<p><a name="N53"></a><sup>53	</sup>Because the district court had not properly defined the relevant market,
however, the court of appeals reversed the lower court's entry of judgment on this issue. 521 F.2d at
1252-53.

<p><a name="N54"></a><sup>54	</sup><u>See</u> <u>also</u> <u>Beltone Electronics Corp.</u>, 100 F.T.C. 68, 107 (1982) (if foreclosure suggests defendant has market power, then foreclosure is a "more significant factor"
supporting violation).

<p><a name="N55"></a><sup>55	</sup>These foreclosure rates understate the competitive harm because the few
dealers left for Dentsply's rivals are much smaller and less efficient than dealers selling
Trubyte teeth. Reitman Rept., B-1074; <u>e.g.</u>, Silcox (Jack Silcox), B-2112-18 (Justi dealer turned down by Dentsply in 1995; has two active employees, has no sales force, customer service department or
catalog; has difficulty competing against larger dealers); Zuckerman (Zuckerman Lab
Supply), B-2309-11, 2320-24 (two employees, no marketing or customer service
department, no advertising, no catalog, "not a major player"); Young (Young Dental),
B-2289-93 (one-man, one-room Vita dealer, no advertising, no catalog). Dealers selling
Trubyte teeth are considerably larger. ILjk Kashfian (Pearson), B-1803, 1819-20; B-779 (150

<p><a name="N56"></a><sup>56</sup> Vident's "distributing labs" (<u>see</u> DS Mem. at 15) are also properly excluded. Even Dentsply has recognized that using labs to sell to other labs is an ineffective strategy. B-264 ("Vita has
poor distribution and depends on consignments to get teeth into the laboratory. Then the lab
is supposed to sell to other labs and that is a laugh!"); Howe (DS), B-1789-90 ("labs don't like

<p><a name="N59"></a><sup>59</sup> In 1995, Becker-Parkin actually inquired about distributing Dentsply's teeth at
the request of one customer. Salzman (Becker-Parkin), B-2096, 2100. But Dentsply
questioned whether Becker-Parkin could add incremental business, and it never
started selling Trubyte teeth. <u>Id.</u>, B-2101 &amp; B-329. Indeed, a major consideration in
Dentsply's decision to begin selling teeth to a new dealer is "whether or not they
[have] a very strong and dedicated focus on the laboratory market." Pohl (DS),
B-2026.

<p><a name="N60"></a><sup>60	</sup>Dentsply claims to have received one to two inquiries each month since 1992
from "dental products dealers" seeking to become Trubyte dealers (DS Mem. at 7). Dentsply's
evidence does not support its contention that there are numerous operatory dealers who want
to start selling teeth. The former head of the Trubyte Division testified that he didn't know the
details of such requests and that Dentsply may not have kept such records. Clark (DS), B-1586,
1588.

<p><a name="N61"></a><sup>61	</sup>In <u>Microsoft</u>, the court recently held that Microsoft's exclusive dealing arrangements with various equipment manufacturers, internet content providers and others did
not violate Section 1. Although the court found that Microsoft's agreements had restricted its
rival's access to the most efficient distribution channels for browsers, and thus supported a finding
of liability under Section 2, it concluded that under the relevant case law it could not find those
agreements violated Section 1 because they did not "foreclose absolutely outlets that together accounted for
a substantial percentage of the total distribution of the relevant products." 87 F. Supp.2d
at 52. Here, however, there is abundant evidence of substantial foreclosure. <u>See</u> pp. 26-28.

<p><a name="N62"></a><sup>62</sup> <u>Roland Machinery</u> stated that a plaintiff must prove that at least one significant
competitor was kept from doing business in the relevant market. 749 F.2d at 394. Given
Komatsu's success, it is unlikely the court would have remanded the case believing
Roland might prevail on a fuller record (id. at 396) had it actually meant that complete
exclusion was required. Indeed, Judge Wright declined to follow that dicta in <u>Kellam
Energy, Inc. v. Duncan</u>, 668 F. Supp. 861, 885 n.34 (D. Del. 1987). Yet even if that standard
were accepted, <b>[REDACTED]</b> decision not to enter (pp. 7-8) is sufficient to meet it. So, too, is Dentsply's
