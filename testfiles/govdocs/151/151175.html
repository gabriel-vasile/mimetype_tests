<p><a name="soa"></a><center><strong><u>SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT</u></strong></center>

<p>	For at least the past 14 years, Dentsply has used its monopoly power to erect a barrier
to effective entry, expansion and competition in the United States market for artificial teeth. 
Dentsply has repeatedly blocked its competitors from developing networks of dental
laboratory dealers necessary to compete effectively in the market.  Over that time period,
many dealers that are selling Dentsply's Trubyte teeth sought to supplement their product
lines by adding competing tooth brands, often directly in response to the requests of their
dental lab customers.  And competing tooth suppliers wanted to sell their teeth through those
dealers to become more effective competitors to Dentsply.

<p>	Dentsply does not seriously dispute that it has a dominant 75%-80% market share
which has persisted for years.  The barrier to effective entry and expansion imposed by
Dentsply's exclusionary conduct makes its monopoly power secure.  Under Supreme Court
and Third Circuit precedent, Dentsply's very high market share, supported by the barrier to
effective competition its exclusionary conduct has erected, is sufficient to establish monopoly
power.  And the direct evidence of actual anticompetitive effects too is sufficient by itself to
establish that Dentsply is a monopolist.  Dentsply's control over marketwide prices under its
pricing umbrella clearly shows the existence of its monopoly power.  

<p>	The record shows conclusively, and Dentsply concedes, that in the absence of its
exclusionary conduct: (1) dealers would add competing brands of teeth to their product
offerings; (2) prices will fall; (3) Dentsply would lose market share, as labs begin buying more
of those competing brands when they become available through dealers; and (4) competition
will increase, as Dentsply tries to regain its lost market share and its rivals increase their
promotional activity.  The United States is unaware of any case in which direct evidence of
effects such as these, once proven, have not been condemned by the federal courts.  Greater
competition, lower prices, improved consumer choice are fundamental goals of the antitrust
laws.  

<p>	Anticompetitive effects are similarly established by presumption through the evidence
of market structure and substantial degree of market foreclosure -- 78% to 87% of dental
laboratory dealer outlets in the United States.  Dentsply's exclusionary conduct is
anticompetitive because it has excluded rivals from these dealers, the most effective channel
for distributing artificial teeth in the United States.  Other channels of distribution such as
direct sales, operatory dealers, and distributing laboratories, are not viable and effective
alternatives.  Dentsply's monopoly power and high market share, the importance of dealers to
effective competition, and the widespread, pervasive and longstanding foreclosure of rivals
from those dealers give rise to a strong presumption of anticompetitive effects.  

<p>	So far in this matter, Dentsply has responded to this two-pronged approach to proving
anticompetitive effects by arguing only that the presumption does not arise.  Dentsply has
argued, citing various cases which have rejected that presumption in their particular factual
circumstances, that dealers are not important, alternatives are available, or that dealers could
choose to add rivals' tooth lines because they are not bound by long-term contracts.  These
arguments ignore the direct evidence of effects and monopoly power and are simply
nonresponsive to a violation predicated on a showing of actual effects or monopoly power.  

<p>	Nonetheless, even absent monopoly power and actual effects, Dentsply's three
arguments against a presumption of effects are not well grounded.  

<p>	1.	Dealers are the most effective channel for distributing artificial teeth in the
United States.  They provide important services and benefits to both laboratories and artificial
tooth suppliers. 

<p>	2.	The fact that Dentsply has not foreclosed <em>every</em> dealer and <em>every </em>potential
avenue of distributing artificial teeth in the United States, including direct distribution of teeth
outside the dealer channel altogether, does not make its exclusionary conduct lawful. 
Complete 100% foreclosure is not required for exclusionary conduct to be anticompetitive. 

<p>	3.	A defense predicated on the absence of long-term contracts ignores the facts of
this case.  To prevent dealers selling Trubyte teeth from carrying rival brands of teeth,
Dentsply has imposed an "all-or-nothing" choice on those dealers: if they add a competing
brand, they lose all of their Trubyte tooth business.  Because Dentsply's market share is 15
times larger than the next-largest competitor, this choice has been an easy one for dealers to
make.  In the past 14 years, no dealer has walked away from Trubyte to take on a competitive
line.  In 1993, five years after its unwritten policy was used to prevent Frink Dental from
selling the Ivoclar's teeth, Dentsply memorialized this policy as Dealer Criterion 6, one of the
two challenged practices in this case.  Dealer Criterion 6 is an express agreement between
Dentsply and its dealers, and to the extent Dentsply has not sought express agreements from
dealers at the outset, the course of conduct between Dentsply and its dealers established an
agreement.  These agreements have unreasonably restrained competition.

<p>	In light of the evidence of substantial anticompetitive effects resulting from Dentsply's 
exclusionary conduct, Dentsply has the heavy burden under the Sherman Act and Clayton Act
to show that a nonpretextual and sufficiently procompetitive rationale for its conduct.  Indeed,
the United States is aware of no case in which a Court found that higher prices, frustrated
consumer choice, market foreclosure and market inefficiency were procompetitive.  Yet those
are precisely the "benefits" that Dentsply's claimed justification purports to protect.  Not
surprisingly, Dentsply has not produced evidence that would justify a finding here so
fundamentally at odds with the goals of the antitrust laws.

<p>	First, Dentsply's current justification is clearly pretextual, in light of the
contemporaneous evidence of Dentsply's intent to "block competitive distribution points
[and] not allow competition to achieve toeholds in dealers."  In addition, Dentsply has since
asserted a shifting series of purported justifications that also are inconsistent with the theory
its expert articulated to this Court.  Second, Dentsply's claimed justification does not apply to
the artificial tooth market and is unsupported by the facts in the record.  Instead, it consists of
the theoretical speculation of its economic expert, Dr. Marvel.  He constructed a theory that
perhaps the imposition of higher prices is justified because it means that Dentsply might
increase its tooth promotions.  Dr. Marvel did not even attempt to articulate how, in this
hypothetical world, Dentsply's increased promotion could possibly outweigh the benefits to
consumers and society of lower prices, more choices, and increased efficiency, nor did he try
to evaluate whether "total promotion" in the market would increase.

<p>	Finally, even if Dentsply's claimed business justification was not pretextual,
insufficiently procompetitive, and overbroad, any negligible benefit is, when balanced under
the Rule of Reason, far outweighed by the substantial anticompetitive harm resulting from 
Dentsply's exclusionary policies.  The clear weight of the evidence establishes that Dentsply
has violated sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act and section 3 of the Clayton Act.  Section 2
of the Sherman Act prohibits a monopolist such as Dentsply from using anticompetitive
conduct to maintain monopoly power.  Section 1 of the Sherman Act and section 3 of the
Clayton Act prohibit anticompetitive exclusive agreements such as those between Dentsply
and its dealers. 

<p>	Although exclusive dealing may in some circumstances serve legitimate
procompetitive purposes, it is the effect of the exclusive agreements in this case that matters,
because antitrust cases are resolved "on a case-by-case basis, focusing on the 'particular facts
disclosed in the record'" and "[l]egal presumptions that rest on formalistic distinctions rather
than actual market realities are generally disfavored."  <u>Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Tech.

States</u>, 268 U.S. 563, 579 (1925)).  Where, as here, a firm has foreclosed much of the market
to competitors, the antitrust laws require a fact-bound inquiry into the "probable immediate
and future effects which preemption of that share of the market might have on effective
competition."  <u>Tampa Elec. Co. v. Nashville Coal Co.</u>, 365 U.S. 320, 329 (1961).

<p>	Monopoly power is "'the ability to control price . . .  or to exclude or restrict
competition."  <u>Weiss</u>, 745 F.2d at 827 n.72 (quoting <u>Grinnell</u>, 384 U.S. at 571); <u>Houser v. Fox
Theatres Mgmt. Corp.</u>, 845 F.2d 1225, 1230 (3d Cir. 1988).  Dentsply's monopoly power can
be established by direct evidence of its control over prices and exclusion of competitors.  <u>See</u>
<u>Kodak</u>, 504 U.S. at 477 ("It is clearly reasonable to infer that Kodak has market power to raise
prices and drive out competition . . . since respondents offer direct evidence that Kodak did
so.").<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a>  Dentsply's monopoly power can also be established by its dominant share in the
artificial tooth market.  Because a true determination of whether a firm possesses monopoly
power hinges upon an analysis of complicated economic factors, "[c]ourts often look to
market share as a short cut to determine if monopoly power exists."  <u>Tarrant Serv. Agency,
Inc. v. American Standard, Inc.</u>, 12 F.3d 609, 615 (6th Cir. 1993).<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a>  In the Third Circuit, "the

"'ordinarily may be inferred from the predominant share of the market'."  <u>Weiss</u>, 745 F.2d at
827 n.72 (quoting <u>Grinnell</u>, 384 U.S. at 571).  Such a high market share "may obviate the need
to analyze other pertinent factors." <u>Fineman v. Armstrong World Indus., Inc</u>, 980 F.2d 171, 
(3<sup>rd</sup> Cir. 1992).  However, where it is difficult for other firms to expand or to enter a market,
such evidence bolsters the conclusion that a firm possesses monopoly power.  <u>See</u> <u>Microsoft</u>,
253 F.2d at 54-55; <u>Fineman</u>, 980 F.2d. at 202.  Dentsply's extremely high market share, along
with the barrier to effective entry and expansion that its exclusive dealing has imposed, and
the direct evidence of Dentsply's control over prices and exclusion of competition, clearly
establish Dentsply's monopoly power.

<p><a name="1a1"></a><ol><ol><ol><strong><li>Dentsply's High Market Share And The Barrier To Entry And
Expansion It Has Imposed Establish That Dentsply Has Monopoly Power.</li></strong></ol></ol></ol>


<p> Dentsply's monopoly power could not be more evident.  Dentsply has a dominant
share of the market, its rivals' shares are insignificant in comparison, and Dentsply's
dominant share has persisted for years.  The entry barrier imposed by Dentsply's exclusionary
conduct makes its monopoly power secure.<strong></strong>

<p> Dentsply's "predominant" market share is easily sufficient to support the conclusion
that it possesses monopoly power.  <u>See</u> <u>Weiss</u>, 745 F.2d at 827 n.72.  Dentsply commands at
least a 75%-80% share of the United States artificial tooth market.  PFF &#182;169.  Dentsply's
own documents show that it has maintained an 80% market share for over 10 years, and some
of its documents state that its market share in the premium tooth segment is well above 80%. 
PFF &#182;171.<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a>  Shares approximating those maintained by Dentsply have routinely been deemed
sufficient to establish monopoly power.  <u>See</u>, <u>e.g.</u>, <u>Kodak</u>, 504 U.S. at 481 (80%); <u>United
States v. E.I du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co.</u>, 351 U.S. at 377, 379 (1956) (75%); <u>Int'l Boxing
Club v. United States</u>, 358 U.S. 242 (1959) (81%); <u>Am. Tobacco Co. v. United States</u>, 328
U.S. 781, 797 (1946) ("over two-thirds of the entire domestic field of cigarettes"); <u>Houser</u>,
845 F.2d at 1229-30 (66%-71%); <u>Weiss</u>, 745 F.2d at 793, 827 (80%); <u>Allen-Myland</u>, 33 F.3d
at 201 (79% share would show "substantial market power," but rejecting proposed market
definition).<a href="#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a>

<p>	Dentsply's monopoly power is even more evident when its dominant share is
compared to the meager shares of its rivals.  <u>See</u> <u>Weiss</u>, 745 F.2d at 827 n.72.  Dentsply's
market share is <em>15 times</em> greater than the share of its next largest competitor.  PFF &#182;170. 
Courts have credited evidence of monopoly power involving alleged monopolists with shares
far less than Dentsply's where rivals had shares far higher than Dentsply's rivals.  <u>See</u>, <u>e.g.</u>,
<u>Fineman</u>  980 F.2d at 201 (market shares were "persuasive" evidence of monopoly power,
where defendant's share was 48% and rivals' shares were between 7.8% and 15%); <u>Reazin</u>,
899 F.2d at 969 (upholding finding of monopoly power, where defendant had 47% to 62%
share, and next largest rival had 5% share).   Accordingly, the evidence of Dentsply's
monopoly power is stronger even than its dominant market share suggests.

<p>	Moreover, the fact that Dentsply's dominant 75-80% share has persisted for over a
decade is further evidence of Dentsply's monopoly power.  <u>See</u>, <u>e.g.</u>, II P. Areeda &amp; H.
Hovenkamp, <u>Antitrust Law</u> &#182; 801a (2002) ("substantial single-firm market power" can be
presumed if "the defendant's share of a well-defined market protected by sufficient entry
barriers has exceeded 70 or 75 percent for the five years preceding the complaint").  
Dentsply's long-standing dominant share is evidence that its share is not transitory and
therefore does not overstate Dentsply's substantial market power.  <u>See</u> <u>id.</u> &#182; 801a2.

<p>	In addition, Dentsply's exclusionary conduct in tying up dental laboratory dealers has
thwarted effective entry and expansion in the artificial tooth market.  Dentsply's foreclosure
of rivals is a significant entry barrier of the kind the antitrust laws condemn.  <u>See</u>, <u>e.g.</u>, <u>Kodak</u>,
504 U.S. at 485 ("one of the evils prescribed by the antitrust laws is the <em>creation</em> of entry
barriers to potential competitors") (emphasis added).<a href="#N_7_"><sup>(7)</sup></a>  The lack of effective entry or expansion
by any of Dentsply's competitors (or would-be competitors) confirms that Dentsply's
exclusionary conduct has been effective and that Dentsply's monopoly power is secure.  <u>See</u>,
<u>e.g.</u>, <u>Microsoft</u>, 253 F.3d at 54-55; <u>Fineman</u>, 980 F.2d at 202.<a href="#N_8_"><sup>(8)</sup></a> 

<p>	Dentsply's exclusionary conduct has deterred expansion by established firms.  For
over ten years, Dentsply's dominant market share has remained unchallenged and its
competitors' shares have not increased to any significant degree.  PFF &#182;171. The market
shares of Dentsply's principal competitors, Vita and Ivoclar, have been stuck in the mid-single
digits.  PFF &#182;171, 212. Nor have other established firms come anywhere close to eroding
Dentsply's dominant position.  PFF &#182; 213. Rather, other firms' market shares have hovered in
the 2%-3% range.  PFF &#182;170.     

<p>	Dentsply's exclusive dealing arrangements have completely excluded some entrants
and deterred others.  The barrier completely excluded Odipal, one would-be entrant. PFF
&#182;214.  Dentsply's exclusionary arrangements delayed the entry of the large German firm,
Heraeus Kulzer.  PFF &#182;215.  Heraeus first considered entering the United States tooth market<strong>
[REDACTED TEXT]</strong> but declined <strong> [REDACTED TEXT]</strong>	Dentsply's conduct has
minimized the competitive significance of recent entrants.  Firms entering the market within
the past two years have not achieved a significant presence and have not constrained
Dentsply's monopoly power.  PFF &#182;216-229.  Heraeus did not introduce its teeth into the
United States until 2000.  PFF &#182;218.  Heraeus has not obtained dealer distribution and sells its
teeth directly to dental laboratories. PFF &#182;219.  Heraeus missed its sales goals and its market
share is currently approximately 1%.  PFF &#182;220.  Likewise, Davis Schottlander &amp; David Ltd,
a British firm, introduced its Enigma tooth in the United States in 2001, but did not obtain
significant dealer distribution and has failed to achieve a significant market presence.  PFF
&#182;224, 227.  Enigma sales are far below Schottlander's initial targets, achieving only $21,278
in sales in the first year.  PFF &#182;227.  The firm's tooth sales are so modest that Lincoln Dental,
the one dental laboratory dealer that agreed to help sell Enigma teeth in the United States,
provides billing services but refuses to stock or ship the teeth.  PFF &#182;228.  By Dentsply's own
admission, the recent "entry" by Heraeus and Schottlander has not affected Dentsply's <strong>
[REDACTED TEXT]</strong> tooth quality, or lines of teeth Dentply sells.  PFF &#182;221, 229.<a href="#N_9_"><sup>(9)</sup></a>

<p>	No evidence establishes that any entry or expansion is likely to be meaningful.  For
entry or expansion to be meaningful, it must occur on a scale sufficient to curb Dentsply's
monopoly power.  <u>See</u>, <u>e.g.</u>, <u>Rebel Oil</u>, 51 F.3d at 1440; <u>Reazin</u>, 899 F.2d at 971.  Such entry
must also be timely.  <u>See</u> <u>Microsoft</u>, 253 F.3d at 57 ("Structural market power analyses are
meant to determine whether potential substitutes constrain a firm's ability to raise prices
above the competitive level; only threats that are likely to materialize in the relatively near
future perform this function to any significant degree.").  Neither expansion by existing firms
nor any recent entry has undermined Dentsply's unilateral price leadership.  PFF &#182;173-78,
221, 229; <u>see</u> <u>also Section I. A. 2</u> (discussing Dentsply's pricing control).  Dentsply's ability
to maintain supracompetitive prices for so long confirms that Dentsply's exclusionary conduct
has erected a barrier to effective entry and competition, because "'without barriers to entry it
would presumably be impossible to maintain supracompetitive prices for an extended time.'" 
<u>Cargill v. Monfort of Colo., Inc.</u>, 479 U.S. 104, 119 (1986) (citation omitted); <u>see</u> <u>also</u> <u>Advo,
Inc. v. Phil. Newspapers, Inc.</u>, 51 F. 3d 1191, 1200 (3d Cir. 1995).  Under these
circumstances, Dentsply's durable high prices warrant close judicial scrutiny because "'the
substantial market power that concerns antitrust law arises when the defendant (1) can
profitably set prices well above its costs and (2) enjoys some protection against a rival's entry
or expansion that would erode such supracompetitive prices and profits.'"  <u>Bailey v. Allgas,
Inc.</u>, 284 F.3d 1237, 1245 (11th Cir. 2002) (quoting IIA Phillip Areeda, et al., <u>Antitrust Law</u> &#182;
501 (2d ed. 2002)); <u>Coastal Fuels of Puerto Rico, Inc. v. Caribbean Petroleum Corp.</u>, 79 F.3d
182, 196 (1st Cir. 1996). 

<p>	It is not enough for Dentsply to speculate about the possible <em>future</em> success of recent
fringe entrants, absent any evidence suggesting that such firms are likely to gain enough
presence to constrain Dentsply's monopoly power.  <u>See</u>, <u>e.g.</u>, <u>Reazin</u>, 899 F.2d at 971; <u>Colo.
Interstate Gas Co. v. Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of Am.</u>, 885 F.2d 683, 695 n.23 (10th Cir.
1989) ("A suggestion that unidentified market forces will eventually correct supra-competitive
pricing will not suffice to show that monopoly power will be temporary.").  Nor is such
speculation probative (even if correct) because "'the existence of significant substitution in
the event of <em>further</em> price increases or even at the <em>current</em> price does not tell us whether the
defendant <em>already</em> exercises significant market power.'" <u>Kodak</u>, 504 U.S. at 471 (quoting P.
Areeda &amp; L. Kaplow, <u>Antitrust Analysis</u> &#182; 340(b) (4th ed. 1988).  Indeed, such fringe entry
into a "slightly declining market" (Jenson Tr. 2303-04) in the face of Dentsply's substantial
entry barrier is unsurprising because supracompetitive prices attract entry.  <u>See</u>, <u>e.g.</u>, <u>In re
High Fructose Corn Syrup Antitrust Litig.</u>, --- F.3d --- 2002 WL 1315285 at *5 (7th Cir.
2002); <u>Andrx Pharmaceuticals v. Biovail Corp. Int'l</u>, 256 F.3d 799, 814 (D.C. Cir. 2001)
(when a firm "exercise[s] market power to charge supracompetitive prices, entry by firms
currently not competing in the market becomes likely") (internal quotations omitted). 
Heraeus's North American president testified that the high prices of artificial teeth in the
United States makes it a very attractive market.  PFF &#182;218.  Such entry does not undermine
the conclusion that Dentsply exercises monopoly power.  

<p>	Accordingly, Dentsply's high market share, and the lack of any effective entry or
expansion, confirms Dentsply's monopoly power.  

<p><a name="1a2"></a><ol><ol><ol type="1" start="2"><strong><li>Direct Evidence Of Dentsply's Control Over Prices And
Competition Establishes Dentsply's Monopoly Power.</li></strong></ol></ol></ol>


<p>	Dentsply's high share, supported by the barrier to effective competition its
exclusionary conduct has erected, establish that Dentsply has the power to control prices and
exclude competitors.  In addition, there is overwhelming <em>direct</em> evidence of Dentsply's
monopoly power, including its ability to thwart consumer choices, control prices and exclude
competition.  This evidence is sufficient by itself to establish Dentsply's monopoly power. 
<u>See</u>, <u>e.g.</u>, <u>Kodak</u>, 504 U.S. at 469 (the defendant "must show that despite evidence of
increased prices and excluded competition, an inference of market power is unreasonable");
<u>Microsoft</u>, 253 F.3d at 51 (where such evidence exists, "the existence of monopoly power is
clear") (citing <u>FTC v. Ind. Fed'n of Dentists ("IFD")</u>, 476 U.S. 447, 460-61 (1986)).<a href="#N_10_"><sup>(10)</sup></a> 

<p>	 Frustrating consumer choice and effectively reducing output are anticompetitive
effects that confirm the existence of market power.  <u>See</u> <u>FTC v Ind.Fed'n of  Dentists</u>, 476
U.S. 447 at 457, 462 (1986); <u>United States v. Brown Univ</u>, 5 F.3d 658, 668 (3d Cir. 1993). 
Dentsply's executives have acknowledged that its market share will decline absent Dealer
Criterion 6, a concession that Dentsply's conduct deters consumers from purchasing teeth they
would purchase if they could get them through dental dealers.  PFF &#182;266.  Other evidence
(discussed more fully in connection with Dentsply's willful maintenance of monopoly power)
confirms such consumer harm.  <u>See</u> <u>id.</u> 

<p>	The evidence of Dentsply's pricing control dramatically shows the existence of
monopoly power.  <u>See</u>, <u>e.g.</u>, <u>Microsoft</u>, 253 F.3d at 58 ("the company set the price of
Windows without considering rival's prices . . ., something a firm without a monopoly would
have been unable to do").  The evidence is overwhelming that Dentsply controls market
prices.  Dentsply is the price leader in the artificial tooth market. PFF &#182;173. According to
William Turner, Dentsply's Senior Product Manager for Trubyte's tooth products from 1993
until earlier this year, "[a]s the price leader, Dentsply usually sets the prices in the marketplace
and everyone else contributes or competes under that broad umbrella." PFF &#182;173. In setting
the level of this price umbrella, Dentsply consults the consumer price index for medical and
dental materials, or possibly other indexes of inflation, but does not consult other factors,
including prices of competing teeth. PFF &#182;174-75.  Dentsply has not reacted with lower prices
when other firms have decided not to follow its price increases.  PFF &#182;177.  Rather, its prices
have consistently been 10%-15% higher than the prices of both Vita and Ivoclar in the
premium segment, and 10% higher than its next-highest priced competitor in the economy
segment. PFF &#182;176. As a result, Dentsply has earned a reputation in the industry for
aggressive price increases.  PFF &#182;178.    Dentsply's prices<strong> [REDACTED TEXT]</strong> its marginal
costs of producing teeth, producing gross margins of between <strong> [REDACTED TEXT]</strong> PFF
&#182;182. Its margins surpass those of other firms in the industry, even though those firms
themselves are able to charge high prices under Dentsply's price umbrella. PFF &#182;186.  Its
margins also far surpass the margins it earns on its non-teeth products.  PFF &#182;183. 

<p>	The fact that Dentsply has been able to sustain these high margins and profits for so
long also shows its monopoly power.  <u>See</u> <u>Colo. Interstate Gas</u>, 885 F.2d at 695 ("One
measure of the degree of market power is the persistence of a firm's ability to profitably
charge monopoly prices.").  Moreover, the evidence of its pricing control is even more
dramatic than its high prices and margins alone suggest, because during a substantial period
when Dentsply controlled market prices, it produced teeth considered by many in the industry
to be inferior to its rivals.  PFF &#182;191-96; <u>see</u> <u>also</u> text, pp. -- <u>supra</u>.  It did not introduce a tooth
attempting to match the most popular tooth shades in the industry until 1993.  <u>Id.</u>  Dentsply's
ability to maintain high prices and margins for so long while offering products perceived by
many to be inferior "lends strong support" to a finding of monopoly power.  <u>Byars v. Bluff
City News Co., Inc.</u>, 609 F.2d 843, 853 n.26 (6th Cir. 1979); <u>see</u>&nbsp;<u>also</u> <u>Andrx Pharmaceuticals</u>,
256 F.3d at 814.

<p>	Moreover, Dentsply has excluded competition from 78%-87% of the dental laboratory
dealers in the United States, establishing a substantial barrier to effective competition in the
artificial tooth market. PFF &#182;242-45 .  This pervasive level of exclusion directly reflects
Dentsply's monopoly power.  <u>See</u>, <u>e.g.</u>, <u>Microsoft</u>, 253 F.3d at 51, 58 ("More telling, the
District Court found that some aspects of Microsoft's behavior [including its "pattern of
exclusionary conduct"] are difficult to explain unless Windows is a monopoly product.");
<u>Ryko Mfg. Co. v. Eden Servs.</u>, 823 F.2d 1215, 1233 (8th Cir. 1987) ("Where the degree of
foreclosure caused by the exclusivity provisions is so great that it invariably indicates that the
supplier imposing the provisions has substantial market power, we may rely on the foreclosure
rate alone to establish the violation.").<a href="#N_11_"><sup>(11)</sup></a>

<p>	Accordingly, the evidence of Dentsply's high market share, the barrier to
competitively meaningful expansion and entry that its own exclusionary conduct has imposed,
and direct evidence of Dentsply's control over the artificial tooth market, all show that
Dentsply has monopoly power. 

<p><a name="1b"></a><ol><ol type="A" start="2"><strong><li>Dentsply Has Willfully Maintained Its Monopoly Power Through Anticompetitive Conduct.</li></strong></ol></ol>


<p> 	Section 2 prohibits the "the willful acquisition, maintenance, or use of [monopoly]

purposes."  <u>Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp</u>., 472 U.S. 585, 595-96 (1985);

Dentsply's conduct is exclusionary, the effect of its conduct on consumers and competition
should be considered.  <u>See</u> <u>Aspen</u>, 472 U.S. at 605.  A monopolists' conduct is unlawful
where, as here, it "'tends to impair the opportunities of rivals [and] either does not further

that "[w]here a defendant maintains substantial market power, his activities are examined

<p>	Here, foreclosure is substantial and Dentsply has monopoly power.  Moreover, direct
evidence of adverse effects confirms that Dentsply's conduct is anticompetitive, as the
foreclosure rate and its monopoly power suggest.  Dentsply has maintained its monopoly
power, deterred effective entry and expansion of rival firms, frustrated consumer preferences,
increased prices, and impaired the quality of teeth used in dentures.  The anticompetitive
nature of Dentsply's conduct shows that its conduct has contributed to the maintenance of its

Because They Have Foreclosed Access To 78%-87% Of Dental
Laboratory Dealer Outlets In The United States.</li></strong></ol></ol></ol>


<p>	Dentsply's exclusionary conduct is anticompetitive because it has excluded rivals from
the most effective channel for distributing artificial teeth in the United States.  By any
measure, the foreclosure caused by Dentsply's conduct is substantial.  Whether measured by
the percentage of Dentsply's market share sold through its distributors, the percentage of
dealer outlets foreclosed, or the percentage of dealer tooth stocks foreclosed, Dentsply has
foreclosed its principal rivals -- Vita and Ivoclar -- from at least 78%-87% of dealer outlets
that sell teeth (or potentially could sell teeth). PFF &#182;244<a href="#N_14_"><sup>(14)</sup></a>  Dentsply has foreclosed other tooth
manufacturers from at least 60% of the market.  PFF &#182;245 .<a href="#N_15_"><sup>(15)</sup></a>  Moreover, the pure foreclosure
percentages understate the competitive harm because the few dealers left for Dentsply's rivals

below, the dealers foreclosed by Dentsply's exclusionary conduct are dental laboratories'
preferred source for ordering artificial teeth, provide important services to customers and
manufacturers, and are by far the most efficient means of distributing teeth in this country. 
<u>See</u> Section I. B.2. A

<p>	The degree of foreclosure present here is far above what is required to establish
anticompetitive effects.  Even absent monopoly power, exclusive dealing can violate the
antitrust laws if the exclusive agreements foreclose "a substantial share of the line of
commerce affected."  <u>Tampa Elec.</u>, 365 U.S. at 327; <u>Barr Labs., Inc. v. Abbott Labs.</u>, 978 F.2d
98, 110 (3d Cir. 1992); <u>Am. Motor Inns, Inc. v. Holiday Inns, Inc.</u>, 521 F.2d 1230, 1252 (3d
Cir. 1975).  Courts have found exclusive dealing arrangements anticompetitive where they
foreclose 40%- 50% of the market.  <u>Microsoft</u>, 253 F.3d at 70; 11 Herbert Hovenkamp,
<u>Antitrust Law</u> &#182; 1821 at 160 (1998) (foreclosure above 50% "routinely condemned").  The
threshold is lower where, as here, a defendant has monopoly power.  Because the conduct of a
monopolist must be "examined through a special lens" (<u>Kodak</u>, 504 U.S. at 488), "a
monopolists' use of exclusive contracts, in certain circumstances, may give rise to a &#167; 2
violation even though the contracts foreclose less than the roughly 40% to 50% share usually
required in order to establish a &#167; 1 violation."  <u>Microsoft</u>, 253 F.3d at 70.

<p>	The fact that Dentsply has not foreclosed <em>every</em> dealer and <em>every </em>potential avenue of
distributing artificial teeth in the United States, including direct distribution of teeth outside
the dealer channel altogether, does not make its exclusionary conduct lawful.  Complete 100%
foreclosure is not required for exclusionary conduct to be anticompetitive.  <u>See</u> <u>Tampa Elec.</u>,
365 U.S. at 327 ("substantial share"); <u>Lorain Journal</u>, 342 U.S. at 152-53 (no need to prove
monopolist "completely eliminated" rival).<a href="#N_16_"><sup>(16)</sup></a>   Foreclosure of a substantial share of a
distribution channel can be anticompetitive if the distribution channel is important for
effective competition.  <u>See</u>, <u>e.g.</u>, <u>Microsoft</u>, 253 F.3d at 64, 70-71<a href="#N_17_"><sup>(17)</sup></a>  As this Court recognized
when denying Dentsply's motion for summary judgment, any alternative channels must be
viable; they must be capable of depriving "existing dental laboratory dealers" of "significant
levels of business."  <u>United States v. Dentsply Int'l, Inc.</u>, 2001 WL 624807, *9 (D. Del. March
30, 2001).  Otherwise, the exclusionary conduct still serves to maintain a defendant's market
power.  <u>See</u>, <u>e.g.</u>, <u>Microsoft</u>, 253 F.3d at 70-71, 73-74.

<p>	The degree of foreclosure in this case easily establishes that Dentsply's conduct is
anticompetitive, because, as shown next, dental laboratory dealers are critical to effective
competition in the artificial tooth market and other channels of distribution are not viable
substitutes for dealer distribution.<ins></ins>

<p><a name="1b1a"></a><ol><ol><ol><ol type="a"><strong><li>Dental Laboratory Dealers Are Important To Laboratories
and Suppliers.</li></strong></ol></ol></ol></ol>

<p>	It is no accident that Dentsply distributes its teeth through dealers having
approximately 100 tooth counters in essentially all metropolitan areas of the United States. 
PFF &#182;91.  Tooth dealers are central to tooth manufacturers' sales success in the United States. 
<u>See</u>, <u>e.g.</u>, PFF &#182;61   (Kevin Dillon: "If you don't have distribution with the dealer network,
you don't have distribution.").  The "general norm in the [artificial tooth] business is
distribution of teeth through dental dealers.  It's the expectation of the laboratory to purchase
and receive products that way and it's also the expectation of the laboratory to receive the
level of service provided by a dental dealer."  <u>Id.</u> 

<p>	Dentsply has acknowledged the competitive importance of its dealer network. 
According to Dentsply, a "key weakness" of its competitors is their lack of dealers and
resulting "limited distribution."  PFF &#182;153.   Even though Dentsply has over 100 dealer stocks
of Trubyte teeth, in essentially all major metropolitan areas, Dentsply believes it would "sell
more teeth" if it had more.  PFF &#182;91 .    Dentsply has encouraged dealers selling Trubyte teeth
to open more tooth counters and has tried to slow down any efforts by dealers to consolidate
tooth stocks.  PFF &#182;96.  For example, when Healthco, a former dealer selling Trubyte teeth,
was on the brink of insolvency, Dentsply encouraged Zahn to open tooth counters in both
North Carolina and Texas because otherwise "it would have left a tremendous gap in the
southeastern United States."  <u>Id </u>.

<p>	Dentsply values not only its larger national dealers, but also its smaller local dealers. 
Dentsply has made clear that it is <strong> [REDACTED TEXT]</strong> Smaller dealers command a very
high share of the Trubyte teeth sold in their local areas.  PFF &#182;93.  Dentsply values its local
dealers because they provide important service benefits to lab customers.  According to the
former head of Trubyte, "if a local dealer is successful at selling and providing service, a few
dollars in savings from mail order will be more than offset.  Customers will return for
excellent service.  Price can never replace service over the long haul."  PFF &#182;94 .  Dentsply
senior management has repeatedly recognized the importance of dealer support to Dentsply's
tooth business.  PFF &#182;91-97.

<p>	As Dentsply recognizes, artificial tooth dealers provide numerous services to tooth
manufacturers.  Dealers carry a substantial tooth inventory, which reduces the supplier's costs. 
PFF &#182;83 .  Dealers employ tooth counter specialists who, along with dealer sales reps,
regularly interact with the lab customer.  PFF &#182;89 .  They are experienced in handling teeth
and are familiar with different shades and moulds, and are therefore able to assist labs when
they have questions.  PFF &#182;81.  The relationships that arise out of these lab-dealer interactions
are important to a supplier because there are thousands of laboratories, and a supplier, even
one as large as Dentsply, cannot maintain this level of contact with so many customers.  PFF
&#182;89.  Dealers also handle accounts receivable, which allows manufacturers to avoid incurring
the substantial costs of billing, invoicing, and collecting debts from thousands of dental labs (a
group with a poor credit reputation in the industry).  PFF &#182;84.

<p>	In addition, tooth dealers promote suppliers' products.  PFF &#182;90.  Although each
supplier employs sales representatives, dealer sales representatives add another "voice in the
marketplace."  PFF &#182;85.  They co-travel with supplier reps and refer customers to supplier
representatives.  PFF &#182;87 .  Dealers provide additional advertising vehicles such as dealer
catalogues and other promotions.  PFF &#182;86.  These services also benefit labs.  Dealers inform
labs of new products, and as a result, labs are able to make more informed choices about
products.  PFF &#182;80 .

<p>	Dental laboratory dealers also provide important services to dental laboratories.  These
services benefit suppliers as well.  PFF &#182;62.  Unlike a manufacturer, dealers specialize in the
business of providing prompt, accurate, and reliable delivery of dental products, including
teeth, to dental laboratories.  PFF &#182;74 .  When a lab places an order for teeth, the lab needs the
order filled properly and needs the teeth quickly.  Id.  Consequently, dealers maintain tooth
stocks, which provide labs with a local inventory of readily available teeth.  PFF &#182;63 .  The
need for same-day pick-up or delivery of teeth is fairly common in the industry.  PFF &#182;66-68 . 
Indeed, Dentsply has recognized the importance of dealers with a "local presence" that can
provide teeth next-day or by pickup in "rapid turnaround situations."  PFF &#182;69.  Labs value
local access to a wide array of teeth even in non-emergency situations.  PFF &#182;68.  Small labs,
in particular, regard a local dealer inventory as a surrogate for their own, in-house inventory. 
PFF &#182;63 .   A local tooth stock increases the delivery options available to a lab, decreases
shipping charges, and decreases the amount of inventory the lab must keep, thereby reducing
the lab's expenses even further.  PFF &#182;65. 

<p>	In addition, dealer sales representatives visit dental labs and manage their tooth
inventories, determining which tooth cards have been used, placing restocking orders, and
taking back broken sets of teeth for credit.  PFF &#182;71-73.  Dealers provide a "far higher" level
of service than manufacturers because dealer representatives regularly call on labs, count teeth
and restock inventory.  PFF &#182;71.  The inventory management function is particularly valuable
where a lab's tooth stock is consigned from a manufacturer or dealer.  Dealer sales
representatives monitor consigned tooth stocks, replenish them, and make sure the lab is
properly billed for the inventory used.  PFF &#182;73  .  The dealers' role in handling tooth returns
is also important.  Labs return approximately<strong> [REDACTED TEXT]</strong> of the teeth they
purchase, and this percentage is likely to increase.  PFF &#182;79  .  Dealers collect the teeth
themselves or process teeth returned to them to make sure the labs receive proper credit. Id.

<p>	Dealers also provide one-stop shopping benefits to labs.  PFF &#182;76-78 .  These benefits
include the availability of multiple products from one source, reducing separate orders and
shipping, fewer accounts, fewer invoices to pay, and consolidation of tooth returns in one
dealer.   Reducing suppliers saves labs time, effort and cost.  PFF &#182;76 .  Large lab dealers
selling Trubyte teeth offer a broad array of products for sale.  PFF &#182;77.  Zahn offers over
25,000 tooth choices and 8,500 merchandise and equipment options. Id.  No manufacturer can
match this array of products.  Moreover, by consolidating purchases with a single dealer, labs
are able to take advantage of volume purchase discounts.  PFF &#182;78  .

<p>	Dentsply's rivals cannot create their own networks, because Dentsply has tied up so
many of the dealers required to establish an effective network.  PFF &#182;242-46  Other
manufacturers have repeatedly attempted to obtain meaningful dealer distribution but have not
been able to do so.  PFF &#182;44-60;247 .  Accordingly, Dentsply's foreclosure of 78%-87% of
this important distribution channel has seriously impaired its rivals' ability to compete and has
preserved its monopoly power.    

<p><a name="1b1b"></a><ol><ol><ol><ol type="a" start="2"><strong><li>Other Distribution Channels Are Not Viable Alternatives
To Laboratory Dealer Distribution.</li></strong></ol></ol></ol></ol> 

<p>	The alternative distribution channels available to Dentsply's rivals -- selling direct,
selling through "operatory" dealers that are not in the lab business, or selling through
distributing labs that compete with the labs that suppliers need to reach -- are not
competitively viable alternatives to dealer distribution.  Accordingly, these ineffective
alternatives do not mitigate the competitive harm caused by Dentsply's foreclosure.  <u>See</u>, <u>e.g.</u>,
<u>Microsoft</u>, 253 F.3d at 70-71.

<p>	<em>1.  Direct distribution is ineffective.  </em>Because dealers provide important services to
tooth suppliers and dental laboratory customers, selling teeth directly is a significant
disadvantage for a supplier.  PFF &#182;140-41, 153. Indeed, Dentsply has discouraged customers
from trying to purchase directly from Trubyte and has told them that "Dentsply simply cannot
provide adequate service to our lab customers absent our dealer network."  PFF &#182; 97 . 

<p>	Dentsply has acknowledged that direct selling involves additional costs.  PFF &#182;142. <strong>
[REDACTED TEXT]</strong>  Dentsply would have to<strong> [REDACTED TEXT]</strong>	
<p>
Dentsply's competitors agree that selling direct is more costly than selling through dealers.  PFF &#182;143. 
Even though direct sellers do not have to pay the standard 35% dealer margin, they incur
significant additional costs associated with the services that otherwise would be handled by a
dealer, such as maintaining tooth stocks, accounting, accounts receivable, billing, returns,
capitalizing higher inventories, and fulfilling orders.  PFF &#182;140-41.  As Mr. Swartout of
Meyerson explained, access to dealers "helps us reduce our operating expenses and invest
more in sales and marketing" by making collections more efficient and "tak[ing] advantage of
[dealers] doing cooperative sales and marketing efforts, thereby sharing costs."  PFF &#182;143. 
Others in the industry confirm this view.  <u>See</u> PFF &#182;&#182;143-45  (Desautel Tr. 2466 (it is a
"fallacy" to assume that it is cheaper to sell teeth directly); Obst Tr. 2752-53 (DSG obtains
Myerson teeth cheaper from Zahn than from Myerson).<a href="#N_18_"><sup>(18)</sup></a>  

<p>	Each of Dentsply's major competitors has tried, but failed, to overcome the
disadvantages of selling teeth directly.  Ivoclar's president, Mr. Ganley, testified that Ivoclar's
primary difficulty is being  "locked out" of dealers, because "the market is used to buying
[from a] dealer. . . .  It's what they're comfortable with."  PFF &#182;155. Ivoclar has tried several
different strategies to overcome this difficulty, including selling teeth through regional
distribution centers and providing consignments of teeth to labs, but all of them have failed. 
PFF &#182;156.  Ivoclar has developed a sales force dedicated solely to selling teeth, and hired one
of Dentsply's former tooth salesmen to lead that effort. Id.   This effort has failed, however,
because the small increase in sales has been outweighed by the costs of creating a separate
sales force focused on selling only one product. Id.  

<p>	Vident has had a similar experience. PFF &#182;158.  Vident tried several different
strategies to overcome the disadvantages of selling directly, including shipping teeth to labs
on an overnight basis, subsidizing the cost of next-day service, and providing consignments to
labs.  PFF &#182;159.  However, these costly efforts have not been successful. Id .

<p>	Likewise, Myerson has attempted unsuccessfully to overcome the hurdles imposed by
the lack of effective dealer distribution. It cannot establish regional tooth distribution centers
today because Myerson manufactures only teeth and it is not economical to sell only teeth
through a regional distribution center.  PFF &#182;161.<a href="#N_19_"><sup>(19)</sup></a>
  Nor is it feasible for Myerson to ship all
of its orders to labs overnight in light of the high cost of services like Federal Express. Id.

<p>	Accordingly, Dentsply's rivals have not been able to overcome the hurdles of direct
distribution.<em></em>

<p><em>	2.  Operatory dealer distribution is ineffective.</em> Operatory dealers are not an effective
means of distributing teeth to labs because, as this Court previously recognized, "operatory
dealers sell various merchandise and equipment to <em>dentist offices</em> as opposed to the <em>dental
laboratories</em> who purchase teeth."  <u>Dentsply</u>, 2001 WL 624807 at *9 (emphasis added).<a href="#N_20_"><sup>(20)</sup></a>  The
evidence confirms that operatory dealers that do not currently sell teeth are not viable
alternative distribution channels for the sale of artificial teeth.  Pure operatory dealers testified
that they have no interest in entering the dental laboratory business.  PPF &#182;253 . 

<p>	As Dentsply has conceded, the<strong> [REDACTED TEXT]</strong> Dentsply does not view
operatory dealers as likely entrants into the tooth market.  PPF &#182;252.  When looking for new
tooth dealers, Dentsply looks for dealers that already have a strong and dedicated focus on
laboratory business. Id.  It has found very few.  Id.  Dentsply's characterization of operatory
dealers' business is shared by other tooth suppliers.  <u>See</u>, <u>e.g.</u> PFF &#182;256 (Dillon Tr. 4083
("They're not in that business.  They don't call on laboratories.  It would be like me saying do
I consider a hardware store a place to distribute my dental products.  No different.  I wouldn't
want to distribute my dental products through a hardware store and I surely wouldn't want to
do it through an operatory.").

<p>	There are several reasons why operatory dealers will not likely enter the dental
laboratory market.  First, before entering, an operatory dealer must identify and cultivate a
completely different set of customers.  PFF &#182; 251(a).  Second, the dealer must invest in a stock
of artificial teeth <em>and</em> a comprehensive stock of other laboratory merchandise, because to be
competitive, laboratory dealers must offer a broad range of products.  PFF &#182; 251(b).  As
Dentsply's Mr. Clark testified, these investments are "significant" in terms of personnel and
inventory.  PFF &#182; 251(c).  Third, operatory dealers often view the tooth distribution business
as too labor intensive because it involves too many returns and requires specialized
knowledge of teeth that they do not have.  PFF &#182;253 (Sullivan Dental).  Fourth, for a number
of reasons, operatory dealers view the laboratory market as unattractive economically.  Dental
labs are viewed as notoriously poor credit risks, particularly compared to dentists, <strong>
[REDACTED TEXT]</strong> PFF &#182;251 (d)-(f).   

<p>	Accordingly, operatory dealers are competitively insignificant as potential alternative
channels of distribution.  As this Court previously held, to be viable, such operatory dealers
must have the "'actual or potential ability to deprive existing dental laboratory dealers of
significant levels of business.'"  <u>Dentsply</u>, 2001 WL 624807 at *9 (citation omitted).  Clearly
they lack that ability.  	

<p>	<em>3.  Distribution through "distributing labs" is ineffective.  </em>Vident and Ivoclar also
attempted to overcome their exclusion from a dealer network by selling teeth through
"distributing labs," dental labs that also sell teeth to competing dental labs.  PFF &#182;257. 
However, the clear consensus in the industry, <strong> [REDACTED TEXT]</strong> is that using distributing
labs is an ineffective method of selling teeth to other labs because labs do not like to buy
products from their competitors.  Id.  Moreover, the principal business of a lab is producing
dentures and other appliances, not selling teeth.  PFF &#182;33-36.  Distributing labs do not have
the size, scope or expertise in distribution to mitigate Dentsply's thorough foreclosure of
access to a real artificial tooth distribution network.

<p align="center">                                                              *     *    *

<p>	Where, as here, a firm forecloses a substantial portion of the most effective
distribution channel in an industry, and leaves its rivals such ineffective alternatives, courts
have not hesitated to condemn the exclusionary conduct.  For example, in <u>Microsoft</u>, although
Microsoft did not foreclose every software distribution channel, the Court condemned
exclusions that barred rival software manufacturers "from the cost-efficient ones" (253 F.3d at
64) and kept rivals' distribution "below the critical level necessary for [them] to pose a real
threat to Microsoft's monopoly."  <u>Id.</u> at 71.  

<p>	Likewise, in <u>United States v. VISA U.S.A., Inc.</u>, the court determined that agreements
among VISA and MasterCard member banks not to issue American Express and Discover
cards violated section 1.  163 F. Supp. 2d 322, 383, 389 (S.D.N.Y. 2001), <u>appeal pending</u>, No.
02-6074 (2d Cir.).  Even though American Express and Discover had for years issued credit
cards directly to consumers, the court held that their foreclosure from banks -- which
collectively controlled important banking assets and issued 85% of all credit and charge cards
-- harmed competition.  <u>Id.</u>  Excluding the American Express and Discover networks from
banks was anticompetitive because "[t]he member banks [were] a unique distribution source
for general purpose card products because of their expertise and experience."  <u>Id.</u> at 383.  The
court concluded that rival card networks' access to multiple, diverse bank issuers would
increase competition based on the varied skills, expertise, and customer relationships the
banks possessed, which could not be effectively duplicated by the vertically integrated rivals
or by potential alternative issuers such as insurers.  <u>Id.</u> at 382-83, 387-94; <u>see</u> <u>also</u> <u>Conwood
Co. L.P. v. United States Tobacco Co.</u>, 290 F.3d &nbsp;768, 787-88 (6th Cir. 2002) (upholding
monopolization claim where defendant excluded competition in the moist snuff market
through elimination of substantial number of rivals' sales racks and point of sale advertising,
which are important distribution and advertising avenues).

<p>	Because the alternative distribution channels left open to Dentsply's rivals are clearly
ineffective to restore competition in the artificial tooth market, Dentsply's conduct is
anticompetitive. 

<p><a name="1b1c"></a><ol><ol><ol><ol type="a" start="3"><strong><li>The At-Will Nature Of Dentsply's Dealer Criteria Does Not
Mitigate The Exclusionary Effect.</li></strong></ol></ol></ol></ol>

<p>	The technically "at-will" nature of Dentsply's dealer criteria does not make mitigate
the substantial level of foreclosure present here.  Whether Dentsply's dealer criteria violate
section 2 turns on the competitive effect, because "the Sherman Act . . . is aimed at substance
rather than form."  <u>Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp.</u>, 467 U.S. 752, 760 (1984);
<u>see</u> <u>also</u> <u>Kodak</u>, 504 U.S. 478-79 (rejecting suggested "legal presumption" inconsistent with
the facts).  Although Dealer Criterion 6 does not include a stated duration, the effect is exactly
the same as if the restriction were explicitly perpetual.   Dentsply's rivals cannot successfully
bid for or bargain away the dealers currently selling Dentsply teeth because Dealer Criterion 6
imposes an all-or-nothing choice on dealers. Under Dealer Criterion 6, if a Trubyte dealer
adds a rival's tooth line, they lose all of their Trubyte teeth. PFF &#182;180. 

<p>	Given Dentsply's monopoly market share, no dealer is willing to "walk away" from its
substantial Trubyte tooth sales to take on a competitive line of teeth with an insubstantial
market share.  No dealer has given up its Trubyte tooth business to take on a rival tooth line.
PFF &#182;179.  Dentsply's competitors have repeatedly run into a wall when attempting to
convince dealers to take on their teeth.  "Each time" Myerson has approached a dealer to
distribute Myerson teeth, the dealer has refused to give up its Trubyte line.  PFF &#182; 162.  Vident
for years tried to obtain distribution through a national tooth dealer, such as Patterson or Zahn,
but dealers declined distributing Vident teeth because the dealer cannot afford to disrupt their
relationship with Dentsply.  PFF &#182;160.  

<p>	 As the Third Circuit has made clear, an assessment of competitive effects must
consider this "competitive context of the industry" and "'relative strength of the parties'." 
<u>Am. Motor Inns</u>, 521 F.2d at 1252 (quoting <u>Tampa Elec.</u>, 365 U.S. at 329).  Numerous cases
have acknowledged the effective perpetual exclusivity of similar at-will restrictions imposed
by dominant firms.  <u>See</u>, <u>e.g.</u>, <u>Lorain Journal</u>, 342 U.S. at 152-53 (monopolist publisher's
"refusal to print [newspaper] advertising for those using [a local radio station to advertise]
often amounted to an effective prohibition of the use of the [radio station] for that purpose");
<u>3M</u>, 35 F. Supp.2d at 1144 (rejecting the argument that at-will agreements are lawful <em>per se,
</em>where the defendant's high market share and customer preference prevented switching to
rivals as a practical effect); <u>VISA</u>, 163 F. Supp. 2d at 382 ("Because of the defendants'
exclusionary rules [prohibiting VISA and Mastercard member banks from issuing rival credit
cards] American Express and Discover have not been able to convince U.S. banks to issue
cards over their networks.  This prevents them from competing in the network services market
for the business of bank issuers.").<a href="#N_21_"><sup>(21)</sup></a> <ins></ins>

<p>Accordingly, given Dentsply's monopoly power, its foreclosure of all of the most
effective dealers in the country is powerful evidence of the anticompetitive nature of its
conduct.  There are no viable alternative channels available for rivals to challenge Dentsply's
monopoly power.

<p><a name="1b2"></a><ol><ol><ol type="1" start="2"><strong><li>Dentsply's Exclusive Arrangements Have Caused Substantial
Anticompetitive Effects.</li></strong></ol></ol></ol>


<p>	Although the degree of foreclosure caused by a restraint is an indicator of the
"probable" or "likely" anticompetitive effects (<u>Tampa Elec.</u>, 365 U.S. at 327), here there is
also direct evidence of <em>actual</em> anticompetitive effects.  The high degree of foreclosure
attributable to Dentsply's exclusive dealing arrangements has not only contributed
significantly to maintaining its monopoly power, it has frustrated consumer preferences and
enabled Dentsply to keep prices and quality at non-competitive levels.  <u>See</u> <u>Aspen</u>, 472 U.S. at
605 &amp; n.32.  The direct evidence of these anticompetitive effects, by itself, establishes that
Dentsply is a monopolist.  It also establishes that Dentsply's conduct is exclusionary.  <u>See</u>
<u>Brown Univ.</u>, 5 F.3d at 668 (citing <u>IFD</u>, 476 U.S. at 460-61); <u>Re/Max</u>, 173 F.3d at 1016.

<p><a name="1b2a"></a><ol><ol><ol><ol type="a"><strong><li>Frustration Of Consumer Preferences.</li></strong></ol></ol></ol></ol> 

<p>	Dentsply's exclusionary conduct is anticompetitive because it has frustrated consumer
preferences.  Dentsply has intervened and stopped many dealers from selling competitive
teeth, including the largest and most effective dealers in the industry.  PFF &#182;265, 268.  These
dealers were increasing the sales of rival brands, satisfying consumer demand.  PFF &#182;268.
Dentsply's conduct restricts the availability of teeth that consumers want to buy through
dealers, the distribution channel consumers prefer.  <u>See</u> <u>IFD</u>, 476 U.S. at 457 (condemning
conduct that "resulted in the denial of information customers requested in the form they
requested it, and forced them to choose between acquiring that information in a more costly
manner or forgoing it altogether").<a href="#N_22_"><sup>(22)</sup></a>

<p>	Dentsply's conduct has deprived many consumers of the teeth they want.  For
example, dental laboratories have routinely used Dentsply teeth despite receiving prescriptions
for Vita-shaded teeth.  PFF &#182;270-272.  Even before Dentsply developed its Portrait tooth,
which inexactly copied Vita shades, 72% of prescriptions specifying Vita shades were
switched by labs to Dentsply teeth.  PFF &#182; 272.  Unlike Vita, Dentsply teeth were available
through the dealer network. <u>Id</u>.  Indeed, Dentsply's former tooth products manager
acknowledged that when a lab used Dentsply's Bioform IPN tooth to fill a prescription for a
Vita shade (as was common), the lab used a more expensive tooth that did not match the
prescribed shade as well.  <u>Id</u>. <a href="#N_23_"><sup>(23)</sup></a>  During this same period, many consumers considered Vita
and Ivoclar teeth aesthetically superior to Dentsply's teeth. <u>Id</u>.  And, as discussed below,
Dentsply's teeth were 10%-15% higher priced.  Dentsply's ability to maintain its high prices
for so long, while offering teeth many considered to be inferior and which did not match the
most popular shade guide in the industry, is a serious source of competitive harm.  <u>See</u> <u>Brown
Univ.</u>, 5 F.3d at 668 (reduction in quality is an anticompetitive effect) (citing <u>Tunis Bros. Cos.
v. Ford Motor Co.</u>, 952 F.2d 715, 728 (3d Cir. 1991)).  It also confirms Dentsply's monopoly
power.  <u>See</u> <u>Andrx</u>, 256 F.3d at 814.

<p>	The consumer harm caused by Dentsply's conduct is confirmed by the market share
shift in favor of rival teeth that Dentsply executives concede would occur in the absence of
Dealer Criterion 6. PFF &#182;266 (Miles Tr. 3513; Clark Tr. 2584; Brennan Tr. 1718).  Three
separate analyses of the Wind survey -- by Dr. Wind, Dr. Reitman, and by Dentsply's expert,
Dr. Rossi --  all confirm what Dentsply's executives have acknowledged, showing that the
market shares of Dentsply's rivals would increase substantially with dealer access.  PFF &#182;

<p>	In the absence of Dealer Criterion 6, dealers would add competing brands, labs would
buy more of those brands, and Dentsply's market share would fall.  PFF &#182; 266. The fact that
Dentsply's rivals would gain market share with access to dealers means that consumers would
buy more of the rivals' teeth if they could get them through dealers, which, currently, they
cannot do. PFF &#182;271. It is therefore direct evidence of consumer harm. Id.  This harm will
continue if Dentsply's anticompetitive conduct is not enjoined.  Vita has introduced a new 3D
shade guide system and teeth, and Ivoclar has introduced a revolutionary new tooth. PFF &#182;
274. The lack of dealer distribution that has historically induced labs to use Dentsply teeth,
irrespective of the quality of rival products, will persist if Dentsply's exclusionary conduct
continues.

<p><a name="1b2b"></a><ol><ol><ol><ol type="a" start="2"><strong><li>Supracompetitive Prices.</li></strong></ol></ol></ol></ol>

<p>	Dentsply's conduct is also anticompetitive because it has caused tooth prices to remain
artificially high.  Such supracompetitive pricing is additional direct evidence of
anticompetitive effects.  <u>See</u> <u>Brown Univ.</u>, 5 F.3d at 668. 

<p>	Dentsply's pricing control, including its high margins and profits, suggest that it has
imposed a serious barrier to free competition in the artificial tooth market.  <u>See</u> Section I.A.1.  
In the absence of Dentsply's exclusionary conduct, prices will fall because consumers will
become more price sensitive once multiple brands become available through the dealer
distribution channel consumers prefer. PFF &#182; 275.  This will produce more competition
between tooth manufacturers, resulting in lower prices.<u>Id</u>.

<p>	The survey of dental laboratories conducted by Dr. Wind confirms this intuitive
conclusion.  Based on the survey, Dr. Reitman estimated that, without Dealer Criterion 6, the
average price for premium artificial teeth would fall 4% -5% in just three months. PFF &#182;278. 
Market-wide price reductions would likely be even more significant in the long term than the
price effects shown by analysis of the survey. PFF &#182;280. The survey measured only the short-term effect of making rivals' teeth available through dental dealers. <u>Id</u>.   In the long run, dental
labs will have time to change the brands of teeth they have in stock, communicate to dentists
the availability of the competing brands, and provide additional training to their technicians in
the use of the other brands of teeth. <u>Id.</u>

<p>	Tooth manufacturers, including Dentsply, uniformly confirmed that this analysis is
correct.  Where firms have adequate dealer distribution, they have an incentive to lower prices
because the lower prices can increase sales.  PFF &#182;276.  Also, they have increased incentives
to promote more.  PFF &#182; 281-82.  However, where firms do not have dealer distribution, there
is no incentive to lower prices, and reduced incentives to engage in promotion, because
increased sales do not follow.  PFF &#182;275, 281-82.<a href="#N_25_"><sup>(25)</sup></a>  Accordingly, there is direct evidence of
adverse price effects caused by Dentsply's conduct. 

<p>	Dentsply's conduct has also raised prices indirectly, by increasing the costs of dental
laboratory dealers.  Dentsply's exclusionary conduct has caused dealers selling Trubyte teeth
to be less efficient than they would have been without Dealer Criterion 6.  Several dealers
have attempted to add rival lines of teeth and, if they had done so, they would have achieved
greater economies of scale by spreading their fixed costs over more units of sales.  PFF &#182;284. 
By limiting the efficiency of dealers, Dentsply has raised their costs, which will be passed on
to consumers.  This increase in costs has also led some dealers to close tooth counters that
otherwise would have been economical to keep open, thereby reducing consumer choice.  <u>Id.</u>
Accordingly, there is direct evidence of adverse price effects and consumer harm caused by
Dentsply's conduct.  

<p><a name="1b3"></a><ol><ol><ol type="1" start="3"><strong><li>Dentsply's Exclusionary Intent Confirms The Anticompetitive
Nature Of Its Conduct.</li></strong></ol></ol></ol>

<p>	Dentsply's exclusionary intent is abundantly clear and directly "relevant to the
question whether the challenged conduct is fairly characterized as 'exclusionary' or
'anticompetitive.'" <u>Aspen Skiing</u>, 472 U.S. at 602; <u>Chicago Bd. of Trade v. United States</u>, 246
U.S. 231, 238 (1918).  While it is not necessary to prove intent, "knowledge of intent may
help the court to interpret facts and to predict consequences."  <u>Microsoft</u>, 253 F.3d at 59.  

<p>	The <em>express</em> <em>purpose</em> of Dealer Criterion 6 was anticompetitive.  A high-level Dentsply
document titled "Sales/Distribution Principles for Cash Cow Business" identified Dealer
Criterion 6 as one of five principles for running the Trubyte tooth business, and stated that its
purpose was to:

<p><ul><li>		Block competitive distribution points.  Do not allow competition to
achieve toeholds in dealers.


<p><ul type="disc"><li>			Tie-up dealers


<p><li>			Do not "free up" <u>key</u> players.</ul></ul>

<p>PFF &#182;231.  The document sets forth the sales and distribution principles under which
Dentsply's tooth business operated.  PFF &#182;232.  

<p>	Top Dentsply representatives have also elaborated on the exclusionary purpose of
Dealer Criterion 6.  Dentsply's Chief Executive Officer, Burt Borgelt, explained to Tom
Cavanaugh of Frink Dental that Dentsply would terminate Frink for taking on the Ivoclar line
because "we cannot let Ivoclar get a foothold in the United States.  This is our most highly
profitable product out of our Dentsply division." PFF &#182;233.  According to Gordon Hagler,
Trubyte's Director of Sales and Marketing from 1989-93 , the sole purpose of the policy was
to exclude Dentsply's competitors from the dealers. PFF &#182;234.

<p>	Dentpsly's actions also confirm its exclusionary intent.  Dentsply routinely used
Trubyte merchandise as additional leverage to coerce dealers to agree not to add competing
tooth brands.  For example, Dentsply terminated Trinity Dental as a Trubyte merchandise
dealer in 1993 when Trinity decided to add the Vita tooth line, even though Trinity did not sell
Trubyte teeth. PFF &#182;235. This application of Dealer Criterion 6 belies Dentsply's contention
that it enforced Dealer Criterion 6 to prevent free-riding by rivals on Trubyte's tooth business
because Trinity had no tooth business.  PFF &#182; 235(c). There is no suggestion that Trinity's
distribution of <em>Vita</em> <em>teeth</em> would affect its distribution of <em>Trubyte</em> <em>merchandise.  </em>Indeed<em>, </em>Dealer
Criterion 6 does not mention merchandise.  Rather, the only explanation for Dentsply's
conduct is that it aimed to foreclose a Vita distribution point. PFF &#182;235(d).  Likewise,
Dentsply terminated Frink as a Trubyte merchandise dealer when Frink took on Ivoclar teeth,
not because Dentsply believed that Frink would not be an ineffective merchandise dealer after
adding the Ivoclar tooth line, but because Dentsply "wanted to make a strong point." PFF
&#182;236(a).  When DLDS sought to add the Universal and Vita tooth lines, Dentsply threatened it
with the loss of not only the Trubyte tooth line but its merchandise business as well.  PFF &#182;
236(b).

<p>	Similarly, Dentsply has recognized dealers, including ones it previously rejected, in
part to block distribution points for its rivals.  PFF &#182;237-40.  Dentsply recognized Jan Dental
as a Trubyte tooth dealer and required Jan to stop selling Vita, Kenson, Dentorium and Justi
teeth in part to "eliminate several competitors." PFF &#182; 237. In 1994, after Dentsply had turned
down Darby's request to sell Trubyte based on having adequate distribution in Darby's area,
Dentsply authorized Darby as a Trubyte tooth dealer.  Dentsply did so upon learning that
Darby was contemplating distributing Vita teeth. PFF &#182;238.  Robert Brennan, the former head
of the Trubyte division, acknowledged that Dentsply recognized Darby as a tooth dealer
"because it prevented Vita from getting a dealer." PFF &#182;238(f) .  Dentsply engaged in the
same conduct with DTS, recognizing DTS as a tooth dealer in 1995 <strong> [REDACTED TEXT]</strong>	

<p>Finally, the anticompetitive purpose of Dealer Criterion 6 is also apparent from its
overbreadth.  Dentsply prevents a dealer selling Trubyte teeth at some, but not all, of its
locations from adding a competing line at <em>any</em> of its locations.  PFF &#182;241.  For example,
despite the fact that Patterson Dental does not stock artificial teeth at all of its locations,
Dentsply enforces Dealer Criterion 6 to prohibit Patterson from adding rival teeth at locations
where it does not currently stock teeth. <u>Id</u>.  Dentsply's free-riding justification does not
explain this overbroad application of the criterion because no free riding is possible at
locations where Trubyte teeth are not sold.  The sole justification for such an overbroad
requirement is to foreclose Dentsply's rivals from as many distribution outlets as possible.

<p>	Accordingly, Dentsply's exclusionary intent confirms the anticompetitive nature of its
conduct.

<p><a name="2"></a><ol type="I" start="2"><strong><li>Dentsply Has Violated Section 1 Of The Sherman Act And Section 3 Of The Clayton Act.</li></strong></ol>


<p>	Dentsply's exclusive agreements with dental laboratory dealers also violate<strong> </strong>section 1
of the Sherman Act and section 3 of the Clayton Act.  Section 1 makes unlawful "[e]very
contract . . . in restraint of trade."<a href="#N_26_"><sup>(26)</sup></a>  Section 3 prohibits sales "on the condition, agreement or
understanding" that the lessee or purchaser not use or deal in the goods of a competitor, where
the effect is "to substantially lessen competition."<a href="#N_27_"><sup>(27)</sup></a> 

<p>	The agreement elements of sections 1 and 3 are easily satisfied.  The evidence
establishing Dentsply's violation of section 2 also establishes that Dentsply's  conduct
restrains trade and lessens competition.  Indeed, because "significant market power is enough
to trigger section 1's rule of reason approach" for evaluating whether a restraint is
2anticompetitive , and "something less than monopoly power is required . . . under . . . [the]
'substantially lessen competition' test" of the Clayton Act (<u>Fraser</u>, 284 F.3d at 60 n.9), the
existence of monopoly power here makes plain that Dentsply's conduct is anticompetitive
under either provision.  <u>See</u> <u>Brown Univ.</u>, 5 F.3d at 668  ("courts typically allow proof of the
defendant's 'market power' instead" of proof of actual "market effects").  Even absent the
compelling evidence of Dentsply's monopoly power in this case (discussed above), the very
high degree of foreclosure and the direct evidence of anticompetitive effects resulting from
that foreclosure establish that Dentsply's exclusive agreements are unreasonable restraints of
trade.  <u>See</u> <u>id.</u> at 668-69 (because "[m]arket power . . . is essentially a 'surrogate for
detrimental effects,' . . . plaintiff may satisfy [its] burden by showing actual anticompetitive
effects") (quoting <u>IFD</u>, 476 U.S. at 460- 61); <u>see</u> <u>also</u> <u>Microsoft</u>, 253 F.3d at 70; <u>Orson</u>, 79

<p><a name="2a"></a><ol><ol type="A"><strong><li>Dentsply's Exclusionary Agreements With Artificial Tooth Dealers Are Agreements Within The Meaning Of Sections 1 and 3.</li></strong></ol></ol>


<p>	An agreement under section 1 of the Sherman Act and section 3 of the Clayton Act can
be either express or implied, and can be established by direct or circumstantial evidence,
including evidence of a course of conduct.  <u>See</u> <u>United States v. General Motors Corp.</u>, 384
U.S. 127, 142-43 (1966) ("it has long been settled that explicit agreement is not a necessary
part of a Sherman Act conspiracy"); <u>United States v. Parke, Davis &amp; Co.</u>, 362 U.S. 29, 44
(1960); <u>Alvord-Polk, Inc. v. F. Schumaker &amp; Co.</u>, 37 F.3d 996, 1000 (3d Cir. 1994).<a href="#N_28_"><sup>(28)</sup></a>  It is not
necessary that each of the parties share the same motive, so long as the agreement produces an
anticompetitive effect.  <u>See</u> <u>Parke, Davis</u>, 362 U.S. at 45; <u>Fineman</u>, 980 F.2d at 213.  Such
concerted action "is fraught with competitive risk" because it "not only reduces the diverse
directions in which economic power is aimed but suddenly increases the economic power
moving in one particular direction."  <u>Alvord-Polk</u>, 37 F.3d at 1000. 

<p>	There is direct evidence that Dealer Criterion 6 is an express agreement between
Dentsply and its dealers.  Dentsply considers Dealer Criterion 6 to be an agreement between
Dentsply and its dealers selling Trubyte teeth.  PFF &#182;287.  According to Christopher Clark, the
former head of Dentsply's Trubyte Division, dealers must "agree to the Trubyte dealer
criteria" in order to be recognized as an authorized tooth dealer. PFF &#182;287.  Dentsply
executives informed Tom Cavanaugh of Frink Dental that he "had an agreement with them
that [Frink] would only carry their line."  Carl Uthus, Trubyte's Director of Sales,
characterized the dealer criteria as "our current dealer contract" and "our agreement." PFF &#182;
287.    Likewise, Dentsply's dealers consider the dealer criteria to represent an agreement with
Dentsply and have consistently characterized it as such.  PFF &#182;288  <strong> [REDACTED TEXT]</strong>

<p>	Indeed, Dentsply entered into express agreements with several dealers when it first
recognized them.  Dentsply has required dealers to agree expressly to drop some, or all, of
their competing tooth lines in order to obtain the Trubyte line. PFF &#182;293.   (<u>e.g.</u>, GX 24 ("Jan
Dental has agreed to carry only Trubyte and Universal tooth brands."); GX 26 ("Per the terms
of our agreement, all except Universal would be eliminated."); GX 158 and GX 77 (regarding
the conditions imposed on Darby to be recognized, including not adding the Vita tooth line)).

<p>	Even if this evidence did not uniformly establish that Dentsply sought and received
express agreements from its distributors at the outset, the agreement element is satisfied based
on the course of conduct between Dentsply and its dealers.  Dentsply has "go[ne] beyond mere
announcement of [its] policy and the simple refusal to deal, and [has] employ[ed] other means
which effect adherence."  <u>Parke, Davis</u>, 362 U.S. at 44; <u>see</u> <u>also</u> <u>Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite
Serv. Corp.</u>, 465 U.S. 752, 765-66 (1984).  An announced policy, accompanied by threats of
termination, active surveillance, and reinstatement conditioned on assurances of future
compliance, is sufficient to establish an agreement.  <u>See</u> <u>id.</u>; <u>see also</u> <u>Monsanto</u>, 465 U.S. at
765-66 (agreement element satisfied based in part on individualized dealings with dealers
where the manufacturer complained to non-compliant dealer's parent company and dealer
later "informed Monsanto that it would charge the suggested price"); <u>Baker's Carpet Gallery,
Inc. v. Mohawk Indus., Inc.</u>, 942 F. Supp. 1464, 1477-79 (N.D. Ga. 1996).<a href="#N_29_"><sup>(29)</sup></a>  

<p>	Dentsply has gone beyond a mere announcement of its dealer criteria and its intent to
terminate violators.  It actively monitored compliance and, when Dentsply detected a
violation, it engaged in individualized negotiations with the dealer to obtain compliance. PFF
&#182;289.   For example, when Frink started selling rival teeth, Dentsply sent high-level
executives to meet with Frink's president, terminated Frink after the company began to sell
Ivoclar teeth, threatened Frink with the loss of Dentsply merchandise, then reinstated Frink
after the company agreed to drop the Ivoclar line. PFF &#182;290.   Likewise, Dentsply negotiated
for over a year with Darby Dental to convince Darby to drop the Vita tooth stock it acquired
as part of its acquisition of DTS, which Darby ultimately agreed to do. PFF &#182; 291.  In response
to Dentsply's negotiations with dealers and threats of termination, Dentsply received
assurances of future compliance from its dealers. PFF &#182; 292.

<p>	These incidents of individualized negotiation, threats of termination, and assurances of
compliance, go far beyond the permissible announcement of a unilateral policy and refusal to
deal.  <u>See</u>, <u>e.g.</u>, <u>Parke, Davis</u>, 362 U.S. at 45-46 (evidence that manufacturer individually
negotiated with non-compliant retailers, that one retailer informed manufacturer it would
comply with policy, and retailer complied, is enough to establish an agreement); <u>Monsanto</u>,
465 U.S. at 765-66 (involving individualized dealings with dealers where in one instance the
manufacturer complained to non-compliant dealer's parent company, threatened to cut off
supply "when herbicide was in short supply" so that it could "use supply as a lever to force
compliance," and the dealer later "informed Monsanto that it would charge the suggested
price").  Accordingly, the evidence easily satisfies the agreement element.

<a name="2b"></a><ol><ol type="A" start="2"><strong><li>Dentsply's Exclusive Dealing Agreements Have Unreasonably Restrained Competition.</li></strong></ol></ol>


<p>	Under section 1, a "rule of reason" analysis applies to those restraints that are not <u><em>per

fact-finder to "'weigh [ ] all of the circumstances of a case in deciding whether a restrictive

plaintiff may satisfy its burden by proving market power as a "surrogate" for effects.  <u>Id.</u> 
Accordingly, proof of either market power <em>or </em>actual anticompetitive effects can,
independently, establish a violation of section 1.  <u>See</u>&nbsp;<u>id.</u>

<p>	 Where challenged conduct involves exclusive dealing, the foreclosure rate also is 
relevant to whether there are "likely" or "probable" adverse effects.  <u>See</u> text, <u>supra</u> &#167;I.B.1. 
Courts have "routinely condemned" foreclosure of 40%-50% of the market to rival firms.  <u>See</u>
text, <u>supra</u> &#167;I.B.1.  Where there is substantial market power, as in this case, the foreclosure
showing can be far less for conduct to be deemed anticompetitive.  <u>See</u> <u>id.</u>  Dentsply's
conduct has foreclosed a far-higher percentage of the market than 50%.  <u>See</u> <u>id.</u>

<p>	Dentsply's monopoly power and substantial foreclosure of competition point to
"likely" and "probable" serious competitive harm.  In many cases, that evidence alone would
suffice as a "surrogate" for actual adverse effects.  <u>See</u> <u>Brown Univ.</u>, 5 F.3d at 668-69. 
However, here there is <em>direct</em> evidence of anticompetitive effects.  Dentsply's exclusive
agreements with dental dealers have restricted the availability of teeth that consumers want to
buy, thereby keeping its own market share artificially high and interfering with consumer
preferences for brand and distribution channel; raised prices, restricted the availability of its
rivals' aesthetically superior teeth; and caused dealers selling Trubyte teeth to be less efficient
than they would have been without Dealer Criterion 6, raising prices for consumers.  <u>See</u> text,
<u>supra</u><em> </em>&#167;I.B.2.  

<p>	Accordingly, Dentsply has violated section 1 of the Sherman Act and section 3 of the
Clayton Act.

procompetitive, it is rebutted by the evidence "that the restraint is not reasonably necessary to
achieve the stated objective." <u>Brown</u>, 5 F.3d at 669.  Moreover, the justification is far
outweighed by the anticompetitive harm.

<p><a name="3a"></a><ol><ol type="A"><strong><li>Dentsply Has The Burden Of Showing That Its Exclusionary Conduct

<p>	Dentsply must show not only that its exclusionary policies have procompetitive
benefits, but also that each of those benefits are valid and sufficient.  <u>Kodak</u>, 504 U.S. at 483. 
Under a rule of reason analysis, the evidence of Dentsply's supracompetitive prices and
exclusion of competition places upon Dentsply "a heavy burden of establishing an <em>affirmative
defense</em> which competitively justifies this apparent deviation from the operations of a free
market."<a href="#N_31_"><sup>(31)</sup></a>  <u>NCAA v. Bd. of Regents</u>, 468 U.S. 85, 113 (1984) (emphasis added).  Dentsply's
procompetitive justification must be a "nonpretextual claim that its conduct is indeed a form
of competition on the merits because it involves, for example, greater efficiency or enhanced
consumer appeal."  <u>Microsoft</u>, 253 F.3d at 59.

<p>	Dentsply has failed to meet its burden here to show that its claimed justification for its
exclusive dealing practices is both (1) nonpretextual, and (2) sufficiently procompetitive. 
Dentsply has provided no evidence to support such a finding.  Moreover, the United States'
expert, Dr. Reitman, conducted a detailed examination of the record and gave thorough
consideration of Dentsply's alleged justifications to determine whether Dentsply's exclusive
dealing has any procompetitive benefit.  He concluded that any procompetitive benefit is
negligible.<a href="#N_32_"><sup>(32)</sup></a>
<p>  PFF &#182; 328.  By contrast, Dentsply's expert, Dr. Marvel, has done no empirical

<p><a name="3a1"></a><ol><ol><ol><strong><li>Dentsply Has Failed To Demonstrate That Its Alleged Business
Justifications Are Nonpretextual.</li></strong></ol></ol></ol>


<p>	Dentsply's business justification -- that exclusive dealing prevents free riding on
Dentsply's promotional efforts -- is belied by the evidence showing that is not the motive
Dentsply's exclusionary conduct.  Dentsply's motive has been to exclude competitors and
protect its monopoly, and its purported justifications for its conduct have been inconsistent. 
Accordingly, Dentsply has failed to surmount the initial hurdle that its claimed business
justification is nonpretextual.<a href="#N_33_"><sup>(33)</sup></a>  <u>See</u> <u>Microsoft</u>, 253 F.3d at 59.

<p>	First, Dentsply's justification should be rejected based on evidence of its exclusionary
motives.  The evidence "makes it less likely that the free rider problem was really uppermost
in the minds of defendants' executives."  <u>Brokers' Assistant, Inc. v. Williams Real Estate Co.</u>,
646 F. Supp. 1110, 1120 n.38 (S.D.N.Y. 1986).  Here, the  evidence establishes that what was
"uppermost" in the minds of Dentsply's executives was not a concern over free riding, but an
intent to "block competitive distribution points" and prevent its closest competitors from
gaining a "foothold" in the U.S. market.  <u>See</u> text, <u>supra</u> &#167; I.B.3.  The contemporaneous
evidence demonstrating that Dentsply's "real" motive behind Dealer Criterion 6 was to restrict
competition shows that the claimed justification is pretextual, not procompetitive.  <u>VISA</u>, 163
F. Supp.2d at 400-402.

<p>	Second, the inconsistencies and contrasts between the internal and public explanations
of Dentsply's conduct support the conclusion that its claimed justification is pretextual. 
<u>Alvord-Polk</u>, 37 F.3d at 1010-13.  Despite this evidence of Dentsply's express exclusionary
intent, Dentsply has asserted a shifting series of purported justifications both at and before
trial and in its business dealings.  In responding to an interrogatory during the investigation
that preceded this litigation, Dentsply explicitly set forth a rationale for its exclusionary
arrangements that is different from the rationale it asserts now.  Dentsply stated:

<p><blockquote>	In Dentsply's experience, the greater the number of competing tooth lines carried, the
less likely that a dealer will be able to sustain all of the desired service and
promotional elements at a high, competitive level.  In short, service and promotional
support for a particular line is likely to suffer the greater the number of lines carried. 
Recognizing the need for dealers to focus their efforts in order to effectively promote
the company's teeth and service laboratory customers, the company formalized criteria
in February 1993 for dealers to meet in order to be Trubyte teeth dealers.  One of these
criteria is that dealers that are recognized as authorized distributors of Trubyte teeth
cannot add additional lines of teeth after becoming a Trubyte dealer.</blockquote>


<p>PFF &#182;332 .  In the past, before its expert filed a report in this case, Dentsply has proferred this
"focus dealer services" rationale as its justification for Dealer Criterion 6.  The rationale was
given by the Dentsply executive responsible for promulgating the dealer criteria.  PFF &#182;333.
At times, Dentsply still uses the same rationale when communicating Dealer Criterion 6 and
the policy supporting it to the marketplace.<a href="#N_34_"><sup>(34)</sup></a>  PFF &#182;333.  

<p>	This  "focus dealer services" rationale is inconsistent with Dr. Marvel's efficiency
theory in this case, as Dr. Marvel himself concedes.<a href="#N_35_"><sup>(35)</sup></a>  PFF &#182;336.  <em>Dr. Marvel's</em> theory
attempting to support Dentsply's exclusionary conduct is based on his notion that Dentsply's
marketing brings customers to the dealer, and if dealers can "bait and switch" the customers to
a rival product, the rival can free ride on the Dentsply's promotional investment.  DX. 1671-D.  Dentsply's prior explanations for Dealer Criterion 6, and its marketplace conduct,
including its conduct in enforcing the criterion, are inconsistent with its claimed justification
here.  <u>See</u> text, <u>supra</u> &#167;I.B.3.  This evidence makes plain that Dentsply's most recent version
of its business justification is pretextual.  <u>See</u> <u>Alvord-Polk</u>, 37 F.3d at 1012.  Accordingly,
Dentsply has failed to meet its threshold burden.

<p><a name="3a2"></a><ol><ol><ol type="1" start="2"><strong><li>Dentsply Has Failed to Demonstrate That Its Alleged Business

<p>	Dentsply also has failed to demonstrate that is has "valid business reasons" for its
exclusionary policies.  <u>Kodak</u>, 504 U.S. at 483 (citing <u>Aspen</u>, 472 U.S. at 605).  To meet this
standard, Dentsply must prove that "it was in fact pursuing its goals as a rational economic
actor and [can] justify its conduct by reference to rational, procompetitive economic
principles."  <u>Flegel v. Christian Hosp.</u>, 4 F.3d 682, 688 n.4 (8th Cir. 1993).  Such a showing
must consist of more than unsupported assertions.  <u>Id.</u>  Procompetitive justifications must be
more than theoretical or speculative.  "[M]erely offering a rationale for a vertical restraint will
not suffice; the record must support a finding that the restraint in fact is necessary to enhance
competition and does indeed have a procompetitive effect."  <u>Graphic Prods. Distribs., Inc. v.
ITEK Corp.</u>, 717 F.2d 1560, 1576 (11th Cir. 1983); <u>cf.</u> <u>H.J. Heinz Co.</u>, 246 F.3d at 721 (in a
merger case where parties have high market concentration levels, "the court must undertake a
rigorous analysis of the kinds of efficiencies being urged by the parties in order to ensure that
those 'efficiencies' represent more than mere speculation and promises").

Artificial Tooth Market and Is Unsupported by the Facts.</li></strong></ol></ol></ol></ol>


<p>	Dr. Marvel claims that consumers have benefitted from Dentsply's exclusive dealing
because, by protecting its promotional investments from free riding, exclusive dealing
encourages market expansion through promotional activity by Dentsply, such as promotion
under the Denture Opportunity Program and to dental schools.  PFF &#182;340.  However, Dr.
Marvel conceded, and Dr. Reitman agrees, that Dr. Marvel's theory does not apply to this type
of promotion, and the two economic experts agree also that Dentsply does not need exclusive
dealing at the dealer level to protect promotion to dentists and consumers.  PFF &#182;340; <u>see</u>
<u>VISA</u>, 163 F. Supp.2d at 404 (where there is "no asset on which free-riding could occur"
exclusionary policies are unnecessary).  Dr. Marvel's remaining efficiency claim is based
merely on theoretical expectations, not empirical analysis, and it is not supported by the facts. 
PFF &#182;341. Indeed, Dr. Marvel ignored a number of opportunities to investigate the record
facts in order to test his theory rather than simply speculate.  PFF &#182;341(b).  Where, as here, an
economic expert offers no empirical analysis to support his position, his opinion is "based on
a cursory examination of the facts," and his testimony is "belied by the uncontradicted record
evidence," his justifications do not withstand scrutiny.<a href="#N_36_"><sup>(36)</sup></a>  <u>See</u> <u>VISA</u>, 163 F. Supp.2d at 402;
<u>accord</u>, <u>Elcock v.KMart Corp.</u>, 233 F.3d 734, 756  (3d Cir. 2000).

<p>	An essential element of Dr. Marvel's free-riding theory is that dealers will actively
"bait and switch" laboratory customers to steer them from one tooth brand carried by the
dealer to another.  PFF &#182;343 (e.g., DX. 1671-D).  There is "zero evidence" in the record,
however, that dealers, in fact, have or will do so. PFF &#182; 343, 348.  Dealers are more interested
in satisfying existing consumer demand and concerned about alienating customers than in
actively steering their lab customers from one brand to another.  PFF &#182;343-46.  Numerous
dealers testified that they do not attempt to steer a lab ordering a particular tooth to order
another brand.<a href="#N_37_"><sup>(37)</sup></a>  PFF &#182;344.  In addition, Dentsply's primary competitors testified that they do
not require or encourage dealers to steer labs, and the labs themselves agree that dealers do not
attempt to determine or influence their choice of brands.  PFF &#182; 345.  Dr. Marvel
acknowledged that the non-exclusive dealers that carry both Dentsply teeth and the teeth of
Dentsply's rivals, under the grandfathering provision of Dealer Criterion 6, would be a good
test of his theory, but he failed to investigate whether those dealers were engaged in steering.<a href="#N_38_"><sup>(38)</sup></a>
PFF &#182;&#182;341 (b)(ii), 348.  There is no evidence in the record indicating that Dentsply's non-exclusive tooth dealers have, in the past, actively steered their lab customers from Dentsply
teeth to grandfathered rival brands.<a href="#N_39_"><sup>(39)</sup></a>  PFF &#182;&#182;348-49.  Although Dr. Marvel pointed to the
Frink episode as his primary example of bait and switch steering, the facts do not support that
conclusion.  Among other facts, when Frink sold both brands of teeth, its sales of Trubyte
teeth actually increased over the level of sales when Trubyte was the sole brand Frink carried. 
PFF &#182;&#182;347(a).  In any event, Dr. Marvel's theory does not apply to Frink in the first place
because Frink had been terminated by Dentsply  and knew it would not be able to sell
Dentsply teeth for much longer, so it was simply trying to preserve its customers in order to
survive.  PFF &#182; 347(a). Where there is no evidence of the harm that Dentsply's exclusionary
policies allegedly protect against -- here, dealer steering -- defendant's procompetitive
justifications are not persuasive.  <u>See</u> <u>VISA</u>, 163 F. Supp.2d at 403-04.     

<p>	The second essential element of Dr. Marvel's theory is that Dentsply must charge a
price premium greater than that charged by its rivals because it spends more on promotions. 
PFF &#182;350.  Dentsply has failed to sustain its burden to show that it spends proportionately
more on sales and advertising than its rivals; indeed, the evidence shows that Dentsply does
not need to charge a price premium because it in fact spends proportionately <em>less</em> than its
rivals.  PFF &#182;350-353.  In addition, the evidence from Dentsply's own employees and the
dealers consistently shows that the level and effectiveness of Dentsply's promotional,
advertising, and educational efforts fall far short of what Dentsply claimed at trial.  PFF &#182;354-64.  Conversely, the facts show that Dentsply's competitors, when given the opportunity to
compete through dealers, do not free ride on existing dealer business, but instead actively
promote their products to labs and dentists.  PFF &#182;365-69.

<p>	Third, Dr. Marvel and Dr. Reitman agree that "purely brand specific" promotions, as
defined by Dr. Marvel in his 1982 paper on exclusive dealing, also are not susceptible to
steering and thus are not subject here to free riding.  PFF &#182;370, 372 (e.g. DX 1666 at 8
(Howard P. Marvel, "Exclusive Dealing", 25 <u>J. L. &amp; Econ.</u> 1 (1982))).  For these types of
promotions, such as Dentsply's "add-a-drawer" and Portrait sticker programs, there is "no
asset on which free-riding could occur," and no support in the record for Dentsply's
contention that its exclusionary policies are necessary to prevent free riding on them.  PFF &#182;
371; <u>see</u> <u>VISA</u>, 163 F. Supp.2d at 404.  To the extent that Dr. Marvel now contends that
exclusive dealing is necessary to protect <em>branded</em> promotions, he has admitted that this claim
is based merely on theoretical expectations and not empirical analysis. PFF &#182;341.

<p>	Accordingly, the record belies Dentsply's primary purported justification for its
exclusionary policies.  <u>See</u> <u>VISA</u>, 163 F.Supp. at 405; <u>Flegel</u>, 4 F.3d at 688 n.4.


<p><a name="3a2b"></a><ol><ol><ol><ol type="a" start="2"><strong><li>Dentsply's Business Justification Theory Is Inconsistent
With Its Overall Conduct In Both The Artificial Tooth And
Dental Laboratory Product Markets.</li></strong></ol></ol></ol></ol>		

<p>	Dentsply's claimed justification for imposing its exclusionary policies in the artificial
tooth market is flatly inconsistent with its policy regarding other dental laboratory products
and its treatment of nonexclusive dealers with grandfathered tooth brands.  To meet its burden
of demonstrating procompetitive effects, Dentsply must show that from the "totality of
circumstances, [its] articulated procompetitive rationale is consistent with [its] overall
conduct."  <u>Flegel</u>, 4 F.3d at 688 n.4.  Dentsply's confliciting conduct demonstrates that it has
failed to do so.

<p>	First, there is no evidence that Dentsply has applied exclusive dealing to dental
laboratory products other than teeth, such as acrylics, waxes, and related products, despite the
fact that Dr. Marvel's theory is more applicable to some of these other products (such as
Dentsply's Lucitone acrylic).<a href="#N_40_"><sup>(40)</sup></a>  PFF &#182;385.  <u>See</u> <u>Flegel</u>, 4 F.3d at 688 n.4 (Dentsply must show
that it has actively promoted its policy "in other areas").  More significantly, Dentsply does
not treat its wholly exclusive dealers any differently than the nonexclusive dealers carrying
grandfathered brands of teeth.  PFF &#182;386-93.  These grandfathered dealers are a significant
test of Dr. Marvel's theory in several ways, as he acknowledges.  PFF &#182;&#182;341(b)(ii), 386.  Not
only do they show that there is no bait and switch steering occurring in the market, as
discussed above, they show that Dentsply's rationale is inconsistent with its overall conduct.
PFF &#182;386.  Under Dr. Marvel's theory, Dentsply should devote fewer promotional resources
to the nonexclusive dealers because it cannot protect its promotional investment in those
dealers.  PFF &#182;386 (i).  

<p>	There is no evidence in the record, however, that Dentsply devotes more promotional
resources to wholly exclusive Dentsply dealers.  PFF &#182;386-89.  In fact, Dentsply executives
are very clear that the company does not treat exclusive dealers any differently than
grandfathered dealers in the area of promotional support.  PFF &#182;387.  Also, when Dentsply has
converted a lab from using a competitive tooth to a Trubyte tooth, it has not tried to steer that
lab away from buying Trubyte teeth from a non-exclusive dealer such as Zahn.  PFF &#182;388
(Clark Tr. 2687 (It is a "cardinal rule in terms of how we conducted ourselves with dealers
that we would not cross")).  And there is no evidence that dealers currently carrying
grandfathered brands of rival teeth are less efficient or effective than the exclusive Dentsply
dealers; in fact, the most effective dealers selling Trubyte teeth are nonexclusive dealers such
as Zahn and Darby.  PFF &#182;390-93 .

<p>	In sum, Dentsply's justifications are theoretical and not supported by the facts in
evidence, including its own public explanations for its exclusionary policies, and they are
inconsistent with its overall conduct.  As a result, Dentsply has failed to meet its burden of
showing that its alleged business justification is nonpretextual, much less procompetitive.<a href="#N_41_"><sup>(41)</sup></a>  
Moreover, there is no risk of deterring procompetitive conduct by enjoining Dentsply's
exclusionary policies here.  Under Dr. Marvel's theory, Dentsply charges higher prices and
excludes its rivals from dealers in order to benefit consumers.  This conduct -- higher prices
and market foreclosure -- "is facially anticompetitive and exactly the harm that antitrust laws
aim to prevent."  <u>Kodak</u>, 504 U.S. at 478.   Though exclusive dealing may be procompetitive
in some circumstances, Dentsply's attempt to impute a procompetitive effect to the specific
conduct challenged here "is far less clear."  <u>Id.</u> at 479.   

<p><a name="3b"></a><ol><ol type="A" start="2"><strong><li>The Evidence Establishes That Dentsply's Exclusionary Arrangements
Are Overbroad And Not Reasonably Necessary To Achieve The Stated
Objective Of Protecting Its Promotions.</li></strong></ol></ol>


<p>	Even if Dentsply somehow satisfied its burden, it is easily rebutted by the evidence
demonstrating that the restraint is overbroad and "not reasonably necessary to achieve the
stated objective."  <u>Brown Univ.</u>, 5 F.3d at 669.   Dr. Marvel's theory fails because the
evidence demonstrates that Dentsply would in fact increase, not decrease, its level of
promotion and marketing absent exclusive dealing.<a href="#N_42_"><sup>(42)</sup></a>  PFF &#182;373-77.  The evidence shows,
therefore, that Dentsply's challenged conduct is unnecessary to prevent Dr. Marvel's posited
harm in its absence.  The testimony of Dentsply's own executives indicates that, if Dealer
Criterion 6 is removed and as a result Dentsply loses market share, Dentsply will likely
<em>increase</em> its promotions to regain its lost share.  PFF &#182;374.   The conclusion that Dentsply
would compete aggressively even without exclusive dealing is buttressed by its behavior with
respect to other Trubyte products that are not protected by exclusive dealing, such as
introducing the new "Eclipse" denture system which is a merchandise product not subject to
Dealer Criterion 6.  PFF &#182; 376. And if marketing expenditures would increase absent Criterion
6, there can be no concern about an inefficient level of marketing by Dentsply and therefore
no procompetitive justification for maintaining Dentsply's exclusionary policies.  PFF &#182;375.

<p>	Moreover, the evidence also shows that Dentsply's rivals would increase their levels
of promotion and marketing if Dealer Criterion 6 were no longer in effect.  PFF &#182;377.  As a
result, the overall level of interbrand promotional efforts marketwide -- the relevant
consideration -- would increase absent Dealer Criterion 6.  

<p>	In addition, the record contains several examples of Dentsply's overbroad enforcement
of Dealer Criterion 6 that have no connection to the purported justifications put forward by
Dentsply at trial.  PFF &#182;382.  First, Trinity, a dealer that sold Dentsply merchandise but not
teeth, was terminated by Dentsply for adding Vita teeth.  Dr. Marvel's theory, however, does
not apply to dealers who do not carry Dentsply teeth because there are no tooth promotions on
which a competitor can free ride.  PFF &#182;382 (a).  Dentsply had made no investment in
Trinity's tooth sales; nor is there any reason to believe that preventing Trinity from selling
competitive brands of teeth would somehow enhance its ability to sell Trubyte merchandise. 
PFF &#182;382 (a).  Second, Leach &amp; Dillon proposed to dealers that they handle the accounts
receivable function for the Davis Schottlander Enigma teeth, which Leach &amp; Dillon would
sell, stock, and ship itself.  PFF &#182; 382(a).  Dr. Marvel's efficiency story does not apply here
because the dealers would not be stocking or selling any Enigma teeth and consequently they
would have no opportunity to steer customers.  PFF &#182;382(b).  Nonetheless, Dentsply viewed
such an arrangement as a violation of the dealer criteria and took steps to put a stop to it.  PFF
&#182;382(b)

<p>	Dentsply also applies Dealer Criterion 6 to prohibit multi-outlet dealers such as
Patterson from adding rival brands of teeth even at those outlets where it does not carry
Dentsply's teeth.  PFF &#182;241.  Again, under these circumstances, there is no opportunity for
steering at outlets where Trubyte teeth are not sold.  Finally, Dentsply has conceded that it has
authorized additional dealers under the Dealer Criteria, such as Darby Dental, despite
concluding internally that it did not need additional distribution points.  PFF &#182;238.  Each of
these examples demonstrates that Dentsply's application of its exclusionary arrangements is
both overbroad and "not reasonably necessary to achieve the stated objective."  <u>Brown Univ.</u>,
5 F.3d at 669.   

<p><a name="3c"></a><ol><ol type="A" start="3"><strong><li>The Substantial Evidence Of Anticompetitive Effects Outweighs Any
Procompetitive Benefit.</li></strong></ol></ol>


<p>	Even if Dentsply's claimed business justification was not pretextual, insufficiently
procompetitive, and overbroad, any negligible benefit is far outweighed by the substantial
anticompetitive harm resulting from Dentsply's exclusionary policies.  <u>Brown Univ.</u>, 5 F.3d at
669; <u>Law v. NCAA</u>, 134 F.3d 1010, 1019 (10th Cir. 1998) (citing <u>Brown Univ.</u>) ("Ultimately,
if these steps are met, the harms and benefits must be weighed against each other in order to
judge whether the challenged behavior is, on balance, reasonable."); <u>Microsoft</u>, 253 F.3d at
59.  Courts routinely apply a similar "rule of reason" balancing approach under both Section 1
and Section 2.  <u>Id.</u> (citing <u>Standard Oil Co. v. United States</u>, 221 U.S. 1, 61-62 (1911)); <u>Mid-Texas Communications Sys., Inc. v. AT &amp; T</u>, 615 F.2d 1372, 1389 n.13 (5th Cir. 1980) (citing
<u>Byars</u>, 609 F.2d at 860); <u>see also</u> <u>Cal. Computer Prods., Inc. v. IBM Corp.</u>, 613 F.2d 727, 737
(9th Cir. 1979).

<p>	As previously established, Dentsply's conduct has caused significant anticompetitive
harm in the market.  On the other side of the balance, any procompetitive benefits of
Dentsply's conduct are at most negligible.  PFF &#182;328.  Accordingly, as Dr. Reitman
concluded, the anticompetitive harm far outweighs any procompetitive benefits.  PFF &#182;329. 
Dentsply's expert, Dr. Marvel, in contrast, has done no empirical analysis quantifying the
effects of removing Dentsply's exclusive dealing policy to justify it based on a weighing of
effects.  PFF &#182;328.  Dentsply's conduct results in harm to consumers in the form of frustrated
consumer choice, higher prices, and inferior quality and service.  <u>See</u> text, <u>supra</u> &#167;I.B.2. 
Accordingly, Dentsply's conduct, on balance, is clearly anticompetitive.   


<p align="center"><a name="conclusion"></a><strong><u>CONCLUSION</u></strong>

<p>	For the foregoing reasons, this Court should declare that Dentsply's conduct has
violated sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act and section 3 of the Clayton Act, and bar
Dentsply from enforcing Dealer Criterion 6 and engaging in related conduct.

<p><a name="N_11_">11. </a>	Consistent with this evidence, perceptions of market participants also show that
Dentsply exerts control over the artificial tooth market.  These perceptions are valuable
indicators of Dentsply's economic power.  <u>See</u>, <u>e.g.</u>, <u>Rothery Storage &amp; Van Co. v. Atlas Van
Lines</u>, 792 F.2d 210, 219 n.4 (D.C. Cir. 1986) ("economic actors usually have accurate
perceptions of economic realities").  Dentsply's own studies stated that customers found
Dentsply "dictatorial and arrogant;"<strong> [REDACTED TEXT]</strong> PFF &#182;&#182;190 (a)-(c).  Many
Dentsply tooth dealers believe that, in imposing Dealer Criterion 6 upon them, Dentsply
exerts too much control over the products the dealers are able to sell.  PFF &#182;190(d). 
<p><a name="N_12_">12. </a>	<u>See</u> <u>also</u> <u>Microsoft</u>, 253 F.3d at 58, 60; <u>Lorain Journal Co. v. United States</u>, 342 U.S.
143, 155 (1951); <u>3M v. Appleton Papers, Inc.</u>, 35 F. Supp. 2d 1138, 1145-46 (D. Minn. 1999).
<p><a name="N_13_">13. </a>	The section 1 rule of reason analysis is addressed specifically in connection with the
discussion of Dentsply's violation of section 1 of the Sherman Act and section 3 of the
Clayton Act. <u>See</u> Section II. B.
<p><a name="N_14_">14. </a>	If foreclosure is based on the percentage of Dentsply's market share sold through its
distributors, as suggested in <u>Omega Envtl., Inc. v. Gilbarco Inc.</u>, 127 F.3d 1157, 1162 (9th
Cir. 1997)), Dentsply has foreclosed 75%-80% of the market.  If foreclosure is based on the
percentage of dealer outlets foreclosed to Dentsply's rivals, as suggested in <u>Stitt Spark Plug
Co. v. Champion Spark Plug Co.</u>, 840 F.2d 1253, 1258 (5th Cir. 1988), Dentsply has
foreclosed roughly 87% of the market.  Even if foreclosure is based only on the percentage of
dealer tooth stocks foreclosed to Dentsply's rivals (given the fact that dealers do not stock
teeth at all of their outlets), the foreclosure rate is still at least 70%-80%. PFF &#182;243.  
<p><a name="N_15_">15. </a>	Even rival teeth that are sold by some dealers under the "grandfather" provisions of
Dealer Criterion 6 -- including the American Tooth, Austenal, and Universal brands -- are
foreclosed from at least 60% of dealer outlets.  PFF &#182;245.  This limited grandfathering does
not cure the anticompetitive effects of Dentsply's exclusive dealing agreements, particularly
when its principal competitors -- Vita and Ivoclar -- are typically not subject to the

<p><a name="N_18_">18. </a>	The fact that crown and bridge materials are sold direct does not suggest that it is
efficient to sell teeth direct.  Crown and bridge products have historically been distributed
directly to labs.  PFF &#182;148.  There are significant differences between selling crown and
bridge products and selling teeth, including the fact that teeth are ordered much more
frequently and involve a substantially greater range of SKUs.  <u>See</u> PFF &#182;&#182;147 -152.
<p><a name="N_19_">19. </a>	When Myerson was part of the larger Austenal Corporation, Myerson added local
tooth stocks to distribution centers that Austenal established for other products in Orlando,
New York, and Los Angeles.  These distribution centers allowed Myerson to offer local
availability of teeth and provided Myerson with additional marketing opportunities for teeth. 
When Dentsply acquired Austenal in early 2002, however, Myerson lost these distribution
centers and the additional business they generated.  PFF &#182;161.  Maintaining local tooth stocks
presents a significant cost of distribution.  PFF &#182;143. 

<p><a name="N_20_">20. </a>	The term "operatory dealer" is used in two ways in the industry: to refer to dealers that
are in both the dental operatory business and the dental laboratory business, and to refer to
dealers that are only in the operatory business.  PFF &#182;249.  As used here, the term refers to
those dealers, as recognized by the Court in its summary judgment opinion, that do not sell
teeth or other products to labs at all. PFF &#182;250 
<p><a name="N_21_">21. </a>	<u>See</u> <u>also</u>, <u>e.g.</u>, <u>PepsiCo, Inc. v. Coca-Cola Co.</u>, 1998-2 Trade Cas. (CCH) &#182; 72,257 at
82,644-45 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 27, 1998) (refusing to dismiss complaint despite at-will nature of
exclusive agreements); <u>Dairymen</u>, 1983-2 Trade Cas. (CCH) &#182; 65,651 at 69,338 (defendant's

satisfy" consumers preferences); <u>Brown Univ.</u>, 5 F.3d at 668 (reducing output is an
anticompetitive effect); <u>VISA</u>, 163 F. Supp. 2d at 382-83, 395-96 (determining that
exclusionary rules pursuant to horizontal agreement among competitors limited product
variety and consumer choices).  Dentsply's expert, Professor Marvel, recognized such
frustration of consumer preference as an anticompetitive effect during his previous work on a
case involving the "augurs" market. PFF&#182; 270.
<p><a name="N_23_">23. </a>Even today, after Dentsply's effort to copy Vita shades with its Portrait Teeth, many believe that
Dentsply's teeth do not match Vita shades. PFF &#182;273
<p><a name="N_24_">24. </a>	In a complaint (later voluntarily dismissed) seeking a declaratory judgment against the
United States on these same issues in December 1998, Dentsply alleged that rival tooth lines
could displace an "enormous" amount of Trubyte teeth in its dealerships if it were forced to
surrender Dealer Criterion 6.  D.I. 1 (Compl. for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief &#182; 26,
<u>Dentsply Int'l, Inc. v. Antitrust Division of the U.S. Dep't of Justice</u>, No. 98-693 (D. Del.)
(filed Dec. 10, 1998)).
<p><a name="N_25_">25. </a>	Even Dr. Marvel, Dentsply's expert, conceded that prices would fall if Dealer
Criterion 6 were eliminated, although he contended that prices would fall due to Dentsply's
reduced incentive to engage in promotion. PFF &#182;279.
<p><a name="N_26_">26. </a>	Section 1 of the Sherman Act provides that "[e]very contract, combination in the form
of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several
States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal. . . ."  15 U.S.C. &#167; 1.	
<p><a name="N_27_">27. </a>	Section 3of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 14, provides:


<p>		It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such
commerce, to lease or make a sale or contract for the sale of goods, wares,
merchandise, machinery, supplies, or other commodities, whether patented or
unpatented, for use, consumption, or resale within the United States or any Territory
thereof or the District of Columbia or any insular possession or other place under the
jurisdiction of the United States, or fix a price charged therefor, or discount from, or
rebate upon, such price, on the condition, agreement, or understanding that the lessee
or purchaser thereof shall not use or deal in the goods, wares, merchandise, machinery,
supplies, or other commodities of a competitor or competitors of the lessor or seller,
where the effect of such lease, sale, or contract for sale or such condition, agreement,
or understanding may be to substantially lessen competition or tend to create a
monopoly in any line of commerce.
<p><a name="N_28_">28. </a>	The language in section 3 prohibiting sales "on the <em>condition</em>, agreement or
<em>understanding</em>" that the lessee or purchaser not use or deal in the goods of a competitor
arguably reaches conduct beyond that proscribed by Section 1.  <u>See</u> Areeda &#182;1438g (the
"understanding" requirement in section 3 "may go further" than the "agreement" requirement
in section 1, "and 'condition' aptly describes the conditioned refusal to deal").  According to
Areeda, "[c]onditioned sales to others may be readily inferred when the supplier has expressly
announced his conditions for future dealing," irrespective of a formal agreement. <u>Id.</u>
According to Areeda, lower court cases to the contrary have not analyzed the difference in
language between section 1 and section 3.  <u>Id.</u>  Because the agreement element of section 1 is,
if anything, narrower than section 3 (<u>id.</u>), and is clearly satisfied here, it follows that the
agreement element of section 3 is also satisfied.  
<p><a name="N_29_">29. </a>	The special concern <u>Monsanto</u> expressed regarding evidence of agreement in vertical
price-fixing cases stems from the fact that resale price maintenance is <em>per se</em> illegal.  <u>See</u>
<u>Monsanto</u>, 465 U.S. at 763 ("[I]t is of considerable importance that independent action by the
manufacturer, and concerted action on nonprice restrictions, be distinguished from price-fixing agreements, since under present law the latter are subject to <em>per se</em> treatment and treble
damages.").  That concern does not apply here, where the challenged conduct is not illegal <em>per
se</em> and involves an exclusion of competitors.  <u>See</u> <u>id.</u>  Moreover, the evidence here is far
stronger than the evidence in <u>Monsanto</u>, and in <u>Monsanto</u> the Court determined that the
evidence was sufficient to show an agreement.  <u>See</u> <u>id.</u> at 765-66.    
<p><a name="N_30_">30. </a>	Because, if anything, section 3 of the Clayton Act requires a lesser showing of
anticompetitive effects than section 1 (<u>Town Sound &amp; Custom Tops, Inc. v. Chrysler Motors
Corp.</u>, 959 F.2d 468, 487 (3d Cir. 1992); <u>Barr Labs.</u>, 978 F.2d at 110), anticompetitive
conduct that violates section 1 also violates section 3.
<p><a name="N_31_">31. </a>	The defendant bears the burden of persuasion for  an affirmative defense. <u>Hughes v.
United States</u>, 263 F.3d 272, 278 (3d Cir. 2001); <u>see also</u> <u>United States v. Dodd</u>, 225 F.3d
340, 342 (3d Cir. 2000); <u>Donahue v. Consolidated Rail Corp.</u>, 224 F.3d 226, 229 (3d Cir.
2000).
<p><a name="N_32_">32. </a>	Dr. Reitman began evaluating Dentsply's claimed justifications when he started
working on this case five years ago, three years before receiving Dr. Marvel's first report. 
Reitman Tr. 3918-19.  He reviewed the entire evidentiary record, just as he did in his
anticompetitive effects analysis, to evaluate whether there are procompetitive reasons for
Dentsply's policies.  In contrast, Professor Marvel admitted that the primary benefit from
Dentsply's exclusive dealing he predicts are not based on empirical analysis or supported by
facts in the record, but are  Amerely theoretical expectations.@  PFF&#182; 328, 341(a) .  Such
speculation, unsupported by evidence in the record, is wholly unpersuasive if even admissible. 
<u>Elcock v.KMart Corp.</u>, 233 F.3d 734, 756  (3d Cir. 2000).

<p><a name="N_33_">33. </a>	Dentsply cannot cite to Professor Marvel to satisfy its burden of showing its
justification is nonpretextual, in light of his testimony that he did not have an opinion on
Dentsply's motive for adopting exclusive dealing.  PFF &#182; 337 (e.g. Marvel Tr. 3686-87 ("I
don't much care about motive")).
<p><a name="N_34_">34. </a>	This contemporaneous explanation by the Dentsply executive who promulgated the
criteria demonstrates that the vague language of Dealer Criterion 6 ("In order to effectively
promote Dentsply/York products, dealers that are recognized as authorized distributors may
not add further tooth lines to their product offering") does not allude to Dr. Marvel's claimed
justification. 
<p><a name="N_35_">35. </a>	In addition to showing that Professor Marvel's justification theory is pretextual, the
"focus dealer services" rationale is itself not a valid justification for Dentsply's exclusionary
policies. PFF &#182;334. Dentsply's explanation that it wants to keep dealers focused on its
products is in reality nothing more than wanting to preserve its market power.  <u>Microsoft</u>, 253
F.3d at 71.  "That is not an unlawful end, but neither is it a procompetitive justification" for its
exclusionary policies.  <u>Id.</u>  Moreover, this rationale is invalid because a dealer has a strong
incentive on its own to ensure that its service does not suffer by adding a rival tooth line.  PFF
&#182;334.  Dentsply's own dealers testified that adding another line of teeth would not affect their
level of service or amount of Dentsply inventory, and those dealers also carrying
grandfathered lines of rival teeth have shown no lack of focus on Dentsply teeth.  PFF &#182;335.    
<p><a name="N_36_">36. </a>  	Because it is Dentsply's burden to demonstrate a sufficiently procompetitive
justification and it is not yet scheduled to submit its brief and findings of fact pursuant to the
parties' agreed-upon schedule, it is not clear that Dentsply will rely on Dr. Marvel's theory to
make this showing.  Depending on the extent to which Dentsply ultimately relies on Professor
Marvel, the United States may reassert some or all of the arguments previously made in its
motion in limine to exclude Professor Marvel's testimony, now that his opinion has been
tested at trial and found wanting on the same grounds advanced in the in limine motion.  (D.I. 
337, 338, 396).
<p><a name="N_37_">37. </a>	In addition, although dealers should support exclusive dealing because in theory they
get a share of the increased profits from more efficient distribution, here dealers vigorously
oppose Dentsply's exclusionary policies.  PFF &#182;379-81.
<p><a name="N_38_">38. </a>  	Under the grandfathering provision of Dealer Criterion 6, dealers are permitted to
continue carry competitor's tooth brands that they were already carrying before that policy
was implemented.  PFF &#182; 39.  The six largest dealers selling Dentsply teeth also carry rival
brands of teeth.  PFF &#182;341(b)(i).
<p><a name="N_39_">39. </a>	The grandfathered brands provide particularly compelling evidence that dealers do not
steer customers because, if anything, dealers should be able to steer customers more easily
from Dentsply to those brands than to Vita and Ivoclar.  PFF &#182;349.  Dr. Marvel did not
recognize the fact that the grandfathered rival brands include lines of teeth in copies of
Dentsply moulds and shades.  <u>Compare </u> PFF &#182;341(b) to &#182;349.
<p><a name="N_40_">40. </a>	No other supplier has applied exclusive dealing in either the dental laboratory products
market or more specifically the artificial tooth market.  PFF &#182;383-385.  If, according to Dr.
Marvel's theory, it is efficient for Dentsply to apply exclusive dealing to teeth, it should be
efficient for Dentsply's rivals as well.  PFF &#182;384.  
<p><a name="N_41_">41. </a>	Even if Dentsply is able to meet it burden of showing that its claimed justifications are
applicable to protect its promotions from free-riding by its principal rivals, Vita and Ivoclar,
they do not apply to Myerson, Universal and Justi.  Those rival's teeth are sold by  many of
the same dealers that sell Dentsply teeth under the grandfathering provision of Dealer
Criterion 6. PFF &#182; 341(b)(i).  Dentsply's inconsistent application of its exclusionary policy not
only calls into question the validity of its claimed justification as to any of these rival brands,
it demonstrates that, at a minimum, its claimed rationale does not justify its exclusion of
Myerson, Universal, and Justi.  
<p><a name="N_42_">42. </a>	Dr. Marvel's testimony cannot contradict this evidence, as he acknowledged that he
has "done no empirical analysis of what would happen if Dentsply abandoned its exclusive
dealing."  PFF &#182; 341(b).
