                <td valign="top"><p>Even before Hurricane Katrina devastated Mississippi 
                    Gulf communities in August 2005, dental care for some of the 
                    neediest residents of Hattiesburg, Miss., was limited and 
                    inadequate.</p>
                  <p>Administrators of Hattiesburg&#8217;s Southeast Mississippi 
                    Rural Health Initiative, Inc., (SeMRHI), a HRSA health center 
                    and Ryan White grantee, recognized the need to provide more 
                    dental care and rose to the challenge.</p>
                  <p>In early 2005, SeMRHI&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer Kaye 
                    Ray nominated Chief Financial Officer Hope Braley and Chief 
                    Operating Officer Geroldean Dyse to participate in the 2005 
                    Johnson and Johnson/UCLA Health Care Executive Program. The 
                    2005 class convened on the UCLA campus in July, a month before 
                    Hurricane Katrina hit.</p>
                  <p>Currently in its sixth year, the J &amp; J Health Care Executive 
                    Program provides management development training for executive 
                    directors and leaders of community-based health care organizations 
                    fully or partially funded by HRSA. The goal is to help participants 
                    increase their organizations&#8217; financial stability, and 
                    improve outreach, access to health care, and community satisfaction.</p>
                  <p><br>
                  </p></td>
              </tr>
            </table>
            <p>Along with 34 executives from health care organizations around 
              the country, Braley and Dyse stayed in dormitory rooms on the UCLA 
              campus and worked individually and in groups from 7:30 in the morning 
              until 10 at night on what Braley called &#8220;intense assignments.&#8221; 
              One involved a &#8220;Community Health Improvement Plan,&#8221; 
              a team project to tackle obstacles affecting community health care 
              delivery. Braley and Dyse brain-stormed on their community&#8217;s 
              unmet needs and determined to focus their project on expanding dental 
              care.</p>
            <p>SeMRHI had been providing dental services to the Hattiesburg community 
              in a temporary facility for more than five years. But the facilities 
              were cramped, able to house only one dentist, and the wait to see 
              the dentist was as long as eight weeks. Patient satisfaction surveys, 
              monitored monthly, indicated that the biggest patient complaint 
              was the small waiting room. SeMRHI executives knew a larger, permanent 
              dental center was needed, but funds were limited.</p>
            <p>That&#8217;s where the project that Braley and Dyse brought back 
              from UCLA paid off. It saved SeMRHI time and resources in planning, 
              and the health center executives decided to adopt their project 
              as the actual plan for the new dental center. In June 2006 &#8212; 
              less than a year after Katrina devastated the nearby coast and added 
              about 20,000 new residents to Hattiesburg&#8217;s pre-storm population 
              of 100,000 &#8212; construction for the new dental clinic began 
              on property adjacent to SeMRHI&#8217;s main Hattiesburg clinic.</p>
            <p>And on May 7, 2007, doors opened wide to the brand-new Hattiesburg 
              Community Dental Center &#8212; a 4,200-square-foot, single-level 
              facility with six examining rooms or operatories; large waiting, 
              records and triage rooms; and state-of-the-art x-ray equipment. 
              Planning and construction amounted to a labor of love for Braley, 
              who&#8217;d also helped lay out SeMRHI&#8217;s other health center 
              sites.<br>

                <td valign="top"><p>&#8220;We tried to meet the needs of our patients 
                    and staff. We now have room for two dentists, two hygienists 
                    and a large waiting area,&#8221; said Braley. &#8220;The clinic 
                    has a very warm atmosphere, too. Each operatory has a window 
                    at the foot of the chair and open entryways. And there&#8217;s 
                    wallpaper all the way down the hall to give a three-dimensional 
                    feel. Although our dental center&#8217;s in a very poor rural 
                    area, it&#8217;s a fun place to visit. On top of that, the 
                    patients love our dentist.&#8221;</p>
                  <p>In 2006, the year after Katrina, SeMRHI recorded 6,685 dental 
                    visits, up from 4,030 in 2005. With the new dental facility, 
                    SeMRHI hopes to provide 8,000 dental visits annually.</p>
                  <p>HRSA Administrator Betty Duke toured the new dental facility 
                    just before its grand opening during a visit to SeMRHI in 
                    late April. While there, Dr. Duke awarded the organization 
                    three HRSA grants worth $1.8 million to expand operations 
                    and extend its reach into Pearl River County.<br>
