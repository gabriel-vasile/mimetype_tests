<p><strong>Child Support Reports</strong></p>
<p><strong>September 1993</strong></p>
<p>Introduction to the Issue</p>
<p>by Naomi Marr</p>
<p>The child support community is now only two years away from the
date (September 30, 1995) when all states must have operational,
automated statewide child support enforcement (CSE) systems.
Mandated under the Family Support Act of 1988, this undertaking
presents special challenges and opportunities, some of which we
address in this special issue of <u>Child Support Report</u>.</p>
<p>Foremost in everyone's mind is the requirement that each system
must be statewide and comprehensive. Here, we explain just what is
required and give you a scorecard of progress to date. Critical to
the effort, of course, is the conversion of cases from the existing
system, whether automated or manual, to the new one. We look at the
conversion experiences of four states to see just what problems
state IV-D programs can expect to encounter and to explore various
solutions.</p>
<p>As we implement statewide systems we must also keep in mind that
good interstate communication and case processing are essential to
a well-functioning program. Statewide systems and CSENet are now
coming on-line across the country to handle these vital
communication needs, so we provide a CSENet update here --from
technical assistance to suggestions for enhancements.</p>
<p>This is an exciting time for technology, with new technologies
emerging almost daily. One of these is Electronic Fund
Transfer/Electronic Data Interchange (EFT/EDI). With mandatory wage
withholding coming fast upon us in January, we see EFT/EDI as a
critical element in the handling and processing of child support
collections, and in another article, we bring you up to date on the
experiences from our pilot states.</p>
<p>Hand in hand with EFT/EDI as the technology of choice for
processing collections, is centralized collection and distribution
of child support payments. A number of states are moving firmly in
that direction and in this issue we report on the experiences of
two of them.</p>
<p>Finally, the real world of working cases doesn't stop while we
convert cases and develop and learn new systems. All normal
functions go on--non-custodial parents must be located, asset
information analyzed, and enforcement actions taken. We report on
the experience of the Western Interstate Clearinghouse Automation
Project in handling interstate locates as "quick locates."</p>
<p>Technology is an enabler to improve the child support program
for millions of children in our nation. We hope you will find the
articles in this issue of <u>Child Support Report</u> helpful as
you learn and use technology in your everyday work. And let us hear
from you about your experiences.</p>

<p><strong>Priority #1: Data Clean-up and Conversion of Cases</strong></p>
<p><strong>for Statewide Automated Systems</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps one of the most difficult and most critical aspects of
implementing a statewide system for child support is case
conversion--the transfer of all case data to the new system from
manual files and/or existing automated systems.</p>
<p>In general, states with successful conversion projects are
distinguished by the fact that they are realistic about the time
and effort involved, and therefore begin the task of data
purification and case file clean-up early in the data conversion
effort. When planning for conversion, time and resources are often
underestimated. For accurate planning, CSE agencies must consider:
the size of the caseload, the extent to which the child support
program is fragmented among state or local entities, the level of
existing CSE automation within the state, the quality of the data
on existing systems and the number of additional data elements that
need to be collected. Valuable lessons can be learned from states
that have completed case conversion or are currently in the process
of converting their files. The following descriptions illustrate
how four states addressed these issues and successfully managed
case conversion.</p>
<p><strong>Arizona:</strong> Arizona's data conversion project was
essentially a manual effort performed on-site, county by county,
and included data clean-up and verification of payments and
arrearages. Conversion specialists extracted case data from
hardcopy files, performed a financial reconciliation of each case
and calculated the debt before copying the demographic and
financial case data onto data entry forms. The State stressed the
importance of quality assurance and had several verification check
points throughout the process. When its quality and accuracy were
assured, the data was converted to the new statewide system.</p>
<p>When Arizona began its case conversion project, managers
anticipated the entire project to be done in-house by CSE staff,
augmented with temporary personnel. The State successfully
converted the pilot offices using this approach. However, it became
clear that to finish the work within the implementation schedule,
contractor support would be needed; this was arranged for the
remaining caseload. The project took 34 months to complete and a
total of 266,657 IV-D cases were converted.</p>
<p>Arizona had an immediate return on its investment, since it was
now able to collect on cases which had previously been labeled
"non-workable" cases.</p>
<p><strong>Massachusetts:</strong> Massachusetts' case conversion was
complicated because child support data was spread among many state
entities. Realizing that conversion would be labor intensive, the
Commonwealth began working on it four years before the start of
their transfer and implementation project.</p>
<p>The Massachusetts CSE program has been in the Department of
Revenue (DOR) since 1987. At that time, to centralize all IV-D
activities, it was necessary to convert all the child support data
from the courts to a single DOR/CSE computer system. Reconciliation
and purification of the data was a secondary objective.</p>
<p>The conversion effort was extremely complex because CSE
activities were not supported by a single integrated computer
system, but rather by several computer systems and numerous manual
files containing contradictory information. Using only state staff,
DOR/CSE initiated with the Trial Courts a project to reconcile and
convert the case data, both manual and automated, in 84
Commonwealth courts. After a year of work, they saw that the effort
would require contractor assistance to be completed in a timely
manner. The contractor reconciled and converted 51,035 cases over a
three-year period for a total cost of $5,272,629. Although the
project was expensive and time-consuming, it successfully converted
all child support data to a single DOR/CSE computer system. Today,
DOR is able to implement some of its more innovated collection
techniques, such as bank account attachments, because of this
single converted file.</p>
<p><strong>Rhode Island</strong><strong>:</strong> Rhode Island, with an existing
statewide CSE system, began its transfer and implementation project
under more ideal conditions than most states. Rhode Island
developed an effective two-phase approach to case conversion. Phase
1 involved the purification and automatic conversion of case data
from the old CSE system, and Phase 2 consisted of the manual
conversion of additional required data elements not maintained on
the old CSE system.</p>
<p>A key feature of this approach was to have state staff focus on
cleaning up the data on the old system before automatic conversion.
Verification software developed by the implementation contractor
edited the old CSE system files and produced error reports which
enabled staff to efficiently identify and correct errors as they
continued to perform on-going program operations. The purification
process took about nine months to complete, then about 98 percent
of the State's 61,000 IV-D cases were converted automatically.</p>
<p>In the last step, each case file was reviewed to manually
convert additional data elements required by the new statewide CSE
system. Rhode Island acquired contractor support for this task,
which was completed in 9 months at a cost $1,165,744. Rhode Island
completed statewide conversion, and received a conditional level II
certification in January 1992.</p>
<p><strong>Texas:</strong> Texas is now in the process of data purification
and conversion. Although, like Rhode Island, Texas also had an
existing statewide, automated CSE system, it lacked many of the
data elements required by its new system. As soon as the State
identified the ones it needed, it devised a data acquisition
methodology and designed data collection screens to capture the new
information through the existing system.</p>
<p>About 1,600 CSE field staff in 75 offices are involved in the
data conversion effort, accelerated by hiring a number of temporary
employees and by significant amounts of overtime among regular
employees. While continuing to work their own caseloads,
caseworkers add the pertinent new information to special
datacollection screens on the system. Now, with the conversion
effort intensifying as the implementation deadline nears, the State
is focusing on obligated cases to ensure optimum collections.</p>
<p>Texas' target date for implementing its statewide system is
April, 1994. The early conversion effort will allow almost the
entire caseload of 800,000 to be automatically converted on that
date.</p>
<p><strong>Lessons Learned</strong></p>
<p>o It is never too early to plan for case conversion. Do not
underestimate the amount of time and effort it will take.</p>
<p>o Obtain accurate case load statistics early in the process and
be realistic about anticipated case growth.</p>
<p>o Do not underestimate the amount of time case conversion will
take.</p>
<p>o Establish a communication network and get everyone to buy into
the effort. Schedule regular meetings with each jurisdiction from
the beginning, include the vendor, and encourage local offices to
participate in the conversion planning.</p>
<p>o Set up a financial reconciliation policy committee made up of
CSE staff, clerks of the court and county attorneys. This committee
should establish and maintain the financial reconciliation
procedures which will be used convert the data.</p>
<p>o Remember that case conversion can be overwhelming as staff
attempt to balance conversion efforts with on-going case
processing. This added stress can affect performance and the
ability to meet program standards.</p>

<p><strong>Proposed Audit Regulations Published</strong></p>
<p>A proposed rule published in the September 9 issue of the
<u>Federal Register</u> revises the IV-D child support enforcement
program and its audit regulations.</p>
<p>The proposed rule would: (1) amend the child support enforcement
program regulations governing the audit of state IV-D programs and
the imposition of financial penalties for failure to substantially
comply with the requirements of title IV-D of the Social Security
Act; (2) specify how audits will evaluate state compliance with the
requirements set forth in title IV-D of the Act and federal
regulations, including requirements resulting from the Family
Support Act of 1988; and (3) redefine substantial compliance to
place greater focus on performance and streamline Part 305 by
removing unnecessary sections.</p>
<p>Consideration will be given to written comments received by
November 8, 1993. Address comments to: Deputy Director, Office of
Child Support Enforcement, Department of Health and Human Services,
370 L'Enfant Promenade, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20447, Attention:
Director, Policy and Planning Division.</p>
<p><strong>CSENet Begins Phase II: Interface with Automated
Systems</strong></p>
<p>Child Support workers are quickly learning the lesson that
applies to most new ways of doing things: there is no substitute
for hands-on experience. And results are starting to emerge from
the twenty-four states that are exchanging interstate data via the
Child Support Enforcement Network (CSENet).</p>
<p>These data exchanges with neighboring states are useful to
states as they enter Phase II of CSENet and plan the automated
interface between CSENet and their statewide systems. Users can
see, for example, how CSENet's data elements, transaction
formats</p>
<p>and edits fit into their interstate case processes and
procedures.</p>
<p>The locate function can be a fruitful way to start using CSENet.
Marcia Davis, CSENet coordinator for the State of Washington,
reports that they were about to close a paternity case in which the
only information that the initiating state had for the alleged
absent parent was a name---no SSN or date of birth, both necessary
items for submitting a case to FPLS. Washington submitted a "quick
locate" request to Hawaii via CSENet, and within two days received
a positive "hit" which gave them a full name, date of birth, SSN,
home address, and employer for the alleged parent.</p>
<p><strong>Help is Available</strong></p>
<p>To help states in Phase II interface projects, the CSENet
contractor is providing various kinds of technical assistance. For
instance, work has begun on an <u>Interface Guidance Document</u>
that will be distributed to all states. This publication will
supplement the <u>Electronic Format Specifications Document</u> and
provide the states with direction on how to integrate CSENet into
their child support case management functions.</p>
<p>As expected, early users of CSENet have generated many questions
about the interface with their automated statewide CSE systems.
Also, they have submitted many useful suggestions on how the CSENet
data elements, edits and formats can be improved. The
Administration for Children and Families (ACF) is posting answers
to commonly asked questions on the ACF automated bulletin board.
Comments from users will also be placed on the bulletin board for
review by the states.</p>
<p>ACF also plans to distribute the suggestions to the states for
comment and prioritization. The agency will use the feedback to
convene a CSENet Data Element User's group in early fall to review
the suggestions and comments to determine if changes are
needed.</p>
<p><strong>Moving Right Along...</strong></p>
<p>New Hampshire, Rhode Island, New York and Virginia have received
on-site technical assistance to assess their readiness for
interfacing Child Support Enforcement Network (CSENet) workstations
with their automated CSE systems. These states were selected
because they are well-along in the process of designing the CSENet
interface and mapping the CSENet data elements tothose in their
statewide systems. The on-site visits also provided information
needed to develop an interface guidance document and to give other
states technical assistance.</p>
<p>Also, Washington, Oregon, Alaska, Idaho, and Utah will have a
one-day WICP/CSENet integration workshop prior to its Western
Interstate Council meeting in October. As interest in CSENet grows,
other workshops are being planned. The next CSENet steering
committee meeting will be in Washington, D.C. on November 15-17,
combined with a technical workshop for CSENet users to consider
updates to CSENet software applications.</p>
<p>Finally, the Territory of Guam recently asked to be added to the
network, and Brian Pollack, the Director of the Family Maintenance
Enforcement Program in British Columbia, Canada, has expressed
interest in CSENet. He believes that the while CSENet was
originally designed to facilitate the exchange of interstate child
support information across U.S. state boundaries, the same concept
can be used to facilitate exchange of information among child
support jurisdictions in different countries. He would like to work
with U.S. Child Support Enforcement offices to determine the
feasibility of expanding CSENet to include an exchange of child
support information across U.S. and Canadian borders.</p>
<p>Questions about CSENet and requests for technical assistance on
the interface between CSENet and a state's automated CSE system
should be directed to the CSENet project manager, Robin Rushton, at
(202) 690-1244.</p>

<p><strong>Statewide Automated Systems: 1995 Is Upon Us</strong></p>
<p>For many state IV-D programs, developing and implementing an
automated statewide child support enforcement system (CSES) is the
single largest, and perhaps the most challenging project they have
ever undertaken.*</p>
<p>Although all 54 states and jurisdictions submitted approvable
Implementation Advance Planning Documents (IAPD) by the mandated
deadline of October 1, 1991, they found that moving from an
approved IAPD on paper to an actual operational system is a huge
challenge. For one thing, the magnitude of devising and
implementing a statewide automated system in the amount of time
given meant that a lot of learning was accomplished on the fly.
Also, the concurrent development of CSES in all 54 jurisdictions
has literally required greater resources than are currently
available in the public and private sectors combined; this has
resulted in inevitable delays.</p>
<p>Despite the challenges and frustrations, as state CSE programs
approach the midpoint of the four year development window
(1991-1995), systems professionals in the Administration for
Children and Families' Office of Information Systems find
encouraging developments. At this point 48 states and jurisdictions
have completed the planning phase of their projects and 14 have
completed the design phase. At least another fifteen are expected
to complete design by October 1, 1993.</p>
<p>To give structured and consistent help to the states on their
statewide systems, ACF developed and published the <u>Automated
Systems for Child Support Enforcement: A Guide for States</u>. The
<u>Guide</u> addresses the requirements that comprehensive,
automated, statewide child support enforcement systems must fulfill
for federal certification. The purposes of the <u>Guide</u> are
to:</p>
<p>o support the states in implementing compliant, operational
systems before October 1, 1995;</p>
<p>o apply the same criteria equally to all states;</p>
<p>o set forth all functional requirements which state child
support enforcement systems must execute in statewide processing; o
ensure that these functions are being performed effectively and
efficiently for the accurate and uniform application of policy;
and</p>
<p>o ensure that federal reviews of state systems are conducted in
a consistent manner and are well documented and substantiated.</p>
<p>ACF has informally assessed the probability of success of all
jurisdictions in meeting all the requirements for statewide
automation. Some have better prospects than others. In most cases
the reason for high risk is the monumental case conversion effort
that is required. Conversion is inevitably a labor- intensive and
time-consuming activity. Other states are at risk because they have
set very ambitious schedules with little room for slippage. With
these states, cautious optimism for their success is the
byword.</p>
<p>But, by and large, ACF is optimistic and encouraged by the
prospect of so many states operating certified, statewide,
comprehensive automated systems. The majority of states
andjurisdictions have an average or better probability of success
with making their statewide systems operational on time.</p>
<p>____________________________________________________________</p>
<p><u>*The Family Support Act of 1988 mandates the automation of
all Title IV-D program requirements. ACF operationalized this
mandate through the publication of regulation found at 45 CFR 307.
The regulation governs enhanced funding for the acquisition and
operation of comprehensive, statewide Child Support Enforcement
[CSE] systems; includes the programmatic conditions and functional
requirements required for states to qualify for funding of systems
acquisitions; and sets forth ACF's oversight
responsibilities.</u></p>
<p><strong>[BOX]</strong></p>
<p><strong>By Definition...</strong></p>
<p>A <strong><u>comprehensive system</u></strong> performs all functional
requirements within required timeframes. It electronically
interfaces with the systems of other agencies and organizations-151
federal, state, and private -151 to improve program management and
operations.</p>
<p>A <strong><u>statewide system</u></strong> effectively and efficiently
encompasses all political subdivisions and other organizations
which provide child support enforcement related services.</p>
<p>An <strong><u>operational</u></strong> <strong><u>system</u></strong> contains, for
each open case, all data necessary to manage the case and meet
federal reporting requirements. It contains the data necessary to
meet all processing requirements for certification.</p>
<p>An <strong><u>efficient and effective</u></strong> <strong><u>system</u></strong>
must improve program management and administration; be integrated
and appropriately apply computer technology; may not require
duplicative application software development or application
software maintenance; and costs must be reasonable, appropriate,
and beneficial.</p>
<p>An <strong><u>integrated system</u></strong> must embody the following
principles: the IV-D agency has the ability to control, account
for, and monitor all factors in support collection and paternity
determination processes; it is the sole system effort of the IV-D
program within the state; there is no duplicative application
software or duplicative data entry; there is a single application
software development and maintenance effort and organization; all
system components are electronically linked and the linkage is
transparent to users.</p>
<p>Finally, the system must meet numerous processing requirements
in the functional areas of: case initiation, locate, establishment,
enforcement, case management, financial management, reporting and
security and privacy.</p>
<p><u>Training</u></p>
<p><strong>Wizards at Work in Indiana</strong></p>
<p>"Rings," "clusters," and bullseyes" describe the configuration
of an automation training program in Indiana where "wizards" in all
of the State's 92 counties are the lead trainers. Wizards are
caseworkers or supervisors assigned by county social services
directors to become experts in the Indiana Client Eligibility
System (ICES) system. ICES is a statewide initiative to automate
the determination of benefits in several Indiana social service
programs.</p>
<p>The system integrates the AFDC, Food Stamp, and Medicaid
programs, determining eligibility and calculating benefits for each
of them. Initiated in 1991, ICES was implemented at an 80 percent
level in the State by August 1, this year, with over 50 percent of
all cases converted.</p>
<p>The Wizards training approach is being piloted beginning October
1, in a modified form with Indiana's IV-D program, and the Indiana
Support Enforcement Tracking System.</p>
<p>Operating within limited time and resources, Wizards is built on
a train-the trainers proliferation model. With a wizard in each
county (and one for every 20 ICES users in the larger counties) the
State is divided up into clusters of counties organized in rings
around the State capital, Indianapolis.</p>
<p>The first cluster of wizards was trained centrally in case
conversion and operations. Then, they went back to their respective
counties as ICES experts to teach the users. Wizards in cluster two
counties did the same, while cluster one wizards "rolled forward"
to assist them with their implementation. This "roll forward/roll
back" training assistance has been used throughout the first seven
county clusters, and will continue until implementation is
complete.</p>
<p>Said Phil Canada, developer of the concept, "We have realized
great success with this approach. Help desk calls have been reduced
because wizards can handle problems and questions. Also,
standardized procedures have been developed, which has increased
the effectiveness of implementation." For more information, contact
Cheryl Baxter, (317) 464-2360.</p>
<p><strong>North Dakota Uses Video Training for Case Conversion</strong></p>
<p>In keeping with the State's cost-savings approach to developing
a comprehensive, statewide, automated system (total development
costs will be about $1.7 million), North Dakota is using an
interactive video system to train caseworkers on data
pre-conversion.</p>
<p>Pat Conrad, the State's Systems Project Director, provided the
training at the end of August from the host site, Bismarck College.
The 60 state caseworkers traveled to one of seven regional sites -
the community college located closest to their homes. Using an
interactive video system with cameras and TV monitors at each
training site, all participants at one site were able to interact
with participants at all the other sites, as if they were all in
the same room. During the training session,caseworkers asked
questions which all of the other caseworkers heard and to which the
instructor responded interactively.</p>
<p>The cost? $95 an hour for the interactive video system, plus $20
per hour per site. The benefits? All workers will get the same
training and all will have the benefit of hearing all questions
posed by other caseworkers. Also, travel time and per diem
requirements are significantly reduced, if not eliminated.</p>

<p><strong>Colorado and New York Start Centralized Payment
Collection</strong></p>
<p><strong>and Distribution</strong> <strong>Systems</strong></p>
<p>by Ann Slayton</p>
<p>Collection and distribution of child support payments can be
complex and difficult. Payments must be matched and credited to the
correct cases, the AFDC collections must be distributed, and
non-AFDC collections disbursed promptly. Other activities include
billing the paying parent and monitoring the payments on each
case.</p>
<p>Distribution poses particularly thorny problems for state and
local CSE agencies. Distribution rules are complicated, local
jurisdictions may have inadequate computer resources, and accurate
record-keeping often falls short. All of these problems can cause
errors and delays in getting the support payments to custodial
parents and their children.</p>
<p>Currently, state CSE programs use several different agencies for
receiving and disbursing payments. However, these agencies, such as
county court clerks, the central IV-D agency, or a central payment
clearinghouse, may not be handling both IV-D and non-IV-D payments,
or may not be conducting case monitoring or billing.</p>
<p>Clearly, there is a great need for effective and efficient
collection and distribution of child support payments. And the need
will intensify over the coming months for two main reasons. One,
because of the anticipated surge in caseloads and payments from
immediate wage withholding required for all new support orders
issued in a state after January 1, 1994. [See "States Tackle
Immediate Wage Withholding in Non-IV-D Cases," <u>CSR</u> July
1993.] And two, because of the need to simplify the withholding
process for employers, so they will not have to send checks to and
keep track of non-IV-D custodial parents, or cut checks and mail
them to multiple state agencies.</p>
<p>Handling large numbers of payments, maintaining internal
controls, and decreasing the risk of errors and delays, can be done
more effectively when states designate only one point for
receiving, accounting for, and disbursing child support
payments.</p>
<p>Colorado and New York have embarked on initiatives to apply
technology to centralized collections operations.</p>
<p><strong>Colorado's Family Support Registry</strong></p>
<p>Colorado's, Family Support Registry (FSR) provides a single
point of contact for any IV-D case payment or inquiries from
parents, employers, and other state CSE agencies. Now in the pilot
phase, which began in July, the system is operating in six
counties, comprising 25 percent of the State's payments, which
number about 30,000 month and total $6.5 million. The FSR is
expected to begin statewide implementation in spring 1994.</p>
<p>The challenge for Colorado, a county-administered state, was to
create a system that accurately supports reconciliation and the
transfer of funds between the FSR and the 63 judicial jurisdictions
and county CSE units. Before the pilot began, Colorado authorities
estimated that workers spent over 78,000 hours per year on
activities that were duplicative. Another10,000 hours were spent
traveling to the 54 jurisdictions where courts maintained records
manually, and staff had to copy needed information from ledger
cards, compile the data, then write the reports mandated by state
and federal requirements.</p>
<p>In designing the FSR, the State has completely reengineered the
payment processing function and integrated it into the CSE program.
Payment processing is conducted under contract to a fiscal agent
and local CSE units maintain control while taking advantage of
technology and economies of scale to enhance productivity. Under
the old system, payments for most IV-D cases are held by the courts
a minimum of eight days, and for non-IV-D cases up to 21 days.
Under the new centralized system, the FSR will deliver a two-day
turnaround. Also, the registry will soon be using electronic funds
transfer and the National Automated Clearing House standard for
receiving direct deposits from employers and other state CSE
agencies.</p>
<p>The FSR has a central customer service unit that handles
inquiries from parents, employers, and the general public. A
24-hour automated voice response system informs parents about
payments made and account balances, and paying parents can
authorize their child support payments by phone.</p>
<p><strong>New York's Centralized Processing</strong></p>
<p>In calendar year 1990, the 58 support collections units (SCUs)
in New York managed 291,000 payment accounts, processing 5,300,000
individual payments totalling $360.5 million. In the same year,
impelled to improve efficiency and reduce costs, the New York
legislature passed a law requiring a centralized payment and
distribution system for all 58 local districts.</p>
<p>The New York centralized collection project now being piloted,
began in March 1993 in two districts, and expanded to 11 districts
in June. The pilot districts comprise about 26 percent of the
State's 352,000 cases with support orders. The processing is being
performed by a private fiscal agent under contract to the State
Department of Social Services(DSS). The contractor actually began
working in January 1993 to develop procedures, design forms and
notices, and establish its operational facility.</p>
<p>The test period runs through March 1994, and is being assessed
by an independent evaluator. If the evaluation shows that the
centralized system is cost-effective and meets standards for
accuracy, timeliness, and accountability, the contract will
continue with statewide implementation beginning in June 1994.</p>
<p>Under the pilot, noncustodial parents and employers send child
support payments directly to the fiscal agent, which records each
payment, then transmits the payment information electronically each
day to the DSS Child Support Management System (CSMS) to update the
collection account records. Each morning, CSMS provides an
electronic datafile to the fiscal agent containing disbursement
information, which the fiscal agent uses to print and mail support
checks.</p>
<p>[CSMS is New York's automated on-line child support case
management and accounts tracking system. It is operated through
mainframe computers in Albany and New York City. Each district
support collection unit manages its enforcement caseload with
atelecommunications link between its office's computer terminals
and the mainframe.]</p>
<p>New York's contractor also designed and operates an interactive
voice response system, the Child Support Information Line (CSIL)
which provides information to a large volume of callers.
Information on the most recent collections and disbursements is
updated daily by CSMS and is provided to callers on a 24-hour
basis. It also describes general child support program services and
gives the addresses of local district child support units where
services are available.</p>
<p><strong>Before and After</strong></p>
<p>Before centralization of collections and disbursements in the
pilot districts, support payments were sent to each SCU for
processing and entering into CSMS, then CSMS returned an electronic
datafile to SCUs each morning for the printing and mailing of
checks. Notwithstanding the automated system, the initial steps in
processing payments were strictly manual, and very labor-intensive.
This has been the case with the CSMS accounting module since it was
developed in 1978.</p>
<p>In the years since CSMS was first implemented, automation
enhancements have been made to New York's IV-D program, which would
have a great impact on collections. Says New York IV-D Director
Joan Keenan, "We recognized that an ever-increasing number of
payments would be sent to our SCUs. Our estimates indicated that
they would reach over 8 million a year by 1994." Under these
conditions, manual batch data entry of support payment information
via local district terminals would no longer be efficient. New York
began considering a centralized collection system.</p>
<p>The existence of state-of-the-art equipment (such as
micro-encoding optical scanners), and electronic funds transfer
meant that payments could be processed into a daily data file for
subsequent automated posting and updating of CSMS account records.
Using such features to process a high volume of payments at a
central collection point can take advantage of economies of scale
that other methods used with payments being received in a single
district cannot. This results in considerable cost savings and
improved operational efficiency.</p>

<p><strong>Collection and Distribution Under Statewide</strong>
<strong>Systems</strong></p>
<p>States will be intensifying their efforts to centralize
collection and distribution of child support payments as they work
toward implementing their statewide systems, for which the
following collection functions are required:</p>
<p>o automatically bill all cases other than those with income
withholding in place;</p>
<p>o automatically process all payments received;</p>
<p>o support the acceptance and disbursement of payments using EFT
technology;</p>
<p>o be uniform statewide, accepting and maintaining all financial
information and performing all relevant program calculations;</p>
<p>o distribute collections in accordance with federal and state
regulations; and</p>
<p>o generate notices to AFDC and former AFDC recipients regarding
support collections received, and to the IV-A agency regarding
collections received on behalf of AFDC recipients.</p>
<p><strong>EFT/EDI: Most Favored Remittance Technique</strong></p>
<p>The potential efficiency of electronic transmission of child
support payments holds the promise of moving this technique into
the front ranks for CSE agencies, employers, and payroll
processors.</p>
<p>Pilot projects in Iowa and Nebraska tested the use of Electronic
Funds Transfer/Electronic Data Interchange (EFT/EDI) technology for
transmitting wage withholding payments. They showed that EFT/EDI
can eliminate the preparation and transmission of checks by
employers; eliminate manual posting and deposit of checks by the
IV-D agencies; and, due to the speed of electronic transmissions,
reduce "mail time" to less than two days. Employers using EFT/EDI
will be able to combine wage withholdings with other electronic
payment transactions, such as direct deposit of employees' salaries
and tax payments.</p>
<p>With these positive outcomes in mind, and the fact that the
federal child support systems regulations require that each state's
automated system be capable of receiving and disbursing funds using
EFT technology, OCSE is promoting the use of EFT/EDI by employers
and encouraging state CSE agencies to accept EFT/EDI deposits prior
to implementing their statewide automated systems. One OCSE work
group comprised of employers, child support enforcement agency
personnel, and personnel from financial institutions and the
payroll industry developed a standard EFT/EDI format. It has been
approved by the National Automated Clearing House Association and
the American Banker's Association EDI Council. Another OCSE
workgroup is developing a standard income withholding form which
incorporates the EFT/EDI elements.</p>
<p>In June, OCSE sent to all state IV-D Directors the EFT/EDI
format and the results of the EFT/EDI pilot projects conducted in
Iowa and Nebraska. The agency is encouraging IV-D programs to
accept wage withholdings using EFT/EDI technology as soon as an
employer indicates a willingness to use it. Even if state systems
are not currently capable of accepting an electronic tape,
hard-copy information can be supplied by the IV-D agency's bank.
The money will be deposited sooner and the IV-D agency will receive
standardized information in an easily understood format. Conference
calls providing technical assistance to states in this area are
scheduled for late Fall</p>
<p><strong>Software Becoming Available</strong></p>
<p>Some payroll processing firms and payroll software developers
are modifying their offerings to include a CSE component.
Certainly, the more widely available the software is, the more it
will be used by employers, and OCSE is reaching out to companies
that provide payroll software and payroll processing services,
encouraging them to add a child support module to their products.
The American Payroll Association and the American Society of
Payroll Managers have both volunteered to help.</p>
<p>While state CSE agencies will be expected to make contact with
the employers who currently remit wage withholdings within their
state, OCSE expects to communicate with employers about EFT/EDI
child support transmission through the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,the
National Association of Manufacturers, and the Small Business
Association. The American Banker's Association will also be
contacted to encourage banks to offer services/technical assistance
to both the employers and IV-D agencies which they serve.</p>
<p>Finally, all federal agencies are under a mandate to eliminate
paper transactions, and EFT/EDI allows them to put this objective
into action. The Department of the Treasury has agreed to help OCSE
promote EFT/EDI with federal agencies.</p>
<p>With employers' increasing use of EFT/EDI technology, the
transfer of wage withholdings will be moved out of the "paper age"
and into the age of automation. And although early experience with
EFT/EDI has been limited to income withholding, the hope is that
eventually, nearly all child support collections will be
transmitted electronically. For more information about EFT/EDI,
contact OCSE's Pat Hagen, (202) 401-5684.</p>
<p><u>In the column below, excerpted from the June issue of West
Virginia's newsletter</u>, Child Advocate News &amp; Views,
<u>State IV-D Director Martha Hill rallies her staff for case
conversion.</u></p>
<p><strong>From the Director</strong></p>
<p>Priorities tend to change daily, depending on which external
force is making the greatest demand. The devilishness of priorities
is that they usually are not our own! There is always someone else
quite willing to tell you what you should be doing.</p>
<p>As part of a large, federally-mandated state agency, many of our
CAO [Child Advocate Office] priorities are dictated by statute,
budget, and federal and state regulations. However, for the next
six months, the <u>real</u> CAO priority must be data conversion.
This process includes cleaning up our existing files, closing cases
when appropriate, and working through "dormant" files.</p>
<p>In the long run, the efforts we make over the next few months
will make the automation procedure more effective. If we put
garbage into OSCAR, that is what we will get out...</p>
<p>Local offices are not alone in this priority. For example, the
Q.C. unit will also have as its priority the conversion to OSCAR.
Their focus until December will be case maintenance and they will
make their rounds to the local offices to assist in this function.
The distribution and locate units will likewise be preparing their
work for the new system. Our central accounting office will be
reviewing their records for accuracy, balancing books, etc...</p>
<p>OSCAR will be like most things in life, the better prepared you
are, the easier it is. Our hard work now will pay off in the
future, both in terms of worker satisfaction with OSCAR as well as
the CAO's ability to provide services to the public.</p>
<p>[BOX]</p>
<p><strong>The EFT/EDI Path</strong></p>
<p>Using EFT/EDI, employers or their payroll processors, would
create an Automated Clearing House (ACH) tape transmitting child
support wage withholdings and accompanying identifying information.
The payment and identifying information would travel from the
employer's bank, through the ACH using the Federal Reserve Banking
system. The monies would be deposited on account at the IV-D
agency's bank, and the identifying information transmitted to the
IV-D agency for accounting, distribution and disbursement. In the
long-run, the identifying information would be electronically
transmitted to and processed by the IV-D agency. However, the
availability of the information in a hardcopy, standardized format
should lead to improved processing in the short-run.</p>
<p><u>Locate</u></p>
<p><strong>Quick Locates: Open and Closed Within Days</strong></p>
<p><strong>in Washington State</strong></p>
<p>by Marcia Davis</p>
<p>In 1987, the Western Interstate Clearinghouse Project (WlCP), a
child support enforcement communications network joined five
states, Washington, Alaska, Idaho, Oregon and Utah. The electronic
link has proven to be efficient, cost effective and fast, allowing
a locate request to be opened, responded to and closed within
days.</p>
<p><strong>How does WICP work?</strong></p>
<p>All five states agreed to exchange interstate requests to locate
absent parents, and to establish and enforce child support orders
via this network and to do "quick locates" only. [For a
description, see <u>CSR</u>, Oct. '91.] Automated sources used for
quick locate in Washington are the IV-A and IV-D programs;
Employment Security/Unemployment, and Department of Licensing. If
necessary, other sources such as the Departments of Revenue and
Corrections are accessed.</p>
<p><strong>How long does a quick locate stay open in Washington
State?</strong></p>
<p>The typical life of a quick locate in Washington State is four
days or fewer. Upon receipt of the locate request, a computer case
is set up; by the next day automated sources are manually checked
and the case is then closed . The response is returned to the
initiating jurisdiction electronically. If the requesting state
decides to pursue the case as a formal interstate case, the "shell"
computer case can be reopened.</p>
<p><strong>What about quick locates to and from other states?</strong></p>
<p>The Washington Central Registry receives and processes outgoing
interstate locates from its county prosecutors and field offices
usually with the FSA 206, the quick locate data sheet. The registry
rarely sends a full locate request to another state. Again, when we
receive an FSA 206 or its facsimile from a state outside the
network, we check our automated sources and respond within
days.</p>
<p>If we receive a full locate from another state (FSA 200), <u>we
must keep the case open for three years.</u> In an effort to
compress this time, we will ask the other state for permission to
close the case earlier, but the response must be received in
writing from the other jurisdiction... a time-consuming and costly
process.</p>
<p>However, because of the overall efficiency of the quick locate
plus team work, we do not have a locate backlog in Washington.
There are four teams in the Central Registry with an alpha locate
responsibility. If one team becomes overburdened, the other teams
offer quick assistance.</p>
<p>We encourage all states to use quick locate, and to make
agreements with neighboring states to facilitate effective use of
the procedure.</p>
