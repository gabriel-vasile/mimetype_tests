     <STRONG>DESCRIPTION</STRONG>
          The <STRONG>blt_graph</STRONG> command creates a new  window  (given  by  the
          <EM>pathName</EM>  argument)  and  makes  it  into  an  graph widget.
          Additional options, described above, may be specified on the
          command  line or in the option database to configure aspects
          of the graph such as its colors  and  font.   The  <STRONG>blt_graph</STRONG>
          command  returns  its  <EM>pathName</EM>  argument.  At the time this
          command is invoked, there must  not  exist  a  window  named
          <EM>pathName</EM>, but <EM>pathName</EM>'s parent must exist.

          The <STRONG>blt_graph</STRONG> widget plots two-variable data in a window. It
          has  of  several  components; coordinate axes, crosshairs, a
          legend, and a collection of elements and tags.

        <STRONG>COORDINATE</STRONG> <STRONG>AXES</STRONG>
          The graph widget has four axes, two standard (x and  y)  and
          two  alternate  (x2  and  y2).   Graph elements and tags are
          mapped onto one x-axis and  y-axis  (by  default,  they  are
          mapped onto the standard axes).

          Each axis consists of the axis  line  and  major  and  minor
          ticks  placed at set intervals. At major ticks, labels (text
          strings) representing the coordinate value of the  tick  are
          drawn.  By  default,  the  tick  labels  are  simply numeric
          strings.  However,  a  Tcl  procedure  can  be  supplied  to
          individually format each tick label.

          The scale of the axis is determined its minimum and  maximum
          limits.  By default, each axis is auto-scaled using the data
          limits.  However either limit can be set to  manually  scale
          the graph.

        <STRONG>CROSSHAIRS</STRONG>
          Crosshairs are a set of two lines (vertical and  horizontal)
          which  intersect  on  the graph.  They are implemented using
          XOR drawing primitives, so they do not require the graph  to
          be redrawn when they are moved or redisplayed.

        <STRONG>ELEMENTS</STRONG>
          A graph element is a set of data  points  and  configuration
          options which determine how the data is displayed.  Elements
          are created by  the  <STRONG>element</STRONG>  <STRONG>create</STRONG>  widget  command.   The
          configuration  options  may  be  specified as the element is
          created or later by the <STRONG>element</STRONG>  <STRONG>configure</STRONG>  widget  command.
          There  is  an  internal  display list of element names which
          controls the drawing order  of  the  elements.  By  default,
          elements  are  appended  to  the  display  list  as they are
          created.  The element display list can  be  managed  by  the
          <STRONG>element</STRONG> <STRONG>show</STRONG> command.

        <STRONG>LEGEND</STRONG>
          The legend consists of a list of entries, where  each  entry
          is  an  element symbol and label.  By default, the legend is
          located in the right margin  of  the  graph.   However,  the
          legend may appear anywhere in the plotting area of the graph
          by specifying its window coordinates.

        <STRONG>TAGS</STRONG>
          Tags are simple  drawing  procedures  used  to  annotate  or
          highlight  areas  of  the  graph. A tag may be either a text
          string, bitmap, line, window, or  polygon.   A  tag  may  be
          associated  with  a  particular  element, so that the tag is
          displayed only if the element is displayed.   Tags  are  the
          first  items  drawn  when  the  graph  is displayed, so that
          elements, symbols, legend, and axes always appear  in  front
          of them.

          Tags differ from elements in that they  do  not  affect  the
          auto-scaling of coordinate axes.  Furthermore, tags can have
          <EM>elastic</EM> coordinates (specified by -Inf and Inf respectively)
          which translate into the axis minimum or maximum limit.  For
          example, to place a tag so it always remains  in  the  lower
          left corner of the plot, use the coordinates -Inf,-Inf.

     <STRONG>WIDGET</STRONG> <STRONG>COMMANDS</STRONG>
          The <STRONG>blt_graph</STRONG> command creates a new Tcl command  whose  name
          is  <EM>pathName</EM>.   This  command  may be used to invoke various
          operations on the widget.  It has the general form:

               <EM>pathName</EM> <EM>option</EM> ?<EM>arg</EM> <EM>arg</EM> ...?
9          <EM>Option</EM> and the <EM>arg</EM>s determine  the  exact  behavior  of  the
          widgets:

          <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>configure</STRONG> ?<EM>options</EM>...?
               Queries or modifies the configuration  options  of  the
               widget. Valids options are described in

          <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>crosshairs</STRONG> <STRONG>configure</STRONG> ?<EM>options</EM>...?
               Queries or modifies the configuration  options  of  the
               crosshairs.   This  command is similar to the <STRONG>configure</STRONG>
               command, except that it applies to the options  of  the
               crosshairs,  whereas  <STRONG>configure</STRONG>  applies to the options
               for the graph as a whole.  See  for  a  description  of
               valid options.

          <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>crosshairs</STRONG> <STRONG>toggle</STRONG>
               Toggles the current state of  the  crosshairs,  turning
               them on or off.  This command returns an empty string.

          <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>element</STRONG> <STRONG>activate</STRONG> <EM>name</EM> ?<EM>index</EM>...?
               Specifies which data points of element <EM>name</EM> are  to  be
               drawn  using  active  foreground and background colors.
               <EM>Name</EM> is the name of the element and <EM>index</EM> is  a  number
               representing the index of the data point. If no indices
               are present then all data points become  active.   This
               command returns the empty string.

          <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>element</STRONG> <STRONG>append</STRONG> <EM>name</EM> <EM>coords</EM>
               Appends pairs of  x,y  data  points  to  element  <EM>name</EM>.
               <EM>coords</EM>  is  a  list  of  numeric expressions (x,y graph
               coordinates) representing data points.  It returns  the
               empty string.

          <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>element</STRONG> <STRONG>closest</STRONG> <EM>winX</EM> <EM>winY</EM> ?<EM>name</EM>...?
               Finds the data point closest to the window  coordinates
               <EM>winX</EM>  and  <EM>winY</EM> in the element <EM>name</EM>.  It returns a list
               containing the name of the closest element,  the  index
               of  its closest point, and the graph x,y coordinates of
               the  point.   If  no  data  point  within  a  threshold
               distance  can be found (see the <STRONG>-halo</STRONG> option), then the
               empty list  is  returned.   <EM>Name</EM>  is  the  name  of  an
               element,  which  must  be  mapped.   If no elements are
               specified, then all mapped elements are searched.

          <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>element</STRONG> <STRONG>configure</STRONG> <EM>name</EM> ?<EM>options</EM>...?
               This command  is  similar  to  the  <STRONG>configure</STRONG>  command,
               except  that it applies to the options of an individual
               element, whereas <STRONG>configure</STRONG> applies to the  options  for
               the  graph  as  a  whole.   <EM>Options</EM> may have any of the
               values accepted by the <STRONG>element</STRONG> <STRONG>create</STRONG>  widget  command.
               See for a description of valid options.


               Creates a new element <EM>name</EM> in the graph.  Element names
               must  be  unique,  so <EM>name</EM> can not already exist in the
               graph.  If  additional  arguments  are  present,   they
               specify any of the element options (see ).

          <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>element</STRONG> <STRONG>deactivate</STRONG> <EM>name</EM> ?<EM>name</EM>...?
               Deactivate the named elements.  The  elements  will  be  |
               redrawn  using  their  normal foreground and background  |
               colors.  <EM>Name</EM> is the name of the element. This  command  |
               returns the empty string.

          <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>element</STRONG> <STRONG>delete</STRONG> <STRONG>?</STRONG><EM>name</EM> ...?
               Deletes the element <EM>name</EM> from the  graph.  Returns  the
               empty string.

          <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>element</STRONG> <STRONG>names</STRONG>
               Returns a list  of  all  elements.  This  differs  from
               <STRONG>element</STRONG>  <STRONG>show</STRONG>  in  that  it  returns  the  names of all
               elements, not just those in the element display list.

          <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>element</STRONG> <STRONG>show</STRONG> ?<EM>names</EM>?
               Queries or resets the element display list. The element
               display  list  defines  which elements are drawn and in
               what order. <EM>Names</EM> is a  list  of  the  elements  to  be
               displayed.   If there is no <EM>names</EM> argument, the list of
               elements currently being displayed is returned.

          <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>invtransform</STRONG> <EM>winX</EM> <EM>winY</EM>
               Performs an inverse coordinate transformation,  mapping
               x,y  window coordinates to graph coordinates (using the
               standard x and y axes). Returns a  list  of  containing
               the x and y graph coordinates.

          <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>legend</STRONG> <STRONG>activate</STRONG> <EM>name</EM>...
               Specifies that the legend entries of the named elements  |
               should  be  drawn with the active legend background and  |
               foreground colors.  The entries may also be drawn  with  |
               a   different   relief  (using  the  <STRONG>-activerelief</STRONG>  and  |
               <STRONG>-activeborderwidth</STRONG> options).  <EM>Name</EM> is the  name  of  an  |
               element in the graph.

          <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>legend</STRONG> <STRONG>configure</STRONG> ?<EM>options</EM>...?
               This command  is  similar  to  the  <STRONG>configure</STRONG>  command,
               except  that  it applies to the options for the legend,
               whereas <STRONG>configure</STRONG> applies to the options for the  graph
               as a whole.  See for a description of valid options.

          <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>legend</STRONG> <STRONG>deactivate</STRONG> <EM>name</EM>...
               Specifies that the legend enties of the named  elements  |
               should   be   drawn  with  the  legend  background  and  |
               foreground colors.  <EM>Name</EM> is the name of an  element  in  |


          <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>legend</STRONG> <STRONG>get</STRONG> <EM>string</EM>
               Returns the name of the graph element  at  the  current  |
               screen  position  in the legend.  <EM>String</EM> must be in the  |
               form "@<STRONG>x</STRONG>,<STRONG>y</STRONG>", where <STRONG>x</STRONG> and <STRONG>y</STRONG> are the window  coordinates.  |
               If  the  given  screen  coordinates  do  not lie over a  |
               legend entry, the empty string is returned.

          <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>postscript</STRONG> ?<EM>fileName</EM>? ?<EM>options</EM>...?
               Generates PostScript commands to print the graph. If no
               <EM>fileName</EM>  argument is present, the PostScript output is
               returned.  Otherwise,  <EM>fileName</EM>  is  created  and  will
               contain  the PostScript output.  In this case the empty
               string is returned.   If  any  <EM>option</EM>-<EM>value</EM>  pairs  are
               present, they set configuration options controlling how
               the PostScript is generated. See for a  description  of
               valid options.

          <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>psconfigure</STRONG> ?<EM>options</EM>...?
               Queries or  modifies  the  options  of  the  <STRONG>postscript</STRONG>
               command. See for a description of valid options.

          <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>tag</STRONG> <STRONG>after</STRONG> <EM>tagId</EM> ?<EM>tagId</EM>?
               Reorders the tag display list  placing  the  first  tag
               specified   after  the  second.   If  no  second  <EM>tagId</EM>
               argument is specified, the tag is placed at the end  of
               the list.  This command can be used to control how tags
               are displayed since tags are drawn in the order of this
               display list.  The empty string is returned.

          <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>tag</STRONG> <STRONG>before</STRONG> <EM>tagId</EM> ?<EM>tagId</EM>?
               Reorders the tag display list  placing  the  first  tag
               specified  before  the  second.   If  no  second  <EM>tagId</EM>
               argument  is  specified,  the  tag  is  placed  at  the
               beginning  of  the  list.   This command can be used to
               control how tags are displayed since tags are drawn  in
               the  order  of  this display list.  The empty string is
               returned.

          <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>tag</STRONG> <STRONG>configure</STRONG> <EM>tagId</EM> ?<EM>options</EM>...?
               Queries or modifies the configuration  options  of  the
               particular   tag.   See  for  a  description  of  valid
               options.

          <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>tag</STRONG> <STRONG>coords</STRONG> <EM>tagId</EM> ?<EM>coords</EM>?
               Queries or resets the coordinates of the tag designated
               by  <EM>tagId</EM>.   If  <EM>coords</EM>  is  present,  it  is a list of
               coordinate pairs representing the points  of  the  tag.
               This  list  is  used  to  re-position  the tag.  If the
               <EM>coords</EM> argument is not present,  the  current  list  of
               coordinates for <EM>tagId</EM> is returned.

               Creates a tag of the selected type. <EM>Type</EM> may be  either
               text,  line,  bitmap,  polygon, or window.  <EM>coords</EM> is a
               list of coordinate pairs of points used to position the
               tag.   See  for  a  description of valid options.  This
               command returns a unique tag identifier, which is  used
               as the <EM>tagId</EM> argument in other tag-related commands.

          <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>tag</STRONG> <STRONG>delete</STRONG> <EM>tagId</EM> ?<EM>tagId</EM>..?
               Deletes each  of  the  specified  tags.   This  command
               returns the empty string.

          <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>tag</STRONG> <STRONG>ids</STRONG> ?<EM>pattern</EM>?
               Returns a list of IDs of tags created.  If  <EM>pattern</EM>  is
               supplied, only those tags whose IDs matching it will be
               returned.

          <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>tag</STRONG> <STRONG>type</STRONG> <EM>tagId</EM>
               Returns the type of the tag given  by  <EM>tagId</EM>,  such  as
               Line or Text. If <EM>tagId</EM> is not a valid a tag identifier,
               the empty string is returned.

          <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>transform</STRONG> <STRONG>x</STRONG> <STRONG>y</STRONG>
               Transforms   the   graph   coordinates   into    window
               coordinates,  by  mapping  the  <STRONG>x</STRONG> and <STRONG>y</STRONG> values onto the
               standard axes (x and y).  Returns a list containing the
               x  and  y  window  coordinates.  Please note that graph
               coordinates far outside  of  the  axis  range  are  not
               guarenteed to be accurate.

          <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>xaxis</STRONG> <STRONG>configure</STRONG> ?<EM>options</EM>...?

          <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>yaxis</STRONG> <STRONG>configure</STRONG> ?<EM>options</EM>...?

          <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>y2axis</STRONG> <STRONG>limits</STRONG>
               Returns a list of two  graph  coordinates  representing
               the  minimum  and  maximum  limits  of the x-axis.  The
               format of the list returned is min max.


        <STRONG>WIDGET</STRONG> <STRONG>OPTIONS</STRONG>
          The following widget options are  valid  for  the  <STRONG>configure</STRONG>
          command.

               <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>configure</STRONG> ?<EM>option</EM>? ?<EM>value</EM> <EM>option</EM> <EM>value</EM> ...?

</PRE>
<H2>9          The configure command queries or modifies the  configuration</H2><PRE>
          options of the widget.  If no <EM>option</EM> is specified, returns a
          list describing all of the available  options  for  <EM>pathName</EM>
          (see  <STRONG>Tk_ConfigureInfo</STRONG> for information on the format of this
          list). If <EM>option</EM>  is  specified  with  no  <EM>value</EM>,  then  the
          command returns a list describing the one named option (this
          list will be identical to the corresponding sublist  of  the
          value  returned  if no <EM>option</EM> is specified).  If one or more
          <EM>option</EM>-<EM>value</EM> pairs are specified, then the command  modifies
          the  given  widget  option(s) to have the given value(s); in
          this case the command returns the empty string.

          <STRONG>-bottommargin</STRONG> <EM>pixels</EM>
               Specifies the size of the margin from the  x-coordinate
               axis  to the bottom of the window.  The x-axis title is
               displayed in this margin. <EM>Pixels</EM> may  be  specified  in
               any  of the forms described in <STRONG>Tk_GetPixels</STRONG>.  If <EM>pixels</EM>
               is less than one pixel, the the margin size is selected
               automatically.

          <STRONG>-bufferelements</STRONG> <EM>boolean</EM>
               Specifies whether to use a pixmap to cache the  display  |
               of  elements.  This is especially useful when there are  |
               many data points or the graph  is  redrawn  frequently.  |
               <EM>Boolean</EM> is true by default.

          <STRONG>-halo</STRONG> <EM>pixels</EM>
               Specifies a threshold distance when searching  for  the
               closest  data  point (see the <STRONG>element</STRONG> <STRONG>closest</STRONG> command).
               Only data points within this distance are considered in
               the   search.   If  this  option  isn't  specified,  it
               defaults to 0.5i.

          <STRONG>-height</STRONG> <EM>pixels</EM>
               Specifies a desired window height that the graph widget
               should  request  from its geometry manager. The default
               height is 400.

          <STRONG>-invertxy</STRONG> <EM>boolean</EM>
               Specifies that placement of the x and y axes should  be  |
               inverted.   If <EM>boolean</EM> is true, the x-axis is exchanged  |
               with the y-axis.  By default <EM>boolean</EM> is false.

          <STRONG>-leftmargin</STRONG> <EM>pixels</EM>
               Sets the size of the margin from the left edge  of  the
               window  to the the y-coordinate axis.  The y-axis title


          <STRONG>-plotbackground</STRONG> <EM>color</EM>
               Sets the background color of the plotting area.

          <STRONG>-plotborderwidth</STRONG> <EM>pixels</EM>
               Sets the width of the 3-D border  to  draw  around  the
               outside  of  the plotting area (if such border is being
               drawn; the  <STRONG>plotrelief</STRONG>  option  determines  this).   By
               default is the plot border width is 2.

          <STRONG>-plotrelief</STRONG> <EM>string</EM>
               Specifies the 3-D effect desired for the plotting area.
               <EM>String</EM>  must  be in a form accepted by <STRONG>Tk_GetRelief</STRONG>. It
               indicates how the interior of the plotting area  should
               appear  relative  to  rest  of  the graph; for example,
               raised means the plot should appear  to  protrude  from
               the  graph,  relative  to the surface of the graph.  By
               default, the plot relief is sunken.

          <STRONG>-rightmargin</STRONG> <EM>pixels</EM>
               Sets the size of marging from the plotting area to  the
               right  edge  of  the window.  By default, the legend is
               displayed in this margin. If Ipixels  is  than  1,  the
               margin size is selected automatically.

          <STRONG>-title</STRONG> <EM>string</EM>
               Specifies the title of the graph.   If  <EM>string</EM>  is  the

          <STRONG>-topmargin</STRONG> <EM>pixels</EM>
               Sets the size of the marging the top edge of the window
               to  the plotting area.  The graph title is displayed in
               this margin. If <EM>pixels</EM> is less than 1, the margin  size
               is selected automatically.

          <STRONG>-width</STRONG> <EM>pixels</EM>
               Specifies a desired window width that the graph  widget
               should  request from its geometry manager.  The default
               width is 400.

          by  the  <STRONG>option</STRONG>  command.   The name fields in the <STRONG>blt_graph</STRONG>
          option database are prefixed by x, y, x2, or  y2  while  the
          class  fields  are  prefixed  by Axis. The following example
          sets the color of all axes to blue and the x-axis  scale  to
          logarithmic.

               option add *Blt_graph.AxisColor blue

               defaults to black.

          <STRONG>-command</STRONG> <EM>prefix</EM>
               Specifies a Tcl command to be invoked  when  formatting
               the  axis labels.  <EM>Prefix</EM> is typically just the name of
               a Tcl procedure, but the string may also contain  extra
               arguments   for   the  procedure.   When  invoked,  two
               arguments (the path name of the graph  widget  and  the
               numeric  value  of  the axis label) are appended to the
               end of the command.  The procedure value  should  be  a
               string  representing  the formatted label. If the value
               is the empty string or if <EM>prefix</EM> is the  empty  string,
               the  default axis label is displayed.  Please note that
               this procedure is invoked during  the  display  of  the
               graph.   Resetting  graph  configurations  within  this
               procedure can cause unexpected results.

          <STRONG>-descending</STRONG> <EM>boolean</EM>
               Specifies  whether  the  values  along  the  axis   are  |
               increasing  or decreasing. If <EM>boolean</EM> is true, the axis  |
               values will decrease.   By  default,  the  axis  values  |
               increase.

          <STRONG>-font</STRONG> <EM>fontName</EM>
               Specifies the font for axis labels. If  <EM>fontName</EM>  isn't
               specified  then it defaults to *-Courier-Bold-R-Normal-
               *-100-*.

          <STRONG>-linewidth</STRONG> <EM>pixels</EM>
               Sets the line width of the axis  and  its  ticks.   The
               default line width is 0.

          <STRONG>-logscale</STRONG> <EM>boolean</EM>
               Sets  the  scale  of  the   coordinate   axis   (either
               logarithmically  or linearly).  If <EM>boolean</EM> is true, the
               axis will be displayed in logarithmic  scale.   <EM>Boolean</EM>



          <STRONG>-loose</STRONG> <EM>boolean</EM>
               Indicates that when auto-scaling  the  axis,  the  axis
               range  should fit loosely around the data points at the
               outer tick intervals. Otherwise  the  axis  range  fits
               tightly  at  the  limits  of  the  data  displayed.  By
               default, the range is tight.

          <STRONG>-mapped</STRONG> <EM>boolean</EM>
               Specifies if the axis should be displayed. By  default,
               the  standard axes are displayed (x and y), but not the
               alternate (x2 and y2).

          <STRONG>-max</STRONG> <EM>value</EM>
               Sets the  maximum  limit  of  the  axis.   Data  points
               exceeding  this  limit  are  clipped  at this value. If
               <EM>value</EM> is the empty string (the default),  the  axis  is
               auto-scaled  whereby  the  maximum  limit is determined
               from the data points of the displayed elements.

          <STRONG>-min</STRONG> <EM>value</EM>
               Sets the minimum limit of the axis.  Data  points  less
               than this limit are clipped at this value.  If <EM>value</EM> is
               the empty string (the default), the axis is auto-scaled
               whereby  the  minimum limit is determined from the data
               points of the displayed elements.

          <STRONG>-rotate</STRONG> <EM>theta</EM>
               Specifies the rotation of the axis labels.  <EM>Theta</EM> is  a
               real  number  representing  the  angle  of  rotation in
               degrees.  The default rotation is 0.0 degrees.

          <STRONG>-showticks</STRONG> <EM>boolean</EM>
               Indicates if axis ticks should be displayed. If <EM>boolean</EM>
               is true (the default), ticks are displayed.

          <STRONG>-stepsize</STRONG> <EM>value</EM>
               Sets the step size between  major  axis  ticks.   <EM>Value</EM>
               must be greater than zero and less than the axis range,
               or the requested step size is ignored and the step size
               is automatically calculated based upon the element data
               points.

          <STRONG>-subticks</STRONG> <EM>number</EM>
               Sets the number of minor axis ticks  to  be  displayed.
               By  default, the number of minor ticks is 5.  If <EM>number</EM>
               is zero, no subticks will be displayed.

          <STRONG>-ticklength</STRONG> <EM>pixels</EM>

               outside  of  the legend (if such border is being drawn;
               the <STRONG>relief</STRONG> option determines this).  By default is  the
               legend border width is 2.

          <STRONG>-font</STRONG> <EM>fontName</EM>
               <EM>FontName</EM> specifies a  font  to  use  when  drawing  the
               labels of each element into the legend.  If this option
               isn't specified then it defaults  to  *-Helvetica-Bold-

               empty   string   (the  default),  the  legend  will  be
               displayed in the right margin (which  is  automatically
               extended to accommodate the legend).

          <STRONG>-relief</STRONG> <EM>string</EM>
               Specifies  the  3-D  effect  desired  for  the  legend.
               <EM>String</EM>  must  be in a form accepted by <STRONG>Tk_GetRelief</STRONG>. It
               indicates how  the interior of the legend should appear
               relative  to  the  graph; for example, raised means the
               legend  should  appear  to  protrude  from  the  graph,
               relative  to the surface of the graph.  By default, the
               legend relief is sunken.

          pairs may be used in the <STRONG>tag</STRONG> <STRONG>configure</STRONG> command to change the
          tag's configuration.  The following  options  are  supported
          for text tags:

          <STRONG>-anchor</STRONG> <EM>anchorPos</EM>
               <EM>AnchorPos</EM> tells how to position the  text  relative  to
               the  positioning point for the text; it may have any of
               the forms accepted by <STRONG>Tk_GetAnchor</STRONG>.   For  example,  if
               <EM>anchorPos</EM>  is  center  then the text is centered on the
               point; if <EM>anchorPos</EM> is n then the text  will  be  drawn
               such  that  the  top  center  point  of the rectangular
               region occupied by the text will be at the  positioning
               point.  This option defaults to center.

          <STRONG>-background</STRONG> <EM>color</EM>
               Sets the background color of the text string. If  <EM>color</EM>
               is   the   empty   string,   the   background  will  be
               transparent.  If this option isn't  specified  then  it
               defaults to white.

          <STRONG>-font</STRONG> <EM>fontName</EM>
               Specifies  the  text  font.   If  this   option   isn't
               specified,   it  defaults  *-Helvetica-Bold-R-Normal-*-
               120-*.

          <STRONG>-foreground</STRONG> <EM>color</EM>
               Sets the foreground color of the text. If  this  option

          <STRONG>-element</STRONG> <EM>name</EM>
               Associates the tag with the element <EM>name</EM>.  If  <EM>name</EM>  is
               not   the  empty  string  (the  default),  the  tag  is
               displayed only if <EM>name</EM> exists and  is  currently  being

               The tag is first rotated along its center and  is  then
               displayed according to its anchor position. The default
               rotation is 0.0 degrees.

          <STRONG>-text</STRONG> <EM>string</EM>
               Sets the text string.  The exact way in which the  text

          representing  the  graph  coordinate  pairs  of  the  points
          connecting the line.

          After the <EM>coords</EM> there may be  any  number  of  <EM>option</EM>-<EM>value</EM>
          pairs,  each  of which sets one of the configuration options

               <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>tag</STRONG> <STRONG>create</STRONG> <STRONG>polygon</STRONG> ?<EM>coords</EM>? ?<EM>options</EM>...?
9          The argument <EM>coords</EM> specifies a list of numeric  expressions
          representing  graph  coordinates  which  describe the closed
          polygon.  It is  assumed  the  first  and  last  points  are
          connected.

          After the  coordinate  list  there  may  be  any  number  of
          <EM>option</EM>-<EM>value</EM>   pairs,   each   of  which  sets  one  of  the
          configuration options for the tag.  These same  <EM>option</EM>-<EM>value</EM>
          pairs may be used in the <STRONG>tag</STRONG> <STRONG>configure</STRONG> command to change the
          tag's configuration.  The following  options  are  supported
          for polygon tags:

          <STRONG>-background</STRONG> <EM>color</EM>
               Sets the background color of the polygon.  The  default
               background color is white.

          <STRONG>-dashes</STRONG> <EM>dashes</EM>
               Sets the dash style of the outline around the  polygon.  |
               <EM>Dashes</EM> is the number of alternatingly displayed pixels.  |
               If <EM>dashes</EM> is 0 (the default), the outline will be drawn  |
               as a solid line.

          <STRONG>-element</STRONG> <EM>name</EM>
               Associates the tag with the element <EM>name</EM>.  If  <EM>name</EM>  is
               not   the  empty  string  (the  default),  the  tag  is
               displayed only if <EM>name</EM> exists and  is  currently  being
               displayed (see <STRONG>element</STRONG> <STRONG>show</STRONG>).

          <STRONG>-foreground</STRONG> <EM>color</EM>
               Sets the foreground color of the polygon.  The  default
               foreground color is black.

          <STRONG>-linewidth</STRONG> <EM>pixels</EM>
               Sets the width of the outline of the polygon. If <EM>pixels</EM>  |
               is zero, no outline is drawn. The default width is 0.

               Indicates that the  polygon  should  be  drawn  with  a
               stippled  pattern  rather  than  a  solid color; <EM>bitmap</EM>
               specifies the stipple pattern to use,  in  any  of  the
               forms accepted by <STRONG>Tk_GetBitmap</STRONG>.  If <EM>bitmap</EM> is the empty
               string (the default), then the polygon is filled with a
               solid (foreground) color.

          <STRONG>-xoffset</STRONG> <EM>pixels</EM>
               Specifies   an   x-coordinate   offset    (in    window
               coordinates)  from  the specified position. The default
               offset is 0.

          <STRONG>-yoffset</STRONG> <EM>pixels</EM>
               Specifies a y-coordinate offset (in window coordinates)
               from the specified position. The default is offset 0.


        <STRONG>WINDOW</STRONG> <STRONG>TAGS</STRONG>
          A window  tag  displays  a  particular  window  at  a  given
          position  on  the  graph.   Window tags are created with the
          widget command:

               <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>tag</STRONG> <STRONG>create</STRONG> <STRONG>window</STRONG> ?<EM>coords</EM>? ?<EM>options</EM>...?
9          The argument <EM>coords</EM> specifies a list  containing  the  graph
          coordinates  of  a  point used to position the window on the
          display After <EM>coords</EM>, there may be  any  number  of  <EM>option</EM>-
          <EM>value</EM>  pairs,  each  of  which sets one of the configuration
          options for the tag.  These same <EM>option</EM>-<EM>value</EM> pairs  may  be
          used  in  the  <STRONG>tag</STRONG>  <STRONG>configure</STRONG>  command  to  change the tag's
          configuration.  The  following  options  are  supported  for
          window tags:

          <STRONG>-anchor</STRONG> <EM>anchorPos</EM>
               <EM>AnchorPos</EM> tells how to position the window relative  to
               the  positioning point for the window;  it may have any
               of the forms accepted by <STRONG>Tk_GetAnchor</STRONG>.  For example, if
               <EM>anchorPos</EM>  is center then the window is centered on the
               point;  if <EM>anchorPos</EM> is  n  then  the  window  will  be
               displayed  such  that  the  top  center  point  of  the
               rectangular region occupied by the window  will  be  at
               the positioning point.  This option defaults to center.

          <STRONG>-mapx</STRONG> <EM>type</EM>
               Specifies which x-axis to map the  tag's  x-coordinates
               onto.  <EM>Type</EM> must be either x, x2, or both.  The default
               axis is x.

               Specifies the width to assign to the tag's window.   If
               this  option  isn't specified, or if it is specified as
               the empty string, then the  window  is  given  whatever
               width it requests internally.

          <STRONG>-window</STRONG> <EM>pathName</EM>
               Specifies the window to be managed by the  graph.   The
               window  specified  by  <EM>pathName</EM>  must be a child of the
               <STRONG>blt_graph</STRONG> widget.

          <STRONG>-xoffset</STRONG> <EM>pixels</EM>
               Specifies   an   x-coordinate   offset    (in    window
               coordinates)  from  the specified position. The default
               offset is 0.

          <STRONG>-yoffset</STRONG> <EM>pixels</EM>
               Specifies a y-coordinate offset (in window coordinates)

          <STRONG>-colormode</STRONG> <EM>mode</EM>
               Specifies how to output color information.   <EM>Mode</EM>  must
               be  either <STRONG>color</STRONG> (for full color output), gray (convert
               all colors to their  gray-scale  equivalents)  or  mono
               (convert  foreground  colors  to  black  and background
               colors to white).  The default mode is color.

          <STRONG>-fontmap</STRONG> <EM>varName</EM>
               <EM>VarName</EM> must be the name of  a  global  array  variable
               that  specifies  a font mapping from the X font name to
               PostScript.  Each element of <EM>varName</EM> must consist of  a
               Tcl  list  with one or two elements, which are the name
               and point size of a PostScript font.   When  outputting
               PostScript commands for a particular font, Tk checks to
               see if <EM>varName</EM> contains an element with the  same  name
               as  the  specified  font.  If there is such an element,
               then the font information contained in that element  is
               used  in  the PostScript output.  (If the point size is
               omitted from the list, the point size of the X font  is
               used).   Otherwise the X font is examined in an attempt
               to guess what PostScript font to use.  This works  only
               for  fonts  whose  foundry  property  is <EM>Adobe</EM> (such as
               Times, Helvetica, Courier, etc.).  If all of this fails
               then the font defaults to Helvetica-Bold.

          <STRONG>-landscape</STRONG> <EM>boolean</EM>
               If <EM>boolean</EM> is true, this specifies the printed area  is
               to  be rotated 90 degrees.  In non-rotated output the <STRONG>x</STRONG>
               axis of the printed area runs along the short dimension
               of  the  page  (``portrait''  orientation);  in rotated
               output the <STRONG>x</STRONG> axis runs along the long dimension of  the
               page (``landscape'' orientation).  Defaults to false.

          <STRONG>-pageanchor</STRONG> <EM>anchor</EM>
               Specifies which point of the  printed  area  should  be
               appear over the positioning point on the page (which is
               given by the <STRONG>-pagex</STRONG> and <STRONG>-pagey</STRONG> options).  For  example,
               <STRONG>-pageanchor</STRONG>  <STRONG>n</STRONG> means that the top center of the printed

          <STRONG>-pagewidth</STRONG> <EM>size</EM>
               Specifies  that  the  width  of  the  graph  drawn   in
               PostScript.   The  graph  is <EM>not</EM> uniformly scaled since
               this also scales the fonts.   <EM>Size</EM>  may  be  any  value
               accepted by <STRONG>Tk_GetPixels</STRONG>.  The resulting pixel value is
               then converted  to  postscript  printer  points.   This
               means  that  a width <EM>6.5i</EM> will be properly converted to
               6.5 inches. This options defaults to the width  of  the
               graph window.

          <STRONG>-pagex</STRONG> <EM>position</EM>
               Specifies the  x-coordinate  of  the  page  positioning
               point.   This  (with  the <STRONG>-pageanchor</STRONG> option) indicates
               where the graph  is  placed  on  the  PostScript  page.
               <EM>Position</EM> may be any value accepted by <STRONG>Tk_GetPixels</STRONG>. The
               resulting pixel value is then converted  to  postscript
               printer points.  The default is 1i.

          <STRONG>-pagey</STRONG> <EM>position</EM>
               Specifies the  y-coordinate  of  the  page  positioning
               point.   This  (with  the <STRONG>-pageanchor</STRONG> option) indicates
               where the graph  is  placed  on  the  PostScript  page.
               <EM>Position</EM> may be any value accepted by <STRONG>Tk_GetPixels</STRONG>. The
               resulting pixel value is then converted  to  postscript
               printer points.  The default is 1i.

     <STRONG>SETTING</STRONG> <STRONG>DATA</STRONG> <STRONG>FROM</STRONG> <STRONG>C</STRONG>
          The data points of any element can be reset from a C routine
          using  the  convenience function <STRONG>Blt_GraphElement</STRONG>.  This can
          be useful  in  situations  where  it  is  too  expensive  to
          translate  the  data  values  from  string  representations.
          Another possible use could be to read in special  data  file
          formats.

          int Blt_GraphElement(interp, pathName, elemName, numValues, valueArr)
              Tcl_Interp *interp;         /* Interpreter of the graph widget */
              char *pathName;             /* Path name of the graph widget */
              char *elemName;             /* Name of the element to reset */
              int numValues;              /* Number of values in array */

          Auto-scale routines do not use requested min/max  limits  as

          The needs to be a special mapping for  undefined  log  scale
          values  (&gt;=  0.0). Possibly set up a "red zone" of undefined
          values which divides the positive and negative values.

          The PostScript output generated for polygons with more  than
          1500  points  may  exceed  the  limits of some printers (See
          PostScript Language Reference Manual, page 568).  The  work-
          around is to break the polygon into separate pieces.
