[presiding] The Subcommittee will come to order.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">This is the Subcommittee on Early
Childhood, Youth, and Families, and if our first panelists can find their way to
their seats, that would be appreciated.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Let me, first, thank everybody for
being here. I will make an opening statement. Mr. Kildee, who is the ranking
member, meaning the senior member in the party not in power at the present time,
will make an opening statement as well. They will be the only two opening
statements. They will each be no more than five minutes in length. We will then
go to the statements by all of you. We will start with Mr. Campbell and work
right down. You will each have five minutes, as well. There will be a green
light, and then a yellow light, and then a red light. You don't have to take all
of your time if you don't want to, at all. Then each member will be allowed to
ask questions, and the questions and answers together will take five minutes
also, and they can ask questions of any one of you, or any one of you can
volunteer and answer anything.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">We also appreciate the chairman of the
Full Committee Mr. Goodling of Pennsylvania, being here.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Let me thank everybody else, also, for
joining this Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Youth, and Families, as we look at
the issue of school violence here today. More than leaving an indelible mark in
our hearts and in our minds, the recent tragedy in Littleton, Colorado, serves
as an important reminder that no school has the luxury of summarily dismissing
school violence as an urban problem. As Columbine High School joins the
community of schools attempting to restore normalcy to the lives of its students
and teachers, we are challenged to cast off our stereotypes and to examine these
acts of violence in a new light.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">As our witnesses well know, these
tragedies can replay themselves at any school. While I cannot undo the harm that
has been caused, or reclaim the lives which have been lost, I will do my part to
search for the answers that will ease the minds of our students and make our
schools less vulnerable to future acts of violence.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Some believe that this calls for
tighter controls on firearms, with proposals ranging from the outright
prohibition of handguns for anyone under age 21, to criminal liability for
parents who knowingly and recklessly permit a child to have access to a gun that
is subsequently used in a violent act.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Others believe that we need to focus on
the so-called culture of death, and assign some degree of responsibility to
those who seek to profit from graphic simulations of death and destruction on
television, and in video games.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Still others believe that incidents
like these can only be addressed by filling the void in the lives of those
troubled teenagers, either through programs to build self-esteem, or faith-based
organizations.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">At this point, only one thing is clear
to me. There is no single solution to the problem of school violence. We must
move beyond the temptation to point the finger of blame at any one particular
industry or event. Just as no one factor led these children to commit acts of
violence, there is no one panacea for all of our Nation's ills.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Instead, as a first step, we must
develop a better understanding of the many circumstances that will cause a
student to level a weapon against his classmates. In this effort, everything
must be on the table, from guns and culture, to parents and communities. To
exclude any possible factor would be an injustice to those seated before us and
the countless others who have suffered the physical and emotional scars of
school violence.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I also believe that Congress has a role
in answering the question of how to prevent future acts of violence. In fact,
one of the purposes of this hearing is to examine the Federal role in prevention
efforts. Yet, as we struggle to find the proper role for the Federal Government,
we should resist the temptation to advance legislation in a mere attempt to
score political points, only to forget the hard lessons of the Columbine
classroom.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Finally, school violence, and, in
particular, the rash of school shootings, is not a problem that our schools or
the Federal government can solve alone. More than law or regulatory fiat, it
will take a wholistic response that incorporates the best ideas of schools,
families, communities, and every level of government.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">It will also take families and teachers
listening to the concerns of their children, and children willing to talk to
parents and other trusted adults. Rest assured that I will do my part to listen
to what others have to offer and make an enlightened contribution to our goal of
achieving a safer and smarter society.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Today we will hear from those directly
impacted by recent episodes of school violence. I commend our witnesses for
their courage in sharing their experiences with us. Their insights will be a
constructive force for prevention, and I know we all appreciate their
willingness to join us this afternoon. Mr. Kildee?</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mr. Kildee</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm pleased to join Governor Castle at this hearing on
school violence. While today's topic is not pleasant, the occurrence of recent
shootings and the plague of school violence in our schools requires this
committee to examine why this is happening and what can be done.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The safety of our young people and the
quality of their learning environment is too important to ignore. I say this as
a former high school teacher, as a father of three children who have graduated
from high school in the last decade, and as the grandfather of two who will be
entering school in the next few years.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I want to briefly start by
acknowledging the courage of our witnesses here today in appearing before this
Subcommittee. You've had school violence touch you in a very personal way. I
know that it may difficult for some of you to talk about your experiences, but I
assure you that Governor Castle and I very much appreciate you being here today.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">When a incident of school violence
happens, it is not only an issue for teachers, principals, parents, and
students, but one that impacts the entire community. Therefore, the prevention
of school violence must incorporate a community response, not one that is
limited to a school or a classroom. Without a total commitment from the
community surrounding this school, violence can and still will remain a problem.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Very often, societal, familial, or
psychological problems lead to violence, and the school can become the arena
where that violence is carried out.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">It is my hope that Governor Castle and
I take away a better understanding of how such horrible acts of violence can
occur in our schools, what leads students to commit those acts, and what can be
done to prevent those acts in the future.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I believe the witnesses that are before
us today, many of them with their own personal experiences of school violence,
can guide us in our work to answer those very important questions. Mr. Chairman,
I yield back the balance of my time.</font></p>

We will have very brief introductions. Two of the introductions will be done by
other members of Congress who represent some of the young students who are here.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The very first one, Mr. Campbell, will
be introduced by Mr. Tancredo. Our hearts have gone out to him, as well. He not
only represents this area, but lives very close to Columbine High School. We
will call on him for the introduction. Mr. Tancredo?</font></p>
<font FACE="Century Schoolbook" SIZE="1">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mr. Tancredo</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Today is the 19th anniversary of the eruption
of Mount St. Helens. Radio reports today carried accounts of various eye
witnesses. I heard one say that it was a life-altering experience, and that from
that moment on, his life had been quantified as pre or post eruption.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I know the feeling. A little less than
a month ago, the lives of my neighbors and mine were changed forever. We can
never go back to being the quiet little community in which we have lived and
raised our families. When I go home, I sense that there is a surreal blanket of
shock covering the community. Theaters, restaurants, and shopping malls are
emptier. When folks do gather, they tend to do so in family groups, and they
seem to be walking closer together, holding each other's hands more, and simply
experiencing the pleasure of kinship that is so often sacrificed to the demands
of everyday living.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">There are, of course, 13 families in
our community that cannot enjoy this simple pleasure because of an act so
heinous that our minds strain to comprehend it. I have observed that, in regard
to the event at Columbine High School, that there is a thin veneer separating
civilization from barbarism, separating good from evil. On April 20, 1999, that
veneer wore through in Littleton, Colorado.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">All of us, whether in the halls of
Congress, or in the workplace lunchrooms, try to comfort each other and our own
troubled hearts by attempting to identify the forces that rub away at that
veneer. We do so in the hope that in identifying them, they can be arrested.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">American culture has also evidenced a
violent nature. We, as a Nation, were born in it. Our history is replete with
it. What does appear to be unique to this generation is the dimension of
children killing children. My son, soon after the tragedy, wrote an article in
which he laid out the cultural abrasives he believed contribute to the creation
of children without a conscience. He said, &quot;adult society complacently
indulges the destruction of cultural traditions. Legal norms are in shambles.
Murderers and perjurers escape punishment, and civil justice has become an
elaborate shake-down scheme. Rampant materialism fuels a vicious cycle of
decadent consumption and unending labor. Finally, cynicism and lassitude are the
adult responses to the widespread cultural decay.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">He goes on, ``our culture not only
whispers, but veritably screams that anything goes. While this is the cultural
undertow, the current at the surface holds up ideals that are betrayed almost
immediately. Democracy is in disrepair, big business alternatingly rents, seeks,
or foists cultural rot onto the complacent public, and education is
mindnumbingly awash in psychological fads. This surely is a spiritual darkness
that permeates the moral landscape of our Nation.''</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">But, our task is to now forego cursing
its existence, and begin to light the candles that will pierce it. There is
cause to hope. There are signs of rainbows in what is otherwise a very dark sky.
Everywhere across this land, parents are re-connecting with their children.
Millions of individuals are seeking a spiritual dimension to their lives, and
the peace of heart that passes all understanding.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Millions have been able to fill the
hole in their souls by contemplating the bravery of little Cassie Brunal, who
dared answer &quot;Yes&quot; when her assailants asked her if she believed in
God.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Ed Jones recently wrote a column for
the Charlotte Observer entitled, &quot;Littleton May Begin a Turnaround for
America.&quot; In it he said, &quot;could it be that the hammer blows of
Littleton are directing us back to our true center? Could if be that what we are
witnessing is the spectacle of a proud, secular America being humiliated,
brought to its knees, not by a Hitler, or a Stalin, or a Milosovich, but by its
own children?&quot; It may be the children also who will lead us out of this
nihilistic wilderness.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mr. Chairman, today we are joined by
Adam Campbell, a student from Columbine High School, along with a parent whose
children were in Columbine on the day of tragedy. I am proud to welcome them to
this Committee and anxious to listen and learn from their experiences. We do
this in the hope that we will be led to the knowledge of what we, in this body,
can try to do to strengthen that indispensable veneer which shields us from the
ravages of unbridled evil. Mr. Campbell is a senior at Columbine High School in
Littleton, Colorado. While he fortunately escaped from the school unharmed, some
of his friends were not as fortunate.</font></p>

</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Chairman Castle</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
Thank you very much, Mr. Tancredo. We will introduce the others and go down the
line. By necessity, they will be somewhat briefer, but it is no less heartfelt
to have all of you here.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The second witness will be Mr. Stephen
Keene. He is a senior at Heath High School in Paducah, Kentucky. Mr. Keene
attended Heath at the time of the school shooting there, in December of 1997.
Mr. Keene has a unique perspective on events at Heath, as the shooter shot his
brother that day.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Ms. Carla Williams is our third
witness. Ms. Williams also attends Sherwood High School in Sandy Spring,
Maryland, where she is about to complete her senior year. Ms. Williams is
involved in student government and currently serves as the secretary.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mr. Atteberry will be introduced by Mr.
Wu.</font></p>
<font FACE="Century Schoolbook" SIZE="1">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mr. Wu</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The tragedy at Columbine was heartbreaking for all
Americans, but it was particularly difficult for the people of Oregon, where we
endured a similar tragedy almost exactly a year ago, at Thurston High School in
Springfield, Oregon.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Today it is my privilege to introduce
two brave Oregonians who tell the tale of school violence from an all too close
perspective. Student Ryan Atteberry and teacher Bill Smith, were on the scene as
a 15 year-old student used a gun to turn his misdirected rage on his classmates.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Now is the time to begin the search for
answers, whether it is by making it easier for parents to spend more time with
their children, by better educating young people about the value of human life,
by simply opening up the channels of communication so that it is more okay for
young people to speak with adults about challenges and issues, and, by the way,
that is the most commonly raised issue when I visit the many high schools in my
Congressional district.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Some will focus on the tools of
violence, guns, while others will focus on the mind and spirit which guides the
hand which holds the gun. I believe that we must begin a search for answers
without prior prejudice as to what those answers might be, and where this trail
of inquiry may lead us.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The one thing that we cannot do is to
give in to a feeling of helplessness about this wave which is sweeping America.
I thank Ryan for having the courage to be here today, and to help us to find
better ways to intervene and to prevent these acts before they occur. Thank you
very much for coming to Washington.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Chairman Castle</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
Thank you, Mr. Wu. The fifth witness will be Bridgid Moriarty, who is a senior
at Sherwood High School in Sandy Spring, Maryland. The Sherwood School
Administration of Parents recently took an aggressive stand against school
violence by searching and guarding the school in response to threats of
violence. Ms. Moriarty has worked on violence prevention by organizing a student
non-violence rally this spring.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Our final witness in this panel will be
Ms. Anita Wheeler. Ms. Wheeler attends Western High School in Baltimore, and
will graduate this spring. She also serves as a student representative on the
Baltimore school board. She has unique insight and input into school board

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">We, again, appreciate all of you being
here. As I've already explained, you will each have, if you wish it, five
minutes. We have to keep it to a fairly tight time limit. At that point, each
member here is allowed to ask questions, and that whole period also should take
five minutes. We'll alternate back and forth between the sides, and one of the
reasons that we have to stay fairly tight on the time is that we have a second
panel that is very important as well, and we need to bring them forward and have
them share some thoughts with us, also. We certainly look forward to having an
exchange with you. Hopefully, it will be mutually profitable for everybody.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mr. Campbell</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
My name is Adam Campbell. I am 18 years old, and a senior graduating from
Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado. After the Columbine incident, I
had a lot of mixed emotions. Some of my friends were not as fortunate as I was,
and it was difficult to realize that I had escaped and they did not. I feel
badly that they did not make it. Feeling safe in school after this happened was
a not a real problem for me. I had only a few days left before graduation, and I
knew I would be leaving for college.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">There were several things that played a
role in helping me after this tragedy. My friends played a huge role. We were
able to talk about what happened. I think going back over to the memorials in
the park may have helped some, too. Also, my church and family were there for
me, and I feel secure with their understanding and love. We were together and
there was unity.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Through my eyes I see good students
wanting to be popular. They were not popular. They were weird and not accepted
by the other students. Last year, some of the jocks did a lot of making fun of
them because of their unusual dress which identified them as the trenchcoat
mafia. They hated everyone. Hate will cause wrong choices. If a person has a bad
heart, you cannot change it. Only God can change a bad heart.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">In conclusion, I feel that our schools
have done as well as they can, because you cannot change or control teen
behavior. They have to make their own choices.</font></p>

MR. STEPHEN KEENE, STUDENT, HEATH HIGH SCHOOL, PADUCAH, KENTUCKY</font></a></p>
</i></b><font FACE="Century Schoolbook" SIZE="1">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mr. Keene</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
My name is Stephen Keene. I am 17 and a senior at Heath High School in Paducah,
Kentucky. My brother Craig Keene was shot in a morning prayer group on December
1, 1997. On this day, a young man named Michael Carneal walked into the school
lobby, and after we had finished praying, shot and killed three of my friends,
and wounded five of my friends, also.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I am going to talk to you about the
long-term effects of school violence. At first, we thought that after the
funeral, or at least I did, that we can bury them and things will start to get
better. It didn't. Having them not there was probably one of the most terrible
things I've ever had to deal with in my life. It got worse, almost, for me. It
was terrible. As the months progressed, and school progressed, we thought that
when school got out for the summer it was going to be just fine. It was. The
summer was fine. But, when we came back to the lobby to pray that first day at
school, it laughed at us, and reminded us of what happened a year ago.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">We thought the one-year anniversary
would bring some sort of conclusion to this terrible tragedy. It brought a sense
of accomplishment that we had made it through. We had been strong and made it
through an entire year, but memories resurfaced. Thoughts of my friends dying
resurfaced. The memories of my brother laying in a hospital bed resurfaced. The
pain didn't leave. The pain never leaves. We look for a way to get over it. We
can't. I think that is the thing that a lot of people haven't understood, that
how can we help these kids get over it? They can't. It is a part of them. It has
become who they are now.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">It is almost a subject of how we have
to help these kids now that it has already happened. They can't get over it,
fully. It is just a part of who they are, and just in this past minute, I've
taken you through a year of my life, and hardly anything has changed.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Think about the long-term effects
honestly, what you think are the long-term effects. It is obvious: fear,
anxiety, depression, loneliness, feelings of helplessness, not being able to
help yourself or your friends who are going through the same thing you are, and
a total loss of control; you lose control of your emotions. You can hardly
control yourselves sometimes because you are crying so bad. It is just the
things you have to live with now, an inability to make things right; things that
are just beyond your control. You can't control these things; we're able to
control what we do at school, and we're able to control what we do at home, but
we can't control somebody dying. That is a hard thing to deal with.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Also, in the long run, it has inspired
what has appeared to be many copycat shootings across the Nation. After ours,
Springfield, Oregon, and Columbine High School also had similar shootings. They
just seem to get bigger and bigger, with much more devastating effects than what
we had at our school.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">We look for solutions in the long run.
It is sad that we have to talk about what solutions are, anyway. I think that is
pretty sad. We are looking for a solution, and a way to gain insight on what can
be done to help our children. I believe the first place to look is in our homes.
Education needs to start with a strong moral and a strong spiritual value,
taught at home and practiced in the home.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">We cannot expect our schools to raise
children. We must bring God back into our families, and, yes, once again, hang
the 10 Commandments as a visible sign to everybody that there is good and there
is wrong in our classrooms. Teachers need to also realize that they can have
control of their own classrooms without fear of being sued or accused of
misconduct.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Ms. Williams</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
Good morning, ladies and gentleman. My name is Carla Williams, and I am a senior
at Sherwood High School. All of us are gathered here today for one reason in
particular, and that is to talk about violence in our public and private
schools.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">It is time for the students in our high
schools, middle schools, and even elementary schools, to take a stand against
violence. Recently at my school, on May 10, there was a threat that there may be
a bomb within all of the schools throughout Montgomery County. The night before
that, on May 9, my father was one of the people who spent the night at Sherwood
High School to make sure that there were no bombs planted inside of our school
building. His example gave me the courage to come to school the next day and to
face whatever the school day held for me.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">As time went on, the school was not
bombed, and nothing came of the May 10th threat. It is sad to me how someone can
take a serious incident, such as the one in Kentucky, or in Colorado, and turn
it into a joke, just because they feel that they need to be out of class that
day.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">It is important for us to educate our
children on the seriousness of these incidents, and for them to truly realize
that stopping school violence starts with them, and inside their home.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">By having this forum on violence in our
public schools, we are taking a step in the right direction, but there is so
much more that needs to be done. Stopping violence starts here, so, with that in
mind, let us all make a pledge to do whatever we can to stop violence in our
public schools. Thank you,</font></p>

Hello, my name is Ryan Atteberry. Thank you for inviting me here today. I am
here to talk about events on May 21, 1998 at Thurston High School in
Springfield, Oregon, my school.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">May 21 started like any other day. I
met some of my friends, and we went to visit my first class. The next thing I
know, I'm laying down on the ground, paralyzed, my head filling with a deaf
ringing sound.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">After a few minutes, I realized that I
could barely move my fingers and my feet. I felt much better after knowing that
I could barely move, but then I gained the ability to move around.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I realized something terrible had
happened when I noticed the blood coming out of my side. Then I realized that I
was shot. I spent five days in the hospital with tubes stuck down my throat so I
could barely breath. My throat was so swollen that it was almost shut. The
bullet was still lodged near my spine. The doctors say that they are going to
leave it in there, because it would do more damage to take it out.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I survived my injuries and have had a
full recovery. Two of my friends were not so lucky; Ben and Michael did not
survive. I am here today to encourage everyone to help stop the violence. There
is no place for violence, especially at school. We all need to work together to
solve our problems. We must use words, not violence. All of the incidents here
were a wake-up call, so when are we actually awake? Thank you.</font></p>

</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Ms. Moriarty</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
Hello, my name is Brigid Moriarty, and I am from Sherwood High School in Sandy
Spring, Maryland. Obviously, the recent violence has caused a great commotion. A
fellow student, Kady Waterhouse, who is also here today, and I organized a
student rally in response to this. We were both a little frustrated with the
small turnout, because when promoting it, we received many positive responses.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">We held this rally with the hope of
giving students a chance to do something about the increasing violence, and to
prove that they could make a difference. We had tables set up with various
things for students to pledge non-violence, and we also asked them to give us
their own ideas. Some of these were, to be more tolerant, to start teaching
non-violence at a young age, and to express their anger constructively.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Kady can also answer any further
questions about the rally. I would like to ask you right now to look to the left
and right of you, and imagine those two people dead. It is rather morbid, and
you probably don't want to think about things like that, but that is the reality
for too many who have lost friends and loved-ones in incidents of violence.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I don't think that most of here can
even fathom many of the horrendous acts of violence that have happened too many
times. I went to school on May 10, the day that Sherwood and many other schools
in Montgomery County were threatened with bombs. It was almost as if half of the
students had been eliminated by a bomb. While I knew that most of the kids had
just stayed home because they wanted to use the bomb threat as an excuse for a
day off of school, it was still eerie. I felt uneasy walking down empty halls
and attending classes with four other students, and to be watched by a policeman
as you open a locker is not fun. It does not have to be this way. Students will
not get an education if this continues.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">But, it is hard to legislate this,
because it feels like there is an insanity involved, and I truly believe that
that is part of what led to the recent tragedies, because I don't think anyone
in their right mind could blow off people's heads and cackle about it.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">It is nice to have someone to blame,
though, so we say it was the parents, or the teachers, or the local police, but
are any of those people experts in psychology? I've watched violent movies,
listened to violent music, and read violent books, and never would I ever joke
about doing something like that. So where can you draw the line? When is
thinking differently okay, and when has a child gone too far?</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">As lawmakers, you have the capacity to
change things in the legal sense. That is why we are all here today, to help you
decide how to change things, because I think it is fairly obvious that we all
know that something must be done. I don't feel that passing loads of legislation
restricting how children can dress, and what they can say or do in school, will
fix our problem. It has to be something that students are involved in, a group
effort involving students, administrators, and parents.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">We need to have some sort of program
that offers children a place to vent their anger and teach them compassion. Some
schools have small group meetings every week where the students are encouraged
to talk about what is going on in their lives. This gives them a chance to get
to know, intimately, at least a few of the other students, fellow classmates,
and an adult, either a teacher or someone else from the neighborhood.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">This can't be accomplished in math
class. We need something else to happen. The more people you know, the more
tolerant you become towards all people. Whatever it is that is initiated needs
to combat the increase in violence. The students must be involved, because if we
are not, it will just be another rule forbidding us from something or infringing
upon us, and will, most likely, not be a welcome change.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">It is interesting, when I was in Spain
this April on an exchange program, I found that they have a nickname for
violent, bloody films: Americanos. When I invited Spanish students to come and
visit me in America, some responded that they were not allowed to come because
their parents did not think that it was safe.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">In one of my classes here, we were
talking about the events that affected the entire Nation. My teacher said that
when John F. Kennedy was shot, the whole Nation stopped. Men, women, and
children, cried in the streets because of the murder of this one man. He then
asked what we thought an event was for our generation, but none of us could come
up with anything.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">People said that too many things have
happened_news of a bomb in Oklahoma, a shooting in Arkansas, a riot in
California, while sad, did not have much of an effect on us because we hear it
every day.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Now, while this incident is fresh in
our heads, we must pass legislation to aid in the security of our schools, but
we must also take a look into our own lives and ask ourselves if we have allowed
ourselves to become desensitized, and not blame society.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">We need to now do something that is
going to continue for years and years to come, because if you wait until it
happens in your neighborhood, it is too late.</font></p>

MS. ANITA WHEELER, STUDENT, BALTIMORE SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER, WESTERN HIGH SCHOOL,
BALTIMORE, MARYLAND</font></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Ms. Wheeler</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
Hello, my name is Anita Wheeler. I currently serve as student commissioner to
the new Baltimore City public school board of commissioners, and speaking to
students all over Maryland, here are some suggestions we had as a solution.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Nationwide class-size reduction. Too
often students are faced with entering a classroom with 40 other students and
only 1 teacher. This crowded environment is not a safe and nurturing learning
place for any student. Smaller classes will focus more attention on individual
students in urban areas, as well as to detect possible behavioral problems that
may be seen as a threat in the future,</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">In order to increase student
achievement and to prevent school violence, we must place our attention on
long-term remedies that will prove beneficial in the long run. My sister, who is
a fifth-grader in the Baltimore City public school system, has 38 classmates,
and only 1 teacher. There are no aides or tutors to help with the teacher's
workload. How can a teacher possibly be able to identify a troubled child when
she has to teach, as well as nurture students.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">We must seriously consider using
Federal money to reduce class size in urban areas, to reduce the rate of
violence, as well as help teachers teach more effectively, and boost student
achievement.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Professional staff training and early
intervention of troubled youth. Federally funded money should be made available
for staff training in the area of early identification and intervention of
troubled youth. What are the signs to look for, for example?</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">In Baltimore, Maryland, the Baltimore
City public school system uses local grant money, as well as Federal grant
money, to train core teachers called instructional support teachers in the
academic areas, such as science, math, language arts, and social studies. This
structure should be implemented to meet the social needs of students. For
example, cultural diversity and stress management.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">School psychologists, school
counselors, and peer mediators, should be utilized in the same way, to assist
teachers and community members in early identifying strategies. We have students
at-risk. We need to have procedures in place to prevent students from harming
others, or even themselves.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">It is our responsibility to recognize
at-risk students at an early age, preferably elementary school, and to provide
on-going support.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Parental involvement. We need to
encourage parental involvement to help prevent school violence. Parents that are
involved with and play an active role in the child's learning and school
activities help promote education, but often parents may not be available.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">It is important to recognize the
structure of families today. Often one parent, primarily female or a
grandparent, is responsible for children. Families that have both parents in the
same home are usually forced to work outside of the home as to meet the economic
strain of the household.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Time spent away from the home results
in latch-key kids, allowing children to raise themselves, or, even worse, their
siblings. I think schools need to have more community forums to address these
issues, such as school violence, and stress the importance of parental
involvement.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Federally funded programs that are
proven effective need to be put in place. No parent should have to choose
between the safety of his or her children, and education.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Utilization of student leaders to help
establish a network system. Many times, the role of student leaders is ignored.
We must utilize these valuable resources to our advantage, for they are the ones
who are in the classroom daily, and witness countless acts of violence.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Currently, my school has received
several bomb threats. Students involved in student government and other
organizations such as SHOP, Students Helping Other People, joined to establish
an anonymous network. By word of mouth, students help to find the root of the
problem, so to speak. In some cases, students were identified as making the
threats. We must encourage this student action, with the help of school
administration, parents, and teachers, to develop a way to make our school
environment a bit safer.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">On this note, I would like to comment
that my school, this Thursday, is holding a teen forum to discuss the issues of
school violence and cultural diversity.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">My conclusion is, early this year, I,
along with 100 other students, was waiting for a train. In fact, I was on my way
to a school board meeting when a young man approached me with a handgun. He went
to another male and threatened him with his life. At that point, I was genuinely
afraid, especially after constantly hearing about shootouts and innocent
bystanders being caught in the crossfire. I thank God no shots were fired.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">This is one of many examples you face
coming to and from school. This is a serious problem that we must all take
responsibility for. The Baltimore City Public School System is a great system,
oriented to solve problems with long-term solutions, not bandaid solutions. The
students hope to fulfill their dreams, and hope that you pass legislation to
control handguns. Yes, metal detectors and surveillance cameras may reduce
violence, but students need to find a way to get guns out of our schoolhouse.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Work with us, the whole school
community, to achieve this goal. We must set aside personal and economic
barriers that will prevent us from moving forward on this endeavor to keep our
schools safe. Thank you.</font></p>

Well, thank you very much, Anita. In addition to showing a lot of courage in
being here, you were very articulate and you stayed within the time limit, which
is a good lesson for all of the adults out there, and up here, from time to
time.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">We will now ask you questions. I will
start this process. I have five minutes total to get the questions out, and to
get your answers in, so I may have one or two of you answer at least the first
question, and then go to the second question.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The first question to you is simply
this: Having watched this now for four weeks, I'm impressed by the fact that
what happened at Columbine High School, maybe because of the numbers of times it
has happened before in other places, in Oregon, Kentucky, and other places in
the country, perhaps by the enormity of what happened there, but, to me, it
seems to have really galvanized the country. Everyone seems to be really focused
on this now in terms of, we really have to do something. Before it seemed to be
isolated incidents, but now everyone realizes that it is either copycat, or
there are societal problems, or something is wrong out there.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I would just like a couple of you to
share with us, if you could, whether or not that is true among children as well,
that you're a lot more focused on these problems than you were before, and your
friends are, is it discussed, it is being looked at in various ways by young
people, as well as adults? Would any of you like to take a stab at that? You can
volunteer for this. Ms. Williams, you look like you are ready. This is where the
microphones are going to be tough. You've got to move them right up next to you
when you talk, please.</font></p>

After the incidents in Columbine High School, and in Kentucky, and all the other
shootings, before those times, I never really thought about violence in our
school. I went to Sherwood High School, nothing really happened there, and I was
just there to learn. I hear in the news every day about people who are killed,
students who are killed, children who are killed, but it never really affected
me until I really, truly, realized that violence is not limited to the outside
world. It can happen anywhere at any time, and that is why we must take a stand
against violence.</font></p>

I know I tried to lead a student rally, and it was a bit frustrating because we
had maybe 20 kids show up, and we went to schools all over Montgomery County
trying to promote it, and trying to get kids to come, and when we were there
talking to them that said, &quot;Oh, yeah, let's go. That will be really
good.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Everyone is worried about it. Everyone
is talking about it. But, they're not really willing to step out there and make
a difference. I don't want to say that, because I don't know all of the students
in Montgomery County. I don't know all of the students in the United States, but
it seems like a lot of them, while they're worried about it, they don't really
think it could happen at their school. They just can't imagine it, that someone
they know could have that happen, and, I guess, we don't want to let it go until
it does happen again.</font></p>

Well, you said when you spoke in your opening statement, that you are here to
help us change things, and that is what I hope we can do as well.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Anita started to list specifically some
of the things that we can change. I'm going to throw out several topics, and I'd
be interested in the comments by any of you about whether you think any of these
things have a higher precedence in terms of what we should be changing in
society, or what we should be looking at, or maybe you have an idea or a thought
that I didn't mention that we need to hear about.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Obviously, and I'm not excluding this,
because, to me, this is most important, is the whole concept of families,
church, and community. That is evident. Without that, it is very hard to have
any kind of foundation. But, beyond that, we have whole cultural surroundings;
videos, movies, television in general. Anita mentioned the gun issue. Handguns
in particular that she mentioned. I treat the internet as something a little bit
separately from culture. The use of counselors and psychologists, peer
mediators, mentors, the treatment of other kids, that is kids who don't appear
to be in the main stream, and drugs and alcohol, are some of the things that I
list.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">We're going to run out of time here,

I think communication is a big thing, like the peer counseling and stuff like
that. Like I said, I did go to Spain this April, and it was so different to see
the kids there. They talk to each other, they talk to their parents every day
for two hours at lunch. They go home and sit there and talk to their parents
about what is bothering them, and while they didn't have any shootings, I'm sure
that there is violence there. I know it is not perfect there, but it seemed like
the everyday things, like when I'm walking down the hallway I hear people
saying, &quot;I'm going to beat you up, I'm going to do this.&quot; You don't
really hear it as much there. I think communication is the big thing, and having
kids express their anger in constructive ways, and teaching them at a young age
how to do that.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mr. Kildee</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have a two-part question, and I would like to just
move down the panel: Is the size of a high school in a factor that can
contribute to school violence? Can a school be too big? Secondly, can, or should
we do something about the divisions or cliques that often exist in high schools?
Mr. Atteberry?</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mr. Atteberry</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
I do think the size of the school does matter, because the more people you get,
the more people will get angry. Because the more people there are, our attention
will not be very high, because people might bump each other and get angry from
that, might get in a fight or not. But, it is mostly the size of the school that
really does matter, and how many people are around, and also who attends. The
more people are there, the more possible chances that some may get angry, at
least one or more.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Our anger gets really out, and it is
just a matter of how long we keep it in, and how big the explosion will be. I
always say that we are all living time bombs, and how big the explosion is how
big the stress we've had.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mr. Keene</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
I kind of disagree with him. Because Heath is a very small school. We had a
shooting there, as Columbine is a big school, and we still had shootings in both
places. Like he said, it is how big is the explosion. I think the size of the
school has maybe a difference on how many people actually get injured, whereas
we had three people killed, and I don't know for sure how many were killed at
Columbine, but there were significantly more students killed at Columbine than
at Heath High School. I think schools are different in how many kids may be
hurt, but it could happen anywhere at any school, no matter what size.</font></p>
<font FACE="Century Schoolbook" SIZE="1">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mr. Kildee</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
How about the administration of a school? You read that sometimes the principal
is not aware of certain groups or cliques within a school. Is the size of the
school a factor in that lack of awareness? I taught in a school of about 1,000
students, Flint Central High School in Flint, Michigan. I thought I knew what
was going on at school, but I didn't know everything that was going on there.
But, would the size of the school play a role in the school’s administration
not being aware of the existence of groups that are sometimes antagonistic
towards each other?</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mr. Keene</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
It could, but it would be just chance. We had groups in our school, and it still
happened, and our school is small.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Ms. Wheeler</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
I think the size is a big factor, because, as I mentioned, I think the school
should be a community where parents and teachers should be there in the learning
environment. Now, I'm not sure if there are registered organizations at
Columbine, but at my school we have registered organizations where students can
get together with the same viewpoint, as long as they don't offend others while
they are displaying them. Also, if they have anger toward other ethnic, racial
groups, maybe everyone can sit down and talk about it in a community forum, or a
teen forum, but I think we should stress the fact that the school is not just
there for learning. In some cases, in urban environments, the teacher is the
only parent a student may see. The student may look to the teacher for guidance,
because parents at home are not there for that purpose. So, I think we need to
separate urban and rural schools in that analysis, as far as school population.</font></p>

I don't think that you can really change the cliques in school, because people
form cliques as a way to get through high school, and those are their friends,
and that is who they are going to stick by if they ever have trouble.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">As for the cliques who have such hatred
within them, they are all over the country, and if they are not recruiting
inside schools, they are recruiting outside of schools, and there is nothing you
can do about it, except have, I think, peer mediation. I am a peer mediator, and
I often help people work through their problems, and that is one way of getting
to people.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mrs. McCarthy</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for holding this hearing. I think it is
extremely important.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I want to thank all of the panelists.
Mr. Keene, I know how hard it is, and I know what it is to go through the first
anniversary, and the second, and the third, and the fourth, and the fifth. It
doesn't get any easier, but life does go on. All of you have taken a step to try
to make a difference, and that means something good will come out of it, and,
hopefully, we'll take your information to try to make something good come out of
it so we can prevent the violence in our schools.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The majority of the time, our schools
are safe. People should realize that, and I don't think that we should overreact
to a lot of things. But, everything that you have talked about is something that
we have actually been talking about here in committee hearings for the last two
years, that I know of. We've had the psychologists come in, we've had Janet Reno
come in, even when we were dealing with a different subject, and talking about
mental health, certainly in the younger years. And when you are talking your
counselors, and how much mental health we are giving to our school students,
we're not doing it. And, of course, I came here to Congress because of gun
violence, and something I will fight for, and something I do believe in. With
all of the problems that we can hopefully solve, and there are conflicts, and I
think everybody on both sides of the aisle will agree on that, but we do believe
that the easy access to guns is a main problem, especially for our young people.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">We look at the schools and the
tragedies that have happened in the last two years. No one is talking about the
young people we lose on a daily basis. They don't make the newspapers. Those are
the young people that commit suicide; that is violence. The homicides with our
young people; that is violence. The accidental deaths; that is violence.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">We have an opportunity, not only to
help our schools, but to help all of our young people. Can we do more with
mental health? Absolutely. There are a number of us who have been talking about
mental health for a number of years; making our schools smaller; after-school
programs. We can identify, and our teachers can identify, those students that
need extra help, and yet, we're not giving it. We can't blame everybody.
Teachers shouldn't be blamed, parents shouldn't be blamed, the community
shouldn't be blamed. But, we should start turning that around, and we have to
turn that around to the point where we're working together so that we're not so
insensitized to the violence that is around us. Mr. Keene, you'll never be
desensitized to violence anymore. You will always be aware of it, because that
has touched your life, and you do have an opportunity to make a difference.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Hopefully, here in Congress, we will
deal with these issues, and come up with some answers. The bottom line is, we
won't be able to solve everything. We know that. But, we have an obligation to
do the best that we can. Because, one of the hearings that we had not long ago,
before Colorado, it wasn't a matter of whether there was going to be another
school shooting, it was a matter of when. That is something that has hung over a
number of us, and I sit here today hoping that we will do something, and not
have another panel a year from now talking about the same thing. We have the
information. We know what we can do, and we should react to it. This is not a
knee-jerk reaction, and I thank you for your courage.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Don't give up as far as trying to get
kids aware of it. It takes time. Don't get discouraged, and eventually all of
you will make a difference, and maybe the adults will listen to all of you. I
hope so. I thank you,</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mr. Greenwood</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
Can you tell us a little about what you knew about them? I am interested in
knowing if you know anything about what their home life was like? Did you know
them when they were very young, when you might have seen some of, what you
called, the weird behavior, what their school experience was like?</font></p>
<font FACE="Century Schoolbook" SIZE="1">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mr. Campbell</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
I'm not sure what their home life was like, because I wasn't that close to them.
I had just seen them at school.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I knew them since probably the seventh
grade. They didn't really start dressing in the black clothing and trenchcoats
until my junior year in high school. But, they've always been really quiet, and
really didn't associate with many people.</font></p>
<font FACE="Century Schoolbook" SIZE="1">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mr. Greenwood</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
Let me stop you there, if I may. In those earlier years before they changed
their attire and made themselves different, you said they didn't associate. Was
it your sense that they were rejected? Was their behavior such that, for
whatever reasons, people ostracized them, bullied them, or excluded them?</font></p>
<font FACE="Century Schoolbook" SIZE="1">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mr. Campbell</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
They hung out in their own little group. They really liked computers, I noticed
that, the computer game Doom. They were really obsessed with that game. I don't
know if that had anything to do with it, but they were pretty much the nerdy
group.</font></p>
<font FACE="Century Schoolbook" SIZE="1">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mr. Greenwood</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
You said that in later years, when they became more clearly different with their
attire, and so forth, that the jocks teased them. Could you elaborate on that?
Do you know, for instance, were they physically assaulted by other students in
the school?</font></p>
<font FACE="Century Schoolbook" SIZE="1">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mr. Campbell</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
Not physically assaulted, but I do know that the jocks did make fun of them, but
not really to their face. They were just pretty much like, ``look at that weirdo
with the black trenchcoat.''</font></p>
<font FACE="Century Schoolbook" SIZE="1">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mr. Greenwood</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
Let me ask you another question. I was a little concerned about the
second-to-last sentence in your testimony. You said that, ``You cannot change or
control teen behavior.'' I found that disturbing, particularly as a parent of
two upcoming teens.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">It seems to me that part of what every
school in America has to start to do right now, and certainly pledge to do for
the next year, is have a new standard, and that is zero tolerance of harassment
of students based on differences, whether those are racial differences, sexual
differences, any kind of harassment. I think as a society, from the moment -- I
would be happy to hear from any of the students on this subject -- from the
moment you get on the school bus, there is so much in the way of harassment in
the halls and throughout the school experience. I can tell you that if any of
your parents walked into their workplace and they were shoved against lockers,
called names, and had their lunches dumped in their laps, they wouldn't tolerate
that, and yet we expect young kids, vulnerable kids, kids with emotional
problems at home, to accept this as a way of life.</font></p>
<font FACE="Century Schoolbook" SIZE="1">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mr. Campbell</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
True, but harassment has been around ever since you were a little kid, too. I
don't see how you could totally stop harassment.</font></p>
<font FACE="Century Schoolbook" SIZE="1">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mr. Greenwood</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
You can't totally stop harassment, and your point is a good one. Harassment has
been around. But, what we've seen in the last two years has never been around
before in history, and it has never occurred elsewhere in the world, so it is a
different phenomenon. I suspect that what is different is that the kids who were
harassed when I was your age, they were angry and they were depressed, but they
didn't have a culture that gave them permission, whether through watching Doom,
or whether through the lyrics of music, that gave them permission to turn that
rage and that depression against others.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I am running out of time. Let me just
ask Mr. Keene, did you know Michael Carneal?</font></p>
<font FACE="Century Schoolbook" SIZE="1">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mr. Keene</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.

I didn't really know him that well. It was claimed that he was picked on. I

To tell you the truth, I saw him pick on a lot more people than he actually_</font></p>

I didn't know him very much, but I have heard a lot of things. He was a lot of

was picked on. So, it really does matter how much expansion you have for your
tolerance, and how well you can deal with it.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mr. Scott</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'd like to thank you for calling this hearing. Over
the past two Congresses, we've been engaged in a debate on what to do to reduce
and prevent juvenile crime in communities across the country, and as a member of
this Subcommittee and also the Crime Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee,
which have the joint responsibility for juvenile crime policy, I've had more
opportunity than most to participate in the debate.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">What I've concluded from all of these
debates is it really boils down to a choice for members. We can reduce crime, or
we can play politics, but we can't do both. Studies have shown us what works.
Parental training, early childhood education, dropout prevention programs,
after-school and recreational programs, mental health services, drug
rehabilitation, have all been studied and shown to reduce crime, often saving
more money than they cost. But, those are inconsistent with the best politics of
crime, which is to talk and act tough, like prosecuting sixth-graders as adults,
locking up sixth-graders with adult murderers and drug dealers, even executing
14-, 15-, and 16-year-olds.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">We have seen no evidence that more of
these after-the-fact law enforcement strategies would make any significant
difference in reducing youth crime, and yet that has been the basis of our crime
policy. So, I'm delighted to see the students here today helping us work through
this and giving us some concrete solutions to the problem.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I have a couple of questions. One is,
in terms of discipline, I think many of the students indicated that expulsion
was one of the things that could happen. My question is, what is done during the
period of expulsion that would make the student less likely to cause trouble in
the future, if anything? Some schools have programs during expulsion, others
just kick the student out and the student comes back just as bad as they left.
Do any of the students who mentioned expulsion know of any programs during that
period of expulsion? Ms. Wheeler?</font></p>
<font FACE="Century Schoolbook" SIZE="1">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Ms. Wheeler</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
In Baltimore City they just voted on the zero tolerance discipline code. In
cases of expulsion, alternative schools have been built for students who are
at-risk and are a behavior problem in the classroom. Unfortunately, there is not
enough funding for schools to be built, they are called alternative schools, so
a lot of the time students are at home doing nothing after being expelled.</font></p>
<font FACE="Century Schoolbook" SIZE="1">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mr. Scott</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
At home or on the street. The after-school programs have shown to be effective
in giving young people constructive things to do with their time, keeping them
off the streets during the high-crime time between after school and when the
parents come home. My question is, what kinds of after-school programs would
students actually want to participate in?</font></p>
<font FACE="Century Schoolbook" SIZE="1">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Ms. Moriarty</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
I think students are interested in a lot of things, sports, drama, things like
that, that we already have in some of our schools. But, there are other kids who
don't want to stay after school at all. The biggest thing they want to do at the
end of the day is go home and watch TV, or talk to their own friends, and so it
is hard to make programs that those kinds of kids are going to want to stay for.
I think a lot of kids do stay for lots of different clubs, environmental stuff,
political things, but there is the group that just doesn't want to stay at all.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mr. Scott</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
There are some that just wouldn't want to participate in anything, but I guess
the question is, other than what we're doing now, what other kinds of activities
would students want to participate in that we might not have thought about?</font></p>
<font FACE="Century Schoolbook" SIZE="1">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Ms. Wheeler</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
Maybe recreation centers. I know skateboarding and rollerblading isn't lawful in
some places in the city. If we were maybe to build skateboarding ramps or places
where students can go rollerblading, or just social clubs where students can
just sit down and just talk. A lot of students either work or go home and
socialize on the street corner. Maybe if we were to develop a constructive place
where they can do that in a safe environment, that would deter students from
turning to crime.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mr. Ehlers</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Some observations and then some questions: First of
all, I think it is very important for us to distinguish between two major
categories of violence, and they are both very bad, but we have to treat them
differently. One is the one-on-one violence where someone gets very angry and if
there are weapons involved, it can become very tragic. That, I think, has to be
distinguished from the major violence such as you've testified about, where,
obviously, there is a great deal of mental disturbance involved, and those have
to be treated differently.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I would also like to refer back to the
testimonies of Mr. Tancredo and Mrs. McCarthy in terms of Mr. Tancredo's
comments that you have undergone a life changing experience. Things will be
different from now on, and Congresswoman McCarthy, in her very moving statement,
cited what had happened to her as a result of a similar occurrence, and I hope
that, because you have undergone this experience, you have a special
understanding of the situation, and I hope that you will remain active, perhaps
even to the extent of running for office, whether local office, or the Congress.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Following that up, I'm just going to
put you on the spot and ask, if you were sitting on this side of the table, and
imagine yourself there, and recognizing that the Federal Government is a small
part of the total educational picture, roughly 7 percent financially, and that
we would have trouble dealing with everything on a local basis, what do you
think we can do; if you were sitting in our chairs, what would you do as a
member of Congress to try to address the problems that you have experienced and
that you see in the schools today? Is there something that we can do, and how
can we prioritize to have the most impact for our efforts and for our dollars?
I'll throw it open to any of you who want to respond.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mr. Campbell</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
I don't really think there is much you can do without totally making school
systems like a prison, because you have to give teens some freedom, and I just
really don't see any other way to totally stop all the violence without totally
making school systems like prison.</font></p>

I think we should give, at least, more money to the schools so they can do
certain kinds of programs to help around the students, and right now we have
people we hired to go around the halls and make sure there aren't any students
that are not supposed to be roaming around the hall, because if they get kicked
out, they are supposed to go to the office and talk to our principal or
vice-principal or to our counselor, also.</font></p>

</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Ms. Moriarty</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
I would say try to set up some sort of correspondence thing with your schools,
because I think the students want to be involved. I know in my experience, there
are a lot of kids really worried about the violence just as much as any adult
is, and are willing to do something about it. So, I understand that you guys
can't just stand up here and tell what the whole country can do in every little
town in every little place everywhere, but maybe if you set up some sort of
system where you had kids in the different counties report to you or do
something, to keep in contact with you to let you know what is going on, what is
really happening inside the schools. That will give you a much better idea.</font></p>

If I were on the other side, first I would pass laws for handgun control. I
think that is a very important issue. There are a lot of guns on our streets.
Help regulate the sale of guns to young people under the age of 21. Also, 7
percent is not enough money. Being on the school board, they beg the city and
State government for money, and that shouldn't happen. Money should be readily

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">And, I want to go into why there is so
much frustration and so much anger and violence. I believe it starts much
younger than teenagers, and I'd like you to think about that with me, and talk
about how we can show young people that we care about them so that when we don't
to listen to them, I believe they're very hurt in their younger years, and in
order to live with that, they become really angry by the time they're in middle
school, and furious or violent by the time they get to high school.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">So, what is missing in the big picture,
before high school, so that young people can have self-esteem and feel good
enough about themselves that somebody can tease them and they're not going to go
shoot them? Is it before school, after school, nutrition program? I think
somebody over here wants to_</font></p>

often if kids have two parents, then they are probably both working, and quite
often they only have one parent. Because this is the Education Committee, talk
to me about what you think the role for education would be to fill that gap. We
can't say parents go out and do that when we aren't providing them with the
support system to make it even possible most of the time. So where can schools
fill in? Ms. Wheeler, can you tell me that? Where do you think?</font></p>

</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Ms. Wheeler</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
Schools can fill in, as I mentioned in my testimony regarding latch-key kids,
that time between 3:00 when school may let out, and 7:00, when the parents comes
home. That is constructive time that the community can get involved, as far as
funding from the government to have after-school programs. So these students
feel like they belong somewhere instead of out on the street, out on the corner.
A lot of times, as you know, parents are working a lot of the time, or
grandparents, and other than that, emphasize a community environment in the
school, and a safe environment.</font></p>

Well, I think that teachers should be more available after school. I know at my
school, I can go in and talk to my principal if something is bothering me. I can
go in and talk to my guidance counselor if something is bothering me. I talked
to my teachers, my friends. Teachers have to be willing to just sit and listen
to the students' problems, and, sometimes, just by listening, that student will
feel better, and they won't have all of that anger built up inside of them.</font></p>

Little kids, I think are just learning how to express how they feel, and you
have to teach them a constructive way of expressing their feelings and have
different after-school programs for them, because that is an important time in
their lives where they are developing their social skills and everything like
that.</font></p>

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. A number of ideas have been quoted that would all
revolve around what we could do inside of the school building to make it secure.
Of course, metal detectors being one that everyone talks about often. Video
cameras inside. These are the physical plant changes that I'm going to ask you
about here, not just all of the cultural changes that we are all hoping can go
on.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">But, I'm interested to know how each of
you would feel about that, would you be more comfortable, feel more secure?
Because one of the things that I have heard often since Columbine is that many
students are afraid to go back into their building, and it is not just Columbine
that we are talking about, any building, because of the trauma of what happened
there.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">So, we're trying to work through what
we can do, here, certainly, but also on the State and local level, what we can
do to make students feel more comfortable and more secure about going back into
a classroom. How do you feel about the possibility of introducing things like
metal detectors and video cameras and various other mechanisms into the school
that are designed to reduce the possibility of anybody bringing guns or any
other kinds of harmful instruments into the school? Mr. Campbell?</font></p>

I don't really feel like videocameras would helpt, because my school did have
surveillance cameras. I think metal detectors would probably make students feel
a lot better, and probably just more security in the schools, like guards, or
police officers.</font></p>

It seems like metal detectors would help some, but there are ways to get around
that. It is not like you can't bring other things into the school that you could
use in violent ways. In know at Sherwood, with the recent bomb scares, we've
done things like all guests have to check in, every door except the front door
is locked after a certain time, after 3:00 you have to be escorted by a teacher,
things like that, where it is a little bit of an inconvenience, but it does
bring a feeling of security to the students.</font></p>

As Ms. Moriarty said, students do get around them eventually. I see that as a
short-term solution. My fear is that at first there are metal detectors and
surveillance cameras, and will it soon turn to police in the schools? I don't
think that students should feel like they are in a jail. I really think that
that is sad that we have come to the point where I feel like I'm in a jail in
the learning environment. I think that can be intimidating, but that is seen as
a short-term solution, I think, if we were to test to see if it would work.</font></p>

Okay. Last question and we'll go through as quickly as possible. Often, I hear
that these students, not just Klebold and Harris, but all of the students who
have participated in this kind of violence have made their threats known, that
other students in the school have heard them, they've heard about them, that
some rumor has been around. I'm wondering, did you know, did you hear anything,
and have you ever heard anything about a rumor about another student who is
possibly going to do something violent? If you have, did you do anything about
it, and if you didn't, how come? What prevented you from telling on them?</font></p>

Yes, I don't know quite how to ask this question, but I do appreciate the
particular experience that all of you have had, and particularly, Mr. Keene and

treacherous, situation.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">When I heard your response to
Congressman Tancredo that you didn't anticipate any of this, well, of course,
you couldn't have anticipated this terrible murderous situation, who would have,
in either of your situations. That would have been beyond belief. However, you
did, I think, all of you, in one way or another, and particularly, Campbell and
Keene, mention cliques and the anger that was expressed, and the fact that these
particular individuals did show a lot of anti-social behavior. I guess I want to
ask you, don't you believe that, in terms of the school situation, whether it be
teachers or, more specifically, guidance counselors, and maybe psychological
counseling -- somebody mentioned group counseling in your earlier discussion --
wouldn't you have thought that this should be available to all students so they
can work out their problems, whether it is the clique problem or the more
dangerous symptoms that these young men displayed, that were clearly on display,
or do you not have any sense of that within your own school system?</font></p>

Well, then, let us ask the question the other way. Would you think that it
should be the counselor's problem to reach out to the student and the families?
We were talking, quite correctly, about family and parental responsibility here,
and yet, I have heard from parents that there is a sense of confidentiality;
that the guidance counselors and some other school people are not confiding with
families, or bringing the parents in, and frequently the parents are ignorant of
the school situation. I'm just asking you what your experiences have been.</font></p>

cliques and you have always had people that, you know, get angry with each other

I don't think anybody could have said it better than you said it. I think in

we're not sure what to legislate; what is short term and what is long term, and
how you legislate some of this.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I had a meeting with several of my
principals and superintendents and teachers about three years ago. And I asked
inner-city principals and small town, rural farm-oriented principals in Indiana,
&quot;What's the single biggest problem we face in some of our schools
today?&quot; And every single one of them, inner-city and small farm town
communities said the same thing. I was surprised by that. And they said
consistently that the biggest problem in our schools today is the number of
children coming to school with family, psychological, and social problems. And
those problems come into the school: from family, from violent situations, from
hatred. And we're seeing some of those things erupt in our schools.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">And we want to try to help you, we want
to try to help other teachers, we want to help our families, solve these
problems.</font></p>

think Mr. Campbell or Mr. Keene said, &quot;Only God can turn hearts.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Can't we all try to turn some hearts in
our own way? Can't we all try to be involved parents in the schools? Can't we
all try to stand up and say, when we hear one person just tearing at another
student, and being derogatory and mean, can't we stand up and say, &quot;That is
wrong.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">We don't care if you are a nerd, or a

Ms. Williams, what do you think, without trying to put you too much on the spot,
what do you think is the biggest problem or the biggest three problems: parental
involvement, media violence, guns? How would you characterize the problems in
schools today, and what are the top three or four solutions?</font></p>

First of all, I think that parental involvement is pivotal in every child's
life, whether they want to admit it or not. Without your parents, you really --
those are the backbone, they are the backbone of your support.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I also feel that what most teens and
young children are lacking is a faith in God. And whether you are Atheist or you

laying around the house. How would you categorize it?</font></p>

</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Ms. Williams</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
I think that guns in young people's hands -- they shouldn't just have guns.
There is no reason why a young person should have a gun, period. I think that I
don't personally go out looking to buy a gun. And, most people I know, their
parents do have a gun. And I feel that this presents a problem; because if a
child is around and there is no one else there, they can find that gun and that
just presents a horrible situation to put the parents in if the child decides to
play with that gun and it goes off and they are killed. So, I just don't think
that guns should be given or even be in the same homes with children.</font></p>

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">You all have all been talking all
around the subject, and I would like to face it head-on. Do any of you feel like
that, because moral and spiritual training has been removed from your schools,
that had an effect on you? Not having the Ten Commandments in view, for example?

I really don't think that that would have an effect because, if a student does
not believe in God, then, you can't force him to do so. So I think he would want
to rebel against that even more.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mr. Keene</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
I think it would have an effect, just simply because, even if the case may be if
you didn't believe in God, those are what this Nation is built on. I mean, just
because you are not a Christian doesn't give you a right to go out and steal
something from a store; it doesn't make you exempt from that. So, I mean, do you
understand what I am trying to get at? I mean, even if you are not a Christian,
they are still the backbone of what our society is built on and that still
should be respected and displayed in our public high schools.</font></p>

You don't have to be a Christian to have good moral values. You don't have to be
a Muslim to have good moral values. Morality is something everyone should have.
And I feel that by teaching morals doesn't mean that you have to teach Christian
values. It is something that kind of just goes hand in hand. You don't have to
have your Ten Commandments on the wall. But, commandments we use every day:
``Thou shall not kill; thou shall not murder; thou shall not steal.'' It is just
something that all of us are faced with every day. And morals are what makes us
who we are.</font></p>

I think it starts younger than high school. Like, the first five years of a
child's life are the most important years, and that is when parents and teachers
should get involved. There is no way to tell if this person will be a killer, or
this person will be really good throughout their life. It is just being there
for that person and doing all that you can.</font></p>

certain topics like the shootings. Show them what can happen if you were shot,
or if you were the person. I mean, if you go to jail, for how long, or

I think drugs are a problem in schools today, I guess, because, I mean, you can
pretty much get them if you want them. But I don't really see a correlation
between the drugs being involved with these sort of violent acts. I mean, while
those students may or may not participate in drug-related activities, I think
they could with or without drugs. I don't think that is what led to it.</font></p>

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to thank you for having this hearing which
has been so important to all of us, and I would like to thank all of the
witnesses for coming here today and for speaking to us on the critical issue of
school violence. And while I am sure that it is extremely difficult for all of
you to recount the painful memories of your experience with the violence in your
own schools, I hope you realize that your impressions are invaluable for those
of us here today who have been fortunate not to have a similar experience befall
ourselves or any of our loved ones.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">You come here before Congress as we try
to make sense out of these tragedies. So that we can try to determine what
steps, if any, we may take to prevent such events from happening again. We
realize that the cause of needless acts of violence is complex and something
that we cannot fully comprehend. We also know that the most important steps to
curb and prevent such acts must be taken by the local communities across the
country.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">What we hope to do here in Congress is
to provide the necessary resources to assist the local jurisdictions in taking
necessary steps to prevent tragedies on the scale that you experienced from
happening in their schools. The firsthand accounts and recommendations that you
are providing today will be invaluable information for school officials,
legislators, and government officials throughout the country.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I want to express my gratitude to all
of you for taking the time and summoning the courage to come before us today and
recount your experiences. The people I in Puerto Rico represent have taken a
deep interest in the issue of school violence, and I know that I speak for all
of them in wishing you and your fellow students and the members of your
community our heartfelt wishes in overcoming the tragedy that has befallen you.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Now, I would like to begin by asking
something about discipline and loving care. My experience as a parent, which I
believe is the experience that most parents have had, and I think that many
psychologists, psychiatrists, and educators support is the almost magic formula
to keep children and adolescents free of violence is a good balance of loving
care and discipline. If you are able to provide the proper balance of loving
care and discipline, you will very, very seldom have problems, unless there is
something basically and fundamentally wrong, such as an illness that the child
or the adolescent has.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Now, I would like to ask, start asking
with Adam Campbell and going over to Anita Wheeler in a line, in each one of
your schools, did you notice where you felt that you had from the principal and
the others in the school the proper balance of loving care and discipline? Or do
you think we are missing one or the other? And if so, which one do you think you
were missing?</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mr. Campbell</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
I thought in my school that it is pretty balanced because I know my principal,
and he cares a lot about the students. And he disciplined them also when the
time was appropriate. So, I think there is a good balance of both.</font></p>

I think that we have kind of taken the stance lately that we don't want to make
the child feel bad any more. In Montgomery County, we call it &quot;success for
every student.&quot; And while it is good in a way, it is also harmful because
we do not want to, &quot;Oh, let us not put the child in detention because that
might make him unhappy.&quot; We want to keep him happy. We want to make sure
everyone is having a good time. And I think less attention needs to be focused
on having a good time and more attention needs to be focused on giving the
teachers control of the classrooms, because in a lot of classrooms, I mean, kids
will talk back and disobey and they are not afraid of getting expelled. They are
not afraid of getting suspended anymore. So there has to be some other way to
keep them in line.</font></p>

you said you didn't particularly have a religion, and you also suggested that
the way you would teach some of the values would be basically self-interest.

And I want to follow up, if I can, on one other thing that Mr. Johnson did.
Seventy-one percent of those who committed homicides in New York State, when
they checked it, had marijuana in their system at the time, and had taken
marijuana within the last 24 hours of the murder.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">In Indiana a number of schools had put
in drug testing and alcohol. Forty percent of the kids who had been suspended,
when they tested them had drugs or alcohol in their system at that time. We have
seen a dramatic rise in drugs, particularly in marijuana, in junior high and
high school. When I have been to schools all over my district for the last four
years, it is real interesting, the kids who don't have the drug problems don't
favor drug testing. But, the kids who have had the drug problems often will say,
&quot;That is the only thing that got me straight.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Now, there has been kind of a
pooh-poohing of this problem, and yet much of the interrelationship of drugs and
guns seem to be interrelated. Do you have any further insights into that? It was

</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mr. Ford</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
Ten years ago I was a senior in high school. When I talk about young,
notwithstanding the camaraderie here on the panel, I remember being angry at
times in school. But, I also remember not having access to perhaps firearms and
access to other things that would allow me to really act out and perhaps
manifest my anger at, or direct my anger at, some of my friends, or even
teachers for that matter.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I have really a two-part issue; and I
have heard the talk about Christianity. I am a Christian. But God also teaches
us to act when we have the tools with which to act. And we are receiving
evidence; we are receiving fact after fact, data after data, suggesting that
perhaps we ought to act.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I appreciate Ms. Moriarty and others
who have commented. And certainly the school board member_I look forward to
supporting you one day, and hope that you select me as your running mate, when
you decide to run for President, Ms. Wheeler.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">You have indicated that legislating is
difficult; it is hard. But nothing we do here is easy, I say to my colleagues,
if it was easy, they wouldn't have us here. You wouldn't have wanted the job.
None of us would have wanted this job. It is a difficult job. There are
difficult choices and decisions that have to be made.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I am a Christian. God has given me a
chance to do what I am doing. I go to church every Sunday, but also realize that
I have to do things with my Christianity. I can't just say my morality teaching,
my faith-based teaching should help me to do this and force me to do this. God
wants me to act in certain ways.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Ms. Wheeler, you have talked about it
so eloquently, how we cannot realize it, how we overlooked the fact that, no
matter how angry these kids were in Columbine and Jonesboro, which is 70 miles
from where I live, they couldn't have shot their classmates if they didn't have
access to guns, regardless of how you look at it. I grew up in a gun culture. We
shoot beer cans off of stuff. We go hunting. But the reality is, you can't shoot
people unless you have a gun.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">We should not be afraid to act here in
this Congress. Ms. McCarthy, who is our most powerful and eloquent spokesperson
on this issue, even greater than the President and others in the Senate and the
House, tells us over and over again how we address this issue, but we refuse to
deal with the reality here, no matter how angry you get.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I understand what Mr. Campbell is
saying, and please, those on this panel, don't think he is throwing his hands up
in the air when he is saying that, you know, &quot;There is nothing we can
do.&quot; Or when Mr. Keene says, &quot;Look, kids get angry.&quot; You
responded to one of my colleagues, &quot;Kids are always harassing one
another.&quot; That happened when I was in school. That happened even when these
old folks were in school up here on this panel.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">[Laughter.]</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">But the reality is, they didn't have
access to guns.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I agree that the Internet played a role
in this, and movies. I am a Democrat, but I am an American first. The
entertainment industry needs to be brought before the committees, and before the
White House, and before folks, to answer to why they produce these
violence-saturated products. We have to look at how we police the Internet. But
we shouldn't be afraid to act here in this Congress.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I have heard from all of you guys --
the courage, the bravery all of you have shown -- staggering. I hope that,
through osmosis, we get it here on the panel, and we can send it to our friends
in Hollywood, on this side of the aisle: and those guys can send it to the folks
in the NRA; and do what is right for you, and do what is right for our future.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">And you all have made a lot of
comments. And I am curious to know, we saw what happened in Port Huron,
Michigan, where the young people actually revealed to authorities what some of
their classmates were talking about doing: blowing up the school and going on a
shooting rampage somewhere.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">My heart and blessings and condolences
go out to you, Mr. Campbell, and to all in the Columbine and Littleton
community.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">But to the extent that I can talk about
it without conjuring up those images, how many of you are unafraid? If you were
to hear, Mr. Keene, something in the high school or something in the junior high
school, other classmates talking about this, would you be willing to disclose
and sort of divulge this information to authorities? Because we are debating as
to whether or not we ought to fund police hotlines and weapons hotlines, and
some folks say it won't work, some folks say it does work. I would be interested
to hear from those on the frontline. Would you be willing, if confronted with
what you believe, Mr. Atteberry, what you believe, Ms. Williams, to be pretty
convincing evidence that someone was planning to do something outrageous, like
we have seen in other places around the Nation, would you be willing to tell the
authorities? And do you think your classmates_ clearly you have demonstrated
bravery and courage by being here -- would you believe your classmates would be
willing to do the same thing?</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I appreciate this hearing, too, and
sadly, even though this issue certainly has gripped the Nation every which way,
I mean, whether it was Paducah or certainly Littleton, we are only seeing an
increase. Rather, as we sort of look at a self-reflection, in virtually every
community this is the talk. Every community is trying to make sure that history
doesn't repeat itself in their community. We saw it happen this last week in
Port Huron, my home State, in Michigan. We have seen it in a number of schools
in Montgomery County. And I saw a lot of parents that spent the night at that
one Montgomery school the night of May 9th, on TV. And we have seen it in lots
of high schools in my district. And even as this hearing started today, a pipe
bomb was found in a high school parking lot 20 minutes from my home, and the
school was evacuated, and it was blown up.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">So, it continues. It doesn't go away.
And as I think about it, as I talk to superintendents and parents and
communities, and I met with about 30 superintendents yesterday in Kalamazoo,
Michigan, this is obviously one of the top issues that they are talking about.
We have a no-tolerance law in Michigan -- I suspect most States do -- automatic
suspension forever.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I have a number of schools with metal
detectors, but lots of my schools have 30 or 40 doors. It is almost
incomprehensible that you could have a metal detector, or certainly a security
person, for every door with the fire code safeties and everything else, and
every community has to sort of decide that itself.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">But, as I listen to the testimonies, I
think about myself first as a dad, second as a Member of Congress. I think about
my own involvement with my kids, trying to see sporting events and concerts,
helping with homework, attending student conferences, all of those things. It is
frustrating to see other parents not taking that same responsibility.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I just quickly might ask, now that we
are running out of time in the afternoon, what you students think we could do.
What would you like to see happen in your local community, knowing that we are
not going to be able to legislate it from here, not on a national level? But
what steps should communities take to try to get more parents involved?</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">As I think about the situation in
Littleton, I think it was the Harris family, where a neighbor actually heard, or
allegedly heard, the bomb making, made in the garage next door, went over -- I
don't know what happened to the parents; I don't know if they were home that
weekend, I don't know. But what is it that we can get to try and have parents be
a little bit more responsible and caring and understand a little bit about their
own family situation? It might help with the schools. Would any of you have any
ideas as it relates to your own school community, and maybe even to your own
family, as you have witnessed real tragedies that have come about?</font></p>
<font FACE="Century Schoolbook" SIZE="1">
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mr. Campbell, do you know anything
about this? Is that the right family?</font></p>

Do you have any ideas, any thoughts? I mean, is there any linkage, you know, as
you think about peer pressure, and a variety of different things that often
work? What is it that we can try to help bring the parents into the situation
where they might not be there today?</font></p>

I think there is a lot of importance put on the privacy that children need, and
I think it is important that parents give their children enough privacy so that
they can feel like they can have their own things that their parents aren't
involved with. But you can't give your children so much space that you don't
know what is going on in their life.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">And, even not only your own kids, I
mean if you see someone else's kids in the neighborhood doing something that you
find suspicious, you know, you need to say something because it is like a
community that needs to help raise the kid. It can't be just be the one or two
parents, because while they see some parts of it, they don't see the whole
child. You know, they don't see them at school. The teachers need to get in
there and if they see something wrong, speak up. And maybe it will come to
nothing; hopefully, it will come to nothing. But you need to speak up when you
do see something, or you notice something.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Chairman Castle</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
Thank you, Mr. Upton, very much. We will go to Mr. Payne; then we will go to Mr.
McIntosh; then we will go to the next panel.</font></p>
<font FACE="Century Schoolbook" SIZE="1">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mr. Payne</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
Thank you very much. Let me also commend you all for coming. As a former high
school teacher and coach, I spent a lot of time with young people. And I would
like to mention that the difference from when I was in high school, like the
young man said, when these old people, was the fact that there weren't guns
around. If you got angry, the worst thing that could happen was maybe have a
fist fight, if that much.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">But with the availability of guns -- as
you know, there are 235 million guns in this country. There is a gun for about
every man, woman, child, and infant in this country. And when the Second
Amendment was written, it was Paul Revere riding around on a horse saying,
&quot;Come together to keep the British from taking your properties.&quot; And
during that era, there weren’t AK-47s, and Tech-9s, and clips with guns. When
we talk about the Second Amendment, the NRA says that is what it ought to be,
and they hide behind the Second Amendment. The Second Amendment is totally out
of sync with what is going on today. And for people to talk so strongly about
the protection of the Second Amendment, when guns are in the hands of the wrong
people it is absolutely wrong, and it is totally out of place.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Let me just add one question. I would
also like to mention that other people go to heaven too; you don't have to be a
Christian. I am a Baptist, and you can't be any more conservative, and I go to
church, too, and read the Bible. And we couldn't go to movies on Sunday, and we
couldn't cook -- you know how the old Southern Baptist are. But Moslems can go
to heaven, too, you know. This is not for you so much, but for some of the other
members up here who think you have to be a Christian to go to heaven. Hindus
have their Ten Commandments; they pray more than Baptists, as a matter of fact.
When I went to school and they said -- and I get in trouble with my Baptist
ministers; black Baptist ministers are the most conservative in the world; they
want prayer in school. But when I was in school, and we got to a certain part,
the Catholic kids didn't say anything; some other kids, the Jewish kids, just
sort of were in the corner with their heads down. I didn't even recognize it
then; I didn't realize it then, but in a country today as multi-cultural as we
are today, how can we say that it has to be a Christian prayer in school, and
that is going to do everything right? We have got to come into the new
millennium, Members of Congress. Not for you, I have just used about five
minutes. But we have to become more understanding of prayer in the school. Like
I said, I just think that these things are out of date, even though I support
prayer very much.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Thirdly, when this was going on in the
urban centers -- I taught at Newark, New Jersey, where there is a high crime
rate with a lot of shootings. When this started happening with drive-by
shootings, and so forth, they brought in the criminologists and the penologists.
And they said, &quot;Three strikes, you are out.&quot; They said you know,
&quot;Try 12-and 13-year-olds as adults.&quot; They said, &quot;Keep them in
jail forever, no parole time, 85 percent.&quot; You hear it all the time; tough
on crime.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I am sad to see what happened, but I am
glad that now that this happened in little, rural, white, upper-class towns, we
are talking about psychologists and psychiatrists, and talking about trying to
engage the young people to see what the problems are.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">All we heard was: &quot;Be tough on
crime. The tougher you are, the better it is. Lock them up and throw away the
key.&quot; And it was wrong for those kids and it is wrong for kids of your
generation and communities. What we need to do is to find out what the problems
are, and what the solutions could be, and we need to continually talk to people
like yourselves.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Finally, my brother wanted to introduce
a bill into the State legislature -- he is in the State legislature of New
Jersey -- that says that mentoring should be a part of the curriculum. Mentoring
works. And he got more opposition from the State Board of Education, &quot;Well,
mentoring kids in suburb communities, they don't need mentoring. That is an
inner-city thing; they are the ones that need a mentor,&quot; and so forth.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Let me just ask the question, what do
you feel about mentoring and do you think that it is only inner-city kids
without a dad that need to have a mentor; or do you think mentoring would have
helped with some of the kids in your neighborhood, in your community? Anybody?
All of you can try it, in about 20 seconds.</font></p>

</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Ms. Moriarty</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
I have been involved in some mentoring things; reading with elementary school
students. And I do think it plays a big part in their life, because they look up
to the older kids. I know when I was a young child, and I went with my older
sister to go watch things at the high school, I thought &quot;Ah, they are so
cool; I want to be like that.&quot; And it does play a big part in their life,
especially if it is a weekly thing where they get to know you really well and
they can trust you, and you are not their parents telling them, ``No, you can't
do this.'' You are an outside source saying, ``This is what you should do; this
is what is right.'' And even though your parents are telling you to do this too,
it is not like I am trying to, like, be your dad, as well, you know.</font></p>

Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I will try to be quick. Mr. Souder did cover one of
the points that I wanted to make about the pipe bomb, and let me reinforce it;
that gun control laws didn't work in Columbine, sadly. And we need to find other
solutions, including solutions that teach our young people moral lessons of how
to treat each other. And if people get hung up on them being Christian, or
Buddhist, or Kwanza_think of them as ten ancient principles of how to treat
other people. I think those should be taught to our children. And we should
teach people not to murder, not to steal, and to treat each other with dignity,
some way in our school program.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">But my question, the remaining question
that I had and wanted to ask of the panelists today -- and I want to thank each
of you for coming; you were very articulate, and I know it has been a difficult
subject for many of you, especially if you have experienced it in your own
school -- is it really normal to expect that somebody, a student, would have all
types of weapons in their room, or be building bombs in the garage, and their
parents wouldn't know about it? Is that the state of parenting today?</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I am a new parent. My daughter is 18
months. So I don't really know what to expect when she becomes a teenager, but
maybe we can go down the line. Is that something you find is the normal case,
that your parents wouldn't know if you had guns in your room? Mr. Campbell?</font></p>

I don't really know too much about making pipe bombs, or what materials are
required to do it; but, if a student wanted to have a gun, they could easily
have one and just hide it in their room someplace because parents usually don't
go into their children's rooms. And they usually don't snoop around or look
through things like that.</font></p>

In some cases, the parents have guns too. So how can they say, do what I say and
not what I do. I mean, if they have a gun that they use, whether they use it for
protection or not, how are they going to question if their child wants a gun as
well?</font></p>

Realistically, a parent isn’t with their child 24 hours a day. And, as you
know, handguns are very small and can easily be camouflaged anywhere in your
house. Therefore, realistically, it shouldn't be normal, and I don't like the
word normal because I don't think it should be normal, but it is not accepted
either. But it is just a way of life and the way things are right now.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mr. Hilleary</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to introduce Steven Curtis Chapman, the
second panelist there. He is a fellow Tennessean I am awful proud to have him
here today. He is quite an accomplished artist, has a platinum album, is a
three-time Grammy Award winner, and was the 1998 gospel male vocalist of the
year.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">But those are not the reasons he is
here today especially. He was also a graduate of Heath High School in Paducah,
Kentucky, where, as we know, violent shootings erupted in 1997. So he has an
idea of the horror that went on in Colorado. And due to that, I think, he was
able to perform his song, <i>With Hope</i>, and that has been cited as a great
contribution to a part of the healing process that they have under way out there
in Colorado.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">So, I am very proud to have Steven here
with us today. Thank you, Mr. Chapman, for being here.</font></p>

And thank you, Mr. Hilleary. We appreciate that.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Our next witness is Mr. Bill Smith. Mr.
Smith teaches at Thurston High School in Springfield, Oregon. Two of his sons
also attended Thurston High School. Today he will speak as both a teacher and a
parent who was affected by the shooting in the cafeteria. We appreciate your
being here, too.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">And next is Dr. Jonathan Lane. Dr. Lane
taught at Frontier Junior High School in Moses Lake, Washington, at the time of
the 1996 school shooting. Currently, Dr. Lane is the principal of another area
middle school but next year plans to return to Frontier as its principal.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mr. Tancredo</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Yes, shortly after the tragedy at Columbine High
School, I was wandering through the memorial park that had been established and
was looking at the various artifacts that had been left there and met Mr. Welsh
who came up and introduced himself. I was profoundly moved by his analysis of
what had happened.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">When I found out that he is the father
of two sons who attend Columbine and that his son was caught in the library on
the day of the shootings -- he thankfully survived -- I mentioned at the time
that if he felt the desire to do so, we would be very happy to have him come
today and to provide testimony.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">And, as I say, I found his analysis of
it to be both compelling and profound. So I am glad to have him here today.</font></p>

running a little bit late. This is a subject of a great deal of interest.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mr. Kingery</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
Thank you. Yes, I would like to get you home for dinner too.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">During the early 1990's, major
organizations, like the General Accounting Office and the National Academy of
Sciences noted that most prior efforts to develop school violence prevention
strategies had been hastily prepared, implemented for only short periods, and
not rigorously evaluated.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">These organizations urged that
investments be made in rigorous research, development, and evaluation of
programs to reduce violence in and around schools. Their recommendation inspired
the creation of the Hamilton Fish National Institute on School and Community
Violence that I now direct.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">And Senator Thurmond and Ham Fish and
those from both sides of the aisle were very helpful in setting up the institute
in 1997. Hamilton Fish put his last year of his life into this effort, going
around saying things like, &quot;I feel like I had raised a daughter and she got
a bachelor's and a master's and a doctorate and then didn't go out and do
anything with it, when it came to violence prevention.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">We put all this effort into it, and
there is a lot of money going into it. And where are the solutions? What is
being done about it?</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">So the difference the Hamilton Fish
Institute is trying to make is to base programs on what works and why, to cut
through the rhetoric and move to the science of what is effective and what makes
a difference. We don't have to guess and we don't have to use intuition. There
is a science base for this area, and it is very little intoned in the
discussions.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">We have seen some modest declines in
youth violence in recent years. We have noted that schools are safer than the
surrounding communities with regard to violence. That may not be true with
regard to threats though, harassment, bigotry, and intimidation.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">And despite the good news, it seems
that many places are not safe. Violence in high schools remains high. Also,
middle schools; increasingly, elementary schools, are higher than most people
realized, and certainly higher than even the research indicates because of
certain biases in doing this kind of research in asking questions about violent
behavior.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The high prevalence of fighting at
school assures that large numbers of youth will be injured at school due to
violence. Youth risk behavior surveys places the prevalence of fighting at
school in the past 12 months at 20 percent of boys in high school. Twenty
percent of boys have been in a fight in the last year, and 8.6 percent of girls.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Fighting is not an innocuous behavior,
nor are emotionally debilitating threats, taunts, sexual harassment, and
intimidation of all types that largely go undetected and unaddressed while we
look for shootings and other high-profile incidents.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Both are important. We are not
adequately even measuring the problem at present. How can we speak with wisdom
about something that we don't adequately even measure.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The presence of guns, especially
handguns in school, introduce the prospect of sudden lethal violence into the
consciousness of all of us. And student fears are on the increase though
violence may seem to be decreasing. We are all deeply concerned.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">While the fear of gun violence at
school is probably disproportionate to the actual probability of those events
occurring, it is clear that real reductions in the number of handguns in schools
must be achieved if the sense of security is to be restored in the school
environment.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Firearm violence in schools threatens
the very core of our sense of safety, the sense of parents, of children, and
others. It is something so inviolate that you would think a child wouldn't have
to fear for their life when they sit down to do their math homework.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Firearms in the hands of unsupervised
children who lack adult reasoning capabilities are dangerous. Their use by
children requires constant, careful adult supervision. And no child should have
easy access, unsupervised access to firearms. Parents take great risk in buying
them for unsupervised use by their children.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">In a 1996 survey, 50 percent of
10th-and 11th-grade children said that it would be no trouble to get a gun if
they wanted to. Half of kids said it would be no trouble; and that is the truth.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Only 16 States require gun owners to
store their guns in a manner that prevents children from gaining access -- 16
states. And some cities, in addition.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Firearms in the hands of children at
school are even more dangerous. Twelve and a half percent of high school boys
surveyed in 1997 said they carried a weapon to school in the past 30 days --
twelve and a half percent. There are a lot of guns in school. More than you may
realize; more than the public realizes.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">And not only guns, but other kinds of
weapons. I have superintendents and principals pull out their drawers and show
me a whole array of things that you would never dream that would go into a
school.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Since the Gun Free Schools Act was
implemented, the myth has been that schools are cracking down on weapons. And as
we heard from a Representative earlier, it is a myth_that it is not real. Zero
tolerance programs are a smoke screen. They are a political ploy.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">That is strong language, but there is
very little in the way of teeth in that legislation.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Our best estimates indicate that only
about 1 percent of kids who carry a gun to school are expelled for carrying that
weapon. And a third of them are back out on the streets or in some other program
or sent to another school with no history following them about the fact that
they carried a weapon to school.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">There are strategies we studied that
are effective. There is a comprehensive framework and approach into which those
strategies can be enmeshed. There is a technology for this. Let's talk about
that technology.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mr. Chapman</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
Well, for the sake of redundancy, good afternoon. And my name is Steven Curtis
Chapman. I am a singer and songwriter living in Franklin, Tennessee. However,
today I come before you not as a professional musician but as a dad, I have
three children of my own, who has missed his flight now and is going to miss the
little league game tonight. But this is pretty important stuff, so I think my
guys will understand.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">My heart is heavy with the burden of
what is taking place in our culture, and, more specifically, in our schools as
it relates to violence. It is an honor and a privilege to have this opportunity
to speak to you about this issue.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">School violence has always concerned
me, but it took on a whole new meaning on the Monday morning following
Thanksgiving in 1997. My family and I had just returned from my hometown from
Paducah, Kentucky, the evening before. I received a call from my dad explaining
that earlier that morning a student at my alma mater, Heath High School, had
opened fire on a group of classmates involved in an early morning prayer group
at the school.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">My wife and I returned to Paducah that
evening to participate in prayer services that were being held throughout the
community. When we arrived, everyone was in a state of shock, and it seemed like
an unbelievable dream. By the end of the week, the full extent of the nightmare
weighed heavily on a small town that I knew as one of the friendliest places on
earth.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I was asked by the parents of the three
girls who died in that tragedy to sing at the joint funeral services held for
Jessica, Nicole, and Kayce. As one who still feels very connected to that
community, I went to the funeral as a friend to grieve with those who were
grieving.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">But when my wife and I walked in and
caught sight of the three caskets covered with flowers and signatures from their
classmates, it was the parent in me that became overwhelmed with the impact of
this tragedy. If we had stayed in Paducah to raise our family, this could have
been my daughter Emily.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Several months later, I returned to
Heath High School to give a memorial concert to honor the three girls who died
in the shootings there. It was during the process of putting together this
memorial concert that an idea was born in the hearts of myself and a filmmaker
friend of mine, Ken Carpenter of Franklin Films, to do something more to help in
these terrible tragedies.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Working together with my friend Chuck
Colson of Prison Fellowship Ministries and neighbors Who Care, the Crime Victim
Ministry of Prison Fellowship, we created what we believed to be a powerful
youth violence package called Bulletproof.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Neighbors Who Care president Lisa
Lampman, who is here today behind me, provided keen insight on the development
of Bulletproof, which consists of a film drama as well as a documentary. These
films, which address the issue of school violence in very unique ways, also have
accompanying discussion guides to be used in group settings.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">And we had planned to show about a
two-minute intro of the Bulletproof package. Is that still something we are able
to do, have time to do?</font></p>

devastating trend? And I don't believe it will be found necessarily in
installing more metal detectors or enacting legislative solutions -- as
important as some of these things may be -- but focusing on transforming young
hearts and minds, transforming our culture, living as role models ourselves.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The apostle Paul put it this way in the
Book of Romans in the Bible when he talked about the importance of honor and
respect for one another. He concluded by saying, &quot;Do not be overcome by

Thank you. I would like to thank Chairman Castle and members of the Subcommittee
for giving me this opportunity to talk about such an issue. My name is Bill
Smith. I have been a teacher at Thurston High School in Springfield for the last
22 years. I have three boys. They have all gone to school there. The third one
will be graduating this year.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I had two boys that were at the school
when this happened. Our school is a fairly large school: 1,500 students in four
grades. It is a great high school. We have always had a great deal of pride in
it; and that is one of the toughest things about this, now, whenever the name
Thurston comes up, it is associated with this awful event.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">So it has been real tough for me to
deal with.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">On May 21st of last year, a young
freshman student entered the cafeteria, he opened fire on a real crowded
cafeteria. It was right before first period started. The student body elections
were going to take place that day.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">So all were in there campaigning. It
was a very festive event. People thought that somebody had gotten a little out
of hand, and they thought that firecrackers were exploding.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">There was a mass exodus from the
cafeteria. I was on my way to class. Kids were frantic, panic-stricken.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">When I heard what the situation was, I
immediately thought of my sons, and I ran to the cafeteria and was hoping it was
a bad joke. When I got there, it was a scene that is real difficult to describe.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The first boy that I came to was my
son's best friend. He had been shot three times in the back, and once in the
leg. The second boy was Mikael Nickolauson who was lying dead in a pool of
blood.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The third boy was the perpetrator. I
didn't know that at the time. He was being restrained. So I asked him, you know,
are you all right? The person on top of him, which was another teacher, said, he
is the shooter.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">At that point, I then went through the
cafeteria to see if my son had been hit. As it turns out, the young man that he
was standing next to shielded him. That boy was hit seven times.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I then searched through the rest of the
cafeteria, returned back to my son's best friend, and tried to do what I could
for him. He had all internal injuries. So it was a very difficult situation. He
miraculously recovered.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">There were several kids that tackled
this boy and really kept the situation from being much, much worse. If there had
been two gunmen, or if he had been able to get another clip in, I am sure my son
wouldn't have survived.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I have been struggling the past year to
try to make sense of this. And so I am here today to try and share with you some
solutions that I think maybe we should look at.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">First of all, I might say, I don't
think there is any magic solution to it. I think it is going to be a combination
of things. We need youth preventative, crime prevention programs. We need
increased school security. And we need to stop this access that youths have to
guns.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I can share with you several specific
programs that we have instituted at our school. We have hired an extra
counselor. I don't think you can have too many counselors. We also have a member
of the Springfield Police Department stationed at our school as a school
resource officer. He is armed, but his primary focus is not on patrolling the
school, but on regular communication with students.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The presence of the resource officer at
all schools across the country, in my opinion, would be very important.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I applaud any effort Congress can make
to help deal with this issue. I believe, generally speaking, we need better
communication avenues within the schools and between schools and the community.
We need better prevention programs that enable school faculty to identify
potentially troubled youth. We need to enact Federal laws to bar the transfer of
and possession to juveniles of semi-automatic assault weapons and high-capacity
ammunition clips.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I ask you, what purpose would a
50-round clip have? Why are we manufacturing those?</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">We need to impose mandatory background
checks and waiting periods on individuals purchasing any firearms. We need to
enact laws holding any juvenile caught with a weapon at school for a minimum
72-hour period before releasing them.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">As we mark the anniversary this week,
the one-year anniversary of the shootings at Thurston High School, I hope that
Congress and the Nation can learn from our experience and take steps to prevent
further tragedies.</font></p>

</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mr. Lane</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
Mr. Chairman, distinguished Members of the Committee, my name is John Lane. I am
here today representing myself and the National Association of Secondary School
Principals. I am currently the principal at Warden Middle School in Warden,
Washington.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The reason I am here today to talk to
you is because of an event that occurred a little over three years ago in
Frontier Junior High School in Moses Lake, Washington, where three people were
killed.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I have always said that I would take
any opportunity to try and make something positive come out this tragedy. I have
been reminded again by the shootings in Colorado, how such a senseless act can
impact a community and even a whole country.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The reasons behind these shootings are
certainly varied and complex. Solutions are not easy to find. But we need to
have communities working together to try to help solve it.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I want to tell you a little bit about
my story so you will know where I am coming from.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">February 2, 1996, I was teaching down
the hall when I heard something unusual. I Didn't know what it was, but I knew
it wasn't right. Walked down the hall; as I walked down the hall I heard kids
screaming. As I got to the door, I pushed the door open and smelled gun smoke, I
knew immediately what had happened.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I dove to the floor and hid behind the
teacher's desk. As I lay on the floor behind the desk, I saw Mrs. Caires, the
teacher, lying beside me. She had been killed instantly. She still held the
eraser and the chalk in her hand. I saw students in various states of shock
around the room with death on their face, and I wondered if I was going to be
next.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Barry, the student who had fired the
shots, was standing in the corner dressed head to toe in black: black trench
coat, black cowboy boots, black jeans, and a black cowboy hat. He wore a gun
belt and had two guns, handguns with 83 rounds of ammunition, and a white lucky
rabbit's foot hanging from his belt.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Barry called my name and told me to
stand up; and I told him I couldn't because I was too afraid, and I was. We
talked a little bit, and pretty soon he said, if I didn't stand up, he was going
to start shooting more kids.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I knew what I had to do. I stood up.
And through negotiations, I was able to take three kids out of the room, one
student who was a diabetic and kind of shocked, a student who was critically
wounded, and a student who was fatally wounded.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Later Barry told me he was going to
take me hostage. He was going to put the gun in my mouth and take me out of the
room. I told him I couldn't, I was too afraid. And I was.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I was at that time, 4 or 5 feet from
Barry, and I knew it was the time that I could take him. I charged him, pinned
him against the wall, grabbed his hand on the stock of the rifle. At that time
the police came in and the kids went out. It was quite a sight I guess.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I thought a lot about the incident, and
I have come to some conclusions about how I acted and why I was able to help end
the situation without further harm.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I have always been a wrestler. I
believe that that training had helped me to act under a really stressful
situations. The many hours I spent on the wrestling mat and in competition, I
think, were a good preparation, and I believe that really healthy competition in
sports is a positive preparation for life.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Teachers are not taught what to do
during a hostage situation in Ed 101. And I don't think in my wildest dreams I
thought that sometime during my teaching career I would face a gun in a
classroom.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I believe that ordinary people make
good choices in their lives and are able to do extraordinary things when placed
in a terrible situation. Individuals learn how to make choices through their
peers and through the examples of others.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Some of the things I think we need to
recognize when someone is in trouble and we need to help him to find help. This
is especially true for students. Help may be a family member, counselor, a
minister, teacher, policeman, or a professional health-care worker. I believe
additional counselors are a very important piece in helping to prevent similar
things from happening in the future.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Moses Lake has done quite a few things
in dealing with kids and drawing together this community that has been very
positive. And I hope that will be entered in the record.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Some of the things, as representing the
National Association of Secondary School Principals today, they would like to
have stressed is the zero tolerancy concerning weapons in schools, and gun laws
need to be enforced and strengthened. Communities and schools must advocate and
model to students a core set of values. Schools must personalize the education
of each child.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Policies and procedures for addressing
violent incidences on campus need to be put in place in each school. Counseling
and mentoring services need to be available to all children.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The media and entertainment industry
need to accept their responsibility in curbing the portrayal of violent acts as
a form of entertainment.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Peer mediation and training should be
included in teacher preparation courses, and parents should be trained in
violence-prevention strategies.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">In conclusion, there is not just one
answer but many multiple strategies that are needed to address the issues of
school safety. Prevention is the key, whether it be in the form of limiting
access to weapons, securing facilities, instilling core values, training school
personnel and parents, limiting violent images, or identifying early students at
risk.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">And the value of our children need to
be made a priority to our principals, teachers, students, communities, and
government in order for us to prevent future catastrophes.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Ms. Francis</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
I was in Colorado during the Littleton shooting. That was the most horrible week
I have ever spent in my life. I have been at schools ever since I was 6 years
old. I am still in schools, and I work professionally as a school psychologist.
And I have done that most of my adult life. I have raised two children, who are
now adults and are still in school and who now have children and their own
families. I am raising one, my last son, who is also in middle school this year.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">After the shootings, all over the
Nation, we had all this media attention. May 10 seemed to be a magic date. There
were bomb threats almost every day in the school. Kids and administrators were
just scared, very scared.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">My son pleaded with my husband and
myself not to send him to school. But we thought that that would not be the best
message to give him, that he should run away, that he should escape. Instead, we
talked with him as we would anybody's son, anybody's daughter. We talked with
him. We tried to allay fears.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Then I, of course, went to work myself
in the school. And one of the teachers, a special education teacher, came up to
me and she said, &quot;Did you send your son to school today?&quot; I said,
&quot;Yes, I did.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">She said, &quot;I sent Michael,&quot;
her son. I was so afraid. &quot;Weren't you just a little bit afraid? Don't you
think that something might happen?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">And as she was saying this to me, I
could hear other students who had come to school who were doing things that
students shouldn't be doing because I was in an elementary building, not a high
school, not a middle school -- pre-K through sixth grade.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">When you look at the panel who was here
before and you see these nice, polished adolescents, wonderful children -- I go
to work every day and I see little kids. I have worked with pre-K on up, but
right now my role is working with little kids from pre-K through fifth grade. I
see the pain on their faces. I also see the violence that they live with in
their homes.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I see them afraid to talk about it. I
see them just being afraid sometimes of coming to school. I see them making
excuses and projecting blame on other people and on situations. I see them and
hear them saying things they have absolutely no business even knowing about at
their ages. I see a lot of tragedy.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">But fortunately, I am not the only one
who sees it. I work with wonderful people, particularly in one of my schools,
who have vision and who care about the kids. And because of that, we are all
able to come together to put together prevention plans in place.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The school is open only 9, 10 months of
the year, just like any other school. However, the school is also open during
the summer time. We have programs year-round, including programs where sometimes
people volunteer their time because we don't get paid. We do what we can, and we
teach children how to problem-solve; we teach children social skills; we try to
make them more available for learning; we enhance and elevate little things,
like reading appreciation for example.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">We have a program right now, right
after the announcements, we have 30 minutes reading -- anything you want,
reading, within limits. And we also have contributions from people who care
about us from the community. We have parent involvement. There are lots of
things that are good about the schools. But then there are lots things upon
which we need to continue our vigilance for our children's sake, and because
they are our future, they represent us. They will be sitting where you are
sitting within the next generation.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">And it is up to us to help to train
them in the way we would want them to train their children.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Thank you.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mr. Welsh</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
Members of the Subcommittee, Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank you for the
invitation to come and speak here today. I am one of the Columbine High School
parents. My wife, Nancy, and I have been blessed with four wonderful sons,
Aaron, a senior, Christopher, a sophomore, and the twins, Sean and Nicholas, who
are in the sixth grade. We have been residents of the Columbine community since
1979, and up to this point we felt it was a great neighborhood to raise our
children in.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">It seems a lifetime has passed with all
that's happened to our families affected by this tragedy. And yet it is as vivid
in my mind as though it happened yesterday. The grief and sorry of this event
affected many students, family, and friends, even directly or indirectly, like a
shock wave spreading outward from one of those pipe bombs.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">It seemed everywhere we turned we
discovered we were touched again by it. My sons Sean and Nicholas have a friend
whose older brother Brian was shot in the library. Fortunately, he received only
minor injuries. The boy being pulled out of the second-story library window onto
the armored truck after being shot was a counselor for Nicholas during his
outdoor lab week.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">My son Christopher went through school
and played football with Matt Kechter, who was killed in the library.
Christopher and others fled out of the east entrance of the school to Leawood
Park. Students reported bullets whizzing by and hitting the ground nearby. So
they ran farther east into the residential area.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Heath Kelly Bergesher was in the
commons hallway just outside the cafeteria door when the shooting began. There,
she was able to flee down a hallway and later a teacher helped them escape out a
side door.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">My brother-in-law in Arizona has a
college roommate that's a father of one of the girls that tried to help a
teacher, Dave Sanders, stay alive. And he died in the company of those students
that he loved.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Aaron was trapped in the library with
the other students when the two suspects entered to continue their mission of
death and destruction. I would like to read a short paper Aaron wrote for his
psychology class about this horrific event and what it meant to him. He said:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Before I can go through what I
learned from the tragedy of Columbine High School on April 20, I would like to
retrace the incident. When it started, I was in the library doing homework for
history class. I was at a desk in the middle section when a teacher came running
into the library. She ran behind the desk and told us to get under the desk.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">While under the desk, I hear gunshots
and explosions in the commons below the library. I looked down the hallway and
saw a big flash of light, and then smoke started to come through the hallway.
Very soon after, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold entered the library.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Dylan stopped by the main desk and shot
behind it. I don't know if he was shooting at the phone or the teacher. He then
joined Eric by the computer desk. Eric lit a pipe bomb and threw it over to the
west windows. And explosion blew them out.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">They started systematically shooting
under desks and laughing at what they had done. They walked across a section
that I was in and into the reference section, where they shot more people under
the desks.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Eric moved back to the computer desk to
reload his shotgun while Dylan came up the middle section and walked by a desk I
was under. He never saw me. He rejoined Eric by the computer desk, as he was
lighting a Molotov cocktail, threw it one of the desks. I don't think it worked
because there was no smoke or fire.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Then he left the library and went down
one of the main halls. When those of us in the library decided that they were
far enough away, we all got up from our desks and got out the back door, taking
the injured with us.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">This incident really has not caused me
to change my lifestyle, but it has taught me a lot about my family relationships
and those with my family and friends.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">This tragedy took 15 lives and injured
others. Two of those I will not discuss. Twelve lives were students who will not
be coming home after school and telling their parents about their day. The 13th
life was a dedicated teacher who made sure that the students had a quality
education.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">And like many others, Eric and Dylan,
we never saw them again. After the incident, I had time to reflect on what had
happened. I realized that I could be one of those students who didn't make it
out alive. When I realized this, I started to wonder about how I would be
remembered, how my friends and my family would see my life. Would they say I
lived my life to the fullest? Or would they say something different?</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">This got me thinking about the
relationship of my family and friends. I have found that I have become closer to
my family and friends. I received calls from many extended family and those
other friends of my parents. I have had fellow employees at the grocery store
and numerous customers come up to me and give me a hug and ask how I am doing.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Right now, I would not change anything
in my life. This incident has taught me about the importance of family and
fiends.&quot; -Aaron Welsh</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">To me it seems that Eric and Dylan were
disenfranchised from their peers and had no hope. Their sole energy was based on
acceptance by peers. Without a set of values and principles, the solid
foundation in our lives to guide us, and those transient relationships are like
the shifting desert sands.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Is it any wonder that school violence
seems to be on the increase when our country is enjoying more economic success,
yet it is becoming more spiritually and morally bankrupt.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Thank you.</font></p>

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me begin with Dr. Kingery. I believe in your
comments, sir, that you made references to the fact that, I think you said, ``We
don't really study this problem; we don't really research this problem.''</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Could you elaborate on that and give me
your sense, give the Committee your sense of where the specific lack of study
is?</font></p>
<font FACE="Century Schoolbook" SIZE="1">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mr. Kingery</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
Yes. The studies that are being done are either administrative studies of
administrators or studies of opinions of students, self reports of their violent
behavior. There is no study on a national level about sexual harassment in
schools, threats, intimidation, taunts, and bigotry and that sort of thing at
all.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">There are several national studies out,
and none of them are looking at those things. The other problem is, we are
looking at numbers of expulsions for carrying weapons at school, carrying
firearms at school. But nobody is asking the question, how many are getting
caught. They are just asking how many are expelled.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Well, you don't know what the ratio is.
Besides that, when we cross-reference what the kids say about how often they are
carrying weapons with how often they are actually being expelled for it, there
is a huge gap. Like I say, only 1 percent are expelled.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">And one-third of them are either just
expelled for less than the one year recommended by the Gun Free Schools Act or

I think there has to be a multi-faceted approach. Counseling certainly is a very
valuable part of that. I think enlisting community resources -- we work real
well with the juvenile department, the county juvenile department. And often
times, some of these kids who do display some of the discipline problems are
linked that way. But in the small town where I am currently teaching_it's a very
small town_there aren't as many resources for kids as we would like to see.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mr. Kildee</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
Well, you should meet him. Is the size of a school, particularly a high school,
a factor that can contribute to school violence? And let me ask the second half
of this question which I also asked of the students, can or should we do
something about the divisions or cliques that often exist in high schools?</font></p>
<font FACE="Century Schoolbook" SIZE="1">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mr. Lane</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
I guess I would, from my perspective -- I'm not an expert, I am just a teacher
who had an experience -- but from my perspective, it depends on the culture of
the school. If there is a warm, inviting, loving, supportive culture in the
school, I think the size becomes less important. But I also believe it is more
difficult to maintain that supportive structure when the school does get very
large. So it has to be very intentional that the administration and the faculty
and the community see that as a priority to establish a real supporting
environment in the schools.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">As far as cliques go, that is a
difficult one. It is hard. I guess one of the messages I always try to talk
about when I talk about what happened is, I think you have to teach kids to
respect each other. They don't always have to like each other, but they have to
respect each other. And respect means you care about them, and you allow them to
be themselves.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Now, if there is something dangerous in
there, then that is another issue. But cliques, there are jocks and there are
cowboys and there are different factions. When they respect each other and they
care about each other, then they don't always have to like each other, and they
can still exist.</font></p>

<font FACE="Century Schoolbook" SIZE="1">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mr. Lane</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
That is absolutely true.</font></p>

</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mr. Kildee</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
Dr. Kingery, could you respond to both parts of that question?</font></p>
<font FACE="Century Schoolbook" SIZE="1">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mr. Kingery</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
I believe that is a critical part of what needs to change about the way we do
business in schools, but I am not sure it is how much of it is we need to do it
and how much of it students need to do it. I don't believe that you can any
longer carry on with the idea that boys will be boys unless you believe that
boys will be sexual harassers, boys will be criminals.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">And the entry of girls into these
phenomena make it even more questionable to make such ideas, you know,
prevalent. I believe that the kids that are in cliques, kids that are not in
cliques, that are isolated, need to be brought in with constructive activities.
We need more counselors, far more counselors. I think it is shameful the small
investment that goes into meeting basic needs of kids that have very real
problems in school. I am not talking about talk therapy; I am talking about
helping a kid with a very critical problem that they are facing, finding the
early warning signs, watching out, but using the students as a network.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Administrators can't do this alone. The
students know who has got the gun first, and they know who is alienated, they
know who is depressed. And very often, the kids know who is on special
medication or maybe just needs a little help.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mr. Kingery</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
Absolutely. The size of the school is critically important, the science says,
unequivocally. Smaller schools, smaller classes, schools within schools, smaller
grades -- like ninth-grade standalones as opposed to with the older kids --
those techniques are effective. One important thing they do, the causal
mechanism, is that they make sure that the teachers and staff know the names of
the kids and are more likely to know the problems that go on there.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">And the kids themselves have continuity
with one another. So they establish a peer group that allows them to communicate
better and help one another with their problems.</font></p>

Yes. I don't know if the size of the school is crucial, but I do know that the
size of the classrooms is crucial. The less students, you get to know the
students better. Maybe some of these things -- maybe we can head it off before
it goes down the wrong road.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">And I do believe we need more
professional staff in schools, and not just people like this resource officer
that I was talking about. But we need more counselors, and they need to be doing
things other than figuring out somebody's class schedule. I mean true counseling
that needs to take place. And that is not possible when you have one counselor
for 350 students, which is the case at Thurston High School.</font></p>

It makes me pretty thin. The needs of the buildings are different, and the
support services in the buildings are different. Some buildings have a lot of
support services, and some buildings do not. As I indicated in one of the
buildings, I am working very closely with implementing prevention. And we have
been doing that since I arrived there last August, and we will continue to do
that until they reassign me and I go somewhere else.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">But we are working very hard to make
sure that we have a preventive culture in the schools. That is very important
because everybody who comes into the school, even though they come from a
different school culture, whether it is a family or a teacher or a student, they
will learn to adapt to our culture and, therefore, they will change some of
their behaviors to conform to the culture that we are promoting at the school,
which is a positive one, not one where children don't care about other children
and teachers only care about their classrooms.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">We are trying to promote a culture in
the school where everybody is responsible for everybody else and that we care
about the students. And so therefore, we spend extra time teaching them, if you
don't understand how to ask a question, then it is okay. We give them permission
to come to an adult or to go to another child who they may feel more comfortable
with. We are trying to put peer mediation in; we are trying to put conflict
resolution in. We are tying to put all the pieces in that will work in that
particular school.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">However, we won't do it at least the

do it in the places that are asking for our help.</font></p>

Yes. Thurston High School, I think, is considered a very disciplined school. I
mean for all different ranges of discipline, including expulsion, which is what
happened to Kip Kinkel. I would say something here to get a plug in for this, I
think it is important that when you do expel a child from school that there is
some kind of a rehabilitation or a further program to help, rather than just
expelling and nothing happening from that point on because then you really
haven't solved anything when he can come back later on as well.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mrs. McCarthy</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Before I got here to Congress, I was a nurse. I still
consider myself a nurse. So I do believe in preventive medicine, and I think it
is something that can work. And I think we have to realize, no matter what we
decide here, we are not going to save every child. And what I am concerned about
is that as we talk through this, trying to come up with solutions to help as
many children as we can, someone is not going to say we can't do anything.
Because we are hearing a lot of that. You know, we can't solve this. And that is
not the right way to go.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">We can solve a lot of these problems.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">One of the things that I am very
concerned about, my young people feel that, and I am talking about my kids in my
high school and my junior high, they feel that they are being labeled. The
majority of the kids that I know are good kids. We are talking about a small
amount of children that need the extra help.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">We cannot take the chance of labeling
all of our young people. It is wrong. Our parents did it to us. What is going to
happen to this generation? And we are seeing it, and we are hearing the kids. If
you listen to the children, that is what they are talking about: Everyone is
saying we are no good. We as adults are sending that wrong message.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I will say, as far as this country on
morals, I am sorry, the people I see across this country have good morals. We
see volunteerism up all over this country. We see people getting involved on a
daily basis. There might be some lack of morals on certain small percentages.
Again, do not classify the majority of the people in this country.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">We see people in church more and more.
And I want to go back to certainly the Hamilton Fish Institute. You have said
that you have done studies, you have solutions. We don't have to reinvent the
wheel, and I don't believe in reinventing the wheel. We shouldn't try and
reinvent the wheel. But, again coming back, and I am sorry that I have to harp
on this, the easy access of guns to children. What has your research shown?</font></p>
<font FACE="Century Schoolbook" SIZE="1">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mr. Kingery</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
Well, as I said before, we haven't adequately studied, even easy access for
children, to handguns. And what we have found is that parents are spending less
time with their children in general. We are finding that there are very few laws
to keep the handguns locked up, and make parents in any way accountable for
that. We find there is great inconsistency in enforcement of those laws.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">When it comes to passing one blanket
piece of legislation that would cover the whole thing, I don't use the word
solution. You know, there are things that make it better. You know, we can't
talk in absolute terms. There are ways that make it better all the way around.
But we are just beginning to study what those are.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Limiting access to handguns, and
handguns in schools, has a whole lot to do with the subtleties of how you keep a
whole management system going, in keeping the weapons out. It can't be a metal
detector at the front door. That has never worked, and it won't work in the
future. It is more complex than that.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">And there are about a dozen things that
any one school can do to help keep weapons out of school that really work.</font></p>
<font FACE="Century Schoolbook" SIZE="1">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mrs. McCarthy</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
I agree. I will put the responsibility onto parents. And I think parents have to
owe up to that. I think in part of your testimony you had mentioned 15 States
that have strict laws on making parents responsible. And that has cut down on
accidental homicide and suicides.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Again, everything we are talking about
today certainly is because of the schools and the shootings we have seen in
them. Let's not forget the big picture. Thirteen kids a day die, 13 kids a day.
That is a classroom every two days. But they don't make the news. That is what
we are supposed to be dealing with, not just school shootings. But we can help a
lot of those kids. And I do believe we can, as long as no one gets caught up
into the politics of it.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">And that I hope will not happen.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Thank you.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mr. Tancredo</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just want to express my sincere appreciation to all
of you, of course, but Mr. Welsh especially whose poignant testimony once again
rekindled the thoughts and feelings I had when we first met. You remember, Mr.
Welsh, you and I shared your feelings that day and we both shed tears at the
time.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I must admit that it has had that
similar effect in recounting what you were saying to me that day. So I just want
to tell you how much I appreciate your coming here and sharing that poignant
story with us.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I am also reminded of, as we sit here
and talk about the various intervention strategies that are identified in each
of your testimonies, and in the research especially, what we do know about two
shooters in Colorado, Harris and Klebold.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">We do know, as a matter of fact, they
were identified early on with problems. We know, as a matter of fact, that they
had a lot of intervention, that they had a lot of counseling. We know that they
were on probation, as a matter of fact, for other violent crimes. I shouldn't
say violent crimes. They were on probation for other crimes they had committed
earlier on.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">We certainly knew who they were. I was
told yesterday, and I don't have corroborating information to this, but I was
told that over a year and half ago they were both suspended from school because
they had broken into a teacher's computer file. They were actually the student
assistants in this classroom and had broken into their teacher's computer file
and stolen the locker combinations and then went and put death threats in
certain lockers of people that they were looking at.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">And this was a year and a half ago. I
understand that they were both suspended at that time from this school. All
right? Now, I also read in the Sunday paper, the Rocky Mountain News, a long,
long story about a family in Lamar, Colorado, that had a son that, frankly, as
you read the story anyway, would have been a mirror image of Mr. Harris; the
young man that was the sort of ringleader of the two in this situation.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">And they had done everything imaginable
-- every single thing you can possibly identify -- every one of the intervention
programs, and some we have never heard of. They were at the point, and they had
in fact given up rights to the child so that Medicaid could finally come in take
over and put him in a longer-term program of psychiatric care because they
couldn't afford it anymore. But they were dedicated parents who identified a
problem they knew was there and they were looking everywhere for help. And they
were getting it. They were getting everything that, you know, all of you
gentlemen and lady at the table, talked about as being important.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">But, you know what, it hasn't worked.
It didn't work. Mr. Klebold and Mr. Harris. What do we do when all of the
intervention strategies that we have identified, all the counselors in the world
have participated in the process, what do we do?</font></p>

Right. I understand. I am just saying that the state of art of the prevention
programs is extremely low. They are not adequately developed. They are not based
on what works. They are based on things like self-esteem -- self-esteem is not

They are misguided programs based on intuition. There is very little evaluation
going on with those programs. But the ones that are evaluated, some are 20 times
more effective than others. They address the root causes, the risk factors that
we know are important. And it is not a mystery what those factors are.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mr. Welsh</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
I would like to mention thing concerning the relationship between the parents
and the school. I have several cousins, first cousins, that are teachers, and
two of the things that pop up most commonly as complaints in their profession is
the problem with discipline in the schools and with motivation. And it is a
shame when I have them tell me that they think about quitting the career because
they can't seem to get support from the administration when children are not
motivated, they don't care, they don't do the work.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">And then when they get low grades
because of that lack of effort, when the teacher marks them down and they pass
out the report cards, and the parents are in there on their backs complaining
about why little Johnny didn't get a good grade and he is misunderstood and
everything. And so he acts up in class a little, but that is okay. And then the
administration doesn't support the teachers.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I see two areas. It all begins in the
home. Parents have to be able to learn to raise their kids with respect for life
and with a decent set of values that we can live in this society and get along.
And it has to begin there. And then it has to carry on through into the school
system.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">And the parents and the school systems
have to be in unison as far as their efforts. And there has to be agreement.
That is difficult nowadays in a Constitutional Government where you have all
kinds of different opinions on what is proper and what isn't and what you can
allow in a public school system and what you can't.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">But somehow that has got to be
reinforced in the school system at what they begin with at the home, hopefully,
is carried on in the school system in terms of academic, high academic standards
and acceptable behavior and value systems.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">And if there is a problem with that,
then that has to be worked out. But I think that that has to go hand in hand. My
mother, when I went to junior high, the first day of registration, she talked to
my homeroom teacher, and I will give you an example of what a brief early
detection and intervention and counseling session was like. She told my homeroom
teacher with me sitting there with her, as a conference, she said, I expect Lyle
to behave in school, like he does as I expect at home. And if he misbehaves,
gives you problems, you have the right to punish him. And you call me, and when
he comes home, I will punish him.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">So I knew right away that what they
were expecting from me, my family and the school, was something that I had to
accomplish. Otherwise, I reaped the consequences of my actions.</font></p>

Absolutely. Suspension and expulsion are not solutions. I am not saying we don't
need to separate them from the other children in the school sometimes. I don't
believe that labeling works, though we need to try to avoid labeling. But put
them in separate alternative ed programs and give them services. Don't kick them
out.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mr. Kingery</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
Yes, but I believe the solution is not always at the bottom of the hill, where
kids are jumping off a cliff. Start earlier. When you see those risk factors_we
recognize them in elementary school, and we recognize them in families and can
pick the kids out from various schools within a district and put them in special
programs.</font></p>

I would be glad to. I wasn't really hedging. It's that there are so many, and it
depends on the question you are looking at. But I will hold up one great
resource on that that has just been sent to every school in the country, the
Annual Report on School Safety. It has specific programs, specific solutions.
And since that, just this last week we finished a study of 100 programs, and
that is in my testimony. Each one is specifically named. Its level of
effectiveness is specifically mentioned. And its characteristics are clear.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mr. Kingery</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
Yes. Depending on what you are looking for. Universalistic programs that teach
all kids just avoid violence, have good morals don't work. There is a modicum of
education that needs to go to all students. But there are students who have very
special needs, high-risk students. We don't like to label them, but catch them
when they are having behavioral problems young. Teach them skills. Didactic
teaching is not enough. They need small, focused skills training programs.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">And all the effective programs are
doing that. But the kid is not the problem. The school environment is very often
a big part of the problem. We like to think by now that we have worked all the
bugs out of schools. But now with guns in the equation and other weapons, it's a
new game. And we have to revise the_rethink the way we organize school policies
and procedures.</font></p>

None. In fact, there is concern about what, how should we train them. What

we just don't know yet quite how to go about it. And there is big experiment
under way this fall on that in schools all -- in 50 communities. And I would

Very good. I appreciate that. This has been a very informative panel, and I
really appreciate what everyone has been saying. But let me go back to something
that Dr. Kingery mentioned initially and then came back and added to it later in
the context of another question. Maybe that will lead up to my question.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I really appreciated the fact that you
said, Dr. Kingery, and others have said it one form or another, but you said
let's cut through the rhetoric and move to the science and knowledge that we
already have available. And then, in another context, you said, we are not
talking about pop therapy but we need serious professional help. And that really
leads right into what has been troubling me.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">And you are all experts, and I want to
hear what you have to contribute on this because what I have been known to say
is that, after all, we are not in the dark ages here. There is certain knowledge
that we have that can deal with. And in addition to all the rhetoric, and I am
definitely with Congresswoman McCarthy on the guns' issue and certainly with all
those who are talking about the culture of violence and the videos and all of
that. It is all of the above, but it is something more as well.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">And that is the question of mental
health and what we know about early warning signs and the professional help that
we should be getting in that respect for these young people. See, I think of
Columbine as exhibit A, and although one of the young men evidently had private
treatment, the problem is that, as I see it, that as he went through the
juvenile justice system -- they did, they went through that -- and as they went
through the school system, there was not a coordination either with the schools,
the guidance people, the school psychologists, the parents -- at least there has
been no evidence of that -- and the juvenile justice system.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Eleven weeks before this happened,
those two young men were released from the juvenile justice system with glowing
reports. They were wonderful. Of course, there are legal questions that may have
suppressed some of the information, but there is no indication that the
probation -- juvenile justice system under probation -- had any link to what the
schools are doing. Now I would like the best advice from those you on the panel
because I think we have to set up those links, protecting confidentiality, but
bringing everyone into the system and getting the professional help that is
necessary.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">But include juvenile justice -- I have
some legislation here that I would like to see adopted -- and connect it to the
Elementary-Secondary Education Act. But, apply all our knowledge, professional
knowledge, in a system to help these kids and to protect the rest of the
community.</font></p>

I would like to speak directly to that situation because I have talked with some
people, and that is what kind of concern several parents that are involved in
some of the critical aspects of this particular case that have been dealing with
the law enforcement agencies and the school system.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">When the law enforcement agency has on
the table at a meeting a file that has information on Eric Harris' previous
brush with the law and also the complaint at the time of the death threats to
certain students--</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mr. Welsh</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
And in pushing the issue with the authorities to try to get some kind of
response and to investigate the situation, when they are sitting there at the
table talking about this and they check the files and they do happen to find
something on an Eric Harris, but they weren't allowed to say because of him
being a juvenile, if that would go on or not, they had at their disposal on that
table at the very same time files that addressed both these issues.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">And yet that information was not
cross-referenced, it was not made use of, and it was not used in their decision
to take them off the program, give them an early release on the intervention
program. Personally speaking, if I were a judge or counselor involved in that
case, and that information were given to me, I would have great concerns about
being able to release children from a program like that based on the information
that had already been collected.</font></p>

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have two questions, and I would like each of you, if
you will, answer it. The first one is short; the second one you will have to
come up with your thoughts.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">First of all, would Littleton,
Springfield, Moses Lake, and the others have happened without access to firearms
and explosives? Question one. Question two: As very informed, caring members of
the public and concerned about what has been going on, what is your opinion of
why we as a nation and why we as a Government don't step up to the issue and do
something about it.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">And I will start with you, Doctor.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mr. Kingery</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
Very challenging questions. What would have happened in each one of those
settings? I know only, being remote and only guessing, but it would have been
different if guns weren't in the equation. But I don't believe that guns are
going to be removed from the equation. So it is pretty hypothetical.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">But if there are some protections
around those issues, and some subtle things -- if we can bring people to the
table, and that leads to the second part of your question, why we don't step up.
When it comes to guns, there is inflamed rhetoric. There is the NRA on one side,
and there is the other camp on the other side. And very few people want to sit
down and say there is an area where we can meet and talk. And that is about
unsupervised access to weapons among minors, that that is an issue we ought to
be able to agree on. We ought to be able to do some legislation on, and some
policy and programming.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mr. Chapman</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
I'm not sure I can add anything of any merit to any of that. Obviously, the
outcome would be, would seem to be very different if that were not an option for
the access. And as to why that debate will go on, that probably has to fall in
the list of the many, many debates that we will not understand why they can't be
resolved and just come to an agreement. But that is part of, I guess, this
process that we are in today.</font></p>

Yes. I am. The guns certainly put a different part to the equation. I would like
to hear the NRA sometime say that it is not okay to commit a crime with a gun
and vigorously support action to solve that. If they would solve that equation,
maybe part of it would get better. I don't know.</font></p>

Obviously outcomes would have been different without explosives and firearms. So
I won't even go any further than that because that's obvious. If the students
don't have the guns, they don't have access to bomb-making materials, then a lot
of lives who were lost would be with us today.</font></p>

</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Ms. Francis</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
Yes, they could have. There have always been knives and bats. However, firearms
and explosives tend to be a lot more, if you will forgive me, cool. And the
children today seem to be a lot more desensitized; whereas, you and I are
sensitized. When they play video games, that appear they are at target practice
walking down the hallways and shooting. I mean, it is a simple matter, even if
you have just learned how to pull the trigger, you already have targeting
practice established via simulation.</font></p>

would they use it?</font></p>

Obviously, the outcome would be different. I don't know if the outcome would be
any less acceptable, obviously, but I think there are a couple things that need
to be pointed out. Mr. Souder mentioned earlier, in our situation, guns were not
the only thing involved. Pipe bombs and Molotov cocktails--</font></p>
<font FACE="Century Schoolbook" SIZE="1">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Ms. Woolsey</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
Well, I said explosives.</font></p>
<font FACE="Century Schoolbook" SIZE="1">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mr. Welsh</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
Right. And so, when you can make a pipe bomb with standard, ordinary, everyday
materials--</font></p>
<font FACE="Century Schoolbook" SIZE="1">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Ms. Woolsey</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
Mr. Welsh, I said explosives. If they weren't part of it too. I'm not saying
explosives are better than guns.</font></p>
<font FACE="Century Schoolbook" SIZE="1">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mr. Welsh</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
But, nevertheless, you can still make pipe bombs with everyday materials. In
household and hardware, you can make a pipe bomb with those materials. So how do
you go about trying to impose some kind of a system where you can control those
kind of materials in order to not assemble pipe bombs or Molotov cocktails? I
think the issue about guns has to be emphasized again, to be looked at, but it
concerns me when, in the past two years, it has been said that 6,000 kids were
caught with guns in the schools and only 13 were prosecuted.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Why isn't the Justice Department
pursuing this issue? We have already got a lot of gun laws on the books. In
fact, I understand the estimate, I have heard numbers around 20 State and
Federal laws were violated with these two kids at school. So I think there are a
lot of things that have to be looked at. If someone has the intent and evil in
their hearts, they will find a way to do one or the other.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">As far as the issue of hypothetically
or what do I see as the problems, I think there are three of them. One is
declining values and lack of religious training. I think that is the primary
problem here. That is the root of all these problems. We are looking at
Band-Aids to cover up--</font></p>

Yes. Two is just the lack of support and involvement by the parents and working
in unison with the schools. I think three is inefficient and governmentally
burdened school districts that have difficulty providing a pleasant and

Well, first I want to thank each of you for your work in this field,
particularly those of you, I know, Mr. Lane, you said you were just a teacher.
In that position, there is no such thing as just a teacher. In that position,
each one of you are, in different ways, giving back to the community. And, Ms.
Francis, I do want to say that some of the reason these things aren't occurring
isn't just because we don't care. People who really care can disagree in policy
as well.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I have three kids, and I care deeply.
But it doesn't mean that I am going to necessarily result in backing somebody's
particular bill. NRA, in fact -- and I need to point, I am not a gun owner. I
never have been a gun owner. But the NRA, in fact, favors prosecution with gun
laws.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I have supported --and one of my
frustrations today, there's really two parts of it. One of it is that I
supported the gun bill that made it illegal to be not only on school grounds but
near school grounds, which had -- and I supported the V-chip, which a lot of my
colleagues haven't. I definitely see the impact that some schools are doing a
much better job in peer counseling. But the truth is, that there is an
underlying cultural problem that because some people are uncomfortable with
that, we are unwilling to address some of the moral crises of this country. And
secondly, the drug problems.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">But I wanted to talk to Mr. Chapman for
a minute because, first, I wanted to thank you. You have been in Fort Wayne a
number of times. You have had a tremendous impact in our community. And your
work in this area is really important.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">In part of your testimony that you
didn't have a chance to read that will be in the record, you quoted James Q.
Wilson as saying, much of this is moral foundation. And he is an expert on this.
He did juvenile justice studies for and projects that I have participated in
over the years. But you also had an interesting line, you said the church sounds
an uncertain trumpet. Clearly, you can tell today if we are banking on the
schools to suddenly have the moral trumpet, it isn't going to happen.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">What did you mean by the church? And
you have taken personal efforts. But how can we get other Christians to reach
out, and other religions to reach out around them? We hear of this whole thing
in Kosovo, people of different religious backgrounds bombing each other, for
crying out loud, and killing each other.</font></p>

</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mr. Chapman</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
Well, I think that the issue, in so many ways, and all I will do, being very
much not an expert at any of these things, is refer to the Government of my own
home and watching my own children grow up and seeing the implications there of,
as something was said earlier, about the goodness in each of us. And I have
watched my incredibly wonderful children be incredibly violent, and it is a
matter of training and a matter of them learning through a process that there
are rights and wrongs that, just like there is the law of gravity, regardless of
what we think of it, how we may like it or dislike it, if we step off of a high
building we are going to go down and there are going to be consequences.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">And I think that even within the church
is at times an attack on our autonomy, it places us under the authority,
ultimate authority of our creator, our maker, and his law.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">And so I think those are some of the
concerns that, again, in an attempt to stay politically correct and stay safe
sometimes and not confront and not in banging people over the head with the
truth. And I have so much respect for everything that I have heard here today,
but, respectfully, you know, issues that I have to disagree with because even as
I listen to your question about if all these other things are done, what, what's
left? Are we hopeless?</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">And as I have stood in Littleton,
Colorado, as I stood with those friends, as I have gone to my hometown of
Paducah, as I have tucked my little girl in bed and said what do you think about
this, and she says, I am just scared. You know, it is moving closer to me
everyday.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I think of this, and I was hoping for
an opportunity to honor the life of Cassie Bernall today, with just this closing
story from me of her life and how her parents, at a time when she was very much
on a moral track of destruction, even involved in witchcraft and some of the
very things that it appears that maybe some of the gentlemen perpetrated the
crime were. And her parents --I spoke with them personally -- and they explained
how, because of their love for her and because of their belief in God's grace
and the power of God's love at work in her life, they enacted what they called
tough love as parents, and began to move into that with much prayer and her life
was changed when everything else seemed to be hopeless to the point that she was
even willing to die for what she believed.</font></p>

And possibly, you could give us a written response. In your risk and protective
factors in the relationship of guns, in carrying a weapon to school, some of
them were, and it is hard to -- I mean, I have tried to understand this. But in
the consequences and the predictor, what screams off the page is, is that if
they are carrying a weapon, 39.5 risk odd that they had used powder cocaine in
grade seven. In other words, it is like two and half times anything. And
marijuana was third.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">And in the other variables, as far as

cause violence. But a lot of kids who are violent use marijuana. It has the
opposite effect, by the way.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">But there are other drugs that are our
concern for violence, and kids that engage in one behavior engage in the other.
It is a very complex interaction.</font></p>

</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mr. Payne</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
Thank you very much, and I am sorry I missed your testimony, but I have gone
through your written testimony. And I compliment all of your for working with
our young people. As I indicated before, I am a former school teacher, active in
the YMCA, and so I think it is so important that we have good people working
with young people.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I went upstairs after I made some
comments about guns and my phone went off the hook. I guess all the NRA people
are looking at it and they were saying what a nut I was. I sound like my
opponents.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">But I still want to get back to even
changing the name. I was looking at the young lady who who testified earlier,
Anita Wheeler, and we are starting to call this school violence rather than gun
violence. And it's gun violence in school. And I think the shift again away from
this business of a gun for every man, woman, and infant in this country is
something we have to come to grips with.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">It makes no sense. Last week in the
Senate, they just said this gun thing makes no -- we are not going to bother
with it until the country said, you got to be crazy. What are you guys on? You
know, I didn't read your paper on substance abuse and all that, but you can not
be thinking seriously if you are going to excuse the use of guns in this.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Now, one of the other things that I see
happening is that we are inter-correlating guns and gun violence and deaths by
guns and explosives. Now, I would like to know the number of people who are
killed by explosives as opposed to the number of people killed by guns used by
young people.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">You couldn't even come up with a
percentage because the number of people -- and because people who are opposed to
gun control are going to say, well, you know, they can make a bomb and,
therefore, you can't control it because they will make a bomb, instead of use a
gun.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Well, no one lost their life by a bomb
in my town. But a number have lost their lives by guns. And so we can't start to
put this, well, perhaps some would have died anyway if the bomb would have
killed them. They are two separate issues. Bomb makers are probably one in
50,000 as opposed to people who have these 235 million guns in this country.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Let me just say quickly, also, that a
gun in the hands of a young person gives them a whole different attitude. I
taught school for a long time, 15 years, and I saw some young fellows, decent,
nice fellows, who even became policemen, and what a difference in attitude from
my students. I was near a light, getting ready to go, they pull their car over,
his hand on his hip. I said, that's little Bobby. Bobby was a little meek kid.
But, you know, when that badge and that authority and that hand there near his
hip -- guns are just different things. Especially for young people -- and this
was an adult who was trained.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">For young people with these guns in
their hands, there is no hope. And so, someone said we can't get them out of
their hands. I don't say we can't get them out of people's hands. We have got to
figure out a way to get guns out of people's hands.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">And one final thing I mentioned before
about the fact that prayer, in school and people wanting to get prayer back in
school. One of my colleagues, evidently, felt that I thought morals and civics
and good things shouldn't be taught in school. I think they should be. I am
simply saying, in my experience, when they used to have the prayer in school,
like I said, my Catholic youngsters stopped at the last part, Jewish kids said
nothing. We didn't have any Arabic youngsters at that time.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I could imagine how they felt. I think
that we should worship who we believe in, but that doesn't mean that we should
not teach the right morals in school. Say the prayer doesn't therefore make
everything right, like some people evidently believe that we need to teach
morals, that we need to teach judgment, we need to teach the right thing, we
need to teach the proper way to behave.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">But, you know, I don't think that has
to be at the first thing in the morning, like we used to have to do every
morning, which, like I said, makes some other kids feel out of place.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Let me just ask a question. The young
lady said, she thought that the class sizes in her area were too big and if they
were reduced that there would probably - said 40 kids, and that is what I had
when I was teaching in school, 40. We are trying to get a bill through to say,
at least in grades one to three, there should be no more than 18 kids in a
class. But we are getting opposition to that.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">What, quickly, since you all are in
schools, what do you think about the one to have less than 18 youngsters in
first grade to the third grade. And do you think that it would be beneficial to
try to nip school violence in the bud? Just real quickly. I imagine they are all
yeses, I hope.</font></p>
<font FACE="Century Schoolbook" SIZE="1">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mr. Welsh</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
I have catch a plane. So maybe I will go ahead and lead off here. I think there
is a correlation between school size and the class size and the pupil to teacher
ratio. As we said earlier, that can vary even within that situation based on the
environment or the kind of learning environment that you have created for the
students and the teachers, and given the teachers the tools and, to my way of
thinking, some discipline or the ability to handle their classroom and be able
to command respect and accomplish their task without tying their hands behind
them.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">So, I think the smaller the class the
better, up to a certain point based on just economics involved and
inefficiencies involved. So if you can get more one-on-one with teachers to the
pupils, I think that is better.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Now, how you accomplish that within
given school districts and their budgets is real difficult to do. But I think it
is something that should be stressed.</font></p>

I agree. It is my experience that regardless if you are in first grade or if you
are in 12th grade, when you optimize the learning potential, not saying there
will not be problems, but when you optimize the learning potential of every
child -- if you only have one teacher in there, if you have a ratio of one to
18, you do have a lot more learning going on per child than if you have one to
40.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mr. Lane</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
Yes. I would just echo it. We more and more are having to develop individual
plans for students because they are learning at different rates, and we are
dealing with a lot more. And there is only way you can do that, it is to
maintain a lower ratio. I think the use of technology is another piece that we
need to really consider that it is another tool that can help us to create some
of those lower class sizes. And I think that is something that we are
incorporating in the structure.</font></p>

Again, I can only respond as a parent, but my kids are fortunate to be in a
school system where it is a small classroom setting. I think it has had
definitely a very positive effect and impact. And seeing the one on one time,
and I really believe this. So much of what we are discussing in this is really a
life on life and one on one issue anyway as we go out and become responsible
with whatever our sphere of influence is and wherever we can make a difference.
And I think as it relates to that, certainly class size is part of that.</font></p>

Just an opinion, I think it's great to invest more in education across the
board, but from a research perspective, you can either have smaller schools
within a big school facility, build solid walls where they function separately,
have separate systems within a broader system, and create a similar thing to
what you do with a smaller school. And within any of those, the class size
should be smaller, whether 18 is the magic number or something else. I don't
know.</font></p>

Thank you, Mr. Payne. I will take the last round of questions here for five
minutes. I deferred earlier on, and I think we will be all done at that point.
And let me, obviously thank all of you for being here.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">But I want to talk to you, Mr. Chapman,
if I could a little bit, and maybe change up a little bit in terms of what you
were speaking about before. And I read your testimony. And I actually saw a
little bit in the monitor when I was in a room having a meeting.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">But you are in the entertainment
business, and from what I gathered in talking to many, many groups about this
and otherwise in just what I know, obviously, whether it is true in your family
or not, it is true generally in America today that in the place of parents, in
many instances, you have a different form of thing happening with kids. Often it
is through the cultural media, if you will. It could be a variety of things. It
could be what they see on television. It could be a video they plug into their
VCR. It could be a dance video. It could be something now on the internet
though, which is a new phenomenon of huge, amazing proportions in terms of what
kids are exposed to.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">And a lot more kids either together or
separately are looking at these things. Many people who monitor what kids see
are very critical of the kinds of programming they are seeing, all the way from
just plain television shows to, obviously, movies which have a great deal of
violence in them.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">While you are in the business, you are
not in that side of the business at all. But I would be interested in your
comments on it. Do you understand, I think, the influence of how a child can be
entertained and how they can be influenced? And I would be interested in your
comments about that whole, that whole sort of change that we are having. Is that
impacting these kids? Or can they put it aside? What are your views on all that?</font></p>
<font FACE="Century Schoolbook" SIZE="1">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mr. Chapman</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
I think that there is this systematic desensitizing that has gone on, is a huge
part of, again, the fraying of the moral fabric of our culture. As you were
telling that I was thinking of the first time -- I lived a relatively sheltered
life in Paducah, Kentucky -- and the first time I sat through a movie that was
filled with a lot of the use of GD and that word that I hadn't heard a lot. And
I remember how offended I was and how it affected me, and even to the point as I
left feeling really just kind of bothered by that.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">And I think of how many times now that
I may hear that in a movie that I will watch, and it will just go right past me.
I see it in my own experience. And I think that we would be very foolish to not
believe that we are affected. We live so much in a reset-button culture, it
seems like.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">You know, I think of my kids. And we
have even begun, just as a family, to respond to this, guys, my guys who love
video games along with the rest of 8-and 9-year-olds of the world, to say
anything that involves violence, anything that involves the taking of a life of
another person, we are just going to rule those out.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Because, when it is all over, you push
reset and you start again and you go again. And I think that can't help but
train and have impact in the mind and the heart.</font></p>
<font FACE="Century Schoolbook" SIZE="1">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Chairman Castle</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
Let me follow up. Can this be self-corrected. You have obviously dealt with the
people who run the media business, that are making these decisions. And again
you may be dealing with a different set of people than some of the ones we might
be concerned about. But is the almighty dollar and the ability to make a dollar
so great that they always going to make the games as realistic as possible, the
movies as violent as possible, and whatever it may be in order to attract kids
to it?</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Is that part of the desensitization we
are going through because people won't give that up on a voluntary basis? I am
not much for censorship, but on the other hand, the concept that we are not
going to change any of this now. And I understand that maybe it is not changing.
That Columbine has not had that effect concerns me a great deal.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">What are your thoughts about that,
about the people who run this kind of business and whether they will ever make
changes.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><b>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mr. Chapman</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.
Again, I think it is just a huge question of responsibility. And when we are
given a platform, when we are given the power to impact culture and media and
music. And all of that does that. And I think that there is, again, if I may
quote a scripture, and it gets often misquoted, it is not money that is the root
of all evil, but it is the love of money. And I believe my experience, and I
definitely operate in a pretty different environment, but I do brush enough with
that to see that there is, certainly, a bottom line that is a bottom line.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">And if it is going to sell and it is
going to generate income, then a lot of times responsibility goes out the
window. And I applaud and encourage all that you all can do to challenge that
and raise that question.</font></p>
