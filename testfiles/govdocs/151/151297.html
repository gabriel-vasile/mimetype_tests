</P>
              <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="-1"><B><FONT COLOR="#CC6633">Before 
                we talk about the details of the mission that you're about to 
                fly, I'd like to get a little bit of information about you and 
                how you reached this position. I'm sure a lot of people must ask 
                you why you wanted to be an astronaut. Where in your life did 
                the desire to explore come from?</FONT></B></FONT>
</P>
              <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="-1">The canned 
                answer that most folks expect or give is that I've always wanted 
                to be an astronaut, but in my case I can't really claim that. 
                My dream as a small kid was to fly. I fell in love with aircraft 
                and flying movies and things about flight and built all the little 
                models and all the little airplanes that kids always did when 
                I was growing up. My big goal, or dream in life was to be a pilot 
                and fly airplanes, preferably fighter-type aircraft in the military. 
                You get to do some really neat things with some really neat airplanes, 
                and that was my focus. Thanks to some good folks in my hometown, 
                and my teachers and family who helped me stay pointed in that 
                direction, I went off to the military and became a fighter pilot. 
                As I progressed through my flying career, you always want more 
                and more challenges, and so I kept trying to challenge myself. 
                I went through the Fighter Weapons School, which the Navy calls 
                the Top Gun school, and it was a good experience, although not 
                as much fun as the movie. I went through Test Pilot School and 
                then after that, I basically had all the requirements that NASA 
                looks at to be a shuttle Pilot, and so I said, "You know, 
                I really want to go do that." I'd thought about it, but I 
                hated to set goals for myself that were totally unattainable. 
                If you asked me if I wanted to be President and I said yes and 
                then there was no way that I could ever get there, I'm one of 
                those people that would get frustrated over some period of time. 
                I wanted to fly, and after I got all the requirements that NASA 
                looks at, I applied to the space program and got accepted.</FONT>

              <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" COLOR="#CC6633" SIZE="-1"><B>You 
                made a reference to your hometown and some of the people there. 
                Is there a specific person or two, or events, that you can look 
                back at that were key in your development?</B></FONT>
</P>
              <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="-1">That's actually 
                a very tough question. I would like to give my mother and father 
                the most credit. My dad was always very interested in scientific 
                things and always pushed me in a technical area to always understand 
                how things worked and those kinds of things, so I give them the 
                biggest credit. I grew up in a very small town in North Carolina, 
                and my teachers and the folks in the town that were real good 
                friends definitely helped point me and keep me straight. They 
                didn't let me get in any trouble as a youngster, and they were 
                always watching, so it kept me focused on the right ideals.</FONT>
</P>
              <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" COLOR="#CC6633" SIZE="-1"><B>STS-103 
                will be your sixth space flight. That puts you in some pretty 
                exclusive company-only four other men have ever flown as many 
                as six times. What does it mean to you to be included in that 
                group, and to have another opportunity to fly?</B></FONT>
</P>
              <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="-1">To be honest 
                with you, I really don't think about it being the sixth flight. 
                It's kind of become a joke because on my last flight we had Senator 
                Glenn aboard, and there was a lot of media attention, obviously. 
                I made the joke that the reason we were getting all the media 
                attention was because it was my fifth flight, and everyone got 
                a chuckle out of that. I actually have gotten a lot of questions 
                about it being my sixth flight, but to be honest with you, I don't 
                really think about it. It's another shuttle mission. Every shuttle 
                mission is unique, every shuttle mission is brand new, usually, 
                to an astronaut, and you always dive into that mission with the 
                same determination that you would for any flight. We're very excited 
                about 103, and I've never seen Hubble from space. I am very honored 
                and very excited about being part of the Hubble mission. There 
                are a lot of folks up in Goddard that do a tremendous amount of 
                work - that built the telescope, that got it all going, that have 
                been monitoring it, working it for the last nine years or so. 
                I'm very excited to be a part of that team, and I'm hoping that 
                we as the 103 crew can go up and do the servicing and modifications 
                and bring Hubble back to A1 condition.</FONT>
</P>
              <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" COLOR="#CC6633" SIZE="-1"><B>You 
                mentioned your last flight-you're getting ready to go back to 
                space right about one year after having returned from your last 
                mission. Does flying twice in that space of time make things easier 
                or harder to get ready?</B></FONT>
</P>
              <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="-1">Yes and no. 
                You would think that it would make it easier just because it was 
                recently that you've done this, and in reality, since the crew 
                is a team, you can't really skip anything just because you have 
                flown recently. You still need to work together as a team to build 
                that team effort: the coordination, the communication, the understanding 
                of each other's roles and responsibilities. It doesn't really 
                take anything away from the training requirements, but it does 
                make it easier because, yes, you have been exposed to it recently. 
                We're all getting old here and so you kind of remember things 
                better if you are told over and over again, so that helps our 
                training team get me up to speed. It is actually almost to the 
                day that we launched last year.</FONT>
</P>
              <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" COLOR="#CC6633" SIZE="-1"><B>Now 
                this mission is fairly high profile, but so far has not generated 
                the kind of public reaction that your last mission did. As you 
                mentioned, Senator Glenn was a member of your crew. How is the 
                difference in the attention that's been paid to you making it 
                easier for you guys to prepare?</B></FONT>
</P>
              <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="-1">The last 
                mission was like walking a tightrope between the general public's 
                interest, which was really overwhelming, and the training we had 
                to do. You always want to keep everyone happy and do the right 
                things, so it was kind of a tough line to walk. Everything worked 
                out OK, and we did a good job. This mission, as you mentioned, 
                may not have as much attention yet because we don't have any significant 
                individuals that have a big history on the flight, like Senator 
                Glenn did. We haven't had the attention yet, but I think the attention 
                will come as we get closer and closer to launch. I have a very 
                good, experienced team: with one rookie and the other six folks, 
                we have eighteen shuttle flights to our credit, so I have a very 
                experienced crew. They know what's important and so focusing their 
                attention on the training and the details is very, very easy for 
                me, and it makes my job much easier. We do want the attention 
                and the focus as we get closer to launch because we are part of 
                a significant program, the Hubble Space Telescope program, which 
                tends to rewrite our textbooks about astronomy and space almost 
                weekly. It's amazing the information that we learn from the Hubble, 
                and we're very happy to go up and be part of that team.</FONT>
</P>
              <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" COLOR="#CC6633" SIZE="-1"><B>Let's 
                turn our attention to that. You're preparing for a mission that's 
                being pulled together on relatively short notice for an early 
                servicing visit to the Hubble Space Telescope. First, summarize 
                for us your role in the mission as the Commander on the flight, 
                and what it's like for you to be a part of this flight.</B></FONT>
</P>
              <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="-1">The Commander 
                is given the role of the ultimate coordinator, the bottom line 
                on getting the mission done. It's my duty and responsibility to 
                manage my crew in a way that's the most efficient and to go get 
                the mission done. That's what we all, as astronauts, are charged 
                with. We were announced in March, and we're flying in October, 
                so seven months is a little short compared to our normal template 
                in the shuttle business, but I think it's the way we'll be going 
                in the future. It's kind of nice to maybe break some ground here 
                and try to make sure we can be the most efficient we can be between 
                the beginning of training and the launch date. That's the challenge, 
                and I welcome it. We've done quite well so far. I think we'll 
                be ready to fly in October. Again, I have a very experienced crew 
                so it sure helps me out. I'm also really excited about having 
                a rookie, Scott Kelly, on the flight because it's nice to see 
                their reaction and their face and their emotion when they first 
                get to orbit. We are doing some things that maybe we don't need 
                to do to help him along-not that he needs it-but just because 
                it's his first flight, and we want to make sure he's well prepared 
                and we don't cut anything short for him. It's a challenge, but 
                we're doing fine with it.</FONT>
</P>
              <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" COLOR="#CC6633" SIZE="-1"><B>You 
                referred to the fact that you were named to this mission in March, 
                but four spacewalkers on this flight had begun training for this 
                mission a number of months before that. What's it like for you 
                as a Commander of the mission, the man with the ultimate responsibility, 
                to walk in to a group of people who've already been busy working 
                together on this for some time?</B></FONT>
</P>
              <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="-1">It's really 
                not a problem. It may sound like I come in kind of late and try 
                to change everything, but actually that's pretty normal for the 
                way we organize shuttle crews. If we have a specific scientific 
                experiment, or payload that requires a long time training, or 
                a long lead time-type training, those folks get assigned to missions 
                earlier than the rest of the crew. The extravehicular activity 
                folks were assigned a number of months earlier than we were because 
                they have been doing engineering and evaluation and developing 
                the procedures that we're going to use and go out and work on 
                the Hubble Space Telescope. It's not like working in your backyard 
                where if you need another tool or another wrench you can go get 
                it-once we go up and go spacewalking, we have what we have, so 
                we have to have all those operations choreographed down to the 
                most minute detail. Yes, those folks need to take a little bit 
                more time and training to get that all organized. They've pretty 
                much been working on their separate areas, the EVA part of the 
                mission. We got together as a whole crew once we were assigned 
                and now, I take that part that they've been doing and integrate 
                that into the whole team and it's really not a problem. It's kind 
                of the way we do business-we don't compartmentalize, but everyone 
                in the crew has their specialty, and we give them the responsibility 
                to make sure that happens. That's kind of the way the EVA versus 
                the whole mission works.</FONT>

              <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" COLOR="#CC6633" SIZE="-1"><B>Set 
                the stage for us to have a better understanding of what you and 
                your crewmates are going to do once you get into space. Let's 
                talk about the mission of Hubble itself in the first place. What 
                is it that the Hubble Space Telescope can do that telescopes on 
                the ground, or other telescopes in orbit, can't do?</B></FONT>
</P>
              <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="-1">A telescope 
                is a telescope. It has certain capability and power and range 
                and acuity. The Hubble is really no different than your typical 
                Cassegrain-type telescope that you would have in your backyard. 
                The major difference, and it's relatively easy to understand, 
                is that it's not in your backyard, it's up in space. What makes 
                that different by being in space? We have no atmosphere to look 
                through, which is a major difference. We look through the atmosphere 
                out here every night and see the stars, so you really don't understand, 
                from a telescope standpoint, how bad that atmosphere is for viewing 
                through. We don't have any weather, so if there's nights you can't 
                work, nights you can work, there's no rain showers, clouds, anything 
                to get in the way, and there's no light pollution. There you can 
                point out to deep space and all we see is deep space, we don't 
                get the lights from the nearby town, or city, or that kind of 
                problem. Airplanes flying over or getting in the field of view, 
                any number of things. Space offers a tremendous, unique place 
                to work on the astronomy problem, and so Hubble, being up above 
                the atmosphere, is able to spend all its time looking, without 
                the problem with the weather and the atmosphere, and it's able 
                to do those precise pointing activities and gather that data. 
                That's the difference between Hubble and the telescope in your 
                backyard.</FONT>

              <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="-1">I've been 
                in space a few times, as we've mentioned, and people always ask 
                me what it's like and I try to tell the emotional side of it. 
                I'm probably not very good with emotions, but…when I look 
                out into deep space and I see all those stars, I always ask my 
                question---it's kind of the question of the century for me---and 
                that is, how far does that go? There could be two answers. It 
                could be going out to a certain place and stopping-then my next 
                question is, if it stops, what's on the other side of that? If 
                there's a boundary, there has to be something on the other side 
                of the boundary or some boundary, so tell me why that is. Then, 
                if it doesn't stop, if it goes on forever, I'm not sure we, as 
                humans, can understand what forever is, so tell me what this forever 
                is all about. To me, that is kind of the ultimate question. What 
                Hubble allows us to do is look out into these vast distances and 
                try to understand our universe, understand what space is all about. 
                Whether that means finding new and unbelievable things that we 
                haven't imagined, or getting more data on the things that we already 
                know about. Once we complete that database, or build that database, 
                hopefully we can understand where we fit into this vastness of 
                space. Looking out into deep space and seeing all the stars and 
                the clusters of stars that are so thick they look like clouds 
                here on Earth-I mean, it's just amazing-and so, with so many places 
                to go and see, we need to understand more about how we fit into 
                that. That's what Hubble does for us. It's able to gather data 
                on a weekly basis that, as I mentioned a while back, tends to 
                rewrite our textbooks almost weekly, monthly, for the folks now 
                that are in school, in college and high school that are studying 
                astronomy. Nine years ago, astronomy was totally different, and 
                all that's come from the Hubble, or a large part of it. Hubble 
                is a team, and there's a lot of other telescopes that are helping 
                gather data, but all that's coming from that kind of exploration, 
                that kind of Hubble information.</FONT>

                and just recently the Chandra X-ray Observatory…an infrared

                of have to understand the nature of the magnetic spectrum, the 
                way we see things or view things. We're used to dealing in the 
                visible spectrum, where we look out and we see something, and 
                that's what we do. Because we can look in different areas of the 
                spectrum, we can see things and therefore gather information about 
                the objects, the stars or the planets, by looking in a different 
                area of that magnetic spectrum. For instance, heat is a different 
                way of looking at something, the heat it gives off; x-ray is a 
                different way of looking at something. All of these different 
                telescopes that look at things in different spectrums can then 
                take that data and put it all together. Hopefully, well, we do, 
                learn much more about the object that we're looking at by looking 
                at it in a different way, at different angles, so to speak.</FONT>

                continue its work, Hubble is going to receive its third on-orbit 
                service call from you and your crewmembers although a little earlier 
                than was originally planned due to the failure of some gyroscopes. 
                In this case, what do these gyroscopes do? Why has their failure 
                prompted NASA to take the unusual step of flying this mission 
                earlier than it had originally planned to?</B></FONT>
</P>
              <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="-1">First of 
                all, the gyros, there are six of them, originally, and we only 
                need three to do operations. These three gyros are required to 
                do the precise pointing that Hubble needs to take the long exposure-type 
                information gathering-type images. We need to be able to point 
                very precisely, and the three gyros do that. We had three backups-if 
                we're only using three there must be three backups-but over the 
                years those gyros have failed due to a condition that we now understand 
                and know about. Basically, it was the way the gyro was built, 
                and now we have rebuilt some of the older gyros and new gyros 
                to take care of that. Our mission is to go up, and our number 
                one priority is to replace those gyros. If another gyro fails, 
                and the reason we're doing this mission early kind of fits into 
                this, but if another gyro fails, Hubble will be safe. There's 
                no harm to Hubble, no chance of it hurting itself or getting overheated 
                or going to sleep and never waking up. It's nothing like that, 
                but if Hubble loses another gyro, it'll go into a safe mode and 
                it'll just wait for us to come service it. It's kind of like your 
                car, or something else that you really need or really want to 
                be using. It has a limited lifetime; it's not going to be there 
                forever. Any time that it's not operational and taking data, or 
                being used, that's kind of wasted time. If we didn't do this servicing 
                mission a little early here, and another gyro had failed between 
                our launch time, or planned launch time, then the Hubble would 
                go into safe mode and we would just lose valuable time on orbit 
                that we could be collecting data. Again, with a limited lifetime, 
                you don't want to waste that valuable research time.</FONT>

              <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="-1">The HOST, 
                as we know it-you defined the acronym there, but we like to talk 
                in smaller words-it flew on STS-95 with us. It allowed us to, 
                or it required us to go up to three-hundred nautical miles above 
                the Earth's surface, which is pretty close to where Hubble is, 
                and which gave us a great view of the Earth as a by-product. It 
                required us to go up there and test some of the equipment that 
                we will be installing on Hubble on this mission, the servicing 
                mission, so we have actually tested it in space on STS-95. One 
                of those pieces of equipment was the computer that we're going 
                to put on Hubble on this servicing mission. We tested it in the 
                same radiation environment. Up in space it's a little bit different 
                because you don't have the atmosphere to protect you from the 
                different cosmic radiation or rays that are coming in from deep 
                space. We actually tested this computer up on STS-95, it worked 
                very nicely, didn't have any problems at all, and that gave us 
                a big confidence in taking it up on the servicing mission here 
                and putting it up on Hubble. We tested a Solid State Recorder 
                that will be going up on 103, on the servicing mission. It has 
                no moving parts-it's like your computer. It's solid state memory, 
                whereas the recorders, or one of the recorders that we're using 
                now on Hubble, is a tape-to-tape machine, and that was the technology 
                when Hubble was built...you know, when Hubble went into service, 
                that was the best we could do. Now, we can put up a recorder that 
                can store ten times or so more data, do it very fast, and have 
                no moving parts to break. That gives us another layer of redundancy, 
                so we're going to install that. We also tested a thing called 
                a NICMOS cooler. NICMOS is one of the cameras onboard, and a cooler 
                actually. We used to have a dewar, a bottle is probably the best 
                way to say it, of cryogenic or very cold liquid that was used 
                to cool the detector on this NICMOS camera. Since then we've run 
                out of coolant so this camera can't really be used because the 
                detector, the optics, the sensitive part of the telescope has 
                to be very cold so that it can see very faint objects. We tested 
                a cooler for this camera on HOST, but because of our testing on 
                95 it's not quite ready to go on this servicing mission, so that'll 
                be on a following mission, hopefully the Servicing Mission 3B 
                which will go in the fall of next year. That's pretty much what 
                we tested on 95, and it's kind of rewarding for me to have taken 
                up stuff on STS-95 and tested it for the Hubble Space Telescope, 
                and now we're going to go up on 103 and actually install the same 
                hardware. That's kind of neat for me.</FONT>

                this mission, on Flight Day 3, you and your crew are going to

</P>
              <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="-1">There you 
                go. Actually we'll wake up that morning, on rendezvous day, and 
                we'll do a couple of burns. Scott and myself will do some orbiter 
                height adjust or orbit adjust burns to start the rendezvous process 
                with the Hubble Space Telescope. That'll take a series of a few 
                hours because every time around the planet is an hour-and-a-half 
                or so, so it'll take a few orbits to catch up with Hubble. We'll 
                catch up with it from below, and our last little tweak burn will 
                put us on an intercept course with what we call the R-bar. If 
                you drew a line from the telescope itself as it orbits the Earth 
                directly to the center of the Earth, that would be the R-bar. 
                We'll intercept that R-bar, that line, about eight-hundred to 
                five-hundred feet below the telescope, and then we'll control 
                the orbiter and fly right up that line. Again, I need to define 
                a little bit of what Hubble's going to be doing. Hubble's inertially 
                stable, which means it's pointing at an object in space and as 
                it goes around Earth, it doesn't rotate with the Earth, it stays 
                fixed, pointing at an object in space. As we come up, with us 
                being stationary with respect to the Earth, as we come up that 
                R-bar Hubble will be apparently rotating, because again its inertially 
                fixed in space as we go around the planet. At some point, when 
                the big end of the telescope, the aft shroud end that does not 
                have the aperture door that opens that looks out-when that gets 
                pointed at the shuttle, then we will go inertial in the shuttle, 
                which means we will start being fixed in relation to the telescope 
                and space. At that point, we'll continue closing because what 
                we want is for that big end, the shroud end, not the aperture 
                door but the safe end, we want that end in the bay so that we 
                don't contaminate the telescope or get any debris around the telescope. 
                We'll continue to close up to around forty- to fifty-feet or so, 
                and at that point, we'll slowly start braking so that I can arrive 
                around the thirty-five to forty-foot distance from the grapple 
                fixture, the little pin that we use to grab the telescope, and 
                the payload bay. What that does, though, it puts that big end 
                of the telescope pretty close to the orbiter, down in the bay, 
                and the solar arrays are out there. Again, this approach is made 
                to protect the solar arrays because they're very fragile, very 
                lightweight, and we don't want to disturb them with our reaction 
                control jets. Once we stop, Jean-François, who is my flight 
                engineer and primary arm operator, will maneuver the robotic arm 
                out to grab that grappling pin, the little pin that's on the telescope. 
                Once he has a firm grip of the telescope, we'll secure it with 
                the arm and then he will maneuver the telescope very slowly, again 
                because of the solar arrays and just the telescope itself, down 
                into a structure that we have in our aft cargo bay. We call it 
                FSS, or Flight Support Structure-there's kind of different acronyms 
                depending on what part of it you're talking about-but it has three 
                latches, and on the bottom of the telescope is three, we call 
                them "towel racks," but three bars. What we're going 
                to do is take the arm and bring the telescope down into those 
                three latches, close the latches, and at that point Hubble has 
                now become part of the orbiter. We can disconnect the arm from 
                the telescope, and use it to now maneuver the spacewalkers around 
                the telescope to do the work. All of that will be done in one 
                day, that's a pretty busy day, and each crewmember has a specific 
                duty. I get to do the manual flying of it. I actually put the 
                inputs in to control the orbiter, fire the jets, and do the manual 
                flying. My Pilot, Scott Kelly, will be doing some of that as we 
                approach the telescope, but his primary job is make sure I don't 
                do anything wrong or forget anything, and also to take care of 
                the orbiter, because someone has to "manage the store," 
                so to speak. So he manages, makes sure all the systems on the 
                orbiter are correct and working correctly, and if there are any 
                problems with that, I can continue to fly, he can manage the orbiter 
                and we can continue to rendezvous. Jean-François, again 
                he's my prime operator, will also be working some computers that 
                take the data from our rendezvous radar, from a handheld laser 
                that we shoot out the window at the telescope. All that information 
                goes into a little laptop computer that helps me plan my rendezvous 
                so, again, we don't want to hurt the telescope with our plume, 
                and we don't want to waste a lot of gas. We want to do it efficiently.</FONT>

                two folks are outside. We have one person inside that's kind of 
                like the conductor-the spacewalk conductor. They are charged with 
                the responsibility of making sure we have this whole spacewalk 
                choreographed, or organized, so that we don't have to turn around 
                and go back and get something or miss something here or miss something 
                there. It's very, very precisely choreographed. We have the arm 
                operator who is operating the arm. He usually has a crewmember 
                on the end of the arm, on a foot restraint, moving the crewmember 
                around to different places on the telescope or steadying them 
                so they can do operations with both hands. We have another crewmember 
                that's kind of like the rover that's taking care of additional 
                setups for maybe some Photo/TV requirements. We try to document 
                all our stuff and also we document all the operations to Hubble 
                so that on the next servicing mission the latest information they're 
                going to have is what we provide them with photo documentation. 
                They're doing that. Scott, again, the Pilot is taking care of 
                the orbiter systems, making sure it's healthy, and I like to think 
                of myself as kind of like the coach sitting back and watching 
                the whole team work. Actually we're all watching out the window, 
                making sure that everything is going OK. The big things I worry 
                about, or big things that could happen, things that we as EVA 
                or spacewalkers work on and worry about are, we have an arm that 
                we're moving around the telescope. The telescope has appendages, 
                solar arrays and things. We want to make sure those two do not 
                get in contact with each other. We have spacewalkers, humans outside, 
                and we want to make sure that they're always watched and if there 
                are any safety issues that we bring those up quickly. We have 
                a whole number of tools and tethers and equipment; we don't want 
                any of that equipment to maybe come loose and get away, so we're 
                watching things like that. The team is very well organized, very 
                well practiced, it's like a greased operation-everything's going 
                real smooth. Then if something does happen, then we have people 
                like myself that will say, "Stop, we have to take care of 
                this," and we'll go work that and hopefully not interfere 
                with the rest of the EVA operations. It's a big team effort, and 
                I think that's what a lot of people do not realize - the two spacewalkers 
                outside, yes, they're doing their spacewalking, yes, they have 
                to do a very good job, but they have a whole team behind them 
                in the orbiter taking care of them. Even on the ground because 
                there's a number of people: Mission Control, the Goddard space 
                telescope folks, in Maryland or the Hubble Space Telescope folks 
                in Maryland at Goddard Space Flight Center, all of that team is 
                watching, so it's a lot of team effort.</FONT>

              <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" COLOR="#CC6633" SIZE="-1"><B>You 
                mentioned a few minutes ago that the replacement of the six gyroscopes, 
                the three Rate Sensor Units, is the primary goal of the mission, 
                that's what will make it a success. Certainly you want to see 
                that, but my question is more literal: as you look out the window 
                at these spacewalkers doing their work, what are you most looking 
                forward to seeing?</B></FONT>
</P>
              <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="-1">I would like 
                to be out there with them, actually, but unfortunately, they won't 
                let me go outside. The Hubble Space Telescope has a great history, 
                and I mentioned a little earlier that I'm so honored and proud 
                to be a part of that team, so I'm looking forward to seeing the 
                telescope. Like most people here on the ground, I've seen a lot 
                of photos it has taken, and it truly amazes me the type of information 
                that we can get from the telescope. The telescope is currently 
                working fine, we're just going to go up and get ahead a little 
                bit on some maintenance and replace some items that we wanted 
                to replace so that we can leave the telescope in a much better 
                condition than it arrived in. That's going to make me personally 
                happy, going up there, doing the work, coming home, and knowing 
                that we as a team had a small part in providing the world, not 
                just the Americans, but the world, with the information, data, 
                and photos that the Hubble can take.</FONT>

                are concluded then, and these planned improvements to Hubble have 
                been concluded…it's time for you guys to say good-bye to 
                the telescope and to start to come home. What's the plan for concluding 
                operations with the telescope-undocking day?</B></FONT>
</P>
              <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="-1">OK. The fourth 
                EVA finishes one day, and the very next day we get up, we will 
                let Jean-François, with the Canadian arm, grab hold of 
                the telescope. We'll release it, and we'll put it back to its 
                internal power from batteries and solar arrays, since for all 
                this time it's been on shuttle power. We'll unhook it from the 
                Flight Support Structure in the aft cargo bay and raise it up 
                above the orbiter cargo bay. The solar arrays have always been 
                out, we're not going to retract those or anything, they've always 
                been deployed. However, there are two high gain antennas that 
                are on big arms that we folded up to make the rendezvous and the 
                grapple a little easier and to work around the telescope once 
                it's in the payload bay. We're going to go ahead and command those 
                antennas back down to their working position. Once they're deployed 
                and checked out, we will then open the aperture door, in other 
                words, the door that opens up all this information to the telescope. 
                We want to open it up and get the telescope in an operating configuration 
                before we release it. For example, if the high gain antennas do 
                not deploy correctly, or if the aperture door does not open correctly, 
                we can go outside on another spacewalk and fix that part of the 
                telescope - deploy the high gain antennas, open the aperture door, 
                and put it back in a configuration so that it can do good science. 
                Once it's in that configuration, and the folks at Goddard have 
                checked out the antenna, checked out the telescope and made sure 
                it's fully operational and ready to go, then we release it with 
                the arm, very gently. Then we back away with the orbiter and Hubble's 
                on its way again, to do many, many, many more years of scientific 
                work.</FONT>

                you bring Discovery home to the Kennedy Space Center and you'll 
                have completed an important upgrade to Hubble…also demonstrated 
                that shuttle missions can be planned and executed in a shorter 
                period of time than they have been in the past. You've touched 
                on this before, but to conclude, I'd like to ask you to do it 
                again: when people ask you, how do you explain how this mission 
                that you and your crewmates are about to fly-with the help of 
                all the people on the ground that you've referred to-how do you

              <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="-1">Let's say 
                you were going fishing in the ocean, and you knew nothing about 
                the ocean. The more you understand about the environment that 
                you're going to go operate in, I mean, what kind of fish are in 
                there? How deep is it? How far does it go? Is it salty? Is it 
                fresh? I mean, you just have to know all that information. We 
                go to work in space. I use this example that maybe is boring at 
                times, but let me throw it on you here. We go do public speaking 
                and people ask, "Why do we need to go to space? Why is it 
                taking so long?" or "What are we doing?" I say, 
                well, try to put it in perspective on what we're doing here. It 
                wasn't that many years ago that Columbus was trying to come across 
                the ocean because everyone thought the Earth was flat, and he 
                finally got someone, and here we went, and he found the New World. 
                The Earth was not flat, and we know that obviously. I've seen 
                it. It's round. OK. It wasn't that many years later that Henry 
                Ford came along with the car. Everybody says, "You're crazy. 
                Why do you need a car? We have horses-you're going to scare the 
                horses and hurt people." Obviously that was overcome because 
                now everyone has two or three cars in their garage, and don't 
                know what to do with them. That many years later we had an airplane. 
                The Wright Brothers flew an aircraft, and everybody says, "You're 
                crazy-you're barnstormers, daredevils-you're going to kill yourself…if 
                you were meant to fly you'd have wings," so forth and so 
                on. Now, right now, you and I can go to the airport, we can buy 
                a ticket and get on an airplane, and fly around this supposedly 
                flat world at a moment's notice. At a moment's notice we can fly 
                around the world, and the only thing we can complain about is 
                the food, the service, they lost our baggage, or it's not on time. 
                Now think about where we've come in just a few years. The space 
                program and space travel is the same way. People wonder why are 
                we going to space, why do you need to do this, why do you need 
                to go there? The shuttle's been flying a number of years now, 
                and it's doing a really amazing job. People say, "Why do 
                we need to go to space?" I think we're going to look back 
                a few years from now, and ask "Why in the world were we flying 
                the shuttle for so long? Why didn't we get something better?" 
                Something more, something quicker, faster, and all that and it'll 
                be like the Wright Brothers airplane, going to space, and the 
                thing is, we need to learn what's around us. We're going to go 
                out into space-the human experience, or the human nature is to 
                go explore. I think we're going to go out in space, and it's just 
                a matter of time, and we need to understand that environment and 
                know more about it. The Hubble Space Telescope sees further than 
                we've ever seen before out in space, and it sees back in time, 
                and I think that's probably going into another subject but it 
                sees back in time. It can tell us what has happened in the past, 
                how things formed, how things developed. That information will 
                help us in our future exploration and I think it will help us 
                right here on Earth to better understand how the Earth works a 
                little bit better, and how it interacts with the rest of the environment.</FONT>
