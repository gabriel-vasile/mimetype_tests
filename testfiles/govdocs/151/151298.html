     <STRONG>DESCRIPTION</STRONG>
          The <STRONG>blt_barchart</STRONG> command creates a new window (given by  the
          <EM>pathName</EM>  argument)  and  makes  it into an barchart widget.
          Additional options, described above, may be specified on the
          command  line or in the option database to configure aspects
          of the graph such as its colors and font.  The  <STRONG>blt_barchart</STRONG>
          command  returns  its  <EM>pathName</EM>  argument.  At the time this
          command is invoked, there must  not  exist  a  window  named
          <EM>pathName</EM>, but <EM>pathName</EM>'s parent must exist.

          The  <STRONG>blt_barchart</STRONG>  widget   plots   two-variable   data   as
          rectangular  bars  in  a  window.   The  x-coordinate values
          designate the position of the bar along  the  x-axis,  while
          the   y-coordinate  values  designate  the  magnitude.   The
          <STRONG>blt_barchart</STRONG> has of  several  components;  coordinate  axes,
          crosshairs, a legend, and a collection of elements and tags.

        <STRONG>COORDINATE</STRONG> <STRONG>AXES</STRONG>
          The barchart widget has four axes, two standard  (x  and  y)
          and  two alternate (x2 and y2).  Graph elements and tags are
          mapped onto one x-axis and one y-axis (by default, they  are
          mapped onto the standard axes).

          Each axis consists of the axis  line  and  major  and  minor
          ticks placed at set intervals.  At major ticks, labels (text
          strings) representing the coordinate value of the  tick  are
          drawn.   By  default,  the  tick  labels  are simply numeric
          strings.  However, a Tcl procedure may be supplied to format
          individually each tick label.
          The scale of the axis is determined its minimum and  maximum
          limits.   By  default,  each  axis  is auto-scaled using the
          limits of the data.  However either  limit  can  be  set  to
          manually scale the graph.

        <STRONG>CROSSHAIRS</STRONG>
          Crosshairs are a set of two lines (vertical and  horizontal)
          which  intersect  on  the graph.  They are implemented using
          XOR drawing primitives, so they do not require the graph  to
          be redrawn when they are moved or redisplayed.

        <STRONG>ELEMENTS</STRONG>
          A graph element is a set of data  points  and  configuration
          options  which  determine  how  the  bar is displayed in the
          window.  Elements are created by the <STRONG>element</STRONG>  <STRONG>create</STRONG>  widget
          command.   The configuration options may be specified as the
          element is created or later by the <STRONG>element</STRONG> <STRONG>configure</STRONG>  widget
          command.  There is an internal display list of element names
          which  controls  the  drawing  order  of  the  elements.  By
          default,  elements  are appended to the display list as they
          are created.  The element display list can be managed by the
          <STRONG>element</STRONG> <STRONG>show</STRONG> command.

        <STRONG>LEGEND</STRONG>
          The legend consists of a list of entries, where  each  entry
          is  an  element symbol and label.  By default, the legend is
          located in the right margin  of  the  graph.   However,  the
          legend may appear anywhere in the plotting area of the graph
          by specifying its window coordinates.

        <STRONG>TAGS</STRONG>
          Tags are simple  drawing  procedures  used  to  annotate  or
          highlight  areas  of  the  graph. A tag may be either a text
          string, bitmap, line, window, or  polygon.   A  tag  may  be
          associated  with  a  particular  element, so that the tag is
          displayed only if the element is displayed.   Tags  are  the
          first  items  drawn  when  the  graph  is displayed, so that
          elements, symbols, legend, and axes always appear  in  front
          of them.

          Tags differ from elements in that they  do  not  affect  the
          auto-scaling of coordinate axes.  Furthermore, tags can have
          <EM>elastic</EM> coordinates (specified by -Inf and Inf respectively)
          which translate into the axis minimum or maximum limit.  For
          example, to place a tag so it always remains  in  the  lower
          left corner of the plot, use the coordinates -Inf,-Inf.

     <STRONG>WIDGET</STRONG> <STRONG>COMMANDS</STRONG>
          The <STRONG>blt_barchart</STRONG> command creates a  new  Tcl  command  whose
          name  is  <EM>pathName</EM>.   This  command  may  be  used to invoke
          various operations on the widget.  It has the general form:

               <EM>pathName</EM> <EM>option</EM> ?<EM>arg</EM> <EM>arg</EM> ...?
9          <EM>Option</EM> and the <EM>arg</EM>s determine  the  exact  behavior  of  the
          command.   The following commands are valid for <STRONG>blt_barchart</STRONG>
          widgets:

          <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>configure</STRONG> ?<EM>options</EM>...?
               Queries or modifies the configuration  options  of  the
               widget. Valids options are described in

          <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>crosshairs</STRONG> <STRONG>configure</STRONG> ?<EM>options</EM>...?
               Queries or modifies the configuration  options  of  the
               crosshairs.   This  command is similar to the <STRONG>configure</STRONG>
               command, except that it applies to the options  of  the
               crosshairs,  whereas  <STRONG>configure</STRONG>  applies to the options
               for the graph as a whole.  See  for  a  description  of
               valid options.

          <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>crosshairs</STRONG> <STRONG>toggle</STRONG>
               Toggles the current state of  the  crosshairs,  turning
               them on or off.  This command returns an empty string.

          <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>element</STRONG> <STRONG>append</STRONG> <EM>name</EM> <EM>coords</EM>
               Appends pairs of  x,y  data  points  to  element  <EM>name</EM>.
               <EM>coords</EM>  is  a  list  of  numeric expressions (x,y graph
               coordinates) representing data points.  It returns  the
               empty string.

          <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>element</STRONG> <STRONG>configure</STRONG> <EM>name</EM> ?<EM>options</EM>...?
               This command  is  similar  to  the  <STRONG>configure</STRONG>  command,
               except  that it applies to the options of an individual
               element, whereas <STRONG>configure</STRONG> applies to the  options  for
               the  graph  as  a  whole.   <EM>Options</EM> may have any of the
               values accepted by the <STRONG>element</STRONG> <STRONG>create</STRONG>  widget  command.
               See for a description of valid options.

          <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>element</STRONG> <STRONG>create</STRONG> <EM>name</EM> ?<EM>options</EM>...?
               Creates a new element <EM>name</EM> in the graph.  Element names
               must  be  unique,  so <EM>name</EM> can not already exist in the
               graph.  If  additional  arguments  are  present,   they
               specify any of the element options (see ).

          <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>element</STRONG> <STRONG>delete</STRONG> <STRONG>?</STRONG><EM>name</EM> ...?
               Deletes the element <EM>name</EM> from the  graph.  Returns  the
               empty string.

          <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>element</STRONG> <STRONG>names</STRONG>
               Returns a list  of  all  elements.  This  differs  from
               <STRONG>element</STRONG>  <STRONG>show</STRONG>  in  that  it  returns  the  names of all
               elements, not just those in the element display list.

          <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>element</STRONG> <STRONG>show</STRONG> ?<EM>names</EM>?
               Queries or resets the element display list. The element
               what order. <EM>Names</EM> is a  list  of  the  elements  to  be
               displayed.   If there is no <EM>names</EM> argument, the list of
               elements currently being displayed is returned.

          <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>invtransform</STRONG> <EM>winX</EM> <EM>winY</EM>
               Performs an inverse coordinate transformation,  mapping
               x,y  window coordinates to graph coordinates (using the
               standard x and y axes). Returns a  list  of  containing
               the x and y graph coordinates.

          <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>legend</STRONG> <STRONG>activate</STRONG> <EM>name</EM>...
               Specifies that the legend entries of the named elements  |
               should  be  drawn with the active legend background and  |
               foreground colors.  The entries may also be drawn  with  |
               a   different   relief  (using  the  <STRONG>-activerelief</STRONG>  and  |
               <STRONG>-activeborderwidth</STRONG> options).  <EM>Name</EM> is the  name  of  an  |
               element in the graph.

          <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>legend</STRONG> <STRONG>configure</STRONG> ?<EM>options</EM>...?
               This command  is  similar  to  the  <STRONG>configure</STRONG>  command,
               except  that  it applies to the options for the legend,
               whereas <STRONG>configure</STRONG> applies to the options for the  graph
               as a whole.  See for a description of valid options.

          <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>legend</STRONG> <STRONG>deactivate</STRONG> <EM>name</EM>...
               Specifies that the legend enties of the named  elements  |
               should   be   drawn  with  the  legend  background  and  |
               foreground colors.  <EM>Name</EM> is the name of an  element  in  |
               the graph.

          <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>legend</STRONG> <STRONG>get</STRONG> <EM>string</EM>
               Returns the name of the graph element  at  the  current  |
               screen  position  in the legend.  <EM>String</EM> must be in the  |
               form "@<STRONG>x</STRONG>,<STRONG>y</STRONG>", where <STRONG>x</STRONG> and <STRONG>y</STRONG> are the window  coordinates.  |
               If  the  given  screen  coordinates  do  not lie over a  |
               legend entry, the empty  string  is  returned.   for  a
               description of valid options.

          <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>postscript</STRONG> ?<EM>fileName</EM>? ?<EM>options</EM>...?
               Generates PostScript commands to print the graph. If no
               <EM>fileName</EM>  argument is present, the PostScript output is
               returned.  Otherwise,  <EM>fileName</EM>  is  created  and  will
               contain  the PostScript output.  In this case the empty
               string is returned.   If  any  <EM>option</EM>-<EM>value</EM>  pairs  are
               present, they set configuration options controlling how
               the PostScript is generated. See for a  description  of
               valid options.

          <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>psconfigure</STRONG> ?<EM>options</EM>...?
               Queries or  modifies  the  options  of  the  <STRONG>postscript</STRONG>
               command (see ).

               Reorders the tag display list  placing  the  first  tag
               specified   after  the  second.   If  no  second  <EM>tagId</EM>
               argument is specified, the tag is placed at the end  of
               the list.  This command can be used to control how tags
               are displayed since tags are drawn in the order of this
               display list.  The empty string is returned.

          <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>tag</STRONG> <STRONG>before</STRONG> <EM>tagId</EM> ?<EM>tagId</EM>?
               Reorders the tag display list  placing  the  first  tag
               specified  before  the  second.   If  no  second  <EM>tagId</EM>
               argument  is  specified,  the  tag  is  placed  at  the
               beginning  of  the  list.   This command can be used to
               control how tags are displayed since tags are drawn  in
               the  order  of  this display list.  The empty string is
               returned.

          <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>tag</STRONG> <STRONG>configure</STRONG> <EM>tagId</EM> ?<EM>options</EM>...?
               Queries or modifies the configuration  options  of  the
               particular   tag.   See  for  a  description  of  valid
               options.

          <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>tag</STRONG> <STRONG>coords</STRONG> <EM>tagId</EM> ?<EM>coords</EM>?
               Queries or resets the coordinates of the tag designated
               by  <EM>tagId</EM>.   If  <EM>coords</EM>  is  present,  it  is a list of
               coordinate pairs representing the points  of  the  tag.
               This  list  is  used  to  re-position  the tag.  If the
               <EM>coords</EM> argument is not present,  the  current  list  of
               coordinates for <EM>tagId</EM> is returned.

          <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>tag</STRONG> <STRONG>create</STRONG> <EM>type</EM> ?<EM>coords</EM>? ?<EM>options</EM>...?
               Creates a tag of the selected type. <EM>Type</EM> may be  either
               text,  line,  bitmap,  polygon, or window.  <EM>coords</EM> is a
               list of coordinate pairs of points used to position the
               tag.  See for a description of options are valid.  This
               command returns a unique tag identifier, which is  used
               as the <EM>tagId</EM> argument in other tag-related commands.

          <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>tag</STRONG> <STRONG>delete</STRONG> <EM>tagId</EM> ?<EM>tagId</EM>..?
               Deletes each  of  the  specified  tags.   This  command
               returns the empty string.

          <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>tag</STRONG> <STRONG>ids</STRONG> ?<EM>pattern</EM>?
               Returns a list of IDs of tags created.  If  <EM>pattern</EM>  is
               supplied, only those tags whose IDs matching it will be
               returned.

          <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>tag</STRONG> <STRONG>type</STRONG> <EM>tagId</EM>
               Returns the type of the tag given  by  <EM>tagId</EM>,  such  as
               Line or Text. If <EM>tagId</EM> is not a valid a tag identifier,
               the empty string is returned.


               Transforms   the   graph   coordinates   into    window  |
               coordinates,  by  mapping  the  <STRONG>x</STRONG> and <STRONG>y</STRONG> values onto the  |
               standard axes (x and y).  Returns a list containing the  |
               x  and  y  window  coordinates.  Please note that graph  |
               coordinates far outside  of  the  axis  range  are  not  |
               guarenteed to be accurate.

          <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>y2axis</STRONG> <STRONG>limits</STRONG>
               Returns a list of two  graph  coordinates  representing
               the  minimum  and  maximum  limits  of the x-axis.  The
               format of the list returned is min max.


     <STRONG>CONFIGURATION</STRONG> <STRONG>OPTIONS</STRONG>
        <STRONG>WIDGET</STRONG> <STRONG>OPTIONS</STRONG>
          The following widget options are  valid  for  the  <STRONG>configure</STRONG>
          command.

               <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>configure</STRONG> ?<EM>option</EM>? ?<EM>value</EM> <EM>option</EM> <EM>value</EM> ...?

</PRE>
<H2>9          The configure command queries or modifies the  configuration</H2><PRE>
          options of the widget.  If no <EM>option</EM> is specified, returns a
          list describing all of the available  options  for  <EM>pathName</EM>
          (see  <STRONG>Tk_ConfigureInfo</STRONG> for information on the format of this
          list). If <EM>option</EM>  is  specified  with  no  <EM>value</EM>,  then  the
          command returns a list describing the one named option (this
          list will be identical to the corresponding sublist  of  the
          value  returned  if no <EM>option</EM> is specified).  If one or more
          <EM>option</EM>-<EM>value</EM> pairs are specified, then the command  modifies
          the  given  widget  option(s) to have the given value(s); in
          this case the command returns the empty string.

          <STRONG>-bottommargin</STRONG> <EM>pixels</EM>
               Specifies the size of the margin from the  x-coordinate
               axis  to the bottom of the window.  The x-axis title is

               is less than one pixel, the the margin size is selected
               automatically.

          <STRONG>-bufferelements</STRONG> <EM>boolean</EM>
               Specifies whether to use a pixmap to cache the  display  |
               of  elements.  This is especially useful when there are  |
               many data points or the graph  is  redrawn  frequently.  |
               <STRONG>oolean</STRONG> is true <STRONG>by</STRONG> <STRONG>default.</STRONG>

               Specifies a Tcl command to be invoked  when  formatting



               arguments (the path name of the barchart widget and the
               numeric  value  of  the axis label) are appended to the
               end of the command.  The procedure value  should  be  a
               string  representing  the formatted label. If the value
               is the empty string or if <EM>prefix</EM> is the  empty  string,
               the  default axis label is displayed.  Please note that
               this procedure is invoked during  the  display  of  the
               graph.   Resetting  barchart configurations within this
               procedure can cause unexpected results.

          <STRONG>-descending</STRONG> <EM>boolean</EM>
               Specifies  whether  the  values  along  the  axis   are  |
               increasing  or decreasing. If <EM>boolean</EM> is true, the axis  |
               values will decrease.   By  default,  the  axis  values  |
               increase.

          <STRONG>-font</STRONG> <EM>fontName</EM>
               Specifies the font for axis labels. If  <EM>fontName</EM>  isn't
               specified  then it defaults to *-Courier-Bold-R-Normal-

          <STRONG>-logscale</STRONG> <EM>boolean</EM>
               Sets  the  scale  of  the   coordinate   axis   (either
               logarithmically  or linearly).  If <EM>boolean</EM> is true, the
               axis will be displayed in logarithmic  scale.   <EM>Boolean</EM>
               must   be  a  value  accepted  by  <STRONG>Tcl_GetBoolean</STRONG>.   By
               default, the scale is linear.

          <STRONG>-loose</STRONG> <EM>boolean</EM>
               Indicates that when auto-scaling  the  axis,  the  axis
               range  should fit loosely around the data points at the
               outer tick intervals. Otherwise  the  axis  range  fits
               tightly  at  the  limits  of  the  data  displayed.  By
               default, the range is tight.

          <STRONG>-mapped</STRONG> <EM>boolean</EM>
               Specifies if the axis should be displayed. By  default,  |
               the  standard axes are displayed (x and y), but not the  |
               alternate (x2 and y2).

          <STRONG>-max</STRONG> <EM>value</EM>
               Sets the  maximum  limit  of  the  axis.   Data  points
               exceeding  this  limit  are  clipped  at this value. If
               <EM>value</EM> is the empty string (the default),  the  axis  is
               auto-scaled  whereby  the  maximum  limit is determined



               Sets the minimum limit of the axis.  Data  points  less
               than this limit are clipped at this value.  If <EM>value</EM> is
               the empty string (the default), the axis is auto-scaled
               whereby  the  minimum limit is determined from the data
               points of the displayed elements.

          <STRONG>-rotate</STRONG> <EM>theta</EM>
               Specifies the rotation of the axis labels.  <EM>Theta</EM> is  a
               real  number  representing  the  angle  of  rotation in
               degrees.  The default rotation is 0.0 degrees.

          <STRONG>-showticks</STRONG> <EM>boolean</EM>
               Indicates if axis ticks should be displayed. If <EM>boolean</EM>
               is true (the default), ticks are displayed.

          <STRONG>-stepsize</STRONG> <EM>value</EM>
               Sets the step size between  major  axis  ticks.   <EM>Value</EM>
               must be greater than zero and less than the axis range,
               or the requested step size is ignored and the step size
               is automatically calculated based upon the element data
               points.

          <STRONG>-subticks</STRONG> <EM>number</EM>
               Sets the number of minor axis ticks  to  be  displayed.
               By  default, the number of minor ticks is 5.  If <EM>number</EM>
               is zero, no subticks will be displayed.

          <STRONG>-ticklength</STRONG> <EM>pixels</EM>
               Sets the length of the ticks and subticks (subticks are  |
               one-half  <EM>pixels)</EM>.   If  <EM>pixels</EM> is negative, ticks will  |
               point towards the plot, instead of away from  it.   The  |
               tick length is 0.1i.

          <STRONG>-title</STRONG> <EM>string</EM>
               Sets the title of the axis.  If  <EM>string</EM>  is  the  empty

               example,  if  <EM>anchorPos</EM>  is  center  then the legend is
               centered on the point;  if  <EM>anchorPos</EM>  is  n  then  the
               legend  will be drawn such that the top center point of
               the rectangular region occupied by the legend  will  be
               at  the  positioning  point.   This  option defaults to
               center.

          <STRONG>-background</STRONG> <EM>color</EM>
               Sets the background color of the legend.  If  <EM>color</EM>  is

               drawn.

          <STRONG>-borderwidth</STRONG> <EM>pixels</EM>
               Sets the width of the 3-D border  to  draw  around  the
               outside  of  the legend (if such border is being drawn;
               the <STRONG>relief</STRONG> option determines this).  By default is  the
               legend border width is 2.

          <STRONG>-font</STRONG> <EM>fontName</EM>
               <EM>FontName</EM> specifies a  font  to  use  when  drawing  the
               labels of each element into the legend.  If this option
               isn't specified then it defaults  to  *-Helvetica-Bold-
               R-Normal-*-120-*.

          <STRONG>-foreground</STRONG> <EM>color</EM>
               Sets the foreground color of the element labels in  the
               legend.   If  this  option  isn't  specified,  then  it
               defaults to black.

          <STRONG>-ipadx</STRONG> <EM>pixels</EM>
               Sets the internal padding to the width of  the  legend.  |
               Padding  will  be  added to both the left and right and  |
               between the elements symbol and label.  By  default  is  |
               the legend border width is 2.

          <STRONG>-ipady</STRONG> <EM>pixels</EM>
               Sets the internal padding to the height of the  legend.  |
               Padding  will  be  added to both the top and bottom and  |
               between the elements labels.  By default is the  legend  |

          <STRONG>-mapped</STRONG> <EM>boolean</EM>
               Indicates if the legend should be displayed. If <EM>boolean</EM>
               is true (the default), the legend will be mapped.

          <STRONG>-position</STRONG> <EM>string</EM>
               Sets the positioning point  of  the  legend  in  window
               coordinates.   This  option  in  conjunction  with  the
               <STRONG>-anchor</STRONG>  option,  determines  where   the   legend   is
               positioned. The format of <EM>string</EM> is "@<STRONG>x</STRONG>,<STRONG>y</STRONG>", where <STRONG>x</STRONG> and
               <STRONG>y</STRONG> are the window coordinate values.  If <EM>string</EM>  is  the
               empty   string   (the  default),  the  legend  will  be
               displayed in the right margin (which  is  automatically
               extended to accommodate the legend).

          <STRONG>-relief</STRONG> <EM>string</EM>
               Specifies  the  3-D  effect  desired  for  the  legend.
               <EM>String</EM>  must  be in a form accepted by <STRONG>Tk_GetRelief</STRONG>. It
               indicates how  the interior of the legend should appear
               relative  to  the  graph; for example, raised means the
               legend  should  appear  to  protrude  from  the  graph,
               relative  to the surface of the graph.  By default, the
               legend relief is sunken.

          After the  coordinate  list  there  may  be  any  number  of
          <EM>option</EM>-<EM>value</EM>   pairs,   each   of  which  sets  one  of  the
          configuration options for the tag.  These same  <EM>option</EM>-<EM>value</EM>
          pairs may be used in the <STRONG>tag</STRONG> <STRONG>configure</STRONG> command to change the
          tag's configuration.  The following  options  are  supported
          for text tags:

          <STRONG>-anchor</STRONG> <EM>anchorPos</EM>
               <EM>AnchorPos</EM> tells how to position the  text  relative  to
               the  positioning point for the text; it may have any of
               the forms accepted by <STRONG>Tk_GetAnchor</STRONG>.   For  example,  if
               <EM>anchorPos</EM>  is  center  then the text is centered on the
               point; if <EM>anchorPos</EM> is n then the text  will  be  drawn
               such  that  the  top  center  point  of the rectangular
               region occupied by the text will be at the  positioning
               point.  This option defaults to center.

          <STRONG>-background</STRONG> <EM>color</EM>
               Sets the background color of the text string. If  <EM>color</EM>
               is   the   empty   string,   the   background  will  be
               transparent.  If this option isn't  specified  then  it
               defaults to white.

          <STRONG>-font</STRONG> <EM>fontName</EM>
               Specifies  the  text  font.   If  this   option   isn't
               specified,   it  defaults  *-Helvetica-Bold-R-Normal-*-
               120-*.

          <STRONG>-foreground</STRONG> <EM>color</EM>
               Sets the foreground color of the text. If  this  option
               isn't specified then it defaults to black.

          <STRONG>-element</STRONG> <EM>name</EM>
               Associates the tag with the element <EM>name</EM>.  If  <EM>name</EM>  is
               not   the  empty  string  (the  default),  the  tag  is
               displayed only if <EM>name</EM> exists and  is  currently  being

               rotation is 0.0 degrees.

          <STRONG>-text</STRONG> <EM>string</EM>
               Sets the text string.  The exact way in which the  text
               string  is  displayed  may be affected by other options
               such as <STRONG>-anchor</STRONG> or <STRONG>-rotate</STRONG>.  This  option  defaults  to
               the empty string.

          <STRONG>-xoffset</STRONG> <EM>pixels</EM>
               Specifies a x-coordinate offset (in window coordinates)
               from the specified position.

          <STRONG>-yoffset</STRONG> <EM>pixels</EM>
               Specifies a y-coordinate offset (in window coordinates)
               from the specified position.


        <STRONG>LINE</STRONG> <STRONG>TAGS</STRONG>
          A line tag displays one or more connected line  segments  on
          the  graph.   Line  tags are created with widget commands in
          the form:

               <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>tag</STRONG> <STRONG>create</STRONG> <STRONG>line</STRONG> ?<EM>coords</EM>? ?<EM>options</EM>...?
9          The argument <EM>coords</EM> specifies a list of numeric  expressions
          representing  the  graph  coordinate  pairs  of  the  points
          connecting the line.

          After the <EM>coords</EM> there may be  any  number  of  <EM>option</EM>-<EM>value</EM>
          pairs,  each  of which sets one of the configuration options
          for the tag.  These same <EM>option</EM>-<EM>value</EM> pairs may be  used  in
          the <STRONG>tag</STRONG> <STRONG>configure</STRONG> command to change the tag's configuration.
          The following options are supported for line tags:

          <STRONG>-background</STRONG> <EM>color</EM>
               Sets the background color of the  line.   The  is  only
               meaningful  when used with the <STRONG>-stipple</STRONG> option. If this
               option isn't specified then it defaults to white.

          <STRONG>-dashes</STRONG> <EM>dashes</EM>
               Sets the dash style of the line. <EM>Dashes</EM> is  the  number
               of  alternatingly displayed pixels. If <EM>dashes</EM> is 0 (the
               default), the tag will be drawn as a solid line.

          <STRONG>-linewidth</STRONG> <EM>pixels</EM>
               Sets the width of the lines.  The default width is 0.

          <STRONG>-mapx</STRONG> <EM>type</EM>
               Specifies which x-axis to map the  tag's  x-coordinates  |
               onto.  <EM>Type</EM> must be either x, x2, or both.  The default  |
               axis is x.

          <STRONG>-mapy</STRONG> <EM>type</EM>
               Specifies which y-axis to map the  tag's  y-coordinates  |
               onto.  <EM>Type</EM> must be either y, y2, or both.  The default  |
               axis is y.

          <STRONG>-stipple</STRONG> <EM>bitmap</EM>
               Indicates that the line should be drawn with a stippled
               pattern rather than solid; <EM>bitmap</EM> specifies the stipple
               pattern to use, may be in any of the forms accepted  by
               <STRONG>Tk_GetBitmap</STRONG>.   If  <EM>bitmap</EM>  is  the  empty  string (the
               default) then the line is drawn in a solid fashion.

          <STRONG>-xoffset</STRONG> <EM>pixels</EM>
               Specifies an offset in the x-coordinate  direction  (in
               window  coordinates)  from the specified position.  The
               default offset ifs 0.

          <STRONG>-yoffset</STRONG> <EM>pixels</EM>
               Specifies an offset in the y-coordinate  direction  (in
               window  coordinates)  from the specified position.  The
               default offset ifs 0.


        <STRONG>BITMAP</STRONG> <STRONG>TAGS</STRONG>
          A bitmap tag displays a bitmap on the  graph.   Bitmap  tags
          are created with widget commands in the form:

               <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>tag</STRONG> <STRONG>create</STRONG> <STRONG>bitmap</STRONG> ?<EM>coords</EM>? ?<EM>options</EM>...?
9          The argument <EM>coords</EM> specifies a list  containing  the  graph
          coordinates  of  a  point used to position the bitmap on the
          display.  After the coordinate list there may be any  number
          of  <EM>option</EM>-<EM>value</EM>  pairs,  each  of  which  sets  one  of the
          configuration options for the tag.  These same  <EM>option</EM>-<EM>value</EM>
          pairs may be used in the <STRONG>tag</STRONG> <STRONG>configure</STRONG> command to change the

               forms accepted by <STRONG>Tk_GetBitmap</STRONG>.  If <EM>bitmap</EM> is the empty
               string (the default), then the polygon is filled with a
               solid (foreground) color.

          <STRONG>-xoffset</STRONG> <EM>pixels</EM>
               Specifies   an   x-coordinate   offset    (in    window
               coordinates)  from  the specified position. The default
               offset is 0.

          <STRONG>-yoffset</STRONG> <EM>pixels</EM>
               Specifies a y-coordinate offset (in window coordinates)
               from the specified position. The default is offset 0.


        <STRONG>WINDOW</STRONG> <STRONG>TAGS</STRONG>
          A window  tag  displays  a  particular  window  at  a  given
          position  on  the  graph.   Window tags are created with the
          widget command:

               <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>tag</STRONG> <STRONG>create</STRONG> <STRONG>window</STRONG> ?<EM>coords</EM>? ?<EM>options</EM>...?
9          The argument <EM>coords</EM> specifies a list  containing  the  graph
          coordinates  of  a  point used to position the window on the
          display After <EM>coords</EM>, there may be  any  number  of  <EM>option</EM>-
          <EM>value</EM>  pairs,  each  of  which sets one of the configuration
          options for the tag.  These same <EM>option</EM>-<EM>value</EM> pairs  may  be
          used  in  the  <STRONG>tag</STRONG>  <STRONG>configure</STRONG>  command  to  change the tag's
          configuration.  The  following  options  are  supported  for
          window tags:

          <STRONG>-anchor</STRONG> <EM>anchorPos</EM>
               <EM>AnchorPos</EM> tells how to position the window relative  to
               the  positioning point for the window;  it may have any
               of the forms accepted by <STRONG>Tk_GetAnchor</STRONG>.  For example, if
               <EM>anchorPos</EM>  is center then the window is centered on the
               point;  if <EM>anchorPos</EM> is  n  then  the  window  will  be
               displayed  such  that  the  top  center  point  of  the
               rectangular region occupied by the window  will  be  at
               the positioning point.  This option defaults to center.

               axis is y.

          <STRONG>-width</STRONG> <EM>pixels</EM>
               Specifies the width to assign to the tag's window.   If
               this  option  isn't specified, or if it is specified as
               the empty string, then the  window  is  given  whatever
               width it requests internally.

          <STRONG>-window</STRONG> <EM>pathName</EM>
               Specifies the window to be managed by the  graph.   The
               window  specified  by  <EM>pathName</EM>  must be a child of the
               <STRONG>blt_barchart</STRONG> widget.

          <STRONG>-xoffset</STRONG> <EM>pixels</EM>
               Specifies   an   x-coordinate   offset    (in    window
               coordinates)  from  the specified position. The default
               offset is 0.

          <STRONG>-yoffset</STRONG> <EM>pixels</EM>
               Specifies a y-coordinate offset (in window coordinates)

          <STRONG>-colormode</STRONG> <EM>mode</EM>
               Specifies how to output color information.   <EM>Mode</EM>  must
               be  either <STRONG>color</STRONG> (for full color output), gray (convert
               all colors to their  gray-scale  equivalents)  or  mono
               (convert  foreground  colors  to  black  and background
               colors to white).  The default mode is color.

          <STRONG>-fontmap</STRONG> <EM>varName</EM>
               <EM>VarName</EM> must be the name of  a  global  array  variable
               that  specifies  a font mapping from the X font name to
               PostScript.  Each element of <EM>varName</EM> must consist of  a
               Tcl  list  with one or two elements, which are the name
               and point size of a PostScript font.   When  outputting
               PostScript commands for a particular font, Tk checks to
               see if <EM>varName</EM> contains an element with the  same  name
               as  the  specified  font.  If there is such an element,
               then the font information contained in that element  is
               used  in  the PostScript output.  (If the point size is
               omitted from the list, the point size of the X font  is
               used).   Otherwise the X font is examined in an attempt
               to guess what PostScript font to use.  This works  only
               for  fonts  whose  foundry  property  is <EM>Adobe</EM> (such as
               Times, Helvetica, Courier, etc.).  If all of this fails
               then the font defaults to Helvetica-Bold.

          <STRONG>-landscape</STRONG> <EM>boolean</EM>
               If <EM>boolean</EM> is true, this specifies the printed area  is
               to  be rotated 90 degrees.  In non-rotated output the <STRONG>x</STRONG>
               axis of the printed area runs along the short dimension
               of  the  page  (``portrait''  orientation);  in rotated
               output the <STRONG>x</STRONG> axis runs along the long dimension of  the
               page (``landscape'' orientation).  Defaults to false.

          <STRONG>-pageanchor</STRONG> <EM>anchor</EM>
               Specifies which point of the  printed  area  should  be
               appear over the positioning point on the page (which is
               given by the <STRONG>-pagex</STRONG> and <STRONG>-pagey</STRONG> options).  For  example,
               <STRONG>-pageanchor</STRONG>  <STRONG>n</STRONG> means that the top center of the printed

               Specifies  that  the  width  of  the  graph  drawn   in
               PostScript.   The  graph  is <EM>not</EM> uniformly scaled since
               this also scales the fonts.   <EM>Size</EM>  may  be  any  value
               accepted by <STRONG>Tk_GetPixels</STRONG>.  The resulting pixel value is
               then converted  to  postscript  printer  points.   This
               means  that  a width <EM>6.5i</EM> will be properly converted to
               6.5 inches. This options defaults to the width  of  the
               graph window.

          <STRONG>-pagex</STRONG> <EM>position</EM>
               Specifies the  x-coordinate  of  the  page  positioning
               point.   This  (with  the <STRONG>-pageanchor</STRONG> option) indicates
               where the graph  is  placed  on  the  PostScript  page.
               <EM>Position</EM> may be any value accepted by <STRONG>Tk_GetPixels</STRONG>. The
               resulting pixel value is then converted  to  postscript
               printer points.  The default is 1i.

          <STRONG>-pagey</STRONG> <EM>position</EM>
               Specifies the  y-coordinate  of  the  page  positioning
               point.   This  (with  the <STRONG>-pageanchor</STRONG> option) indicates
               where the graph  is  placed  on  the  PostScript  page.
               <EM>Position</EM> may be any value accepted by <STRONG>Tk_GetPixels</STRONG>. The
               resulting pixel value is then converted  to  postscript
               printer points.  The default is 1i.

     <STRONG>BINDINGS</STRONG>
          There are no default bindings.

     <STRONG>BUGS</STRONG>
          Auto-scale routines do not use requested min/max  limits  as
          boundaries when the axis is logarithmically scaled.

          The needs to be a special mapping for  undefined  log  scale
          values  (&gt;=  0.0). Possibly set up a "red zone" of undefined
          values which divides the positive and negative values.

          The PostScript output generated for polygons with more  than
          1500  points  may  exceed  the  limits of some printers (See
