From "Mathematical Reviews Database" (MathSciNet web site):
http://www.ams.org/mr-database

Mathematical Reviews (MR) and Zentralblatt MATH (Zbl) cooperate in 
maintaining the Mathematics Subject Classification (MSC) which is used 
by these reviewing services and others to categorize items in the 
mathematical sciences literature. The current version, MSC2000, is being 
revised for use in 2010. MR and Zbl welcome community input into this 
revision process. Comments can be submitted through the classification 
feedback form 
http://www.msc2010.org/msc-feedback.php 
or by email to feedback@msc2010.org  . This input will be of great value 
as the process moves forward.

CALL FOR NOMINATIONS
SIAG/APDE Prize

The SIAM Activity Group on Analysis of Partial Differential Equations 
(SIAG/APDE) will present the SIAG/APDE Prize at the SIAM Conference on 
Analysis of PDE (PD07) to be held December 10-12, 2007, in Mesa, 
Arizona.

The SIAG/APDE Prize, established in 2005, is awarded to the author(s) of 
the most outstanding paper on a topic in PDE published in English in a 
peer-reviewed journal within the four calendar years preceding the year 
of the award.  A candidate paper must bear a publication date between 
January 1, 2003, and December 31, 2006.  It must contain significant 
research contributions to the field of analysis of PDE, as commonly 
defined in the mathematical literature, with direct or potential 
applications.

The award will consist of a plaque and a certificate containing the 
award citation.  At least one of the awardees is expected to attend the 
award ceremony and to present the paper as a plenary lecture at the 
meeting.  Travel expenses will be available to reimburse one speaker.

Nominations should include a full bibliographic citation for the paper 
and a brief statement outlining the justification for the nomination in 
terms of its importance and impact.  Nominations should be addressed to 
Professor Mary Pugh, Chair, SIAG/APDE Prize Committee and sent by May 
15, 2007 to J. M. Littleton at littleton@siam.org .  Inquiries should be 
addressed to littleton@siam.org .  Complete calls for nominations for 
SIAM prizes can be found at www.siam.org/prizes/nominations.php .

Topic #12  -----------   OP-SF NET 14.2  -----------  March 15, 2007
                         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
From: OP-SF NET Editors
Subject: About the Activity Group

The SIAM Activity Group on Orthogonal Polynomials and Special Functions
consists of a broad set of mathematicians, both pure and applied.  The
Group also includes engineers and scientists, students as well as
experts. We have around 140 members scattered about in more than 20
countries. Whatever your specialty might be, we welcome your
participation in this classical, and yet modern, topic.  Our WWW home
page is:

  http://math.nist.gov/opsf/

This is a convenient point of entry to all the services provided by the
Group.  Our Webmaster is Bonita Saunders (bonita.saunders@nist.gov).

The Activity Group sponsors OP-SF NET, which is transmitted periodically
by SIAM.  It is provided as a free public service;  membership in SIAM
is not required.  The OP-SF Net Editors are Diego Dominici
(dominicd@newpaltz.edu) and Martin Muldoon (muldoon@yorku.ca).

To receive the OP-SF NET, send your name and email address to
poly-request@siam.org .

Back issues can be obtained at the WWW addresses:

  http://cio.nist.gov/esd/emaildir/lists/opsfnet/maillist.html

For several years the Activity Group sponsored a printed Newsletter,
most recently edited by Rafael Yanez. Back issues are accessible at:

http://www.mathematik.uni-kassel.de/~koepf/siam.html

Given the widespread availability of email and the Internet, the need for
the printed Newsletter has decreased. Discussions are underway concerning
whether an annual printed Newsletter or Annual Report should be
instituted.

SIAM has several categories of membership, including low-cost categories
for students and residents of developing countries.  For current
information on SIAM and Activity Group membership, contact:
