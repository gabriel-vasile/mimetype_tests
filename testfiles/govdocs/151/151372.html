      <p align="justify" class="style1">First off, let me say these  are my views and not necessarily shared by other family members. Governor Frank  Steunenberg was a loved and respected member of our family who was brutally  murdered and even today the emotional scars and disagreements remain from those  events of 100+ years ago. I was obviously not around at that time but am  forever linked through the documented record of history and the even stronger  links of our family. To give a little perspective on where I am in the family chain,  my grandfather was Julian Steunenberg, eldest son of the governor who was home  from college for the holidays at the time of his father&rsquo;s assassination on  December 30th, 1905. Julian later testified briefly at the trial regarding  Orchard&rsquo;s presence in Caldwell.  Orchard had seen the young Steunenberg in town and under the guise of having an  interest in purchasing sheep inquired about the whereabouts of his father. I  believe Julian/my grandfather carried the scar of that conversation throughout  life and to his grave. My mother is eighty-nine years young Brenda Steunenberg  Richards, youngest child of Julian and Francis Steunenberg. She was born in Caldwell and along with my father John Sr. resides not far  from me here in San Luis Obispo County,   CA. </p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1">As an amateur historian I try  to separate myself as much as possible from the personal biases and emotions in  an attempt to be as objective and as factual as possible when researching these  events. Sometimes I am successful in that regard and at other times I am not. Now  over a hundred years later the events still trigger debate among our family as  they do among all those with an interest in law, labor and the history of the  west. My historical studies, my views and my biases are all reflected in the  following comments.</p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1">Before I get to the verdict,  let me say up front that I believe Harry Orchard was generally truthful in his confession.  I have read the original confession given to James McParland; the Harper&rsquo;s  magazine published version, Orchard&rsquo;s book <em>The  Man God Made Again</em> and many associated accounts, documents and opinions.      There may have been details  that were tainted, enhanced or left out but in general I believe he was telling  the truth. Did Orchard confess due to the influence of James McParland or to save  his neck or because of a religious conversion?&nbsp;  Probably all of the above but that doesn&rsquo;t change the basic facts that he  was the bomb maker that murdered my great grandfather and Haywood along with  Petibone and Moyer were co-conspirators. Haywood was certainly the most radical  of the group and espoused violent tactics throughout his involvement in the  labor movement. Even Darrow, a firm supporter of labor but with just as firm a  belief in non-violence, found it difficult to reconcile the vastly differing  viewpoints that existed between himself and Haywood. </p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1">In terms of Orchard&rsquo;s much  debated religious conversion and whether it was genuine or contrived&ndash;I have  always viewed it as a moot point as he will be judged by a far greater entity  then this mere mortal. Perhaps it was Charles &ldquo;Pete&rdquo; Steunenberg, brother of the  fallen governor, who found the perfect blend of religion and punishment. Pete said  something to the effect that if Harry Orchard had found religion then the sure  fire way to guarantee he kept it was to keep him right there in the Idaho penitentiary! His letter  published in the Idaho Statesmen raised a pubic outcry and served to snuff out  a near successful attempt by Gooding, Hawley and others to obtain Orchard&rsquo;s  release.</p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1">One matter on which much of  our family probably does agree is the post-trial treatment of Orchard during the  long years he spent at the Idaho  penitentiary. He became a trusty, had his own cabin outside the prison walls,  was given freedom to roam about as he pleased and was photographed with  governors and their children and grandchildren. As he grew older, Orchard was written  about and pictured in the press as the nice old grandfatherly type. I cannot  think of any mass murderer ever receiving such favorable treatment in the  history of the American prison system! One can argue whether Orchard should or  should not have swung from the gallows but to go from a wanted poster to a poster  child for Idaho  was and is a tough pill to swallow for our family and friends. Frank  Steunenberg never had his opportunity to grow old or to enjoy being a  grandfather to my mother Brenda or his other grandchildren. Were it not for  that dastardly deed of Harry Orchard on the evening of December 30th  1905, he would have most likely lived to see some of his great grandchildren&ndash;perhaps  even this one.</p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1">All the above being said, the  verdict finding Haywood not guilty was the only verdict that the jury could reach  under the then and still existing law in Idaho.  I am not a lawyer but I believe Judge Byron Johnson and I agree on this matter.  As a side note, I would like to thank Byron for spending some time with me back  in March 2007 during my visit to Boise  and Idaho Public Television (IPTV) for inviting me to make an  appearance on their program &ldquo;The Trial of the Century.&rdquo; Hopefully Byron and I  might someday have an opportunity to discuss the ethics 
        of one Clarence Darrow. But  alas, I cannot pick on just Darrow as ethical considerations were not a very high  priority in those days and there were few among the defense or prosecution  teams, the camps of labor and capital or in Idaho State Government that were  not tainted in some way by questionable practices. Byron would be pleased to  know that my recent readings have focused a great deal on his hero Darrow and I  have mellowed a bit in my views.</p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1">The &ldquo;not guilty&rdquo; verdict in  the Haywood trial was not an O.J. Simpson moment in history. This was NOT jury  nullification and there was no evident tampering or payoffs (not to say that  such efforts weren&rsquo;t made). This trial was essentially over before it started when  Steve Adams recanted his confession as that would have served as the legally  required corroboration of Orchard&rsquo;s testimony. Without Adams  it is questionable if the trial should have even gone forward. If the case had  been of lesser importance and without the accompanying publicity it probably  would have been tossed out by Judge Fremont Wood. </p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1">Just like with the jury in that  Boise courtroom in 1907, the law was also  carried out as best it could be by Governor Steunenberg during 1899 in the Coeur d&rsquo;Alene. Neither  instance was without controversy. Influence pedaling, payoffs and questionable  ethical procedures were evident on all sides. Idaho was a young state and we must evaluate  these events against the law, the politics and the ethical guidelines (or lack  thereof) that existed at the time and not the standards and law practices that  exist today. </p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1">My great grandfather&rsquo;s murder  was a brutal senseless killing as were all those carried out by &ldquo;dynamite&rdquo;  Harry Orchard. Orchard&rsquo;s use of explosives as a terrorist tactic in the late  1800&rsquo;s and early 1900&rsquo;s provides an historical lesson that remains all too real  and applicable well over a century later. I grieve not only over the cold  bloodied murder of my family member&ndash;but for all of the death, mistreatment and  suffering inflicted upon miners and other members of the so-called working  class. </p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1">In July of 1907 twelve Idaho citizens, mostly farmers,  withstood the greatest media blitz of the times and came back with the only  verdict they could under the law. It certainly would have been easier and more popular  in their home state to have done otherwise. Ultimately, even though found not  guilty, the violent tactics of Big Bill Haywood were exposed and his influence  diminished. Years later he would flee to Russia,  a fugitive from the very justice system that had served him so well in that Boise courtroom.      </p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1">If Haywood had been found  guilty and hanged, he would have become a martyr and a spark for further violence  in Idaho and  around the country. Governor Steunenberg died a martyr for law and order in 1905&ndash;a  direct result of the murderous and revengeful views espoused by Big Bill Haywood.  The processes, 
        legal procedures and  resources in place at the time weren&rsquo;t always perfect and all sides suffered and  made mistakes&ndash;but the decisions of Governor Steunenberg in 1899 and that Idaho jury in 1907 had  to be made. In the end I believe each made the right decision and that the Governor  would have felt proud that twelve fellow citizens followed the law&hellip;in that jury  room&hellip;on July 28, 1907&hellip;in his beloved state of Idaho.</p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1">We cannot envision where we  are going in our future unless we first look back at where we have been in our  history. The suffering on all sides of the battle between labor and capital was  intolerable by any standard of decency&ndash;but perhaps unavoidable at a time when  law and order in the West was still in its infancy. A small number of greedy  mine owners and zealous labor leaders took advantage of a group of miners who  merely wished to make a reasonable, respectable and safe living for themselves  and their families. Instead they became the pawns in a bloody battle that cost  many their lives and resulted in the revenge assassination of a resolute  governor that believed in the necessity of establishing and maintaining law and  order. None, the governor included, could claim sainthood&ndash;but all were the victims  of a minority few who were driven by power, greed and violence. </p>
      <div align="justify"><span class="style1">It has now been one hundred years since the end of the  Haywood trial. We cannot stand immune from the events of 1899-1907 as evidenced  by the subsequent periods of labor unrest and violence that have occurred in the  decades following that verdict on July 28th, 1907. Such clashes shall  continue in the future if we allow greed in the boardrooms and legislative  halls to prevail, the gap between rich and poor to grow, the flames of ethnic  discontent to be fanned&ndash;and we fail to heed the historical lessons from a century  ago in the state Idaho.</span></div></td>
