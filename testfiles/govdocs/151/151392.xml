<descript>
<abstract>This data set consists of digital data describing wetland and upland habitats in the coastal or near Gulf Coast areas of Louisiana, in 1978.  The data set includes 250 7.5' quadrangles which were mosaicked and photo-interepreted at Coastal Environment Inc., Baton Rouge, from 1:65,000 aerial photography; the photo-interpreted mosiacs 1:24,000 quads were digitized by the U.S. Geological Survey, National Wetlands Research Center (NWRC) using the Wetland Analytical Mapping System (WAMS).  Wetlands were classified according on the NWI maps using the Cowardin, et al., wetland classification scheme to the level of salinity modifiers.  Uplands were classified using an earlier Anderson Level 1 classification scheme.</abstract>
<purpose>The intended use of this data set is to provide historical information for comparison to monitor wetland trends over time. A DIRECT OVERLAY ANALYSIS OF THE DATA WITH ANOTHER DATA SET OF THE SAME AREA SHOULD NOT BE PERFORMED.</purpose>

<accconst>It is strongly recommended that this data is directly acquired from the distributor described above or from another USGS Biological Resources Division server and not indirectly through other sources which may have changed the data in some way.  The distributor makes no claims as to the data's suitability for other purposes.</accconst>
<useconst>Due to the processes used to create this data set, do not overlay the data with another data set for the same area. Obliqueness of the photography and its non correction will produce skew results. Acknowledgement of the U.S. Geological Survey, National Wetlands Research Center as a data source would be appreciated in products developed from these data, and such acknowledgment as is standard for citation and legal practices for data source is expected by users of this data. Sharing new data layers developed directly from these data would also be appreciated by U.S. Geological Survey, National Wetlands Research Center staff. Users should be aware that comparison with other data sets for the same area from other time periods may be inaccurate due to inconsistencies resulting from changes in mapping conventions, data collection, and computer processes over time. The distributor shall not be liable for improper or incorrect use of this data, based on the description of appropriate/inappropriate uses described in this metadata document.  These data are not legal documents and are not to be used as such.</useconst>

<attraccr>No attribute accuracy was performed during the  data development and completion phases. Attribute accuracy was tested during the data digitizing phase.  Data was tested by manual comparison of the source with hard copy printouts and/or symbolized display of the digital wetlands data on an interactive computer graphic system. In addition, WAMS software tests the attributes.  Overall, the attribute accuracy is believed high due to the multiple error-checking steps done redundantly during processing.  Process testing was done on the multiple staff error-checking steps and software error-checking steps to develop estimates of the accuracy and error rates.  The final accuracy assessment used calculated average accuracy and error rates for the human stages and software verification stages, which were done redundantly to insure double checking verification of the data coverages comprising the data set.  Exact tolerances vary with coverages, as does the date of the processing and testing.  The final accuracy values expressed are the best summation which can be developed from the smaller areas which comprise the data set.  The actual final should be considered as average and perhaps conservative or over estimating the percent change of error for areas in this data set.</attraccr>

<logic>This logical consistency report includes information about both general and specific topological tests and data generation dynamics in the fidelity of data.  Data is inherently polygonal.  Polygons intersecting the neatline are closed along the border.  Segments making up the outer and inner boundaries of a polygon tie end-to-end to completely enclose the area.  Line segments are a set of sequentially numbered coordinate pairs.  No duplicate features exist nor duplicate points in a data string.  Intersecting lines are separated into individual line segments at the points of intersection.  Point data are represented by two sets of coordinate pairs, each with the same coordinate values.  All nodes are represented by a single coordinate pair which indicates the beginning or end of a line segment.  The neatline for each quad is generated by connecting four corners of a digital file, as established during initialization of the digital file.  All data crossing the neatline are clipped to the neatline and data within a specified tolerance of the neatline are snapped to the neatline.  Tests for logical consistency are performed by WAMS verification software.</logic>
<complete>All photo-interpretable wetlands are identified and mapped using standard methodologies and equipment for the photo interpretation phases of the data development.  However, due to the mosaicking process used to create the maps, there are internal distortions. The corner coordinates, using WAMS, have been properly registered; the features within the 1:24,000 are not properly registered. A direct overlay comparison will result in inaccuracies; features will not registered on known features from another data set for the same area.</complete>
<posacc>
<horizpa>
<horizpar>For reference points accuracy, the accuracy for the digital data are tested by visual comparison of the source with hard copy maps, and by understanding of the hardware tolerances and processing values reported by the software used in data development.  Additional checks on comparison were possible when georeferencing/rectification was done using the USGS maps, which cite National Mapping Accuracy Standard compliance.</horizpar>

<attrdef>The wetland classification system is hierarchical, with wetlands and deepwater habitats divided among 5 major systems at the broadest level.  The five systems include Marine, Estuarine, Riverine, lacustrine, and Palustrine.  These systems are further divided into subsystems which reflect hydrologic conditions.  Below the subsystems are classes and subclasses describing vegetation or substrate, and modifiers relating to hydrology, soils, water chemistry, and man's activities.</attrdef>
