<attraccr>Interpreted photos were quality checked by two photointerpreters for attribute classification. Field verification was performed for chosen areas of the study. The mylar based maps were checked by cartographic personnel for line and labelworks, following mapping conventions and standards. The digital attribute accuracy is tested by manually comparing hard copy plots of the data with source materials. When attributes cannot be visually verified on plots, they are interactively queried and verified on screen. In addition, the attributes are compared against a master set of valid attributes.</attraccr>
</attracc>
<logic>ARC/INFO software is used to create and maintain topological relationships between features. There are no duplicate features. Polygonal features begin and end at the same point, contain no overshoots or undershoots, and contain one label. Linear features are continuous where appropriate,i.e., dangling arcs are removed if they are not required.</logic>
<complete>For cartographic process, accordance with nationally accepted mapping standards and conventions were followed. Processing of digital data follows conventions and standard methodologies for the time period and within limitations of available workstation equipment at the date of data development.</complete>

<procstep>
<procdesc>Aerial photography was acquired for the project area. Following a ground truthing exercise, the photos were then interpreted according to their wetland habitats; a Bausch Lomb stereoscope was using for the photointerpretation process at a 10x magnification.  The delineated data was then transferred to base maps using a Zoom Transfer Scope; this process removes any distortion from the image.  In all of these processes, the product is throughly scrutinized using standard operating procedures for quality control and assessment. The mylar overlays were then digitized using an Altek Datatab digitizer. Four control points corresponding to the four corners of the quadrangle were used for registration during data collection. Cover type features continuing onto adjacent quadrangles were adjusted to intersect the quad boundary at a commom, coincident node. Attributes were assigned during either the digitizing or editing stages.</procdesc>

<attrdef>The wetland classification system is hierarchical, with wetlands and deepwater habitat divided among 5 major systems at the broadest level.  The five systems include Marine, Estarine, Riverine, Lacustrine, and Palustrine.  These systems are further divided into sybsytems which reflect hydrologic conditions.  Below the subsystems are classes and subclasses describing vegetation or substrate, and modifiers relating to hydrology, soils, water chemistry, and man&apos;s activities.</attrdef>
