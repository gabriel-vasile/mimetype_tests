				<br><H1>American Colonial Life in the Late 1700s: Distant Cousins</H1>
				<H3>Introduction</H3><P><SPAN CLASS="content">Life in the thirteen original British 
colonies was very different than it is today. In this lesson, students will explore 
daily life and its influences in the late 1700s for two families in different 
colonies—Delaware and Massachusetts. Students will become historical detectives 
and learn to gather information from artifacts and make inferences about the lives 
and times they represent. They will then use what they have learned to write historical 
fiction in the form of friendly letters between fictitious cousins in Massachusetts 
and Delaware.</SPAN></P><H3>Guiding Question:</H3><P><SPAN CLASS="content">What 
was life like for people living in the original thirteen British colonies during 
the late 1700s? How and why did life differ for families in different areas? How 
did life in the colonies influence the lives we lead today? </SPAN></P><H3>Learning 
Objectives</H3><P><SPAN CLASS="content">After completing these activities, students 
will be able to:</SPAN></P><UL><LI>Identify the original thirteen British colonies 
on a map </LI><LI>Understand how physical geography affected settlement </LI><LI>Understand 
how settlers' backgrounds influenced their values, priorities, and daily lives 
</LI><LI>Examine artifacts and make inferences about the people and the historical 
periods that they represent </LI><LI>Imagine typical daily life for different 
families in colonial America in the late 1700s </LI><LI>Write a letter from the 
viewpoint of someone who lived in a different time and place</LI></UL>

<a name="PREPARING"></a><H3>Preparing 
to Teach this Lesson</H3><P><SPAN CLASS="content">First, read the entire lesson 
to get a sense of the content involved. You should be familiar with core facts 
about colonial life in various regions. See key ideas listed within individual 
activities below. Review the Web sites embedded in the activities. </SPAN></P><P><SPAN CLASS="content">For 
profiles of colonial life in different regions, go to <A HREF="http://college.hmco.com/history/readerscomp/rcah/html/ah_018000_colonialcult.htm">Colonial Culture</A>, available through EDSITEment-reviewed 
resource <A HREF="http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/">Digital History</A>, 
and read background information about New England, Middle Colonies, and Chesapeake 
Colonies. You may also want to read about <a href="http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/database/subtitles.cfm?titleID=97">Colonial Culture, Colonial Economy, 
and Colonial Government and Politics</a>. </SPAN></P><P><SPAN CLASS="content">Any 
other resources you have available related to colonial life might offer additional 
information for you or your students. </SPAN></P><P><SPAN CLASS="content">Make 
copies of maps, worksheets, and any other resources you will distribute to students. 
</SPAN></P><A NAME="ACTIVITIES"><H3>Suggested Activities</H3></A> <P><SPAN CLASS="contentbold"><A NAME="LESSON1">1. 
Defining the British Colonies</A></SPAN></P><P><P><SPAN CLASS="content">Distribute 
to all students a blank map of the United States. Ask students to label the thirteen 
original English colonies in pencil to the best of their knowledge. If you need 
a blank U.S. map, you can print one from the <A HREF="http://edsitement.neh.gov/default.asp">EDSITEment</A>-reviewed 
resource <A HREF="http://www.nationalgeographic.com/xpeditions/atlas/index.html">National 
Geographic Xpeditions</A>. In the Atlas, select "United States of America" and 
choose "Basic" to get a blank map of the U.S. today. </SPAN></P><P><SPAN CLASS="content">After 
students have attempted to label the colonies, show them a map of the U.S. colonies 
and territories in 1775. You can find such a <A HREF="http://xroads.virginia.edu/~MAP/TERRITORY/1775map.html">U.S. 
Territorial Map 1775</A>, available through the EDSITEment-reviewed resource <A HREF="http://xroads.virginia.edu/">American 
Studies at UVA</A>. You can either project or distribute this map. </SPAN></P><P><SPAN CLASS="content">Ask 
students to correctly label their maps with the names of the 13 original English 
colonies in ink. Then ask them to color three different colonial regions in different 
colors using colored pencils: New England, Middle Colonies, and Southern Colonies. 
They should also make a key, which includes a list of colonies in each region 
(see below). </SPAN></P><P><SPAN CLASS="content"><B>Key:</B> <BR><BR> New England—Massachusetts, 
New Hampshire, Connecticut, Rhode Island (Vermont and Maine came later) Middle 
Colonies—New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware Southern Colonies—Maryland, 
Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia </SPAN></P><P><SPAN CLASS="content">Students 
should also trace the lines of the Mississippi River and the Ohio River. Then 
they should shade in the section between the original colonies and the Mississippi, 
and label this region "British Territories." They should shade the part of the 
country west of the Mississippi with another color or marking and label it "Other 
Territories." Finally, they should label the map "The British Colonies in 1775." 
</SPAN></P><P><SPAN CLASS="content">Once they have finished, discuss as a class 
the significance of physical geography in the late 1700s, when colonists were 
settling the area that is now the United States. Some ideas to address in the 
discussion might include the following: </SPAN></P><SPAN CLASS="content"><UL><LI>Settlements 
needed to be near waterways because boats were the most practical way to transport 
cargo. In particular, access to the Atlantic Ocean was crucial at the time, as 
trade with Britain, the rest of Europe, the Caribbean, and Africa was essential 
to the colonial American economy. </LI><LI>Geographical barriers such as rivers 
and mountains limited settlement because transportation technology was much less 
developed than it is now. </LI><LI>Climate and geography had a major impact on 
the crops that settlers could grow for food and for trade. Tobacco, imported from 
Trinidad in 1612, became an important export crop for the Southern Colonies, where 
it grew particularly well. In addition, other crops such as corn and wheat grew 
well throughout the colonies. Fishing developed as an important industry, especially 
in New England, where ocean geography offered ideal conditions for abundant fish 
populations. About 4/5 of the colonial population were farmers. Approximately 
¼ of the colonial population were slaves, brought to the colonies against their 
will from Africa in the triangular trade system, in which European manufactured 
commodities were traded for slaves in Africa, who were then traded for agricultural 
commodities such as sugar, cotton, and tobacco to be taken back to Europe and 
the colonies. </LI><LI>All land was taken from Native Americans, either peacefully 
or forcefully. Native American friendliness was the only way that the initial 
colonies survived. Native American communities did not have the same sense of 
land ownership that Europeans had; they shared the land they occupied rather than 
staking a claim. Thus, there was a major cultural difference between the Europeans 
and the Native Americans, which resulted in major displacements of the latter.</LI></UL>Next, 
discuss with students what was going on during that period in American history. 
Some ideas to address in the discussion might include the following: <UL><LI>People 
came to the colonies for different reasons, such as seeking freedom from religious 
persecution, seeking fortune, or being kidnapped and enslaved. Naturally, their 
reasons for coming and their backgrounds had an impact on their values and priorities. 
</LI><LI>Life was very different in the various colonies. For example, slaves, 
who were an important part of the economic system, made up about 40% of the population 
in the Southern colonies at that time, while they were less common in the Northern 
Colonies. Agriculture was the primary industry in most colonies, but almost universally 
in the South. In New England, government was organized around town councils, whereas 
the Middle and Southern Colonies generally tended to organize their governments 
around counties. (This is still true.) Desire for religious freedom was a major 
incentive for settling in New England and the Middle Colonies, whereas economic 
opportunity was a primary factor in the settlement of the Southern Colonies. The 
Middle Colonies were settled largely by non-English Europeans, including Swedish, 
Dutch, and Germans, Swiss, French, Scottish, and Welsh. </LI><LI>Despite their 
differences, people in all colonies were becoming increasingly discontent with 
British colonial rule and its various manifestations, especially taxation without 
representation. Other concerns included British regulation of trade, mandates 
to house and feed British military, and lack of due process of law (fair trials). 
It is this discontent with British rule that united the diverse colonies in a 
fight for independence from Britain. </LI><LI>During the Revolutionary years, 
leaders from each colony joined together to a) claim independence from Britain 
and b) set up a unified government.</LI></UL></SPAN> <P><SPAN CLASS="contentbold"><A NAME="LESSON2">2. 
Investigating Life in Early America</A></SPAN></P><P><P><SPAN CLASS="content">This 
activity will introduce students to the work of historians by asking them to glean 
information about people in the past from artifacts they left behind. First, ask 
students if they know what an artifact is. Explain that an artifact is any object 
created by people, and that historians use artifacts to learn about life in the 
past. Discuss examples of artifacts in the classroom (e.g., book, desk, pencil, 
etc.) and what they might tell someone in the future about people's lives today. 
</SPAN></P><P><SPAN CLASS="content">Explain the difference between an observation 
and an interpretation. For example, you might observe that a book has writing 
inside. Then you might make the interpretation that a large number of books in 
the classroom might indicate that people do a lot of reading for information there. 
But this is not a proven fact based solely on the observation that there are books 
in the room. They could be used as booster seats! This is an important note about 
the work of historians—the stories they tell about the past include many interpretations 
based on observations of artifacts as well as other primary sources, which include 
actual accounts of the past from people who were there at the time. Even these 
accounts involve some interpretation from the person giving them, however. Of 
course the more evidence there is, the stronger the likelihood that interpretations 
are accurate. </SPAN></P><P><SPAN CLASS="content">Next, divide the class into 
two groups: the Ipswich, Massachusetts group and the Mill Creek, Delaware group. 
The Massachusetts group should investigate the Choate family at the <A HREF="http://americanhistory.si.edu/house/default.asp">Within 
These Walls</A> Web site, available on the <A HREF="http://americanhistory.si.edu/">Smithsonian 
Institution National Museum of American History</A>, through the EDSITEment-reviewed 
resource <A HREF="http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/">Digital History</A>, 
and fill out the <A HREF="/lesson_images/lesson411/HistorianWorksheet.pdf">Historian's 
Questions</A> worksheet, provided in pdf format, based on their investigation. 
The Delaware group should go investigate the Springer family at the Smithsonian 
Web site <A HREF="http://americanhistory.si.edu/kids/springer/">You Be 
the Historian</A> and fill out the same worksheet. </SPAN></P><P><SPAN CLASS="content">Depending 
on how many computers you have available, you many need to use different configurations 
of students. If you have a computer lab available, all students can work at the 
same time. If you only have a few computers available, you can divide the class 
into groups of 3-5 students and rotate the groups at the computer while the other 
students work on another activity. </SPAN></P><P><SPAN CLASS="content">When not 
at the computer, students can do the following activity: Print out and distribute 
<A HREF="http://gwpapers.virginia.edu/documents/civility/transcript.html">Rules of Civility 
& Decent Behavior</A>, available through EDSITEment-reviewed resource <A HREF="http://gwpapers.virginia.edu/index.html">The 
Papers of George Washington</A>. Explain that this was a popular document used 
in schools at the time, and this version of the list was found copied into George 
Washington's notebook when he was about 16. Ask students to read the list and 
write a paragraph explaining what it tells you about the life of a colonial adolescent 
in the 1700s and another paragraph telling how his or her life might compare to 
theirs. (You may want to copy and paste the text into a new document for better 
printing.) </SPAN></P><P><SPAN CLASS="content">According to the <A HREF="http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/treasures/trm077.html">American 
Treasures of the Library of Congress</A>, available through EDSITEment-reviewed 
resource <A HREF="http://memory.loc.gov/">American Memory Collection</A>: </SPAN></P><SPAN CLASS="content"><BLOCKQUOTE>"A 
youthful George Washington copied out these 110 simple '<I>Rules of Civility & 
Decent Behaviour in Company and Conversation</I>' as a school training exercise. 
This code of conduct is a simplified version of Francis Hawkins' <I>Youths Behavior, 
or Decency in Conversation Amongst Men</I>, which was based on a sixteenth-century 
set of rules compiled for young gentlemen by Jesuit instructors. Washington's 
handwriting, grammar, and spelling reflect his youth, and the 'Rules' reflect 
his strong desire to be a gentleman planter."</BLOCKQUOTE></SPAN><P> </P><P><SPAN CLASS="content">When 
students have completed their investigations, spend some time as a class discussing 
their findings. </SPAN> </P><P><SPAN CLASS="contentbold"><A NAME="LESSON3">3. 
Dear Cousin</A></SPAN></P><P><P><SPAN CLASS="content">In this activity, students 
write letters to each other from the perspectives of children in the Springer 
and Choate families. Tell students that they should imagine that the Springer 
and Choate families are cousins. Those who have studied the Springer family will 
identify themselves as one of their children and write a letter to a cousin in 
the Choate family. Those who have studied the Choate family will identify themselves 
as one of their children and write a letter to a cousin in the Springer family. 
Students should use all they have learned from their studies of the family's artifacts 
as well as other learning experiences about colonial life in America to write 
a letter that is authentic, although they are encouraged to use their imaginations 
to create realistic details. </SPAN></P><P><SPAN CLASS="content">Letters should 
follow standard friendly letter format and should include, at a minimum, the following 
components: </SPAN></P><SPAN CLASS="content"><UL><LI>A date (month, day, and year) 
</LI><LI>A description of the child's day, </LI><LI>A reference to at least one 
other member of the household, </LI><LI>A reference to the setting (e.g., the 
season, the house, the community), </LI><LI>An issue of concern, </LI><LI>A source 
of excitement, </LI><LI>At least two questions.</LI></UL></SPAN><P><SPAN CLASS="content">Letters 
should be distributed to members of the other group, so that each student receives 
one. If there is time, students should respond to the letters they receive, which 
will give them a chance to learn more about the other family and how their lives 
are both similar and different. </SPAN></P><P><SPAN CLASS="content">Finally, discuss 
as a group (or in small groups) how life in colonial America is both similar to 
and different from life in America today. Ask students to identify ways in which 
colonial pioneers influenced the way we live now. You can let the conversation 
flow naturally, or you can choose one or more themes to prompt focused discussion. 
Some possible themes to discuss might include the following: </SPAN></P><SPAN CLASS="content"><UL><LI>Freedom
