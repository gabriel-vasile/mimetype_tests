 <h1>COMPLAINT REGARDING INVENTION PROMOTER</h1>
    <p><strong>DATE OF CORRESPONDENCE:</strong> March 24, 2006</p>
    
    <p>Name of the Invention Promotion Company: Davison Inventegration</p>
    <p>Invention Promoter's Address: RIDC Park, 595 Alpha Drive, Pittsburgh, PA  15238-2911</p>
    <p>Complainant's Name:  Harold J. Hafer</p>
    <p>Complainant's Address: 1939 Old Reading Road, Lot 19, Catawissa, PA  17820</p>
    <p>Customer's Name:   Harold J. Hafer </p>
    <h1>WHAT IS YOUR COMPLAINT?</h1>
	<p>Name of mass media invention promoter advertised in:  Mail and the Internet</p>
	<p>Invention promotion services offered to be performed: To product a working proto type and present it to a  manufacture </p>
	<p>Explanation of complaint between customer and invention promoter: The invention promoter company Davidson failed to comply  with their agreement to make a proto type for my approval.&nbsp; I was contacted by <img src="../images/redacted.gif" alt="redacted" width="120" height="10"> from  Davidson to start his sales pitch about his company and how good they  were.&nbsp; I asked when was the proto type  going to be finished, Mr. <img src="../images/redacted.gif" alt="redacted" width="120" height="10"> said while they were working on the proto  type, Davidson would work on the packaging.&nbsp;  I asked how could you do that before a product is finished and  approved?&nbsp; He said the product would be  done way before the packaging is done.&nbsp;  I was called and said the packaging was done and in the mail to me.&nbsp; I asked what about the proto type, when will  that be finished?&nbsp; I was told that  Davidson had a company that was interested in my invention and they needed the  invention to send to them.&nbsp; Then I was  sent a letter that the company was not interested in it.&nbsp; I asked Davidson again, what about my proto  type?&nbsp; I was told again they had another  company waiting to see my invention and then I was told that Davidson&rsquo;s  licensing department was handling my account, I think I was getting a run  around.&nbsp; I was contacted by <img src="../images/redacted.gif" alt="redacted" width="120" height="10"> from Davidson that she sent my product to another company.&nbsp; I got a letter again not interested.&nbsp; I called Davidson again and was told that  the person that was handling my account was no longer with Davidson and <img src="../images/redacted.gif" alt="redacted" width="120" height="10"> will be in touch with me.&nbsp; I was  called by Davidson and told that they were going to send my product to another  company, yet again.&nbsp; I was talking to  Mr. Cable and said no way you are going to send it to another company without  me approving my proto type.&nbsp; Mr. Cable  agreed and sent me my proto type finally.&nbsp;  Well, I received the proto type that I paid over $13,000 for of my hard  earned money, but what did not cost any more that $50.00 to make.&nbsp; I sent the proto type back with a letter of  what I thought about the junk they sent me; Davidson got back to me and said  they were going to have their engineering department look at it.&nbsp; Well if their engineers would have done  their homework instead of sending lots of useless literature and put their time  in my invention, they would have sent me a product I would have been proud  of.&nbsp; I did check out Davidson and the  company seemed all right, but when I was getting the run around I checked them  out more thoroughly.&nbsp; They have several  complaints against them by other inventors.&nbsp;  I was not told about the complaints and also how many inventions their  success rating was.&nbsp; I was sent rating  forms when I first started with Davidson, I must agree I gave them a good  rating.&nbsp; When I got my piece of junk, I  asked to send me a rating sheet, you can guess what the score would be this  time.&nbsp; I am making copies of this  complaint to send to my attorney and to other government agencies.&nbsp; </p>
	<p>By the way, Davidson was going to send my invention to a  company that I know this company only accepts good working products, not  junk.&nbsp; Davidson knows how I know  this.&nbsp; I am sorry that I got hooked up  with a dishonest and fast talking company that just took our money.&nbsp; I think they should reimburse me all my money  before I go further. </p>
	<p>. </p>
