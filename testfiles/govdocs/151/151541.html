  <p> The thirteen-lined ground squirrel is the most common ground squirrel in 
    North Dakota and can be found statewide. Like other species, it prefers well-drained 
    soils for digging burrows and can be found in pasture land, along roadsides, 
    golf courses, and the edges of farm fields. 
  <p> This is the smallest of the ground squirrels that lives in North Dakota. 
    It has an overall measurement of about 9 1/2 inches of which one-third is 
    tail. Weights may vary from season to season. Spring weights are roughly one-quarter 
    pound whereas fall weights approach half a pound, as they prepare for winter. 
  <p> As in the Richardson's ground squirrel, the external ear is small. The colorful 
    coat, however, should set this ground squirrel apart from the others. An alternating 
    pattern of dark brown and yellowish-tan stripes extend down its back. The 
    dark stripes contain evenly spaced white dots throughout. The sides and belly 
    are yellowish white. 
  <p> Thirteen-lined ground squirrels are primarily solitary but may form loose 
    colonies, but not like the densities found in the Richardson's colony. Population 
    densities may approach ten animals per acre. Burrows descend steeply at first 
    and then level off somewhere between four inches and four feet under the ground. 
    Often, more than one burrow is excavated. Some burrows are used for temporary 
    shelter while others contain round chambers for nesting and food storage. 
    During hibernation, an earth plug may block the burrow's entrance. 
  <p> Daylight is the only time this small mammal is active. Upon emerging from 
    hibernation in late March or April, they are ready to breed. After a gestation 
    period of about 28 days, a female produces one litter of about 8-9 young. 
    Young emerge from the burrow at the age of one month. In late summer, they 
    disperse to find their own homes. 
  <p> These ground squirrels are omnivorous, feeding on both plant and animal 
    matter. In the spring, available grasses and roots are eaten. During summer 
    and fall, they feed on insects and seeds as they become available. Occasionally, 
    mice and carrion are consumed. 
  <p> Any wildlife species that has developed a high birth rate such as the thirteen-lined 
    also experiences high mortality. Flooding may play a large part in limiting 
    numbers along with daylight predators such as hawks, badgers, weasels, snakes, 
    and feral cats.
