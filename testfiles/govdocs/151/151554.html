<P 
ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Objectives:</B>  This research addresses the 
mechanical properties of two weak sedimentary 
lithologies, shale and rock salt, that deform under gravitational 
and tectonic loads and examines the roles of these 
lithologies in the development of structural traps and 
unconventional oil and gas reservoirs.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> <B>Project Description:</B>  The shapes and 
physical properties of a wide range of structural traps and 
barriers to mobile hydrocarbons are governed by the 
mechanical properties of shale or those of salt and by 
the loading histories to which they have been subjected. 
 Concurrent experimental and modeling studies are underway to determine the 
fracture and flow properties of these two lithologies, to determine 
physically- based constitutive relationships that can be applied 
to geologically relevant conditions, and to make 
predictions concerning the development and timing of 
structural traps relative to known depositional histories.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Results:</B>  Significant progress has been made 
during this year towards characterizing the mechanical 
and transport properties of Wilcox shale saturated with 
fluids of varying chemistry and towards simulating 
the evolution of salt structures by modeling the 
deformation of rock salt and overlying sediments with 
nonlinear, experimentally constrained rheologies.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our investigations of shale deformation have 
been extended from strain rates of 10<SUP>-8</SUP> 
s<SUP>-1</SUP> to 10<SUP>-3</SUP> s<SUP>-1</SUP> to 
include time scales that represent drained and 
effectively undrained conditions as determined from experimen

<P 
ALIGN="JUSTIFY">tally determined hydraulic diffusivities and 
calculations of internal pore pressures.  Having established 
these time scales, we have determined and are currently 
refining effective stress laws for permeability and 
failure strength of shale.  We have examined the effects of 
fluid chemistry on permeability using NaCl, KCl, and 
CaCl<SUB>2</SUB> brines and distilled water, and we have further 
explored the effects of water as a pore fluid and as adsorbed 
layers at clay surfaces, on mechanical properties. 
Permeability measured at increasing and decreasing 
effective pressures suggest substantial changes in pore 
geometries that are inelastic as effective pressure is 
increased while recoverable poro-elastic effects are observed 
as effective pressure is decreased.  
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our numerical studies of salt structure 
development have led to insights into the initiation, evolution, 
and timing of complex salt structures of the northern 
continental shelf of the Gulf of Mexico, as well as the 
sensitivities of salt structure development to 
subsurface conditions, viscosity contrasts between salt bodies 
and overlying sediments, and degrees of nonlinearity in 
rheology. These model studies have been accompanied 
by studies of deformation microstructures of natural 
salt structures of the Gulf of Mexico using cores 
recovered from actively deforming allochthonous salt nappes. 
 Equivalent stress levels within these structures, as 
determined from stress-dependent microstructures, 
offer important constraints for the models and the 
rheologies on which our models are based.

<P 
ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Objectives:</B>  The objectives of this study were 
to (1) evaluate if observed heat flow anomalies in the 
south Texas portion of the Gulf of Mexico sedimentary 
basin (if reconfirmed by extensive data analysis) can 
be accounted for by conduction alone or if convection 
is a significant process, (2) determine if the present 
potential field is amenable to convection hypotheses, 
and (3) develop fluid and heat flux histories compatible 
with both compiled and newly collected data.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Project Description:</B>  In order to test 
hypotheses posed to address the above objectives, we compiled 
 an extensive data base of fluid pressures (&gt;25,000    
 data points at depths of up to 5 kilometers [over    
 16,000 feet]), water chemistries (&gt;2000 data 
points), and formation temperatures (&gt;5500 data points) 
from a variety of private and public sources; installed a 
G.I.S. to analyze these data; analyzed selected drill cores 
and cuttings for their mineralogical, thermal 
conductivity, radiogenic heat production, and porosity/bulk 
density data.  We culled spurious pressure and temperature 
data, corrected temperature and pressure data to 
infer predevelopment conditions, calculated buoyancy 
gradients, and implemented mathematical and 
numerical models to simulate the study area's temperatures 
and pressures and to infer the importance of the 
various processes.

<P 
ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Results:</B> Analysis of the data reconfirmed the 
thermal anomalies discerned from the previous, 
much smaller data bases.  New data on fault zone 
locations centered the anomalies along the deepest-seated 
Wilcox Faults. The pressure data revealed that petroleum 
production has created significant depressurization 
that extends well beyond the immediate petroleum 
reservoirs.  The water chemistry data revealed zones 
of higher salinity coincident with Wilcox and Frio 
fault zones.  Several areas have significant buoyancy 
gradients.  This creates conditions conducive to free 
convection that was confirmed using the SUTRA 
computer model. The thermal property data revealed several 
interesting trends.  First, radiogenic heat production 
in the Gulf of Mexico Basin is significant and should 
be accounted for in simulation models, but this 
production is not responsible for the thermal anomalies.  
Secondly, sandstone thermal conductivities correlate 
well with  quartz content and porosity; a new empirical 
equation for Gulf Coast sandstone thermal 
conductivities was developed.  Shale cuttings indicated 
significant shrinkage so that laboratory measurements of 
shale thermal conductivity, porosity, and bulk density are 
suspect.  Our models indicate that forced 
convection (advection) is a significant factor in 
geological-time, regional-scale heat transport and that both free 
and forced convection are significant in salinity transport.

<P 
ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Objectives:</B>  This project is investigating 
techniques by which crosswell velocity tomograms can be 
constructed from seismic wavefields generated by a 
surface-positioned source and recorded by downhole sensors in two or more in-line receiver wells and 
is verifying if this type of source-receiver geometry 
produces travel-time tomograms of sufficient accuracy 
to be used in reservoir characterization and monitoring.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Project Description:</B>  Crosswell 
velocity tomograms can be helpful in reservoir 
characterization and monitoring, yet crosswell applications cannot 
be attempted in highly attenuating rocks or between 
widely separated wells because of the limited energy 
output of present downhole seismic sources.  In 
concept, crosswell data can be acquired in these no-data 
situations by using a robust surface-based energy source 
and then measuring the travel times required for these 
surface-generated wavefields to travel between 
downhole sensors positioned at different depths in two in-line 
receiver wells. If this combination of surface 
energy source and twin receiver wells allows ray paths to 
be recorded over an  adequate angular aperture and 
also provides a travel-time accuracy that is adequate for 
velocity inversion, then crosswell applications can 
be implemented in reservoirs having almost any well 
spacing and any type of interwell lithology.  The 
purposes of this research are to determine how to best record 
this type of crosswell data and then to verify if the data 
satisfy the numerical requirements for creating 
travel-time tomograms that can be used in reservoir evaluations.

<TD COLSPAN=1 ROWSPAN=2 HEIGHT=448 WIDTH=247 VALIGN="TOP">
<P 
ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Results: </B>Crosswell data were recorded between 
two receiver wells that penetrated low-velocity, weakly 
consolidated Pleistocene rocks in South Texas. The downhole sensors in each well were a six-level 
hydrophone array with 10-ft spacings between adjacent 
hydrophone elements. The surface energy source was 
a Bolt land air gun stationed at four offset positions 
that were in-line with the two receiver wells.  The 
downhole data were recorded at vertical increments of 10 ft over 
a depth aperture of 1500 to 2500 ft  in each receiver well.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This work was done in an active oil field so 
that the typical background seismic noise of pumping 
wells, nearby workover activity, and continuous vehicular 
traffic associated with a producing reservoir would be 
superimposed on the downhole data.  This 
environment was desired so a determination could be made if 
production activity has to be reduced in order to 
record crosswell data of adequate quality when using this 
type of source-receiver geometry.  It is particularly  
important to know how these types of cultural noises 
affect free-hanging hydrophones, because a hydrophone 
array can be moved to a new downhole recording 
level quicker than a wall-clamped receiver array can, 
thus allowing crosswell data to be recorded in less time 
and at less cost.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An eikonal technique has been used to 
reproduce the P-wave arrival times observed in these data and 
to construct an interwell P-wave tomogram.  The 
interwell velocity distribution resulting from this eikonal 
computation agrees with the velocity control that is 
available at the twin-well site.

hydrocarbon reservoirs from near-surface analogs.  
Constraints include detailed sedimentologic mapping of 
outcrops and lab and petrophysical analyses of plug and

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Project Description:</B> Existing reservoir models 
are based on only 2-D outcrop studies; their 3-D 
apsects are inferred from correlation between well data and 
so are inadequately constrained for reservoir 
simulations. Field study sites are in the Cretaceous 
Ferron Sandstone in Utah. Detailed sedimentary facies maps of 
cliff faces will define the geometry and distribution of 
reservoir flow units, barriers, and baffles at the 
outcrop. High resolution 3-D ground-penetrating radar 
(GPR) images will extend these reservoir characteristics 
into 3-D, thereby enabling development of realistic 
3-D reservoir models. Models will use geometrical 
information from the mapping and the GPR data, petrophysical data from surface and cliff-face

<P 
ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ARCO; the results will be incorporated into this 
project. An extensive new data set has been collected from 
fluvial deposits at one site at Coyote Basin, covering a  
 40 m x 16.5 m surface area to a depth of 30 meters. 
 The fluvial sandstone is composed of a channel 
complex in the upper 12 meters of a section that 
overlies floodplain mudstone, coal, and crevasse splay 
deposits.  Three 3-D GPR data volumes were acquired 
at frequencies of 50, 100, and 200 MHz. The surface 
geology has been mapped and shows fractures and 
sedimentary features, such as cross beds.  A facies map 
has been created of the adjacent vertical cliff face.  
Five stratigraphic sections, gamma-ray profiles, and 
photographs were made at the cliff face, extending 
through the upper fluvial sandstone; one section extends to 
a depth of 30 meters, well into the underlying 
floodplain deposits.  Approximately 700 core plugs have 
been extracted from the cliff face for determination of 
permeability. Paleo- current data have been obtained 
at four localities in the vicinity of the GPR survey site. 
 Four 14-meter wells have been cored within the 
GPR data cube; stratigraphic sections have been logged 
from the core. Thus, most of the raw data for 
characterization of this site are now in hand.

<P 
ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Objectives:</B> The project is structured around 
investigation of the premise that active and ancient 
moderate-temperature hydrothermal systems, by 
various means, have been instrumental in the generation, 
migration, and entrapment of oil in the Basin and Range province of the western United States.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Project Description:</B> The eastern Basin and 
Range encompasses several shallow and hot (&lt;2 km; up 
to 130&#176;C) oil fields (for example Blackburn and 
Grant Canyon/Bacon Flat) that geologically resemble 
the Carlin-type, Paleozoic sediment-hosted gold 
deposits occurring in the same region&#151;in particular those 
of the southern Alligator Ridge mining district about 
midway between the towns of Elko and Ely, Nevada.  
We are investigating the distinct possibility that at 
least some of these gold deposits are the exhumed and 
oxidized, paleogeothermal analogues of the modern, 
exploited geothermal oil fields. Our approach is multidisciplinary, involving (1) detailed geologic 
mapping, (2) logging of drill cuttings and cores, with 
emphasis on alteration, porosity characteristics, 
vein mineralization and paragenesis, and hydrocarbon 
type and distribution, (3) three-dimensional 
stratigraphic/structural analysis to allow reconstruction of 
fluid-flow paths used by both thermal waters and 
hydrocarbons, (4) fluid-inclusion microthermometry, to ascertain 
the compositions and temperatures of these fluids at 
different times during the duration of the 
hydrothermal system, (5) whole-rock and vein-mineral 
geochemistry, (6) hydrogeochemistry of oil-field vs. regional

ALIGN="JUSTIFY">waters, and (7) stable-isotopic systematics of 
thermal waters and vein and alteration minerals.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Results:</B> During the past year, we have mapped 
several small, new open-pit gold mines in the 
southern Alligator Ridge district, adding new details to the 
stratigraphic/structural and hydrothermal picture 
previously established for this area.  All the new mines 
penetrate the same oil-bearing, altered, and mineralized 
Paleozoic sedimentary sequence encountered in prior 
excavations.  The oil, freely-flowing and in fluid 
inclusions, occurs within and around both low- and high-grade 
gold ore bodies. From detailed petrographic and 
fluid-inclusion work coupled with field relationships, the 
oil appears to have been introduced in the same 
hydrothermal system responsible for the precious-metal 
mineralization.  The temperature of mineralization apparently did not exceed 130&#176;C.  This surprising 
finding is confirmed not only by 
pressure-corrected, fluid-inclusion homogenization temperatures but also 
by temperature-dependent biomarker transformation 
preserved by hydrocarbons in oil-rich fluid inclusions. 
 There is a distinct depletion in 
<SUP>18</SUP>O/<SUP>16</SUP>O of the oil-bearing ore bodies' wall rocks relative to their 
unaltered and unmineralized counterparts.  Two deep oil 
wells completed in the immediate area penetrated neither 
intrusive rocks nor sedimentary rocks 
hydrothermally altered at high temperatures.  One of these wells, just 
a mile from the ore bodies, bored through the 
hydrocarbon source rocks, which at this location and depth 
were shown by Rock-Eval pyrolysis to be near peak oil-gen

the gold-depositing hydrothermal system was directly 
responsible here for the generation, migration, and 
entrapment of oil; however, we still do not know to 
what extent, if any, the oil actually contributed to the 
mineralization process.  In other words, the formation of 
this particular fossil oil reservoir may well have been just 
a beneficial side effect of the ore-forming 
hydrothermal event.  By contrast, at another oil-rich 
gold deposit, Gold Point near Ely, we have determined that 
hydrocarbons were crucial to mineralization, most likely 
providing highly adsorptive substrates for 
electrum precipitation. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In huge Railroad Valley, about 25 km southwest 
of Gold Point and the site of most of Nevada's oil 
production,  our study of oil-well drill-stem-test

geothermal plumes have fostered the maturation of 
hydrocarbon source rocks as well as the migration and 
entrapment of the newly generated oils.  A pilot study of the 
regional hydrocarbon-sealing mechanism in this 
valley has indicated that volcanic-ash-rich beds at the base 
of the valley-fill sequence have been widely altered 
to montmorillonite, thereby inhibiting the escape of 
oils structurally entrapped in underlying Tertiary 
ignimbrites and brecciated Paleozoic dolomites. At Kyle 
Hot Springs, near Winnemucca in western Nevada, an 
active, moderate-temperature geothermal system has 
 generated paraffin-rich heavy crude oils from 
hypersaline-lacustrine Tertiary source rocks, which are 
otherwise well below the favorable oil-generation &quot;window.&quot; 
 The Kyle system, in a more energetic early phase, 
also precipitated hydrocarbon- and gold-bearing 
siliceous sinter, bolstering the geothermal/oil/gold connection 
we have been documenting in the eastern part of the state.

and hydrothermally altered rock along the faults.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(2) Develop a three-dimensional,

ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Objectives:</B> The objective of this project is to 
experimentally determine the 
pressure-volume-temperature-composition (PVTX) relationships 
of H<SUB>2</SUB>O-CO<SUB>2</SUB>-NaCl mixtures over the complete range 
of PTX conditions encountered in crustal energy, 
resource, and waste-related environments.  These data are 
used to develop equations of state to predict the behavior 
of these fluids in crustal rocks.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Project Description:</B>  Volumetric (PVT) data 
provide the fundamental information needed to 
understand the physical and chemical behavior of fluids in 
energy, resource, and waste-related environments.  
Further, these data represent the basis for developing 
empirical or theoretical equations of state to predict the 
thermodynamic properties of fluids over crustal PTX 
conditions. In this study the PVTX properties of 
H<SUB>2</SUB>O-CO<SUB>2</SUB>-NaCl are being experimentally 
determined using the synthetic fluid inclusion technique.  With 
this technique, fluids of known composition are trapped 
as inclusions by healing fractures in quartz at known 
temperatures and pressures.  Phase relations and P-T 
locations of isochores in the 
H<SUB>2</SUB>O-CO<SUB>2</SUB>-NaCl system are obtained by observing the temperatures and modes 
of homogenization of the synthetic fluid inclusions 
during subsequent heating and cooling experiments in 
a fluid inclusion stage mounted on a petrographic 
microscope.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Results:</B>  The location of the solvus and 
isochores for an H<SUB>2</SUB>O-CO<SUB>2</SUB>-NaCl solution having a composition
<TD COLSPAN=1>
<TD COLSPAN=1 ROWSPAN=2 HEIGHT=434 WIDTH=247 VALIGN="TOP">
<P 
ALIGN="JUSTIFY">of 20 wt.% NaCl and 10 mol% 
CO<SUB>2</SUB> (both relative to H<SUB>2</SUB>O) were determined over the range 350&#176;-580&#176;C 
and up to 5 kb.  These data significantly extend the 
range of PTX conditions over which data are available 
for this geologically important fluid system.  The 
results confirm the earlier suggestion that the solvus 
displays a pressure minimum in P-T space with a very 
steep slope at temperatures below the minimum and a 
very shallow slope at temperatures above the minimum.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A technique has been developed for 
determining compositions of synthetic 
H<SUB>2</SUB>O-CO<SUB>2</SUB> inclusions, based on laser Raman microprobe (LRM) analysis.  With 
the technique, inclusions are analyzed at 350&#176;C using 
LRM, and the intensities are related to composition through 
a simple polynomial equation.  The technique is 
valid for 
CO<SUB>2</SUB>/(H<SUB>2</SUB>O-CO<SUB>2</SUB>) ranging from 0-1 and is 
relatively insensitive to inclusion density variations.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Hydrothermal Diamond-Anvil Cell 
(HDAC) has been developed as a pressurized fluid 
inclusion stage.  The HDAC permits analysis of fluid 
inclusions that develop high internal pressures during 
conventional microthermometry.  Previously, data could not be 
obtained from such inclusions because they 
decrepitated (exploded) before the homogenization temperature 
was reached as the internal pressure exceeded the 
tensile strength of the host mineral.  This development 
permits PVT data for H<SUB>2</SUB>O-CO<SUB>2</SUB>-NaCl to be obtained 
over a much wider range of PTX conditions than 
possible previously.

to combine new experimental measurements on heat

theoretical equations of state to generate predictions 
of thermodynamic data that allow quantitative models

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Project Description:</B>  This project is part of 
an ongoing collaboration between Prof. Everett Shock 
of Washington University and Prof. Robert Wood of 
the University of Delaware in which we are (1) 
making substantial improvements in theoretical equations 
of state for aqueous nonelectrolytes and electrolytes, 
based largely on data collected during previous 
DOE-funded research, (2) pursuing novel applications of these 
equations of state to the study of high 
temperature/pressure geochemical processes, involving aqueous fluids, 
and (3) building predictive methods for organic solutes, 
using functional group contributions that allow 
estimates of thermodynamic properties at high temperatures 
and pressures.  The experimental work is conducted at 
the University of Delaware.  Geochemical applications 
of the data and development of predictive methods is 
done at Washington University.  Efforts to improve the 
equations of state for nonelectrolytes and the 
functional group contributions are shared  between the two labs,

<TD COLSPAN=1 ROWSPAN=2 HEIGHT=392 WIDTH=247 VALIGN="TOP">
<P 
ALIGN="JUSTIFY">because this task in particular requires close

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Results:</B> Progress in developing new equations 
of state has been presented at national meetings (ACS 
and GSA) by Mitch Schulte, the graduate student who 
is conducting this research as part of his PhD thesis.  
The new equations are considerably more accurate than 
the revised Helgeson-Kirkham-Flowers (HKF) 
equations for nonelectrolytes, and the results are being 
prepared for publication.   The equations and estimation 
procedures have been tested against data recently 
obtained by Schulte in the lab of Prof. Vladimir Majer at 
the Universit&eacute; Blaise Pascal in Clermont-Ferrand, France. 
 As a consequence, new methods for making predictions for organic solutes are also near completion.  
Dr. Jan Amend has been hired as a post-doc to pursue 
theoretical developments closer to the critical point of 
H<SUB>2</SUB>O and to expand on the functional group estimation 
procedure.  Usefulness of the revised-HKF equations 
for inorganic ions, electrolytes, and complexes has 
expanded. Revised data and parameters for aqueous 
ions and hydroxide complexes are in press at 
<I>Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta</I> (Shock et al., 1996).  
Exploration continues on methods to use the revised-HKF 
approach at pressures &gt;5 kb.

<P 
ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Objectives: </B>The objective is to develop 
efficient techniques for high resolution imaging of 
multidimensional electrical structure of the Earth's subsurface.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Project Description:</B>  Because the 
electromagnetic inverse problem for natural sources is generally 
multidimensional, most imaging algorithms saturate 
available computer power before the complete data set 
can be addressed. We have developed an algorithm 
called the rapid relaxation inversion (RRI) to directly 
invert large multidimensional magnetotelluric (MT) data 
sets. This method is orders of magnitude faster than 
competing methods. The key to its efficiency is that an 
improvement in the structure directly beneath an MT 
site can be calculated from a one-dimensional (1-D) 
inverse problem if one has information about the 
multidimensional fields as a function of depth beneath the 
site. The capability of RRI for two-dimensional (2-D) 
structure is being enhanced, and it is being extended to 
fully three-dimensional (3-D) structure. In addition, 
related holographic electromagnetic imaging techniques 
are being investigated and RRI is being extended to 
handle data generated by controlled source techniques.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Results:</B>  In the past year, RRI has been 
extended to invert data generated by controlled sources.  
This has been achieved by interfacing the RRI algorithm
<TD COLSPAN=1>
<TD COLSPAN=1 ROWSPAN=2 HEIGHT=364 WIDTH=247 VALIGN="TOP">
<P 
ALIGN="JUSTIFY">and a finite element algorithm that model the EM 
fields of the transmitter in 3-D.  The inversion has been 
successfully tested on synthetic and field data. In each 
case the inversion was able to generate a subsurface 
resistivity model that reproduced the data. The inversion 
of synthetic data produced a model containing the 
important features present in the model used to generate 
the data. In the case of the field data, the model 
agreed well with independent estimates of subsurface 
structure, such as well-log information.  The 
approximations used in the original RRI appear to work well 
for the controlled source electromagnetic signals.  
Progress has also been made on two algorithms used to 
obtain accurate MT data from field data. In the first, an 
alternative formulation of the Groom-Bailey tensor 
decomposition method is used to remove the effect of 
shallow structure and to determine the regional 2-D strike 
direction. In the second algorithm, rho-plus, data is 
evaluated for consistency with a 1-D subsurface 
resistivity structure, and the apparent resistivity and phase 
are checked for mutual consistency. These algorithms 
have been found to be very useful in evaluating a number 
of MT data sets and in providing responses that can 
be analyzed with a 2-D inversion.
