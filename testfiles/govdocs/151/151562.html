              It also supports <i>individual accountability</i>, which is one 
              of the most important ways to improve computer security. Without 
              knowing the necessary security measures (and to how to use them), 
              users cannot be truly accountable for their actions. The importance 
              of this training is emphasized in the Computer Security Act, which 
              requires training for those involved with the management, use, and

              the two overriding benefits of awareness, training, and education, 
              namely: (1) improving employee behavior and (2) increasing the ability 
              to hold employees accountable for their actions. Next, awareness, 
              training, and education are discussed separately, with techniques 
              used for each. Finally, the chapter presents one approach for developing 
              computer security awareness and training program.<a href="#96"><sup>96</sup></a></font></p>
            <h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">13.1 Behavior</font></h3>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">People are a crucial 
              factor in ensuring the security of computer systems and valuable 
              information resources. Human actions account for a far greater degree 
              of computer-related loss than all other sources combined. Of such 
              losses, the actions of an organization's insiders normally cause 
              far more harm than the actions of outsiders. (Chapter 4 discusses 
              the major sources of computer-related loss.)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The major causes of loss 
              due to an organization's own employees are: errors and omissions, 
              fraud, and actions by disgruntled employees. One principal purpose 
              of security awareness, training, and education is to reduce errors 
              and omissions. However, it can also reduce fraud and unauthorized 
              activity by disgruntled employees by increasing employees' knowledge 
              of their accountability and the penalties associated with such actions.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Management sets the 
              example for behavior within an organization.</i> If employees know 
              that management does not care about security, no training class 
              teaching the importance of security and imparting valuable skills 
              can be truly effective. This "tone from the top" has myriad effects 
              an organization's security program.</font></p>

                  of the keys to a successful computer security program is security 
                  awareness and training. If employees are not informed of applicable 
                  organizational policies and procedures, they cannot be expected 
                  to act effectively to secure computer resources.</font></td>

              and the <i>enforcement</i> of policy are critical issues that are 
              implemented and strengthened through training programs. Employees 
              cannot be expected to follow policies and procedures of which they 
              are unaware. In addition, enforcing penalties may be difficult if 
              users can claim ignorance when caught doing something wrong.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Training employees may 
              also be necessary to show that a standard of <i>due care</i> has 
              been taken in protecting information. Simply issuing policy, with 
              no follow-up to implement that policy, may not suffice.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many organizations use 
              <i>acknowledgment statements</i>, which state that employees have 
              read and understand computer security requirements. (An example 
              is provided in Chapter 10.)</font></p>

              to an organization, its mission, customers, and employees if security 
              fails motivates people to take security seriously.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Awareness can take on 
              different forms for particular audiences. Appropriate awareness 
              for management officials might stress management's pivotal role 
              in establishing organizational attitudes toward security. Appropriate 
              awareness for other groups, such as system programmers or information 
              analysts, should address the need for security as it relates to 
              their job. In today's systems environment, almost everyone in an 
              organization may have access to system resources -- and therefore 
              may have the potential to cause harm. </font>

              For example, after a while, a security poster, no matter how well

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The first step in developing 
              a CSAT program is to determine the program's scope, goals, and objectives. 
              The scope of the CSAT program should provide training to all types 
              of people who interact with computer systems. The scope of the program 
              can be an entire organization or a subunit. Since users need training, 
              which relates directly to their use of particular systems, a large 
              organization wide program may need to be supplemented by more specific 
              programs. In addition, the organization should specifically address 
              whether the program applies to employees only or also to other users 
              of organizational systems.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Generally, the overall 
              goal of a CSAT program is to sustain an appropriate level of protection 
              for computer resources by increasing employee awareness of their 
              computer security responsibilities and the ways to fulfill them. 
              More specific goals may need to be established. Objectives should 
              be defined to meet the organization's specific goals.</font></p>
            <h4><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">13.6.2 Identify Training 
              Staff</font></h4>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are many possible 
              candidates for conducting the training including internal training 
              departments, computer security staff, or contract services. Regardless 
              of who is chosen, it is important that trainers have sufficient 
              knowledge of computer security issues, principles, and techniques. 
              It is also vital that they know how to communicate information and 
              ideas effectively.</font></p>
            <h4><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">13.6.3 Identify Target 
              Audiences</font></h4>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Not everyone needs the 
              same degree or type of computer security information to do their 
              jobs. A CSAT program that distinguishes between groups of people, 
              presents only the information needed by the particular audience, 
              and omits irrelevant information will have the best results. Segmenting 
              audiences (e.g., by their function or familiarity with the system) 
              can also improve the effectiveness of a CSAT program. For larger 
              organizations, some individuals will fit into more than one group. 
              For smaller organizations, segmenting may not be needed. The following 
              methods are some examples of ways to do this.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Segment according 
              to level of awareness</i>. Individuals may be separated into groups 
              according to their current level of awareness. This may require 
              research to determine how well employees follow computer security 
              procedures or understand how computer security fits into their jobs.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Segment according 
              to general job task or function</i>. Individuals may be grouped 
              as data providers, data processors, or data users.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Segment according 
              to specific job category</i>. Many organizations assign individuals 
              to job categories. Since each job category generally has different 
              job responsibilities, training for each will be different. Examples 
              of job categories could be general management, technology management, 
              applications development, or security.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Segment according 
              to level of computer knowledge</i>. Computer experts may be expected 
              to find a program containing highly technical information more valuable 
              than one covering the management issues in computer security. Similarly, 
              a computer novice would benefit more from a training program that 
              presents introductory fundamentals.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Segment according 
              to types of technology or systems used</i>. Security techniques 
              used for each off-the-shelf product or application system will usually 
              vary. The users of major applications will normally require training 
              specific to that application.</font></p>

              motivational techniques to show management and employees how their

              when the organization starts to use a new application or changes 
              its environment, such as by connecting to the Internet. Likewise, 
              an awareness program can become obsolete if laws or organization 
              policies change. For example, the awareness program should make 
              employees aware of a new policy on e-mail usage. Employees may discount

              information is retained, to what extent computer security procedures 
              are being followed, and general attitudes toward computer security. 
              The results of such an evaluation should help identify and correct 
              problems. Some evaluation methods (which can be used in conjunction 
              with one another) are:</font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Training can, and in 
              most cases should, be used to support every control in the handbook. 
              All controls are more effective if designers, implementers, and 
              users are thoroughly trained.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Policy.</i> Training 
              is a critical means of informing employees of the contents of and 
              reasons for the organization's policies.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Security Program Management.</i> 
              Federal agencies need to ensure that appropriate computer security 
              awareness and training is provided, as required under the Computer 
              Security Act of 1987. A security program should ensure that an organization 
              is meeting all applicable laws and regulations.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Personnel/User Issues.</i> 
              Awareness, training, and education are often included with other 
              personnel/user issues. Training is often required before access 
              is granted to a computer system.</font></p>

  may decrease when users know the proper procedures to avoid infection. On the 
  other hand, reports of incidents may go up as users employ virus scanners and 
  find more viruses. In addition, users will now know that virus incidents should 
  be reported and to whom the reports should be sent.</font></p>
