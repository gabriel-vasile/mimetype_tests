 Company,  Inc.  (ITC),  Mukluk  Telephone,  Inc.  (MTC),  and  United  KUC,  Inc.  (Petitioners,  collectively),  filed  a  petition  requesting  a  waiver  of  sections  61.41  (c)  and  (d)  of  the 
 Commission’s  rules.  47  C.  F.  R.  §§  61.41(  c),  61.41(  d).  Petitioners  2  request  that  we  waive  the  Commission's  rules  in  order  to  allow  them  to  operate  thirteen  Alaska  telephone  exchanges  as  cost 
 carriers  under  rate  of  return  regulation  following  ATEAC’s  acquisition  of  these  exchanges  from  GTE  Alaska,  Incorporated  (GTEAC),  a  price  cap  carrier.  3  On  March  1,  2000,  the  Common  Carrier 
 Bureau  (Bureau)  released  a  Public  Notice  requesting  comment  on  the  Petition.  4  No  comments  or  reply  comments  opposing  the  Petition  were  filed  in  response  to  the  Public  Notice.  The  Commission 
 received  two  comments  in  support  of  the  Petition.  5  In  this  Memorandum  Opinion  and  Order,  we  grant  Petitioners’  waiver  request. 


 II.  BACKGROUND 
 2.  Section  61.41(  c)(  1)  of  the  Commission's  rules  provides  that  any  price  cap  telephone  company  subject  to  a  merger,  acquisition,  or  similar  transaction  shall  continue  to  be  subject  to  price 
 cap  regulation  notwithstanding  such  transaction.  6  In  addition,  the  Commission's  rules  provide  that  when  a  non-  price  cap  company  acquires,  merges  with,  or  otherwise  becomes  affiliated  with  a  price 
 cap  company  or  any  part  thereof,  the  acquiring  company  becomes  subject  to  price  cap  regulation  and  must  file  price  cap  tariffs  within  a  year.  7  Section  61.41(  d)  of  the  Commission's  rules  further 


 2  Petitioners  note  that  ATC,  ASTAC,  ITC,  MTC,  and  UUI  qualify  as  “rural  telephone 
 companies”  under  Section  3  (37)  of  the  Communications  Act  of  1934,  as  amended,  47  U.  S.  C.  §3  (37),  and  section  51.5  of  the  Commission’s  rules,  47  C.  F.  R.  §  51.5,  and  further  note  that  United-  KUC,  a 


 new  Alaska  local  exchange  carrier,  will  also  qualify  as  a  “rural  telephone  company”  under  these  two  provisions.  Petition  at  2.

 provides  that  local  exchange  carriers  (LECs)  that  become  subject  to  price  cap  regulation  are  not  permitted  to  withdraw  from  such  regulation.  8 
 3.  On  May  20,  1999,  GTEA,  GTE,  and  ATEAC  entered  an  asset  purchase  agreement  for  the  sale  of  all  thirteen  of  GTEA’s  9  Alaska  exchanges  (approximately  23,796  access  lines)  to 
 ATEAC.  GTEA  and  GTE  are  both  price  cap  carriers.  On  September  3,  1999,  GTEA  and  ATEAC  jointly  applied  to  the  Regulatory  Commission  of  Alaska  (“  Alaska  Commission”)  for 
 authorization  to  transfer  GTEA’s  Certificate  of  Public  Convenience  and  Necessity  No.  3  for  the  thirteen  exchanges  to  ATEAC.  On  December  28,  1999,  GTEA  filed  an  application  under 
 Section  214(  a)  of  the  Communications  Act  and  section  63.71  of  the  Commission’s  rules  10  ,  requesting  authority  to  discontinue  providing  interstate  services  in  Alaska,  effective  with  the  sale 
 of  its  thirteen  Alaska  local  exchanges  to  ATEAC.  11  The  Petitioners  filed  applications  with  the  Alaska  Commission  for  authorization  to  transfer  operating  assets  and  state  certificates  for  the 
 thirteen  exchanges  from  ATEAC  to  the  other  petitioners.  12  These  applications  were  granted  by  the  Alaska  Commission  on  July  11,  2000. 


 4.  The  Petitioners  state  that,  with  the  Alaska  Commission’s  authorization  to  transfer  the  thirteen  exchanges  from  GTEA  to  ATEAC,  GTEA,  GTE,  and  ATEAC  can  now  close  the  asset

 New  York  corporation.

 11  On  January  7,  2000,  the  Commission  released  a  Public  Notice  requesting  comments  and 
 objections  by  interested  parties. 


 12  These  “drop  down”  transactions  are  as  follows:  (a)  six  of  the  exchanges,  (Haines, 
 Hyder,  Klukwan,  Metlakatla,  Petersburg  and  Wrangell,  comprising  approximately  7,  593  aggregate  access  lines)  are  to  be  transferred  from  ATEAC  to  ATC  (Alaska  Commission  Docket  No.  U-  99- 


 119);  (b)  one  of  the  exchanges  (Barrow,  comprising  approximately  3,693  access  lines)  is  to  be  transferred  from  ATEAC  to  ASTAC  (Docket  No.  U-  99-  120);  (c)  two  of  the  exchanges  (Moose 
 Pass  and  Seward,  comprising  approximately  4,096  aggregate  access  lines)  are  to  be  transferred  from  ATEAC  to  ITC  (Docket  No.  U-  99-  121);  (d)  one  of  the  exchanges  (Nome,  comprising 
 approximately  3,398  access  lines)  is  to  be  transferred  from  ATEAC  to  MTC  (Docket  No.  U-  99-  122);  and  (e)  three  of  the  exchanges  (Bethel,  McGrath  and  Unalakleet,  comprising  approximately 
 5,016  aggregate  access  lines)  are  to  be  transferred  from  ATEAC  to  United-  KUC  (Docket  No.  U-99-  123.  See  Petition,  pp.  3-  4.

 purchase  agreement  transaction  if  the  Commission  grants  GTEA’s  Section  214(  a)  application  13  .  The  Petitioners  further  state  that,  with  the  Alaska  Commission’s  approval  of  the  “drop  down” 
 transactions,  ownership  of  the  thirteen  exchanges  will  pass  to  ATC,  ASTAC,  ITC,  MTC  and  United-  KUC.  14  The  thirteen  exchanges  will  continue  to  be  included  within  the  ATEAC  study  area 
 until  Petitioners  request  and  receive  a  study  area  waiver  from  the  Commission  to  divide  the  ATEAC  Alaska  study  area  and  distribute  the  exchanges  among  existing  study  areas  of  ATC,  ASTAC,  ITC, 
 and  MTC  and  the  new  study  area  of  United-  KUC.  15 
 5.  Petitioners  ATC,  ASTAC,  ITC  and  MTC  are  rate  of  return  carriers  (cost  carriers).  They  are  Issuing  Carriers  in  the  interstate  access  tariffs  of  the  National  Exchange  Carriers 
 Association  (NECA)  and  participants  in  NECA’s  Common  Line  and  Traffic  Sensitive  pools.  United-  KUC  is  not  yet  a  cost  carrier,  but  wishes  to  become  a  cost  carrier,  an  Issuing  Carrier  in 
 NECA  tariffs,  and  would  participate  in  NECA’s  Common  Line  and  Traffic  Sensitive  pools.  ATEAC  states  that,  if  necessary,  it  would  become  a  cost  carrier,  an  Issuing  Carrier  in  the  NECA 
 tariffs,  and  a  participant  in  NECA’s  Common  Line  and  Traffic  Sensitive  pools.  Both  ATEAC  and  United-  KUC  will  be  eligible  to  participate  in  the  NECA  tariffs  and  pools  under  section  69.601  of 
 the  Commission’s  rules.  16 
 6.  Petitioners  state  that  ATEAC,  its  stockholders  and  their  subsidiaries  and  affiliates  have  no  common  stock  ownership  or  other  corporate  affiliations  with  GTE,  GTEA  and  other  GTE 
 subsidiaries  and  affiliates  17  .  They  also  state  that  there  is  no  overlap  in  the  respective  boards  of  directors  or  officers  of  ATEAC,  its  stockholders  and  their  subsidiaries  and  affiliates,  on  the  one 
 hand,  and  GTE,  GTEA  and  other  GTE  subsidiaries  and  affiliates,  on  the  other.  18

 16  As  assignees  of  GTEA,  a  pre-  February  8,  1996  incumbent  local  exchange  carrier, 
 ATEAC  and  United-  KUC  each  will  qualify  as  a  “telephone  company”  under  section  69.  2  (hh)  of  the  Commission’s  rules,  47  C.  F.  R.  §  69.  2  (hh),  and  Section  251(  h)(  1)(  B)(  ii)  of  the 


 Communications  Act,  47  USC  §  251(  h)(  1)(  B)(  ii).  They  would,  therefore,  be  eligible  to  participate  in  the  NECA  tariffs  and  pools  under  section  69.  601  of  the  Commission’s  rules.  47  C.  F.  R.  §

 7.  To  support  its  request  for  a  waiver,  ATEAC  argues  that  the  transaction  involved  in  this  request  is  essentially  identical  to  the  one  involved  in  a  prior  decision  involving  the  Maine 
 Telecommunications  Group,  in  which  the  Commission  granted  a  price  cap  waiver.  19  The  Maine  Waiver  transaction  also  involved  the  sale  of  several  exchanges  within  a  state  to  an  acquisition 
 company  comprised  of  multiple  local  exchange  carriers  operating  within  the  state.  The  Petitioners  state  that,  consistent  with  the  circumstances  involved  in  the  Maine  Waiver,  the  subject  exchanges 
 also  will  be  operated  initially  by  the  LECs  within  the  study  area  of  the  acquisition  company;  pending  a  grant  of  the  study  area  waiver,  the  acquired  exchanges  will  be  distributed  among  the 
 study  areas  of  the  individual  LECs.  20  In  addition,  ATEAC  argues,  in  evaluating  requests  for  waivers  of  the  “all  or  nothing”  rule,  the  Commission  has  generally  taken  into  account  the  preference  of  small 
 carriers  for  rate  of  return  regulation  over  price  cap  regulation.  21 
 8.  Alaska  Communications  System,  Inc.(“  Alaska”)  and  the  National  Telephone  Cooperative  Association  (“  NTCA”)  filed  comments  supporting  a  grant  of  the  waiver.  As  argued  by 
 ATEAC,  both  commentors  state  that  the  policy  justifications  behind  the  section  61.41(  c)  “all  or  nothing  rule"  and  the  section  61.  41(  d)  “permanent  choice”  rule  are  inapplicable  under  the 
 circumstances  surrounding  the  GTE/  GTEA  and  ATEAC  transaction.  These  commentors  assert  that  improper  cost-  shifting  between  rate  of  return  and  price  cap  regulated  affiliates  is  not  likely  to  occur 
 because  Petitioners’  entire  operation  will  be  subject  to  rate  of  return  regulation.  22  Commentors  also  assert  that  the  arms-  length  transfer  between  GTEA  and  the  Petitioners,  two  non-  affiliated 
 companies,  removes  any  opportunity  for  “gaming”  the  system  because  GTEA  will  retain  no  ability  to  bring  the  exchanges  sold  to  Petitioners  back  under  price  caps.  23 


 9.  In  addition,  the  commentors  agree  with  Petitioners  that  the  proposed  transaction  is  in  the  public  interest.  24  Alaska  also  agrees  with  Petitioners  that  price  cap  regulation  may  have  an

 adverse  effect  on,  and  was  not  intended  to  be  applied  to  smaller  LECs.  25  Both  Alaska  and  NTCA  favor  Petitioners’  plan  to  implement  a  system  that  has  local  management  and  is  designed  to  bring 
 enhanced  and  more  responsive  service  to  the  residential  and  business  customers  in  the  thirteen  Alaska  exchanges.  They  also  agree  with  Petitioners  that  the  waiver  would  further  the 
 Commission’s  interest  in  relieving  some  of  the  administrative  burdens  faced  by  small  telephone  companies.  26 


 III.  DISCUSSION 
 10.  For  the  reasons  discussed  below,  we  find  that  the  Petitioners  demonstrate  good  cause  for  waiver  of  sections  61.41(  c)  and  (d)  of  our  rules,  and  that  it  is  in  the  public  interest  to  grant  the 
 Petitioners’  waiver  request.  Under  section  1.3  of  the  Commission's  rules,  "[  a]  ny  provision  of  the  rules  may  be  waived  by  the  Commission  on  its  own  motion  or  on  petition  if  good  cause  therefor  is 
 shown."  27  As  interpreted  by  the  courts,  this  requires  that  a  petitioner  demonstrate  that  "special  circumstances  warrant  a  deviation  from  the  general  rule  and  such  deviation  will  serve  the  public 
 interest."  28  In  this  case,  we  believe  that  ATEAC  has  demonstrated  that  special  circumstances  warrant  a  waiver  of  the  Commission's  rules  and  that  a  waiver  will  serve  the  public  interest. 


 11.  In  the  LEC  Price  Cap  Reconsideration  Order,  the  Commission  addressed  two  concerns  it  had  regarding  mergers  and  acquisitions  involving  price  cap  companies.  29  The  first 
 concern  was  that,  in  the  absence  of  the  “all  or  nothing  rule,”  a  LEC  might  attempt  to  shift  costs  from  its  price  cap  affiliate  to  its  non-  price  cap  affiliate,  allowing  the  non-  price  cap  affiliate  to  charge 
 higher  rates  to  recover  its  increased  revenue  requirement,  while  increasing  the  earnings  of  the  price  cap  affiliate.  30  The  second  concern  was  that,  absent  sections  61.41(  c)  and  (d),  a  LEC  may  have  an 
 incentive  to  "game  the  system"  by  switching  back  and  forth  between  rate  of  return  regulation  and

 price  cap  regulation.  31  The  Commission  noted,  as  an  example,  the  incentive  a  price  cap  company  may  have  to  increase  earnings  by  opting  out  of  price  cap  regulation,  building  a  large  rate  base  under 
 rate  of  return  regulation  so  as  to  raise  rates  and  then,  after  returning  to  price  cap  regulation,  cutting  costs  back  to  an  efficient  level.  32  It  would  not  serve  the  public  interest,  the  Commission  stated,  to 
 allow  a  carrier  alternately  to  "fatten  up"  under  rate  of  return  regulation  and  "slim  down"  under  price  cap  regulation,  because  the  rates  would  not  decrease  in  the  manner  intended  under  price  cap 
 regulation.  33  The  Commission  nonetheless  recognized  that  narrow  waivers  of  these  rules  might  be  justified  if  efficiencies  created  by  the  purchase  and  sale  of  a  few  exchanges  were  to  outweigh  the 
 threat  of  any  gaming.  34 
 12.  The  Petitioners  argue  that  following  completion  of  the  asset  purchase,  neither  ATEAC,  the  Alaska  corporations  by  which  it  is  owned  (AP&  T/  ATC,  ASTAC, 
 TelAlaska/  ITC/  MTC,  and  United/  UUI/  United-  KUC,)  nor  GTE/  GTEA  will  maintain  one  or  more  affiliates  under  price  cap  regulation,  and  one  or  more  affiliates  under  rate  of  return  regulation.  35 
 Neither  ATEAC  nor  any  of  the  Alaska  corporations  by  which  it  is  owned  will  operate  under  price  cap  regulation,  whereas  GTE  and  all  of  its  subsidiaries  and  affiliates  will  remain  under  price  cap 
 regulation.  The  Petitioners  argue  that,  therefore,  there  is  no  danger  of  improper  cost-  shifting  between  price  cap  and  rate  of  return  affiliates.  36  We  agree.  ATEAC’s  acquisition  of  the  thirteen 
 Alaska  exchanges  fails  to  give  rise  to  the  dangers  of  cost-  shifting. 
 13.  ATEAC  also  contends  that  “gaming”  is  not  a  concern.  ATEAC  argues  that  the  transfer  of  the  thirteen  Alaska  exchanges  is  an  "an  arms-  length  sale,"  by  GTEA  to  the  “wholly 
 separate  and  unrelated  ATEAC  (and  ATC,  ASTAC,  ITC,  MTC  and  United-  KUC).  37  ATEAC  argues  that  “there  is  no  possibility  that  GTE  and  its  subsidiaries  and  affiliates  will  be  able  to  ‘game’ 
 the  system”  by  switching  ownership  back  and  forth  between  rate  of  return  regulation  and  price  cap  regulation.  38  GTE/  GTEA  and  its  subsidiaries  will  remain  under  price  cap  regulation,  and  the

 thirteen  Alaska  exchanges  will  be  operated  by  Petitioners,  which  are  unrelated  to,  and  separate  and  apart  from  GTE/  GTEA  and  their  subsidiaries  and  affiliates,  and  totally  outside  of  GTE/  GTEA’s 
 control.  39  We  are  persuaded  that  “gaming”  is  not  a  concern. 
 14.  We  conclude,  therefore,  that  petitioners  have  established  good  cause  to  support  a  waiver  of  our  rules,  and  that  the  waiver  will  serve  the  public  interest.  The  Commission’s  concerns 
 over  cost  shifting  and  gaming  of  the  system  are  not  at  issue  here.  The  size  of  ATEAC  after  acquisition  of  the  Alaska  exchanges  will  be  far  smaller  than  the  LECs  for  which  price  cap  regulation 
 is  mandatory.  40  The  circumstances  of  Petitioners’  request  are  substantially  similar  to  those  involved  in  our  decision  granting  the  Maine  Waiver,  and  to  our  decisions  in  other  cases  involving  sales  of 
 exchanges  by  price  cap  carriers  to  small  rate  of  return  carriers.  41 


 IV.  ORDERING  CLAUSES 
 15.  Accordingly,  IT  IS  ORDERED,  pursuant  to  sections  4(  i)  and  201  of  the  Communications  Act  of  1934,  as  amended,  47  U.  S.  C.  §§  154(  i)  and  201,  and  sections  1.3,  0.91,  and 
 0.291  of  the  Commission's  rules,  47  C.  F.  R.  §§  1.3,  0.91,  and  0.291,  that  ATEAC,  Inc.  ’s,  Alaska  Telephone  Company’s,  Arctic  Slope  Telephone  Association  Cooperative,  Inc.  ’s,  Interior  Telephone 
 Company,  Inc.  ’s,  Mukluk  Telephone  Company,  Inc.  ’s,  and  United-  KUC,  Inc.  ’s  request  for  waiver  of  sections  61.41(  c)  and  (d)  of  the  Commission's  rules,  47  C.  F.  R.  §§  61.41(  c)  and  (d),  IS 
 GRANTED. 


 FEDERAL  COMMUNICATIONS  COMMISSION 


 Mary  Beth  Richards  Deputy  Chief, 
 Common  Carrier  Bureau 
 39  Id. 


 40  In  the  LEC  Price  Cap  Order,  the  Commission  decided  that  small  telephone  companies 
 would  not  be  required  to  operate  under  a  regulatory  regime  that  was  designed  largely  on  the  basis  of  the  historical  performance  of  the  largest  LECs.  The  Commission  therefore  limited  the  mandatory 


 application  of  price  cap  regulation  to  the  regional  Bell  Operating  Companies  and  GTE.  LEC  Price  Cap  Order,  5  FCC  Rcd  at  6818-  19. 


 41  See,  e.  g.,  In  the  Matter  of  Minburn  Communications,  Inc.,  14  FCC  Rcd  14,  184  (1999) 
 (Minburn).
