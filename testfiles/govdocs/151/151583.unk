FEFA HAS INTENSIFIED A LITTLE BIT MORE AND WINDS ARE NOW UP TO 85
KNOTS.  THE EYE IS LARGE BUT RAGGED AND THE BANDING FEATURES AS WELL
AS THE UPPER LEVEL OUTFLOW REMAIN WELL DEFINED.  LATEST OBJECTIVE
T-NUMBERS ARE OSCILLATING BETWEEN 5.0 AND 5.5 ALTHOUGH DURING THE
EARLY MORNING THERE WAS AN ISOLATED T5.8 PEAK.  HOWEVER...FEFA IS
EXPECTED TO MOVE OVER COOLER WATERS WITHIN THE NEXT 24 HOURS
THEREFORE A GRADUAL WEAKENING SHOULD BEGIN THEREAFTER.
 
FEFA HAS BEEN MOVING IN A WEST NORTHWEST TRACK DURING ITS ENTIRE
LIFETIME.  TRACK MODELS BOTH DYNAMICAL AND STATISTICAL INDICATE NO
CHANGE IN THIS MOTION FOR THE NEXT 72 HOURS.  THE OFFICIAL FORECAST
IS IN AGREEMENT WITH GUIDANCE WITH PERHAPS SOME SLIGHT DECREASE IN
FORWARD SPEED.
