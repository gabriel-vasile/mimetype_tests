             In the Matter of TRI-STATE MOTOR TRANSIT COMPANY

     Jeffrey J. Thurston, Director, Office of Transportation

appearing for General Services Administration.

     Col. James F. Quinn, Staff Judge Advocate, Headquarters,
Military Traffic Management Command, Department of the Army,
Falls Church, VA, appearing for Department of Defense.

GOODMAN, Board Judge.

     Claimant, Tri-State Motor Transit Company, has requested
review of the General Services Administration (GSA) Office of
Transporation Audits (OTA) denial of its claims for alleged
excess released value charges on trucks, trailers, vans, and
other vehicles moved by claimant during 1991 pursuant to thirteen
Government bills of lading (GBLs).  We conclude that claimant is
entitled to the claimed amounts.

     The thirteen GBLs classified the freight as Freight All
Kinds (FAK) falling within Department of Defense (DoD) unique
codes 999912 or 999913, but in a few cases identified the freight
by  National Motor Freight Classification items which pertain to
specific vehicles.  In all cases, the GBL was annotated in either
block 15 or 18 with some variation of the statement "Released
value not exceeding $2.50 [or $1.75] per pound per article."  The
weight of the vehicles was such that multiplying the applicable
per pound rate (either $1.75 or $2.50) by the weight of the
article resulted in a released value of more than $20,000.  

     Claimant originally billed the Government for each shipment
based upon the stated FAK designation without any charges for
excess valuation coverage.  Upon audit, claimant determined,
based upon the released value annotations, that it was entitled
to "excess valuation charges" and submitted claims for the
following additional amounts:

          GBL D-0,506,147     $ 21.30
          GBL E-0,723,974     $ 63.75
          GBL E-0,723,971     $ 63.75 
          GBL E-0,723,961     $216.30 
          GBL E-0,508,170     $  4.20
          GBL E-0,983,750     $ 81.00 
          GBL E-0,723,833     $ 38.25
          GBL D-1,010,650     $ 57.45
          GBL D-0,559,001     $ 42.75
          GBL E-0,861,337     $122.10
          GBL E-0,983,748     $ 21.00
          GBL E-1,123,617     $ 49.05
          GBL E-1,123,616     $ 49.05

     Claimant computed these amounts using the methodology set
forth in Military Traffic Management Command (MTMC) Freight
Traffic Rules Publication No. 1A, Item 190.  Taking GBL D-
0,506,147 as a representative example, claimant figured the
released value of the truck by taking $1.75 per pound, the
released value stated in box 18 of the GBL, multiplied by the
weight of the truck, 19,490 pounds, to arrive at a total released
value of $34,107.50.  Claimant then determined the excess
declared value to be $14,107.50 ($34,107.50 less the default
released value of $20,000).  Claimant then rounded this amount up
to $14,200 (the next $100).  Claimant applied the rate of $.15
for every $100 to arrive at an excess valuation charge of $21.30. 
Similar computations were performed for each of the twelve other
GBLs to arrive at the amounts claimed.

     GSA issued settlement certificates which disallowed all of
the claims, maintaining that the released value statements on the
thirteen GBLs do not entitle claimant to amounts beyond those
originally claimed based upon the FAK designation.  Claimant
requested review of the GSA's denial of the thirteen GBLs by the
General Accounting Office (GAO), which GAO docketed as B-266046. 
GAO did not issue a decision, but did issue a letter dated
December 12, 1995, which reads, in relevant part:

     We acknowledge receipt of your letter . . . requesting
     review of the . . . GSA['s] denial of Tri-State's
     claims with respect to government bill of lading D-
     0,506,147 and 12 other transactions. 

     As you suggest, GSA's settlements appear to be contrary
     to our decision Tri-State Motor Transit Company-
     Reconsideration, B-254378.2 et al., July 5, 1995.  Your
     letter to the . . . Administrator of General Services
     . . . indicates that you are attempting to enforce our
     July 5, 1995, decision within GSA.  If you are
     unsuccessful with the Administrator, you may have to
     pursue other remedies.  We have clearly stated our
     position on this matter, and we have nothing further to
     add.

     We will maintain this letter as evidence of your
     request for review . . . .  Please advise if you
     believe there are further steps we can take.

     We consider the last paragraph of the above-quoted letter as
an indication that the matter remained pending, and had not been
resolved by GAO.  Since the issuance of GAO's letter, the
Comptroller General's responsibility for review of OTA decisions
has been transferred by statute to the Administrator of General
Services.  Pub. L. No. 104-316,  202(o)(2), 100 Stat. 3826, 3844
(1996).  By delegation, this Board now exercises this review
function on behalf of the Administrator in transportation rate
cases.  This matter remained pending at GAO until July 1997, when
it was transferred to this Board.

     The Government maintains that the released value statements
on the GBLs do not entitle claimant to the additional amounts
claimed.  Both this Board and GAO have considered this "released
valuation" issue in circumstances factually identical to those in
the instant case and have concluded that the Government's
position is not correct.  McGil Specialized Carriers, GSBCA
14127-RATE (Sept. 30, 1997); Tri-State Motor Transit Co., GSBCA
13839-RATE, 97-1 BCA  28,953; Tri-State Motor Transit Co., GSBCA
13746-RATE, 97-1 BCA  28,951; Tri-State Motor Transit
Co.--Reconsideration, B-254378.2, et al. (July 5, 1995).  We
follow our earlier decisions.  Claimant is entitled to the
amounts claimed as additional payment for the shipment covered by
the GBLs at issue.
