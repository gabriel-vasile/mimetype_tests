  Description:
    Abstract:
      The objective of this research was to collect new bathymetry for all
      of Florida Bay, digitize the historical shoreline and bathymetric
      data, compare previous data to modern data, and produce maps and
      digital grids of historical and modern bathymetry.
    Purpose:
      Detailed, high-resolution maps of Florida Bay mudbank elevations are
      needed to understand sediment dynamics and provide input into water
      quality and circulation models. The bathymetry of Florida Bay had not
      been systematically mapped in nearly 100 years, and some shallow areas
      of the bay have never been mapped. An  accurate, modern bathymetric
      survey provides a baseline for assessing future sedimentation rates in
      the Bay, and a foundation for developing a sediment budget.  Due to
      the complexity of the Bay and age of existing data, a current
      bathymetric grid (digitally derived from the survey) is critical for
      numerical models.

      Numerical circulation and sediment transport models being developed
      for the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Program are being used to
      address water quality issues in Florida Bay.  Application of  these
      models is complicated due to the complex seafloor topography
      (basin/mudbank morphology) of the Bay.  The only complete topography
      data set of the Bay is 100 years old.  Consequently, an accurate,
      modern seafloor bathymetry map of the Bay is critical for numerical
      modeling research. A  modern bathymetry data set will also permit a
      comparison to historical data in order to help access sedimentation
      rates within the Bay.

        Thirteen new temporary ground-control points or benchmarks (surveyed
        to within 1 cm to 2 cm accuracy) were established throughout the Bay
        for use as reference receiver sites. The thirteen benchmarks were
        surveyed using Ashtech Z-12, 12 channel dual-frequency GPS
        receivers.  Full-phase carrier data were recorded on each occupied
        benchmark in Ashtech proprietary BIN format with daily occupations
        ranging from 6 to 12 hours. BIN files were then converted to RINEX-2
        format and position determined by the National Aeronautics and Space
        Administrations (NASA) Jet Propulsion Laboratory GIPSY system
        software. The GIPSY derived positions were provided in ITRF96
        coordinate system for each (daily) occupation. Using National
        Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/National Geodetic Survey
        (NOAA/NGS) software HTDPv2.3, ITRF96 positions were transformed to
        NAD83/GRS80 positions. The computed daily positions were then
        averaged to derive a final benchmark location and elevation.

      Process_Description:
        Florida bay was mapped by using a shallow-draft boat equipped with a
        high-precision Global Positioning System (GPS) coupled with a
        high-precision depth sounder. To accomplish this task, SANDS (System
        for Accurate Nearshore Depth Surveying) was developed by Mark Hansen
        and Jeff List of the U.S. Geological Survey. SANDS utilizes
        differential GPS receivers, a digital fathometer, a heave-roll-pitch
        sensor, and a shallow-draft boat. The SANDS system is accurate to
        approximately 4 cm horizontally and 8 cm vertically and collects
        data in water depths as shallow as 30 cm. To achieve this accuracy,
        the boat's roving distance from any one GPS reference receiver
        location must be within a 10-kilometer radius.

        Data was collected on a USGS 7.5-minute quadrangle-by-quadrangle
        basis, proceeding westward from Blackwater Sound. The trackline
        spacing varied depending upon the relief of the sea floor; that is,
        closer spacing adjacent to mudbanks and wider spacing in the basins.
         Tracklines were surveyed in a north-south orientation, and
        crossings (intersecting tracklines) were surveyed in an east-west
        orientation.  Crossing lines are critical because they served as a
        check on the accuracy of the system. In theory, data values at the
        crossing should be exactly the same. In reality, this is not always
        the case due to random errors of each sensor. Eighty-five percent of
        the crossings in this data set were within +/- 6 cm with the balance
        within +/- 20 cm.

        Ideally, crossings are made at the end of the survey day, however,
        some of the crossings were made months and even years after an area
        was initially surveyed. The results are very good considering the
        soft bottom characteristics of Florida Bay.
