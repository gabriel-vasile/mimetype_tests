  Description:

    Abstract:

      This metadata describes thirteen different geo-referenced tif images.  Hand colored geological mapped data of the area in Sanders and Lincoln counties, Montana and Kootenai, Bonner, Benewah, and Shoshone counties, Idaho were converted to digital format (TIFF). These data were donated to US Geological Survey by the mineral industry. The area lies in the western part of the Belt Basin and contains metasedimentary rocks of Middle Proterozoic age. The area mainly contains rocks of the Prichard, Burke, Revett, St. Regis, Wallace, Empire and Spokane formations. The source maps were scanned on an Ideal FSC 6010 36" width color pass through scanner at 200 ppi as 8 bit indexed color or in two instances at the 24 bit color level.  Images were registered and rectified to provided neatline coverages in Universal Transverse Mercator zone 11 projection using ArcView Image Analysis Extension, version 1.1.  The source maps were non-published Asarco company maps representing different geographical areas.  Tif image names and their corresponding descriptions belonging to the Cabinet Mountains Reconnaissance program include: Pl1R - Geologic map, Lincoln Co., MT, Pl2R - Geology and section location of southwestern Lincoln County, Pl3AR - plate 3a, Pl3BR - plate 3b -Geologic map Sanders Co., MT and Shoshone Co., Pl4R –1981 Cabinet Mountains Reconn. Program, Troy type Cu-Ag deposits, ID, Pl5AR - Plate 5a, Pl5BR - plate 5b - Geologic map Troy Type Cu-Ag deposits and shale-hosted Pb-Zn-Ag deposits, Bonner, Kootenai, and Shoshone Co.'s, ID, Pl6R - Geologic map Troy Type Cu-Ag deposits and shale-hosted Pb-Zn-Ag deposits, Kootenai and Benewah Counties, ID, Pl7R - Geologic map Troy type Cu-Ag deposits Benewah, Kootenai, and Shoshone Co.'s Idaho, Pl8R - Geologic map Troy-Type Cu-Ag deposits Shoshone, Co., Idaho and Mineral Co., MT., Pl9R - Geologic map Troy-Type Cu-Ag deposits, Sanders and Mineral Co., MT, PLGTMTR - Goat Mtn. and Brooks Mtn. mineralized zone Mineral County, Montana.  The following image name belongs to the Troy West Project: TROYR - Troy Mine Area, Lincoln Co., MT.

    Purpose: This dataset was created to provide raster images of the Asarco company maps of the area located in Sanders and Lincoln counties, Montana and Kootenai, Bonner, Benewah and Shoshone counties, Idaho.
