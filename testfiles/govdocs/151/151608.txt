     This document presents the carbon dioxide concentration data in surface water and the
atmosphere collected during the Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL) expeditions
during 1986-1989.  Carbon dioxide was measured quasi-continuously on 5 PMEL expeditions (12
legs) in the Pacific and Indian Oceans.  These cruises were conducted under support from the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
     Carbon dioxide measurements in the atmosphere and in surface water were made by
analyzing of mixing ratios of CO2 with an automated, temperature-controlled gas
chromatographic system described by Murphy et al. (1991) and Bates et al. (1993).  
Instrument precision was determined by the average percent standard deviation of the standard 
response over a 6-hour period.  The precision varied between cruises but was always less than 
1.2% and was more typically around 0.4%. 
     Air was pumped through 3/8-inch diameter, plastic-coated, aluminum tubing from the jackstaff
on the bow of the ship (10 meters above the sea surface) to the oceanographic laboratory for
analysis. Surface seawater entered the ship via a forward intake line located approximately 5
meters below the water level.
     Fifteen files are described in this report and distributed along with it including one 
documentation file (ndp047.txt) that provides an overview of the cruise network and describes details
on the content and format of the thirteen data files; one FORTRAN 77 retrieval code (pmeldat.for) 
that may be used to read and print any of the data files; and thirteen data files, one (pmel8689.dat) 
that contains the data from all twelve legs, and separate files (12 total) for each leg. Each of the 
data files contains the same variables: cruise name; date (day, month, year); day of the year 
[Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)]; latitude and longitude (in decimal degrees); cumulative distance since 
the first sampling location on the leg; sea surface temperature (degrees C); warming temperature 
[indicates the degrees of warming (degrees C) for seawater as it transited from the intake line 
to the analysis site]; sea surface salinity; atmospheric pressure; reported atmospheric CO2
concentration,[X(CO2)]air which is the mole fraction of the dried air pumped from the bow line; reported 
surfase seawater CO2, concentration [X(CO2)]sw which is the mole fraction of the dried vapor drown 
from the equilibrator headspace; the calculated fugacity values for the air [f(CO2)air] and seawater 
[f(CO2)sw] given in the data tables are in situ fugacities which have been corrected for the warming 
of the seawater; and quality flags.
     The data set is available, free of charge, as a Numeric Data Package (NDP) from CDIAC.
The NDP consists of printed documentation and machine-readable files.  The data files also available 
on 9-track magnetic tape; IBM-formatted floppy diskettes; 8-mm tapes; 150-mB, quarter-inch tape cartridge;
and from CDIAC's anonymous File Transfer Protocol (FTP) area via Internet.  Printed document also contains an
Appendix, which is a full reprint of NOAA Technical Memorandum ERL PMEL-101 authored by Murphy et al. 1994, 
which fully describes cruise information, sampling methods and instrumentation, and defines limitations and 
restrictions of the data.

                                    1. BACKGROUND INFORMATION


     A dramatic increase in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) has been
directly observed over the past 30 years (Keeling et al, 1989). Although the present growth rate
of CO2 in the atmosphere is about 3.4 gigatons of carbon per year (GtC/yr), the present estimate
of anthropogenic CO2 sources to the atmosphere is much larger (approximately 6 GtC/yr; IPCC,
1990). Most of the CO2 (77%) released to the atmosphere originates from the combustion of
fossil fuels (Marland and Rotty, 1989). The remainder is estimated to originate from deforestation
and changing land use patterns (IPCC, 1990). Since the growth rate of CO2 in the atmosphere
is less than the rate of carbon release, some of the anthropogenic carbon released to the
atmosphere must be absorbed by either the terrestrial biosphere or the oceans.
     The oceans have been suggested as a repository for carbon dioxide from the atmosphere
through a chemical and biological pathway. Carbon dioxide dissolves readily in the surface
oceans. The dissolved gas reacts with water to form carbonic acid which rapidly dissociates to
bicarbonate and carbonate ions. Ocean plants can also draw down CO2, some of which is
converted to particulate matter which sinks out of surface waters.
     The uncertain role of the ocean in absorbing anthropogenic carbon from the atmosphere
has stimulated interest in the cycling and fate of carbon in the sea. PMEL has made
measurements on 12 cruise legs (5 expeditions) between 1986 and 1989 to determine the
concentrations of trace gases in the atmosphere and in surface seawater. The purpose of this
report is to present the CO2 results and to show the calculations which have been used to convert
the raw values to fugacities in units of microatmospheres (uatm).

                     1.1 General Discussion of CO2 Measurements and Fugacity

     Field measurements of carbon dioxide gas concentrations are often observed as the mole
fraction of CO2 in an aliquot of dried vapor. The concentration of CO2 expressed as the mole
fraction in dry air is an absolute and observable quantity, but is not necessarily the quantity
which geochemists need to evaluate air-sea fluxes or to examine the relationship of dissolved
CO2  with other carbonate parameters. Geochemical assessments generally require the correction
of CO2 concentrations from the measurement units and conditions to units of microatmospheres
at the in situ sea surface conditions. Partial pressures of CO2  in units of uatm have been
historically reported, but in recent years, fugacities have also been reported. We here offer a brief
discussion of the distinction between fugacity and partial pressure, and the motivation for using
fugacity in this report.
     Fugacity is an expression for the concentration of a real gas in a mixture of real gases,
whereas partial pressure is an expression for the concentration of an ideal gas in a mixture of 
ideal gases. Ideal gases are conceptualized as comprising molecules which occupy no volume and
between which no forces exist. The concept of fugacity is introduced in order to use for real
gases the thermodynamic relationships established for ideal gases. Fugacity cannot be measured
directly, as pressure is, yet the basis for discussion of equilibrium, solubility, etc. is based on the
thermodynamic quantity of fugacity, not on the observable quantity of pressure.
     The thermodynamic equation of state for ideal gases is PV=nRT, where P is pressure, V
is volume, n is number of moles of gas, R is the gas constant, and T is absolute temperature.
This equation can be used to convert the number of moles of pure, ideal gas to the pressure of
the gas. If we make a plot of pressure vs. PV/nRT for pure nitrogen (N2), pure carbon dioxide
(CO2), and a pure ideal gas, we can see that an ideal gas is a line with  zero slope and
y-intercept=1. Nitrogen approximates an ideal gas at low pressures, but becomes less ideal at
higher pressures as the volume of the molecules becomes significant relative to the total volume.
CO2 is a highly non-ideal gas, even at low pressures. The negative deviation from ideality at low
pressures suggests attractive forces between CO2 molecules. The significance of this factor
becomes less important at higher pressures. The approximation of ideality for CO2 may be
acceptable at ambient pressures when high accuracy is not required.  The difference between
pressure and fugacity for a typical ambient CO2 concentration is 1 to 1.5 uatm (~0.3%) over the
temperature range 0 to 30 C. These calculations assume a binary gas mixture of CO2 and air,
where air is treated as a homogeneous gas. For this report, fugacities rather than partial pressures
are reported.

     The fugacities were calculated according to equations given in Murphy et al. (1994). The
fugacity calculations use observations of dry gas concentrations in units of parts per million, sea
surface temperature, equilibrator temperature, sea surface salinity, and atmospheric pressure. The
relative humidity is assumed to be 100% at the sea surface. The vapor pressure of seawater is
calculated from temperature and salinity, and the functional relationship between gas solubility
and temperature used is from Weiss et al. (1982). The fugacity values given in the data tables
are the in situ fugacities which have been corrected for the warming of the seawater in transiting
to the equilibrator.
     The mole fraction values given in the data tables are the dry gas concentrations at the in
situ temperature. For the air values, the reported concentration, X(CO2)air, is the mole fraction
of the dried air pumped from the bow line. For the water values, the reported concentration,
X(CO2)sw, is the mole fraction of the dried vapor drown from the equilibrator headspace which
has been converted to fugacity, corrected for warming, and converted back to mole fraction.
     The warming values provided in the data tables indicate the degrees of warming ( C) for
seawater as it transited from the intake line to the analysis site. The warming values were derived
from the regression of hourly warming on hourly sea surface temperature. Detailed information
on the temperatures data and analyses for each of these cruises are provided in Murphy et al.
(1993).

                                          2. METHODS

                   2.1 Measurement of CO2 in the Atmosphere and in Surface Seawater

     Carbon dioxide measurements in the atmosphere and in surface water were made on these
cruises by Kimberly Kelly. Mixing ratios of CO2 were analyzed with an automated,
temperature-controlled gas chromatographic system similar to that described by Weiss (1981),
and Bates et al. (1993). Every 12 minutes one of four gases (atmospheric sample, standard 1,
equilibrator vapor sample, or standard 2) was injected for analysis. Details of sample collection,
gas standard calibration, and data reduction follow.
     Air was pumped through 3/8-inch O.D. plastic-coated aluminum tubing (Decoron) from
the jackstaff on the bow of the ship, 10 meters above the sea surface, to the oceanographic
laboratory for analysis. This line was continuously flushed at 8-10 L/min. Aliquots from this air
stream were dried using phosphorous pentoxide and 2 milliliters were injected into a gas
chromatograph (GC) where CO2 was separated from the other gases, catalytically reduced to
methane, and routed to the flame ionization detector. The instrument response was compared with
the response of standard gases for quantification. The standard gases were dried and treated in
exactly the same manner as the air and equilibrator samples. 
     Surface seawater entered the ship's seachest via a forward intake line located
approximately 5 meters below the water level. From the seachest, the water was pumped up to
a showerhead-type Plexiglas equilibrator designed by R. Weiss (Butler et al., 1988). Water rains
through the equilibrator at 15-20 L/min and the gases dissolved in the seawater partition between
the aqueous and vapor phases according to their solubilities at the temperature and salinity of the
seawater in the equilibrator. Aliquots of the equilibrator vapor phase were sampled, dried, and
analyzed as described above for atmospheric samples.
     The gas standards were dried, whole-air mixtures contained in aluminum cylinders. The
working standards were calibrated against the primary standards before and after the 1987, 1988,
and 1989 cruises. The primary standards (CC48232 - 352.47 ppm, CC48302 - 355.97 ppm,
CC48314 - 353.39 ppm) were filled and calibrated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration/Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory (NOAA/CMDL) in February
1987. Subsequent calibrations of these primary standards by CMDL in November 1987, June
1990 and August 1990 have shown that the CO2 mixing ratios remained constant during this 3.5
year period. The CO2 mixing ratios in the working standards ranged from 228.15 ppm to 460.43
ppm. The working standards were calibrated by CMDL in 1990. These calibrations agreed to
within 0.5% of the values assigned to each tank by PMEL based on the primary standards and
a linear FID detector response. The data reported here have been reduced using the CMDL
calibrations of the working standards. The mixing ratios reported here are in the
World Meteorological Organization (WMO) X85 scale (Thoning et al., 1987). The accuracies of
the CO2 standards are given by CMDL as +/- 0.6% by comparison with the manometric analyses
of C. D. Keeling at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Instrument precision was determined
by the average percent standard deviation of the standard response over a 6-hour period. The
precision varied between cruises but was always less than 1.2% and was more typically around
0.4% (Table 2).

     The CO2 mixing ratios in the air and equilibrator samples were calculated as follows. The
data were first visually filtered to eliminate any episodes of ship contamination. These episodes
were quit evident from the extremely high carbon monoxide values that were measured
simultaneously. The mixing ratios of CO2 in both the air and equilibrator samples were then
computed based on peak area and either a 4- hour or 6-hour running mean single-point standard.
These dry-air mixing ratios were then binned into hourly values based on the measurements made
30 minutes before and after the hour.

                             2.2 Ancillary measurements

     The ancillary measurements used to calculate in situ CO2 concentrations in the
atmospheric and surface seawater samples are sea surface temperature, temperature of seawater
in the equilibrator, salinity, and atmospheric pressure. Surface seawater temperature was measured
near the bow intake line on most cruises with a thermosalinograph provided by the ship. The
temperature of seawater in the equilibrator was measured by mercury thermometer and
thermistors. Salinity was taken from the thermosalinograph located near the bow intake line, and
atmospheric pressure was recorded hourly from a barometer located on the bridge deck of the
ships.

                       3. CRUISE DESCRIPTIONS AND DATA RESULTS.

     All dates and times given in the text and the data files are Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).
North latitudes and east longitudes are listed as positive values. South latitudes and west
longitudes are given as negative values. The data flags used in the tables follow the WOCE water
sample quality flag definitions. The value 2 in the flag column indicates acceptable X(CO2) sw
data; the value 3 indicates questionable X(CO2)sw data; the value 5 indicates not reported data;
and letter P in the flag column indicates questionable latitude and/or longitude.
     Positional data were checked against the available ship log records using two methods.
First, plots of time vs. latitude and of time vs. longitude were made for each cruise. A given
point was checked against the marine operations abstracts (moas) if it was judged to be
sufficiently far from the trend. A second check was made by plotting time vs. the distance
travelled in an hour. Most of the data show the ship speeds between 0 and 20 knots, but a few
points suggested much higher speeds. The positions were checked against the moas if the speeds
exceeded 25 knots. Since the original ship log records for the 1987 SAGA II expedition were not
available for this comparison, the data were compared against the 3-hour positional data provided.
No obvious problems were found with this record, and so the hourly positions, interpolated from
the 3-hour record were used without corrections. These errors could decrease the cumulative
distance totals for the SAGA II expeditions by several hundred kilometers.

                                   3.1 EPOCS 1986

     The EPOCS cruise designated EP2-86-OC began on 21 May (Day 141) 1986 aboard the
NOAA Research Vessel (R/V) Oceanographer. The ship departed from Balboa, Panama and
headed southwest to the equator at 97W. The cruise track continued west along the equator,
diverting for mooring work along 110W and 140W. The cruise continued northwest from the
equator at 143W, ending in Honolulu, Hawaii on 20 June (Day 171). CTD and oxygen
measurements for this track are reported in Lynch et al. (1988). Chlorofluorocarbon (CFC)
measurements are reported by Wisegarver et al. (1993).
     The mean atmospheric Fugacity, f(CO2)air, for this equatorial track was 334.7 +/- 1.1
uatm. Surface seawater values, f(CO2)sw, ranged between ~410 uatm and 430 uatm along the
equator from 90W to 112W. Concentration dropped sharply (to ~370 uatm) when the ship
diverted north into fresher, warmer waters to the north of 3N. f(CO2)sw rose to ~420 uatm as
the cruise track returned to the equator, but dropped to ~360 uatm as the ship moved away from
the equator near 143W, 6N. Concentrations continued low (~350 uatm) into Hawaii. The mean
percent standard deviation of the standard gases on this leg was <1%.
     Seven points were anomalously low on this track. They are flagged in the data files.

                                    3.2 RITS/CO2 1986

     The RITS/CO2 cruise was continuation of the EPOCS 1986 cruise. The NOAA R/V
Oceanographer sailed from Hawaii on 1 July (Day 182) and headed northeast, southeast,
northeast, north along 135/145W, and into Kodiak, Alaska on 23 July (Day 204).  
     Mean atmospheric f(CO2) along this section was 342.41 uatm with values ranging from
337 near 20N to 350 uatm near 52N. Surface seawater concentrations were near equilibrium or
slightly undersaturated north of Hawaii to 30N. Supersaturations of ~15 uatm persisted from 30N
but the waters became undersaturated by ~34uatm near 45N. f(CO2)sw remained slightly
undersaturated along 50N, but dropped to ~290 uatm as the ship continued north and into the
Gulf of Alaska.
     The mean percent standard  deviation of the standard gases on this leg was <0.7%.

                            3.3 SAGA II 1987, Kamchatka Transit

     The expedition aboard the Russian vessel Akademik Korolev began in Hilo, Hawaii. The
portion from Hilo to the Kuril Trench off Kamchatka, began 1 May (Day 121) 1987, and is
termed the Kamchatka Transit.  Data were collected sporadically along this transit, so the record
is not continuous. The available surface seawater concentrations indicate general undersaturation
by up to 50 uatm relative to atmospheric values. Surface water values were high approaching the
Kuril Trench, but dropped sharply (from 412 to 256 uatm) over an hour near 48N. This steep
gradient was also found by Butler et al. (1988) and attributed to high primary productivity. The
mean percent standard deviation of the standard gases on this leg was 0.24%.

                                 3.4 SAGA II 1987, Leg 1

     Leg 1 began on 8 May (Day 128) from the Kuril Trench region and followed the 160E
meridian south to 5S. After a jog to the east, the track continued south along the 170E meridian
into Wellington, New Zealand on 9 June (Day 160). 
     Atmospheric values were near 350 uatm in the north, dropping to 330 uatm just south of
the equator and increasing to 345 uatm near 45S. Surface seawater values were high leaving the
Kuril Trench area, but dropped to ~260 uatm near 40N. To the south f(CO2)sw increased to near
saturation but dropped to ~300 uatm near 10S. Surface water values remained near 300 uatm as
the ship continued south, but increased sharply as the ship approached New Zealand. The mean
percent standard deviation of the standard gases on this leg was 0.24%.

                                   3.5 SAGA II 1987, Leg 2

     Leg 2 began out of Wellington on 12 June (Day 163) heading west into the Indian Ocean
and concluding in Singapore on 6 July (Day 187).
     Atmospheric f(CO2) ranged from a low of 332 uatm near the end of the track to 349 uatm
off the west coast of New Zealand. Surface seawater values were highly variable along this track,
ranging from 290 to 410 uatm. The mean percent standard deviation of the standard gases on this
leg was 0.24%.

                                       3.6 TEW-3 1987

     The NOAA Ship Oceanographer departed Townsville, Australia on 13 July (Day 194) for
the TW3- 87-OC cruise and steamed northeast to 5S, 165E for station work in the Samoan
Passage. The ship then continued north along 165E and into Kwajalein, Micronesia on 27 July
(Day 208). Details of the CTD temperature, salinity, and oxygen data are given by Mangum et
al. (1991).
     The mean atmospheric value for this section was 334.01 +/- 1.11 uatm. Surface seawater
CO2 was largely undersaturated through the Coral Sea but increased rapidly to 353 uatm near
5S. Water values remained near saturation or supersaturated north to 1S. Across the equator
surface seawater was undersaturated as far north as 2N, but dropped again quickly to
undersaturation from 2N and north into Kwajalein. The mean percent standard deviation of the
standard gases on this leg was 0.32%.

                                      3.7 RITS/CO2 1987

     The RITS/CO2 cruise was an continuation of the TEW-3 cruise, beginning on 29 July
(Day 210) from Kwajalein. The cruise track continued north along 165E to 50N and then east
into Dutch Harbor, Alaska. After a brief stop in Dutch Harbor on Days 233/234, the ship
continued east along 50N and then into Seattle, Washington on 28 August (Day 240).
     Atmospheric f(CO2) values were steady at 334 uatm out of Kwajalein, but ranged from
330 to 343 uatm along the cruise track. Surface seawater CO2 was supersaturated from Kwajalein
north to 36N. f(CO2)sw dropped sharply to 264 uatm near 40N and remained undersaturated until
the ship diverted from its eastward track north into Dutch Harbor. After the ship returned to 50N
f(CO2)sw returned to undersaturation. Values climbed to 375 uatm near 50N, 152W and then
decreased to near- or undersaturation as the ship moved east and into Seattle. The mean percent
standard deviation of the standard gases on this leg was 0.32%.

                                      3.8 RITS/CO2 1988

     The RITS/CO2 1988 cruise began on 6 April (Day 97) aboard the NOAA ship
Oceanographer. They sailed from Dutch Harbor to the south along 170W to American Samoa,
arriving on 5 May (Day 126).
     Atmospheric f(CO2) was highest near to the north (357 uatm) and generally decreased
to ~ 335 uatm to the south along this track. Seawater f(CO2) values were low out of Dutch
Harbor, but rose to 384 uatm near 48N and then dropped gradually to <300 uatm near 34N. This
undersaturation persisted as far south as 10N. The surface waters across the equator from 10N
to 6S were supersaturated by as much as 96 uatm relative to the atmosphere. Near 6N the f(CO2)
values dropped sharply to undersaturation which persisted into Samoa. The mean percent standard
deviation of the standard gases in this leg was 0.60%.

                                        3.9 EPOCS 1988

     The EPOCS 1988 cruise was a continuation of RITS/CO2. R/V Oceanographer sailed out
of  Samoa on 9 May (Day 130) north to the equator. They then continued east along the equator
to 140W and then north to Honolulu, Hawaii on 4 June (Day 156). The temperature, salinity, and
oxygen data from CTD measurements made on this cruise are given in Mangum et al. (1993).
     Atmospheric f(CO2) was lowest near Samoa (333 uatm) and increased to the north,
reaching 345 uatm near 15N. Surface seawater values were also lowest near Samoa, but increased
toward the equator. Supersaturation persisted along equator (~430 uatm), but CO2 concentrations
dropped to near-saturation north of 5N and into Hawaii. The mean percent standard deviation of
the standard gases on this leg was 0.21%. Two values were anomalously high on this track. They
are flagged in the data set.

                                    3.10 RITS/CO2 1989, Leg 1
 
     The NOAA R/V Discoverer left Seattle on 5 February (Day 37) 1989. After two brief
stops in San Diego and then Manzanillo, Mexico, the ship continued southward along
105W/110W and into Easter Island on 1 March.
     Atmospheric values were high off Baja, California, but dropped to a relatively stable value
of ~339 uatm between 10N and Easter Island. Surface seawater values were supersaturated off
Baja, but dropped to neat-saturation to the south. The pattern of f(CO2) across the equator is
complex, rising to 423 uatm  near 2S, dropping to saturation and then increasing to a maximum
of 481 uatm at 4S. From there the values dropped slowly reaching 354 uatm near 16S. From 16S
to Easter Island, surface seawater was supersaturated by up to 60 uatm. The mean percent
standard deviation of the standard gases on this leg was 0.37%.

                                   3.11 RITS/CO2 1989, Leg 2

     Leg 2 began on 4 March (Day 63), with R/V Discoverer continuing south along 105W
to 60S. The cruise track then turned northwest and the ship arrived in Tahiti on 2 April (Day 92). 
     Atmospheric values were quite variable along this section, ranging from 328 uatm near
60S to 353 uatm near 45S. Surface seawater values were ~380 uatm south from Easter Island to
40S where they dropped to near-saturation. Surface seawater f(CO2) dropped suddenly near 61S
from 332 to 266 uatm within 1 hour and stayed low for several  hours. The system was  shut
down to remove krill from the equilibrator and to check instrument performance. When the
system was started again near 58S, seawater f(CO2) had returned to equilibrium values. Seawater
values close to saturation persisted into Tahiti. One anomalously high value (near 58S) is flagged
in data file. The mean percent standard deviation of the standard gases on this leg was 0.37%.

                                   3.12 RITS/CO2 1989, Leg 3

     The final leg of the 1989 cruise began 7 April (Day 97) from Tahiti and ended 20 April
(Day 110) in Seattle. 
     Atmospheric f(CO2) values were 334 uatm in the southern hemisphere and rose to a high
of 350 uatm approaching Seattle. Surface seawater values were oversaturated from Tahiti, and
peaked at 440 uatm just south of the equator (2S), dropping to saturation near 14N. Seawater
remained near- or under-saturated from 14N and dropped sharply on the approach to coastal
waters. The mean percent standard deviation of the standard gases on this leg was 0.37%.


                              4. DATA CHECKS PERFORMED BY CDIAC

     An important part of the numeric data package (NDP) preparation process at the Carbon Dioxide
Information Analysis Center (CDIAC) involves the quality assurance (QA) of data before
distribution.  Data received at CDIAC are rarely in a condition that would permit immediate
distribution, regardless of the source.  To guarantee data of the highest possible quality, CDIAC
conducts extensive QA reviews.  Reviews involve examining the data for completeness,
reasonableness, and accuracy.  Although they have common objectives, these reviews are tailored
to each data set, often requiring extensive programming efforts.  In short, the QA process is a
critical component in the value-added concept of supplying accurate, usable data for researchers.
     The following summarizes the QA checks performed by CDIAC on the data obtained during the
1986-1989 PMEL cruises in Pacific and Indian Oceans.

1. These data were provided to CDIAC as twelve ASCII-formatted files with accompanying printed 
   documentation (NOAA Technical Memorandum ERL PMEL-101). A FORTRAN 77 retrieval program was
   written and used to reformat the original twelwe files into twelwefiles with identical formats
   and to merge all data into a single file that was sorted and arranged chronologically.

2. All data were plotted to check for obvious outliers.

3. Dates, times, and coordinates were checked for bogus values (e.g., values of DAY <1 or >31;
   YEAR <1986 or >1989; DAYGMT <1.000 or >365.999; LAT <-90.000 or >90.000; LONG <-180.000 or >180.000).

4. All cruise tracks were plotted and compered with the maps and cruise information supplied by
   Murphy et al. (1994).

5. The data quality flags for missing values, given as "-99" in the original data files, were changed
   to "5". The data accuracy quality flags, also given as "-99" in the original data files, were changed 
   to "2". These changes reflect the quality flag definitions specified by the WOCE Hydrographic Program 
   (WHP) Data Reporting Requirements (1991).  Under these guidelines, "5" and "2" denote "data not reported"
   and "acceptable measurements", respectively.

6. The designation for missing values, given as "-99.00" in the original files, was changed to "-999.9".



                            5. HOW TO OBTAIN THE DATA FILES

     This data base is available upon request in machine-readable form, free-of-charge from CDIAC.

6. FILE DESCRIPTIONS

     This section describes the content and format of each of the 15 files that comprise this NDP (see
Table 1).  Because CDIAC distributes the data set in a variety of media (e.g., via anonymous FTP and
9-track magnetic tape), each of the 15 files is referenced by both an ASCII filename, which is given in
lower-case, bold-faced type (e.g., ndp047.txt), and a file number.  The remainder of this section describes
(or lists, where appropriate) the contents of each of the 15 files.  The files are discussed in the order in
which they appear on the magnetic tapes.

Where:

CRUISE is the cruise name;

DAY    is the day of sampling (GMT);

MONTH  is the month of sampling;

YEAR   is the year of sampling;

DAYGMT is the day of the year [expressed in decimal time (GMT)];

LAT    is the latitude of the sampling location (decimal degrees; negative values indicate the Southern
       Hemisphere);

LONG   is the longitude of the sampling location (decimal degrees; negative values indicate the Western
       Hemisphere);

DIST   is the cumulative distance since the first sampling location on the leg (km);

TEMP   is the sea-surface temperature ( deg C);

WARM   is the warming temperature [indicates the degrees of warming (deg C) for seawater
       as it transited from the intake line to analysis site];

SAL    is the sea-surface salinity [Practical Salinity Scale (PSS)];

APRE   is the atmospheric pressure (mbar);

XCO2A  is the observed mole fraction of CO2 in air [ppm (dry air)];

XCO2SW is the observed mole fraction of CO2 in surface water [corrected for warming, 
       ppm (dry air)];

FCO2A  is the calculated in situ fugacity of CO2 in air [ uatm (moist air)];

FCO2SW is the calculated in situ fugacity of CO2 in surface water (corrected for warming,
        uatm (moist air)];

FLAG   is the data quality flag:

       2   =  Acceptable measurements of X(CO2)sw;
       3   =  Questionable measurements of X(CO2)sw;
       5   =  Data were not reported;
       P   =  Questionable latitude and/or longitude;
       
Missing values for variables are represented by -999.9.
