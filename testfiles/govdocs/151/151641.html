        meet you. Can you tell me how and why you decided to make a wind tunnel?</font><br>
        Orville and I did construct a little wind tunnel in Dayton in the back 
        of the bicycle shop. We built it to check the aviation data from Otto 
        Lillienthal, and to help us build a better airfoil for our aircraft. Unfortunately, 
        we destroyed it some time later. Only a replica exists today.</span>

        meet you. Can you tell me how and why you decided to make a wind tunnel?</font><br>
        We discovered during our gliding flights in 1902 that our glider was not 
        generating as much lift as it theoretically should. My brother and I surmised 
        that we could test new wing shapes if we made small scale models of them 
        and "flew" them. We first tested them on a bicycle, but that became too 
        hard to maintain a consistent test, so we built a wind tunnel in our workshop, 
        and tested them there </span>

        the first kite, what was the "Big Ah-ha" that said "I could be up there!" 
        </font><br>
        Well, actually the bih Ah-ha came a bit earlier when we read about Lillienthal 
        and also when Orville and I watched the buzzards flying over the "Pinnacles" 
        south of Dayton. The 1899 kite was also a big Ah-ha for both of us.</span>

        the places with wind and sand, why did you select Kitty Hawk, North Carolina?</font><br>
        My brother contacted the National Weather Bureau in Washington DC and 
        found the place with strong and regular breezes. It also had soft, sandy, 
        open terrain for landing on</span>

        <font color=#500000>RE: [<b>Michael-DaddyFixit/FAA</b>] With Chicago known 
        as "The windy city," why did you choose Kitty Hawk at the test grounds? 
        </font><br>
        Orville and I chose Kitty Hawk because the weather reports we received 
        showed a constant breeze and lots of SMOOTH sand to land (not crash) onto. 
        There is not a lot of readily available sand at Chicago.</span>

        <font color=#500000>RE: [<b>Michael-DaddyFixit/FAA</b>] I was wondering

        Katheren was a great source of inspiration for us. She encouraged us, 
        helped us, and took care of running the family, especially when we were 
        at Kitty Hawk. I dare say, that without her support, we could not have 
        gone to North Carolina.</span>

        Katherine was very helpful to us both. She and Lorin ran the bicycle shop 
        while Orv and I were in Kitty Hawk. Did you know that Katherine and Orville 
        have the same birthday, only three years apart? We are all very close

        Where were you born? How old are you now? How many classes did it take 
        to fly a plane? How many planes have you flown since your flyer? </font><br>
        I was born in 1867 (two years after the end of the Civil War) in Henry 
        County, Indiana. Our flying lessons consisted of practicing with the gliders 
        we built in 1900, 1901 and 1902. Altogether we had over a thousand glides 
        before we tried to fly the powered "Flyer" in 1903.</span>

        <font color=#500000>RE: [<b>Jimmy-Mrs.Regal/YpsilantiCOPE</b>] How many 
        flights would you consider to be truly successful? </font><br>
        We had four successful flights that historic day. Actually I would have 
        been satisfied (but not very gratified with only one successful flight 
        that day. After the 4th flight the wind caught the "Flyer" and turned 
        it over and over and wrecked it. That airplane never flew again. But we 
        were very happy.</span>

        <font color=#500000>RE: [<b>Michael-DaddyFixit/FAA</b>] How did your relationship 
        end with Mr. Chaneute? </font><br>
        Mr. Chanute was of great help to us when we started out. He gave us great 
        technical guidance. However, in later years he did not appreciate the 
        need to maintain secrecy for the sake of gaining a competitive business 
        advantage. It was not appropriate for him to want to tell the world about 
        inventions and improvements we made to the airplane, so that someone else 
        could use our work, build an airplane, and take business from us. I can 
        appreciate Mr. Chanute's desire to inform the world, but he needs to appreciate 
        the reality of doing business.</span>

        Lillienthal? What did he do?</font><br>
        Otto Lillienthal was a pioneer in aeronautics. He built what today you 
        would call a sort of hang glider and conducted gliding experiments from 
        a hill he had built in his back yard near his home in Germany. Unfortunately, 
        he died as a result of his experiments when his craft stalled and he broke 
        his neck. Orville and I were very sad to hear this as we were following 
        his experiments.</span>

        Mr. Lilienthal was a German inventor who flew gliders around 1891 - 1896. 
        His work really inspired us to pursue our own aircraft. We also learned 
        a lot from his work. His unfortunate death in 1896 was very disturbing 
        to my brother and me, and we made a lot of changes in our designs so that 
        we would not meet such an unfortunate tragedy ourselves.</span>

        The engine was built primarily by our bicycle mechanic Charley Taylor. 
        It only produced about 12 horsepower when first started and as the engine 
        got hotter it was only producing about 10 horsepower. A Geo Metro engine 
        is many times more powerful than the one we had to use. Do you know why 
        the power dropped off as our engine got hotter?</span>

        <font color=#500000>RE: [<b>Michael-DaddyFixit/FAA</b>] After the sucesses 
        of 1903, and in-leu of building your own engines, did any other engine 
        manufactures offer to build an enging for you?</font><br>
        Yes, several engine manufacturers eventually offered to build an engine. 
        However, we couldn't find any American made engines that would produce 
        enough power and meet our requirements for the 1903 "Flyer", so that is 
        why we had our own employee, Charley Taylor, build the engine for us to 
        our specifications.</span>

        Did any of the experience you gained from the bicycle business help you 
        with designing and flying the airplane?</font><br>
        Our bicycle business was very helpful to our flying. Besides providing 
        us with the money to support our experiments, it also provided us with 
        a source of materials, and a workshop. The chain used to drive our propellers 
        was provided by the same company that made chains for our bicycles. We 
        also used a lot of our understanding of bicycle riding to our flying. 
        Some experts have said that the reason we tolerated the inherent instability 
        in our airplanes is because bicycles are inherently unstable. I'm not 
        sure Wilbur or I were thinking that at the time, but it makes some sense.</span>

        Mom taught Orville and me to work with tools when we were little. In fact, 
        she came from a long line of coach builders in Germany and handed down 
        the skills she learned to us. She is the one to teach us how to work with 
        tools, not our father. Mom died of tuberculosis (they called it consumption) 
        in 1889, ten years before we built our first kite in 1899.</span>

        <font color=#500000>RE: [<b>Jimmy-Mrs.Regal/YpsilantiCOPE</b>] I think 
        the power dropped off as your engine got hotter--because of friction?</font><br>
        Well, that's a very good guess and partly true. Also, a major reason was 
        because of something called density of the air. As the engine got hotter, 
        so did the air in the engine and hotter (and thinner) air does not have 
        the "punch" or power that colder denser air has. Anyway, the engine heated 
        up and locked up and quit running after about a minute, almost every time.

        We made our gliders with the same basic design because it worked. By starting 
        with a good design, we could then make gradual improvements to it so that 
        it would fly better, and understand what the change does. Many of our 
        contemporaries made drastic changes to their designs without any rhyme 
        or reason. I believe this is why we suceeded.</span>

        <font color=#500000>RE: [<b>Blake-MrCampbell/Heritage</b>] On your "Flyer" 
        there were two sets of wings. The large wings similar to modern planes, 
        but also a smaller set at the front of the plane. What purpose did the 
        latter serve on the plane?</font><br>
        The smaller wings that you are talking about were called "canards" (French 
        for the word duck or joke") and they served at the elevators for our aircraft. 
        These "smaller" wings were themselves 12 feet across compared to the 40 
        feet 1 inch that the whole airplane was. The elevator "canards" helped 
        to control our up and down motion. </span>

        the coming wind tunnel tests will not only help the present day world 
        understand what Orville and I already intuitively knew but to broaden 
        our understanding of the function of "canards" on modern day aircraft. 
        They can be very tricky on our 1903 aircraft and frankly, almost never 
        behaved in exactly the same way from flight to flight. That was the toughest 
        part about controlling the aircraft.</span>
