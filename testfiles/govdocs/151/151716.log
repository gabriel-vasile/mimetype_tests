<p> 
08:00	Shift start. Cryo is pumping the Watt can, and doing some work on S1, S3. 
	MCR have announced a Controlled Access 8:30-9:30 
</p><p> 
08:30	Controlled Access 
	Napora and Slaughter remove 2 SVX power supplies temporarily used for L00. 
	Roser et al. opened West IMU steel all the way back to see whether this  
	change in shielding helps cmp HV trips.The answer is NO. See below. 
</p><p> 
09:30	Controlled access completed, shot setup started. 
</p><p> 
09:45	Attempt an SVX calibration. This fails because od CSL. Experts come in. 
	CSL had a problem on the monitoring program, and stopped functioning  
	probably because the shared memory could not be accessed from other  
	CSL programs. CSL restarted. Work completed 10:55.  
	For this reason, silicon D-mode calibrations abandonned, and L2  
	Isolist/L2 clustering studies were made using software event builder. 
<li>	There is a request for SVX D-mode calibrations asap. 
</p><p> 
10:15	Brings voltages up after the flodd of previous 2 shifts, and the contolled 
	access: 
<li>	Long period to restrat monitoring of GAM,CHA,CEM,WHA, in particular GAM which remained out of commission until ~12:00. 
<li>	Repeated BMU trips: BMU24. Expert called. Voltage lowered to 2000V, an  
access is required to understand cause. 
</p><p> 
11:45	L2 isolation studies concluded (10:45),  
	further studies required. Further CLIST  
	studies by Monica and Heather (finished 13:50). 
	Shot setup starts with single bunch injection. Magnet ramped up (completed  
	12:30). 
</p><p> 
12:00	CLC gain calibration completed, followed by COSMIC runs to check. 
</p><p> 
12-13:30 Additional work included: 
<li>	 new b0puls01 code to fix error messages (Arnd) 
<li>	 reboot of ront-end crates. b0mutr00 and b0svt02 
<li>	 cdfsoftb0 release 4.0.0d dclared as  current default version for  
	 consumer tasks.  
<li>	 Plug HV values reset 
</p><p> 
15:00	Stable beam declared at 15:00 ... L=5.3E30, with Lostp = 8KHz 
	The following things have been done..... 
<li>	Beam tilted to +500 MCR units (x) and +150 MCR units (y) 
<li>	Silicon taken out of DAQ for X-mode calibrations. 
<li>	During this time run Physics_0_02[1,208] w/o SVX. Attempt to run monitor 
	tasks not successful, and at end of shift Kaori/Matt were working on it. 
<li>	Trigger table to Physics_0_02[1,208], again w/o silicon, is used to  
	test L2 jet cutting. This is in progress (127754) 
<li>	Next step is to integrate the SVX into this trigger table, and if necessary 
	to fine-tune the beam displacement after checks.
