          or not to include an examinee with incomplete or missing data on
          the coronal caries component in the analysis of that component.
          Examinees who have no valid or useful data have a completion code
          of &quot;3  Not assessed.&quot;


     DEPCJFLG, DEPCLFLG, DEPGNFLG, DEPLAFLG, DEPPCFLG:  Completion codes

          These variables were constructed to help the analyst decide whether
          or not to include an examinee with incomplete or missing data on
          the periodontal component in the analysis of that component.  For
          examinees who were medically excluded from periodontal components
          or who were not in the age range to receive these assessments, the
          periodontal component data and the completion code are blank.
          Examinees who were completely edentulous or who otherwise have no
          valid or useful data have a completion code of &quot;3  Not assessed.&quot;

     DEPDQFLG:  Completion code:  denture questionnaire

          This variable was constructed to help the analyst decide whether
          or not to include an examinee with incomplete or missing data on
          the denture questionnaire in the analysis of that component.  For
          examinees who were not in the age range to receive these
          assessments, the denture questionnaire data and the completion
          code are blank.

     DEPLQUAD and DEPUQUAD:  Upper and lower quadrant periodontal
               assessment indicators

          The right and left upper and lower quadrant indicators for the
          periodontal components were generated by the direct data entry
          computer program at the beginning of the examination.  Therefore,
          indicators may be present for examinees who did not have
          measurements or who were edentulous.  Note that because the value
          for the periodontal component is blank, while the quadrant
          indicators remained set, there will be a discrepancy between
          these counts.


     DEPOVB:  Occlusal characteristics:  overbite (mm)

          Overbite was calculated by subtraction of overlap from crown
          height.  The exact measurement process is fully described in the
          Oral Examination Component manual (U.S. DHHS, 1996b).

          See note for DEPCJFLG.


     DEPRCFLG:  Completion code:  restorations and tooth conditions

          This variable was constructed to help the analyst decide whether
          or not to include an examinee with incomplete or missing data on
          the restorations and tooth conditions component in the analysis
          of that component.  For examinees who were not in the age range
          to receive these assessments, the restoration and tooth
          conditions data and the completion code are blank.  Examinees who
          were completely edentulous or who otherwise have no valid or
          useful data have a completion code of &quot;3  Not assessed.&quot;


     DEPRSFLG:  Completion code:  root caries

          This variable was constructed to help the analyst decide whether
          or not to include an examinee with incomplete or missing data on
          the root caries component in the analysis of that component.  For
          examinees who were medically excluded from the root caries
          component or who were not in the age range to receive the
          assessment, the component data and the completion code are blank.
          Examinees who were completely edentulous or who otherwise have no
          valid or useful data have a completion code of &quot;3  Not assessed.&quot;



     DEPSE1-DEPSE28:  Sealants

          The code &quot;2  Not eligible for sealants&quot; was used 1) for certain
          teeth not shaped to hold preventive sealants and 2) for missing,
          crowned, or filled teeth.


     DEPSTCL1, DEPSTCL2, DEPSTCL3, DEPSTCL4, DEPSTCL5, DEPSTCL6:
               Oral soft tissue lesions:  color

          More than one color could be indicated for each lesion.  Each
          color is a single digit, so multiple digits indicate combinations
          of colors.  To determine what specific colors were present, one
          must separate character strings into their single characters.


     DEPSTDX1, DEPSTDX2, DEPSTDX3, DEPSTDX4, DEPSTDX5, DEPSTDX6:
               Oral soft tissue lesions:  clinical diagnosis

          The &quot;unknown&quot; code represents a specific diagnosis of a lesion
          that did not fit into any of the named categories.  A lesion of
          &quot;unknown&quot; diagnosis required a clinical description.  The &quot;other&quot;
          codes (46 to 59) include identifiable lesions that were different
          from soft tissue lesions of interest.  During the examination,
          the dentist wrote in a diagnosis for lesions designated as
          &quot;other.&quot;  During data processing the 13 most frequently observed
          written-in conditions were grouped and coded separately (codes
          47-59); the remaining rarer conditions were retained in code 46.


     DEPSTLC1, DEPSTLC2, DEPSTLC3, DEPSTLC4, DEPSTLC5, DEPSTLC6:
               Oral soft tissue lesions:  locations

          More than one location could be indicated for each clinical
          diagnosis.  Multiple locations are shown as combined letters and
          numbers.  To determine what specific locations were affected, one
          must separate character strings into their single characters.


     DEPTRFLG:  Completion code:  traumatic injuries

          This variable was constructed to help the analyst decide whether
          or not to include an examinee with incomplete or missing data on
          the traumatic injuries component in the analysis of that
          component.  For examinees who were not in the age range to
          receive these assessments, the traumatic injuries data and the
          completion code are blank.  Examinees who were completely
          edentulous or who otherwise have no valid or useful data have a
          completion code of &quot;3  Not assessed.&quot;

                           ALLERGY SKIN TEST


     Allergy skin reactivity testing was conducted on all examinees aged
     6-19 years and on a random half-sample of examinees aged 20-59 years by
     a trained examiner in the mobile examination center (MEC).

     Before skin testing, screening questions were asked to determine
     medical safety exclusions.  Those excluded from testing were examinees
     who:  usually did not have trouble breathing in their chest or lungs
     but who were having trouble breathing at the time of the examination
     (this trouble was NOT due to nasal congestion from a cold), usually had
     trouble breathing in their chest or lungs and had more trouble
     breathing at the time of the exam, had a severe response to allergen
     skin testing previously, or had severe eczema or infection on both
     arms.

     Because this examination was administered to a selected subsample in
     the examination center, the allergy sample weight (WTPFALG6) should be
     used for data analysis.  For more information on the use of sample
     weights in NHANES III data analysis, refer to the NHANES III Analytic
     and Reporting Guidelines (U.S. DHHS, 1996b).

     The allergy skin test consisted of the evaluation of immediate
     hypersensitivity reactions to any of 10 licensed, commercially
     available, FDA-approved, standardized allergens as well as positive
     and negative controls.  The extracts were indoor allergens
     (Dermatophagoides farinae (house mite), cat, German cockroach),
     outdoor allergens (short ragweed, perennial rye, Alternaria alternata,
     Bermuda grass, Russian thistle, white oak), and a food allergen
     (peanut).  The positive control was histamine, and the negative control
     was the glycerinated diluent.  Examiners prepared fresh allergen
     solutions upon arrival at each MEC site.

     Hypersensitivity reactions were evaluated after administering the
     allergens on an examinee's forearms.  Allergens were applied using the
     prick-puncture technique at 12 skin sites (one for each allergen and
     the positive and negative controls) determined by a clear, plastic
     template.  The flare and wheal areas were delineated with a marking
     pen 15 minutes after the skin was punctured and the allergens were
     applied.

     The length and width of the flare and wheal were measured with a 100-
     mm flexible, clear, plastic ruler.  Length was defined as the longest
     diameter of the reaction, and width was defined as the diameter
     perpendicular to the length at its midpoint.  If a reaction had any
     dimension 3 mm or greater, all four dimensions (length and width of
     flare and wheal) were measured and recorded.  If all four dimensions


     were less than 3 mm, zeroes were recorded for all the measurements.
     Confluence was noted for both allergens if two reactions overlapped.
     For details of the allergy testing protocol, see the Training Manual
     for Allergy Component (U.S. DHHS, 1996b).


     The NHANES III allergy skin test was administered by health technicians
     who were trained to perform the testing.  Training occurred before the
     examination period at special training sessions held at NCHS or at the
     offices of the contractor responsible for survey operations.  The
     component was monitored on a regular basis by the component
     consultant, and retraining was conducted annually.  In addition to
     data collection training, the technicians were trained to recognize
     and respond to generalized hypersensitivity reactions.  A physician
     was in the MEC during all examinations, and drugs for treating
     systemic allergic reactions were available.

     Information on respiratory symptoms related to allergies can be found
     in the Household Adult Data File (for examinees aged 17 years and over)
     and the Household Youth Data File (for examinees aged 2 months-16
     years).

     The allergen data fields are blank for examinees who were excluded for
     safety reasons.  For those examinees who were eligible for the allergy
     skin test but for whom allergen data were not collected, the allergen
     measurement fields have &quot;888  Blank but applicable&quot; values.  In most
     cases, these missing data were due to examinees not participating in
     the allergy skin test, usually due to time constraints.  In other
     cases, however, data on some but not all allergens were collected.
     These gaps in the data were due to refusals to continue the testing or
     to receive specific allergens.

     All measurements were taken within the acceptable time of 15 plus or
     minus 5 minutes except for one examinee who was measured at 23 minutes
     after the administration of the allergens and the controls.  Therefore,
     the variables indicating the minutes from administration to reading for
     each allergen were not included on this data file.

     Data processing and editing were performed to ensure internal data
     consistency.

    NOTES


     ALPTECH1 and ALPTECH2: Examiners number 1 and 2

          Because of the time interval between allergen placement and
          reading, the examiner number was entered twice.  Examiner number 1
          placed the allergens, and examiner 2 measured the reactions.

                              AUDIOMETRY


     Pure tone air conduction audiometric threshold testing was conducted
     on all examinees aged 6-19 years by a trained examiner in a soundproof
     room in the mobile examination center (MEC).

     Before threshold testing, a screening questionnaire was administered
     to determine the need for test exclusions and to assess factors that
     might affect test results.  Examinees who reported having ear drainage
     (AUPA10) were excluded from air conduction testing on the ear(s) with
     drainage.

     Because this examination was administered in the mobile examination
     center, the MEC examination sample weight (WTPFEX6) should be used for
     data analysis.  For more information on the use of sample weights in
     NHANES III data analysis, refer to the NHANES III Analytic and
     Reporting Guidelines (U.S. DHHS, 1996b).

     Threshold testing was conducted on both ears of examinees at seven
     frequencies (500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 6000, and 8000 Hertz (Hz)).
     The valid range for air conduction threshold values was determined by
     the effective range of the audiometers (Grason-Stadler, Inc., Model GSI
     16, Littleton, MA), which was from -20 to 105 dumbbells (dB).  Observed
     values were between  -10 and 100 dB.  If an examinee did not respond to
     the signal tone at any level for one or more frequencies and a comment
     by the examiner indicated known deafness or severe hearing loss, a
     threshold level of 105 dB was entered.  In accordance with the testing
     protocol, a retest with masking occurred if an examinee had air
     conduction threshold value(s) at a given frequency that differed by 40
     dB or more between both ears.  If the lack of response was unilateral
     with a threshold value of 65 dB or lower for the other ear, a threshold
     value of 105 dB was entered for the relevant retest with masking
     value(s).

     Before the examinations began at each MEC site, a field output
     calibration check was performed, and an environmental noise survey was
     conducted.  The audiometer was rechecked weekly, and during
     examination periods, the tone quality, masking tone quality, hearing
     level controls, and earphones were checked daily.  If a unit did not
     meet specifications, it was sent for service, and a backup unit was
     used for examinations.  Additionally, laboratory calibration on each
     unit was performed approximately twice a year.  For details of these
     procedures, analysts should consult the Audiometry and Tympanometry
     Manual (U.S. DHHS, 1996b).



     Air conduction threshold testing alone is not sufficient to fully
     characterize hearing loss; it only provides information on the
     severity and the frequencies affected.  Because of this, tympanic
     membrane compliance also was measured to help determine the nature of
     any hearing loss observed in the audiometry data.  Analysts should
     refer to the Tympanometry section of the Examination Data File for
     information on this aspect of hearing testing.  In addition, questions
     on hearing status including ear infection history and the use of
     hearing aids can be found in the Household Youth Data File (2 months-
     16 years of age).

     The audiometry consultant provided extensive training to examiners at
     their time of hire, and each examiner's performance was monitored on a
     periodic basis.  Audiometry and tympanometry were priority components
     at three of four annual MEC team retrainings.

     Data processing and editing were performed to ensure internal data
     consistency.  Notes have been provided for variables requiring
     additional explanation.

     NOTES


     AUPA10:  Drainage/discharge from either ear?

          Examinees who reported having ear drainage were excluded from air
          conduction testing on the ear with drainage and from tympanic
          membrane compliance testing on both ears.  Threshold value fields
          for excluded ears are blank.  Tympanometry data fields for
          excluded examinees are blank.


     AUPA9:  Tube in right or left ear?

          Examinees who reported having a tube in either or both ears were
          excluded from tympanic membrane compliance testing.  However, air
          conduction threshold testing was performed if there was no report
          or evidence of drainage (AUPA10).  Tympanometry data fields for
          excluded examinees are blank.


     AUPAUDO2 and AUPB1C1-AUPB1C8, AUPB2C1-AUPB2C8:  Retest information

          When examinees had air conduction threshold values at a given
          frequency that differed by 40 dB or more between the left and
          right ears, the ear with the higher threshold value(s) was
          retested while a masking sound was introduced into the other ear.
          In cases for which a retest was indicated but for which no retest
          data existed, the relevant variables were coded &quot;Blank but
          applicable.&quot;  If no threshold value differences of 40 dB or more
          were observed, these variables are blank.
     

                              TYMPANOMETRY


     Tympanic membrane compliance was tested for all examinees aged 6-19
     years by a trained examiner in a soundproof room in the mobile
     examination center (MEC).

     A screening questionnaire administered before audiometry testing
     also determined tympanometry test exclusions and can be used to assess
     factors that might have affected tympanometry results.  If an examinee
     reported that either ear had a tube (AUPA9) or drainage (AUPA10),
     tympanometry was not performed, and all tympanometry variables are
     blank.  Analysts should refer to the Audiometry section of the
     examination data file for information on the screening questionnaire.
     In addition, questions on hearing status, including ear infection
     history and the use of hearing aids, can be found in the Household
     Youth Data File (ages 2 months-16 years).

     Because this examination was administered in the mobile examination
     center, the MEC examination sample weight (WTPFEX6) should be used for
     data analysis.  For more information on the use of sample weights in
     NHANES III data analysis, refer to the NHANES III Analytic and
     Reporting Guidelines (U.S. DHHS, 1996b).

     The tympanometer (Model TA-7A Automatic Impedance Meter, Teledyne
     Avionics, Charlottesville, VA) produced a paper tympanogram output and
     was connected to a personal computer for electronic data collection.

     Tympanometer function was checked daily.  If a unit did not meet
     specifications, it was sent for service, and a backup unit was used
     for examinations.  Laboratory calibration on each unit was performed
     approximately twice a year.  For details of equipment maintenance
     procedures, analysts should consult the Audiometry and Tympanometry
     Manual (U.S. DHHS, 1996b).

     Training for tympanometry was combined with that for audiometry.  At
     the time of hire, examiners received extensive instruction from the
     audiometry consultant, and the examiners' performance was monitored on
     a periodic basis.  Hearing evaluation, which included audiometry and
     tympanometry, was a priority component at three of four annual MEC
     team retrainings.

     The variables containing equivalent volume at various pressures
     (TYPC000L-TYPC120L, TYPC000R-TYPC120R) can be used to create
     tympanogram plots of compliance as a function of pressure.  To do so,
     the analyst must rearrange the data to have 121 observations per
     examinee (one for each pressure value at which compliance was determined
     from -400 to 200 daPa in 5 daPa increments) and create a variable to
     record the associated pressure values.  An example of SAS programming
     code to perform this rearrangement is included in the note for
     TYPC000L-TYPC120L and TYPC000R-TYPC120R.


     This data file includes 242 variables with equivalent volume data for
     pressure values between -400 and 200 daPa.  Many examinees have data
     for pressure values of -200 daPa or greater but have no data (blanks)
     for pressure values from -400 to -205 daPa.  This is due to
     variability in a software setting on the tympanometer that toggled an
     option for continuing readings to -400 daPa or stopping the pressure
     at -200 daPa if a compliance peak occurred before -175 daPa.  There
     are data for pressures between -400 and -205 daPa for 1156 left ear
     observations and 1166 right ear observations.  Of these observations
     with data for pressures lower than -200 daPa, only 192 left ear
     observations and 200 right ear observations had pressure at peak
     compliance values of -175 daPa or lower.  When plotting tympanogram
     data, analysts may want to include data points for pressure values
     between -400 and -205 daPa.  However, in most cases, this pressure
     range will not add useful tympanogram information.

     Early in the survey, electronic data collection was not fully
     operational, and sporadic equipment problems led to data loss
     throughout the survey.  In these cases, the tympanogram data points
     (TYPC000L-TYPC120L, TYPC000R-TYPC120R) are not available.  However,
     the values for peak compliance (TYPCMPLL, TYPCMPLR), pressure at peak
     compliance (TYPPRSPL, TYPPRSPR), canal volume (TYPVOLL, TYPVOLR), and
     acoustic reflex (TYPRFXL, TYPRFXR) were entered into the data from the
     hard copy tympanograms if they were available.

     Data processing and editing were performed to ensure internal
     consistency of data.  Notes have been provided for variables requiring
     additional explanation.

          programming language, to obtain plots of compliance (y) versus
          pressure (x) for left and right ear data for each examinee
          (identified by SEQN) in a data set.  Note that the use of name-
          range variable lists in the array statements assumes that the
          variables are ordered as shown in the data file code book.
          Variations in ordering for the specified variables will result in

                    WISC/WRAT COGNITIVE TEST


     Cognitive function was evaluated by administering portions of
     standardized tests to examinees aged 6-16 years at the time of the
     examination.  This represents a variation from the usual NHANES test
     protocol, in which tests are conducted based on the age at the time of
     the household interview, rather than on the age at the time of the MEC
     examination.  The protocol for this component did not detail any
     medical, safety or other exclusions.

     Because these tests were administered in the mobile examination center
     (MEC), the MEC examination sample weight (WTPFEX6) should be used for
     data analysis.  For more information on the use of sample weights in
     NHANES III data analysis, refer to the NHANES III Analytic and
     Reporting Guidelines (U.S. DHHS, 1996b).

     Cognitive function was evaluated using parts of two tests, the
     Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised (WISC-R) and the
     Wide Range Achievement Test-Revised (WRAT-R).  Two subtests of the
     WISC-R test, a verbal component (Digit Span) and a performance exam
     (Block Design), were administered and are considered relatively
     culturally unbiased (Kaufman, 1979).  In addition, two subtests of the
     WRAT-R test, math and reading, were conducted.  The WISC-R test was
     administered first and was followed by the WRAT-R.  The scores for all
     four subtests used a common scale and were derived for each child
     relative to his/her age group based on test-specific standardization
     samples created by the test developers (Wechsler, 1974; Jastak, 1984;
     Kramer, 1995).

     At the time of hire, MEC interviewers were trained to conduct the
     WISC/WRAT examination.  During annual site visits, test administration
     was evaluated, and re-training took place.  To increase the number of
     evaluated examination administrations with minimum intrusion and after
     obtaining informed consent from the examinees or their guardians,
     sessions were audio-taped and reviewed for protocol adherence.
     Feedback was provided to the interviewers after review of the taped
     sessions.

     An automated data collection system ensured that responses obtained
     were within acceptable ranges.  Consequently, minimal data processing
     and editing were required.  Notes have been provided for standardized
     and recoded variables and for variables requiring additional
     explanation.


     Conducting only a portion of each of the WISC-R and WRAT-R tests with
     children in NHANES III limits data interpretation.  For example, an
     Intelligence Quotient (IQ) cannot be calculated for an individual
     using the WISC-R results from NHANES III because only certain subtests
     were administered.  The complete WISC-R examination is comprised of
     twelve components, six verbal and six performance modules.  An IQ can be
     calculated only when ten of the twelve verbal and performance elements
     are administered.   Similarly, the WRAT-R test administered in NHANES
     III omitted a spelling section and is, therefore, incomplete.  For
     additional information on the tests, refer to the Manual for the
     Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised (Wechsler, 1974) and
     the Wide Range Achievement Test-Revised Administration Manual (Jastak,
     1984).

     WISC-R and WRAT-R test forms are not found in either the Plan and
     Operation of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination
     Survey, 1988-94, or the test manuals.   The forms are copyrighted and
     may be reproduced only with written permission from the publishers.
     Write to Jastak Associates, Inc. (1526 Gilpin Avenue, Wilmington,
     DE 19806) for the WRAT-R test form and to The Psychological
     Corporation (555 Academic Court, San Antonio, TX 78204-0952) for
     the WISC-R form.

          WISC-R Manual (Wechsler, 1974).  Refer to this publication for
          information on deriving these scores.  Scaling scores allows
          comparison of WISC-R with WRAT-R test components.

          See note for WWPBSCSR.


     WWPLANG:  Language used in exam

          All tests were administered in either English or Spanish.
          Children who did not speak either language were excluded from the
          test, and their test results were coded as &quot;Blank but
          applicable.&quot;  Note that of the 292 &quot;Blank but applicable&quot; cases
          for language used in exam, 280 had all test components &quot;Blank but
          applicable&quot; (8-filled).


     WWPMRSR:  Math raw score

          This variable represents the sum of the raw scores for the oral
          and written math tests.


     WWPMSCSR:   Math scaled score

          The math scaled score (WWPMSCSR) was derived from the math raw
          score (WWPMRSR) using factors calculated and provided in the
          WRAT-R Administration Manual (Jastak, 1984).  This variable
          represents the scaled score for the mathematics test and allows
          comparison between the WRAT-R and WISC-R exams.


     WWPMSSR and WWPRSSR:  Standardized scores

          Standardized scores represent an age-standardized version of raw
          scores and were calculated according to the WRAT-R Administration
          Manual (Jastak, 1984).  Refer to this publication for information
          on deriving these scores.  Note that in accordance with the
          WRAT-R manual, the smallest standardized score possible varies by
          age.


     WWPRRSR:  Reading raw score


          This variable represents the sum of the raw scores for the oral
          and formal reading tests.

     
     WWPRSCSR:   Reading scaled score

          The reading scaled score (WWPRSCSR) was derived from the reading
          raw score (WWPRRSR) using factors calculated and provided in the
          WRAT-R Administration Manual (Jastak, 1984).  This variable
          represents the scaled score for the reading test and allows
          comparison between the WRAT-R and WISC-R exams.

                               SPIROMETRY


     Lung function testing (spirometry) was conducted on examinees aged
     eight years and older by a trained technician in the mobile
     examination center (MEC).  It also was conducted at the home of
     examinees aged 60 and over who were unwilling or unable to come to the
     MEC.  Before testing, screening questions were asked to determine
     medical safety exclusions.  Those excluded from testing were examinees
     who had undergone chest or abdominal surgery within three weeks or had
     experienced heart problems (myocardial infarction or heart attack,
     angina or chest pain, congestive heart failure) within six weeks before
     the MEC exam.

     To determine which subjects were home examinees, the DMPSTAT variable
     (3=home-examined) should be used.  When analyzing data for combined
     home-examined and MEC-examined subjects, the combined MEC- plus
     home-examined sample weights should be used (WTPFHX6).  When using only
     MEC items or measures, the MEC examination sample weights should be
     used (WTPFEX6).  For more information on the use of sample weights in
     NHANES III data analysis, refer to the Analytic and Reporting
     Guidelines (U.S. DHHS, 1996b).

     Spirometry is a widely used test of lung function that measures both
     the volume of air in the lung and how quickly a person can move the
     air out of the lung.  A testing session consisted of repeated forced
     vital capacity (FVC) maneuvers.  Each maneuver required the examinee
     to take the deepest possible breath and exhale into a spirometer as
     hard, fast, and completely as possible.  The spirometer recorded the
     volume of air exhaled as a function of time from which a number of
     parameters were measured.  Each examinee attempted to perform at least
     five FVC maneuvers.

     The testing procedure was explained and demonstrated to each examinee
     by a spirometry technician.  The computer provided immediate feedback
     on the examinee's effort, and the technician used that information to
     actively coach the examinee through each trial.

     For a maneuver to be acceptable, it had to be a maximal exhalation
     free from a cough, excessive hesitation, a leak, an obstructed
     mouthpiece, variable effort, or early termination.  An additional
     goal was that the examinee have a sufficient number of trials to
     demonstrate that the FVC and forced expiratory volume(FEV1) values were
     reproducible.

     Aside from using a different type of spirometer flow-type (see
     SPPTYPE) in home examinations, technicians used procedures comparable
     to those used in the MEC.  Therefore, the home spirometry values were
     incorporated into the MEC spirometry measures data set.  Refer to the
     Spirometry Examination Manual (U.S. DHHS, 1996b) and the Home Exam
     Manual (U.S. DHHS, 1996b) for descriptions of data collection
     procedures and methods.  Testing procedures met the recommendations of
     the American Thoracic Society (American Thoracic Society, 1987).

     The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)
     served as the spirometry quality control center.  Each spirometry
     technician received at least one week of formal training and
     satisfactorily completed a NIOSH-approved course on spirometry.
     Additionally, spirometry data were reviewed by the quality control
     center at the completion of each location, and technicians received
     continuous feedback on their performance.

     Data processing and editing were performed to ensure internal data
     consistency.  Notes have been provided for variables requiring
     additional explanation.

     SPPFEV05:  Forced expiratory volume (FEV) at 0.5 seconds (ml)

          The volume (ml) of air exhaled during the first 0.5 second of a
          forced vital capacity maneuver.  The volume reported is the
          largest volume achieved from all acceptable FVC maneuvers.


     SPPFEV1:  Forced expiratory volume at 1 second (ml)

          The volume (ml) of air exhaled during the first second of a
          forced vital capacity maneuver.  The volume reported is the
          largest volume achieved from all acceptable FVC maneuvers.


     SPPFEV3:  Forced expiratory volume at 3 seconds (ml)

          The volume (ml) of air exhaled during the first three seconds of
          a forced vital capacity maneuver.  The volume reported is the
          largest volume achieved from all acceptable FVC maneuvers.


     SPPFEV6:  Forced expiratory volume at six seconds (ml)

          The volume (ml) of air exhaled during the first six seconds of a
          forced vital capacity maneuver.  The volume reported is the
          largest volume achieved from all acceptable FVC maneuvers.


     SPPFVC:  Forced vital capacity, largest value (ml)

          The total volume (ml) of air exhaled during a forced vital
          capacity maneuver.  The volume reported is the largest volume
          achieved from all acceptable FVC maneuvers.


     SPPMANEU:  Number of acceptable trials

          The number of FVC maneuvers that met the ATS acceptability
          criteria.


     SPPMMEF: Maximum mid-expiratory flow (ml/second best curve)

          The mean forced expiratory flow during the middle half of the FVC
          maneuver.  Values were obtained from the &quot;best curve&quot; defined as
          the curve with the highest sum of FVC and FEV1.


     SPPPEAK:  Peak expiratory flow (ml/second)

          The maximum expiratory flow (ml/sec) observed from all acceptable
          FVC maneuvers.


     SPPRELIA:  Test evaluation

          All tests were reviewed by two senior quality technicians at the
          spirometry quality control center and classified for reliability.
          Tests deemed unreliable should not be used because the quality
          technicians determined that the results were of insufficient
          quality to be usable.


     SPPREPRO:  Reproducibility code

          In accordance with ATS guidelines, all unacceptable maneuvers
          were excluded before the reproducibility calculations were
          performed.  The goal during test performance was to obtain a
          reproducible FVC (largest FVC and second largest FVC within 5%)
          and a reproducible FEV1 (largest FEV1 and second largest FEV1
          within 5%).  The reproducibility code indicates whether a
          reproducible FVC and/or FEV1 was obtained.


     SPPTEMP:  Spirometer internal temperature (Celsius)

          This was the internal temperature inside the spirometer measured
          at the end of the FVC maneuver.


     SPPTRIAL:  Number of forced vital capacity (FVC) trials attempted

          This was the total number of forced vital capacity maneuvers
          attempted by the sample person.


     SPPTYPE:  Spirometer type

          Four different types of spirometers were used; one type was used
          in MEC spirometry exams, and three different types were used in
          home spirometry exams.  The MEC spirometers (type=1) were
          customized, Ohio 822 or 827, dry, rolling-seal spirometers and
          were interfaced to a microcomputer.  For home spirometry, the
          three types of flow spirometers used were:  MultiSpiro (type=2),
          Riko model AS-600 (type=3), and NIOSH (type=4).  The MultiSpiro-
          and Riko-brand spirometers produced paper tracings with digital
          readings of FVC and FEV1.  These spirometers provided neither
          quality assessments of the subject's effort nor some of the
          spirometry variables measured in the MEC.  The NIOSH flow
          spirometer measured all of the parameters measured by the MEC
          spirometer and provided a display of the subject's flow-volume
          curve with a computer-determined quality assessment equivalent to
          the assessment provided by the spirometer used in the MEC.

                    MEC YOUTH QUESTIONNAIRE (Except DIS)


     The MEC Youth Questionnaire was administered to examinees aged 8-16
     years in the mobile examination center (MEC).  Conducted by a trained
     interviewer, the automated questionnaire was administered in a private
     setting to ensure confidentiality due to the sensitive nature of some
     of the sections.  The questionnaire included sections on physical
     activity, tobacco use, reproductive health, selected conditions,
     medicine/vitamin usage, food frequency, alcohol/drug use, and the
     Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS).  Because this component was
     administered in the examination center, the MEC examination sample
     weight (WTPFEX6) should be used for data analysis.  For more
     information on the use of sample weights in NHANES III data analysis,
     refer to the NHANES III Analytic and Reporting Guidelines (U.S. DHHS,
     1996b).

     Several portions of the questionnaire were asked only of specific age
     or gender groups, and check items are included as variables in this
     file to indicate these subgroups.  For example, reproductive health
     was asked of boys aged 15-16 years and girls aged 10-16 years.
     Medicine/vitamin use, food frequency, and alcohol/drug use were
     asked of boys and girls aged 12-16 years.  The DIS was asked of
     adolescents aged 15-16 years.  The DIS was edited and documented
     separately (see Diagnostic Interview Schedule).

     A subset of questions from the MEC Youth Questionnaire were
     administered as the MEC Proxy Questionnaire to the parents or
     guardians of children aged 2 months-11 years.  Questions on medicine,
     vitamin, and mineral usage, selected health conditions, and WIC
     program participation from the two questionnaires can be combined
     for an analysis of youths 2 months-16 years of age (see MEC Proxy
     Questionnaire).

     Data processing and editing were performed for consistency of
     responses within the sections of the questionnaire.  Notes have been
     provided for variables that were standardized or recoded or those
     that require additional comments.  The notes reference the questions, by
     section and number, from the questionnaires which can be found in the
     Plan and Operation of the National Health and Nutrition Examination
     Survey, 1988-1994 (NCHS, 1994; U.S. DHHS, 1996b).

    NOTES


     MYPB6R:  Number of cigarettes smoked per day

          This variable was created from the question B6.  The actual
          number of cigarettes smoked per day and a range of cigarettes
          smoked per day were the allowable answers.  The variable includes
          the mean number of cigarettes smoked per day derived from the
          range as well as the actual number of cigarettes smoked per day.


     MYPB7R:  Years smoked this amount in MYPB6R

          This variable was created from the question B7 when the data were
          not missing.  If B7 was missing, this variable used the estimated
          number of years the respondent smoked the amount reported in B6.
          The number was derived by subtracting the age that the respondent
          started smoking regularly from the age at the MEC interview.


     MYPB9S:  Number of cigarettes per day when smoked the most

          This variable was created from the two-part question (quantity
          and unit) B9 using the conversion factor 20 cigarettes/pack.


     MYPB13S:  Number of cigarettes per day usually smoked when youth
               smoked regularly

          This variable was created from the two-part question (quantity
          and unit) B13 using the conversion factor 20 cigarettes/pack.


     MYPB21AS:  Number of containers of chewing tobacco used per week

          This variable was created from the two-part question (quantity
          and unit) B21 using the conversion factor seven containers/week.


     MYPB21CS:  Number of containers of snuff used per week

          This variable was created from the two-part question (quantity
          and unit) B21 using the conversion factor seven containers/week.


     MYPC7S:  Months since stopped taking birth control pills

          This variable was created from the two-part question (quantity
          and unit) C7 using the conversion factor 12 months/year.


     MYPC8S: Total number of months took birth control pills

          This variable was created from the two-part question (quantity
          and unit) C8 using the conversion factor 12 months/year.


     MYPC9R:  Birth control pills codes

          This recode was derived to include a listing of all birth control
          pills that were specified in question C9.  It includes both birth
          control pills with original codes from the chart that the
          respondents were shown as well as those that were not included on
          the chart but that were specified by the respondents.  See the
          Appendix in the MEC Adult Questionnaire for the code listing.


     MYPC13R:  Age at time of first live birth

          Question C13 (age at time of first live birth) was only asked of
          women who had more than one live birth.  To prevent redundant
          questions, women who had one live birth were only asked question
          C14, &quot;Age at the time of the last live birth.&quot;   This variable,
          MYPC13R, was created to include responses for women who had only
          one live birth and women who had multiple births.  For women who
          had only one live birth, their responses to question C14 were coded
          into MYPC13R.  For women who had multiple births, their responses
          to question C13 were coded into MYPC13R.


     MYPC23S:  Number of months received WIC benefits

          This variable was created from the two-part question (quantity
          and unit) C23 using the conversion factor 12 months/year.


     MYPC27R:  Ever had sexual intercourse

          This variable was derived from questions C10 and C27.
          Respondents who reported a pregnancy (question C10) were not
          asked whether they had ever had sexual intercourse (question C27)
          as the response was implicit.  Therefore, MYPC27R was coded as
          &quot;Yes&quot; for respondents who reported a pregnancy in C10 and coded as
          the response in C27 for all other respondents.


     MYPC28:  Age at first sexual intercourse

          The question did not ask about first consensual sexual experience.
          Therefore, responses of first intercourse at very young ages were

             DIETARY FOOD FREQUENCY QUESTIONNAIRE (AGES 12-16 YEARS)


     The Dietary Food Frequency questionnaire was administered to youths aged
     12-16 years in the mobile examination center (MEC).  Respondents were
     asked how often over the past month they had eaten specified food items.
     The foods were listed in groups, targeting those high in vitamins A and
     C and calcium.  Respondents reported their consumption as the number of
     times per day, per week, per month, or never.  It is important to note
     that portion sizes were not defined, and responses represent &quot;number or
     times&quot; as determined by the respondent.

     The questionnaire was identical to the food frequency section of the
     Household Adult Questionnaire administered to adults aged 17 years and
     above (see Adult Household Data File).  MEC examination weights
     (WTPFEX6) should be used for analysis of the youth Dietary Food
     Frequency (Ages 12-16 years).  The interview weights (WTPFQX6), however,
     should be used when analyzing the adult food frequency data.  For more
     information on the use of sample weights in NHANES III data analysis,
     refer to the NHANES III Analytic and Reporting Guidelines (U.S. DHHS,
     1996b).

     Data processing and editing were performed for consistency of
     responses within the sections of the questionnaire.  As part of the
     editing process, the frequency of consumption of food items was
     standardized to the number of times consumed per month.  Notes have been
     provided for variables that were standardized or recoded or that require
     additional comments.

     FFPA1S, FFP1BS, FFP1ES-FFP7CS, FFP8AS, FFP8BS: Frequency of consumption
               of food item per month

          The frequency of consumption variables were standardized as &quot;times
          per month&quot; using the conversion factors 4.3 weeks/month and 30.4
          days/month rounded to the nearest whole number.  If the frequency
          of consumption was reported as &quot;never,&quot; the value was recorded as
          zero.


     FFP1D1:  Usual type of milk consumed

          Only usual milk consumed was recorded here.  If more than one milk
          type was reported as &quot;usual,&quot; the first milk reported was recorded.
          Guidelines based on fat content were developed in order to recode
          other milks that were reported but not listed and to create new
          categories.

     FFP8AFC:  New codes for other foods not listed

          Respondents also were asked about other foods not listed in the
          food frequency questionnaire.  Responses to this question from both
          the adult and the youth food frequency questionnaires were edited
          by first determining whether the food could be coded back into an
          existing category.  When possible, the frequency of consumption of
          that food was added to the original response for the pre-existing
          category.  If the original response was &quot;Never consumed,&quot; then the
          consumption frequency for the &quot;Other food not listed&quot; replaced the
          original response.  Foods that were reported using frequency units
          were first converted to a common unit; the frequencies were summed
          to produce whole number estimates.  For example, if the reported
          frequency for the category &quot;Other vegetables&quot; was once per day and
          asparagus consumption once per week was reported for &quot;other food
          not listed,&quot; then the frequency for asparagus consumption was added
          to the frequency of the &quot;Other vegetables&quot; category and
          recalculated as a consumption of eight per week.  When it was not
          possible to recode a response, a determination was made about
          whether a new category should be created based on the reported
          frequency of the food or whether the food represented an important
          source of a specific nutrient.  The following eight new food groups
          were defined:


          01   Egg substitutes
          02   Decaffeinated coffee and espresso
          03   Decaffeinated/herbal tea
          04   Sports drinks, fruit drinks (excluding juices but including
               tamarind drinks), and popsicles
          05   Water, including tap, mineral, spring, seltzer, soda
          06   Soy products, including tofu, soy milk, soy ice cream, soy
               cheese, soy hamburgers, soy hot dogs, soy flour, and textured
               vegetable protein
          07   Non-alcoholic beer/wine
          08   Others not specified or not elsewhere classified, including
               diet, breakfast, and nutrition drinks, pudding, condiments,

                       DIAGNOSTIC INTERVIEW SCHEDULE (DIS)

     The mental health component of NHANES III included the depression
     and mania modules from the Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS)
     originally developed for the National Institute of Mental Health
     (NIMH) Epidemiologic Catchment Area (ECA) program.  Trained
     interviewers administered the NHANES III DIS questions in the
     MEC, using automated data entry, as part of the MEC Youth
     Questionnaire for examinees 15-16 years of age and as part of the
     MEC Adult Questionnaire for examinees 17-39 years of age.  The
     data from the DIS permit diagnoses based on the third edition of
     the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-
     III).

     The final MEC examination weight (MTPFEX6) should be used for analysis
     of the questionnaires and measurements administered in the MEC, as well
     as for a combined analysis of measurements from the MEC examinations and
     associated medical history questions from the household interview.  The
     household questionnaire data files include information on survey design
     and basic demographic variables which may be linked to the examination
     data file by using the unique survey participant identifier SEQN.  For
     more information on the use of sample weights in NHANES III data
     analysis, refer to the NHANES III Analytic and Reporting Guidelines
     (U.S. DHHS, 1996b).

     The DIS is a complicated questionnaire with a number of parallel
     series of questions and many skip instructions.  The notes below
     describe these question series and skip patterns, and analysts
     are instructed to carefully read these notes in their entirety in
     order to facilitate analysis of this data.  The Plan and Operation of
     the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1988-94,
     page 362, (NCHS, 1994; U.S. DHHS, 1996b) contains a flow chart of the
     probe questions and skips from the DIS.

     All variable names in the DIS portion of the MEC interviews start
     with the prefix MQP.  The M indicates that it came from the MEC
     interview, the Q indicates that the data transcend the boundaries
     of separate adult (A) and youth (Y) interviews (sample persons
     ranged from ages 15-39) and the P indicates the data came from
     the primary interview.

     Any sample person who was age 15 to 39 was eligible to receive
     this section of the adult or youth MEC questionnaire.  A sample
     person who was not eligible to receive this section of the
     questionnaire will have all blanks in this section.  Note that
     selected questions may be blank in the DIS section if the
     question was not applicable for the sample person to answer
     because of answers they had given to other questions.   Also note
     that many of the questions have combined the &quot;Don't know&quot; and
     &quot;No&quot; category into a single response and this combination will
     vary per question in the DIS section.


     Approximately 3.7% (322/8773) of the NHANES III sample did not
     have valid depression and mania sections of the questionnaire,
     with an additional 18 or 0.2% missing all or part of one section
     or the other.  The major reasons for these missing data are that
     respondents:  1) ran out of time, 2) felt the material was too
     sensitive, usually because they were using an interpreter, 3) had
     comprehension problems due to cognitive impairment, 4) primary
     language was not English or Spanish, or 5) refused to answer or
     were not asked critical questions.  All of the questions for
     these sample persons were coded &quot;Blank but applicable.&quot;

     NOTES


     MQPDLANG:  Language used to conduct DIS

          MQPDLANG is the language in which the DIS portion of the
          interview was conducted and it is exactly the same as
          MQPLANG (the language of the MEC interview) except when a
          comment indicated that the DIS portion of the interview had
          been conducted in Spanish.  There were 41 adults and 32
          youth where this change was made in the study.  Most
          Hispanic youth spoke English fluently enough that a Spanish
          translation was not necessary, therefore, no computerized
          version of the youth interview was available in Spanish.  It
          was only given on hard copy.  MQPDLANG was set to 4, Spanish
          Youth, only if the variable DMAETHNR was greater than or
          equal to 3 and MQPLANG was equal to 3, and the examination was
          given on hard copy (MQPHCFLG=1) or a specific comment was
          made that indicates the interview was given in Spanish.


     MQPDPFLG, MQPMNFLG:  Depression and mania completeness flags

          When a code of  &quot;1&quot; is given to the depression (MQPDPFLG) or
          mania (MQPMNFLG) completeness flag, the  respondent only
          answered the lifetime symptom questions  (16 for depression
          and 9 for mania) and any appropriate probe questions.  It
          was then determined in MQPG21, a check item, that there were
          not enough positive symptom groups to continue asking
          questions  (MQPG21=3 or MQPG50=3 for depression and mania,
          respectively).  The diagnosis of major depressive episode
          (MQPDEP) or manic episode (MQPMANIA), respectively, is set
          to &quot;No.&quot;

          When a code of &quot;2&quot; is given to the depression  (MQPDPFLG) or mania
          (MQPMNFLG) completeness flag, the respondent answered not only the
          lifetime symptom questions (16 for depression and 9 for mania) and
          any appropriate probe questions but also one or more of the
          questions concerning clustering of the positive symptom groups.
          These sample persons can skip out of the section at several
          different points, but they never answer questions past MQPG26 or
          MQPG55, respectively, and they cannot have a positive diagnosis for
          major depressive episode (MQPDEP) or manic episode  (MQPMANIA).
          The diagnosis of major depressive episode or manic episode,
          respectively, is set to &quot;No.&quot;

          When a code of  &quot;3&quot; is given to the depression  (MQPDPFLG)
          or mania (MQPMNFLG) completeness flag, the respondent
          answered not only the lifetime symptom questions (16 for
          depression and 9 for mania) and any appropriate probe
          questions but also all the questions concerning clustering
          of the positive symptom groups and the worst episode.  These
          sample persons should have answers to all questions in their
          respective sections and have the chance for a positive
          diagnosis for major depressive episode (MQPDEP) or manic
          episode  (MQPMANIA).  The diagnosis of major depressive
          episode ranges from 1-5 and the diagnosis of manic episode
          ranges from 1-3.

          When a code of  &quot;4&quot; is given, the lifetime symptoms were
          completed and the sample person met criteria to continue
          answering questions (MQPG21=1 or 2), but the remaining
          section of questions needed to make a diagnosis were not
          ascertained (blank, but applicable) or were all answered
          &quot;don't know.&quot;  This is not the same as MQPG21=3 or
          MQPDPFLG=1 where sample persons only answered the lifetime
          symptom questions because they did not have enough positive
          symptoms to qualify to answer the remaining questions.

          When a code of  &quot;5&quot; is given, the depression and/or mania
          section should have been given, but was not, so all fields
          are filled with 8's (blank but applicable).

          Lastly, a blank in this field indicates the sample  person
          was not in the acceptable age range and was not eligible for
          the depression or mania questions.

          In short, the flags divide the data into five groups:

          1.   Lifetime symptoms answered, insufficient number positive to
               ask clustering questions

          2.   Sufficient lifetime symptoms present but do not
               cluster in spells of sufficient duration

          3.   Sufficient lifetime symptoms present and cluster
               in spells of sufficient duration, and may or may
               not meet criteria for positive diagnosis

          4.   Sufficient lifetime symptoms present but no
               information available if cluster in spells of
               sufficient duration - missing diagnosis

          5.   No information available, but should have been
               collected - missing diagnosis

          Blank values appear where the DIS not applicable.



     MQPHCFLG:  Hard copy flag

          Although in almost all circumstances the DIS section of the
          interview was given using the computerized version, there
          were certain situations where a paper copy was used.  This
          would occur only when there was a computer failure or for
          youth who required a Spanish version.   These interviews are
          considered valid, but responses to probe questions were not
          recorded, and are therefore set to 8's (blank but
          applicable).


     MQPG0501-MQPG1301, MQPG05L-MQPG12L, MQPG1501-MQPG1601,
     MQPG14L-MQPG20L:  Lifetime symptoms of depression

          The questionnaire inquires whether a symptom has occurred at
          any time in life (G5-G20).  Each of these DIS symptom
          questions can take a value of  &quot;1-4.&quot;  The value &quot;2&quot; means
          the respondent said &quot;No&quot; or &quot;Don't know.&quot;  If the respondent
          said &quot;Yes,&quot; additional &quot;probe&quot; questions were asked.  First,
          the respondent was asked if they told a doctor about the
          symptom.  The answer to this probe question is included
          after each respective lifetime symptom.  When the interview
          was given on hard copy (i.e., not by computer - See
          MQPHCFLG, a flag for hard copy), no probe questions were
          recorded so the probe questions are filled with 8's (blank
          but applicable).

          The respondent was then asked if the symptom was always due
          to a physical illness or injury (this included pregnancy).
          If the respondent said &quot;Yes,&quot; then a &quot;4&quot; was coded.  If the
          respondent said &quot;No,&quot; then he/she was next asked whether the
          symptom always occurred when he/she used medicine, alcohol,
          or drugs.  If the respondent said &quot;Yes,&quot; then a &quot;3&quot; was
          coded.  If the respondent said &quot;No,&quot; then a &quot;1&quot;  was coded.
          A value of &quot;1&quot; indicates that the possibility of this being
          a symptom of a mental disorder cannot be ruled out.
          Additional probes were asked for G13.  (See notes for
          MQPG1302-MQPG1304.)


          As a word of caution, in the Spanish version of question G8,
          &quot;Have you ever had a period of two weeks or more when you
          had trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or with waking
          up too early?,&quot; the phrase used for &quot;falling asleep&quot; really
          meant &quot;staying asleep&quot; rather than what was intended.  Still
          another phrase was used for the part of the question
          &quot;staying asleep.&quot;  Consequently, &quot;staying asleep&quot; was well
          covered and &quot;falling asleep&quot; was not.  There is no way to
          tell to what extent this affected the number of positive
          responses.



     MQPDGP1L-MQPDGP8L:  Summary questions

          The lifetime depressive symptom questions (G5-G20) are
          arranged in eight groups, each of which approximates one of
          the diagnostic criteria in Section B of the definition of a
          major depressive episode from the American Psychiatric
          Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Third
          Edition (DSM-III).

          MQPDGP1L- MQPDGP8L are the eight summary variables which
          indicate the number of positive (1's) lifetime symptoms in
          each of the respective groups.


     MQPG13L, MQPG1302-MQPG1304:  Decreased interest in sex

          If the respondent answered &quot;Yes&quot; to the initial question
          (G13: decreased interest in sex), a series of additional
          questions was asked (MQPG1302- MQPG1304).  If the respondent
          answered &quot;No&quot; to all three questions, then a code &quot;6&quot; (yes,
          but wasn't bothered) was entered for G13, indicating that
          the symptom was below the diagnostic threshold.  If the
          respondent answered &quot;Yes&quot; to any one of these three
          additional questions, then the normal &quot;probe&quot; questions were
          asked, leading to an assignment of values 1, 3, 4, that is,
          whether the symptom was always due to physical illness or
          injury or medicine, alcohol, or drugs;  any remaining parts
          of MQPG1302-MQPG1304 were skipped after a &quot;Yes&quot; response to
          any one of the probes.

          If the respondent volunteered that he/she had never been
          interested in sex, the value &quot;5&quot; (no interest ever) was
          coded.


     MQPG21-MQPG25:  Depression module decision points

          Item G21 asks the interviewer whether three or more summary
          groups of the possible eight had at least one &quot;Yes&quot; response
          coded.  If there were fewer than three, all the remaining
          DIS depression questions were skipped and the interviewer
          moved to the mania questions (G41-G49).

          If a respondent had three or more DSM-III symptoms during
          his/her life (G21), the interviewer asked one of two
          parallel series of questions to determine whether questions
          pertaining to the worst depressive episode should be asked.
          The series of questions are explained below:


          Series A, Questions G22, G23, and G26:  G21 was coded &quot;1&quot; if
          there were three or more depressive symptoms and the
          respondent answered &quot;Yes&quot; to the initial question (G2) about
          two weeks or more of feeling sad, blue, or depressed.  The
          respondent was then asked G22 about having these problems
          cluster in time, in the same month.  If the answer was
          &quot;Yes,&quot; G26 was asked.  If the response to G22 was &quot;No&quot;
          (meaning the problems did not cluster in the same month),
          then a second question about temporal clustering was asked
          (G23).  If the respondent again denied having problems
          cluster (&quot;Yes, never been a period&quot;), the remaining
          depression questions were skipped and the interviewer moved
          on to the mania questions.  If the respondent said &quot;No, has
          been a period&quot; to G23, then G26 was asked.

          Series B Questions G24, G25, and G26:  G21 was coded &quot;2&quot; if
          there were three or more depressive symptoms and the
          respondent answered &quot;No&quot; to the initial question (G2) about
          ever having had two weeks or more of feeling sad, blue, or
          depressed.  G24 was then asked to determine if several of
          the depressive symptoms (G5-G20) were clustered together in
          the same month.  If the answer to this was &quot;No,&quot; then the
          remaining DIS depression questions were skipped and the
          interviewer moved on to the mania questions.  If the answer
          was &quot;Yes&quot; then G25 was asked, which elicits symptoms of
          &quot;masked depression.&quot;  If the respondent indicated that
          he/she felt &quot;low, gloomy, blue, or uninterested&quot; then he/she
          was asked G26.  If the respondent indicated that he/she felt
          &quot;okay,&quot; the remaining DIS depression questions were skipped
          and the interviewer moved on to the mania questions.


     MQPG05W-MQPG20W:  Worst episode depressive symptoms

          These questions ask about symptoms during the worst episode
          identified in G40.  Each of the questions about a worst
          depressive episode is parallel to one of the lifetime
          depression questions:  for example, MQPG05L asks &quot;has there
          ever been a period of two weeks or longer when you lost your
          appetite?&quot;  The corresponding worst episode question,
          MQPG05W, asks, &quot;Did you lose your appetite?&quot;  The worst
          episode question (in this example, MQPG05W) was only asked
          if the corresponding lifetime question (in this example,
          MQPG05L) was coded &quot;1.&quot;  The  worst episode question was
          coded &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No,&quot; indicating the presence or absence of
          the symptom during the worst depressive episode.  A
          diagnosis of major depressive episode was based on the
          symptoms during the worst depressive episode
          (MQPG05W-MQPG20W) which are transformed into eight DSM-III
          symptom groups (MQPDGP1W-MQPDGP8W), and is not based on the
          lifetime depressive symptoms (MQPG05L-MQPG20L).


     MQPG41L-MQPG49L:   Lifetime symptoms of mania

          The questionnaire inquires about whether a symptom has
          occurred at any time in life (G41-G49).  Each of these
          (DIS) symptom questions can take a value of  &quot;1-3.&quot;  The
          value &quot;2&quot; means the respondent said &quot;No&quot; or &quot;don't know.&quot;
          If the respondent said &quot;Yes,&quot; two additional &quot;probe&quot;
          questions were asked.  The respondent was asked whether the
          symptom ever occurred when he/she used medicine, alcohol, or
          drugs.  If the respondent said &quot;Yes,&quot; then he/she was next
          asked whether the symptom always occurred when he/she used
          medicine, alcohol, or drugs.  If the respondent said &quot;Yes,&quot;
          then a &quot;3&quot;  was coded.  If the respondent said &quot;No&quot; to
          either question, than a &quot;1&quot;  was coded.  A value of  &quot;1&quot;
          indicates that the possibility of this being a symptom of a
          mental disorder cannot be ruled out.  When the interview was
          given on hard copy  (i.e., not by computer - See MQPHCFLG, a
          flag for hard copy), responses to probe questions were not
          recorded so the probe questions are filled with 8's (blank
          but applicable).


     MQPG47EX:  Examples of special gift or power

          If the respondent answered &quot;Yes&quot; to G47L, possessing a
          special gift or power, they were asked for an example.
          Since a high percentage of the examples given had to do with
          extra sensory perception (ESP), it was decided to code these
          examples into two categories, ESP and other.  There were not
          enough examples with similar characteristics to code any
          other group.

          The query regarding special gifts or powers is intended to
          elicit reports of beliefs about the self which are psychotic
          in nature.  If the example did not meet this precept, the
          symptom (MQPG47L) was coded &quot;No&quot; and the example deleted.


     MQPG50-MQPG54:  Mania module decision points

          Item G50 asks the interviewer whether two or more lifetime
          symptoms of the possible eight (MQPG42L- MQPG49L) had at
          least one response of &quot;1&quot; coded.  If there was a &quot;Yes&quot;
          response of one or less lifetime symptoms, all the remaining
          mania questions were skipped and the interviewer moved to
          the next section.  The remaining DIS questions were coded as
          blank.

          If a respondent had two or more DSM-III symptoms during
          his/her life, the interviewer asked one of three parallel
          series of questions to determine whether questions
          pertaining to the worst episode of mania should be asked or
          possibly skipped to the next section.  The three series are
          explained below:


          Series A, Questions G51, G52, and G55:  G50 was coded &quot;1&quot; if
          there were two or more symptoms of mania and the respondent
          answered &quot;Yes&quot; to the initial question (G41) about one week
          or more of feeling high or manic.  The respondent was then
          asked G51 about having these problems cluster in time, in
          the same month.  If the answer was &quot;Yes,&quot; G55 was asked.  If
          the response to G51 was &quot;No&quot; (meaning the problems did not
          cluster in the same month), then a second question about
          temporal clustering was asked (G52).  If the respondent
          again denied having problems cluster (&quot;Yes, never been a
          period&quot;), the remaining mania questions were skipped and the
          interviewer moved on to the next section.  If the respondent
          said &quot;No, has been a period&quot; to G52, G55 was asked.

          Series B, Questions G53-G55:  G50 was coded &quot;2&quot;  if there
          were three or more symptoms of mania and the respondent
          answered &quot;No&quot; or &quot;Always due to medication/drugs/alcohol&quot; to
          the initial question (G41) about ever having had one week or
          more of feeling high or manic.  G53 was then asked to
          determine if several of the depressive symptoms (G42-G49)
          were clustered together in the same month.  If the answer to
          this was &quot;No,&quot; then the remaining DIS mania questions were
          skipped and the interviewer moved on to the next section.
          If the answer was &quot;Yes&quot; then G54 was asked, which elicits
          symptoms of irritable mood.  If the respondent indicated
          that he/she felt &quot;unusually irritable or likely to fight or
          argue&quot; then he/she was asked G55.  If the respondent
          indicated that he/she never felt irritable, the remaining
          DIS mania questions were skipped and the interviewer moved
          on to the next section.

          Series C:  G50 was coded &quot;3&quot; if:  1) there were only two
          symptoms of mania coded &quot;1&quot; and the respondent answered &quot;No&quot;
          or &quot;Always due to medication/drugs/alcohol&quot; to the initial
          question (G41) about ever having had one week or more of
          feeling high or manic, i.e., responses &quot;2&quot; or &quot;3;&quot; or,
          2)there was only one or less symptoms of mania coded &quot;1.&quot;
          With these combinations, the remaining DIS mania questions
          were skipped and the interviewer moved on to the next
          section.



     MQPG42W-MQPG49W:  Worst episode symptoms of mania

          These questions ask about symptoms during the worst episode
          of mania identified in G66.  Each of the questions about a
          worst episode of mania is parallel to one of the lifetime
          mania questions:  for example, MQPG42L asks &quot;has there ever
          been a period of a week or more when you were so much more
          active than usual that you or your family or friends were
          concerned about it?&quot;  The corresponding worst episode
          question, MQPG42W, asks, &quot;Were you so much more active than
          usual that you or your family or friends were concerned
          about it?&quot;  The worst episode question (in this example,
          MQPG42W) was only asked if the corresponding lifetime
          question  (in this example, MQPG42L) was coded &quot;1.&quot;  The
          worst episode question was coded &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No,&quot; indicating
          the presence or absence of the symptom during the worst
          episode of mania.  A diagnosis of manic episode  was based
          on the symptoms during the worst episode of mania MQPG42W-
          MQPG49W) which were transformed into seven DSM-III symptom
          groups (MQPMNG1W-MQPMNG7W), and is not based on the lifetime
          symptoms of mania (MQPG42L- MQPG49L).



     MQPDGP1W-MQPDGP8W, MQPDYSFR, MQPDEP:  The diagnostic variable
               &quot;MQPDEP&quot;

          The variable MQPDEP indicates the diagnosis of major
          depressive episode which is based on Criteria A and B of the
          DSM-III definition of major depressive episode.  Criteria C
          and D were not assessed, and E was only assessed for
          bereavement.  The minimum severity requirement is that these
          symptoms cause help-seeking or subjective impairment (at
          least one &quot;Yes&quot; to G28-G31).

          Criterion A for the diagnosis of major depressive episode in
          DSM- III calls for &quot;dysphoric mood or loss of interest or
          pleasure in all or almost all usual activities and
          pastimes.&quot;  If the respondent said &quot;Yes&quot; to the initial
          depression question (G2), or if there were at least two
          weeks of dysphoria combined with some other problems (G26),
          then the person was said to have &quot;dysphoria,&quot; and was
          considered to have met Criterion A for the diagnosis of
          major depressive episode (MQPDYSFR=1).

          The DSM-III definition of Criterion B for major depressive
          episode contains eight symptoms, at least four (4 &lt;=MQPDGPSW
          &lt;= 8) of which must be present during a depressive episode
          in order to qualify for a diagnosis.  These eight symptoms
          are approximated by the following NHANES III questions
          (Note that the DSM-III Symptoms are given in the order that
          they are asked in the DIS, rather than the order in the
          DSM-III Manual):


          DSM-III Symptom                    NHANES III Questions

          1. Appetite or weight change         G05W, G06W, or G07W
          2. Insomnia or hypersomnia           G08W or G09W
          3. Loss or energy, fatigue           G10W
          4. Agitation or retardation          G11W or G12W
          5. Loss of interest in sex           G13W
          6. Feeling worthless or guilty       G14W
          7. Trouble thinking, concentrating   G15W or G16W
          8. Thoughts of death or suicide      G17W, G18W, G19W, or
                                               G20W


          MQPDGP1W-MQPDGP8W give the number of positive items per
          group for the eight corresponding groups above.

          Criterion &quot;E&quot; is only assessed by the absence of
          uncomplicated bereavement as the cause of depression, i.e.,
          depressed spells were never due to the death of someone
          close to the respondent or they may have been caused by
          things other than death (MQPG34 = 2).

          The variable MQPDEP can take seven values:

          1    No diagnosis
          2    Major depressive episode without severity
          3    Major depressive episode with severity
          4    Severe bereavement
          5    Non-severe bereavement
          88   Blank but applicable
          Blank

          MQPDEP = 1.  No major depressive episode was diagnosed if
          the respondent answered sufficient questions so that
          Criteria A and B could be determined and did not qualify for
          a diagnosis of major depressive episode or bereavement (as
          defined below).

          MQPDEP = 2.  Major depressive episode without severity was
          diagnosed if Criteria A, B and E were met but without
          severity (all no's for G28-G31).

          MQPDEP = 3.  Major depressive episode with severity was
          diagnosed if Criteria A, B, and E were met plus severity (at
          least one &quot;Yes&quot; to G28-G31).

          MQPDEP = 4.  Severe bereavement meets Criteria A and B plus
          severity (i.e., MQPDEP=3), but depressed spells ONLY due to
          death of someone close (MQPG34=1).

          MQPDEP = 5.  Non-severe bereavement meets Criteria A and B
          but not severity (i.e., MQPDEP=2), but depressed spells ONLY
          due to death of someone close (MQPG34=1).


          MQPDEP = 88.  The major depressive episode variable was
          coded a &quot;Blank but applicable&quot; value if the respondent did
          not answer sufficient questions so that Criteria A and B
          could be determined.  The respondent must answer the initial
          depression question (MQPG02) and at least 11 of the lifetime
          symptom questions (MQPG05L-MQPG20L) as well as the appropriate
          worst episode symptom questions (MQPG05W-MQPG20W).

          MQPDEP = Blank.  The major depressive episode variable was
          coded a &quot;Blank&quot; if the sample person was not eligible to
          receive the depression questions.


     MQPDPSX1-MQPDPSX2, MQPDGPSW:  Total depressive symptom group
               counts

          The two variables MQPDGPSW and MQPDPSX2 report the total
          number of positive depressive symptom groups in the worst
          episode (sum of all groups where MQPDGP1W to MQPDGP8W
          contained at least one positive symptom) and lifetime (sum
          of all groups where MQPDGP1L to MQPDGP8L contained at least
          one positive symptom), respectively.  The latter also adds
          dysphoria (MQPDYSFR=1).  These variables range from 0-8 and
          0-9, respectively.  MQPDGPSW is used in determining the
          diagnosis of major depressive episode and MQPDPSX2 is used
          in the total symptom count.

          The variable MQPDPSX1 reports the total number of positive
          symptoms in the worst episode (sum of MQPDGP1W to MQPDGP8W)
          plus dysphoria (MQPDYSFR=1) with a range of 0-17. (Note that
          this variable is a sum of positive symptoms, not positive
          symptom groups.)


     MQPFDDP, MQPLDDP:  Age of first and last depressive symptoms

          The two variables MQPFDDP and MQPLDDP code the age of the
          respondent the first and last time, respectively, he/she
          experienced depressive symptoms if he/she ever met criteria
          for any major depressive episode (2 &lt;= MQPDEP &lt;= 5).
          MQPFDDP uses the age in MQPG32 and MQPLDDP combine the age
          and time frame information in MQPG35, MQPG36 and MQPG37.


     MQPMNGP1-MQPNMGP7, MQPEUFOR, MQPMANIA:  The diagnostic variable
               &quot;MQPMANIA&quot;

          The variable MQPMANIA indicates the diagnosis of manic
          episode which is based on Criteria A and B of the DSM-III
          definition of manic episode.  Criteria C, D and E were not
          assessed.  The minimum severity requirement is that these
          symptoms cause help-seeking or subjective impairment (at
          least one &quot;Yes&quot; in MQPG57-MQPG60).


          Criterion A for the diagnosis of manic episode in DSM-III
          calls for &quot;one or more distinct periods with a predominantly
          elevated, expansive, or irritable mood.&quot;  If the respondent
          said &quot;Yes&quot; to the initial mania question (MQPG41L=1) then
          the respondent was considered euphoric (MQPEUFOR=2).  If the
          respondent said &quot;Yes&quot; (1) to MQPG54 then the respondent was
          considered irritable (MQPEUFOR=1).

          The DSM-III definition of Criterion B for manic episode
          requires a duration of at least one week during which, for
          most of the time, at least three of the seven symptoms have
          persisted (four if the mood is only irritable) and have been
          present to a significant degree.  These seven symptoms are
          approximated by the following NHANES III questions:

          DSM-III Symptom                     NHANES III Questions

          1.   Hyperactivity/hypersexuality       G42W or G44W
          2.   Pressure to keep talking           G45W
          3.   Thoughts racing                    G46W
          4.   Inflated self-esteem e.g.,
               special gifts or powers            G47W
          5.   Decreased need for sleep           G48W
          6.   Distractibility                    G49W
          7.   Excessive involvement in
               activities that have a high
               potential for painful
               consequences which is not
               recognized, e.g., buying sprees    G43W

          MQPMNG1W-MQPMNG7W give whether the symptom is present or not
          for the seven corresponding groups above.

          The variable MQPMANIA can take five values:

           1    No diagnosis
           2    Manic episode without severity
           3    Manic episode with severity
           88   Blank but applicable
           Blank

          MQPMANIA = 1.  No mania episode was diagnosed if the
          respondent answered sufficient questions so that Criteria A
          and B could be determined and did not qualify for a
          diagnosis of manic episode.

          MQPMANIA = 2.  Manic episode without severity was diagnosed
          if Criteria A and B were met but without severity (all no's
          for MQPG57-MQPG60).

          MQPMANIA = 3.  Manic episode with severity was diagnosed if
          Criteria A and B were met as well as severity (at least one
          &quot;Yes&quot; for MQPG57-MQPG60).


          MQPMANIA = 88.  The manic episode variable was coded a
          &quot;Blank but applicable&quot; value if the respondent did not
          answer sufficient questions so that Criteria A and B could
          be determined.  The respondent must answer the initial mania
          question (MQPG41), or the irritability question (MQPG54),
          and at least 6 of the lifetime symptom questions
          (MQPG41L-MQPG49L) as well as the appropriate worse episode
          symptom questions (MQPG42W-MQPG49W).

          MQPMANIA = Blank.  The manic episode variable was coded a
          &quot;Blank&quot; if the sample person was not eligible to receive the
          mania questions.

     MQPMNGSW, MQPMNSX1-MQPMNSX2:  Total manic symptom group counts

          The two variables MQPMNGSW and MQPMNSX2 code the total
          number of positive manic symptom groups in the worst episode
          (sum of groups MQPMNGP1 to MQPMNGP7 with a &quot;Yes&quot; response)
          and during lifetime (questions MQPG42L to MQPG49L are
          grouped into DSM-III groups 1 to 7 and the number of
          positive groups is counted), respectively.  The latter also
          adds the euphoria or irritability symptom (1 &lt;= MQPEUFOR &lt;=
          2).  These variables range from 0-7 and 0-8, respectively.
          MQPMNGSW is used in determining the diagnosis of manic
          episode and MQPMNSX2 is used in the total symptom count.

          The variable MQPMNSX1 reports the total number of positive
          symptoms in the worst episode (sum of MQPMNGP1 to MQPMNGP8)
          plus euphoria or irritable mood (1 &lt;= MQPEUFOR &lt;= 2) with a
          range of 0-8. (Note that this variable is a sum of positive
          symptoms, not positive symptom groups).


     MQPFDMN, MQPLDMN:  Age of first and last manic symptoms

          The two variables MQPFDMN and MQPLDMN report the age of the
          respondent the first and last time, respectively, he/she
          experienced manic symptoms if he/she ever met criteria for
          any manic episode (2 &lt;= MQPMANIA &lt;= 3).  MQPFDMN uses the
          age in MQPG61 and MQPLDMN combines the age and time frame
          information in MQPG62, MQPG63 and MQPG64.


     MQPDEPSE:  The diagnostic variable &quot;MQPDEPSE&quot;

          The variable MQPDEPSE indicates the DSM-III diagnosis of
          major depression, single episode, and is constructed using
          MQPDEP and MQPMANIA.  The diagnosis of major depression,
          single episode is not made if the depression is the sole
          result of severe or non-severe bereavement (MQPDEP= 4 or 5)
          or if a manic episode is present (MQPMANIA= 2 or 3).  There
          must be only one episode of major depression.

          The variable MQPDEPSE can take five values:

           1    No diagnosis
           2    Major depression, single episode without severity
           3    Major depression, single episode with severity
           88   Blank but applicable
           Blank

          MQPDEPSE = 1.  No major depressive episode was diagnosed
          (MQPDEP=1) although there could be severe or non-severe
          bereavement (MQPDEP=4 or 5) or some form of mania was
          diagnosed (MQPMANIA=2 or 3).

          MQPDEPSE = 2.  A single episode (MQPG27=1) of major
          depression without severity was diagnosed (MQPDEP=2) and no
          manic episodes were present (MQPMANIA=1).  MQPDEPSE = 3.  A
          single episode (MQPG27=1) of major depression with severity
          was diagnosed (MQPDEP=3) and no manic episodes were present
          (MQPMANIA=1).

          MQPDEPSE = 88.  The major depression, single episode
          variable was coded &quot;Blank but applicable&quot; if one of the
          following is true:

          1.   MQPDEPSE=1 and MQPBIPOL= (Blank or 88) and
               MQPDEP= (Blank or 88)
          2.   MQPDEPSE=1 and MQPBIPOL= (Blank or 88) and MQPDEP=3
          3.   MQPDEPSE=1 and MQPBIPOL=1 and MQPDEP= (Blank or 88)
          4.   MQPDEPSE=1 and MQPBIPOL=1 and MQPDEP=3 and
               MQPG27= (Blank, 888, or 999)

          MQPDEPSE = Blank.  The major depression, single episode
          variable was coded a &quot;Blank&quot; if the sample person was not
          eligible to receive the depression/mania questions.


     MQPFDDSE, MQPLDDSE:  Age of first and last depressive symptoms
               associated with major depression, single episode

          The two variables MQPFDDSE and MQPLDDSE code the age of the
          respondent the first and last time, respectively, he/she
          experienced depressive symptoms if he/she ever met criteria
          for a major depression, single episode which was not due
          solely to bereavement (2 &lt;= MQPDEPSE &lt;= 3).  MQPFDDSE uses
          the age in MQPFDDP and MQPLDDSE uses the age in MQPLDDP.


     MQPDEPRT:  The diagnostic variable &quot;MQPDEPRT&quot;

          The variable MQPDEPRT indicates the DSM-III diagnosis of
          major depression, recurrent, and is constructed using MQPDEP
          and MQPMANIA.  The diagnosis of major depression, recurrent,
          is not made if the depression is the sole result of severe
          or non-severe bereavement (MQPDEP=4 or 5) or if a manic
          episode is present (MQPMANIA= 2 or 3).  There must be more
          than one episode of major depression.

          The variable MQPDEPRT can take five values:

           1    No diagnosis
           2    Major depression, recurrent without severity
           3    Major depression, recurrent with severity
           88   Blank but applicable
           Blank


          MQPDEPRT = 1.  No major depressive episode was diagnosed
          (MQPDEP=1) although there could be severe or non-severe
          bereavement (MQPDEP=4 or 5) or some form of mania was
          diagnosed (MQPMANIA=2 or 3).

          MQPDEPRT = 2.  Recurrent episodes (2 &lt;= MQPG27 &lt;= (whole
          life) or don't know how many spells) of major depression
          without severity were diagnosed (MQPDEP=2) and no manic
          episodes were present (MQPMANIA=1).

          MQPDEPRT = 3.  Recurrent episodes (2 &lt;= MQPG27 &lt;= (whole
          life) or don't know how many spells) of major depression
          with severity were diagnosed (MQPDEP=3) and no manic
          episodes were present (MQPMANIA=1).

          MQPDEPRT = 88.  The major depression, recurrent variable was
          coded &quot;Blank but applicable&quot; if one of the following is
          true:

          1.   MQPDEPRT=1 and MQPBIPOL= (Blank or 88) and
               MQPDEP= (Blank or 88)
          2.   MQPDEPRT=1 and MQPBIPOL= (Blank or 88) and MQPDEP=3
          3.   MQPDEPRT=1 and MQPBIPOL=1 and MQPDEP= (Blank or 88)
          4.   MQPDEPRT=1 and MQPBIPOL=1 and MQPDEP=3 and
               MQPG27= (Blank, 888, or 999)

          MQPDEPRT = Blank.  The major depression, recurrent variable
          was coded a &quot;Blank&quot; if the sample person was not eligible to
          receive the depression/mania questions.


     MQPFDDRT, MQPLDDRT:  Age of first and last depressive symptoms
               associated with major depression, recurrent

          The two variables MQPFDDRT and MQPLDDRT report the age of
          the respondent the first and last time, respectively, he/she
          experienced depressive symptoms if he/she ever met criteria
          for major depression, recurrent, which was not due solely to
          bereavement (2 &lt;= MQPDEPRT &lt;= 3).  MQPFDDRT uses the age in
          MQPFDDP and MQPLDDRT uses the age in MQPLDDP.


     MQPDYSA, MQPDYSD, MQPDYSTH:    The diagnostic variable &quot;MQPDYSTH&quot;

          The variable MQPDYSTH indicates the diagnosis of dysthymic
          disorder.  The diagnosis of dysthymic disorder is based on
          Criteria A through D of the DSM-III definition of dysthymic
          disorder.  Criteria E and F were not assessed.  This
          disorder differs from major depressive disorder in that
          during the past two years, the individual has been bothered
          most or all of the time by symptoms characteristic of the
          depressive syndrome but that are not of sufficient severity
          and duration to meet the criteria for a major depressive
          episode.

          Criteria A, B, and C of the DSM-III are encompassed in the
          variable MQPDYSA.  This requires two years or more of
          predominately depressive mood or marked loss of interest or
          pleasure in all, or almost all, usual activities and
          pastimes (MQPG03=1 or 104 weeks &lt;= MQPG26 &lt;= whole life).

          The DSM-III definition of Criterion D for dysthymic disorder
          contains 13 symptoms, at least three (3 &lt;= MQPDYSD &lt;= 7) of
          which must be present during the depressive periods in order
          to qualify for a diagnosis.  Seven of these symptoms are
          covered by the following NHANES III questions.

          12.  Crying spells

          The variable MQPDYSTH can take five values:

           1    No diagnosis
           2    Dysthymic disorder with no major depressive
                episode
           3    Dysthymic disorder with major depressive episode
           88   Blank but applicable
          Blank

          MQPDYSTH = 1.  No dysthymic disorder was diagnosed if the
          respondent answered sufficient questions so that Criteria A
          through D could be determined and did not qualify for a diagnosis
          of dysthymic disorder.

          MQPDYSTH = 2.  Dysthymic disorder was diagnosed if the
          respondent met Criteria A through D but did not have a diagnosis
          of major depressive episode (MQPDEP not equal to 3).

          MQPDYSTH = 3.  Dysthymic disorder was diagnosed if the respondent
          met Criteria A through D and had a diagnosis of major depressive
          episode as well (MQPDEP = 3).

          MQPDYSTH = 88.  The dysthymic disorder variable was coded a
          &quot;Blank but applicable&quot; value if the respondent did not
          answer sufficient questions so that Criteria A through D
          could be determined.  The respondent must answer the initial
          two year depression question MQPG03 or the length of spell
          question MQPG26 and at least nine of the 12 lifetime symptom
          questions listed above for Criterion D plus MQPG03.

          MQPDYSTH = Blank.  The dysthymic disorder variable was coded
          a &quot;Blank&quot; if the sample person was not eligible to receive
          the depression questions.



     MQPBIPOL:  The diagnostic variable &quot;MQPBIPOL&quot;

          The variable MQPBIPOL indicates the DSM-III diagnosis of
          bipolar disorder, and is constructed using MQPDEP and
          MQPMANIA.  The diagnosis of bipolar disorder is made only if
          there has ever been a manic episode.

          The variable MQPBIPOL can take eight values:

          MQPBIPOL = 1.  No bipolar disorder was diagnosed if there
          has never been a diagnosis of manic episode.

          MQPBIPOL = 2.  Bipolar disorder is diagnosed if severity and
          exclusion criteria are met for both a manic and a major
          depressive episode (MQPMANIA=3 and MQPDEP=3).

          MQPBIPOL = 3.  Bipolar disorder is diagnosed if severity and
          exclusion criteria are met for a manic episode (MQPMANIA=3),
          but a major depressive episode is either absent (MQPDEP=1,
          4 or 5) or the diagnosis is missing (MQPDEP=Blank or 88).

          MQPBIPOL = 4.  Bipolar disorder is diagnosed if severity and
          exclusion criteria are met for a manic episode (MQPMANIA=3), but
          not for a major depressive episode (MQPDEP=2).

          MQPBIPOL = 5.  Bipolar disorder is diagnosed if no manic
          episode met both severity and exclusion criteria
          (MQPMANIA=2) and a major depressive episode is either absent
          (MQPDEP=1, 4 or 5) or the diagnosis is missing (MQPDEP=Blank
          or 88).

          MQPBIPOL = 6.  Bipolar disorder is diagnosed if no manic
          episode met both severity and exclusion criteria
          (MQPMANIA=2) and the major depressive episodes may or may
          not meet both severity and exclusion criteria (MQPDEP=2 or
          3).

          MQPBIPOL = 88.  The bipolar disorder variable was coded a
          &quot;Blank but applicable&quot; value if the diagnosis for manic
          episode is missing (MQPMANIA=Blank or 88).

          MQPBIPOL = Blank.  The bipolar disorder variable was coded a
          &quot;Blank&quot; if the sample person was not eligible to receive the
          depression/mania questions.


     MQPFDBI, MQPLDBI:  Age of first and last manic symptoms
               associated with bipolar disorder

          The two variables MQPFDBI and MQPLDBI report the age of the
          respondent the first and last time, respectively, he/she
          experienced manic symptoms if he/she ever met criteria for
          any bipolar diagnosis (2 &lt;= MQPBIPOL &lt;= 6).  MQPFDBI uses
          age at first manic symptoms (MQPFDMN) when 2 &lt;= MQPBIPOL &lt;=
          6 or age at first depressive symptoms (MQPFDDP) if
          MQPBIPOL=2, 4 or 6 and 0 &lt;= MQPFDDP &lt;= MQPFDMN.  MQPLDBI
          uses age at last manic symptoms (MQPLDMN) when 2 &lt;= MQPBIPOL
          &lt;= 6 or age at last depressive symptoms (MQPLDDP) if
          MQPBIPOL=2, 4 or 6 and MQPLDDP &gt;= 0 and MQPLDMN &lt;= MGPLDDP
          &lt;= 54.


     MQPBIPII:  The diagnostic variable &quot;MQPBIPII&quot;

          The variables MQPDEP and MQPMANIA report the DSM- III
          syndromes of major depressive episode and manic episode,
          respectively, and are used to construct various DSM-III
          diagnoses.  The variable MQPBIPII is the DSM-III diagnosis
          of atypical bipolar disorder (bipolar disorder, type II).
          The diagnosis of atypical bipolar disorder is made only if
          the respondent:

          1.   Does not meet criteria for bipolar disorder
               (MQPBIPOL=1)

          2.   Does not meet criteria for a manic episode (MQPMANIA=1)

          3.   Has a major depressive episode (MQPDEP=2 or 3)

          4.   Has euphoria or irritability (1 &lt;= MQPEUFOR &lt;= 2)

          5.   Has some symptoms of mania (1 &lt;= MQPMNGSW &lt;= 3)


          The variable MQPBIPII can take five values:

           1    No diagnosis
           2    Atypical bipolar disorder without severity
           3    Atypical bipolar disorder with severity
           88   Blank but applicable
           Blank

          MQPBIPII = 1.  No atypical bipolar disorder is diagnosed if
          there has ever been a manic episode (2 &lt;= MQPMANIA &lt;= 3) or
          bipolar disorder (2 &lt;= MQPBIPOL &lt;= 6) and a major depressive
          episode is absent or missing (MQPDEP=1, 4, 5, 88, or Blank).

          MQPBIPII = 2.  Atypical bipolar disorder without severity is
          diagnosed if a major depressive episode without severity is
          present (MQPDEP=2) and the criteria for a manic episode is
          not met (MQPMANIA=1) but euphoria or irritability is present
          (1 &lt;= MQPEUFOR &lt;= 2) and some manic symptoms are present (1
          &lt;= MQPMNGSW &lt;= 3).


          MQPBIPII = 3.  Atypical bipolar disorder with severity is
          diagnosed if a major depressive episode with severity is
          present (MQPDEP=3) and the criteria for a manic episode is
          not met (MQPMANIA=1) but euphoria or irritability is present
          (1 &lt;= MQPEUFOR &lt;= 2) and some manic symptoms are present (1
          &lt;= MQPMNGSW &lt;= 3).

          MQPBIPII = 88.  The atypical bipolar disorder variable was
          coded &quot;Blank but applicable&quot; if one of the following is
          true:


          MQPBIPII=1 and MQPDEP= (Blank or 88)

          2.   MQPBIPII=1 and MQPMANIA= (Blank or 88) and MQPDEP=3

          MQPBIPII = Blank.  The atypical bipolar disorder variable
          was coded a &quot;Blank&quot; if the sample person was not eligible to
          receive the depression/mania questions.


     MQPFDBII, MQPLDBII:  Age of first and last manic symptoms
               associated with atypical bipolar disorder

          The two variables MQPFDBII and MQPLDBII report the age of
          the respondent the first and last time, respectively, he/she
          experienced depressive symptoms if he/she ever met criteria
          for any atypical bipolar disorder diagnosis (2 &lt;= MQPBIPII&lt;= 3).
          MQPFDBII uses age at first depressive symptoms (MQPFDDP) and
          MQPLDBII uses age at last depressive symptoms (MQPLDDP).

     

                MEC ADULT QUESTIONNAIRE (Except DIS)


     The MEC Adult Questionnaire was administered to all examinees aged 17
     years and older in the mobile examination center (MEC).  Conducted by
     a trained interviewer in a private room to ensure confidentiality, the
     automated questionnaire included sections on drug, alcohol, and
     tobacco use, sexual experience, women's reproductive history, and
     mental health.  Because this questionnaire was administered in the
     examination center, the MEC examination sample weight (WTPFEX6) should
     be used for data analysis.  For more information on the use of sample
     weights in NHANES III data analysis, refer to the NHANES III Analytic
     and Reporting Guidelines (U.S. DHHS, 1996b).

     Several portions of the MEC Adult Questionnaire were asked of
     examinees within specific age groups, and others were specific to one
     gender.  For example, the cognitive-function section was administered
     to examinees 60 years and older, and the birth control-use section was
     administered only to women.  Age and sex check items that were part
     of the questionnaire have been retained in the documentation and can
     be used to determine these subsets.  One portion of the questionnaire
     (Section G), the Diagnostic Interview Schedule, was edited and
     documented separately (see Diagnostic Interview Schedule).

     A modified MEC Adult Questionnaire was administered to adults 20 years
     and older during the interview portion of the Home Examination.  It
     included sections on tobacco use, cognitive function, selected medical
     conditions, reproductive health, and medicine, vitamin, and mineral
     usage.  Questions from the two interviews can be combined for
     analysis; however, the analyst should be aware of slight differences
     between the questionnaires.  For example, the reproductive health
     section of the interview administered in the Home Examination was
     shorter, and skip patterns were not identical to those in the MEC
     Adult Questionnaire.  For analyses of combined data from the MEC Adult
     and the Home Examination interviews, MEC+home examination weights
     (WTPFHX6) should be used (see Home Examination, Interview).

     Data processing and editing were performed for the consistency of
     responses within the sections of the questionnaire.  Notes have been
     provided both for standardized and recoded variables and for variables
     requiring additional explanation.  The notes reference the questions, by
     section and number, from the questionnaires which can be found in the
     Plan and Operation of the National Health and Nutrition Examination
          Survey, 1988-1994 (NCHS, 1994; U.S. DHHS, 1996b).

                           Now I'm going to read you a short        See note
                           story and when I'm through I'm going
                           to wait a few seconds and then ask
                           you to tell me as much as you can
                           remember.

                           The story is:  SLOWLY
                           Three children were alone at home and
                           the house caught on fire.  A brave
                           fireman managed to climb in a back
                           window and carry them to safety.

     NOTES


     MAPB1:  Age eligibility for cognitive function test

          This test of affective memory (Albert, 1991), given to MEC
          examinees 60 years and older, was also included as part of the
          interview in the Home Examination.


     MAPE3S:  Number of days drank alcohol in past year

          This variable was created from the two-part (quantity and unit)
          question E3 using the conversion factors 52 weeks/year and 12
          months/year.


     MAPE5S:  Number of days drank nine or more drinks of alcohol in
               past year

          This variable was created from the two-part (quantity and unit)
          question E5 using the conversion factors 52 weeks/year and 12
          months/year.


     MAPE6S:  Number of days drank five or more drinks of alcohol in
               past year

          This variable was created from the two-part (quantity and unit)
          question E6 using the conversion factors 52 weeks/year and 12
          months/year.



     MAPF7R:  Age at time of first live birth

          Question F7 (age at time of first live birth) was only asked of
          women who had more than one live birth.  To prevent redundant
          questions, women who had one live birth were only asked question
          F8, &quot;Age at the time of the last live birth.&quot;   This variable,
          MAPF7R, was created to include responses for women who had only
          one live birth and women who had multiple births.  For women who
          had only one live birth, their responses to question F8 were coded
          into MAPF7R.  For women who had multiple births, their responses
          to question F7 were coded into MAPF7R.


     MAPF12R:  Pregnancy status recode

          This variable combines responses from self-reported pregnancy
          status (F12) with the results of urine pregnancy test conducted
          in the mobile examination center on women 20-49 years of age.  If
          either the self-report or the test result was positive, then
          MAPF12R was coded yes.  Otherwise, if either the self-report or
          test result was negative, then MAPF12R was coded no.  If the
          self-report was don't know and the test result was either
          inconclusive or blank but applicable, then MAPF12R was coded don't
          know.  If the self-report was blank but applicable and the test
          result was inconclusive, then MAPF12R was also coded don't know.
          Finally, if both responses were blank but applicable, then MAPF12R
          was coded blank but applicable.


     MAPF18S:   Number of months received WIC benefits

          This variable was created from the two-part question (quantity
          and unit) F18 using the conversion factor 12 months/year.


     MAPF23:  Age at last period

          There were no comments or related responses that could be used to
          clarify the responses for reported ages of last period that
          appeared to be extreme.  Analysts should review responses when
          using this variable.


     MAPF32S:  Months since stopped taking birth control pills

          This variable was created from the two-part question (quantity and
          unit) F32 using the conversion factor 12/months per year.


     MAPF33S:  Total number of months took birth control pills

          This variable was derived from the two-part question (quantity
          and unit) F33 using the conversion factors 12 months/year.
          Analysts should note that the reported length of time on birth
          control pills may have exceeded the length of time that these
          products were available in the U.S.



     MAPF34R:  Birth control pill codes

          This variable was created to include a listing of all birth
          control pills that were specified in question F34.  It includes
          both birth control pills that had original codes from the chart
          that respondents were shown as well as those not included on the
          chart but specified by the respondent.  See the Appendix at the end
          of this section for code listing.


     MAPF34CS:  Number of months since NORPLANT was implanted

          This variable was derived from the two-part question (quantity
          and unit) F34C using the conversion factor 12 months/year.
          Analysts should be aware that the reported length of time
          NORPLANT was used may have exceeded the length of time that this
          product was available in the U.S.


     MAPF39S:  Number of months since stopped taking estrogen pills

          This variable was created from the two-part question (quantity
          and unit) F39 using the conversion factor 12 months/year.


     MAPF40:  Total years on estrogen pills

          Analysts should be aware that the reported length of time for
          estrogen pill use may have exceeded the length of time that these
          products were available in the U.S.


     MAPF43S:  Number of months since stopped using estrogen cream,
               suppository, or injection

          This variable was created from the two-part question (quantity
          and unit) F43 using the conversion factor 12 months/year.


     MAPF44:  Total years used estrogen cream, suppository, or
               injection

          Reported length of time for use of these estrogen products may
          have exceeded the length of time that they were available in the
          U.S.


     MAPF47S:  Number of months since stopped using hormone patches

          This variable was created from the two-part question (quantity
          and unit) F47 using the conversion factor 12 months/year.


     MAPF48:  Total years used female hormone patches

          Reported length of time for use of hormone patches may have
          exceeded the length of time that these products were available in
          the U.S.


     MAPF50:  Age at first sexual intercourse

          The question did not ask about first consensual sexual experience.
          Therefore, responses of first intercourse at very young ages were
          retained after reviewing comments made during the interview (e.g.,
          reports of rape or incest).

     MAPF51:  Number of sexual partners

          The value &quot;990&quot; represents reports of more than 990 sexual partners
          as well as responses such as &quot;too many to count.&quot;


     MAPF53:  Sex of sexual partners

          This question was about sexual experience; it was not designed to
          determine sexual preference.


     MAPF54R:  Number of partners that were female

          If the response to this question was that all partners were female,
          then this variable was recoded as the number of female partners
          reported in F51.


     MAPF57:  Ever had genital herpes

          In Phase 1, this question was asked, &quot;Have you ever had genital
          herpes?&quot;  In Phase 2, the question was changed to, &quot;Has a doctor
          ever told you that you had genital herpes?&quot;

                        BONE DENSITOMETRY


     Bone density of the proximal femur was measured on men and
     non-pregnant women aged 20 years and over by a trained examiner in the
     mobile examination center (MEC).  Using dual energy x-ray
     absorptiometry (DXA), areal bone density (bone mass per unit of
     area scanned) was measured in five areas of the proximal femur.
     These were the femoral neck, trochanter, intertrochanter, Ward's
     Triangle, and total region.

     Before the exam, screening questions were asked to determine
     medical safety exclusions.  Those excluded from testing were
     examinees:  who were females below age 60 for whom pregnancy test
     results were positive or uncertain or for whom there was a
     possibility of pregnancy; for whom both hips had been fractured
     or broken previously; or who had hip pins or artificial hips.

     Because these tests were administered in the mobile examination
     center, the MEC examination sample weight (WTPFEX6) should be used
     for data analysis.  For more information on the use of sample
     weights in NHANES III data analysis, refer to the NHANES III
     Analytic and Reporting Guidelines (U.S. DHHS, 1996b).

     A rigorous quality control program was used throughout the survey
     to ensure data quality.  Quality control (QC) of each individual DXA
     instrument was monitored by scanning anthropomorphic phantoms on a
     frequent basis (daily for spine phantom, weekly for hip phantom).
     Comparability of the three DXA instruments was assessed by circulating
     an additional spine phantom between mobile examination centers; this
     &quot;circulating spine phantom&quot; was scanned once per stand.  Every
     anthropomorphic phantom scan was reviewed individually at the Mayo
     Clinic, and results were plotted to compare with previous QC scan
     results.  All respondent scans also were reviewed individually at the
     Mayo Clinic before being added to the database.  For a detailed
     description of the QC program and the results for Phase 1 of NHANES III,

     NOTES


     BDPEXFLR:  Exclusion flag

          This flag variable indicates whether or not the examinee was
          ineligible to receive the bone densitometry procedure because of
          known or possible pregnancy or because both right and left hips had
          been fractured, pinned, or replaced with artificial hip joints in
          the past.


     BDPSCAN:  Scan technically acceptable after review at the Mayo
               Clinic

          See 1994 reference by Wahner for rejection criteria.


     BDPSIDE:  Hip side that was scanned

          The left hip was chosen as the default side for the bone density
          scan because it was easier to scan this side given the position of
          the DXA scanner in the bone density room.  If the left hip had been
          pinned or fractured previously or was artificial, the right hip was
          scanned.


     BDPWTARE, BDPWTBMC, BDPWTBMD:  Bone mineral area, content, and density
              of Ward's Triangle region

          Phases 1 and 2 data for Ward's Triangle are not directly comparable
          due to a change in the DXA software used to process the data.  In
          Phase 1, the location of Ward's Triangle was variable.  The
          computer algorithm actually searched a specific portion of the
          femur neck and intertrochanter (2.7 cm x 3.5 cm) for the lowest
          point of bone mass and then centered a fixed area box (10.5 mm x
          10.5 mm)around this point.  In Phase 2, however, the location was
          fixed.  The Ward's Triangle position was fixed at a mid-cervical
          location rather than being the point of lowest bone mineral
          density.  Thus, users should be careful in interpreting observed
          differences in Ward's Triangle data between Phases 1 and 2.  In
          addition, combining Ward's Triangle data from Phases 1 and 2 may
          not be appropriate.

                    HOME EXAMINATION, INTERVIEW


     The Home Examination interview was administered at the homes of
     examinees aged 2-11 months and those aged 20 years and older who
     were unable to travel to the mobile examination center (MEC). The
     interview included sections similar to those found in other MEC
     questionnaires:  infant food frequency, cognitive function, selected
     conditions/medicine, vitamin and mineral usage, tobacco use, and
     reproductive health.  Data from examinations conducted in the home
     (body measurements, physical function, spirometry, and venipuncture)
     have been included with the corresponding examination and laboratory
     data; therefore, they have not been included here.  Items from the MEC
     Adult Questionnaire and the Home Examination interview can be combined
     for analysis; however, there may be slight differences in the questions
     the way in which they are administered.  For example, the reproductive
     health section in the interview during the Home Examination was shorter,
     and the skip patterns were not the same.  For analysis of the Home
     Examination interview data alone or for combined MEC and Home
     Examination questionnaire data, the MEC+home Examination weights
     (WTPFHX6) should be used.  Separate sample weights were not created for
     the Home Examination.  For more information on the use of sample weights
     in NHANES III data analysis, refer to the NHANES III Analytic and
     Reporting Guidelines (U.S. DHHS, 1996b).

     The interview during the Home Examination was brief in comparison to
     those conducted in the MEC.  Like the MEC questionnaires, certain
     sections were asked only of specific age and gender groups.  For
     instance, reproductive health questions were asked only of females aged
     20 years and older.  Cognitive function questions were asked of
     examinees age 60 years and older.  Tobacco use was asked of examinees
     aged 20-60 years.  The infant food frequency was asked of a parent or
     other adult in the household member for each child aged 2-11 months.

     Data processing and editing were performed for the consistency of
     responses within the sections of the questionnaire.  Notes have been
     provided for variables that were standardized or recoded or those that
     require additional comments.

     NOTES


     HXPD1:  Age eligibility for cognitive function test

          This test of affective memory, given to examinees 60 years and
          older, was also included as part of the MEC Adult Questionnaire.


     HXPH7:  Age at last period

          There were no comments or related responses that could be
          used to clarify the response for reported ages of last
          periods that appeared to be extreme.  Analysts should review
          responses when using this variable.


     HXPH16S:  Number of days since stopped taking birth control pills

          This variable was created from the two-part question (quantity
          and unit) H16 using the conversion factors 7 days/week, 30.4
          days/month, and 365 days/year.


     HXPH17S:  Total number of months took birth control pills

          This variable was derived from the two-part question (quantity
          and unit) H17 using the conversion factor 12 months/year.
          Analysts should be aware that the reported length of time for the
          use of birth control pills may have exceeded the length of time
          that these products were available in the U.S.


     HXPH21S:  Number of months since stopped estrogen pills

          This variable was created from the two-part question (quantity
          and unit) H21 using the conversion factor 12 months/year.


     HXPH22:  Total years on estrogen pills

          Reported length of time for use of estrogen pills may have
          exceeded the length of time that these products were available in
          the U.S.

                           GALLBLADDER ULTRASONOGRAPHY


     Gallbladder examinations were conducted on all examinees aged 20 to 74
     years by a certified ultrasound technician in the mobile examination
     center (MEC).  The protocol for this component did not detail any
     medical, safety or other exclusions.

     When analyzing these data, the MEC examination sample weight
     should be used (WTPFEX6).  For more information on the use of
     sample weights in NHANES III data analysis, refer to the NHANES
     III Analytic and Reporting Guidelines (U.S. DHHS, 1996b).

     Gallbladder examinations were conducted to estimate the
     prevalence of gallstone disease in the United States.  Testing
     was done on examinees in both supine and left decubitus positions.
     The main element of the exam was real-time ultrasonography, a
     non-invasive technique for detecting gallstones.

     Although sample persons were asked to fast for at least six hours
     before the examination, non-fasting persons were not excluded
     from the examination.  The rate of acceptable exams did not differ by
     fasting status.

     Details of the data collection procedures and data collection forms for
     the Gallbladder Ultrasonography component are included in the
     Gallbladder Ultrasonography Procedures Manual (U.S. DHHS, 1996b) and the
     Plan and Operation of the Third National Health and Nutrition
     Examination Survey, 1988-94 (U.S. DHHS, 1996b).

     All certified ultrasound technicians received training in the
     physics of ultrasound, calibration of equipment, and technique of
     administering the abdominal ultrasound examination.  This training was
     conducted at the time of hire and at least annually thereafter by a
     radiologist and a physicist who were experts in ultrasonography.  All
     examinations were recorded on videotapes and mailed to consulting
     radiologists who specialized in abdominal ultrasonography.  No written
     comments or technician findings were disclosed to the radiologists to
     ensure an independent review of cases except for the &quot;rapid review&quot;
     cases (in which immediate evaluations were needed due to abnormal
     findings potentially requiring medical attention).

     A diagnosis of gallstones was made using the common criteria of
     echoes within the gallbladder with shadowing on two views.
     Diagnoses first were obtained by the ultrasound technician in the
     MEC and later were confirmed by a radiologist.  If a right upper
     quadrant or epigastric scar was observed and the gallbladder was
     not seen, it was concluded that a cholecystectomy had been
     performed previously.  Data for other abnormal pathologies
     observed in the surrounding areas, such as the liver or the right
     kidney, also were collected and recorded.  Persons in wheelchairs
     received the ultrasound examination while sitting.


     The radiologists' diagnoses in GUPR1DX1 and GUPR1DX2 were compared with
     the technicians' diagnoses in GUPTDX1R and GUPTDX2R.  If they agreed
     with each other, then these were used as the final diagnoses (GUPFDX1R
     and GUPFDX2R).  If the radiologist and the technician disagreed and the
     radiologist was not confident of the finding because of the poor quality
     of the video, then the technician's diagnosis was used as the final
     diagnosis. Also if the radiologist's diagnosis was missing, then the
     technician's diagnosis was used as the final diagnosis.  However, if the
     radiologist and the technician disagreed and the radiologist had
     reasonable confidence in his/her findings, then the video taped scan was
     given to a senior radiologist for adjudication, and that senior
     radiologist's diagnosis was used as the final diagnosis.  The level of
     agreement between the technician's diagnosis and the radiologist's
     diagnosis was measured by the Kappa statistic and was found to be
     excellent (Fleiss, 1981).

     Analysts should use both final primary and secondary diagnosis
     variables in analyses.  If gallstones were present (codes 3-5),
     it was indicated in the final, primary diagnosis (GUPFDX1R).

     Data processing and editing were performed to ensure internal
     data consistency.  Notes have been provided for variables
     requiring additional explanation.

     Supplemental information was collected during the household
     interview.  Section J of the Household Adult Questionnaire
     included questions on self-reported history of abdominal pain,
     previous diagnosis of gallstones, gallbladder surgery, and
     medical treatment to dissolve or remove gallstones.  A question
     on newer methods to dissolve gallstones or remove the gallbladder
     was added in Phase 2 of the survey.  This information can be found in
     the Household Adult Data File.

    NOTES


     GUPFDX1R, GUPFDX2R:  Final primary and secondary diagnoses

          The radiologist's diagnoses were compared with the
          technician's diagnoses to determine agreement and to select
          cases for adjudication.  The final primary and secondary
          diagnoses were a result of this adjudication.  Most
          examined persons had only a single diagnosis, and the code
          for that diagnosis was placed in GUPFDX1R.  For those
          persons with two diagnoses, the lowest numbered code was
          placed in GUPFDX1R, and the other code was placed in
          GUPFDX2R.  However, analysts should check both variables for
          specific codes of interest.


     GUPGBPSZ:  Size of the largest polyp

          GUPGBPSZ indicates the size of the largest polyp if a polyp
          was found during the technician's examination or after the
          radiologist's review (code 13 in either GUPFDX1R or
          GUPFDX2R).


     GUPLCSTR, GUPLCSZE:  Flag for liver cyst and the size of the
               largest cyst

          During the examination, the technician scanned the area
          surrounding the gallbladder for other abnormal pathologies.
          Liver abnormality is identified in the variable GUPQ38R.
          GUPLCSTR indicates the presence of one or more cysts in the
          liver.  GUPLCSZE indicates the size of the largest cyst.


     GUPLHMGR, GUPCHSZE:  Flag for cavernous hemangioma of liver and
               size of the largest lesion

          During the examination, the technician scanned the area
          surrounding the gallbladder for other abnormal pathologies.
          Liver abnormality is identified in the variable GUPQ38R.
          The presence of one or more hemangiomas of the liver is
          recorded in the variable GUPLHMGR.  The size of the largest
          lesion is recorded in the variable GUPCHSZE.


     GUPQ18:  Thickness of gallbladder wall

          The gallbladder for a person in a non-fasting state may be
          contracted and appear to have a thickened wall.  In such cases, the
          gallbladder wall thickness may be greater than 3 mm and, according
          to the computerized recording of results, would have been recorded
          as code 14, &quot;Abnormal GB -- Diffuse W.T., With NO Calcification&quot;
          although the gallbladder appeared to be normal to technicians and
          radiologists.  For those persons in a non-fasting status with a
          contracted gallbladder, the final adjudicated diagnosis was edited
          and appropriately coded to indicate a normal gallbladder.



     GUPQ24R:  Measurement of largest echo -- clump (mm)

          This variable provides measurement of the largest gallstone
          (codes 3 and 4 in GUPFDX1R or GUPFDX2R).


     GUPQ37R:  Other non-gallbladder findings -- renal

          This variable is a recode of the response to question Q37.


     GUPQ38R:  Other non-gallbladder findings -- hepatic or liver

          This variable is a recode of the response to question Q38.


     GUPQ8A1-GUPQ8A6:  Flag for abdominal scar and its location

          To identify the location of a scar in GUPQ8A1-GUPQ8A6, refer to the
          upper body illustration (p. 394) of the Plan and Operation of the
          Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1988-94
          (NCHS, 1994; U.S. DHHS, 1996b).


     GUPR1CNF, GUPR1QLT:  Radiologist's confidence in diagnoses and
               assessment of quality of the videotape (first reading)

          Three levels were used on the quality control form to record the
          radiologist's confidence in the diagnoses and assessment of the
          videotape quality.  If for either variable, level 3 was marked,
          diagnoses from the corresponding readings were not used in
          computing the final, adjudicated primary and secondary diagnoses.


     GUPR1DX1, GUPR1DX2:  Radiologists' first reading

          All videotaped scans were mailed to a radiologist for
          evaluation, which was recorded on a quality control form.
          After reviewing the scanned cases, the radiologist marked a
          maximum of two diagnoses on the quality control form and
          then evaluated the quality of the tapes, confidence in the
          diagnosis, and sometimes provided an optional, written
          comment explaining the diagnosis.  Most examined persons had
          only a single diagnosis, and their code was placed in
          GUPR1DX1.  For those persons with two diagnoses, the lowest
          numbered code was placed in GUPR1DX1, and the other code was
          placed in GUPPR1DX2.  However, analysts should check both
          variables for specific codes of interest.



     GUPR1ID, GUPR2ID:  Radiologists' identification numbers

          These are identification numbers for the radiologists
          reviewing the videotapes.  A total of four radiologists
          reviewed the videotapes under professional services
          contracts.  After the first reading, all cases with
          significant disagreements between the technician's diagnosis
          and the radiologist's diagnosis were reevaluated by the
          senior radiologist (radiologist number 4).


     GUPRCSTR, GUPRCSZE:  Flag for renal cyst and the size of the
               largest cyst

          During the examination, the technician scanned the area
          surrounding the gallbladder for other abnormal pathologies.
          Right kidney abnormality is identified in the variable
          GUPQ37R.  The presence of one or more cysts in the kidney is
          identified in the variable GUPRCSTR.  GUPRCSZE indicates the
          size of the largest cyst.


     GUPTDX1R, GUPTDX2R:  Technician's primary and secondary diagnoses

          Most examined persons had only a single diagnosis, and the
          code was placed in GUPTDX1R.  For those persons with two
          diagnoses, the lowest numbered code was placed in GUPTDX1R,
          and the other code was placed in GUPTDX2R.  However,
          analysts should check both variables for specific codes of
          interest.
     


              CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM FUNCTION EVALUATION


     Computerized neurobehavioral testing was administered to a random
     half-sample of examinees aged 20-59 years by a trained examiner in a
     soundproof room in the mobile examination center (MEC).  A screening
     questionnaire was administered to assess factors that might have
     affected test performance.  There were no medical or safety exclusions
     for this component.

     Because this examination was administered on a selected subsample in
     the examination center, the central nervous system (CNS) sample weight
     (WTPFCNS6) should be used for data analysis.  For more information on
     the use of sample weights in NHANES III data analysis, refer to the
     NHANES III Analytic and Reporting Guidelines (U.S. DHHS, 1996b).

     Three computerized tests were used to evaluate central nervous system
     function.  They were:  (1) a simple reaction time test (SRTT), a basic
     measure of motor response speed to a visual stimulus; (2) a symbol-digit
     substitution test (SDST), a test of coding ability; and (3) a
     serial-digit learning test (SDLT), a short-term memory test.  These
     tests are components of the Neurobehavioral Evaluation System 2 (NES2)
     developed by Baker and Letz (1985; Letz, 1990).  NES2 is a system of
     computerized tests designed to assess neurobehavioral function in
     epidemiological studies of populations with occupational or
     environmental exposure to chemicals.

     The tests were administered on a Compaq 286 DeskPro(TM) personal
     computer (12.5 MHz, 80286 CPU chip) configured with 640K RAM, one
     1.2MB floppy disk drive, one parallel port, two serial ports, a
     standard game joystick controller board, and an Ethernet interface
     board.  The system used the standard, detachable keyboard with a
     custom-made wooden keyboard overlay that left only the top row of
     digit keys exposed to prevent inadvertent contact with keys not needed
     in the testing; it also used a standard, monochrome (green) Compaq
     monitor.  In September 1991, between the conclusion of Phase 1 and the
     initiation of Phase 2 data collection, the monitors were replaced with
     comparable, new amber monitors due to a deterioration in display
     performance.  A push-button, computer-game joystick (NES2 Joystick by
     Neurobehavioral Systems, Inc., Winchester, MA) was used to record the
     SRTT responses.

     The tests were administered by health technicians, MEC interviewers, and
     translators who were trained to perform the testing.  Before
     examinations began, special training sessions were held at NCHS or at
     the offices of the contractor responsible for survey operations.
     Training sessions also occurred at MEC sites during the survey, and
     retraining was done approximately twice per year.  The test was
     conducted in English or Spanish, and examinees who could not speak
     English or Spanish were not tested.  English or Spanish language
     instructions appeared on the computer screen for each test, and the
     examiner also gave the instructions verbally.


     Translators were trained to administer the testing independently or
     with a health technician.  The training was conducted in the MEC by a
     Spanish-speaking health technician, Spanish-speaking NCHS staff
     member, or Spanish-speaking MEC interviewer trained to administer the
     CNS test.  Training for translators included reviewing the manual with
     the trainer, performing the tests as an examinee, and administering
     the examination in Spanish.

     Physical comfort may have affected examinees' test results.  The air
     conditioning in the soundproof room used for testing sometimes failed
     to maintain an optimally comfortable room temperature.  Because of
     this, room temperature (CNPTEMP) was recorded for use as a covariate;
     however, this practice did not begin until the second year of the
     survey.  The location of the thermometer within the room and the time
     that temperature was recorded were not consistent throughout the
     survey.  For instance, some examiners entered the temperature at the
     beginning of the testing session, and others recorded it at the end of
     the session.  This source of error is likely to be small.

     Initially, some trials of the SRTT were performed with both the
     non-preferred hand and the preferred hand.  Early in the survey, the
     procedure was changed to perform all trials only with the preferred
     hand.  As a result, analysts may want to exclude SRTT data from those
     examinees who used both hands for the test.  The affected data have a
     value of &quot;2  Non-preferred hand used on trials 31-50&quot; for the variable
     CNPNBPH (LOG:  Number of trials with preferred hand).

     During Phase 2 of the survey, reading glasses were available for
     examinees who forgot to bring their own reading glasses to the MEC.
     Examinees could select from four pairs of glasses of different
     diopters or magnifying powers (+1.0 diopter, +1.5 diopters, +2.0
     diopters, and +2.5 diopters).

     Although all examiners were well-trained in standardized procedures
     for these tests, performance on neurobehavioral tests may have been
     subject to an examiner effect.  This would have been particularly
     likely when the examiner encouraged the examinee during the exam, as
     was the case in NHANES III.  Therefore, analysts should consider using
     the examiner number (CNPTECH) as a covariate in analyses of data from
     these tests.

     For details of the examination protocol, see the Neurobehavioral
     Testing Procedures Manual (U.S. DHHS, 1996b).

     Data processing and editing were performed to ensure internal data
     consistency.  Notes have been provided for variables requiring
     additional explanation.

     NOTES


     CNP1LAT1-CNP1LAT9, CNP2LAT1-CNP2LAT9, CNP3LAT1-CNP3LAT9,
     CNP4LAT1-CNP4LAT9:  Latencies for trials 1-4

          A total of five trials were conducted in the Symbol Digit
          Substitution Test (SDST), a practice trial (not included in these
          data) and four actual trials (trials 1-4).  The practice trial was
          primarily for training the examinee in the test procedure.  It did
          not accept incorrect responses, and data from the practice trial
          are not included in this file.  If the examinee entered an
          incorrect digit, a short beep sounded, and no digit was entered on
          the screen; to proceed, a correct digit had to be entered.  If the
          examinee made more than four errors during the practice trial, the
          trial was repeated.  If the examinee made more than four errors on
          the second attempt of the practice trial, the test was
          discontinued, and the next test was initiated automatically.
          Symbols and digits were paired differently on each trial.  Although
          incorrect responses were allowed on the four actual trials, more
          than four errors resulted in a message emphasizing the need to
          avoid errors.

          These variables represent the latency to enter each of the nine
          digits of each trial.  Incorrect responses were reported as
          negative values.


     CNP1SCOR-CNP8SCOR: Serial Digit Learning Test (SDLT) score

          Note that to allow comparison with NES2 results from other
          settings the scoring convention for this variable differs from
          that usually applied to the NHANES III data, where 0 indicates
          none or never.  Examinees received a score of 0 if all eight
          digits were entered correctly, 1 if six or seven digits were
          entered correctly, and 2 if fewer than six digits were entered
          correctly.


     CNP1TOTL, CNP2TOTL, CNP3TOTL, CNP4TOTL:  Total latency, trials 1-4

          CNP1TOTL represents the time elapsed on trial 1 from the time
          the first item was answered to the time the ninth item was
          answered.  Therefore, it does not include the latency to respond to
          the first symbol.

     CNPCBEST:  Mean of two lowest error-corrected latencies

          This single summary measure for the SDST is the mean of the
          error-corrected latencies (CNPCLAT1-CNPCLAT4) on the two best
          (lowest latency) of the four trials.  The units for this summary
          measure are &quot;sec/correct digit.&quot;


     CNPCLAT1, CNPCLAT2, CNPCLAT3, CNPCLAT4:  Error-corrected latency for
                    trials 1-4

          The error-corrected latency was calculated for each of the four
          actual trials.  It is the mean number of seconds per correct
          digit for each trial, excluding the first item in the trial.

          If the number of correct responses for latencies 2 through 9 was
          0, CNPCLAT1 was set to missing (blank).  Otherwise,
          CNPCLAT1=CNP1TOTL/CNPCORR1.


     CNPCLAT2:  Error-corrected latency for trial 2

          See note for CNPCLAT1.

          See note for CNPCLAT1.


     CNPCLAT4:  Error-corrected latency for trial 4

          See note for CNPCLAT1.


     CNPMENRT:  Mean reaction time

          To calculate the mean reaction time, values from the first ten
          trials (CNPRT01-CNPRT10) were excluded as well as values from other
          trials that were greater than or equal to 750 msec or less than or
          equal to 50 msec.  This mean may not be valid if the number of trials
          included in the average was less than 20.


     CNPSDRT:  Standard deviation of the reaction time

          To calculate the standard deviation of the reaction time, values
          from the first ten trials (CNPRT01-CNPRT10) were excluded as well
          as values from other trials that were greater than or equal to 750
          msec or less than or equal to 50 msec.  This statistic may not be
          valid if the number of trials included in the calculation was less
          than 20.


     FUNDUS PHOTOGRAPHY


     A photograph of the ocular fundus of one eye was taken on examinees aged
     40 years and over by a trained examiner in the mobile examination center
     (MEC).  The protocol for this component did not detail any medical,
     safety or other exclusions.  However, if the designated eye was
     unavailable due to an extremely small pupil, severe corneal or lens
     opacity, complete retinal detachment, or other reason, the other eye was
     photographed.  If both eyes were unavailable, no photograph was taken.

     Because the component was administered in the examination center, MEC
     examination weights (WTPFEX6) should be used for data analysis.  For
     more information on the use of sample weights in the analysis of
     NHANES III data, refer to the NHANES III Analytic and Reporting
     Guidelines (U.S. DHHS, 1996b).

     Photographs of the ocular fundus were taken to determine the presence
     of diabetic retinopathy, age-related maculopathy, and other retinal
     diseases that are the leading causes of vision loss in the United
     States.  A non-stereoscopic, color, 45-degree photograph, centered
     between the optic nerve and the macula, was taken of one randomly
     selected eye.  The camera used was a Canon CR4-45NM &quot;non-mydriatic&quot;
     fundus camera, which incorporated the use of an infrared video camera
     to allow photographs to be taken in a darkened examination room
     without the use of dilating drops.

     In a darkened room, the sphincter muscle of the iris normally relaxes,
     allowing for dilation of the pupil, usually to 6-10 mm in diameter.
     The technician observed the eye's natural dilation on a special video
     monitor and took the color photograph with a single flash of white
     light.  If the examinee wore a contact lens, the photograph was taken
     directly through the contact lens.  The entire procedure usually took
     less than six minutes.  Detailed information on the examination
     procedure is in the Fundus Photography chapter of the Health
     Technician's Manual (U.S. DHHS, 1996b).

     The exposed film was mailed to the University of Wisconsin-Madison,
     Department of Ophthalmology, where it was processed by a local
     laboratory into transparencies that were evaluated for photographic
     quality.

     The ocular fundus images on the final transparencies were reviewed by
     photograph graders to assess the presence of diabetic retinopathy,
     age-related maculopathy, and other retinal diseases.  The grading
     system used for classifying diabetic retinopathy was based on a
     modification of the Airlie House Classification Scheme (Diabetic
     Retinopathy Study Group, 1981; Klein, 1984; Klein, 1986; The Early
     Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study Group, 1991).

     The Modified Airlie House Classification of Diabetic Retinopathy slide
     standards consist of 27 stereo pairs of color fundus photographs of
     diabetic retinopathy and one slide depicting poor photographic quality.
     The standard slides show diabetic proliferative disease and are used for
     grading the severity of diabetic retinopathy.  The set is available with
     a detailed chapter outlining its use and a sample grading form.
     Additional information is available from The Fundus Photograph Reading
     Center, c/o Michael Neider, WARF Building Room 450, 610 Walnut Street,
     Madison, WI  53705.

     The fundus photography consultant provided extensive training to
     technicians at their time of hire, and each technician's performance
     was monitored in the field on a periodic basis.

     Two sources of nonsampling or measurement error were monitored
     throughout the survey, the picture taking procedure and the image
     grading procedure.  To ensure that adequate photographs were taken,
     the technicians' performance was monitored by a review of photographs
     at the University of Wisconsin and by review and retraining field
     visits.  To evaluate the grading procedure, 1500 transparencies were
     chosen at random for use in assessing inter- and intra-grader
     reliability.  The Kappa statistic was chosen to assess agreement
     (Fleiss, 1981).  The measures of agreement were generally good to
     excellent and improved across time.

     Data processing and editing were performed to ensure internal data
     consistency.  Notes have been provided for variables requiring
     additional explanation.

     FPP1020:  Fundus

          When the fundus was absent (FPP1020=00), the grader was
          instructed to stop.  All ensuing fields, FPP1030 through FPP1270,
          were then left blank by the grader.  During data processing, the
          blank fields were recoded &quot;88  Blank but applicable.&quot;


     FPP1060:  Gradability status

          Not all photographs were gradable.  The principal reasons were
          related to the camera (e.g., malfunction, poor focus, dirty lens)
          and to the examinee (e.g., cataracts, eye movement, corneal
          change, poor pupil dilation, lens implants).  The grader was
          instructed to stop when the entire field was ungradable
          (FPP1060=06), at which point the remaining fields were left
          blank.  During data processing, the blank fields were recoded &quot;88
          Blank but applicable.&quot;


     FPP1070:  Diabetic retinopathy level

          This variable represents the current state of severity of retinopathy
          in the eye.  As such, it differs from the summary diabetic retinopathy
          score (FPPSURET) which represents the combination of current and past
          retinopathy status.


     FPP1230-FPP1266:  Drusen details

          Drusen vary in appearance, merging at one end of the spectrum
          with the normal fundus background and at the other end with
          diffuse degeneration of the retinal pigment epithelium.  Typical
          small drusen usually appear as individual, round, flat spots in
          the plane of the retinal pigment epithelium.  They may be pale
          yellowish-white, contrasting sharply with the surrounding retinal
          pigment epithelium, or only slightly more pale than the retinal
          pigment epithelium and easily overlooked, even with careful
          examination of well-focused photographs.  Larger drusen typically
          are yellow-white in color and often have visible thickness.  Some
          have sharp margins and a solid, nodular appearance, whereas
          others have indistinct margins and a softer, more liquid
          appearance.  Drusen may be distributed as individual spots or may
          appear to merge with adjacent drusen.

          In NHANES III, two characteristics of drusen type (hard or soft)
          and area were graded in a semi-quantitative fashion within and
          outside the grid.  Small punctate drusen (usually less than 95
          microns in diameter) were classified as hard drusen; larger
          drusen were classified as soft.  No attempt was made to further
          characterize soft drusen by appearance as soft distinct or
          indistinct.

          Drusen area was estimated within a central circle of the grid,
          within the grid, and outside the grid.  The area covered by
          drusen was estimated by mentally moving together all hard or soft
          drusen as if they were confluent and comparing this area with
          those of standard circles.  The estimate of drusen area was
          classified into one of four categories:  smaller than a circle
          with a diameter of 95 microns (comparable to the 63-micron
          diameter circle used in a 30-degree field), smaller than a circle
          with a diameter of 375 microns (250-micron diameter in a
          30-degree field), smaller than a circle with a diameter of 960
          microns (640-micron diameter in a 30-degree field), or equal to
          or larger than a circle with a diameter of 960 microns.


     FPPPHOTO:  Photographic status

          Fundus photographs were not taken on all examinees who came to
          the mobile examination center.  The principal reasons were
          refusal to cooperate, equipment failure, physical inability, and
          insufficient time.


     FPPSUDRU:  Summary drusen score

          The summary drusen score was derived from a combination of values
          from several variables.

          Definite drusen present:  FPP1230, hard drusen, and/or FPP1240,
          soft drusen, were coded &quot;02  Yes.&quot;

          Questionable drusen present:  Definite drusen were not present,
          and FPP1230, hard drusen, and/or FPP1240, soft drusen, were/was
          coded &quot;01  Questionable.&quot;

          No drusen present:  Neither definite nor questionable drusen was
          present, and FPP1230, hard drusen, and/or FPP1240, soft drusen,
          were/was coded &quot;00  None.&quot;

          Cannot grade drusen:  FPP1230, hard drusen, and FPP1240, soft
          drusen, were both coded &quot;08  Can't grade.&quot;

          Blank but applicable:  FPP1060, gradability, was coded &quot;06
          Entire field ungradable,&quot; or FPP1020, fundus, was coded &quot;00
          Absent&quot; or &quot;88  Blank but applicable.&quot;


     FPPSUMAC:  Summary age-related maculopathy score

          The summary age-related maculopathy score was derived from a
          combination of values from several variables.  A detailed
          description of lesions as defined by the Wisconsin Age-Related
          Maculopathy Grading System is available (Klein, 1991; NTIS,
          1991).

          Late age-related maculopathy:  At least one of the following
          variables was coded &quot;02  Yes.&quot;

             FPP1174, geographic atrophy
             FPP1176, sub-retinal hemorrhage
             FPP1178, sub-retinal fibrous scar
             FPP1180, sensory serous (sub-retinal) detachment

          Early age-related maculopathy:  At least one of the following
          three sets of conditions was met.

             FPP1172, degeneration of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE),
             was coded &quot;02  Yes,&quot; and (FPP1230, hard drusen, and/or
             FPP1240, soft drusen, were/was coded &quot;02  Yes&quot;).

             FPP1182, hyperpigmentation, was coded &quot;02 Yes,&quot; and
             (FPP1230, hard drusen, and/or FPP1240, soft drusen, were/was
             coded &quot;02 Yes&quot;).

             FPP1240, soft drusen, was coded &quot;02  Yes,&quot; and FPP1250, grid
             area, was coded 02-04 (equal to or greater than a circle 95
             microns in diameter).

          No age-related maculopathy:  Early and late age-related
          maculopathy definitions were not met, and FPP1240, soft drusen,
          was coded 00-02 (gradable).

          &quot;Cannot grade&quot; age-related maculopathy:  Early and late
          age-related maculopathy definitions were not met, and FPP1240,
          soft drusen, was coded &quot;08  Can't grade.&quot;

          Blank but applicable:  FPP1060, gradability, was coded &quot;06
          Entire field ungradable,&quot; or FPP1020, fundus, was coded &quot;00
          Absent&quot; or &quot;88  Blank but applicable.&quot;


     FPPSURET:  Summary diabetic retinopathy score

          The summary diabetic retinopathy score was derived from a
          combination of values from several variables.  That is, it
          combines the diabetic retinopathy level variable (FPP1070) and
          history of treatment for proliferative diabetic retinopathy
          (using the photocoagulation treatment outside the arcades
          variable (FPP1214) as a marker).  A detailed description of
          lesions as defined by The Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy
          Study (ETDRS) is available in the ETDRS report #10 (The Early
          Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study, 1991).  The NHANES III
          fundus photo grading protocol (NTIS, 1995) describes methods of
          assigning diabetic levels.

          Proliferative diabetic retinopathy:  At least one of the
          following two sets of conditions was met.

             FPP1070, diabetic retinopathy level, was coded 060-070.

             FPP1070, diabetic retinopathy level, has a code of anything
             other than &quot;012  Non-diabetic retinopathy,&quot; and FPP1214,
             photocoagulation treatment outside arcades, was coded &quot;02
             Yes.&quot;

          Moderate/severe non-proliferative retinopathy:  FPP1070, diabetic
          retinopathy level, was coded &quot;041  Moderate non-proliferative&quot; or
          &quot;051  Severe non-proliferative.&quot;

          Mild non-proliferative retinopathy:  FPP1070, diabetic
          retinopathy level, was coded &quot;020  Microaneurysms only&quot; or &quot;031
          Early non-proliferative.&quot;

          No diabetic retinopathy:  FPP1070, diabetic retinopathy level,
          was coded 010-015.

          &quot;Cannot grade&quot; diabetic retinopathy:  FPP1070, diabetic
          retinopathy level, was coded &quot;088  Can't grade.&quot;

          Blank but applicable:  FPP1060, gradability, was coded &quot;06
          Entire field ungradable,&quot; or FPP1020, fundus, was coded &quot;00
          Absent&quot; or &quot;88  Blank but applicable.&quot;

     

     PHYSICAL FUNCTION EVALUATION


     Physical function (PF) was evaluated on examinees aged 60 years and over
     by a trained examiner using a battery of physical performance measures
     in the mobile examination center (MEC) and at examinees'homes.  The
     protocol for this component did not detail any medical, safety or other
     exclusions.

     To determine which sample persons were home examinees, the DMPSTAT
     variable (3=home-examined) should be used.  When analyzing data for
     combined home-examined and MEC-examined persons, the combined MEC- plus
     home-examined sample weight should be used (WTPFHX6).  When using only
     MEC items or measures, the MEC examination sample weight should be used
     (WTPFEX6).  For more information on the use of sample weights in
     NHANES III data analysis, refer to the NHANES III Analytic and
     Reporting Guidelines (U.S. DHHS, 1996b).

     Physical function was tested using certain movements that represent
     musculoskeletal activities needed to carry out daily activities.
     Gross shoulder joint movement, fine motor hand movement, lower
     extremity motor functions, and integrated movement of balance and gait
     were determined.  Upper extremity functions were evaluated using Jette
     and Branch (1984) right and left shoulder, external and internal
     rotations (PFPRSER, PFPLSER, PFPRSIR, and PFPLSIR).  The fine motor
     function examination was a modification of a manual ability examination
     in which a key was inserted into a lock and then was turned (PFPTKEY)
     (Williams, 1982).  The lower extremity motor, balance, and gait
     evaluation items included time to get up from an armless chair five
     times (PFPTSTND), a full tandem stand with the heel of one foot directly
     in front of the toes of the other foot for a maximum time of 10 seconds
     (PFPTTAND), and left and right knee flexing (PFPLFLEX and PFPRFLEX).  An
     eight-foot walk performed twice at the usual walking speed (PFPTWLKA,
     PFPTWLKB, PFPNSTPA, and PFPNSTPB) was used also (Jette, 1985; Tinetti,
     1986; Nevitt, 1989).

     Items were scored by measuring the time required to perform the
     maneuver (lock and key, chair rising, tandem stand, eight-foot walk),
     by using scoring rules (shoulder rotation, knee flexing), and by
     counting steps (eight-foot walk).

     Examinees who were unable to perform a specific maneuver either because
     they felt that it would have been unsafe or because they knew they were
     unable to do it for reasons related to physical limitations or health
     conditions were not required to make an attempt.  For example, if an
     examinee was in a wheelchair and was not able to stand up, he/she
     skipped the following maneuvers:  time to complete five chair stands
     (PFPTSTND), right and left knee-hip flexion (PFPRFLEX and PFPLFLEX), and
     tandem stand (PFPTTAND).  The examinee was then asked, &quot;Are you able to
     walk alone without holding on to another person?  You may use a cane or
     walker.&quot;  If he/she answered affirmatively, the examinee did the
     measured walking (PFPTWLKA, PFPTWLKB, PFPNSTPA, and PFPNSTPB);
     otherwise, he/she skipped the measured walking and ended the test.  In
     the data set, examinees unable to complete the maneuver for these
     reasons were coded as &quot;Blank,&quot; whereas examinees who did not perform the
     test for reasons unrelated to physical limitations were coded as &quot;8
     Blank but applicable.&quot;

     Persons aged 60 and over who refused or were unable to come to the
     mobile examination center (MEC) were tested in their homes.  Persons
     found to be bedbound were excluded from the lower extremities part of
     the PF evaluation (HXPBED).  Aside from using an accessible, armless
     chair in the examinees' homes (HXPCHIR), technicians used equipment and
     procedures comparable to those used in the MEC.

     Because technicians used equipment and procedures in examinees' homes
     that were comparable to those used in the MEC, the home PF values were
     incorporated into the MEC PF measures data set.

     Refer to the Physical Function Examination Manual (U.S. DHHS, 1996b)
     and the Home Examination Manual (U.S. DHHS, 1996b) for descriptions of
     data collection procedures and methods.

     At the time of hire, MEC and home examination health technicians were
     trained to conduct the physical function evaluation.  During annual site
     visits, examination administration was observed, and re-training took
     place.  Applicable parts of the National Institute on Aging video
     &quot;Assessing Physical Performance in the Home-Part 1&quot; were used to
     demonstrate the PF procedures during initial training and re-training
     (NIA, 1988).

     Data processing and editing were performed to ensure internal data
     consistency.  Notes have been provided for variables requiring
     additional explanation.

     NOTES


     PFPTKEY:  Time to unlock lock (sec)

          If the examinee was not able to open the lock within 60 seconds,
          the maneuver was terminated, and his/her time was entered as 60
          seconds.


     PFPTSTND and PFPUSTND:  Time to complete five stands (sec) and ability
                to stand

          A standardized wooden cube, 50-cm in height, was used as a prop
          for the armless chair maneuvers in the MEC.


     PFPTTAND:  Time tandem stand held (sec)

          The examiner stopped timing after 10 seconds even if the examinee
          was able to maintain the tandem stand for a longer period of time,
          and the examinee's time was entered as 10 seconds.


     PFPUKEY:  Ability to pick up key

          The examinee had a maximum of 30 seconds to pick up the key.  If
          the examinee was not able to pick up the key within 30 seconds, the
          maneuver was terminated, and the examinee proceeded to the next
          item (PFPWC).


     PFPUPWC:  Can you get up from your chair/wheelchair by yourself?

          This question was asked during the MEC and home exam; PFPWC was
          recorded by the technician from observation in the MEC only.


     PFPUSTND:  Ability to stand

          See note for PFPTSTND.
