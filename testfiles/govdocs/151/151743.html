are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic

"When discontinuing Effexor after more than 1 week of therapy, it is generally recommended that the dose be tapered to minimize the risk of discontinuation symptoms.

New second paragraph - <P>
"Discontinuation symptoms have been systematically evaluated in patients taking venlafaxine, to include prospective analyses of clinical trials in Generalized Anxiety Disorder and retrospective surveys of trials in depression. Abrupt discontinuation or dose reduction of venlafaxine at various doses has been found to be associated with the appearance of new symptoms, the frequency of which increased with increased dose level and with longer duration of treatment. Reported symptoms include agitation, anorexia, anxiety, confusion, coordination impaired, diarrhea, dizziness, dry mouth, dysphoric mood, fasciculation, fatigue, headaches, hypomania, insomnia, nausea, nervousness, nightmares, sensory disturbances (including shock-like electrical sensations), somnolence, sweating, tremor, vertigo, and vomiting. It is therefore recommended that the dosage of Effexor be tapered gradually and the patient monitored. The period required for tapering may depend on the dose, duration of therapy and the individual patient. Discontinuation effects are well known to occur with antidepressants." <P>
<B>Discontinuing Effexor XR:</B> <P>
"When discontinuing Effexor XR after more than 1 week of therapy, it is generally recommended that the dose be tapered to minimize the risk of discontinuation symptoms. In clinical trials with Effexor XR, tapering was achieved by reducing the daily dose by 75 mg at one week intervals. Individualization of tapering may be necessary.

The National Institutes of Health presently recommends that the preparation of injectable anti-neoplastic drugs should be performed in a Class II laminar flow biological safety cabinet. ["...and that personnel preparing drugs of this class should wear surgical gloves and a closed front surgical-type gown with knit cuffs." Deleted] <I> Personnel preparing drugs of this class should wear chemical resistant, impervious gloves, safety goggles, outer garments and shoe covers. Additional body garments should be based upon the task being performed (e.g., sleevelets, apron, gauntlets, disposable suits) to avoid exposed skin surfaces and inhalation of vapors and dust. Appropriate techniques should be used to remove potentially contaminated clothing.</I> Several other guidelines for proper handling and disposal of anti-cancer drugs have been published and should be considered.

Drug Resistance:</B> Subsection revised (new text in italics) - <P>
"Resistance of<I> HSV and</I> VZV to antiviral nucleoside analogues can result from qualitative or quantitative changes in the viral TK or DNA polymerase.

"["Resistance of HSV to antiviral nucleoside analogues occurs by the same mechanisms as resistance to VZV." Deleted] While most of the acyclovir-resistant mutants isolated thus far from immunocompromised patients have found to be TK-deficient mutants, other mutants involving the viral TK gene (TK partial and TK altered) and DNA polymerase have ["also" deleted] been isolated.
