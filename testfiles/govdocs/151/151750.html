<hr><div align="center"><embed src="../midi/unfortunate.mid" Autostart=TRUE Width=144 Height=56 Loop=true TYPE="audio/midi"></embed>
<h5>from Disney's
&quot;The Little Mermaid</h5>
 
 </div>

 

<h5>Music: Alan Menken<BR>
Lyrics: Howard Ashman<BR>
Performed by: Pat Carroll [Ursula], Jodi Benson [Ariel]</h5>
  

Poor unfortunate souls,<BR>
In pain, in need!<BR>
This one longing to be thinner,<BR>
That one wants to get the girl,<BR>
And do I help them?<BR>
Yes, indeed!<BR>
Those poor unfortunate souls.<BR>
So sad, so true.<BR>
They come flocking to my cauldron<BR>
Crying, &quot;Spells, Ursula, please!&quot;<BR>
And I help them!<BR>
Yes I do!<br><br>

(the verse above is the only one included on the midi, 
but the complete song/words from the movie are also provided below)<br><br>

[Ursula:] The only way to get what you want is to become a human yourself.<BR>
[Ariel:]  Can you do that?<BR>
[Ursula:] My dear, sweet child. That's what I do - it's what I live for. To<BR>
          help unfortunate merfolk - like yourself - poor souls with no one <BR>
          else to turn to. <BR>
		  I admit that in the past I've been a nasty<BR>
They weren't kidding when they called me, well, a witch<BR>
But you'll find that nowadays<BR>
I've mended all my ways<BR>
Repented, seen the light and made a switch<BR>
True? Yes<BR>
And I fortunately know a little magic<BR>
It's a talent that I always have possessed<BR>
And here lately, please don't laugh<BR>
I use it on behalf<BR>
Of the miserable, lonely and depressed<BR>
Poor unfortunate souls<BR>
In pain, In need<BR>
This one longing to be thinner<BR>
That one wants to get the girl<BR>
And do I help them?<BR>
Yes, indeed<BR><BR>

Those poor unfortunate souls<BR>
So sad<BR>
So true<BR>
They come flocking to my cauldron<BR>
Crying, &quot;Spells, Ursula please!&quot;<BR>
And I help them?<BR>
Yes, I do<BR>
Now it's happened once or twice<BR>
Someone couldn't pay the price<BR>
And I'm afraid I had to rake 'em 'cross the coals<BR>
Yes, I've had the odd complaint<BR>
But on the whole I've been a saint<BR>
To those poor unfortunate souls<BR><BR>
[Ursula:] Have we got a deal?<BR>
[Ariel:]  If I become human, I'll never be with my father or sisters again.<BR>
[Ursula:] But you'll have your man. Life's full of tough choices, innit?<BR>
          Oh - and there is one more thing. We haven't discussed the <BR>
          subject of payment.<BR>
[Ariel:]  But I don't have any -<BR>
[Ursula:] I'm not asking much. Just a token, really, a trifle. What I want<BR>
          from you is...your voice.<BR>
[Ariel:]  But without my voice, how can I -<BR>
[Ursula:] You'll have your looks! Your pretty face! And don't underestimate<BR>
          the importance of body language! Ha! <BR><BR>
		  The men up there don't like a lot of blabber<BR>
They think a girl who gossips is a bore<BR>
Yes, on land it's much preferred<BR>
For ladies not to say a word<BR>
And after all, dear, what is idle prattle for?<BR>
Come on, they're not all that impressed with conversation<BR>
True gentlemen avoid it when they can<BR>
But they dote and swoon and fawn<BR>
On a lady who's withdrawn<BR>
It's she who holds her tongue who gets her man<BR>
Come on, you poor unfortunate soul<BR>
Go ahead!<BR>
Make your choice!<BR>
I'm a very busy woman<BR>
And I haven't got all day<BR>
It won't cost much<BR>
Just your voice!<BR>
You poor unfortunate soul<BR>
It's sad<BR>
But true<BR>
If you want to cross a bridge, my sweet<BR>
You've got to pay the toll<BR>
Take a gulp and take a breath<BR>
And go ahead and sign the scroll!<BR>
Flotsam, Jetsam, now I've got her, boys<BR>
The boss is on a roll<BR>
This poor unfortunate soul.<br><br>
 
&quot;Beluga....Sevruga....Come Winds of the Caspian Sea!&quot;<BR>
&quot;Now rings us glossitis and maxlarnygitis La Voce to me!&quot;<BR>
&quot; Now Sing...&quot;<BR>
