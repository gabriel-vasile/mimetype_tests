<p><strong> Ob-Gyns Encouraged to Help Reduce Colorectal Cancer Deaths in Women </strong></p>
<p> Washington , DC -- In recognition of Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month, ob-gyns
are encouraged to remind all of their patients age 50 and older to be screened
for colorectal cancer. Because ob-gyns are the only physicians many women see
on a regular basis, they can help increase colorectal cancer screening rates
and, thereby, help reduce deaths from one of the most preventable and treatable
types of cancer. </p>
<p> &quot;Despite the promising decline in colorectal cancer deaths in the US,
many women are still not getting screened for colorectal cancer,&quot; says Douglas
W. Laube, MD, MEd, president of The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists
(ACOG). &quot;Ob-gyns can really help by making sure that all eligible patients
leave their office with screening recommendations. ACOG encourages its members
to educate women about the importance of routine colorectal cancer screening.&quot; </p>
<p> Colon and rectal cancer (colorectal cancer) affects the large intestine and
rectum. It is the third leading cause of cancer death among women in the US and
the second leading cause of cancer deaths overall for all adults. In most cases,
colorectal cancer develops slowly over time. It often begins as a tissue growth,
called a polyp, in the colon or rectum. Routine screening helps detect these
polyps so that they can be removed before they turn into cancer. In many cases,
colorectal cancer has no symptoms. The following symptoms, however, may indicate
colorectal cancer: a change in bowel habits, bleeding from the rectum, blood
in the stool, stools that are more narrow than usual, abdominal discomfort (bloating,
cramps, or frequent gas pains), loss of appetite, and weakness and feeling tired. </p>
<p> ACOG recommends that all women age 50 and older be screened for colorectal
cancer by one of the following methods: </p>
<ul>
<li> Annual patient-collected fecal occult blood test (FOBT) or fecal immunochemical
test (FIT) </li>
<li> Flexible sigmoidoscopy once every five years </li>
<li> Annual patient-collected FOBT or FIT plus a flexible sigmoidoscopy once
every five years </li>
<li> Double-contrast barium enema once every five years </li>
<li> Colonoscopy once every 10 years </li>
</ul>
<p> Some women may need to be screened for colorectal cancer before age 50 if
they: </p>
<ul>
<li> Have a first-degree relative younger than age 60 with colorectal cancer
or colon polyps </li>
<li> Have two or more first-degree relatives of any age with colorectal cancer
or colon polyps </li>
<li> Have had colorectal cancer </li>
<li> Have had colon polyps </li>
<li> Have had inflammatory bowel disease (IBS), chronic ulcerative colitis, or
Crohn's disease </li>
<li> Have a family history of familial adenomatosis polyposis or hereditary nonpolyposis
colon cancer </li>
</ul>
<p> In early 2006, the National Colorectal Cancer Roundtable, of which ACOG is
a member, published an evidence-based guide, How to Increase Colorectal Cancer
Screening Rates in Practice. It is available free to physicians at </p>
<p><a href="http://www.nccrt.org/documents/general/increasecolorectalcancerscreeningrates.pdf">www.nccrt.org/documents/general/increasecolorectalcancerscreeningrates.pdf</a></p>
<p> The guide offers current screening guidelines and features checklists, chart
prompts, tracking sheets, and other tools that physicians can use in their practice. </p>

<p><strong> Medical Futility - Committee Opinion </strong></p>
<p> ABSTRACT: The construct of medical futility has been used to justify a physician&rsquo;s
unilateral refusal to provide treatment requested or demanded by a patient or
the family of a patient. It is important that physicians and their institutions
develop a process for dealing with conflict surrounding the construct of medical
futility. Prospective policies on medical futility are preferable to unilateral
decision making by individual physicians. When there is disagreement, patient
and family values regarding treatment options and the default position of maintaining
life ordinarily should take priority . </p>

<p><strong> Treatment of the Common Cold </strong><strong> (see Patient Education)</strong><strong></strong></p>
<p> The common cold is a viral illness that affects persons of all ages, prompting
frequent use of over-the-counter and prescription medications and alternative
remedies. Treatment focuses on relieving symptoms (e.g., cough, nasal congestion,
rhinorrhea). Dextromethorphan may be beneficial in adults with cough, but its
effectiveness has not been demonstrated in children and adolescents. Codeine
has not been shown to effectively treat cough caused by the common cold. Although
hydrocodone is widely used and has been shown to effectively treat cough caused
by other conditions, the drug has not been studied in patients with colds. Topical
(intranasal) and oral nasal decongestants have been shown to relieve nasal symptoms
and can be used in adolescents and adults for up to three days. Antihistamines
and combination antihistamine/decongestant therapies can modestly improve symptoms
in adults; however, the benefits must be weighed against potential side effects.
Newer nonsedating antihistamines are ineffective against cough. Topical ipratropium,
a prescription anticholinergic, relieves nasal symptoms in older children and
adults. Antibiotics have not been shown to improve symptoms or shorten illness
duration. Complementary and alternative therapies (i.e., Echinacea, vitamin C,
and zinc) are not recommended for treating common cold symptoms; however, humidified
air and fluid intake may be useful without adverse side effects. Vitamin C prophylaxis
may modestly reduce the duration and severity of the common cold in the general
population and may reduce the incidence of the illness in persons exposed to
physical and environmental stresses. Am Fam Physician 2007;75:515-20, 522 <a href="http://www.aafp.org/afp/20070215/515.html">http://www.aafp.org/afp/20070215/515.html</a></p>
<p><strong> Cough: Diagnosis and Management: Practice Guidelines </strong></p>
<p> On a typical day, a family physician will see at least one patient presenting
with cough. Cough can be divided into three categories: acute (i.e., lasting
less than three weeks), subacute (i.e., lasting three to eight weeks), and chronic
(i.e., lasting longer than eight weeks). </p>

<p><strong> Common Oral Lesions: Part I. Superficial Mucosal Lesions (see Patient
Education) </strong></p>
<p> Common superficial oral lesions include candidiasis, recurrent herpes labialis,
recurrent aphthous stomatitis, erythema migrans, hairy tongue, and lichen planus.
Recognition and diagnosis require taking a thorough history and performing a
complete oral examination. Knowledge of clinical characteristics such as size,
location, surface morphology, color, pain, and duration is helpful in establishing
a diagnosis. Oral candidiasis may present as pseudomembranous candidiasis, glossitis,
or perl&egrave;che (angular cheilitis). Oral candidiasis is common in infants,
but in adults it may signify immune deficiency or other illness. Herpes labialis
typically is a mild, self-limited condition. Recurrent aphthous stomatitis most
often is a mild condition; however, severe cases may be caused by nutritional
deficiencies, autoimmune disorders, or human immunodeficiency virus infection.
Erythema migrans is a waxing and waning disorder of unknown etiology. Hairy tongue
represents elongation and hypertrophy of the filiform papillae and most often
occurs in persons who smoke heavily. Oral lichen planus is a chronic inflammatory
condition that may be reticular or erosive. Certain risk factors have been associated
with each of these lesions, such as poor oral hygiene, age, tobacco use, and
alcohol consumption, and some systemic conditions may have oral manifestations.
Many recommended therapies for oral lesions are unsupported by randomized controlled
trials. Am Fam Physician 2007;75:501-7. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.aafp.org/afp/20070215/501.html">http://www.aafp.org/afp/20070215/501.html</a></p>
<p><strong> Common Oral Lesions: Part II. Masses and Neoplasia </strong></p>
<p> Certain common oral lesions appear as masses, prompting concern about oral
carcinoma. Many are benign, although some (e.g., leukoplakia) may represent neoplasia
or cancer. Palatal and mandibular tori are bony protuberances and are benign
anomalies. Oral pyogenic granulomas may appear in response to local irritation,
trauma, or hormonal changes of pregnancy. Mucoceles represent mucin spillage
into the oral soft tissues resulting from rupture of a salivary gland duct. Oral
fibromas form as a result of irritation or masticatory trauma, especially along
the buccal occlusal line. Oral cancer may appear clinically as a subtle mucosal
change or as an obvious mass. Oral leukoplakia is the most common premalignant
oral lesion. For persistent white or erythematous oral lesions, biopsy should
be performed to rule out neoplastic change or cancer. Most oral cancers are squamous
cell carcinomas. Tobacco and heavy alcohol use are the principal risk factors
for oral cancer. Family physicians should be able to recognize these lesions
and make appropriate referrals for biopsy and treatment. Am Fam Physician 2007;75:509-12. </p>

<p><strong> Iron Deficiency Anemia </strong><strong> (see Patient Education)</strong><strong></strong></p>
<p> The prevalence of iron deficiency anemia is 2 percent in adult men, 9 to
12 percent in non-Hispanic white women, and nearly 20 percent in black and Mexican-American
women. Nine percent of patients older than 65 years with iron deficiency anemia
have a gastrointestinal cancer when evaluated. The U.S. Preventive Services Task
Force currently recommends screening for iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women
but not in other groups. Routine iron supplementation is recommended for high-risk
infants six to 12 months of age. Iron deficiency anemia is classically described
as a microcytic anemia. The differential diagnosis includes thalassemia, sideroblastic
anemias, some types of anemia of chronic disease, and lead poisoning. Serum ferritin
is the preferred initial diagnostic test. Total iron-binding capacity, transferrin
saturation, serum iron, and serum transferrin receptor levels may be helpful
if the ferritin level is between 46 and 99 ng per mL (46 and 99 mcg per L); bone
marrow biopsy may be necessary in these patients for a definitive diagnosis.
In children, adolescents, and women of reproductive age, a trial of iron is a
reasonable approach if the review of symptoms, history, and physical examination
are negative; however, the hemoglobin should be checked at one month. If there
is not a 1 to 2 g per dL (10 to 20 g per L) increase in the hemoglobin level
in that time, possibilities include malabsorption of oral iron, continued bleeding,
or unknown lesion. For other patients, an endoscopic evaluation is recommended
beginning with colonoscopy if the patient is older than 50. Am Fam Physician
2007;75:671-8 <a href="http://www.aafp.org/afp/20070301/671.html">http://www.aafp.org/afp/20070301/671.html</a></p>
<p><strong> Treatment Options for Atopic Dermatitis (see Patient Education) </strong></p>
<p> Atopic dermatitis is a common inflammatory skin condition that usually affects
children. It is a chronic disease, with periods of remission and flare-ups, that
adversely affects the quality of life of patients and their families. Aggressive
therapy with emollients is an important intervention for patients with atopic
dermatitis. Patients should avoid individual disease triggers and allergens.
Topical corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment for flare-ups and are the
standard to which other treatments are compared. Topical calcineurin inhibitors
should not be used in patients younger than two years or in those who are immunosuppressed,
and should be second-line therapies in other patients. Rarely, systemic agents
(e.g., cyclosporine, interferon gamma-1b, oral corticosteroids) may be considered
in adults. Am Fam Physician 2007;75:523-8, 530. </p>

<p><strong> Pelvic Inflammatory Disease: The CDC website should be bookmarked </strong></p>
<p> The CDC website is a great resource. </p>
<p> Take a little time to remind yourself about the signs, symptoms, and current
alternatives for the management of Pelvic Inflammatory Disease, below. Please
note the many alternative oral regimens due to drug resistant strains.</p>
<p> PID comprises a spectrum of inflammatory disorders of the upper female genital
tract, including any combination of endometritis, salpingitis, tubo-ovarian abscess,
and pelvic peritonitis. Sexually transmitted organisms, especially N. gonorrhoeae
and C. trachomatis, are implicated in many cases; however, microorganisms that
comprise the vaginal flora (e.g., anaerobes, G. vaginalis, Haemophilus influenzae,
enteric Gram-negative rods, and Streptococcus agalactiae) also have been associated
with PID. In addition, cytomegalovirus (CMV), M. hominis, U. urealyticum, and
M. genitalium might be associated with some cases of PID. All women who are diagnosed
with acute PID should be tested for N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis and should
be screened for HIV infection.</p>
<p><strong> Diagnostic Considerations </strong></p>
<p> Acute PID is difficult to diagnose because of the wide variation in the symptoms
and signs. Many women with PID have subtle or mild symptoms. Delay in diagnosis
and treatment probably contributes to inflammatory sequelae in the upper reproductive
tract. Laparoscopy can be used to obtain a more accurate diagnosis of salpingitis
and a more complete bacteriologic diagnosis. However, this diagnostic tool frequently
is not readily available, and its use is not easy to justify when symptoms are
mild or vague. Moreover, laparoscopy will not detect endometritis and might not
detect subtle inflammation of the fallopian tubes. Consequently, a diagnosis
of PID usually is based on clinical findings.</p>
<p> The clinical diagnosis of acute PID is imprecise. Data indicate that a clinical
diagnosis of symptomatic PID has a positive predictive value (PPV) for salpingitis
of 65%--90% compared with laparoscopy. The PPV of a clinical diagnosis of acute
PID depends on the epidemiologic characteristics of the population, with higher
PPVs among sexually active young women (particularly adolescents), among patients
attending STD clinics, or in other settings where the rates of gonorrhea or chlamydia
are high. In all settings, however, no single historical, physical, or laboratory
finding is both sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of acute PID (i.e.,
can be used both to detect all cases of PID and to exclude all women without
PID). Combinations of diagnostic findings that improve either sensitivity (i.e.,
detect more women who have PID) or specificity (i.e., exclude more women who
do not have PID) do so only at the expense of the other. For example, requiring
two or more findings excludes more women who do not have PID but also reduces
the number of women with PID who are identified.</p>
<p> Many episodes of PID go unrecognized. Although some cases are asymptomatic,
others are not diagnosed because the patient or the health-care provider fails
to recognize the implications of mild or nonspecific symptoms or signs (e.g.,
abnormal bleeding, dyspareunia, and vaginal discharge). Because of the difficulty
of diagnosis and the potential for damage to the reproductive health of women,
even by apparently mild or subclinical PID, health-care providers should maintain
a low threshold for the diagnosis of PID.</p>
<p> The optimal treatment regimen and long-term outcome of early treatment of
women with asymptomatic or subclinical PID are unknown. The following recommendations
for diagnosing PID are intended to help health-care providers recognize when
PID should be suspected and when they need to obtain additional information to
increase diagnostic certainty. Diagnosis and management of other common causes
of lower abdominal pain (e.g., ectopic pregnancy, acute appendicitis, and functional
pain) are unlikely to be impaired by initiating empiric antimicrobial therapy
for PID.</p>
<p> Empiric treatment of PID should be initiated in sexually active young women
and other women at risk for STDs if they are experiencing pelvic or lower abdominal
pain, if no cause for the illness other than PID can be identified, and if one
or more of the following minimum criteria are present on pelvic examination: </p>
<ul>
<li> cervical motion tenderness OR uterine tenderness OR adnexal tenderness. </li>
</ul>
<p> The requirement that all three minimum criteria be present before the initiation
of empiric treatment could result in insufficient sensitivity for the diagnosis
of PID. The presence of signs of lower genital tract inflammation, in addition
to one of the three minimum criteria, increases the specificity of diagnosis.
In deciding upon the initiation of empiric treatment, clinicians should also
consider the risk profile of the patient for STDs.</p>
<p> More elaborate diagnostic evaluation frequently is needed because incorrect
diagnosis and management might cause unnecessary morbidity. These additional
criteria may be used to enhance the specificity of the minimum criteria. The
following additional criteria can be used to enhance the specificity of the minimum
criteria and support a diagnosis of PID: </p>
<ul>
<li> oral temperature &gt;101&deg;F (&gt;38.3&deg;C), </li>
<li> abnormal cervical or vaginal mucopurulent discharge, </li>
<li> presence of abundant numbers of WBC on saline microscopy of vaginal secretions, </li>
<li> elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, </li>
<li> elevated C-reactive protein, and </li>
<li> laboratory documentation of cervical infection with N. gonorrhoeae or C.
trachomatis. </li>
</ul>
<p> The majority of women with PID have either mucopurulent cervical discharge
or evidence of WBC on a microscopic evaluation of a saline preparation of vaginal
fluid. If the cervical discharge appears normal and no WBCs are observed on the
wet prep of vaginal fluid, the diagnosis of PID is unlikely, and alternative
causes of pain should be investigated. A wet prep of vaginal fluid offers the
ability to detect the presence of concomitant infections (e.g., bacterial vaginosis
and trichomoniasis). </p>
<p> The most specific criteria for diagnosing PID include the following: </p>
<ul>
<li> endometrial biopsy with histopathologic evidence of endometritis; </li>
<li> transvaginal sonography or magnetic resonance imaging techniques showing
thickened, fluid-filled tubes with or without free pelvic fluid or tubo-ovarian
complex, or doppler studies suggesting pelvic infection (e.g., tubal hyperemia);
and </li>
<li> laparoscopic abnormalities consistent with PID. </li>
</ul>
<p> A diagnostic evaluation that includes some of these more extensive studies
might be warranted in some cases. Endometrial biopsy is warranted in women undergoing
laparoscopy who do not have visual evidence of salpingitis, as some women with
PID have endometritis alone.</p>
<p><strong> Treatment </strong></p>
<p> PID treatment regimens must provide empiric, broad spectrum coverage of likely
pathogens. Several antimicrobial regimens have been effective in achieving clinical
and microbiologic cure in randomized clinical trials with short-term follow-up.
However, only a limited number of investigations have assessed and compared these
regimens with regard to elimination of infection in the endometrium and fallopian
tubes or determined the incidence of long-term complications (e.g., tubal infertility
and ectopic pregnancy) after antimicrobial regimens.</p>
<p> All treatment regimens should be effective against N. gonorrhoeae and C.
trachomatis because negative endocervical screening for these organisms does
not rule out upper reproductive tract infection. The need to eradicate anaerobes
from women who have PID has not been determined definitively. Anaerobic bacteria
have been isolated from the upper reproductive tract of women who have PID, and
data from in vitro studies have revealed that some anaerobes (e.g., Bacteroides
fragilis) can cause tubal and epithelial destruction. In addition, BV also is
present in many women who have PID. Until treatment regimens that do not adequately
cover these microbes have been demonstrated to prevent long-term sequelae (e.g.,
infertility and ectopic pregnancy) as successfully as the regimens that are effective
against these microbes, the use of regimens with anaerobic activity should be
considered. Treatment should be initiated as soon as the presumptive diagnosis
has been made because prevention of long-term sequelae is dependent on immediate
administration of appropriate antibiotics. When selecting a treatment regimen,
health-care providers should consider availability, cost, patient acceptance,
and antimicrobial susceptibility.</p>
<p> Some specialists have recommended that all patients with PID be hospitalized
so that bed rest and supervised treatment with parenteral antibiotics can be
initiated. However, in women with PID of mild or moderate clinical severity,
outpatient therapy can provide short- and long-term clinical outcomes similar
to inpatient therapy. Limited data support the use of outpatient therapy in women
with more severe clinical presentations. The decision of whether hospitalization
is necessary should be based on the discretion of the health-care provider. </p>
<p> The following criteria for hospitalization are suggested: </p>
<ul>
<li> surgical emergencies (e.g., appendicitis) cannot be excluded; </li>
<li> the patient is pregnant; </li>
<li> the patient does not respond clinically to oral antimicrobial therapy; </li>
<li> the patient is unable to follow or tolerate an outpatient oral regimen; </li>
<li> the patient has severe illness, nausea and vomiting, or high fever; and </li>
<li> the patient has a tubo-ovarian abscess.</li>
</ul>
<p> Many practitioners have preferred to hospitalize adolescent women whose condition
is diagnosed as acute PID. No evidence is available suggesting that adolescents
benefit from hospitalization for treatment of PID. Younger women with mild-to-moderate
acute PID have similar outcomes with either outpatient therapy or inpatient therapy.
Further, clinical response to outpatient treatment is similar among younger and
older women. The decision to hospitalize adolescents with acute PID should be
based on the same criteria used for older women. Whether women in their later
reproductive years benefit from hospitalization for treatment of PID also is
unclear, although women aged &gt;35 years who are hospitalized with PID are more
likely than younger women to have a complicated clinical course.</p>
<p><strong> Parenteral Treatment </strong></p>
<p> For women with PID of mild or moderate severity, parenteral and oral therapy
appears to have similar clinical efficacy. Many randomized trials have demonstrated
the efficacy of both parenteral and oral regimens. In the majority of clinical
trials, parenteral treatment for at least 48 hours has been used after the patient
has demonstrated substantial clinical improvement. Clinical experience should
guide decisions regarding transition to oral therapy, which usually can be initiated
within 24 hours of clinical improvement. The majority of clinicians recommend
at least 24 hours of direct inpatient observation for patients who have tubo-ovarian
abscesses.</p>

<p> Because of the pain associated with infusion, doxycycline should be administered
orally when possible, even when the patient is hospitalized. Oral and IV administration
of doxycycline provide similar bioavailability. </p>
<p> Parenteral therapy may be discontinued 24 hours after a patient improves
clinically, and oral therapy with doxycycline (100 mg twice a day) should continue
to complete 14 days of therapy. When tubo-ovarian abscess is present, many health-care
providers use clindamycin or metronidazole with doxycycline for continued therapy,
rather than doxycycline alone, because it provides more effective anaerobic coverage. </p>
<p> Clinical data are limited regarding the use of other second- or third-generation
cephalosporins (e.g., ceftizoxime, cefotaxime, and ceftriaxone), which also might
be effective therapy for PID and may replace cefotetan or cefoxitin. However,
these cephalosporins are less active than cefotetan or cefoxitin against anaerobic
bacteria.</p>
<p align="center"><strong> Recommmended Parenteral Regimen B</strong><br>
Clindamycin 900 mg IV every 8 hours <br>
PLUS <br>
Gentamicin loading dose IV or IM (2 mg/kg of body weight), followed by a maintenance
dose (1.5 mg/kg) every 8 hours. Single daily dosing may be substituted.</p>
<p> Although use of a single daily dose of gentamicin has not been evaluated
for the treatment of PID, it is efficacious in analogous situations. Parenteral
therapy can be discontinued 24 hours after a patient improves clinically; continuing
oral therapy should consist of doxycycline 100 mg orally twice a day or clindamycin
450 mg orally four times a day to complete a total of 14 days of therapy. When
tubo-ovarian abscess is present, many health-care providers use clindamycin for
continued therapy, rather than doxycycline, because clindamycin provides more
effective anaerobic coverage.</p>
<h4> Alternative Parenteral Regimens </h4>
<p> Limited data support the use of other parenteral regimens, but the following
three regimens have been investigated in at least one clinical trial, and they
have broad spectrum coverage.</p>
<p align="center"> Levofloxacin 500 mg IV once daily* <br>
WITH OR WITHOUT <br>
Metronidazole 500 mg IV every 8 hours <br>
OR <br>
Ofloxacin 400 mg IV every 12 hours* <br>
WITH OR WITHOUT<br>
Metronidazole 500 mg IV every 8 hours <br>
OR <br>
Ampicillin/Sulbactam 3 g IV every 6 hours <br>
PLUS <br>
Doxycycline 100 mg orally or IV every 12 hours</p>
<p> * Quinolones should not be used in persons with a history of recent foreign
travel or partners' travel, infections acquired in California or Hawaii, or infections
acquired in other areas with increased QRNG prevalence.</p>
<p> IV ofloxacin has been investigated as a single agent; however, because of
concerns regarding its spectum, metronidazole may be included in the regimen.
Levofloxacin is as effective as ofloxacin and may be substituted; its single
daily dosing makes it advantageous from a compliance perspective. One trial demonstrated
high short-term clinical cure rates with azithromycin, either alone for 1 week
(at least one IV dose followed by oral therapy) or with a 12-day course of metronidazole.
Ampicillin/sulbactam plus doxycycline is effective coverage against C. trachomatis,
N. gonorrhoeae, and anaerobes and for patients who have tubo-ovarian abscess.</p>
<p><strong> Oral Treatment </strong></p>
<p> Oral therapy can be considered for women with mild-to-moderately severe acute
PID, as the clinical outcomes among women treated with oral therapy are similar
to those treated with parenteral therapy. The following regimens provide coverage
against the frequent etiologic agents of PID. Patients who do not respond to
oral therapy within 72 hours should be reevaluated to confirm the diagnosis and
should be administered parenteral therapy on either an outpatient or inpatient
basis. </p>
<p align="center"><strong> Recommended Regimen A</strong><br>
Levofloxacin 500 mg orally once daily for 14 days* <br>
OR <br>
Ofloxacin 400 mg orally twice daily for 14 days* <br>
WITH OR WITHOUT <br>
Metronidazole 500 mg orally twice a day for 14 days</p>
<p> * Quinolones should not be used in persons with a history of recent foreign
travel or partners' travel, infections acquired in California or Hawaii, or infections
acquired in other areas with increased QRNG prevalence. </p>
<p> Oral ofloxacin has been investigated as a single agent in two clinical trials,
and it is effective against both N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis. Despite the
results of these trials, lack of anaerobic coverage with ofloxacin is a concern;
the addition of metronidazole to the treatment regimen provides this coverage.
Levofloxacin is as effective as ofloxacin and may be substituted. Azithromycin
has been demonstrated in one randomized trial to be an effective regimen for
acute PID. The addition of metronidazole should be considered, as anaerobic organisms
are suspected in the etiology of the majority of PID cases. Metronidazole will
also treat BV, which frequently is associated with PID.</p>
<p align="center"><strong> Regimen B</strong><br>
Ceftriaxone 250 mg IM in a single dose <br>
PLUS <br>
Doxycycline 100 mg orally twice a day for 14 days <br>
WITH or WITHOUT <br>
Metronidazole 500 mg orally twice a day for 14 days <br>
OR <br>
Cefoxitin 2 g IM in a single dose and Probenecid, 1 g orally administered concurrently
in a single dose <br>
PLUS <br>
Doxycycline 100 mg orally twice a day for 14 days <br>
WITH or WITHOUT <br>
Metronidazole 500 mg orally twice a day for 14 days <br>
OR&nbsp; <br>
Other parenteral third-generation cephalosporin <br>
(e.g., ceftizoxime or cefotaxime) <br>
PLUS <br>
Doxycycline 100 mg orally twice a day for 14 days <br>
WITH or WITHOUT <br>
Metronidazole 500 mg orally twice a day for 14 days</p>
<p> The optimal choice of a cephalosporin for Regimen B is unclear; although
cefoxitin has better anaerobic coverage, ceftriaxone has better coverage against
N. gonorrhoeae. Clinical trials have demonstrated that a single dose of cefoxitin
is effective in obtaining short-term clinical response in women who have PID.
However, the theoretical limitations in cefoxitin's coverage of anaerobes might
require the addition of metronidazole to the treatment regimen. Metronidazole
also will effectively treat BV, which is frequently associated with PID. No data
have been published regarding the use of oral cephalosporins for the treatment
of PID. Limited data suggest that the combination of oral metronidazole and doxycycline
after primary parenteral therapy is safe and effective.</p>
<p><strong> Alternative Oral Regimens </strong></p>
<p> Although information regarding other outpatient regimens is limited, one
other regimen has undergone at least one clinical trial and has broad spectrum
coverage. Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and doxycycline was effective in obtaining
short-term clinical response in a single clinical trial; however, gastrointestinal
symptoms might limit compliance with this regimen. </p>
<p> Follow-Up </p>
<p> Patients should demonstrate substantial clinical improvement (e.g., defervescence;
reduction in direct or rebound abdominal tenderness; and reduction in uterine,
adnexal, and cervical motion tenderness) within 3 days after initiation of therapy.
Patients who do not improve within this period usually require hospitalization,
additional diagnostic tests, and surgical intervention. </p>
<p> If no clinical improvement has occurred within 72 hours after outpatient
oral or parenteral therapy (using the criteria for clinical improvement described
previously), an examination should be performed. Subsequent hospitalization,
parenteral therapy, and diagnostic evaluation, including the consideration of
diagnostic laparoscopy for alternative diagnoses, are recommended in women without
clinical improvement. Some specialists also recommend rescreening for C. trachomatis
and N. gonorrhoeae 4--6 weeks after therapy is completed in women with documented
infection with these pathogens. All women diagnosed with acute PID should be
offered HIV testing.</p>
<p><strong> Management of Sex Partners </strong></p>
<p> Male sex partners of women with PID should be examined and treated if they
had sexual contact with the patient during the 60 days preceding the patient's
onset of symptoms. Evaluation and treatment are imperative because of the risk
for reinfection of the patient and the strong likelihood of urethral gonococcal
or chlamydial infection in the sex partner. Male partners of women who have PID
caused by C. trachomatis and/or N. gonorrhoeae frequently are asymptomatic. </p>
<p> Sex partners should be treated empirically with regimens effective against
both of these infections, regardless of the etiology of PID or pathogens isolated
from the infected woman. Even in clinical settings in which only women are treated,
arrangements should be made to provide care for male sex partners of women who
have PID. When providing care for male sex partners is not feasible, health-care
providers should ensure that sex partners are referred for appropriate treatment.</p>
<p><strong> Prevention </strong></p>
<p> Prevention of chlamydial infection by screening and treating high-risk women
reduces the incidence of PID. Theoretically, the majority of cases of PID can
be prevented by screening all women or those determined to be at high risk (based
on age or other factors) by using DNA amplification on cervical specimens (in
women receiving pelvic examinations) and on urine specimens (in women not undergoing
examinations). Although BV is associated with PID, whether the incidence of PID
can be reduced by identifying and treating women with BV is unclear.</p>
<p><strong> Special Considerations </strong></p>
<p> Pregnancy. Because of the high risk for maternal morbidity and preterm delivery,
pregnant women who have suspected PID should be hospitalized and treated with
parenteral antibiotics. </p>
<p> HIV Infection. Differences in the clinical manifestations of PID between
HIV-infected women and HIV-negative women have not been well-delineated. In previous
observational studies, HIV-infected women with PID were more likely to require
surgical intervention. More comprehensive observational and controlled studies
(published since the 2002 STD Treatment Guidelines) have demonstrated that HIV-infected
women with PID had similar symptoms when compared with uninfected controls. They
were more likely to have a tubo-ovarian abscess but responded equally well to
standard parenteral and oral antibiotic regimens when compared with HIV-negative
women. The microbiologic findings for HIV- positive and HIV-negative women were
similar, except HIV-infected women had higher rates of concomitant M. hominis,
candida, streptococcal, and HPV infections and HPV-related cytologic abnormalities.
Whether the management of immunodeficient HIV-infected women with PID requires
more aggressive interventions (e.g., hospitalization or parenteral antimicrobial
regimens) has not been determined.</p>
<p> IUD. Intrauterine contraceptive devices are becoming a popular contraceptive
choice for women. Both levonorgestrel- and copper-containing devices are marketed
in the United States. The risk of PID associated with IUD use is primarily confined
to the first 3 weeks after insertion and is uncommon thereafter. Given the popularity
of IUDs, practitioners might encounter PID in IUD users. No evidence suggests
that IUDs should be removed in women diagnosed with acute PID. However, caution
should be exercised if the IUD remains in place, and close clinical follow-up
is mandatory. The rate of treatment failure and recurrent PID in women continuing
to use an IUD is unknown. No data exist on antibiotic selection and treatment
outcomes according to type of IUD (e.g., copper or levonorgestrel). </p>

<p><strong> Inquiring families want to know - what about breastfeeding and&hellip;&hellip; </strong></p>
<p><strong> -Is it okay if the mom smokes or chews tobacco and breastfeeds? </strong></p>
<p> According to American Academy of Pediatrics, the risk benefit of breastfeeding
outweighs the potential risk of tobacco metabolites in the mother&rsquo;s milk.
The greater concern is that the baby not be exposed to second hand smoke.</p>
<p><strong> -Can a mom still breastfeed if she has pierced nipples? </strong></p>
<p> La Leche League reports that body piercing, including nipple piercing has
been a common practice throughout history. There have not been problems reported
that are specifically associated with breastfeeding and pierced nipples. General
recommendations include keeping the area clean and removing nipple jewelry before
allowing the baby to breastfeed. Also, nipple piercing while breastfeeding is
probably not feasible due to the 3 month or longer healing time required. For
more information, consider visiting this web site: </p>
<p><a href="http://www.lalecheleague.org/llleaderweb/LV/LVJunJul99p64.html">http://www.lalecheleague.org/llleaderweb/LV/LVJunJul99p64.html</a></p>
<p><strong> Can moms drink alcohol and breastfeed? </strong></p>
<p> -Yes and maybe. Numerous professional sources including Thomas W. Hale, R.Ph.
Ph.D., University of Texas (author of Medication and Mother&rsquo;s Milk), American
College of Nurse-Midwives, and American Academy of Pediatrics agree that moderate
and occasional consumption of alcohol is usually compatible with breastfeeding.
Important considerations are: </p>
<p> -The baby&rsquo;s age - A newborn has an immature liver and will take longer
to metabolize any of the alcohol that gets into the mom&rsquo;s milk. </p>
<p> -Moms body size - A larger mother can metabolize alcohol more quickly than
a smaller mom. </p>
<p> -Amount of alcohol consumed - Most sources report that waiting 2 hours for
every drink (12 oz beer, 5 oz wine, 1 standard drink - including 1 shot of spirits
such as vodka, whiskey, rum, tequila, etc) or until the mother feels neurologically
normal, is a reasonable waiting period. </p>
<p> -A helpful calculator for how long alcohol takes to be metabolized can be
found at: </p>
<p><a href="http://www.obfocus.com/calculators/alcoholinmilk.htm">http://www.obfocus.com/calculators/alcoholinmilk.htm</a></p>
<p> Please note that moms do not need to pump to get rid of the alcohol. A mom&rsquo;s
milk is a dynamic fluid, the milk and alcohol are not trapped. A mom&rsquo;s
liver will metabolize the alcohol in the breastmilk like the alcohol in her blood
stream.</p>
<p><strong> What about caffeine? </strong></p>
<p> American College of Nurse-Midwives provides a well documented and succinct
recommendation. From their web site, <a href="http://www.gotmom.org/"> www.gotmom.org</a></p>
<p> Though dietary caffeine appears in breast milk, nursing mothers can safely
consume small amounts of caffeine without passing on a significant amount to
the baby. Higher caffeine amounts could potentially cause problems such as poor
sleeping, nervousness, irritability, and poor feeding, so limiting your caffeine
intake makes sense. </p>
<p> Caffeine tends to build up in babies&rsquo; systems because their bodies
cannot get rid of it very easily. Try using decaffeinated coffee and tea, and
avoid colas and other carbonated drinks that have added caffeine. The American
Academy of Pediatrics recommends that nursing women limit consumption to the
caffeine equivalent of 1 to 3 cups of coffee per day. </p>

the future articles.</p>
<h4>Editorial Comment: Suzan Murphy </h4>
<p> The above questions and answers are short phone call answers to sometimes
complex issues. For more in-depth information, please consider the following:</p>
<p> Regarding alcohol: </p>
<ul>
<li> When moms plan for a 12 oz of beer with pizza next weekend or a standard
mixed drink or 5 oz of wine at the annual office party, the &ldquo;2 hours for
every drink&rdquo; has clinical support. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> Often moms will choose to not drink alcohol rather than worry about timing
feedings. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> Choosing to drink non-alcoholic beverages is the safest choice, for breastfeeding
and driving home. Alcohol goes into the breast milk and until is metabolized
out, safe levels have not been determined. Drinking extra water, more coffee,
or pumping have not been shown to make the breast milk have less alcohol, like
the rest of the body, the milk glands have to wait for the liver to do its job. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> Sometimes moms ask or call after drinking alcohol and need to know when
it is safe to resume breastfeeding &ndash; it helps to &ldquo;do the math&rdquo; with
moms &ndash; count the drinks, review portion size, multiple by 2 hours, - also
consider when the last drink was. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> If the moms describe risky drinking patterns (defined by ACOG as more than
7 drinks per week or more than 3 drinks at a time) &ndash; consider using this
opportunity to ask more questions, offer resources and information, and provide
pathways for moms and families to healthier lives. ACOG link below </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> Sometimes it is hard to find behaviors to praise with those who have risky
or serious drinking issues. For those moms who are seeking sobriety and choose
to use formula to keep their baby safe, it can be a difficult and painful choice.
It may help them to acknowledge the wisdom of their decision. </li>
</ul>
<p> Regarding tobacco, chewed or smoked: </p>
<ul>
<li> Mom/families often call about using (legal) tobacco. They ask if they should
stop breastfeeding if they smoke or chew. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> Exposure to the baby can be from the mom smoking or smoking/chewing and
breastfeeding, from 2 nd hand smoke, or 2 nd hand to mother and then to the baby
by way of environmental exposure or breast milk. The tobacco by products that
appear in breast milk and infant&rsquo;s urine are cotinine and nicotine. Cotinine
and nicotine are associated with SIDS and colic. There are no known safe levels.
In one study, the urinary cotinine levels were higher babies breastfed by smoking
moms than babies formula fed by smoking moms. ( Becker AB et al1999) </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> However, study results vary. A recent study reported that babies breastfed
by mothers who smoked had lower cotinine and nicotine urine levels than babies
whose mothers smoked, but were formula fed. (Bajanowski T et al 2007) </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> Regarding nicotine patches for smoking cessation: A recent study found use
of nicotine patches to be safer option than continued smoking. When mothers were
smoking almost 1 ppd, the nicotine and cotinine levels their breast milk were
similar to those mothers using the 21-mg/day patch. But when the patch strength
was tapered to 14-mg and 7&ndash;mg, the nicotine and cotinine concentrations
decreased significantly. There was also no significant influence on the milk
supply when the patch was used. (Ilett KF et al 2003) </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> When a family does not use tobacco, it greatly reduces the risk of exposing
new life to known problem agents. There is more to be learned. Currently, the
American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) states that the benefits of breastfeeding
are greater than known risks of tobacco by products in breast milk.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong> Breast-Feeding Enhances Vision Development in Infants </strong></p>
<p> CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the hypothesis that breastfeeding benefits
long-term stereoscopic development. An effect of DHA cannot be excluded, but
the lack of difference in stereoacuity between infants randomly assigned to DHA-containing
and those assigned to control formula raises the hypothesis that factors in breast
milk other than DHA account for the observed benefits. </p>

<p><strong> Simple antenatal preparation to improve breastfeeding practice: RCT </strong></p>
<p> CONCLUSION: Where breastfeeding practices are suboptimal, simple one-encounter
antenatal education and counseling significantly improve breastfeeding practice
up to 3 months after delivery. Provision of printed or audiovisual educational
material is not enough. Health care workers should make every effort to have
one face-to-face encounter to discuss breastfeeding with expectant mothers before
they deliver. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: (www.ClinicalTrials.gov), NCT002770192

<p><strong> Longer duration of lactation associated with favorable changes in metabolic

<p><strong> Postpartum Mastitis and Community-Acquired Methicillin-Resistant S. Aureus </strong></p>
<p> Summary: Community Acquired (CA) MRSA has emerged as an increasingly common
pathogen in PPM. Therapy against CA-MRSA should be considered in refractory or
severe cases of PPM until wound, drainage, or breast milk cultures can be obtained.
Adjunct surgical drainage or aspiration is often warranted in such cases. Additional
study is required to determine the utility of routine cultures in postpartum
mastitis, the prevalence of CA-MRSA in this emerging problem, and the consequences
of CA-MRSA colonization for breastfeeding infants. </p>

<p><strong> Guidelines for Palliative Care Services in the Indian Health: Now
Online</strong><strong></strong></p>
<p> The newly released Guidelines for Palliative Care Services in the Indian
Health System provide guidance and common language around what constitutes a
program of palliative care for our IHS, Tribal, and Urban Indian Health programs
as well as a tool for implementation of services. The Guidelines were adapted
from the work of the National Consensus Project for Quality Palliative Care (NCP)
whose purpose is &ldquo;to promote the implementation of Clinical Practice Guidelines
that ensure care of consistent and high quality, and that guide the development
and structure of new and existing palliative care services.&rdquo; <a href="http://www.nationalconsensusproject.org/">http://www.nationalconsensusproject.org/</a>.</p>
<p> An interdisciplinary Indian Health workgroup adapted the NCP guidelines to
the Indian Health setting, aiming for guidelines that were feasible within our
system and still provided a high level of quality. This workgroup had the help
of a large number of national experts in palliative care who reviewed the guidelines
and provided valuable suggestions in their development. For questions or assistance
in the development of palliative care services contact Mary Jo Crissler, Tim
Domer, or Bruce Finke. <a href="mailto:Bruce.Finke@ihs.gov">Bruce.Finke@ihs.gov</a></p>

<p><strong> Disability among older Americans continues significant decline</strong></p>
<p> Changes in the health and functioning of the Medicare-enrolled population
aged 65+ are tracked by using the 1982-2004/2005 National Long-Term Care Surveys.
We found a significant rate of decline in the prevalence of chronic disability
that accelerated from 1982 to 2004. These declines are significant for both persons
with less severe chronic disability, which might be compensated by modifying
the built environment and providing assistive devices, and for persons with more
serious disability, which may be affected by reductions in the incidence and
severity of disease through biomedical interventions. Declines in chronic disability
continued over the 22-year period at a rate fast enough (i.e., 1.52% per annum)
to contribute significantly to the long-term fiscal stability of the Medicare
(and Medicaid) programs. Changes in the rate and substance of disability declines
seem consistent with the intentions of policy interventions in Medicare and Medicaid. </p>

<p><strong> Non-latex versus latex male condoms for contraception </strong></p>
<p> AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Although the nonlatex condoms were associated with
higher rates of clinical breakage than their latex comparison condoms, the new
condoms still provide an acceptable alternative for those with allergies, sensitivities,
or preferences that might prevent the consistent use of latex condoms. The contraceptive
efficacy of the nonlatex condoms requires more research. </p>

<p><strong> Q. Does misoprostol aid prior to IUD insertion? </strong></p>
<p> A. Yes, misoprostol appears to soften the cervix and decrease complications.</p>
<p><strong> Answer </strong></p>
<p> Evidence is suggestive that misoprostol is useful for IUD insertions. Misoprostol
softens the cervix and reduces the chance of complications such as perforation,
pain, and bleeding. In addition, RCTs have shown that misoprostol improves the
ease with which the cervix can be dilated and reduces complications in premenopausal
women, postmenopausal women, and nulliparous women undergoing operative hysteroscopy,
though the studies are small. As with many issues surrounding misoprostol, the
optimum dosing and regimen remain in question. The doses referenced below range
from 200 &ndash; 400 mcg given 12 -24 hours before the procedure. </p>

<p><strong> Q. What are Pilates? (pronounced puh-LAH-teez) </strong></p>
<p> A. Pilates once a body-conditioning regime known only to elite athletes,
dancers, performers and models, has gone mainstream. Details below</p>
<p> The following is an article referenced from the University of Alaska Health
Sciences Information Service Newsletter : December 2006 </p>
<p><a href="http://consortiumlibrary.org/hsis/site/about/newsletters/Dec06.pdf">http://consortiumlibrary.org/hsis/site/about/newsletters/Dec06.pdf</a></p>
<p><strong> Pilates : The Mind-Body Workout that Transforms! </strong></p>
<p> Pilates (pronounced puh-LAH-teez), once a body-conditioning regime known
only to elite athletes, dancers, performers and models, has gone mainstream.
It stresses mind-body synchronization and is based on six principles and over
500 exercises which emphasize precision rather than quantity.1 A maximum of 3,
5 or 10 repetitions are initiated and controlled in the core of the body, and
breathing is carefully synchronized with them. With over 500 Pilates studios
in North America alone, Pilates is the new Fountain of Youth for baby boomers
seeking to extend heir youth and vitality into old age.</p>
<p> How it all began </p>
<p> Born in Germany in 1880, Joseph Pilates was a weak and sickly child. Determined
to improve his health, he took up bodybuilding, skiing, diving and gymnastics,
and became an accomplished boxer and circus performer. He also studied eastern
philosophies, yoga and martial arts, incorporating the best attributes of each
into a unique practice he called &ldquo;contrology&rdquo;, which he used to treat
the sick and injured during World War I. Using old hospital beds, unused springs
and other surplus gear at hand, he designed his &ldquo;signature&rdquo; equipment
to improve muscle strength in the bedridden, who regained mobility unexpectedly
quickly. In 1926, Pilates moved to New York and with his wife Clara set up his
first studio, attracting modern dancers and other performers. One student, Romana
Kryzanowska, was hand-picked to train authentic Pilates instructors after Pilates&rsquo; death
in 1960, when the training regimen became known as Pilates.2 Now in her eighties,
Romana is still teaching.3</p>
<p> What&rsquo;s so special? </p>
<p> Pilates training is designed to strengthen the body core &ndash; the &ldquo;powerhouse&rdquo; of
muscles in the deep abdomen, buttocks, and around the spine. Strengthening these
muscles has been found effective in alleviating and preventing back pain. Body
and mind are developed together. Instructors focus on developing awareness of
proper alignment of the body and isolation of specific muscles, balance, smooth
breathing, mental focus, and graceful flow of the movements. Stretching and lengthening
exercises are done on mats and specially designed apparatus offering resistance
and support, including the Reformer, Arc Barrel, Cadillac and Wunda Chair.4 Other &ldquo;props&rdquo; include
the fitness circle, flex band, and Bosu (a hemisphere with a soft top and firm
base, used to develop balance).</p>
<p> The Benefits </p>
<p> Pilates reshapes and conditions the body for speed, power and precision.
Pilates provides cross-training for athletes, and improves athletic performance
by increasing muscular endurance, mind-body awareness, understanding of body
position and placement, and balance.5 It also helps the non-athletic: injuries
are minimized when the core is strong, and movement is carefully controlled and
coordinated. Athletes such as Tiger Woods and Jason Kidd, have endorsed Pilates
for developing superior posture, body strength and flexibility.4 Film stars and
models have discovered Pilates to help maintain their sculpted figures. (An added
bonus is &ldquo;killer&rdquo; kegels &ndash; you can avoid incontinence as one
ages)</p>
<p> Getting started </p>
<p> A &ldquo;boot camp&rdquo; or introductory session with certified Pilates
instructors helps the novice learn to isolate and engage the body&rsquo;s deep
core muscles. Instructors then offer hour-long mat or Reformer sessions with
individuals or small groups, who are allowed to progress at their own speed.
Level I and Level II classes are available. Ongoing correction ensures the exercises
are being done properly. Some health clubs have incorporated Pilates-inspired
exercises into their program, providing an easy transition for athletes unfamiliar
with Pilates, though less rigorous than the environment of licensed Pilates studios.7
After correctly mastering the basic techniques, some excellent self-instruction
programs on DVD are available if the student wants to continue on his/her own.</p>

a physician quality reporting system by CMS. CMS has titled the statutory program
the 2007 Physician Quality Reporting Initiative. </p>
<p> PQRI establishes a financial incentive for eligible professionals to participate
in a voluntary quality reporting program. Eligible professionals who successfully
report a designated set of quality measures on claims for dates of service from
July 1 to December 31, 2007, may earn a bonus payment, subject to a cap, of 1.5%
of total allowed charges for covered Medicare physician fee schedule services. </p>
<p> This newly established webpage will be updated regularly, so check it often
for timely and reliable information from CMS. <a href="http://www.cms.hhs.gov/PQRI/01_Overview.asp#TopOfPage">http://www.cms.hhs.gov/PQRI/01_Overview.asp#TopOfPage</a></p>

<p><strong> Testing New Drugs on the World&rsquo;s Poorest Patients </strong></p>
<p> In the film The Constant Gardener, based on the novel by John LeCarr&eacute;,
the protagonist battles representatives of a nefarious pharmaceutical company
intent on concealing evidence of unethical medical research on impoverished African
subjects. Though fictional, the film and book film drew public attention to a
real and growing phenomenon in which wealthy pharmaceutical corporations farm
out basic medical research to so-called &ldquo;CROs&rdquo; (contract research
organizations). In order to secure the large numbers of human test subjects required
to meet the gold standard criteria for drug approval demanded by the FDA &ndash; the
randomized placebo-controlled double-blind trial &ndash; the CROs turn to economically
vulnerable populations. Increasingly, they look beyond the domestic poor to international
settings where signing up for a research protocol may provide the patient&rsquo;s
best (or only) chance of receiving medical care. In an era in which drugs are
one of the most lucrative businesses around, human research subjects have thus
become a hot international commodity.</p>
<p> For those who are interested in the facts behind the popular fiction, a recent
book by investigative journalist Sonia Shah explores the phenomenon of international
clinical drug trials at some length. In The Body Hunters, Shah details the factors
driving US-based pharmaceutical companies, unable to find sufficient numbers
of enrollees at home, to outsource their drug trials to countries like India,
South Africa, and the former Soviet Socialist Republics. Here, she argues, wealthy
corporations benefit from a combination of less restrictive regulatory environments
and more desperate patient populations, the end result of which is larger enrollments
in their trials. While much of this ground has been trodden before &ndash; one
could plausibly argue that she makes very little original contribution to the
discussion &ndash; Shah does a commendable job of consolidating a wide and unwieldy
range of academic, historical and journalistic investigations in a readable,
largely balanced, and engagingly written book.</p>
<p> In a PLoS Medicine piece, Trudo Lemmens and Paul Miller explore a related
issue: financial compensation of physicians who recruit patients from their practices
to join clinical trials. Though their legal status remains murky, explicit &ldquo;finders
fees&rdquo; are clearly prohibited by most professional medical ethical codes
(including that of the AMA). Nonetheless, various recruitment incentives have
been designed to wiggle through loopholes in these various professional codes,
with the net effect of insuring that &ldquo;patients have become de facto market
products,&rdquo; as Lemmens and Miller put it. Like Shah, these authors believe
that institutional review boards have proved inadequate to the task of protecting
vulnerable populations from the powerful vested interests of big pharma. The
authors call for a rethinking of national and international regulations to prevent &ldquo;jurisdiction
shopping,&rdquo; in which companies scout the world for those countries with
the most favorable (or least onerous) legal and financial climate for patient
recruitment.</p>
<p> The globalization of biomedicine and the increasing interpenetration of medicine
and industry are combining to ensure that formerly distinct borders &ndash; geopolitical,
professional, disciplinary &ndash; are increasingly fluid, arbitrary, and manipulable.
Whose interests will be served and how the vulnerable will be protected in the
context of these shifting alliances and opportunities are questions of urgent
and ongoing importance to all of us.</p>

<p> From: NHTSA press release: &ldquo;Since 2000, 38 States have strengthened
their child restraint laws to require booster seat use by children who have outgrown
their child safety seats, but who still cannot ride safely using adult seat belts.&nbsp; These
booster seat provisions have been enacted to better protect child passengers
in the 4 to 8 age group.&nbsp; Although progress has been made in many respects,
nearly 1,700 of these children have been killed and more than 265,000 have been
injured in crashes since 2001.</p>
<p> Knowing that law enforcement agencies appreciate specially designed tools
to facilitate the enforcement of new requirements, this new six-minute roll-call
video was developed to help officers enforce booster seat requirements during
traffic stops.&nbsp; &quot;Booster Seats -- The Missing Link&quot; provides meaningful
details about the need for booster seat use, as well as moving personal accounts
about booster seats (including longtime booster seat advocate Autumn Alexander

<p><strong> Studies Show Hearing Loss of Any Degree Has Significant Impact on
Children&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p> Numerous cognitive and developmental delays, including the ability to pay
attention have been associated with hearing loss. A child's ability to regulate
his or her attention (sustaining attention, disregarding distractions, staying
attentive to task goals, etc.) can affect school readiness and later academic
performance. This pilot study shows how learning and using appropriate parenting
techniques can help children with hearing loss develop these skills. 2006 Convention

<p><strong> Fetal and Perinatal Mortality,</strong><strong> NVSR </strong></p>
<p> Results&mdash;The U.S. fetal mortality rate in 2003 was 6.23 fetal deaths
of 20 weeks of gestation or more per 1,000 live births and fetal deaths. Fetal
and perinatal mortality rates have declined slowly but steadily from 1990 to
2003. Fetal mortality rates for 28 weeks of gestation or more have declined substantially,
whereas those for 20&ndash;27 weeks of gestation have not declined. Fetal mortality
rates are higher for a number of groups, including non-Hispanic black women,
teenagers, women aged 35 years and over, unmarried women, and multiple deliveries.
Over one-half (51 percent) of fetal deaths of 20 weeks of gestation or more occurred
between 20 and 27 weeks of gestation. </p>

<p><strong> 1918 Flu Epidemic Teaching Valuable Lessons</strong> : <strong>Actions
Taken Apparently Were Effective</strong></p>
<p> New analysis of how American cities responded to the killer Spanish flu of
1918 suggests that closing schools, banning large gatherings, staggering work
hours and quarantining households of the ill may have saved tens of thousands
of lives. </p>
<p> Which of the many non-pharmaceutical interventions was especially effective
in reducing mortality is unknown, but all would theoretically be available should
pandemic influenza again sweep the country. </p>
<p> The new findings run counter to previous research that concluded that the
public health measures instituted in 1918 may have delayed or dampened the epidemic
in many cities but probably had little effect on the ultimate death toll. </p>
<p> The new data were presented this week to Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention experts, who are helping to draw up guidelines for what local health
departments might do during the early stage of an influenza pandemic, when a
vaccine would be unavailable and there would be too few antiviral drugs to go
around&hellip;..Excerpted from an article by David Brown Washington Post Staff

<h3 id="topics" style="margin-top: 0pt;"><a name="mmtour"></a>Medical Mystery Tour</h3>
<p><strong> Prolonged second stage with an epidural </strong></p>
<p> Let&rsquo;s review last month&rsquo;s case briefly&hellip;..a primigravid
at 41 3/7 weeks with a history of polycystic ovarian syndrome, a 41 lb. weight
gain, a known female infant, and one abnormal result on a 3 hour glucose tolerance
test had a prolonged second stage with epidural anesthesia. Exam had revealed
an estimated fetal weight of &ldquo;9 + lbs&rdquo;. Her temperature rose to 100.6
F and she was started on intravenous gentamicin and ampicillin. Stage I was desultory
after misoprostol cervical ripening and required pitocin augmentation.</p>
<p> As Stage II neared 4 hours the risks and benefits of vacuum assistance were
discussed with the patient and it was agreed to proceed. The vacuum extractor
was placed during 3 contractions. Subsequently, the fetal presenting part descended
to +3/5 with the scalp visible without pushing. The fetal heart tones were reassuring
throughout. The patient is noticeably beginning to tire and subjectively seems
to be pushing less effectively.</p>
<p><strong> What would you have done at that point? </strong></p>
<p> -Allow the patient to push for 30 minutes more and re-evaluate </p>
<p> -Notify the OR team and discuss cesarean delivery </p>
<p> -Wait for the epidural to completely wear off </p>
<p> -Apply the vacuum for a second trial </p>
<p> -Add clindamycin </p>
<p> -Other&hellip;</p>
<p><strong> Let&rsquo;s take a &lsquo;time out&rsquo; here </strong></p>
<p> A valid argument could be made for virtually all the above choices. Assuming
a reassuring fetal tracing there is no magic to a certain numerical length of
Stage II, especially if the patient did not have a strong sensation throughout
and was allowed to &lsquo;labor down&rsquo; with an epidural. If you choose that
course be sure your documentation reflects that the patient was not actively
pushing during that period. On the other hand, the delivery provider should be
aware that the patient has developed several risk factors that make a successful
vaginal delivery fraught with potential difficulty.</p>
<p> The one exception would the choice to reapply the vacuum for a second trial.
Before we explore that option though, perhaps we may want to re-explore the use
of the vacuum the first time. This patient had several risk factors that predispose
patients to a possible shoulder dystocia.</p>
<p><strong> Risk factors for shoulder dystocia </strong></p>
<p> -Fetal macrosomia</p>
<p> -Glucose Intolerance </p>
<p> -Operative vaginal delivery</p>
<p> -History of shoulder dystocia</p>
<p> -Labor abnormalities</p>
<p> -Postterm pregnancy</p>
<p> -Male fetal gender</p>
<p> -Obesity and high weight gain</p>
<p> -Advanced maternal age</p>
<p> -Shoulder-pelvis disproportion</p>
<p> Shoulder dystocia is best defined as the need for additional obstetric maneuvers
to effect delivery of the fetal shoulders at the time of vaginal delivery. It
occurs in 0.2 to 3 percent of all births and represents an obstetric emergency.
Shoulder dystocias can be anticipated only rarely, as many occur in the absence
of identifiable risk factors. Therefore, all obstetric care providers must be
prepared to recognize a shoulder dystocia immediately and proceed through an
orderly sequence of steps to effect delivery in a timely manner and minimize
risk to the mother and fetus. It should be noted, however, that permanent birth
injury, and even fetal death, can result in cases of shoulder dystocia that are
appropriately identified and managed. </p>
<p> This patient has the majority of the above risk factors. Let us explore a
two of the more salient aspects:</p>
<p><strong> One abnormal glucose tolerance test result: </strong></p>
<p> This condition is often overlooked, but is associated with macrosomia. Women
with one abnormal value on the oral GTT demonstrate fasting insulin concentrations
and insulin resistance comparable to that of women with GDM, and they are more
likely to deliver a macrosomic infant than women without GDM or women with GDM
that is treated. The management of these patients is controversial. Some have
recommended that they be treated the same as women who meet standard criteria
for GDM, others have not considered further intervention or recommended repeating
the oral GTT in four weeks . Studies have shown that treatment of women with
one abnormal GTT value decreases the risk of a macrosomic infant and is cost-effective.</p>
<p><strong> Operative vaginal delivery: </strong></p>
<p> Operative vaginal delivery is a risk factor for shoulder dystocia. It is
not known whether shoulder dystocia is a result of instrument-aided descent of
the fetus or is the underlying reason the fetus has not descended naturally.
In a classic study, the combination of macrosomia (defined as birth weight greater
than 4000 g), prolonged second stage, and midpelvic operative delivery was associated
with a 21 percent incidence of shoulder dystocia. By comparison, when only prolonged
second stage and midpelvic operative delivery were present, the risk fell to
4.57 percent and was 0.16 percent in the absence of these risk factors. One review
concluded that instrumental delivery was the intrapartum risk factor most associated
with permanent brachial plexus injury.</p>
<p> While operative vaginal delivery is just one of many risk factors, it represents
a &lsquo;sin of commission&rsquo;. In many cases one never knows exactly what
will / will not occur without prior intervention in a rare event like shoulder
dystocia. On the other hand, if one has performed an operative vaginal delivery,
then right or wrong, all the subsequent events are viewed within the purview
of that action. Hence, it becomes a post hoc assumption that the fetus was &lsquo;pulled&rsquo; into
the shoulder dystocia.</p>
<p><strong> Back to our case </strong></p>
<p> In this case, the vacuum extractor was re-applied for 3 more applications
of traction which brought the presenting part to crowning shortly followed by
the &lsquo;turtle sign&rsquo;. Gentle traction, McRoberts, and nuchal cord release
x2 were performed without success. A procto-episotomy was performed without success,
followed by the Woods screw maneuver without success. Attention was then paid
to the posterior arm and delivery was accomplished after a total of 2 minutes
on the perineum. The parturient was taken to the OR for a 4 th degree laceration
repair. The patient notes continued fecal incontinence at this writing.</p>
<p> The infant had good cord pH(s), but Apgars of 2/5. The infant was admitted
to the special care nursery for one day after resuscitation in the labor suite
due to hypotension and ventilation requirements. The infant weighted slightly
more than 9 pounds and had a fractured clavicle. The infant was discharged in
stable condition after one subsequent day in the step down unit. There were no
neurologic deficits and the child has done well in well child care.</p>
<p> In retrospect, though shoulder dsytocia is a rare event and this one was
managed quite well, I think there is an element of it being &lsquo;lucky rather
than good&rsquo;. Perhaps this represents a &lsquo;near miss&rsquo;, if you will.
In either case, I submit that if you have what is very likely a macrosomic infant
with a prolonged labor, that you not perform operative vaginal delivery.</p>
<p> In addition, I strongly suggest that when you do attend a macrosomic delivery,
that you encourage the fetus to &lsquo;deliver through&rsquo;. In other words,
once the fetus is in the final expulsive effort, that you continue the downward
momentum until the anterior shoulder is visible, e. g., do not stop the downward
progress to suction the oropharynx.</p>
<p> In regard to operative vaginal delivery in this setting, it is perhaps best
to remember the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin"> Latin</a> phrase
Primum non nocere &quot;First, do no harm&quot;.</p>

<p><strong> Oral, not Transdermal, Estrogen Increases Risk for VTE in Women&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p> CONCLUSIONS: Oral but not transdermal estrogen is associated with an increased
VTE risk. In addition, our data suggest that norpregnane derivatives may be thrombogenic,
whereas micronized progesterone and pregnane derivatives appear safe with respect
to thrombotic risk. If confirmed, these findings could benefit women in the management
of their menopausal symptoms with respect to the VTE risk associated with oral
estrogen and use of progestogens </p>

<p><strong> Nonhormonal therapies for menopausal hot flashes: systematic review and meta-analysis </strong></p>
<p> CONCLUSION: The SSRIs or SNRIs, clonidine, and gabapentin trials provide
evidence for efficacy; however, effects are less than for estrogen, few trials
have been published and most have methodological deficiencies, generalizability
is limited, and adverse effects and cost may restrict use for many women. These
therapies may be most useful for highly symptomatic women who cannot take estrogen
but are not optimal choices for most women. </p>

<p><strong> Being Present </strong></p>
<p><strong> The spirituality of presence in midwifery care </strong></p>
<p> Pembroke and Pembroke have written an article that is a must-read for all
of us that attend women in pregnancy, labor and birth, and, actually, it is highly
relevant in the provision of any kind of health care. It is essential reading
for the student who needs to learn the art and not just the technical science
of what we do and it will remind experienced providers of the human contact we
must strive to achieve even on the busiest day. I highly recommend that you read
the entire article (if you can not get the full text through PubMed please contact
me and I will email it to you) but here are a few of the juiciest morsels. </p>
<p> &ldquo;Presence involves an offering of self (Scoppo, 2003). In being present
to the other, one generously makes available one&rsquo;s personal resources.
To be present as a midwife is to be open, available and receptive to the needs
and preferences of the woman (Berg et al., 1996; Lundberg, 2004).&rdquo; </p>
<p> &ldquo;A caring presence involves creating an environment of trust and security.&rdquo; </p>
<p> The authors present a discussion of spirituality, which is a clear reminder
that our work is not about us and our egos&mdash;it is about being with the other. </p>
<p> &ldquo;The spiritual person identifies making meaning out of one&rsquo;s
existence on earth as a central human task. The journey into meaning usually
involves self-transcendence. To be spiritual is to break through the confining
and limiting grip of egoism. Egotistic persons are locked up inside themselves;
they have little or no capacity to reach out to others and to the world around
them. Overcoming selfish tendencies in order to help others is central in an
authentic spirituality.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Next they present two concepts that make presence possible&mdash;responsibility
and availability. The discussion of responsibility is based on Buber&rsquo;s
work: &ldquo;He is talking about &lsquo;responsiveness&rsquo;, about the ability
to respond to the other person and her needs and aspirations. For Buber responsibility
is a deep capacity to respond to the claims others make on us. It requires an
acute awareness of the other through which she becomes present in her wholeness
and uniqueness.&rdquo; </p>
<p> &ldquo;In order to be genuinely responsive to a woman, it is necessary to
include oneself in her inner world. That is, one must discover precisely what
it is that she needs and values. Women ask to be sensitively listened to. Further
they ask that the midwife approach them with a respect for their uniqueness.&rdquo; </p>
<p> The authors discuss availability in terms of receptivity and being open and &ldquo;porous&rdquo; or
permeable to the communication from others. They also discuss hospitality as
pivotal and present a fascinating picture of midwife as host: &ldquo;Hospitality
plays a vitally important role in engaging on a personal, friendly level with
women. We need to ask, however, whether or not it is appropriate to refer to
a midwife as a host. Many would rather have it that the midwife is the invited
guest (Leap, 2000; Kenedy, 2003). The primary actor in the birthing experience
is the woman. She invites others to be with her as she gives birth. There is
still a place, we contend, for the appellation &lsquo;host&rsquo; in relation
to the midwife&rsquo;s role. It is clearly wrong to refer to him or her as host
of the birthing process. To speak of him or her as host in the context of the
relationship he or she shares with the woman is, however, not only appropriate
but also illuminating. It is illuminating because it reminds us that the midwife
is called upon to mentally establish an open space that will be filled by the
woman&rsquo;s needs and preferences. To be available to the woman involves listening
to her and following her lead through the process of childbirth (Lundgren, 2004).
Midwives need a certain &lsquo;incohesion&rsquo; in order to be truly receptive.
If they fill their internal spaces with their own commitments and preferences,
there is no place for the woman to make contact.&rdquo; </p>

<p><strong> History and Evidence Base for Normal Birth </strong></p>
<p> The Winter 2007 supplement to the Journal of Perinatal Education describes
the history of the Coalition for Improving Maternity Services as part of a global
effort to promote &quot;normal birth&quot; (as established by universal guidelines
for the routine care of women during uncomplicated labor and childbirth). The
supplement presents the principles underlying the Mother-Friendly Childbirth
Initiative (MFCI), the first consensus declaration in the history of North America
in which a multidisciplinary body of professional organizations and individuals
address the issues of labor and birth. The supplement also identifies the Ten
Steps of Mother-Friendly Care that lay out the practical application of the philosophy
and principles of the MFCI and introduce the evidence base for the Ten Steps.
Discussion and commentary are provided. The supplement is intended for use by
health professionals, families, and others in supporting normal birth and breastfeeding
as the standard of care for all women. The supplement is available to journal

Corner, Jean Howe, Chinle</h3>
<p><strong> New ACOG recommendations challenging for rural IHS sites&mdash;a
plea for sharing strategies to meet national standards in the face of limited
resources&hellip; </strong></p>
<p> One new challenge facing Navajo Area prenatal providers, and probably many
others providing care to pregnant women at rural sites throughout IHS, is what
to do about all the new options for prenatal genetic screening. ACOG recently
issued a Practice Bulletin, Screening for Fetal Chromosomal Abnormalities, which
reviews the tests currently available and acknowledges how confusing this area
has become. You know you&rsquo;re in a difficult situation when ACOG includes
a section entitled, &ldquo;With so many Down syndrome screening tests available,
how do I decide which tests to offer?&rdquo;</p>
<p> Before one wades through the array of available tests, it seems important
to acknowledge a couple of new guiding principles that we are being asked to
incorporate into our practice: </p>
<ul>
<li> It&rsquo;s not just about age any more. Although the risk of Down syndrome
and other chromosome abnormalities increase with age for individual women, most
Down syndrome babies are born to young women. It has become the standard of care
to offer prenatal screening for chromosome abnormalities to all women as part
of routine prenatal care. </li>
<li> It&rsquo;s not just about second trimester screening anymore. There are
now well-established methods of first trimester screening. We need to figure
out how to make these testing options available to our patients. </li>
</ul>
<p> Other principles haven&rsquo;t changed at all. Our job as providers is to
share information about screening options and offer non-directive counseling.
It is still the woman&rsquo;s choice to decide what (if any) tests she would
like to have done and her right to decline testing altogether. Some women seek
information to consider termination of pregnancy, others to make special preparations
before the birth of a baby with additional needs. Also, because of the distance
to tertiary care facilities, some infants may benefit from prenatal diagnosis
that allows planned deliveries in urban centers with additional resources.</p>
<p> There are several markers that can be used to calculate a risk for Down syndrome.
One relatively new test is the nuchal translucency measurement (NT), a measure
of the thickness of the fluid collection at the back of the fetal neck in the
first trimester. To be used for calculating Down syndrome risk, NT measurements
must be performed by certified sonographers with special training and ongoing
monitoring. Optimal NT measurements are obtained at 12-13 weeks although the
test may be performed from 10 4/7 to 13 6/7 weeks. Not all patients sent for
NT testing will be able to have images successfully obtained. Serum first trimester
measurements include PAPP-A (pregnancy-associated plasma protein A) and total
or free &beta; hCG. Second trimester serum markers include MSAFP (maternal serum
alpha-fetoprotein), hCG, and unconjugated estriol which are used in calculation
of a &ldquo;triple screen&rdquo;; with the addition of inhibin A this becomes
a &ldquo;quad screen&rdquo;. The main focus of this testing has become the identification
of Down syndrome although some of these markers are also used in the identification
of other conditions, including trisomy 18 and open neural tube defects.</p>
<p> The ACOG Practice Bulletin provides much detail about the different screening
tests, their detection rates, and their false positive rates. One relevant comparison
for any facility still doing second trimester triple screen testing is the improved
detection of Down syndrome with the change to Quad screening (from &lt;70% to
over 80%). ACOG answers the question about how to choose with several considerations,
including the following: </p>
<p> &ldquo;...If nuchal translucency measurement is not available or cannot be
obtained in an individual patient, a reasonable approach is to offer serum integrated
screening [with a detection rate of 85-88%] to patients who present early and
second-trimester screening to those who present later.&rdquo;</p>
<p> This still leaves a great deal of work to be done. A review of the tests
available through our contracted laboratory provider fails to identify any test
options that combine first and second trimester serum testing but do not also
rely on NT measurements. And as NT measurements are only available at tertiary
care facilities several hours away, this just isn&rsquo;t a realistic option
for wholesale screening for our rural facility, especially given the narrow window
of dates when testing can be done. So, for our site, and some other sites in
Navajo, we&rsquo;ve transitioned to Quad screening but haven&rsquo;t resolved
the first trimester dilemma. If you work at a rural site and have successfully
addressed this problem, we&rsquo;d like to hear from you. Also, if anyone has
found or created a culturally sensitive patient education brochure about prenatal
genetic screening, please share!</p>
<h4> OB/GYN CCC Editorial comment: </h4>
<p><strong> Let&rsquo;s begin a dialogue </strong></p>
<p> I want to thank Jean Howe for bringing up this issue, as it is a major concern
nationwide. Various suggestions have included that we adapt a serum screening
strategy whereby we only refer the women who have abnormal results. Each Area
would need to negotiate with their lab, or find a new lab, e. g., is the lab
able to integrate the NTD results? The PAPP-A and free bHCG can be done at 10-13
wks if the patient comes early enough. If so, then perform the quad screen at
15-20 and integrate the results, or refer if there is an abnormal 1st trimester
result. Patients who come later can get a quad screen, and refer those with abnormal
results if they so wish. </p>
<p> Let us know how your Area has solved this emerging problem. <a href="mailto:nmurphy@scf.cc">nmurphy@scf.cc</a></p>

<p> CONCLUSIONS: More than 300 related studies were reviewed. However, the level
of evidence in most cases is at Cochrane level 4 or 5, indicating the need for
further research. Forty-three recommendations are presented that include, but
are not limited to, endorsement of a shared decision-making model, early and
repeated care conferencing to reduce family stress and improve consistency in
communication, honoring culturally appropriate requests for truth-telling and
informed refusal, spiritual support, staff education and debriefing to minimize
the impact of family interactions on staff health, family presence at both rounds
and resuscitation, open flexible visitation, way-finding and family-friendly
signage, and family support before, during, and after a death. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&cmd=Search&itool=pubmed_AbstractPlus&term=%22Davidson+JE%22%5BAuthor%5D"> Davidson

teens aged 15--19 years are less likely to receive timely prenatal care and gain
appropriate weight and more likely to smoke during pregnancy than pregnant women
aged &gt;20 years. These factors are associated with poor birth outcomes. For
example, infants born to mothers who smoke during pregnancy are 65% more likely
to have low birthweight and 70% more likely to die in infancy than infants born
to nonsmokers. In 2004, the overall U.S. birth rate for mothers aged 15--19 years

<p><strong> Cesarean Delivery on Maternal Request </strong></p>
<p> It was in June of last year when I last wrote about the NIH Consensus conference
on Cesarean Delivery on Maternal Request (CDMR). Over the past year there has
been several articles written on the subject. The most recent of which is published
in the New England Journal of Medicine by Ecker and Frigoletto (excerpted below).</p>
<p> Here at Hasting&rsquo;s Indian Medical Center, we are beginning to explore
this issue through journal clubs and dialogue. We have had more patients recently
requesting Cesarean Delivery over the past year. A review of the NIH Consensus
conference points out that most of the evidence is weak or non-existent to support
planned vaginal or cesarean delivery. Moderate quality evidence is available
for only three outcome variables (postpartum hemorrhage, maternal length of stay,
and neonatal respiratory morbidity). .</p>
<p> ACOG sent out a news release on May
9, 2006 after the NIH consensus conference. In it they point out that more research
is needed and that CDMR is not recommended for women planning on having several
children due to the risks of placenta previa and placenta accreta increasing
with each cesarean delivery. In addition, Dr. Zinberg, Deputy Executive Vice
President of ACOG states &ldquo;ACOG continues to review all of the issues surrounding
maternal-request cesarean, but at this time our position is that cesareans should
be performed for medical reasons.&rdquo;</p>
<p> A number of the articles written have pointed out ACOG&rsquo;s position that
a cesarean delivery on maternal request can be ethically justified at times.
In ACOG&rsquo;s &ldquo;Surgery and Patient Choice: The Ethics of Decision Making,&rdquo; ACOG
states that &ldquo;In the absence of significant data on the risks and benefits
of cesarean delivery, the burden of proof should fall on those who are advocates
for a change in policy in support of elective cesarean delivery (ie, the replacement
of a natural process with a major surgical procedure.&rdquo;</p>
<p> As many of the articles and editorials written over the past year have pointed
out, caution should be used when a patient requests a cesarean delivery. Moving
slowly in the absence of good evidence is a prudent option. While support for
a women&rsquo;s choice is without question of paramount importance, performing
cesarean deliveries on maternal request may ultimately lead to a violation of
the Hippocratic Oath to do no harm.</p>
<h4> OB/GYN CCC Editorial comment: </h4>
<p><strong> Looking for sanity in the ever increasing cesarean delivery rate </strong></p>
<p> Ecker and Frigoletto state the key question centers on both the number needed
to treat to avoid one adverse neonatal outcome and the level of risk that is
currently considered acceptable. As practicing obstetricians, we find that the
risk that women are now willing to assume in exchange for a measure of potential
benefit, especially for the neonate, has changed: for many, the level of risk
of an adverse outcome that was tolerated in the past to avoid cesarean delivery
is no longer acceptable, and the threshold number needed to treat has thus been
reset.</p>
<p> In the face of the resulting continued increase in cesarean deliveries, our
obligation as providers is to educate patients about the trade-offs entailed
in choosing a particular course or intervention and to ensure that their choices
are congruent with their own philosophy, plans, and tolerance of risk. In areas
in which there is still uncertainty, we must organize clinical trials that will
produce the data we require for counseling patients. For the moment, however,
few of the relevant factors seem likely to change, and the cesarean rate can
be predicted to continue its climb.</p>
<p> The March 2006 National Institutes of Health (NIH) State-of-the-Science Conference
report concluded that there was a need for research that explicitly compared
outcomes of planned cesarean delivery with outcomes of planned vaginal delivery.
Declercq et al examines 6 years of data from a population-based linked data system
to create a refined measure identifying women with planned cesareans and planned
vaginal births and comparing maternal outcomes and costs associated with these
two options. </p>
<p> 1.) planned cesarean increases complications and re-hospitalizations and </p>
<p> 2.) planned cesarean increases cost</p>
<p> Declercq et al document a small, but consistent growth in planned primary
cesareans, but higher costs, longer hospital stays, and substantially greater
risks of maternal re-hospitalization associated with these deliveries. </p>
<p> The authors found that </p>
<p> * The rate of re-admission to a hospital (per 1,000) within 1 month of delivery
for planned vaginal births was significantly lower than that for planned primary
cesarean births (7.5 vs. 19.2). Adjusting for age, race or ethnicity, and parity,
a woman who had a planned primary cesarean birth was 2.3 times as likely as a
woman who had a planned vaginal birth to be re-admitted in the first month after
the birth. </p>
<p> * The leading reason for re-admission associated with planned primary cesarean
births in the first 30 days after birth was surgical wound complications. Postpartum
infections were a major cause of re-admission for both groups, with the rate
of re-admission for infection after planned primary cesarean births almost twice
as high as that of infection after planned vaginal births. </p>
<p> * The average initial maternal (excluding infant) hospital costs in 2003
dollars for a planned primary cesarean birth were 76% higher than the average
initial costs for a planned vaginal birth ($4,372 vs. $2,487). </p>
<p> * Women who had a planned primary cesarean birth averaged 4.3 days in their
initial stay and 4.4 days in cases of re-admission, compared with </p>
<p> 2.4 and 3.9 days, respectively, for those with a planned vaginal birth. </p>
<p> * Costs associated with a planned primary cesarean birth, compared with costs
associated with a planned vaginal birth, were higher for both delivery (65%)
and postpartum re-admission (11%).</p>

R</a>, et al just reported that after the first cesarean, the risks increase

risks for adverse obstetric and perinatal outcomes in the subsequent birth. However,
some risks may be due to confounding factors related to the indication for the
first cesarean.</p>
<p> Dr. Woitte reminds us to do no harm. Declercq et al and <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&cmd=Search&itool=pubmed_AbstractPlus&term=%22Kennare+R%22%5BAuthor%5D"> Kennare
R</a>, et al findings suggest that planned primary cesareans are not without
immediate health consequences for mothers and financial implications for society.
Clinicians should be aware of the increased risk for maternal re-hospitalization
after cesarean deliveries to low-risk mothers when counseling women about their
choices.</p>

<p><strong> Bisphosphonate Related Osteonecrosis of the Jaws (BRONJ) </strong></p>
<p><strong> Again with the Phossy Jaw? </strong></p>
<p> M. Winkler DDS, MS and K. Martin DDS </p>
<p> In the mid 1800s, English matchstick factory workers started presenting with
horrific jaw bone exposures and infections which led to disfigurements and sometimes
death. This was before the advent of antibiotics and most of these patients received
copper and surgery for their plight &ndash; with less than desirable results.
Eventually, this disease process became linked to the white phosphorus used in
the matchstick making industry.(Hellstein)</p>
<p> Currently, oral and maxillofacial surgeons and dentists are seeing a revival
of this type of presentation from IV and oral bisphosphonate drugs. Our current
pathogenesis has only been linked to drugs which contain nitrogen side chains:
zolendronic acid, pamidronate, risedronate, ibandronate, and alendronate. Rates
are now reported to be 6-7% with Zolendronic acid, 4+% with Pamidronate, and &lt;1%
with Alendronate. Early inconsistencies in terminology and diagnosis have probably
led to a lower report of the actual incidence. Another compounding factor is
current literature remains at level 3 studies only. We lack any randomized controlled
trials/prospective studies. Consequently, our understanding of pathogenesis,
progression, treatment, and identification of risk factors (steroid therapy,
hormone replacement, age, clinical and radiographic presentation) is sorely lacking.
Reports of this type of osteonecrosis are significantly increasing. The two major
initial case reports on BRONJ in 2003 and 2004 have more than doubled their original
number of patients.(Marx and Ruggiero)</p>
<p> Pathogenesis of this disease has not yet been identified, but the preponderance
of evidence and response to treatments suggests a metabolic origin rather than
vascular etiology. Especially considering hyperbaric oxygen treatments are not
effective in treating this disease (unlike patients with osteoradionecrosis or
osteomyelitis). These drugs are diffused through out the jaws and not just a
focal area like osteomyelitis or a slightly larger area like osteoradionecrosis.
There is NO such thing as debriding until we find healthy bone. This type of
osteonecrosis (consider the bisphosphonate bone response like osteopetrosis)
has only been shown in the jaws with one exception involving the auditory canal
in a patient with maxillary BRONJ.(Polizzotto) It is believed this is due to
the well vascularized jaw structures and significantly higher bone turnover of
the jaws compared to the long bones, especially in areas of tooth extractions/implant.
(Hughes et al., Rogers et al., Rodan et al., Stepan et al., Strewler) Couple
this with the unique anatomy of the oral environment: significant bony prominences,
exceptionally thin mucosa tissue covering (&lt;1mm in some areas), and constant
exposure to trauma (eating, habits, etc.) &hellip;And yes, a potato chip can
do you in!</p>
<p> Please realize bisphosphonates are phenomenal drugs and have been and will
continue to be a keystone treatment for osteoporosis and certain malignancies,
but for people with bad habits, in particular bristle allergies, these drugs
pose exponentially more </p>
<p> problems. This is where bad habits catch up to people. Studies have shown &gt;80%
of inciting events (induction of osteonecrosis) have been linked to previous
dentoalveolar surgeries, e.g., extractions, etc.(Durie et al) SO, if you have
patients in their 50s who still are not orally stable (poor-fair oral hygiene)
and require treatments like extractions &ndash; this is exactly the type of patient
whose bad habits will be a factor. There are spontaneous inductions noted in
both IV and oral bisphosphonates, but the incidence is significantly higher in
IV forms compared to orals. BRONJ appears to be potency related with zolendronic
acid the highest in vitro potency and alendronate the lowest.(O&rsquo;connell)
Usually the incidence begins after 2-3 years of use with these drugs.(Durie et
al.) Realize the risk of BRONJ increases with time. With the long half lives
of these drugs (alendronate, the weakest drug, is greater than 10 years) the
incidence of osteonecrosis is unlikely to decrease with time, even if the drug(s)
have been discontinued. Bottomline for bisphosphonates: if you need it, YA NEED
IT!</p>
<p> Some general treatment recommendations include: </p>
<p> PATIENT EDUCATION! Stress what to look for and regular dental care </p>
<p> Discussion with patients: risks, benefits, and options </p>
<p> Visual Inspection of oral cavity by ALL providers at each visit, note key
areas </p>
<p> Routine dental exams &ndash; yes, I realize access to care is a problem </p>
<p> An ounce of prevention is truly worth more than a pound of jaw bone</p>
<p> Hopefully as more information is elucidated and patient education grows we
will better tailor our bisphosphonate therapies (nitrogen vs. non-nitrogen side
chain drugs, loading vs. maintenance dosing, drug holidays?) and prevent what
can be an exceedingly frustrating and unrewarding disease to manage.</p>

<p><strong> What is the best management plan for the woman with suspected preterm
labor? </strong></p>
<p> As is well known, the incidence of preterm birth (PTB) is increasing in the
United States, and is currently approaching 13% of all births. Of importance
to us, the incidence of PTB in Native American women is actually slightly higher
than that of the general population. So, when one of our clients comes in with
preterm contractions, and may be in true preterm labor, what is the best management
plan for her?</p>
<p> First, I&rsquo;d like to review a few salient points about deciding if this
is the real thing. Is she really in true preterm labor and at risk of an imminent
preterm birth? It&rsquo;s often not that easy to decide. The <strong>fetal fibronectin
test (fFN</strong>), while not the greatest test in our armamentarium, may be
quite helpful as a triage tool. If your patient must be transferred a long distance
for tertiary care, the fFN is quite cost-effective, and will pay for itself many
times over compared to a costly transport and hospitalization. The negative predictive
value of the fFN approaches 98%. If the test is negative, it is very unlikely
that this woman with preterm contractions is actually going to deliver in the
next 7-14 days. The positive predictive value of the test is not so great, only
12-15%, but it does &ldquo;up the ante&rdquo;, and make you more likely to consider
transport.</p>
<p> The fFN only requires a 15 second sample taken from the posterior fornix,
and the currently available rapid test will provide an answer in less than 2
hours. Remember, blood, amniotic fluid, semen, and lubricant gel, will all make
the test positive, so it will not be helpful to you in those situations. <strong>Remember
to collect the fFN before you do your digital exam!</strong> If you find that
there is advanced cervical dilation, you can toss the sample. However, if, as
is common, there are contractions, but minimal cervical change, the test can
be quite helpful in your decision-making and management.</p>
<p> Another helpful maneuver to decide if the woman who has preterm contractions,
but an unimpressive cervical exam, is actually in true preterm labor, is to do <strong>&ldquo;one-shot
terbutaline triage&rdquo;</strong>. While beta agonists like terbutaline are
not currently thought to have a satisfactory risk-benefit profile to qualify
them as primary agents for tocolysis, they may be helpful to sort out the clinical
picture just described. A single subcutaneous injection of terbutaline 0.25 mg
will usually ameliorate preterm contractions in women not destined to actually
deliver early. Contrary to widespread opinion, <strong>intravenous fluid boluses
are NOT effective at stopping preterm contractions,</strong> and may be dangerous
if given too energetically.</p>
<p> So, let&rsquo;s say that despite the single shot terbutaline, your client
has persistent contractions, and her cervix has gone from fingertip to 1-2 cm
over 2 hours of observation. Her fFN returns positive. You decide this is the
real thing, and make plans for hospitalization or transport. What tocolytic agent
is best for her? Actually, none of the currently available tocolytics are ideal.
Likewise, none of the available tocolytic agents are FDA approved for this indication,
they are currently all &ldquo;off-label&rdquo; use. Their main purpose at this
time is to try to buy 48 hours for the administration of <strong>corticosteroids
for fetal lung maturation</strong>. So, if you think this is real preterm labor
and that this fetus is at considerable risk of PTB, your first maneuver should
be to start steroids. Betamethasone 12 mg intramuscularly for 2 doses at 24 hour
intervals (over 48 hours) is probably the best choice. If not available, dexamethasone
6mg intramuscularly every 12 hours x4 doses (over 48 hours) is also fine. <strong>Steroids
are probably the most important, and most evidence-based, intervention at this
time as regards improving ultimate perinatal outcome. </strong></p>
<p> Is antibiotic therapy appropriate for this patient? There is no evidence
that antibiotics are of any benefit for idiopathic preterm labor (i.e., no evidence
of overt chorioamnionitis or urinary tract infection). In the situation of preterm
premature rupture of membranes without labor however, antibiotics are appropriate,
but I won&acute;t discuss that situation here. However, antibiotics are indicated
in idiopathic preterm labor as <strong>prophylaxis for group B streptococcus
(GBS)</strong> carriage. When you collect your fFN, you should also take a rectovaginal
culture for GBS and begin empiric treatment with penicillin or ampicillin (or
cefazolin or clindamycin if there is a history of penicillin allergy). This should
be continued for 48 hours until the culture is back. Antibiotics may be stopped
if the culture is negative or if labor has stopped.</p>
<p> In order to allow time for steroids, which tocolytic is best? As noted above, <strong>beta
agonists</strong>, such as terbutaline and ritodrine (the latter no longer manufactured),
when used at the doses needed to stop contractions, have prominent cardiovascular
side effects. They carry a significant risk of pulmonary edema, especially combined
with over vigorous intravenous hydration. <strong>Beta agonists can no longer
be recommended as first line tocolytic agents.</strong></p>
<p> Likewise, despite overwhelming evidence of its lack of efficacy,<strong> magnesium
sulfate</strong> (MgSO4) tocolysis remains a North American anomaly. Cochrane
reviews have found it to be an ineffective tocolytic (no significant benefit
in preventing preterm birth compared to placebo). Moreover, the risk of total
pediatric mortality was significantly higher for infants exposed to MgSO4 (RR
= 2.8, CI 1.2-6.6). It also has quite unpleasant maternal side effects and requires
an intravenous drip that is cumbersome during transport. <strong>MgSO4 should
no longer be used as a tocolytic.</strong></p>
<p> How about another calcium channel blocker such as <strong>nifedipine</strong>,
the popular anti-hypertensive? Several meta-analyses have found them to be superior
to beta agonists, and considerably safer. Unfortunately, none of the individual
randomized are sufficiently powered (the largest had only 95 patients enrolled),
and none of them compared nifedipine to placebo or no treatment.</p>
<p> Calcium channel blockers achieve tocolysis by blocking myometrial L-type
voltage dependent calcium channels. They also block them in vascular smooth muscle
and myocardium. They have been associated with headache, flushing, hypotension,
secondary fetal distress, pulmonary edema (especially in combination with beta
agonists), and myocardial infarction These adverse effects were most prominent
in women with multiple gestation, preterm labor associated with infection, and
women with underlying cardiovascular disease.</p>
<p> Dosage regimens have not been standardized, and are based on regimens designed
to treat hypertension. A reasonable protocol would be to give 20 mg orally initially,
and repeat in 30 minutes if no effect. Thereafter, 20 mg orally every 6 hours
for 48 hours (maximum dose 160 mg) may be given. Maintenance tocolysis with the
extended release forms of the drug have been shown to neither decrease the recurrence
of preterm labor, nor improve perinatal outcomes. <strong>I would consider nifedipine
to be a second line tocolytic agent.</strong></p>
<p> The next agents available are the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents,
of which <strong>indomethacin</strong> is the best studied. These agents are
cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors and block prostaglandin synthesis in the myometrium.
The randomized controlled trials also lack power, but those available demonstrate
efficacy compared to placebo. Indomethacin is essentially free of maternal side
effects. Several retrospective reports from the early 1990&rsquo;s called attention
to an increased incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis, intraventricular hemorrhage,
constriction of the ductus arteriosus, and oligohydramnios in infants treated
in utero with this agent. These adverse effects became non-significant however
when multivariate analysis corrected for gestational age, and have not been found
to be significant in the prospective studies. NSAIDs do constrict the ductus,
especially in fetuses over 32 weeks, but this effect is reversed when the drug
is stopped, and is uncommon when administration is limited to 48 hours. A cost-benefit
analysis has clearly demonstrated an improvement in perinatal outcomes with use
versus non-use of indomethacin. The regimen recommended is a loading dose of
100 mg orally, followed by 50 mg orally every 6 hours, not to exceed 400 mg in
48 hours. <strong>Based on the evidence for its safety and efficacy, I would
consider indomethacin to be the best first line tocolytic agent.</strong></p>
<p> Another drug in this class is <strong>ketorolac</strong>, which we have found
to be very effective in our population. We use an initial dose of 30 mg intravenously
or intramuscularly, and then give 30 mg IV every 6 hours over 48 hours, not to
exceed 240 mg. Because it is given parenterally, its effect is usually immediate,
probably contributing to our seeing a high success rate with its use. We have
seen one case of significant oligohydramnios, and one case of maternal oliguria
(in a woman with chronic hypertension and mildly increased creatinine), both
of which resolved without sequelae after stopping therapy. There is only one
published study of this agent that I was able to find; it involved 88 women and
compared ketorolac to MgSO4 (where it was superior). At this time its use cannot
be considered an evidence-based recommendation.</p>
<p><strong> In conclusion,</strong> as long as the etiology of &ldquo;idiopathic&rdquo; preterm
remains cryptic, we are reduced to using interventions that are suboptimal. Nevertheless,
attempts at an accurate diagnosis, use of steroids when indicated, and use of
indomethacin or nifedipine as our &ldquo;best bet&rdquo; tocolytics, will hopefully
be the most efficacious way to help us reduce the incidence of preterm birth
and poor perinatal outcomes in our population. </p>

<p><strong> Concern about women taking bromocriptine long term for hyperprolactinemia? </strong></p>
<p> CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of clinically important valve regurgitation was
significantly increased in patients taking pergolide or cabergoline, but not
in patients taking non-ergot-derived dopamine agonists, as compared with control
subjects. These findings should be considered in evaluating the risk-benefit
ratio of treatment with ergot derivatives </p>

<h4> OB/GYN CCC Editorial comment: </h4>
<p><strong> Keep this one in the back of your mind </strong></p>
<p> The valvular heart disease and pulmonary and&nbsp;retroperitoneal fibrosis
seem to be a class effect of the ergot-derived dopamine agonists (these are bromocriptine,
cabergoline, and pergolide but not pramipexole or ropinirole which are not ergot-derived.)&nbsp; In
reality, this seems to&nbsp;occur with higher doses of cabergoline, but is sometimes
used for prolactinomas, especially in lower doses. These issues have not yet
been seen with the doses of bromocriptine that we generally use for prolactinoma,
however, we should stay tuned about this.</p>
<p><strong> Results caution against a repeat dose of glucocorticoid in high-risk
pregnancies </strong></p>
<p> RESULTS: A total of 249 mothers had been enrolled by the time the study was
discontinued. All of the 159 infants in the betamethasone group and 167 in the
placebo group were born before 36 weeks of gestation. The intact survival rate
was unaffected and was lower than anticipated, because the gestational age-adjusted
incidence of respiratory distress syndrome was higher than the population incidence.
The requirement for surfactant therapy in respiratory distress syndrome was increased
in the betamethasone group. According to posthoc analysis of the data for 206
infants who were delivered within 1 to 24 hours, the betamethasone booster tended
to increase the risk of respiratory distress syndrome and to decrease intact
survival rates </p>
<p> CONCLUSIONS: According to this study, a single booster dose of betamethasone
just before preterm birth may perturb respiratory adaptation. These results caution
against uncontrolled use of a repeat dose of glucocorticoid in high-risk pregnancies </p>

<p><strong> Local anesthesia before amniocentesis does not decrease maternal
pain perception </strong></p>
<p> RESULTS: Two hundred four women were enrolled; 101 women received local,
102 women received no local, and 1 woman declined the amniocentesis after randomization.
There was no difference in pain perception between the 2 groups as measured by
either the visual analogue scale or the numeric rating scale (P = .28 and .18
respectively). The correlation coefficient between the 2 pain scales was strong
with 0.86 for the local group and 0.92 for the no local group, (P &lt; .001). </p>

<p><strong> No benefits have been found from the use of diuretics to prevent
pre-eclampsia </strong></p>
<p> AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence to draw reliable conclusions
about the effects of diuretics on prevention of pre-eclampsia and its complications.
However, from this review, no clear benefits have been found from the use of
diuretics to prevent pre-eclampsia. Taken together with the level of adverse
effects found, the use of diuretics for the prevention of pre-eclampsia and its
complications cannot be recommended. </p>

<p><strong> HPV Vaccine FAQs </strong></p>
<p><strong> Q. Some providers at our facility will not start the HPV vaccine series on
a young woman if she will turn 18 before the series can be completed. Is this
a common approach?</strong></p>
<p><strong> A.</strong> No, this doesn&rsquo;t make sense from a biologic, or
fiscal sense. The Vaccines for Children program covers up to age 19 (that is
THROUGH age 18 years and 364 days). (See link to the Vaccines for Children program,
below). Biologically, one or two doses are better than none. (See next question.)</p>
<p> After the patient loses her VFC eligibility, the vaccine is covered by Medicaid
up to 20-21 years old in most states. In addition, Merck has a Patient Assistance
Program (PAP) to provide vaccine to low income women. (More on PAP below.)<strong></strong> PAP
covers vaccine for women 19-26 years old who are less than ~200% of poverty.
None of our patients have been denied so far and it usually takes less than one
hour to hear back from Merck to get their approval.</p>
<p><strong> Q. Is there a certain amount of immunity a woman will get from even
one dose (like the hepatitis B vaccine)?</strong></p>
<p><strong> A.</strong> In general, it is not yet known how much protection girls/women
would get from receiving only one or two doses of the vaccine. For this reason,
it is very important that girls/women get all three doses of the vaccine if possible.</p>
<p> We have no information on the efficacy of a partial series. But as noted
above it is reasonable to assume that one or two doses will provide some protection,
although it may not be the same as with a complete 3-dose series.</p>
<p><strong> Q. Does the HPV vaccine need to be given on an exact schedule? If
this schedule is not followed, does the series have to be started over again?
What is the &quot;grace period&quot; the doses can be given in and still be effective?</strong></p>
<p><strong> A.</strong> The series absolutely does NOT need to be given exactly
on schedule. The second dose needs to follow the first by at least 4 weeks, and
the third needs to follow the second by at least 12 weeks. Extended intervals
do NOT require restarting the series. (See pp.14 from the Pink Book, below.)</p>
<p><strong> Q. How does the </strong><strong> Merck Vaccine Patient Assistance
Program (PAP)</strong><strong> work?</strong></p>
<p><strong> A.</strong> Briefly, the Merck PAP allows patients over age 19 years
old to obtain Gardasil free, if they meet certain income and insurance coverage
criteria. In general the income requirements are less than:</p>
<p> --$20,240 for individuals </p>
<p> --$27,380 for couples or </p>
<p> --$41,300 for a family of four</p>
<p> Different criteria exist for Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands,
and Guam. Merck recognizes that sometimes exceptions need to be made based on
a patient's individual circumstances. Individuals who do not meet these criteria
may still qualify for the vaccine program if the patient has special circumstances
of financial and medical hardship.</p>
<p> The applicant must apply from a facility that is not &rdquo;wholly owned
and operated by the government&rdquo;. Hence, all tribal and urban facilities
would qualify, plus those IHS facilities that receive additional funding other
than federal funding (e. g., grants, contracts, private funding).</p>
<p> If you are in doubt whether your facility qualifies, contact (800) 293-3881
between 8:00 AM&ndash;8:00 PM EST Monday &ndash; Friday. If your facility does
not qualify, the patient could apply from a different facility (e. g., private
or semi-governmental clinic).</p>
<p> The application process is very straightforward. To-date none of our patients
who have met the age criteria have been denied. We usually hear within the hour
if the application is approved, though it can sometimes take up to 4 hours. Fax
the completed application form* to (800) 528-2551</p>
<p> In general, the patient fills out the first page, the case manager fills
out the back page, and the provider signs it. The vaccine is replaced by Merck
to the dispensing pharmacy on a periodic basis (quarterly). The application process
needs to be repeated for each dose.</p>

<p><strong> Updated CDC Guidelines for the Treatment of STDs </strong></p>
<p> The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) updated its 2002 guidelines
for the treatment of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) after consultation
with professionals and a systematic review of the evidence. The updated guidelines
contain new approaches to patient-centered counseling, expanded discussions of
prevention screening for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other STDs, and
several diagnosis and treatment updates, discussed below. </p>
<p> The new guidelines cite further data on the effectiveness of azithromycin
for chlamydial infection during pregnancy, and azithromycin is the primary recommended
regimen for this indication. </p>

<p><strong> Encourage family communication first. IHS honors State laws and regulations </strong></p>
<p> Here is a common question: </p>
<p> I am seeking input regarding I.H.S. policy for parental consent when providing
pregnancy-related, STD, and family planning services to minors.&nbsp; I looked
it up on the I.H.S. Manual which seems to imply that state and local regulations
apply. &nbsp;<strong></strong> As a federal facility, are we bound by applicable
state law in these matters or does I.H.S. have a federal policy which supersedes
state law?</p>
<p> The first answer is always to encourage complete communication within the
family. In the meantime, yes, the IHS honors State laws and regulations, so we
keep the links below on our Indian Health MCH website.*</p>
