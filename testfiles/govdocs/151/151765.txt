The Magnitude of the Problem

Hispanic subgroups. More than 20 different coun-
tries of varied cultural, socioeconomic, and political
backgrounds are currently included in this category
of the U.S. population. Narrowing the gap in oral
health between Hispanic and non-Hispanic groups
will require improved data on health status, barriers
to access, and disease factors underlying differences
in oral health in these populations.

Asians, Native Hawaiians, and Other Pacific
Islanders

National data for the oral health of Asian, Native
Hawaiian, and other Pacific Islander (ANHPI) groups
that can be generalized to the U.S. population are not
available. Instead the profile of disease and health in
this category is only available through studies of spe-
cific states and locales. Among all ethnic groups in
California in 1993 and 1994, Asian and Pacific
Islander American (APIA) children in Head Start had
the highest prevalence of early childhood caries-20
percent compared to 14 percent for all Head Start
children (Pollick et al. 1997). These data are compa-
rable to other survey findings of 16 to 20 percent and
29 percent early childhood caries among APIA chil-
dren in Hawaii and California, respectively (Greer
unpublished, Louie et al. 1990).

A California study of 6- to 8-year-olds found dis-
parities in the oral health status of APIA children in
the state when compared to all children nationally.
Among the California APIA children, 7.I percent had
untreated dental caries, with a significant portion of
this group requiring urgent dental treatment. By
comparison, NHANES III data indicate that in 1988
94, 29 percent of children in the United States aged 6
to 8 years had untreated dental decay

There is variation in oral health status among
subgroups of ANHPI children. In a recent survey in
Hawaii, the prevalence of early childhood caries
among APIA children was 16 percent, ranging from a
low of 8 percent among Japanese children to a high
of 25 percent among Filipino children. The preva-
lence of untreated dental caries in 6- to 8-year-old
APIA children was 39 percent, which ranged from a
low of 16 percent among Japanese children to 40 per-
cent among Native Hawaiians, 48 percent among
Southeast Asians, and 62 percent among non-Native
Hawaiian Pacific Islanders (Greer 1999).

Oral cancer incidence and mortality rates for
APIAs are lower than those for white non-Hispanics
and African Americans. However, nasopharyngeal
cancer incidence and mortality rates among Chinese
and Vietnamese populations are many times higher
than other groups (Miller et al. 1996), and therefore
pose a unique health problem for these subgroups.

Until recent years, vital statistics and other
health-related data were virtually nonexistent for the
APIA population. Data for this group generally
appeared in the "other" category of national surveys,
and thus were not helpful in determining specific
population-based oral or general health needs. Little
national focus has been given to defining and meas-
uring the oral health problems and related health
care needs of the APIA population. These needs are
now highlighted in the 2010 Healthy People Oral
Health Objectives. A few statewide oral health data
exist for some APIA child populations, but no ethnic
subgroupings can be assessed. Again, this category of
the U.S. population is extremely heterogeneous. It is
estimated that 76 percent is from one of five ethnic
origins and that 74 percent in 1990 were foreign
born. More than 63 percent live in four states:
California, New York, Hawaii, and Texas. Con-
sequently, determining the reasons for variations in
oral health will require additional data.

American Indian/Alaska Native Populations
Data on the oral health of American Indians and
Alaska Natives (AVAN) are available through studies
conducted by the Indian Health Service (IHS)
(Niendorfs 1994). The AVAN people constitute
about 1 percent of the U.S. population, or an esti-
mated 2.5 million people in 2000. Little is known or
can be easily determined about the general or oral
health status of the 1 million AVAN people not
served by the IHS system. For this reason, with the
exception of overall death rates obtained from census
data, the statistics described in this section will be
limited to the 1.5 million AVAN served by the IHS.
By and large, this group represents AVAN people liv-
ing on or near reservations.

Preliminary analyses of the IHS-wide Oral Health
Status Survey of over 13,000 dental patients in 1999
revealed that some conditions have worsened and
some improved since an earlier survey conducted in
1991 (IHS 1994, 2000). Across the IHS service pop-
ulation there was a statistically significant increase in
caries among adults over 55 as measured by the
decayed, missing, and filled teeth index. The decayed
and filled tooth rate increased from 7.5 to 8.8 teeth,
with no change in the average number of missing
teeth for this age group.

Among AVAN children across the IHS, there was
a significant decline in caries in the permanent den-
tition and a significant increase in caries in the pri-
mary dentition. Among children aged 2 to 5 years,
the increase in decayed and filled primary teeth sur-
faces went from 8.6 to 11.4. In general, AVAN popu-
lations have much greater rates of dental caries and

periodontal disease in all age groups than the gener-
al U.S. population. AVAN children aged 2 to 4 years
have 5 times the rate of dental decay compared to all
children, and 6- to 8-year-old AVAN children have
about twice the rate of dental caries experience. Rates
for untreated decay in these age groups are 2 to 3
times higher than in the same age groups in the gen-
eral U.S. population. Periodontal disease in AVAN
adults is 2.5 times greater than in the general U.S.
population. High prevalence rates of diabetes among
AVAN populations are a significant contributing fac-
tor to this periodontal disease (IHS 2000).

Substantial unmet dental needs and quality of
life issues have also been identified in IHS surveys,
which included studies of representative AWAN com-
munities with regard to the effect of oral conditions
on well-being and quality of life (Chen et al. 1997).
(See Chapter 6 for a general discussion.) One third of
schoolchildren report missing school because of den-
tal pain. Twenty-five percent of schoolchildren avoid
laughing or smiling, and 20 percent avoid meeting
other people because of the way their teeth look. As
a consequence of dental pain, almost a quarter of the
adults are unable to chew hard foods, almost 20 per-
cent report difficulty sleeping, and 15 percent limit
their work and leisure activities. Three quarters of
the elderly experience dental symptoms, and half
perceive their dental health as poor or very poor and
are unable to chew hard food. Almost half the adults
avoid laughing, smiling, and conversation with oth-
ers because of the way their teeth look.      .
Again, the available data allow for obtaining a

picture only of the AVAN population residing on
reservations where services, including dental servic-
es, have been provided by the IHS or contracted to
tribes or urban AI/AN organizations. In 1989,
American Indians, residing in the current reservation
states had a median household income of $19,897.
Almost one third (31.6 percent) of AVANs lived
below the poverty level. For some groups, diabetes
and high rates of tobacco and alcohol use are preva-
lent and contribute to poor oral health.

Women's Health

Analysis of data from NHANES III indicates that
women have benefited from the trend in general
improvements in oral health that has been enjoyed
by the U.S. population overall. Many, but not all, sta-
tistical indicators show women to have improved
their oral health status as compared to men
(NHANES III, Redford 1993). Adult females are less
likely than males at each age group to have severe
periodontal disease as measured by periodontal loss

of attachment of 6 mm or more for any tooth. Both
black and white females (6.0 and 6.0 per 100,000)
have a substantially lower incidence rate of oral and
pharyngeal cancers compared to black and white
males, respectively (20.8 and 14.9 per 100,000). A
higher prevalence of females than males have oral-
facial pain, including pain from oral sores, jaw joints,
face/cheek, and burning mouth syndrome. However,
there are large areas for which information for either
sex, even at the descriptive level, is only partial or
nonexistent. Data gaps regarding craniofacial in-
juries, soft tissue pathologies, and salivary gland dys-
functions are notable examples.

Most oral diseases and conditions are complex
and represent the product of interactions between
genetic, socioeconomic, behavioral, environmental,
and general health influences (Chapters 3 and 5).
Multiple factors may act synergistically to place sub-
groups of women at higher levels of risk for oral dis-
eases. For example, the comparative longevity of
women, compromised physical status over time, and
the combined effects of multiple chronic conditions
often with multiple medications, can result in
increased risk of oral disease (Redford 1993). Many
women live in poverty, are not insured, and are the
sole head of their household. For these women,
obtaining needed oral health care may be difficult. In
addition, gender-role expectations of women may
also affect their interaction with dental care providers
and could affect treatment recommendations as well
(Redford 1993).

During the past decade, women's health has
emerged as a significant issue in the nation's health
agenda. The scientific community is beginning to
respond to this concern by studying and reporting
the effects of sex and gender differences on health
and disease management. Although most of the effort
has focused upon women, comparisons with men's
health have begun to elucidate sex- and gender-
specific differences.

Research has demonstrated sex and gender dif-
ferences in the response to kappa opioid analgesics
for the control of postoperative pain (Gear et al.
1996). These findings have heightened conjecture
about differences in the female and male nervous sys-
tems in response to pain stimuli. There are studies in
mice that suggest that there are sex-specific respons-
es to pain and analgesics (Mogil et al. 1996, 1997).
Taken together, these findings could help explain
why women report certain painful conditions more
than men; for example, temporomandibular joint
disorders, trigeminal neuralgia, migraine headaches,
and burning mouth syndrome (USDHHS 1999).

77


The Magnitude of the Problem

  Recent research has also demonstrated sex and
gender differences in taste perception. Women are
more likely than men to be "supertasters" of a bitter
compound known as 6-n-propylthyiouracil (PROP)
(Bartoshuk et al. 1994). PROP supertasters experi-
ence more intense tastes (particularly for bitter and
sweet>, a greater sensation of oral burning in
response to alcohol, and more intense sensations
from fats in food (Bartoshuk et al. 1994, 1996, Tepper
and Nurse 1997). PROP supertasters also have more
fungiform papillae on their tongues than medium
PROP tasters or those who cannot taste PROP at all.

ioral and environmental differences-to name a
few-decreases the utility of those data that are avail-
able. For example, women are reported to be more
inclined to self-care, to visit the dentist more often,
and to be more likely to report symptoms such as
pain. However, the effects of these behaviors on their
oral health status cannot be determined fully Figure

oral health.

and needs for periodontal disease treatment than the
general population, due, in part, to limitations in
individual understanding of and physical ability to
perform personal prevention practices or to obtain
needed services. There is a wide range of caries rates
among people with disabilities, but overall their rates
are higher than those of people without disabilities.
Much of the variation stems from where people
reside (e.g., in large institutions where services are
available versus in the community where services
must be secured from community practitioners).
Almost two thirds of community-based residential
facilities report that inadequate access to dental care
is a significant issue (Beck and Hunter 1985, White
et al. 1995, Waldman et al. 1998, Dwyer, Northern
Wisconsin Center for the Developmentally Disabled
unpublished data, 1996). Parents consistently report
dental care as one of the top needed services for their
children with disabilities regardless of age (Haveman
et al. 1997). Local studies of independent living cen-
ters reported that 24 to 30 percent of adults with
cerebral palsy, 14 percent with spinal cord injuries,
30 percent with head injuries, and 17 percent who
were deaf had dental problems (Arnett 1994). Results
from 1999 oral assessments of U.S. Special Olympics
athletes (all ages), based on an extremely conserva-
tive assessment protocol (without the use of x-rays,
mirrors, or explorers), and carried out by the Special
Olympics Special Smiles Program in 20 states, indi-
cate that 12.9 percent of the athletes reported some
form of oral pain, 39 percent demonstrated signs of
gingival infection. and nearly 25 percent had untreat-
ed decay (Special Olympics, Inc., unpublished data).
Note that this is a population that tends to be from
higher-income families.

The oral health problems of individuals with dis-
abilities are complex. These problems may be due to
underlying congenital anomalies as well as to inabil-
ity to receive the personal and professional health
care needed to maintain oral health. There are more
than 54 million individuals defined as disabled under
the Americans with Disabilities Act, including almost
a million children under age 6 and 4.5 million chil-
dren between 6 and 16 years of age. A greater per-
centage of males than females and of African
Americans than Hispanics and whites have disabili-
ties (Federal Interagency Forum 1997, Waldman et
al. 1999). Children with disabilities have chronic
physical, developmental, behavioral, and emotional
limitations, including mental retardation, autism,
attention deficit hyperactivity disorders, and cerebral
palsy. Also, children from families with incomes
below the poverty level are about one third more like-
ly than children in nonpoor families to have an exist-

The Magnitude of the Problem

ing special health care need. Similarly, children from
less educated households exhibit a higher likelihood
of a special health care need. Children in single-par-
ent families are about 40 percent more likely than
children from two-parent households to have special
health care needs (Newacheck et al. 1998).
Deinstitutionalization has resulted in highlighting
the problem these individuals have regarding access
to dental care as they move from childhood to adult-
hood. Availability of dental providers trained to serve
special needs populations and limited third-party
support for the delivery of complex services (see
Chapter 9) further complicate the issues entailed in
addressing the needs of this population.
Given the wide variability among groups with
disabilities, this review of oral health status and
needs is quite limited. More in-depth assessment and
analysis of the determinants of oral health status,
access to care, and the role of oral health in the over-
all quality of life and life expectancy of individuals
with disabilities are needed (see Chapter 10).

UTILIZATION OF PROFESSIONAL

CARE: WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT
THE RELATIONSHIP OF ORAL HEALTH
AND USE OF DENTAL SERVICES?

With few exceptions, maintenance of oral health
through a lifetime requires timely receipt of advice
for self-care, preventive therapies, early detection and
treatment of problems, and restoration of function.
Chapter 7 describes community-based and profes-
sional interventions that have played a significant
role in the improvement of oral health achieved over
the past 50 years; their full promise has not, howev-
er, been realized. Chapter 8 describes current and
emerging strategies for personal and provider
approaches to maintain and restore oral health, with
tooth-conserving approaches being employed more
and more frequently. As noted earlier, almost every-
one experiences oral diseases and conditions over
the course of a lifetime, and, unlike the common
cold, most diseases do not resolve over time.
Consequently, receipt of dental services complements
self-care as a critical factor in achieving and main-
taining good oral health.

Although certain counseling and screening serv-
ices provided by physicians are recommended (U.S.
Preventive Services Task Force 1996), data to indi-
cate how many persons receive such services or oral-
health-related recommendations from their physi-
cian are very limited. There are also no data on physi-
cian-based services for oral and craniofacial condi-
tions. The data that are available describe utilization

ORAL HEALTH IN AMERICA: A REPORT OF THE SURGEON GENERAL           79


The Magnitude of the Problem

of dental visits. Unfortunately, most of these data are
cross-sectional, describing the experience of the pop-
ulation in any given year, but providing little detail
about how patterns of care over time contribute to
oral health. Nevertheless, utilization of care is used as
a surrogate measure of an individual's or a popula-
tion`s capacity to maintain or improve health status.
An understanding of utilization of dental visits and
differences in such visits among age, racial/ethnic,
sex, and income groups is important in identifying
opportunities for improvement in oral health that
would follow from timely receipt of professional care.
Characteristics of groups with different levels of
dental care utilization suggest barriers to care as well
as factors that predispose or enable access to dental
care. Explanations for variation in utilization are
alluded to in the following section, and are discussed
in further detail in Chapter 10. More studies are
needed to understand the dimensions of disease and
the role of professional care and use of services. Also,
for oral health in particular, the contributions of all
health professions and the interdisciplinary nature of
care need to be emphasized.

Dental Care Utilization

Visiting a health care provider at least once per year
and the number of visits made within the past year
are used as indicators of an individual's ability to
access professional services. Dental care utilization
statistics are traditionally based on an individual's
reporting "at least one dental visit in the past year,"
although there are variations with shorter recall
intervals and different forms of the question.
Depending on the question and survey method,
annual dental care use estimates vary The 1996
Medical Expenditures Panel Survey (MEPS) esti-
mates that 43 percent of the U.S. population 2 years
and older had at least one dental visit that year
(MEPS 2000). Responding to a variation of a ques-
tion that had been asked in many previous surveys,
some 65.1 percent of the U.S. population 2 years and
older reported in 1997 that they had visited a dentist
in the preceding year (NCHS 1997b), up from 55.0
percent in 1983 (Bloom et al. 1992). The average
number of visits per person remains at about two per
year. Further research is needed to understand rea-
sons for variations in estimates from different survey
approaches, but differences among persons with dif-
ferent characteristics are quite similar regardless of
survey method.

Survey, reprinted in Healthy People 2010, indicate

or more, compared with 6.9 percent of those with 13
years or more of education. A larger proportion of
individuals without private dental insurance had not
had a dental visit in 5 years or more compared with
those with private dental insurance (14.2 versus 6.6
percent). Hispanic individuals have the lowest rate of
dental insurance coverage-29.0 percent, compared
with 32.4 percent for non-Hispanic blacks and 41.8
percent for non-Hispanic whites (U.S. Bureau of the
Census 1997).

Professional care is necessary for several critical
dental disease prevention measures, such as the
application of dental sealants. Unfortunately, dental
sealants are 3 times less likely to be found on the
teeth of Mexican American and African American
children than among white children aged 5 to 17
(Selwitz et al. 1996). Asian and Pacific Islander
American children in California also demonstrated a
low rate of sealant use (Pollick et al. 1997).

Variation by Oral Health Status
Utilization of dental care is associated with self-
reported health status, as shown in Table 4.5. Of
those who reported "excellent" or "very good"
health, 61.4 percent had had a dental visit within the
past year, compared with about 45.1 percent of those
reporting "fair" or "poor" health. Functional limita-

A study comparing individuals who had had a
dental visit in the past 12 months with those who had
not reported that dentate adults who had a recent
       visit were less likely to have
        untreated coronal and root caries,
       pulpal pathology, and retained
       tooth roots. They also were more
       likely to rate the general condition
       of their teeth and gums as excel-
       lent or very good (Drury and
         Redford 2000).

  Examination of NHANES III
data by low socioeconomic status
(SES) provides an additional per-
spective. In a recent analysis, SES
was measured by a composite
index based on educational attain-
ment and the ratio of annual fami-
ly income to the poverty threshold.
Among all adults, people with
lower SES scores were nearly 9
times more likely to be edentulous
than those with higher SES scores.
Among the dentate, those with
lower SES scores were 6 times
more likely to have coronal decay
and nearly 4 times less likely to
have visited a dentist in the past 12
months (Drury et al. 1999).

tions are also related to dental service utilization. Of
those who reported no physical limitations in activi-
ties, 58.5 percent reported a dental visit within the
past year, compared to 46.6 percent of those who
were unable to carry out their usual activities (Table
4.5) (Bloom et al. 1992).

Whether a person had natural teeth was strongly
associated with dental care utilization (Table 4.5).
Dentate persons were more than 4 times more likely
to report a dental visit within the past year than eden-
tulous people: 65.5 versus 14.3 percent. Over half
(55.2 percent) of those who were edentulous reported
that they had not had a dental visit in 5 years or more.
Recent analyses of data from NHANES III show
that adults 18 and older who reported a dental visit
in the past 12 months were nearly 9 times more like-
ly to be dentate and 4.4 times more likely to have a
complete dentition than adults who did not report
visiting a dentist within the preceding 12 months.
Dentate adults who reported a dental visit in the past
12 months were 3.1 times less likely to have untreat-
ed coronal decay and 1.5 times less likely to have
gingivitis than dentate adults who did not report a
recent dental visit (T. Drury, NIDCR, personal com-
munication, 1999).

Reasons for Nonutilization
Reasons for nonutilization of dental services are com-
plex. Principal reasons cited by respondents of all
ages (Bloom et al. 1992) are given in Table 4.6.
Slightly less than half of those reporting no dental
visit in the past year (46.8 percent) said that they per-
ceived having no dental problem. This perception
was the predominant response of individuals in all
demographic categories, except for those 65 and
older, who gave having no teeth as the predominant
reason. Younger individuals were more likely than
older to cite "no dental problem." Blacks were more
likely to report "no problems" (58.5 percent) as a rea-
son for no dental visit, compared to 44.3 percent of
whites (Bloom et al. 1992).

Having no teeth (14.3 percent) was the next
most frequently reported reason for no dental visit.
About half of the people 65 and older in the 1989
survey gave this as their reason for no dental visit-
39.2 percent of blacks compared to 51.2 percent of
whites.

The third most frequently cited reason was the
cost of care, mentioned by 13.7 percent of respon-
dents. Whites (14.3 percent) were more likely than
blacks (11.4 percent) to cite cost. Other surveys have
reported substantially higher percentages of individ-
uals indicating cost as a barrier, particularly those in
underserved or low-income areas (Bloom et al.
1992). The age group most sensitive to the cost of
care was 18- to 34-year-olds, 19.1 percent of whom
gave cost as the reason for no dental visit, Finally, a
small proportion of respondents (4.3 percent) report-
ed fear as a personal barrier to receipt of care.

Unmet Needs

Unmet health needs can be assessed in many ways.
Because oral diseases are common and do not resolve
over time in the absence of intervention, the lack of
dental visits is used as an indicator of unmet health
needs. In addition, the National Access to Care
Survey documented the extent of dental care that
individuals wanted but could not obtain ("wants") in
the total population and among various population
subgroups (Mueller et al. 1998). About 8.5 percent of
the U.S. population wanted, but did not obtain, den-
tal care in 1994 (Table 4.7). In contrast, only 5.6 per-
cent reported unmet medical or surgical care wants.
Adult women aged 19 to 64 reported the greatest
level of dental care wants; elderly people 65 and older
had the lowest level. Blacks, people in fair or poor
health or with one or more chronic conditions, and
people living in the South reported higher levels of
dental care wants than comparable groups. About

The Magnitude of the Problem

16.4 percent of those in households whose family
income was less than 150 percent of the poverty level
reported dental care wants. More than 22 percent of
the uninsured reported dental care wants. Insured
children with special health care needs were 4 times
more likely to report unmet need for dental care
(23.9 percent versus 6.1 percent) if they were unin-
sured than if they were insured, according to a recent
analysis of data from the National Health Interview
Survey (Newacheck et al. 2000).

Outcomes of Appropriate Levels of Access
and Utilization: An Example
The effects on health of a system of care with assured
access and positive expectations of care-seeking and
utilization behavior have been demonstrated by the
U.S. Department of Defense. There are currently over
1.4 million men and women on active duty in the
U.S. military. The population is predominantly male
(86 percent). The racial distribution is 68 percent
white, 20 percent black, 7 percent Hispanic, 3 per-
cent Asian, and 2 percent other groups. Slightly over
30 percent of active duty personnel are between the
ages of 20 and 24, and 91 percent are younger than
40. In 1997, 59 percent were married. Seventy-six
percent had a high school degree, and 19 percent
were college graduates.

Free dental care, one of the benefits provided to
active duty military personnel, eliminates one of the
significant barriers that has been identified as
limiting access to care for many in the civilian
population. In addition, military personnel are
required to receive a dental examination annually,
even if the individual perceives that he or she has "no
problem." Dental care is available to most military
personnel at their duty station, eliminating the need
to travel long distances. A comparison of the oral
health and utilization of dental care of the military
and civilian populations illustrates the impact of
elimination of these barriers to care on oral health,
even for persons from demographic groups that are
traditionally underserved.

In 1994 the Tri-Service Comprehensive Oral
Health Survey examined and administered question-
naires to 13,050 active duty military personnel using
a complex, weighted survey design to examine the
oral health status, dental treatment needs, dental uti-
lization, and perceived need for care in this popula-
tion (York et al. 1995). The study found that nearly
all (99.2 percent) active duty military personnel had
seen a dentist within the past 2 years. Eighty percent
of active duty personnel received a dental examina-
tion within the past year, 60 percent had a dental

prophylaxis, and 29 percent had at
least one tooth filled.
Edentulism is virtually nonex-
istent in the active duty military
population. Also, active duty mili-
tary personnel have a significantly
lower proportion of their decayed,
missing, and filled surfaces that are
untreated; this is primarily due to
dramatic improvements in the oral
health of active duty blacks when
compared to their civilian counter-
parts. Active duty whites also have
somewhat better oral health than
white civilians of a similar age.
The relative proportion of un-
filled surfaces as a component of
decayed and filled tooth surfaces
in the military and civilian popula-
tions is illustrated in Figure 4.25.

ORAL HEALTH STATUS IN
CHANGING TIMES
The burden of oral diseases and
conditions in the United States is
extensive and affects persons
throughout their life span. Birth
defects such as cleft lip/palate,
dental caries, and facial trauma are
common in the young. Periodontal
diseases, autoimmune disorders,
and other chronic disabling condi-
tions are seen in adults, while
complete tooth loss and oral cavity
and pharyngeal cancers are seen
more often in older Americans.
Because the most common oral
disease, dental caries, is so wide-
spread in the population, nearly
every American has experienced
oral disease.

The effects of oral diseases and
conditions on quality of life and
well-being  are discussed in
Chapter 6. In sum, conditions
such as cleft lip and palate and oral
cancer not only involve costly and
difficult surgeries and treatments,
they also alter facial appearance
and impair oral functioning. Pain
disorders and pain as a conse-
quence of dental disease are preva-
lent in certain groups and can
affect daily living.

ORAL HEALTH IN AMERICA: A REPORT OF THE SURGEON GENERAL

87


The Magnitudt of the Problctn

The available trend data reveal improvements in
dental health for most Americans; however, despite
improvements in dental status, disparities remain.
Diseases disproportionately affect some sex, income,
and racial/ethnic groups, and the magnitude of the
differences is striking. All the reasons for these dis-
parities are not clear. Some of the most common den-
tal diseases, such as dental caries, are preventable
(prevention of oral diseases and conditions is pre-
sented in Chapters 8 and 9). It appears, however, that
not all individuals are benefiting from interventions
that involve professional care, as represented by the
data on dental visits. At the same time, as presented
in Chapter 7, about 40 percent of the public does not
receive the benefits of community water fluoridation.
The emerging data on the effects of socioeconomic
status on oral health are beginning to explain some,
but not all, racial/ethnic differences. For other dis-
eases, health disparities appear not to be related to
professional services; a better understanding of the
reasons for these differences is needed.

  This review of available data on oral diseases and
conditions also reveals the lack or limitation of
national or state data on oral diseases for many pop-
ulation subgroups and for many conditions that
affect the craniofacial structures. Information on the
variables needed to explain health status differences,
such as detailed utilization and expenditure data and
data on services rendered, is limited as well. Data on
specific services-self-care, services provided by pro-
fessionals, and services that are commuhity-based-
are needed to understand the dimensions of oral
health. (Some of these services are described in
Chapters 7 and 8.) Although some data on expendi-
tures for care and health care personnel are available

  Available state data reveal variations within and
among states in patterns of oral health and disease
among population groups. Having state-specific and
local data that augment national data is critical in
identifying high-risk populations and areas and in
addressing health disparities. These data also are vital
in program evaluation, planning, and policy deci-
sions. Yet state and local data are almost nonexistent.
In recent years, the need for state and local data has
intensified as more programs are funded by local
authorities and responsibilities are shifted from
national to state-based levels.
The nation's health information system is under-
going constant change to meet the current and future
needs for health information. Consequently, many
factors influence how and what data are collected and
analyzed. These factors include emerging technolo-
gies, legislation about how data are to be collected,
and confidentiality and privacy concerns.
The need for epidemiologic and surveillance data
change as the understanding of specific diseases and
conditions evolves and as society's goals and priori-
ties change. The increasing focus on the long-term
benefits of disease prevention and health promotion
and the need to close the gap on disparities also
affects how and what data are collected. For example,
major initiatives such as the Department of Health
and Human Services's Healthy People 2010 have pro-
vided a framework for data collection and analysis
tied to specific objectives and have helped identify
        needs for new health data systems.
       The Healthy People initiative now
       includes objectives for the nation's
       health status as well as for preven-
       tive interventions and objectives
       that would improve infrastructure
       and capacity building to provide
       the necessary services and moni-
        toring.

This overview of the magni-
tude of oral diseases and condi-
tions in America raises many ques-
tions still to be researched. If cer-
tain oral diseases are preventable,
why do we have populations with
extensive and untreated disease?
Once socioeconomic factors are
controlled, why do we see differ-
ences in services received? Why

38         ORAL HEALTH IN AMERICA: A REPORT OF THE SURGEON GENERAL


are some conditions more prevalent in certain popu-
lations than in others? How will the rapidly changing
and projected demographics of America contribute to
future trends in oral and craniofacial health and dis-
ease? These and many other questions require more
research, new databases, and an active and trained
group of researchers.

FINDINGS
   o  Over the past five decades, major improve-
ments in oral health have been seen nationally for
most Americans.
   o  Despite improvements in oral health status,
profound disparities remain in some population
groups as classified by sex, income, age, and race.feth-
nicity. For some diseases and conditions, the magni-
tude of the differences in oral health status among
population groups is striking.
   0  Oral diseases and conditions affect people
throughout their life span. Nearly every American
has experienced the most common oral disease, den-
tal caries.

   o  Conditions that severely affect the face and
facial expression, such as birth defects, craniofacial
injuries, and neoplastic diseases, are more common
in the very young and in the elderly
   o  Oral-facial pain can greatly reduce quality of
life and restrict major functions. Pain is a common
symptom for many of the conditions affecting oral-
facial structures.

   o  National and state data for many oral' and
craniofacial diseases and conditions and for popula-
tion groups are limited or nonexistent. Available state
data reveal variations within and among states in pat-
terns of health and disease among population groups.
   o  Research is needed to develop better meas-
ures of disease and health, to explain the differences
among population groups, and to develop interven-
tions targeted at eliminating disparities.

What Is the Relationship Between
Oral Health and General Health
and Well-being?

The next two chapters establish that oral health is essential to general health and well-being.
Chapter 5 examines multiple linkages between oral and general health. The mouth and the face
reflect signs and symptoms of health and disease that can serve as an adjunct for diagnosis for
some conditions. Diagnostic tests using oral cells and fluids-especially saliva-are available to
detect drug abuse, hormonal changes, and specific diseases; and more are being developed. The
mouth is also a portal of entry for pathogens and toxins, which can affect the mouth and, if not
cleared by the many defense mechanisms that have evolved to protect the oral cavity, may spread to
the rest of the body Recent epidemiologic and experimental animal research provides evidence of
possible associations between oral infections-particularly periodontal disease-and diabetes,
cardiovascular disease, and adverse pregnancy outcomes, and this evidence is reviewed. The review
highlights the need for an aggressive research agenda to better delineate the specific nature of these
associations and the underlying mechanisms of action.

Chapter 6 looks at the impact of oral health problems on the quality of life and includes
examples of the kinds of questionnaires used to measure oral-health-related quality of life. Oral
health is highly valued by society and individuals, and the chapter begins with a brief description
of the reflections of those values in myth and folklore concerning facial appearance and the
meaning of teeth. It then explores dimensions beyond the biological and the physical to examine
how oral diseases and disorders can interfere with the functions of daily living, including
participation in work or school, and what is known about their psychosocial impacts and economic
costs. The deleterious effects of facial disfigurement and tooth loss may be magnified in a society
such as ours that celebrates youth and beauty Self-reported impacts of oral conditions on social
functions include limitations in communication, social interactions, and intimacy. Research on the
oral-health-related quality of life is needed to permit further exploration of the dimensions of oral
health and well-being.

Linkages with General Health

The mouth and face are highly accessible parts of the
body, sensitive to and able to reflect changes
occurring internally. The mouth is the major portal of
entry to the body and is equipped with formidable
mechanisms for sensing the environment and
defending against toxins or invading pathogens. In
the event that the integrity of the oral tissues is
compromised, the mouth can become a source of
disease or pathological processes affecting other parts
of the body. It can also become a source of contagion
by means of contaminated fluids or materials passed
to others. This chapter explores what the mouth and
face can reveal about general health, describes the
role the mouth plays as a portal of entry for infection,
and concludes with studies that are associating oral
infections with serious systemic diseases and
conditions.

THE MOUTH AND FACE AS A MIRROR
OF HEALTH AND DISEASE
A physical examination of the mouth and face can
reveal signs of disease, drug use, domestic physical
abuse, harmful habits or addictions such as smoking,
and general health status. Imaging (e.g., x-ray, MRI,
SPECT) of the oral and craniofacial structures may
provide early signs of skeletal changes such as those
occurring with osteoporosis and musculoskeletal
disorders, and may also reveal salivary, congenital,
neoplastic, and developmental disorders. Oral cells
and fluids, especially saliva, can be tested for a wide
range of substances, and oral-based diagnostics are
increasingly being developed and used as a means to
assess health and disease without the limitations and
difficulties of obtaining blood and urine.

Physical Signs and Symptoms af Disease
and Risk Factors

A number of signs and symptoms of disease, lifestyle
behaviors, and exposure to toxins can be detected in
or around the craniofacial complex. Pathogens enter-
ing the mouth may proliferate locally with oral and
pharyngeal signs and symptoms; other pathogens
may enter the bloodstream directly or through lym-
phatic channels and cause generalized disease. Oral
signs suspected to be indications of systemic illness
may be confirmed by the presence of rash, fever,
headache, malaise, enlarged lymph nodes, or lesions
elsewhere on the body

Swollen parotid glands are a cardinal sign of
infection with the mumps virus and can also be seen
in individuals with Sjogren's syndrome and HIV The
salivary glands are also frequently involved in tuber-
culosis and histoplasmosis infections. Oral signs of
infectious mononucleosis, caused by Epstein-Barr
virus, include sore throat, gingival bleeding, and
multiple pinpoint-sized hemorrhagic spots (pettechi-
ae) on the oral mucosa. The oral signs and symptoms
associated with some viral, bacterial, and fungal
infections are listed in Table 5.1. There can be a large
overlap in the clinical appearance of oral manifesta-
tions of various diseases with different etiologies, and
the clinical diagnosis often involves ancillary proce-
dures, which may include laboratory tests, diagnostic
imaging, and biopsy.

Oral tissues may also reflect immune deficiency.
For example, nearly all HIV-infected individuals
develop oral lesions at some time during their illness
(Greenberg 1996, Greenspan and Greenspan 1996,
Phelan 1997). Other immunosuppressed individuals
may have the same lesions (Glick and Garfunkel
1992). However, the presentation and the extent, sev-
erity, and management of some of these lesions may
reflect nuances due to variation in the underlying

Clinical Features

Course

Dermatologic diseases

Mucous membrane
pemphigoid

Primarily mucous membranes
of the oral cavity, but may also
involve the eyes, urethra, vagi-
na,and rectum

Painful, grayish-white collapsed vesicles or bullae
with peripheral erythematous zone; gingival
lesions desquamate, leaving ulcerated area

Protracted course with remissions
and exacerbations; involvement of
different sites occurs slowly;glu-
cocorticoids may temporarily
reduce symptoms but do not
control the disease

Erythema multiforme
(Stevens-Johnson syndrome)




Pemphigus vulgaris

Primarily the oral mucosa and
skin of hands and feet






Oral mucosa and skin

Intraoral ruptured bullae surrounded by an
inflammatory area; lips may show hemorrhagic
crusts; the "iris," or "target" lesion, on the skin is
pathognomonic; patient may have severe signs of
toxicity
Ruptured bullae and ulcerated oral areas; mostly
in older adults

Onset very rapid; condition may
last 1 to 2 weeks; may be fatal;
acue episodes respond to
steroids


With repeated recurrence of bul-
lae, toxicity may lead to cachexia,
infection, and death within 2
years; often controllable with
steroids

Lichen planus




Other conditions

Oral mucosa and skin

White striae in mouth; purplish nodules on skin

systemic condition. For example, the linear gingival
erythema and necrotizing ulcerative periodontitis
sometimes seen in HIV infection have been difficult
to resolve with routine dental curettage and prophy-
laxis (Glick et al. 1994b).
The appearance  of soft or hard tissue
pigmentation is associated with a number of diseases
and treatments. Malignant melanoma can appear
in the mouth as brown or black flat or raised spots.
Kaposi's sarcoma can appear as a flat or raised pig-

mented lesion. Addison's disease causes blotches or
spots of bluish-black or dark brown pigmentation to
occur early in the disease. Congenital discrete brown
or black patches (nevi) can appear in any part of the
mouth. Pigmentation of the tooth crowns may be
seen in children with cystic fibrosis and porphyria
and those exposed to tetracycline during tooth
development.

  The oral tissues can also reflect nutritional status
and exposure to risk factors such as tobacco. The
