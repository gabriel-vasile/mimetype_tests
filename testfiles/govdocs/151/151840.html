<P>
<STRONG>6:19 A.M. EST</STRONG>
             
             
<P>
             MS. GLYNN:  As we reported earlier today, early this
morning the President fell.  He slipped coming down some steps at Greg
Norman's residence and actually popped his knee.  He twisted his knee
and he tore a tendon in his upper right thigh.  He said it was an
audible pop and it was kind of a strange situation.  He did not fall
down.
             
<P>
             It appears that he has torn a tendon in his knee.  And I've
got Dr. Connie Mariano here, who is going to help him.  She's his
personal physician.  Dr. Joel Cohen, who is an orthopedic surgeon here
at St. Mary's, can answer some more of your technical questions.
             
<P>
             The President will be returning to Washington early this
morning.  He's cancelled his events for today.  He is going to have
surgery at Bethesda Naval Hospital and will probably stay over the
weekend.
             
<P>
             Q    Will he go to the summit this week, Mary Ellen?
             
<P>
             MS. GLYNN:  I think it's premature, but he would love to
go.  The President, I should say, is up and alert and joking around and
resting comfortably.  He was sorry that he's going to miss the school
construction event here in Florida and very sorry he's going to miss
getting golf tips from Greg Norman.
             
<P>
             Q    Is it possible he won't go to the summit?
             
<P>
             MS. GLYNN:  I would not speculate on that at this point in
time.  I think it's way too early to say.
             
<P>
             Q  Mary Ellen, tore a tendon in the knee or the thigh.
             
<P>
             DR. MARIANO:  Let me clarify a couple of things that she
had mentioned.  About a little after 1:00 a.m. this morning the
President was walking out of the Norman residence talking with Greg
Norman, and he had gone down the steps and had caught his heel on one of
the steps.  And he remembers his right leg, his right knee buckling out.
He heard a very loud pop and felt some pain in his right leg -- at which
point our duty physician at the time, Dr. Bill Lang, examined him and
determined that he should be brought here to the hospital for
evaluation.
             
<P>
             We brought him here by ambulance.  Upon arrival he had X
rays of his right knee performed.  They were felt to be normal.  We
consulted Dr. Joel Cohen, who is the orthopedic surgeon here, and he
examined him as well, determined that it was wise to obtain an MRI of
his right knee area, and from the MRI obtained today, found that he has
a tear of the quadriceps tendon, the tendon from the upper thigh that
connects to the kneecap.
             
<P>
             And the plan today is to bring him back to Washington,
consult with the physicians at Bethesda Naval Hospital where most likely
he will undergo surgery today and if all goes well, anticipate being
discharged this weekend.
             
<P>
             Q    What do you call that tendon?
             
<P>
             DR. MARIANO:  Quadriceps tendon.
             
<P>
             Q    Is the President able to walk?
             
<P>
             DR. MARIANO:  He has to have -- he has a splint, actually a
posterior splint on him and he needs crutches right now.
             
<P>
             Q  Could you just summarize in terms of the average person
who is hearing this now --
             
<P>
             DR. MARIANO:  Dr. Cohen, do you want to -- 
             
<P>
             Q  -- and, you know, how serious it is -- if you could also
come to the mike -- how serious is this, and in terms of -- how
basically serious is this for the future or for him walking around, et
cetera.
             
<P>
             DR. COHEN:  His injury he should fully recover from.  It's
not an uncommon injury.  The repair is pretty straightforward and he's
going to have to go through some rehabilitation.  But the expectation
would be return to full activities.
             
<P>
             Q    What sort of rehabilitation?
             
<P>
             DR. COHEN:  After you have the surgery, you're held still
for a while and your muscles weaken, so you need to strengthen them back
up.  So he'll have to go through some physical therapy and strengthen
it.
             
<P>
             Q  Could you give us a time line -- how long would the
therapy be, how long before he's in A-1 condition?
             
<P>
             DR. COHEN:  You know, everybody's different, but usually
you immobilize them for a few weeks after the surgery and start the
physical therapy, and the recovery can be as quick as six weeks or as
long as three months.
             
<P>
             Q    What do you mean "immobilize"?
             
<P>
             DR. COHEN:  In a brace.
             
<P>
             Q  I don't quite understand.  So he will be wearing a brace
for some period of time?
             
<P>
             DR. COHEN:  After the surgery, correct.
             
<P>
             Q    Could you elaborate on that again?
             
<P>
             DR. COHEN:  Well, you need to protect the repair.  They're
going to sew the tendon back to his kneecap and in order to protect it
we use lightweight braces to hold your leg still so you don't move it
before we want you to.
             
<P>
             Q  Will he be on crutches the whole time he's on a brace?
             
<P>
             DR. COHEN:  A fair amount of that time just to protect the
repair.
             
<P>
             Q  So he'll be on crutches for weeks to come, possibly?
             
<P>
             DR. COHEN:  Possibly.
             
<P>
             Q  Doctor, this was caused by just taking a wrong step?
             
<P>
             DR. COHEN:  Yes, it's a deceleration injury.  He was coming
down some stairs; when you step down, that's when your quadriceps
function, and he stumbled and his quadriceps contracted very hard and it
literally pulled the tendon off the bone.
             
<P>
             Q    Is that painful?
             
<P>
             DR. COHEN:  Very painful.
             
<P>
             Q    Is he in pain now?
             
<P>
             DR. COHEN:  They gave him some non-narcotic pain medicine
and he seemed to get a lot of relief.
             
<P>
             Q    What's the name of the medicine?
             
<P>
             DR. MARIANO:  Toradol.  
             
<P>
             Q    And it does what?
             
<P>
             DR. COHEN:  It's an anti-inflammatory that has pain relief
with it.
             
<P>
             MS. GLYNN:  I should add, too, he's, as I say, joking and
laughing and he seems like he's in a pretty good humor.  He had asked
for a deck of cards so that he could play hearts.
             
<P>
             Q    Who is he playing with?
             
<P>
             MS. GLYNN:  He's playing hearts with Bruce Lindsey.
             
<P>
             Q  He will have to have a general anesthetic, will he not,
at Bethesda for the operation?
             
<P>
             DR. COHEN:  No, sir.  Generally, these days, we do that
surgery under regional anesthesia or an epidural block, where his leg
will go to sleep, but he himself is wide awake.
             
<P>
             Q  So he will have all of his faculties and so forth?
             
<P>
             DR. COHEN:  Absolutely.
             
<P>
             Q  Two questions.  First of all, I remember that he had
some troubles with a knee in the past -- it was reported in some of the
past medical --
             
<P>
             DR. COHEN:  He gave a history of 17-plus years ago having a
skiing injury where he had some ligamenta strain that he had no surgery
and recovered fully from it.
             
<P>
             Q    Same knee, Doctor?
             
<P>
             DR. COHEN:  Correct.
             
<P>
             Q    Do you know where the tear --
             
<P>
             Q    Wait, do you think it might have been related?
             
<P>
             DR. COHEN:  In no way.
             
<P>
             Q  And, secondly, this is kind of a delicate question, but
had the President had anything to drink tonight --
             
<P>
             DR. MARIANO:  No. We had just arrived from Miami on the
helicopter and he was visiting with them and was going into the guest
quarters when that happened.
             
<P>
             Q  Are you able to say how big a tear it is in the tendon?
             
<P>
             DR. COHEN:  I mean, it's greater than 50 percent.  That's
about the characterization from the radiologist.
             
<P>
             Q  Can you show us on your leg where we're talking about?
             
<P>
             DR. COHEN:  It's the tendon that attaches right above your
kneecap.
             
<P>
             Q  And it goes from where to where?  I don't understand.
             
<P>
             DR. COHEN:  It's called the quadriceps.  They're four
muscles in your upper thigh -- quad, four muscles, that come together,
form a tendon that envelops your kneecap and gives you the ability to
straighten your leg out.  And so it tears off the top of his kneecap.
             
<P>
             Q  Mary Ellen, given the fact that he'll probably just get
a local anesthesia or an epidural, is there any reason why the Vice
President might be called on to --
             
<P>
             MS. GLYNN: I don't know of any plans to do that at this
time.
             
<P>
             DR. MARIANO:  You're thinking the 25th.  He's in full
control of his faculties.  He'll be alert.  Should they decide to do the
epidural, he's awake during the procedure.  I would not --
             
<P>
             Q    Is it considered a major operation?
             
<P>
             DR. COHEN:  No.  I mean, it's not a minor operation, but
it's not a major operation.  It's technically not that difficult to do.
You literally drill some holes in your kneecap, put some suture through
the tendon an reattach it.
             
<P>
             Q    That sounds pretty major.
             
<P>
             DR. COHEN:  Well, again, compared to having a knee
replacement or something, it doesn't -- it's not that major.
             
<P>
             Q  Mary Ellen, who was the first person to come to his
assistance?  Do you know what --
             
<P>
             MS. GLYNN:  I believe it was Greg Norman.  That's what the
President told me.
             
<P>
             DR. MARIANO:  He helped him up -- held on to him.
             
<P>
             MS. GLYNN:  Grabbed him.
             
<P>
             Q  And then he went straight to an ambulance or he went
back to the residence for a while?
             
<P>
             DR. MARIANO:  No, the Secret Service called.  We have a
duty physician on the compound, Dr. William Lang, who is a family
physician.
             
<P>
             Q    Can you spell that?
             
<P>
             DR. MARIANO:  Lang.  And he responded right away and
examined him and determined that he needed to be brought here.
             
<P>
             Q    That's a military doctor or --
             
<P>
             DR. MARIANO:  Yes.  He's our Army physician.  
             
<P>
             Q  Other than just stumbling on the stairs, do we have any
further reasons as to why he stumbled?  Did he lose his balance --
             
<P>
             DR. MARIANO:  The steps were of an unusual nature.  He says
they were sort of irregularly shaped, and he caught his heel onto one of
the --
             
<P>
             Q    Were these outside?
             
<P>
             DR. MARIANO:  Coming out of the house.
             
<P>
             Q  He was leaving the Norman residence when that happened?
             
<P>
             DR. MARIANO:  Yes.
             
<P>
             Q  Doctor, this is not -- I take it this is not like a
microscopic or what they call -- you're going to have to cut into the
knee?
             
<P>
             DR. COHEN:  Yes.  You can't do it orthroscopically.
             
<P>
             Q  How common is this that just a missed step would result
in an injury like this?  Is this rare?
             
<P>
             DR. COHEN:  No.  I mean, it's pure biomechanics.  That is,
if you're stepping down and you slip and that quadriceps retracts, then
something's going to give.  And in this case, it was that tendon.
             
<P>
             Q  But it's not unusual for somebody simply walking to have
something this --
             
<P>
             DR. COHEN:  Well, it wasn't walking, it was coming down the
stairs.  That's where the forces were involved.
             
<P>
             Q  Right.  I want to get a sense of how unusual is it for
-- when coming down the stairs for something like that to happen.
             
<P>
             DR. COHEN:  You know, I would say in our practice we see a
few every year.
             
<P>
             Q  Can you explain that once again?  When he's stepping
down the steps, what is his muscle doing and how do the muscles leave
the kneecap?
             
<P>
             DR. COHEN:  Okay.  When you step down your quadriceps is
contracting.  That's what controls your deceleration.  And so if you
were to stumble at that point, those muscles which are now pulling very
hard can have forces applied to them that are abnormal.  And as a result
there was a pull in the opposite direction and something had to give,
and in this case, the tendon right up here gave way.
             
<P>
             Q  And the pull is because he's falling and the knee is
going down and --
             
<P>
             DR. COHEN:  It goes because he's stepping down.  That's the
initial -- the force -- and there's a tremendous, three times your body
weight is transmitted across your knee as you step down, so tremendous
force.  And then with a little stumble it's just -- given enough
circumstances, something gave.
             
<P>
             Q  And how big of an area is it that you're going to have
to sew back in, or how big of an area is it that the muscle has pulled
away from?
             
<P>
             DR. COHEN:  Well, you can feel your own kneecap.  I mean,
the area is probably the width there of your kneecap.
             
<P>
             Q  What was the President doing outside at that point?
             
<P>
             DR. MARIANO:  He was saying goodnight.
             
<P>
             MS. GLYNN:  He was going back to his own residence.  He is
staying with the Normans, in a different cottage.  And so he was leaving
Greg Norman's house, where he had been up chatting and talking to him
and thanking him for his hospitality.
             
<P>
             Q    What time?
             
<P>
             DR. MARIANO:  A little bit after 1:00 a.m.
             
<P>
             Q    Is he going straight from here to the hospital?
             
<P>
             MS. GLYNN:  He's going to go straight from here to the
airport, and from Andrews Airport, Andrews Air Force Base to Bethesda
Naval Hospital.
             
<P>
             Q  And, Doctor, could you just summarize one more time --
             
<P>
             Q  Maybe you can explain how you literally fix this?  I
understand that you drill-hole the kneecap and then run sutures from the
kneecap through the tendon?
             
<P>
             DR. COHEN:  Correct.
             
<P>
             Q  But the tendon is only a 50 percent tear, so are you, in
effect -- you're not repairing the tendon, you're actually building a
new tendon, in effect?
             
<P>
             DR. COHEN:  No, you're pulling the torn part down to the
kneecap where it attached.
             
<P>
             Q  Will the suture be running through the tendon or --
             
<P>
             DR. COHEN:  Sure.
             
<P>
             Q    -- from the tendon to the kneecap?
             
<P>
             DR. COHEN:  Right.
             
<P>
             Q  And on the rehabilitation, again, you suspect he will be
on crutches for how long?
             
<P>
             DR. COHEN:  Again, there's a variation.  But, initially in
the beginning period for a few weeks they're going to keep him on
crutches to protect it.
             
<P>
             Q  Could you be more specific than the next few weeks?
             
<P>
             DR. COHEN:  Everyone is different.  I would say two to
three weeks.
             
<P>
             Q  Two to three weeks on crutches?  And when does he begin
rehabilitation and what does that entail -- is that weight lifting, is
that running?
             
<P>
             DR. COHEN:  Initially you have him evaluated by a
registered physical therapist who will start him on range of motion and
then progress him to strengthening.
             
<P>
             Q    When does that start, the rehabilitation?
             
<P>
             DR. COHEN:  Again, the variation, I would say in the three
to six-week period.
             
<P>
             Q  Doctor, could you just one more time take what you've
said and summarize it for the average person who might be watching, just
now tuning in -- just overall how serious it is.  Just summarize it one
more time.
             
<P>
             DR. COHEN:  Well, the seriousness, again, it's a torn
tendon that needs to be repaired.  It's technically not that difficult
to repair it.  It requires some immobilization after you have it
repaired, and then some rehabilitation after that.
             
<P>
             Q  Doctor, what's it like to work on the President?
             
<P>
             DR. COHEN:  He was very nice, very cooperative.
             
<P>
             Q  Have you worked on people this important before?
             
<P>
             DR. COHEN:  I mean, they're all patients.
             
<P>
             MS. GLYNN:  All right.  Thanks, everyone.  We'll let the
doctors go back, they have work to do and they've been up for a while.
             
<P>
             Q  Have you all consulted with each other before coming
down --
             
<P>
             Q    Has the Vice President been informed?
             
<P>
             MS. GLYNN:  The Vice President has been informed.  The
Chief of Staff has been informed.  The First Lady has been informed.  At
this point in time, there's no plans for her to change her trip -- at
this point in time.
             
<P>
             THE PRESS:  Thank you.
