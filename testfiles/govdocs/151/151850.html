  <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1">Knee problems are very common, and they occur in people
  of all ages. This booklet contains general information about
  several knee problems. It includes descriptions and a diagram
  of the different parts of the knee. Individual sections of the
  booklet describe the symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment of
  specific types of knee injuries and conditions. Information on
  how to prevent these problems is also provided.</FONT></P>
	 <P><B><FONT COLOR="#AF0000" FACE="Verdana"><a name="what"></a>What Do the Knees Do? How Do They Work?</FONT></B></P> 
	 <p><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1">The knee is the joint where the bones of the upper leg meet
the bones of the lower leg, allowing hinge-like movement
while providing stability and strength to support the weight
of the body. Flexibility, strength, and stability are needed for
standing and for motions like walking, running, crouching,
jumping, and turning.</FONT></p>
	 <p><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1">Several kinds of supporting and moving parts, including
bones, cartilage, muscles, ligaments, and tendons, help the
knees do their job. (See Joint Basics, below.) Each of these
structures is subject to disease and injury. When a knee problem
affects your ability to do things, it can have a big impact
on your life. Knee problems can interfere with many things,
from participation in sports to simply getting up from a chair
and walking.</FONT></p>

    Muscles are connected to bones by tough cords of
    tissue called tendons. Muscles pull on tendons to move
    joints. While muscles are not technically part of a joint,

	 <P><B><FONT COLOR="#AF0000" FACE="Verdana"><a name="cause"></a>What Causes Knee Problems?</FONT></B></P> 
  <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1">Knee problems can be the result of disease or injury.</FONT></P>
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><FONT COLOR="#AF0000">Disease</FONT><br>
     A number of diseases can affect the knee. The most common
is arthritis. Although arthritis technically means “joint
  inflammation,” the term is used loosely to describe many different
  diseases that can affect the joints. We’ll describe some
  of the most common forms of arthritis and their effects on
  the knees a bit later in the booklet.</FONT></P>
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><FONT COLOR="#AF0000">Injury</FONT><br>
     Knee injuries can occur as the result of a direct blow or sudden
  movements that strain the knee beyond its normal range
  of motion. Sometimes knees are injured slowly over time.</FONT></P>
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1">Problems with the hips or feet, for example, can cause you to
walk awkwardly, which throws off the alignment of the knees
and leads to damage. Knee problems can also be the result of
a lifetime of normal wear and tear. Much like the treads on a
tire, the joint simply wears out over time. We’ll discuss some
of the most common knee injuries later in this booklet, but
first we’ll take a look at the structure of the knee joint.</FONT></P>
	 <P><B><FONT COLOR="#AF0000" FACE="Verdana"><a name="parts"></a>What Are the Parts of the Knee?</FONT></B></P>
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1">Like any joint, the knee is composed of bones and cartilage,
ligaments, tendons, and muscles. See the diagram, and take a
closer look at the different parts of the knee.</FONT></P>

		<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#AF0000" FACE="Verdana" size="-1">Bones and
		  Cartilage</FONT></I></B> </P>
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1">The knee joint is the junction of three bones: the femur
(thigh bone or upper leg bone), the tibia (shin bone or
larger bone of the lower leg), and the patella (knee cap).
The patella is 2 to 3 inches wide and 3 to 4 inches long.
It sits over the other bones at the front of the knee joint
and slides when the knee moves. It protects the knee and
gives leverage to muscles.</FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1">The ends of the three bones in the knee joint are covered
with articular cartilage, a tough, elastic material that helps
absorb shock and allows the knee joint to move smoothly.
Separating the bones of the knee are pads of connective
tissue called menisci (men-NISS-sky). The menisci are
two crescent-shaped discs (each called a meniscus
(men-NISS-kus) positioned between the tibia and femur
on the outer and inner sides of each knee. The two menisci
in each knee act as shock absorbers, cushioning the lower
part of the leg from the weight of the rest of the body as
well as enhancing stability.</FONT></P> 
	
		<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#AF0000"
		  FACE="Verdana" size="-1">Muscles</FONT></I></B></P>
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1">There are two groups of muscles at the knee. The four
quadriceps muscles on the front of the thigh work to
straighten the knee from a bent position. The hamstring
muscles, which run along the back of the thigh from the
hip to just below the knee, help to bend the knee.</FONT></P> 
	
		<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#AF0000"
		  FACE="Verdana" size="-1">Tendons and ligaments</FONT></I></B></P>
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1">The quadriceps tendon connects the quadriceps muscle to
the patella and provides the power to straighten the knee.
The following four ligaments connect the femur and tibia
and give the joint strength and stability:</FONT></P> 
	 <UL> 
		<LI><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1">The medial collateral ligament (MCL), which runs
along the inside of the knee joint, provides stability
to the inner (medial) part of the knee.</FONT></LI> 
		<LI><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1">The lateral collateral ligament (LCL), which runs
along the outside of the knee joint, provides stability
to the outer (lateral) part of the knee.</FONT></LI> 
		<LI><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1">The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), in the center
of the knee, limits rotation and the forward movement
of the tibia.</FONT></LI> 
		<LI><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1">The posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), also in the
center of the knee, limits backward movement of
the tibia.</FONT></LI> 
	 </UL> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1">The knee capsule is a protective, fiber-like structure that
wraps around the knee joint. Inside the capsule, the joint is
lined with a thin, soft tissue called synovium.</FONT></P> 
	 
		
	 <P><B><FONT COLOR="#AF0000" FACE="Verdana"><a name="diagnose"></a>How Are Knee Problems
		Diagnosed?</FONT></B></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1">Doctors diagnose knee problems based on the findings of
the medical history, physical exam, and diagnostic tests.</FONT></P> 
	 <p><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><FONT COLOR="#AF0000">Medical
		    history</FONT><br>
       During the medical history, the doctor asks how long symptoms
have been present and what problems you are having
using your knee. In addition, the doctor will ask about any
injury, condition, or health problem that might be causing
the problem.</FONT></p>
	 <p><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><FONT COLOR="#AF0000">Physical
		      examination</FONT><br>
		      The doctor bends, straightens, rotates (turns), or presses
on the knee to feel for injury, and determine how well the
knee moves and where the pain is located. The doctor
may ask you to stand, walk, or squat to help assess the
knee’s function.</FONT></p>
	 <p><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><FONT COLOR="#AF0000">Diagnostic
		        tests</FONT><br>
		        Depending on the findings of the medical history and physical
exam, the doctor may use one or more tests to determine
the nature of a knee problem. Some of the more commonly
used tests include:</FONT></p>
	 <UL>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><FONT COLOR="#AF0000">X ray
		        (radiography)</FONT>&#151;a procedure in which an x ray
beam is passed through the knee to produce a twodimensional

        <LI><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><FONT COLOR="#AF0000">Computerized
		        axial tomography (CAT) scan</FONT>&#151;a
painless procedure in which x rays are passed through
the knee at different angles, detected by a scanner,
and analyzed by a computer. CAT scan images show
soft tissues such as ligaments or muscles more clearly
than conventional x rays. The computer can combine
individual images to give a three-dimensional view
of the knee.</FONT></LI>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><FONT COLOR="#AF0000">Bone scan
		        (radionuclide scanning)</FONT>&#151;a technique
for creating images of bones on a computer screen or
on film. Prior to the procedure, a harmless radioactive
material is injected into your bloodstream. The material
collects in the bones, particularly in abnormal
areas of the bones, and is detected by a scanner.</FONT></LI>
        <LI><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><FONT COLOR="#AF0000">Magnetic
		        resonance imaging (MRI)</FONT>&#151;a procedure
that uses a powerful magnet linked to a computer to
create pictures of areas inside the knee. During the
procedure, your leg is placed in a cylindrical chamber

x rays) is passed through the knee. An MRI is particularly
useful for detecting soft tissue damage.</FONT></LI>

	 <P><B><FONT COLOR="#AF0000" FACE="Verdana"><a name="common"></a>What Are Some Common Knee Injuries and
Problems?</FONT></B></P>
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1">There are many diseases and types of injuries that can affect
the knee. These are some of the most common, along with
their diagnoses and treatment.</FONT></P>
	 <P><B><FONT COLOR="#AF0000" FACE="Verdana"><a name="arthritis"></a>Arthritis<sup>1</sup></FONT></B></P>
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1">There are some 100 different forms of arthritis, rheumatic
diseases, and related conditions. Virtually all of them have
the potential to affect the knees in some way; however, the
following are the most common:</FONT></P>
	 <ul>
	   <li><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1">osteoarthritis.<br>
       Most people with knee problems have
a form of arthritis called osteoarthritis. In this disease,
the cartilage gradually wears away and changes occur
in the adjacent bone. Osteoarthritis may be caused by joint injury or being overweight. It is associated with
aging and most typically begins in people age 50 years
or older. A young person who develops osteoarthritis
typically has had an injury to the knee or may have
an inherited form of the disease.<br>
	   </FONT></li>
       <li><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1">rheumatoid arthritis.<br>
         Rheumatoid arthritis, which
generally affects people at a younger age than
osteoarthritis, is an autoimmune disease. This means
it occurs as a result of the immune system attacking
components of the body. In rheumatoid arthritis, the
primary site of the immune system’s attack is the synovium,
the membrane that lines the joint. This attack
causes inflammation of the joint. It can lead to
destruction of the cartilage and bone and, in some
cases, muscles, tendons, and ligaments as well.</FONT><br>

       </li>
       <li><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1">other rheumatic diseases.<br>
       These include:<br>
	   <ul>
	     <li><FONT COLOR="#AF0000">gout</font> – an acute and intensely painful form of
arthritis that occurs when crystals of the bodily
waste product uric acid are deposited in the joints</li>
	     <li><FONT COLOR="#AF0000">lupus</font> – an autoimmune disease characterized by
  destructive inflammation of the skin, internal
  organs, and other body systems as well as the joints</li>
	     <li><FONT COLOR="#AF0000">ankylosing spondylitis</font> – an inflammatory form of
    arthritis that primarily affects the spine, leading to
    stiffening and in some cases fusing into a stooped
    position</li>
		   <li><FONT COLOR="#AF0000">psoriatic arthritis</font> – a condition in which inflamed
joints produce symptoms of arthritis for patients
who have or will develop psoriasis</li>
	       <li> infectious arthritis – a term describing forms of
  arthritis that are caused by infectious agents, such
  as bacteria or viruses. Prompt medical attention is
  essential to treat the infection and minimize damage
  to joints, particularly if fever is present.</li>
	   </ul>
       </FONT></li>
  </ul>
  <p><sup>1</sup><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-2">The National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases Information
Clearinghouse has separate publications on the different forms of arthritis mentioned in
this section. See the end of this booklet for contact information.</FONT></p>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><FONT COLOR="#AF0000">Symptoms<br></FONT>
	   The symptoms of arthritis are different for the different
forms. For example, people with rheumatoid arthritis, gout,
or other inflammatory conditions may find the knee swollen,
red, and even hot to the touch. Any form of arthritis can
cause the knee to be painful and stiff.</FONT></P>
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><FONT COLOR="#AF0000">Diagnosis<br></FONT>
The doctor may confirm the diagnosis by conducting a careful
history and physical examination. Blood tests may be
helpful for diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis, but other tests
may be needed too. Analyzing fluid from the knee joint, for
example, may be helpful in diagnosing gout. X rays may be
taken to determine loss or damage to cartilage or bone.</FONT></P>
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><FONT COLOR="#AF0000">Treatment<br></FONT>
Like the symptoms, treatment varies depending on the form
of arthritis affecting the knee. For osteoarthritis, treatment
is targeted at relieving symptoms and may include painreducing
medicines such as aspirin or acetaminophen
(Tylenol<sup>2</sup>); nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
such as ibuprofen (Motrin, Nuprin, Advil); or in some cases
injections of corticosteroid medications directly into the
knee joint. Other treatments for the pain of knee osteoarthritis
include injections of hyaluronic acid substitutes and the
nutritional supplements glucosamine and chondroitin sulphate.
For more information about the use of these two supplements,
see the section titled “What Research Is Being
Conducted on Knee Problems?”</FONT></P>
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1">People with diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing
spondylitis, or psoriatic arthritis often require disease-modifying
antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) or biologic response
modifiers (biologics) to control the underlying disease that is
the source of their knee problems. These drugs are typically
prescribed after less potent treatments such as NSAIDs or
intra-articular injections are deemed ineffective.</FONT></P>
	 <P><sup>2</sup> <FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-2">Brand names included in this booklet are provided as examples only, and their inclusion
does not mean that these products are endorsed by the National Institutes of Health
or any other Government agency. Also, if a particular brand name is not mentioned, this
does not mean or imply that the product is unsatisfactory.</font></P>
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1">DMARDs are a family of medicines that may be able to
slow or stop the immune system from attacking the joints.
This in turn prevents pain and swelling. DMARDs typically
require regular blood tests to monitor side effects. In addition
to relieving signs and symptoms, DMARDs may help to
retard or even stop joint damage from progressing. However,
DMARDs cannot fix joint damage that has already occurred.
Some of the most commonly prescribed DMARDs are
methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, and
leflunomide.</FONT></P>
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1">Biologic response modifiers, or biologics, are a new family of
genetically engineered drugs that block specific molecular
pathways of the immune system that are involved in the
inflammatory process. They are often prescribed in combination
with DMARDs such as methotrexate. Because biologics
work by suppressing the immune system, they could be problematic
for patients who are prone to frequent infection.
They are typically administered by injection at home, or by
an intravenous infusion at a clinic. Some commonly prescribed
biologics include etanercept, adalimumab, infliximab,
and anakinra.</FONT></P>
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1">People with any type of arthritis may benefit from exercises
to strengthen the muscles that support the knee and weight
loss, if needed, to relieve excess stress on the joints.</FONT></P>
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1">If arthritis causes serious damage to a knee or there is incapacitating
pain or loss of use of the knee from arthritis, joint
surgery may be considered. Traditionally, this has been done with what is known as a total knee replacement. However,
newer surgical procedures are continuously being developed
that include resurfacing or replacing only the damaged cartilage
surfaces while leaving the rest of the joint intact.</FONT></P>
<H3><A NAME="Chondromalacia"></A><B><I><FONT COLOR="#AF0000"
		FACE="Verdana">Chondromalacia</FONT></I></B></H3> 
		 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1">Chondromalacia (KON-dro-mah-LAY-she-ah), also called
chondromalacia patellae, refers to softening of the articular
cartilage of the kneecap. This disorder occurs most often in
young adults and can be caused by injury, overuse, misalignment
of the patella, or muscle weakness. Instead of gliding
smoothly across the lower end of the thigh bone, the knee
cap rubs against it, thereby roughening the cartilage underneath
the knee cap. The damage may range from a slightly
abnormal surface of the cartilage to a surface that has been
worn away to the bone. Chondromalacia related to injury
occurs when a blow to the knee cap tears off either a small
piece of cartilage or a large fragment containing a piece of
bone (osteochondral fracture).</FONT></P> 
	 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><FONT COLOR="#AF0000">Symptoms<br></FONT>
The most frequent symptom is a dull pain around or under
the knee cap that worsens when walking down stairs or hills.
A person may also feel pain when climbing stairs or when
the knee bears weight as it straightens. The disorder is common
in runners and is also seen in skiers, cyclists, and
soccer players.</FONT></P> 
	 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><FONT COLOR="#AF0000">Diagnosis<br></font>
Your description of symptoms and an x ray usually help the
doctor make a diagnosis. Although arthroscopy can confirm
the diagnosis, it’s not performed unless conservative treatment
has failed.</FONT></P>
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><FONT COLOR="#AF0000">Treatment<br></font>
Many doctors recommend that people with chondromalacia
perform low-impact exercises that strengthen muscles, particularly
muscles of the the inner part of the quadriceps,
without injuring joints. Swimming, riding a stationary bicycle,
and using a cross-country ski machine are examples of
good exercises for this condition. Electrical stimulation may
also be used to strengthen the muscles.</FONT></P>
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1">Increasingly, doctors are using osteochondral grafting, in
which a plug of bone and healthy cartilage is harvested from
one area and transplanted to the injury site. Another relatively
new technique is known as autologous chondrocyte implantation,
or ACI. It involves harvesting healthy cartilage cells,
cultivating them in a lab and implanting them over the lesion.</FONT></P>
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1">If these treatments don’t improve the condition, the doctor
may perform arthroscopic surgery to smooth the surface of
the cartilage and “wash out” the cartilage fragments that
cause the joint to catch during bending and straightening.
In more severe cases, surgery may be necessary to correct the
angle of the knee cap and relieve friction between it and the
cartilage, or to reposition parts that are out of alignment.</FONT></P>
<H3><A NAME="Injuries to the Meniscus"></A><B><I><FONT
		COLOR="#AF0000" FACE="Verdana">Meniscal Injuries (Injuries to the Menisci)</FONT></I></B></H3> 
	 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1">The menisci can be easily injured by the force of rotating the
knee while bearing weight. A partial or total tear may occur
when a person quickly twists or rotates the upper leg while
the foot stays still (for example, when dribbling a basketball
around an opponent or turning to hit a tennis ball). If the
tear is tiny, the meniscus stays connected to the front and
back of the knee; if the tear is large, the meniscus may be
left hanging by a thread of cartilage. The seriousness of a
tear depends on its location and extent.</FONT></P> 
	
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><FONT COLOR="#AF0000">Symptoms<br></font>
Generally, when people injure a meniscus, they feel some
pain, particularly when the knee is straightened. If the
pain is mild, the person may continue moving. Severe
pain may occur if a fragment of the meniscus catches
between the femur and the tibia. Swelling may occur soon
after injury if there is damage to blood vessels. Swelling
may also occur several hours later if there is inflammation
of the joint lining (synovium). Sometimes, an injury that
occurred in the past but was not treated becomes painful
months or years later, particularly if the knee is injured a
second time. After any injury, the knee may click, lock, feel
weak, or give way. Although symptoms of meniscal injury
may disappear on their own, they frequently persist or return
and require treatment.</FONT></P> 
	
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><FONT COLOR="#AF0000">Diagnosis<br></font>
In addition to listening to your description of the onset of pain
and swelling, the doctor may perform a physical examination
and take x rays of the knee. An MRI may be recommended to
confirm the diagnosis. Occasionally, the doctor may use
arthroscopy to help diagnose a meniscal tear.</FONT></P> 
	
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><FONT COLOR="#AF0000">Treatment<br></font>
If the tear is minor and the pain and other symptoms go
away, the doctor may recommend a muscle-strengthening
program. The following exercises after injury to the meniscus
are designed to build up the quadriceps and hamstring
muscles and increase flexibility and strength:</FONT></P> 
	 <UL> 
		<LI><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1">warming up the joint by riding a stationary bicycle,
then straightening and raising the leg (but not
straightening it too much)</FONT></LI> 
		<LI><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1">extending the leg while sitting (a weight may be
worn on the ankle for this exercise)</FONT></LI> 
		<LI><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1">raising the leg while lying on the stomach</FONT></LI> 
		<LI><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1">exercising in a pool (walking as fast as possible in
chest-deep water, performing small flutter kicks
while holding onto the side of the pool, and raising
each leg to 90 degrees in chest-deep water while
pressing the back against the side of the pool).</FONT></LI> 
	 </UL> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1">Before beginning any type of exercise program, consult
your doctor or physical therapist to learn which exercises are
appropriate for you and how to do them correctly, because
doing the wrong exercise or exercising improperly can cause
problems. A health care professional can also advise you on
how to warm up safely and when to avoid exercising a joint
affected by arthritis.</FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1">If your lifestyle is limited by the symptoms or the problem,
the doctor may perform arthroscopic or open surgery to
see the extent of injury and to remove or repair the tear.
Most young athletes are able to return to active sports after
meniscus repair.</FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1">Recovery after surgical repair takes several weeks. The best
results of treatment for meniscal injury are obtained in people
who do not show articular cartilage changes and who
have an intact anterior cruciate ligament.</FONT></P>

	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1">These are sometimes referred to as sprains.<sup>3</sup> They don’t necessarily
cause pain, but they are disabling. The anterior cruciate
ligament is most often stretched or torn (or both) by a
sudden twisting motion (for example, when the feet are
planted one way and the knees are turned another). The
posterior cruciate ligament is most often injured by a direct
impact, such as in an automobile accident or football tackle.</FONT></P>

	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><FONT COLOR="#AF0000">Symptoms<br></font>
You may hear a popping sound, and the leg may buckle
when you try to stand on it.</FONT></P> 
	
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><FONT COLOR="#AF0000">Diagnosis<br></font>
     The doctor may perform several tests to see whether the
parts of the knee stay in proper position when pressure is
applied in different directions. A thorough examination is
essential. An MRI is accurate in detecting a complete tear,
but arthroscopy may be the only reliable means of detecting
a partial one.</FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><FONT COLOR="#AF0000">Treatment<br></font>
     For an incomplete tear, the doctor may recommend an exercise
program to strengthen surrounding muscles. The doctor
may also prescribe a brace to protect the knee during activity.
For a completely torn anterior cruciate ligament in an active
athlete and motivated person, the doctor is likely to recommend
surgery. The surgeon may reconstruct torn ligament
by using a piece (graft) of healthy tissue from you (autograft)
or from a cadaver (allograft). Although synthetic ligaments
have been tried in experiments, the results have not been as
good as with human tissue. One of the most important elements
in a successful recovery after cruciate ligament surgery
is a 4- to 6-month exercise and rehabilitation program that
may involve using special exercise equipment at a rehabilitation
or sports center. Successful surgery and rehabilitation
will allow the person to return to a normal lifestyle.</FONT></P> 
	<H3><A NAME="Medial and Lateral Collateral Ligament Injury"></A><I><FONT
		COLOR="#AF0000" FACE="Verdana">Medial and Lateral Collateral Ligament Injuries</FONT></I></H3> 
	
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1">The medial collateral ligament is more easily injured than
the lateral collateral ligament. The cause of collateral ligament
injuries is most often a blow to the outer side of the
knee that stretches and tears the ligament on the inner side
of the knee. Such blows frequently occur in contact sports
like football or hockey.</FONT></P> 
	
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><FONT COLOR="#AF0000">Symptoms<br></font>
When injury to the medial collateral ligament occurs, you
may feel a pop and the knee may buckle sideways. Pain and
swelling are common.</FONT></P> 
	 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><FONT COLOR="#AF0000">Diagnosis<br></font>
A thorough examination is needed to determine the kind
and extent of the injury. In diagnosing a collateral ligament
injury, the doctor exerts pressure on the side of the knee to
determine the degree of pain and the looseness of the joint.
An MRI is helpful in diagnosing injuries to these ligaments.</FONT></P>
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><FONT COLOR="#AF0000">Treatment<br></font>
Most sprains of the collateral ligaments will heal if you follow
a prescribed exercise program. In addition to exercise,
the doctor may recommend ice packs to reduce pain and
swelling, and a small sleeve-type brace to protect and stabilize
the knee. A sprain may take 2 to 4 weeks to heal. A severely sprained or torn collateral ligament may be accompanied
by a torn anterior cruciate ligament, which usually
requires surgical repair.</FONT></P>
	 <H3><A NAME="Tendinitis and Ruptured Tendons"></A><B><I><FONT
		COLOR="#AF0000" FACE="Verdana">Tendon Injuries</FONT></I></B></H3> 
	
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1">Knee tendon injuries range from tendinitis (inflammation
of a tendon) to a ruptured (torn) tendon. If a person overuses
a tendon during certain activities such as dancing, cycling,
or running, the tendon stretches and becomes inflamed. Tendinitis
of the patellar tendon is sometimes called jumper’s
knee because in sports that require jumping, such as basketball,
the muscle contraction and force of hitting the ground
after a jump strain the tendon. After repeated stress, the tendon
may become inflamed or tear.</FONT></P> 
	 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><FONT COLOR="#AF0000">Symptoms<br></font>
People with tendinitis often have tenderness at the point
where the patellar tendon meets the bone. In addition, they
may feel pain during running, hurried walking, or jumping.
A complete rupture of the quadriceps or patellar tendon is
not only painful, but also makes it difficult for a person to
bend, extend, or lift the leg against gravity.</FONT></P>
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><FONT COLOR="#AF0000">Diagnosis<br></font>
If there is not much swelling, the doctor will be able to feel a
defect in the tendon near the tear during a physical examination.
An x ray will show that the patella is lower than normal in a quadriceps tendon tear and higher than normal in a
patellar tendon tear. The doctor may use an MRI to confirm
a partial or total tear.</FONT></P>
	
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><FONT COLOR="#AF0000">Treatment<br></font>
Initially, the treatment for tendinitis involves rest, elevating
the knee, applying ice, and taking NSAID medications such
as aspirin or ibuprofen to relieve pain and decrease inflammation
and swelling. A series of rehabilitation exercises is
also useful. If the quadriceps or patellar tendon is completely
ruptured, a surgeon will reattach the ends. After surgery, a
cast is worn for 3 to 6 weeks and crutches are used. For a partial
tear, the doctor might apply a cast without performing
surgery.</FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1">Rehabilitating a partial or complete tear of a tendon requires
an exercise program that is similar to but less vigorous than
that prescribed for ligament injuries. The goals of exercise
are to restore the ability to bend and straighten the knee and
to strengthen the leg to prevent repeat injury. A rehabilitation
program may last 6 months, although people can return to
many activities before then.</FONT></P> 
	 
	 <H3><A NAME="Osgood-Schlatter Disease"></A><B><I><FONT
		COLOR="#AF0000" FACE="Verdana">Osgood-Schlatter Disease</FONT></I></B></H3> 
	 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1">Osgood-Schlatter disease is a condition caused by repetitive
stress or tension on part of the growth area of the upper tibia
(the apophysis). It is characterized by inflammation of the
patellar tendon and surrounding soft tissues at the point where the tendon attaches to the tibia. The disease may also
be associated with an injury in which the tendon is stretched
so much that it tears away from the tibia and takes a fragment
of bone with it. The disease most commonly affects
active young people, particularly boys between the ages of
10 and 15, who play games or sports that include frequent
running and jumping.</FONT></P> 
	
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><FONT COLOR="#AF0000">Symptoms<br></font>
People with this disease experience pain just below the knee
joint that usually worsens with activity and is relieved by
rest. A bony bump that is particularly painful when pressed
may appear on the upper edge of the tibia (below the knee
cap). Usually, the motion of the knee is not affected. Pain
may last a few months and may recur until the child’s growth
is completed.</FONT></P>
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><FONT COLOR="#AF0000">Diagnosis<br></font>
Osgood-Schlatter disease is most often diagnosed by the
symptoms. An x ray may be normal, or show an injury, or,
more typically, show that the growth area is in fragments.</FONT></P>
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><FONT COLOR="#AF0000">Treatment<br></font>
Usually, the disease resolves without treatment. Applying ice
to the knee when pain begins helps relieve inflammation and
is sometimes used along with stretching and strengthening
exercises. The doctor may advise you to limit participation in
vigorous sports. Children who wish to continue moderate or less stressful sports activities may need to wear knee pads for
protection and apply ice to the knee after activity. If there is
a great deal of pain, sports activities may be limited until discomfort
becomes tolerable.</FONT></P>
<H3><A NAME="Iliotibial Band Syndrome"></A><B><I><FONT
		COLOR="#AF0000" FACE="Verdana">Iliotibial Band Syndrome</FONT></I></B></H3> 
	
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1">Iliotibial band syndrome is an inflammatory condition
caused when a band of tissue rubs over the outer bone (lateral
condyle) of the knee. Although iliotibial band syndrome
may be caused by direct injury to the knee, it is most often
caused by the stress of long-term overuse, such as sometimes
occurs in sports training and, particularly, in running.</FONT></P> 
	 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><FONT COLOR="#AF0000">Symptoms<br></font>
A person with this syndrome feels an ache or burning sensation
at the side of the knee during activity. Pain may be localized
at the side of the knee or radiate up the side of the thigh.
A person may also feel a snap when the knee is bent and
then straightened. Swelling is usually absent and knee
motion is normal.</FONT></P>
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><FONT COLOR="#AF0000">Diagnosis<br></font>
The diagnosis of this disorder is typically based on the symptoms,
such as pain at the outer bone, and exclusion of other
conditions with similar symptoms.</FONT></P>
	 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><FONT COLOR="#AF0000">Treatment<br></font>
Usually, iliotibial band syndrome disappears if the person
reduces activity and performs stretching exercises followed by
muscle-strengthening exercises. In rare cases when the syndrome
doesn’t disappear, surgery may be necessary to split
the tendon so it isn’t stretched too tightly over the bone.</FONT></P>

		FACE="Verdana">Osteochondritis Dissecans</FONT></I></B></H3> 
	 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1">Osteochondritis dissecans results from a loss of the blood
supply to an area of bone underneath a joint surface. It
usually involves the knee. The affected bone and its covering
of cartilage gradually loosen and cause pain. This problem
usually arises spontaneously in an active adolescent or young
adult. It may be due to a slight blockage of a small artery or
to an unrecognized injury or tiny fracture that damages the
overlying cartilage. A person with this condition may eventually
develop osteoarthritis.</FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1">Lack of a blood supply can cause bone to break down
(osteonecrosis<sup>4</sup>). The involvement of several joints or the
appearance of osteochondritis dissecans in several family
members may indicate that the disorder is inherited.</FONT></P>
	 <P><sup>4</sup><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-2"> The National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases Information
Clearinghouse has a separate publication on osteonecrosis. See the end of this booklet
for contact information.</font></P>

	 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><FONT COLOR="#AF0000">Symptoms<br></font>
If normal healing doesn’t occur, cartilage separates from the
diseased bone and a fragment breaks loose into the knee
joint, causing weakness, sharp pain, and locking of the joint.</FONT></P>
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><FONT COLOR="#AF0000">Diagnosis<br></font>
An x ray, MRI, or arthroscopy can determine the condition
of the cartilage and can be used to diagnose osteochondritis
dissecans.</FONT></P>
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><FONT COLOR="#AF0000">Treatment<br></font>
If cartilage fragments have not broken loose, a surgeon may
fix them in place with pins or screws that are sunk into the
cartilage to stimulate a new blood supply. If fragments are
loose, the surgeon may scrape down the cavity to reach fresh
bone, add a bone graft, and fix the fragments in position.
Fragments that cannot be mended are removed, and the cavity
is drilled or scraped to stimulate new cartilage growth.
Research is being done to assess the use of cartilage cell and
other tissue transplants to treat this disorder.</FONT></P> 
	 <H3><A NAME="Plica Syndrome"></A><B><I><FONT COLOR="#AF0000" FACE="Verdana">Plica Syndrome</FONT></I></B></H3> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1">Plica (PLI-kah) syndrome occurs when plicae (bands of synovial
tissue) are irritated by overuse or injury. Synovial plicae
are the remains of tissue pouches found in the early stages of
fetal development. As the fetus develops, these pouches normally combine to form one large synovial cavity. If this
process is incomplete, plicae remain as four folds or bands of
synovial tissue within the knee. Injury, chronic overuse, or
inflammatory conditions are associated with this syndrome.</FONT></P> 
	 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><FONT COLOR="#AF0000">Symptoms<br></font>
Symptoms of plica syndrome include pain and swelling, a
clicking sensation, and locking and weakness of the knee.</FONT></P>
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><FONT COLOR="#AF0000">Diagnosis<br></font>
Because the symptoms are similar to those of some other
knee problems, plica syndrome is often misdiagnosed. Diagnosis
usually depends on excluding other conditions that
cause similar symptoms.</FONT></P>
	 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><FONT COLOR="#AF0000">Treatment<br></font>
The goal of treatment is to reduce inflammation of the synovium
and thickening of the plicae. The doctor usually prescribes
medicine such as ibuprofen to reduce inflammation.
People are also advised to reduce activity, apply ice and an
elastic bandage to the knee, and do strengthening exercises.
A cortisone injection into the plica folds helps about half of
those treated. If treatment fails to relieve symptoms within
3 months, the doctor may recommend arthroscopic or open
surgery to remove the plicae.</FONT></P>

      <p><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1">Joint replacement is becoming more common, and hips
and knees are the most commonly replaced joints. In 2003,
more than 638,000 hip or knee replacement surgeries were
performed.</font></p>
      <p><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1">The new joint, called a prosthesis, can be made of plastic,
  metal, or both. It may be cemented into place or uncemented.
  An uncemented prosthesis is designed so that
  bones will grow into it.</font></p>
      <p><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1">First made available in the late 1950s, early total knee
    replacements did a poor job of mimicking the natural
    motion of the knee. For that reason, these procedures
    resulted in high failure and complication rates. Advances
    in total knee replacement technology in the past 10 to 15
    years have enhanced the design and fit of knee implants.</font></p>
      <p><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1">Total knee replacement is often the answer for people
      when x rays and other tests show joint damage; when
      moderate-to-severe, persistent pain does not improve adequately
      with nonsurgical treatment; and when the limited
      range of motion in their knee joint diminishes their quality
      of life.</font></p>
      <p><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1">In the past, patients between 60 and 75 years of age were
        considered to be the best candidates for total knee replacement.
        Over the past two decades, however, the age range
        has been broadened to include more patients older than
        75, who are likely to have other health issues, and patients younger than 60, who are generally more physically active
and whose implants will probably be exposed to greater
mechanical stress.</font></p>
      <p><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"> About 90 percent of patients appear to experience rapid
  and substantial reduction in pain, feel better in general,
  and enjoy improved joint function. While most total knee
  replacement surgeries are successful, failure does occur and
  revision is sometimes necessary. Risk factors include being
  younger than 55 years old; being male; being obese; and
  having osteoarthritis or other illnesses.</font></p></td>

	 <p><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1">Some knee problems, such as those resulting from an accident,
  cannot be foreseen or prevented. However, a person can
  prevent many knee problems by following these suggestions:</font></p>
	 <ul>
	   <li><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1">Before exercising or participating in sports, warm up
      by walking or riding a stationary bicycle, then do
      stretches. Stretching the muscles in the front of the
      thigh (quadriceps) and back of the thigh (hamstrings)
      reduces tension on the tendons and relieves
      pressure on the knee during activity.</font></li>
       <li><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1">Strengthen the leg muscles by doing specific exercises
        (for example, by walking up stairs or hills, or by riding
        a stationary bicycle). A supervised workout with
        weights is another way to strengthen the leg muscles
        that support the knee.</font></li>
       <li><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1">Avoid sudden changes in the intensity of exercise.
Increase the force or duration of activity gradually.</font></li>
       <li><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1">Wear shoes that both fit properly and are in good condition.
  This will help maintain balance and leg alignment
  when walking or running. Knee problems can
  be caused by flat feet or overpronated feet (feet that
  roll inward). People can often reduce some of these
  problems by wearing special shoe inserts (orthotics).</font></li>
       <li><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1">Maintain a healthy weight to reduce stress on the knee.
    Obesity increases the risk of osteoarthritis of the knee.</font></li>
  </ul>
	 <p><B><I><FONT COLOR="#AF0000" FACE="Verdana"><a name="exercise"></a>What Types of Exercise Are Best for People With

	   <li><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><FONT COLOR="#AF0000">Range-of-motion</font> exercises to help maintain normal
        joint movement and relieve stiffness.</font></li>
       <li><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><FONT COLOR="#AF0000">Strengthening</font> exercises to help keep or increase muscle
          strength. Keeping muscles strong with exercises
          such as walking up stairs, leg lifts, dips, or riding a
          stationary bicycle helps support and protect the knee.</font></li>
       <li><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><FONT COLOR="#AF0000">Aerobic or endurance</font> exercises to improve function
            of the heart and circulation and to help control
            weight. Weight control can be important to people
            who have arthritis because extra weight puts pressure on many joints. Some studies show that aerobic exercise
            can reduce inflammation in some joints.
            If you already have knee problems, your doctor or physical
            therapist can help with a plan of exercise that will help the
            knee(s) without increasing the risk of injury or further damage.
            As a rule of thumb, you should choose gentle exercises
            such as swimming, aquatic exercise, or walking over jarring
            exercises such as jogging or high-impact aerobics.</font></li>

	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><strong>Ankylosing spondylitis</strong> – An inflammatory form of arthritis
  that primarily affects the spine, leading to stiffening and possible
  fusion.</FONT></P>
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><strong>Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)</strong> – A ligament in the knee
    that crosses from the underside of the femur to the top of
    the tibia. The ligament limits rotation and the forward
    movement of the tibia.</FONT></P>
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><strong>Arthritis</strong> – A term used to refer to some 100 diseases that
      affect the joints. These diseases cause pain, inflammation,
      stiffness, damage, and/or malformation. The most common
      forms of arthritis are osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.</FONT></P>
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><strong>Avascular necrosis</strong> – A disease in which a temporary or permanent
        loss of the blood supply to the bones causes the
        bone tissue to die and the bone to collapse. This condition
        is also known as osteonecrosis, aseptic necrosis, and
        ischemic necrosis.</FONT></P>
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><strong>Arthroscopy</strong> – A surgical technique that involves making a
          small incision in the skin over the joint. A small lighted tube
          (arthroscope) with a camera is inserted through this incision.
          It takes images of the inside of the joint and projects them
          onto a television screen. While the arthroscope is inside the
          knee joint, the surgeon may insert surgical tools through
          additional small incisions to remove loose pieces of bone or
          cartilage or to repair torn ligaments or menisci.</FONT></P>
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><strong>Biopsy</strong> – A procedure in which tissue is removed from the
body and studied under a microscope. A biopsy of joint tissue
may be used to diagnose some forms of arthritis.</FONT></P>
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><strong>Bone scan (radionuclide scanning)</strong> – A technique for creating
  images of bones on a computer screen or on film. Prior to
  the procedure, a very small amount of radioactive dye is
  injected into the bloodstream. The dye collects in the bones,
  particularly in abnormal areas of the bones, and is detected
  by a scanner. This test detects blood flow to the bone and cell
  activity within the bone, and can show abnormalities in these
  processes that may aid diagnosis.</FONT></P>
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><strong>Cartilage</strong> – A tough, elastic material that covers the ends of
    the bones where they meet to form a joint. In the knee, cartilage
    helps absorb shock and allows the joint to move smoothly.</FONT></P>
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><strong>Computerized axial tomography (CAT) scan</strong> – A painless
      procedure in which x rays are passed through the knee at different
      angles, detected by a scanner, and analyzed by a computer.
      This produces a series of clear cross-sectional images
      (slices) of the knee tissues on a computer screen. CAT scan
      images show soft tissues such as ligaments or muscles
      more clearly than conventional x rays. The computer can
      combine individual images to give a three-dimensional
      view of the knee.</FONT></P>
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><strong>Corticosteroids</strong> – Powerful anti-inflammatory hormones
        made naturally in the body or manmade for use as medicine.
        Oral corticosteroids may be used to treat systemic inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis or
        lupus. Corticosteroid injections may be used to reduce
        inflammation in a joint with arthritis, such as the knee.</FONT></P>
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><strong>Femur</strong> – The thigh bone or upper leg bone. The femur
is one of three bones (the other two are the tibia and the
patella) that join to form the knee joint.</FONT></P>
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><strong>Gout</strong> – An acute and intensely painful form of arthritis.
  This condition occurs when crystals of the bodily waste
  product uric acid are deposited in the joints.</FONT></P>
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><strong>Hamstring</strong> – Prominent tendons at the back of the knee.
    Each knee has a pair of hamstrings that connect to the muscles
    that flex the knee. The hamstring muscles, which bend
    at the knee, run along the back of the thigh from the hip to
    just below the knee.</FONT></P>
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><strong>Iliotibial Band Syndrome</strong> – An inflammatory condition in
      the knee caused by the rubbing of a band of tissue over the
      outer bone (lateral condyle) of the knee. Although iliotibial
      band syndrome may be caused by direct injury to the knee,
      it is most often caused by the stress of long-term overuse,
      which sometimes results from sports training.</FONT></P>
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><strong>Internist</strong> – A doctor trained to diagnose and treat nonsurgical
        diseases.</FONT></P>
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><strong>Lateral collateral ligament (LCL)</strong> – The ligament that runs
          along the outside of the knee joint. It provides stability to the
          outer (lateral) part of the knee.</FONT></P>
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><strong>Ligament</strong> – A tough band of connective tissue that connects
bones to bones.</FONT></P>
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><strong>Lupus</strong> – An autoimmune disease characterized by destructive
  inflammation of the skin, internal organs, and other
  body systems as well as the joints.</FONT></P>
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><strong>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)</strong> – A procedure that uses
    a powerful magnet linked to a computer to create pictures of
    areas inside the knee. Magnetic energy stimulates knee tissue
    to produce signals that are detected by a scanner and analyzed
    by a computer. This creates a series of cross-sectional
    images of a specific part of the knee. An MRI is particularly
    useful for detecting soft tissue damage or disease.</FONT></P>
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><strong>Medial collateral ligament (MCL)</strong> – The ligament that runs
      along the inside of the knee joint, providing stability to the
      outer (medial) part of the knee.</FONT></P>
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><strong>Meniscus</strong> – A pad of connective tissue that separates the
        bones of the knee. The menisci (plural) are divided into two
        crescent-shaped discs (the lateral and medial) positioned
        between the tibia and femur on the outer and inner sides of
        each knee. The two menisci in each knee act as shock
        absorbers, cushioning the lower part of the leg from the
        weight of the rest of the body as well as enhancing stability.</FONT></P>
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><strong>Orthopaedic surgeon</strong> – A doctor who has been trained in the
          nonsurgical and surgical treatment of bones, joints, and soft
          tissues such as ligaments, tendons, and muscles.</FONT></P>
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><strong>Osgood-Schlatter disease</strong> – A disease often caused by repetitive
stress or tension on part of the growth area of the upper
tibia (the apophysis). It is characterized by inflammation of
the patellar tendon and surrounding soft tissues at the point
where the tendon attaches to the tibia. The disease may also
be associated with an injury in which the tendon is stretched
so much that it tears away from the synovium.</FONT></P>
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><strong>Osteoarthritis</strong> – A disease in which the cartilage that cushions
  the ends of the bones is lost, leading to joint pain and
  stiffness. The most common form of arthritis, osteoarthritis
  grows more common with age.</FONT></P>
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><strong>Osteochondritis dissecans</strong> – A condition that results from a
    loss of the blood supply to an area of bone underneath a joint
    surface. The condition usually involves the knee. In
    osteochrondritis dissecans, the affected bone and its covering
    of cartilage gradually loosen and cause pain. This problem
    usually arises spontaneously in an active adolescent or young
    adult. It may be due to a slight blockage of a small artery or
    to an unrecognized injury or tiny fracture that damages the
    overlying cartilage. A person with this condition may eventually
    develop osteoarthritis.
    </FONT></P>
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><strong>Patella</strong> – The bone that sits over the other bones at the front
      of the knee joint and slides when the leg moves. Commonly
      referred to as the knee cap, the patella protects the knee and
      gives leverage to muscles.</FONT></P>
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><strong>Plica syndrome</strong> – A syndrome that occurs when plicae
(bands of synovial tissue) are irritated by overuse or injury.
Synovial plicae are the remains of tissue pouches found in
the early stages of fetal development. As the fetus develops,
these pouches normally combine to form one large synovial
cavity. If this process is incomplete, plicae remain as four
folds or bands of synovial tissue within the knee. Injury,
chronic overuse, or inflammatory conditions are associated
with this syndrome.</FONT></P>
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><strong>Quadriceps muscle</strong> – The large thigh muscle that comes
  down from the femur and over the patella, and then anchors
  into the top of the tibia. Its function is to straighten the leg.</FONT></P>
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><strong>Quadriceps tendon</strong> – The tendon that connects the quadriceps
    muscle to the patella and provides the power to extend
    the leg.</FONT></P>
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><strong>Rheumatic diseases</strong> – Characterized by signs of inflammation
      (redness, heat, swelling, pain) and loss of function of
      joints, tendons, ligaments, bones, and/or muscles. Some
      rheumatic diseases can also involve internal organs.</FONT></P>
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><strong>Rheumatologist</strong> – A doctor specializing in the diagnosis and
        treatment of arthritis and related disorders.</FONT></P>
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><strong>Rheumatoid arthritis</strong> – A disease in which the immune system
          is believed to attack the linings of the joints. This results
          in joint pain, stiffness, swelling, and destruction.</FONT></P>
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><strong>Synovium</strong> – The membrane lining the joints, the synovium
produces joint fluid.</FONT></P>
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><strong>Tendon</strong> – The flexible but tough connective tissue that
  attaches muscles to bones.</FONT></P>
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><strong>Tibia</strong> – The shin bone or larger bone of the lower leg. The
    tibia is one of three bones (the other two are the femur and
    the patella) that join to form the knee joint.</FONT></P>
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="-1"><strong>X ray (radiography)</strong> – A procedure in which an x ray (highenergy
      radiation with waves shorter than those of visible
      light) beam is passed through the knee to produce a twodimensional
      picture of the bones. X rays are often used in
      diagnosing knee problems.</FONT></P>
