<p>The Regional Security Office at U.S. Embassy San Jose reports the following:<BR><BR>A U.S. citizen studying Spanish in Costa Rica was shot twice during a robbery on May 29. The victim was walking to Sabana Park in San Jose at approximately 7:30 am with a laptop computer in hand when one assailant attempted to grab the computer. When the victim resisted, a second assailant, approaching from behind, struck the man in the head with an unknown object, causing a head laceration. The armed assailant then shot the victim in the leg with a small caliber hand gun, causing a grazing wound. Once the first robber had secured the laptop, the two assailants fled the scene on foot and headed towards Sabana Park. As the criminals departed, the armed assailant shot the victim again from a distance of about 15 meters, this time hitting the man in the right knee cap. Police have not yet arrested any suspects in connection with the incident. The victim was subsequently treated and released in good condition. <BR><BR>A similar incident occurred in past months where a European man was robbed walking near Sabana Park - also while carrying a laptop computer. These cases illustrate the elevated risk of openly carrying valuables in public in San Jose. The May incident also shows the inherent risk of resisting assailants when confronted in a similar fashion. Visitors to Costa Rica should exercise good crime avoidance measures, such as remaining vigilant and aware of one's surroundings, and should try to limit the amount of pocket money carried, as well as ATM or credit cards that could be of use to criminals. If accosted, visitors should not resist robbery attempts, as the vast majority of victims who offer resistance in these circumstances suffer injuries or worse. <BR></p>
