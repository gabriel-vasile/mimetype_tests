SLIDE 13:
RATE OF LOADING IN UMTRI KNEE IMPACT TESTS
FORCE (kN) vs TIME (ms)
typical loading rates in FMVSS 208 tests are also less than 300 N/ms while the loading rates in previous research were 400-3000 N/ms.


SLIDE 14:
FEMUR TOLERANCE TESTING
- same apparatus as hip tolerance tests
- same specimens as those used in the hip tolerance tests with hip disarticulated and the head of femur inserted in an acetabular cup fixed to the support


SLIDE 15:
FEMUR TOLERANCE TESTING
- The femur is stronger than the acetagbulum (P<0.01) 
- Hip tolerance is 72+/-7% of femur tolerance


SLIDE 16:
RESULTS OF IMPACT TESTS
- Neutral posture hip fracture tolerance is 5.7+/-1.4kN
- femur facture tolerance is 7.6+/-1.6kN
- femoral neck is the weakest part of the femur.
- Using the displacement of the ram and the force applied at the knee:
	* the stiffness of knee-thigh-hip complex is 233N/mm
	* the stiffness of knee-femur complex is 370+/-80N/mm


SLIDE 17:
STIFFNESS OF HUMAN CADAVER KNEE/FEMUR COMPLEX AT LOADING RATES SEEN IN 30mph FRONTAL CRASHES (FMVSS208)

Most of the knee-femur axial compliance is due to femur bending rather than the compliance at the knee joint


SLIDE 18:
HYBRID III KNEE-THIGH-HIP COMPLEX
- Hybrid III knee-thigh stiffness based on fixed femur skeletal response of knee+distal femur sections by Horsch and Patric (1076)

[illustration of HIII complex, indicating femur casting, rigid femur, femur load cell, and knee skin and knee padding]

- Compliance of knee padding was selected such that HIII knee+distal femur response matches the Horsch-Patric data

- Donnelly and Roberts (1987) found the Hybrid III to produce three times greater force than cadaveric subjects in whole-body knee impact tests


SLIDE 19:
THOR KNEE-THIGH-HIP COMPLEX
- To better match Donnelly & Roberts data, Thor has a compliant element in the mid femur and redistributes some of the thigh mass to the flesh

[illustration of HIII complex, indicating femur casting, compliant femur, femur load cell, rigid knee cap, knee skin & knee padding]

- The knee design is similar to the Hybrid III knee with similar impact response characteristics. It has rigid hemispherical knee caps intended to provide more human-like interaction with the knee bolster.


SLIDE 20:
KNEE-FEMUR COMPLIANCE OF HYBRID III, THOR AND CADAVER IN MOLDED KNEE INTERFACE LOADING AT RATES SIMILAR TO THAT SEEN IN 30mph FRONTAL CRASHES

Initial stiffness (1800N/mm) of HIII knee-femur is due to compression of knee padding. After about 2mm, the HIII stiffness increases to 8100N/mm, which reflects the rigidity of the femur and the limited compliance offered by knee padding.


SLIDE 21:
COMPLIANCE OF ATDs AT TYPICAL LOADING RATES SEEN IN FMVSS 208 FRONTAL CRASHES

Thor knee/femur compliance = 3x cadaver knee/femur compliance

hybrid III knee/femur compliance = 16x cadaver knee/femur compliance

the Thor has a less stiff force deflection response than the Hybrid III dummy due to the compliant element in the Thor femur


SLIDE 22:
BIOFIDELITY OF ATDs
- Biofidelity of an ATD's knee-thigh complex depends on knee/femur stiffness, as well as inertial contributions of the knee/femur complex and other body regions.

- In order to address mass-coupling issues, knee impacts to whole body cadavers and ATDs (free back condition) will be conducted.

- Though the Thor knee-femur stiffness is 3 times greater than that of human cadavers, its response under dynamic knee loading, such as in frontal crashes, may be similar to that of human cadavers.


SLIDE 23:
NEW KNEE BOLSTER DESIGNS
With the advent of new knee bolster designs, such as inflatable bolsters, the biofidelity of the knee-thigh-hip complex of the ATD and appropriate injury criteria will become crucial to ensure adequate protection for the KTH complex in frontal crashes
