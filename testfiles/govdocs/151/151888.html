<P>The Honorable Victor H. Reis<BR>Assistant Secretary for Defense Programs<BR>Department
of Energy<BR>1000 Independence Avenue, SW<BR>Washington, DC 20585-0104</P>
<P>Dear Dr. Reis:</P>
<P>Enclosed for your consideration and action, where appropriate, are the
observations developed by the members of the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety
Board (Board) staff concerning electrical and ventilation systems of the TA-55
facility at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL).  These observations are
based on reviews of available documents, and discussions with Department of
Energy (DOE) staff and contractor personnel at LANL on August 13-15, 1996.</P>
<P>In the enclosed report, the Board staff conclude that the electrical safety
program at LANL needs upgrading.  The staff noted that the existing electrical
safety programs does not meet the regulations of the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration in some respects.  The report also provides a number of
design-related observations regarding areas for further improvement.  For
example, leaks in the fire suppression supply lines at TA-55 are of particular
note because this situation calls into question the viability and readiness of
the fire protection system to perform as required.</P>
<P>The Board believes that the electrical safety program at LANL needs to be
upgraded to comply with the DOE Electrical Safety Guidelines.  The Board also
expects that the Integrated Safety Management Systems being developed at LANL in
response to Recommendation 95-2 will address these issues.</P>
<P>The report is being provided for whatever actions you may deem appropriate
in the furtherance of our mutual interest in safe operations.  Should you need
further information, please do not hesitate to call me.</P>
<P>Sincerely,</P>
<P>John T. Conway<BR>Chairman</P>

<P>This report documents a review of the electrical and ventilation systems of
the TA-55 facility at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL).  This review was

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The review identified the following major issues:</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>LANL does not have an adequate electrical safety program, and at the time of
the review was not aware of the Department of Energy's (DOE) Electrical Safety
Guidelines, which were issued to various DOE sites with no compliance
requirements.  Thus DOE and contractor employees at LANL are not receiving the
full benefit of protection addressed in the guidelines, particularly in the area
of safe electrical work practices.</P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>At a location at the LANL site where two 115 kV transmission lines cross,
there is the potential for a failure of these lines, and this situation could
isolate the site from off-site power for an extended period.  If such a failure
were to occur, it would take days to repair the lines.  Because the back-up
diesel generator at TA-55 has only a 4-hour supply of fuel for a fully loaded
bus, systems important to safety, such as ventilation systems, may not be
available to perform their intended functions during an extended loss of power.</P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Leaks due to corrosion of fire suppression supply lines at TA-55 are
becoming sufficiently serious to require replacement of the lines in the near
future.  Adequate measures have not been taken to justify the continued use of
the lines until they are replaced in 1 year.</P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Sixty-two gloveboxes in Building PF-4 at TA-55 would not be able to
withstand the increased forces of a redefined LANL seismic event.  Upgrading is
in progress on 14 of these gloveboxes, which dominate the potential source term,
but work on the remaining 48 is not funded.   </P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>3.  Background</B></P>
<P>LANL has completed a feasibility study aimed at defining the constraints on
creating an active safe shutdown condition for Building PF-4 at TA-55.
Implementation of such a condition will require various upgrades, such as
installation of new redundant uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems,
modification of a diesel generator control system, installation of a new motor
control center, and replacement of facility control systems.  Board staff have
also reviewed the final Type A accident investigation reports for the electrical
accidents at LANL on January 17, 1996, and July 11, 1996.</P>
<P><B>4.</B>  <B>Discussion/Observations</B></P>
<P>The review identified the following potentially significant issues at the
TA-55 facility.  A discussion of other relevant issues is provided in Attachment
A.</P>
<P><B>Electrical Safety Program.</B>  LANL does not have an adequate
electrical safety program, and as of this review was not aware of the DOE
Electrical Safety Guidelines (DOE/ID-10600, dated May 1993), which were issued
to various DOE sites with no compliance requirements.  These guidelines include
electrical safety requirements of Occupational Safety and Health Administration
(OSHA) regulations contained in 29 CFR 1910 and 29 CFR 1926.  Their objective is
to enhance electrical safety awareness and mitigate electrical hazards to
workers and the public.</P>
<P>DOE briefed the Board staff on two recent electrical accidents that occurred
on January 17, 1996, and July 11, 1996.  In the former case, an employee was
seriously injured and remains in a deep coma as a result of coming in contact
with a 13.2 kV electrical cable.  In the latter case, a student employee
received a 4000 V shock while conducting electrical measurements on a microwave
oven; this employee is expected to recover fully from his injuries.  Board staff
reviewed the final Type A accident investigation reports on these two accidents
and observed that DOE's Electrical Safety Guidelines document was not
referenced.  Because existing procedures at LANL do not include important
elements of the DOE guidelines, DOE and contractor employees are not receiving
the full benefit of protection addressed in the guidelines, particularly in the
area of safe electrical work practices.</P>
<P>LANL intends to establish an adequate electrical safety program.</P>
<P><B>Transmission Line Single Failure.</B>  Two high-voltage (115 kV)
transmission lines that provide power to the LANL site cross each other at one
location on site.  A failure of the transmission lines at this point could
isolate the site from power for an extended period.  This situation could be
resolved by routing one of the transmission lines underground.  LANL will review
this issue.</P>
<P><B>Fire Suppression System.  </B>Fire suppression supply lines (10 inch
diameter) at TA-55 have corroded and developed leaks in various sections of the
pipe.  At some locations, the wall of the piping is less than 75 percent of its
original thickness.  The first leak was discovered on </P>
<P>June 20, 1988.  Since then, approximately 27 leaks have been detected and
repaired.  These leaks are caused by galvanically induced pitting.  The galvanic
corrosion is a result of installing the uncoated carbon steel piping underground
without cathodic protection.  An Unreviewed Safety Question (USQ) determination
(USQD-95-006) was made for the corrosion of the TA-55 fire suppression system
piping; it concluded that this change does involve a USQ.</P>
<P>DOE, on July 5, 1996, approved a Justification for Continued Operation of
TA-55 Plutonium Facility with Existing Corrosion of Fire Suppression Supply
Piping.  As stated in the document, TA-55 has accepted the risk of continued
operations for an additional year, based on the low probability of a fire in
Building PF-4 and an aggressive combustible loading minimization walkdown
program, as well as other design features (i.e., ventilation dampers and fire
rated facility construction).  At the end of this time, LANL plans to install a
new fire suppression water supply system to replace the entire existing system.</P>
<P>Board staff are concerned that before the water supply system is replaced,
it might degrade to the point where it will become unreliable.  Because of the
combustible loading in TA-55, including oil transformers and cables, the staff
believe that an operability limit needs to be established, and that a design
modification needs to be considered that would allow the introduction of water
to the sprinklers by alternate means.  The operability limit could be based on
the amount of leakage.  DOE will evaluate and resolve this issue.</P>
<P><B>Electrical Calculations.</B>  Comprehensive short-circuit, voltage
profile, and coordination studies are essential to safeguard personnel and
maintain a safe and reliable power system.  Such studies would be performed in
accordance with Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)
STD-141, IEEE Recommended Practice for Electric Power Distribution for
Industrial Plant, and STD-242, IEEE Recommended Practice for Protection and
Coordination of Industrial and Commercial Power Systems.  LANL has completed
these calculations for 13.2 kV systems only.  Short-circuit analysis of 120 V
systems and a protective device coordination study for 480 V and lower systems
have not been performed.  LANL plans to complete these analyses as part of its
Capability, Maintenance, and Improvement Project.  Therefore, the Board staff
could not verify the capability of the electrical equipment to perform the
intended functions when required.</P>
<P><B>Emergency Lighting.</B>  In the event of an earthquake, emergency
lighting is needed for personnel egress from the facility.  The Board staff
observed that emergency lighting equipment at the TA-55 facility does not appear
to be seismically supported or qualified.  LANL will evaluate this issue.</P>
<P><B>Battery Room Hydrogen Explosion Hazard.  </B>The Board staff noted to
LANL that the existing installation of an open filament space heater is a
potential ignition source.  This heater, installed above lead-acid batteries in
the battery room, is in violation of the requirements of American National
Standards Institute (ANSI) ANSI-C2, National Electrical Safety Code.  An
explosion could result if hydrogen produced by lead-acid batteries were to come
in contact with the open filament of the space heater.  LANL will perform an
evaluation to resolve this issue.</P>
<P><B>Glovebox Seismic Upgrades. </B> LANL analyses of a redefined seismic
event have shown that 62 gloveboxes at PF-4 in the TA-55 facility would not be
able to withstand the increased forces.  Gloveboxes would fail because of
anchorage and support inadequacies or interactions with other gloveboxes.  As a
result of these analyses, 14 gloveboxes, which dominate the potential source
term, are being upgraded.  The remaining 48 gloveboxes also need to be
strengthened, but work on them has not been funded.  It should be noted that the
ductwork and the gloveboxes constitute a significant portion of the Zone I
ventilation system and must remain intact during a seismic event.</P>
<P><B>Facility Control System.</B>  The facility control system at TA-55 is in
the process of being replaced.  This system monitors heating, ventilation, and
air conditioning (HVAC); electrical power; continuous air monitors; criticality
alarms; the fire detection and suppression system; chilled water; and compressed
gases.  In addition, it provides limited control functions, including switching,
startup, and shutdown of HVAC fans, and alarm processing for site safety
notifications.</P>
<P>The present system is approximately 20 years old, and replacement parts are
not available.  The current mean time between failures (MTBF) for subcomponents
of the system is on the order of 4 days.  During the week of the staff's visit,
the facility control system failed three times. </P>
<P>The facility control system is classified as a safety-significant system.
Its criterion for acceptable reliability has been specified as an MTBF of
greater than 36 days.  This results in an acceptable failure rate of 10 per
year.  The staff believe this failure rate is too high given the
safety-significant classification of the system.  LANL stated that the system
will be upgraded to have an expected MTBF of greater than 426 days.</P>
<P><B>5.</B>  <B>Future Staff Actions  </B></P>
<P>The Board staff will continue to follow the resolution of the issues
identified in this report.</P>

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><B>ATTACHMENT A</B><BR><B>ADDITIONAL ISSUES</B></H3>
<P><B>1.  Loss-of-Power Event</B></P>
<P>On August 10, 1996, Building PF-4 at TA-55 suffered a loss of off-site power
when large portions of at least seven western states lost power.  At the time of
the incident, no one was in the facility, and the work area was locked.  With
the loss of off-site power and without operation of the diesel generator, the
ventilation zones lost their negative pressure, and pressures in the building
equalized in a manner of minutes.  At the time of the event, the operations
center was staffed by two operators; support from security and from health
physics was available on site.</P>
<P>The operators immediately followed procedure NMT8-FMP-505-R01, Remotely
Operating the Diesel Generator After Loss of Power to the North and South
Emergency Motor Control Centers, dated March 25, 1996.  This procedure requires
that the operators verify the status of certain breaker positions on the
electronic display of the facility control system before starting the diesel
generator.  One breaker (52-B1), which is required to be open, was shown on the
display to be closed.  Local verification required entry into Building PF-4, but
support from security and health physics was required for this purpose.</P>
<P>After approximately 40 minutes, the operators were able to change out one of
the computer components, and the CRT display showed the breaker in the proper
position.  At this point, the operators remotely started the diesel generator,
which loaded in approximately 3 minutes.  The generator continued to run for 1
hour until off-site power was restored.  LANL representatives stated that no
unexpected contamination was found after power had been restored.</P>
<P>Facility personnel stated that the diesel generator can operate in a loaded
condition for 4 hours with the amount of fuel in the &quot;day tank.&quot;  The
current procedure to operate the generator requires that the operator &quot;contact
a fuel truck . . . if the diesel generator will be run for longer than two hours
. . . .&quot;  The adequacy of this statement is questionable.</P>
<P><B>2.</B>  <B>Diesel Generator</B></P>
<P><B>Automatic Start Capability.</B>  The TA-55 facility currently has only
one diesel generator.  This generator does not start automatically after a loss
of normal power.  TA-55 has now confirmed that this generator will be modified
for automatic start capability.</P>
<P><B>Additional Diesel Generator.  </B>A review by Board staff is currently
ongoing to determine whether the facility requires emergency backup power and
therefore needs an additional diesel generator and design upgrades.</P>
<P><B>Nonsafety Loads on the Diesel Generator.</B>  During the Board staff
review, electrical supply from the diesel generator to the nonsafety motor
control center of Building PF-8 was discussed.  The motor control center
provides power to hot-water boilers and associated pumps.  The Board staff
called to LANL's attention that any nonsafety load connection to diesel
generator buses will require an isolation device, as defined in ANSI/IEEE
Standard-384, Standard Criteria for Independent Class 1 Equipment and Circuits.
LANL intends to use this standard in the selection of an isolation device.</P>
<P><B>Synchronization.  </B>Building PF-4 at TA-55 is fed by two 13.2 kV
lines.  To run the diesel generator, one of these lines must be disconnected and
the generator synchronized to the remaining 13.2 kV line.  In the past, it was
mistakenly reported that the generator could be tied only to a dead bus.  This
was erroneous in that a synchronizing circuit is preset and functional, but it
has not been used because of concern about getting the two energized lines out
of synchronization.</P>
<P><B>Fuel Tank.  </B>As noted above, the diesel generator has a small &quot;day
tank&quot; that has only a 4-hour supply of fuel for a fully loaded bus.  During
a field walkdown, it was observed that the tank could be filled only in the room
where the tank and generator are located.  Because entrances to the diesel
generator facility are within 100 feet of the base of the discharge ductwork,
additions of diesel fuel oil during a potential radiological emergency could be
hazardous to workers.  LANL will evaluate this issue.</P>
<P><B>3.</B>  <B>Oil-Insulated Transformers</B></P>
<P>Four oil-insulated transformers located inside the plutonium-handling
facility are part of the power distribution system.  The transformer oil could
ignite during a transformer failure and be the source of a fire.  The National
Electrical Safety Code (ANSI-C2) and the National Fire Protection Association
(NFPA-70) National Electric Code require that indoor oil-insulated transformers
be located in a transformer vault.  In addition, the codes require that the
transformer vault include fire walls and doors, ventilation, and oil containment
and drainage.  The TA-55 transformers do not meet these requirements.  In an
earlier trip report, Board staff suggested that the replacement of oil-insulated
transformers with dry-type transformers would be a prudent approach to resolving
this concern.  LANL has confirmed that oil- type transformers will be replaced
by dry-type transformers; this replacement will be part of the Capability,
Maintenance, and Improvement Project.</P>
<P><B>4.  Active Safe Shutdown from a Ventilation Perspective</B></P>
<P>The Board staff reviewed a feasibility study of an active safe shutdown
system.  This study considers the use of a new UPS system to power all eight
exhaust fans in the Zone I ventilation system.  During a loss of power, the new
UPS would maintain four of the eight fans running and maintain a negative 0.6
inch water column in the Zone I system (relative to atmosphere) for 1 hour.
LANL stated that this would allow enough time to get power restored or bring the
diesel generator on line.  If the UPS were to fail, the facility would revert to
a passive mode.</P>
<P>With four Zone I exhaust fans operating after a loss of site power, the flow
rate to the plant vent would be approximately 4000 standard cubic feet per
minute (scfm).  Studies indicate that the isokinetic probes would perform within
an acceptable range at this flow rate.  This confirms the adequacy of the
ventilation system design.</P>
<P><B>5.  Installation of New UPS</B></P>
<P>As discussed above, implementation of an active safe shutdown condition
would require the installation of the new redundant UPS.  This system would
power critical equipment that would sustain an active safe shutdown condition.
The motor that serves glovebox exhaust fans FE-850, -851, -852, -853, -854, -
855, -856, and -857 and operations center air supply fans FS-880A and -880B
would be powered from the new UPS.</P>
<P>The fan motor electrical demand could range from 5 to 10 horsepower.
Normally, a UPS is not used to feed multiple-horsepower motors.  The Board staff
are concerned that the new UPS might not be able to withstand the starting
current transients, which could be as high as six to ten times the full load
current of one motor.  This condition could become worse when all eight motors
and other loads are started from the UPS at the same time.  LANL has agreed to
perform a study to review the adequacy of the UPS design in this regard.</P>
<P><B>6.  Air Inleakage at Building PF-4</B></P>
<P>LANL is in the process of developing a test method to measure the amount of
air inleakage into Building PF-4.  Such a test is necessary to ensure that leak
rates assumed in the safety analyses are not exceeded.  For example, a 6 percent
leak rate factor used in an earthquake scenario produces a hypothetical 18 rem
exposure.</P>
<P>LANL is structuring the test in accordance with American Standards for
Testing Materials (ASTM) 283 and E783.  The test will include verification that
leakage is less than 250 scfm at negative 0.15 inch water column (versus the
Final Safety Analysis Report's fire analysis of 500 cfm).  At present, door
seals are being replaced and tested prior to implementation of the new Technical
Safety Requirements.  The Board staff pointed out that it would be desirable to
include all doors from Building PF-4 to the outside in the program, and to
consider other penetrations for inclusion if they are not sealed and are open to
the outside.</P></BODY></HTML>
