<B>Summary:</B><BR>Named as basal formation of Upper Cretaceous in vicinity of Boquillas PO, along west flank of Carmen Range, southeast Brewster Co, TX in Permian basin.  Type not designated.  Is thin-bedded (average 4-8 in thick), closely jointed, fossiliferous, flaggy limestone separated by delicate clayey seams that are most apparent when weathered.  Thickness 285 ft; upper 150 ft contains considerable amount of less-indurated chalky ledges.  Color variable, characteristically cream grayish white with faint ferruginous red stain common in Boquillas region; elsewhere some ledges are dark and almost black on fresh fractures.  Is noted to occur around Mariscal Mountain; on south, east, and north sides of Christmas Mountain; west of Terlingua Creek from Cuesta Blanca to Reed Plateau; and south of Terlingua, still further west beyond Chisos region.  Overlies Buda limestone (Lower Cretaceous); underlies and grades into Terlingua beds (new).  Is considered western equivalent of Eagle Ford shales to the east. Foraminifer and mollusk fossils listed.  Age is Late Cretaceous.

<B>Summary:</B><BR>Is lowest formation of three in Gulf series in Agua Fria 15-minute quadrangle, southwestern Brewster Co, TX (in southern part of Permian basin).  Unconformably overlies Buda limestone of Comanche series.  Overlain by Terlingua beds of Udden (1907).  Gradational contacts, insufficiently detailed paleontological work in the Trans-Pecos region, and vague definitions of formational boundaries result in many stratigraphic problems for Gulf series rocks in the area.  For purposes of discussion and mapping, the Boquillas-Terlingua sequence is divided into lower and upper units:  "lower Boquillas-Terlingua unit" (approximate equivalent of Udden's Boquillas flags) and "upper Boquillas-Terlingua unit" (approximate equivalent of Udden's Terlingua beds).  Boquillas-Terlingua contact lies somewhere within 300 ft of gradational strata between the "CRIOCERAS" zone and the INOCERAMUS UNDULATOPLICATUS zone.  Base of Fizzle Flat lentil (new) is arbitrarily selected as boundary between lower and upper units.  Lower unit divided into a lower nodular (about 210 ft thick), a middle terraced member (about 205 ft thick), and an upper shaly member (about 100 ft thick).  Measured sections described.  Map scale 1:62,500.  Stratigraphic distribution of molluscan fossils is discussed.  Age is Late Cretaceous.

<B>Summary:</B><BR>Is revised to include both the Boquillas Flags of Udden (1907) and the lower member of his Terlingua Beds.  Is divided into the Ernst Member (new, at base) and the San Vicente Member (new, above) in Big Bend National Park area, Brewster Co, TX in the Permian basin.  Is basal formation (of two) in Terlingua Group (revised).  Overlies Buda Limestone; underlies Pen Formation (new) of Terlingua Group.  Is 805-875 ft thick in study area.  [Table 2 shows Boquillas as Turonian and Coniacian (part); however, Table 5 clearly shows the Ernst Member as both Cenomanian (part) and Turonian on the basis of ammonites.]  Age is Cenomanian (part), Turonian, and early Coniacian (Late Cretaceous).

<B>Summary:</B><BR>Is lower formation of two in Terlingua Group.  Is mapped in the Black Gap area, Brewster Co, TX in southern part of Permian basin.  Overlies Buda Limestone of Comanche Series. Overlain by Pen Clay.  Consists of two members:  Ernst Member, includes the lower flaggy beds, 277 ft thick; and overlying San Vicente Member, includes the chalky limestone and calcareous shale, 274 ft thick, above the flaggy beds and below the gypsiferous Pen Clay.  Members are not separately mapped; composite thickness is 551 ft.  Crops out in Black Gap area within northwest-trending structural and topographic low extending from Stillwell, Heath, and Horse Canyons northwest through Black Gap headquarters to State Hwy 385; broadest area of outcrop is between Black Gap and Maravillas Canyon.  INOCERAMUS LABIATUS is common in Ernst Member and occurs in lower 125 ft of San Vicente Member. Concentration of INOCERAMUS UNDULATOPLICATUS that occurs 35 to 50 ft above base of San Vicente is considered to be the I. UNDULATOPLICATUS zone.  Age is Cretaceous.
