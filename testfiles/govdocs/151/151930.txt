ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDINGS


COMMISSION SANCTIONS IRA WEISS

     The Commission has imposed sanctions on Ira Weiss, an attorney
     who  served as bond counsel for the Neshannock Township School
     District of Lawrence County, Pennsylvania, in connection  with
     the  School District's issuance, in June 2000, of $9.6 million
     in   three-year  general  obligation  notes  to  fund   school
     construction projects.  The Commission ordered Weiss to  cease
     and desist from committing or causing any violations or future
     violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities
     Act  of  1933.  The Commission also ordered Weiss to  disgorge
     the amount of $9,509.63, plus prejudgment interest.
     
     The  Commission found that Weiss violated antifraud provisions
     by negligently rendering an unqualified opinion, reinforced by
     a  second,  supplemental opinion, that interest on  the  notes
     would  be  exempt from federal income taxation, and  approving
     offering  documents representing that the Note proceeds  would
     be   used  for  school  construction  projects.   The   record
     demonstrated  that Weiss knew or should have  known  that  the
     School District's primary purpose in issuing the notes was  to
     earn  arbitrage profits, and that it did not have sufficiently
     concrete  plans  for the use of the proceeds  to  justify  the
     notes'  tax-exempt status.  Weiss, moreover,  failed  to  make
     adequate  inquiry to ascertain the level of certainty  of  the
     School  District's  construction  plans,  objectively  viewed,
     before  approving  the  offering  documents  and  issuing  his
     opinions.   The  Commission  accordingly  held  that   Weiss's
     failure  to  look for even minimal objective  indicia  of  the
     School  District's reasonable expectations to spend  the  note
     proceeds  on  school projects departed from  the  standard  of
     reasonable prudence and was at least negligent.
     
     In   imposing   sanctions,  the  Commission   emphasized   the
     importance  that  investors place on bond counsels'  opinions.
     It  stated  that  “the smooth functioning  of  the  securities
     markets  will be subject to serious disruption if  the  public
     cannot  safely  rely  on the expertise  proffered  by  lawyers
     rendering their opinions.”  The Commission found that  Weiss's
     conduct  caused harm to investors who purchased the notes  and
     the  marketplace.   He  did  not  appear  to  acknowledge  any
     wrongdoing.   Noting that Weiss continues to practice  in  the
     area  of  municipal finance and could give another unqualified
     opinion in the future, the Commission determined that a  cease
     and desist order against him was warranted in order to protect
     the public.  (Rels. 33-8641; 34-52875; File No. 3-11462)
     
COMMISSION  BARS  VLADISLAV  STEPHEN  ZUBKIS  FOLLOWING  ENTRY   OF
PERMANENT INJUNCTION

     The   Commission   barred  Vladislav   Stephen   Zubkis   from
     association with a broker or dealer and from participating  in
     any offering of penny stock following the entry of a permanent
     injunction against Zubkis by the United States District  Court
     for  the  Southern District of New York.  The  district  court
     found on summary judgment that Zubkis had orchestrated a wide-
     ranging  fraud  involving  the  securities  of  a  company  he
     controlled.  The district court also ordered Zubkis to  pay  a
     total  of   $21,578,731.39  in disgorgement  and  pre-judgment
     interest.  The Commission found that the issuer involved was a
     penny-stock company and that the public interest required that
     Zubkis be barred.  The Commission noted that underlying scheme
     generated  substantial profits and demonstrated a high  degree
     of  scienter.  The Commission further noted that  Zubkis,  who
     refuses  to  recognize the authority of securities regulators,
     has  a record of violations of the securities laws.  (Rel. 34-
     52876; File No. 3-11625)

RENN  CAPITAL GROUP, INC. TO PAY NEARLY $3.9 MILLION TO SETTLE  SEC
CHARGES THAT IT ASSESSED ILLEGAL PERFORMANCE-BASED FEES

     On  December  1, the Commission announced settled  enforcement
     proceedings against RENN Capital Group, Inc. (RENN Capital), a
     registered  investment adviser based in  Dallas,  Texas.   The
     Commission’s Order found that RENN Capital willfully  violated
     the performance-based-fee and proxy-solicitation provisions of
     the  federal  securities  laws and that  it  filed  misleading
     reports  with  the  Commission.   Between  January  1996   and
     December  2003, RENN Capital received excessive advisory  fees
     by improperly including unrealized capital appreciation in the
     formula  it  used  to  charge performance-based  fees  to  the
     Renaissance Capital Growth & Income Fund III, Inc. (RenIII), a
     registered  business development company.  RENN  Capital  also
     failed  to  file a preliminary proxy statement  in  connection
     with  an  amendment to the advisory contract with  RenIII  and
     filed  reports  with the Commission on behalf of  RenIII  that
     omitted  material  facts  concerning  the  use  of  unrealized
     capital  appreciation in the calculation of  the  performance-
     based fees that would have prevented statements in the reports
     from being misleading.
     
     The  Commission  ordered RENN Capital to pay  disgorgement  of
     $2,851,362  plus prejudgment interest of $924,509  to  RenIII.
     It further required RENN Capital to pay a $100,000 penalty, to
     be  paid  to  RenIII  under the Fair Fund  provisions  of  the
     federal  securities  laws.  Finally, the Order  required  RENN
     Capital  to  cease and desist from committing or  causing  any
     violations or any future violations of Section 205(a)  of  the
     Investment  Advisers Act and Sections 20(a) and 34(b)  of  the
     Investment  Company  Act  and  Rule  20a-1  thereunder.   RENN
     Capital  consented to the entry of the Order without  admitted
     or  denying  the Commission’s findings.  (Rels.  IA-2454,  IC-
     27174; File No. 3-12118)

CEASE-AND-DESIST ORDER AND ADMINISTRATIVE SACTIONS ENTERED  AGAINST
MAXWELL INVESTMENTS, LLC, GARY MAXWELL AND BART COON

     On  December  1,  the Commission instituted and simultaneously
     settled   cease-and-desist   and  administrative   proceedings
     against  Maxwell  Investments, LLC,  a  registered  investment
     adviser, and Gary J. Maxwell, and Bart D. Coon, principals  of
     Maxwell  Investments, based on violations  of  the  antifraud,
     adviser reporting and adviser recordkeeping provisions of  the
     federal  securities laws.  The Order finds  that  during  2003
     Maxwell  Investments, Gary Maxwell and Coon offered  and  sold
     interests in several hedge funds operated by the firm  through
     private   placement  memoranda  which  misrepresented  Maxwell
     Investments’   fee   structure   and   made   other   material
     misrepresentations.   It  further  found  that  during   2003,
     Maxwell  Investments collected $839,798  in  excess  fees  and
     transferred  assets  between funds at  various  times  without
     disclosing  these practices to investors.  Further,  the  firm
     failed to maintain proper books and records.

     Based  on  these findings, Maxwell Investments, Gary  Maxwell,
     and Coon have been ordered to cease and desist from committing
     or causing any violations and any future violations of Section
     17(a)  of  the  Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b)  of  the
     Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and
     Sections  204,  206(1),  206(2),  206(4),  and  207   of   the
     Investment  Advisers Act of 1940 and Rules  204-2(a)(1),  204-
     2(a)(2),   204-2(a)(4),  204-2(a)(6),  204-2(a)(10),   206(4)-
     2(a)(3),  206(4)-4(a)(1)  thereunder.   In  addition,  Maxwell
     Investments has been censured and Gary Maxwell and  Coon  have
     each  been  suspended  from association  with  any  investment
     adviser for periods of twelve months and ordered to pay  civil
     penalties of $120,000 each; the ordered suspensions are to  be
     served consecutively.  Maxwell Investments, Gary Maxwell,  and
     Coon  consented to the issuance of the Order without admitting
     or  denying any of the Order’s findings.  (Rels. 33-8640;  34-
     52873; IA-2455; File No. 3-12119)

IN THE MATTER OF FINANTRA CAPITAL, INC., ET AL.

     An  Administrative  Law  Judge  has  issued  an  Order  Making
     Findings and Revoking Registrations by Default (Default Order)
     in  Finantra  Capital,  Inc., et al.   The  Order  Instituting
     Proceedings  alleged that Respondents Finantra Capital,  Inc.,
     Hayes  Corp., Hollywood Trenz, Inc., and Visionamerica,  Inc.,
     failed to comply with Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange
     Act  of  1934 and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder by failing
     to  file required periodic reports while their securities were
     registered  with the Securities and Exchange Commission.   The
     Default  Order finds these allegations to be true and  revokes
     the  registration  of each class of registered  securities  of
     Finantra  Capital, Inc., Hayes Corp., Hollywood  Trenz,  Inc.,
     and Visionamerica, Inc.  (Rel. 34-52877; File No. 3-12071)

SEC  OBTAINS  FINAL  JUDGMENT FOR FRAUD  AGAINST  FORMER  POWERBALL
INTERNATIONAL, INC. PRESIDENT WILLIAM W. FREISE

     On  Nov. 23, 2005, the U.S. District Court for the District of
     Columbia  entered a final judgment against William W.  Freise,
     the former president and director of Powerball, for falsifying
     company records to hide his theft of $7,200 and his failure to
     pay  for stock that he received from the exercise of warrants.
     Freise consented to the entry of the final judgment, including
     a  permanent  injunction  enjoining  him  from  violating  the
     antifraud  provisions  of the federal securities  laws  and  a
     permanent officer and director bar.
     
     On  March  31, 2004, the Commission filed a complaint alleging
     that  during  the period June 2002 through April 2003,  Freise
     falsified company records to hide his theft of $7,200  and  to
     hide  his  failure to pay $40,000 for stock  he  had  received
     through the exercise of warrants.  The complaint alleges  that
     in  order  to  conceal his fraud, Freise altered monthly  bank
     statements  for  Powerball's bank  account,  which  made  that
     account  appear that it contained a substantially higher  cash
     balance  than  it  actually contained.  The complaint  alleges
     that Freise knew that Powerball's financial statements and its
     reports  to  the  Commission would  reflect  such  false  cash
     balances.   As a result of such conduct, Powerball  materially
     misstated its financial statements for the quarters ended June
     30,  2002, and Sept. 30, 2002, and for the year ended Dec. 31,
     2002.
     
     Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint,
     William  Freise  consented to the entry of  a  final  judgment
     permanently enjoining him from violating Section 17(a) of  the
     Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of  the
     Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Rules 10b-
     5,  13b2-1,  and 13b2-2 promulgated thereunder,  as  well  as,
     aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A),
     and  13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20,  13a-1,
     and   13a-13  promulgated  thereunder.   William  Freise  also
     consented  to an order barring him from serving as an  officer
     or  director of a public company.  The final judgment does not
     impose    civil   penalties   based   on   William    Freise’s
     representations  in  a sworn Statement of Financial  Condition
     and   other   supporting  documents.   Additional  information
     regarding   the   factual   allegations   contained   in   the
     Commission’s complaint may be found in Litigation Release  No.
     18654 (April 1, 2004).
     
     The    Commission    previously   instituted    administrative
     proceedings  against  Powerball’s former  auditors,  David  T.
     Thomson, CPA and David T. Thomson PC (Rel. 34-49516; File  No.
     3-11453).   [SEC v. William W. Freise, 1:04CV00531] (LR-19479;

SEC  FILES  SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT IN MUTUAL BENEFITS VIATICAL  CASE.
AGREEMENT  INCLUDES  PAYMENT  OF $25  MILLION  BY  MUTUAL  BENEFITS
PRINCIPALS AND RELIEF DEFENDANTS

     On  December 1, the Commission announced that it has agreed to
     accept  a $25 million settlement in its pending federal  civil
     action   against   former  principals   of   Mutual   Benefits
     Corporation,  Defendants Joel Steinger,  Leslie  Steinger  and
     Peter Lombardi.  The SEC’s action alleges that the Defendants,
     using  corporate relief defendants they controlled,  defrauded
     the  approximately 31,000 investors in the South Florida-based
     viatical company.  Before the settlement becomes final it must
     be  approved by U.S. District Court Judge Federico Moreno, who
     is presiding over this action.
     
     According  to  the  SEC’s complaint, filed in  May  2004,  the
     Defendants oversaw Mutual Benefits’ fraudulent sale of over $1
     billion  in viatical settlements from 1994 through 2004.   The
     Defendants deceived investors by failing to disclose (1)  that
     investors’   purported  returns  were  dependent   upon   life
     expectancy  estimates that were manipulated by  Joel  Steinger
     and  not  determined  independently  by  doctors,  (2)  Mutual
     Benefits’  used  funds from new investors to pay  premiums  on
     older  policies, and (3) that the Steingers’ were  controlling
     Mutual  Benefits and had a disciplinary history,  including  a
     prior  actions  by the SEC and the Commodities Future  Trading
     Commission.  The SEC’s action continues as to Defendant Steven
     Steiner and two relief defendants.
     
     In  settling,  each  of  the three defendants  has  agreed  to
     consent   to  the  entry  of  an  injunction  against   future
     violations of the antifraud and registration provisions of the
     federal  securities laws they were alleged  to  have  violated
     [Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act  of  1933
     and  Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934  and
     Rule  10b-5  thereunder],  without admitting  or  denying  the
     allegations.   In  addition, Joel and  Leslie  Steinger,  have
     agreed  to each pay $9 million in disgorgement and prejudgment
     interest and a $500,000 civil penalty.  Peter Lombardi, Mutual
     Benefits’  former president, has agreed to pay  $5,880,000  in
     disgorgement  and  prejudgment interest and a  $120,000  civil
     penalty.
     
     The  disgorgement amounts will be owed jointly  and  severally
     with  the relief defendants controlled by either the Steingers
     and   Lombardi:   Kensington  Management,   Rainy   Consulting
     Corporation,   Twin  Groves  Investments,  Inc.   and   P.J.L.
     Consulting Corporation.
     
     A viatical settlement is a transaction in which terminally ill
     persons sell the benefits of their life insurance policy to  a
     third  party  for an immediate discounted payment.  The  third
     party  purchaser of the policy becomes the beneficiary of  the
     life  insurance  policy  and  pays  the  premium  payments  to
     maintain  the  policy.  Upon the death of the  terminally  ill
     person  the  third  party  purchaser receives  the  full  life
     insurance benefit of policy.   [SEC v. Joel Steinger, et  al.,

SEC  OBTAINS  ORDER  FREEZING $1.4 MILLION IN INTERNATIONAL  SCHEME
THAT  DROVE  THE STOCK PRICE OF A VIRTUALLY ASSETLESS COMPANY  FROM
PENNIES TO $90 PER SHARE

     On  December 1, the Commission brought an emergency action  in
     the  U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York
     to  freeze the U.S. brokerage account of Socius Holdings  Ltd.
     (Socius), an entity incorporated in the British Virgin Islands
     and operating out of Geneva, Switzerland, that, the Commission
     alleges,  participated in the fraudulent manipulation  of  the
     stock  of  Cameron International, Inc. (“Cameron”) in  concert
     with other related individuals and entities.  The Commission’s
     request for a temporary restraining order and asset freeze was
     granted by the Honorable Judge Paul A. Crotty, who froze  $1.4
     million in Socius’ assets pending a preliminary hearing.
     
     The  Commission’s complaint alleges that from  August  through
     November  2005,  Socius, in concert with defendants  Peter  S.
     Jessop, SIGF, S.A., Steven R. Wright, International Solutions,
     Inc.,  Shawn  Casius, Logic’s Consulting,  and  other  related
     individuals  and entities, manipulated Cameron’s  stock  price
     through a series of coordinated wash sales and matched  orders
     designed to create the illusion of an active and rising market
     in Cameron and induce others to buy Cameron shares at inflated
     prices.  During this period, the defendants’ trading comprised
     the  majority, and on many days all, of the retail buying  and
     selling  of  Cameron’s  stock.   The  defendants’  coordinated
     trades drove Cameron’s share price from $.05 to $90 in a  two-
     month  period.  On November 7, 2005, the Commission  suspended
     trading  in  shares of Cameron due to a lack  of  current  and
     accurate information concerning a possible change in ownership
     of  the  company and questions regarding the dramatic rise  in
     its share price.
     
     The  complaint  charges  the  defendants  with  violations  of
     Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b)  of
     the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder,
     and  seeks, against each, disgorgement of all ill-gotten gains
     plus  prejudgment  interest, civil  penalties,  and  permanent
     injunctions  barring  future  violations  of  the   anti-fraud
     provisions  of the federal securities laws.  In addition,  the
     complaint  seeks a temporary restraining order  and  an  asset
     freeze  against Socius Holdings Ltd, and an order against  all
     defendants requiring expedited discovery.
     
     Peter  Jessop  is the sole director of Socius  and  SIGF,  two
     entities located in Geneva, Switzerland.  Steven Wright is  an
     accountant and the president of California-based International
     Solutions, Inc.  In 2003, Wright was sued by the Commission in
     connection with a similar “shell factory” manipulation scheme.

FINAL  JUDGMENT  ENTERED AGAINST JON MARPLE AND  GRATEFUL  INTERNET
ASSOCIATES, LLC

     On Nov. 29, 2005, the Honorable Dale A. Kimball, U.S. District
     Judge  for the District of Utah, entered an order against  Jon
     R.  Marple  and Grateful Internet Associates, LLC,  an  entity
     controlled  by  Marple, granting the Commission’s  motion  for
     summary judgment and permanently enjoining Marple and Grateful
     Internet  Associates from future violations of  the  antifraud
     provisions of the federal securities laws.
     
     In October 2003, the Commission filed a complaint, in the U.S.
     District  Court  for the District of Utah, against  twenty-one
     individuals  and  entities  involved  in  a  scheme  to   sell
     securities  in  five United States-based microcap  issuers  to
     hundreds of investors located primarily in the United Kingdom,
     Australia  and  New Zealand through a boiler room  located  in
     Vientiane, Laos.  Jon R. Marple worked as a consultant for  F-
     10  Oil  and  Gas Properties, Inc one of the microcap  issuers
     named  in the Complaint.  The court’s order contained findings
     that  Marple made material misrepresentations in drafting F-10
     Oil and Gas Properties, Inc. filings with the Commission.
     
     The  order  specifically enjoins Marple and Grateful  Internet
     Associates  from  future violations of Section  10(b)  of  the
     Securities  Exchange  Act of 1934 and Rule  10b-5  promulgated
     thereunder,  and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act  of  1933
     and   orders  them  to  pay  disgorgement  of  $149,487   plus
     prejudgment  interest  of $21,463.27  together  with  a  civil
     penalty of $100,000. Marple was also barred from participating
     in  any offering of penny stock.  [SEC v. David M. Wolfson, et
