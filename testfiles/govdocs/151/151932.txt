brothers and sisters, and God alone knew or knows whether or how far
they understand each other; but Saint Francis, in any case, understood
them and believed that they were in sympathy with him. As far as
the birds or wolves were concerned, it was no great matter, but Francis
did not stop with vertebrates or even with organic forms. "Nor was
it surprising," said the "Speculum," "if fire and other creatures some-
times revered and obeyed him ; for, as we who were with him very fre-
quently saw, he held them in such affection and so much delighted in
them, and his soul was moved by such pity and compassion for them,
that he would not see them roughly handled, and talked with them
with such evident delight as if they were rational beings": —

The modern tourist, having with difficulty satisfied himself that
Saint Francis acted thus in good faith, immediately exclaims that he
was a heretic and should have been burned; but, in truth, the immense
