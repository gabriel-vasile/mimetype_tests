      <P>With GRB 990123, scientists saw for the first time visible
      light emitted during a gamma-ray burst explosion. Although the
      burst was 9 billion light years away, the light was so bright
      observers on Earth could've seen it with a pair of binoculars.
      Scientists see the emission of this intense visible light as
      a clue that helps determine the structure of the explosion.</P>

      <P>The explosion of a gamma-ray burst is like a bizarre, interstellar
      traffic accident. Because material is flowing out from the explosion
      at different velocities, collisions occur.</P>

      everyone is not moving at the same speed, you get pile-ups.&quot;
      Such collisions in a gamma-ray burst create shock waves that
      generate various energy wavelengths.</P>

      <P>Three kinds of shock waves are associated with gamma-ray bursts:
      external, internal, and reverse. As the source of a gamma-ray
      burst explodes, material blows outward, creating an external
      shock wave ring traveling away from the source of the explosion.
      The impact of this fast-moving material pushing against the interstellar
      medium creates reverse shock waves. Meanwhile, matter still racing
      outward from the explosion at different speeds generates internal
      shock waves. These internal shock waves push the reverse shock
      waves outward. The reverse shock waves still appear to be traveling
      inward, however, because they are slower and colder than the
      internal shock waves.</P>

      <P>&quot;We think these reverse shock waves may be the source
      of the initial visible light emission,&quot; says Briggs.

      <P>The amount of energy released from a gamma-ray burst boggles
      the imagination. Exploding with the power of ten million billion
      suns, only collisions between objects like super-dense neutron
      stars and black holes have enough energy potential to create
      such a cataclysmic event. But no one is sure what causes a gamma-ray
      burst; the motive remains a mystery.</P>

      <P>As powerful as all gamma-ray bursts are, GRB 990123 was at
      the top 1 percent of its class. GRB 990123 was so powerful that
      scientists began to wonder if the burst was beamed rather than
      dispersed evenly, or isotropically. A beamed explosion is directed
      like a flashlight, while an isotropic explosion is dispersed
      outward like the emission from a light bulb.</P>

      <P>&quot;Beaming is actually quite common,&quot; says Dr. Charles
      Meegan, an astrophysicist at NASA/Marshall. &quot;Radio sources,
      for instance, tend to beam in specific directions.&quot;</P>

      <P>Data from the Hubble Space Telescope showed a rapid decay
      of the GRB 9990123 light curve. This data provides evidence for
      the beaming theory, because beamed light appears to dim much
      more rapidly than isotropic light.</P>

      <P>A beamed explosion would have all of its power concentrated
      to a specific area. But an isotropic burst explodes outwards
      to all points in space, so we would only see the part of the
      energy directed toward us. Isotropic explosions, therefore, are
      more powerful than they look. The calculation of a gamma-ray
      burst's total energy depends on the dynamics of the explosion
      - an isotropic explosion would be calculated to have much more
      power than a beamed burst.</P>

      <P>&quot;If gamma-ray bursts are beamed,&quot; says Meegan, &quot;then
      the energies we're seeing are less than we first thought, but
      that also means there are more of them out there that we don't
      see.&quot;</P>

      <P>If the explosions are beamed in just one direction, only those
      lying in the path of the beams would see them. That means that
      there could be gamma-ray bursts exploding all the time, but because
      the beams are focused in other directions we don't see them.</P>

      <P>But we would be able to see their afterglows, because afterglows
      are always isotropic. If we found afterglows without seeing the
      initial bursts, that would prove gamma-ray burst explosions are
      beamed.</P>

      <P>&quot;Early in the history of gamma-ray bursts, many people
      thought supernovas might be GRB afterglows,&quot; says Meegan.
      But from the thousands of gamma-ray bursts detected thus far,
      not a single one has resulted in a supernova afterglow. While
      there has been a search for supernovas coincident with gamma-ray
      bursts, there has not been a search for afterglows without gamma-ray
      bursts.</P>

      <P>&quot;Afterglows are hard to spot,&quot; says Meegan. &quot;They're
      so faint that they're just at the limit of our detection devices.
      Supernovas are easier to find because they're generally much
      brighter than GRB afterglows.&quot;</P>

      <P>Although gamma-ray bursts emit most of their energy in the
      gamma-ray part of the spectrum, they emit other wavelengths as
      well. Gamma-ray bursts were thus named because when they were
      discovered by accident in the early 1970s, they seemed to only
      emit radiation in the gamma portion of the spectrum. Scientists
      thought it was odd that the bursts appeared to only give off
      one form of energy. Most other energy sources give off several
      forms of energy simultaneously. A flame, for instance, gives
      off infrared (heat) and visible light.</P>

      <P>As it turns out, gamma-ray bursts are more than just explosions
      emitting gamma rays. Now we know that it was our ability to see,
      rather than the source, which was limited. Telescopes are only
      designed to see one part of the electromagnetic spectrum. When
      a gamma-ray telescope detects a burst, there is usually not enough
      time to direct other telescopes to look at the explosion. The
      bursts are extremely short-lived. For GRB 990123, the Robotic
      and Optical Transient Search Experiment (ROTSE) coordinated with
      the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory within 20 seconds of the start
      of the explosion - just quick enough to catch a burst in action.</P>

      <P>Although the explosion only lasts for a few seconds, the afterglow
      can linger for weeks or even months. The afterglow follows a
      path down the electromagnetic spectrum, first mostly emitting
      gamma rays, then peaking at x-rays, and so on, all the way down
      to radio waves. At this point, however, peak emissions drop off
      quickly as radio waves are absorbed back into the source. Eventually,
      the afterglow fades completely from our view.

      the explosion.</P>

      <P>Gamma-ray bursts are mysterious objects. A literal flash in
      the night, they are as fleeting and elusive as a passing thought.
      But as our ability to track these explosions improves, scientists
      can use their data to piece together an image of gamma-ray burst
      anatomy. Such knowledge will perhaps lead to a deeper understanding
      of what creates these enigmatic eruptions, and suggest why they
      occur at all.
