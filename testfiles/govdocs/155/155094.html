      <h2><font face="Arial" size="3">Abstract</font></h2>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The National Institutes of Health Consensus
      Development Conference on Noise and Hearing Loss brought together
      biomedical and behavioral scientists, health care providers, and the
      public to address the characteristics of noise-induced hearing loss,
      acoustic parameters of hazardous noise exposure, individual and
      age-specific susceptibility, and prevention strategies. Following a day
      and a half of presentations by experts and discussion by the audience, a
      consensus panel weighed the evidence and prepared a consensus statement.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Among their findings, the panel concluded
      that sounds of sufficient intensity and duration will damage the ear and
      result in temporary or permanent hearing loss at any age. Sound levels of
      less than 75 dB(A) are unlikely to cause permanent hearing loss, while
      sound levels about 85 dB(A) with exposures of 8 hours per day will produce
      permanent hearing loss after many years. Current scientific knowledge is
      inadequate to predict that any particular individual will be safe when
      exposed to a hazardous noise. Strategies to prevent damage from sound
      exposure should include the use of individual hearing protection devices,
      education programs beginning with school-age children, consumer guidance,
      increased product noise labeling, and hearing conservation programs for
      occupational settings.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The full text of the consensus panel's
      statement follows.</font></p>
      <h2><font face="Arial" size="3">Introduction</font></h2>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Hearing loss afflicts approximately 28
      million people in the United States. Approximately 10 million of these
      impairments are at least partially attributable to damage from exposure to
      loud sounds. Sounds that are sufficiently loud to damage sensitive inner
      ear structures can produce hearing loss that is not reversible by any
      presently available medical or surgical treatment. Hearing impairment
      associated with noise exposure can occur at any age, including early
      infancy, and is often characterized by difficulty in understanding speech
      and the potentially troublesome symptom, tinnitus (i.e., ringing in the
      ears). Very loud sounds of short duration, such as an explosion or
      gunfire, can produce immediate, severe, and permanent loss of hearing.
      Longer exposure to less intense but still hazardous sounds, commonly
      encountered in the workplace or in certain leisure time activities, exacts
      a gradual toll on hearing sensitivity, initially without the victim's
      awareness. More than 20 million Americans are exposed on a regular basis
      to hazardous noise levels that could result in hearing loss. Occupational
      noise exposure, the most common cause of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL),
      threatens the hearing of firefighters, police officers, military
      personnel, construction and factory workers, musicians, farmers, and truck
      drivers, to name a few. Live or recorded high-volume music, recreational
      vehicles, airplanes, lawn-care equipment, woodworking tools, some
      household appliances, and chain saws are examples of nonoccupational
      sources of potentially hazardous noise. One important feature of NIHL is
      that it is preventable in all but certain cases of accidental exposure.
      Legislation and regulations have been enacted that spell out guidelines
      for protecting workers from hazardous noise levels in the workplace and
      consumers from hazardous noise during leisure time pursuits. Inconsistent
      compliance and spotty enforcement of existing governmental regulations
      have been the underlying cause for their relative ineffectiveness in
      achieving prevention of NIHL. A particularly unfortunate occurrence was
      the elimination of the Office of Noise Abatement and Control within the
      Environmental Protection Agency in 1982.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">On January 22-24, 1990, the National
      Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, together with the
      Office of Medical Applications of Research of the National Institutes of
      Health, convened a Consensus Development Conference on Noise and Hearing
      Loss. Cosponsors of the conference were the National Institute of Child
      Health and Human Development, the National Institute on Aging, and the
      National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health of the Centers for
      Disease Control. The effects of environmental sounds on human listeners
      may include:</font>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="3">Interference with speech communication
          and other auditory signals.</font>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="3">Annoyance and aversion.</font>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="3">Noise-induced hearing loss.</font>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="3">Changes in various body systems.</font>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="3">Interference with sleep.</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">This conference was entirely centered on
      NIHL. The panel focused on five questions related to noise and hearing
      loss:</font>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="3">What is noise-induced hearing loss?</font>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="3">What sounds can damage hearing?</font>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="3">What factors, including age, determine
          an individual's susceptibility to noise-induced hearing loss?</font>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="3">What can be done to prevent
          noise-induced hearing loss?</font>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="3">What are the directions for future
          research?</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Following a day and a half of presentations
      by experts in the relevant fields and discussion from the audience, a
      consensus panel comprising specialists and generalists from the medical
      and other related scientific disciplines, together with public
      representatives, considered the evidence and formulated a consensus
      statement in response to the five previously stated questions.<br>
      &nbsp;</font></p>
      <h2><font face="Arial" size="3">What is Noise-Induced Hearing Loss?</font></h2>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Sounds of sufficient intensity and duration
      will damage the ear and result in temporary or permanent hearing loss. The
      hearing loss may range from mild to profound and may also result in
      tinnitus. The effect of repeated sound overstimulation is cumulative over
      a lifetime and is not currently treatable. Hearing impairment has a major
      impact on one's communication ability and even mild impairment may
      adversely affect the quality of life. Unfortunately, although NIHL is
      preventable, our increasingly noisy environment places more and more
      people at risk.</font></p>
      <SS1>
      <h4><font face="Arial" size="3">Studies of NIHL</font></h4>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Most studies of the association between
      sound exposure and hearing loss in humans are retrospective measurements
      of the hearing sensitivities of numerous individuals correlated with their
      noise exposures. The variability within these studies is usually large;
      thus, it is difficult to predict the precise magnitude of hearing loss
      that will result from a specific sound exposure. Prospective studies of
      selected workers' hearing levels over a long time while their sound
      exposures are carefully monitored are costly and time-consuming and, due
      to attrition, require a large number of subjects. When significant hearing
      loss is found, for ethical reasons, exposures must be reduced, interfering
      with the relationships under study. Although studies of NIHL in humans are
      difficult, they provide valuable information not available from animal
      studies and should be continued.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">In prospective animal studies, sound
      exposures can be carefully controlled, and the anatomic and physiologic
      correlates of NIHL can be precisely defined. Although there may be
      interspecies differences with respect to the absolute sound exposure that
      will injure the ear, the basic mechanisms that lead to damage appear to be
      similar in all mammalian ears.</font></p>
      </SS1>
      <SS1>
      <h4><font face="Arial" size="3">Anatomic and Physiologic Correlates of
      NIHL</font></h4>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Two types of injury are recognized:
      acoustic trauma and NIHL. Short-duration sound of sufficient intensity
      (e.g., a gunshot or explosion) may result in an immediate, severe, and
      permanent hearing loss, which is termed acoustic trauma. Virtually all of
      the structures of the ear can be damaged, in particular the organ of Corti,
      the delicate sensory structure of the auditory portion of the inner ear
      (cochlea), which may be torn apart.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Moderate exposure may initially cause
      temporary hearing loss, termed temporary threshold shift (TTS). Structural
      changes associated with TTS have not been fully established but may
      include subtle intracellular changes in the sensory cells (hair cells) and
      swelling of the auditory nerve endings. Other potentially reversible
      effects include vascular changes, metabolic exhaustion, and chemical
      changes within the hair cells. There is also evidence of a regional
      decrease in the stiffness of the stereocilia (the hair bundles at the top
      of the hair cells), which may recover. This decrease in stereocilia
      stiffness may lead to a decrease in the coupling of sound energy to the
      hair cells, which thereby alters hearing sensitivity.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Repeated exposure to sounds that cause TTS
      may gradually cause permanent NIHL in experimental animals. In this type
      of injury, cochlear blood flow may be impaired, and a few scattered hair
      cells are damaged with each exposure. With continued exposure, the number
      of damaged hair cells increases. Although most structures in the inner ear
      can be harmed by excessive sound exposure, the sensory cells are the most
      vulnerable. Damage to the stereocilia is often the first change,
      specifically, alteration of the rootlet structures that normally anchor
      the stereocilia into the top of the hair cell. Once destroyed, the sensory
      cells are not replaced. During the recovery period between some sound
      exposures, damaged regions of the organ of Corti heal by scar formation.
      This process is very important because it reestablishes the barrier
      between the two fluids of the inner ear (perilymph and endolymph). If this
      barrier is not reestablished, degeneration of hair cells may continue.
      Further, once a sufficient number of hair cells are lost, the nerve fibers
      to that region also degenerate. With degeneration of the cochlear nerve
      fibers, there is corresponding degeneration within the central nervous
      system. The extent to which these neural changes contribute to NIHL is not
      clear.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">With moderate periods of exposure to
      potentially hazardous high-frequency sound, the damage is usually confined
      to a restricted area in the high-frequency region of the cochlea. With a
      comparable exposure to low-frequency noise, hair cell damage is not
      confined to the low-frequency region but may also affect the
      high-frequency regions. The predominance of damage in different cochlear
      regions with different frequency exposures reflects factors such as the
      resonance of the ear canal, the middle-ear transfer characteristics, and
      the mechanical characteristics of the organ of Corti and basilar membrane.</font></p>
      </SS1>
      <SS1>
      <h4><font face="Arial" size="3">Assessment of NIHL</font></h4>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Hearing loss is measured by determining
      auditory thresholds (sensitivity) at various frequencies (pure-tone
      audiometry). Complete assessment should also include measures of speech
      understanding and middle-ear status (immittance audiometry). Pure-tone
      audiometry is also used in industrial hearing conservation programs to
      determine whether adequate protection against hazardous sound levels is
      provided.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The first audiometric sign of NIHL
      resulting from broadband noise is usually a loss of sensitivity in the
      higher frequencies from 3,000 through 6,000 Hertz (Hz) (i.e., cycles per
      second), resulting in a characteristic audiometric &quot;notch.&quot; With
      additional hearing loss from noise or aging, the threshold at 8,000 Hz may
      worsen and eliminate this characteristic audiometric pattern. Thus, the
      presence or absence of NIHL cannot be established on the basis of
      audiometric shape, per se. The hearing loss is usually bilateral, but some
      degree of asymmetry is not unusual, especially with lateralized noise
      sources such as rifles. After moderate sound exposure, TTS may occur, and,
      during a period of relative quiet, thresholds will return to normal
      levels. If the exposure continues on a regular basis, permanent threshold
      shifts (PTS) will result, increasing in magnitude and extending to lower
      and higher frequencies. If the exposures continue, NIHL increases, more
      rapidly in the early years. After many years of exposure, NIHL levels off
      in the high frequencies, but continues to worsen in the low frequencies.
      Although TTS and PTS are correlated, the relation is not strong enough to
      use TTS to predict the magnitude of permanent hearing loss.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">An important consequence of the sensitivity
      loss associated with NIHL is difficulty in understanding speech. Whereas a
      large proportion of the <i>energy</i> in speech is contained within the
      low-frequency range, much of the <i>information</i> required to
      differentiate one speech sound from another is contained within the higher
      frequencies. With significant hearing loss in the high frequencies,
      important speech information is often inaudible or unusable. Other
      interfering sounds such as background noise, competing voices, or room
      reverberation may reduce even further the hearing-impaired listener's
      receptive communication ability. The presence of tinnitus may be an
      additional debilitating condition.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">NIHL may interfere with daily life,
      especially those social activities that occur in noisy settings. Increased
      effort is required for understanding speech in these situations, which
      leads to fatigue, anxiety, and stress. Decreased participation in these
      activities often results, affecting not only hearing-impaired individuals
      but also friends and family members. Hearing loss is associated with
      depression in the elderly and may be related to dementia and cognitive
      dysfunction. Systematic study of the effects of hearing loss on the
      quality of life have only lately focused specifically on individuals with
      NIHL; therefore, continued studies of this kind are desirable.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The impairment in hearing ability resulting
      from NIHL may vary from mild to severe. An individual's ability to
      communicate and function in daily life varies with the degree of loss and
      the individual's communication needs although these relationships are
      complex. The magnitude of the effect on communication ability may be
      estimated by a variety of scales, which are often used in disability
      determinations. These scales, which vary substantially in the frequencies
      used, the upper and lower limits of impairment, age correction, and
      adjustment for asymmetric hearing loss, attempt to predict the degree of
      communication impairment (understanding of speech) on the basis of
      pure-tone thresholds. There is no consensus about the validity or utility
      of the scales, which scale should be used, whether measures of speech
      understanding should be included, or whether self-assessment ratings

      <h2><font face="Arial" size="3">What Sounds Can Damage Hearing?</font></h2>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Some sounds are so weak physically that
      they are not heard. Some sounds are audible but do not have any temporary
      or permanent after-effects. Some sounds are strong enough to produce a
      temporary hearing loss from which there may appear to be complete
      recovery. Damaging sounds are those that are sufficiently strong,
      sufficiently long-lasting, and involve appropriate frequencies so that
      permanent hearing loss will ensue.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Most of the sounds in the environment that
      produce such permanent effects occur over a very long time (for example,
      about 8 hours per workday over a period of 10 or more years). On the other
      hand, there are some particularly abrupt or explosive sounds that can
      cause damage even with a single exposure.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The line between these categories of sounds
      cannot be stated simply because not all persons respond to sound in the
      same manner. Thus, if a sound of given frequency bandwidth, level, and
      duration is considered hazardous, one must specify for what proportion of
      the population it will be hazardous and, within that proportion, by what
      criterion of damage (whether anatomical, audiometric, speech
      understanding) it is hazardous.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The most widely used measure of a sound's
      strength or amplitude is called &quot;sound level,&quot; measured by a
      sound-level meter in units called &quot;decibels&quot; (dB). For example,
      the sound level of speech at typical conversational distances is between
      65 and 70 dB. There are weaker sounds, still audible, and of course much
      stronger sounds. Those above 85 dB are potentially hazardous.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Sounds must also be specified in terms of
      frequency or bandwidth, roughly like the span of keys on a piano. The
      range of audible frequencies extends from about 20 Hz, below the lowest
      notes on a piano, to at least 16,000 or 20,000 Hz, well above the highest
      notes on a piccolo. Most environmental noises include a wide band of
      frequencies and, by convention, are measured through the &quot;A&quot;
      filter in the sound-level meter and thus are designated in dB(A) units. It
      is not clear what effect, if any, sound outside the frequency range
      covered in dB(A) measurements may have on hearing. At this time, it is not
      known whether ultrasonic vibration will damage hearing.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">To define what sounds can damage hearing,
      sound level, whether across all frequency bands or taken band by band, is
      not enough. The duration of exposure--typical for a day and accumulated
      over many years--is critical. Sound levels associated with particular
      sources such as snowmobiles, rock music, and chain saws, are often cited,
      but predicting the likelihood of NIHL from such sources also requires
      knowledge of typical durations and the number of exposures.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">There appears to be reasonable agreement
      that sound levels below 75 dB(A) will not engender a permanent hearing
      loss, even at 4000 Hz. At higher levels, the amount of hearing loss is
      directly related to sound level for comparable durations.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">According to some existing rules and
      regulations, a noise level of 85 dB(A) for an 8-hour daily exposure is
      potentially damaging. If total sound energy were the important predictor,
      an equivalent exposure could be as high as 88 dB(A) if restricted to 4
      hours. (A 3-dB increase is equivalent to doubling the sound intensity.)
      This relation, enshrined in some standards and regulations, is a theory
      based on a dose or exposure defined by total energy.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">In spite of the physical simplicity of a
      total-energy concept, other principles have been invoked to define
      equivalent exposures of different sound levels and durations. Early
      research suggested that NIHL after 10 years could be predicted from
      temporary threshold shifts (TTS) measured 2 minutes after a comparable
      single-day exposure. Those results, however, were taken to indicate that a
      halving of duration could be offset by a 5-dB change in sound level rather
      than a 3-dB change. This 5-dB rule is implemented in the Walsh-Healey Act
      of 1969 and subsequent Occupational Safety and Health Administration
      regulations for the purpose of requiring preventive efforts for
      noise-exposed workers. The 3-dB trading rule is agreed to in International
      Standards Organization (ISO) Standard 1999.2 (1989) for the purpose of
      predicting the amount of noise-induced hearing loss resulting from
      different exposures. There is no consensus concerning a single rule to be
      used for all purposes in the United States.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Generally, for sound levels below about 140
      dB, different temporal forms of sound, whether impulse (gunshot), impact
      (drop forge) or steady state (turbine), when specified with respect to
      their level and duration, produce the same hearing loss. This does not
      appear to follow at levels above 140 dB, where impulse noise creates more
      damage than would be predicted. This may imply that impulse noise above a
      certain critical level results in acoustic trauma from which the ear
      cannot recover.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Although sound exposures that are
      potentially hazardous to hearing are usually defined in terms of sound
      level, frequency bandwidths, and duration, there are several simple
      approximations that indicate that a sound exposure may be suspected as
      hazardous. These include the following: If the sound is appreciably louder
      than conversational level, it is potentially harmful, provided that the
      sound is present for a sufficient period of time. Hazardous noise may also
      be suspected if the listener experiences: (a) difficulty in communication
      while in the sound, (b) ringing in the ear (tinnitus) after exposure to
      the sound, and/or (c) the experience that sounds seem muffled after
      leaving the sound-exposure area.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">In the consideration of sounds that can
      damage hearing, one point is clear: it is the acoustic energy of the sound
      reaching the ear, not its source, which is important. That is, it does not
      matter if the hazardous sound is generated by a machine in the workplace,
      by an amplifier/loudspeaker at a rock concert, or by a snowmobile ridden
      by the listener. Significant amounts of acoustic energy reaching the ear
      will create damage--at work, at school, at home, or during leisure
      activities. Although there has been a tendency to concentrate on the more
      significant occupational and transportation noise, the same rules apply to
      all potential noise hazards.<br>

      <h2><font face="Arial" size="3">What Factors, Including Age, Determine an
      Individual's Susceptibility to Noise-Induced Hearing Loss?</font></h2>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">One thoroughly established characteristic
      of NIHL is that, on the average, more intense and longer-duration noise
      exposures cause more severe hearing loss. A second is that there is a
      remarkably broad range of individual differences in sensitivity to any
      given noise exposure. Several factors have been proposed to explain
      differences in NIHL among individuals; others may be associated with
      differences over time within the same individual. It is important to
      distinguish those factors whose roles in determining susceptibility are
      supported by a consistent body of theory and empirical evidence from other
      factors whose roles have been proposed but for which theory, data, or both
      are less conclusive.</font></p>
      <SS1>
      <h4><font face="Arial" size="3">Differences Among Individuals</font></h4>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Both temporary threshold shift (TTS) and
      permanent threshold shift (PTS) in response to a given intense noise may
      differ as much as 30 to 50 dB among individuals. Both animal research and
      retrospective studies of humans exposed to industrial noise have
      demonstrated this remarkable variation in susceptibility. The biological
      bases for these differences are unknown. A number of extrinsic factors
      (e.g., characteristics of the ear canal and middle ear, drugs, and prior
      exposure to noise) may influence an individual's susceptibility to NIHL.
      However, animal studies that have controlled these variables suggest that
      individual differences in inner ear anatomy and physiology also may be
      significant. Additional research is necessary to determine whether
      vascular, neural feedback (efferent system), or other mechanisms can
      account for and predict such individual variation.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">One factor that may be associated with
      decreased susceptibility to NIHL is conductive hearing loss; the cochlear
      structures may be protected by any form of acoustic attenuation. For
      similar reasons, middle ear muscles, which normally serve a protective
      function by contracting in response to intense sound, when inoperative,
      can result in increased susceptibility. Among the other factors that are <i>theoretically</i>
      associated with differences in susceptibility are (a) unusually efficient
      acoustic transfer through the external and middle ear, as a determinant of
      the amount of energy coupled to the inner ear structures, and (b)
      preexisting hearing loss, which could imply that less additional loss
      would occur if the sensitive structures have already been damaged. Support
      for these hypotheses has been modest, in the case of the transfer
      function, because little empirical work has been done to test that
      hypothesis, and, in the case of reduced sensitivity, because several
      studies disagree. In general, when there is a difference in average loss
      to a given noise exposure, those ears with previous PTS or TTS have shown
      somewhat less additional loss than those not previously exposed.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Findings have sometimes implicated degree
      of pigmentation, both of the receptor structures (melanization) and of the
      eye and skin, as related to susceptibility. However, these results too are
      equivocal.</font></p>
      <SS2>
      <h4><font face="Arial" size="3">Gender</font></h4>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">There is little difference in hearing
      thresholds between young male and female children. Between ages 10 and 20,
      males begin to show reduced high-frequency auditory sensitivity relative
      to females. Women continue to demonstrate better hearing than men into
      advanced age. These gender differences are probably due to greater
      exposure of males to noise rather than to their inherent susceptibility to
      its effects.</font></p>
      </SS2>
      </SS1>
      <SS1>
      <h4><font face="Arial" size="3">Differences Within Individuals</font></h4>
      <SS2>
      <h4><font face="Arial" size="3">Ototoxic drugs</font></h4>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Among the causes of differences of
      susceptibility to noise exposure <i>within</i> individuals are ototoxic
      drugs and other chemicals. In animal research, certain antibiotics (aminoglycosides)
      appear to exacerbate the damaging effects of noise exposure. Clinical
      evidence of corresponding effects in human patients has not been
      established, but precautions should be taken with regard to noise
      exposures of individual patients treated with these medications. Although
      high doses of aspirin are widely known to cause TTS and tinnitus, aspirin
      has <i>not</i> been shown to increase susceptibility to NIHL.</font></p>
      </SS2>
      <SS2>
      <h4><font face="Arial" size="3">Age</font></h4>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">In certain animal models there is evidence
      of heightened susceptibility to noise exposure shortly after birth--a
      &quot;critical period&quot; (possibly following the time when fluids fill
      the middle ear but before complete development of the cochlear
      structures). However, it is <i>not</i> clear that data from such animal
      models can be generalized to full-term normal human infants. Premature
      infants in noisy environments (e.g. neonatal intensive care units),
      however, may be at risk</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">At the other extreme, increasing age has
      been hypothesized to be associated with decreasing susceptibility. This
      contention is based on the existence of presbycusis, hearing loss that
      increases with age and that is <i>not</i> known to be attributable to
      excessive noise exposure or other known etiology. The typical levels of
      presbycusis at various ages have recently been incorporated as Annex A in
      International Standards Organization Standard 1999.2 (1989). That standard
      may be used to estimate the portion of overall hearing loss that is
      attributable to exposure to excessive noise.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">In summary, scientific knowledge is
      currently inadequate to predict that any individual will be safe in noise
      that exceeds established damage-risk criteria, nor that specific
      individuals will show greater-than-average loss following a given
      exposure. Among the many proposed explanations, the hypothesis that the
      resonant and transmission properties of the external and middle ear affect
      individual susceptibility deserves further attention. Empirical support
      for this hypothesis should not be difficult to obtain, but very few data
      have been collected on this question, both for TTS (experimentally) and
      PTS (retrospectively). Differences in susceptibility of the cochlear
      structures to NIHL may exist, but no practical approach to predicting them
      is yet available. Identification of susceptible humans will almost
      certainly be delayed until a successful animal model is available.<br>

      <h2><font face="Arial" size="3">What Can Be Done To Prevent Noise-Induced
      Hearing Loss?</font></h2>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Noise-induced hearing loss occurs every
      day--in both occupational and nonoccupational settings. The crucial
      questions for prevention are as follows: (1) What can individuals do to
      protect themselves from NIHL? (2) What role should others, such as
      educators, employers, or the Government, play in preventing NIHL? (3) What
      general strategies should be employed to prevent NIHL? Answers to these
      questions have long been known, but solutions have not been effectively
      implemented in many cases. As a result, many people have needlessly
      suffered hearing loss.</font></p>
      <SS1>
      <h4><font face="Arial" size="3">Individual Protection Strategies</font></h4>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Hearing conservation must begin by
      providing each individual with basic information. NIHL is insidious,
      permanent, and irreparable, causing communication interference that can
      substantially affect the quality of life. Ringing in the ears and muffling
      of sounds after sound exposure are indicators of potential hazard.
      Dangerous sound exposures can cause significant damage without pain, and
      hearing aids do not restore normal hearing. Individuals should become
      aware of loud noise situations and avoid them if possible or properly use
      hearing protection. It is important to recognize that both the level of
      the noise and its duration (i.e., exposure) contribute to the overall
      risk. Certain noises, such as explosions, may cause immediate permanent
      damage.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Many sources, such as guns, power tools,
      chain saws, small airplanes, farm vehicles, firecrackers, some types of
      toys, and some medical and dental instruments may produce dangerous
      exposures. Music concerts, car and motorcycle races, and other spectator
      events often produce sound levels that warrant hearing protection.
      Similarly, some stereo headphones and loudspeakers are capable of
      producing hazardous exposures. Parents should exercise special care in
      supervising the use of personal headset listening devices, and adults and
      children alike should learn to operate them at safe volume settings.</font></p>
      </SS1>
      <SS1>
      <h4><font face="Arial" size="3">Nonoccupational Strategies</font></h4>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Hearing loss from nonoccupational noise is
      common, but public awareness of the hazard is low. Educational programs
      should be targeted toward children, parents, hobby groups, public role
      models, and professionals in influential positions such as teachers,
      physicians, audiologists and other health care professionals, engineers,
      architects, and legislators. In particular, primary health care physicians
      and educators who deal with young people should be targeted through their
      professional organizations. Consumers need guidance and product noise
      labeling to assist them in purchasing quieter devices and in implementing
      exposure reduction strategies. The public should be made aware of the
      availability of affordable, effective hearing protectors (ear plugs, ear
      muffs, and canal caps). Hearing protection manufacturers should supply
      comprehensive instructions concerning proper protector use and also be
      encouraged to increase device availability to the public sector. Newborn
      nurseries, including neonatal intensive care units, should be made
      quieter. Medical and dental personnel should be trained to educate their
      patients about NIHL.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Individuals with significant noise exposure
      need counseling. Basic audiometric evaluations should be widely available.
      The goal is to detect early noise-induced damage and interrupt its
      progression <i>before</i> hearing thresholds exceed the normal range.</font></p>
      </SS1>
      <SS1>
      <h4><font face="Arial" size="3">Occupational Strategies</font></h4>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Hearing conservation programs for
      occupational settings must include the following interactive components:
      sound surveys to assess the degree of hazardous noise exposure,
      engineering and administrative noise controls to reduce exposures,
      education to inform at-risk individuals why and how to prevent hearing
      loss, hearing protection devices (earplugs, earmuffs, and canal caps) to
      reduce the sound reaching the ear, and audiometric evaluations to detect
      hearing changes. Governmental regulations that currently apply to most
      noisy industries should be revised to encompass <i>all</i> industries and
      all employees, strengthened in certain requirements, and strictly enforced
      with more inspections and more severe penalties for violations.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Many existing hearing conservation programs
      remain ineffective due to poor organization and inadequately trained
      program staff. Senior management must use available noise controls,
      purchase quieter equipment, and incorporate noise reduction in planning
      new facilities. Noise exposures must be measured accurately and the degree
      of hazard communicated to employees. Hearing protection devices must be
      available that are comfortable, practical for the demands of work tasks,
      and provide adequate attenuation. Labeled ratings of hearing protector
      attenuation must be more realistic so that the degree of protection
      achieved in the workplace can be properly estimated. Each employee must be
      individually fitted with protectors and trained in their correct use and
      care. Employees need feedback about their audiometric monitoring results
      annually.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Employers need to monitor program
      effectiveness by using appropriate techniques for analysis of group
      audiometric data. By detecting problem areas, managers can prioritize
      resource allocations and modify company policies to achieve effectiveness.
      Potential benefits include reduced costs for worker's compensation,
      enhanced worker morale, reduced absenteeism, fewer accidents, and greater
      productivity.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Enactment of uniform regulations for
      awarding worker's compensation for occupational hearing loss would
      stimulate employers' interest in achieving effective hearing conservation
      programs. Equitable criteria for compensability should be developed based
      on scientific investigations of the difficulties in communication and
      other aspects of auditory function encountered in everyday life by persons
      with differing degrees of NIHL.</font></p>
      </SS1>
      <SS1>
      <h4><font face="Arial" size="3">General Strategies</font></h4>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Both nonoccupational and occupational NIHL
      could be reduced by implementing broader preventive efforts. Labeling of
      consumer product noise emission levels should be enforced according to
      existing regulations. Incentives for manufacturers to design quieter
      industrial equipment and consumer goods are needed along with regulations
      governing the maximum emission levels of certain consumer products, such
      as power tools. Reestablishment of a Federal agency coordinating committee
      with central responsibility for practical solutions to noise issues is
      essential. Model community ordinances could promote local planning to
      control environmental noise and, where feasible, noise levels at certain
      spectator events. High-visibility media campaigns are needed to develop
      public awareness of the effects of noise on hearing and the means for
      self-protection. Prevention of NIHL should be part of the health curricula
      in elementary through high schools. Self-education materials for adults
      should be readily available.<br>

          many years.</font>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="3">There is a broad range of individual
          differences among people in the amount of hearing loss each suffers as
          a result of identical exposures.</font>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="3">Current scientific knowledge is
          inadequate to predict that any particular individual will be safe when
          exposed to a hazardous noise.</font>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="3">Because sources of potentially hazardous
          sound are present in both occupational and nonoccupational settings,
          personal hearing protection should be used when hazardous exposures
          are unavoidable.</font>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="3">Vigorous enforcement of existing
          regulations, particularly for the workplace and consumer product
          labeling, would significantly reduce the risk of workplace NIHL.
          Regulations should be broadened to encompass all employees with
          hazardous noise exposures.</font>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="3">Application of existing technologies for
          source noise control, especially in the manufacture of new equipment
          and construction of new facilities, would significantly reduce sound
          levels at the ear.</font>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="3">In addition to existing hearing
          conservation programs, a comprehensive program of education regarding
          the causes and prevention of NIHL should be developed and
          disseminated, with specific attention directed toward educating
          school-age children.</font></li>
