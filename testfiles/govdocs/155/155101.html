<h2>A Volunteer Fire Fighter and Volunteer Assistant Lieutenant Die After a Smoke Explosion at a Town 
House Complex - Wyoming</h2>
<h3>SUMMARY</h3>
<p>On April 18, 2005, a 23-year-old male volunteer fire fighter (Victim #1) and 
  a 39-year-old male volunteer Assistant Lieutenant (Victim #2) died after a smoke 
  explosion at a town house complex. Both victims were in the first apparatus 
  to arrive on the scene and were advised that there were children inside on the 
  second floor of the fire unit. The victims made entry into the structure and 
  proceeded to the second floor with a charged hoseline. Within minutes, Victim 
  #2 returned to the front door to request a thermal imaging camera and returned 
  to the second floor just as another crew prepared to provide back-up. As the 
  back-up crew entered the front door an explosion occurred forcing them back 
  down the porch stairs and entrapping the victims in the bedroom on the second 
  floor. The fire, which intensified after the explosion, had to be knocked down 
  before the victims could be recovered. NIOSH investigators concluded that, to 
  minimize the risk of similar occurrences, fire departments should:</p>
<ul>
  <li>develop and enforce standard operating procedures (SOPs) for structural 
    fire fighting that include, but are not limited to, the incident command system, 
    accountability, ventilation, and emergency evacuation<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>ensure that the Incident Commander completes a size-up of the incident and 
    continuously evaluates the risk versus benefit during the entire operation 
    <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>ensure that adequate numbers of staff are available to immediately respond 
    to emergency incidents<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>ensure that the Incident Commander maintains the role of director of fireground 
    operations and does not become directly involved in firefighting operations<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>ensure that the Incident Commander is clearly identified as the only individual 
    with overall authority for management of all activities at an incident <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>ensure that fire fighters are trained to identify truss roof systems and 
    their potential hazards</li>
</ul>

<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p> On April 18, 2005, a 23-year-old male volunteer fire fighter (Victim #1) and 
  a 39-year-old male volunteer Assistant Lieutenant (Victim #2) died after a smoke 
  explosion at a town house complex. On April 19, 2005, the U.S. Fire Administration 
  (USFA) notified the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) 
  of the fatalities. On May 22 through May 26, 2005, a Safety and Occupational 
  Health Specialist, a Safety Engineer, and a General Engineer from the NIOSH 
  Division of Safety Research investigated the incident. Meetings were conducted 
  with the lead Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) investigator and officers 
  of the fire department. Interviews were conducted with a representative from 
  the State Fire Marshal&#8217;s Office and officers and fire fighters who were 
  at the incident scene. The NIOSH investigators reviewed the ATF&#8217;s report, 
  the State Fire Marshal&#8217;s report, the department&#8217;s standard operating 
  procedures (SOPs), the fire department&#8217;s incident report, the victims&#8217; 
  training records, photographs and drawings of the site. The incident site was 
  visited and photographed. </p>
<p><span class="boldunderline">Department</span><br>
  The combination department involved in this incident is comprised of 4 career 
  and 55 volunteer fire fighters who operate out of four stations. The department 
  serves a population of approximately 15,000 residents in a geographic area of 
  about 2,200 square miles.</p>
<p><span class="boldunderline">Training</span><br>
  The State of Wyoming does not require any specialized training for its fire 
  fighters. The department requires that all fire fighters receive their certification 
  for Fire Fighter I and Fire Fighter II through the protocol and testing provided 
  by the State. Victim #1 was National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Level 
  I- and Level II-certified, and had also received training for Hazardous Materials 
  (HazMat). He had more than 2 years of fire-fighting experience. Victim #2 was 
  NFPA Level I- and Level II-certified, and he had also received other training 
  including HazMat, Wildland Fire Fighting, Emergency Medical Technician, Fire 
  Instructor I, and Flashover. He had more than 11 years of fire-fighting experience.</p>
<p><span class="boldunderline">Units for Initial Alarm</span><br>
  Multiple units were dispatched to this incident; however, only those directly 
  involved in operations preceding the fatal event are discussed in the investigation 
  section of this report:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Engine 1 (Captain/driver, Victim #1, Victim #2)<br>
    Engine 2 (Driver/operator, 3 fire fighters)<br>
    Ladder 1 (Lieutenant/driver, 2 fire fighters)<br>
    Privately Owned Vehicle (POV) [Lieutenant/Incident Commander (IC)]<br>
    POV [Lieutenant (Lt. #1)]<br>
    POV [Lieutenant (Lt. #2)]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="boldunderline">Weather</span><br>
  The conditions were clear with strong winds gusting to over 30 mph and temperatures 
  averaging 42-degrees Fahrenheit. The average humidity was 61 percent. </p>
<p><span class="boldunderline">Structure</span><br>
  The structure was a tri-level town house with two levels above ground and a 
  daylight basement which extended above-ground in the rear of the structure. 
  It was located on the northern end of a five unit town house complex. The residence 
  was of ordinary construction which encompassed approximately 1,600 square feet 
  that was built in the 1980s. The residence had smoke detectors that were working 
  at the time of the fire.</p>
<p>The area of fire origin was in a storage area behind a knee wall in the bedroom 
  on the upper floor. The bedroom was the only major room on the second floor 
  and was framed by room-in-attic trusses. This construction allowed the storage 
  areas behind the knee walls to connect to the attic space above. The void space 
  provided by the room-in-attic trusses allowed the bedroom to be surrounded by 
  the fire and hot gases.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>INVESTIGATION</h3>
<p>At approximately 1510 hours Central Dispatch received a call of a structure 
  fire and paged out the local fire department. A Lieutenant who arrived in his 
  personally owned vehicle (POV) at the rear of the structure assumed Incident 
  Command (IC) at 1514 hours just as Engine 1 (E1) arrived on the scene. E1 was 
  the first apparatus to arrive on the scene and was advised by a neighbor that 
  there were children inside on the second floor of the fire unit. Engine 1 was 
  positioned in front of the unit, which was on the east side of the complex, 
  and reported to Central Dispatch that smoke was showing. The Captain and both 
  victims from E1 prepared to make entry to search for the trapped children. The 
  Captain, who did not have his bunker gear, pulled the 200-foot 1-&frac34;-inch 
  pre-connect from E1 as Victim #1 and Victim #2 donned their self contained breathing 
  apparatuses (SCBA) and prepared to make entry. The Captain noticed small flames 
  coming from the roof peak near the front side of the chimney chase on the D-side 
  of the structure. He also noted light colored smoke seeping from the roof shingles 
  of the fire unit and smoke from the attic area of the adjacent unit. </p>
<p>The IC was staged at the rear of the structure and assisted setting up Ladder 
  1 (L1) when they arrived on the scene at 1516 hours. He noticed smoke coming 
  from the two end units and a small amount of flames were coming from the roof 
  of the fire unit where the two units met (<a href="#photo1">Photo 1</a>). </p>
<p>The Captain returned to E1 and charged the line. The victims made entry into 
  the structure and proceeded to the second floor with a charged hoseline. The 
  Captain then requested another Lieutenant (Lt. #1), who arrived in his POV as 
  the Safety Officer, to operate the pump. He also requested another fire fighter 
  to get the positive pressure ventilation (PPV) fan off of E1 and set it up at 
  the front door of the unit. The Captain took a 24-foot extension ladder from 
  E1 to the D-side of the complex to find a second-floor window to assist ventilation 
  as his crew made entry through the front door. The Captain did not find a window 
  on the second floor on the D-side, but there was a skylight in the roof of the 
  C-side or rear of the unit (<a href="#diagram1">Diagram 1</a> and <a href="#photo2">Photo 
  2</a>). He returned to the front of the structure and saw that Victim #2 was 
  at the front door requesting the thermal imaging camera (TIC). The Captain retrieved 
  the TIC from E1 and gave it to Victim #2. </p>
<p>Just after Engine 2 (E2) arrived at 1518 hours, another Lieutenant (Lt. #2) 
  who responded in his POV joined a fire fighter from E2 to provide back-up at 
  the front of the structure with an 1-&frac34;- inch pre-connect the fire fighter 
  pulled off of E1. Heavy brown smoke was filtering down the stairs and out the 
  front door at this time. <em>Note: At approximately 1520 hours the IC at the 
  rear of the structure received information and reports from bystanders that 
  the kids were out of the fire unit. This transmission was never acknowledged 
  by any of the crews at the front of the structure conducting interior operations. 
  At this time command was transferred to another officer arriving on the scene; 
  however, the new IC did not have direct involvement in the incident preceding 
  the fatal event.</em></p>
<p>The back-up crew made their way up the porch stairs to the stair landing just 
  inside the structure and radioed for the line to be charged at approximately 
  1521 hours. The Captain was walking around to the back and had just passed the 
  first floor window on the D-side of the fire unit when the explosion blew out 
  the window directly behind him at 1522 hours (<a href="#diagram2">Diagram 2</a> 
  and <a href="#photo3">Photo 3</a>). The Captain immediately attempted to contact 
  the entry team by radio and did not get a response. </p>
<p>The Captain returned to the front of the structure where the explosion had 
  blown the back-up crew out of the front door and down the porch stairs. Thick 
  black smoke and heavy fire was coming out of the front door. The back-up crew 
  re-entered the structure and made it up three steps and attempted to follow 
  the victims&#8217; handline to the second floor. The heat and flame conditions 
  on the stairway were so intense that the back-up crew was forced to exit. Lieutenant 
  #2 ordered fire fighters to flow water through the D-side window on the first 
  floor, which was fully involved, and then he proceeded to the rear of the structure. 
</p>
<p>Lieutenant #2 met the Captain and another fire fighter at the rear entrance. 
  The Captain informed them that they had two members down and possible occupants. 
  Lieutenant #2 and the fire fighter advanced a 1-&frac34;-inch handline from 
  L1 in through the rear entrance (<a href="#diagram2">Diagram 2</a>). The crew 
  proceeded through the kitchen and living room knocking down fire as they made 
  their way to the stairs. The crew was able to fight back the flames as they 
  followed the victims&#8217; handline up the stairs to a landing just outside 
  the second floor bedroom (<a href="#diagram1">Diagram 1</a>). The bedroom was 
  completely involved with heavy fire in the rafters above them. As they knelt 
  at the landing fighting fire, Lt. #2 could hear a low air alarm sounding. They 
  were able to knock down the fire in the rafters and restore some visibility. 
  They immediately spotted Victim #1&#8217;s boots just inside and to the left 
  of the bedroom door. Victim #1 was in the prone position with his feet towards 
  the bedroom door, with his gloves removed, and the TIC beside him to the right 
  (<a href="#diagram1">Diagram 1</a>). <em>Note: It is believed that the victims 
  were searching for the trapped children and opened the door in the window dormer 
  leading to the storage area behind the wall. The seat of the fire was in the 
  storage area just behind the door on the west side of the bedroom. It is believed 
  that the fire was throughout the entire storage area. The attic area and the 
  storage areas on both sides of the room were connected by a void space through 
  the design of the room-in-attic truss (<a href="#diagram3">Diagram 3</a>). The 
  bedroom was charged with smoke and the wind was blowing from west to east in 
  excess of 30 mph. According to the ATF and State Fire Marshal, when the door 
  was opened, the fire blew into the room and instantaneously ignited the smoke, 
  causing an explosion.</em> </p>
<p>Approximately 15 minutes after the explosion, additional fire fighters assisted 
  the rescue crew to remove Victim #1 and place him in an ambulance. Crew members 
  re-entered and found Victim #2 in the northeast corner of the bedroom. They 
  removed Victim #2 and placed him in an ambulance. Both victims were transported 
  to a local hospital and pronounced dead. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Cause of Death</h3>
<p>The medical examiner lists the cause of death for both victims as smoke inhalation 
  and thermal burns to over 50% of their bodies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="rec1"></a>RECOMMENDATIONS/DISCUSSIONS</h3>
<h5>Recommendation #1: Fire departments should develop and enforce standard operating 
  procedures (SOPs) for structural fire fighting that include, but are not limited 
  to, the incident command system, accountability, ventilation, and emergency 
  evacuation.</h5>
<p>Discussion: SOPs are organizational directives or plans that establish how 
  the organization will react in various situations to increase the effectiveness 
  and ensure the safety of the fire fighting team. Standard fireground procedures 
  include but are not limited to basic command functions; delegation of command 
  responsibility; communications and dispatching; fire ground safety; tactics; 
  initial resource deployment; and designation of roles and responsibilities of 
  companies and units.<sup><a href="#ref1">1</a></sup> SOPs should be comprehensive 
  and encompass training, fire protection agreement plans, and procedures for 
  those incidents involving mutual and automatic aid. SOPs should be written, 
  periodically reviewed, and enforced. </p>
<p><u>Incident Command System</u>: NFPA 1720 &sect; 4.5.1.2 states that &#8220;the 
  Incident Commander shall be responsible for the overall coordination and direction 
  of all activities for the duration of the incident.&#8221;<sup><a href="#ref2">2</a></sup> 
  It is important that specific tasks and responsibilities are addressed in SOPs 
  so that responding crew members know what their tasks are upon arrival and that 
  the IC or company officer will be prepared to assign responsibilities as needed 
  on the scene. The recommended span of control (the number of personnel one can 
  effectively supervise) is 4-7. Thus, as the number of personnel increases, the 
  IC must delegate supervision of specific duties and tasks such as ventilation, 
  search &amp; rescue, and fire attack or sectors. In this incident, functions 
  were not formally assigned.</p>
<p><u>Accountability</u>: According to NFPA 1720 &sect; 4.2.1.3 &#8220;the incident 
  commander shall ensure that a personnel accountability system is immediately 
  utilized to rapidly account for all personnel at the incident scene.&#8221;<sup><a href="#ref2">2</a></sup> 
  SOPs should require a company officer to record every responding fire fighter, 
  including him or herself at the start of operations. If an incident occurs on 
  the fire ground, each officer will be asked to conduct a roll call and verify 
  the whereabouts of their personnel. In this incident, members were arriving 
  without reporting to the IC for accountability. Accountability was not set up 
  until after the explosion.</p>
<p><u>Ventilation</u>: Ventilation decisions should be a part of the initial size-up 
  and are necessary to improve the fire environment in order for fire fighters 
  to approach a fire with a hoseline for extinguishments or to allow a quick search 
  for any victims. Smoke, heat, and gases should be vented above the fire to eliminate 
  conditions for a flashover, or in this incident, an explosion.<sup><a href="#ref3">3</a>, 
  <a href="#ref4">4</a>, <a href="#ref5">5</a></sup></p>
<p><u>Emergency Evacuation</u>: Evacuation signals are used when command personnel 
  decide that all fire fighters should be evacuated from a burning building or 
  other hazardous area because conditions have deteriorated beyond the point of 
  reasonable safety. There are several ways this communication can be done. The 
  two most common methods are (1) broadcast a radio message ordering all fire 
  fighters to evacuate, and (2) sound an audible warning device (air horn) on 
  the apparatus at the fire scene for an extended period of time.<sup><a href="#ref3">3</a></sup> 
  SOPs should identify the types of emergency evacuation signals that will be 
  used by the fire department.</p>
<h5><br>
  Recommendation #2: Fire departments should ensure that the Incident Commander 
  completes a size-up of the incident and continuously evaluates the risk versus 
  benefit during the entire operation.</h5>
<p>Discussion: The information obtained from a complete size-up lays the foundation 
  for the entire operation. A proper size-up begins from the moment the alarm 
  is received, and it continues until the fire is under control. Several factors 
  must be evaluated in conducting the size-up, for example, the type of structure 
  and its construction, occupants, time of day, contents of the structure, and 
  potential hazards.<sup><a href="#ref6">6</a></sup> </p>
<p>In this incident, a 360&ordm; walk-around of the structure was never conducted 
  by the first arriving officer who was acting as the IC. The first arriving apparatus, 
  Engine 1, was positioned in the front of the structure, and had received information 
  from a neighbor that children were trapped on the second floor of the fire unit. 
  The officer from E1 took control of the operations in front of the structure 
  and immediately deployed his crew in attempt to locate and rescue the children. 
  While the IC was pulling a supply hose for aerial water tower operations, he 
  received confirmation that the children were out of the fire unit. The IC was 
  unaware of any interior operations occurring in the front of the structure; 
  therefore, he didn&#8217;t make any tactical changes in the operation. He radioed 
  that the children were out of the structure at 1520 hours, but did not receive 
  confirmation of his transmission. The officer from E1 was charging the pump, 
  retrieving gear for the victims, and attempting to ventilate the structure. 
  He did not receive the transmission.</p>
<h5><br>
  Recommendation #3: Fire departments should ensure that adequate numbers of staff 
  are available to immediately respond to emergency incidents. </h5>
<p>Discussion: For &#8220;low-hazard occupancies&#8221; (e.g., 1-, 2-, or 3- family 
  dwellings), the NFPA recommends the following initial attack response: &#8220;At 
  least two pumpers, 1 ladder truck (or combination apparatus with equivalent 
  capabilities), 1 chief officer, and other specialized apparatus as may be needed 
  or available; not fewer than 12 fire fighters and 1 chief officer.&#8221;<sup><a href="#ref7">7</a></sup></p>
<p>In this incident, there were 11 fire fighters and the Incident Commander on 
  the scene. The Captain was responding on his day off and did not have any gear 
  on the engine to effectively assist with fireground operations. The ladder truck 
  responded with only the driver/operator and two fire fighters, which forced 
  the IC to assist with setting up their truck for aerial operations. Fire apparatus 
  that are staffed below minimum requirements can result in less effective and 
  ultimately unsafe fire fighting conditions. </p>
<h5><br>
  Recommendation #4: Fire departments should ensure that the Incident Commander 
  maintains the role of director of fireground operations and does not become 
  directly involved in fire-fighting operations. </h5>
<p>Discussion: According to NFPA 1720, &#8220;The responsibility for assigning 
  fire companies at an emergency belongs to the incident commander, who establishes 
  priorities and assigns units based on identified objectives.&#8221;<sup><a href="#ref2">2</a></sup> 
  In addition to conducting an initial size-up, the IC must maintain an awareness 
  of the location and function of all companies or units at the incident, initiate 
  and maintain accountability, and control communications for the tactical, command, 
  and emergency traffic channels for the incident. To effectively coordinate and 
  direct fire-fighting operations on the scene, it is essential that adequate 
  staff are available for immediate response to ensure that the IC is not required to become involved in fire-fighting efforts. 
  In this incident the IC was involved in non-command functions such as pulling 
  a supply hose and helping to set up the aerial truck.</p>
<h5><br>
  Recommendation #5: Fire departments should ensure that the Incident Commander 
  is clearly identified as the only individual with overall authority for management 
  of all activities at an incident.</h5>
<p>Discussion: NFPA 1561 states, &#8220;There should be one, clearly identifiable 
  incident commander for the duration of the incident, from the arrival of the 
  first emergency services organization unit until the incident is terminated.&#8221;<sup><a href="#ref8">8</a></sup> 
  The IC should make assignments based on the availability, qualifications, and 
  expertise of individuals. It is imperative that the IC clearly be in charge 
  of all operations on the fireground to ensure the successful completion of an 
  operation.</p>
<p>This incident had an identified IC, but command was never established, nor 
  was a plan ever developed. Independent and uncoordinated operations were taking 
  place at the front and rear of the structure. An effective fireground operation 
  revolves around one IC who develops and coordinates tactical decisions with 
  all personnel on the fireground. Companies responding as assigned must ensure 
  that they report to the IC to establish a unified command system. If there is 
  no command, or if there are multiple commands, fireground operations can quickly 
  break down.</p>
<h5><br>
  Recommendation #6: Fire departments should ensure that fire fighters are trained 
  to identify truss roof systems and their potential hazards.</h5>
<p>Discussion: Trusses come in many sizes, shapes, and design. It is important 
  that fire fighters are able to identify them and the dangers they may pose. 
  Trusses generally consist of wood but may also be constructed with various types 
  of metals. Truss systems that have the bottom cords covered with a ceiling create 
  a void space between the ceiling and roof. During a fire, this void space could 
  conceal smoke and fire, accumulate hot gases, and allow rapid fire spread. Once 
  burning of a truss has been confirmed, defensive fire fighting tactics should 
  be used.<sup><a href="#ref9">9</a></sup></p>
<p>Typical residential construction using roof trusses create a void space between 
  the roof and the ceiling. The roof of the structure involved in this incident 
  was built with a room-in-attic truss. A room-in-attic truss system has a room 
  framed into the void space typically created between the roof and ceiling, placing 
  the void space around the entire room. In this incident, the attic fire was 
  not only overhead, but it surrounded the victims as they conducted a search 
  in the upstairs bedroom (<a href="#diagram3">Diagram 3</a>). Fire fighters should 
  be provided with training to identify the different types of truss systems and 
  their potential hazards in a fire. Training to identify trussed buildings should 
  be a part of the fire department&#8217;s pre-fire planning or inspections.<sup><a href="#ref9">9</a></sup></p>
