</CENTER><P><FONT SIZE = "+1">During flight 4 on July 31, 1997, landing strut 2 failed
to extend, causing the unbalanced vehicle to tip over on its landing pad. The LOX
tank exploded and there were indications of secondary explosions in the LH2 tank
as well. The ensuing fire damaged large sections of the DC-XA. An investigation board
was convened to determine the cause of the accident, which was later determined to
be an unconnected helium pressurant line that supplied hydraulic pressure to extend
the landing strut.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE = "+1">The conclusion of the program was summed up well by the
Reusable Launch Vehicle program director, Gary Payton. He stated, &quot;The way the
budget is now, we cannot afford to rebuild the Clipper Graham and will not be able
to continue with that takeoff and landing technique, so we will declare victory with
the DC-XA.&quot;</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE = "+1">Like any good experimental vehicle, the DC-XA flew until
it was destroyed. We will always be impressed by the lessons this little rocket taught
us about the right way to travel to the heavens...</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE = "+1">The Delta Clipper Experimental was constructed in 1991-93
at McDonnell Douglas' Huntington Beach facility. It was intended as a one-third scale
model of a proposed SDIO single-stage launch vehicle. It first flew in August 1993
and had completed three flights when SDIO terminated the Delta Clipper program. After
additional funding was procured, the vehicle flew five more flights before being
returned to Huntington Beach for conversion into the DC-XA. <BR CLEAR = "ALL"></FONT><BR>

was a modified version of the DC-X. It had a lightweight graphite-epoxy liquid hydrogen
tank and an advanced graphite/aluminum honeycomb intertank built by McDonnell Douglas;
an aluminum-lithium liquid oxygen tank built by Energia; and an improved reaction
control system from Aerojet. These improvements reduced dry vehicle mass by 620 kilograms.
The DC-XA was operated by NASA and the Department of Defense under the Reusable Launch
Vehicle program. The flight vehicle was tested at White Sands during the summer of
1996, and demonstrated a 26-hour turnaround between its second and third flights,
a first for any rocket. After the fourth flight, however, the DC-XA suffered severe
damage and the program ended due to lack of funding. <BR CLEAR = "ALL"></FONT><BR>
