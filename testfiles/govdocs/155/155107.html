 The image above and the movie clips ( <a href="saul_sm.qt">QuickTime</a>, 
or <a href="saul_sm.mpg">MPEG</a>), show three simulated representations
of a  supernova -- an exploding star -- that recently occurred in the Centaurus
A galaxy. The image on the left shows how a supernova appears as it brightens
and fades -- becoming comparably bright to the entire galaxy of stars in
which it explodes. The upper right graph shows this brightness as a function
of time, and the moving dot indicates where on this curve the supernova's
brightness is, from the image at left. The bottom right graph shows how the
spectrum of the supernova changes during this same period. The height of
this graph for each color shows how bright the supernova is in that color.
