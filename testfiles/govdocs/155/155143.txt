The detection of a new impact with the telescopes of the Instituto de 
Astrofisica de Canarias installed in Teide Observatory Around 19:26UT 
(20:26 BST, 21:26 CET), Fragment H (14) of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 
impacted with Jupiter. the Carlos Sanchez Telescope (1.52m infrared 
telescope) and IAC-80 (an 82cm optical telescope) detected the 
explosion when it reached the edge of the disc of the planet at 20:07UT. 
The mark left by the explosion was almost as large as the Great Red Spot, 
that's to say, some 20 thousand Kilometers in length. Unlike the impact 
of Fragment A last Saturday, the explosion of Fragment H was immediately 
visible through a filter tuned to the wavelength of methane gas, when it 
reached the edge of the disc. the impact zone was immediately visible 
without having to process the images. The brightness of the visible 
cloud was clearly superior to that of Fragment A, which is logical given 
that Fragment H was one of the larger ones in the comet. As on previous 
occasions, the clouds were seen to project a considerable distance from 
the edge of the planet, showing once more that they are at a very 
considerable altitude in the atmosphere, well above the visible bands. 
The infrared observations have confirmed the data obtained from visible 
observations, showing, above all, the majestic procession of the cloud 
from Fragment G, followed by the other, smaller clouds. As with the 
visible methane filter, the spots are seen to be bright in the infrared 
as observed with the infrared camera of the Carlos Sanchez Telescope.
