Dr. Virginia Apgar

Dear Dr, Apgar:

and Dr. Watson it was agreed that, until further
decision, it was wise not to use cyclopropane or
ethylene in the anesthesia on the operating room
floors.

Yesterday at a conference with Dr. Squier

It was felt that, although the incidence

of explosion may not be greater, even though we
felt that to be a debatable point, if we should
have an explosion at the present time with such a
recent one appearing in the public press we would
be held responsible by both the public and the
management of the hospital for using a form of
anesthesia that carries with it an unusual risk,
It was felt advisable to have this understood
by all the dnesthetists so that if operators ask
for these anesthesias, they should be told that the
heaUs of the three surgical services had decided
on discontinuing it for the time being.

Sincepbly yours, ,
