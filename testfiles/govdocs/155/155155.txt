Subject: SUPERNOVA REMNANTS AND GALACTIC DIFFUSE EMISSION            
  Title: OBSERVATIONS OF SN1993J                                                         


Abstract:
 SN 1993J is one of five recent supernova explosions (SNe) detected in X-rays. It is
 observationally unprecedented, in that it is the only SNe detected in the radio and
 in X-rays within a week of the explosion, and whose X-ray lightcurve and spectral
 evolution have been carefully measured for over one year. The observations we
 propose extend the lightcurve (luminosity, spectral hardness, and temperature) into
 years. This first-of-a-kind opportunity, to follow the evolution in X-rays of the
 shocked circumstellar matter during the first few years after the explosion of a red supergiant, should not be missed.
