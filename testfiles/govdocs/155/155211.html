Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Designation of&nbsp;
Critical Habitat for the Peninsular Bighorn Sheep (Ovis canadensis&nbsp;
nelsoni) and Proposed Taxonomic Revision

AGENCY: Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.

ACTION: Proposed rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), propose to&nbsp;
revise currently designated critical habitat for the Peninsular bighorn&nbsp;
sheep (Ovis canadensis nelsoni) under the Endangered Species Act of&nbsp;
1973, as amended (Act). In total, approximately 384,410 acres (ac)&nbsp;
(155,564 hectares (ha)) of land in Riverside, San Diego, and Imperial&nbsp;
counties, California, fall within the boundaries of the proposed&nbsp;
revised critical habitat designation. Of the area proposed as revised&nbsp;
critical habitat, approximately 4,512 ac (1,826 ha) of land are Tribal;&nbsp;
93,720 ac (37,927 ha) are Federal; 249,840 ac (101,107 ha) are State;&nbsp;
35,824 ac (14,497 ha) are private; and 514 ac (208 ha) are local. We&nbsp;
are proposing to exclude from the final designation, under section&nbsp;
4(b)(2) of the Act, approximately 4,512 ac (1,826 ha) of Agua Caliente&nbsp;
Band of Cahuilla Indians Tribal land. We are also evaluating and&nbsp;
considering the possible exclusion of approximately 19,211 ac (7,774&nbsp;
ha) of private land covered under the draft Coachella Valley Multiple&nbsp;
Species Habitat Conservation Plan. Further, we are acknowledging a&nbsp;
taxonomic change to the species and are proposing a taxonomic revision&nbsp;
of the listed entity from distinct population segment (DPS) of species&nbsp;
Ovis canadensis, to DPS of subspecies Ovis canadensis nelsoni.

DATES: We will accept comments from all interested parties until&nbsp;
December 10, 2007. We must receive requests for public hearings, in&nbsp;
writing, at the address shown in the ADDRESSES section by November 26,&nbsp;
2007.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Public Comments

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We intend that any final action resulting from this proposal to&nbsp;
revise the current critical habitat designation for the Peninsular&nbsp;
bighorn sheep will be as accurate and as effective as possible.&nbsp;
Therefore, we request comments or suggestions on this proposed rule. We&nbsp;
particularly seek comments concerning:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) The reasons why we should or should not designate habitat as&nbsp;
``critical habitat'' under section 4 of the Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 et&nbsp;
seq.), including whether there are threats to the subspecies from human&nbsp;
activity, the degree of which can be expected to increase due to the&nbsp;
designation, that outweigh the benefit of designation, such that the&nbsp;
designation of critical habitat is not prudent, and whether there are&nbsp;
areas we previously designated, but are not proposing for revised&nbsp;
designation here, that should be designated as critical habitat;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) Specific information on the amount and distribution of&nbsp;
Peninsular bighorn sheep habitat, what areas occupied at the time of&nbsp;
listing and that contain features essential for the conservation of the&nbsp;
subspecies we should include in the designation and why, and what areas&nbsp;
not occupied at the time of listing are essential for the conservation&nbsp;
of the subspecies and why;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) The appropriateness of the proposed exclusion of approximately&nbsp;
4,512 ac (1,826 ha) of Peninsular bighorn sheep habitat from the final&nbsp;
designation in consideration of Secretarial Order 3206, ``American&nbsp;
Indian Tribal Rights, Federal Tribal Trust Responsibilities, and the&nbsp;
Endangered Species Act'' (June 5, 1997); the President's memorandum of&nbsp;
April 29, 1994, ``Government-to-Government Relations with Native&nbsp;
American Tribal Governments'' (59 FR 22951); Executive Order 13175; and&nbsp;
the relevant provision of the Departmental Manual of the Department of&nbsp;
the Interior (512 DM 2) (see ``Proposed Exclusion of Agua Caliente Band&nbsp;
of Cahuilla Indians Tribal Lands Under Section 4(b)(2) of the Act'' for&nbsp;
a detailed discussion); specifically any additional information&nbsp;
regarding the benefits of including these Tribal lands in the&nbsp;
designation or of excluding these lands from the designation;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4) The appropriateness of the possible exclusion of approximately&nbsp;
19,211 acres (ac) (7,774 hectares (ha)) of Peninsular bighorn sheep&nbsp;
habitat from the final designation based on the benefits to the&nbsp;
conservation of the subspecies and its PCEs provided by the draft&nbsp;
Coachella Valley Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan (MSHCP)&nbsp;
(see ``Areas Considered for Exclusion Under Section 4(b)(2) of the&nbsp;
Act'' for a detailed discussion), specifically any additional&nbsp;
information on the benefits of including land covered by the draft&nbsp;
Coachella Valley Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan in the&nbsp;
designation or of excluding these lands from the designation. At this&nbsp;
time we are only considering private lands under the draft Coachella&nbsp;
Valley MSHCP for exclusion and soliciting comment on the&nbsp;
appropriateness of excluding California Department of Fish and Game,&nbsp;
and Bureau of Land Management lands as Memorandum of Understanding&nbsp;
partners to the MSHCP;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5) Land use designations and current or planned activities in the&nbsp;
subject areas and their possible impacts on proposed revised critical&nbsp;
habitat;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (6) Any foreseeable economic, national security, or other potential&nbsp;
impacts resulting from the proposed revised designation and, in&nbsp;
particular, any impacts on small entities, and the benefits of&nbsp;
including or excluding areas that exhibit these impacts; and
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (7) Whether we could improve or modify our approach to designating&nbsp;
critical habitat in any way to provide for greater public participation&nbsp;
and understanding, or to better accommodate public concerns and&nbsp;
comments.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may submit your comments and materials concerning this proposal&nbsp;
by one of several methods (see ADDRESSES). If you use e-mail to submit&nbsp;
your comments, please include ``Attn: Peninsular bighorn sheep'' in&nbsp;
your e-mail subject header, preferably with your name and return&nbsp;
address in the body of your message. If you do not receive a&nbsp;
confirmation from the system that we have received your e-mail, contact&nbsp;
us directly by calling our Carlsbad Fish and Wildlife Office at 760-
431-9440. Please note that we must

[[Page 57741]]

receive comments by the date specified in the DATES section in order to&nbsp;
consider them in our final determination.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before including your address, phone number, e-mail address, or&nbsp;
other personal identifying information in your comment, you should be&nbsp;
aware that your entire comment--including your personal identifying&nbsp;
information--may be made publicly available at any time. While you may&nbsp;
ask us in your comment to withhold your personal identifying&nbsp;
information from public review, we cannot guarantee that we will be&nbsp;
able to do so.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comments and materials we receive, as well as supporting&nbsp;
documentation we used in the preparation of this proposed rule, will be&nbsp;
available for public inspection, by appointment, during normal business&nbsp;
hours at the Carlsbad Fish and Wildlife Office, 6010 Hidden Valley&nbsp;
Road, Carlsbad, CA 92011 (telephone 760-431-9440).

Background

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this proposed rule, it is our intent to discuss only those&nbsp;
topics directly relevant to the revision of designated critical habitat&nbsp;
for the Peninsular bighorn sheep and the proposed taxonomic revision of&nbsp;
the current listed entity. For more information on the biology, and&nbsp;
ecology of the Peninsular bighorn sheep, refer to the final listing&nbsp;
rule published in the Federal Register on March 18, 1998 (63 FR 13134),&nbsp;
and the proposed and final critical habitat rules published in the&nbsp;
Federal Register on July 5, 2000, and February 1, 2001, respectively&nbsp;
(65 FR 41405 and 66 FR 8650).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the 1998 final listing rule, Peninsular bighorn sheep were&nbsp;
listed as a distinct population segment (DPS) of the species Ovis&nbsp;
canadensis. As stated in the 2001 critical habitat rule, based on&nbsp;
morphometric and genetic analysis, Wehausen and Ramey (1993, p. 9)&nbsp;
synonymized Peninsular bighorn sheep with the subspecies nelsoni, which&nbsp;
is the current taxonomy. Although we accepted this taxonomy at the time&nbsp;
of the designation in 2001, we have yet to formally revise the taxonomy&nbsp;
of the listed entity. Therefore, we are formally proposing a taxonomic&nbsp;
revision to amend the final listing rule from a DPS of the species Ovis&nbsp;
canadensis, to a DPS of the subspecies Ovis canadensis nelsoni.&nbsp;
Therefore, within this proposed critical habitat rule we will refer to&nbsp;
the listed entity as a subspecies and not a species. The taxonomic&nbsp;
revision does not materially affect discreteness and significance of&nbsp;
the Peninsular bighorn sheep as a DPS entity. As stated in the final&nbsp;
listing rule (63 FR 13134), regardless of taxonomic issues surrounding&nbsp;
this species at the time of listing, the biological evidence supports&nbsp;
recognition of Peninsular bighorn sheep as a distinct vertebrate&nbsp;
population segment in the Service's Recognition of Distinct Vertebrate&nbsp;
Population Segments (DPS) (61 FR 4722). For a detailed discussion of&nbsp;
the DPS analysis for Peninsular bighorn sheep, see the Distinct&nbsp;
Vertebrate Population Segment section of the final listing rule.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peninsular bighorn sheep (a large mammal in the family Bovidae)&nbsp;
occupying the Peninsular Ranges of southern California were determined,&nbsp;
at the time of listing in 1998, to be a distinct vertebrate population&nbsp;
segment (DPS) of bighorn sheep based on their geographic isolation and&nbsp;
separation from other desert bighorn sheep (63 FR 13134; March 18,&nbsp;
1998). Peninsular bighorn sheep occur on moderate to steep (greater&nbsp;
than 20 percent) (NRCS 1993, p. 66) open slopes, canyons, and washes in&nbsp;
hot and dry desert regions of the Peninsular Ranges of southern&nbsp;
California in Riverside, San Diego, and Imperial counties (66 FR 8650;&nbsp;
February 1, 2001). Peninsular bighorn sheep use several different&nbsp;
habitat types, elevations, and slopes depending on seasonal&nbsp;
environmental conditions and/or their life history stage. The 2001&nbsp;
final critical habitat rule (66 FR 8650) stated that most Peninsular&nbsp;
bighorn sheep live between 300 and 4,000 feet (ft) (91 and 1,219 meters&nbsp;
(m)) in elevation. Upon review of available literature, we now believe&nbsp;
4,600 ft (1,400 m) (below forested vegetation) is a more widely&nbsp;
accepted upper elevational limit in the Peninsular Ranges (Jorgensen&nbsp;
and Turner 1975, p. 51; DeForge et al. 1997, p. 11; Rubin et al. 1998,&nbsp;
p. 541; Ernest et al. 2002, p. 76). Desert bighorn sheep are frequently&nbsp;
found on slopes greater than 20 percent (Elenowitz 1983, p. 87; Andrew&nbsp;
and Bleich 1999, p. 13; Dunn 1996, p. 5), and our Geographic&nbsp;
Information System (GIS) records and occurrence data confirm this&nbsp;
observation for Peninsular bighorn sheep. Steep terrains with slopes of&nbsp;
60 percent or greater used for predator evasion and lambing are a&nbsp;
crucial component of Peninsular bighorn sheep habitat (Dunn 1996, p. 1;&nbsp;
Service 2000, p. 6). Peninsular bighorn sheep will use caves and rock&nbsp;
outcrops for shelter during inclement weather and for shade during&nbsp;
summer months. Bighorn sheep are primarily diurnal (Krausman et al.&nbsp;
1985, p. 25), but Peninsular bighorn sheep may be active at any time of&nbsp;
day or night (Miller et al. 1984, p. 24). A wide range of forage&nbsp;
resources and vegetation associations are required by this subspecies&nbsp;
to meet annual and drought-related variations in forage quality and&nbsp;
availability. In a study of Peninsular bighorn sheep, Scott (1986, p.&nbsp;
21) found that diets were dominated by shrub species, while grasses and&nbsp;
forbs species made up a smaller portion of the Peninsular bighorn&nbsp;
sheep's diet depending on the season. Valley floors, rolling hills, and&nbsp;
alluvial fans and washes with productive soils provide seasonal&nbsp;
vegetation and water resources important to the Peninsular bighorn&nbsp;
sheep, especially for ewes during the reproductive season (Service&nbsp;
2000, p. 8). Please see the ``Primary Constituent Elements'' section of&nbsp;
this proposed rule for a detailed discussion of the habitat&nbsp;
requirements of this subspecies.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the time of listing (1998), Peninsular bighorn sheep were known&nbsp;
to occupy habitat along the Peninsular Mountain Ranges from the San&nbsp;
Jacinto Mountains of southern California into the Volcan Tres Virgenes&nbsp;
Mountains in Baja California, Mexico (63 FR 13134; March 18, 1998).&nbsp;
Population estimates at the time indicated approximately 280 Peninsular&nbsp;
bighorn sheep existed within the United States, divided amongst&nbsp;
approximately 8 subpopulations or ewe groups (63 FR 13134; March 18,&nbsp;
1998). At the time of the final critical habitat designation in 2001, a&nbsp;
range-wide census estimated approximately 400 Peninsular bighorn sheep&nbsp;
existed within the United States (Torres 2000, p. 1). We have extensive&nbsp;
occurrence data documenting bighorn sheep within the entire range&nbsp;
identified in the listing rule. Population estimates for 2006, derived&nbsp;
from data collected by the Bighorn Institute, California Department of&nbsp;
Fish and Game (CDFG), and Anza Borrego Desert State Park, indicate&nbsp;
approximately 793 adult and yearling Peninsular bighorn sheep exist&nbsp;
within the United States (Torres 2007). Population estimates for&nbsp;
various regions within the Peninsular Ranges in 2006 are as follows:&nbsp;
San Jacinto Mountains, 21; North Santa Rosa Mountains, 49; Central&nbsp;
Santa Rosa Mountains, 163; South Santa Rosa Mountains, 179; Coyote&nbsp;
Canyon, 42; North San Ysidro Mountains, 79; South San Ysidro Mountains,&nbsp;
38; Vallecito and Fish Creek Mountains, 77; and Carrizo Canyon, 145&nbsp;
(Torres 2007).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A captive breeding program has been maintained by the Bighorn&nbsp;
Institute since 1984 in cooperation with CDFG, the Bureau of Land&nbsp;
Management (BLM), and the Service (Ostermann et al. 2001, p. 751).&nbsp;
Originally instituted to conduct disease research on low lamb survival,&nbsp;
the captive breeding program was formalized in 1995, with the goals of&nbsp;
safeguarding a sample of the Peninsular bighorn sheep gene pool and

[[Page 57742]]

augmenting and reestablishing wild populations (Ostermann et al. 2001,&nbsp;
p. 751). Captive-bred Peninsular bighorn sheep have been released in&nbsp;
the northern Santa Rosa Mountains and the San Jacinto Mountains&nbsp;
(Ostermann et al. 2001, p. 751), areas historically occupied by the&nbsp;
subspecies.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within the Peninsular Ranges, habitat is patchy, and the sheep&nbsp;
populations are naturally fragmented (Bleich et al. 1990, p. 386; Rubin&nbsp;
et al. 1998, p. 547). Male and female bighorn sheep remain loosely&nbsp;
segregated much of the year and come together during the breeding&nbsp;
period or rut (Bleich et al. 1997, p. 7). In the Peninsular Ranges, the&nbsp;
rut occurs in the late summer and fall months (Service 2000, p. 15),&nbsp;
peaking from August to October (Rubin et al. 2000, p. 774). As&nbsp;
parturition (giving birth) approaches, ewes seek isolated sites (escape&nbsp;
terrain) with shelter and unobstructed views (Turner and Hansen 1980,&nbsp;
p. 148), seclude themselves from other females, and find sites to give&nbsp;
birth (Geist 1971, p. 239; Etchberger and Krausman 1999, p. 358). Ewes&nbsp;
usually give birth to one lamb after an approximately 6-month gestation&nbsp;
period (Geist 1971, p. 239; Turner and Hansen 1980, p. 146). During the&nbsp;
period of sexual segregation, ewes and their lambs are typically found&nbsp;
in steeper, more secure habitat, while rams inhabit less steep or less&nbsp;
rugged terrain (Geist 1971, p. 239; Bleich et al. 1997, p. 23).

Previous Federal Actions

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On February 1, 2001, we designated approximately 844,897 ac&nbsp;
(341,919 ha) of land in Riverside, San Diego, and Imperial counties,&nbsp;
California, as critical habitat. The designation followed the Service's&nbsp;
release of the final Recovery Plan for Bighorn Sheep in the Peninsular&nbsp;
Ranges, California (dated October 25, 2000). On March 7, 2005, the Agua&nbsp;
Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians filed a complaint against the Service&nbsp;
alleging that the economic analysis developed for our 2001 designation&nbsp;
used a methodology similar to that ruled to be insufficient by the&nbsp;
Tenth Circuit Court in New Mexico Cattle Growers Association v. U.S.&nbsp;
Fish and Wildlife Service, 248 F.3d 1277 (10th Cir. 2001). Other&nbsp;
parties subsequently intervened as plaintiffs in the case. A July 31,&nbsp;
2006, court-approved consent decree enacted a limited partial vacatur&nbsp;
of Tribal, mining, and Desert Riders lands (29,925 ac (12,110 ha)) and&nbsp;
remanded the critical habitat designation back to the Service for new&nbsp;
rulemaking. Publication of this proposed revision of critical habitat&nbsp;
satisfies our obligation under the consent decree to submit a revised&nbsp;
proposed rule to the Federal Register on or before September 30, 2007.&nbsp;
The final rule is due to the Federal Register on or before September&nbsp;
30, 2008. For more information on previous Federal actions concerning&nbsp;
the Peninsular bighorn sheep, refer to the final listing rule published&nbsp;
in the Federal Register on March 18, 1998 (63 FR 13134), and the&nbsp;
designation of critical habitat for the Peninsular bighorn sheep&nbsp;
published in the Federal Register on February 1, 2001 (66 FR 8650).

Critical Habitat

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Critical habitat is defined in section 3 of the Act as:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) The specific areas within the geographical area occupied by a&nbsp;
species, at the time it is listed in accordance with the Act, on which&nbsp;
are found those physical or biological features
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) Essential to the conservation of the species and
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) That may require special management considerations or&nbsp;
protection; and
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) Specific areas outside the geographical area occupied by a&nbsp;
species at the time it is listed, upon a determination that such areas&nbsp;
are essential for the conservation of the species.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conservation, as defined under section 3 of the Act, means the use&nbsp;
of all methods and procedures that are necessary to bring any&nbsp;
endangered species or threatened species to the point at which the&nbsp;
measures provided under the Act are no longer necessary.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Critical habitat receives protection under section 7 of the Act&nbsp;
through the prohibition against Federal agencies carrying out, funding,&nbsp;
or authorizing the destruction or adverse modification of critical&nbsp;
habitat. Section 7(a)(2) of the Act requires consultation on Federal&nbsp;
actions that may affect critical habitat. The designation of critical&nbsp;
habitat does not affect land ownership or establish a refuge,&nbsp;
wilderness, reserve, preserve, or other conservation area. Such&nbsp;
designation does not allow the government or public to access private&nbsp;
lands. Such designation does not require implementation of restoration,&nbsp;
recovery, or enhancement measures by the landowner. Where the landowner&nbsp;
seeks or requests federal agency funding or authorization that may&nbsp;
affect a listed species or critical habitat, the consultation&nbsp;
requirements of Section 7(a)(2) would apply, but even in the event of a&nbsp;
destruction or adverse modification finding, the landowner's obligation&nbsp;
is not to restore or recover the species, but to implement reasonable&nbsp;
and prudent alternatives to avoid destruction or adverse modification&nbsp;
of critical habitat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For inclusion in a critical habitat designation, habitat within the&nbsp;
geographical area occupied by the species at the time it was listed&nbsp;
must first have features that are essential to the conservation of the&nbsp;
species. Critical habitat designations identify, to the extent known&nbsp;
using the best scientific data available, habitat areas that provide&nbsp;
essential life cycle needs of the species (areas on which are found the&nbsp;
primary constituent elements, as defined at 50 CFR 424.12(b)).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Occupied habitat that contains the features essential to the&nbsp;
conservation of the species meets the definition of critical habitat&nbsp;
only if its essential features may require special management&nbsp;
considerations or protection.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the Act, we can designate unoccupied areas as critical&nbsp;
habitat only when we determine that the best available scientific data&nbsp;
demonstrate that the designation of that area is essential to the&nbsp;
conservation needs of the species.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 4 of the Act requires that we designate critical habitat on&nbsp;
the basis of the best scientific and commercial data available.&nbsp;
Further, our Policy on Information Standards Under the Endangered&nbsp;
Species Act (published in the Federal Register on July 1, 1994 (59 FR&nbsp;
34271)), the Information Quality Act (section 515 of the Treasury and&nbsp;
General Government Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2001 (Pub. L.&nbsp;
106-554; H.R. 5658)), and our associated Information Quality Guidelines&nbsp;
provide criteria, establish procedures, and provide guidance to ensure&nbsp;
that our decisions are based on the best scientific data available.&nbsp;
They require our biologists, to the extent consistent with the Act and&nbsp;
with the use of the best scientific data available, to use primary and&nbsp;
original sources of information as the basis for recommendations to&nbsp;
designate critical habitat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we are determining which areas should be proposed as critical&nbsp;
habitat, our primary source of information is generally the information&nbsp;
developed during the listing process for the species. Additional&nbsp;
information sources may include the recovery plan for the species,&nbsp;
articles in peer-reviewed journals, conservation plans developed by&nbsp;
States and counties, scientific status surveys and studies, biological&nbsp;
assessments, or other unpublished materials and expert opinion or&nbsp;
personal knowledge.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Habitat is often dynamic, and species may move from one area to&nbsp;
another over time. Furthermore, we recognize that

[[Page 57743]]

designation of critical habitat may not include all of the habitat&nbsp;
areas that we may eventually determine, based on scientific data not&nbsp;
now available to the Service, are necessary for the recovery of the&nbsp;
species. For these reasons, a critical habitat designation does not&nbsp;
signal that habitat outside the designated area is unimportant or may&nbsp;
not be required for recovery of the species.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Areas that support populations, but are outside the critical&nbsp;
habitat designation, will continue to be subject to conservation&nbsp;
actions we implement under section 7(a)(1) of the Act. They are also&nbsp;
subject to the regulatory protections afforded by the section 7(a)(2)&nbsp;
jeopardy standard, as determined on the basis of the best available&nbsp;
scientific information at the time of the agency action. Federally&nbsp;
funded or permitted projects affecting listed species outside their&nbsp;
designated critical habitat areas may still result in jeopardy findings&nbsp;
in some cases. Similarly, critical habitat designations made on the&nbsp;
basis of the best available information at the time of designation will&nbsp;
not control the direction and substance of future recovery plans,&nbsp;
habitat conservation plans (HCPs), or other species conservation&nbsp;
planning efforts if new information available to these planning efforts&nbsp;
calls for a different outcome.

Methods

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As required by section 4(b) of the Act, we used the best scientific&nbsp;
data available in determining areas occupied at the time of listing&nbsp;
that contain the features essential to the conservation of the&nbsp;
Peninsular bighorn sheep, and areas unoccupied at the time of listing&nbsp;
that are essential to the conservation of the Peninsular bighorn sheep,&nbsp;
or both. Material reviewed included information from the final listing&nbsp;
rule (63 FR 13134; March 18, 1998) and final critical habitat rule (66&nbsp;
FR 8650; February 1, 2001), information and survey observations&nbsp;
published in peer-reviewed literature and provided in academic theses&nbsp;
and agency reports; location data and survey information provided in&nbsp;
agency status and monitoring reports and on GIS maps; habitat analysis&nbsp;
and other information provided in the Peninsular bighorn sheep recovery&nbsp;
plan (Service 2000); material submitted during section 7 consultations;&nbsp;
data made available through members of the Peninsular Bighorn Sheep&nbsp;
Recovery Team, Coachella Valley Multiple Species Habitat Conservation&nbsp;
Plan program, and Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians Tribal Habitat&nbsp;

proposing any areas outside the geographical area presently occupied by&nbsp;
the Peninsular bighorn sheep as revised critical habitat because&nbsp;
presently occupied areas are sufficient for the conservation of the&nbsp;
subspecies.

Primary Constituent Elements

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In accordance with section 3(5)(A)(i) of the Act and the&nbsp;
regulations at 50 CFR 424.12, in determining which areas occupied at&nbsp;
the time of listing to propose as critical habitat, we consider the&nbsp;
primary constituent elements (PCEs) to be those physical and biological&nbsp;
features that are essential to the conservation of the species and that&nbsp;
may require special management considerations or protection. These&nbsp;
include, but are not limited to:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) Space for individual and population growth and for normal&nbsp;
behavior;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) Food, water, air, light, minerals, or other nutritional or&nbsp;
physiological requirements;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) Cover or shelter;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4) Sites for breeding, reproduction, or rearing (or development)&nbsp;
of offspring; and
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5) Habitats that are protected from disturbance or are&nbsp;
representative of the historic geographical and ecological&nbsp;
distributions of a species.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We derive the specific primary constituent elements (PCEs) required&nbsp;
for the Peninsular bighorn sheep from its biological needs.

Space for Individual and Population Growth and for Normal Behavior

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peninsular bighorn sheep occur on moderately steep to very steep&nbsp;
open slopes, canyons, and washes in hot and dry desert regions where&nbsp;
the land is rough and rocky, and sparsely vegetated (66 FR 8650;&nbsp;
February 1, 2001). This subspecies is primarily restricted to the east-
facing lower elevation slopes (generally below 4,600 ft (1,400 m)) of&nbsp;
the Peninsular Ranges along the northwestern edge of the Sonoran Desert&nbsp;
(Jorgensen and Turner 1975, p. 51; DeForge et al. 1997, p. 11; Rubin et&nbsp;
al. 1998, p. 541; Ernest et al. 2002, p. 76). A wide range of&nbsp;
topography provides a diversity of habitats and plant communities&nbsp;
across the mountainous slopes, canyons, washes, and alluvial fans&nbsp;
within the home range of the Peninsular bighorn sheep (Service 2000, p.&nbsp;
156). This diverse topography is necessary to provide shelter from the&nbsp;
elements and predators, areas for rearing, areas used to meet thermal&nbsp;
requirements, seasonal water and forage sources, and space for mating&nbsp;
and movement of this subspecies.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Diverse topographic features are especially important because of&nbsp;
the extreme temperatures Peninsular bighorn sheep must cope with in&nbsp;
this desert region. During hot weather, desert bighorn sheep seek shade&nbsp;
under boulders and cliffs, or move to north-facing slopes (Merritt&nbsp;
1974, p. 14; Andrew 1994, p. 52). In the event of inclement weather&nbsp;
they may seek protected caves or overhangs, or move to sunny, south-
facing slopes (Andrew 1994, p. 52), or slopes that are protected from&nbsp;
strong winds. According to GIS data and occurrence records, Peninsular&nbsp;
bighorn sheep largely utilize habitat with 20 to 60 percent slopes,&nbsp;
broken by canyons and washes. The preference for slopes greater than 20&nbsp;
percent has been shown in other populations of desert sheep as well&nbsp;
(Andrew 1994, p. 53). Nighttime bedding areas are chosen carefully&nbsp;
according to the topography of the habitat and may be considered a&nbsp;
limiting factor in bighorn sheep distribution (Hansen 1980, p. 78).&nbsp;
These bedding areas are usually located along ridges and spurs with&nbsp;
long distance visibility where bighorn sheep can escape if necessary in&nbsp;
a matter of seconds (Hansen 1980, p. 78).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Generally, bighorn sheep primarily rely on their sense of sight to&nbsp;
detect predators. They prefer the lower elevations of the Peninsular&nbsp;
Ranges where the vegetation associations are less dense and provide&nbsp;
better visibility than those at higher elevations. Research has shown&nbsp;
that bighorn sheep will avoid habitat in which dense vegetation reduces&nbsp;
visibility and regularly use habitat with vegetative canopy cover less&nbsp;
than or equal to 30 percent (Risenhoover and Bailey 1985, p. 799;&nbsp;
Etchberger et al. 1989, p. 906; Dunn 1996, p. 1). Bighorn sheep in the&nbsp;
Peninsular Ranges avoid higher elevations (above 4,600 ft (1,400 m)),&nbsp;
likely due to decreased visibility (and therefore increased predation&nbsp;
risk) associated with the denser vegetation (chaparral and conifer&nbsp;
woodland) found at higher elevations (Service 2000, p. 10).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Along with occupying open habitat, bighorn sheep also use very&nbsp;
steep, precipitous terrain for predator evasion (Service 2000, p. 6).&nbsp;
Bighorn sheep use their climbing abilities rather than speed to escape&nbsp;
from predators, and mountainous slopes of greater than or equal to 60&nbsp;
percent (escape habitat) are steep enough to provide this function&nbsp;
(Andrew 1994, p. 57; Dunn 1996, p. 1; McKinney et al. 2003, p. 1231;&nbsp;
Service 2000, p. 6). Very steep escape habitat is also used for lambing&nbsp;
(Service 2000, p. 6). As parturition approaches, ewes seek isolated&nbsp;
sites (escape terrain with slopes

[[Page 57744]]

60 percent or greater) with shelter and unobstructed views (Turner and&nbsp;
Hansen 1980, p. 148), and seclude themselves from other females while&nbsp;
finding sites to give birth (Geist 1971, p. 239; Etchberger and&nbsp;
Krausman 1999, p. 358). Ewes usually give birth to one lamb born after&nbsp;
an approximately 6-month gestation period (Geist 1971, p. 239; Turner&nbsp;
and Hansen 1980, p. 146). These areas of steep and very steep terrain&nbsp;
are vital to Peninsular bighorn sheep because lambs have increased&nbsp;
vulnerability to predation, and these protective slopes are rarely&nbsp;
visited by predators (Geist 1971, p. 239). Ewe groups with lambs&nbsp;
usually stay close to escape terrain, while feeding on lower gradient&nbsp;
slopes. Berger (1991, p. 72) reported that when feeding on bajadas&nbsp;
(compound alluvial fans) or away from escape terrain, ewes and lambs&nbsp;
were more than three times more vulnerable to predation. Predators of&nbsp;
Peninsular bighorn sheep include mountain lion, bobcat, and coyote&nbsp;
(Hayes et al. 2000, p. 954; 66 FR 8650).

Metapopulation Structure

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within desert mountain ranges like the Peninsular Ranges, bighorn&nbsp;
sheep habitat is patchy, and the population structure is naturally&nbsp;
fragmented (Bleich et al. 1990, p. 384). This fragmentation has led to&nbsp;
the application of a broad landscape approach to their population&nbsp;
ecology, grouping geographically distinct herds into metapopulations,&nbsp;
which are networks of interacting ewe groups or subpopulations&nbsp;
(Schwartz et al. 1986, pp. 182-183; Bleich et al. 1990, p. 386). This&nbsp;
approach considers long-term viability not of individual&nbsp;
subpopulations, but rather of entire metapopulations; thus both genetic&nbsp;
and demographic factors are considered. Decreasing population sizes can&nbsp;
lead to decreasing levels of heterozygosity that may have negative&nbsp;
demographic effects through inbreeding depression (Lande 1988, p.&nbsp;
1,456) and loss of adaptability. A small amount of genetic exchange&nbsp;
among herds by movements of males can counteract inbreeding and&nbsp;
associated increases in homozygosity that might otherwise develop&nbsp;
within small, isolated populations (Schwartz et al. 1986, p. 185).&nbsp;
Males have larger home ranges and have a much greater tendency than&nbsp;
females to explore new areas, which they may do in search of females&nbsp;
during the mating season. If geographic distances between female groups&nbsp;
within metapopulations are not extreme (greater than 31 miles (mi) 50&nbsp;
kilometers (km) (Witham and Smith 1979, p. 24)), and no insurmountable&nbsp;
barriers exist, movement by males occurs readily. If movement is&nbsp;
precluded by human-constructed obstacles, populations will become&nbsp;
isolated and the metapopulation structure dismantled.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A study of Peninsular bighorn sheep distribution and abundance by&nbsp;
Rubin et al. (1998, p. 545) concluded that ewes exhibit a fragmented&nbsp;
distribution within the Peninsular Ranges making up at least eight ewe&nbsp;
groups or subpopulations. It is suggested that although the&nbsp;
distribution of these ewe groups could be considered naturally&nbsp;
fragmented, construction and use of roads through bighorn sheep habitat&nbsp;
may have increased fragmentation within the Peninsular Ranges because&nbsp;
ewes avoided crossing highways (Rubin et al. 1998, p. 547). Ewes show&nbsp;
strong gregarious and philopatric behavior (faithful to natal home&nbsp;
range), which limits their dispersal abilities (Boyce et al. 1999, p.&nbsp;
99; Service 2000, p. 10). Movement of ewes between ewe groups appears&nbsp;
infrequent, but direct observation and aerial-telemetry locations and&nbsp;
genetic analysis revealed ram movement between up to three ewe groups&nbsp;
(Boyce et al. 1999, p. 99; Rubin et al. 1998, pp. 543-544).&nbsp;
Substructuring also can occur within single herds (ewe groups) of&nbsp;
bighorn sheep (Festa-Bianchet 1986, pp. 327-330; Andrew et al. 1997,&nbsp;
pp. 74-75; Rubin et al. 1998, pp. 543-548). Such substructuring is&nbsp;
defined by separate home range patterns. Although demonstrated more&nbsp;
with females, it can occur in both sexes.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another important long-term process in metapopulation dynamics is&nbsp;
the balance between rates of natural extinction and colonization among&nbsp;
subpopulations. Colonization rates must exceed extinction rates for a&nbsp;
metapopulation to persist (Hanski and Gilpin 1991, pp. 8-9). In recent&nbsp;
history this balance has not occurred for Peninsular bighorn sheep due&nbsp;
to fragmentation, disease, predation, and low recruitment (Rubin et al.&nbsp;
1998, pp. 545-547; Rubin et al. 2002, p. 803-805). In addition to&nbsp;
fragmentation, remaining subpopulations consist of small, isolated&nbsp;
groups of bighorn sheep. Small groups are more vulnerable to&nbsp;
extirpation due to random naturally occurring events, disease, or&nbsp;
predation because of their small population size. Local extinction of&nbsp;
small subpopulations can be prevented by occasional immigrants from&nbsp;
neighboring subpopulations (rescue effect) (Brown and Kodric-Brown&nbsp;
1977, p. 445).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of the metapopulation structure of the Peninsular bighorn&nbsp;
sheep population, it is important for genetic exchange and the&nbsp;
conservation of the subspecies to ensure space for movement and&nbsp;
connectivity between ewe groups. Furthermore, maintaining connectivity&nbsp;
within the metapopulation will help safeguard against local extinctions&nbsp;
of the remaining subpopulations.

Food

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A wide range of forage resources and vegetation associations are&nbsp;
required by Peninsular bighorn sheep to meet annual and drought-related&nbsp;
variations in forage quality and availability (Hansen 1980, p. 76).&nbsp;
Valley floors, rolling hills, and alluvial fans and washes with&nbsp;
productive soils provide seasonal vegetation and water resources&nbsp;
important to the Peninsular bighorn sheep. In a mountainous environment&nbsp;
like the Peninsular Ranges, temperature and soil moisture vary widely&nbsp;
with slope and elevation. This causes variation in plant growth&nbsp;
throughout this subspecies' habitat on a seasonal basis. Peninsular&nbsp;
bighorn sheep need to have access to the seasonal abundance of plant&nbsp;
life at various elevations to maximize resources and survive in the&nbsp;
desert environment. Berger (1991, p. 70) found that bighorn sheep&nbsp;
adjusted their feeding ranges to exploit more nutritive portions of&nbsp;
their home ranges, such as bajadas, early in the season when high&nbsp;
protein grasses were emerging. Due to the high energetic costs of&nbsp;
pregnancy and lactation, ewes are especially dependent on areas with&nbsp;
nutritious forage to increase success of rearing offspring (Service&nbsp;
2000, p. 8). Berbach (1987, p. 97) reported that when ewes were&nbsp;
confined to an enclosure and prevented from using all vegetation&nbsp;
associations during late gestation and early lactation, they and their&nbsp;
lambs died of malnutrition. During the reproductive season for&nbsp;
Peninsular bighorn sheep, ewe foraging is typically concentrated on&nbsp;
specific sites, such as alluvial fans, bajadas, and washes, where more&nbsp;
productive, wetter soils support greater herbaceous growth than&nbsp;
steeper, drier, rockier soils (Service 2000, p. 8). There is a tendency&nbsp;
for plants that dry out during summer months on the mountain sides to&nbsp;
remain green longer (and thus more nutritious, higher in protein, and&nbsp;
more easily digested) because groundwater is generally closer to the&nbsp;
surface and in greater quantity. Furthermore, the greater soil moisture&nbsp;
supports a suite of nutritious plants that do not grow on the dry&nbsp;
mountain sides. Therefore, washes and alluvial fans play an important&nbsp;
role in allowing desert bighorn sheep to acquire quality forage during&nbsp;
the heat of summer months and through times of drought.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a study of Peninsular bighorn sheep, Scott (1986, p. 21) found&nbsp;
that

[[Page 57745]]

diets were dominated by shrub species (64 to 76 percent), with grasses&nbsp;
and forbs species making up a smaller portion of the diet (19 to 30&nbsp;
percent and 2 to 6 percent, respectively). In the following section,&nbsp;
plant nomenclature has been updated to conform to treatments in Hickman&nbsp;
(1993). Common names generally conform with those given in Hickman&nbsp;
(1993) and/or Abrams et al. (1992-1960). Cited scientific names are&nbsp;
retained in brackets for ease of reference. Foraging studies by Scott&nbsp;
(1986, p. 21) and Cunningham (1982, p. 31) noted that Peninsular&nbsp;
bighorn sheep preferentially feed on different plants seasonally.&nbsp;
Shrubs such as Ambrosia dumosa (burro bush), Caesalpinia virgata&nbsp;
[Hoffmannseggia microphylla] (small-leaved Hoffmannseggia), Hyptis&nbsp;
emoryi (desert lavender), Sphaeralcea spp. (globemallow), and&nbsp;
Simmondsia chinensis (joboba) are a primary food source year round;&nbsp;
grasses such as Aristida adscensionis (sixweeks threeawn) and Bromus&nbsp;
rubens (red brome) along with cacti Opuntia spp. (cholla) are a primary&nbsp;
food source in the fall; forbs such as Plantago spp. (woolly plantain),&nbsp;
Plantago ovata [insularis] var. fastigiata (woolly plantain), and&nbsp;
Ditaxis neomexicana (common ditaxis) are a primary food source in the&nbsp;
spring. However, Peninsular bighorn sheep are generalist foragers, and&nbsp;
will browse on a wide variety of plant species depending on seasonal&nbsp;
availability. Other plants reportedly consumed by Peninsular bighorn&nbsp;
sheep include Ephedra spp. (Mormon tea), Agave deserti (desert agave),&nbsp;
Quercus spp. (scrub oak), Phoradendron californicum (desert mistletoe),&nbsp;
Eriogonum fasciculatum (California buckwheat), Prunus fremontii (desert&nbsp;
apricot), Acacia greggii (catclaw), Prosopis juliflora (mesquite),&nbsp;
Krameria grayi (ratany), and Malosma laurina (laurel-leaf sumac)&nbsp;
(Browning and Monson 1980, p. 88).

Water

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Peninsular Ranges, the presence of perennial water is known&nbsp;
to be a limiting factor only during prolonged droughts or summers&nbsp;
without significant thunderstorm activity (Service 2000, p. 156). Water&nbsp;
sources are most valuable to bighorn sheep if they occur in proximity&nbsp;
to escape terrain with good visibility (Service 2000, p. 9). However,&nbsp;
bighorn sheep have been observed to travel at least 10 mi (16 km) from&nbsp;
sources of perennial water. According to Service biologists familiar&nbsp;
with the subspecies, bighorn sheep usually visit a water source every 2&nbsp;
to 3 days, but it is not unusual for them to drink more often. During&nbsp;
the hot summer months, desert bighorn sheep typically stay close to&nbsp;
reliable sources of water and drink large quantities of water at a&nbsp;
time. It has been hypothesized that desert bighorn sheep can survive&nbsp;
without a permanent water source, although this view is not widely&nbsp;
accepted (Turner and Weaver 1980, p. 104). In desert ranges like the&nbsp;
Peninsular Ranges, rainwater can collect in natural collection tanks&nbsp;
and potholes in the rock and provide seasonal or perennial water&nbsp;
sources. Natural springs also provide a reliable source of water for&nbsp;
Peninsular bighorn sheep. Desert sheep also rely on consuming&nbsp;
vegetation, including cacti, to meet water requirements when standing&nbsp;
water sources are scarce (Turner and Weaver 1980, p. 102). Water is&nbsp;
especially important to lactating ewes, as they need sufficient water&nbsp;
to produce milk. Water sources contribute greatly to the Peninsular&nbsp;
bighorn sheep's ability to survive the hot and dry summer months.

Primary Constituent Elements for the Peninsular Bighorn Sheep

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within the geographical area occupied by the Peninsular bighorn&nbsp;
sheep at the time of listing, we must identify the PCEs that may&nbsp;
require special management considerations or protection.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on the above needs and our current knowledge of the life&nbsp;
history, biology, and ecology of the subspecies, we have determined&nbsp;
that the Peninsular bighorn sheep's PCEs are:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) Moderate to steep, open slopes (20 to 60 percent) and canyons,&nbsp;
with canopy cover of 30 percent or less (below 4,600 feet (1,402&nbsp;
meters) elevation in the Peninsular Ranges) that provide space for&nbsp;
sheltering, predator detection, rearing of young, foraging and&nbsp;
watering, mating, and movement within and between ewe groups.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) Presence of a variety of forage plants, indicated by the&nbsp;
presence of shrubs (e.g., Ambrosia spp., Caesalpinia spp., Hyptis spp.,&nbsp;
Sphaeralcea spp., Simmondsia spp.), that provide a primary food source&nbsp;
year round, grasses (e.g., Aristida spp., Bromus spp.) and cacti (e.g.,&nbsp;
Opuntia spp.) that provide a source of forage in the fall, and forbs&nbsp;
(e.g., Plantago spp., Ditaxis spp.) that provide a source of forage in&nbsp;
the spring.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) Steep, rugged, slopes (60 percent slope or greater) (below&nbsp;
4,600 feet (1,402 meters) elevation in the Peninsular Ranges) that&nbsp;
provide secluded space for lambing as well as terrain for predator&nbsp;
evasion.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4) Alluvial fans, washes, and valley bottoms that provide&nbsp;
important foraging areas where nutritious and digestible plants can be&nbsp;
more readily found during times of drought and lactation and that&nbsp;
provide and maintain habitat connectivity by serving as travel routes&nbsp;
between and within ewe groups, adjacent mountain ranges, and important&nbsp;
resources areas, such as foraging areas and escape terrain.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5) Intermittent and permanent water sources that are available&nbsp;
during extended dry periods and that provide relatively nutritious&nbsp;
plants and drinking water.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This proposed revision to currently designated critical habitat for&nbsp;
the Peninsular bighorn sheep is designed for the conservation of PCEs&nbsp;
necessary to support the life history functions that are the basis for&nbsp;
our proposal and the areas containing those PCEs.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We propose units for designation based on sufficient PCEs being&nbsp;
present to support at least one of the subspecies' life history&nbsp;
functions. For this subspecies, all of the units proposed contain all&nbsp;
of the PCEs and support the multiple essential life history functions&nbsp;
identified above.

Special Management Considerations or Protection

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When designating critical habitat, we assess whether the occupied&nbsp;
areas contain the features that are essential to the conservation of&nbsp;
the subspecies and that may require special management considerations&nbsp;
or protection. We have also considered how revising the current&nbsp;
critical habitat designation for the Peninsular bighorn sheep&nbsp;
highlights habitat that needs special management considerations or&nbsp;
protection.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peninsular bighorn sheep habitat and the PCEs upon which the sheep&nbsp;
depends are threatened by the direct and indirect effects of:&nbsp;
Development and expansion of urban areas; human disturbance related to&nbsp;
recreation; construction of roadways and power lines; and mineral&nbsp;
extraction and mining operations.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The development and expansion of urban and associated industrial&nbsp;
areas threaten Peninsular bighorn sheep and their habitat through&nbsp;
direct and indirect effects. Habitat loss (especially in canyon&nbsp;
bottoms), degradation, and fragmentation associated with the&nbsp;
proliferation of residential and commercial development, roads and&nbsp;
highways, water projects, and vehicular and pedestrian recreational&nbsp;
uses threaten the Peninsular bighorn sheep throughout its range (63 FR&nbsp;
13134; March 18, 1998). The cities that occur along the eastern&nbsp;
boundary of proposed revised critical habitat, from the base of the San&nbsp;
Jacinto and Santa Rosa Mountains to the Salton Sea area (Units

[[Page 57746]]

1 and 2A), continue to grow. Development adjacent to and within&nbsp;
Peninsular bighorn sheep habitat affects the quality and quantity of&nbsp;
lower elevation habitat and associated vegetation, alluvial fans, and&nbsp;
water sources (PCEs 1, 2, 4, and 5). By 2000, at least 18,500 ac (7,490&nbsp;
ha) of suitable Peninsular bighorn sheep habitat had been lost to&nbsp;
urbanization and agriculture along the urban interface between the&nbsp;
cities of Palm Springs and La Quinta (Service 2000, p. 38). Much of the&nbsp;
lost habitat consisted of low elevation alluvial fans and washes that&nbsp;
provided important sources of nutrients to ewes when they are rearing&nbsp;
their lambs (PCE 2 and 4) (66 FR 8650; February 1, 2001). Moreover, in&nbsp;
the northern Santa Rosa Mountains, from 1991 to 1996, 34 percent of&nbsp;
adult mortalities appear to have been directly caused by urbanization&nbsp;
(66 FR 8650; February 1, 2001). Five Peninsular bighorn sheep were&nbsp;
killed by cars; five died from feeding on toxic, nonnative ornamental&nbsp;
plants; and one was strangled in a wire fence (DeForge and Ostermann&nbsp;
1997, p. 1).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Continued urban and commercial development within the range of&nbsp;
Peninsular bighorn sheep could fragment the Peninsular bighorn sheep&nbsp;
metapopulation into isolated groups too small to maintain long-term&nbsp;
viability. Maintenance of genetic diversity allows small ewe groups&nbsp;
like those in the Peninsular Ranges to persist. The inability of rams&nbsp;
and occasional ewes to move between groups erodes the genetic fitness&nbsp;
of isolated groups (PCE 1 and 4) (63 FR 13134; March 18, 1998). Special&nbsp;
management considerations or protection may be needed to alleviate the&nbsp;
effects of development on Peninsular bighorn sheep habitat, especially&nbsp;
lower elevation habitat, alluvial fans, and areas of possible ewe group&nbsp;
connectivity near urban areas. This protection could be accomplished by&nbsp;
controlling the expansion of urban, industrial, and agricultural&nbsp;
development into these areas.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Peninsular Ranges (Units 1, 2 and 3), increased activity and&nbsp;
disturbance adjacent to, and within Peninsular bighorn sheep habitat&nbsp;
are adversely affecting bighorn sheep by altering their normal&nbsp;
behavior. This altered behavior can lead to abandonment of habitat and&nbsp;
prevent use of preferred habitat, including lambing areas, water&nbsp;
sources, and foraging areas, and cause negative physiological effects&nbsp;
(PCE 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) (66 FR 8650; 63 FR 13134). A variety of human&nbsp;
activities, such as hiking, mountain biking, horseback riding, camping,&nbsp;
hunting, livestock grazing, and use of aircraft and off-road vehicles,&nbsp;
have the potential to disrupt normal bighorn sheep social behaviors.&nbsp;
Special management considerations or protection may be needed to&nbsp;
alleviate the effects of human activity and disturbance to Peninsular&nbsp;
bighorn sheep. Restricting human use of trail systems and natural areas&nbsp;
during lambing season and exclusionary fencing around urban areas may&nbsp;
reduce human effects on Peninsular bighorn sheep behavior.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roadways and power line structures occur in, and are proposed for&nbsp;
construction within, Peninsular bighorn sheep habitat. Two major&nbsp;
highways run through the Peninsular Ranges and fragment bighorn sheep&nbsp;
habitat. In the northern portion of the Peninsular Ranges, State Route&nbsp;
74 runs through the Santa Rosa Mountains (Unit 2A). Further south,&nbsp;
State Route 78 cuts through habitat between the San Ysidro Mountains&nbsp;
and Pinyon Mountains (Unit 2B). These roadways have degraded habitat&nbsp;
and have generally impeded the movement of Peninsular bighorn sheep&nbsp;
(especially ewes) between ewe groups in the surrounding areas (PCE 1,&nbsp;
2, 3, 4, and 5) (Rubin et al. 1998, p. 547), which can erode the&nbsp;
genetic fitness of isolated groups (63 FR 13134; March 18, 1998).&nbsp;
However, some movement has been documented across State Route 74&nbsp;
(Service 2004, pp. 1-2). Epps et al. (2005, p. 1035) showed that&nbsp;
nuclear genetic diversity of desert bighorn sheep populations was&nbsp;
negatively correlated with the presence of human-made barriers&nbsp;
(highways), which essentially eliminated dispersal. Furthermore, in&nbsp;
some portions of their range, collisions with automobiles can be a&nbsp;
significant cause of Peninsular bighorn sheep mortality (DeForge and&nbsp;
Ostermann 1997, p. 1). The construction of power lines and associated&nbsp;
structures may also degrade and fragment bighorn sheep habitat.&nbsp;
Currently, a large power line (Sunrise Powerlink) is proposed for&nbsp;
construction through Unit 2B along Highway 78. Special management&nbsp;
considerations or protection may be needed to alleviate the effects of&nbsp;
roadway and power line structures on Peninsular bighorn sheep and their&nbsp;
habitat. Future construction of roadways and power lines should be&nbsp;
avoided, and if unavoidable, should be constructed in a way that&nbsp;
minimizes effects to habitat and allows for continued connectivity&nbsp;
among ewe groups.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mining operations occur within southern portions of the habitat&nbsp;
used by Peninsular bighorn sheep. Mining activities and associated&nbsp;
facilities threaten Peninsular bighorn sheep by causing the loss of&nbsp;
vegetation structure required for foraging activities and destroying&nbsp;
habitats used for escape, bedding, lambing, or connectivity between&nbsp;
ranges (PCE 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5). Disturbance could modify the sheep's&nbsp;
behavior or cause bighorn sheep to flee an area. Mining occurs within&nbsp;
the habitat of Peninsular bighorn sheep in Units 2B and 3. Special&nbsp;
management considerations or protection may be needed to alleviate the&nbsp;
effects of mining operations on Peninsular bighorn sheep habitat.&nbsp;
Further mining operations should avoid to the maximum extent possible,&nbsp;
areas considered essential to Peninsular bighorn sheep conservation.

Criteria Used To Identify Critical Habitat

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All proposed revised critical habitat units are within areas that&nbsp;
we have determined were occupied at the time of listing, and that&nbsp;
contain sufficient PCEs to support the life history functions essential&nbsp;
for the conservation of the subspecies. Lands were proposed for&nbsp;
designation based on sufficient PCEs being present to support the life&nbsp;
processes.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We used the following data to delineate proposed revised critical&nbsp;
habitat: (1) Areas known to be occupied at the time of listing (1998)&nbsp;
and currently occupied; (2) areas within the ewe group distribution&nbsp;
(subpopulations) boundaries identified by Rubin et al. (1998); (3)&nbsp;
areas where occupancy data points indicate repeated Peninsular bighorn&nbsp;
sheep use, but which were not captured within the ewe groups&nbsp;
distribution boundaries identified by Rubin et al. (1998); and (4)&nbsp;
areas that contain the PCEs required by the subspecies as determined&nbsp;
from aerial imagery and GIS data on vegetation, elevation, and slope.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also gathered information from our files, staff biologists, the&nbsp;
California Department of Fish and Game, the Bighorn Institute, and Dr.&nbsp;
Ester Rubin. Our proposed revision to critical habitat is designed to&nbsp;
capture ewe groups; lambing areas; foraging areas, including alluvial&nbsp;
fans; water sources; ram groups; and areas used for associated herd&nbsp;
(male, female, and young) movements and migrations.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We delineated the proposed revised critical habitat boundaries&nbsp;
using the following steps:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) As a first step in the delineation process, we mapped ewe group&nbsp;
areas from Rubin et al. (1998) over GIS imagery of the Peninsular&nbsp;
Ranges to delineate the distribution of ewe groups in the proposed&nbsp;
revised critical habitat. We consider Rubin et al. (1998) to be the&nbsp;
best available data on Peninsular bighorn sheep ewe group distribution.

[[Page 57747]]

Rubin et al. (1998) examined the population structure, distribution,&nbsp;
and abundance of Peninsular bighorn sheep in California using&nbsp;
observational data from radio-collared and uncollared male (ram) and&nbsp;
female (ewe) sheep between 1971 and 1996. This is the only data we are&nbsp;
aware of that identifies the distribution of ewe groups and subgroups&nbsp;
within the Peninsular Ranges.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) To ensure that Rubin et al. (1998, pp. 539-561) still&nbsp;
accurately represents the boundaries of the ewe groups and to capture&nbsp;
possible ram movement, we compared the ewe group delineation from Rubin&nbsp;
et al. (1998, pp. 539-561) with all occupancy data collected since the&nbsp;
time of listing on GIS imagery maps. We then expanded the ewe group&nbsp;
delineation to include areas where occupancy data points indicate&nbsp;
repeated Peninsular bighorn sheep use and recent sheep movements (post&nbsp;
Rubin et al. 1998, pp. 539-561), and areas that contain the PCEs for&nbsp;
Peninsular bighorn sheep. In particular, we expanded the northernmost&nbsp;
ewe group delineation (San Jacinto Mountains) to include the area north&nbsp;
of Chino Canyon where (1) we have evidence of recent ewe and ram&nbsp;
movements and (2) the Bighorn Institute has released, and continues to&nbsp;
release, captive-born sheep to help recover this subspecies. We also&nbsp;
expanded the southernmost ewe group delineation (Carizzo Canyon area)&nbsp;
to the south to capture water sources (PCE 5), including habitat near&nbsp;
the Interstate 8-State Route 98 split, where there are consistent,&nbsp;
recent sightings of uncollared Peninsular bighorn sheep.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) We then examined all pre-listing occurrence data in our files&nbsp;
to determine if our revised critical habitat missed any areas of&nbsp;
historical repeated Peninsular bighorn sheep use. We identified an area&nbsp;
of historical repeated use that was occupied at the time of listing&nbsp;
between two ewe subgroups documented in Rubin et al. (1998, pp. 539-
561) as (1) Santa Rosa Mountains east of State Route 74 (Martinez&nbsp;
Canyon) and (2) Santa Rosa Mountains east of State Route 74 (south)).&nbsp;
Use of this area is consistent with the Rubin et al. (1998, pp. 539-
561) demographic study, which indicated possible connectivity between&nbsp;
these subgroups through this area. This area is important in light of&nbsp;
genetic findings by Boyce et al. (1999, pp. 99-106) that indicate ewe&nbsp;
groups within these ranges maintain genetic connectivity, probably&nbsp;
through male-mediated nuclear gene flow. Based on the importance of&nbsp;
this area for connectivity between subgroups, we expanded the proposed&nbsp;
revised critical habitat boundaries to include areas where occupancy&nbsp;
data points indicate historically occupied habitat. Since the number of&nbsp;
occurrence data points in historically occupied areas is relatively&nbsp;
small, we delineated the unit boundaries in these areas to follow the&nbsp;
boundaries of the PCEs, such as elevations below 4,600 ft (1,400 m),&nbsp;
areas with 30 percent canopy cover or less, escape terrain, alluvial&nbsp;
fans, washes, and water sources immediately adjacent to the identified&nbsp;
ewe groups.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4) As a final step in refining our delineation, we closely&nbsp;
examined our revised units to ensure they capture all of the PCEs to&nbsp;
support life history functions essential for the conservation of the&nbsp;
subspecies. Where appropriate, we expanded the boundaries to capture&nbsp;
the extent of an alluvial fan or water source (PCE 4 or 5,&nbsp;
respectively). We also removed areas that we determined do not contain&nbsp;
the PCEs or otherwise do not contain suitable Peninsular bighorn sheep&nbsp;
habitat, such as areas above 4,600 ft (1,400 m) elevation (PCE 1),&nbsp;
areas containing conifer woodland with canopy cover greater than 30&nbsp;
percent (PCE 1), and slopes less than 20 percent (PCE 1), unless those&nbsp;
areas overlapped specifically with Rubin et al.'s (1998, pp. 539-561)&nbsp;
ewe group distributions and had documented use by Peninsular bighorn&nbsp;
sheep.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On May 22, 2007, Drs. Esther Rubin and Walter Boyce, in cooperation&nbsp;
with Steve Torres and Chris Stermer of the California Department of&nbsp;
Fish and Game, submitted a draft predictive habitat model for bighorn&nbsp;
sheep in the Peninsular Ranges. We did not adopt this predictive&nbsp;
habitat model to delineate critical habitat because the model was&nbsp;
submitted in draft form, prior to final steps of model validation and&nbsp;
peer review, and model development was based on just two years of&nbsp;
Global Positioning System (GPS) data (Rubin 2007, p. 2); nevertheless,&nbsp;
the model supports our proposed delineation. Areas we are designating&nbsp;
roughly fall within the upper level habitat suitability classes derived&nbsp;
from the preliminary model.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When determining the proposed revisions to critical habitat&nbsp;
boundaries within this proposed rule, we made every effort to avoid&nbsp;
including developed areas such as buildings, paved areas, and other&nbsp;
structures that lack PCEs for the Peninsular bighorn sheep. The scale&nbsp;
of the maps we prepared under the parameters for publication within the&nbsp;
Code of Federal Regulations may not reflect the exclusion of such&nbsp;
developed areas. Any such structures and the land under them&nbsp;
inadvertently left inside critical habitat boundaries shown on the maps&nbsp;
of this proposed revision to critical habitat have been excluded by&nbsp;
text in the proposed rule and are not proposed for designation as&nbsp;
revised critical habitat. Therefore, Federal actions limited to these&nbsp;
areas would not trigger section 7 consultation, unless they may affect&nbsp;
the subspecies or primary constituent elements in adjacent critical&nbsp;
habitat.

Summary of Proposed Changes From Previously Designated Critical Habitat

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The areas identified in this proposed rule constitute a proposed&nbsp;
revision to the areas we designated as critical habitat for the&nbsp;
Peninsular bighorn sheep on February 1, 2001 (66 FR 8650). The main&nbsp;
differences include the following:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) The 2001 final rule used a generalized methodology for&nbsp;
delineating critical habitat that resulted in the designation of one&nbsp;
critical habitat unit for Peninsular bighorn sheep totaling 844,897 ac&nbsp;
(341,919 ha) (66 FR 8650; February 1, 2001). This proposed revision is&nbsp;
based on a more specific methodology that resulted in three critical&nbsp;
habitat units including approximately 384,410 ac (155,564 ha) of land&nbsp;
in Riverside, San Diego, and Imperial counties, California, a reduction&nbsp;
of 460,487 ac (186,355 ha) from the 2001 final rule (66 FR 8650). The&nbsp;
areas included in this proposed revised critical habitat are almost&nbsp;
entirely within the boundaries of the existing (2001) critical habitat.&nbsp;
There are approximately 72 ac (29 ha) of BLM land in Unit 3 that are&nbsp;
outside the boundary of the 2001 critical habitat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reduction in total area from the 2001 final critical habitat&nbsp;
designation is primarily the result of using a revised methodology to&nbsp;
delineate critical habitat in this proposed revision. In our 2001 final&nbsp;
critical habitat designation, we delineated critical habitat based on&nbsp;
the methodology used in the Recovery Plan for Bighorn Sheep in the&nbsp;
Peninsular Ranges, California (Service 2000).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In developing this proposed revision, we reexamined the methodology&nbsp;
outlined in the 2000 recovery plan and the 2001 critical habitat&nbsp;
designation, and updated that methodology based on the best available&nbsp;
information to identify areas essential for the conservation of the&nbsp;
subspecies (see ``Criteria Used To Identify Critical Habitat''&nbsp;
section). Since publication of the 2000 recovery plan and the 2001&nbsp;
critical habitat designation, more specific and up-to-date information&nbsp;
has become available regarding habitat use by Peninsular bighorn sheep&nbsp;
and areas containing the features essential to the conservation of this&nbsp;
subspecies. New information indicates that many areas included in the&nbsp;
2001 critical habitat

[[Page 57748]]

designation do not support the features essential for the conservation&nbsp;
of the Peninsular bighorn sheep and/or otherwise contain unsuitable&nbsp;
habitat for the subspecies. For example, the 2001 final rule included&nbsp;
high elevation (above 4,600 ft (1,402 m)), densely vegetated, and&nbsp;
forested habitat that is inappropriate for sheep use in the San&nbsp;
Jacinto, Santa Rosa, and Vallecito Mountains. The differences between&nbsp;
the generalized methodology applied in the 2001 critical habitat&nbsp;
designation and the methodology used in this proposed rule, including&nbsp;
our reasons for revising the approach, are outlined below.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The recovery plan generally used two criteria, the presence of&nbsp;
escape terrain and unobstructed view, as key habitat requirements when&nbsp;
delineating the areas essential to Peninsular bighorn sheep with little&nbsp;
consideration of the presence of the PCEs required by this subspecies.&nbsp;
In this proposed revision, we have considered all five of the revised&nbsp;
PCEs in delineating proposed revised critical habitat which results in&nbsp;
a more precise determination of essential habitat (see ``Primary&nbsp;
Constituent Elements for the Peninsular Bighorn Sheep'' and ``Criteria&nbsp;
Used to Identify Critical Habitat'' sections).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally, little consideration was given to occurrence data in&nbsp;
the recovery plan methodology and specific ewe group distributions,&nbsp;
resulting in expanses of critical habitat in the 2001 designation in&nbsp;
which we have little to no occurrence records that would indicate sheep&nbsp;
use those areas. For example, we have occupancy data dating back to&nbsp;
1940, yet extensive areas along the western and southern boundary of&nbsp;
the 2001 designation contain little to no documented sheep use. In&nbsp;
light of all the recent research efforts and occupancy data, we are not&nbsp;
including those lands in this proposed revision as we have determined&nbsp;
that those lands are not essential to the conservation of Peninsular&nbsp;
bighorn sheep. Because a detailed vegetation map was not available at&nbsp;
the time of the recovery plan, a team of biologists flew the entire&nbsp;
western boundary in a helicopter and visually assessed vegetation&nbsp;
associations (Service 2000, p. 159). The western boundary was&nbsp;
determined by consensus and recorded by GPS from the helicopter&nbsp;
position every ten seconds (Service 2000, p. 159). A 0.5 mi (0.8 km)&nbsp;
buffer was added to this line to account for the advent of fire&nbsp;
suppression (Service 2000, p. 160). In determining the western boundary&nbsp;
of essential habitat in this proposed revision, we used vegetation maps&nbsp;
that cover the entire range of the Peninsular bighorn sheep, along with&nbsp;
detailed aerial photography, expert opinion, and sheep use data to&nbsp;
delineate boundaries, which we have determined more precisely captures&nbsp;
the areas essential to the subspecies.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like our methodology for this proposed revision, the 2001&nbsp;
methodology used a minimum slope criterion of 20 percent to delineate&nbsp;
essential habitat; however, a 0.5 mi (0.8 km) buffer was included&nbsp;
around slopes of greater than or equal to 20 percent (Service 2000, p.&nbsp;
158). This proposed rule does not include a buffer zone area around&nbsp;
habitat determined to be essential to the subspecies.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In summary, we consider the recent data and methodology used in&nbsp;
this proposed revision to more accurately and specifically delineate&nbsp;
the areas essential to the Peninsular bighorn sheep. The methods used&nbsp;
in the 2000 recovery plan and the 2001 critical habitat designation&nbsp;
resulted in a more inclusive delineation of essential habitat due to&nbsp;
limited data. Application of the revised methodology, based on the best&nbsp;
available information, identified 460,487 ac (186,355 ha) of previously&nbsp;
designated critical habitat that is not essential to the subspecies,&nbsp;
and therefore we are not including these areas in this proposed&nbsp;
revision to the critical habitat designation.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) We re-evaluated and revised the PCEs in light of the Alameda&nbsp;
whipsnake court case (Homebuilder's Ass'n of Northern Cal. v. U.S. Fish&nbsp;
and Wildlife Service, 268 F. Supp.2d 1197 (E.D. Cal. 2003)) and other&nbsp;
relevant case law, and followed current Service guidelines and&nbsp;
policies. The PCEs differ from those in the existing critical habitat&nbsp;
rule in that they are reorganized into five separate PCEs for clarity.&nbsp;
Furthermore, we have added specific information on elevational range,&nbsp;
plant species used for foraging, and range of slopes required by the&nbsp;
subspecies. This additional specificity was gained by evaluating the&nbsp;
recovery plan and examining all recent sheep data, including data from&nbsp;
radio collars and GPS collars providing precision to the identification&nbsp;
of habitats used and preferred by Peninsular bighorn sheep. Applying&nbsp;
the more precise PCEs to the mountain ranges inhabited by Peninsular&nbsp;
bighorn sheep allowed us to fine tune the proposed revision to those&nbsp;
areas containing preferred habitat for sheep use, and removing those&nbsp;
areas unlikely to be used by Peninsular bighorn sheep.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) Approximately 29,924 ac (12,110 ha) of designated critical&nbsp;
habitat were vacated in the July 31, 2006, consent decree. A portion of&nbsp;
those acres are now within proposed revised critical habitat. Of the&nbsp;
13,213 ac (5,347 ha) of vacated Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians&nbsp;
Tribal lands, approximately 4,512 ac (1,826 ha) are now included in&nbsp;
this proposal. However, we are proposing to exclude all Tribal lands&nbsp;
from the final designation. Approximately 16,691 ac (6,756 ha) of&nbsp;
mining lands at Ocotillo Mineral Material Sites and Fish Canyon Quarry&nbsp;
property were vacated. In this proposed revision to critical habitat we&nbsp;
are including roughly 50 percent of those vacated lands; specifically,&nbsp;
we are including lands along the northernmost portion of the Ocotillo&nbsp;
Mineral Material Sites property and the middle to southern portion of&nbsp;
the Fish Canyon Quarry property. Both of these mining properties&nbsp;
contain actively mined lands, but also contain areas in which we have&nbsp;
recent documented use by Peninsular bighorn sheep and areas that meet&nbsp;
the criteria used to identify critical habitat as described above. The&nbsp;
Desert Riders lands vacated in the consent decree (approximately 20 ac&nbsp;
(8 ha)) are not included in this proposed revision.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our 2001 final critical habitat rule included the statement that&nbsp;
``* * *; we are not aware of any information suggesting that particular&nbsp;
areas within designated critical habitat are currently unsuitable or&nbsp;
unused over the generational timeframe needed for the long-term&nbsp;
conservation of bighorn sheep in the Peninsular Ranges'' (66 FR 8655).&nbsp;
However, we have reconsidered the information that was available to us&nbsp;
at the time of the 2001 designation in light of all the information&nbsp;
currently available to us, and we have determined that the methodology&nbsp;
used in this proposed revision, which utilized the best available&nbsp;
information, provides a more accurate and specific delineation of the&nbsp;
areas essential to the Peninsular bighorn sheep, than that relied upon&nbsp;
in the 2001 critical habitat designation.

Proposed Revisions to the Critical Habitat Designation

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are proposing four units as critical habitat for the Peninsular&nbsp;
bighorn sheep. These units, which are almost entirely within the area&nbsp;
included in the 2001 designation, if finalized, would replace the&nbsp;
current critical habitat designation for the Peninsular bighorn sheep&nbsp;
at 50 CFR 17.95(a). The critical habitat areas we describe below&nbsp;
constitute our current best assessment of areas that meet the&nbsp;
definition of critical habitat for the Peninsular bighorn sheep. Table&nbsp;
1 shows the occupancy status of each unit being proposed as revised&nbsp;
critical habitat.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We present brief descriptions of all units and reasons why they&nbsp;
meet the definition of critical habitat for the Peninsular bighorn&nbsp;
sheep below.

Unit 1: San Jacinto Mountains

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unit 1 consists of approximately 15,273 ac (6,180 ha) in the San&nbsp;
Jacinto Mountains, Riverside County. Unit 1 is generally located within&nbsp;
an area bounded on the east by the city of Palm Springs; bounded on the&nbsp;
north by Windy Point and Snow Canyon; and that extends south to the&nbsp;
northern Palm Canyon area. Land ownership within the unit includes&nbsp;
approximately 4,512 ac (1,826 ha) of Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla&nbsp;
Indians Tribal land; 3,757 ac (1,520 ha) of BLM land; 1,266 ac (512 ha)&nbsp;
of USFS land; and 5,738 ac (2,322 ha) of private land (Table 2).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unit 1 begins at a low elevation of about 450 ft (137 m) on the&nbsp;
eastern slope and rises to about 4,600 ft (1,400 m) to the west. It is&nbsp;
the northernmost unit proposed as revised critical habitat for the&nbsp;
Peninsular bighorn sheep. This unit was occupied at the time of listing&nbsp;
and is currently occupied (Table 1). Habitat in this unit contains&nbsp;
features that are essential to the conservation of the Peninsular&nbsp;
bighorn sheep including a

[[Page 57750]]

range of vegetation types (PCE 2), foraging and watering areas&nbsp;
including alluvial fans (PCE 4 and 5), and steep to very steep, rocky&nbsp;
terrain with elevations and slopes that provide for sheltering,&nbsp;
lambing, mating, movement among and between ewe groups (PCE 1), and&nbsp;
predator evasion (PCE 3).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The PCEs in Unit 1 may require special management considerations or&nbsp;
protection to ameliorate the threats of urban and industrial&nbsp;
development, particularly in lower elevation areas, and to decrease the&nbsp;
direct and indirect effects of human disturbance to the Peninsular&nbsp;
bighorn sheep and its habitat, due to the proximity of this unit to the&nbsp;
Palms Springs area. Please see the ``Special Management Considerations&nbsp;
or Protection'' section of this proposed rule for a detailed discussion&nbsp;
of the threats to Peninsular bighorn sheep habitat and potential&nbsp;
management considerations.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit includes approximately 4,512 ac (1,826 ha) of Agua&nbsp;
Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians (Tribe) tribal lands supporting&nbsp;
essential Peninsular bighorn sheep habitat. We are proposing to exclude&nbsp;
these lands from the final designation. The designation of critical&nbsp;
habitat would be expected to adversely impact our working relationship&nbsp;
with the Tribe and we believe that Federal regulation through critical&nbsp;
habitat designation would be viewed as an unwarranted and unwanted&nbsp;
intrusion into tribal natural resource programs. Furthermore, these&nbsp;
approximately 4,512 ac (1,826 ha) of Tribal land are currently managed&nbsp;
by the Tribe in a manner that provides some conservation benefits to&nbsp;
the Peninsular bighorn sheep, and are also within the plan area of the&nbsp;
draft Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians Tribal Habitat&nbsp;
Conservation Plan (Tribal HCP) (see ``Proposed Exclusion of Agua&nbsp;
Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians Tribal Lands Under Section 4(b)(2) of&nbsp;
the Act'' for a detailed discussion).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit also includes lands within the plan area for the draft&nbsp;
Coachella Valley Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan (MSHCP). We&nbsp;
are considering the possible exclusion of approximately 5,738 ac (2,322&nbsp;
ha) of private land from the final critical habitat designation based&nbsp;
on benefits provided to the Peninsular bighorn sheep and its PCEs by&nbsp;
the MSCHP, which is in draft form and under review by the Service (see&nbsp;
``Lands Covered by Management Plans `` Exclusions Under Section 4(b)(2)&nbsp;
of the Act'' for a detailed discussion).

Unit 2A: North Santa Rosa Mountains

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unit 2A consists of approximately 74,998 ac (30,350 ha) in the&nbsp;
northern Santa Rosa Mountains, Riverside County. Unit 2A is generally&nbsp;
located on the east-facing slopes of the northern Santa Rosa Mountains,&nbsp;
is loosely bounded on the east by communities of the northern Coachella&nbsp;
Valley, and extends from the Rancho Mirage area in the north to&nbsp;
Martinez Canyon in the south. Land ownership within the unit includes&nbsp;
approximately 44,669 ac (18,077 ha) of BLM land; 16,856 ac (6,821 ha)&nbsp;
of land owned by the State of California; and 13,473 ac (5,452 ha) of&nbsp;
private land (Table 2).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unit 2A begins at a low elevation of about 50 ft (15 m) on the&nbsp;
eastern slope and rises to about 4,600 ft (1,400 m) to the west. This&nbsp;
unit was occupied at the time of listing and is currently occupied&nbsp;
(Table 1). Habitat in this unit contains features that are essential to&nbsp;
the conservation of the Peninsular bighorn sheep including a range of&nbsp;
vegetation types (PCE 2), foraging and watering areas including&nbsp;
alluvial fans (PCE 4 and 5), and steep to very steep, rocky terrain&nbsp;
with elevations and slopes that provide for sheltering, lambing,&nbsp;
mating, movement among and between ewe groups (PCE 1), and predator&nbsp;
evasion (PCE 3).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The PCEs in Unit 2A may require special management considerations&nbsp;
or protection to ameliorate the threats of urban, industrial, and&nbsp;
agricultural development, and to decrease the direct and indirect&nbsp;
effects of human disturbance to Peninsular bighorn sheep and its&nbsp;
habitat, due to the proximity of this unit to the highly developed&nbsp;
northern Coachella Valley. Additionally, the PCEs in this unit may&nbsp;
require special management considerations or protection to alleviate&nbsp;
threats to Peninsular bighorn sheep and its habitat associated with&nbsp;
roadways; State Route 74 cuts through the midsection of this unit and&nbsp;
may impede movement between ewe groups. Please see the ``Special&nbsp;
Management Considerations or Protection'' section of this proposed rule&nbsp;
for a detailed discussion of the threats to Peninsular bighorn sheep&nbsp;
habitat and potential management considerations.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unit includes lands that are within the plan area for the&nbsp;
draft Coachella Valley Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan&nbsp;
(MSHCP). We are considering the possible exclusion of approximately&nbsp;
13,473 ac (5,452 ha) of private land in Unit 2A from the final critical&nbsp;
habitat designation based on benefits provided to the Peninsular&nbsp;
bighorn sheep habitat under this plan, which is in draft form and under&nbsp;
review by the Service (see ``Areas Considered for Exclusion Under&nbsp;
Section 4(b)(2) of the Act'' for a detailed discussion).

Unit 2B: South Santa Rosa Mountains south to Vallecito Mountains

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unit 2B consists of approximately 226,211 ac (91,545 ha) in the&nbsp;
southern Santa Rosa Mountains, Coyote Canyon, San Ysidro Mountains,&nbsp;
Pinyon Mountains, and Vallecito Mountains, in Riverside, San Diego, and&nbsp;
Imperial counties. Unit 2B is generally located on the east-facing&nbsp;
slopes of the above ranges; it is loosely bounded on the east by the&nbsp;
Coachella Valley floor and extends from the southern Santa Rosa&nbsp;
Mountains in the north to the Fish Creek Mountains in the south. Land&nbsp;
ownership within the unit includes approximately 16,266 ac (6,583 ha)&nbsp;
of BLM land; 197,509 ac (79,929 ha) of land owned by the State of&nbsp;
California; and 12,436 ac (5,033 ha) of private land (Table 2).&nbsp;
Portions of the Anza-Borrego Desert State Park occur within this unit.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unit 2B begins at a low elevation of about 150 ft (45 m) on the&nbsp;
eastern slope and rises to about 4,600 ft (1,400 m) to the west. This&nbsp;
unit was occupied at the time of listing and is currently occupied&nbsp;
(Table 1). Habitat in this unit contains features that are essential to&nbsp;
the conservation of the Peninsular bighorn sheep including a range of&nbsp;
vegetation types (PCE 2), foraging and watering areas including&nbsp;
alluvial fans (PCE 4 and 5), and steep to very steep, rocky terrain&nbsp;
with elevations and slopes that provide for sheltering, lambing,&nbsp;
mating, movement among and between ewe groups (PCE 1), and predator&nbsp;
evasion (PCE 3).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The PCEs in Unit 2B may require special management considerations&nbsp;
or protection to ameliorate the threats of urban, industrial, and&nbsp;
agricultural development due to the proximity of this unit to the&nbsp;
Coachella Valley, especially the lower elevation areas in the&nbsp;
northeastern portions of this unit. Additionally, the PCEs in this unit&nbsp;
may require special management considerations or protection to decrease&nbsp;
the direct and indirect effects of human disturbance to Peninsular&nbsp;
bighorn sheep and its habitat due to recreational activity. Most of&nbsp;
this unit includes lands within Anza-Borrego Desert State Park, which&nbsp;
is open to recreation activities. Furthermore, the PCEs in this unit&nbsp;
may require special management considerations or protection to&nbsp;
alleviate threats to Peninsular bighorn sheep and its habitat&nbsp;
associated with State Route 78, which cuts through the southern portion&nbsp;
of this unit and may impede movement between ewe groups, and mining&nbsp;
operations at Fish Canyon Quarry. Please see the ``Special Management&nbsp;
Considerations or Protection'' section of this proposed rule

for a detailed discussion of the threats to Peninsular bighorn sheep&nbsp;
habitat and potential management considerations.

Unit 3: Carrizo Canyon

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unit 3 consists of approximately 67,928 ac (27,489 ha) in the&nbsp;
Carrizo Canyon area, in San Diego and Imperial counties. Unit 3 is&nbsp;
generally located in Carrizo Canyon and the surrounding In-Ko-Pah&nbsp;
Mountains, Jacumba Mountains, Coyote Mountains, and Tierra Blanca&nbsp;
Mountains; it is loosely bounded on the north, east, and west by the&nbsp;
Coachella Valley floor. Land ownership within the unit includes&nbsp;
approximately 27,762 ac (11,235 ha) of BLM land; 35,475 ac (14,356 ha)&nbsp;
of land owned by the State of California; 4,177 ac (1,690 ha) of&nbsp;
private land; and 514 ac (208 ha) of local park land (Table 2).&nbsp;
Portions of the Anza-Borrego Desert State Park occur within this unit.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unit 3 begins at a low elevation of about 400 ft (122 m) on the&nbsp;
eastern slope and rises to about 4,600 ft (1,400 m) to the west. This&nbsp;
unit was occupied at the time of listing and is currently occupied&nbsp;
(Table 1). Habitat in this unit contains features that are essential to&nbsp;
the conservation of the Peninsular bighorn sheep including a range of&nbsp;
vegetation types (PCE 2), foraging and watering areas including&nbsp;
alluvial fans (PCE 4 and 5), and steep to very steep, rocky terrain&nbsp;
with elevations and slopes that provide for sheltering, lambing,&nbsp;
mating, movement among and between ewe groups (PCE 1), and predator&nbsp;
evasion (PCE 3).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The PCEs in Unit 3 may require special management considerations or&nbsp;
protection to decrease the direct and indirect effects of human&nbsp;
disturbance due to recreational activity to Peninsular bighorn sheep&nbsp;
and its habitat. Most of this unit occurs within the Anza-Borrego&nbsp;
Desert State Park, which is open to recreation activities. The PCEs in&nbsp;
Unit 3 may also require special management considerations or protection&nbsp;
to protect Peninsular bighorn sheep habitat from mining operations at&nbsp;
Ocotillo Mineral Material Site. Please see the ``Special Management&nbsp;
Considerations or Protection'' section of this proposed rule for a&nbsp;
detailed discussion of the threats to Peninsular bighorn sheep habitat&nbsp;
and potential management considerations.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Table 3 provides approximate areas (ac, ha) of lands that meet the&nbsp;
definition of critical habitat but that we are proposing to exclude&nbsp;
from the final revised critical habitat designation. Table 3 also&nbsp;
provides reasons for the proposed exclusions.

Effects of Critical Habitat Designation

Section 7 Consultation

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 7(a)(2) of the Act requires Federal agencies, including the&nbsp;
Service, to ensure that actions they fund, authorize, or carry out are&nbsp;
not likely to destroy or adversely modify critical habitat. Decisions&nbsp;
by the 5th and 9th Circuit Court of Appeals have invalidated our&nbsp;
definition of ``destruction or adverse modification'' (50 CFR 402.02)&nbsp;
(see Gifford Pinchot Task Force v. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 378&nbsp;
F. 3d 1059 (9th Cir. 2004) and Sierra Club v. U.S. Fish and Wildlife&nbsp;
Service et al., 245 F.3d 434, 442 (5th Cir. 2001)), and we do not rely&nbsp;
on this regulatory definition when analyzing whether an action is&nbsp;
likely to destroy or adversely modify critical habitat. Under the&nbsp;
statutory provisions of the Act, we determine destruction or adverse&nbsp;
modification on the basis of whether, with implementation of the&nbsp;
proposed Federal action, the affected critical habitat would remain&nbsp;
functional (or retain the current ability for the PCEs to be&nbsp;
functionally established) to serve its intended conservation role for&nbsp;
the species.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 7(a)(4) of the Act requires Federal agencies to confer with&nbsp;
us on any action that is likely to jeopardize the continued existence&nbsp;
of a species proposed for listing or result in destruction or adverse&nbsp;
modification of proposed critical habitat. This is a procedural&nbsp;
requirement only, as any conservation recommendations in a conference&nbsp;
report or opinion are strictly advisory. However, once a species&nbsp;
proposed for listing becomes listed, or proposed critical habitat is&nbsp;
designated as final, the full prohibitions of section 7(a)(2) apply to&nbsp;
any discretionary Federal action.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The primary utility of the conference procedures is to allow a&nbsp;
Federal agency to maximize its opportunity to adequately consider&nbsp;
species proposed for listing and proposed critical habitat and to avoid&nbsp;
potential delays in implementing their proposed action because of the&nbsp;
section 7(a)(2) compliance process, if we list those species or&nbsp;
designate critical habitat. We may conduct conferences either&nbsp;
informally or formally. We typically use informal conferences as a&nbsp;
means of providing advisory conservation recommendations to assist the&nbsp;
agency in eliminating conflicts that the proposed action may cause. We&nbsp;
typically use formal conferences when we or the Federal agency believes&nbsp;
the proposed action is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of&nbsp;
the species proposed for listing or adversely modify proposed critical&nbsp;
habitat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We generally provide the results of an informal conference in a&nbsp;
conference report, while we provide the results of a formal conference&nbsp;
in a conference opinion. We typically prepare conference opinions on&nbsp;
proposed species or critical habitat in accordance with procedures&nbsp;
contained at 50 CFR 402.14, as if the proposed species were already&nbsp;
listed or the proposed critical habitat was already designated. We may&nbsp;
adopt the conference opinion as the biological opinion when the species&nbsp;
is listed or the critical habitat is designated, if no substantial new&nbsp;
information or changes in the action alter the content of the opinion&nbsp;
(see 50 CFR 402.10(d)).

[[Page 57752]]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a species is listed or critical habitat is designated, section&nbsp;
7(a)(2) of the Act requires Federal agencies to ensure that activities&nbsp;
they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the&nbsp;
continued existence of the species or to destroy or adversely modify&nbsp;
its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect a listed species&nbsp;
or its critical habitat, the responsible Federal agency (action agency)&nbsp;
must enter into consultation with us. As a result of this consultation,&nbsp;
we document compliance with the requirements of section 7(a)(2) through&nbsp;
our issuance of:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) A concurrence letter for Federal actions that may affect, but&nbsp;
are not likely to adversely affect, listed species or critical habitat;&nbsp;
or
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) A biological opinion for Federal actions that may affect, and&nbsp;
are likely to adversely affect, listed species or critical habitat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we issue a biological opinion concluding that a project is&nbsp;
likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a listed species or&nbsp;
destroy or adversely modify critical habitat, we also provide&nbsp;
reasonable and prudent alternatives to the project, if any are&nbsp;
identifiable. We define ``Reasonable and prudent alternatives'' at 50&nbsp;
CFR 402.02 as alternative actions identified during consultation that:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BULLET> Can be implemented in a manner consistent with the&nbsp;
intended purpose of the action,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BULLET> Can be implemented consistent with the scope of the&nbsp;
Federal agency's legal authority and jurisdiction,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BULLET> Are economically and technologically feasible, and
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BULLET> Would, in the Director's opinion, avoid jeopardizing the&nbsp;
continued existence of the listed species or destroying or adversely&nbsp;
modifying critical habitat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reasonable and prudent alternatives can vary from slight project&nbsp;
modifications to extensive redesign or relocation of the project. Costs&nbsp;
associated with implementing a reasonable and prudent alternative are&nbsp;
similarly variable.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regulations at 50 CFR 402.16 require Federal agencies to reinitiate&nbsp;
consultation on previously reviewed actions in instances where we have&nbsp;
listed a new species or subsequently designated critical habitat that&nbsp;
may be affected and the Federal agency has retained discretionary&nbsp;
involvement or control over the action (or the agency's discretionary&nbsp;
involvement or control is authorized by law). Consequently, Federal&nbsp;
agencies may sometimes need to request reinitiation of consultation&nbsp;
with us on actions for which formal consultation has been completed, if&nbsp;
those actions with discretionary involvement or control may affect&nbsp;
subsequently listed species or designated critical habitat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Federal activities that may affect the Peninsular bighorn sheep or&nbsp;
its designated critical habitat require section 7(a)(2) consultation&nbsp;
under the Act. Activities on State, Tribal, local, or private lands&nbsp;
requiring a Federal permit (such as a permit from the U.S. Army Corps&nbsp;
of Engineers under section 404 of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251&nbsp;
et seq.) or a permit from us under section 10 of the Act) or involving&nbsp;
some other Federal action (such as funding from the Federal Highway&nbsp;
Administration, Federal Aviation Administration, or the Federal&nbsp;
Emergency Management Agency) are subject to the section 7(a)(2)&nbsp;
consultation process. Federal actions not affecting listed species or&nbsp;
critical habitat, and actions on State, Tribal, local, or private lands&nbsp;
that are not federally funded, authorized, or permitted, do not require&nbsp;
section 7(a)(2) consultations.

Application of the ``Adverse Modification'' Standard

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The key factor related to the adverse modification determination is&nbsp;
whether, with implementation of the proposed Federal action, the&nbsp;
affected critical habitat would continue to serve its intended&nbsp;
conservation role for the species, or would retain its current ability&nbsp;
for the primary constituent elements to be functionally established.&nbsp;
Activities that may destroy or adversely modify critical habitat are&nbsp;
those that alter the PCEs to an extent that appreciably reduces the&nbsp;
conservation value of critical habitat for the Peninsular bighorn&nbsp;
sheep. Generally, the conservation role of the Peninsular bighorn sheep&nbsp;
critical habitat units is to support viable core area populations.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 4(b)(8) of the Act requires us to briefly evaluate and&nbsp;
describe, in any proposed or final regulation that designates critical&nbsp;
habitat, activities involving a Federal action that may destroy or&nbsp;
adversely modify such habitat, or that may be affected by such&nbsp;
designation.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Activities that, when carried out, funded, or authorized by a&nbsp;
Federal agency, may affect critical habitat and therefore should result&nbsp;
in consultation for the Peninsular bighorn sheep include, but are not&nbsp;
limited to:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) Actions that would significantly reduce ongoing management and&nbsp;
conservation efforts that benefit the Peninsular bighorn sheep on&nbsp;
public lands. Such activities could include, but are not limited to,&nbsp;
the sale, exchange, or lease of lands managed by BLM or other Federal&nbsp;
agencies, and the State of California. These activities could reduce&nbsp;
the amount of space that is available for individual and population&nbsp;
growth and normal behavior, as well as reduce or eliminate the number&nbsp;
and extent of sites for foraging, watering, breeding, reproduction, and&nbsp;
rearing of offspring. These activities could also reduce the&nbsp;
opportunities available to Federal agencies to exercise their section&nbsp;
7(a)(1) responsibilities to carry out programs to conserve listed&nbsp;
species.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) Actions that would significantly reduce the availability of or&nbsp;
accessibility to seasonal ranges. Such activities could include, but&nbsp;
are not limited to, grazing, mining, and power line and road&nbsp;
construction activities. These activities could degrade, reduce,&nbsp;
fragment, or eliminate available foraging resources or alter current&nbsp;
foraging activities of Peninsular bighorn sheep.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) Actions that would result in the significant expansion of dense&nbsp;
vegetation communities within Peninsular bighorn sheep habitat. Such&nbsp;
activities could include, but are not limited to, fire suppression.&nbsp;
These activities could allow expansion of vegetation cover such that&nbsp;
movement patterns of bighorn sheep are altered by avoidance of these&nbsp;
areas. Tall, dense vegetation decreases visibility for bighorn sheep&nbsp;
and provides cover for predators such as the mountain lion, a common&nbsp;
predator of Peninsular bighorn sheep.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4) Actions that would create significant barriers to movement.&nbsp;
Such activities could include, but are not limited to, road&nbsp;
construction, residential development, and resort or campground&nbsp;
facility development or expansion. These activities could interfere&nbsp;
with movement within and between habitats, thereby reducing the&nbsp;
availability of habitat for foraging, watering, breeding, reproduction,&nbsp;
sheltering, and rearing of offspring. These activities could also&nbsp;
reduce opportunities for movement between existing populations,&nbsp;
dispersal, and genetic interchange between ewe groups.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5) Actions that would significantly degrade habitat or cause a&nbsp;
disturbance to Peninsular bighorn sheep. Such activities could include,&nbsp;
but are not limited to, recreational activities, such as off-road&nbsp;
vehicle use, hiking, camping, rock climbing, horseback riding, and&nbsp;
outfitter guided activities. These activities could displace animals&nbsp;
from foraging areas, water sources, and escape terrain, and could&nbsp;
impact the quality and quantity of forage.

Exemptions and Exclusions
Application of Section 4(b)(2) of the Act
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 4(b)(2) of the Act states that the Secretary must designate&nbsp;
and revise critical habitat on the basis of the best available&nbsp;
scientific data after taking into consideration the economic impact,&nbsp;
impact on national security, and any other relevant impact of&nbsp;
specifying any particular area as critical habitat. The Secretary may&nbsp;
exclude an area from critical habitat if he determines that the&nbsp;
benefits of such exclusion outweigh the benefits of specifying such&nbsp;
area as part of the critical habitat, unless he determines, based on&nbsp;
the best scientific data available, that the failure to designate such&nbsp;
area as critical habitat will result in the extinction of the species.&nbsp;
In making that determination, the legislative history is clear that the&nbsp;
Secretary has broad discretion regarding which factor(s) to use and how&nbsp;
much weight to give to any factor.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under section 4(b)(2) of the Act, in considering whether to exclude&nbsp;
a particular area from the designation, we must identify the benefits&nbsp;
of including the area in the designation, identify the benefits of&nbsp;
excluding the area from the designation, and determine whether the&nbsp;
benefits of exclusion outweigh the benefits of inclusion. If we&nbsp;
consider an exclusion we must determine whether excluding the area&nbsp;
would result in the extinction of the species.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the following sections, we address a number of general issues&nbsp;
that are relevant to the exclusions we are considering. In addition, we&nbsp;
are conducting an economic analysis of the impacts of the proposed&nbsp;
critical habitat designation, which will be available for public review&nbsp;
and comment when it is complete. Based on public comment on that&nbsp;
document, the proposed designation itself, and the information in the&nbsp;
final economic analysis, the Secretary may exclude from critical&nbsp;
habitat additional areas beyond those identified in this assessment&nbsp;
under the provisions of section 4(b)(2) of the Act. This is also&nbsp;
addressed in our implementing regulations at 50 CFR 424.19.

Benefits of Designating Critical Habitat

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The process of designating critical habitat as described in the Act&nbsp;
requires that the Service identify those lands on which are found the&nbsp;
physical or biological features essential to the conservation of the&nbsp;
species that may require special management considerations or&nbsp;
protection, and those areas outside the geographical area occupied by&nbsp;
the species at the time of listing that are essential to the&nbsp;
conservation of the species. In identifying those lands, the Service&nbsp;
must consider the recovery needs of the species, such that, on the&nbsp;
basis of the best scientific and commercial data available at the time&nbsp;
of designation, the habitat that is identified, if managed, could&nbsp;
provide for the survival and recovery of the species.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The identification of those areas that are essential for the&nbsp;
conservation of the species and can, if managed, provide for the&nbsp;
recovery of a species is beneficial. The process of proposing and&nbsp;
finalizing a critical habitat rule provides the Service with the&nbsp;
opportunity to determine the features or PCEs essential for&nbsp;
conservation of the species within the geographical area occupied by&nbsp;
the species at the time of listing, as well as to determine other areas&nbsp;
essential to the conservation of the species. The designation process&nbsp;
includes peer review and public comment on the identified features and&nbsp;
areas. This process is valuable to land owners and managers in&nbsp;
developing conservation management plans for identified areas, as well&nbsp;
as any other occupied habitat or suitable habitat that may not have&nbsp;
been included in the Service's determination of essential habitat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The consultation provisions under section 7(a) of the Act&nbsp;
constitute the regulatory benefits of critical habitat. As discussed&nbsp;
above, Federal agencies must consult with us on actions that may affect&nbsp;
critical habitat and must avoid destroying or adversely modifying&nbsp;
critical habitat. Federal agencies must also consult with us on actions&nbsp;
that may affect a listed species and refrain from undertaking actions&nbsp;
that are likely to jeopardize the continued existence of such species.&nbsp;
The analysis of effects to critical habitat is a separate and different&nbsp;
analysis from that of the effects to the species. Therefore, the&nbsp;
difference in outcomes of these two analyses represents the regulatory&nbsp;
benefit of critical habitat. For some species, and in some locations,&nbsp;
the outcome of these analyses will be similar, because effects on&nbsp;
habitat will often result in effects on the species. However, the&nbsp;
regulatory standard is different: the jeopardy analysis looks at the&nbsp;
action's impact on survival and recovery of the species, while the&nbsp;
adverse modification analysis looks at the action's effects on the&nbsp;
designated habitat's contribution to the species' conservation. This&nbsp;
will, in many instances, lead to different results and different&nbsp;
regulatory requirements.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For 30 years prior to the Ninth Circuit's decision in Gifford&nbsp;
Pinchot, consistent with the 1986 regulations, we essentially combined&nbsp;
the jeopardy standard with the standard for destruction or adverse&nbsp;
modification of critical habitat when evaluating Federal actions that&nbsp;
affected currently occupied critical habitat. However, the court of&nbsp;
appeals ruled that the two standards are distinct and that adverse&nbsp;
modification evaluations require consideration of impacts on species&nbsp;
recovery. Thus, critical habitat designations may provide greater&nbsp;
regulatory benefits to the recovery of a species than would listing&nbsp;
alone.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are two limitations to the regulatory effect of critical&nbsp;
habitat. First, a section 7(a)(2) consultation is required only where&nbsp;
there is a Federal nexus (an action authorized, funded, or carried out&nbsp;
by any Federal agency)--if there is no Federal nexus, the critical&nbsp;
habitat designation of private lands itself does not restrict any&nbsp;
actions that destroy or adversely modify critical habitat. Second, the&nbsp;
designation only limits destruction or adverse modification. By its&nbsp;
nature, the prohibition on adverse modification is designed to ensure&nbsp;
that the conservation role and function of those areas that contain the&nbsp;
physical and biological features essential to the conservation of the&nbsp;
species or of unoccupied areas that are essential to the conservation&nbsp;
of the species is not appreciably reduced. Critical habitat designation&nbsp;
alone, however, does not require property owners to undertake specific&nbsp;
steps toward recovery of the species.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once an agency determines that consultation under section 7(a)(2)&nbsp;
of the Act is necessary, the process may conclude informally when we&nbsp;
concur in writing that the proposed Federal action is not likely to&nbsp;
adversely affect critical habitat. However, if we determine through&nbsp;
informal consultation that adverse impacts are likely to occur, then we&nbsp;
would initiate formal consultation, which would conclude when we issue&nbsp;
a biological opinion on whether the proposed Federal action is likely&nbsp;
to result in destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For critical habitat, a biological opinion that concludes in a&nbsp;
determination of no destruction or adverse modification may contain&nbsp;
discretionary conservation recommendations to minimize adverse effects&nbsp;
to primary constituent elements, but it would not suggest the&nbsp;
implementation of any reasonable and prudent alternative. We suggest&nbsp;
reasonable and prudent alternatives to the proposed Federal action only&nbsp;
when our biological opinion results in an adverse modification&nbsp;
conclusion.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As stated above, the designation of critical habitat does not&nbsp;
require that any management or recovery actions take

[[Page 57754]]

place on the lands included in the designation. Even in cases where&nbsp;
consultation has been initiated under section 7(a)(2) of the Act, the&nbsp;
end result of consultation is to avoid jeopardy to the species and/or&nbsp;
adverse modification of its critical habitat, but not specifically to&nbsp;
manage remaining lands or institute recovery actions on remaining&nbsp;
lands. Conversely, voluntary conservation efforts implemented through&nbsp;
management plans institute proactive actions over the lands they&nbsp;
encompass and are put in place to remove or reduce known threats to a&nbsp;
species or its habitat; therefore, implementing recovery actions. We&nbsp;
believe that in many instances the benefit to a species and/or its&nbsp;
habitat realized through the designation of critical habitat is low&nbsp;
when compared to the conservation benefit that can be achieved through&nbsp;
voluntary conservation efforts or management plans. The conservation&nbsp;
achieved through implementing HCPs or other habitat management plans&nbsp;
can be greater than what we achieve through multiple site-by-site,&nbsp;
project-by-project, section 7(a)(2) consultations involving&nbsp;
consideration of critical habitat. Management plans may commit&nbsp;
resources to implement long-term management and protection to&nbsp;
particular habitat for at least one and possibly additional listed or&nbsp;
sensitive species. Section 7(a)(2) consultations commit Federal&nbsp;
agencies to preventing adverse modification of critical habitat caused&nbsp;
by the particular project only, and not to providing conservation or&nbsp;
long-term benefits to areas not affected by the proposed project. Thus,&nbsp;
implementation of any HCP or management plan that considers enhancement&nbsp;
or recovery as the management standard may often provide as much or&nbsp;
more benefit than a consultation for critical habitat designation.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another benefit of including lands in critical habitat is that&nbsp;
designation of critical habitat serves to educate landowners, State and&nbsp;
local governments, and the public regarding the potential conservation&nbsp;
value of an area. This helps focus and promote conservation efforts by&nbsp;
other parties by clearly delineating areas of high conservation value&nbsp;
for the Peninsular bighorn sheep. In general, critical habitat&nbsp;
designation always has educational benefits; however, in some cases,&nbsp;
they may be redundant with other educational effects. For example, HCPs&nbsp;
have significant public input and may largely duplicate the educational&nbsp;
benefits of a critical habitat designation. Including lands in critical&nbsp;
habitat also would inform State agencies and local governments about&nbsp;
areas that could be conserved under State laws or local ordinances.

Conservation Partnerships on Non-Federal Lands

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most federally listed species in the United States will not recover&nbsp;
without cooperation of non-Federal landowners. More than 60 percent of&nbsp;
the United States is privately owned (National Wilderness Institute&nbsp;
1995, p. 2), and at least 80 percent of endangered or threatened&nbsp;
species occur either partially or solely on private lands (Crouse et&nbsp;
al. 2002, p. 720). Stein et al. (1995, p. 400) found that only about 12&nbsp;
percent of listed species were found almost exclusively on Federal&nbsp;
lands (90 to 100 percent of their known occurrences restricted to&nbsp;
Federal lands) and that 50 percent of federally listed species are not&nbsp;
known to occur on Federal lands at all.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given the distribution of listed species with respect to land&nbsp;
ownership, conservation of listed species in many parts of the United&nbsp;
States is dependent upon working partnerships with a wide variety of&nbsp;
entities and the voluntary cooperation of many non-Federal landowners&nbsp;
(Wilcove and Chen 1998, p. 1407; Crouse et al. 2002, p. 720; James&nbsp;
2002, p. 271). Building partnerships and promoting voluntary&nbsp;
cooperation of landowners are essential to our understanding the status&nbsp;
of species on non-Federal lands, and necessary for us to implement&nbsp;
recovery actions such as reintroducing listed species and restoring and&nbsp;
protecting habitat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many non-Federal landowners derive satisfaction from contributing&nbsp;
to endangered species recovery. We promote these private-sector efforts&nbsp;
through the Department of the Interior's Cooperative Conservation&nbsp;
philosophy. Conservation agreements with non-Federal landowners (HCPs,&nbsp;
safe harbor agreements, other conservation agreements, easements, and&nbsp;
State and local regulations) enhance species conservation by extending&nbsp;
species protections beyond those available through section 7&nbsp;
consultations. In the past decade, we have encouraged non-Federal&nbsp;
landowners to enter into conservation agreements, based on the view&nbsp;
that we can achieve greater species conservation on non-Federal land&nbsp;
through such partnerships than we can through regulatory methods (61 FR&nbsp;
63854; December 2, 1996).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many private landowners, however, are wary of the possible&nbsp;
consequences of attracting endangered species to their property.&nbsp;
Mounting evidence suggests that some regulatory actions by the Federal&nbsp;
Government, while well-intentioned and required by law, can (under&nbsp;
certain circumstances) have unintended negative consequences for the&nbsp;
conservation of species on private lands (Wilcove et al. 1996, pp. 5-6;&nbsp;
Bean 2002, pp. 2-3; Conner and Mathews 2002, pp. 1-2; James 2002, pp.&nbsp;
270-271; Koch 2002, pp. 2-3; Brook et al. 2003, pp. 1639-1643). Many&nbsp;
landowners fear a decline in their property value due to real or&nbsp;
perceived restrictions on land-use options where threatened or&nbsp;
endangered species are found. Consequently, harboring endangered&nbsp;
species is viewed by many landowners as a liability. This perception&nbsp;
results in anti-conservation incentives because maintaining habitats&nbsp;
that harbor endangered species represents a risk to future economic&nbsp;
opportunities (Main et al. 1999, pp. 1264-1265; Brook et al. 2003, pp.&nbsp;
1644-1648).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to some researchers, the designation of critical habitat&nbsp;
on private lands significantly reduces the likelihood that landowners&nbsp;
will support and carry out conservation actions (Main et al. 1999, p.&nbsp;
1263; Bean 2002, p. 2; Brook et al. 2003, pp. 1644-1648). The magnitude&nbsp;
of this outcome is greatly amplified in situations where active&nbsp;
management measures (such as reintroduction, fire management, and&nbsp;
control of invasive species) are necessary for species conservation&nbsp;
(Bean 2002, pp. 3-4). We believe that the judicious use of excluding&nbsp;
specific areas of non-federally owned lands from critical habitat&nbsp;
designations can contribute to species recovery and provide a superior&nbsp;
level of conservation than critical habitat alone.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The purpose of designating critical habitat is to contribute to the&nbsp;
conservation of threatened and endangered species and the ecosystems&nbsp;
upon which they depend. The outcome of the designation, triggering&nbsp;
regulatory requirements for actions funded, authorized, or carried out&nbsp;
by Federal agencies under section 7(a)(2) of the Act, can sometimes be&nbsp;
counterproductive to its intended purpose on non-Federal lands. Thus&nbsp;
the benefits of excluding areas that are covered by effective&nbsp;
partnerships or other conservation commitments can often be high.

Benefits of Excluding Lands With Approved Management Plans

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The benefits of excluding lands within approved long-term&nbsp;
management plans (including HCPs) from critical habitat designation&nbsp;
include relieving landowners, communities, and counties of any&nbsp;
additional regulatory burden that

[[Page 57755]]

might be imposed by critical habitat. Many conservation plans provide&nbsp;
conservation benefits not only to listed species, but to unlisted&nbsp;
sensitive species as well, resulting in enhanced ecosystem management.&nbsp;
Imposing an additional regulatory review as a result of the designation&nbsp;
of critical habitat may undermine conservation efforts and partnerships&nbsp;
in many areas. Designation of critical habitat within the boundaries of&nbsp;
management plans that provide conservation measures for a species could&nbsp;
be viewed as a disincentive to entities currently developing these&nbsp;
plans or contemplating them in the future, because one of the&nbsp;
incentives for undertaking conservation is greater ease of permitting&nbsp;
where listed species will be affected. Addition of a new regulatory&nbsp;
requirement would remove a significant incentive for undertaking the&nbsp;
time and expense of management planning.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A related benefit of excluding lands within management plans from&nbsp;
critical habitat designation is the unhindered, continued ability it&nbsp;
gives us to seek new partnerships with future plan participants,&nbsp;
including States, counties, local jurisdictions, conservation&nbsp;
organizations, and private landowners, which together can implement&nbsp;
conservation actions that we would be unable to accomplish otherwise.&nbsp;
Designating lands within approved management plan areas as critical&nbsp;
habitat would likely have a negative effect on our ability to establish&nbsp;
new partnerships to develop these plans, particularly plans that&nbsp;
address landscape-level conservation of species and habitats. By&nbsp;
preemptively excluding these lands, we preserve our current&nbsp;
partnerships and encourage additional conservation actions in the&nbsp;
future.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, both HCP and Natural Community Conservation Plan&nbsp;
(NCCP)-HCP applications require consultation, which would review the&nbsp;
effects of all HCP-covered activities that might adversely impact the&nbsp;
species under a jeopardy standard, including possibly significant&nbsp;
habitat modification (see definition of ``harm'' at 50 CFR 17.3), even&nbsp;
without the critical habitat designation. In addition, Federal actions&nbsp;
occurring within the plan area that may affect listed species would&nbsp;
still require consultation under section 7(a)(2) of the Act, and we&nbsp;
would review these actions for possibly significant habitat&nbsp;
modification, in accordance with the definition of harm referenced&nbsp;
above.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The information provided in the previous sections applies to all&nbsp;
the following discussions of the benefits of inclusion and exclusion of&nbsp;
critical habitat.

Areas Considered For Exclusion Under Section 4(b)(2) of the Act

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are proposing to exclude Tribal lands in Unit 1 in consideration&nbsp;
of Secretarial Order 3206, ``American Indian Tribal Rights, Federal&nbsp;
Tribal Trust Responsibilities, and the Endangered Species Act'' (June&nbsp;
5, 1997); the President's memorandum of April 29, 1994, ````Government-
to-Government Relations with Native American Tribal Governments'' (59&nbsp;
FR 22951); Executive Order 13175; and the relevant provision of the&nbsp;
Departmental Manual of the Department of the Interior (512 DM 2).&nbsp;
Furthermore, we are evaluating and considering the possible exclusion&nbsp;
of private lands in Unit 1 and 2A, which are covered under the draft&nbsp;
Coachella Valley Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan (MSHCP),&nbsp;
under section 4(b)(2) of the Act, and may exclude them from the final&nbsp;
revised critical habitat designation for the Peninsular bighorn sheep.&nbsp;
With regard to the draft Coachella Valley MSHCP plan area, we are only&nbsp;
considering private lands for exclusion at this time, while also&nbsp;
soliciting comment on the appropriateness of excluding CDFG and BLM&nbsp;
lands as Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) partners to the MSHCP. We&nbsp;
are considering the possible exclusion of the areas covered by the&nbsp;
draft MSHCP because we believe when the plan is finalized that:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) The lands' value for conservation will be preserved for the&nbsp;
foreseeable future by existing protective actions, and
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) They are appropriate for exclusion under the ``other relevant&nbsp;
factor'' provisions of section 4(b)(2) of the Act.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We specifically solicit comments on the inclusion or exclusion of&nbsp;
these areas. In the paragraphs below, we provide a detailed analysis&nbsp;
for consideration of exclusion of these lands under section 4(b)(2) of&nbsp;
the Act.

Proposed Exclusion of Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians Tribal&nbsp;
Lands Under Section 4(b)(2) of the Act--American Indian Tribal Rights,&nbsp;
Federal-Tribal Trust Responsibilities, and the Endangered Species Act

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In accordance with the Secretarial Order 3206, ``American Indian&nbsp;
Tribal Rights, Federal-Tribal Trust Responsibilities, and the&nbsp;
Endangered Species Act'' (June 5, 1997); the President's memorandum of&nbsp;
April 29, 1994, ``Government-to-Government Relations with Native&nbsp;
American Tribal Governments'' (59 FR 22951); Executive Order 13175; and&nbsp;
the relevant provision of the Departmental Manual of the Department of&nbsp;
the Interior (512 DM 2), we believe that fish, wildlife, and other&nbsp;
natural resources on Tribal lands are better managed under Tribal&nbsp;
authorities, policies, and programs than through Federal regulation&nbsp;
wherever possible and practicable. Based on this philosophy, we believe&nbsp;
that, in most cases, designation of tribal lands as critical habitat&nbsp;
provides very little additional benefit to threatened and endangered&nbsp;
species. Conversely, such designation is often viewed by tribes as&nbsp;
unwarranted and an unwanted intrusion into tribal self governance, thus&nbsp;
compromising the government-to-government relationship essential to&nbsp;
achieving our mutual goals of managing for healthy ecosystems upon&nbsp;
which the viability of threatened and endangered species populations&nbsp;
depend.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have determined that approximately 4,512 ac (1,826 ha) of tribal&nbsp;
land owned by the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians are essential&nbsp;
to the conservation of the Peninsular bighorn sheep, and are proposing&nbsp;
to exclude these lands under section 4(b)(2) of the Act. In making our&nbsp;
final decision with regard to these Tribal lands, we will be&nbsp;
considering several factors including our relationship with the Tribe,&nbsp;
the Tribe's current management of Peninsular bighorn sheep habitat, and&nbsp;
the Tribe's ongoing cooperation with us in the development of the Agua&nbsp;
Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians Tribal Habitat Conservation Plan&nbsp;
(Tribal HCP).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians highly values its&nbsp;
wildlife and natural resources, and is charged to preserve and protect&nbsp;
these resources under the Tribal Constitution. Consequently, the Tribe&nbsp;
has long worked to manage the habitat of wildlife on its lands,&nbsp;
including the habitat of endangered and threatened species. The Tribe&nbsp;
currently implements a conservation strategy for the Peninsular bighorn&nbsp;
sheep to protect and manage bighorn sheep habitat on Tribal lands (as&nbsp;
set forth in the draft Tribal Habitat Conservation Plan adopted by the&nbsp;
Tribe on or about November 11, 2002). This conservation strategy&nbsp;
requires conservation of at least 85 percent of bighorn sheep habitat&nbsp;
identified by the Tribe on Tribal lands and 100 percent of bighorn&nbsp;
sheep use areas and habitat linkages identified by the Tribe on Tribal&nbsp;
lands. These management measures provide a substantial conservation&nbsp;
benefit to the subspecies.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, we are currently working with the Tribe to develop the&nbsp;
first Tribal multiple-species HCP in the United States. Through this&nbsp;
cooperative effort, the Tribe has demonstrated a sustained commitment&nbsp;
to manage its lands in a

[[Page 57756]]

manner consistent with the subspecies' conservation. We are currently&nbsp;
processing the Tribe's application for a section 10(a)(1)(B) permit&nbsp;
based on a revised draft Tribal Habitat Conservation Plan (2007), and&nbsp;
anticipate publishing a Notice of Availability for public review in the&nbsp;
Federal Register in October 2007.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Tribal HCP area will cover approximately 36,720 ac (14,860 ha)&nbsp;
of land, including approximately 4,512 ac (1,826 ha) in Unit 1. The&nbsp;
Tribe's goals for conservation of Peninsular bighorn sheep are: (1)&nbsp;
Conserving habitat within the Tribal HCP plan area (PCE 1, 2, 3, 4, and&nbsp;
5); (2) maintaining connectivity, preventing fragmentation, and&nbsp;
allowing movement within key linkage areas (PCE 1 and 4); and (3)&nbsp;
adaptively managing habitat quality and subpopulations/ewe groups to&nbsp;
alleviate threats in the Tribal HCP plan area (Tribal HCP 2007, p. 4-
8). Conservation objectives of the draft Tribal HCP for Peninsular&nbsp;
bighorn sheep include the following: (1) Ensure implementation of the&nbsp;
Tribal HCP is consistent with the recovery plan (Service 2000); (2)&nbsp;
conserve a minimum of 17,692 ac (7,160 ha) of habitat within the plan&nbsp;
area; (3) conserve 100 percent of Use Areas (areas defined by the&nbsp;
Tribal HCP to have high functional value); (4) conserve land necessary&nbsp;
to maintain linkages/connectivity; (5) minimize direct and indirect&nbsp;
impacts from Covered Activities by ensuring implementation of&nbsp;
development standards, including avoidance and minimization measures;&nbsp;
(6) minimize impacts from recreational activities; (7) alleviate threat&nbsp;
of disease transfer from livestock or nonnative wildlife; (8) monitor&nbsp;
population size and mortality rates; (9) fund or undertake additional&nbsp;
studies regarding this subspecies; (10) ensure management action&nbsp;
thresholds are routinely assessed; (11) implement adaptive management;&nbsp;
and (12) conserve habitat quality through plan implementation (Tribal&nbsp;
HCP 2007, p. 4-9).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To aid in the public review of this proposed revised critical&nbsp;
habitat, we are providing maps of the areas that we are proposing to&nbsp;
exclude. Maps and GIS layers for areas proposed for exclusion are&nbsp;
available from the Carlsbad Fish and Wildlife Office (see ADDRESSES)&nbsp;
and on our Web site at <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/leaving.cgi?from=leavingFR.html&amp;log=linklog&amp;to=http://www.fws.gov/Carlsbad">http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/leaving.cgi?from=leavingFR.html&amp;log=linklog&amp;to=http://www.fws.gov/Carlsbad</a>.


The Benefits of Exclusion Outweigh the Benefits of Inclusion

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The general benefits of critical habitat described in the&nbsp;
``Benefits of Critical Habitat Designation'' section would apply to&nbsp;
habitat designated on Tribal lands. Activities occurring on Tribal&nbsp;
lands will generally involve a Federal nexus. However, as discussed&nbsp;
above, the Tribe is aware of the value of Tribal lands to the&nbsp;
conservation of the Peninsular bighorn sheep and currently implements&nbsp;
management measures that contribute to the conservation of the&nbsp;
subspecies and protect its essential habitat. Conservation measures&nbsp;
will continue to be implemented by the Tribe regardless of whether the&nbsp;
areas are designated as critical habitat. In light of this continued&nbsp;
commitment by the Tribe to manage its lands in a manner that promotes&nbsp;
the conservation of the Peninsular bighorn sheep, the designation of&nbsp;
critical habitat would provide minimal additional benefit to the&nbsp;
subspecies on these Tribal lands.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The designation of critical habitat would be expected to adversely&nbsp;
impact our working relationship with the Tribe and we believe that&nbsp;
Federal regulation through critical habitat designation would be viewed&nbsp;
as an unwarranted and unwanted intrusion into tribal natural resource&nbsp;
programs. Our working relationship with the Tribe has been extremely&nbsp;
beneficial in implementing natural resource programs of mutual&nbsp;
interest. The benefits of excluding Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla&nbsp;
Indians Tribal lands from critical habitat include: (1) The advancement&nbsp;
of our Federal Indian Trust obligations and our deference to tribal&nbsp;
conservation and natural resource management plans for their lands and&nbsp;
resources, which includes the Peninsular bighorn sheep and other&nbsp;
Federal trust species; (2) the maintenance of effective working&nbsp;
relationships to promote the conservation of the Peninsular bighorn&nbsp;
sheep and its habitat; (3) the allowance for continued meaningful&nbsp;
collaboration and cooperation on Peninsular bighorn sheep management&nbsp;
and other resources of interest to the Federal government; and (4) the&nbsp;
provision of conservation benefits to desert ecosystems and a host of&nbsp;
species, including the Peninsular bighorn sheep and its habitat, that&nbsp;
might not otherwise occur.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We believe that the Tribe should be the governmental entity to&nbsp;
manage and promote the conservation of the Peninsular bighorn sheep on&nbsp;
its lands. We recognize and endorse the Tribe's fundamental right to&nbsp;
provide for tribal resource management activities, including those&nbsp;
relating to Peninsular bighorn sheep. We have determined that the&nbsp;
identified benefits of excluding the Tribal lands from the critical&nbsp;
habitat designation outweigh the minimal benefits of inclusion, and are&nbsp;
proposing to exclude approximately 4,512 ac (1,826 ha) of Tribal lands&nbsp;
in Unit 1 from the final designation under section 4(b)(2) of the Act.

Exclusion Will Not Result in Extinction of the Species

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have determined that the exclusion of approximately 4,512 ac&nbsp;
(1,826 ha) from the final designation of critical habitat for&nbsp;
Peninsular bighorn sheep will not result in the extinction of the&nbsp;
subspecies because the Tribe currently implements a conservation&nbsp;
strategy for the Peninsular bighorn sheep that requires conservation of&nbsp;
at least 85 percent of bighorn sheep habitat identified by the Tribe on&nbsp;
Tribal lands and 100 percent of bighorn sheep use areas and habitat&nbsp;
linkages identified by the Tribe on Tribal lands. In addition, working&nbsp;
cooperatively with us, the Tribe has made substantial progress in&nbsp;
developing its Tribal HCP. Through this cooperative effort, the Tribe&nbsp;
has demonstrated a sustained commitment to manage its lands in a manner&nbsp;
consistent with the subspecies' conservation. Furthermore, the area&nbsp;
proposed for exclusion is occupied by the Peninsular bighorn sheep, and&nbsp;
the jeopardy standard of section 7 and routine implementation of&nbsp;
conservation measures through the section 7 consultation process also&nbsp;
provide assurances that the subspecies will not go extinct. The&nbsp;
proposed exclusion of critical habitat leaves these protections&nbsp;
unchanged from those that would exist if the proposed excluded areas&nbsp;
were designated as critical habitat. Therefore, we have determined that&nbsp;
the exclusion of the Tribal lands will not result in the extinction of&nbsp;
the subspecies.

Lands Covered by Management Plans--Exclusions Under Section 4(b)(2) of&nbsp;
the Act

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When performing the required analysis under section 4(b)(2) of the&nbsp;
Act, the existence of a management plan (HCPs as well as other types)&nbsp;
that considers enhancement or recovery of listed species as its&nbsp;
management standard is relevant to our weighing of the benefits of&nbsp;
inclusion of a particular area in the critical habitat designation. In&nbsp;
analyzing particular areas covered by management plans under section&nbsp;
4(b)(2) of the Act, we generally consider a number of factors including&nbsp;
the following:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) Whether the plan is complete and provides the same or better&nbsp;
level of protection from adverse modification or destruction than that&nbsp;
provided through a consultation under section 7(a)(2) of the Act;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) Whether there is a reasonable expectation that the conservation&nbsp;
management strategies and actions will

[[Page 57757]]

be implemented for the foreseeable future, based on past practices,&nbsp;
written guidance, or regulations; and
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) Whether the plan provides conservation strategies and measures&nbsp;
consistent with currently accepted principles of conservation biology.
Coachella Valley Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan (MSHCP)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We believe that the Coachella Valley MSHCP, when implemented, will&nbsp;
provide conservation strategies and measures consistent with the&nbsp;
conservation of the Peninsular bighorn sheep. We are confident that the&nbsp;
plan will be completed in the near future, and are considering the&nbsp;
exclusion of non-Federal lands covered by the plan that provide for the&nbsp;
conservation of the Peninsular bighorn sheep and its PCEs. We are&nbsp;
requesting comments on the benefit to the Peninsular bighorn sheep and&nbsp;
its PCEs from the conservation measures established by the Coachella&nbsp;
Valley MSHCP.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The draft MSHCP has been in development from the mid-1990s to&nbsp;
present. The following entities signed an MOU (Planning Agreement) to&nbsp;
govern the preparation of the MSHCP: the Coachella Valley Association&nbsp;
of Governments (CVAG); Cities of Cathedral City, Coachella, Desert Hot&nbsp;
Springs, Indian Wells, Indio, La Quinta, Palm Desert, Palm Springs, and&nbsp;
Rancho Mirage; County of Riverside; Service; California Department of&nbsp;
Fish and Game; BLM; U.S. Forest Service; and National Park Service.&nbsp;
Subsequently, the California Department of Transportation, Coachella&nbsp;
Valley Water District, Imperial Irrigation District, Riverside County&nbsp;
Flood Control and Water Conservation District, Riverside County&nbsp;
Regional Parks and Open Space District, Riverside County Waste&nbsp;
Management District, California Department of Parks and Recreation, and&nbsp;
Coachella Valley Mountains Conservancy decided to participate in&nbsp;
preparation of the MSHCP. The parties later amended the Planning&nbsp;
Agreement to also address the requirements of the Natural Community&nbsp;
Conservation Planning (NCCP) Act and prepared an NCCP pursuant to&nbsp;
California Fish and Game Code Section 2810. The Coachella Valley&nbsp;
Association of Governments, Coachella Valley Conservation Commission,&nbsp;
County of Riverside, Riverside County Flood Control and Water&nbsp;
Conservation District, Riverside County Regional Parks and Open Space&nbsp;
District, Riverside County Waste Resources Management District, City of&nbsp;
Cathedral City, City of Coachella, City of Indian Wells, City of Indio,&nbsp;
City of La Quinta, City of Palm Desert, City of Palm Springs, City of&nbsp;
Rancho Mirage, Coachella Valley Water District, Imperial Irrigation&nbsp;
District, Coachella Valley Mountains Conservancy, California Department&nbsp;
of Transportation, and California Department of Parks and Recreation&nbsp;
have submitted an application to the Service for a section 10(a)(1)(B)&nbsp;
permit under the Act.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The MSHCP area encompasses approximately 1.2 million ac (485,623&nbsp;
ha), of which 69,000 ac (27,923 ha) are Tribal lands and are not&nbsp;
included in the MSHCP, leaving a total of approximately 1.1 million ac&nbsp;
(445,154 ha) addressed by the MSHCP in Riverside County. BLM has been&nbsp;
an official participant in the draft Coachella Valley MSHCP planning&nbsp;
process and has committed, under their California Desert Conservation&nbsp;
Area Plan Amendment (CDCAPA), 95 percent of their public land base&nbsp;
within the conservation areas of the MSHCP to be managed consistent&nbsp;
with the Coachella Valley MSHCP once it is completed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CVAG has demonstrated a sustained commitment to develop the MSHCP&nbsp;
to comply with section 10(a)(1)(B) of the Act, the California&nbsp;
Endangered Species Act, and the State's NCCP program. On April 21,&nbsp;
2006, the Service published a notice of availability of the Final&nbsp;
Environmental Impact Statement/Environmental Impact Report (EIS/EIR)&nbsp;
for the MSHCP (71 FR 20719). On March 30, 2007, the Service published a&nbsp;
notice of availability of a supplement to the Final EIS for the MSHCP&nbsp;
(72 FR 15148).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The MSHCP adopted the Peninsular bighorn sheep habitat model&nbsp;
described in the 2000 recovery plan for this subspecies (Service 2000).&nbsp;
Accordingly, the MSHCP area includes 172,811 ac (69,934 ha) of modeled&nbsp;
Peninsular bighorn sheep habitat. These 172,811 ac (69,934 ha) include&nbsp;
the approximately 10,761 ac (4,354 ha) we are proposing in Unit 1 and&nbsp;
the approximately 74,998 ac (30,350 ha) we are proposing in Unit 2A.&nbsp;
The draft MSHCP proposes to ensure conservation of a minimum of 97&nbsp;
percent of all modeled habitat for Peninsular bighorn sheep as part of&nbsp;
the preferred alternative reserve design that includes large areas of&nbsp;
suitable habitat (CVAG 2007, p. 9-261). Approximately 78 percent of the&nbsp;
proposed conserved modeled habitat are within Existing Conservation&nbsp;
Lands and will be managed as part of the Reserve System (CVAG 2007, p.&nbsp;
9-261); the remaining 19 percent will also be conserved according to&nbsp;
the draft MSHCP (CVAG 2007, p. 9-261). Conservation objectives of this&nbsp;
draft MSHCP include: (1) Ensuring conservation of important habitat&nbsp;
(PCE 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5); (2) ensuring connectivity by preventing&nbsp;
fragmentation and maintaining biological corridors and linkages within&nbsp;
essential habitat to allow dispersal, provide for population&nbsp;
fluctuation, and enhance genetic diversity (PCE 1 and 4); and (3)&nbsp;
ensuring conservation of habitat quality through biological monitoring&nbsp;
and adaptive management (PCE 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) (CVAG 2007, p. 9-261).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the draft MSHCP, disturbance to Peninsular bighorn&nbsp;
sheep with implementation of the plan is expected to be low because:&nbsp;
(1) Conserved habitat areas are large enough to maintain self-
sustaining populations of Peninsular bighorn sheep and incorporate key&nbsp;
habitat elements for the subspecies; (2) implementation of the MSHCP is&nbsp;
consistent with the recovery strategy delineated in the 2000 recovery&nbsp;
plan; (3) implementation of the conservation objectives to protect&nbsp;
habitat for this subspecies will provide connectivity; and (4) lands in&nbsp;
the MSHCP reserve system would be managed and monitored to address&nbsp;
significant edge effect problems, human disturbance, fragmentation,&nbsp;
impacts from exotic species, and other stressors to Peninsular bighorn&nbsp;
sheep (CVAG 2007, p. 9-261).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although not yet completed and implemented, CVAG has made&nbsp;
significant progress in the development of its MSHCP to meet the&nbsp;
requirements outlined in section 10(a)(1)(B) of the Act. In light of&nbsp;
the Service's confidence that CVAG will reach a successful conclusion&nbsp;
to its MSHCP development process, we are evaluating and considering the&nbsp;
possible exclusion of approximately 19,211 ac (7,774 ha) of private&nbsp;
land within their preferred alternative reserve design from the final&nbsp;
revised critical habitat designation for Peninsular bighorn sheep&nbsp;
depending on the progress made on the draft MSHCP between now and the&nbsp;
publication of the final rule. We are requesting comments on the&nbsp;
benefits to the Peninsular bighorn sheep and its PCEs from the&nbsp;
conservation measures established by the MSHCP.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Included within the MSHCP plan area are BLM lands, outside of the&nbsp;
Coachella Valley Preserve System, which we are soliciting comment on&nbsp;
the appropriateness of excluding from the final revised critical&nbsp;
habitat designation based on BLM's official participation in the draft&nbsp;
Coachella Valley MSHCP planning process and commitment under their&nbsp;
CDCAPA to manage their lands consistent with the Coachella Valley MSHCP&nbsp;
once it is completed. We are also soliciting comment on the&nbsp;
appropriateness of excluding CDGF

[[Page 57758]]

lands within the MSHCP plan area based on their involvement with the&nbsp;
Coachella Valley MSHCP.
Provisions of the Coachella Valley MSHCP Specific to Peninsular Bighorn&nbsp;
Sheep
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In general, we find that the benefits of critical habitat&nbsp;
designation on lands within pending HCPs that cover those species are&nbsp;
small, while the benefits of excluding such lands from designation of&nbsp;
critical habitat are substantial. We are evaluating and considering the&nbsp;
possible exclusion of approximately 19,211 ac (7,774 ha) of private&nbsp;
land within CVAG's MSHCP preferred alternative reserve design area from&nbsp;
the designation of critical habitat. The evaluation process involves&nbsp;
determining whether the benefits of excluding these lands from Units 1&nbsp;
and 2A outweigh the benefits of including these lands. We expect the&nbsp;
PCEs required by Peninsular bighorn sheep to benefit by the&nbsp;
conservation measures outlined in the MSHCP and as described above. In&nbsp;
summary, these conservation measures include: Conservation of habitat&nbsp;
and implementation of the MSHCP consistent with the recovery plan&nbsp;
(Service 2000); preservation of essential habitat and connectivity;&nbsp;
biological monitoring and adaptive management; and minimization of&nbsp;
disturbance and edge effects. These specific conservation actions,&nbsp;
avoidance and minimization measures, and management for Peninsular&nbsp;
bighorn sheep and PCEs, if implemented, are expected to exceed any&nbsp;
conservation value that could be provided as a result of regulatory&nbsp;
protections afforded through a critical habitat designation.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Designation of critical habitat alone does not achieve recovery or&nbsp;
require management of those lands identified in the critical habitat&nbsp;
rule. The exclusion of these lands that we are currently evaluating and&nbsp;
considering for possible exclusion from the final critical habitat&nbsp;
designation would help preserve the partnerships that we have developed&nbsp;
with the local jurisdictions and project proponents in the development&nbsp;
of the MSHCP. The benefits of excluding these lands from critical&nbsp;
habitat, should the MSHCP be finalized and implemented, are expected to&nbsp;
outweigh the minimal benefits of including these lands as critical&nbsp;
habitat, including the educational benefits of critical habitat&nbsp;
designation through informing the public of areas important for the&nbsp;
long-term conservation of Peninsular bighorn sheep. Such educational&nbsp;
benefits can still be accomplished from materials provided on our&nbsp;
Internet website and through the overall designation process, including&nbsp;
the notice and public comment period, which will occur whether or not&nbsp;
these particular areas are designated.

Economics

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are preparing an analysis of the economic impacts of proposing&nbsp;
revised critical habitat for the Peninsular bighorn sheep. We will&nbsp;
announce the availability of the draft economic analysis as soon as it&nbsp;
is completed, at which time we will seek public review and comment. At&nbsp;
that time, copies of the draft economic analysis will be available for&nbsp;
downloading from the Internet at <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/leaving.cgi?from=leavingFR.html&amp;log=linklog&amp;to=http://carlsbad.fws.gov">http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/leaving.cgi?from=leavingFR.html&amp;log=linklog&amp;to=http://carlsbad.fws.gov</a>, or by&nbsp;

contacting the Carlsbad Fish and Wildlife Office directly (see&nbsp;
ADDRESSES). We may exclude areas from the final revised rule based on&nbsp;
the information in the economic analysis.

Peer Review

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In accordance with our joint policy published in the Federal&nbsp;
Register on July 1, 1994 (59 FR 34270), we are requesting the expert&nbsp;
opinions of at least three appropriate independent specialists&nbsp;
regarding this proposed rule. The purpose of peer review is to ensure&nbsp;
that our proposed revised critical habitat designation is based on&nbsp;
scientifically sound data, assumptions, and analyses. We have invited&nbsp;
these peer reviewers to comment during this public comment period on&nbsp;
our specific assumptions and conclusions in this proposed revision of&nbsp;
critical habitat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will consider all comments and information we receive during&nbsp;
this comment period on this proposed revised critical habitat rule&nbsp;
during our preparation of a final determination. Accordingly, our final&nbsp;
decision may differ from this proposal.

Public Hearings

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Act provides for one or more public hearings on this proposal,&nbsp;
if we receive any request for hearings. We must receive your request&nbsp;
for a public hearing within 45 days after the date of publication in&nbsp;
the Federal Register. Send your request to the person named in FOR&nbsp;
FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT. We will schedule public hearings on this&nbsp;
proposal, if any are requested, and announce the dates, times, and&nbsp;
places of those hearings, as well as how to obtain reasonable&nbsp;
accommodations, in the Federal Register and local newspapers at least&nbsp;
15 days before the first hearing.

Required Determinations

Regulatory Planning and Review

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In accordance with Executive Order (E.O.) 12866, this document is a&nbsp;
significant rule in that it may raise novel legal and policy issues.&nbsp;
However, based on information available from the previous designation,&nbsp;
we do not anticipated that it will have an annual effect on the economy&nbsp;
of $100 million or more or to affect the economy in a material way. To&nbsp;
determine the economic consequences of designating the specific area as&nbsp;
critical habitat, we are preparing a draft economic analysis of this&nbsp;
proposed action, which will be available for public comment. This&nbsp;
economic analysis also will be used to determine compliance with E.O.&nbsp;
12866, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Small Business Regulatory&nbsp;
Enforcement Fairness Act, E.O. 12630, and E.O. 13211.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, E.O. 12866 directs Federal agencies promulgating&nbsp;
regulations to evaluate regulatory alternatives (OMB Circular A-4,&nbsp;
September 17, 2003). Under Circular A-4, once an agency determines that&nbsp;
the Federal regulatory action is appropriate, the agency must consider&nbsp;
alternative regulatory approaches. Because the determination of&nbsp;
critical habitat is a statutory requirement under the Act, we must&nbsp;
evaluate alternative regulatory approaches, where feasible, when&nbsp;
promulgating a designation of critical habitat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In developing our designations of critical habitat, we consider&nbsp;
economic impacts, impacts to national security, and other relevant&nbsp;
impacts under section 4(b)(2) of the Act. Based on the discretion&nbsp;
allowable under this provision, we may exclude any particular area from&nbsp;
the designation of critical habitat providing that the benefits of such&nbsp;
exclusion outweigh the benefits of specifying the area as critical&nbsp;
habitat and that such exclusion would not result in the extinction of&nbsp;
the species. As such, we believe that the evaluation of the inclusion&nbsp;
or exclusion of particular areas, or a combination of both, constitutes&nbsp;
our regulatory alternative analysis for designations.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will announce the availability of the draft economic analysis in&nbsp;
the Federal Register and in local newspapers so that it is available&nbsp;
for public review and comments. At that time, the draft economic&nbsp;
analysis will also be available on the Internet at <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/leaving.cgi?from=leavingFR.html&amp;log=linklog&amp;to=http://carlsbad.fws.gov">http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/leaving.cgi?from=leavingFR.html&amp;log=linklog&amp;to=http://carlsbad.fws.gov
</a>, or by contacting the Carlsbad Fish and Wildlife&nbsp;

Office directly (see ADDRESSES).

Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA: 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., as&nbsp;
amended by the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act&nbsp;
(SBREFA) of 1996), whenever an agency must

[[Page 57759]]

publish a notice of rulemaking for any proposed or final rule, it must&nbsp;
prepare and make available for public comment a regulatory flexibility&nbsp;
analysis that describes the effects of the rule on small entities&nbsp;
(small businesses, small organizations, and small government&nbsp;
jurisdictions). However, no regulatory flexibility analysis is required&nbsp;
if the head of the agency certifies the rule will not have a&nbsp;
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.&nbsp;
SBREFA amended RFA to require Federal agencies to provide a statement&nbsp;
of the factual basis for certifying that the rule will not have a&nbsp;
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, we lack the available economic information necessary&nbsp;
to provide an adequate factual basis for the required RFA finding.&nbsp;
Therefore, we defer the RFA finding until completion of the draft&nbsp;
economic analysis prepared under section 4(b)(2) of the Act and E.O.&nbsp;
12866. This draft economic analysis will provide the required factual&nbsp;
basis for the RFA finding. Upon completion of the draft economic&nbsp;
analysis, we will announce availability of the draft economic analysis&nbsp;
of the proposed revised designation in the Federal Register and reopen&nbsp;
the public comment period for the proposed revised designation. We will&nbsp;
include with this announcement, as appropriate, an initial regulatory&nbsp;
flexibility analysis or a certification that the rule will not have a&nbsp;
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities&nbsp;
accompanied by the factual basis for that determination. We have&nbsp;
concluded that deferring the RFA finding until completion of the draft&nbsp;
economic analysis is necessary to meet the purposes and requirements of&nbsp;
the RFA. Deferring the RFA finding in this manner will ensure that we&nbsp;
make a sufficiently informed determination based on adequate economic&nbsp;
information and provide the necessary opportunity for public comment.

Unfunded Mandates Reform Act

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In accordance with the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (2 U.S.C. 1501&nbsp;
et seq.), we make the following findings:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) This proposed rule will not produce a Federal mandate. In&nbsp;
general, a Federal mandate is a provision in legislation, statute, or&nbsp;
regulation that would impose an enforceable duty upon State, local, or&nbsp;
Tribal governments, or the private sector, and includes both ``Federal&nbsp;
intergovernmental mandates'' and ``Federal private sector mandates.''&nbsp;
These terms are defined in 2 U.S.C. 658(5)-(7). ``Federal&nbsp;
intergovernmental mandate'' includes a regulation that ``would impose&nbsp;
an enforceable duty upon State, local, or Tribal governments'' with two&nbsp;
exceptions. It excludes ``a condition of Federal assistance.'' It also&nbsp;
excludes ``a duty arising from participation in a voluntary Federal&nbsp;
program,'' unless the regulation ``relates to a then-existing Federal&nbsp;
program under which $500,000,000 or more is provided annually to State,&nbsp;
local, and Tribal governments under entitlement authority,'' if the&nbsp;
provision would ``increase the stringency of conditions of assistance''&nbsp;
or ``place caps upon, or otherwise decrease, the Federal Government's&nbsp;
responsibility to provide funding,'' and the State, local, or Tribal&nbsp;
governments ``lack authority'' to adjust accordingly. At the time of&nbsp;
enactment, these entitlement programs were: Medicaid; AFDC work&nbsp;
programs; Child Nutrition; Food Stamps; Social Services Block Grants;&nbsp;
Vocational Rehabilitation State Grants; Foster Care, Adoption&nbsp;
Assistance, and Independent Living; Family Support Welfare Services;&nbsp;
and Child Support Enforcement. ``Federal private sector mandate''&nbsp;
includes a regulation that ``would impose an enforceable duty upon the&nbsp;
private sector, except (i) a condition of Federal assistance or (ii) a&nbsp;
duty arising from participation in a voluntary Federal program.''
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The designation of critical habitat does not impose a legally&nbsp;
binding duty on non-Federal Government entities or private parties.&nbsp;
Under the Act, the only regulatory effect is that Federal agencies must&nbsp;
ensure that their actions do not destroy or adversely modify critical&nbsp;
habitat under section 7. While non-Federal entities that receive&nbsp;
Federal funding, assistance, or permits, or that otherwise require&nbsp;
approval or authorization from a Federal agency for an action may be&nbsp;
indirectly impacted by the designation of critical habitat, the legally&nbsp;
binding duty to avoid destruction or adverse modification of critical&nbsp;
habitat rests squarely on the Federal agency. Furthermore, to the&nbsp;
extent that non-Federal entities are indirectly impacted because they&nbsp;
receive Federal assistance or participate in a voluntary Federal aid&nbsp;
program, the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act would not apply, nor would&nbsp;
critical habitat shift the costs of the large entitlement programs&nbsp;
listed above onto State governments.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) Due to current public knowledge of the subspecies' protection,&nbsp;
the prohibition against take of the subspecies both within and outside&nbsp;
of the areas proposed in this rule for designation and the fact that&nbsp;
the vast majority of the areas proposed in this rule are currently&nbsp;
designated as critical habitat, we do not believe that this proposed&nbsp;
rule will significantly or uniquely affect small governments.&nbsp;
Therefore, a Small Government Agency Plan is not required. However, as&nbsp;
we conduct our economic analysis, we will further evaluate this issue&nbsp;
and revise this assessment if appropriate.

Takings

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In accordance with E.O. 12630 (Government Actions and Interference&nbsp;
with Constitutionally Protected Private Property Rights), we have&nbsp;
analyzed the potential takings implications of designating revised&nbsp;
critical habitat for the Peninsular bighorn sheep in a takings&nbsp;
implications assessment. The takings implications assessment concludes&nbsp;
that this proposed revised designation of critical habitat for the&nbsp;
Peninsular bighorn sheep does not pose significant takings implications&nbsp;
for lands within or affected by the designation.

Federalism

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In accordance with E.O. 13132 (Federalism), this proposed rule does&nbsp;
not have significant Federalism effects. A Federalism assessment is not&nbsp;
required. In keeping with Department of the Interior and Department of&nbsp;
Commerce policy, we requested information from, and coordinated&nbsp;
development of, this proposed revised critical habitat designation with&nbsp;
appropriate State resource agencies in California. Critical habitat is&nbsp;
already designated for the Peninsular bighorn sheep. If finalized, this&nbsp;
proposal to revise the designated critical habitat will result in a&nbsp;
significant decrease in the area designated. Thus, the designation of&nbsp;
revised critical habitat for the Peninsular bighorn sheep would not&nbsp;
impose any additional regulatory restrictions to those currently in&nbsp;
place and, therefore, has little incremental impact on State and local&nbsp;
governments and their activities. The designation may have some benefit&nbsp;
to these governments because the areas that contain the features&nbsp;
essential to the conservation of the subspecies are more clearly&nbsp;
defined, and the PCEs of the habitat necessary to the conservation of&nbsp;
the subspecies are specifically identified. This information does not&nbsp;
alter where and what federally sponsored activities may occur. However,&nbsp;
it may assist local governments in long-range planning (rather than&nbsp;
having them wait for case-by-case section 7 consultations to occur).

[[Page 57760]]

Civil Justice Reform

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In accordance with E.O. 12988 (Civil Justice Reform), the Office of&nbsp;
the Solicitor has determined that this proposed rule does not unduly&nbsp;
burden the judicial system and that it meets the requirements of&nbsp;
sections 3(a) and 3(b)(2) of the Order. We have proposed revised&nbsp;
critical habitat in accordance with the provisions of the Act. This&nbsp;
proposed rule uses standard property descriptions and identifies the&nbsp;
PCEs within the areas proposed for designation to assist the public in&nbsp;
understanding the habitat needs of the Peninsular bighorn sheep.

Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This proposed rule does not contain any new collections of&nbsp;
information that require approval by OMB under the Paperwork Reduction&nbsp;
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). This rule will not impose&nbsp;
recordkeeping or reporting requirements on State or local governments,&nbsp;
individuals, businesses, or organizations. An agency may not conduct or&nbsp;
sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of&nbsp;
information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.

National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321 et. seq.)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is our position that, outside the jurisdiction of the Circuit&nbsp;
Court of the United States for the Tenth Circuit, we do not need to&nbsp;
prepare environmental analyses as defined by NEPA (42 U.S.C. 4321 et&nbsp;
seq.) in connection with designating critical habitat under the Act. We&nbsp;
published a notice outlining our reasons for this determination in the&nbsp;
Federal Register on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244). This assertion was&nbsp;
upheld by the Circuit Court of the United States for the Ninth Circuit&nbsp;
Court (Douglas County v. Babbitt, 48 F.3d 1495 (9th Cir. Ore. 1995),&nbsp;
cert. denied 116 S. Ct. 698 (1996)).

Clarity of the Rule

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are required by Executive Orders 12866 and 12988 and by the&nbsp;
Presidential Memorandum of June 1, 1998, to write all rules in plain&nbsp;
language. This means that each rule we publish must:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) Be logically organized;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) Use the active voice to address readers directly;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c) Use clear language rather than jargon;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (d) Be divided into short sections and sentences; and
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (e) Use lists and tables wherever possible.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you feel that we have not met these requirements, send us&nbsp;
comments by one of the methods listed in the ADDRESSES section. To&nbsp;
better help us revise the rule, your comments should be as specific as&nbsp;
possible. For example, you should tell us the numbers of the sections&nbsp;
or paragraphs that are unclearly written, which sections or sentences&nbsp;
are too long, the sections where you feel lists or tables would be&nbsp;
useful, etc.

Government-to-Government Relationship With Tribes

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In accordance with the President's memorandum of April 29, 1994,&nbsp;
Government-to-Government Relations with Native American Tribal&nbsp;
Governments' (59 FR 22951), E.O. 13175, and the Department of the&nbsp;
Interior's manual at 512 DM 2, we readily acknowledge our&nbsp;
responsibility to communicate meaningfully with recognized Federal&nbsp;
Tribes on a government-to-government basis. In accordance with&nbsp;
Secretarial Order 3206 of June 5, 1997 (American Indian Tribal Rights,&nbsp;
Federal-Tribal Trust Responsibilities, and the Endangered Species Act),&nbsp;
we readily acknowledge our responsibilities to work directly with&nbsp;
Tribes in developing programs for healthy ecosystems, to acknowledge&nbsp;
that tribal lands are not subject to the same controls as Federal&nbsp;
public lands, to remain sensitive to Indian culture, and to make&nbsp;
information available to Tribes. We have identified Tribal lands that&nbsp;
meet the definition of critical habitat for the Peninsular bighorn&nbsp;
sheep, and have included them in this proposal. However, we are&nbsp;
proposing to exclude all Tribal lands from the final critical habitat&nbsp;
designation under section 4(b)(2) of the Act (see ``Proposed Exclusion&nbsp;
of Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians Tribal Lands Under Section&nbsp;
4(b)(2) of the Act'' for a detailed discussion). We will continue to&nbsp;
coordinate with the Tribe during the designation process.

Energy Supply, Distribution, or Use

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On May 18, 2001, the President issued an Executive Order (E.O.&nbsp;
13211; Actions Concerning Regulations That Significantly Affect Energy&nbsp;
Supply, Distribution, or Use) on regulations that significantly affect&nbsp;
energy supply, distribution, and use. E.O. 13211 requires agencies to&nbsp;
prepare Statements of Energy Effects when undertaking certain actions.&nbsp;
While this proposed rule to designate revised critical habitat for the&nbsp;
Peninsular bighorn sheep is a significant regulatory action under E.O.&nbsp;
12866 in that it may raise novel legal and policy issues, we do not&nbsp;
expect it to significantly affect energy supplies, distribution, or&nbsp;
use. Therefore, this action is not a significant energy action, and no&nbsp;
Statement of Energy Effects is required. However, we will further&nbsp;
evaluate this issue as we conduct our economic analysis, and review and&nbsp;
revise this assessment as warranted.

Bighorn Sheep (Peninsular Ranges) (Ovis canadensis nelsoni)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Riverside, San Diego,&nbsp;
and Imperial Counties, California, on the maps below.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for the&nbsp;
Peninsular bighorn sheep are:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) Moderate to steep, open slopes (20 to 60 percent) and canyons,&nbsp;
with canopy cover of 30 percent or less (below 4,600 feet (1,402&nbsp;
meters) elevation in the Peninsular Ranges) that provide space for&nbsp;
sheltering, predator detection, rearing of young, foraging and&nbsp;
watering, mating, and movement within and between ewe groups.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) Presence of a variety of forage plants, indicated by the&nbsp;
presence of shrubs (e.g., Ambrosia spp., Caesalpinia spp., Hyptis spp.,&nbsp;
Sphaeralcea spp., Simmondsia spp.), that provide a primary food source&nbsp;
year round, grasses (e.g., Aristida spp., Bromus spp.) and cacti (e.g.,&nbsp;
Opuntia spp.) that provide a source of forage in the fall, and forbs&nbsp;
(e.g., Plantago spp., Ditaxis spp.) that provide a source of forage in&nbsp;
the spring.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iii) Steep, rugged, slopes (60 percent slope or greater) (below&nbsp;
4,600 feet (1,402 meters) elevation in the Peninsular Ranges) that&nbsp;
provide secluded space for lambing as well as terrain for predator&nbsp;
evasion.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iv) Alluvial fans, washes, and valley bottoms that provide&nbsp;
important foraging areas where nutritious and digestible plants can be&nbsp;
more readily found during times of drought and lactation and that&nbsp;
provide and maintain habitat connectivity by serving as travel routes&nbsp;
between and within ewe groups, adjacent mountain ranges, and important&nbsp;
resources areas, such as foraging areas and escape terrain.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (v) Intermittent and permanent water sources that are available&nbsp;
during extended dry periods and that provide relatively nutritious&nbsp;
plants and drinking water.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures (such as&nbsp;
buildings, aqueducts, roads, and other paved areas) and the land on&nbsp;
which they are located existing within the legal boundaries on the&nbsp;
effective date of this rule.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4) Critical habitat map units. Data layers defining map units were&nbsp;
created on a base of USGS 1:24,000 maps, and critical habitat units&nbsp;
were then mapped using Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5) Note: Index map of critical habitat units for the Peninsular&nbsp;
bighorn sheep (Map 1) follows:
