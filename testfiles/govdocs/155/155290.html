                                       			 for the tentative tax liability,

                                       30--is timely filed, and any enclosed payment is timely paid. See  IRM 3.11.3.5 and  LEM 20.1.2.

                                    if the taxpayer meets the criteria that will allow relief from a penalty.
                                    See Exhibit 20.1.1&#8211;3 of IRM 20.1.1, Introduction and Penalty Relief,

                                 <p>The Service will abate the FTF/FTP penalty when the taxpayer shows reasonable
                                    cause and not willful neglect for failure to file a return or pay tax as required.
                                    In some instances the abatement will only apply to the portion of the penalty
                                    for the period the taxpayer meets relief criteria.

                                          <p>Reasonable cause determinations must be made on the individual facts and

                                          <p>Generally, the taxpayer must pay the tax due before the Service will abate
                                             a FTP penalty for reasonable cause. The penalty continues to accrue until
                                             the tax is paid. The taxpayer may have reasonable cause for some months, but
                                             not for others. A final determination cannot be made until after the tax is
                                             paid. FTP abatements on accounts with unpaid tax compound re-computations
                                             and require adjustments to the 25% maximum applicable rate, increasing the
                                             possibility of an incorrect penalty assessment. The Service is not denying
                                             the taxpayer's statutory right to reasonable cause consideration; the Service
                                             is defining the pre-conditions for administering the provision. There is no
                                             statutory requirement that the tax has to be paid in full before a FTP abatement
                                             request can be considered or can in fact be made. In the same way, there is
                                             no statutory requirement that the Service has to consider a FTP penalty abatement
                                             before the tax is fully paid. Thus, this guideline is decided per administrative
                                             discretion in the interests of the taxpayer and the Service. It is not in
                                             the taxpayer's interest for the Service to consider or effect FTP penalty
                                             abatements on accounts with outstanding tax due, as the penalty continues
                                             to accrue and often leads to the taxpayer having to make a second request
                                             for abatement. As a further example, if the Service were to consider and allow
                                             an abatement of FTP on a return filed five months late with unpaid tax, and
                                             the <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>% FTP is abated for the first five months, the FTF rate
                                             goes from 4<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>% to 5%, effectively transferring the decreased
                                             FTP amount over to an increased FTF amount, creating a wash, while the maximum
                                             applicable FTP rate that had gone down to 22<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>% is re-started
                                             once again at 25%. These type scenarios do not provide quality taxpayer relations
                                             and only serve to multiply confusions. See  IRM 20.1.1.3.5.1

                                          <p>The reasonable cause exception for FTF and FTP penalties under  IRC section 6651(a)(1) and  IRC
                                             section 6651(a)(2) requires the taxpayer to satisfy the burden
                                             of proving that the failure to timely file a return and pay tax was in fact
                                             due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect. Reasonable cause requires
                                             the taxpayer to demonstrate that he exercised ordinary business care and prudence
                                             but was nevertheless unable to file/pay within the prescribed time. Willful
                                             neglect involves a conscious, intentional failure or reckless indifference.

                                    reasonable cause that applies for current and past conditions will be equally
                                    applicable tomorrow, next year, and for the future duration of the outstanding
                                    balance. A FTP penalty abatement, pre-determined with respect to future conditions,
                                    can seldom be objectively valid. An exception to this general rule involves
                                    the first-time-abate provision in  IRM 20.1.1.3.5.1.

                                    IRC section 6651(a)(2) is recalculated on the amount showing due

                                    When adjusting the tax on a return that was filed late, determine if the FTF/FTP

                                          <p>Example: The 2004  Form 1120 was due
                                             March 15, 2005, but was filed four months late on June 27, 2005, with tax
                                             of $50,000, prepayment credits of $43,000 and balance due of $7,000 paid in
                                             full with the return. FTF and FTP were assessed. An allowable NOL (TC 295)
                                             of $60,000 from TY 2005 was subsequently carried back to TY 2004. The FTF/FTP
                                             penalties originally assessed on TY 2004 are not recalculated on the decreased
                                             tax, even though the carryback removed the tax of $7,000 on which the FTF/FTP
                                             was originally calculated.

                                          <p>In the example above, if the refunded NOL is subsequently audited and
                                             disallowed, the FTP penalty would only apply under

                                             when the total amount due is $100,000 or more) from assessment. Since the
                                             FTF penalty was not re-calculated/reduced in proportion to the original NOL
                                             refund, it is not applied on the portion of any tax deficiency attributable
                                             to the NOL disallowance.

                                 of $600 with the return. The FTF penalty is calculated at 4<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>%
                                 a month, times three months, times $600 = $81. The MFTF penalty applies because
                                 the FTF penalty of $81 is less than the lesser of $100 or the amount showing
                                 due on the return ($600.) The MFTF penalty is therefore $100.

                                 month, times five months, times $600 = $135. The MFTF penalty does not apply
                                 because $135 is not less than the lesser of $100 or the amount showing due
                                 on the return ($600.)

                                 $90 due and paid in full. The regular FTF applies at 4<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>% a
                                 month, times three months, times $90 = $12.15. Since this is less than the
                                 lesser of $100 or the $90 due on the return, the lesser of $100 or $90 applies.
                                 In this case the MFTF is the $90 showing due on the return.

                                             assessed on February 19, 2006. The FTF penalty applies at a rate of 5% a month,

                                             Full payment is received April 30, 2006. FTP penalty is calculated at <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>% a month beginning after 21 days from assessment, i.e., from

                              <p>Example: Taxpayer filed a TY 2004 return five months late on August
                                 19, 2005 with unpaid balance due of $6,000. The maximum FTF of $1,350 applies:
                                 4<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>% a month times five months times $6,000 = $1,350. FTP under IRC section 6651(a)(2) continues running at <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>% a month from return due date on $6,000. The 1% rate under  IRC section 6651(d) is triggered on December 4, 2005
                                 and first applies after the next monthly accrual period beginning after December
                                 15, 2005. Taxpayer receives a CP 2000 notice showing additional tax due of
                                 $1,200 on unreported interest income. Taxpayer does not respond and $1,200
                                 is assessed (TC 290) on March 6, 2006. FTP under  IRC
                                 section 6651(a)(3) first applies on March 28, 2006 at 1% a month
                                 on $1,200. The March 28, 2006 start date is determined by  
                                 IRC section 6651(a)(3). The 1% rate under  
                                 IRC section 6651(d) applies immediately because the 1% FTP penalty
                                 rate was already running on the unpaid balance originally due from the return
                                 due date. However, once an account is fully paid, a subsequent assessment
                                 will begin to accrue at the <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>% rate. This subsequent assessment
                                 will also be subject to the above trigger dates for the 1% rate.

                                 IRC section 6651(f) increases the FTF penalty under  IRC section 6651(a)(1) from 5% a month to 15% a month,
                                 from a maximum 25% to 75%. FFTF is assessed with TC 240 using Reference Number
                                 (RN) 635 when it applies in relation to tax showing due on the return as filed.
                                 FFTF on a tax deficiency is assessed with TC 240 using Reference Number 686.

                                          similar. The civil fraud penalty requires an underpayment which is attributable
                                          to the willful and knowing intent to defraud. The FFTF penalty requires a

                                          are the same.

                                 should include the FTF penalty as an alternative position in the event that
                                 the FFTF penalty is not sustained upon appeal or in litigation. The alternative
                                 FTF penalty is calculated on the exam deficiency times 5% a month (without
                                 the <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>% reduction for FTP) times the number of months the FTF
                                 penalty was applied on the return as originally filed. FFTF is calculated
                                 on the exam deficiency times 15% a month also for the same number of months
                                 the FTF penalty was applied on the return as originally filed.

                                 on the return as originally filed (TC 160 or 166) must be reversed with TC
                                 161 or TC 167 and the FFTF assessed in its place. The FFTF assessment on the

                                 to the installment agreement under  IRC section 6159

                                     IRC section 6032 requires banks maintaining
                                    a common trust fund to file annual information returns by the period ending
                                    three months and 15 days after the end of the fiscal year (or April 15 for
                                    calendar year filers). No particular form is prescribed for making this return,
                                    but if  Form 1065 is used, it should reflect
                                    all items of gross income and deductions of the fund, and identify all participants
                                    and their proportionate share. See  LEM 20.1.2.
