<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>B. Overthrow of the <I>Kapu</I>
System</B></FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>1. Traditional Religious System Kept
Intact During Kamehameha's Reign</B></P>

<P ALIGN="justify">A major event in Hawaiian history occurred in 1819,
shortly after the death of King Kamehameha, with the overthrow of the
ancient <I>kapu</I> system. Indeed, E. G. Craighill Handy has gone so
far as to refer to this as the "Hawaiian Cultural Revolution." [<A
HREF="historyn.htm#54">4</A>] During his reign, Kamehameha steadfastly
adhered to the traditional social and religious customs of Hawaiian
society that maintained the superiority and power of the chiefs and
priests. Kamehameha, as other chiefs before him, regarded the
<I>kapu</I> system as the central force stabilizing the political and
social systems of the culture.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">It has been suggested, however, that at times the
king questioned the advisability of strict observance of the <I>kapu</I>
and pondered thoughtfully the continuing performance of traditional
religious practices. His continuing dialogue with a variety of European
visitors and advisors and his awareness of subtle changes in the
political and social environment of the islands undoubtedly prompted
much soul-searching on this subject. But his upbringing in traditional
ways strongly influenced his behavior, and he probably perceived more
benefits than impediments to the smooth running of his government from
continued adherence to the <I>kapu</I> system. It may also be that he
was not wholly convinced that the only alternative suggested to him,
Christianity, would provide his people with a better way of life. And
so, as Hawaiian consul-general Manley Hopkins later stated</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="justify">. . . to the end of his life, the King [Kamehameha]
continued devotions to his idols. He was probably a very sceptical
<I>[sic]</I> worshipper; but he looked upon the national religion as a
great state instrument, which it was better on his part to support by
his patron age. [<A HREF="historyn.htm#55">5</A>] </P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="justify">While Kamehameha ruled, no resistance to the
<I>kapu</I> system was allowed. Any persons brave enough to dare
infractions of the rules, who were discovered, were summarily executed
up until the time of his death. [<A HREF="historyn.htm#56">6</A>] But as
he lay dying, it is said, he suggested that his successor should give
the question of continuing allegiance to the <I>kapu</I> system some
thought, and that perhaps the system should be maintained only if he
survived. [<A HREF="historyn.htm#57">7</A>] </P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Even prior to the king's death, however, some
Hawaiians, whose transgressions had not been discovered by the chiefs or
priests, had defied the <I>kapu</I> without experiencing dire punishment
from the gods. This must have provided food for thought. In addition,
during Kamehameha's reign, skepticism of the religious system had grown
on the part of the commoners. This resulted from several factors: the
growing oppressiveness of the restrictions and of the tax burdens and
military services required of the people; increasing interaction with
foreigners, whose ridicule and disregard of the restrictions did not
appear to bring them either misfortune or death; and some awareness of
the abolition of a similar system in the Society Islands without ill
effects. [<A HREF="historyn.htm#58">8</A>] </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>2. Kamehameha's Death Provides
Opportunity for Religious Reform</B></P>

<P ALIGN="justify">It is not surprising then that Kamehameha's death in
1819 might precipitate a dramatic change in the social, political, and
religious systems of the country. For although Kamehameha had continued
the traditional ways of his ancestors, he had also opened the door to
European influences. In fact, some Hawaiians, notably members of the
<I>ali'i,</I> had already acquired many of the outward manners and
accoutrements of European civilization during the final years of
Kamehameha's reign.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Kamehameha II's unfortunate "fondness for drinking,
carousing, general debauchery, and . . . unsatiable taste for Western
trade goods taxed much of his ability to rule the kingdom." [<A
HREF="historyn.htm#59">9</A>] Ka'ahumanu, meanwhile, as mentioned, had
stated that because of uncertainties as to Liholiho's abilities, her
husband had placed her next in authority to oversee the government and
act as guardian of the realm. In view of Liholiho's rather weak
personality and the fact that he was content to be a follower rather
than a leader, the strong-willed Ka'ahumanu would have little trouble in
making changes she desired in the kingdom. One of these involved ending
the <I>kapu</I> system. Aiding her in this endeavor were Keopuolani, the
new king's mother and the highest-ranking chiefess of the ruling family;
Kalanimoku, functioning as prime minister; and Hewahewa, the last high
priest of the Pa'ao lineage.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">On the morning after his father's death, Liholiho
left Kailua, which had been defiled by death, for Kawaihae in Kohala, as
was the custom. During his absence, as was also the custom, the
population committed all kinds of excesses, breaking the <I>kapu</I>
with impunity. Although the usual mourning ceremonies on the death of a
king took place, no sacrifices occurred to provide the old king with
companions in the next world. During this mourning period, the dead
chief's bones were secreted in a cave, the traditional action that
ritually disassociated the mandate to rule from the dead king so that
his heir could re-establish it on his return to the area. After the
requisite ten days of seclusion had passed, Liholiho returned to assume
power, at which time he was also supposed to re-establish the
<I>kapu</I> system, something he did not do. Instead he left again for
Kawaihae in the Kohala district, where he took up residence until
October, probably hoping to avoid having to make some important
decisions concerning land redistribution, requests by the <I>ali'i</I>
to share in the sandalwood trade, and whether or not to break the
<I>kapu,</I> an action he knew Ka'ahumanu and others favored.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">During the new king's absence, Ka'ahumanu had begun
instigating for reform. Her motives and those of the small group of
influential individuals who allied with her have been speculated upon
for years. Ka'ahumanu was stubborn, ambitious, and no doubt tired of the
restraints upon her sex. In addition, if serious political questions
were considered within <I>heiau,</I> where spiritual power might
influence decision making, she would have been unable to co-rule
effectively because she could not enter those structures. Kalanimoku,
who was not a high-ranking chief, would not be adversely affected by
depriving others of their <I>kapu</I> prerogatives. (He and his brother
Boki had been secretly baptized by a Roman Catholic chaplain on board
the French ship <I>L'Uranie</I> captained by Louis de Freycinet while
Liholiho was in residence at Kawaihae. It is not clear, however, whether
either man completely understood the meaning of the ceremony.)
Keopuolani, though of very high rank, was easily influenced by
Ka'ahumanu. The high priest Hewahewa, who appears to have had nothing to
gain by the overthrow of idolatry, is thought to have participated in
the rebellion simply due to a deep personal conviction of the
inconsistencies of the religious system of which he was head. In
addition, there possibly existed some conflict and friction over status
within the government between Kekuaokalani, keeper of Ku, and Hewahewa.
It was Hewahewa's strong support that ensured the success of this
endeavor.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>3. Liholiho Abolishes the
<I>Kapu</I> System</B></P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Ultimately Ka'ahumanu advised Liholiho to return to
Kailua, having already alerted him to the fact that she was ready to
abolish the <I>kapu</I> system upon his return. Having been raised
during the peaceful time of his father's rule over a united kingdom, the
young heir had little training in either civil or military matters. In
addition, being of a gentle, affectionate, and light-hearted
disposition, he was averse to conflict over the matter despite his
lingering feelings of loyalty to the old system under which he had been
raised. He therefore reacted with mixed feelings to Ka'ahumanu's
declaration. Realizing that he would soon be forced to make a decision,
and uncertain as to the correct course he should take, Liholiho's return
to Kailua was slow and filled with feasting, drinking, and dancing to
delay events as long as possible.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The restriction against "free eating," the ability of
men and women to eat the same foods at the same table, was one of the
most significant aspects of the <I>kapu</I> system. As stated earlier in
this report, certain items denied to women were either considered
aspects of the male gods or were used as sacrificial offerings to them
and therefore were <I>kapu.</I> Because it was considered highly
symbolic of all the constraints on women, the eating <I>kapu</I> became
the focal point of Ka'ahumanu's efforts to overthrow the system.
Therefore, upon Liholiho's arrival in Kailua, approximately six months
after the death of his father, a feast was prepared in welcome. It was
attended by several foreigners as well as such trusted counselors as
John Young. In accordance with native custom, separate tables were set
up for the sexes. Young and several chiefs described the ensuing scene
as the young king, who had been drinking fairly steadily in an attempt
to settle his nerves, ordered his attendants to carry prohibited food to
the women's table, at which he deliberately sat down to eat &#151; the
public, symbolic act of ending the <I>kapu</I> system. Seeing that the
influential dignitaries of the kingdom present appeared to approve this
act, several chiefs followed the king's example. [<A
HREF="historyn.htm#510">10</A>] According to David Kalakaua, following
this act of common eating,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="justify">an indescribable scene ensued. "The <I>tabu</I> is
broken! the <I>tabu</I> is broken!" passed from lip to lip, swelling
louder and louder as it went, until it reached beyond the pavilion.
There it was taken up in shouts by the multitude, and was soon wafted on
the winds to the remotest corners of Kona. Feasts were at once provided,
and men and women ate together indiscriminately. . . . At the conclusion
of the royal feast a still greater surprise bewildered the people. "We
have made a bold beginning," said Hewahewa to the king. . . "but the
gods and <I>heiaus</I> cannot survive the death of the <I>tabu."</I>
"Then let them perish with it!" exclaimed Liholiho, now nerved to
desperation at what he had done. "If the gods can punish, we have done
too much already to hope for grace. They can but kill, and we will test
their powers by inviting the full measure of their wrath." [<A
HREF="historyn.htm#511">11</A>] </P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="justify">No matter what the actual words, it was clear that
Liholiho was prepared to go all the way. With the agreement of the high
priest, Liholiho sent out orders to destroy the images and temples
throughout the kingdom and to generally ignore all former <I>kapu.</I>
Legend has it that, immediately resigning from his office of high
priest, Hewahewa then set fire to the nearest <I>heiau.</I> Francisco de
Paula Marin seems not to have fully appreciated the significance of this
momentous time, noting in his journal on November 7, 1819, only that:
"This day all the women ate pork and they burnt all the churches on the
island." [<A HREF="historyn.htm#512">12</A>] Lifting the <I>kapu</I>
restrictions that protected the sanctity of the chiefs and priests
somewhat eroded their separateness from the common people, while
destruction of the temples and images removed many of the trappings of
their status. Both actions, resulting in cessation of public rituals,
worship, and sacrifices, accomplished dissolution of the priesthood as
an organized body. [<A HREF="historyn.htm#513">13</A>] </P>

<P ALIGN="justify">It would take one final action, however, to stabilize
the new state of affairs. This involved Liholiho meeting on the field of
battle his cousin Kekuaokalani, to whom Kamehameha had bequeathed, in
addition to his war god Ku-ka'ili-moku, co-responsibility for the care
of the gods, their temples, and the support of their worship. [<A
HREF="historyn.htm#514">14</A>] Kekuaokalani, who was next in line for
the position of high chief after Hewahewa, and who took his charges from
the late king seriously, assumed the responsibility of leading those who
opposed the abolition of the <I>kapu</I> system. These included priests,
some courtiers, and the traditional territorial chiefs of the middle
rank. [<A HREF="historyn.htm#515">15</A>] </P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Kekuaokalani demanded that Liholiho withdraw his
edicts against the priesthood, which traditionalists believed should
still be preserved; permit rebuilding of the temples; and dismiss both
Kalanimoku and Ka'ahumanu. [<A HREF="historyn.htm#516">16</A>]
Kamehameha II refused. At a battle fought at Kuamo'o on the island of
Hawai'i, the king's better-armed forces, led by Kalanimoku, not only
defeated the last defenders of the Hawaiian gods, of their temples and
priesthoods, and of the ancient organized religion, but also effectively
weakened belief in the power of the gods and the inevitability of divine
punishment for those who opposed them.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>4. Some Vestiges of Old Practices
Remain</B></P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The Reverend Sheldon Dibble reported, with true
missionary vigor and some exaggeration, that</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="justify">The war having thus resulted in the entire overthrow
of the idolatrous party, both chiefs and people united with one voice
and in the strongest terms to reproach the folly and impotency of their
former idol gods. . . . Their rage toward idols by which they had been
so long enthralled and who had now failed them in the day of battle was
unbounded. They began the work of destruction. Some of their idols they
cast into the sea, some they burnt, and some they treated with contempt
and used for fuel. They rushed to the temples and tore them to the
ground. [<A HREF="historyn.htm#517">17</A>] </P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="justify">According to Gilbert Mathison, visiting the islands
about 1822, "so complete was the work of destruction, that, in the
course of a few months, neither sacrifices nor religious observances of
any sort were kept, or even thought of, by the inhabitants." [<A
HREF="historyn.htm#518">18</A>] The Reverend Daniel Tyerman, who
departed from the London Missionary Society to visit various stations in
the South Sea islands, China, India, and other places between 1821 and
1829, noted in 1822 that</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="justify">Mr. Young informs us that though idolatry is
abolished, yet the multitude of gods of wood and stone, formerly
worshipped, have been rather hidden than extirpated, many of its
inveterate abettors still hoping for a counter-revolution in their
favor; a notion fostered by the priests, who have lost their occupation,
but naturally exercise their subtle influence to recover it. Not a
single image has been brought to us for sale, and the only one that we
have obtained was a gift from the governor. [<A
HREF="historyn.htm#519">19</A>] </P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="justify">About this same time, however, Frederic Shoberl
recounted that</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="justify">the king and queen of Atooi [Kaua'i] . . . made a
tour round the island of Owhyhee [Hawai'i], during which above a hundred
idols were discovered at one place in caves situated among the
mountains: these were all burned together; and many more were destroyed
in other parts of the island during this tour. When idolatry was
formally abolished in 1819, these images were concealed by those who
were adverse to the change. [<A HREF="historyn.htm#520">20</A>] </P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="justify">By 1826 the <I>Missionary Herald</I> reported
that</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="justify">There are still, in many places on the islands,
multitudes who continue in rather a secret manner to worship their old
false gods, but the number is every month growing less. [<A
HREF="historyn.htm#521">21</A>] </P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="justify">Frederick Debell Bennett spent time in Hawai'i in
1834 and 1835, where he noted that since the arrival of the
missionaries,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="justify">religious and general education has advanced so
rapidly over all the islands, that idolatrous ceremonies are totally
obliterated, and the rising generation now regard a ruined morai, or a
wooden deity, with the same traditionary interest that the British
attach to their druidical remains. [<A
HREF="historyn.htm#522">22</A>]</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="justify">In actuality, although destruction of temple
structures and their adorning large-scale images were an obvious action
that could be readily observed and monitored, the rapidity with which
smaller images were destroyed is much less clear. The missionaries, who
were closely watching these events, realized that</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="justify">Where the idols were so very numerous, and there were
so many household gods, it is not to be supposed that all would be
destroyed at once. Though the burning was general, some idols would be
clandestinely preserved. [<A HREF="historyn.htm#523">23</A>] </P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="justify">One early writer looked back on this destructive
activity with some regret. Constance Cumming lamented:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="justify">With all possible reverence for the great work so
nobly accomplished by the early missionaries, it is certainly a matter
much to be regretted that, in the wholesale sweeping away of idolatry,
so many subjects deeply interesting to the ethnologist and the
antiquarian should have been hopelessly swamped, and everything in any
way bearing on the old system treated as being either so puerile as to
be beneath contempt, or so evil as to be best forgotten with all speed.
[<A HREF="historyn.htm#524">24</A>] </P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="justify">Numerous household gods were not abandoned. Because
they were viewed as family guardians, they continued to be venerated
during the disintegration of other government-related trappings of the
old religion. [<A HREF="historyn.htm#525">25</A>] And certainly it was
almost too much to expect that mere renunciation of these age-old
traditions by the king and destruction of those physical structures
connected with the ancient religious practices would immediately erase
the training and mindset inculcated in the Hawaiians from childhood.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Stephenie Levin points out that although the formal
state religion had been destroyed, certain non-institutionalized beliefs
that were mystical in nature and that dealt with immediate needs in
daily life continued to flourish. Most Hawaiians, in fact, maintained
the belief that supernatural assistance could be obtained from gods
lower in the pantheon, such as Pele, and from ancestral spirits. [<A
HREF="historyn.htm#526">26</A>] </P>

<P ALIGN="justify">William Davenport agrees, making it clear that
Hawai'i was not totally lacking in religion until the arrival of the New
England missionaries because beliefs in sorcery, the power of ancestral
deities, and other aspects of the old religion, such as curing rituals,
persisted. These had probably been the more important practices of their
religion for most Hawaiians anyway, Davenport surmises, because worship
of the primary gods had been mainly the privilege of the <I>ali'i</I>
and the head of government. [<A HREF="historyn.htm#527">27</A>] </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>5. Discussion on the Overthrow of
the <I>Kapu</I> System</B></P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The reasons for the overthrow of the <I>kapu</I>
system by the Hawaiian people and the events leading to it have been a
subject of speculation by scholars for many years and deserve some
mention here. The whole question of voluntary culture change is
certainly an intriguing one and has been explained through the years as
a result of religious and social factors as well as political and
economic motivations. The abolition of the <I>kapu</I> system in Hawai'i
was an extraordinary action for two primary reasons. First, it was an
abandonment of traditional religious practices with no specific thought
of replacing them with another system. It was not a religious
reformation instigated by foreign traders or missionaries as was the
case with other isolated Polynesian societies being contacted by the
Western world. [<A HREF="historyn.htm#528">28</A>] And second, the
movement was undertaken by those who appeared to have the most to lose;
high-ranking officials sought to abolish an ideological system that
legitimized their authority, even though there did not exist a strong
demand among the people to do so.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Why did this religious revolution succeed? Why was
resistance to the change so ineffectual? Primarily because the ruling
monarch, influential officials, and the high priest &#151; those who had
the most authority in the kingdom &#151; led the revolution. Also the
timing of the change was an asset. It occurred at the end of an era and
in the midst of general unrest caused by the death of a much-beloved
king. In addition, at this particular phase in the development of the
nation, Hawaiian society was receptive to new ideas and changes.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The Reverend William Ellis ventures that Liholiho's
reasons for supporting the abolition of the <I>kapu</I> system included
first, possibly some desire to better the condition of women in Hawaiian
society, and second, a wish to lessen the power of the priests and the
amount of resources channeled for their support. [<A
HREF="historyn.htm#529">29</A>] Certainly this was accomplished to some
degree, because abolishing the organized religion effectively
emasculated the hereditary priesthoods by reducing the need for their
social and ritualistic functions to reinforce the existing political
authority, thus effectively removing them as any kind of threat to the
ruler. An unfortunate by-product of their loss of position, however, was
decreased use of the skills, intellectual attainments, and special
knowledge and abilities possessed by that class. [<A
HREF="historyn.htm#530">30</A>] </P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Was the abolition primarily a result of
dissatisfaction with the system on the part of the two most powerful
women in the kingdom &#151; Ka'ahumanu and Keopuolani &#151; who
received the opportunity to exercise their influence at a time when
faith in the old socio-economic system was weak? Or as Anthropologist
Alfred L. Kroeber has suggested, did the principle of "Cultural Fatigue"
lead to this revolution, meaning that the over-elaboration of this
traditional pattern of religious and political behavior finally resulted
in a burdensome system with which the people became disillusioned and
which they finally abandoned? [<A HREF="historyn.htm#531">31</A>] This
explanation downplays the influences exerted by changing social and
physical environmental factors resulting from the new European
influences impacting Hawaiian society, which others believe must have
shaped its thinking to some degree.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Robert Redfield, for instance, stresses the
importance of this culture contact and has suggested that the overthrow
of the <I>kapu</I> system exemplified planned, conscious reform on the
part of the Hawaiians as a result of the "unsettling impact" of Western
customs and moral attitudes. He argues that the social strain and
ideological incongruities presented by exposure to European civilization
increased the probabilities of such a change in a culture that had shown
in the past a proclivity to abandon gods who did not achieve for them
what they wanted. [<A HREF="historyn.htm#532">32</A>] This explanation,
however, fails to address the social and political developments that had
taken place in Hawaiian society during the previous years that enabled
the change to take place so easily. [<A HREF="historyn.htm#533">33</A>]
</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Several anthropologists have used sound arguments for
both political and economic motivations. Malcolm Webb, for instance,
questions whether personal desires, such as the preference of two women
for more personal freedom, would be powerful enough to cause such a
great change unless other factors were also at work undermining the
traditional process. He also questioned how on this level one could
explain the ready acquiescence of the king and the high priest, who
stood to lose considerable status, or whether this would even adequately
explain the motives of the royal women involved, who, because of their
high rank, actually suffered less from the <I>kapu</I> system than the
common women. [<A HREF="historyn.htm#534">34</A>] Webb believes it
doubtful such a drastic change would have occurred without foreign
contact showing the availability of alternative systems. However,
although the Hawaiians were probably struck by the fact that foreigners
could violate <I>kapu</I> without harm, Webb believes the Hawaiians were
not overly disturbed by this because they realized these people were not
part of the same genealogical-ceremonial system. [<A
HREF="historyn.htm#535">35</A>] </P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Webb states that during the years preceding the
overthrow of the old religion, rivalry among closely related members of
ruling kin groups and the channeling of much of the country's resources
to ritual rather than to the increase of foreign trade or as bonus
payments for armies were the leading causes of the failure of the early
Hawaiian chiefs to consolidate state power. By the time of the
overthrow, however, an intense desire had grown on the part of the local
chiefs for foreign goods, to such an extent that they were heavily in
debt and needed to divert resources from other uses. [<A
HREF="historyn.htm#536">36</A>] </P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Webb's argument is that the abolition of the
<I>kapu</I> system was linked to the ongoing, although probably
unrealized, transformation of the Hawaiian culture from a tribal to a
state entity. [<A HREF="historyn.htm#537">37</A>] European trade goods,
especially firearms, and the surplus wealth gained from their position
in the center of the goods distribution network, had by this time
enabled senior tribal chiefs to gain some measure of power. That power,
independent of tribal tribute, enabled them to safeguard their new
status by hiring and paying additional retainers. As the power of local
chiefs increased in this manner, they had less need of a leadership
system based on prestige, seniority, or rank-status within a kinship
group. Their increased wealth and power gained from trade and military
force lessened their need as well for the ritual requirements of the
traditional system but increased their need for the freedom of action
enabling fluidity within a changing social system. Elimination of the
sacred nature of the socio-political system would also remove
restrictions on the ruler in terms of the time devoted to ritual
practices, his ability to move freely around his kingdom, and his
ability to wage war without tedious ceremonials. [<A
HREF="historyn.htm#538">38</A>] Webb states that for all these reasons,
"the downgrading of the traditional religious institutions should in
fact be a very common or even typical occurrence during state formation
and consolidation." [<A HREF="historyn.htm#539">39</A>] The weakening of
traditional religious constraints is especially likely to occur, Webb
argues, whenever chieftainships, characterized by the extension of power
through kinship and ritual ties, start to develop into states. [<A
HREF="historyn.htm#540">40</A>] </P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Webb believes, however, that Hawai'i was unique in
that foreign missionaries did not influence the overthrow of the old
religion. He points out the continuing worship of some gods and the
veneration of royal tombs, such as Hale-o-Keawe, and suggests that if
the missionaries had not arrived on the scene, some variation of
traditional religious practices would have been instituted, controlled
by the monarch, that did not interfere with the increasing power and
efficiency of the government. [<A HREF="historyn.htm#541">41</A>] In
terms of timing of the abolition of the old religion, it occurred at a
point when the older ideological system had become seriously inhibiting
and when power adequate to replace it had arisen.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Webb characterizes Hawai'i in 1819 as illustrating
the changeover from ritual to secular controls that usually accompanies
the growth of state societies. The event comprised, he thinks, a
"functionally necessary adjustment," similar to those that any culture
would have to make at a certain stage of development in response to a
specific problem in order to survive. [<A
HREF="historyn.htm#542">42</A>] </P>

<P ALIGN="justify">This does not detract from the importance of
individual actions in the event, because the persons initiating changes
would be suffering "status conflict or deprivation" within the current
system. But, they could only be successful in their rebellion if the
cultural situation also demanded the change. And possibly the people
most likely to initiate such a change would be those of high rank,
rather than oppressed commoners, who were less bound by traditional
codes of behavior and freer to innovate and move toward needed cultural
changes. [<A HREF="historyn.htm#543">43</A>] Webb ends his discussion
with the intriguing statement that it was not necessary that individuals
such as Ka'ahumanu and her followers completely understand the full
ramifications or the ultimate advantages of their actions before
initiating innovative measures serving the survival needs of their
society. Such acts, he states, "would be performed because when they
were done things &#151; for some reason &#151; simply <I>worked</I>
better." [<A HREF="historyn.htm#544">44</A>] In other words, personal
motivations may not be that important a consideration in the overthrow
of the <I>kapu</I> system, for</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="justify">the novelty-prone Hawaiian rulers certainly did not
realise that they were part of "the process of inevitable political
consolidation within a newly formed secondary state," but they must have
had enough perspicacity to see that the old religious system, in
supporting a social structure which worked against the new social
reality, was somehow "wrong" and had to be changed to one which was more
congruent with the new order. The motives of the innovators themselves
may, of course, have been either cynical <I>or</I> pious . . . and the
end product would surely have been the same. [<A
HREF="historyn.htm#545">45</A>] </P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="justify">William Davenport also cites economic and political
reasons for the repudiation of the <I>kapu</I> system, and at the same
time explains why members of the <I>ali'i</I> would naturally be the
principal instigators of reform. It was the aristocratic class, he
reasons, that had had the most contact with Europeans after Cook's
discovery and thus had been subject to the strongest acculturative
influences. In time they began to demand more and more imported goods,
which led to the need for increasing commercial trade. As a consequence,
they had to divert large amounts of labor from traditional subsistence
activities to the procurement of sandalwood, the major trade item,
straining the Hawaiian economy and a labor force that was already
decreasing due to disease.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Therefore, in addition to simply wanting the
increased power that would result from abolition of the old
socio-political system, Davenport thinks the <I>ali'i</I> believed that
the economic crisis necessitated freeing the culture from the burden of
supporting the various priesthoods. Levin places little weight on this
argument because, she states, it is difficult to determine how
oppressive a burden the support of the priesthood was and whether the
advantages gained would really have been worth repudiating an entire
religious system. [<A HREF="historyn.htm#546">46</A>] </P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Davenport's argument, in other words, also looks at
the overthrow from a political perspective &#151; "as a deliberate
political action of the legitimate government of the Hawaiian Islands."
[<A HREF="historyn.htm#547">47</A>] It was, as Webb surmises, a
political act resulting from a political decision in response to stress.
[<A HREF="historyn.htm#548">48</A>] Ka'ahumanu, Webb believes,
instigated the <I>kapu</I> violations as an "intuitive political
response to preserve the regime that . . . she had helped to expand and
consolidate" under Kamehameha I. [<A HREF="historyn.htm#549">49</A>] She
could clearly see that the traditional dual succession system
handicapped the government by providing optional leaders who could
easily rally opposing factions. By pressuring for a break in this
tradition, she raised an issue sure to create factions in the
population, but at a time when the opposition was not yet fully
organized. The faster an encounter could be forced, she knew, the less
opposition could be raised. Therefore she pushed the issue as quickly as
she could after Kamehameha's death. [<A HREF="historyn.htm#550">50</A>]
</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">This argument states that the major goal of
Ka'ahumanu at that time was to maintain the strength of the monarchy.
Davenport points out that the priesthood had functioned as one of the
most important checks against despotism; if a ruler alienated his
priests, they could weaken his rule or cause his overthrow by
interpreting divinations and auguries as adverse to his regime. If not
supported by the priesthoods in ancient Hawai'i, a ruler often found
himself in serious political trouble. To remove their status, therefore,
would strengthen the power of the ruler, a huge gain worth the price of
lowering the value of divine rank.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">In addition, even the commoners had surely begun to
realize, Davenport believes, that guns possessed as much ability to make
things happen as did the gods. That fact was probably abundantly clear
to Hewahewa, who had served as Kamehameha l's advisor in religious
matters during his rise to power. Hewahewa might have sensed that the
power of the priesthood would wane as the relationship of Hawai'i's
monarchs with Europeans increased. At the same time Kalanimoku, as
senior minister, war leader, and an intimate of the late king, could see
that trade was vital to the maintenance of governmental power because it
was the only way to gain guns and ships. Destruction of the organized
priesthoods, which claimed a large segment of the labor and produce of
the land, could only strengthen his regime both politically and
economically. The interesting aspect of the event, Davenport points out,
is that those who sought to change the system did it through the head of
state, not in the form of a <I>coup d'etat.</I> The strategy, a
successful one, was to reform from within in what amounted to a
constitutional reform of traditional government. [<A
HREF="historyn.htm#551">51</A>] </P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Davenport also discusses the economic side of the
overthrow. He believes the political crisis resulting in the change was
a result of the government's stress from trying to pay for its
unrestrained purchases of foreign goods. The commoners were kept so busy
providing sandalwood for trade that they did not have enough time to
cultivate food for their own needs. That affected not only their
well-being, but also lessened the amount of tribute and taxes they were
able to contribute to support the court and the priesthoods as well as
the many religious rituals and military campaigns. This steadily
deteriorating situation was forcing the central government to a decision
&#151; to either renounce its commercial goals or reorganize the
allocation of its resources. At the same time, the <I>ali'i'</I> s
strict religious doctrine had been shaken by contact with Europeans.
Therefore, there existed little opposition to an action that, in
eliminating the priesthoods, would free the country's resources for
other uses and also increase the political authority of the paramount
chief and his followers. Despite the loss of some benefits heretofore
prescribed by religious sanctions, the king could retain his power
through armed force. As Webb suggests, Davenport believes the timing of
the overthrow was all important. It took place during a period of
instability, when the <I>kapu</I> was already being violated as part of
the traditional mourning ritual for a beloved leader. Instead of
reinstating the <I>kapu,</I> an action that would have reaffirmed its
perceived value to the country, Liholiho joined the violators and thus
ensured the system's destruction. [<A HREF="historyn.htm#552">52</A>]
</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">All things considered, Davenport agrees with Webb's
evolutionary interpretation of events. He strongly believes the
abolition of the <I>kapu</I> was a deliberate political response to
political crisis caused by the growing power of the monarch and local
chieftains and by an increase in commercial trade, and was further
stimulated by growing religious doubts and the problems caused by a
declining population. Those internal problems were intensified by
continuing social and economic contact with Europeans. The government
response to lower this stress level involved governmental reform that
would enable reorganization of the admininstrative infrastructure to
allow more efficient allocation of the country's economic resources. [<A
HREF="historyn.htm#553">53</A>] </P>

<P ALIGN="justify">John L. Fischer also believes the overthrow was
successful because it was a smart political move and because it
coincided with the popular sentiment at that time. He states his belief
that prior to Kamehameha's unification of the islands, "sociocultural
forces" were increasing the elaborateness of the state religion; after
unification, there were forces at work to simplify it. [<A
HREF="historyn.htm#554">54</A>] However, he states, it usually was more
typical for dissatisfied members of the general population to demand
change than for the central government to initiate reform without
pressure from the people, missionaries, or foreign governments. In most
developing societies, he states, chiefs and high-ranking persons usually
attempted to maintain the aboriginal religion and its authority-
preserving sanctions. Hawai'i was different because of the political
conditions and the political functions served by <I>kapu</I> and the
native religion. Fischer thought the old religion's major purpose prior
to Kamehameha's reign was to militarily and economically support local
chieftainships, a function made unnecessary by unification of the
islands. Whereas in earlier times, this had created a close relationship
&#151; the local chiefs defending the people against enemies and
organizing the production and distribution of resources, Fischer
believes the abolition of the <I>kapu</I> system was a manifestation of
a new alliance &#151; uniting the central government and the commoners
against the local aristocracy. [<A HREF="historyn.htm#555">55</A>] </P>

<P ALIGN="justify">An essential part of Fischer's argument is that class
conflict had always existed between the local chiefs and commoners in
aboriginal Hawai'i. [<A HREF="historyn.htm#556">56</A>] One reason was
the hardship of supplying labor and food to the chiefs, time-consuming
tasks that put additional stress on the commoners and that depleted
their own food supply. Contact with the West increased this stress by
leading to the need for additional production by the people for trade
purposes; in addition, unification of the islands had already resulted
in an additional level of administrative hierarchy for the commoners to
support. Added to this was conflict between the central government and
its retinue and lower-ranking chiefs. [<A
HREF="historyn.htm#557">57</A>] Because of this, Fischer thinks it would
only have been sound political strategy, to guarantee their continued
authority, for the central government to attempt to ally itself more
closely with the commoners; certainly one way to dramatically accomplish
this would be by abolishing the <I>kapu.</I> [<A
HREF="historyn.htm#558">58</A>] </P>

<P ALIGN="justify">From another viewpoint, Stephenie Levin points out
that the immediate period after Kamehameha l's death was one of unrest
regarding land tenure rights, which traditionally on the death of a
paramount ruler reverted to his successor, who redistributed them.
Ka'ahumanu was a member of the <I>ali'i</I> group to whom Kamehameha had
deeded land outright. She must have realized that the <I>kapu</I> system
was adverse to the interests of her kin group in retaining these lands.
As a member of the central government, she would also be averse to the
<I>kapu</I> system because it threatened the continuance of her
administration by implying that the right to rule could only be
confirmed through religious ritual. [<A HREF="historyn.htm#559">59</A>]
Ka'ahumanu would have been astute enough to realize that secularizing
the government and making succession hereditary would not only stabilize
but increase the power and authority of the central government. [<A
HREF="historyn.htm#560">60</A>] In summary, Levin believes that certain
members of the ruling <I>ali'i,</I> after the death of Kamehameha,
probably feeling their position to be somewhat insecure, realized that
the current political system, constrained by ancient religious tenets,
was highly unstable. That explains why the movement arose and did not
constitute an attempt to destroy a set of religious beliefs the people
had already rejected, but was a specific attempt to consolidate and
strengthen the political authority of the central government. [<A
HREF="historyn.htm#561">61</A>] </P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The reason for the <I>kapu</I> system's overthrow at
this particular time was probably a result of all the conditions
discussed, in varying degrees. Undoubtedly Western contact and growing
desires on the part of the people for European amenities; the
insecurities of the government &#151; the first monarchy to take office
through hereditary succession; the far-reaching political and social
implications of maintaining the <I>kapu</I> system; the disruption of
the balance of power among local chiefs due to trading advantages; and
the disturbance of personal relationships in and among the general
population from exposure to Western goods and customs, all must have
played a role. And because of this unrest, strong personalities in the
forefront of the government at this time were able to assume a critical
role in nudging the course of history.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>6. Effects of the Overthrow of the
<I>Kapu</I> System</B></P>

<P ALIGN="justify">What were the affects of the overthrow of the
<I>kapu</I> system? According to Marion Kelly,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="justify">The royal declaration outlawing the taboo system did
not affect all Hawaiians in a like manner. For the most part it relieved
the <I>ali'i,</I> and particularly the women, of certain oppressive
conditions. Although the revolt against the declaration was not well
supported, the people did not immediately abandon their religious
practices nor their beliefs. Ancient religious rituals were set aside by
the <I>ali'i</I> only, and the new religion that Christian missionaries
brought was not welcomed by Hawaiians with opened arms. [<A
HREF="historyn.htm#562">62</A>] </P>

<P ALIGN="justify">In his introduction to Laura Judd's memoirs, Dale
Morgan, in reflecting upon the consequences of the <I>kapu</I> abolition
movement, opines that</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="justify">Destruction of the kapu system made little difference
in the power of the chiefs, and though the revolution greatly impaired
the power of the priests, it did not destroy their power wholly. A more
far-reaching effect was that the discontinuance of formal religious
services left a certain vacuum in the nation's life, subtly damaging the
social fabric, the sense of order that had shaped much of Hawaiian
existence. . . [<A HREF="historyn.htm#563">63</A>]</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="justify">Scholars have enumerated many detrimental effects of
the abolition of the <I>kapu</I> system on the Hawaiian population
precipitated by the loss of order and regulation in society and of the
ceremonial motivation and efficiency of organized labor. Psychological
hardships became extremely significant for a people deprived of the
support and leadership heretofore offered by customary ways of doing
things.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Because <I>kapu</I> had directed <I>every</I> aspect
of Hawaiian culture, their removal also affected every segment of daily
life. Removing the underpinnings of traditional Hawaiian social and
political culture led to a chaotic psychological trauma for the majority
of Hawaiians who, subjected at the same time to such detrimental
influences as rum, tobacco, and venereal disease, were assailed by
feelings of doubt, fear, confusion, stress, and depression about the
future.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Changes in land tenure and ownership rights, in the
division of labor, in the types of services performed and the kinds of
goods produced, in personal relationships, and in social stratification
were many. For instance, the allotment of land changed with the further
consolidation of the government. Although the former <I>kahuna</I> of
the organized priesthoods were stripped of their powers, they kept their
lands, becoming landed gentry like the rest of the <I>ali'i.</I> The
withdrawal of the caste system tended to weaken kinship ties between the
<I>maka'ainana</I> and the <I>ali'i</I> and removed distinctions between
the <I>kauwa</I> and the <I>maka'ainana,</I> opening the way for
integration of the classes. Ultimately the disintegration of old values
and the traditional kinship systems led to the loss of the feeling of
unity in families, which had been one of the keystones of ancient
Hawaiian society.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">As traditional values fell in esteem, so did the
production of native implements, arts, and crafts and the accomplishment
of other native industries as the focus of acquisition settled on more
and more foreign items. As political rivalry and wars of succession
ceased, commoners no longer regarded the king and other <I>ali'i</I> as
leaders and an inspiration in war. The overthrow also affected the
culture's subsistence and consumption patterns, specifically food and
craft production, which were no longer tied to the
social-political-religious system. Because the people no longer observed
seasonal cycles marked by formal religious ceremonies, planting was less
planned and more informal; the lack of <I>kapu</I> on fishing activities
probably resulted in increased overfishing. Although agricultural
festivals were no longer held, farmers and fishermen still had to pay
taxes, not to bring bounty through the goodwill of the gods as in
earlier times, but as impersonal payment to the central government. [<A
HREF="historyn.htm#564">64</A>] </P>

<P ALIGN="justify">The void left by abandonment of the age-old
socio-religious system would be filled only partially by the teachings
of Christianity. Members of the upper class of Hawaiian society would
support the work of the New England missionaries upon their arrival and
would, in turn, instruct the people to learn and obey the new teachings.
Possibly because they were used to obeying edicts from above, or
possibly because they were looking for a new direction in their
spiritual and daily lives, many of the population took to the teachings
of Christianity with little resistance. Even the missionaries, however,
would have rough going in countering some of the more unwelcome
attractions of the foreign trading ships and of a new visitor to
Hawai'i's shores &#151; the whalers.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>7. Death of Kamehameha II</B></P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Despite this dramatic break with past traditions,
some of Liholiho's actions were similar to those of rulers before him.
He gathered around him young chiefs, children of warriors, and even
commoners, making them members of his household. [<A
HREF="historyn.htm#565">65</A>] He collected taxes in the form of food
and subsistence goods from the different islands of his kingdom. [<A
HREF="historyn.htm#566">66</A>] Like his father, Liholiho moved his
residence several times in response to the need for his presence in an
area. At one point he lived at Kawaihae and later, upon the advice of
his cabinet, moved his principal residence from Kailua to Honolulu. [<A
HREF="historyn.htm#567">67</A>] </P>

<P ALIGN="justify">However, the short reign of King Kamehameha II was
clouded by excesses in drinking and spending on luxury goods. One author
writes that Liholiho</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">did not have to rule by ritual and he did not know
how to rule by law, and so he ruled by whim, alternately despotic and

in 1824. In their absence, Ka'ahumanu acted as regent, imposing strict
new moral rules on the islands. At about the same time, a revolt was
instigated on Kaua'i by the son of the old chief Ka'umu'ali'i. Although
the government put an end to the revolt, these events combined to
further the missionary cause, while diminishing the power of the
king.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">King Kamehameha II and Queen Kamamalu died of measles
in London in July 1824. A national council appointed his younger brother
Kauikeaouli as king, and Ka'ahumanu continued as regent. The council
also decreed that hereditary succession was now the law of the land.</P>
