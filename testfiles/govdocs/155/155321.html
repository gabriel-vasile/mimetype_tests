<P>ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI <BR>
TO THE SUPREME COURT OF HAWAII<BR>


<P>BRIEF FOR THE UNITED STATES<BR>
AS AMICUS CURIAE SUPPORTING PETITIONERS<BR>



<P>INTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES</P>

<P>	This case concerns whether federal law required or permitted the Supreme
Court of Hawaii to enjoin the State of Hawaii from selling lands that the
United States obtained in absolute fee upon the annexation of Hawaii in
1898 and granted to the State, to hold in trust, upon its admission to the
Union.  The issues in this case implicate significant federal interests.
 The State's title to the trust lands derives from the 1898 Act of Congress
annexing Hawaii; the State holds the lands pursuant to a federal trust;
and the United States is empowered to enforce the trust's requirements.
 Hawaiian Statehood Admissions Act (Admissions Act), Pub. L. No. 86-3, &sect;
5(f), 73 Stat. 6 (48 U.S.C. ch. 3 note).  In addition, the United States
owns approximately 300,000 acres of land in Hawaii, acquired in the 1898
annexation; maintains sensitive military and scientific installations on trust lands leased
from the State; and engages in other land transactions with the State.</P>

<P>STATEMENT</P>

<P>	1.	a.	The United States acquired the land at issue in this case when
it annexed the Hawaiian Islands in 1898.  Hawaiian Annexation Resolution
(Newlands Resolution), J. Res. 55, 30 Stat. 750.  The islands had been an
inde pendent kingdom until 1893, when the monarchy was overthrown and a
provisional government established.  Subsequently, in 1894, a Republic of
Hawaii was pro claimed, and the United States extended that govern ment
official recognition.  13 James D. Richardson, Mes sages and Papers of the
Presidents 5958-5959 (1897).  The leadership of the Republic subsequently
requested that the United States annex Hawaii and accept the ces sion of
all its government-owned lands.  In 1898, the United States agreed to the
offer, annexed Hawaii as a territory, and accepted the cession of &quot;absolute
fee and ownership of all public, Government, or Crown lands.&quot;  Newlands
Resolution Preamble, &sect; 1, 30 Stat. 750.1  Al though the rights to those
lands, &quot;all and singular,&quot; were &quot;vested in the United States
of America,&quot; Congress re served income from the lands &quot;for the
benefit of the in habitants of the Hawaiian Islands for educational and
other public purposes.&quot;  &sect; 1, 30 Stat. 750.  See generally United
States v. Fullard-Leo, 331 U.S. 256, 265 (1947).</P>

<P>	During Hawaii's 61 years as a territory, the ceded lands remained federal
property, although Congress allowed most to be administered by the territorial
gov ernment.  See Hawaiian Organic Act (Organic Act), ch. 339, &sect; 91,
31 Stat. 159.  In 1921, Congress set aside a portion of the ceded lands
for the benefit of native Ha waiians, through a program of leases and loans.
 Hawai ian Homes Commission Act, 1920, ch. 42, 42 Stat. 108.  That statute
defined &quot;native Hawaiian&quot; to mean &quot;any descendant of not
less than one-half part of the blood of the races inhabiting the Hawaiian
Islands previous to 1778.&quot;  &sect; 201(a)(7), 42 Stat. 108.</P>

<P>	Hawaii was admitted to the Union as the fiftieth State in 1959.  Congress
conveyed to the new State &quot;the United States' title to&quot; the ceded
lands, except for cer tain parcels reserved in federal ownership.  Admissions
Act &sect; 5(b)-(g), 73 Stat. 5-6.  In Section 5(f) of the Admis sions Act,
Congress directed that the State hold the ceded lands granted to it, &quot;together
with the proceeds from the sale or other disposition&quot; of such lands,
as a &quot;public trust&quot; for one or more of five enumerated pur poses,
including &quot;the development of farm and home ownership on as widespread
a basis as possible,&quot; and &quot;the betterment of the conditions of
native Hawaiians&quot; as defined in the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act.
 73 Stat. 6; see p. 2, supra.  See generally Rice v. Cayetano, 528 U.S.
495, 507-508 (2000).</P>

<P>	b.	In 1993, Congress adopted and the President signed a joint resolution
formally apologizing for the United States' role in the overthrow of the
Hawaiian monarchy a century before.  Act of Nov. 23, 1993 (Apol ogy Resolution),
Pub. L. No. 103-150, 107 Stat. 1510.  Congress &quot;acknowledge[d] the
historical significance&quot; of the &quot;illegal overthrow of the Kingdom
of Hawaii,&quot; and &quot;apologize[d] to Native Hawaiians on behalf of
the peo ple of the United States&quot; for that act.  &sect; 1(1) and (3),
107 Stat. 1513.  The preamble (the &quot;whereas&quot; clauses) re cited
in great detail the history of the overthrow of the monarchy and the subsequent
annexation, and con cluded that it was &quot;proper and timely for the Congress
on the occasion of the impending one hundredth anniver sary of the event,
to acknowledge the historic signifi cance of the illegal overthrow of the
Kingdom of Hawaii, to express its deep regret to the Native Hawaiian peo
ple, and to support the reconciliation efforts of the State  *  *  *  and
the United Church of Christ with Native Ha waiians.&quot;  107 Stat. 1513.</P>

<P>	2.	This suit involves a tract of land on Maui, the &quot;Leiali'i parcel,&quot;
that was formerly crown land, see note 1, supra, was ceded to the United
States at annexation, and has been held since 1959 by the State as part
of the trust established by Section 5(f).  Pet. App. 20a &amp; n.11.</P>

<P>	The Housing Finance and Development Corporation (HFDC), a state agency,
has identified the area around the Leilali'i parcel as one with a &quot;critical
shortage of housing,&quot; and it accordingly wishes to build housing on
that parcel.  Pet. App. 18a-20a.  Because the parcel is part of the Section
5(f) trust, it was managed by the De partment of Land and Natural Resources
(DLNR).  Id. at 6a.  HFDC obtained approval to transfer the land from DLNR's
ownership to its own, and invested mil lions of dollars preparing to build.
 Id. at 20a-22a.</P>

<P>	Any transfer of the Leilali'i parcel out of the trust would involve
paying some compensation to respondent Office of Hawaiian Affairs (OHA),
an independent state agency.  OHA manages the portion of the Section 5(f)
trust's proceeds (currently 20%) that state statutes des ignate for the
benefit of &quot;native Hawaiians.&quot;  Pet. App. 159a-166a; see Haw.
Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 10-3(1), 10-13.5 (LexisNexis 2006); Rice, 528
U.S. at 508-509.  Accord ingly, the state legislature enacted a procedure
to com pensate OHA for 20% of the Leiali'i parcel's fair market value when
transferred.  Pet. App. 20a-21a.</P>

<P>	While the fair market value was being ascertained, Congress enacted
the Apology Resolution.  Ten months later, relying on the resolution, OHA
demanded that, in addition to paying OHA its 20% share, the state agencies
include a disclaimer preserving any native Hawaiian claims to ownership
of the ceded lands (of which the Leiali'i parcel is a part).  Pet. App.
21a; see id. at 206a- 207a.  HFDC declined to include the requested dis
claimer because &quot;to do so would place a cloud on title, rendering title
insurance unavailable.&quot;  Id . at 207a.</P>

<P>	On November 4, 1994, DLNR transferred the Leiali'i parcel to HFDC for
$1, and HFDC tendered to OHA a check for approximately $5.6 million as OHA's
20% share of the fair market value.  Pet. App. 21a.  OHA's attorney advised,
however, that the Apology Resolution had created a &quot;cloud&quot; on
the State's title, and OHA re fused to accept the check.  Id. at 21a-22a.</P>

<P>	3.	OHA and the individual respondents, four individ uals of varying
degrees of Hawaiian ancestry who seek to sue on behalf of the &quot;Native
Hawaiian People,&quot; filed suits (later consolidated) in state trial court
in Novem ber 1994.  Pet. App. 139a-142a, 209a.  Respondents named as defendants
the State, its Governor, HFDC (since renamed), and its officials, all petitioners
here.  Id. at 142a-143a.</P>

<P>	a.	As described by the Supreme Court of Hawaii, &quot;[a]t the heart
of the plaintiffs' claims, before the trial court and on appeal, is the
Apology Resolution.&quot;  Pet. App. 26a.  Specifically, &quot;[t]he plaintiffs
essentially be lieve that the title to the ceded lands is clouded as a re
sult of the Apology Resolution's recognition that the native Hawaiian people
never relinquished their claims over their ancestral territory and that,
therefore, the defendants have a 'fiduciary obligation to protect the corpus
of the [p]ublic [l]ands [t]rust until an appropriate settlement is reached
between native Hawaiians and the State.'&quot;  Ibid.  The court explained
that, although the claim was technically pleaded as one for breach of trust
under state law, &quot;the plaintiffs essentially maintain that the Apology
Resolution gave rise to their breach of trust claim.&quot;  Id. at 58a;
see id. at 22a-23a, 212a-213a.</P>

<P>	Respondents sought an injunction prohibiting peti tioners &quot;from
selling or otherwise transferring the Leiali'i parcel to third parties and
selling or otherwise transferring to third parties any of the ceded lands
in general until a determination of the native Hawaiians' claims to the
ceded lands is made.&quot;  Pet. App. 26a.  Re spondents alleged that an
injunction was proper be cause, &quot;in light of the Apology Resolution,
any transfer of ceded lands by the State to third-parties would amount to
a breach of trust inasmuch as such transfers would be 'without regard for
the claims of Hawaiians to those lands' to whom the State, as trustee, owes
a fidu ciary duty.&quot;  Id. at 23a.</P>

<P>	b.	The state trial court entered judgment against respondents.  Pet.
App. 133a-279a.  The court concluded in relevant part that the Apology Resolution
&quot;do[es] not prohibit the sale of ceded lands.&quot;  Id. at 258a. 
The court explained that in the Apology Resolution, Congress &quot;ha[s]
recognized past injustices to native Hawaiians, and ha[s] expressed [its]
support for native Hawaiian sovereignty and reconciliation.&quot;  Ibid.
 But the court re jected the contention that the Apology Resolution &quot;cre
ate[d] a cloud on title,&quot; and concluded that &quot;[i]n adopting the
Apology Resolution  *  *  *  Congress did not create a 'claim' to any ceded
lands.&quot;  Ibid.</P>

<P>	4.	The Supreme Court of Hawaii vacated the trial court's judgment. 
The court concluded that respondents were entitled to a permanent injunction
prohibiting peti tioners &quot;from selling or otherwise transferring to
third parties (1) the Leiali'i parcel and (2) any other ceded lands from
the public lands trust until the claims of the native Hawaiians to the ceded
lands have been re solved.&quot;  Pet. App. 100a.</P>

<P>	That injunction was based on a holding that &quot;the Apology Resolution
and related state legislation  *  *  *  give rise to the State's fiduciary
duty to preserve the corpus of the public lands trust, specifically, the
ceded lands, until such time as the unrelinquished claims of the native
Hawaiians have been resolved.&quot;  Pet. App. 41a.  The court explained
its rationale as follows:</P>

<P>[T]he language of the Apology Resolution itself sup ports the issuance
of an injunction.  *  *  *  [W]e be lieve, based on a plain reading of the
Apology Reso lution, that Congress has clearly recognized that the native
Hawaiian people have unrelinquished claims over the ceded lands, which were
taken without con sent or compensation and which the native Hawaiian people
are determined to preserve, develop, and transmit to future generations.
 Equally clear is Con gress's &quot;expresse[d]  .  .  .  commitment to
acknowl edge the ramifications of the overthrow of the King dom of Hawaii,
in order to provide a proper founda tion for reconciliation between the
United States and the [n]ative Hawaiian people.&quot;  Accordingly, the
Apology Resolution dictates that the ceded lands should be preserved pending
a reconciliation be tween the United States and the native Hawaiian people.</P>

<P>Id. at 85a (first and final emphases added; citation omit ted).  Based
on that reasoning, the court concluded that injunctive relief &quot;is proper
pending final resolution of native Hawaiian claims through the political
process.&quot;  Id. at 98a; see id. at 98a-100a.</P>

<P>SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT</P>

<P>	The Supreme Court of Hawaii misread the Apology Resolution to reverse
a century's worth of federal law and policy governing the United States'
1898 annexation of Hawaii and its acquisition and treatment of ceded lands.
 The Apology Resolution did not change that body of law, or any existing
law.  Nor did it take the dramatic and disruptive step of stripping the
State's authority to sell, exchange, or transfer lands held in the federal
trust, which would have been a significant intrusion on the State's authority
in this important sphere.  Instead, Congress opted simply to express regret
for the events of a century before.</P>

<P>	I.  At the time of the Apology Resolution, as it had for decades, federal
law foreclosed two key premises of respondents' case:  that the United States
acquired the trust lands subject to a cloud on title, and that as trustee
of the federal trust the State has a fiduciary duty not to sell those lands
until that cloud is removed.</P>

<P>	Respondents' purported cloud arises from the man ner in which the Republic
of Hawaii acquired the crown and government lands.  But when the United
States ac cepted those lands, it took absolute title, irrespective of their
history, as the Newlands Resolution plainly stated.  The Organic Act (as
well as contemporaneous legislative and executive interpretations) confirmed
that the Uni ted States' perfect title extended to the entire cession. 
Respondents' theory depends on the notion that if the Republic of Hawaii
acquired the land illegitimately, it could not give the United States perfect
title.  But at least since the Louisiana Purchase, this Court has held that
when the United States acquires territory, determi nation of the ceding
sovereign's ability to pass valid title is a matter for the political Branches,
bound up with the powers to recognize governments and make treaties.  Neither
this Court nor any other court may second- guess those determinations, in
a title suit or otherwise.  See, e.g., Foster v. Neilson, 27 U.S. (2 Pet.)
253, 309 (1829) (Marshall, C.J.).  The United States then trans ferred its
unencumbered title to the State, subject only to the federal trust.</P>

<P>	Accordingly, under federal law, the state courts may not lock up trust
lands based on the perceived need for a political settlement of long-foreclosed
land claims as serted by putative successors to the interests of the Kingdom
of Hawaii.  Nor may they do so based on a per ceived state-law &quot;fiduciary&quot;
duty to native Hawaiians in that capacity.  The State's fiduciary duties
as trustee derive from and are bounded by Section 5(f) of the Ad missions
Act, which established a federal trust and con veyed the United States'
absolute title to the corpus.  The State's trust responsibilities are not
fettered by the sort of external constraints that respondents and the state
supreme court have sought to impose.  To the con trary, the Admissions Act
gives the State authority to sell trust lands, as do the state constitution
and statutes.  The state court was not free to limit that authority and
the State's important interests, especially when doing so would be inconsistent
with the federal trust and with the State's underlying federal-law title
to the trust corpus.</P>

<P>	II.  The Apology Resolution did not alter these well- settled principles
or intrude on state authority in the manner found by the state supreme court.
 In the resolu tion's three short provisions, Congress simply expressed
the Nation's regret for past events and support for ef forts to seek &quot;reconciliation&quot;
in the future.  As with other recent apologies for historical events, Congress
made no substantive change in the law, as the legislative history confirms.
 Congress did not commit the United States or the State of Hawaii to negotiate
a political set tlement over lands to which the United States had long since
acquired absolute title.  Because the Apology Res olution was just that
and nothing more, the state su preme court was wrong in reading the Apology
Resolu tion to contradict a century's worth of law that confirms the United
States' valid annexation, and to frustrate the State's power to sell trust
lands.</P>

<P>	III.  The state court's injunction cannot stand.  Be cause the Apology
Resolution is no basis for disregard ing the effect of the Newlands Resolution,
Organic Act, and Admissions Act; because those provisions of law preclude
any injunction based on claims to the trust lands, or on a purported fiduciary
duty to respect such claims; because there is no indication that Congress
in tended to intrude on this important sphere of state au thority; and because
no state-law ground can detract from the force of federally conferred authority
over the lands, the injunction should be reversed.</P>

<P>ARGUMENT</P>

<P>CONGRESS'S APOLOGY LEFT UNTOUCHED THE GOVERN ING FEDERAL LAW, WHICH PRECLUDES
ANY INJUNC TION AGAINST SALE OF TRUST LANDS BASED ON PUTA TIVE UNRELINQUISHED
CLAIMS TO THOSE LANDS</P>

<P>	The Supreme Court of Hawaii held that the Apology Resolution justified
depriving the State of authority to alienate the trust lands.  But that
resolution is entirely hortatory.  By contrast, the federal statutes by
which the United States took title to the relevant lands and later transferred
that title to Hawaii in trust are not hortatory, and they make clear that
native Hawaiians have no lingering claims to the relevant lands and that
the State may alienate those lands pursuant to its fed eral-law trust responsibilities.
 Nothing in the Apology Resolution manifests any purpose to alter those
long standing principles, and without a clear manifestation, this Court
should not attribute to Congress the intent to constrict the authority conferred
on the State in this important area.</P>

<P>I.	THE UNITED STATES ACQUIRED ABSOLUTE TITLE AT ANNEXATION AND AUTHORIZED
HAWAII TO SELL OR TRANSFER LANDS AS TRUSTEE, CONSISTENT WITH THE TRUST REQUIREMENTS</P>

<P>	At the time of the Apology Resolution, any residual land claims by native
Hawaiians in their asserted capac ity as successors to the interest of the
Kingdom of Ha waii were unequivocally barred by federal law, and had been
since the United States acquired the lands at the time of annexation.  And
the State had the power, under both the Admissions Act and state law, to
sell trust lands in furtherance of the federal trust's five statutory purposes.</P>

<P>	The state supreme court interpreted the Apology Resolution as undoing
that settled legal framework.  But as explained below, the absolute title
to, and power to sell, the ceded lands was so firmly rooted in federal law
that if Congress had intended to upset the status quo in the Apology Resolution,
especially in the dramatic and highly disruptive fashion envisioned by the
state su preme court, it surely would have said so.</P>

<P> A.	In Annexing Hawaii, The United States Acquired Abso lute Title
To The Ceded Lands</P>

<P> 1.	The Newlands Resolution and Organic Act preclude challenges to
the United States' title</P>

<P>	a.	The text of the Newlands Resolution annexing Hawaii makes clear that
Congress intended to and did acquire absolute, unimpeachable title to the
ceded lands.  The resolution begins with a preamble acknowledging that the
Republic of Hawaii had offered the cession of &quot;the absolute fee and
ownership of all public, Govern ment, or Crown lands,  *  *  *  and all
other public prop erty of every kind and description belonging to the Gov
ernment of the Hawaiian Islands.&quot;  30 Stat. 750.  Con gress then expressly
stated &quot;[t]hat said cession [of the absolute fee and ownership] is
accepted, ratified, and confirmed.&quot;  &sect; 1, 30 Stat. 750.  And,
removing any doubt, Congress added that &quot;all and singular the property
and rights hereinbefore mentioned are vested in the United States of America.&quot;
 Ibid. (emphasis added).</P>

<P>	The Newlands Resolution provided that the federal public-land laws (which
permitted homesteading) would not apply to the newly acquired lands, and
that &quot;the Congress of the United States shall enact special laws for
[the newly acquired lands'] management and disposi tion.&quot;  &sect; 1,
30 Stat. 750.  Congress specified that all reve nue from the newly acquired
public lands &quot;shall be used solely for the benefit of the inhabitants
of the Hawaiian Islands for educational and other public purposes.&quot;
 Ibid.</P>

<P>	b.	Two years later in the Organic Act, which estab lished a new territorial
government, Congress firmly rejected the possibility of permitting challenges
to the United States' ownership of the former crown lands.  Section 99 of
the Organic Act explicitly declares that the Republic of Hawaii had absolute
title to the crown lands as of the date the annexation took effect:</P>

<P>[T]he portion of the public domain heretofore known as Crown land is
hereby declared to have been, on [August 12, 1898], and prior thereto, the
property of the Hawaiian government, and to be free and clear from any trust
of or concerning the same, and from all claim of any nature whatsoever,
upon the rents, issues, and profits thereof.  It shall be subject to alienation
and other uses as may be provided by law.</P>

<P>31 Stat. 161; see Liliuokalani v. United States, 45 Ct. Cl. 418, 428-429
(1910).  Thus, the Organic Act reaffirms that the former crown lands are
part of the Republic of Hawaii's cession of &quot;the absolute fee and ownership
of all public, Government, or Crown lands,&quot; which the an nexation &quot;accepted,
ratified, and confirmed.&quot;  Newlands Resolution Preamble, &sect; 1,
30 Stat. 750 (emphasis added).</P>

<P>	c.	If the text of these two provisions left any doubt as to Congress's
intention to acquire absolute and unim peachable title, the contemporaneous
interpretations of legislative supporters and of the Executive Branch would
remove it.</P>

<P>	On several occasions during floor debate on the Or ganic Act, Senators
proposed striking the provision that would become Section 99 (then Section
101).  Senators Cullom, Morgan, and Foraker2 explained at length that the
bill's authors had been aware of the controversy sur rounding the overthrow
of the monarchy.  See, e.g., 33 Cong. Rec. 2248 (1900) (statement of Sen.
Morgan) (not ing that &quot;[t]here are certain lawsuits threatened  * 
*  *  in favor of the heirs presumptive and otherwise of the crown of Hawaii,
set up in antagonism or in opposition to the title of the United States&quot;);
id. at 2249 (statement of Sen. Foraker) (alluding to the &quot;controversy
as to whether or not the republic of Hawaii had become pos sessed of the
fee-simple title to the Crown lands&quot;).  Those members confirmed emphatically
that Section 99's purpose was to declare that, upon annexation, the former
crown lands &quot;became the property of the United States,&quot; without
any remaining &quot;incumbrance&quot; that the former monarchy might assert.
 Id. at 2248, 2448 (Sen. Morgan).  Accord id. at 2249 (Sen. Foraker) (&quot;[T]he
only purpose of this is to show that, according to our declara tion, the
republic of Hawaii had become possessed of the fee-simple title to the Crown
lands, and that in conse quence they passed to the United States and are
now the lands of the United States.&quot;); id. at 2444 (Sen. Cullom) (confirming
that Section 99 would settle the question of the monarchy's title rather
than leave it for judicial de termination).  Accordingly, not only did the
Senate re ject attempts to delete Section 99, see id. at 2249, 2449, it
also tabled an amendment to acknowledge the former Queen's title and to
compensate her for a taking, see id. at 2442-2448.</P>

<P>	The strategic significance attached to Pearl Harbor is particularly
inconsistent with the notion that the Con gress thought it was acquiring
imperfect title.  The pos sibility that the United States military might
one day lose access to Pearl Harbor (which the monarchy had granted on an
exclusive but revocable basis, see Supple mentary Convention, Dec. 6, 1884,
U.S.-Haw., art. II, 25 Stat. 1400) was a primary motivation for annexing
Ha waii.  See H.R. Rep. No. 1355, 55th Cong., 2d Sess. 4 (1898) (endorsing
annexation as a means to obtain &quot;full power of ownership&quot;); see
also id. at 101, 103, 105.</P>

<P>	The President and the Attorney General, immedi ately following enactment
of the Newlands Resolution, interpreted it to give the United States &quot;'absolute
fee and ownership'&quot; of the ceded lands.  22 Op. Att'y Gen. 574, 575
(1899).  Indeed, the President ordered that any land transfers made by the
Republic of Hawaii after the effective date of the annexation be voided.
 See 22 Op. Att'y Gen. 628 (1899).  The Attorney General recognized that
voiding those transfers might leave some of the par ties unsatisfied, but
he concluded that their claims did not impair the United States' absolute
title; instead, the claimants should seek relief from Congress, which could
be expected to &quot;do justice to all persons having just claims of this
nature.&quot;  Id. at 636.</P>

<P> 2.	Congress acted within its authority when it pre cluded challenges
to the United States' title</P>

<P>	Congress's preclusion of challenges to the United States' title is final.
 The decisions to recognize the Re public of Hawaii, to accept that government's
cession of public lands, and to make Hawaii a part of the United States
are quintessentially the sorts of matters confided to the political Branches.
 See U.S. Const. Art. II, &sect; 3; Banco Nacional de Cuba v. Sabbatino,
376 U.S. 398, 410 (1964) (&quot;Political recognition is exclusively a function
of the Executive.&quot;); Williams v. Suffolk Ins. Co., 38 U.S. (13 Pet.)
415, 420 (1839) (agreeing that such determina tions by the Executive Branch
are &quot;conclusive on the judicial department&quot;); see also Baker v.
Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 212 (1962).</P>

<P>	Thus, even if (as respondents have contended, see Pet. App. 185a-193a,
236a) the transfer of the crown lands from the government of the Kingdom
to the provi sional government to the Republic of Hawaii was con trary to
some principle of international law or the King dom's domestic law, the
United States government's decisions to recognize the Republic and to accept
its ces sion of absolute fee title in public lands are conclusive and may
be revisited only by the political Branches of the United States Government,
through legislation (to the extent allowed by the Constitution).  Although
after some acquisitions Congress has permitted the courts to entertain disputes
over title to the new lands, it has done so out of grace or treaty commitment;
it may validly de cide instead to foreclose future litigation over title
to the land it acquires.</P>

<P>	This Court has upheld the United States' authority to acquire territory
outright.  One such case involved West Florida (coastal parts of present-day
Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama).  In the United States' view, Spain
had retroceded that territory to France in a secret 1800 treaty, and France
had accordingly conveyed it to the United States as part of the 1803 Louisiana
Pur chase.  Spain, however, remained in possession until 1810; the United
States then occupied and later annexed the area.  The United States and
Spain settled their dif ferences in an 1819 treaty.  See, e.g., David P.
Currie, The Constitution in Congress:  The Jeffersonians 1801- 1829, at
192-193 &amp; n.17, 195 (2001).</P>

<P>	Land claimants who had been granted title by Spain between 1803 and
1810 subsequently brought suit to vindicate their rights to possession.
 This Court rejected their claims because Congress and the President had
unmistakably rejected the claimants' premise-that un der the correct interpretation
of the 1800 treaty, Spain, not France, was the true owner of West Florida
at the time of the Louisiana Purchase, and France therefore could not convey
it.  Foster v. Neilson, 27 U.S. (2 Pet.) 253, 302-303 (1829).  As Chief
Justice Marshall wrote for the Court, once the political Branches had exercised
&quot;sovereign power over the territory in dispute,&quot; based on their
construction of the treaty between Spain and France, the courts must &quot;respect
the pronounced will of&quot; the other Branches rather than adopt a competing
con struction of the treaty.  Id. at 309.  Thus, the Court held, the claimants
would not be heard to argue &quot;that the oc cupation of the country by
the United States was wrong ful[,] and  *  *  *  founded on a misconstruction
of the treaty.&quot;  Ibid.</P>

<P>	Similarly, in Doe v. Braden, 57 U.S. (16 How.) 635 (1854), this Court
upheld and applied a provision of the 1819 treaty of cession (and an attached
declaration) ex pressly invalidating several grants that the King of Spain
had made, while the treaty negotiations were un derway, of lands later ceded
by the treaty.  The United States had insisted upon extinguishing the grantees'
claims in the treaty and declaration because &quot;a claim of th[eir] character,
however unfounded, would cast a cloud upon the proprietary title of the
United States.&quot;  Id. at 655.  Although the Spanish grantees' successors
con tended that the King lacked power to agree to extin guish their rights
in that manner, this Court explained that it would not second-guess the
political Branches' exercise of the powers to recognize nations and make
treaties, and thus would not examine the competence of the Nation's treaty
partner to make the agreement.  Id. at 657-658.</P>

<P>	More generally, this Court has held that this Na tion's courts will
not re-examine the acts of another duly recognized sovereign.  See, e.g.,
Oetjen v. Central Lea ther Co., 246 U.S. 297, 303-304 (1918).  That is so
even when the recognized government is one that &quot;originates in revolution
or revolt,&quot; because the recognition &quot;vali dates  *  *  *  the
government so recognized from the commencement of its existence.&quot; 
Id. at 302-303.  And the rule applies equally to state courts, as Oetjen
dem onstrates.  That case was brought in state court to chal lenge, under
international law, a seizure of personal property by the Mexican revolutionary
government.  See id. at 299-301.  This Court rejected the claim and cau
tioned that because the United States subsequently rec ognized the revolutionary
government, the validity of that government's actions was &quot;not open
to re&euml;xamina tion by this or any other American court.&quot;  Id. at
304 (emphasis added); see id. at 303.</P>

<P>	In both Foster and Doe, the Court recognized the political Branches'
authority conclusively to resolve title disputes that had arisen before
the United States took possession and to declare that the United States
held the new territory in fee simple absolute.  The same prin ciples apply
here:  in recognizing the Republic of Hawaii, in asserting and acquiring
absolute title to lands ceded by that government, and in expressly extinguishing
any competing claim to the crown lands, Congress and the President exercised
their constitutional authority to transact with foreign nations and to manage
the terri tory so acquired.  The nature of respondents' land claims, which
are not individual claims to fee title but collective claims traceable to
the Kingdom of Hawaii, confirms that any such claims could be extinguished
by federal law.  Cf. Tee-Hit-Ton Indians v. United States, 348 U.S. 272,
279-282, 285 (1955) (discussing extinguish ment of Indian title).</P>

<P>	Any contention respondents might make about the legitimacy of the Republic
of Hawaii at the time of the cession simply is not judicially cognizable;
the United States' original title to the ceded lands is not subject to question
on that or any other basis.  &quot;It is not for the Courts of this country
to question the validity of this title, or to sustain one which is incompatible
with it.&quot;  Johnson v. M'Intosh, 21 U.S. (8 Wheat.) 543, 589 (1823);
see also id. at 588; Wilson v. Shaw, 204 U.S. 24, 32 (1907).  Nor, a fortiori,
is it for a state court to interfere with the administration of a federal
trust on the premise that such an incompatible title to the corpus might
exist.</P>

<P> B.	The Admissions Act Granted Hawaii Title To Ceded Lands, With The
Express Requirement That Those Lands Be Managed Only In Furtherance Of Five
Statu tory Purposes</P>

<P>	Upon admitting Hawaii to the Union, Congress granted the new State,
in trust, the United States' title to some of the lands that had been ceded
to the United States in the Newlands Resolution.  See Admissions Act &sect;
5(b) and (g), 73 Stat. 5, 6.  Congress required that those lands be held
in trust and managed for one or more of the five purposes enumerated in
Section 5(f).  Although Section 5(f) allows the constitution and laws of
Hawaii to govern the management and disposal of those lands within the federal
framework, that provision does not authorize the state courts to restrain
the State's trusteeship in a fashion that is inconsistent with the fed eral
grant or that rests on asserted claims or perceived fiduciary duties external
to the federal trust.  The Su preme Court of Hawaii's issuance of an injunction
based on &quot;unrelinquished claims&quot; to the trust lands (Pet. App.
32a) represents just such an impermissible restraint on the State's stewardship
of the federal trust.</P>

<P>	Hawaii was expressly empowered to sell trust lands as part of its duty
to manage the federal trust in a man ner consistent with the federal grant.
 That authority, while limited by the federal trust and the Admissions Act,
is an important one.  In Section 5(f) of the Admis sions Act, Congress specified
the five purposes for the benefit of which the State must hold, &quot;manage[]
and dis pose[] of&quot; those granted lands, &quot;the income therefrom,&quot;
and &quot;the proceeds from the sale or other disposition&quot; of such
lands.  73 Stat. 6.  Not only does Section 5(f) ex pressly contemplate selling
trust lands (as trusts com monly do), it identifies as one of the trust
purposes &quot;the development of  *  *  *  home ownership on as wide spread
a basis as possible,&quot; ibid., which necessarily con templates selling
some land to permit new homeowners.  Cf. Hawaii Hous. Auth. v. Midkiff,
467 U.S. 229, 232- 233 (1984) (noting Hawaii's historically low rates of
resi dential fee-simple ownership).</P>

<P>	The state supreme court did not dispute that the planned use of the
Leilali'i parcel would be entirely con sistent with the trust purpose of
encouraging more wide spread home ownership.  Nor did that court contradict
the trial court's analysis that, under state law, petition ers possess authority
to sell or dispose of ceded lands.  See Pet. App. 243a-257a, 259a-262a.
 Indeed, the su preme court acknowledged-but then did not address- petitioners'
argument that they have &quot;the undoubted and explicit power to sell [c]eded
[l]ands pursuant to the terms of the Admission Act and pursuant to [s]tate
law.&quot;  Id. at 82a (brackets in original) (quoting Defs.-Appel lees'
Haw. Answering Br. 16).</P>

<P>	Any judicially imposed freeze on transfer of trust assets would necessarily
contradict Congress's authori zation to the State to sell or otherwise dispose
of lands to promote the trust purposes, including home owner ship, and intrude
on that important state authority.  A freeze on sales otherwise authorized
by state law, based on asserted land claims of native Hawaiians, contradicts
the federal scheme even more directly.  First, it effec tively promotes
one of the trust purposes-the welfare of native Hawaiians-over the other
four purposes that under both federal and state law are eligible to benefit
from the trust, see p. 3, supra.  Second, it does so based on asserted claims
by, and perceived &quot;fiduciary&quot; duties to, native Hawaiians that
are external to the federal trust.</P>

<P>	Furthermore, the &quot;unrelinquished claims&quot; to trust lands, on
which respondents base this litigation, are ap parently asserted on behalf
of not just native Hawaiians as the Admissions Act uses that term, see p.
3, supra, but anyone descended from a pre-1778 aboriginal Ha waiian.  See
Pet. App. 141a-142a.  Section 5(f) does not recognize such a broad-based
category of native Hawai ian beneficiaries.  Thus, in this important respect
as well, respondents' claims and the state supreme court's reasoning are
contrary to the Admissions Act.3</P>

<P>	While Section 5(f) does provide that Hawaii shall manage and dispose
of trust lands &quot;in such manner as the constitution and laws of said
State may provide,&quot; 73 Stat. 6, that provision does not sanction the
state court's actions.  Congress referred to state law as a way to fill
in the details of the State's federal-law trusteeship obli gation, not to
authorize a state court to rewrite that trusteeship obligation.  See ASARCO
Inc. v. Kadish, 490 U.S. 605, 631 (1989) (phrase &quot;as the State legislature
may direct&quot; in the New Mexico Enabling Act does not license the state
legislature to disregard the Enabling Act's &quot;express restrictions&quot;);
cf. General Atomic Co. v. Felter, 434 U.S. 12, 17 (1977) (per curiam) (congressio
nally conferred rights &quot;are not subject to abridgment by state-court
injunctions&quot;). </P>

<P>II.	THE APOLOGY RESOLUTION DID NOT CHANGE THE LAW OR CLOUD THE STATE'S
TITLE</P>

<P>	As explained above, under federal law as it existed before 1993, respondents
plainly could not have shown any entitlement to injunctive relief.  The
state supreme court, however, concluded that the adoption of the Apol ogy
Resolution in 1993 removed those federal obstacles.  But the Apology Resolution
does not change the pre- existing law at all, let alone effect the type
of dramatic change that would be necessary for respondents to mount a claim
to the trust lands and, while they pursue that claim extrajudicially, to
preclude the State from using trusteeship powers authorized by the Admissions
Act.  Nor is there any basis to assume that Congress would so disrupt state
authority in this important sphere without saying so clearly.</P>

<P> A.	The Apology Resolution's Text Demonstrates That Con gress's Apology
Was Hortatory, Not Substantive, And The State Court's Reliance On The Preamble
Was Erro neous</P>

<P>	1.	The sole substantive provision of the Apology Resolution uses six
verbs:  Congress &quot;acknowledges,&quot; &quot;recognizes and commends,&quot;
&quot;apologizes,&quot; &quot;expresses&quot; (a commitment), and &quot;urges.&quot;
 &sect; 1, 107 Stat. 1513.  The plain meaning of each of those words demonstrates
that Congress was speaking rather than acting-clearing the air rather than
changing the law.</P>

<P>	Of the six verbs, &quot;apologizes&quot; is the most significant.  In
ordinary usage an &quot;apology&quot; is simply &quot;a regretful acknowledgment
of an offense or failure.&quot;  E.g., The New Oxford American Dictionary
72 (2d ed. 2005) (first definition).  That is what Congress did, and all
that it did, in the Apology Resolution:  it &quot;apologize[d] to Na tive
Hawaiians on behalf of the people of the United States for the overthrow
of the Kingdom of Hawaii on January 17, 1893 with the participation of agents
and citizens of the United States.&quot;  Apology Resolution &sect; 1(3),
107 Stat. 1513.  As a simple expression of regret, an &quot;apology,&quot;
in ordinary usage, does not carry a sub stantive legal effect.</P>

<P>	The state court attributed significance to another provision, in which
Congress expressed its &quot;commitment to acknowledge the ramifications
of the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii, in order to provide a proper
founda tion for reconciliation between the United States and the [n]ative
Hawaiian people.&quot;  Pet. App. 32a (quoting Apol ogy Resolution &sect;
1(4), 107 Stat. 1513) (emphasis omitted; brackets in original).  But the
reference to &quot;reconcilia tion&quot;-&quot;action to restore to friendship,
compatibility, or harmony,&quot; Webster's Third New International Dictio
nary 1897 (1993)-does not in itself entail the recogni tion or settlement
of any claim to land.  And of particu lar relevance here, there is no indication
in Section 1(4)'s text, context, or history that Congress thought a &quot;proper
foundation for reconciliation&quot; would involve restricting the use or
sale of trust lands in anticipation of any &quot;rec onciliation.&quot;
 To the contrary, consistent with its status as an &quot;Apology Resolution,&quot;
the plain text makes clear that Congress's &quot;acknowledg[ment]&quot;
of the conse quences of past actions was itself the &quot;proper foundation
for reconciliation,&quot; not some additional legal restriction.</P>

<P>	If Congress had possessed the contrary view attrib uted to it by the
state supreme court, it would have needed to change the laws (the Newlands
Resolution, Section 99 of the Organic Act, and Section 5(f) of the Admissions
Act) by which the United States acquired the ceded lands in fee simple absolute
and then con veyed them to the State, subject only to the federal trust.
 But the Apology Resolution did not amend any existing law.  See also pp.
28-29, infra.  Nor did it state that the historical injustice it was examining
gave rise to colorable present-day land claims, let alone endorse or permit
a freeze on the trust lands or a change in the trust's administration as
a way to encourage settlement of any such claims.</P>

<P>	Congress would have made any such intent unmis takably plain, given
the unprecedented and dramatic consequence of clouding the title of at least
all the trust lands, if not all ceded lands.  Congress &quot;does not  *
 *  *  hide elephants in mouseholes,&quot; Whitman v. American Trucking
Ass'ns, 531 U.S. 457, 468 (2001), and the pachyderm that the state court
spotted is one that Con gress certainly would not have concealed.  Cf. FDA
v. Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. 120, 160 (2000) (Congress
would not have delegated &quot;a decision of such economic and political
significance  *  *  *  in so cryptic a fashion.&quot;).  Nor does Congress
lightly strip States of important attributes of their authority, includ
ing by clouding title to land that a State is empowered to sell, exchange,
or transfer.</P>

<P>	Congress made no such clear statement; to the con trary, it affirmatively
disavowed any such reading of the Apology Resolution in the final section,
which is entitled &quot;Disclaimer&quot; and states that &quot;[n]othing
in this Resolu tion is intended to serve as a settlement of any claims against
the United States.&quot;  &sect; 3, 107 Stat. 1514.  This disclaimer confirms
Congress's intent that the resolu tion not create a new basis for litigation.
 See also pp. 27-28, infra.</P>

<P>	2.	The Supreme Court of Hawaii asserted that its interpretation of the
Apology Resolution was &quot;[b]ased on a plain reading&quot; of four particular
passages from that enactment-but each of those passages is simply a &quot;whereas&quot;
clause from the preamble.  Pet. App. 31a-32a. As this Court recently explained
in a different context, &quot;whereas&quot; clauses cannot bear any such
weight:  &quot;[W]here the text of a clause itself indicates that it does
not have operative effect, such as 'whereas' clauses in federal legislation
 *  *  * , a court has no license to make it do what it was not designed
to do.&quot;  District of Columbia v. Heller, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 2789 n.3
(2008) (em phasis added).</P>

<P>	Nor would the &quot;whereas&quot; clauses support the state court's
holding in any event.  For example, one &quot;where as&quot; clause (like
Section 1(1)) refers to the &quot;illegal over throw&quot; of the monarchy.
 107 Stat. 1512.  But nothing in the Apology Resolution states or remotely
suggests that the subsequent Acts of Congress providing for the United States'
annexation of Hawaii and acquisition of absolute fee title to the public
lands-the very origins of the sovereignty of what is now the State of Hawaii
and its ownership of the trust lands under the Admissions Act-were somehow
unlawful.  And it is those enact ments that foreclose respondents' claim.</P>

<P>	 The state supreme court also relied in part on a clause that states:
 &quot;Whereas the indigenous Hawaiian people never directly relinquished
their claims to their inherent sovereignty as a people or over their national
lands to the United States, either through their monar chy or through a
plebiscite or referendum.&quot;  Pet. App. 31a (quoting 107 Stat. 1512).
 The Apology Resolution's &quot;whereas&quot; clause does not address whether
any such claims were extinguished rather than &quot;directly relin quished.&quot;
 See pp. 12-19, supra.4</P>

<P>	The state supreme court opined that the latter &quot;whereas&quot; clause
compelled it to construe the Apology Resolution's disclaimer provision differently,
to harmo nize the disclaimer with the &quot;whereas&quot; clause and thereby
&quot;give effect to all parts of [the] statute.&quot;  Pet. App. 33a (citation
omitted).  But the relevant canon calls for construing all substantive parts
of a statute so that none lacks force; because &quot;whereas&quot; clauses
always lack force, there is no basis for construing substantive clauses
purely to give effect to the preamble.  See 2A Norman J. Singer, Sutherland
on Statutory Construc tion &sect; 47.04, at 146 (rev. 5th ed. 1992); accord
Heller, 128 S. Ct. at 2789 n.3; id. at 2826 n.7 (Stevens, J., dissent ing).
 It is axiomatic that a clause in the non-binding preamble cannot turn a
non-binding resolution into a substantive one.</P>

<P>B.	The Sponsors Of The Apology Resolution Disavowed Any Substantive
Revision Of Federal Law</P>

<P>	Both the applicable committee report and the lead congressional sponsors
of the Apology Resolution repre sented to Congress that the apology would
not have any substantive impact.  Those assurances confirm what the text
already shows:  that the Apology Resolution con fined itself to apologizing
for the events of a century before, and did not mandate or authorize either
a pres ent-day settlement (political or judicial) of claims, or any judicial
action with respect to the trust lands based on the perceived possibility
of such a settlement.</P>

<P>	As Senate rules require, the Senate Indian Affairs Committee's report
contained a section cataloguing any changes to existing law that the Apology
Resolution would make.  S. Rep. No. 126, 103d Cong., 1st Sess. 35 (1993).
 That section, which contained only a single sen tence, stated that &quot;enactment
of S.J. Res. 19 will not result in any changes in existing law.&quot;  Ibid.</P>

<P>	The legislation's sponsors made similar representa tions.  For example,
responding to a question concerning the &quot;operative intention&quot;
of the resolution, Senator Inouye of Hawaii (the committee chairman and
a chief sponsor) explained:  &quot;[T]his is a simple resolution of apology,
to recognize the facts as they were 100 years ago.  *  *  *  This resolution
does not touch upon the Ha waiian homelands.  I can assure my colleague
of that.&quot;  139 Cong. Rec. 26,428 (1993).  Senator Inouye similarly
confirmed that the &quot;whereas&quot; clauses were not to have operative
effect, but &quot;were placed in the resolution for a very simple reason:
 So that those who are studying this resolution or those students of history
in years to come can look back and say that is the way it was in Ha waii
on January 17, 1893.&quot;  Id. at 26,427.</P>

<P>	Similarly, the House committee chairman, Represen tative George Miller,
confirmed that the resolution &quot;does not confer any new rights [on]
native Hawaiians,&quot; but rather &quot;invokes the name of the U.S. Government
in an apology to native Hawaiians for those actions that were taken.&quot;
 139 Cong. Rec. at 29,106.  And Represen tative Craig Thomas acknowledged
the argument that the resolution would &quot;form the genesis of a call
for repa rations or a civil lawsuit,&quot; but assured the House that &quot;[t]his
resolution does nothing to tip the scales in favor of the proponents of
litigation; if I thought it did, I would not support it.&quot;  Id. at 29,105.
</P>

<P> C.	Construing The Apology Resolution To Have Substan tive Effect
Would Discourage Congress From Re-exam ining Historical Injustices</P>

<P>	As the Apology Resolution illustrates, from time to time Congress determines
that it is appropriate to ac knowledge past injustices.  Congress sometimes
does so by legislating appropriate reparations.  See, e.g., Act of Aug.
10, 1988, Pub. L. No. 100-383, &sect;&sect; 1, 105, 102 Stat. 903, 905 (apologizing
for, inter alia, the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II
and providing for compensation).  And Congress sometimes creates special
procedures for redress.  See, e.g., Indian Claims Commission Act, ch. 959,
&sect; 2, 60 Stat. 1050 (creating tribunal to hear claims by Indian tribes,
including claims &quot;based upon fair and honorable dealings that are not
recognized by any existing rule of law or equity&quot;).</P>

<P>	In most cases, however, Congress chooses a resolu tion whose sole effect
is a moral one:  the acknowledg ment of a failing and a resolve to do better.
 These non- binding resolutions may have both political and histori cal
significance, but they confer no enforceable rights.  See, e.g., S. Con.
Res. 153, 101st Cong., 2d Sess. (1990) (Congress &quot;expresses its deep
regret on behalf of the United States&quot; for the 1890 Wounded Knee Massacre,
&quot;recognizes and commends the efforts of reconciliation initiated by
the State of South Dakota and the Wounded Knee Survivors Association,&quot;
and &quot;expresses its commit ment to acknowledge and learn from our history,
includ ing the Wounded Knee Massacre&quot;); see also S. Res. 39, 109th
Cong., 1st Sess. 3 (2005) (&quot;apologiz[ing]  *  *  *  for the failure
of the Senate to enact anti-lynching legisla tion&quot;); H.R. Res. 194,
110th Cong., 2d Sess. 4 (2008) (&quot;apologiz[ing] to African Americans
 *  *  *  for wrongs committed against them and their ancestors who suf
fered under slavery and Jim Crow&quot;).5</P>

<P>	The Apology Resolution plainly falls into the latter category, and the
Supreme Court of Hawaii's decision to treat it otherwise lends force to
arguments that Con gress should not pass such resolutions because they will
foment litigation.  Allowing the state supreme court's holding to stand
would likely discourage Congress from adopting similar apologies for other
historic wrongs, because the necessary preambles rehearsing those wrongs
might be taken to create judicially cognizable legal claims.  Congress must
be permitted the flexibil ity-which is encroached upon by the decision below-to
determine that a particular historical injustice is better addressed by
an apology than by recognition of present- day claims or &quot;fiduciary&quot;
duties.</P>

<P>III.	THE INJUNCTION ORDERED BY THE SUPREME COURT OF HAWAII SHOULD BE
REVERSED</P>

<P>	The premise of the state supreme court's injunction is that there is
a cloud on the State's title to the trust lands, and that until that cloud
is resolved through polit ical negotiations the State has a fiduciary obligation
not to sell the lands for any purpose, even a purpose ex pressly authorized
by Congress.  Federal law estab lishes, however, that the public trust holds
good title to the ceded lands, and that the State as trustee may sell or
otherwise dispose of those lands in a manner consis tent with the trust
instrument.  Although the state su preme court concluded that the Apology
Resolution &quot;dictates&quot; such an injunction, Pet. App. 85a, as shown
above, the Apology Resolution did not change the gov erning federal law,
did not create a cloud on the title to the trust lands, did not amend the
statutes authorizing the sale of those lands, and did not displace the State's
important authority over the lands at issue.  Because the asserted basis
for the injunction-the Apology Resolu tion-is no basis at all, this Court
should reverse the injunction.</P>

<P>	In the state courts, the State raised a federal defense to respondents'
demand for an injunction.  See Pet. App. 82a &amp; n.26; Defs.-Appellees'
Haw. Answering Br. 18-23.  The only conceivable basis for the state supreme
court's failure to address that meritorious federal defense was the state
court's belief that another federal law, the Apology Resolution, eliminated
that defense.  Because that premise was wrong, federal law precludes respon
dents from showing success on the merits and obtaining an injunction.</P>

<P>	Respondents suggested at the petition stage that the state court would
simply reinstate its holding on state- law grounds.  Br. in Opp. 11, 18.
 That contention is mer itless.  State law cannot create a cloud on the
title by which the United States acquired the trust lands.  Nor can state
law rewrite the trust purposes established by Section 5(f) or impose fiduciary
duties in the administra tion of the trust lands based on matters external
to the federal trust, such as claims of native Hawaiians in an asserted
capacity as successors in interest to the former monarchy.  Because existing
federal law compels the conclusion that there are no valid but unresolved
claims to the trust lands, any remand would be futile.6</P>

<P>*  *  *  *  *</P>

<P>	The United States and the State of Hawaii have maintained the trust
lands for more than a hundred years, and during that time have used the
income to better the lot of all Hawaiians, including native Hawai ians.
 If, as respondents claim, the moral consequences of the events of 1893
call for the public trust to be un done or modified, and for some or all
of the trust corpus to be awarded directly to present-day people of Hawai
ian descent on that basis, then it must be Congress and the President who
make that moral judgment.  But Con gress and the President have made no
such judgment.  The state court therefore had no warrant to freeze the ordinary
disposition of the trust lands at issue.</P>

<P> CONCLUSION</P>

<P>	The judgment of the Supreme Court of Hawaii should be reversed.</P>

<P>DECEMBER 2008</P>

<P>1		&quot;Crown lands&quot; were the lands formerly held by the monarchy
and passed from sovereign to sovereign, although in 1865 the legislature
eli minated the monarch's power to alienate or mortgage these lands.  See
State v. Zimring, 566 P.2d 725, 730-731 (Haw. 1977); Liliuokalani v. United
States, 45 Ct. Cl. 418 (1910).  &quot;Public&quot; and &quot;government&quot;
lands were other lands held by the government.</P>

<P>2		Senator Cullom, the bill's chief sponsor, and Senator Morgan had been
members of a Presidentially appointed commission to visit Hawaii and recommend
a form of government.  Shelby Moore Cullom, Fifty Years of Public Service
285 (1911).  Senator Morgan had chaired the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
when it investigated the over throw of the Hawaiian monarchy.  See S. Rep.
No. 227, 53d Cong., 2d Sess. 1 (1894); Apology Resolution Preamble, 107
Stat. 1511-1512.  Sen ator Foraker chaired the Committee on Pacific Territories.</P>

<P>3		In Rice, this Court held that such an &quot;ancestral inquiry&quot;
concerning eligibility to vote for the trustees of OHA &quot;implicates
the same grave concerns as a classification specifying a particular race
by name&quot; and therefore violated the Fifteenth Amendment.  528 U.S.
at 517.  Because the Court concluded that the voting restriction was invalid
even if Congress could treat native Hawaiians as it does Indian tribes (&quot;a
matter of some dispute&quot;), and because &quot;the validity of the voting
restriction [was] the only question [presented],&quot; the Court assumed
the validity of the underlying programs administered by OHA for the benefit
of native Hawaiians.  Id. at 518-519, 521-522.  As it reaches this Court,
this case involves no challenge brought by respondent or other wise raised
below to the constitutionality of special statutory provisions for the benefit
of native Hawaiians (especially provisions approved by Congress); the only
question is whether the state-court injunction is contrary to the governing
Acts of Congress; and, as discussed, the Admissions Act defines &quot;native
Hawaiian&quot; much more narrowly than would respondents in asserting claims
against the trust land at issue.  As in Rice, therefore, the Court may assume
the substantive validity of Section 5(f) and the state constitutional provisions
and laws that implement the Section 5(f) trust, and the Court need not confront
the &quot;questions of considerable moment&quot; that it identified in Rice.
 Id. at 518.</P>

<P>4		The state supreme court also believed (Pet. App. 34a) that its interpretation
of the Apology Resolution was &quot;supported by&quot; a report  entitled
&quot;From Mauka to Makai:  The River of Justice Must Flow Freely,&quot;
prepared by officials of the Departments of Justice and the Interior in
October 2000, seven years after the Apology Resolution.  That contention
is wrong.  Even if that report had the force of law, or even the status
of post-enactment legislative history, which it does not, it did not purport
to recognize (or to recommend that Congress recognize) &quot;unrelinquished
claims&quot; to trust lands.  Nor did it purport to recommend a freeze on
the transfer of those lands &quot;pending final resolution of native Hawaiian
claims through the political process,&quot; as the state court ordered,
id. at 100a.  Rather, the report recommended that Congress &quot;enact further
legislation to clarify [n]ative Hawaiians' political status and to create
a framework for recognizing a govern ment-to-government relationship with
a representative [n]ative Hawaiian governing body.&quot;  Id. at 35a (emphasis
added; brackets in ori ginal; citation omitted).  One example of &quot;further
legislation,&quot; known as the &quot;Akaka Bill,&quot; has been considered
by Congress in various forms at various times.  See H.R. 505, 110th Cong.,
1st Sess. (2007) (passed by House); see also Pet. App. 7a n.7, 183a-184a.</P>

<P>5		Unlike the Apology Resolution, a joint resolution signed by the President,
these more recent apologies were &quot;concurrent&quot; or &quot;simple&quot;
resolutions, but the distinction is not relevant for present purposes; Congress
routinely enacts joint resolutions that are unmistakably non- substantive.
 See, e.g., Act of May 18, 2006, Pub. L. No. 109-223, 120 Stat. 374 (joint
resolution &quot;[t]o memorialize and honor the contribution of Chief Justice
William H. Rehnquist&quot;).</P>

<P>6		The state supreme court did not address the federal defense to the
injunction expressly.  Because the relevant principles of federal law are
made clear in examining the Apology Resolution and the body of law it left
intact, however, this Court can and should resolve the case at this stage.<BR>
