<H2>A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE ON SUBSTANCE ABUSE 
KA WAI KAU MAI O MALEKA "WATER FROM AMERICA: THE INTOXICATION OF 
THE HAWAIIAN PEOPLE"</H2>

<B>Kimo Alama, Scott Whitney</B>
<BR><BR>
Kava is the one psychoactive drug known throughout
Polynesia and its ceremonial and medicinal use continues to this
day in Fiji, Samoa, and other parts of the Pacific. 
<BR><BR>
There is one clear message from Hawaiian mythology
about kava: it is the food of the gods.
<BR><BR>
As the food of the god[s], 'awa
[or kava] became the medium by which the ali'i
(chiefs) and the kahuna (priests) communicated with the realm
of the spirits. 'Awa
was thus seen by the ali'i
as the first link in the chain of connection to their deified
ancestors.
<BR><BR>
The use of 'awa
was strictly proscribed along lines consistent with Hawaiian cultural
domains [beliefs].
<UL>
<LI>Women were allowed to use it only for medicinal purposes
<LI>Male commoners were allowed to use only lower status, varieties
of the plant 
</UL>
Some evidence indicates there was a daily ceremonial
use of 'awa
in the house of commoners.
<BR><BR>
[The] 'awa
ceremony [was] performed during three occasions:
<OL>
<LI>During the rituals performed by [the] kahuna
<LI>At the welcoming of a guest
<LI>At times of war 
</OL>
Kahuna and ali'i
were at risk for 'awa
addiction. Symptoms included: persistent redness in the eyes and
scaliness of the skin.
<BR><BR>
After the overthrow of the kapu system (a network
of behaviors and beliefs which regulated everything from the smallest
detail of food preparation to the grandest temple ceremonies)
in the early 1800's,
'awa,
along with the newly introduced alcohol, became unregulated and
available for recreational use and abuse.<BR>

<BR><BR>
(During the late 1700's,
rum was first tasted by Kamehameha which was brought in by Captain
Maxwell. Kamehameha saw the dangers of local production of alcohol
and took steps to control it).
<BR><BR>
With the overthrow of the kapu, a void was left in
the kingdom. Commoners and chiefs were left wondering how much
of traditional practice was to be honored. In the realm of alcohol
regulation, it was the missionaries, arriving shortly after the
abolition of the kapu, who were to take the lead.
<BR><BR>
The early missionaries saw the overthrow of the kapu
as a sign from God that Hawai'i
was to become a kingdom based on Christian principles.
<BR><BR>
The decades from 1820 to 1840 were the high point
for the members of the holy community. The missionaries had been
marginal people in their own culture and found new status and
power in the developing kingdom. They viewed Hawaiians as children
or heathen. They found themselves increasingly influential in
the Westernization of the government and its legal system. 
<BR><BR>
The penal code in 1849 stated: "It
shall be a crime for anyone to sell or furnish ardent spirits
to any Native of the Kingdom of Hawai'i."
This meant that the law was directed only at native Hawaiians.
Foreigners were free to buy and sell liquor to each other as they
saw fit.
<BR><BR>
By the 1850's
and 1860's
the missionaries had lost their influence in the government of
the Kingdom. And a new group of foreigners, motivated by economic
concerns and playing on the inter-racial tensions rampant in the
Kingdom, were finally to engineer the overthrow of the monarchy
in 1893.
<BR><BR>
The loss of the monarchy created great demoralization
among Native Hawaiians and an intense nostalgia for the old ways.
<BR><BR>
At the turn of the century, availability of 'awa
decreased and gin replaced it on alters and [in] traditional ceremonies.
The Hawaiian people were fond of the odor of gin and viewed it
as a [sic] highest form of spirit.
<BR><BR>
One must remember that from the end of the 19th century
through the first half of the 20th, Hawaiians were assumed (by
themselves as well as by others) to be a dying race. Hawaiians
died in great numbers from disease, poverty, and alcohol, but
they also died as a people each time a story or a word or a behavior
was lost to the new stories and words and behaviors of the foreigner.
<BR><BR>
King Kalakaua, who brought hula back to public life
and who drank while composing gracious and inventive Hawaiian
songs, died quietly of a stroke in San Francisco. His last word,
spoken into Mr. Edison's
new recording machine, were, "Tell
my people I tried."<br><br>
