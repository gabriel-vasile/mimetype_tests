<p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-indent: 0" align="left"><font face="default" size="3">Attached
is a report from the Hawaii Advisory Committee based upon a community forum held
August 22, 1998, to collect information on the impact of the 1993 Apology
Resolution enacted to recognize the 1893 overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy, and
subsequent meetings with Na Kupuna held September 28, 2000, and a community
forum convened September 29, 2000, to collect information on concerns of Native
Hawaiians and others on the impact of the U.S. Supreme Court decision in <i>Rice
v. Cayetano</i> on Native Hawaiians. All meetings were held in Honolulu, the
capital of Hawai‘i. Commission Vice Chairperson Cruz Reynoso and Commission
members Yvonne Y. Lee and Elsie Meeks joined the Hawaii Advisory Committee in
the September 2000 effort.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-indent: 0" align="left"><font face="default" size="3">The
issue of Native Hawaiian sovereignty and the impact of the 1893 overthrow is
complex. The passage of over 100 years and the migration of various peoples to
the territory and later, the island state of Hawai‘i, has compounded the
impact. What was clear from the 1998 presentations was the need for continued
dialogue and a concerted effort by Native Hawaiians to outline the essential
parameters of reconciliation. While this dialogue was taking place, <i>Rice v.
Cayetano</i> was working its way through the federal court system and eventually
found its way to the U.S. Supreme Court.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-indent: 0" align="left"><font face="default" size="3">The
U.S. Supreme Court ruled in <i>Rice v. Cayetano</i> that a voting procedure
allowing only Native Hawaiians to vote for members of the Office of Hawaiian
Affairs violated the 15th Amendment of the Constitution, which prohibits
race-based exclusion from voting. While the decision was lauded by some, Native
Hawaiians complained that it overlooked the historical facts of what the Apology
Resolution acknowledged as the illegal overthrow of their constitutional
monarchy over a hundred years ago. The <i>Rice</i> decision has occurred during
a flourishing movement for self-determination and self-governance, fueling
feelings of anger and frustration within the Native Hawaiian community.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-indent: 0" align="left"><font face="default" size="3">At
its meeting of March 30, 2000, the Hawaii Advisory Committee determined it
should conduct an open meeting on the impact of the <i>Rice</i> decision.
Because of questions regarding equal protection and the constitutionality of
purported “race-based entitlement programs” evoked by the <i>Rice</i>
decision, the Hawaii Advisory Committee further determined that it should
request involvement of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. The Commission
decided that it would assist the Advisory Committee in obtaining information at
an open session through the participation of members of the Commission.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-indent: 0" align="left"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"><font face="default" size="3">&nbsp;</font></span><font face="default" size="3">Many
participants at the open meeting voiced their opinion that the decision negates
attempts to remedy past inequities and impinges efforts to assist Native
Hawaiians in such areas as education, employment, and health care. Others
suggested that the decision affirms constitutional guarantees for equality.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-indent: 0" align="left"><font face="default" size="3">The
Advisory Committee appreciates the support of Vice Chairperson Cruz Reynoso and
Commissioners Yvonne Y. Lee and Elsie Meeks, who participated in this forum, and
the voluntary contribution of the people of Hawai‘i, both native and
non-native, who appeared before the Advisory Committee panel.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-indent: 0" align="left"><font face="default" size="3">The
Advisory Committee approved submission of this report to the Commission without
objection. It is hoped that the report will add to the dialogue for constructive
change and an equitable solution.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" align="left" style="text-indent: 0"><font face="default" size="3">Respectfully,</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" align="left" style="text-indent: 0"><font face="default" size="3"><br>

</i>Hawaii Advisory Committee</font></p>
