    <p class="style1">05-04-06 -- Aragoncillo, Leandro -- Guilty Plea -- News Release</p>
    <p class="style1">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="center" class="style2">Former Marine and FBI Analyst Pleads Guilty to Espionage; Admits Transferring Classified Information to Assist in Overthrow of Philippines Government </p>
    <p class="style1">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="style1">NEWARK, N.J. &#8211; A former Marine who worked at times under two administrations in the Office
      of the Vice President of the United States pleaded guilty today to espionage and other charges,
      admitting that he took and transferred classified information, including national defense
      documents, to senior political and government officials of the Republic of the Philippines in an
      attempt to destabilize and overthrow that country&#8217;s government, U.S. Attorney Christopher J.
      Christie announced.</p>
    <p class="style1"><br />
    </p>
    <p class="style1">Leandro Aragoncillo, 47, admitted that he regularly transferred to his Philippine contacts national
      security documents classified as Secret, and that the information could be used to the injury of
      the United States or to the advantage of a foreign nation.  He also admitted traveling to the
      Philippines in January 2001 to meet his co-conspirators, including during a visit to the
      Malacanang Palace, the official residence of the president of the Philippines.</p>
    <p class="style1">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p>
    <p class="style1">Aragoncillo also admitted that some of the classified information he removed from of the Office
      of the Vice President (OVP) between approximately October 2000 and February 2002 included
      information marked Top Secret that related to terrorist threats to United States government
      interests in the Republic of the Philippines (ROP). </p>
    <p class="style1"><br />
    </p>
    <p class="style1">Aragoncillo, a naturalized U.S. citizen born in the Philippines and most recently of Woodbury,
      N.J., was an FBI intelligence analyst at Fort Monmouth, N.J. at the time of his arrest on Sept. 10,
      2005.  He admitted today that his espionage activity continued during his time as an FBI analyst.</p>
    <p class="style1"><br />
    </p>
    <p class="style1">&#8220;Aragoncillo took the most solemn of oaths as a U.S. Marine and FBI analyst to protect his
      country and its security,&#8221; said Christie.  &#8220;His betrayal is profound and a disservice to his country
      and all the men and women in military and security positions around the globe who take the oath
      and serve with honor and integrity.&#8221;</p>
    <p class="style1"><br />
    </p>
    <p class="style1">Also arrested last September was Michael Ray Aquino, a former Philippines National Police
      official, who was among those who Aragoncillo is alleged to have passed classified information. 
      Aragoncillo specifically identified Aquino today as a co-conspirator in the transfer of classified
      documents and information.</p>
    <p class="style1"><br />
    </p>
    <p class="style1">Aquino, who remains in federal custody, was indicted on Oct. 6, 2005 and charged with
      conspiring in the passing of classified information to current and former officials in the
      Philippines.</p>
    <p class="style1"><br />
    </p>
    <p class="style1">Aquino awaits trial.  No date has been scheduled for Aquino&#8217;s trial due to extensive pretrial
      discovery.</p>
    <p class="style1"><br />
    </p>
    <p class="style1">Aragoncillo pleaded guilty to four counts of an Indictment returned this morning by a federal
      grand jury.  Count One charged him with Conspiracy to Transmit National Defense Information;
      Count Two charged him with Transmission of National Defense Information.  The maximum
      penalty for both of those crimes is death under certain circumstances &#8211; including the transfer of
      secrets that result in the death of an intelligence source &#8211; that are not present in the case of
      Aragoncillo.  Consequently, the maximum statutory penalty on those counts for Aragoncillo is
      any term of years up to life in prison.</p>
    <p class="style1"><br />
    </p>
    <p class="style1">Count Three charges Aragoncillo with Unlawful Retention of National Defense Information, and
      Count Four charges him with Unlawful Use of a Government Computer, both of which carry a
      maximum penalty of 10 years in prison.</p>
    <p class="style1">&#160;</p>
    <p class="style1">In the Indictment and during his guilty plea before U.S. District Judge William H. Walls,
      Aragoncillo&#8217;s co-conspirators were identified as Executive Branch Official #1, a senior member
      of the executive branch of the ROP from June 1998 through January 2001; Senator #1, who has
      served in the Philippine Senate since June 2001 and was formerly the head of the Philippines
      National Police; Representative #1, who served in the Philippines House of Representatives
      between about 1998 and 2001 and again in 2004; Representative #2, who served in the
      Philippines House of Representatives between 1992 and 2001, and again in 2004; Mayor #1, who
      is a mayor of one of the municipalities located near Metro Manila; and Aquino. </p>
    <p class="style1"><br />
    </p>
    <p class="style1">Aragoncillo admitted his contacts began on July 27, 2000, when a delegation of public officials
      from the Philippines &#8211; including Executive Branch Official #1 and Representative #1 &#8211; met with
      the President of the United States at the White House.  Aragoncillo was then a staff assistant to
      the Vice President&#8217;s Military Advisors and possessed a Top Secret security clearance.</p>
    <p class="style1"><br />
    </p>
    <p class="style1">Aragoncillo said that Representative #1 contacted him in or about October 2000, and requested
      information about the U.S. government&#8217;s views about the Philippines.  Aragoncillo stated that
      Representative #1 appealed to his sense of loyalty to the Philippines and its people in requesting
      the information.  As a result of Representative #1's appeals, Aragoncillo agreed to begin
      supplying Representative #1 with national security-classified documents and information.</p>
    <p class="style1"><br />
    </p>
    <p class="style1">From that time forward, and continuing through his service with the OVP and the FBI,
      Aragoncillo admitted to gathering and providing classified documents and information to
      Executive Official #1, Senator #1, and the other co-conspirators. </p>
    <p class="style1"><br />
    </p>
    <p class="style1">Aragoncillo also admitted that in telephone, e-mail and text message exchanges with Senator #1,
      he advised that the information he was transferring would be useful in assisting Senator #1 and
      his associates in their attempts to destabilize and overthrow the president and government of the
      Philippines.   In one telephone conversation, for example, Aragoncillo admitted that he told
      Senator #1 that the documents were like a &#8220;blueprint&#8221; on how to engineer a coup.  In response,
      Aragoncillo said that Senator #1 told him that the document was &#8220;a good reference&#8221; and that
      Senator #1 &#8220;would print it because we are preparing something like this.&#8221;</p>
    <p class="style1"><br />
    </p>
    <p class="style1">Among other specific admissions by Aragoncillo:</p>
    <p class="style1"><br />
    </p>
    <p class="style1">&#8226; That on Jan. 12, 2001, he met Executive Branch Official #1 at the Malacanang Palace.</p>
    <p class="style1"><br />
    </p>
    <p class="style1">&#8226; That on June 1, 2001, he gathered classified &#8220;Situation Reports&#8221; from the OVP, and transmitted
      them to Representative #1.</p>
    <p class="style1"><br />
    </p>
    <p class="style1">&#8226; That on April 17, 2001, and Jan. 29 and Feb. 6, 2002, he gathered documents classified &#8220;Top
      Secret&#8221; and &#8220;Secret,&#8221; respectively, containing national defense information relating to terrorist
      threats to U.S. government interests in the ROP and exercises involving the U.S. military in the
      Philippines.</p>
    <p class="style1"><br />
    </p>
    <p class="style1">&#8226; That he sought positions with the FBI, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the National
      Security Agency, to gain access to classified documents and information that would be useful to
      his co-conspirators.</p>
    <p class="style1"><br />
    </p>
    <p class="style1">&#8226; That beginning in September 2004, he began gathering classified documents from FBI </p>
    <p class="style1">computers located at Fort Monmouth relating to the ROP, and thereafter he transmitted classified
      documents and information to his co-conspirators until his arrest on September 10, 2005.</p>
    <p class="style1"><br />
    </p>
    <p class="style1">&#8226; That from approximately January to April 2005, he transmitted by e-mail approximately 30
      documents classified &#8220;Secret&#8221; and &#8220;Confidential&#8221; to Senator #1 and Aquino, including
      documents containing national defense information.</p>
    <p class="style1"><br />
    </p>
    <p class="style1">&#8226; That on Feb. 28 and Aug. 4, 2005, and on other occasions, he transmitted documents to his
      contacts containing classified information about confidential intelligence sources of the U.S.
      government. </p>
    <p class="style1"><br />
    </p>
    <p class="style1">&#8226; That approximately two weeks before his arrest, on Aug. 25, 2005, he sought to return to his
      position as a Staff Assistant in the OVP.</p>
    <p class="style1"><br />
    </p>
    <p class="style1">Christie credited Special Agents of the FBI, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge
      Leslie Wiser, Jr., in Newark, for their investigation of the espionage case.</p>
    <p class="style1"><br />
    </p>
    <p class="style1">The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Karl H. Buch and Michael Buchanan,
      of the U.S. Attorney&#8217;s Office Criminal Division, and Clifford I. Rones, Senior Trial Attorney,
      U.S. Department of Justice in Washington.</p>
