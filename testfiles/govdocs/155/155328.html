        <div style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">I rise today in strong support of H.R. 505, the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act, which begins to provide a measure of justice for the indigenous, native people of the Hawaiian islands. I could argue the legal and constitutional arguments on why this bill should be passed, but I want to take a few minutes to share some of the history to show why this bill is so important to all the people of Hawai&lsquo;i.</div>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <div style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">As many of you know, the Kingdom of Hawai&lsquo;i was overthrown in 1893. Hawai&lsquo;i&rsquo;s last Queen, Lili&lsquo;uokalani, was deposed by an armed group of businessmen and sugar planters, who were American by birth or heritage, with the support of U.S. troops. The Queen agreed to relinquish her throne, under protest, to avoid bloodshed. She believed the United States, with which Hawai&lsquo;i had diplomatic relations, would restore her to the throne. As we now know, despite the objections of President Grover Cleveland, the injustice of the overthrow was allowed to stand, and the Republic of Hawai&lsquo;i was established. </div>
        <div style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</div>
        <div style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">A few years later, in 1898, the United States annexed Hawai&lsquo;i. Prior to annexation, a petition drive organized by Native Hawaiians secured signatures of about two-thirds of the Native Hawaiian population opposing annexation (29,000 signatures out of an estimated Native Hawaiian population of 40,000). These petitions are now in the National Archives.</div>
        <div style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</div>
        <div style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">The Hawaiian culture was under siege. The Republic of Hawai&lsquo;i prohibited the use of the Hawaiian language in Hawai&lsquo;i schools. Everyday use of the Hawaiian language diminished greatly and it was in danger of dying out. Hula, which had been suppressed by the missionaries and then restored by King Kalaukaua a few years before the overthrow, survived but did not flourish. Hawaiians were pressured to assimilate and much was lost. </div>
        <div style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</div>
        <div style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">When Prince Jonah Kuhio Kalaniana&lsquo;ole was elected to serve as Hawai&lsquo;i&rsquo;s delegate to Congress, he succeeded in passing the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act of 1920, which set aside some 200,000 acres of land for Native Hawaiians. The reason for the legislation was the landless status of so many Native Hawaiians, who were displaced by newcomers and became the most improvished population in their native land. In recognition of its trust responsibility toward Native Hawaiians, Congress passed the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, which is still in force.</div>
        <div style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</div>
        <div style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">Hawai&lsquo;i became a state in 1959. Beginning in the late 1960s and early 1970s, a Native Hawaiian cultural rediscovery began in music, hula, language, and other aspects of the culture. This cultural renaissance was inspired by hula masters (kumu hula), who helped bring back ancient and traditional hula; musicians and vocalists, who brought back traditional music and sang in the Hawaiian language; and political leaders, who sought to protect Hawaii&rsquo;s sacred places and natural beauty. </div>
        <div style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</div>
        <div style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">This flowering of Hawaiian culture was not met with fear in Hawai&lsquo;i, but with joy and celebration and an increased connection with each other. People of all ethnicities in Hawai&lsquo;i respect and honor the Native Hawaiian culture. We are not threatened by the idea of self determination by Native Hawaiians. </div>
        <div style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</div>
        <div style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">In 1978, Hawai&lsquo;i convened a constitutional convention that was designed, in part, to right some of the wrongs done to Native Hawaiians. The constitutional convention created the Office of Hawaiian Affairs or OHA so that Native Hawaiians would have some ability to manage their own matters. The people of Hawai&lsquo;i ratified the creation of OHA and voted to allow the trustees of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs to be elected solely by Native Hawaiians. Although the Supreme Court in <u>Rice</u> v. <u>Cayetano</u> decided that limiting the vote in this manner violated the 15<sup>th</sup> Amendment, that decision was based on the fact that the State of Hawai&lsquo;i ran the elections, not whether or not Native Hawaiians are an indigenous, native group with an inherent sovereignty. In fact, the court expressly avoided the issue of whether or not Native Hawaiians are analogous to an Indian tribe.</div>
        <div style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</div>
        <div style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">The Constitutional Convention also laid the ground work for the return of some federal lands to Native Hawaiians, including the island of Kaho&lsquo;olawe, which is currently held in trust for a future Native Hawaiian governing entity. The ConCon, as it is known in Hawai&lsquo;i, also designated the Hawaiian language (along with English) as the official state language of Hawai&lsquo;i for the first time since the overthrow in 1893.</div>
        <div style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</div>
        <div style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">I was in the Hawai&lsquo;i State Legislature when we approved creation of Hawaiian language immersion schools, recognizing that language is an integral part of a culture and people. The Hawaiian language was in danger of disappearing. Public Hawaiian language preschools, called Punana Leo, were started in 1984. We now have Hawaiian language elementary, middle, and high schools in Hawai&lsquo;i, and a new generation of fluent Hawaiian language speakers are helping to keep this beautiful and culturally important language alive. Other native peoples are looking to the Hawai&lsquo;i model as a means of preserving and perpetuating their native languages.</div>
        <div style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</div>
        <div style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">We can trace the genesis of this bill, embodying the hope of an indigenous people to control their own fate, all the way back to the overthrow of 1893. It has been a long road. I believe how we treat our native indigenous people reflects our values and who we are. Clearly, there is much in the history of our interactions with the native people of what is now the United States that makes us less than proud. But one of the great attributes of America has always been the ability to look objectively at our history, learn from it, and where possible make amends.</div>
        <div style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</div>
        <div style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">Native Hawaiians, like American Indians and Alaska Natives, have an inherent sovereignty based on their status as indigenous, native people. They desire the right to exercise management over their own affairs and land. By law, a portion of income from the former crown lands of the Kingdom of Hawai&lsquo;i (also called ceded lands) is allocated to benefit the Native Hawaiian people. At present, that income is managed by the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, a state agency. Management of this income and Hawaiian lands should be done by a Native Hawaiian governing entity now that the trustees of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs are elected by all the residents of the State of Hawai&lsquo;i and not just Native Hawaiians.</div>
        <div style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</div>
        <div style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">As has already been mentioned today, this legislation is supported by the great majority of Hawai&lsquo;i&rsquo;s people, by its Republican governor, by our State Legislature, and by dozens of organizations, including the National Congress of American Indians and the Alaska Federation of Natives. </div>
        <div style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</div>
        <div style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">This legislation primarily affects the State of Hawai&lsquo;i. Our state motto, which is the same as that of the Kingdom of Hawai&lsquo;i, is &ldquo;Ua mau ke ea o ka aina i ka pono,&rdquo; which means &ldquo;the life of the land is perpetuated in righteousness.&rdquo; This is a historic vote and one that helps to perpetuate righteousness by righting a historic wrong. I ask that you stand with the people of Hawai&lsquo;i and oppose the Flake amendment, oppose the motion to recommit, and support passage of the bill. </div>
        <div style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</div>
        <div style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">Mahalo nui loa (thank you very much).</div>
