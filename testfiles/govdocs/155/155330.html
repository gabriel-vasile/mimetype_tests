  <h2>An Abundance of Opportunity</h2><p>Ambassador Molly H. Bordonaro</p><strong><p>Interview by Anthony Manduca originally appeared in <em>The Times of Malta,</em> 27 September 2005</p><p>ANTHONY MANDUCA speaks to the new American Ambassador to <br />Malta, MOLLY BORDONARO, about US-Maltese relations, the Iraqi <br />war and the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />One has to admire Molly Bordonaro&rsquo;s sense of optimism when it <br />comes to a such a sensitive foreign policy issue as the war in Iraq. <br />Despite the difficulties being encountered by the United States and <br />its coalition allies in the aftermath of the overthrow of Saddam <br />Hussein President Bush&rsquo;s new ambassador to Malta believes <br />things are getting better in Iraq.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />I pointed out to her that former Secretary of State Colin Powell (like <br />her, a Republican) recently criticised the conduct of the Bush <br />administration in the war in Iraq. Do she acknowledge that many <br />critical mistakes were made by the US in the aftermath of the <br />overthrow of the Saddam Hussein regime and did she actually <br />believe there is light at the end of the tunnel in Iraq?<br />&nbsp;<br />&ldquo;Nobody can predict how a war is going to be and so you can always <br />second guess. There is tremendous success that has been made <br />in Iraq. There have been free elections where eight million people <br />turned out to vote, over 3,200 schools have been refurbished and <br />renovated, people are going back to work, children are going back to <br />school, the majority of the people in Iraq do not support the <br />insurgency movement, they are supportive of furthering democracy <br />and establishing peace in their country. <br />&nbsp;<br />&ldquo;So these are all points of success which can be absolutely looked <br />at, and we&nbsp; are continuing to see greater measures of success as <br />we move forward. So, yes, we can definitely see light at the end of <br />the tunnel because of these successive steps that have been <br />achieved. We are going to continue to see that type of success and <br />this is going to be very, very important. We are going to stay the <br />course, and make sure that Iraq is a safe, free country with a <br />democratic regime,&rdquo; she insisted. <br />&nbsp;<br />I point out to her that the security situation doesn&rsquo;t seem to be <br />getting better at all. The car bombs and terrorist attacks are on the <br />increase and two years after the overthrow of Saddam Hussein the <br />road from Baghdad airport to the so-called green zone is still not <br />secure.<br />&nbsp;<br />She sticks to her position: &ldquo;I would disagree. Things are getting <br />better. We can point to the elections where eight million people <br />turned out to vote, to the renovations of the schools, to the number of <br />Iraqis returning to work who are now living in a free society where <br />they can control their destiny and the destiny of their children.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;<br />&ldquo;Unfortunately there are insurgents out there who are terrorists. <br />They want democracy to fail and they want to have a tyrannical <br />dictatorship. We cannot let these very few people, who are in the <br />minority, succeed. We can&rsquo;t even point to them as overshadowing <br />the successful steps that have been achieved, because there has <br />been tangible success and there will continue to be tangible <br />success and we continue to believe in the end that we will be able to <br />defeat terrorism. It is critically important for Europe, the US, Malta, to <br />defeat terrorism.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;<br />Ms Bordonaro, who is from Portland , Oregon, is the fifth political <br />appointee in a row to be appointed US ambassador to Malta. She <br />has worked in public relations and was Mr Bush&rsquo;s regional <br />campaign chairman for the Pacific States (California, Oregon and <br />Washington State) in the presidential campaigns of 2000 and 2004 <br />as well as the chairman of the Oregon Victory 2000 and 2004 <br />presidential campaigns. In 1998, she was the Republican Party&rsquo;s <br />candidate for the US House of Representatives in Oregon&rsquo;s First <br />District but was not elected.<br />&nbsp;<br />Asked what her reaction was to her appointment by President <br />George W. Bush and how her past career would help her in her new <br />post, she replied:&nbsp; &ldquo;I was very humbled and honoured that President <br />Bush appointed me as US Ambassador in Malta. I am very pleased <br />to be given this post here. My husband is first generation American <br />from Sicily&nbsp; and we are very familiar with this part of the world and so <br />were very pleased to be coming to Malta. <br />&nbsp;<br />&ldquo;My background is very different from many diplomats. I have spent <br />many years in the private sector and I think bringing a different skill <br />set from the business world to this task is a benefit. I also have a <br />background in politics and I hope that that will bring a whole deal of <br />experience to the issues that we will be working with and ultimately <br />to strengthen the ties between the two countries.&rdquo;<br />Regarding the strengths and weaknesses of US-Maltese bilateral <br />relations Ms Bordonaro describes the relationship between the two <br />countries as &ldquo;very strong&rdquo;. <br />&nbsp;<br />&ldquo;It&rsquo;s continuing to grow stronger. As you know President Bush and <br />Prime Minister Gonzi are meeting at the White House on October 3 &ndash; <br />a great representation of the fact that both leaders think the <br />relationship is valuable. I think we will build on that relationship <br />which is critical for very important reasons and issues such as <br />security.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;<br />The Ambassador says she would like to strengthen the <br />relationship between the two countries and would like to see further <br />collaboration on important issues particularly global security &ldquo;and <br />there is a lot of room to do some work on that because of Malta&rsquo;s <br />strategic location in the Mediterranean.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;I hope during my tenure to accomplish very specific things that will <br />help with the overall collaboration between our two countries on <br />working on global security issues. There are some other <br />agreements and treaties that our countries are working on and I <br />hope these come to completion as well,&rdquo; she says.<br />&nbsp;<br />Asked to define US interests in Malta, Ms Bordonaro calls these <br />&ldquo;important&rdquo; and adds: &ldquo;It is particularly important because of Malta&rsquo;s <br />location in the Mediterranean. The US is very interested in working <br />closely with Malta on global security. There are business interests <br />as well, and then of course there is an interest among Americans in <br />the historic and tourist aspect of this great country.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;<br />The Ambassador believes Malta has&nbsp; played a very important role <br />on the issue of global security.&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;As you probably know the air space <br />and water space around Malta is 1,800 times the size of the island <br />so this is a great part of the Mediterranean that Malta is directly <br />responsible for. Malta has worked with the US on specific issues <br />such as port security and immigration. Furthermore, Malta has also <br />allowed our naval ships to come here, and has given us some <br />airspace rights as well. So we have worked very closely and our two <br />militaries also work very closely on specific issues.&rdquo;<br />Malta and America still do not have a double taxation treaty and <br />Maltese citizens still need a visa to visit the US, something <br />successive ambassadors have failed to achieve any progress over. <br />Did she think she could make a difference?<br />&ldquo;We are continuing to have a dialogue on these issues and I think <br />on the technical aspects we are beginning to make progress. There <br />are specific technical issues that need to be met for these matters to <br />go forward. I know that both of these issues will be raised in the <br />meeting between the Prime Minister and President Bush. I think that <br />hopefully, on the technical side, progress will be made.&rdquo;<br />Ms Bordonaro said the US embassy was continuing to work on the <br />commercial side of relations with Malta and a seminar entitled <br />Doing Business With The United States is being organised this <br />Friday in co-operation with the Maltese-American Chamber <br />&ldquo;We are working with American corporations &ndash; I know my <br />predecessor did some work bringing some companies to Houston <br />to visit the oil industry. So we are going to continue to work along <br />those roads. We think this is an attractive place for American <br />business because of the highly educated workforce and the location <br />in the Mediterranean.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;<br />Asked what Malta&rsquo;s EU membership meant for US-Maltese <br />relations, the Ambassador says that it has added a new dimension <br />to the relationship &ldquo;because of a number of issues we are working <br />on with EU countries. Not only the commercial and trade aspects <br />which are very significant &ndash; we have a trillion dollars in trade <br />between the EU and the US &ndash; but on the overall picture &ndash; on peace, <br />freedom , democracy, the US sees Europe and the EU in particular <br />as its number one partner on the aspect, and so we look forward to <br />working with Malta &ndash; now an EU member &ndash; on these very important <br />issues.&rdquo; <br />&nbsp;<br />Regarding whether the US has identified a site for its new <br />embassy in Malta and whether a target date has been set to open <br />the new embassy, Ms Bordonaro said that the embassy is working <br />right now on selecting a site and that they do not have a target date.&nbsp;<br />&ldquo;We think this is going to be a good thing, not only for us in building <br />a new embassy but also for the Maltese &ndash; this will be a $50 million <br />investment into the local economy. Hopefully this will be soon and <br />we will be able to move forward&rdquo;. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />I asked her whether George Bush&rsquo;s re-election last November <br />ushered in a more internationalist US foreign policy and better <br />US-European relations as many people in Europe had hoped.&nbsp; <br />&ldquo;Yes. President Bush was in Brussels in February. He is reaching <br />out and absolutely believes that the EU and Europe are absolutely <br />critical to the success of freedom, democracy and human rights <br />being spread to all parts of the world, in particular the Middle East.&nbsp; <br />President Bush is very focused on building a stronger partnership <br />with Europe and I believe that as a result of his efforts and his trip to <br />Brussels we are beginning to see the relationship strengthened in <br />the past few months.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;<br />Questioned whether President Bush&rsquo;s foreign policy is sometimes <br />unjustly criticised as unilateralist or selfish Ms Bordonaro said she <br />believes President Bush&rsquo;s policies&nbsp; are to the benefit of Europe, the <br />United States and everyone in the world. <br />&nbsp;<br />&ldquo;If we achieve freedom, democracy and peace in Iraq, then this will <br />benefit everyone&rsquo;s global security, and that includes people in Malta. <br />Whether there is criticism or not doesn&rsquo;t impact how decisions are <br />made. Clearly decisions must be made to enhance freedom, to <br />enhance human rights and not support dictators or oppressive <br />regimes.<br />&nbsp;<br />&ldquo;So these policies are made and President Bush made them in a <br />collective manner and continues to work to create this coalition, to <br />broaden this coalition and to enhance this partnership with Europe <br />on this specific issue which may have caused some criticism in the <br />past. I believe we will continue to see a greater partnership because <br />it is in everyone&rsquo;s interest.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;<br />What did she think the aftermath of hurricane Katrina did for the <br />image of the US? There has been a lot of criticism at the federal <br />government&rsquo;s weak response to the hurricane, including harsh <br />criticism by Republican politicians. What went wrong?<br />&ldquo;First of all it shows that there is no nation that is not vulnerable to <br />the impact of human nature. This has been the worst hurricane that <br />we have seen in modern history to hit the US.&nbsp; It was a tremendous <br />tragedy and unfortunately it is unavoidable when it is mother nature. <br />President Bush has said there were some things that could have <br />been done better. He takes full responsibility and looks forward to a <br />thorough examination after we&nbsp; move forward to help people and <br />rebuild so that in the future some of the mistakes can be learnt. <br />&nbsp;<br />&ldquo;However, right now, the image that is shining through is that <br />America is a very compassionate place. It is reaching out to its own <br />countrymen in numerous ways, both at the federal government&nbsp; level <br />and other levels of government. So the compassion of the American <br />people who are opening up their homes for people who have lost <br />their homes, who are donating goods and services, doctors who <br />have been going to the area &ndash; that&rsquo;s the image which is shining <br />through. Where there were some mistakes made we will correct <br />them. But most importantly it showed the true compassion of the <br />US. <br />&nbsp;<br />&ldquo;I also want to say it showed the compassion of the people around <br />the world. I was personally very touched by what people here in <br />Malta did. I recently accepted a cheque from the Civil Protection <br />Department and also from the Maltese Red Cross. I have been very <br />touched by the contributions and the prayers from lots of people <br />here in Malta,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />I pointed out that what shocked many people in the aftermath of <br />Katrina were the scenes of inequality that were clearly visible &ndash; the <br />images of the poor in New Orleans who were left behind to fend for <br />themselves by the richest and most powerful country in the world. <br />Did she agree that these scenes damaged the image of the US to a <br />certain extent?<br />&nbsp;<br />&ldquo;America, just like any country has areas of lower income and we <br />are just like any other nation where we are constantly working on <br />raising the quality of life for all individuals. Unfortunately in any <br />natural disaster like this those that tend to consistently need help in <br />vulnerable situations need help the greatest. We are a <br />compassionate country because we are reaching out tremendously <br />to help those individuals. We have historically always done that&rdquo;. <br />I asked whether she agreed with President Bush who said that he <br />hoped to &ldquo;clear away the legacy of inequality&rdquo; as the hurricane-hit <br />Gulf Coast was rebuilt. Could this be a turning point in the way the <br />federal government looks at its cities? <br />&nbsp;<br />&ldquo;The policy of this administration and of America has always been to <br />try to lift up those who are most in need, and the greatest thing about <br />America is that there is always an abundance of opportunity both to <br />help those who are most in need and also for those who are most <br />needy to find opportunity. I support what President Bush has said: <br />this does create an opportunity to again, reach out to those who are <br />most in need in unique ways, help them rebuild their lives and find <br />new opportunities.&rdquo; <br />&nbsp;<br />Not an easy task, but time will tell. <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /></p></strong><p />
