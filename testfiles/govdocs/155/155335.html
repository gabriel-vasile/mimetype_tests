                                  critical issue of future U.S. policy towards
                                  Iraq, particularly its military dimensions.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I will summarize my thoughts briefly in the first pages of my
                                  prepared statement and opening remarks, and
                                  include more detailed analysis in the

                                  </span>Among the main subjects I examine in
                                  this testimony are postwar challenges after a
                                  possible invasion of Iraq, estimates of U.S.
                                  and Iraqi casualties during combat itself, and
                                  the military feasibility of overthrowing
                                  Saddam while continuing the war against al
                                  Qaeda.</font></p>

                                  support the strategy laid out in the
                                  president's September 12 U.N. speech.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                                  </span>By that strategy, Saddam is to be
                                  presented with a final, tough, multilateral
                                  ultimatum on the need to accept U.N.
                                  inspectors and disarm; only if he refuses the
                                  ultimatum or fails to comply with his
                                  disarmament obligations would war then be
                                  undertaken.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                                  </span>The historical track record suggests
                                  strongly that such a policy of containment
                                  would protect American national security
                                  interests.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                                  </span>However, it is a strategy that Congress
                                  needs to remind the administration to sustain,
                                  since both Vice President Cheney and Secretary
                                  of Defense Rumsfeld have appeared to question
                                  its basic conceptual underpinnings over the
                                  past two months, and since the
                                  administration's proposal for a
                                  Congressional resolution authorizing force did
                                  not reiterate the basic 9/12 approach.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                                  </span>It is also a strategy that requires
                                  straight talk to the American people about
                                  what war against Iraq could be like.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                                  </span>Much of the public debate of the last
                                  year has been driven by those who believe such
                                  a war would surely be easy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                                  </span>I believe such talk is not only
                                  unfortunate, but irresponsible, especially
                                  since much of it has been carried out by
                                  members of the quasi-official Defense Policy

                                  twice that number or more, given the

                                  In the aftermath of Saddam's overthrow,
                                  ethnic and communal rivalries could well erupt

                                  </span>The Sunnis in central Iraq will be very
                                  concerned that their interests will be
                                  subordinated to Kurdish and Shia demands.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                                  </span>The Kurds in the north will not easily
                                  accept a diminution of the substantial
                                  autonomy they have enjoyed in the last decade.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                                  </span>And the Shias, representing the largest
                                  of the ethnic groupings, will insist on a
                                  degree of power hitherto denied them under
                                  Sunni regimes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                                  </span>These tensions could easily undermine

                                  meddle for fear of the consequences or because
                                  Iraq is such a rich prize.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                                  </span>The region that Iraq inhabits is so

                                  Assistance Force in Afghanistan has neither of
                                  these characteristics.&nbsp;</font></p>
                                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">There are
                                  several reasons.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                                  </span>First, ISAF is not going very well in
                                  Afghanistan, so this is a poor model for
                                  comparison.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the Bush administration admits as much at present,
                                  but still imprudently hopes that other
                                  countries will simply volunteer to beef up and
                                  expand the mission.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                                  </span>Second, Iraq's Kurds in particular
                                  might well be tempted to try to secede absent
                                  a strong unifying national security force.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                                  </span>Third, Iraq is in a region where
                                  cross-border aggression is more common than is
                                  the case for Afghanistan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                                  </span>Iraq's neighbors might well make
                                  trouble in a destabilized Iraq.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                                  </span>Fourth, Iraq has a much larger army
                                  than did the Taliban, and the United States
                                  hopes to spare much of it in any future war,
                                  partly to avoid creation of the very type of
                                  security vacuum just noted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                                  </span>But we do not know who within that army
                                  is dependable and who may be bent on seeking
                                  vengeance against U.S. forces or internal
                                  foes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Weeding
                                  out bad actors, while also improving training
                                  and discipline, within the Iraqi military will
                                  take time and effort.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                                  </span>Fifth, and relatedly, the overall
                                  importance of the Persian Gulf region may
                                  exceed that of Afghanistan (though that is
                                  open to some debate, to the extent that
                                  Afghanistan could again become a sanctuary for
                                  Islamic extremists).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

                                  interests in general, justifying a substantial
                                  effort.</font></p>

                                  country with three main ethnic groups), began
                                  with 50,000 forces and is still about
                                  20,000-strong.<span style="mso-spacerun:

                                  occupying needs, suggests that an initial
                                  force might have to number more than 200,000
                                  and that a residual force seven years later

                                  troops the first year and anywhere from 7,500

                                  </span>Saddam might also think he could assist

                                  American president, and has not again tried to
