The divide between the Congo and Nile drainage systems extends from north to south through western Rwanda at an average elevation of almost 9,000 feet. On the western slopes of this ridgeline, the land slopes abruptly toward Lake Kivu and the Ruzizi River valley, which form the western boundary with the Democratic Republic of the Congo (formerly Zaire) and constitute part of the Great Rift valley. The eastern slopes are more moderate, with rolling hills extending across central uplands at gradually reducing altitudes, to the plains, swamps, and lakes of the eastern border region.</p><p>Although located only two degrees south of the Equator, Rwanda's high elevation makes the climate temperate. The average daily temperature near Lake Kivu, at an altitude of 4,800 feet (1,463 meters) is 73<sup>o</sup> F (23<sup>o </sup>C). During the two rainy seasons (February-May and September-December), heavy downpours occur almost daily, alternating with sunny weather. Annual rainfall averages 80 centimeters (31 in.) but is generally heavier in the western and northwestern mountains than in the eastern savannas.</p><p><a name="people"></a><b>PEOPLE</b> <br />Rwanda's population density, even after the 1994 genocide, is currently the highest in continental Sub-Saharan Africa. Still a very rural society, many families live in a self-contained compound on a hillside. The urban concentrations are grouped around administrative centers. The indigenous population consists of three ethnic groups. Accounts of their respective arrivals in the area of modern Rwanda were highly politicized during Rwanda's post-colonial era, particularly in the years leading up to the genocide. The Hutus, who comprise the majority of the population (85%), are traditionally farmers of Bantu origin. The Tutsis (14%) are traditionally a pastoral people who by some accounts arrived in the area in the 15th century. Until 1959, they formed the dominant caste under a feudal system based on cattle holding. The Twa (1%) are thought to be the remnants of the earliest settlers of the region. Over 70% of the adult population is literate, but not more than 5% have received secondary education. During 1994-95, most primary schools and more than half of prewar secondary schools reopened. The national university in Butare reopened in April 1995; enrollment is over 7,000. Rebuilding the educational system continues to be a high priority of the Rwandan Government.</p><p><a name="history"></a><b>HISTORY</b> <br />According to folklore, Tutsi cattle breeders began arriving in the area from the Horn of Africa in the 15th century and gradually subjugated the Hutu inhabitants. The Tutsis established a monarchy headed by a mwami (king) and a feudal hierarchy of Tutsi nobles and gentry. However, in some areas of the country, independent Hutu principalities continued to exist, and in other areas Tutsi and Hutu lineages lived in interdependent cooperation under the nominal control of the Tutsi king. Within the monarchy, through a contract known as ubuhake, the Hutu farmers pledged their services and those of their descendants to a Tutsi lord in return for the loan of cattle and use of pastures and arable land. Thus, the Tutsi reduced some Hutu to virtual serfdom. However, boundaries of race and class were somewhat fluid, with most rural Tutsis enjoying few advantages over the Hutu. The first European known to have visited Rwanda was German Count Von Goetzen in 1894. He was followed by missionaries, notably the &quot;White Fathers.&quot; In 1899, the mwami submitted to a German protectorate without resistance. Belgian troops from Zaire chased the small number of Germans out of Rwanda in 1915 and took control of the country.</p><p>After World War I, the League of Nations mandated Rwanda and its southern neighbor, Burundi, to Belgium as the territory of Ruanda-Urundi. Following World War II, Ruanda-Urundi became a UN Trust Territory with Belgium as the administrative authority. Reforms instituted by the Belgians in the 1950s encouraged the growth of democratic political institutions but were resisted by the Tutsi traditionalists who saw in them a threat to Tutsi rule. An increasingly restive Hutu population, encouraged by the Belgian military, sparked a revolt in November 1959, resulting in the overthrow of the Tutsi monarchy. Two years later, the Party of the Hutu Emancipation Movement (PARMEHUTU) won an overwhelming victory in a UN-supervised referendum.</p><p>During the 1959 revolt and its aftermath, more than 160,000 Tutsis fled to neighboring countries. The PARMEHUTU government, formed as a result of the September 1961 election, was granted internal autonomy by Belgium on January 1, 1962. A June 1962 UN General Assembly resolution terminated the Belgian trusteeship and granted full independence to Rwanda (and Burundi) effective July 1, 1962.</p><p>Gregoire Kayibanda, leader of the PARMEHUTU Party, became Rwanda's first elected president, leading a one-party government chosen from the membership of the directly elected unicameral National Assembly. Peaceful negotiation of international problems, social and economic elevation of the masses, and integrated development of Rwanda were the ideals of the Kayibanda regime; in reality the Kayibanda government promoted a Hutu-supremicist ideology.</p><p>Relations with 43 countries, including the United States, were established in the first 10 years. Despite the progress made, inefficiency and corruption began festering in government ministries in the mid-1960s. On July 5, 1973, the military took power under the leadership of Maj. Gen. Juvenal Habyarimana, who dissolved the National Assembly and the PARMEHUTU Party and abolished all political activity.</p><p>In 1975, President Habyarimana formed the National Revolutionary Movement for Development (MRND) whose goals were to promote peace, unity, and national development, in the guise of a one-party state. The movement was organized from the &quot;hillside&quot; to the national level and included elected and appointed officials.</p><p>Under MRND aegis, Rwandans went to the polls in December 1978, overwhelmingly endorsed a new constitution, and confirmed President Habyarimana as president. President Habyarimana was re-elected in 1983 and again in 1988, when he was the sole candidate. Responding to public pressure for political reform, President Habyarimana announced in July 1990 his intention to transform Rwanda's one-party state into a multi-party democracy.</p><p>On October 1, 1990, Rwandan exiles banded together as the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) and invaded Rwanda from their base in Uganda. The rebel force, composed primarily of ethnic Tutsis, blamed the government for failing to democratize and resolve the problems of some 500,000 Tutsi refugees living in the diaspora around the world. The war dragged on for almost 2 years until a cease-fire accord was signed July 12, 1992, in Arusha, Tanzania, fixing a timetable for an end to the fighting and political talks, leading to a peace accord and power sharing, and authorizing a neutral military observer group under the auspices of the Organization for African Unity. A cease-fire took effect July 31, 1992, and political talks began August 10, 1992.</p><p>On April 6, 1994, the airplane carrying President Habyarimana and the President of Burundi was shot down as it prepared to land at Kigali. Both presidents were killed. As though the shooting down was a signal, military and militia groups began rounding up and killing all Tutsis and political moderates, regardless of their ethnic background.</p><p>The prime minister and her 10 Belgian bodyguards were among the first victims. The killing swiftly spread from Kigali to all corners of the country; between April 6 and the beginning of July, a genocide of unprecedented swiftness left up to 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus dead at the hands of organized bands of militia--<i>Interahamwe</i>. Even ordinary citizens were called on to kill their neighbors by local officials and government-sponsored radio. The president's MRND Party was implicated in organizing many aspects of the genocide.</p><p>The RPF battalion stationed in Kigali under the Arusha accords came under attack immediately after the shooting down of the president's plane. The battalion fought its way out of Kigali and joined up with RPF units in the north. The RPF then resumed its invasion, and civil war raged concurrently with the genocide for 2 months. French forces landed in Goma, Zaire, in June 1994 on a humanitarian mission. They deployed throughout southwest Rwanda in an area they called &quot;Zone Turquoise,&quot; ostensibly to quell the genocide and stop the fighting there; many members of the genocidal rump regime established after the genocide escaped through the French zone to eastern Congo. The Rwandan Army was quickly defeated by the RPF and fled across the border to Zaire followed by some 2 million refugees who fled to Zaire, Tanzania, and Burundi. The RPF took Kigali on July 4, 1994, and the war ended on July 16, 1994. The RPF took control of a country ravaged by war and genocide. Up to 1 million had been murdered, another 2 million or so had fled, and another million or so were displaced internally.</p><p>The international community responded with one of the largest humanitarian relief efforts ever mounted. The United States was one of the largest contributors. The UN peacekeeping operation, UNAMIR, was drawn down during the fighting but brought back up to strength after the RPF victory. UNAMIR remained in Rwanda until March 8, 1996.</p><p>Following an uprising by the ethnic Tutsi Banyamulenge people in eastern Zaire in October 1996, a huge movement of refugees began which brought more than 600,000 back to Rwanda in the last 2 weeks of November. This massive repatriation was followed at the end of December 1996 by the return of another 500,000 from Tanzania, again in a huge, spontaneous wave. Less than 100,000 Rwandans are estimated to remain outside of Rwanda, and they are thought to be the remnants of the defeated army of the former genocidal government, its allies in the civilian militias known as <i>Interahamwe</i>, and soldiers recruited in the refugee camps before 1996.</p><p>In 2001, the government began implementation of a grassroots village-level justice system, known as <i>gacaca</i>, in order to address the enormous backlog of cases stemming from the genocide. Despite periodic prison releases, including the most recent January 2006 release of approximately 7,000 prisoners, tens of thousands of individuals remain in the prison system, some scheduled to face the traditional court system, some awaiting trial by <i>gacaca</i> courts, some convicted by <i>gacaca</i> courts and returned to serve their sentences. By the end of 2006, 818,000 genocide suspects had been identified by the <i>gacaca</i> courts; case totals are now over one million. These courts hoped to complete their caseload by the end of 2008.</p><p>In February 2008 a moderate earthquake in neighboring D.R.C., near the southern Rwandan border town of Cyangugu, caused several dozen deaths and hundreds of injuries in two Rwandan districts, with hundreds of homes rendered uninhabitable and several churches demolished. Rwandan authorities responded quickly to the tragedy and, with the assistance of local and international non-governmental organizations (NGOs), assisted those in need.</p><p><a name="gov"></a><a name="political"></a><b>GOVERNMENT AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS</b> <br />After its military victory in July 1994, the RPF organized a coalition government similar to that established by President Habyarimana in 1992. Called &quot;The Broad Based Government of National Unity,&quot; its fundamental law is based on a combination of the June 1991 constitution, the Arusha accords, and political declarations by the parties. The MRND Party was outlawed. In April 2003, the transitional National Assembly recommended the dissolution of the Democratic Republican Party (MDR), one of eight political parties participating in the Government of National Unity since 1994. Human rights groups noted the subsequent disappearances of political figures associated with the MDR, including at least one parliamentarian serving in the National Assembly. On May 26, 2003, Rwanda adopted a new constitution that eliminated reference to ethnicity and set the stage for presidential and legislative elections in August and September 2003. The seven remaining political parties endorsed incumbent Paul Kagame for president, who was elected to a 7-year term on August 25, 2003. Rwanda held its first-ever legislative elections September 29 to October 2, 2003. A ninth political party formed after these 2003 elections. In the spring of 2006, the government conducted local non-partisan elections for district mayors and for sector and cell executive committees. Elections for the Chamber of Deputies occurred in September 2008; the RPF won an easy victory in coalition with six small parties, taking 42 of 53 directly-elected seats. As provided in the constitution, 24 seats were also accorded to women candidates in indirect elections. Women now hold 45 of the 80 seats in the Chamber. The elections were peaceful and orderly, despite irregularities.</p><p>Challenges facing the government include promoting further democratization and judicial reform; completion of prosecution of hundreds of thousands of individuals for crimes relating to the 1994 genocide, either by the regular court system or the <i>gacaca</i> system; preventing the recurrence of any insurgency directed by ex-military and <i>Interahamwe</i> militia who remain in eastern Congo; and the continuing work on medium- and long-term development planning.</p><p><b>Principal Government Officials</b> <br />President--Paul Kagame<br />Prime Minister--Bernard Makuza<br />Minister of Foreign Affairs--Rosemary Musemenali <br />Ambassador to the United States--James Kimonyo<br />Ambassador to the United Nations--Joseph Nsengemana</p><p>Rwanda maintains an <a href="http://www.rwandaembassy.org/">embassy</a> in the United States at 1714 New Hampshire Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20009 (tel. 202-232-2882).</p><p><a name="econ"></a><b>ECONOMY</b> <br />The Rwandan economy is based on the largely rain-fed agricultural production of small, semi-subsistence, and increasingly fragmented farms. It has few natural resources to exploit and a small, uncompetitive industrial sector. While the production of coffee and tea is well suited to the small farms, steep slopes, and cool climates of Rwanda, the average family farm size is one-half hectare, unsuitable for most agro-business purposes, especially in view of government ownership of all land and the resettlement of displaced persons. Agribusiness accounts for 36.2% (2007 est.) of Rwanda's GDP and 40.2% of exports. Minerals in 2007 accounted for 35.9% of export earnings, followed by tourism, tea and coffee, and pyrethrum (whose extract is used in insect repellant). Mountain gorillas and other upscale eco-tourism venues are increasingly important sources of tourism revenue. Rwanda's tourism and hospitality sector requires further development. Rwanda is a member of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) and the East African Community. Some 34% of Rwanda's imports originate in Africa, 90% from COMESA countries. The Government of Rwanda has sought to privatize several key firms. Rwandatel, the government fixed-line provider and the country's second-largest mobile phone provider, sold to American-led Terracom in 2006, was resold to a Libyan firm in 2007. The government in the last several years also sold off several government-owned tea estates, and made great strides in completing privatization of the banking sector. Electrogaz, the utility monopoly, remains to be privatized, as do several other parastatals.</p><p>During the 5 years of civil war that culminated in the 1994 genocide, GDP declined in 3 out of 5 years, posting a dramatic decline at more than 40% in 1994, the year of the genocide. The 9% increase in real GDP for 1995, the first postwar year, signaled the resurgence of economic activity, due primarily to massive foreign aid.</p><p>In the immediate postwar period--mid-1994 through 1995--emergency humanitarian assistance of more than $307.4 million was largely directed to relief efforts in Rwanda and in the refugee camps in neighboring countries where Rwandans fled during the war. In 1996, humanitarian relief aid began to shift to reconstruction and development assistance.</p><p>Since 1996, Rwanda has experienced steady economic recovery, thanks to foreign aid (now over $500 per year) and governmental reforms. Since 2002, the GDP growth rate has ranged from 3%-9% per annum, and inflation had ranged between 2%-9%. Rwanda depends on significant foreign imports (over $400 million per year). Exports have increased, up to $145 million in 2007. Private investment remains below expectations despite an open trade policy, a favorable investment climate, cheap and abundant labor, tax incentives to businesses, stable internal security, and crime rates that are comparatively low. Investment insurance also is available through the Africa Trade Insurance Agency or the Overseas Private Investment Corporation. The weakness of exports as well as low domestic savings rates are threats to future growth.</p><p>The Government of Rwanda remains committed to a strong and enduring economic climate for the country. To this end the government focuses on poverty reduction, infrastructure development, privatization of government-owned assets, expansion of the export base, and liberalization of trade. The implementation of a value added tax of 18% and improved tax collections are having a positive impact on government revenues and thereby services rendered. Banking reform and low corruption also are favorable current trends. Agricultural reforms, improved farming methods, and increased use of fertilizers are improving crop yields and national food supply. Moreover, the government is pursing educational and healthcare programs that bode well for the long-term quality of Rwanda's human resource skills base.</p><p>Many challenges remain for Rwanda. Rwanda is dependent on significant foreign aid. Exports continue to lag far behind imports and will continue to affect the health of the economy. Inflation may become a problem due to the large influx of donor funds. The persistent lack of economic diversification beyond the production of tea, coffee, and minerals keeps the country vulnerable to market fluctuations. Rwanda's landlocked situation necessitates strong highway infrastructure maintenance, and good transport linkages to neighboring countries, especially Uganda and Tanzania, are critical. Transportation costs remain high and, therefore, burden import and export costs. Rwanda has no railway system for port access in Tanzania, although the nearest railhead from Kigali is 380 kilometers away at Isaka, Tanzania. The development of small manufacturing and service industries is needed, and the tourism industry has far greater potential given the current stability, travel infrastructure, and available animal parks as well as other potential tourist sites. In 2006, Rwanda completed the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative and the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) debt initiative, significantly lowering its foreign debt load.</p><p>American business interests in Rwanda are modest,&nbsp;and the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) has yet to make a significant impact in Rwanda. In addition to long-standing tea production by an American firm, and telecommunications sales and service, a U.S. corporation is in the final stages of an agreement with Rwandan authorities to produce 100 MW of electrical power from methane extraction operations in Lake Kivu. A U.S. mining company is investing in local mineral production. Energy needs will stress natural resources in wood and gas, but hydroelectric power development is underway, albeit primarily in the planning stages, as is methane development. Rwanda does not have nuclear power or coal resources. Finally, Rwanda's fertility rate--averaging 5.43 births (2006 est.) per woman--will continue to stress services, and diseases such as AIDS/HIV transmission, malaria, and tuberculosis will have a major impact on human resources.</p><p>Rwanda's government-run radio broadcasts 15 hours a day in Kinyarwanda, English, and French, the national languages. News programs include regular re-broadcasts from international radio such as Voice of America, BBC and Deutsche Welle. There is one government-operated television station. In addition to government-operated Radio Rwanda, there are a number of independent FM radio stations. There are few independent newspapers; most newspapers publish in Kinyarwanda on a weekly, biweekly, or monthly basis. Several Western nations, including the United States, are working to encourage freedom of the press, the free exchange of ideas, and responsible journalism.</p><p><a name="defense"></a><b>DEFENSE</b> <br />The military establishment is comprised of a well-trained army and a small, rotary-wing air force. Defense spending continues to represent a disproportionate share of the national budget, largely due to continuing security problems along the frontiers with the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Burundi in the aftermath of the war. Following withdrawal of Rwandan Armed Forces from the Democratic Republic of the Congo in October 2002, the government completely restructured the military and launched an ambitious plan to demobilize thousands of soldiers. At end state, Rwanda will have a small, well-equipped army of 25,000 soldiers.</p><p><a name="foreign"></a><b>FOREIGN RELATIONS</b> <br />Rwanda is an active member of the international community and has remained in the international spotlight since the genocide. Rwanda is an active member of the UN, having presided over the Security Council during part of 1995. The UN assistance mission in Rwanda (UNAMIR), a UN Chapter Six peacekeeping operation, involved personnel from more than a dozen countries. Most of the UN development and humanitarian agencies have had a large presence in Rwanda. At the height of the humanitarian emergency, more than 200 nongovernmental organizations were carrying out humanitarian operations. In addition to receiving assistance from the international community, Rwanda has also contributed to international peacekeeping missions. Currently, Rwanda Defense Forces (RDF) has four 800-strong battalions deployed in support of the UNAMID Mission in Darfur&nbsp;and one battalion in UNMIS (southern Sudan). As of January 2009, Rwanda was training its 18th peacekeeping battalion since 2006.</p><p>Several west European and African nations, including Belgium, Canada, China, Egypt, the United Kingdom, Libya, the Netherlands, Russia, Sweden, the Holy See, and the European Union maintain diplomatic missions in Kigali.</p><p>In 1998, Rwanda, along with Uganda, invaded the Democratic Republic of the Congo (D.R.C.) to back Congolese rebels trying to overthrow then-President Laurent Kabila. Rwandan troops pulled out of the D.R.C. in October 2002, in accordance with the Lusaka cease-fire agreement. In December 2008, after months of bilateral discussions, Rwanda and the D.R.C. announced&nbsp;a joint military operation against a root cause of instability in the Great Lakes Region--the&nbsp;FDLR (Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda). As of January 2009, Rwandan forces had entered the Congo and begun joint operations with the Congolese armed forces, the FARDC, against the FDLR. The two nations&rsquo; forces also cooperated in reintegrating renegade general Laurent Nkunda&rsquo;s CNDP rebel force into the FARDC; Nkunda was detained by Rwandan authorities.</p><p>In the fall of 2006, Rwanda broke diplomatic relations with France, following a French judge's indictment of senior Rwandan officials on charges of having participated in the shooting down of the presidential jet in 1994. Rwanda rejects these charges. Following her November 2008 arrest in Germany and transfer to France, Chief of Presidential Protocol Rose Kabuye, one of those so charged, began her defense in a Paris court in January 2009. Rwanda, along with Burundi, joined the East African Community in 2007.</p><p><a name="relations"></a><b>U.S.-RWANDAN RELATIONS</b> <br />U.S. Government interests have shifted significantly since the 1994 genocide from a strictly humanitarian concern focusing on stability and security to a strong partnership with the Government of Rwanda focusing on sustainable development. The largest U.S. Government programs are the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and the President's Malaria Initiative, which aim to reduce the impact of these debilitating diseases in Rwanda. Other activities promote rural economic growth and support good governance and decentralization. Overall U.S. foreign assistance to Rwanda has increased four-fold over the past four years.</p><p>A major focus of bilateral relations is the U.S. Agency for International Development's (<a href="http://www.usaid.gov/locations/sub-saharan_africa/countries/rwanda/">USAID</a>) program. In support of the overall Government of Rwanda development plan, USAID aims to improve the health and livelihoods of Rwandans and increase economic and political development. To achieve this, USAID activities focus on:</p><p></p><ul><li>Prevention, treatment and care of HIV/AIDS;</li><li>Reducing mortality and morbidity due to malaria;</li><li>Increasing access to, and use of, voluntary family planning methods;</li><li>Improving maternal and child health;</li><li>Promoting rural economic growth through specialty coffee, dairy, and eco-tourism;</li><li>Encouraging participatory governance and decentralization in 12 target districts;</li><li>Promoting a democratic Rwanda, where the government respects human rights, civil liberties, and the rule of law; and</li><li>Providing food aid to the most vulnerable populations.</li></ul><p>In September 2008, Rwanda signed a Threshold Country Plan (TCP) agreement with the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC). The TCP is implemented by USAID and focuses on strengthening the justice sector and the press, promoting civic participation, and political rights and civil liberties.</p><p>The State Department's Public Affairs section maintains a cultural center in Kigali, which offers public access to English-language publications and information on the United States.</p><p>American business interests have been small; currently, private U.S. investment is limited to the tea industry, franchising (FedEx, Coca-Cola, Western Union, and Moneygram) and small holdings in service and manufacturing concerns. Annual U.S. exports to Rwanda, under $10 million annually from 1990-93, exceeded $40 million in 1994 and 1995. Although exports decreased in the years immediately after the genocide, in 2007 they were estimated at approximately $17 million, a 20% increase over 2006.</p><p><b>Principal U.S. Officials</b> <br />Ambassador--W.
