    the punishment provisions applicable to sections 10 and 11 of title
    18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., was combined with section 11 of title 18,

    "government in the United States" were omitted as unnecessary.

    omitted as covered by the general conspiracy provision,
    incorporated in section 371 of this title. (See reviser's note
    under that section.)
      Words "upon conviction thereof" which preceded "be fined" were
    omitted as surplusage, as punishment cannot be imposed until a
    conviction is secured.
      The phraseology was considerably changed to effect consolidation
    but without any change of substance.
