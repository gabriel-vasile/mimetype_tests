To whom it may concern,

It is time to be responsible and end the budget crisis now.  I
think that it is seditious to try to overthrow the government
from within its very chambers.  Members of Congress guilty of
sedition should be impeached! Unfortunately, the member of the
Ohio delegation that would benefit most from this letter has not
figured out how to open an e-mail account. Please pass this
message to Representative Beamer.
