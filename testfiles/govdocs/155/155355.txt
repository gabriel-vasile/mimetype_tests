    TITLE 42 - THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND WELFARE
    CHAPTER 122 - NATIVE HAWAIIAN HEALTH CARE

-HEAD-
    Sec. 11701. Findings

-STATUTE-
      The Congress finds that:
        (1) Native Hawaiians comprise a distinct and unique indigenous
      people with a historical continuity to the original inhabitants
      of the Hawaiian archipelago whose society was organized as a
      Nation prior to the arrival of the first nonindigenous people in
      1778.
        (2) The Native Hawaiian people are determined to preserve,
      develop and transmit to future generations their ancestral
      territory, and their cultural identity in accordance with their
      own spiritual and traditional beliefs, customs, practices,
      language, and social institutions.
        (3) The constitution and statutes of the State of Hawaii:
          (A) acknowledge the distinct land rights of Native Hawaiian
        people as beneficiaries of the public lands trust; and
          (B) reaffirm and protect the unique right of the Native
        Hawaiian people to practice and perpetuate their cultural and
        religious customs, beliefs, practices, and language.

        (4) At the time of the arrival of the first nonindigenous
      people in Hawaii in 1778, the Native Hawaiian people lived in a
      highly organized, self-sufficient, subsistence social system
      based on communal land tenure with a sophisticated language,
      culture, and religion.
        (5) A unified monarchical government of the Hawaiian Islands
      was established in 1810 under Kamehameha I, the first King of
      Hawaii.
        (6) Throughout the 19th century and until 1893, the United
      States: (A) recognized the independence of the Hawaiian Nation;
      (B) extended full and complete diplomatic recognition to the
      Hawaiian Government; and (C) entered into treaties and
      conventions with the Hawaiian monarchs to govern commerce and
      navigation in 1826, 1842, 1849, 1875 and 1887.
        (7) In the year 1893, the United States Minister assigned to
      the sovereign and independent Kingdom of Hawaii, John L. Stevens,
      conspired with a small group of non-Hawaiian residents of the
      Kingdom, including citizens of the United States, to overthrow
      the indigenous and lawful Government of Hawaii.
        (8) In pursuance of that conspiracy, the United States Minister
      and the naval representative of the United States caused armed
      naval forces of the United States to invade the sovereign
      Hawaiian Nation in support of the overthrow of the indigenous and
      lawful Government of Hawaii and the United States Minister
      thereupon extended diplomatic recognition of a provisional
      government formed by the conspirators without the consent of the
      native people of Hawaii or the lawful Government of Hawaii in
      violation of treaties between the two nations and of
      international law.
        (9) In a message to Congress on December 18, 1893, then
      President Grover Cleveland reported fully and accurately on these
      illegal actions, and acknowledged that by these acts, described
      by the President as acts of war, the government of a peaceful and
      friendly people was overthrown, and the President concluded that
      a "substantial wrong has thus been done which a due regard for
      our national character as well as the rights of the injured
      people required that we should endeavor to repair".
        (10) Queen Lili'uokalani, the lawful monarch of Hawaii, and the
      Hawaiian Patriotic League, representing the aboriginal citizens
      of Hawaii, promptly petitioned the United States for redress of
      these wrongs and for restoration of the indigenous government of
      the Hawaiian nation, but this petition was not acted upon.
        (11) In 1898, the United States annexed Hawaii through the
      Newlands Resolution without the consent of or compensation to the
      indigenous people of Hawaii or their sovereign government who
      were thereby denied the mechanism for expression of their
      inherent sovereignty through self-government and self-
      determination, their lands and ocean resources.
        (12) Through the Newlands Resolution and the 1900 Organic Act,
      the United States Congress received 1.75 million acres of lands
      formerly owned by the Crown and Government of the Hawaiian
      Kingdom and exempted the lands from then existing public land
      laws of the United States by mandating that the revenue and
      proceeds from these lands be "used solely for the benefit of the
      inhabitants of the Hawaiian Islands for education and other
      public purposes", thereby establishing a special trust
      relationship between the United States and the inhabitants of
      Hawaii.
        (13) In 1921, Congress enacted the Hawaiian Homes Commission
      Act, 1920 which designated 200,000 acres of the ceded public
      lands for exclusive homesteading by Native Hawaiians, thereby
      affirming the trust relationship between the United States and
      the Native Hawaiians, as expressed by then Secretary of the
      Interior Franklin K. Lane who was cited in the Committee Report
      of the United States House of Representatives Committee on
      Territories as stating, "One thing that impressed me . . . was
      the fact that the natives of the islands who are our wards, I
      should say, and for whom in a sense we are trustees, are falling
      off rapidly in numbers and many of them are in poverty.".
        (14) In 1938, the United States Congress again acknowledged the
      unique status of the Hawaiian people by including in the Act of
      June 20, 1938 (52 Stat. 781 et seq.), a provision to lease lands
      within the extension to Native Hawaiians and to permit fishing in
      the area "only by native Hawaiian residents of said area or of
      adjacent villages and by visitors under their guidance".
        (15) Under the Act entitled "An Act to provide for the
      admission of the State of Hawaii into the Union", approved March
      18, 1959 (73 Stat. 4), the United States transferred
      responsibility for the administration of the Hawaiian Home Lands
      to the State of Hawaii but reaffirmed the trust relationship
      which existed between the United States and the Hawaiian people
      by retaining the exclusive power to enforce the trust, including
      the power to approve land exchanges, and legislative amendments
      affecting the rights of beneficiaries under such Act.
        (16) Under the Act entitled "An Act to provide for the
      admission of the State of Hawaii into the Union", approved March
      18, 1959 (73 Stat. 4), the United States transferred
      responsibility for administration over portions of the ceded
      public lands trust not retained by the United States to the State
      of Hawaii but reaffirmed the trust relationship which existed
      between the United States and the Hawaiian people by retaining
      the legal responsibility of the State for the betterment of the
      conditions of Native Hawaiians under section 5(f) of the Act
      entitled "An Act to provide for the admission of the State of
      Hawaii into the Union", approved March 18, 1959 (73 Stat. 4, 6).
        (17) The authority of the Congress under the United States
      Constitution to legislate in matters affecting the aboriginal or
      indigenous peoples of the United States includes the authority to
      legislate in matters affecting the native peoples of Alaska and
      Hawaii.
        (18) In furtherance of the trust responsibility for the
      betterment of the conditions of Native Hawaiians, the United
      States has established a program for the provision of
      comprehensive health promotion and disease prevention services to
      maintain and improve the health status of the Hawaiian people.
        (19) This historical and unique legal relationship has been
      consistently recognized and affirmed by the Congress through the
      enactment of Federal laws which extend to the Hawaiian people the
      same rights and privileges accorded to American Indian, Alaska
      Native, Eskimo, and Aleut communities, including the Native
      American Programs Act of 1974 [42 U.S.C. 2991 et seq.]; the
      American Indian Religious Freedom Act [42 U.S.C. 1996, 1996a];
      the National Museum of the American Indian Act [20 U.S.C. 80q et
      seq.]; and the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation
      Act [25 U.S.C. 3001 et seq.].
        (20) The United States has also recognized and reaffirmed the
      trust relationship to the Hawaiian people through legislation
      which authorizes the provision of services to Native Hawaiians,
      specifically, the Older Americans Act of 1965 [42 U.S.C. 3001 et
      seq.], the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of
      Rights Act Amendments of 1987, the Veterans' Benefits and
      Services Act of 1988, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 [29 U.S.C.
      701 et seq.], the Native Hawaiian Health Care Act of 1988, the
      Health Professions Reauthorization Act of 1988, the Nursing
      Shortage Reduction and Education Extension Act of 1988, the
      Handicapped Programs Technical Amendments Act of 1988, the Indian
      Health Care Amendments of 1988, and the Disadvantaged Minority
      Health Improvement Act of 1990.
        (21) The United States has also affirmed the historical and
      unique legal relationship to the Hawaiian people by authorizing
      the provision of services to Native Hawaiians to address problems
      of alcohol and drug abuse under the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986.
        (22) Despite such services, the unmet health needs of the
      Native Hawaiian people are severe and the health status of Native
      Hawaiians continues to be far below that of the general
      population of the United States.
