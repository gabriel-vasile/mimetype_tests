I. INTRODUCTION
1. In this Order, we address the petitions filed by AT&T Inc. on behalf of certain of its legacy 
SBC affiliates (Legacy AT&T) and BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc. (Legacy BellSouth) (jointly, 
“AT&T”)1 requesting that the Commission forbear, pursuant to section 10 of the Communications Act of

1934, as amended (Act), from applying its “cost assignment” rules to AT&T.2 For the reasons set forth 
below, we grant both petitions, subject to conditions.3 We find that AT&T has demonstrated that the 
forbearance petitions meet the statutory criteria for forbearance.
II. BACKGROUND
2. Initially, incumbent local telephone companies were monopolies subject to rate-of-return rate 
regulation at both the federal and state levels.  Under rate-of-return regulation, rates were targeted to 
levels that allowed carriers to recover their costs and earn a specific return on their regulated investment.4  
Because the same local network facilities were used to provide both interstate and intrastate services, as 
well as both regulated and nonregulated services, however, the Commission developed the rules described 
below, to standardize rate-of-return rate regulation.  Specifically, the Commission created rules to assign 
or allocate the common costs to build and maintain the network, and the revenues derived from the array 
(Continued from previous page)    
(collectively, AT&T Petitions).  AT&T filed an erratum to correct the captions of the AT&T Petition and the 
BellSouth Petition.  See AT&T Erratum, WC Docket No. 07-21, at 2 (filed Feb. 16, 2007).  On December 6, 2005, 
Legacy BellSouth filed a petition seeking forbearance from the Commission’s cost assignment rules.  See Petition of 
BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc. For Forbearance Under 47 U.S.C. § 160 From Enforcement of Certain of the 
Commission’s Cost Assignment Rules, WC Docket No. 05-342 (filed Dec. 6, 2005).  While Legacy BellSouth’s 
petition was pending, Legacy AT&T acquired Legacy BellSouth.  See AT&T Inc. and BellSouth Corporation 
Application for Transfer of Control, WC Docket No. 06-74, Memorandum Opinion and Order, 22 FCC Rcd 5662 
(2007) (AT&T/BellSouth Order); Order on Recon., 22 FCC Rcd 6285 (2007).  On February 9, 2007, AT&T Inc., on 
behalf of Legacy BellSouth, withdrew the original Legacy BellSouth petition and simultaneously resubmitted it with 
a request to synchronize the pleading cycle with the AT&T Petition.  See Letter from Theodore Marcus, Senior 
Attorney, AT&T Services, Inc., to Marlene H. Dortch, Secretary, FCC, WC Docket No. 05-342, at 2 (filed Feb. 9, 
2007).  The Commission granted that request and incorporated the record from WC Docket No. 05-342 into WC 
Docket No. 07-21.  See Pleading Cycle Established for AT&T Inc. Petition for Forbearance from the Commission’s 
Cost Assignment Rules, WC Docket No. 07-21, Public Notice, 22 FCC Rcd 3332 (2007) (Public Notice); Appendix 
(appending a list of commenters).  All pleadings cited are filed in WC Docket No. 07-21 unless otherwise noted.
2 AT&T requests that the Commission forbear from section 220(a)(2) of the Act (to a limited extent) and various 
rules, including the following:  section 32.23 (nonregulated activities); section 32.27 (transactions with affiliates); 
Part 64, Subpart I (allocation of costs); Part 36 (jurisdictional separations procedures); Part 69, Subparts D and E 
(cost apportionment); and other related rules that are derivatives of, or dependent on, the foregoing rules.  See, e.g., 
47 C.F.R. §§ 32.23, 32.27, Part 64 Subpart I, Part 36, Part 69 Subparts D and E.  Attachment 1 of the AT&T Petition 
lists each rule from which Legacy AT&T seeks forbearance.  See AT&T Petition, Attach. 1.  The affiliates for which 
Legacy AT&T seeks forbearance relief are listed in the AT&T Petition.  See AT&T Petition at 1 n.1.  Legacy 
BellSouth seeks forbearance from the same rules.  See BellSouth Petition, App. 1 (listing each rule from which 
Legacy BellSouth seeks forbearance).  We refer to the statutory provision and Commission rules from which AT&T 
seeks forbearance collectively as the “Cost Assignment Rules.”
3 On January 7, 2008, the Wireline Competition Bureau (Bureau) extended by 90 days, to April 24, 2008, the date by 
which the AT&T Petition shall be deemed granted in the absence of a Commission decision.  The Bureau extended 
by 90 days, to May 9, 2008, the date by which the BellSouth Petition shall be deemed granted in the absence of a 
Commission decision.  See Petition of AT&T Inc. For Forbearance Under 47 U.S.C. § 160 From Enforcement of

of services offered over the network, by type of cost, type of service (regulated or nonregulated), 
jurisdiction (intrastate or interstate), and service categories.5
3. To record company investment, expense, cost, and revenue for rate-of-return rate regulation, 
the Commission adopted a Uniform System of Accounts (USOA).6 Currently embodied in Part 32 of the 
Commission’s rules, the USOA is a financial accounting system that discloses the results of operational 
and financial events in a manner that enables both the companies’ management and regulatory agencies to 
assess these results.7 First, the USOA sets forth a standardized chart of accounts and thereby directs 
companies how to record certain transactions in their books of account.  Second, the USOA establishes 
rules for carriers’ affiliate transactions.  Third, the USOA specifies accounting treatment for depreciation 
expenses.  Finally, the USOA requires carriers to maintain property records of all telecommunications 
plant in service.
4. Additionally, for companies to determine how to jurisdictionally separate their investment, 
expense, taxes, resources, operating revenues, and other income for accounting purposes, the Commission 
adopted jurisdictional separations rules.  Separations procedures were performed by incumbent local 
exchange carriers (LECs) since the Supreme Court’s 1930 holding that the “separation of intrastate and 
interstate property, revenues and expenses” is “essential to the appropriate recognition of the competent 
governmental authority in each field of regulation.”8 In 1947, the Commission created what is now 
known as the “NARUC-FCC Separations Manual,” which was a result of cooperative efforts and studies 
undertaken by the industry, state regulatory agencies through the National Association of Regulatory 
Utility Commissioners (NARUC), and the Commission beginning in 1941.9 After working with the states 
on separations guidelines for a number of years, the Commission ultimately adopted a set of legally 
binding separations procedures in 1969 that are now set forth in Part 36 of the Commission’s rules.10  
5. Further, in 1983, shortly before the AT&T divestiture, the Commission adopted Part 69 to 
govern how incumbent LECs calculate their access charge rates.11 These rules help to ensure that 
incumbent LECs’ access charges are just and reasonable, consistent with section 201 of the Act, and not 
unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory, consistent with section 202 of the Act.12 For example, the Part 
69 rules establish the rate structure for access charges to be paid by interexchange carriers to LECs for the

goal of just and reasonable rates.  See Joint Cost Order, 2 FCC Rcd at 1299, para. 1.

origination and termination of long distance calls, as well as the access charges to be paid directly by end 
users.  These rate structure rules establish the access charge rate elements as well as the nature of the 
charges, such as whether they are assessed on a per-minute or a flat-rate basis.  
6. As a result of the Commission subsequently permitting post-divestiture AT&T and the 
regional Bell operating companies (BOCs) to offer “enhanced” or “information” services, which were 
treated as “nonregulated,” the Commission addressed concerns of cost shifting.  As telecommunications 
technology advanced, and as new technology was ubiquitously deployed, the Commission became 
concerned with the opportunities for carriers with market power to subsidize the development of new 
technologies with increased rates for noncompetitive services.13 To address these concerns, the 
Commission adopted Part 64 to help ensure, among other things, that carriers could not impermissibly 
“impos[e] on ratepayers for regulated interstate services the costs and risks of nonregulated ventures.”14  
7. Together, these Commission rules establish a rational four-step process for recording and 
allocating incumbent LECs’ costs and revenues associated with their regulated and nonregulated 
activities.15 First, carriers record their costs, including investments and expenses, into various accounts in 
accordance with the USOA prescribed by Part 32 of the Commission’s rules.16 Second, carriers directly 
assign, or allocate if direct assignment is not possible, the costs and revenues associated with their 
regulated and nonregulated activities using the rules established by the Commission in Part 64 of its 
rules.17 Third, interstate and intrastate costs and revenues are separated as provided in Part 36 of the 
Commission’s rules.18 Finally, the access charge rules in Part 69 require carriers to separate regulated 
interstate costs into interexchange costs and access costs, and then apportion the latter among the 
enumerated access elements.19  
8. In 1991, in response to the concern that rate-of-return regulation had eliminated carriers’ 
incentives to reduce costs and improve efficiency, the Commission implemented price cap regulation.20  
Price cap regulation is incentive-based regulation that focuses on the prices that a carrier may charge and 
the revenues it may generate from interstate access services.21 Price cap regulation was a means for the

savings achieved through the integrated provision of regulated and nonregulated activities”).  
15 See id. at 1301, para. 15; see also id. at 1303, para. 37 (“We reaffirm that protecting ratepayers from unjust and

activities, just as it is the purpose behind all of our accounting and cost allocation rules.”).

Commission to encourage regulated markets to produce results similar to highly competitive unregulated 
markets and as such ensure that consumers benefit from carriers’ cost efficiencies.22 As the Commission 
has explained, “price cap regulation severs the direct link between regulated costs and prices.”23 Price cap 
regulation was designed to encourage carriers “to improve their efficiency by harnessing profit-making 
incentives to reduce costs, invest efficiently in new plant and facilities, and develop and deploy 
innovative service offerings, while setting price ceilings at reasonable levels.”24 Pursuant to Part 61 of the 
Commission’s rules, price cap indices, or ceilings, are designed to provide price cap carriers some pricing 
flexibility while ensuring that interstate rates remain just and reasonable.25  
9. Since the adoption of price cap regulation, many carriers, including AT&T, have moved from 
rate-of-return rate regulation to price cap regulation, and the Commission has modified its regulation of 
price cap carriers over time to reflect changing circumstances.  According to AT&T, both its interstate 
and intrastate rates are now regulated under price cap regulation, if at all.26 However, price cap regulation 
always was intended to act “as a transitional regulatory scheme until the advent of actual competition 
makes price cap regulation unnecessary.”27
III. DISCUSSION
10. In this Order, we grant AT&T’s petitions for forbearance, subject to conditions, because we 
find that AT&T, as a price cap carrier generally not subject to rate-of-return regulation, has demonstrated 
that forbearance from enforcing the Cost Assignment Rules satisfies the standard for forbearance under 
section 10 of the Act.  AT&T is a price cap carrier seeking forbearance from the Cost Assignment Rules, 
which were developed at a time when the LECs’ interstate rates and many of their intrastate rates were set 
under rate-based, cost-of-service regulation.  An integral part of the “pro-competitive, de-regulatory 
national policy framework”28 established in the Act is the requirement, set forth in section 10, that the 
Commission forbear from applying any provision of the Act, or any of the Commission’s regulations, if 
the Commission makes certain findings with respect to such provisions or regulations.29 Specifically, the

Commission is required to forbear from any statutory provision or regulation if it determines that 
(1) enforcement of the regulation is not necessary to ensure that charges and practices are just, reasonable, 
and not unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory; (2) enforcement of the regulation is not necessary to 
protect consumers; and (3) forbearance is consistent with the public interest.30 In making such 
determinations, the Commission also must consider pursuant to section 10(b) “whether forbearance from 
enforcing the provision or regulation will promote competitive market conditions.”31  
11. For the reasons explained below, we find that AT&T’s request satisfies the three forbearance 
criteria with regard to the Cost Assignment Rules to the extent that AT&T complies with the conditions 
we set forth.  Specifically, we conclude that there is no current, federal need for the Cost Assignment 
Rules, as they apply to AT&T, to ensure that charges and practices are just, reasonable, and not unjustly 
or unreasonably discriminatory; to protect consumers; and to ensure the public interest.  Although we find 
in this Order that AT&T has demonstrated that forbearance from the Cost Assignment Rules satisfies the 
three-prong test under section 10, we conclude that this test is only satisfied to the extent that AT&T 
complies with conditions we impose here.  Because we cannot conclude here that the Commission will 
never have any need for accounting data from AT&T in the future, we condition this forbearance on, 
among other things, the provision by AT&T of accounting data on request by the Commission for 
regulatory purposes, consistent with the Commission’s statutory authority and AT&T’s commitment in 
this proceeding.  These conditions mitigate factors that would otherwise lead us to conclude that these 
rules remain necessary to ensure that charges and practices are just, reasonable, and not unjustly or 
unreasonably discriminatory; to protect consumers; and to ensure the public interest.  LECs similarly 
situated to AT&T are free to seek comparable forbearance relief.
12. Scope. In this Order, we grant forbearance, subject to conditions, from the statutory 
provision and Commission rules as requested in the Legacy AT&T and Legacy BellSouth petitions 
(collectively, “Cost Assignment Rules”).32 Specifically, AT&T seeks limited forbearance from section 
220(a)(2) of the Act to the extent that this provision contemplates separate accounting of nonregulated 
costs.33  AT&T also seeks forbearance from various Commission rules including the following:  section 
32.23 (nonregulated activities); section 32.27 (transactions with affiliates); Part 64 Subpart I, including 
the requirement to file Cost Allocation Manuals (CAMs)34 (allocation of costs); Part 36 (jurisdictional 
separations procedures); Part 69, Subparts D and E (cost apportionment); and other related rules that are 
derivative of or dependent on the foregoing rules.35 Finally, AT&T seeks forbearance from four of the

32 The State Members ask us to clarify the scope of relief granted here with regard to the covered affiliates.  See
State Members Comments at 13.  Specifically, the State Members note that, in the AT&T Petition, AT&T Inc. 
requested relief “on behalf of certain of its legacy SBC affiliates,” which are listed by name in the petition.  Id.
(citing AT&T Petition at 1 & n.1).  The Bureau released a public notice seeking comment on the AT&T Petitions.  
The Public Notice characterized the request as filed by AT&T Inc. “on behalf of itself and its affiliates.”  Public 
Notice at 1.  It was not our intention to expand the scope of this proceeding beyond that requested by AT&T.  Thus, 
we clarify that the scope of relief granted here is limited to the affiliates described by AT&T in the AT&T Petitions.

35 See, e.g., 47 C.F.R. §§ 32.23, 32.27, Part 64 Subpart I, Part 36, Part 69 Subparts D and E.  Attachment 1 of the 
AT&T Petition lists each rule from which Legacy AT&T seeks forbearance.  See AT&T Petition, Attach. 1.  Legacy 
BellSouth seeks forbearance from the same rules.  See BellSouth Petition, App. 1 (listing each rule from which 
Legacy BellSouth seeks forbearance).

Commission’s reporting requirements – the Access Report (ARMIS 43-04), the Rate of Return 
Monitoring Report (FCC Form 492), the Reg/Non-Reg Forecast Report (FCC Form 495A) and the 
Reg/Non-Reg Actual Usage Report (FCC Form 495B) – because forbearance from the Cost Assignment 
Rules renders these reports meaningless.36 To be clear, AT&T generally does not seek, and we do not 
grant, forbearance from the Part 32 USOA.37  Although AT&T seeks relief from section 220(a)(2) and a 
significant number of rules, we consider the Cost Assignment Rules together as a group under the 
statutory forbearance criteria because, as the Commission has concluded, the various accounting rules 
were intended to work together to help ensure the primary statutory goal of just and reasonable rates.38 In 
addition, AT&T has represented that both petitions seek substantively identical relief for the Legacy 
AT&T and Legacy BellSouth affiliates.39 To the extent that there could be any inconsistency between the 
petitions, it is our intention to grant the same relief for both petitions, and we expect uniform 
implementation across all of the AT&T affiliates subject to this relief, whether Legacy AT&T or Legacy 
BellSouth affiliates.  
13. Rulemaking. The State Members of the Federal-State Joint Board on Separations (State 
Members) oppose the AT&T Petitions and urge us to allow the Federal-State Joint Board on Separations 
(Joint Board) “to continue its current efforts and not be effectively preempted by piecemeal forbearance 
decisions that would overthrow existing separations procedures . . . .”40 The State Members argue that 
  
36 See AT&T Petition at 38 n.83.  We note that AT&T requests forbearance from section 43.21(f) of the 
Commission’s rules.  See AT&T Petition at 1-2 n.2, Attach. 1 at 86.  Rule 43.21(f) is implemented by requiring the 
filing of ARMIS Report 43-01.  In the text of its petition, however, Legacy AT&T neither mentioned its obligation 
to file this report in its request for relief, nor expressly analyzed why such relief might be warranted.  See AT&T 
Petition at 38 n.83, Attach. 6 at 1.  We also note that in a separate petition seeking forbearance from certain ARMIS 
filing requirements, AT&T characterized the relief it requests through its cost assignment forbearance petition at 
issue here as including the ARMIS Report 43-03 reporting requirements.  See Petition of AT&T Inc. for 
Forbearance Under 47 U.S.C. § 160(c) from Enforcement of Certain of the Commission’s ARMIS Reporting 
Requirements, WC Docket No. 07-139, at 1 n.2 (filed June 8, 2007).  In fact, the obligation to file ARMIS Report 
43-03 is not included in the relief AT&T requests in this proceeding.  See AT&T Petition at 38 n.83, Attach. 6 at 1.  
To be clear, we do not grant forbearance from these reporting requirements – ARMIS Reports 43-01 and 43-03 – in 
this Order, except to the extent that AT&T will no longer generate certain underlying data by virtue of the 
forbearance from the Cost Assignment Rules granted in this Order. We note that AT&T otherwise still will have the 
data and information necessary for those ARMIS reports.

“even if the current petition is denied, AT&T would not be without relief for long” because reform will be 
necessary before the separations freeze ends in 2009.41 Although we recognize the value that the Joint 
Board adds to our deliberation of these issues, section 10 does not allow us the leeway to choose our 
procedural vehicle and the timing of resolution outside the limitations of section 10.42 Section 10 
provides that the Commission shall forbear from applying any regulation or provision of the Act if it finds 
that the three-prong forbearance test is satisfied.43 Notably, section 10(c) provides that “[a]ny 
[forbearance] petition shall be deemed granted” if the Commission does not “deny” it “for failure to meet 
the requirements for forbearance” within one year of receiving it (plus 90 days if the Commission extends 
the statutory period).44 As the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. 
Circuit) has concluded, “an alternative route for seeking [relief] does not diminish the Commission’s 
responsibility to fully consider petitions under [section] 10.”45 “The Commission has no authority to 
sweep [section 10] away by mere reference to another, very different, regulatory mechanism.”46 Thus, by 
the terms of the statute, we may not adopt the approach advocated by the State Members to deny these 
petitions in favor of referral to the Joint Board with presumably a rulemaking to follow, concluded well 
beyond the statutory deadline imposed by section 10.  We are obligated to proceed with these petitions 
under the legal standard and the timeline established by Congress in section 10 of the Act.
14. Statutory backdrop. Following forbearance, AT&T will remain subject to a number of 
statutory safeguards that are important components of the regulatory framework that ensure that AT&T’s 
rates and practices are just, reasonable and not unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory, as required by

section 10.  In particular, AT&T will remain subject to section 251 obligations;47 section 271 obligations, 
including the obligation to continue to comply with the market-opening requirements that AT&T had to 
meet in order to receive authority to provide in-region, interLATA services;48 and the continuing general 
obligation to provide service on just, reasonable, and not unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory rates, 
terms, and conditions pursuant to sections 201 and 202 of the Act.49 Most significantly, AT&T will 
remain subject to dominant carrier regulation of its interstate exchange access services, including price 
cap regulation of most exchange access services.50
A. Charges, Practices, Classifications and Regulations
15. Section 10(a)(1) requires us to determine whether application of the Cost Assignment Rules 
is “necessary to ensure that the charges, practices, classifications or regulations by, for, or in connection 
with that telecommunications carrier or telecommunications service are just and reasonable and are not 
unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory.”51 We find that AT&T demonstrates that forbearance from the 
Cost Assignment Rules, subject to conditions, satisfies this criterion.  
  
47 47 U.S.C. § 251.  AT&T will remain subject to unbundling obligations pursuant to section 251(c)(3), which, as 
the Commission has found previously, provides “a check on special access pricing.”  Unbundled Access to Network

49 47 U.S.C. §§ 201, 202.  Under section 202(a) of the Act, AT&T will remain obligated to provide any of its special 
access services that its competitors rely on as inputs for the competitors’ own interLATA telecommunications 
service offerings on rates, terms, and conditions that are not unreasonably discriminatory.  47 U.S.C. § 202(a).  Ad 
Hoc appears to argue that the three-prong test cannot be satisfied for forbearance from section 201(b) of the Act.  
See Ad Hoc Comments at 9-11.  AT&T does not seek, nor do we grant, forbearance from section 201(b).

terms or conditions for TIPToP must be filed on 15-days notice with cost support. Thus, the Bureau would continue 
to maintain significant regulatory oversight over TIPToP, and importantly, more regulatory oversight than over most 
services subject to price cap regulation.” AT&T Reply Comments, WCB Pricing File No. 07-08, at 2-3 (filed April

16. Interstate rates. Because its interstate rates are now generally regulated under price caps, we 
agree with AT&T that the Cost Assignment Rules are unnecessary in determining whether its rates are 
just, reasonable, and not unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory.52 AT&T argues in its petitions that 
technological advances have made the Cost Assignment Rules antiquated and unnecessary.  Legacy 
BellSouth asserts that, as consumers demand new and innovative products, their competitors are able to 
quickly bring to market new product offerings because they are not subject to Cost Assignment Rules, 
while AT&T must “try to shoehorn compliance with cost assignment rules designed for an analog, single 
purpose, circuit switched network.”53 As such, AT&T contends that “the Commission’s cost assignment 
rules no longer serve any useful purpose.”54 Specifically, AT&T argues that because its rates are not 
based on costs under price cap regulation, the Commission has no use for the information provided by the 
Cost Assignment Rules and, thus, the continued burden of providing this information is not justified.55
17. The Commission has articulated the goals of its accounting rules as “protecting ratepayers 
from unjust and unreasonable interstate rates,” and “ensur[ing] that ratepayers share in any savings 
achieved through the integrated provision of regulated and nonregulated activities.”56 The Cost 
Assignment Rules were developed in a time when the incumbent LECs’ interstate rates and many of their 
intrastate rates were set under rate-based, cost-of-service regulation.  The rules therefore are quite 
detailed, designed to parallel the level of detail in the cost-of-service calculations that LECs performed to 
develop their rates for interstate access services.57 Although not required to do so, many state 
commissions followed these rules for intrastate ratemaking purposes.58 Since that time, however, our 
ratemaking methods and those of our state counterparts have evolved considerably.59 As the Commission 
has recognized, this evolution has greatly reduced incumbent LECs’ incentives to overstate the costs of 
their tariffed telecommunications services.60 As the Commission has explained, “[B]ecause price cap 
regulation severs the direct link between regulated costs and prices, a carrier is not able automatically to 
recoup misallocated non-regulated costs by raising basic service rates, thus reducing the incentive for the 
BOCs to shift non-regulated costs to regulated services.”61

18. To the extent incentives remain, following forbearance, price cap regulation of AT&T’s rates 
will remain in place to continue to protect consumers from unjust, unreasonable, and unjustly or 
unreasonably discriminatory charges, practices, classification and regulations.62 We agree with AT&T 
and commenters that flourishing competition increasingly constrains prices.63 We do not agree that 
current market conditions eliminate all need for rate regulation and possible future need for cost data.64  
Price cap regulation of AT&T’s rates will continue.  Therefore, we reject the notion of opposing 
commenters that by granting forbearance on the petitions before us, we are effectively deregulating 
interstate access service rates.65  
19. Certain commenters contend that we must maintain the Cost Assignment Rules because 
accounting data derived from the Cost Assignment Rules would be needed for various functions even 
under price cap regulation, such as reinitializing price caps, reviewing exogenous adjustments, and setting 
the X-factor.66 We agree with AT&T that the Commission’s need for cost data for the purposes of price 
caps has been significantly decreased with the adoption of various reforms that eliminated features of the

original price cap regime that required rate-of-return regulation accounting inputs.  For example, in 1997, 
the Commission eliminated the requirement that price cap LECs “share,” or return to ratepayers, earnings 
above specified levels.67 Similarly, the low-end adjustment mechanism is no longer generally applicable 
to AT&T as a result of its obtaining pricing flexibility relief.68 Indeed, in the Pricing Flexibility Order, 
the Commission anticipated that its reforms “might enable the Commission to relax, for that LEC, any 
accounting rules necessitated only by the rate-of-return-based low-end adjustment mechanism.”69  
Moreover, the Commission’s price caps do not currently include a productivity factor, since the CALLS 
Order set the X-factor at the rate of inflation rather than at a rate to approximate productivity gains in 
LEC operations.70 Because these changes have eliminated ongoing tinkering with price caps, we no 
longer routinely need the accounting data derived from the Cost Assignment Rules for rate regulation 
functions.71 On the other hand, we do not concede, as AT&T urges, that there will never be any federal 
need for accounting information in the future to adjust our existing price cap regime or in our 
consideration of reforms moving forward.72  
20. We do, however, conclude that section 10 does not allow us to find a regulatory requirement 
“necessary to ensure that the charges, practices, classifications or regulations by, for, or in connection

unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory” if it is not a current need.73 As the D.C. Circuit concluded, “In 
the forbearance context, . . . it is reasonable to construe ‘necessary’ as referring to the existence of a 
strong connection between what the agency has done by way of regulation and what the agency 
permissibly sought to achieve with the disputed regulation.”74 Here, we cannot conclude that there is a 
“strong connection” between maintaining the Cost Assignment Rules in anticipation of a possible need 
for the information to modify rate regulation at some point in the future.
21. The Commission, however, will have continuing responsibilities under the Act to ensure that 
rates are just and reasonable, and not unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory, and we need the tools, 
possibly including accounting data, to accomplish our statutory responsibilities.75 We can only reach our 
conclusion that the three-prong forbearance test is satisfied because we impose conditions that mitigate 
factors that would otherwise lead us to conclude that the Cost Assignment Rules remain necessary under 
section 10.  We find a “strong connection” between the conditions we impose and our continuing 
responsibilities under the Act.  Even without the Cost Assignment Rules, the Act provides the 
Commission with ample authority – including section 220 – to require AT&T to produce any accounting 
data that the Commission needs for regulatory purposes, including rulemakings or adjudications, in the 
future.76 We also expressly condition the forbearance granted in this Order on the provision by AT&T of 
accounting data on request by the Commission for its use in rulemakings, adjudications or for other 
regulatory purposes.77 To the extent that the Commission requests such data, we require AT&T to 
provide useable information on a timely basis.  As noted above, AT&T generally has not sought relief 
from the Part 32 USOA requirements.  AT&T states, for example, that its petitions will not affect its 
accounting for revenues but only deals with the assignment of costs (expense and investment), and its 
revenue can be identified by jurisdiction through the Part 32 accounts.78 Thus, this USOA account data 
will continue to be maintained and available to the Commission on request.  Further, we require AT&T to 
implement a method of preserving the integrity – for both costs and revenues – of its accounting system 
in the absence of the Cost Assignment Rules to ensure that accounting data requested by the Commission 
in the future will be available and reliable.  As discussed below, we require AT&T to file a compliance 
plan that will, among other things, explain how it will satisfy this condition.  We conclude that this

approach maintains the Commission’s ability to obtain accounting information that may be necessary in 
the future, while providing a less costly and administratively burdensome alternative to AT&T.  
22. Enforcement.  As discussed above, we agree with commenters that accounting information 
could be critical to our efforts to enforce provisions of the Act, including sections 201 and 202.79 Thus, 
we emphasize that our condition that AT&T provide accounting data on request by the Commission for 
use in its proceedings includes requests for accounting data to be used for the purposes of an enforcement 
action against AT&T, either a Commission investigation or a complaint proceeding under section 208.80
Ad Hoc notes that, before the D.C. Circuit, the Commission opposed a petition for writ of mandamus 
related to the special access rules based, in part, on the grounds that complaints under section 208 of the 
Act would be an adequate remedy.81 Ad Hoc asserts that forbearance from the Cost Assignment Rules 
“would put the Commission in an indefensible position” before the court because “[s]uch complaints 
would be impossible if [the] AT&T petition is granted . . . .”82 We disagree.  In this Order, we do not 
grant forbearance from section 208. Complaints under section 208 will remain an important mechanism 
for enforcing the provisions of the Act, including the justness and reasonableness of special access rates.  
Moreover, because we condition forbearance from the Cost Assignment Rules on AT&T’s provision of 
accounting data on request by the Commission, including for the purposes of an enforcement proceeding, 
section 208 complaints will continue to be a viable option for enforcing the provisions of the Act and the 
Commission’s rules.83
23. Different accounting regimes. We realize that our decision here will result in a different 
accounting regime for AT&T than for the other BOCs.84 Although uniform regulatory treatment for 
similarly situated carriers is sometimes preferable, we do not think that is the case here with regard to the 
Cost Assignment Rules.  First, we note that AT&T generally will continue to maintain its USOA accounts 
according to our rules.  Second, uniform cost accounting rules are slow to change and may not adapt to 
the quickly evolving characteristics of competitive markets, particularly where those markets may vary 
from carrier to carrier.  This uniform treatment could impose unnecessary regulatory burdens on carriers, 
which could in turn negatively affect the provision of new services to consumers.  The forbearance we 
grant here, together with the conditions we impose, will provide AT&T flexibility to adapt its accounting 
procedures to changing market conditions in its region, while still ensuring that consumers are protected 
from unjust, unreasonable, and unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory rates.  Further, we note that 
financial accounting generally does not require absolute uniformity.  Specifically, AT&T is subject to 
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) for its financial accounting.  GAAP is “[a] common 
set of accounting concepts, standards, and procedures by which financial statements are prepared.”85 It

does not, however, require uniform accounts among companies so long as the implementation is 
consistent with the principles.  
24. Smith v. Illinois Bell. We agree with Time Warner Telecom86 that Smith v. Illinois Bell, as 
well as the provisions of the Act,87 required jurisdictional separations to allow states and the Commission 
to share their regulatory responsibilities under the dual federal-state regulatory framework established in 
the Act.88 Smith v. Illinois Bell, a pre-1934 case, held that a telephone company must deduct the value of 
property attributable to interstate services before a court can consider a confiscation case claiming 
unconstitutional takings based on low intrastate rates.89 The Court concluded that “separation of intrastate 
and interstate property, revenues and expenses” is “essential to the appropriate recognition of the 
competent governmental authority in each field of regulation.”90 The Court also explained that while the 
carrier and state could not “ignore altogether the actual use to which the property is put,” “the difficulty in 
making an exact apportionment of the property is apparent and extreme nicety is not required, only 
reasonable measures being essential . . . .”91 In the wake of Smith v. Illinois Bell, Congress passed the 
Communications Act of 1934, reserving state authority over intrastate communications and expressly 
authorizing – but not mandating – the Commission to promulgate separations rules.92 In fact, the 
Commission first adopted a set of legally binding separations procedures in 1969, nearly 40 years after 
Smith v. Illinois Bell.93  
25. As discussed above, jurisdictional separations, like other Cost Assignment Rules, have 
reduced significance under price caps because “price cap regulation reduces a BOC’s incentives to 
allocate costs improperly.”94 Indeed, the Commission has acknowledged that statutory, regulatory, and

(WCB Staff Report) (cited in TWTC Comments at 9).  We note that the staff also concluded that Part 36 “merits 
further consideration for possible amendment” and recommended that the Commission “consider . . . whether the 
Part 36 rules are necessary in the public interest.”  WCB Staff Report, 22 FCC Rcd at 2820.  The staff also stated that

market changes since Smith v. Illinois Bell may have eliminated the need for federal separations rules 
generally.95 We need not resolve that issue here.  But for the narrow issue before us, we conclude that 
Smith v. Illinois Bell does not preclude us from finding that forbearance from these rules satisfies the 
three-prong statutory test with regard to AT&T.  We believe that AT&T, working cooperatively with the 
state commissions in its region, can develop methods of separating costs, satisfying any remaining need 
states have for jurisdictional separations information.
26. Section 272 Sunset Order.  We are not persuaded by commenters’ arguments that 
forbearance from the Cost Assignment Rules is in conflict with the Commission’s recent decision in the 
Section 272 Sunset Order.96  In the Section 272 Sunset Order, the Commission modified its regulatory 
framework to provide nondominant treatment for interexchange services provided by BOCs on an 
integrated basis with dominant exchange access services, but continued to treat the costs and revenues of 
such interexchange services as nonregulated for accounting purposes, recognizing that the Commission’s 
cost allocation rules protect against improper cost shifting.97 In that order, the Commission specifically 
recognized that the BOCs and their independent incumbent LEC affiliates remain subject to the 
“Commission’s accounting and cost allocation rules and related reporting requirements.”98  
27. We acknowledge that in that order, we concluded that each BOC, including AT&T, continues 
to have “[e]xclusionary market power within its respective regions by reason of its control over these 
bottleneck access facilities,”99 and we made strong statements about the utility of existing nonstructural 
safeguards for protecting against anticompetitive discrimination and improper cost shifting.100 We do not 
abandon those conclusions here.  We do not, however, believe that the Section 272 Sunset Order

precludes us from our actions in this Order.101 The Section 272 Sunset Order was a rulemaking of general 
applicability in which we discussed existing nonstructural safeguards, including the Cost Assignment 
Rules, as part of the regulatory framework that supported our decision to modify rules related to the 
provision of in-region, interexchange services by the BOCs.  That rulemaking does not preclude us from 
granting forbearance to AT&T, and indeed, we conclude that section 10 compels us to modify the 
framework where, as here, the three-prong statutory standard for forbearance is satisfied for AT&T.  With 
the conditions attached to the forbearance granted here, the forbearance standard is satisfied for AT&T 
and the modified regulatory framework will include sufficient nonstructural safeguards to continue to 
protect against anticompetitive discrimination and improper cost shifting by AT&T.  
28. Section 272(e)(3).  Although we forbear from the Cost Assignment Rules in this Order, 
AT&T must continue to comply with section 272(e)(3) of the Act.  Section 272(e)(3) requires that each 
BOC charge its section 272 separate affiliate, or “impute to itself (if using the access for its provision of 
its own services), an amount for access to its telephone exchange service and exchange access that is no 
less than the amount charged to any unaffiliated interexchange carriers for such service.”102 In the Section 
272 Sunset Order, we concluded that the imputation requirement in section 272(e)(3) of the Act would 
continue to apply and we provided guidance to AT&T, Qwest and Verizon regarding the treatment of 
charges for any access services that their incumbent LEC affiliates provide their in-region, long distance 
operations.103 In that order, we, among other things, directed each BOC to continue to impute to itself its 
highest tariffed rate for access, including access provided over joint-use facilities, in order to ensure the 
BOCs’ continued compliance with their imputation obligations under section 272(e)(3).104 We do not 
forbear from that requirement.  We, however, agree with AT&T that “[t]he maintenance of the elaborate 
and pervasive blanket of regulations at issue in the instant AT&T petitions would constitute a 
substantially overbroad method of ensuring section 272(e) compliance.”105 We cannot justify maintaining 
overbroad Cost Assignment Rules when a more focused approach will ensure that AT&T satisfies the 
regulatory goals of section 272(e)(3).  
29. As discussed below, we require, as a condition of this forbearance, that AT&T file a 
compliance plan, which must include, among other things, a description of its imputation methodology.  
AT&T must demonstrate that its access charge imputation methodologies remain consistent with section 
  
101 See AT&T Dec. 14 Ex Parte Letter at 2; AT&T Apr. 18 Ex Parte Letter at 7; AT&T Apr. 22 Ex Parte Letter at 3;
see also AT&T Reply at 9-10 n.28.
102 47 U.S.C. § 272(e)(3).  Imputation is an accounting and regulatory device that is used in recognizing intra-
company transactions.  In the context of access services, this Commission and state commissions have long 
recognized the potential for LECs to use their control over their local networks to impede competition in services for 
which local network access is a needed input.  Imputation requirements address this concern by requiring the BOC 
to recognize for accounting and other regulatory purposes charges for local network access equal to the amounts that 
an unaffiliated third party would pay for comparable access.  See, e.g., Section 272 Sunset Order, 22 FCC Rcd at 
16489-90, para. 99 n.287 (citing Application of Access Charges to the Origination and Termination of Interstate, 
IntraLATA Services and Corridor Services, Memorandum Opinion and Order, FCC 85-172, 1985 FCC Lexis 3510, 
para. 9 & n.22 (Apr. 12, 1985) (requiring that LECs impute access charges to themselves in calculating their 
interstate, intraLATA toll rates); 1998 Biennial Regulatory Review – Part 61 of the Commission’s Rules and Related 
Tariffing Requirements, CC Docket No. 98-131, Report and Order and First Order on Reconsideration, 14 FCC Rcd 
12293, 12312, para. 53 (1999) (requiring that price cap LECs offering interexchange services impute to themselves 
the same access charges that they impose on interexchange carriers)).

272(e)(3).  In the Section 272 Sunset Order, to facilitate transparency of each carrier’s imputation of in-
region, long distance costs, we required AT&T, Qwest, and Verizon, as a condition of that order, to 
include the imputation charges in their ARMIS filings, accompanied by an explanatory footnote for 
each line item identifying the amount imputed.106 AT&T “will continue to journalize revenue to Account 
5280” as required by section 32.5280(a) of the Commission’s rules.107 AT&T has not, however, sought 
forbearance from the relevant ARMIS reports in the petition before us, and therefore it will continue to 
report its imputation data as required by the Section 272 Sunset Order based on the imputation 
methodology approved in its compliance plan.108 In particular, AT&T’s compliance plan must describe 
how it will account for imputed tariff rates given the grant of the requested forbearance from section 
32.5280(b) and (c) of the Commission’s rules.109
30. Section 254(k). We also reject commenters’ contentions that without the affiliate transaction 
rules, the Commission will be unable to prevent cross-subsidies between competitive and noncompetitive 
services.110 Section 254(k) prohibits a telecommunications carrier from “us[ing] services that are not 
competitive to subsidize services that are subject to competition.”111 Although we forbear from our Cost 
Assignment Rules, including the affiliate transaction rules, we do not forbear from section 254(k) of the 
Act.  We merely find that AT&T has demonstrated that it satisfies the three-prong test for forbearance 
with regard to these particular rules.  AT&T remains subject to section 254(k) itself.  We, therefore, 
condition the forbearance granted here on annual certification by AT&T that it will comply with its 
obligations under section 254(k) in the absence of the Cost Assignment Rules, and will maintain and 
provide any requested cost accounting information necessary to prove such compliance.112 With the 
continuing statutory obligation and this condition in place, we are persuaded that the affiliate transaction 
rules are not needed to help prevent cross-subsidies between competitive and noncompetitive services.
31. Compliance plan. As discussed above, we condition the relief granted in this Order on 
approval of a compliance plan by AT&T describing in detail how it will continue to fulfill its statutory 
and regulatory obligations, including sections 272(e)(3) and 254(k), and the conditions of this Order.  The 
relief granted in this Order will not become effective unless and until AT&T’s plan is approved.  As 
mentioned above, the plan must include proposed procedures to ensure continued compliance with 
sections 272(e)(3) and 254(k) of the Act.  The plan must include a description of AT&T’s imputation 
methodology that demonstrates that its access charge imputation methodologies remain consistent with 
section 272(e)(3) and the Section 272 Sunset Order.  The compliance plan must also include AT&T’s first

annual certification that it will comply with its obligations under section 254(k) in the absence of the Cost 
Assignment Rules and will provide any requested cost accounting information necessary to prove such 
compliance.  Pursuant to section 220 of the Act and as a condition of this Order, we require AT&T to 
include a proposal for how it will maintain its accounting procedures and data in a manner that will allow 
it to provide useable information on a timely basis if requested by the Commission to comply with any of 
the conditions of this relief and its commitment to the Commission.113 Finally, the plan must include an 
explanation of the transition process that AT&T will undertake, including an expected schedule, to 
discontinue compliance with the Cost Assignment Rules and replace them with the procedures outlined in 
its compliance plan upon approval of the plan.  We delegate authority to the Chief of the Wireline 
Competition Bureau (Bureau) to prescribe the administrative requirements of the filing and to approve the 
plan when the Bureau is satisfied that AT&T will implement a method of preserving the integrity of its 
accounting system in the absence of the Cost Assignment Rules.114 This delegation of authority to the 
Bureau is consistent with existing procedures for CAM modifications that allow the Chief of the Bureau 
to suspend any changes for a period not to exceed 180 days and to allow the change to become effective 
or prescribe a different procedure.115  
32. State rates. Commenters disagree on the extent to which states rely on the data produced by 
our Cost Assignment Rules for intrastate rate regulation and other state regulatory purposes.116 For 
example, AT&T asserts that all states in its region regulate AT&T’s rates “under incentive regulation 
(including price cap) plans without regard to the information generated by the Commission’s cost 
assignment rules.”117 In contrast, Sprint Nextel asserts that states rely on this data for ratemaking 
(including under state price cap regulation), determining intrastate universal service support, and setting

need not resolve this factual dispute.  We conclude that we do not have authority under sections 2(a) and 
10 of the Act to maintain federal regulatory requirements that meet the three-prong forbearance test with 
regard to interstate services in order to maintain regulatory burdens that may produce information helpful 
to state commissions for intrastate regulatory purposes solely.119 In the case of the Commission’s Cost 
Assignment Rules, we conclude that these rules as applied to AT&T, a price cap carrier generally not 
subject to rate-of-return regulation, are not routinely needed to ensure that interstate charges and practices 
are just, reasonable, and not unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory.  Thus, because there is no current, 
federal need for the Cost Assignment Rules in these circumstances, and the section 10 criteria otherwise 
are met, we find that it would be beyond our authority to maintain these onerous regulatory requirements 
for AT&T.120
33. We recognize that state commissions may exercise their own state authority to conduct their 
rate and other regulation as permitted under state law.121 We emphasize that we do not in this Order 
preempt any state accounting requirements adopted under state authority.122 We recognize, as the State 
Members point out, that section 10(e) states that “[a] State commission may not continue to apply or 
enforce any provision of this Act that the Commission has determined to forbear from applying” under 
section 10.123 Although states will not have authority to enforce the federal Cost Assignment Rules as 
they apply to AT&T once this relief is effective, we do not read section 10(e) to prevent states from 
adopting similar provisions to the extent that they have authority under state law.124 In the wake of this 
decision, we would expect that any states that may rely on the Cost Assignment Rules and resulting data 
for state regulatory purposes would assert their jurisdiction to obtain the needed information from AT&T.  
34. Moreover, in addition to states’ authority to obtain this information, AT&T has committed to 
work with the state commissions in its in-region territory to address state needs.  As AT&T explained, 
“When a need exists for jurisdictional information for monitoring or other purposes, AT&T can develop 
such information to meet those state-specific requirements without continued compliance with the 
  
119 47 U.S.C. §§ 152(a), 160; see AT&T Petition at 25 n.44; BellSouth Petition at 51 n.77; Ad Hoc Reply at 5 
(“Federal interests, however, exist independent of the States’ interests.”); AT&T Apr. 18 Ex Parte Letter at 8-9; cf. 
Phase 2 Order, 16 FCC Rcd at 19985, para. 207 (“We believe that, if we cannot identify a federal need for a 
regulation, we are not justified in maintaining such a requirement at the federal level.”).
120 As discussed above, we do not conclude here that there will never be any federal need for accounting data from 
AT&T in the future, and thus, we condition this forbearance on, among other things, the provision by AT&T of 
accounting data on request by the Commission for regulatory purposes, consistent with the Commission’s statutory 
authority and AT&T’s commitment in this proceeding.

Commission’s cost assignment rules.”125 In addition, AT&T states that total company cost information 
will remain readily available if needed for valid regulatory purposes.126 Further, AT&T explained that, 
because its petitions affect cost accounting data only, AT&T will continue to provide intrastate revenue 
data to any state commission in its territory as needed.127 Thus, we expect that states will be able to obtain 
from AT&T all cost accounting information needed for state regulatory purposes following our 
forbearance from the Cost Assignment Rules.
35. Finally, we recognize that there is undoubtedly a federal role in intrastate ratemaking for 
UNEs, reciprocal compensation, and resale under section 251.128 Under the framework established by 
section 251, the Commission establishes pricing methodology principles, which are then applied by the 
state commissions.129 Ratemaking for these elements and services remains a state responsibility.  We, 
however, have an interest in ensuring that states can implement the Commission’s methodology to satisfy 
federal responsibilities under section 251.  Thus, we conclude that section 251 requires AT&T to continue 
to provide state commissions, on request, any accounting data that states need to implement our pricing 
methodologies under section 251.  
B. Protection of Consumers
36. Section 10(a)(2) of the Act requires the Commission to determine whether continued 
enforcement of the Cost Assignment Rules is necessary to protect consumers.130 For the reasons 
discussed above, consumers are protected from unjust, unreasonable, unjustly or unreasonably 
discriminatory interstate rates charged by AT&T through continued rate regulation in the form of price 
caps.  Because we find that there is no current, federal need for the Cost Assignment Rules under the 
conditions set forth in this Order, we conclude, as discussed in more detail below, that the Cost 
Assignment Rules, in this case, impose costs that outweigh their benefits.131 We believe that these costs 
likely distort the market for telecommunications services by diverting AT&T resources that would 
otherwise be directed to “positive activities that generate consumer benefit.”132 We agree with Legacy 
BellSouth that the Cost Assignment Rules could negatively affect “innovation, efficiency and 
competitiveness” of services provided to consumers.133 Thus, rather than being necessary for the 
protection of consumers, we conclude that the Cost Assignment Rules could hinder consumer welfare, 
and we find that the second prong of the section 10 forbearance test is satisfied.
37. Universal service impact.  We also conclude that consumers will not be harmed by any 
negative impact on the Universal Service Fund resulting from the forbearance we grant in this Order.  We

do not agree with commenters that contend that we must retain the Cost Assignment Rules for AT&T 
because embedded cost inputs are needed for the non-rural high-cost support model.134 Although the 
high-cost model initially required some historical cost data, those data are not needed on an ongoing 
basis.135 Moreover, AT&T’s Class A account data used for universal service purposes will remain 
available.136 As discussed above, we expressly condition the forbearance granted in this Order on the 
provision by AT&T of accounting data on request, and therefore, the Commission will continue to have 
access to any accounting data it may need for developing non-rural universal service policy going 
forward.137 As commenters note,138 section 254(k) provides that:
[t]he Commission, with respect to interstate services, and the States, with respect to 
intrastate services, shall establish any necessary cost allocation rules, accounting 
safeguards, and guidelines to ensure that services included in the definition of universal 
service bear no more than a reasonable share of the joint and common costs of facilities 
used to provide those services.139
As mentioned above, AT&T will remain subject to section 254(k) following forbearance from the Cost 
Assignment Rules, and its compliance plan, filed as a condition of this relief, will include a certification 
that it will comply with its obligations under section 254(k) and will provide any requested cost 
accounting information necessary to prove such compliance.  We also reject Sprint Nextel’s argument 
that AT&T’s cost data are needed to set high-cost loop support levels for rural carriers.140 Because AT&T 
does not receive high-cost loop support and the National Exchange Carrier Association (NECA) is not 
using AT&T’s cost data to calculate the national average unseparated loop cost for purposes of 
calculating rural high-cost loop support,141 AT&T’s cost data are not currently needed for the purposes of 
the rural support mechanism.142  
38. Financial accounting requirements. We agree with AT&T that the Cost Assignment Rules 
are not necessary to protect consumers by ensuring the integrity of AT&T’s financial records through 
financial transparency or accountability.143 GAAP, Securities and Exchange Commission, the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act, and other financial accounting and reporting requirements will be unaffected by our 
forbearance here.  These financial safeguards are critical to protect investors, particularly in the wake of a 
number of high-profile financial accounting scandals, including some in the telecommunications

industry.144 At the same time, price cap regulation of rates and the conditions we adopt here will continue 
to protect consumers, in their role as ratepayers, as required by section 10.145
C. Public Interest
39. Section 10(a)(3) of the Act requires us to determine whether forbearance from the 
Commission’s Cost Assignment Rules is consistent with the public interest.146 In making this 
determination, section 10(b) of the Act directs us to consider whether forbearance from enforcing the 
provisions at issue will promote competitive market conditions, including the extent to which forbearance 
will enhance competition among providers of telecommunications services.147 If we determine that 
forbearance will in fact promote competition among providers of telecommunications services, that 
determination may be the basis for finding that forbearance is in the public interest.148 We conclude that 
granting AT&T relief here will promote competitive market conditions and enhance competition as 
contemplated by section 10(b) and that forbearance is in the public interest.
40. Costs.  We find that there is sufficient evidence in the record to show that the Cost 
Assignment Rules significantly increase AT&T’s operating costs, and that the elimination of the Cost 
Assignment Rules will likely result in substantial cost savings and enable AT&T to compete more 
effectively.149 The Cost Assignment Rules impose a variety of significant costs, including administrative 
costs on both AT&T and the Commission.150 Despite the costs, the Commission adopted the Cost 
Assignment Rules because it believed at the time that the rules, among other things, were needed to help 
protect consumers from improper cross-subsidization of competitive services when those services are 
provided on an integrated basis with noncompetitive services by dominant providers with individual 
market power.151

41. We now find, however, that when we consider the continuing costs of the Cost Assignment 
Rules for AT&T against protections afforded by price caps, the continuing applicability of USOA, and 
the conditions we impose here, the costs of these rules exceed the likely benefits of maintaining the rules 
for AT&T.  We agree with AT&T that forbearance should allow it to compete more effectively with its 
rivals both by freeing it from unnecessary regulations to which its nondominant competitors are not 
subject and freeing capital for investments.152  
42. First, AT&T asserts that the Cost Assignment Rules negatively affect consumers because, as 
consumers demand new and innovative products, its competitors are able to quickly bring to market new 
product offerings because they are not subject to the Cost Assignment Rules, while AT&T must “try to 
shoehorn compliance with cost assignment rules designed for an analog, single purpose, circuit switched 
network.”153 As Legacy BellSouth explains:
For every new broadband service that it seeks to offer, [BellSouth] must conduct an
exhaustive analysis of every part of the network and the other resources used to provide 
the service to ensure compliance with the Commission’s cost allocation and affiliate 
transaction requirements.  The more technologically involved the product or service 
offering, the more allocation decisions are involved:  some complex services, in fact, can 
require up to 100 separate allocation decisions.154  
For example, according to Legacy BellSouth, new services can be delayed to market by as much as six 
months due to compliance with the Cost Assignment Rules; some never get to market at all.155 Based on 
the record before us, we conclude that these rules hinder AT&T’s ability to expeditiously introduce new 
services, making it a less effective competitor.  Thus, the forbearance we grant here will allow AT&T to 
compete more effectively with its rivals by operating more efficiently – without regulatory obligations 
that no longer produce benefits warranting their costs in terms of competitive advantage in the 
marketplace.
43. Second, we are persuaded that the Cost Assignment Rules require AT&T to direct 
considerable financial and personnel resources “to utilize a complex hierarchy to track, value and record 
affiliate transactions, to allocate costs of regulated and non-regulated services, to maintain, update and 
audit its Cost Allocation Manual, to jurisdictionalize intra and interstate costs and to apportion interstate 
costs to interstate service baskets . . . .”156 For example, Legacy AT&T states that it spends $1.7 million 
per year on an outside auditor just to audit its CAM as required by our rules.157 Overall, Legacy AT&T

157 See AT&T Petition at 15, 38-39; see also AT&T Comments, WC Docket No. 05-342, at 5.  As AT&T points out, 
the Commission has exempted mid-size carriers from performing these independent audits to “significantly lighten 
regulatory burdens.”  AT&T Petition at 15-16 n.21 (citing Phase 2 Order, 16 FCC Rcd at 19980, para. 189). 
Federal Communications Commission FCC 08-120
25
estimates that it spends approximately $7 million annually in employee-related systems and audit costs 
associated with these activities to ensure compliance with these requirements.158
44. For these reasons, we are convinced that forbearance from the Cost Assignment Rules “will 
enhance competition among providers of telecommunications services.”159 At the same time, as discussed 
above, the modification of our regulatory framework applicable to AT&T does not remove all protections 
for consumers or competition.  We find that the Cost Assignment Rules are an overbroad means of 
eliminating the risk of cost misallocation and price discrimination in today’s market.  On the basis of 
these findings, we conclude that the Cost Assignment Rules pose significant adverse consequences – in 
terms of competition and financial costs – that outweigh any potential benefits of enforcing the Cost 
Assignment Rules against AT&T, given the protections afforded to consumers and competition by 
remaining safeguards and conditions.  Thus, we find that the likely savings to AT&T by elimination of 
the rules, in conjunction with AT&T’s compliance with our remaining rules and conditions, including the 
price cap rules, supports a finding that forbearance from the Cost Assignment Rules at this time is in the 
public interest.  
45. Open proceedings.  We are not persuaded by commenters’ arguments that it is consistent 
with the public interest to maintain these burdensome Cost Assignment Rules because the resulting data 
could be useful in pending rulemaking proceedings that broadly consider, among others, universal 
service, intercarrier compensation, special access, or other reform.160 We do not deny that cost accounting 
data could be useful when the Commission moves forward with these and other comprehensive reform 
proposals.  Significant records have already been compiled in these proceedings while this data has been 
readily available.  We also recognize that depending on the approach adopted by the Commission, these 
data may not be relevant to adopted reforms at all.  We believe that the Commission’s possible need for 
this information in a proceeding at some future point is speculative.161 At the same time, we recognize

that as the Commission moves forward with various policy initiatives, it could have a need for this 
information.  As discussed above, we condition the forbearance granted here on AT&T providing 
accounting data as requested by the Commission for future regulatory purposes, including rulemakings or 
adjudications, as AT&T has committed to do in this proceeding.162 Given this condition, we view it as 
inconsistent with the public interest, under section 10, to maintain costly requirements in exchange for 
benefits that are speculative in nature and for uses that do not currently exist, particularly when the 
conditions we adopt ensure that the Commission will have access to the data it needs for policymaking 
purposes going forward.

JOINT STATEMENT OF
COMMISSIONER MICHAEL J. COPPS AND COMMISSIONER JONATHAN S. ADELSTEIN
DISSENTING
Re: Petition of AT&T Inc. For Forbearance Under 47 U.S.C. §160 From Enforcement of Certain of 
the Commission’s Cost Assignment Rules, WC Docket No. 07-21; Petition of BellSouth 
Telecommunications, Inc. For Forbearance Under 47 U.S.C. §160 From Enforcement of Certain 
of the Commission’s Cost Assignment Rules, WC Docket No. 05-342.
The Enron and WorldCom-type accounting scandals earlier this decade are not so far behind us 
that we cannot remember the distress they wrought on the telecommunications industry and on the 
economy as a whole. But if those scandals seem too distant to recall, just open the morning newspaper to 
find lax financial standards and oversight implicated in the housing crisis and economic upheaval that too 
many hard-working Americans face today.  It is in this context that we face the above-referenced 
Petitioners’ requests for forbearance from the Commission’s application of its cost assignment and 
allocation rules.  At this moment, more information—not less—is what is needed to promote competition, 
consumer confidence, investor security and the public interest. Indeed, the Commission has a duty to 
ensure that the required system of accounts provides both state and federal regulators with the information 
they need to discharge their oversight responsibilities. Given the necessity of the rules at issue, now and 
in the future, we dissent from today’s Order based on the Petitioners’ failure to meet the statutory 
requirements set forth in section 10 of the Communications Act.
We disagree for a number of reasons with Petitioners’ contention that the cost assignment rules 
are no longer necessary.  First, the Commission remains under ongoing statutory obligation to ensure that 
telecommunications services are offered on rates, terms and conditions that are just, reasonable and not 
unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory.  The Commission and market participants have repeatedly relied 
on the very cost assignment and allocation data at issue in these petitions to set rules to carry out that 
statutory duty and to monitor the Petitioners’ compliance.  For example, in the 2000 CALLS Order, the 
Commission used this data to set the current price cap rules that are designed to ensure that Petitioners 
provide rates that are just, reasonable and nondiscriminatory.1 More recently, the Commission sought 
comment on a plan to succeed the CALLS Order and specifically asked parties to address how the 
Petitioner’s cost accounting data should guide the Commission’s analysis.2
Second, a unanimous Commission just last year established “a new regulatory framework for the 
BOCs’ in-region, long distance service” and expressly concluded that “an important component of the 
regulatory framework . . . [is] the Commission’s accounting and cost allocation rules and related reporting 
requirements.”3 The Commission in fact relied on the cost assignment and allocation rules to prevent

anticompetitive discrimination and improper cost-shifting.  Despite Petitioners’ promises to continue to 
comply with the statutory obligations of sections 272(e)(3) and 254(k), we fear that today’s Order will 
render largely meaningless the important safeguards adopted less than a year ago.  Such a conclusion is 
particularly surprising when we consider the fact that section 11 of the Act requires the Commission 
every two years (most recently in 2006) to review all of the cost assignment and allocation rules to 
“determine whether any such regulation is no longer necessary in the public interest as the result of 
meaningful economic competition.”4 While the Commission makes adjustments to these rules where 
appropriate, it has not, before today, found a reason for their elimination.
Third, the Commission must still tackle the widely-recognized need for comprehensive inter-
carrier compensation and Universal Service Fund reform.  The elimination of the cost assignment and 
allocation rules is likely to hinder the Commission’s ability to effectively implement such reform no 
matter what policies are adopted, and such a hindrance is likely to result in harm to consumers and the 
public interest.  
Fourth, it is clear from the record that there are many states that rely on this data in the 
performance of their duties.  The Commission’s ambivalence (or worse) towards the critical role of state 
commissions and the Federal-State Joint Board on Separations ignores the statutory responsibility to 
establish a uniform system of accounts and promote a viable federal-state partnership. 
A decision to grant forbearance relief is not one to be taken lightly. Yet, the record is replete with 
comments from consumer advocates, state regulators and Commissions, Members of Congress, rural 
wireline companies, wireless companies, CLECs and telecom end-users all opposed to the elimination of 
the cost assignment rules. These comments should not have been ignored.  While we recognize the need 
to continually examine and improve the Commission’s cost assignment and allocation rules, Petitioners 
have not offered any alternative—other than a “trust us” approach—for ensuring that the public interest is 
protected.  In this instance, we prefer to “trust but verify” and we are unable to conclude that Petitioners 
have met the burden for doing otherwise. 
Finally, while not the basis for our dissent, we again believe it important to note that such 
sweeping revisions to the Commission’s rules are best accomplished through industry-wide rulemakings, 
conducted under the balanced governance of the Administrative Procedures Act, rather than via the 
improvised and piecemeal route of forbearance petitions, unguided by meaningful procedural rules to 
ensure fairness and transparency.  There are currently five related forbearance petitions statutorily due for 
determination by the Commission this year.  While the particular circumstances faced by the industry as a 
whole when it comes to our cost assignment and accounting rules are not before us, today’s decision will 
no doubt impact future decisions.  For a Commission with limited resources and urgent demands, this is 
no way to set sound policy.
The telecommunications industry has not been immune from accounting malfeasance in the past 
and in fact the Petitioners’ in certain instances suffered greatly from it.  So we end where we began—
more transparency and increased accountability to facilitate more effective federal and state oversight 
must be critical parts of any plan to put the country’s economy on a sounder footing.  Now is not the time 
to permit the Petitioners and those that follow them—who all play an enormous role in our economy—to 
shut their books and assume that’s all they need to do.

STATEMENT OF 
COMMISSIONER DEBORAH TAYLOR TATE
Re: Petition of AT&T Inc. For Forbearance Under 47 U.S.C. § 160 From Enforcement of Certain of the 
Commission’s Cost Assignment Rules, WC Docket No. 07-21; Petition of BellSouth Telecommunications, 
Inc. For Forbearance Under 47 U.S.C. § 160 From Enforcement of Certain of the Commission’s Cost 
Assignment Rules, WC Docket No. 05-342, Memorandum Opinion and Order.  
An integral part of the pro-competitive, de-regulatory national policy framework established by Congress 
in the 1996 Act is the section 10 forbearance provision.  The deregulation of record-keeping seems an 
inevitable consequence of today’s increasingly competitive telecommunications marketplace.  Since the 
adoption of price cap regulation in 1991, many carriers, including AT&T, have moved from rate-of-return 
rate regulation to price cap regulation, and the Commission has modified its regulation of price cap 
carriers over time to reflect changing circumstances.  Because AT&T’s rates are now regulated under 
price caps, there is no current federal need for the specific cost assignment rules as they apply to AT&T.  
Even without these outdated rules, the Commission has clear statutory authority to require AT&T to 
produce any accounting data that the Commission needs for regulatory purposes.  Indeed, we expressly 
condition the forbearance granted in this Order on the provision by AT&T of accounting data on request 
by the Commission for use in rulemakings or adjudications, or for other regulatory purposes, such as 
reform of universal service, intercarrier compensation, or special access.  Significantly, AT&T remains 
subject to a number of statutory safeguards - section 251 obligations, section 271 obligations, and section 
201 and 202 obligations - and the other conditions adopted in this Order, subject to the compliance plan.  
I appreciate the broad participation of States in this proceeding and have carefully considered their 
concerns.  Significantly, we do not in this order preempt any State’s authority to obtain any information 
from AT&T for their own regulatory purposes, and AT&T has committed to provide such information.

STATEMENT OF
COMMISSIONER ROBERT M. McDOWELL
Re: Petition of AT&T Inc. For Forbearance Under 47 U.S.C. § 160 From Enforcement of Certain of 
the Commission’s Cost Assignment Rule, WC Docket No. 07-21, Petition of BellSouth 
Telecommunications, Inc. For Forbearance Under 47 U.S.C. § 160 From Enforcement of Certain 
of the Commission’s Cost Assignment Rules, WC Docket No. 05-342, Memorandum Opinion and 
Order
I am supporting AT&T’s request for relief in this forbearance petition.  This request by a price 
cap local exchange carrier to eliminate cost allocation data collection and reporting requirements that 
were adopted in the all-analog, voice-only, rate-of-return regulatory environment of yesteryear appears to 
be just the type of relief Congress designed the forbearance process to address.  Relief is especially
appropriate as telecommunications traffic migrates toward an all-I.P. world.  As we witness this rapid 
technological evolution, cost models are also changing.  Yesterday’s regulations are quickly outliving 
their usefulness.  Given these developments, I look forward to granting comparable relief to similarly-
situated carriers as soon as possible.
Opponents to this petition have argued passionately for preservation of the existing regime 
primarily out of fear that the Commission, and the public at-large, will not have at their disposal the 
proper information necessary to help make sound policy decisions regarding Universal Service reform, 
Intercarrier Compensation reform, Special Access reform, and the Separations Freeze, among others.  
However, no part of today’s Order precludes the Commission - at any time - from compelling AT&T, or 
any other incumbent local exchange carrier, to provide promptly any and all information necessary to 
build a sufficient record for any regulatory purpose.  In the meantime, most of this data has not been used 
by the Commission for several years.  Additionally, for many years neither competitors nor end-users 
have filed complaints that call for the use of such data.  Should they file complaints in the future, the 
Commission can compel production of all relevant data necessary for proper adjudication.  Section 10 
does not allow us to maintain a requirement merely “just in case” it is needed in the future, especially 
when we have at our disposal other means of gathering any data for a specific purpose.
In short, even without these rules, we continue to have sufficiently potent tools to protect 
consumers’ interests.  AT&T has also assured us that it will supply relevant state public utility 
commissions with any information they may request in pursuit of their policy objectives.  Should AT&T 
not live up to this assurance, the Commission has the ability to compel the production of such data at any 
time and for any regulatory purpose.
Accordingly, I find that today’s order granting relief meets the statutory obligations of Section 10 
and, therefore, is in the public interest.
