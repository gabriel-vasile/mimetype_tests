<HEADLINE> FT  15 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Victory for Glaxo on
 asthma drug in US </HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>    By PAUL ABRAHAMS </BYLINE>
<TEXT>

GLAXO, Europe's biggest pharmaceutical group, will continue not to face
gen
eric competition in the US against its second best-selling drug,
Ventolin, f
ollowing a meeting of two Food and Drug Administration advisory
committees y
esterday.
The committees, covering pulmonary and oncology affairs, and gener
ic
products, concluded they could not yet agree a way for generic companies 
to
produce versions of off-patent asthma treatments delivered through inhale
rs.
Although Ventolin is off-patent in the US, there is no method for generi
cs
groups to manufacture a device that delivers the correct dosage into the

lungs.
The two bodies were concerned about both the safety and efficacy of g
eneric
inhaled asthma products. They decided further work was required to cr
eate
the protocols for generic devices to be licensed.
The decision is posit
ive for Glaxo, and Schering-Plough of the US, whose
drug Proventil was also 
being considered.

<HEADLINE> FT  08 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: El Nino 
drought 'appears to be over' </HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>    By REUTER </BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE DROUGHT that has ravaged crops and 
cost hundreds of millions of dollars
in countries across Asia and the South 
Pacific appears to be over,
meteorologists say, reports Reuter from Sydney.

Its cause, the climatic phenomenon known as El Nino, is dissipating with
som
e areas returning to normal weather conditions more quickly than others,
the
y said.
Australia is among the first of the major agricultural producers to 
emerge
from drought in most areas, while in India a return to normal rainfal
l is
expected in the late monsoon.
China's northern provinces are still in t
he grip of drought, however, though
it is unlikely to have much impact on th
e country's international trading
position.
'We're now in the declining phas
e of El Nino, it's global and it has had an
effect since early last year all
 round the planet, particularly in the
tropical regions,' an official at Aus
tralia's National Climate Centre said.
Ocean waters in the central and easte
rn equatorial Pacific, which had warmed
under El Nino were continuing to coo
l quite rapidly, the climate centre
reported.
Australia, whose farm sector w
as ravaged by drought and economic recession,
has already felt the effect of
 the changing conditions. 'Australia tends to
climb out of it earlier than o
thers,' the official said.
Drought conditions still persist in some areas of
 New South Wales and
southern Queensland but local output of grain and sugar
 is forecast to
recover significantly after last year's drought across easte
rn Australia.
The total value of wheat, coarse grains and sugar is forecast 
to rise by
nearly 30 per cent to ADollars 3.14bn (Pounds 1.2bn) in the year 
to the end
of June, 1993, compared with the previous drought-hit year.
In In
dia however, the change is taking longer to come through. 'It is
expected to
 come back to average in the late monsoon season,' Australia's
climate centr
e official said. Erratic rains in India last year caused food
grain output t
o fall to about 171m tonnes in the year to June 30, 1992 from
the previous y
ear's record 176m tonnes.

<HEADLINE> FT  07 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Keeping 
a weather-eye on a troublesome 'child' / A look at the crop problems posed b
y the unpredictable El Nino climate phenomenon </HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>    By BA

<TEXT>
TO CALM anxious grain traders the Chicago Board 
of Trade will offer a
seminar later this month on El Nino, the weather pheno
menon that develops in
the equatorial Pacific every three to five years and 
can cause global
climate upsets. Grain traders are keen to know if they can 
expect this
year's El Nino to disturb the US weather pattern sufficiently to
 make a dent
in crop output.
Although signs of El Nino had been accumulating
 during 1991, only last month
did the the US National Weather Service finall
y conclude publicly that the
phenomenon was a fact.
The symptoms had been sh
owing themselves overseas since last spring - rising
surface temperatures in
 the eastern and central Pacific, drought in the
western Pacific rim from Au
stralia through Indonesia, a weaker Indian
monsoon, dryness in north-eastern
 Brazil, drought in South Africa and
wetness last summer in the Great Basin 
of the US, which runs from Arizona
north to Idaho.
While many of these condi
tions indicate that El Nino is occurring, they do
not reveal its severity. T
he phenomenon generally peaks in the northern
hemisphere's winter. This help
s explain why Peruvian fishermen dubbed the
phenomenon El Nino, which means 
Christ child in Spanish. It arrived about
Christmas time.
Mr Vernon Kousky, 
a research meteorologist with the US weather service, now
assesses the curre
nt El Nino as 'moderate to strong'. While individual
weather events cannot a
lways be directly attributed to El Nino, some signals
are indicative of its 
strength. Warm water in the Pacific is pushing
moisture into the south-weste
rn US, causing, for example, this winter's
floods in Texas, according to Mr 
Art Douglas, chairman of the Creighton
University's Atmospheric Sciences Dep
artment. Along the Gulf of Mexico, from
Texas to Florida, some areas have al
ready had 200 per cent to 1,000 per cent
of their normal rainfall. Temperatu
res in that region are also beginning to
dip below normal. At the same time 
the phenomenon is upsetting the Jet
Stream, keeping extremely cold air far t
o the north and moderating
temperatures in the Midwest.
The Midwest, America
's most important grain area, is seeing temperatures
four or five degrees Fa
hrenheit above normal, said Mr Jon Davis, the
in-house meteorologist for She
arson Lehman's commodities trading arm. The
weather service predicts that mo
re of the same will occur in those regions
until spring and that the usually
 wet north-west is likely to be dryer, as
is the Ohio valley.
But what conce
rns the grain trade more is what, if anything, will happen
during the critic
al planting and growing season for American crops from June
to August.
Unfor
tunately, weather forecasting is not a precise science. Mr Kousky says
that 
El Nino, usually a 12 to 18 month event, has another six to 12 months
to run
. But he points out that there is no consistent relationship between
El Nino
 and the weather pattern beyond the winter-to-spring months.
'Anything can h
appen,' he admits.
Crop Cast, a Maryland-based weather forecasting service t
hat is used by many
US commodity trading houses, says that while El Nino has
 already affected
South American soyabeans, South African maize and Australi
an wheat, it is
hoping to be able to predict potentially damaging crop effec
ts in the US by
looking at the coincidence of the El Nino with two other cli
matological
events, last year's eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Phillippin
es and the
combination of lunar and solar cycles.
These additional factors a
long with El Nino probably mean that a more
extreme weather pattern bleeds o
ver into summer, according to Mr Kevin
Marcus, director of Crop Cast service
s. He says the likelihood of extreme,
hot and dry weather is 100 per cent, b
ut gives only a one in three chance
that this will have a significant impact
 on crops.
The hot, dry weather would have to occur in July or early August 
to reduce
the maize and soyabean crops significantly, that is by more than 1
0 per
cent. But Mr Marcus is uncertain about how the three phenomena will in
teract
since there no established pattern. He is still waiting for more data
 on the
severity of this year's El Nino.
The phenomenon has prompted commodi
ties markets to gyrate in the past. In
1972-73 the El Nino destroyed the Per
uvian fishmeal catch, which then
accounted for some 45 per cent of the world
 trade in protein feed. In
1982-83 it caused a drought in Africa, which help
ed to send cocoa prices up
by nearly 70 per cent over a period of about a ye
ar.

drought 'appears to be over' </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE DROUGHT that has ravaged crops and 
cost hundreds of millions of dollars
in countries across Asia and the South 
Pacific appears to be over,
meteorologists say, reports Reuter from Sydney.

Its cause, the climatic phenomenon known as El Nino, is dissipating with
som
e areas returning to normal weather conditions more quickly than others,
the
y said.
Australia is among the first of the major agricultural producers to 
emerge
from drought in most areas, while in India a return to normal rainfal
l is
expected in the late monsoon.
China's northern provinces are still in t
he grip of drought, however, though
it is unlikely to have much impact on th
e country's international trading
position.
'We're now in the declining phas
e of El Nino, it's global and it has had an
effect since early last year all
 round the planet, particularly in the
tropical regions,' an official at Aus
tralia's National Climate Centre said.
Ocean waters in the central and easte
rn equatorial Pacific, which had warmed
under El Nino were continuing to coo
l quite rapidly, the climate centre
reported.
Australia, whose farm sector w
as ravaged by drought and economic recession,
has already felt the effect of
 the changing conditions. 'Australia tends to
climb out of it earlier than o
thers,' the official said.
Drought conditions still persist in some areas of
 New South Wales and
southern Queensland but local output of grain and sugar
 is forecast to
recover significantly after last year's drought across easte
rn Australia.
The total value of wheat, coarse grains and sugar is forecast 
to rise by
nearly 30 per cent to ADollars 3.14bn (Pounds 1.2bn) in the year 
to the end
of June, 1993, compared with the previous drought-hit year.
In In
dia however, the change is taking longer to come through. 'It is
expected to
 come back to average in the late monsoon season,' Australia's
climate centr
e official said. Erratic rains in India last year caused food
grain output t
o fall to about 171m tonnes in the year to June 30, 1992 from
the previous y
ear's record 176m tonnes.

TO CALM anxious grain traders the Chicago Board 
of Trade will offer a
seminar later this month on El Nino, the weather pheno
menon that develops in
the equatorial Pacific every three to five years and 
can cause global
climate upsets. Grain traders are keen to know if they can 
expect this
year's El Nino to disturb the US weather pattern sufficiently to
 make a dent
in crop output.
Although signs of El Nino had been accumulating
 during 1991, only last month
did the the US National Weather Service finall
y conclude publicly that the
phenomenon was a fact.
The symptoms had been sh
owing themselves overseas since last spring - rising
surface temperatures in
 the eastern and central Pacific, drought in the
western Pacific rim from Au
stralia through Indonesia, a weaker Indian
monsoon, dryness in north-eastern
 Brazil, drought in South Africa and
wetness last summer in the Great Basin 
of the US, which runs from Arizona
north to Idaho.
While many of these condi
tions indicate that El Nino is occurring, they do
not reveal its severity. T
he phenomenon generally peaks in the northern
hemisphere's winter. This help
s explain why Peruvian fishermen dubbed the
phenomenon El Nino, which means 
Christ child in Spanish. It arrived about
Christmas time.
Mr Vernon Kousky, 
a research meteorologist with the US weather service, now
assesses the curre
nt El Nino as 'moderate to strong'. While individual
weather events cannot a
lways be directly attributed to El Nino, some signals
are indicative of its 
strength. Warm water in the Pacific is pushing
moisture into the south-weste
rn US, causing, for example, this winter's
floods in Texas, according to Mr 
Art Douglas, chairman of the Creighton
University's Atmospheric Sciences Dep
artment. Along the Gulf of Mexico, from
Texas to Florida, some areas have al
ready had 200 per cent to 1,000 per cent
of their normal rainfall. Temperatu
res in that region are also beginning to
dip below normal. At the same time 
the phenomenon is upsetting the Jet
Stream, keeping extremely cold air far t
o the north and moderating
temperatures in the Midwest.
The Midwest, America
's most important grain area, is seeing temperatures
four or five degrees Fa
hrenheit above normal, said Mr Jon Davis, the
in-house meteorologist for She
arson Lehman's commodities trading arm. The
weather service predicts that mo
re of the same will occur in those regions
until spring and that the usually
 wet north-west is likely to be dryer, as
is the Ohio valley.
But what conce
rns the grain trade more is what, if anything, will happen
during the critic
al planting and growing season for American crops from June
to August.
Unfor
tunately, weather forecasting is not a precise science. Mr Kousky says
that 
El Nino, usually a 12 to 18 month event, has another six to 12 months
to run
. But he points out that there is no consistent relationship between
El Nino
 and the weather pattern beyond the winter-to-spring months.
'Anything can h
appen,' he admits.
Crop Cast, a Maryland-based weather forecasting service t
hat is used by many
US commodity trading houses, says that while El Nino has
 already affected
South American soyabeans, South African maize and Australi
an wheat, it is
hoping to be able to predict potentially damaging crop effec
ts in the US by
looking at the coincidence of the El Nino with two other cli
matological
events, last year's eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Phillippin
es and the
combination of lunar and solar cycles.

arson Lehman's commodities trading arm. The
weather service predicts that mo
re of the same will occur in those regions
until spring and that the usually
 wet north-west is likely to be dryer, as
is the Ohio valley.
But what conce
rns the grain trade more is what, if anything, will happen
during the critic
al planting and growing season for American crops from June
to August.
Unfor
tunately, weather forecasting is not a precise science. Mr Kousky says
that 
El Nino, usually a 12 to 18 month event, has another six to 12 months
to run
. But he points out that there is no consistent relationship between
El Nino
 and the weather pattern beyond the winter-to-spring months.
'Anything can h
appen,' he admits.
Crop Cast, a Maryland-based weather forecasting service t
hat is used by many
US commodity trading houses, says that while El Nino has
 already affected
South American soyabeans, South African maize and Australi
an wheat, it is
hoping to be able to predict potentially damaging crop effec
ts in the US by
looking at the coincidence of the El Nino with two other cli
matological
events, last year's eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Phillippin
es and the
combination of lunar and solar cycles.
These additional factors a
long with El Nino probably mean that a more
extreme weather pattern bleeds o
ver into summer, according to Mr Kevin
Marcus, director of Crop Cast service
s. He says the likelihood of extreme,
hot and dry weather is 100 per cent, b
ut gives only a one in three chance
that this will have a significant impact
 on crops.
The hot, dry weather would have to occur in July or early August 
to reduce
the maize and soyabean crops significantly, that is by more than 1
0 per
cent. But Mr Marcus is uncertain about how the three phenomena will in
teract
since there no established pattern. He is still waiting for more data
 on the
severity of this year's El Nino.
The phenomenon has prompted commodi
ties markets to gyrate in the past. In
1972-73 the El Nino destroyed the Per
uvian fishmeal catch, which then
accounted for some 45 per cent of the world
 trade in protein feed. In
1982-83 it caused a drought in Africa, which help
ed to send cocoa prices up
by nearly 70 per cent over a period of about a ye
ar.

<HEADLINE> FT  16 NOV 94 / Law of the Sea promises many disputes 
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>    By BRUCE CLARK, Diplomatic Correspondent </BYLINE>
<
TEXT>
The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which enters full
 force
today, seems likely to be treated by coastal states as a rich source 
of
legal and rhetorical arguments to be used against rivals.
This is in spit
e of the fact that the last thing the law's drafters wanted
was to provide d
isputatious countries with extra torpedoes. One of the law's
ostensible purp
oses is to encourage compromises over the exploitation of
maritime resources
, even among countries with unresolved disputes.
Apart from a standoff in th
e Aegean - where Turkey has threatened war if
Greece extends its territorial
 waters to 12 miles - one of the most grave
maritime disputes involves China
 and Vietnam, locked in a war of words over
oil rights in the South China Se
a.
Both China and Vietnam claim to be acting in accordance with the Law of t
he
Sea but their interpretations of the document are miles apart.
Over the l
ast month, China has accused Vietnam of infringing its interests
in internat
ional waters by inviting US and European companies to explore for
oil in the
 Tonkin Gulf.
Vietnam has retorted that it is exercising its legitimate righ
ts in the
economic zone to which it is entitled by the UN convention. It sai
d that
under the terms of that treaty, there were no international waters in
 the
Gulf.
This dialogue of the deaf reflects confusion over the difference 
between
territorial waters - which may be extended, under the UN Law, up to 
12 miles
 -and the 'economic zone' which coastal states are entitled to clai
m,
amounting to either 200 miles or the full extent of their continental she
lf,
whichever is larger.
China and Vietnam are also arguing over resources a
round the Spratly
Islands, a group of reefs and atolls whose other would-be 
owners are Taiwan,
Brunei, Malaysia and the Philippines.
China has awarded a
n exploration contract to the US company Crestone for an
area south-west of 
the Spratlys, while Vietnam has awarded a consortium led
by Mobil a bloc sli
ghtly further to the west. Each state has denounced the
other's contract.
So
vereignty over the Spratlys - and hence control of the surrounding
economic 
zone - is crucial to each side's claim to energy rights, and the
salience of
 this issue is expected to grow as the UN convention enters
force.
However a
 study by a London-based law firm, maintains that the law favours
pragmatic 
joint exploitation accords, even among countries with unresolved
disputes.*

Laying out the common-sense arguments for such accords, it notes that oil
de
posits which straddle two states' economic zones cannot be exploited by
one 
without damaging the other's interests. When one state drills, oil from
the 
rival state's zone is liable to flow across the boundary line as a
result.
A
rticle 83 of the UN convention says that pending final agreement on zones,
c
ountries should 'make every effort to enter into provisional arrangements
of
 a practical nature'.
As an example of such a deal, the study cites the 1989
 accord between
Australia and Indonesia over waters south of Timor.
However,
 such accords are not a panacea. Portugal - still seen by the UN as
legal ad
ministrator of East Timor - has challenged Australia's right to
enter the ac
cord, before the International Court of Justice.
The entry into force of the
 UN Law comes a year after its ratification by
the minimum of 60 states. Ano
ther breakthrough came this summer when
provisions on deep-sea mining - outs
ide the zones of any country - were
amended so as to convince the US, the UK
 and Germany to sign.

Korea for South Korea to fish in waters near the Russian-held Kurile 
Islands
which are claimed by Japan, Stefan Wagstyl reports from Tokyo.
The i
slands, which lie off the northern coast of Japan, were seized by the
Soviet
 Union at the end of the Second World War and have since been the
subject of
 a territorial dispute.
Tokyo hopes the end of the Cold War could lead to se
rious negotiations with
Moscow over the islands. But Russian leaders have ye
t to go beyond
expressing wishes for a peaceful settlement of the dispute.

<HEADLINE> FT  16 NOV 94 / Law of the Sea promises many disputes 
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>    By BRUCE CLARK, Diplomatic Correspondent </BYLINE>
<
TEXT>
The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which enters full
 force
today, seems likely to be treated by coastal states as a rich source 
of
legal and rhetorical arguments to be used against rivals.
This is in spit
e of the fact that the last thing the law's drafters wanted
was to provide d
isputatious countries with extra torpedoes. One of the law's
ostensible purp
oses is to encourage compromises over the exploitation of
maritime resources
, even among countries with unresolved disputes.
Apart from a standoff in th
e Aegean - where Turkey has threatened war if
Greece extends its territorial
 waters to 12 miles - one of the most grave
maritime disputes involves China
 and Vietnam, locked in a war of words over
oil rights in the South China Se
a.
Both China and Vietnam claim to be acting in accordance with the Law of t
he
Sea but their interpretations of the document are miles apart.
Over the l
ast month, China has accused Vietnam of infringing its interests
in internat
ional waters by inviting US and European companies to explore for
oil in the
 Tonkin Gulf.
Vietnam has retorted that it is exercising its legitimate righ
ts in the
economic zone to which it is entitled by the UN convention. It sai
d that
under the terms of that treaty, there were no international waters in
 the
Gulf.
This dialogue of the deaf reflects confusion over the difference 
between
territorial waters - which may be extended, under the UN Law, up to 
12 miles
 -and the 'economic zone' which coastal states are entitled to clai
m,
amounting to either 200 miles or the full extent of their continental she
lf,
whichever is larger.
China and Vietnam are also arguing over resources a
round the Spratly
Islands, a group of reefs and atolls whose other would-be 
owners are Taiwan,
Brunei, Malaysia and the Philippines.
China has awarded a
n exploration contract to the US company Crestone for an
area south-west of 
the Spratlys, while Vietnam has awarded a consortium led
by Mobil a bloc sli
ghtly further to the west. Each state has denounced the
other's contract.
So
vereignty over the Spratlys - and hence control of the surrounding
economic 
zone - is crucial to each side's claim to energy rights, and the
salience of
 this issue is expected to grow as the UN convention enters
force.
However a
 study by a London-based law firm, maintains that the law favours
pragmatic 
joint exploitation accords, even among countries with unresolved
disputes.*

Laying out the common-sense arguments for such accords, it notes that oil
de
posits which straddle two states' economic zones cannot be exploited by
one 
without damaging the other's interests. When one state drills, oil from
the 
rival state's zone is liable to flow across the boundary line as a
result.
A
rticle 83 of the UN convention says that pending final agreement on zones,
c
ountries should 'make every effort to enter into provisional arrangements
of
 a practical nature'.
As an example of such a deal, the study cites the 1989
 accord between
Australia and Indonesia over waters south of Timor.
However,
 such accords are not a panacea. Portugal - still seen by the UN as
legal ad
ministrator of East Timor - has challenged Australia's right to
enter the ac
cord, before the International Court of Justice.
The entry into force of the
 UN Law comes a year after its ratification by
the minimum of 60 states. Ano
ther breakthrough came this summer when
provisions on deep-sea mining - outs
ide the zones of any country - were
amended so as to convince the US, the UK
 and Germany to sign.

Australia doubled in size yesterday, as it formally claimed massive ne
w
offshore territory under an international 'law of the sea' convention. The

1982 United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea, which was finally
rat
ified this year, aims to divide about 35 per cent of the world's oceans
amon
g over 100 countries. In Australia's case it means that the country can
clai
m an exclusive economic zone extending 200 nautical miles from its
baselines
, instead of the traditional 12 miles.
Because of the nation's extensive coa
stline it is now claiming around 5.7m
sq miles of ocean water, of which 4.2m
 sq miles derives from the new
extended nautical limits. As a result, Austra
lia can boast one of the
largest 'exclusive economic zones' in the world.
Wh
ile much of the additional territory is undisputed, there is disagreement
wi
th Indonesia over territory around Christmas Island and off the north
coast 
of Australia, including the resource-rich Timor Gap.

<TEXT>
ARGENTINA has threatened to retaliate against th
e UK's introduction of a new
fishing licence regime in the waters around the
 British-held South Georgia
and South Sandwich islands, which Argentina clai
ms as its own.
Mr Guido di Tella, foreign minister, said: 'Britain will pay 
a very high
price for this joke.' He said Argentina would censure the Britis
h decision
in multilateral conservation bodies covering the Antarctic.
Howev
er, the ministry did not expand on what price Argentina planned to
exact fro
m the UK or how it would do so.
Britain had told Argentina privately that it
 intended to introduce a fishing
regime in the two islands' territorial wate
rs on August 1, but made no
statement on the issue.
Mr Di Tella only announc
ed the British decision on Monday.
London had already extended to 200 miles,
 from 12 miles, the islands'
territorial waters prior to imposing the licenc
e regime, similar to one
introduced in the nearby Falkland Islands seven yea
rs ago.
UK officials said they have already received considerable signs of i
nterest
from fishing companies to take out the new licences, with fees to be
 based
on a percentage of the catch.
Debate in Argentina over the future of 
the Falkland Islands has intensified
in the past 10 days, after it had emerg
ed that the Argentine government was
considering the concession, under its s
overeignty, of a special status for
the islands, similar to Puerto Rico's st
atus as an associate of the US.
This would enable the islands to retain all 
their present rights of
self-determination, the use of sterling as currency,
 and allegiance to the
British crown, while transferring only formal soverei
gnty to Argentina.
However, some Argentine analysts feared that changing the
 nature of
Argentina's claim to the islands was only a prelude to surrenderi
ng it
altogether.

<TEXT

CHINA is planning to set up a special economic zone in Lhasa, the troubled

capital of Tibet, Reuter reports from Beijing.
The zone will imitate those 
operating in China's flourishing coastal
regions, the official China Daily s
aid yesterday.
It quoted Tibet's vice governor Gyamtso as saying lack of ope
n-mindedness
had impeded the region's development in the past.
Tibet has bee
n rocked by sporadic riots since Buddhist monks demonstrated
against Chinese
 rule in late 1987, prompting police to open fire on
protesters.
The region'
s exiled spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, says more than 1m
Tibetans have b
een killed since China took control of his country, now
called the Tibet Aut
onomous Region, in 1950. He said on Monday that
youngsters in the region wer
e becoming impatient with his message of
non-violence.
China Daily said Tibe
t's local government is drawing up preferential
investment policies for the 
Lhasa special economic zone, including tax
breaks and low land-use fees.
The
 isolated region plans to open several new border trading ports, it said
wit
hout giving details. Currently Tibet's sole air link is with Chengdu, in
nei
ghbouring Sichuan province.
'The action is part of Tibet's efforts to open i
ts door wider to the outside
world and step up economic development, in the 
wake of (senior leader) Deng
Xiaoping's urge for bolder reform,' Gyamtso tol
d the newspaper.
He said the region was considering a second economic zone i
n Jiangzi county,
200km (125 miles) from the Indian border.

<DATELINE>    SYDNEY </DATELINE>
<
TEXT>
Australia doubled in size yesterday, as it formally claimed massive ne
w
offshore territory under an international 'law of the sea' convention. The

1982 United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea, which was finally
rat
ified this year, aims to divide about 35 per cent of the world's oceans
amon
g over 100 countries. In Australia's case it means that the country can
clai
m an exclusive economic zone extending 200 nautical miles from its
baselines
, instead of the traditional 12 miles.
Because of the nation's extensive coa
stline it is now claiming around 5.7m
sq miles of ocean water, of which 4.2m
 sq miles derives from the new
extended nautical limits. As a result, Austra
lia can boast one of the
largest 'exclusive economic zones' in the world.
Wh
ile much of the additional territory is undisputed, there is disagreement
wi
th Indonesia over territory around Christmas Island and off the north
coast 
of Australia, including the resource-rich Timor Gap.

<HEADLINE> FT  13 AUG 93 / China closes down 1,000 local developm
ent zones </HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>    By LYNNE O'DONNELL and ALEXANDER NICOLL </
BYLINE>
<DATELINE>    BEIJING, LONDON </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Chinese governm
ent, stepping up its drive to stop wasteful spending and
curb the country's 
overheated growth rate, yesterday announced the closure
of most economic dev
elopment zones established by local governments to
attract investment.
Xinhu
a, the official news agency, said 1,000 zones in southern coastal areas
had 
been shut down, and the remaining 200 were being inspected with a view
to fu
rther closures.
The measure will have no effect on special economic zones au
thorised by the
central government to promote economic reform and growth, su
ch as Shenzhen,
just across the border from Hong Kong.
The zones being close
d were set up by local officials who were attracted by
real estate profits a
nd offered tax breaks and other unauthorised incentives
to match the attract
ions of authorised investment areas.
Mr Hu Ping, director of the Special Eco
nomic Zone Office, said the State
Council, China's cabinet, had approved onl
y 30 economic and technological
development zones in the coastal areas.
He s
aid only 10 per cent of the unauthorised zones had been beneficial for
the l
ocal economy. One-fifth were waiting for money to start planned
projects. Th
ey tied up scarce farmland, slowing agricultural production, he
added.
'The 
objective is to stop land which has little prospect of development in
the ne
ar future from being cordoned off when it could be used for crop
growing,' M
r Hu said.
Profligate spending and corruption among local officials are part
icular
targets of the campaign of Mr Zhu Rongji, vice premier and central ba
nk
governor, to curb money supply and inflationary growth.
According to Chin
a Focus, a publication of the Princeton China Initiative in
the US, Mr Zhu r
ecently criticised officials in Guangxi province, in
south-west China, who h
ad ploughed over and fenced off 15,000 square
kilometres of farmland of whic
h 1 per cent had so far been taken up by
construction.
Calculating that deve
loping the land would cost the entire national
development budget for six ye
ars, Mr Zhu is reported to have asked them:
'Just let me know where the mone
y is coming from. . . What is the rest of
the nation to do meanwhile?'
Xinhu
a yesterday said officials in Beihai city, Guangxi province, had
approved do
zens of questionable property schemes, including casinos.
China's trade defi
cit was Dollars 4.62bn in the first seven months of 1993,
although trade off
icials are confident the current austerity measures will
help achieve a surp
lus for 1992 by the year-end. Exports were up 4.7 per
cent to Dollars 44.78b
n over the same period of last year, and imports up
25.7 per cent to Dollars
 49.4bn.

<HEADLINE> FT  01 MAY 92 / Survey of Building for Asia's Future 
(11): Another Asian dragon rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AN economic power house 
is being created in the southern provinces of China,
Hong Kong and Macao.
In
 Guangdong, Hainan, Fujien and to a lesser extent Shanghai, the dead hand
of
 central government control has been lifted and enterprise is being given
it
s head.
Development in Hong Kong and Macao  - airports, ports, electric powe
r and
telecommunications  - is occurring as a result of the southern Chinese

economic miracle.
The scale of the task in developing the region's infrastr
ucture is
illustrated by the fact that Guangdong, with a population of 63m, 
is larger
than the UK but its total electricity generating capacity equals o
nly 5 per
cent of Britain's.
This decade may see the electrification of sout
hern China, construction of
big airports, creation of a telecommunications n
etwork, and the paving of
thousands of miles of highways.
Guangdong and Hong
 Kong are planning large rises in electricity capacity.
Generating capacity 
in Guangdong amounted to 8,280MW in 1990, but is planned
to increase to 14,3
00MW by 1995 and to produce 20,000MW by the year 2000.
GEC-Alsthom has just 
won a Pounds 550m contract to build two coal-fired
650MW units at Shajiao, o
n the Pearl River.
In Hong Kong  - where electricity generating capacity of 
8,387MW is greater
than Guangdong's  - there are plans to increase nearly do
uble capacity over
the next 15 years.
Anyone who has travelled on Guangdong'
s road system will appreciate the need
for improvement.
Most roads in Guangd
ong are single-lane dual carriage ways, with traffic
moving at a snail's pac
e.
Mr Gordon Wu, managing director of Hopewell Holdings of Hong Kong, is
bui
lding a six-lane 304km super-highway, the first phase of which will
connect 
Shenzhen, on the Hong Kong border, with the provincial capital of
Guangzhou.

By the end of the century, within a radius of less than 50 nautical miles
f
rom the centre of Hong Kong, there will be three airports capable of
dealing
 with international passenger and cargo traffic, and internal China
trade.
T
he largest of the three will be situated at Chek Lap Kok, a small island to

the north of Lantau.
Due for opening some time in 1997  - the year China res
umes sovereignty over
the British colony  - the airport will have a cargo ca
pacity of 1m tonnes a
year and ability to handle 20m passengers a year.
A pl
anned international airport for Macao  - which reverts from Portugal to
Chin
a in 1999  - will open up the Zhuhai special economic zone.
By the year 2000
 it is forecast to handle over 6m passengers and 123,000
tonnes of cargo a y
ear. The smallest is an airport just completed at
Shenzhen, the special econ
omic zone which borders Hong Kong. It has a
planned capacity, by 2000, of 5.
5m passengers and nearly 200,000 tonnes of
cargo a year.
In Hong Kong there 
are an average of 54 telephones for every 100 people; in
Shenzhen, there are
 17; in Guangdong the figure falls to three; and for the
whole of China it i
s less than one. China has embarked on a Dollars 6bn
telecoms programme, but
 that is just the beginning.
Hong Kong's biggest infrastructural advantage h
as been its natural harbour.
But its franchise is coming under threat from a
 more outward-looking China.
Work on an ambitious container terminal at Yant
ian, just across Hong Kong's
eastern border, is already advanced. To the wes
t, Shekou has succeeded in
attracting one Middle Eastern shipping company to
 its shallower container
facilities in the Pearl River and a European shippi
ng line is negotiating to
set up a direct route.
A third big deep-water port
 is planned in Gaolan, next to the Special
Economic Zone of Zhuhai.
Further 
afield, free ports are being set up in Yangpu in Northern Hainan
island and 
in the city of Xiamen, opposite Taiwan. These two special zones
have the avo
wed intent of mirroring the success of Hong Kong and are well
located to do 
so.
Local business remains confident that Hong Kong's infrastructure will gi
ve
it the edge. 'The cake is getting sufficiently bigger, so there is enough

for all of us', said one terminal operator. This view is reflected in the
g
rowing number of consortia preparing to bid for the territory's ninth
contai
ner terminal.
'Transport infrastructure is fundamental to Hong Kong's future
 success,'
said Mr Alisdair Morrison, managing director of the Jardine Mathe
son group's
property arm Hongkong Land, one of a number of companies to expr
ess an
interest in bidding for the new terminal, due to open in 1995.
'As Ho
ng Kong integrates with southern China, it is the manufacturing sector
and t
he physical movement of its goods which is at the forefront of Hong
Kong's g
rowth. The port is the mechanism for taking advantage of that', said
Mr Morr
ison.
The emerging ports over the border seem likely to act as feeder ports 
for
Hong Kong, as will also be the case with the new deep-water port in Maca
o.
All the Pearl River ports suffer from silting and offer difficult access.
 In
the short term, they should enhance Hong Kong's position as a regional h
ub.
Total container output for the whole of China was only 1.5m Twenty-foot

Equivalent Units (TEUs) in 1990, compared with in excess of 5m TEUs out of
H
ong Kong. The turnaround for a container in Hong Kong is measured in hours,

while operators claim that in China it has to be measured in days or even
we
eks.
The Hong Kong government estimates that the number of fully-containeris
ed
vessels utilising the port will increase from 8,390 in 1990 to 21,000 by

2001.
'I would even question whether Hong Kong can offer enough capacity in 
the
next five years. It's going to be very tough. Some of the business is go
ing
to go to other places, but there's more than enough business for everybo
dy',
said Mr David Allen, managing director of Asia Terminals.

<HEADLINE> FT  16 NOV 94 / Law of the Sea promises many disputes 
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>    By BRUCE CLARK, Diplomatic Correspondent </BYLINE>
<
TEXT>
The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which enters full
 force
today, seems likely to be treated by coastal states as a rich source 
of
legal and rhetorical arguments to be used against rivals.
This is in spit
e of the fact that the last thing the law's drafters wanted
was to provide d
isputatious countries with extra torpedoes. One of the law's
ostensible purp
oses is to encourage compromises over the exploitation of
maritime resources
, even among countries with unresolved disputes.
Apart from a standoff in th
e Aegean - where Turkey has threatened war if
Greece extends its territorial
 waters to 12 miles - one of the most grave
maritime disputes involves China
 and Vietnam, locked in a war of words over
oil rights in the South China Se
a.
Both China and Vietnam claim to be acting in accordance with the Law of t
he
Sea but their interpretations of the document are miles apart.
Over the l
ast month, China has accused Vietnam of infringing its interests
in internat
ional waters by inviting US and European companies to explore for
oil in the
 Tonkin Gulf.
Vietnam has retorted that it is exercising its legitimate righ
ts in the
economic zone to which it is entitled by the UN convention. It sai
d that
under the terms of that treaty, there were no international waters in
 the
Gulf.
This dialogue of the deaf reflects confusion over the difference 
between
territorial waters - which may be extended, under the UN Law, up to 
12 miles
 -and the 'economic zone' which coastal states are entitled to clai
m,
amounting to either 200 miles or the full extent of their continental she
lf,
whichever is larger.
China and Vietnam are also arguing over resources a
round the Spratly
Islands, a group of reefs and atolls whose other would-be 
owners are Taiwan,
Brunei, Malaysia and the Philippines.
China has awarded a
n exploration contract to the US company Crestone for an
area south-west of 
the Spratlys, while Vietnam has awarded a consortium led
by Mobil a bloc sli
ghtly further to the west. Each state has denounced the
other's contract.
So
vereignty over the Spratlys - and hence control of the surrounding
economic 
zone - is crucial to each side's claim to energy rights, and the
salience of
 this issue is expected to grow as the UN convention enters
force.
However a
 study by a London-based law firm, maintains that the law favours
pragmatic 
joint exploitation accords, even among countries with unresolved
disputes.*

Laying out the common-sense arguments for such accords, it notes that oil
de
posits which straddle two states' economic zones cannot be exploited by
one 
without damaging the other's interests. When one state drills, oil from
the 
rival state's zone is liable to flow across the boundary line as a
result.
A
rticle 83 of the UN convention says that pending final agreement on zones,
c
ountries should 'make every effort to enter into provisional arrangements
of
 a practical nature'.
As an example of such a deal, the study cites the 1989
 accord between
Australia and Indonesia over waters south of Timor.
However,
 such accords are not a panacea. Portugal - still seen by the UN as
legal ad
ministrator of East Timor - has challenged Australia's right to
enter the ac
cord, before the International Court of Justice.
The entry into force of the
 UN Law comes a year after its ratification by
the minimum of 60 states. Ano
ther breakthrough came this summer when
provisions on deep-sea mining - outs
ide the zones of any country - were
amended so as to convince the US, the UK
 and Germany to sign.

<TEXT>
China is planning to set up a special economic zone in Lh
asa, the troubled
capital of Tibet, Reuter reports from Beijing.
The zone wi
ll imitate those operating in China's flourishing coastal
regions, the offic
ial China Daily said yesterday.
It quoted Tibet's vice governor Gyamtso as s
aying lack of open-mindedness
had impeded the region's development in the pa
st.
Tibet has been rocked by sporadic riots since Buddhist monks demonstrate
d
against Chinese rule in late 1987, prompting police to open fire on
protes
ters.
The region's exiled spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, syas more than 1
m
Tibetans have been killed since China took control of his country, now
cal
led the Tibet Autonomous Region, in 1950.
China Daily said Tibet's local gov
ernment is drawing up preferential
investment policies for the Lhasa special
 economic zone, including tax
breaks and low land-use fees.  The isolated re
gion plans to open several new
border trading ports.  Currently Tibet's sole
 air link is with Chengdu, in
neighbouring Sichuan province.

<HEADLINE> FT  04 APR 92 / Kohl wants ex-Soviet states barred fr
om joining the EC </HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>    By CHRISTOPHER PARKES </BYLINE>
<D
ATELINE>    BONN </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FORMER republics of the Soviet Union sho
uld not be allowed to join the
European Community, Chancellor Helmut Kohl of
 Germany said in Bonn last
night.
Presenting an ambitious vision of a contin
ent comprising two linked economic
blocs, he said the eastward expansion of 
the European Community should stop
with the accession of Poland, Hungary and
 Czechoslovakia. Former Soviet
states should form their own economic zone, h
e added.
Outlining what he called his 'future Ostpolitik', he urged the Comm
unity to
sign special treaties with the newly-independent countries to help 
them
rebuild their economies and develop a second economic group which could
 act
as a 'bridge from Europe to Asia'.
Formal association agreements with G
ermany's nearest eastern neighbours
would allow them to become full EC membe
rs.
'The EC should also relate to the states of the former Soviet Union, but
 not
in the same way. The right means is through special eastern treaties, w
hich
go beyond conventional co-operation agreements, rather than association
,' Mr
Kohl told an audience which included Mr Jacques Delors, European Commi
ssion
president, and Mr Edward Shevardnadze, former Soviet foreign minister 
who
now heads the state council in Georgia.
'Our realistic aim must be to su
pport them in their efforts towards real
economic integration among themselv
es,' Mr Kohl said. Once this had been
achieved, the goal must be to interloc
k the enlarged EC with the eastern
economic group.
Painting a picture of a p
olitically stable, economically successful and
militarily secure Europe, he 
stressed the role of Nato. It had to remain as
the anchor of European securi
ty. Most importantly, only the continued
existence of Nato could guarantee '
the necessary presence of the US in
Europe'.
The Conference on Security and 
Co-operation in Europe should also be given a
greater say in security matter
s.
To stabilise the situation in the east, he said, the west would have to o
pen
up its markets to help businesses generate investment capital. In future
,
all financial and economic aid should be directed towards helping the new

democracies to help themselves.
The economics minister, Mr Jurgen Mollemann,
 meanwhile announced a DM500,000
(Pounds 175,500) subsidy for an east-west e
conomics conference to be held in
Munster next month. About 200 east Europea
n politicians and economists will
be entertained at Bonn's expense while Gro
up of Seven and Portuguese
delegates will pay their own bills.

AN i
nternational court of arbitration yesterday ended a 25-year-old dispute
betw
een France and Canada over territorial waters claimed by the tiny French
Atl
antic Ocean islands of Saint-Pierre and Miquelon, Reuter reports from New
Yo
rk.
The court, in a 3-to-2 vote, ruled that the islands, off the coast of
Ne
wfoundland and Nova Scotia, have fishing rights up to 24 miles (40km) off
th
eir shores. They were also given a narrow 10.5-mile corridor that
stretches 
200 miles into the Atlantic. France had claimed fishing rights
extending 200
 miles from both islands. Canada had offered just a 12-mile
limit.
A drillin
g moratorium in the disputed zone, agreed by both countries in
1967, will be
 lifted shortly, allowing Canada to award contracts to oil
companies.
The tw
o islands were ceded to France in 1773 by Canada as a haven for French
fishe
rmen.

<TEXT>
YAOHAN, a Japanese retailing group, p
lans to set up a big computerised
distribution centre in Beijing with the Ch
inese government, to be completed
in 1995.
Mr Kazuo Wada, Yaohan's chairman,
 who moved the group's headquarters to Hong
Kong in 1990, said the plan was 
part of his strategy of establishing
production, distribution and retail net
works throughout China.
Yaohan, which has 432 stores worldwide, became the f
irst foreign retailer to
set up shop in China, opening department stores in 
Shenzhen and Beijing in
1991. It is also building a shopping centre with flo
or space of 108,000 sq m
in Pudong, the special economic zone near Shanghai,
 to completed in 1995.
'China lacks proper wholesaling and distributing syst
ems. It takes two to
three months to replace a product after it has been sol
d,' said Mr Wada. He
plans to set up distribution centres in 10 provinces, a
nd wants to open
1,000 supermarkets in China by the year 2010.
Mr Wada recko
ns that the true purchasing ability of Chinese living in large
cities is not
 reflected in the official statistics. Although the national
average annual 
income is considered to be about Dollars 350 (Pounds 232) per
person, 'In Sh
anghai it's about Dollars 2,000 and in Shenzhen about Dollars
3,000,' he sai
d.
Rockwell International, the US automotive-to-aerospace multinational, is

setting up a joint venture in China to develop and make a range of car body

components for the fast-expanding Chinese vehicle industry, John Griffiths
w
rites.
The venture, in which Rockwell will have a majority stake, is with Zh
enjiang
General Equipment Factory, based about 200 miles from Shanghai. It w
ill
operate under the name of Rockwell Chassis and Body System Zhenjiang
Com
pany.
Under the terms of the agreement, Rockwell will supply technology,
pro
cessing equipment, systems and management expertise - as well as an
undisclo
sed amount of investment capital - for the production of window
regulators, 
door latches, handbrakes and similar products.
Rockwell has been active in C
hina since the 1970s. 'The venture reflects
Rockwell's overall strategy for 
investment in China, where there is a huge
potential for passenger car growt
h,' according to Mr Donald Beall, its
chairman and chief executive.
Rockwell
 already exports to China heavy-duty axles and brakes and components
for off
-highway construction equipment, avionics, telecommunications and
automation
 equipment and printing presses.
Several of its existing motor industry cust
omers, including Peugeot of
France, are either starting up of expanding car 
production in China.

r development of new Hong Kong </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BEIJING has given the go-ahe
ad for a Hong Kong-led consortium to develop a
special free port zone on Hai
nan Island, off the south China coast, to
create a 'second Hong Kong'. Devel
opment costs over 15 years are estimated
at Dollars HK18bn (Pounds 1.3bn).
T
he news is further affirmation of China's commitment to rapid economic
refor
m. Although the new Yangpu Development Zone will remain under China's
sovere
ignty, the land use will be controlled by the group of overseas
investors un
der a 70-year lease.
Kumagai Gumi (Hong Kong), the Hong Kong-listed subsidia
ry of the Japanese
construction giant, will combine with a group of investor
s to provide a
basic infrastructure for the Yangpu Zone, building a power st
ation, roads
and sewage works. The group will then sell land for development
 by local or
foreign investors.
The zone will be segregated from the rest of
 Hainan by a customs frontier,
and aim to concentrate on developing export-o
riented industries, making use
of a deep-sea port. Enterprises in the zone w
ill receive tax benefits above
those current in the existing Special Economi
c Zones, including Hainan
Island itself. No external policy will be laid dow
n on the level of
recruitment or wages in the zone.
Development will be in t
hree phases, phase one requiring investment of
Dollars HK2.5bn and providing
 services for a 75,000 population. But Kumagai
aims for a population of 250,
000 and employment for a further 150,000
temporary residents, at the end of 
15 years.
Kumagai has paid a Dollars HK40m deposit for the land and will pay
 out a
total of Dollars HK140m for the site. Kumagai has been negotiating to
 set up
the Zone for more than four years. The final line-up of the Yangpu
c
onsortium has yet to be finalised, but analysts believe Kumagai will be the

main shareholder, with possible support from its parent company.

THE US Coast Guard intercepted tw
o boats trying to smuggle 270 Chinese into
California yesterday, coinciding 
with a Chinese government statement that it
had stepped up efforts to halt i
llegal emigration, AP reports.
'The public security departments have stepped
 up efforts to track down the
criminal groups organising human smuggling and
 patrols at sea,' a Chinese
Foreign Ministry spokesman said.
Since January a
uthorities on both sides of the Pacific have intercepted
boats carrying abou
t 2,500 Chinese, each of whom had paid or promised
smugglers Dollars 20,000-
Dollars 30,000 (Pounds 13,000-Pounds 19,500) to get
them into the US illegal
ly. Many others are entering overland from Mexico or
arriving at airports wi

<HEADLINE> FT  16 FEB 93 / Germans call for aid in curbing illega
l migrants </HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>    By NICHOLAS DENTON </BYLINE>
<DATELINE>  
  BUDAPEST </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INTERIOR ministers from east and west Europe g
athering in Budapest yesterday
for a conference on migration were immediatel
y pressed by Germany to help
curb the influx of illegal immigrants.
Germany 
is urging east European countries to take back nationals resident
elsewhere 
without permission, and speed migrants' return to their country of
origin. A
lso high on the agenda is a proposal to co-ordinate action on
international 
'human smuggling' groups.
The Germans want 'non-front-line' western countrie
s to share the burden of
financial aid towards strengthening eastern Europe'
s immigration controls.
The conference coincides with German efforts to tigh
ten the country's
liberal asylum rules.
Germany's proposed constitutional am
endment would allow authorities to turn
back claimants for refugee status if
 they arrive from 'safe' neighbouring
east European countries. Poland and th
e Czech Republic are determined not to
become a cordon sanitaire for seekers
 of asylum in Germany.
Bonn's efforts have an added urgency because of conti
nuing racist attacks
against foreigners. But EC countries less affected by i
mmigration from
eastern Europe are grudging in their solidarity. UK official
s said yesterday
that, while backing recommendations on exchange of informat
ion, they did not
wish to see new measures, describing as unrealistic ideas 
about financial
aid.

THE US Coast Guard intercepted tw
o boats trying to smuggle 270 Chinese into
California yesterday, coinciding 
with a Chinese government statement that it
had stepped up efforts to halt i
llegal emigration, AP reports.
'The public security departments have stepped
 up efforts to track down the
criminal groups organising human smuggling and
 patrols at sea,' a Chinese
Foreign Ministry spokesman said.
Since January a
uthorities on both sides of the Pacific have intercepted
boats carrying abou
t 2,500 Chinese, each of whom had paid or promised
smugglers Dollars 20,000-
Dollars 30,000 (Pounds 13,000-Pounds 19,500) to get
them into the US illegal
ly. Many others are entering overland from Mexico or
arriving at airports wi
th false documents.

<BYLINE>    By NICHOLAS DENTON </BYLINE>
<DATELINE>  
  BUDAPEST </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INTERIOR ministers from east and west Europe g
athering in Budapest yesterday
for a conference on migration were immediatel
y pressed by Germany to help
curb the influx of illegal immigrants.
Germany 
is urging east European countries to take back nationals resident
elsewhere 
without permission, and speed migrants' return to their country of
origin. A
lso high on the agenda is a proposal to co-ordinate action on
international 
'human smuggling' groups.
The Germans want 'non-front-line' western countrie
s to share the burden of
financial aid towards strengthening eastern Europe'
s immigration controls.
The conference coincides with German efforts to tigh
ten the country's
liberal asylum rules.
Germany's proposed constitutional am
endment would allow authorities to turn
back claimants for refugee status if
 they arrive from 'safe' neighbouring
east European countries. Poland and th
e Czech Republic are determined not to
become a cordon sanitaire for seekers
 of asylum in Germany.
Bonn's efforts have an added urgency because of conti
nuing racist attacks
against foreigners. But EC countries less affected by i
mmigration from
eastern Europe are grudging in their solidarity. UK official
s said yesterday
that, while backing recommendations on exchange of informat
ion, they did not
wish to see new measures, describing as unrealistic ideas 
about financial
aid.

<HEADLINE> FT  03 AUG 94 / Reality threatens to overcome China-T
aiwan rivalry / Preview of talks between Beijing and Taipei that may for the
 first time address the issue of direct sea and air links </HEADLINE>
<BYLIN
E>    By LAURA TYSON </BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Village chief Huang, who has spent mos
t of his 64 years fishing out of
Nanliao, a small port on the north-west coa
st of Taiwan, is angry. Since the
government cracked down on a brisk trade i
n smuggling goods between the
island and China a few years ago, local fisher
men are having a tough time
making ends meet.
'The government should just le
galise direct shipping with China and make
those smugglers pay tax, like the
y do on the mainland side,' complains Mr
Huang. 'That's a much better way to
 manage things. Instead, they send the
fishermen to jail, burn their boats a
nd the police confiscate the goods for
themselves. This is totally unreasona
ble. Besides, it isn't really smuggling
anyway; it's domestic trade.'
Even a
s Mr Huang was speaking, officials from rival governments in Taipei
and Beij
ing were preparing to hold high-level talks in which, Taiwanese
newspapers h
ave suggested, Taipei may for the first time address the issue
of resuming d
irect sea and air links to China.
Taiwan's Nationalist government has banned
 the san tung or 'three directs' -
transportation, trade and post - with Chi
na since 1949, when General Chiang
Kai-shek fled to the island after losing 
a civil war to Mao Zedong's
communist forces.
Fast-growing cross-strait trad
e is mostly funneled through Hong Kong. But
smuggling and illegal fishing in
 the Taiwan Strait surged once the
government lifted martial law and began t
o relax coastal defence operations
in 1987.
Positioned at the narrowest poin
t along the strait, Nanliao became a
smuggling hub. To traverse the 70-odd n
autical miles to Pingtan on the coast
of China's Fujian province takes 10 ho
urs by fishing boat, three to four
hours by cruiser, or less than two hours 
by speedboat.
Lured by high returns, local fishermen plied the waters in woo
den boats
laden with contraband ranging from liquor, cigarettes and medicine
s, to
narcotics from betel to heroin and human cargo which has found its way
 to
shores as far-flung as New York. Judging by the number of Mercedes-Benze
s
and BMWs on the sleepy byways of Nanliao, some locals profited handsomely

before Taiwan's maritime police swooped on Nanliao.
Cross-strait smuggling h
as simply been diverted elsewhere, mainly along
Taiwan's northern coast. An 
estimated 200 fishing boats make the crossing
each day. Smuggled Chinese pro
ducts can be found in markets and 30,000
mainlanders are illegally living on
 the island.
From tomorrow, Taiwan's chief China negotiator, Mr Chiao Jen-ho
, will begin
four days of talks with his counterpart from Beijing, Mr Tang S
hubei. Little
progress has been made in five previous quasi-official cross-s
trait
discussions since ground-breaking meetings in April 1993. But the stal
emate
in political relations belies resurgent economic ties, driven by cultu
ral
and family connections as well as the search by Taiwan businessmen for c
heap
labour, land, raw materials and markets. Taiwanese investment in China 
is
estimated at more than Dollars 15bn (Pounds 9.6bn).
Taiwan officials pred
ict that Hong Kong, the main conduit, will soon
supplant the US as the islan
d's biggest export market. In the first half of
this year, shipments to the 
US accounted for 25.9 per cent of total exports,
down 1.8 per cent from a ye
ar earlier. Exports to the British colony jumped
11.2 per cent to account fo
r 22.9 per cent of outbound shipments. Most
shipments headed for Hong Kong a
re destined for China.
A leading Chinese businessman visited the island last
 week under the guise
of promoting cross-strait golfing exchanges. Mr Wang J
un, president of the
China International Trust and Investment Corp (Citic), 
China's leading
international business conglomerate, met with senior figures
 in politics and
business.
Mr Wang's low-profile tour of the island included
 a trip to Taichung
harbour, which is preparing for the advent of cross-stra
it shipping. It is
perhaps no coincidence that Citic and Bechtel Enterprises
, the finance and
development arm of the engineering group, last week jointl
y announced a port
development plan at Daxie Island, about 100 miles south o
f Shanghai.
So far, Taipei has refused to discuss direct links on the ground
s that
Beijing must first recognise Taiwan as a sovereign government. China

continues to regard Taiwan as a renegade province. But as economic ties
betw
een the two sides grow, so too does pressure from Taiwan's business
communit
y, making it increasingly difficult for Taipei to stave off the
inevitable.

The ministry of transportation and communications promised early last month

to produce a report by mid-1995 outlining technical aspects of direct sea
an
d air links with China. This is probably little more than a stalling
techniq
ue, as the ministry has already been studying the matter for years.
But the 
government knows it must come to grips with the issue before June 30
1997, w
hen Hong Kong reverts to Chinese sovereignty, for then there can be
no more 
pretence of keeping China at arm's length.

<HEADLINE> FT  23 JUN 93 / Threat to aid may complete Sierra Leon
e's misery </HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>    By THEODORE LIASI </BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIERRA
 LEONE, though rich in diamonds and other minerals, is ranked second
last by
 the United Nations in its latest human development index, with a
worse qual
ity of life for its citizens than anywhere in the world except
neighbouring 
Guinea.
Endemic diamond smuggling, four military coups, a festering civil wa
r and a
withdrawal of some western aid following human rights abuses have le
ft the
populace dependent in large measure on non-governmental aid agencies.

Even this may be in jeopardy. The finance ministry has threatened to
introd
uce a levy on all imports, including relief aid. The Red Cross has
warned th
at it would be forced to withdraw from the country if aid was not
exempted.

As the number of refugees fleeing fighting in the eastern and southern
distr
icts increases - it is put at 1m - huge camps have appeared, each
housing up
 to 20,000 people in makeshift huts and disused buildings across
the country
. With the onset of the rainy season aid agencies fear the
temporary housing
 - usually constructed out of grass reeds - will be washed
away.
As Mr Josep
h Quam, eastern co-ordinator for Unicef, which plays an integral
role in the
 distribution of food, medicine and clothing, explains, the
relief programme
 should be making way for the next phase of rehabilitation.
'We keep pushing
 back the relief phase. We thought that by now we would have
finished with r
elief and moved to rehabilitation, of which there is a lot to
be done.'
Cons
equently, the relief programme will have to continue at least until the
end 
of this year, and the relief agencies are concerned that they will not
be ab
le to guarantee resources for the duration.
Sierra Leone, a former British c
olony of 4.7m in a country the size of
Scotland, has entered its second year
 under a new government following the
overthrow of President Joseph Momoh in
 a bloodless military coup in April
1992.
The National Provisional Ruling Co
uncil, led by 27-year-old Captain
Valentine Strasser - known as 'the Redeeme
r' - on seizing power vowed to
eradicate corruption and nepotism. But there 
is still little to cheer about.
Smuggling of diamonds remains commonplace, a
nd recent incursions by rebel
forces into mining areas have also interrupted
 operations.
Last Christmas saw the summary executions of 26 alleged rebels.
 This
resulted in Britain suspending economic aid. The EC has also been revi
ewing
its position. The government says human rights abuses under the old re
gime
were ignored by the west.

<HEADLINE> FT  07 JUN 93 / US fears flood of China's new slaves: 
California's latest immigration problem </HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>    By LOUISE KE
HOE and TONY WALKER </BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMMIGRATION officials in California fea
r that thousands of illegal Chinese
emigrants may be on board ships headed f
or the west coast of the US,
following the apprehension of about 500 Chinese
 landing along the coast over
the past two weeks.
Two trawlers, each carryin
g a human cargo of about 150 Chinese immigrants
packed into the holds, were 
seized earlier this week as they landed at
fishing harbours near Monterey an
d San Francisco. The coastal vessels are
believed to have picked up their pa
ssengers five days earlier from off-shore
'mother ships' which crossed the P
acific.
Last month, in an even more brazen attempt to smuggle people into th
e US,
the Pai Sheng, a Chinese freighter, sailed under the Golden Gate Bridg
e
right into San Francisco Bay to drop off about 270 passengers at a disused

city pier. Most were detained after a chase by police and immigration agent
s
through city parks and streets.
These incidents are further evidence of wh
at US authorities say is a
large-scale smuggling operation with suspected li
nks to Asian organised
crime rings in the US and Hong Kong.
The immigrants, 
most of them men in their 20s, pay fees of between Dollars
20,000 (Pounds 13
,000) and Dollars 40,000 for their passage to the US,
according to investiga
tors. They scrape together about Dollars 1,000,
typically borrowed from rela
tives, to board the ships, and are then indebted
for the balance of their 'f
are'.
Most of the illegal immigrants set off from the coastal Chinese provin
ces of
Fujian and Guangdong. Many, however, come from China's hinterland whe
re
people feel they are being left behind by the economic boom in more
prosp
erous areas of the country. A widening economic gap between country and
city
 is contributing to the desperation of many young Chinese.
Although they com
e to the US seeking jobs and economic prosperity, the
immigrants instead bec
ome slaves to their smugglers and many resort to crime
to pay off their debt
s, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
'They are selling their
 souls. What are these people going to do to pay off
the smugglers? ' asks R
ichard Held, a FBI Special Agent in San Francisco.
'Does that mean moving he
roin or cocaine? That is a distinct possibility.'
The recent influx has rais
ed suspicions in the US of complicity by the
Chinese government in the human
 trafficking. But in Beijing officials deny
'turning a blind eye' to illegal
 emigration. 'The Chinese government has all
along been opposed to illegal e
migration and has adopted a series of
measures to stop it,' said Mr Wu Jianm
in, the Chinese foreign ministry
spokesman.
Mr Wu insisted that Chinese secu
rity organisations had 'intensified their
efforts' to stop illegal organisat
ions trafficking in immigrants.
However, some of the immigrants landing in S
an Francisco this week spoke of
paying additional fees to bribe Chinese gove
rnment officials to let them
leave the country, according to US investigator
s.
With millions of dollars being extorted from the passengers of the Chines
e
smuggling ships, it seems unlikely that the practice will end soon. So far

this year, the US Coast Guard has detained over 1,600 illegal Chinese
immig
rants, more than twice the number in 1992.
The rising numbers could, however
, reflect a change of route, rather than a
growing volume of illegal immigra
nts. US investigators speculate that the
smugglers are now cutting out 'midd
le men' in other countries and attempting
to maximise their profits by landi
ng their passengers directly on US shores.
Chinese officials charge that the
 willingness of some countries (including
the US) to grant 'political asylum
' to Chinese emigrants is encouraging
human smuggling.
Indeed, US immigratio
n lawyers representing some of the passengers of the
Pai Sheng say that they
 will seek asylum and note that the judicial process
may take as long as 10 
years, giving their clients time to seek legal US
residency.

<HEADLINE> FT  14 MAY 91 / Letter: The enterprise culture in Parag
uay </HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>    From Mr ANTONIO ESPINOZA </BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I
t is so seldom that Paraguay gets press coverage in Britain, that it
is disa
ppointing that your correspondent Christina Lamb gives your readers a
rather
 distorted view of my country in her article, 'Paraguay finds old
habits die
 hard', (May 9).
Street vendors do hawk French perfumes and Japanese electro
nics, but should
one presume they are contraband? Smuggling had been endemic
 during the
Stroessner regime, and one of the first measures of the new gove
rnment of
president Rodriguez was to cut the tariffs on these and most other
 consumer
luxuries to 7 per cent - removing the incentive to smuggle, and pr
actically
ending the illegal import of these goods.
The high tariff barriers
 of our neighbours do, naturally, make shopping in
Paraguay very attractive,
 generating an important regional tourist trade.
This has helped to sustain 
our growth rate in spite of the major adjustments
that have had to be made a
s state subsidies and other forms of government
intervention are removed fro
m the economy.
In fact, the World Bank estimates our gross domestic product 
growth for 1990
at 5.1 per cent, not the zero growth stated in your article.

Of course the after-effects of 35 years of autocratic rule cannot be wished

away, and the struggle to perfect our democratic institutions, our human
ri
ghts record and the liberal-isation of the economy continues. Gigantic
strid
es in this direction have already been made, and we shall persist.
My govern
ment remains as committed as ever to supporting the creative forces
of free 
enterprise in a truly democratic environment.

<HEADLINE> FT  01 DEC 94 / The Budget: Reforms of Customs work an
nounced </HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>    By JIM KELLY, Accountancy Correspondent </BY
LINE>
<TEXT>
Reforms to the way Customs and Excise carries out its work were
 announced
yesterday after a root-and-branch review which will result in 4,0
00 job
losses over the next five years.
Job cuts in the department, which is
 under pressure to cut costs and meet
the public spending targets set out in
 this week's Budget, will include 550
anti-smuggling officers and 2,000 valu
e added tax officials.
The staffing reductions were criticised bitterly by t
rade union leaders
yesterday who said they were designed to pay for future t
ax cuts, would
damage the fight against drugs and allow significant VAT evas
ion.
But Mrs Valerie Strachan, chairman of Customs and Excise, denied that t
he
changes had been prompted by the need to cut costs: 'We have been moving 
in
this direction for some years. We have been analysing the risks and focus
ing
on areas where risk is greater.'
She added: 'By the year 2000, we expect
 our numbers to be just under 21,000
compared with the current figure of jus
t over 25,000.'
Changes announced in the Budget on the collection of VAT - t
he registration
threshold is to be raised to Pounds 46,000 - will limit visi
ts to companies
and reduce the burden on officials, said Mrs Strachan.
She e
nvisaged more 'desk audits' at local VAT offices of traders' books
rather th
an visits to the workplace.
The development of the single European market ha
d also altered the way the
department worked - shifting the workload away fr
om ports and airports.
However, Mrs Strachan promised: 'There are not going 
to be any Customs-free
ports or airports.' In future there would be more con
centration on catching
high-value complex smuggling and trafficking.
A furth
er measure which will help cut costs is closer liaison with the
Inland Reven
ue. They are to share the same adjudicator, helplines, advice
centres, and p
ossibly training programmes.
Mr John Sheldon, general secretary of the NUCPS
 civil service union, said:
'Cuts in the front-line fighters against drug sm
uggling will be paid for by
all of us in the human and cash costs of drug ad
diction and drug-related
crime on the streets. It is a dangerous and irrespo
nsible decision.'
Mr Mike King, the NUCPS national officer for Customs, said
: 'These cuts have
nothing to do with efficiency or effectiveness and everyt
hing to do with
finding the cash for future tax cuts to save the government 
at the next
election.'

<HEADLINE> FT  01 AUG 94 / International Press Review: Asean min
isters face wrath of Thai journalists </HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>    By VICTOR MALL
ET </BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thailand's liberal newspapers have excelled themselves i
n their efforts to
embarrass the now not-so-liberal Thai government, which w
as host to the
annual meeting of the Association of South-East Asian Nations
 (Asean) in
Bangkok over the past two weeks.
Visiting foreign ministers from
 Indonesia and Burma were greeted with
hundreds of column-inches about Indon
esian brutality in East Timor, Burmese
military cruelty and editorials scoff
ing at the notion, put about by
authoritarian Asian governments, that human 
rights and democracy are
inappropriate for Asia.
Thai commentators were insp
ired by two events: Thailand invited Mr Ohn Gyaw,
foreign minister of the Bu
rmese junta, to the Asean meeting, an honour which
some editorial writers fe
lt was scarcely deserved; and the Thai authorities
made hamfisted attempts t
o stop an insignificant human rights conference,
deporting three foreigners 
and harassing the participants because they
wanted to discuss Burma and East
 Timor.
Thailand, said The Nation in an editorial, was foolishly giving in t
o the
'bully-boy tactics' of Indonesia in the name of Asean solidarity.
'It 
is high time that the regional grouping reviewed its concept of
'solidarity'
,' said The Nation. 'The events of the past three months clearly
show that I
ndonesia is using Asean as its platform to impose authoritarian
values over 
members which have different political systems.'
During the May 1992 crisis,
 in which Thai troops killed 50 demonstrators on
the streets of Bangkok, The
 Nation, an English-language newspaper, openly
opposed the Thai armed forces
 and supported pro-democracy activists. Its
support helped bring the present
 democratic government of Mr Chuan Leekpai
to power, and the paper believes 
it has the right to express disappointment
at his performance.
Mr Chuan, the
 newspaper said in another editorial, now seemed to think it
more important 
for Thailand to have good relations with Indonesia than to
care about human 
rights.
On the subject of bullying, Mr Ali Alatas, the Indonesian foreign mi
nister,
in an interview with the Bangkok Post, the other leading English-lan
guage
daily, said Indonesia was not a bully - it had simply informed Thailan
d
about the plans of some East Timor activists and had explained how offende
d
Indonesia would be if nothing was done to stop them.
While English-languag
e newspapers in Thailand represent the views of liberal
academics and busine
ssmen - half the readers are Thais - and take a close
interest in internatio
nal affairs, the Thai-language press tends to be more
concerned by the shena
nigans of Thai politicians and local crime stories.
Over the last two weeks 
the Thai papers have concentrated on the fate of two
politicians: one accuse
d of international drug smuggling; the other,
suspected of buying votes by g
iving cash to Buddhist temples.
A Bangkok Post survey of ordinary people on 
the streets of the capital
suggested that the Thai papers were right to thin
k their readers would not
be interested in the dry affairs of Asean. 'Asean?
 Is it a sports event? It
sounds familiar,' said Mr Sermsuk In-jan, a 50-yea
r-old shop assistant.
But the dispute over human rights prompted by the Asea
n meeting did generate
heated debate in the Thai papers.
Siam Rath (Siam Nat
ion) and Naew Na (Frontline) both supported the Thai
government's crackdown 
on dissidents. Thailand should not allow outsiders to
use the country as a v
enue for criticising neighbouring states, because the
national interest shou
ld have top priority, Siam Rath said in an editorial.
Liberal commentators r
ejected this sort of nationalism, declaring that
national pride meant standi
ng up for what you believe in rather than
allowing your policies to be dicta
ted by the sensitivities of other
governments.

<HEADLINE> FT  16 FEB 93 / Germans call for aid in curbing illega
l migrants </HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>    By NICHOLAS DENTON </BYLINE>
<DATELINE>  
  BUDAPEST </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INTERIOR ministers from east and west Europe g
athering in Budapest yesterday
for a conference on migration were immediatel
y pressed by Germany to help
curb the influx of illegal immigrants.
Germany 
is urging east European countries to take back nationals resident
elsewhere 
without permission, and speed migrants' return to their country of
origin. A
lso high on the agenda is a proposal to co-ordinate action on
international 
'human smuggling' groups.
The Germans want 'non-front-line' western countrie
s to share the burden of
financial aid towards strengthening eastern Europe'
s immigration controls.
The conference coincides with German efforts to tigh
ten the country's
liberal asylum rules.
Germany's proposed constitutional am
endment would allow authorities to turn
back claimants for refugee status if
 they arrive from 'safe' neighbouring
east European countries. Poland and th
e Czech Republic are determined not to
become a cordon sanitaire for seekers
 of asylum in Germany.
Bonn's efforts have an added urgency because of conti
nuing racist attacks
against foreigners. But EC countries less affected by i
mmigration from
eastern Europe are grudging in their solidarity. UK official
s said yesterday
that, while backing recommendations on exchange of informat
ion, they did not
wish to see new measures, describing as unrealistic ideas 
about financial
aid.

<HEADLINE> FT  27 JAN 94 / Smugglers force Canada to cut cigaret
te taxes </HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>    By BERNARD SIMON </BYLINE>
<DATELINE>    TO
RONTO </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Canada's federal and Quebec governments have bowed 
to the commercial and
political costs of rampant cigarette smuggling across 
the US-Canada border
and look set to reverse a tradition of ever-higher taxa
tion on tobacco
products.
Both Quebec and Ottawa have promised to cut and pe
rhaps even abolish the
high federal and provincial taxes which are widely bl
amed for the surge in
cigarette smuggling.
The problem is most acute in Queb
ec, where the Canadian Tobacco
Manufacturers Council estimates that about tw
o-thirds of all cigarette sales
are contraband.
A group of Quebec convenienc
e store owners, whose business has been ravaged
by smuggling, earlier this w
eek flouted the law by setting up an illegal
market north of Montreal, where
 they sold cigarettes at the smuggled price
of CDollars 20 (Pounds 10.20) a 
carton, compared with the fully-taxed retail
price of CDollars 40-CDollars 4
6.
Governments have become increasingly concerned at the social and politica
l
ramifications of smuggling. Much of the trade, which is centred on the St

Lawrence River and Indian reserves which straddle the US-Canada border, has

fallen into the hands of organised crime.
Some Indian communities have begun
 to manufacture their own cigarettes, and
contraband products are starting t
o find their way on to retailers' shelves
in counterfeit packaging.
The read
y availability of cheap, smuggled cigarettes is also believed to
have booste
d consumption. Contraband packs carry less prominent health
warnings.
Ottawa
 and the provinces have so far failed to agree on a co-ordinated tax
cut. On
tario, which collects CDollars 800m a year from tobacco taxes and is
struggl
ing to contain a yawning budget deficit, is reluctant to forfeit a
sizeable 
source of revenue.
But the smuggling issue has gained a political dimension 
in Quebec, where
separatists argue that the francophone province could easil
y put a stop to
the trade if it had greater autonomy from Ottawa.
Tobacco ma
nufacturers estimate that taxes on cigarettes will have to be
chopped by abo
ut two-thirds to compete with contraband goods.
They are also banking on a r
ise in US cigarette taxes within the next year
to narrow the price gap betwe
en the two countries.

<HEADLINE> FT  11 JUN 93 / Asians challenge west on human rights 
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>    By KIERAN COOKE </BYLINE>
<DATELINE>    KUALA LUMPUR
 </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A CONFRONTATION is looming between the west and Asia on 
human rights.
Next week a United Nations world conference on human rights - 
only the
second of its kind since the second world war - opens in Vienna.
Se
veral Asian governments say they intend using the conference to expose
what 
they consider to be western hypocrisy and selectivity on human rights
questi
ons. In particular they seem intent on confronting a new US
administration w
hich they feel is intent on increasingly linking human
rights and trade and 
aid issues.
Malaysia and Singapore have been making the running in articulat
ing the
so-called Asian approach to human rights questions. This encompasses
 two
main elements:
Cultural relativism. While accepting certain basic human
 rights, such as the
right against arbitrary killing and torture, human righ
ts should also
reflect local cultural and historical factors.
Singapore offi
cials accuse the west of arrogantly imposing its concepts of
human rights on
 the rest of the world. They say the west's smugness must be
punctured and c
ontradictions of its position exposed. Asia must have a
different approach: 
it should carefully sift through western inspired ideas
on human rights to f
ind elements acceptable in the local context.
Malaysia says it will not acce
pt finger wagging by the west. 'Each country
is entitled to its own percepti
on of human rights and forcing developing
countries to follow the western pe
rception is unfair and unjust,' says Mr
Musa Hitam, a leader of the Malaysia
n delegation to the conference.
Economic development. This emphasises that h
uman rights cannot be divorced
from economic development. At a conference in
 Bangkok earlier this year
Asian countries signed a declaration saying econo
mic development was 'a
universal and inalienable right and an integral part 
of fundamental human
rights'.
'Malaysia views development as very basic to h
uman rights,' says Mr Musa.
'Civil and political rights should come almost a
utomatically after
development has been achieved.'
Both these ideas are like
ly to come under fire in Vienna. Human rights
groups dispute that there is a
 consensus among Asian countries on the issue:
for instance, they say, Japan
 differed radically with China on human rights
at the Bangkok conference.
Ms
 Sidney Jones, of the human rights body Asia Watch, says human rights must
b
e seen as an international issue. 'If governments and their security forces

are primarily responsible for human rights abuses, it is illusory to think
t
hat the same governments are best equipped to protect human rights ..the
onl
y possible way ..is to acknowledge from the outset that responsibility
for p
rotection transcends national boundaries.'
Amnesty International accuses gov
ernments in Asia of condemning the Vienna
conference to failure. Mr Pierre S
ane, Amnesty's secretary general, says
many governments in Asia consider int
ernational protection and monitoring of
human rights as interference and an 
attempt by the west to cut their
competitiveness.
'What is at stake here is 
the rights of the workers in Asia,' says Mr Sane.
'If they are respected, pr
oducts coming from Asia will be more expensive.
And therefore the economic c
ompetitiveness of countries like China,
Indonesia, Malaysia - the new and em
erging tigers - will be threatened.
'It is a very linear concept of developm
ent whereby you fill the bellies
first, and then you provide people with fre
edom,' says Mr Sane. 'Maybe 100
years ago the universal consciousness could 
accept that to industrialise you
crush a whole generation. But it is not acc
eptable in 1993.'

<HEADLINE> FT  08 SEP 92 / Smuggled Russian diamonds stoke upset 
in market </HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>    By LEYLA BOULTON </BYLINE>
<DATELINE>    M
OSCOW </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DIAMOND SMUGGLING from Russia is adding to the turm
oil in the market for the
precious stone, De Beers admitted yesterday, but t
he group, which controls
80 per cent of world trade in rough (uncut) diamond
s, said it had no clear
idea of the extent of the leakage.
Mr Gary Ralfe, th
e De Beers director responsible for liaison with the
Russians, said it was i
mpossible to tell how many diamonds were being
smuggled from the former Sovi
et Union.
He believed the smuggling was taking place without the sanction of
 the
government authorities and that the Russian problem was nothing compare
d
with the illicit flood of diamonds out of Angola where an estimated Dollar
s
1m worth a day are being smuggled to Antwerp.
He said he understood some r
ough gems were being smuggled out by joint
ventures which only had the right
 to export polished stones. Mr Ralfe said
he could not disclose official fig
ures for Russian diamond output but denied
one suggestion that production ha
d fallen from 11m to 4m carats. 'We sell
well in excess of 4m carats a year.
'
It also became clear yesterday De Beers faces competition from Japan in
Ya
kutia, where 99 per cent of Russian diamonds are mined and where it hopes
to
 help set up a cutting centre.
In any case, the South African group is not c
onfident of its grip on the
Russian diamonds business and therefore wants to
 reconfirm its existing
five-year contract which gives it a virtual monopoly
 of Russia's rough
diamond exports.
De Beers concluded an agreement in 1990 
which gives its Central Selling
Organisation exclusive rights to sell Russia
n rough diamonds exports until
1995. It advanced a Dollars 1bn loan to the f
ormer Soviet Union against
stockpiled diamonds which were moved to London.
T
hough Russia has continued to abide by the terms of the deal the agreement
h
as often been called into question. Mr Nicky Oppenheimer, De Beers deputy
ch
airman, said: 'We hope that uncertainty in the diamond market will be
ended 
by a pronouncement of the diamond commission which should show that
CSO is R
ussia's best opportunity.'

<HEADLINE> FT  03 AUG 94 / Reality threatens to overcome China-T
aiwan rivalry / Preview of talks between Beijing and Taipei that may for the
 first time address the issue of direct sea and air links </HEADLINE>
<BYLIN
E>    By LAURA TYSON </BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Village chief Huang, who has spent mos
t of his 64 years fishing out of
Nanliao, a small port on the north-west coa
st of Taiwan, is angry. Since the
government cracked down on a brisk trade i
n smuggling goods between the
island and China a few years ago, local fisher
men are having a tough time
making ends meet.
'The government should just le
galise direct shipping with China and make
those smugglers pay tax, like the
y do on the mainland side,' complains Mr
Huang. 'That's a much better way to
 manage things. Instead, they send the
fishermen to jail, burn their boats a
nd the police confiscate the goods for
themselves. This is totally unreasona
ble. Besides, it isn't really smuggling
anyway; it's domestic trade.'
Even a
s Mr Huang was speaking, officials from rival governments in Taipei
and Beij
ing were preparing to hold high-level talks in which, Taiwanese
newspapers h
ave suggested, Taipei may for the first time address the issue
of resuming d
irect sea and air links to China.
Taiwan's Nationalist government has banned
 the san tung or 'three directs' -
transportation, trade and post - with Chi
na since 1949, when General Chiang
Kai-shek fled to the island after losing 
a civil war to Mao Zedong's
communist forces.
Fast-growing cross-strait trad
e is mostly funneled through Hong Kong. But
smuggling and illegal fishing in
 the Taiwan Strait surged once the
government lifted martial law and began t
o relax coastal defence operations
in 1987.
Positioned at the narrowest poin
t along the strait, Nanliao became a
smuggling hub. To traverse the 70-odd n
autical miles to Pingtan on the coast
of China's Fujian province takes 10 ho
urs by fishing boat, three to four
hours by cruiser, or less than two hours 
by speedboat.
Lured by high returns, local fishermen plied the waters in woo
den boats
laden with contraband ranging from liquor, cigarettes and medicine
s, to
narcotics from betel to heroin and human cargo which has found its way
 to
shores as far-flung as New York. Judging by the number of Mercedes-Benze
s
and BMWs on the sleepy byways of Nanliao, some locals profited handsomely

before Taiwan's maritime police swooped on Nanliao.
Cross-strait smuggling h
as simply been diverted elsewhere, mainly along
Taiwan's northern coast. An 
estimated 200 fishing boats make the crossing
each day. Smuggled Chinese pro
ducts can be found in markets and 30,000
mainlanders are illegally living on
 the island.
From tomorrow, Taiwan's chief China negotiator, Mr Chiao Jen-ho
, will begin
four days of talks with his counterpart from Beijing, Mr Tang S
hubei. Little
progress has been made in five previous quasi-official cross-s
trait
discussions since ground-breaking meetings in April 1993. But the stal
emate
in political relations belies resurgent economic ties, driven by cultu
ral
and family connections as well as the search by Taiwan businessmen for c
heap
labour, land, raw materials and markets. Taiwanese investment in China 
is
estimated at more than Dollars 15bn (Pounds 9.6bn).
Taiwan officials pred
ict that Hong Kong, the main conduit, will soon
supplant the US as the islan
d's biggest export market. In the first half of
this year, shipments to the 
US accounted for 25.9 per cent of total exports,
down 1.8 per cent from a ye
ar earlier. Exports to the British colony jumped
11.2 per cent to account fo
r 22.9 per cent of outbound shipments. Most
shipments headed for Hong Kong a
re destined for China.
A leading Chinese businessman visited the island last
 week under the guise
of promoting cross-strait golfing exchanges. Mr Wang J
un, president of the
China International Trust and Investment Corp (Citic), 
China's leading
international business conglomerate, met with senior figures
 in politics and
business.
Mr Wang's low-profile tour of the island included
 a trip to Taichung
harbour, which is preparing for the advent of cross-stra
it shipping. It is
perhaps no coincidence that Citic and Bechtel Enterprises
, the finance and
development arm of the engineering group, last week jointl
y announced a port
development plan at Daxie Island, about 100 miles south o
f Shanghai.
So far, Taipei has refused to discuss direct links on the ground
s that
Beijing must first recognise Taiwan as a sovereign government. China

continues to regard Taiwan as a renegade province. But as economic ties
betw
een the two sides grow, so too does pressure from Taiwan's business
communit
y, making it increasingly difficult for Taipei to stave off the
inevitable.

The ministry of transportation and communications promised early last month

to produce a report by mid-1995 outlining technical aspects of direct sea
an
d air links with China. This is probably little more than a stalling
techniq
ue, as the ministry has already been studying the matter for years.
But the 
government knows it must come to grips with the issue before June 30
1997, w
hen Hong Kong reverts to Chinese sovereignty, for then there can be
no more 
pretence of keeping China at arm's length.

<TEXT>
The Vietnamese government has admitted that a year-long campaign aga
inst
corruption among state employees is having little impact and that corru
ption
is costing the country tens of millions of dollars.
Mr Bui Thien Ngo, 
interior minister, told the National Assembly that
measures to fight corrupt
ion had brought about no significant changes and
the situation remained seri
ous. He said efforts to curb smuggling were
failing although more than 17,00
0 cases of smuggling have been uncovered so
far this year.
Officials say goo
ds smuggled in from China and Cambodia are damaging
domestic industry and lo
sing the government revenue. The fight against
corruption and smuggling has 
been a recurring theme for the past year and Mr
Vo Van Kiet, prime minister,
 has made curbing corruption among officials a
personal crusade.
Appeals for
 more vigilance and more efforts to curb corruption are part of a
political 
battle now being waged in Hanoi over the pace of economic reforms.
The more 
conservative members of the assembly and Communist party officials
say corru
ption and other social ills are a result of rapid economic reforms.

Is there a hint of 
cannibalism about eating an animal that has been
genetically engineered to i
nclude human genes?
Should a Moslem or Jew avoid meat from a cow that includ
es pig genes? Can
vegetarians eat plants containing animal genes?
Such quest
ions may sound like absurd moral speculation. But biotechnology is
moving so
 fast that the world's religious and ethical thinkers will soon
have to give
 practical advice on genetically modified foods.
Some preliminary advice cam
e yesterday from the UK government's Ethical
Committee on Genetic Modificati
on of Food. It found 'no overriding ethical
objections' to foods incorporati
ng copies of human genes, but recommended
that products containing human and
 other 'ethically sensitive' genes be
labelled clearly to allow consumers to
 make an informed choice.
The committee of six was chaired by John Polkingho
rne, president of Queens'
College, Cambridge, who is an ordained scientist. 
It consulted widely among
different religious groups and others who feel str
ongly about food purity.
Its report concludes that a human gene inserted int
o another species should
not be regarded as human material. This is partly b
ecause what is
transplanted is not an original human gene but a copy of one 
- and, to make
the point, the committee uses throughout the report the cumbe
rsome phrase
'copy genes of human origin'.
In any case, the report says, the
 gene loses its human character outside the
context of a human cell.
Experim
ental transgenic animals with human genes already exist - for example
sheep 
that make Factor IX, the blood-clotting protein, for haemophiliacs.
Such ani
mals are far too valuable to reach the meat market today. But
surplus transg
enic sheep - those that do not make enough human protein for
pharmaceutical 
use - may be sold for food at some point in the future.

cal Committee on Genetic Modification of Food, HMSO,

<TEXT>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl will send a special envoy to 
Moscow to find out how
nuclear material is being smuggled into Germany after
 police in Bavaria last
week seized 50 grams of enriched plutonium carried o
n a recent Lufthansa
flight from Moscow to Munich. It was the third seizure 
in four months of
weapons-grade material from the former Soviet bloc and con
firmed fears that
Germany has become the main transit route for such smuggli
ng since the end
of the cold war opened a black market for nuclear contraban
d from the east.
Speaking on German television last night, Mr Kohl said he w
ould also speak
to President Boris Yeltsin to seek help in tightening up sec
urity. 'Every
possible step must be taken to prevent such things from happen
ing in the
future,' he said. At the same time, Mr Klaus Kinkel, the foreign 
minister,
yesterday told Bild am Sonntag newspaper that a 'new control syste
m for
plutonium' should be set up. 'Travelling salesmen with nuclear suitcas
es
pose a new atomic danger,' he said. Police told Der Spiegel magazine, whi
ch
broke the story, that the smuggling of weapons-grade nuclear materials co
uld
have been organised by Libyan, Iranian, or Iraqi diplomats.

<HEADLINE> FT  27 JAN 94 / UK is odd man out in China diplomacy:
 Beijing eases conflicts with other security council members </HEADLINE>
<BY
LINE>    By TONY WALKER </BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Chinese foreign minister Qian 
Qichen concluded a visit to Paris this
week, he achieved more than simply re
storing equilibrium to a troubled
relationship.
The Sino-French rapprochemen
t means that China has now reduced the number of
serious diplomatic conflict
s with fellow members of the world's most
exclusive club, the UN Security Co
uncil, to one - its dispute with Britain
over Hong Kong.
Nothing could have 
contrasted more sharply than the emollient words uttered
in Paris at the con
clusion of Mr Qian's visit and the continuing sour
exchanges between Beijing
 and London.
Indeed, troubled Sino-British relations appear to have taken a 
further turn
for the worse with the row over the financing of the new Hong K
ong airport
flaring up in a way that does not augur well for amicable resolu
tion.
China's warning that it would refuse to honour after 1997 financing fo
r the
new HKDollars 160bn (Pounds 13.9bn) airport project threatens to strik
e at
the heart of arrangements for a smooth transfer of power. No other capi
tal
works project is as important to Hong Kong's integration with the mainla
nd,
and the colony's future economic well-being.
Britain's problems with Chi
na have also been cast in starker relief in
recent days by the conspicuous i
mprovement in fractious Sino-US relations
after Washington's decision last S
eptember to end the 'downward spiral' in
its dealings with the People's Repu
blic.
Since the Clinton administration resolved to 're-engage' China, a stea
dy
stream of senior American officials has passed through Beijing, culminati
ng
in the visit last week of Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary.
Th
ese visits have also been accompanied by tangible progress on bothersome
iss
ues, including trade disputes, smuggling and illegal immigration. The
signin
g this month, after reasonably amicable negotiations, of a three-year
textil
e quota agreement attested to an improved working relationship.
Efforts to l
ay the groundwork for renewal by President Clinton of most
favoured nation (
MFN) trading status for China by obliging Beijing to
address the human right
s issue appear to be making progress; but US
officials say that China is sti
ll some distance away from meeting Mr
Clinton's criteria of 'overall, signif
icant improvement' on human rights.
In Paris this week, China appeared to ma
ke an important concession by
agreeing to discuss for the first time specifi
c US concerns about 235
political prisoners. That undertaking came at a meet
ing between Mr Qian and
Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state.
Wh
ile Mr Christopher repeated a standard administration line after his
session
 with Mr Qian that China had not met the criteria for continued
preferential
 access to the US market, there is no doubt that odds on MFN
renewal have sh
ortened.
'This meeting has carried the process forward but we also believe t
here is
considerable work to be done,' said Mr Winston Lord, assistant secre
tary of
state, former US ambassador to Beijing and chief architect of the Cl
inton
administration's policy on China.
A western official in Beijing said t
hat while human rights issues were
certain to continue to bedevil China's de
alings with the west, there were
tentative signs that Beijing may at last be
 recognising that it could not
continue to stonewall western pressures.
'The
 Americans may have finally convinced the Chinese of the US domestic
reality
, and that they will have to do something tangible on human rights,'
he said
. 'The cynical release of a few prisoners on the eve of the MFN
decision sim
ply won't fly any more.'
China's fence-mending with both the French and the 
Americans also coincides
with the visit to Beijing this week of Mr Andrei Ko
zyrev, the Russian
foreign minister at the head of a mission which includes 
defence experts.
China is seeking increased Russian assistance in the develo
pment of its
defence industries. It is also anxious to further expand and re
gulate
booming border trade. Total trade between Russia and China increased 
by 30
per cent last year compared with 1993. Eighty per cent of this trade i
s
conducted through some 20 border crossings.
For the Russians, no less than
 for the Americans and French, access to the
booming China market is the eng
ine driving diplomatic relations. France's
decision to foreswear further arm
s sales to Taiwan as the price of better
China relations - what France's Pre
sident Francois Mitterrand described as a
'new orientation' - is recognition
 of China's growing economic clout.
For London, mired in a seemingly intract
able dispute over Hong Kong, the
unhappy prospect is for continued sour exch
anges with Beijing, accompanied
by the risk of damage to UK commercial prosp
ects. Emboldened by its success
in forcing France to stop new arms sales to 
Taiwan, and assuming that it
clears the MFN hurdle, Beijing is even less lik
ely to yield ground over Hong
Kong.

<HEADLINE> FT  24 MAR 93 / Bombay police find arms cache: Sixteen
 held since bomb attacks </HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>    By STEFAN WAGSTYL </BYLINE>

<DATELINE>    BOMBAY </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDIAN police investigating the bom
b blasts which rocked Bombay earlier this
month yesterday discovered a huge 
cache of arms including 600 detonators,
195 hand grenades, rifles and ammuni
tion.
The discovery is the latest development in a wide-ranging probe involv
ing
the Indian intelligence service, as well as Interpol and anti-terrorist

experts from the US and other countries.
The Bombay police have detained 16 
people in connection with the blasts,
which left about 250 people dead and o
ver 1,000 injured in the biggest
terrorist attack in Indian history. The exp
losions followed riots in Bombay
and other cities which came in the wake of 
the destruction of a mosque in
the holy town of Ayodhya by Hindu militants.

However, those detained by the Bombay police are seen as minor participants

in the attacks: they include men who allegedly drove bomb-laden cars to
blas
t sites and dealers who supplied the vehicles.
The police have yet to arrest
 anybody thought to be an organiser of the
attack; norhave they publicly ide
ntified any group as a possible party to
the incident, though they strongly 
believe that the explosives used were
supplied from overseas. Police officia
ls have declined to comment on the
suspicion - widely held in Bombay - that 
an Islamic fundamentalist group
could have organised the attacks in revenge 
for Ayodhya.
However, the police want to question two Indian Moslem brothers
, the alleged
leaders of smuggling rings, who left the country just before t
he blasts.
They are Mr Mushtaq Memon, known as 'Tiger', and his elder brothe
r Yakub.
The two flew with their families to Dubai. From there they have fle
d to
another Moslem country, believed to be Pakistan.
In New Delhi, Mr P V N
arasimha Rao, prime minister, yesterday beat off a
challenge to his authorit
y from Mr Arjun Singh, minister for human
resources. Acting before a nationa
l conference this weekend of the ruling
Congress (I) party, Mr Singh had que
stioned if Mr Rao was being aggressive
enough against the right-wing Hindu B
haratiya Janata party, whose supporters
stormed the Ayodhya mosque.

<HEADLINE> FT  28 NOV 92 / Serbs' human wall keeps UN aid from Mo
slems: Laura Silber reports from Bajina Basta, where angry villagers have ha
lted a food convoy to a besieged town </HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>    By LAURA SILBE
R and Agencies </BYLINE>
<DATELINE>    Sarajevo </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HOPE of e
mergency aid reaching Srebrenica, a besieged Moslem town in eastern
Bosnia, 
receded yesterday after Bosnian Serb commanders sent a UN convoy on
a wild g
oose chase.
The UN, blocked for three days, suffered another setback in its 
third
attempt to reach Srebrenica. Once again, this time in Bajina Basta, lo
cal
Serbs formed a human wall on a bridge over the River Drina, linking Bosn
ia
with Serbia, in order to block food from reaching tens of thousands of
Mo
slems.
The 20-lorry convoy was instead forced to take a new route down a win
ding
road in the Drina river valley, 30 miles south of the previous, more di
rect
route to the besieged Moslem stronghold.
In every town where the convoy
 was blocked, similar events took place.
Villagers screamed and jeered. Old 
women brandished sticks. One even waved
an axe at journalists. Volleys of gu
nfire boomed in the surrounding hills as
locals accused the Moslems of roast
ing their Serb victims on a spit. They
said the convoy of the UN High Commis
sioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was
smuggling weapons in the food packages.
In o
ther villages, weeping Serb women said the fresh graves were the reason
why 
they would never let the convoy reach one of the last pockets of Moslem
resi
stance. 'While we are alive, this convoy will never pass,' said
Andriana, 17
, a student. 'Most of my friends are buried in the cemetery.
They were just 
a year older than me.'
Officials of the UNHCR patiently reiterated that aid 
must be given out to
all sides in the Bosnian war. But shabbily-clad Serb vi
llagers defiantly
insisted: 'We don't need your help.'
The UNHCR since July 
has delivered 85 tonnes of aid to the town of 3,000
people. Last week, the U
N severed aid to Serb-held territory in eastern
Bosnia until access is given
 to Moslem towns.
Bosnian Serb commanders told UN officials that the new rou
te to Srebrenica
in any case was an unusable dirt track. A UN reconnaissance
 team later
confirmed that armoured personnel carriers and 10-tonne aid lorr
ies would
get stuck.
Agreement for the convoy to take this new route was won
 after Serb
commanders appeared to climb down in their war of nerves with th
e UN. But as
the convoy commanders yesterday waited for the go-ahead, it app
eared the
Serbs had won again.
An angry Bosnian Serb soldier asked why the w
orld tells lies about Serbs. He
gestured at the crowd of 200 people, saying 
'everyone has lost a son or a
husband'. The crowd waved placards in English 
saying: 'Don't feed our enemy'
referring to the Moslems of Srebrenica, five 
miles away over the hillside.
Across the river in Serbia, UN peacekeepers es
corting the convoy set up camp
in a cattle market as they awaited orders to 
head for Srebrenica, the only
Bosnian town to have received no aid since the
 war erupted in April.
British, Danish and Belgium peacekeepers sat eating F
rench army rations and
sipping French wine while UN officials and commanders
 in Sarajevo tried to
pressure Serb commanders into letting the convoy throu
gh.
While weeping Serb villagers seemed genuinely distressed, a UN soldier s
aid
the blockade of the convoy belonged to a military strategy. 'The Serb
mi
litary obviously intends to starve the Moslems and then take the town.'
Bosn
ian Serbs and leaders of Croatia's regular forces have agreed a
ceasefire fr
om midnight tomorrow, according to Mr Radovan Karadzic, the
Bosnian Serb lea
der, agencies report from Sarajevo.
He denied this amounted to a Serb-Croat 
'carve-up' of Bosnia at the expense
of Moslems.

<HEADLINE> FT  14 APR 92 / US gene research supremo resigns </HE
ADLINE>
<BYLINE>    By DANIEL GREEN </BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUPPORTERS of controver
sial efforts to patent human genes won a victory at
the weekend with the res
ignation of Mr James Watson as head of the US
government's human gene resear
ch project.
Mr Watson, a Nobel prize winner for his part in discovering the 
DNA double
helix, is an outspoken opponent of recent attempts to patent piec
es of human
genes.
The issue has divided scientific communities in the US, J
apan and Europe
which are mapping all 100,000 genes in the human body. At st
ake is the
potential for billions of dollars of revenue from buyers of genet
ic
information, such as drug companies
Mr Watson was director of the Human G
enome Project, the Washington-based
federal research organisation. The proje
ct is part of the National Institute
of Health (NIH), the US federal agency 
which is spending more than Dollars
150m (Pounds 87.2m) a year on the 20-yea
r programme. The EC and Japan are
each putting in about one fifth as much ag
ain into the same project at local
research establishments.
Mr Watson's resi
gnation comes at the same time as an inquiry by the NIH
ethics officer into 
a potential conflict of interest because of his
shareholdings in biotechnolo
gy companies. However, many believe he left
because of policy differences wi
th Ms Bernadine Healy, who became director
of the NIH last year.
Mr Watson h
anded in his resignation on Friday saying it would allow Ms Healy
'to appoin
t her own director' of the Genome project.
Debate over the patenting of huma
n genes reached a head last summer after a
US laboratory filed, under the au
spices of the NIH, 347 patents for pieces
of human DNA.
'Virtually all scien
tists have opposed this,' said Sir Walter Bodmer,
president of the Human Gen
ome Organisation, which co-ordinates human genome
research globally.

<HEADLINE> FT  28 AUG 92 / UN troops in former Yugoslavia should 
expand human rights mandate </HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>    By FRANCES WILLIAMS </BY

<DATELINE>    GENEVA </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UNITED NATIONS troops in the f
ormer Yugoslavia should have an expanded human
rights mandate, Mr Tadeusz Ma
zowiecki, said yesterday, writes Frances
Williams in Geneva. The former Poli
sh premier, appointed UN special human
rights investigator this month, said 
he would also recommend the setting up
of an international commission to inv
estigate atrocities.
Human rights were 'totally non-existent' in Bosnia, he 
said after a five-day
tour which took in Zagreb and Vukovar in Croatia, Banj
a Luka, Bihac and
Sarajevo in Bosnia, and Belgrade, the Serbian capital. Cit
ing world inaction
after earlier reports of gross human rights abuses, he to
ld reporters in
Geneva that what mattered was ending the war and the atrocit
ies. The
international community had to provide 'effective help and effectiv
e
remedies'.
His preliminary report to the UN Human Rights Commission, due t
o be sent to
the 53 members today, would include a recommendation to enlarge
 the mandate
of UN forces to report, and perhaps act to prevent, human right
s abuses,
which they cannot now do.

<HEADLINE> FT  23 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Diamond gl
oom lifts as Angolan smuggling eases </HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>    By KENNETH GOOD
ING </BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE THREAT of civil war in Angola and growing consumer 
confidence in the US
is lifting some of the gloom from the diamond market.
T
he flood of smuggled rough (uncut) diamonds from Angola, which was severely

destabilising the market, has slowed to a trickle. Also official production

by Angola's state-owned Endiama group has come to a halt following renewed
t
ension and fighting between government forces and the Unita movement.
At one
 time an estimated 50,000 private enterprise diggers were picking up
diamond
s from dried-up river beds in Angola. The stones were smuggled out
mainly to
 Antwerp where De Beers, which controls 80 per cent of world-wide
rough diam
ond sales, attempted to keep the market stable by buying them for
its stockp
ile.
At the height of the rush De Beers' buyer in Antwerp mopped up nearly
D
ollars 40m-worth in one week and the group estimates about Dollars 500m of
s
tones were smuggled out of Angola this year, representing a sudden 10 per
ce
nt addition to world supply.
However, most of the unofficial diggers disappe
ared when political tension
in Angola was renewed after elections in Septemb
er and the Unita forces
withdrew to their stronghold in the southern provinc
es, including the Lunda
Norte diamond district.
After fighting broke out las
t month, sub-contractors who mine on Endiama's
behalf withdrew all their per
sonnel. Last year Angola's official diamond
production was in the region of 
1m carats, worth about Dollars 100m.
Coming at a time when demand was weaken
ing in the biggest diamond markets -
the US and Japan - because of recession
, the Angolan smuggling has been
putting a severe strain on De Beers' financ
ial resources and its ability to
stop a precipitous fall in rough diamond pr
ices.
De Beers has told the producers whose stones it markets that it can ta
ke
only 75 per cent of the agreed quota and has also severely restricted the

diamonds releases to the market via merchants at its monthly 'sights'.
Some
 traders suggest that, consequently, rough diamond prices are getting
firmer
 and there are even some shortages of particular types of polished
stones. '
Rough (diamond) buyers say the market is now in balance rather than
a buyer'
s market as it was a few weeks ago,' said Mr Mark Cockle, editor of
the Diam
ond International magazine.

<HEADLINE> FT  03 MAR 93 / Business and the Environment: Paraguay
's parrots get the last word - John Barham describes how the country is crac
king down on the illegal trade in live animals </HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>    By JO
HN BARHAM </BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Good news about the trade in endangered species i
s rare, especially when it
comes from Paraguay, where the illegal trade in l
ive animals, birds and
skins flourished for decades.
During the 35-year regi
me of General Alfredo Stroessner, corruption and
contraband were central to 
Paraguay's political system. Paraguayans hunted
down caymans in wildlife ref
uges by the hundreds of thousands to sell their
skins.
The capital, Asuncion
, became a centre of the shady international trade in
live parrots, snakes a
nd monkeys, though it was banned under Paraguayan law
and international trea
ties. What is more, the smugglers moved in the same
underworld as gun-runner
s, drug traders and car thieves.
But in 1989, a military coup toppled Stroes
sner and Paraguay began making
rapid, if uncertain, strides towards democrac
y. The government is anxious to
improve Paraguay's dreadful image by taking 
action over human rights
violations, corruption, smuggling and the illegal t
rade in animals.
During the last 18 months, Paraguay has sharpened its envir
onmental laws and
promoted determined, honest individuals. The result is mor
e seizures of
skins and live animals that were once openly traded. Rich and 
powerful
merchants find their links to the military no longer provide immuni
ty.
Even the Swiss-based United Nations' Convention on International Trade i
n
Endangered Species (Cites), once a bitter critic, now recognises Paraguay 
is
improving. Obdulio Menghi, Cites' scientific co-ordinator, says the
Parag
uayans 'are working like never before, because of the professional and
polit
ical (commitment) that the country has assumed for the first time'.
Change h
as come almost entirely as a result of intense international
pressure from g
roups such as Cites. Luz Aquino-Shuster, head of the
government's Cites liai
son office, says: 'When I went to conferences, I
would be pointed at and peo
ple would say Paraguay is a bad country. It was
terrible.' Now, she gets let
ters of support. Moreover, she says: 'Biologists
are in charge now. This is 
important, because before the politicians were in
charge and they did not ca
re.'
The US Fish and Wildlife Service is advising the government on improvin
g
controls, a further sign that Paraguay's search for respectability is
some
thing more than a public relations stunt. However, the Paraguayans have
litt
le hard data to show for their work, although they do provide some
graphic a
ccounts of their seizures.
For instance, in February, Aquino's staff seized 
1,125 skins, coats, belts
and shoes from a trader. They also fined a shop se
lling illegal furs and
skins Dollars 37,500 (Pounds 26,600) - a princely sum
 by local standards.
Since then, traders have become warier and seizures les
s frequent.
Furthermore, some foreign governments caution that Paraguay's im
provement is
overrated, warning that corruption and smuggling still continue
, if only
with greater discretion.
Nonetheless, the government is co-ordinat
ing wildlife control operations
with the army, police and customs, since the
 trade in animals is part of a
wider underground market in drugs, arms and s
tolen cars. It is also
sponsoring an environmental law in congress and Aquin
o hopes that smuggling
animals - at present a civil offence - will be made c
riminal.
Falling international prices have made her work easier. Hunters hav
e glutted
the market and demand in once lucrative Asian markets is declining
.
Warehouses around the world are stacked with enough cayman, iguana and boa

constrictor skins to last many years.
There is still a lot to be done. Meng
hi says: 'You have to struggle
permanently against contraband, whether of an
imals, drugs or arms.' And
several important European markets are still impo
rting animals and skins, to
the Paraguayans' fury.
Clamping down on smugglin
g hits peasants and Indians, who are used to
supplementing their incomes wit
h hunting. Experienced hunters can easily
catch a pair of adult parrots or s
hoot between 15 and 20 caymans a day,
although they are paid very little. It
 is the middlemen who reap the
profits: a parrot can retail for up to Dollar
s 10,000 in Los Angeles.
The government is trying to ease this problem by al
lowing controlled exports
of a few species whose numbers are not in danger. 
The main candidate for
'rational exploitation' is the heavily hunted Teyu Gu
azu iguana, whose skin
is used to make handbags, belts and cowboy boots. In 
1980-85, between 1.5m
and 3.6m Teyu Guazu were exported.
Closer co-operation
 is needed at regional level. Paraguay's neighbour,
Argentina, is often crit
icised for lax controls and its security and
conservation forces lack co-ord
ination. Smugglers habitually exploit its
generous export licences to 'laund
er' species hunted in Bolivia, Brazil and
Paraguay. However, Menghi says eve
n Argentina is improving its controls.
However praiseworthy these efforts ma
y be, they do little to alleviate the
destruction of habitats, the principal
 threat to wildlife. The situation is
worsening by the day, as Paraguay's fo
rests are cut down and farmers
encroach on virgin territory.

<HEADLINE> FT  07 JUN 93 / Eight die as freighter runs aground </
HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>    By NIKKI TAIT </BYLINE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK </DATEL

<TEXT>
AT LEAST eight people died early yesterday morning after a freig
hter,
believed to be carrying hundreds of illegal Chinese immigrants, ran ag
round
close to Rockaway beaches in the Queens borough of New York City.
The 
grounding of the freighter, the Golden Venture, happened shortly after
2am y
esterday. More than 100 Chinese passengers plunged into the chilly
waters, a
nd swam about half a mile to the shore.
According to emergency rescue worker
s, who reached the scene shortly
afterwards, four passengers were known to h
ave died on the beach, and
another two in hospital later. Two bodies were al
so washed ashore.
By late afternoon officials said that they had accounted f
or about 300
people. Many of those who swam ashore were said to be suffering
 from
exposure or hypothermia, and about 20 had been taken to hospital. Ther
e were
also growing fears that tuberculosis may have been prevalent on the v
essel.
Initial pictures released by the US Coast Guard of the freighter's in
terior
suggested that conditions had been extremely cramped and squalid. How
ever,
officials still lacked a firm indication of the number of people who h
ad
been aboard the ship.
Interpreters who were called to the scene said that
 some passengers claimed
to have been aboard the freighter for more than 100
 days. They also reported
that it made a number of stops in China before cro
ssing the ocean. This
fuelled rumours that the ship was operated by an Asian
 'human smuggling'
ring, which had charged passengers Dollars 20,000-Dollars
 30,000 for the
journey.
Mr William Slattery, New York district director for
 immigration and
naturalisation, said the immigrants were mostly Chinese fro
m Fukien
province.
The 11 crew members were still being questioned by the US
 authorities last
night, while their passengers were placed in the custody o
f the US
Immigration and Naturalisation Service. All are understood to have 
asked for
political asylum.
The vessel itself remained stranded on a sand-ba
nk. However, the local Coast
Guard reported that it was up against a 'rock j
etty', and expressed concern
that an oil spill might develop. The ship was c
arrying about five tons of
diesel fuel.
Illegal Chinese immigration has been
 on the rise in New York City, but this
is believed to be the first time a v
essel carrying such a large number of
passengers has disgorged its load on t
he city's shoreline.

<TEXT>
INTERIOR ministers from 35 European countries yesterday agreed to c
rack down
on the wave of illegal immigration from east to west which is fuel
ling
anti-foreigner violence in Germany and elsewhere.
The ministers said or
ganised smuggling of illegal immigrants would be made a
criminal offence acr
oss Europe. They also agreed that airlines, as well as
land and sea carriers
, should be liable to fines under new rules on the
movement of illegal alien
s.
The conference of ministers from east and western Europe follows pressure

for co-ordinated efforts to reduce an increasing flow of illegal immigratio
n
that ministers say has fuelled xenophobia and been exploited by organised

crime.
The ministers agreed to set up special police units and mobile survei
llance
forces to a standard model. The governments also agreed to exchange
i
nformation and adopt a common code on border checks.
But ministers from seve
ral countries including Britain, balked at the German
demand for a common co
de on repatriation and on sharing the financial
burdens of combating illegal
 immigration.
The outcome of the meeting yesterday displayed the limits of p
an-European
co-operation on paying for immigration. Interests diverge: Germa
ny, Austria,
Switzerland and Sweden have borne the brunt of the influx from 
eastern
Europe and are pushing for action, while their neighbours to the wes
t are
more concerned about migrants from other continents.
Germany sought ye
sterday to allay the fears of Poland and the Czech Republic
that they would 
become part of a 'refugee zone' if Germany turned back more
asylum seekers. 
Last week, Bonn offered Warsaw DM55m (Pounds 23m) to finance
refugee camps.

Attention will now turn to sub-regional initiatives, particularly bilateral

talks with neighbouring Poland and the Czech Republic.
Mr Rudolf Seiters, Ge
rman interior minister, yesterday gave early March as
the date for the next 
round of talks with Poland on financial aid in
exchange for providing transi
t for rejected asylum-seekers before
repatriation. He also announced talks s
oon in Prague on a multilateral
approach to expelling illegal immigrants.

<HEADLINE> FT  28 JUL 93 / US tightens immigration curbs </HEADL
INE>
<BYLINE>    By GEORGE GRAHAM </BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton ye
sterday launched a programme to tighten US
immigration controls and clamp do
wn on smuggling rings that bring foreigners
into the country illegally.
He a
sked Congress for Dollars 172m to hire up to 600 more border patrol
agents a
nd boost efforts to stop immigrant-smugglers and intercept smuggling
ships a
t sea.
'It's certainly plain to anybody with eyes to see that the border pat
rol is
drastically understaffed, breathtakingly understaffed,' Mr Clinton sa
id.
He also called for a process of 'expedited exclusion' which would allow

officials to rule summarily on asylum requests, instead of allowing
asylum-s
eekers to stay for months while their cases are judged.
Anyone trying to smu
ggle in aliens would face anti-racketeering charges and
doubled prison sente
nces. In recent months, there have been a series of
attempts to land illegal
 immigrants by ship.
The measures have also been prompted by doubts about th
e effectiveness of US
consular officials in screening visa applicants for te
rrorist links.
There is the recent case of Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman, a milit
ant Moslem
preacher, several of whose followers have been arrested in connec
tion with
the bombing of the World Trade Centre in New York. Sheikh Omar is 
in custody
awaiting deportation proceedings, although he entered the US lega
lly on a
visa issued after a CIA review.
Mr Clinton insisted the US was not 
seeking to close its doors to legal
immigrants and would remain 'the world's
 greatest melting pot'. However, 'we
must say no to illegal immigration so w
e can continue to say yes to legal
immigration,' he said.

<HEADLINE> FT  07 JUN 93 / US fears flood of China's new slaves: 
California's latest immigration problem </HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>    By LOUISE KE
HOE and TONY WALKER </BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMMIGRATION officials in California fea
r that thousands of illegal Chinese
emigrants may be on board ships headed f
or the west coast of the US,
following the apprehension of about 500 Chinese
 landing along the coast over
the past two weeks.
Two trawlers, each carryin
g a human cargo of about 150 Chinese immigrants
packed into the holds, were 
seized earlier this week as they landed at
fishing harbours near Monterey an
d San Francisco. The coastal vessels are
believed to have picked up their pa
ssengers five days earlier from off-shore
'mother ships' which crossed the P
acific.
Last month, in an even more brazen attempt to smuggle people into th
e US,
the Pai Sheng, a Chinese freighter, sailed under the Golden Gate Bridg
e
right into San Francisco Bay to drop off about 270 passengers at a disused

city pier. Most were detained after a chase by police and immigration agent
s
through city parks and streets.
These incidents are further evidence of wh
at US authorities say is a
large-scale smuggling operation with suspected li
nks to Asian organised
crime rings in the US and Hong Kong.
The immigrants, 
most of them men in their 20s, pay fees of between Dollars
20,000 (Pounds 13
,000) and Dollars 40,000 for their passage to the US,
according to investiga
tors. They scrape together about Dollars 1,000,
typically borrowed from rela
tives, to board the ships, and are then indebted
for the balance of their 'f
are'.
Most of the illegal immigrants set off from the coastal Chinese provin
ces of
Fujian and Guangdong. Many, however, come from China's hinterland whe
re
people feel they are being left behind by the economic boom in more
prosp
erous areas of the country. A widening economic gap between country and
city
 is contributing to the desperation of many young Chinese.
Although they com
e to the US seeking jobs and economic prosperity, the
immigrants instead bec
ome slaves to their smugglers and many resort to crime
to pay off their debt
s, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
'They are selling their
 souls. What are these people going to do to pay off
the smugglers? ' asks R
ichard Held, a FBI Special Agent in San Francisco.
'Does that mean moving he
roin or cocaine? That is a distinct possibility.'
The recent influx has rais
ed suspicions in the US of complicity by the
Chinese government in the human
 trafficking. But in Beijing officials deny
'turning a blind eye' to illegal
 emigration. 'The Chinese government has all
along been opposed to illegal e
migration and has adopted a series of
measures to stop it,' said Mr Wu Jianm
in, the Chinese foreign ministry
spokesman.
Mr Wu insisted that Chinese secu
rity organisations had 'intensified their
efforts' to stop illegal organisat
ions trafficking in immigrants.
However, some of the immigrants landing in S
an Francisco this week spoke of
paying additional fees to bribe Chinese gove
rnment officials to let them
leave the country, according to US investigator
s.
With millions of dollars being extorted from the passengers of the Chines
e
smuggling ships, it seems unlikely that the practice will end soon. So far

this year, the US Coast Guard has detained over 1,600 illegal Chinese
immig
rants, more than twice the number in 1992.
The rising numbers could, however
, reflect a change of route, rather than a
growing volume of illegal immigra
nts. US investigators speculate that the
smugglers are now cutting out 'midd
le men' in other countries and attempting
to maximise their profits by landi
ng their passengers directly on US shores.
Chinese officials charge that the
 willingness of some countries (including
the US) to grant 'political asylum
' to Chinese emigrants is encouraging
human smuggling.
Indeed, US immigratio
n lawyers representing some of the passengers of the
Pai Sheng say that they
 will seek asylum and note that the judicial process
may take as long as 10 
years, giving their clients time to seek legal US
residency.

INTERIOR ministers from 35 European countries yesterday agreed to c
rack down
on the wave of illegal immigration from east to west which is fuel
ling
anti-foreigner violence in Germany and elsewhere.
The ministers said or
ganised smuggling of illegal immigrants would be made a
criminal offence acr
oss Europe. They also agreed that airlines, as well as
land and sea carriers
, should be liable to fines under new rules on the
movement of illegal alien
s.
The conference of ministers from east and western Europe follows pressure

for co-ordinated efforts to reduce an increasing flow of illegal immigratio
n
that ministers say has fuelled xenophobia and been exploited by organised

crime.
The ministers agreed to set up special police units and mobile survei
llance
forces to a standard model. The governments also agreed to exchange
i
nformation and adopt a common code on border checks.
But ministers from seve
ral countries including Britain, balked at the German
demand for a common co
de on repatriation and on sharing the financial
burdens of combating illegal
 immigration.
The outcome of the meeting yesterday displayed the limits of p
an-European
co-operation on paying for immigration. Interests diverge: Germa
ny, Austria,
Switzerland and Sweden have borne the brunt of the influx from 
eastern
Europe and are pushing for action, while their neighbours to the wes
t are
more concerned about migrants from other continents.
Germany sought ye
sterday to allay the fears of Poland and the Czech Republic
that they would 
become part of a 'refugee zone' if Germany turned back more
asylum seekers. 
Last week, Bonn offered Warsaw DM55m (Pounds 23m) to finance
refugee camps.

Attention will now turn to sub-regional initiatives, particularly bilateral

talks with neighbouring Poland and the Czech Republic.
Mr Rudolf Seiters, Ge
rman interior minister, yesterday gave early March as
the date for the next 
round of talks with Poland on financial aid in
exchange for providing transi
t for rejected asylum-seekers before
repatriation. He also announced talks s
oon in Prague on a multilateral
approach to expelling illegal immigrants.

<HEADLINE> FT  28 JUL 93 / US tightens immigration curbs </HEADL
INE>
<BYLINE>    By GEORGE GRAHAM </BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton ye
sterday launched a programme to tighten US
immigration controls and clamp do
wn on smuggling rings that bring foreigners
into the country illegally.
He a
sked Congress for Dollars 172m to hire up to 600 more border patrol
agents a
nd boost efforts to stop immigrant-smugglers and intercept smuggling
ships a
t sea.
'It's certainly plain to anybody with eyes to see that the border pat
rol is
drastically understaffed, breathtakingly understaffed,' Mr Clinton sa
id.
He also called for a process of 'expedited exclusion' which would allow

officials to rule summarily on asylum requests, instead of allowing
asylum-s
eekers to stay for months while their cases are judged.
Anyone trying to smu
ggle in aliens would face anti-racketeering charges and
doubled prison sente
nces. In recent months, there have been a series of
attempts to land illegal
 immigrants by ship.
The measures have also been prompted by doubts about th
e effectiveness of US
consular officials in screening visa applicants for te
rrorist links.
There is the recent case of Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman, a milit
ant Moslem
preacher, several of whose followers have been arrested in connec
tion with
the bombing of the World Trade Centre in New York. Sheikh Omar is 
in custody
awaiting deportation proceedings, although he entered the US lega
lly on a
visa issued after a CIA review.
Mr Clinton insisted the US was not 
seeking to close its doors to legal
immigrants and would remain 'the world's
 greatest melting pot'. However, 'we
must say no to illegal immigration so w
e can continue to say yes to legal
immigration,' he said.

<HEADLINE> FT  07 JUN 93 / US fears flood of China's new slaves: 
California's latest immigration problem </HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>    By LOUISE KE
HOE and TONY WALKER </BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMMIGRATION officials in California fea
r that thousands of illegal Chinese
emigrants may be on board ships headed f
or the west coast of the US,
following the apprehension of about 500 Chinese
 landing along the coast over
the past two weeks.
Two trawlers, each carryin
g a human cargo of about 150 Chinese immigrants
packed into the holds, were 
seized earlier this week as they landed at
fishing harbours near Monterey an
d San Francisco. The coastal vessels are
believed to have picked up their pa
ssengers five days earlier from off-shore
'mother ships' which crossed the P
acific.
Last month, in an even more brazen attempt to smuggle people into th
e US,
the Pai Sheng, a Chinese freighter, sailed under the Golden Gate Bridg
e
right into San Francisco Bay to drop off about 270 passengers at a disused

city pier. Most were detained after a chase by police and immigration agent
s
through city parks and streets.
These incidents are further evidence of wh
at US authorities say is a
large-scale smuggling operation with suspected li
nks to Asian organised
crime rings in the US and Hong Kong.
The immigrants, 
most of them men in their 20s, pay fees of between Dollars
20,000 (Pounds 13
,000) and Dollars 40,000 for their passage to the US,
according to investiga
tors. They scrape together about Dollars 1,000,
typically borrowed from rela
tives, to board the ships, and are then indebted
for the balance of their 'f
are'.
Most of the illegal immigrants set off from the coastal Chinese provin
ces of
Fujian and Guangdong. Many, however, come from China's hinterland whe
re
people feel they are being left behind by the economic boom in more
prosp
erous areas of the country. A widening economic gap between country and
city
 is contributing to the desperation of many young Chinese.
Although they com
e to the US seeking jobs and economic prosperity, the
immigrants instead bec
ome slaves to their smugglers and many resort to crime
to pay off their debt
s, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
'They are selling their
 souls. What are these people going to do to pay off
the smugglers? ' asks R
ichard Held, a FBI Special Agent in San Francisco.
'Does that mean moving he
roin or cocaine? That is a distinct possibility.'
The recent influx has rais
ed suspicions in the US of complicity by the
Chinese government in the human
 trafficking. But in Beijing officials deny
'turning a blind eye' to illegal
 emigration. 'The Chinese government has all
along been opposed to illegal e
migration and has adopted a series of
measures to stop it,' said Mr Wu Jianm
in, the Chinese foreign ministry
spokesman.
Mr Wu insisted that Chinese secu
rity organisations had 'intensified their
efforts' to stop illegal organisat
ions trafficking in immigrants.
However, some of the immigrants landing in S
an Francisco this week spoke of
paying additional fees to bribe Chinese gove
rnment officials to let them
leave the country, according to US investigator
s.
With millions of dollars being extorted from the passengers of the Chines
e
smuggling ships, it seems unlikely that the practice will end soon. So far

this year, the US Coast Guard has detained over 1,600 illegal Chinese
immig
rants, more than twice the number in 1992.
The rising numbers could, however
, reflect a change of route, rather than a
growing volume of illegal immigra
nts. US investigators speculate that the
smugglers are now cutting out 'midd
le men' in other countries and attempting
to maximise their profits by landi
ng their passengers directly on US shores.
Chinese officials charge that the
 willingness of some countries (including
the US) to grant 'political asylum
' to Chinese emigrants is encouraging
human smuggling.
Indeed, US immigratio
n lawyers representing some of the passengers of the
Pai Sheng say that they
 will seek asylum and note that the judicial process
may take as long as 10 
years, giving their clients time to seek legal US
residency.

<HEADLINE> FT  22 JUN 93 / US Supreme Court upholds policy of for
cibly returning refugees to Haiti </HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>    By JUREK MARTIN </
BYLINE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Supreme Court yes
terday upheld the policy of successive US
administrations authorising the fo
rcible return of would-be refugees from
Haiti intercepted on the high seas.

Justice John Paul Stevens, for the 8:1 court majority, said the policy did
n
ot violate US immigration policy or any international treaty. Justice Harry

Blackmun, the sole dissenter, argued that the law was clear - 'vulnerable
re
fugees shall not be returned.'
The court ruling ends one phase of the contro
versy over Haitian refugees.
President Bill Clinton came to office promising
 to reverse the exclusionary
policies of his predecessor, but changed his mi
nd, citing the same
humanitarian reasons as had President George Bush - spec
ifically the risk
that many Haitians in unseaworthy vessels would be lost at
 sea. An estimated
37,000 Haitians have sought asylum in the US.
However, tw
o weeks ago, the Clinton administration softened its approach and
decided no
t to challenge a lower federal court order that about 150 Haitians
infected 
with the Aids virus be released from the US naval base at
Guantanamo, Cuba, 
and be allowed into the US pending processing of asylum
applications.
Simult
aneously, the US has supported international mediation designed to
restore d
emocracy to Haiti following the military overthrow of President
Jean-Bertran
d Aristide in 1991. Further sanctions against the military
regime in Port-au
-Prince, including an oil embargo, may be enacted by the UN
this week.
To so
me degree, the case of Haiti has been superseded by concerns over a new
wave
 of illegal immigration from China. Last Friday, Mr Clinton, appointed
an ex
pert in the field, Ms Doris Meissner, commissioner of the much
criticised Im
migration and Naturalisation Service, and promised new
initiatives to halt t
he smuggling into the US of illegal aliens.
These will be aimed partly at th
e criminal syndicates apparently responsible
for shipping poor Chinese to th
e US. They will also include speedier
handling of asylum cases and possibly 
the detention of suspected illegal
immigrants pending resolution of their ca
ses.

<HEADLINE> FT  22 JUN 93 / US Supreme Court upholds policy of for
cibly returning refugees to Haiti </HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>    By JUREK MARTIN </
BYLINE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Supreme Court yes
terday upheld the policy of successive US
administrations authorising the fo
rcible return of would-be refugees from
Haiti intercepted on the high seas.

Justice John Paul Stevens, for the 8:1 court majority, said the policy did
n
ot violate US immigration policy or any international treaty. Justice Harry

Blackmun, the sole dissenter, argued that the law was clear - 'vulnerable
re
fugees shall not be returned.'
The court ruling ends one phase of the contro
versy over Haitian refugees.
President Bill Clinton came to office promising
 to reverse the exclusionary
policies of his predecessor, but changed his mi
nd, citing the same
humanitarian reasons as had President George Bush - spec
ifically the risk
that many Haitians in unseaworthy vessels would be lost at
 sea. An estimated
37,000 Haitians have sought asylum in the US.
However, tw
o weeks ago, the Clinton administration softened its approach and
decided no
t to challenge a lower federal court order that about 150 Haitians
infected 
with the Aids virus be released from the US naval base at
Guantanamo, Cuba, 
and be allowed into the US pending processing of asylum
applications.
Simult
aneously, the US has supported international mediation designed to
restore d
emocracy to Haiti following the military overthrow of President
Jean-Bertran
d Aristide in 1991. Further sanctions against the military
regime in Port-au
-Prince, including an oil embargo, may be enacted by the UN
this week.
To so
me degree, the case of Haiti has been superseded by concerns over a new
wave
 of illegal immigration from China. Last Friday, Mr Clinton, appointed
an ex
pert in the field, Ms Doris Meissner, commissioner of the much
criticised Im
migration and Naturalisation Service, and promised new
initiatives to halt t
he smuggling into the US of illegal aliens.
These will be aimed partly at th
e criminal syndicates apparently responsible
for shipping poor Chinese to th
e US. They will also include speedier
handling of asylum cases and possibly 
the detention of suspected illegal
immigrants pending resolution of their ca
ses.

<TEXT>
THE PLANNED high-speed rail link between London and the Channel 
tunnel could
be a showpiece for the UK government's initiative of attracting
 private
capital to public infrastructure projects. It provides an opportuni
ty both
to harness the private sector's skills in project management and to 
remove
at least part of a Pounds 2.6bn-Pounds 3bn project from the public se
ctor's
balance sheet.
But to achieve these benefits, the Treasury will need 
to abandon its purist
line that all the risk of such projects should be born
e by private
investors. Sticking to this line could delay or even kill off t
he project,
as Union Railways, the British Rail subsidiary set up to develop
 the link,
will tell ministers later today.
The essential point is that the 
private sector is not well suited to bear
the political and regulatory risks
 associated with the early stages of large
infrastructure projects. Before c
onstruction on the Chunnel link can
proceed, planning consents must be won, 
public inquiries conducted,
legislation passed and safety standards determin
ed. At each stage, there is
a danger that the project will be delayed and ex
tra costs imposed.
This particular project does not start with a happy histo
ry as far as
private companies are concerned. Several construction groups ha
ve already
spent money making proposals, only to have them rejected largely 
for
political reasons. There is also the overhang from the main Channel tunn
el
project, whose financial attraction has been reduced by a tightening of
s
afety regulations and the delay in building road and rail links.
It is doubt
ful whether private funds could be attracted at this stage and,
even if they
 could, a high risk premium would be required. Far better,
therefore, for th
e public sector to put up the Pounds 200m needed for the
project's next phas
e, tiding it over until political and regulatory
uncertainty is largely out 
of the way. After that, it should be easier to
find a further Pounds 2.5bn-p
lus from private investors. The remaining risks
 -concerning construction co
sts, operating expenses and customer demand -
are the type the private secto
r is best at managing.
Given the current budgetary pressures, it is reasonab
le to ask why the
Chunnel link should have priority over other worthwhile pr
ojects that are
now stalled. Part of the answer is that the link is already 
badly delayed.
Constructing it is important not only to maximise the economi
c benefits of
the Channel tunnel but also to ease congestion for commuter tr
affic in the
south-east.
But the most compelling reason for priming the pump
 is that a success with
Union Railways would give a boost to the government'
s private funding
initiative. It could open the door for private capital to 
flow into roads,
railways and prisons. That, more than almost anything else,
 would ease the
pressure on government finances.

<HEADLINE> FT  09 DEC 94 / UK Property Review (13): 'Steady as sh

<BYLI

<TEXT>
However embarrassing the accident-
prone start to the high-speed Eurostar
passenger service, the Channel Tunnel
's share of the cross-Channel freight
market has been building satisfactoril
y since the first lorries caught the
train at the end of July.
By mid-Octobe
r volumes had already outstripped those handled by the Port of
Dunkirk. Impo
rtantly, the tunnel appears to have captured a disproportionate
share of exp
ress hauliers and couriers, the time-sensitive sector of the
market essentia
l for the tunnel's premium pricing policy.
Yet if the tunnel is finally oper
ating, that event has not been marked by
the flood of speculative property d
evelopments some expected. With the
notable exception of a development conso
rtium keen to create 'Euro City'
around an International Passenger Station (
IPS) at Ebbsfleet just east of
Dartford, the catchphrase is 'steady as she g
oes.'
Chris Bond of John Laing Property Ventures which has ambitious plans f
or 125
acres around the new IPS under construction at Ashford, believes he k
nows
why. 'During the Chunnel's early planning stages everyone rushed into K
ent.
Now they are waiting for the infrastructure to catch up.'
Andrew Jackso
n of agents Weatherall Green & Smith agrees that those
developments presentl
y going ahead have been fuelled by the general
attractions of the south-east
 rather than in direct response to the tunnel.
He even detects some disillus
ionment with the amount of distribution
business which has already chosen to
 settle outside Kent or Essex.
Recession has also delayed the take-up of muc
h of the speculative
developments of the late 1980s, making new speculation 
less urgent. Figures
produced for the Kent Impact Study by the Channel Tunne
l Joint Consultative
Committee would not cause a developer to salivate.
Ware
housing demand in Kent up to 1996 is estimated at 111,000 sq m. This is
full
y matched by buildings either completed and vacant or under
construction. In
 addition, the planning pipeline contains a further 388,000
sq m to meet an 
estimated demand of 194,000 sq m between 1996 and 2001.
It comes as no surpr
ise therefore that Laing is not rushing into development
at Ashford despite 
planning permission for a retail element of 300,000 sq
ft.
'We have been rev
iewing the whole site for the past three months. Site
inspections will conti
nue until the year-end and a decision will be taken in
early summer whether 
to protect our existing planning applications or alter
them according to our
 projections for the rest of the site,' says Mr Bond.
Eurotunnel, which has 
extensive development land in both Ashford and
Folkestone, is also proceedin
g with caution.
Its 14-acre Cheriton Parc business park overlooking the tunn
el terminal just
two miles east of Folkestone, has just started to pick up s
peed. Eurotunnel
itself has taken the first building as a 28,000 sq ft custo
mer services
centre.
But Cheriton Parc is just a fraction of the 615 acres o
n seven sites owned
by Eurotunnel Developments (EDL) along the M20-A20 Chann
el Tunnel Corridor.
Ashford is the prime location. Orbital Park, a 100-acre 
light industrial
site, has BP Travel Services as its first tenant in 115,000
 sq ft. Nearby
Waterbrook Park, close to Junction 10 of the M20, already boa
sts 10ha for
lorry parking, servicing and customs clearance.
EDL is now draw
ing breath while it considers a mix of retail and industrial
warehousing, a 
new Ashford cattle market and hotel-leisure possibilities on
the rest of the
 site.
Ebbsfleet is the one big development location which seems to be in a 
hurry.
Tony Kemp, managing director of Blue Circle Properties, is keen to ma
intain
the momentum of having beaten Dartford as the site of the intermediat
e IPS
on the Chunnel route and the main rail link to the Medway towns.
Blue 
Circle has good reason to be the motive force in the public-private
sector c
onsortium with dreams of a 'Euro City' between Dartmouth and
Gravesend. It o
wns a former quarry on the edge of the Ebbsfleet station site
and has plans 
for a 1.7m sq ft shopping centre at Bluewater, another quarry
just one mile 
away.
Consequently, around Ebbsfleet station itself, the emphasis will be on
 light
industrial use, possibly in a multi-storey business park. Retail use 
will be
deliberately limited.
Another element in Euro City with which Blue C
ircle is closely involved is
the Crossways Business Park at Junction 1A of t
he M25 close to the Dartford
Tunnel. In the six years that development has b
een under way, 1m sq ft of
the proposed 3m sq ft at Crossways has already be
en built. Mr Kemp predicts
parity with West London rents within two years.
A
 new campus for Greenwich University, a regional hospital and big new
reside
ntial and leisure facilities are to be the key public sector
contributions t
o what used to be called the East Thames Corridor but now
describes itself a
s Thames Gateway.

Ashford is the prime location. Orbital Park, a 100-acre 
light industrial
site, has BP Travel Services as its first tenant in 115,000
 sq ft. Nearby
Waterbrook Park, close to Junction 10 of the M20, already boa
sts 10ha for
lorry parking, servicing and customs clearance.
EDL is now draw
ing breath while it considers a mix of retail and industrial
warehousing, a 
new Ashford cattle market and hotel-leisure possibilities on
the rest of the
 site.
Ebbsfleet is the one big development location which seems to be in a 
hurry.
Tony Kemp, managing director of Blue Circle Properties, is keen to ma
intain
the momentum of having beaten Dartford as the site of the intermediat
e IPS
on the Chunnel route and the main rail link to the Medway towns.
Blue 
Circle has good reason to be the motive force in the public-private
sector c
onsortium with dreams of a 'Euro City' between Dartmouth and
Gravesend. It o
wns a former quarry on the edge of the Ebbsfleet station site
and has plans 
for a 1.7m sq ft shopping centre at Bluewater, another quarry
just one mile 
away.
Consequently, around Ebbsfleet station itself, the emphasis will be on
 light
industrial use, possibly in a multi-storey business park. Retail use 
will be
deliberately limited.
Another element in Euro City with which Blue C
ircle is closely involved is
the Crossways Business Park at Junction 1A of t
he M25 close to the Dartford
Tunnel. In the six years that development has b
een under way, 1m sq ft of
the proposed 3m sq ft at Crossways has already be
en built. Mr Kemp predicts
parity with West London rents within two years.
A
 new campus for Greenwich University, a regional hospital and big new
reside
ntial and leisure facilities are to be the key public sector
contributions t
o what used to be called the East Thames Corridor but now
describes itself a
s Thames Gateway.

<HEADLINE> FT  11 DEC 93 / Motoring: What will the Chunnel offer?
 - Stuart Marshall casts a sceptical English eye on the benefits of undersea
 travel </HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>    By STUART MARSHALL </BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like mil
lions of people living in the south-east of England - and
particularly in my
 own county of Kent - I have never been a Channel Tunnel
enthusiast. This is
 not because the high-speed rail link, should it ever be
built, would go any
where near my home. Put my feelings down to being an
old-fashioned reactiona
ry. I liked Britain being a proper island and I have
always seen the Channel
 crossing by ferry as pleasure, not penance.
I doubt I was alone in hoping t
hat if I ignored the Chunnel, it just might
go away. But new bridges began a
ppearing across the M20 as it neared
Folkestone, while a forest of gantries 
and overhead wires went up behind
high concrete retaining walls. Work trains
 could sometimes be glimpsed.
When the first advertisements appeared for the
 Chunnel car ferry, which
starts running next May, I thought it was time I h
ad a look. It was a
revelation. What has been built, unseen by M20 users, is
 something as big as
an airport terminal. But instead of acres of runways, t
here is a marshalling
yard and rail tracks running into a tunnel.
The operat
ing company, Eurotunnel, says people still have many
misconceptions. Many th
ink they will be able to drive their cars through to
France; and while most 
do realise it is rail only, some believe their cars
will go on flat trucks, 
as on car-carrier trains, while they ride in
passenger carriages.
Wrong agai
n. You stay with your car in a windowless van. You can walk around
it if you
 wish, but the only place to visit is the lavatory in every third
interconne
cted coach.
When, in five months, the tunnel starts competing with the car f
erries, this
is what will happen. Motorists will leave the M20 by the Eurotu
nnel slip
road, pause at a toll booth to pay for their passage, and then hav
e a
choice. Those in a hurry can pass through Customs and drive straight on 
to
the train. Others can go to the terminal building for refreshments and
du
ty-frees.
Tickets can be bought from travel agents in advance but there are 
no
reservations; all-comers get in line for the next train. At peak times,
t
here will be one every 15 minutes; but if you just miss one at, say, 2am,
yo
u could have to wait an hour or so.
Platform to platform, the under-Channel 
train will take 35 minutes.
Eurotunnel says that, during the day, a motorist
 should be able to drive out
of the French terminal at Sangatte, near Calais
, and on to the A26 autoroute
within one hour of coming off the M20.
There w
ill be separate ferry trains for cars and commercial vehicles. Main
line pas
senger and freight trains will also use the tunnel but, apart from
sharing t
he tracks, have nothing whatever to do with the car ferry trains.
Fares have
 not been fixed but, to compete, they must be about the same as
those on the
 ships. Every safety and security precaution known to man has
been taken. Us
ing Eurotunnel should be rather less risky than riding in a
clapped-out Lond
on Underground train.
Will it kill off the Dover-Calais ferries? Of course n
ot, although it will
take a chunk of the available (and constantly growing) 
business of
transporting cars and lorries to and from mainland Europe. If th
e tunnel's
freight trains reduce the number of juggernaut lorries now poundi
ng our
motorways to pieces, every motorist will cheer.
I have two reservatio
ns about Eurotunnel (which, beyond any argument, is a
wonder of 20th century
 civil engineering of which Britain and France can be
proud). While I do not
 exactly relish the thought of an underground - and,
even more so, undersea 
- journey of more than 30 miles (50 km), I shall
certainly try it. But the i
dea fills many people with such undiluted horror
that they say there is no w
ay they will ever make the trip.
A more logical objection is that the time s
aving could be an illusion. The
train might take 35 minutes, platform to pla
tform, against the ferry's 75
minutes, dock to dock. But you can eat, stretc
h your legs and shop during
the sea crossing. A family driving from, say, Bi
rmingham to Paris would have
to stop for a meal before or after the tunnel c
rossing - so what has
happened to the time saving?
Many cross-Channel travel
lers, very sensibly, use the ferry as a mobile
motorway service area. So, wi
th an eye on the Chunnel's opening, P & 0 and
Stena Sealink have upgraded th
eir fleets. The ships are now more like cruise
liners than ferries in size a
nd facilities. They are so stable that even a
gale does not disturb their eq
uilibrium - or, more important, that of their
passengers. For an extra Pound
s 5 on each leg, P & O club class is a truly
civilised way of crossing the C
hannel.
When heading west to Normandy and Brittany, I like using the longer 
routes
such as Newhaven to Dieppe; Portsmouth or Southampton to Le Havre, Ch
erbourg
or St Malo. Longer crossings are not always reflected in higher fare
s; a
four-hour Newhaven-Dieppe voyage can be cheaper than Dover-Calais.
Alth
ough the ships on these routes are not as large as the short-haul
super-ferr
ies, their facilities are comparable, if on a smaller scale. My
wife and I h
ave passed less comfortable nights in hotels than we did
recently between Po
rtsmouth and St Malo on Brittany Ferries' 23,000-ton
Bretagne. It has every 
facility to make the eight-hour crossing pleasant;
even a hairdressing salon
.
In Britain, Suzuki is synonymous with small four-wheel drives, and its Swi
ft
front-wheel drive hatchback gets overlooked. It deserves better. I though
t
the Swift GLX 1.3 automatic five-door, which I used as a runabout recently
,
would suit many buyers whose motoring is mainly in town and who rate ease 
of
control above all else. The four-cylinder, multi-valve engine and
three-s
peed automatic gearbox are well matched. Power steering is
finger-light; cen
tral locking and a tilt-adjustable steering wheel are
standard; and the high
-roofed body is agreeably roomy, with good all-round
vision. The ride can be
 bouncy on bad roads, and luggage has to be lifted
over a high sill. But, bu
t at Pounds 9,125, the two-pedal Swift is cheaper
than any power-steered riv
al.

<HEADLINE> FT  11 DEC 93 / Motoring: What will the Chunnel offer?
 - Stuart Marshall casts a sceptical English eye on the benefits of undersea
 travel </HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>    By STUART MARSHALL </BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like mil
lions of people living in the south-east of England - and
particularly in my
 own county of Kent - I have never been a Channel Tunnel
enthusiast. This is
 not because the high-speed rail link, should it ever be
built, would go any
where near my home. Put my feelings down to being an
old-fashioned reactiona
ry. I liked Britain being a proper island and I have
always seen the Channel
 crossing by ferry as pleasure, not penance.
I doubt I was alone in hoping t
hat if I ignored the Chunnel, it just might
go away. But new bridges began a
ppearing across the M20 as it neared
Folkestone, while a forest of gantries 
and overhead wires went up behind
high concrete retaining walls. Work trains
 could sometimes be glimpsed.
When the first advertisements appeared for the
 Chunnel car ferry, which
starts running next May, I thought it was time I h
ad a look. It was a
revelation. What has been built, unseen by M20 users, is
 something as big as
an airport terminal. But instead of acres of runways, t
here is a marshalling
yard and rail tracks running into a tunnel.
The operat
ing company, Eurotunnel, says people still have many
misconceptions. Many th
ink they will be able to drive their cars through to
France; and while most 
do realise it is rail only, some believe their cars
will go on flat trucks, 
as on car-carrier trains, while they ride in
passenger carriages.
Wrong agai
n. You stay with your car in a windowless van. You can walk around
it if you
 wish, but the only place to visit is the lavatory in every third
interconne
cted coach.
When, in five months, the tunnel starts competing with the car f
erries, this
is what will happen. Motorists will leave the M20 by the Eurotu
nnel slip
road, pause at a toll booth to pay for their passage, and then hav
e a
choice. Those in a hurry can pass through Customs and drive straight on 
to
the train. Others can go to the terminal building for refreshments and
du
ty-frees.
Tickets can be bought from travel agents in advance but there are 
no
reservations; all-comers get in line for the next train. At peak times,
t
here will be one every 15 minutes; but if you just miss one at, say, 2am,
yo
u could have to wait an hour or so.
Platform to platform, the under-Channel 
train will take 35 minutes.
Eurotunnel says that, during the day, a motorist
 should be able to drive out
of the French terminal at Sangatte, near Calais
, and on to the A26 autoroute
within one hour of coming off the M20.
There w
ill be separate ferry trains for cars and commercial vehicles. Main
line pas
senger and freight trains will also use the tunnel but, apart from
sharing t
he tracks, have nothing whatever to do with the car ferry trains.
Fares have
 not been fixed but, to compete, they must be about the same as
those on the
 ships. Every safety and security precaution known to man has
been taken. Us
ing Eurotunnel should be rather less risky than riding in a
clapped-out Lond
on Underground train.
Will it kill off the Dover-Calais ferries? Of course n
ot, although it will
take a chunk of the available (and constantly growing) 
business of
transporting cars and lorries to and from mainland Europe. If th
e tunnel's
freight trains reduce the number of juggernaut lorries now poundi
ng our
motorways to pieces, every motorist will cheer.
I have two reservatio
ns about Eurotunnel (which, beyond any argument, is a
wonder of 20th century
 civil engineering of which Britain and France can be
proud). While I do not
 exactly relish the thought of an underground - and,
even more so, undersea 
- journey of more than 30 miles (50 km), I shall
certainly try it. But the i
dea fills many people with such undiluted horror
that they say there is no w
ay they will ever make the trip.
A more logical objection is that the time s
aving could be an illusion. The
train might take 35 minutes, platform to pla
tform, against the ferry's 75
minutes, dock to dock. But you can eat, stretc
h your legs and shop during
the sea crossing. A family driving from, say, Bi
rmingham to Paris would have
to stop for a meal before or after the tunnel c
rossing - so what has
happened to the time saving?
Many cross-Channel travel
lers, very sensibly, use the ferry as a mobile
motorway service area. So, wi
th an eye on the Chunnel's opening, P & 0 and
Stena Sealink have upgraded th
eir fleets. The ships are now more like cruise
liners than ferries in size a
nd facilities. They are so stable that even a
gale does not disturb their eq
uilibrium - or, more important, that of their
passengers. For an extra Pound
s 5 on each leg, P & O club class is a truly
civilised way of crossing the C
hannel.
When heading west to Normandy and Brittany, I like using the longer 
routes
such as Newhaven to Dieppe; Portsmouth or Southampton to Le Havre, Ch
erbourg
or St Malo. Longer crossings are not always reflected in higher fare
s; a
four-hour Newhaven-Dieppe voyage can be cheaper than Dover-Calais.
Alth
ough the ships on these routes are not as large as the short-haul
super-ferr
ies, their facilities are comparable, if on a smaller scale. My
wife and I h
ave passed less comfortable nights in hotels than we did
recently between Po
rtsmouth and St Malo on Brittany Ferries' 23,000-ton
Bretagne. It has every 
facility to make the eight-hour crossing pleasant;
even a hairdressing salon
.
In Britain, Suzuki is synonymous with small four-wheel drives, and its Swi
ft
front-wheel drive hatchback gets overlooked. It deserves better. I though
t
the Swift GLX 1.3 automatic five-door, which I used as a runabout recently
,
would suit many buyers whose motoring is mainly in town and who rate ease 
of
control above all else. The four-cylinder, multi-valve engine and
three-s
peed automatic gearbox are well matched. Power steering is
finger-light; cen
tral locking and a tilt-adjustable steering wheel are
standard; and the high
-roofed body is agreeably roomy, with good all-round
vision. The ride can be
 bouncy on bad roads, and luggage has to be lifted
over a high sill. But, bu
t at Pounds 9,125, the two-pedal Swift is cheaper
than any power-steered riv
al.
