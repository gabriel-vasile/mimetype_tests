ifl 2000 during the presidential campaign, ~ne person said
re ‘lice ?re~i~ert raised the iss’:e Thterrally that t~e
connection between WT~4D arid terrorism was the primary
security threat to the country.

(Question: If so, when and where did that notion come from
that early? To whom was it expressed?)


During the 2000 campaign Cheney generally supported the
U.N. weapons inspection process for Iraq but developed the
theme of Clinton’s weak and erratic policies.

(At that point was there a sense of unfinished business
with Iraq——--that the Saddam Hussein matter would have to be
confronted in some form if Bush arid Cheney were elected?)


~~After the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, there was a
spike in the intelligence about Iraq trying to get WMD.

(Do you recall any and what was your reaction?)


.~. Several people have said that the Vice President believed
7/
the pre~iderr~—de~ided before the end of 2001 that the Iraq
problem was going to be solved one way or the other.


(Does this seem right and what other than 9/11 caused
that?)


Others have said that the core discussion with the
president about Iraq in late 2001 was as follows: If Saddam
uses ~JND on Israel and Israel retaliates, especially with
nuclear, then you’ve lost the entire Middle East. If
Saddam uses WMD in the U.S. and thousands or hundreds of
thousands die, there will be no excuse if the
/	administration says the evidence was not conclusive. So
the weight of evidence required before 9/11 does not apply
after 9/11. The standard of pzoof has to be lowered.

(Can you locate when and where such discussion occurred?)

(Recall the evolution of this speech and your reaction? How
important is this speech?


Others have said the president’s intellectual framework for
Iraq had four major parts: 1. 9/11, 2. the WMD
~‘	intelligence fro?rl late 2001, 3. the Axis of Evil speech, 4.
the June 1, 2002 West Point speech about preemption.

(Is that about how you see it? What would you add or
emphasize?


April 2002, Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah met with Bush and
pushed for a $1 billion intelligence operation to overthrow
Saddam rather than using the military.

(Reaction? Why would this not work?)


__	May 29, 2002. George ShuJ.tz gave a speech calling for “hot
preemption.” Cheney privately says that is “George at his
wisest and best.”

(Did this play a role in the preemption doctrine? Did you
talk with shultz about his remarks? Was the PTesident
aware of them?)


The President’s June 1. 2002 West Point speech was possibly
the most important and the clearest formulation that
5.~!	American values would be spread. “Our Nation’s cause has
always been larger than our Nation’s defense.” And, it is
really good vs. evil, a conflict between right and wrong.
The U.S. seeks not only an absence of war, but a “just
oeace” moral purpose, .democracy, free markets and
rights for women. “If we wait fdr threatsto fully
materialize, we will have waited too long.”

anything militarily unless confident we can succeed.
Success is removal of Saddam.” Rumsfeld said, “If it looks
untidy in the press, it is. Preemption is an important
discussion to have. Problem is that it gets particularized
to Iraq.”

(Does this fully convey the state of play at this point?
What was your sense of where decisions were heading? And
on what timetable?)


Aug. 26, 2002. One person said the vice president

ran the danger of providing “false comfort.” The question

Sept. 12, 2002. The President’s U.N. speech calling for a
new Iraq resolution. Others have said this was the moment
the president decided he would have to use force because he
had promised that if the U.N. did not disarm Saddam, the
tLS. would. This was the point of no return; needed
credible threat of force for diplomacy to work.

(Recall any specific reaction? The president apparently
had a different view of inspections than anyone else?
Recall what it was?)


Sept. 18. The president and vice president have a
breakfast meeting with Congressional leaders. In a meeting
before or after, the President and Vice President are told
aboXit “Vitiating cloture,” and both wondex what it means.
Caijo brings in a definition sheet-——meaning to make it go

(Do you recall this? What was the key to getting the
resolutions and avoiding cloture in the Senate?)


Oct. 2. At 1:15 p.m. the President appears with dozens of

Around this time, the CIA made contact with the former head
of the Iraqi UAV program who was living in Australia. He
~.	may have ordered topographical maps of the U.S. on-line.
But he wanted some 20 members of his extended family in
Iraq to ~e taken out of Iraq.

(What was the key to this? Recall what the President’s

Oct/Nov 2002. One of the first detailed Iraq war plans
called for: 5 days to establish the air bridge; 11 days
for flow of forces; 16 day air campaign; 32ftd day the ground

(Your reaction to this more or less traditional sequential
war plan?)


In the period of the fall, when people wanted early

diplomacy, but not so much as to disciedit the diplomacy so
(critics) could say, ‘Well, you have already made up your
mind.’”

~Do you recall this? Your reaction?)


Several people have said that the. President knew he was
underestimated and he was able to use that conventional
wisdom as he responded to 9/11 but there was a point when
he could no longer count on that.

(Was there a realization of this in the Fall of 2002?
Discussion of this?)


Did the diplomatic track run the risk of giving the
President a diplomatic victory but a strategic loss?
Or was diplomacy the equivalent of economic sanctions in
the ‘first Gulf crisis of 1990—91: The. U.S. had to show that
it had tried diplomacy and that it didn’t and wouldn’t
work.


Dec. 21. Received the intercept of two Iraqi Republican
Guard commanders discussing.the removal of “nerve agents”
in wireless communications. (Powell later used it in his
U.N. presentation).

(Any particular reaction to that and its meaning?)


Another discussion involved the use of the poison ricin by
—.	terrorists connected to Iraq. They tested it on a donkey
who dies and they laughed. It was quite chilling. But
British intelligence asked that it not be used.

(Recall? Reaction? Someone else said release would scare
the public. Correct?)

Small scale sabotage. Later a train was attacked witn an

was a senior defector inside the SSO who was feeding

(Did you get involved? How? What did you think? Several
people have suggested that the U.S. essentially laid the
groundwork with these secret efforts and made victory
almost certain. Es that possible?)


President Bush apparently said at one point that if the war
plan is good the only thing that can go wrong is if the
country or the president loses his nerve.

(Reaction?)


Jan. 11, 2003. Rumsfeld and Myers brief Prince Bandar in
Cheney’s office on the war plan. Essentially said that
everything that sounds natural and logical will NOT happen.
Franks had ideas to make tactical surprise irrelevant.
Plan then called for four days of massive bombing before
the ground war--—many more bombs and precision bombs than
in the 38 days of the Gulf War.

put on a piece of paper or conveyed to the president and
Cheney~

(If true, why was that?)
(How was the CIA plan devised so it facilitated the
military war plan? It was a corollary to the war plan?
Why and how and when?)


In February 2003, the president told others it looked like
war, though he would proceed with diplomacy. Asked people,
are you with me?

(Any recollection of that?)


February--—end of month, Franks proposed starting the war
with 48 hours of Special Operations within Iraq (so—called
S—Day), and the president was somewhat uncomfortable that
it would leave the American public in the dark.

(What persuaded him to approve this?)


Feb. 22. At one point this was N-day or Notification Day
or flow all the forces.

(What was this?)


___	The president has said privately (publicly??) that during
the diplomatic phase the French stopped the momentum by
breaking the solidarity and if they had not, peaceful
disarmament hada chance?

(What was your assessment at the time?)
(What about the question of the sincerity of the diplomatic
strategy?)

Mar. 3 At one point this might have been the start day
of the war. Delay because of: 1. Second U.N. resolution,
2. Franks was.ready but not f~l1y ready. 3. Still the
question of Turkey (only to some.) The start day was
apparently then moved to Mar. 10, then to Mar. 19.

(Do you recall this period, the state of readiness and the
reasoning?)


Mar. 7, 2003. Ken Adelman, Cheney’s friend, did a piece in
USA Today arguing that the administration had “made a~
whopping mistake waiting too long already.” Waiting to
attack Iraq allowed the opposition to build, empowering
France and domestic critics.

(Your reaction?)


March 10. Two presidential speeches are being prepared on
the second U.N. resolution. One assumes a veto, the second
on getting a reaffirmation of Resolution 1441. The
president said that Blair was deeply worried, “But I don’t
think he’s going to lose office.” He obviously didn’t want
Blair’s government to go down; it was one time the
president was pulling on the reins to slow down. Cheney
was to make some calls to Conservatives in Britain. -

(What happened here?)


Mar. 12. Working on ultimatum speech. The President
declared about the U.N. process, “This needs to end.”
Thought they might need the speech for as early as the next
two days.

that there was not much Saddam could do to alter the

MarA 19, 2003, Wednesday.

This was going to be tricky because the war would begin at
1 p.m. with Special Operations. Card said of the plan to
fill in the next 48 hours: “A lot of briefings from the
Pentagon, a lot of silence from the White House.

(Did you expect that Special Operations would have 48 hours
without tipping off the Iraqis or the media?)


When Tenet and Rumsfeld arrived with the new intelligence,
the president had two issues. 1. It could be a set up and
you would wake up the next morning to dead children. 2.
Would an early strike on the Dora Farm have an impact on
General Franks’ plan? Would it blow strategic or even
tactical surprise?

(Your worry or concerns?)

the Poles or the Australians. It was not necessary to
announce it until you are ready.

(Do you recall this? Any other reasons?)


Issue was raised about what it would mean for Israel, Saudi
Arabia and other Arab friends——-and their defense.

(Could they have been more vulnerable?)


The president said that. if lives were in danger he should
announce it; and he said he had promised publicly that he
would let people know when the war had started.

Someone said the vice president talked privately with the
president during this period and the president wanted to

±ater luring the war, GeneraP Franks one day became deeply
a ~io zr zhe~i:a2. weapr. attack, that a sr~P~
amount could become what he called a “strategic
dislocator,” upsetting the course of the war. Franks
ordered that every known iraci. plane or helicopter which
would be a possible means of delivery be destroyed at once.

(Do you recall this?)


Do you recaLl. the 22 high collateral damage targets and
some medium collateral damage targets; they were presented

General Franks saw five fronts in the war plan: Western
Iraq, Southern Iraq, Northern Iraq, Baghdad and Information
operations.

(What did you see as the major fronts?)


General Franks talked in terms of “lines of action.” This
included so—caLLed “operational fires” or majo~r actions but
also things like information operations, time—sensitive
targets, support for opposition groups etc.

(I confess to being very confused about this and the
relationship to specific targets Can you explain? HELP!)


Mar. 20 at 8 a.m. Gen. Franks recommends moving the ground
attack up 24 hours from Friday night to Thursday night. Or

campaign. Was that part of the reasoning?)
(Was it risky to put the ground forces in first without a

aims: regime change, eliminate WMDI drive out terrorists,

(What was the origin of these? Was there ever concern that
it was too ambitious, too long a list? Or is this just the
practical and sweeping specifics that naturally result from
the President’s speeches? When I interviewed the President
on Aug. 20, 2002, he said, “I will seize the opportunity to

Mar. 25 (continuing) Franks’ report, “We’re almost startled

The president has a series of questions: What’s the

Mar. 28 at 2 p.m. the President met with a group of

Nar. 29, Saturday SVTS. Rumsfeld gives some of the bad
news: Shinseki story that should not have started until the
4tk ID was ready; Wallace comments that it was not what they

war gained against. “Overall Tom Franks is very
encouraged,” Rumsfeld adds. Good news: nothing out of the
Scud baskets, got the oil wells in the south, Patriots are
highly successful, no massive refugees; they didn’t mine
the harbors, didn’t blow the bridges etc.
The President says, “Only one thing matters, winning.
There’s a lot of second guessing regarding the post-Saddam
-world. Our job is to speak to the American people, tell
them how proud we are of the soldiers; to the world to tell
them that we will accomplish this mission; to our European
allies, thanks for your help; to the Iraqi people, we will

March 3).. Franks reports that 54 time—sensitive targets
were hit in the last two days.

(Was this the chat room used by Centoom and the
intelligence agencies that could accommodate some 2,000
people to coordinate real-time intelligence and ship it to
the military units in the air or on the ground?
What did you think of all this? Is it correct that nothing
like this was available during the 1992. Gulf War?)


After the experiences in the southern Iraq cities, the
commanders learned that the so-called “Thunder Run” of
tanks into the cities led to the concentration of Baath
Party officials in a panic so they could be attacked more••~~
easily. This informed what happened later in Baghdad.

The president was insistent ibat the U.S. define the
baseline against which things are going to be measured---
the conditions in Iraqi cities versus their pre—war status,
not against American cities. “This guy’s spent 20 to 30
years ruining this country,” the President said. “It ~s
going to take a while to rebuild it . . We still have a
lot of work to do. Don’t let the celebrations fool you.”

GENERAL QUESTIONS:

On the question of Turkey, the president asked Franks if he
could win without Turkey. Franks said it would be “an ugly
baby.” Can you win? “Yes, sir.”

(Do you recall this? When was it?)


One person suggested that anyone’s position on Iraq has to
do with their willingness to tolerate uncertainty. And when
all the assessments and reasoning were laid out, the
President just felt there was too much uncertainty, too
many dots about threats from Saddam. That in the end the
only prudent course was to take him out.

(Is that correct?)
