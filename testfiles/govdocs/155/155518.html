          <td><font size="+1"><b>Diabetic Retinopathy Occurs in Pre-Diabetes</b></font>
            <p> Diabetic retinopathy has been found in nearly 8 percent
              of pre-diabetic participants in the Diabetes Prevention
              Program (DPP), according to a report presented today
              at the American Diabetes Association's 65th Annual Scientific
              Sessions. Diabetic retinopathy, which can lead to vision
              loss, was also seen in 12 percent of participants with
              type 2 diabetes who developed diabetes during the DPP.
              No other long-term study has evaluated retinopathy in
              a population so carefully examined for the presence
              or development of type 2 diabetes. </p>
            <p>“These findings reinforce the recommendation that patients
              with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes should be screened
              for retinopathy,” said Emily Chew, M.D., of the National
              Eye Institute, part of the National Institutes of Health
              (NIH) under the U.S. Department of Health and Human
              Services, which funded the study. “We advise good control
              of blood glucose, blood pressure, and cholesterol as
              well as regular eye exams.” </p>
            <p>“Previous studies have not accurately defined when
              type 2 diabetes begins, so our understanding of the
              onset of diabetic eye disease has been limited. Now
              we know that diabetic retinopathy does occur in pre-diabetes.
              We’re also seeing it early in the course of diabetes &#8212; within
              an average of 3 years after diagnosis,” noted Richard
              Hamman, M.D., DrPH, professor and chair, Department
              of Preventive Medicine and Biometrics, University of
              Colorado School of Medicine, and vice chair of the DPP. “This
              adds to our understanding of the development of retinopathy
              and suggests that changes in the eye may be starting
              earlier and at lower glucose levels than we previously
            thought.” </p>
            <p>Pre-diabetes is a condition in which blood glucose
              levels are higher than normal but not high enough for
              a diagnosis of diabetes. The condition is sometimes
              called "impaired fasting glucose (IFG)" or "impaired
              glucose tolerance (IGT)," depending on the test used
              to diagnose it. People with pre-diabetes have an increased
              risk of developing type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and
              stroke. </p>
            <p>Diabetic retinopathy, which begins with changes in
              the small vessels in the back of the eye, often leads
              to loss of vision. Regular eye examinations to diagnose
              retinopathy are recommended for patients with diabetes
              because treatment with laser photocoagulation can often
              prevent blindness in more advanced cases. Diabetic retinopathy
              is still the most common cause of blindness in adults.
              (For more information about diabetic retinopathy, see
              NEI’s <em>Diabetic Retinopathy: What you should know</em> <a href="http://www.nei.nih.gov/health/diabetic/retinopathy.asp">http://www.nei.nih.gov/health/diabetic/retinopathy.asp</a>). </p>
            <p>“Certain retinopathy lesions are considered indicative
              of the presence of diabetes because they are the first
              retinal changes to develop in this disease,” explained
              Dr. Hamman. “Although the retinopathy seen in the DPP
              participants was at a very early stage and did not affect
              vision, eye changes typical for diabetes were found
              in 8 percent of our study population before they developed
              diabetes. These observations may lead diabetes experts
              to reconsider the diagnostic thresholds used to define
              diabetes, which are based on levels of blood glucose
              associated with the development of eye, nerve and kidney
              complications of diabetes.” </p>
            <p>DPP study chair David Nathan, M.D., of Massachusetts
              General Hospital, pointed out that the retinopathy results
              are based on a random sample of only 12 percent of DPP
              participants, all of whom had impaired glucose tolerance,
              a form of pre-diabetes, when the study began. “These
              initial findings confirm what other studies have suggested.
              The complications of diabetes may begin before diabetes
              is diagnosed, at least by the current-day standards,” he
              explained. “Ideally, an expanded study of the remaining
              88 percent of DPP Outcome Study participants might enable
              us to define more appropriate diagnostic thresholds.” </p>
            <p>About 18.2 million Americans have diabetes, a group
              of serious diseases marked by high blood glucose levels
              that result from defects in the body's ability to produce
              and/or use insulin. Diabetes can lead to severely debilitating
              or fatal complications, such as heart disease, blindness,
              kidney disease, and amputations. It is the fifth leading
              cause of death by disease in the United States. Type
              2 diabetes, which accounts for up to 95 percent of all
              diabetes cases, involves insulin resistance &#8212; the body’s
              inability to properly use its own insulin. It usually
              occurs in overweight adults, but it has increasingly
            been seen in obese children and teens in recent years. </p>
            <p>About 40 percent of U.S. adults ages 40 to 74 &#8212; 41 million
              people &#8212; have abnormal blood glucose levels without having
              diabetes. Many will develop type 2 diabetes in the next
              10 years. (In the DPP, about 10 percent of participants
              in the placebo group developed diabetes each year.)
              Once a person has type 2 diabetes, the risk of heart
              and blood vessel disease is 2 to 4 times that of people
            without diabetes. </p>
            <p><strong>Diabetes Prevention Program</strong><br>
              The Diabetes Prevention Program was a major clinical
                trial in 3,234 people with impaired glucose tolerance.
                The study’s main results were announced in 2001 and
                reported in the Feb. 7, 2002 issue of the <em>New England
                Journal of Medicine</em>: Losing 5 to 7 percent of body
                weight through diet and a modest, consistent increase
                in physical activity (e.g., walking 5 days a week
                30 minutes a day) lowered the incidence of type 2
                diabetes by 58 percent. Treatment with metformin,
                an oral drug commonly used to treat diabetes, reduced
            the chances of developing diabetes by 31 percent. </p>
            <p>The DPP was sponsored by the National Institute of
              Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) and
              co-funded by other components of the NIH, the Centers
              for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Indian Health
              Service. The American Diabetes Association provided
              additional funding. Sources of corporate support included
              Bristol-Myers Squibb, Parke-Davis, Merck and Company,
              Merck Medco, Hoechst Marion Roussel, Sankyo, Lifescan,
              Lipha Pharmaceuticals, Slimfast, Nike, and Health-O-Meter. </p>
            <p>About 90 percent of DPP participants continue to be
              followed closely in the DPP Outcomes Study to examine
              the longer-term impact of the original treatment interventions.
              All participants are given access to quarterly lifestyle
              group sessions, while those in the original intensive
              lifestyle group have access to additional lifestyle
              activities to help them stay on track. The participants
              originally assigned to metformin therapy continue to
              have access to the drug. </p>
            <p><strong>Retinopathy Findings</strong><br>
              Three hundred two, or about 12 percent, of the DPP Outcome
                Study participants who had not developed diabetes
                during the study, and 588 of 876 participants who
                had developed diabetes, were selected to participate
                in the retinopathy study, funded by the NEI. To detect
                diabetic retinopathy, an evaluation of the fundus
                (inner lining of the eye) was performed with a special
                camera that provides a detailed look at the retina.
                Small changes in the vessels, called microaneurysms
                and hemorrhages, signal the development and degree
                of retinopathy severity. </p>
            <p>Participants with pre-diabetes and retinopathy typically
              had a small number of microaneurysms in the eye characteristic
              of early, mild retinopathy that is not yet linked to
              vision loss. Those who had developed diabetes in the
              previous 1 to 5 years had slightly more severe retinopathy.
              Higher average blood glucose levels and higher blood
              pressure were associated with the risk of developing
              retinopathy in the new-onset diabetic patients, similar
              to previous findings in people with longstanding diabetes
              who develop retinopathy. </p>
            <p>In its "Be Smart About Your Heart: Control the ABCs
              of Diabetes" campaign, the National Diabetes Education
              Program (NDEP) (<a href="http://www.ndep.nih.gov/">www.ndep.nih.gov/</a>), jointly sponsored
              by the NIH, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
              and 200 partner organizations including the American
              Diabetes Association (ADA), encourages people with diabetes
              to control their blood glucose as well as their blood
              pressure and cholesterol. By keeping all three as close
              to normal as possible, people with diabetes can live
              long, healthy lives. </p>
            <p>NDEP’s “Small Steps. Big Rewards. Prevent Type 2 Diabetes” campaign
              gives tips on lifestyle changes to prevent or delay
              type 2 diabetes. </p>
            <p>“Make the Link! Diabetes, Heart Disease and Stroke,” is
