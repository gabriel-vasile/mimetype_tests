							 <P>MEETING SITE: BETHESDA, MARYLAND </P>
							 <P>MINUTES OF AND CONSENSUS RECOMMENDATIONS: </P>
							 <P>This document is a review of the current state of
								knowledge and research in diabetic cardiomyopathy and recommendations for
								future research initiatives. It summarizes presentations and discussions held
								on the above date by a panel of scientific experts and NIH staff. </P>
							 <P>STATEMENT OF RATIONALE FOR THE WORKING GROUP </P>
							 <P>The development of heart failure in patients with
								diabetes mellitus is a problem of major clinical and epidemiologic importance.
								Heart failure can occur in patients with diabetes mellitus in the absence of
								coexistent hypertension and/or hemodynamically significant epicardial coronary
								artery stenoses (subsequently referred to as <EM>coronary artery disease</EM>).
								Clinical reports in the 1970s first described such patients, who were
								considered to have a diabetic cardiomyopathy, usually of a dilated
								cardiomyopathy with low ejection fraction. Of far greater epidemiologic
								importance, however, is the risk when diabetes mellitus is combined with
								coronary artery disease and/or hypertension. Diabetes mellitus patients with
								acute myocardial infarction have approximately twice the incidence of heart
								failure and death compared to non-diabetic patients. Diabetes mellitus and
								hypertension is also a potent combined risk factor for heart failure. Increased
								risks for heart failure and death in patients with diabetes mellitus are
								especially pronounced in women, African-Americans and certain Native Americans.
								Many diabetes mellitus patients without overt heart disease have evidence of
								subclinical myocardial abnormalities, including echocardiographic-Doppler
								patterns suggestive of slowed relaxation and/or decreased compliance, abnormal
								ultrasonic tissue characterization consistent with altered connective tissue,
								and abnormal left ventricular functional responses during exercise. It is not
								known whether these subclinical abnormalities are the substrate for the
								subsequent development of heart failure, nor what factor(s) are responsible for
								its pathogenesis. </P>
							 <P>Despite the obvious importance of diabetic
								cardiomyopathy, a modern understanding of this complex, and very likely
								multi-factorial, problem at the cellular and molecular level is lacking,
								especially in patients. In addition, there has been little emphasis on
								developing novel approaches to prevention and treatment. </P>
							 <P>The purpose of the Working Group was to discuss our
								current understanding of diabetic cardiomyopathy, especially at the
								cellular/molecular level, and identify the most promising and critical areas
								for future research efforts in the field. </P>
							 <P>SUMMARY OF PREVIOUS RESEARCH </P>
							 <P>Early clinical studies of patients with apparent
								diabetic cardiomyopathy were accompanied by very limited histologic examination
								of tissue obtained by endomyocardial biopsy. Findings included increased PAS+
								connective tissue (mainly perivascular), basement membrane thickening (also
								with PAS+ material), and thickening of the walls of small arteries and
								arterioles. These abnormalities were not striking in relation to the severity
								of clinical disease. Replacement fibrosis in particular was not a prominent
								feature, arguing against myocardial necrosis as a major causative factor. At
								about the same time, the epidemiologic importance of diabetes mellitus as a
								risk factor for heart failure was first recognized, initially through
								observations made in the Framingham Study. Subsequent clinical research, most
								of which was accomplished in the 1980s through the early 1990s, included the
								following major contributions: </P>
							 <OL> 
								<LI><EM>Careful pathologic examination of post-mortem
								  tissue from patients with diabetes mellitus and advanced heart disease,
								  typically in combination with coronary artery disease and/or hypertension</EM>.
								  These patients had substantial cardiac hypertrophy and enlargement with major
								  increases in connective tissue and replacement fibrosis. Although it was
								  impossible to sort out their relative contributions, the concept that evolved
								  from these studies was that diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease/
								  hypertension were synergistic in increasing the risk of heart failure and
								  death. This concept continues to the present day.
								  <P> </P></LI>
								<LI><EM>Epidemiologic studies of the natural history of
								  acute myocardial infarction in patients with coexistent diabetes mellitus.
								  </EM>These revealed remarkably high mortality and risk for development of heart
								  failure. Women, African-Americans, and some Native Americans appear to be at
								  especially high risk. Despite modern treatment, more recent studies continue to
								  reveal excess morbidity and mortality from acute myocardial infarction in
								  patients with diabetes mellitus.
								  <P> </P></LI>
								<LI><EM>Non-invasive studies utilizing
								  echocardiography-Doppler, radionuclide ventriculography, and stress testing in
								  patients with diabetes mellitus without overt heart disease. </EM>These
								  revealed abnormalities of relaxation and/or compliance, ultrasonic tissue
								  characterization, and abnormally small increases in contractile functional
								  parameters during exercise in, surprisingly, large numbers of patients. The
								  incidence of these abnormalities appeared to be independent of diabetes type
								  (insulin dependent vs non-insulin dependent), but was positively correlated
								  with the presence of other complications of diabetes mellitus such as
								  neuropathy, nephropathy, and retinal vasculopathy. </LI> 
							 </OL>
							 <P>These clinical observations stimulated work in
								experimental models of diabetes mellitus. By far the most extensively employed
								model was, and continues to be, streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes mellitus
								in the rat. Rats given STZ for weeks to months develop hypoinsulinemic diabetes
								mellitus, consistent depression of contraction, and, most especially,
								relaxation. Effects on "passive" diastolic compliance have been variable. These
								contractile abnormalities were correlated with several alterations in
								excitation-contraction coupling, ion transport and exchange, including
								prolongation of the action potential, and depressed sarcoplasmic reticular
								calcium pumping and sarcolemmal Na/Ca exchange. Abnormalities of the
								contractile machinery have also been detected in mechanical studies in skinned
								strips, in addition to a V1 to V3 isomyosin switch. </P>
							 <P>STZ-diabetes mellitus is a reliable,
								well-characterized model. However, results are confounded by the fact that STZ
								is a general toxin which causes several other abnormalities in addition to
								diabetes mellitus, for example, hypothyroidism. Several other models of mild
								diabetes mellitus in rats, sometimes in combination with hypertension, have
								been studied, but in much more limited fashion. Alloxan is another toxin which
								has been used to produce diabetes mellitus, mainly in large mammals and more
								long-term preparations. Interestingly, these animals seem to have abnormalities
								of diastolic compliance in association with changes in the connective tissue
								matrix that are more prominent than defects in contractile performance. </P>
							 <P>Taken together, the clinical and experimental work
								have led to only limited insights into the mechanism(s) of diabetic
								cardiomyopathy. The direct effects of abnormal carbohydrate metabolism and
								excessive fatty acid oxidation have been implicated as an important proximate
								cause of diabetic cardiomyopathy in STZ treated rats. Free radical production
								with altered lipid content of membranes is one postulated mechanism. However,
								several other consequences of abnormal carbohydrate metabolism, for example,
								depressed pyruvate dehydrogenase activity and inadequate energy availability,
								have also been proposed to account for diabetic cardiomyopathy. Possible
								molecular/genetic mechanisms involved in diabetic cardiomyopathy in
								STZ-diabetes mellitus have in general not been well characterized.
								Microvascular disease and protein glycation/glycosylation, important mechanisms
								of complications in patients with diabetes mellitus, do not have particularly
								good counterparts in experimental models. The direct effects of hyperglycemia
								are also difficult to characterize in intact animals. Thus, the roles of these
								major components of diabetes mellitus in causation of diabetic cardiomyopathy
								have been particularly difficult to evaluate. </P>
							 <P>There has also been virtually no progress in
								characterizing the cellular and molecular features of diabetic cardiomyopathy
								in patients, much less their mechanisms. Defining cardiac changes in diabetic
								humans is obviously extremely important in light of the fact that diabetes is a
								chronic disease, not well represented by animal models. Moreover, it remains
								unclear whether there are differences between insulin dependent and non-insulin
								dependent forms of diabetes mellitus and what role insulin resistance plays in
								its development. </P>
							 <P>Finally, there remains some skepticism, particularly
								amongst clinicians, as to whether a distinct diabetic cardiomyopathy actually
								exists. The "conventional wisdom" is that if diabetic cardiomyopathy does exist
								its cause is diabetic vasculopathy, possibly of the microvasculature, despite
								the fact that there is no more support for this mechanism than for any of the
								other known complications of diabetes mellitus. The Working Group came to a
								rapid consensus that there is a wealth of evidence supporting the existence of
								diabetic cardiomyopathy as a major and distinct complication of diabetes
								mellitus, although there remain more questions than answers with regard to the
								underlying pathogenesis and pathophysiology. </P>
							 <P>AREAS OF CURRENT RESEARCH REVIEWED BY THE WORKING
								GROUP </P>
							 <P><U>Transformation of Normal to Abnormal Myocardium by
								Diabetes Mellitus: Role of Hyperglycemia and Protein Kinase C
								Activation</U><BR> There are multiple manifestations of diabetes mellitus that
								could potentially cause diabetic cardiomyopathy, including hyperglycemia per
								se, altered carbohydrate metabolism (increased fatty acid oxidation, altered
								energy metabolism), extracellular and intracellular protein glycosylation, and
								microvascular disease. A central, unresolved issue in the pathogenesis of
								diabetic cardiomyopathy is the relative contributions of specific
								manifestations of diabetes mellitus (e.g., hypo- or hyperinsulinemia,
								hyperglycemia, increased fatty acid oxidation, dyslipidemia) vs secondary
								effects of these manifestations on cell signaling (e.g., protein kinase C
								activation) and/or gene expression. In rodent models of diabetes mellitus (STZ,
								BB/Wor), concentric remodeling and hypertrophy of the left ventricle may be
								observed in association with "diastolic dysfunction". Increased expression of
								atrial natriuretic peptide and upregulation of angiotensin converting enzyme
								activity suggest that this process shares a number of features with other
								causes of pathologic hypertrophy. </P>
							 <P>One potential mechanism of diabetic cardiomyopathy is
								activation of protein kinase C as a response to hyperglycemia. Protein kinase C
								very likely has a critical signaling role in cardiac hypertrophy by virtue of
								its effects on angiotensin converting enzyme activity, nitric oxide synthase,
								the MAP kinase/early gene response system, and contractile proteins. In rodent
								models of diabetic cardiomyopathy, total protein kinase C activity is modestly
								increased. Preliminary data with respect to isoform specificity suggest that
								the -isoform may be selectively upregulated in STZ-diabetes mellitus, but other
								isoforms are selectively elevated in other forms of heart failure. Upregulation
								occurs before rather than after the appearance of left ventricular dysfunction.
								A mechanism that may serve as another source of diacylglycerol and amplify
								protein kinase C upregulation is activation of tyrosine kinase secondary to
								protein kinase C activation of angiotensin converting enzyme and increased
								angiotensin II production. Tyrosine kinase also activates the MAP kinase
								system. Finally, although phospholipase D activity is found to be decreased in
								diabetic myocardium, phosphotidate phosphohydrolase activity is increased,
								providing another source of diacylglycerol. </P>
							 <P>Low-dose ethanol is known to inhibit diacylglycerol
								and tyrosine kinase while upregulating protein kinase C. Treatment of
								STZ-diabetes mellitus rats with low-dose ethanol appears to prevent the
								structural changes and protein kinase C upregulation induced by STZ. Thus,
								complex signaling relationships between protein kinase C, tyrosine kinase ,
								angiotensin converting enzyme, and MAP kinase may be involved in both
								structural and biochemical changes during STZ-diabetes mellitus. </P>
							 <P>Exposure of isolated cardiac myocytes in a cell
								culture system to hyperglycemia is one approach to this aspect of diabetic
								cardiomyopathy, which allows stringent control of conditions and testing of
								discrete hypotheses. Maintaining cardiac myocytes in a hyperglycemic
								environment for only 1-2 days results in alterations in cellular
								electrophysiology and excitation-contraction coupling that are remarkably
								similar to those observed with short-term experimental diabetes mellitus.
								Specifically, the cellular action potential is prolonged, and cytosolic calcium
								clearing and relaxation are impaired. Suggested mechanisms include
								up-regulation of Ca<SUP>2+</SUP> currents, down-regulation of K<SUP>+
								</SUP>currents and Na/Ca exchange, and/or depressed sarcoplasmic reticulum
								calcium ATPase (SERCA-2) activation. The signaling pathway appears to involve
								N-linked glycosylation of certain proteins as well as elevated protein kinase C
								activity. Interfering with the processing of glucosamine or the inhibition of
								protein kinase C prevents these hyperglycemia-induced abnormalities. The
								effects of hyperglycemia on the myocyte do not seem to be caused by increased
								osmolarity, and they can be attenuated by certain antidiabetic agents (e.g.,
								metformin and troglitazone) but not by others (e.g., glyburide). Here again,
								preliminary evidence implicates a role for hyperglycemia-induced up-regulation
								of protein kinase C activity, in addition to intracellular glycosylation and
								changes in intracellular calcium concentration. One or more of these factors
								may then trigger changes in gene expression and potentially a host of other
								alterations in protein function. </P>
							 <P>Activation and upregulation of the signal transduction
								pathway involving diacylglycerol and protein kinase C has also been observed in
								human cardiomyopathy unrelated to diabetes mellitus. In diabetes mellitus, in
								addition to hyperglycemia, protein glycosylation and oxidative stress may also
								activate this pathway. As indicated, protein kinase C influences a multiplicity
								of cellular functions, including production of extracellular matrix, cytokines,
								contractile protein function, calcium handling and contractility, and growth
								responses (early response genes, MAP kinase). In heart failure, there is
								evidence that the isoform, and possibly the isoform, of protein kinase C are
								preferentially increased. To assess the consequences of increased protein
								kinase C- activity, both a specific inhibitor and a transgenic mouse that
								overexpresses protein kinase C- have been studied. The inhibitor may be capable
								of preventing some of the complications of experimental diabetes mellitus.
								Overexpression of protein kinase C- results in development of a cardiomyopathy
								characterized by hypertrophy, loss of myocytes, fibrosis and markedly depressed
								contractile function. mRNA for collagen, TGF-, -myosin heavy chain, ANF and
								c-fos are all increased. Thus, activation of protein kinase C is of
								considerable interest as a potential mechanism of diabetic cardiomyopathy. </P>
							 <P><U>Transgenic Models of Altered Glucose Metabolism:
								Role of the GLUT4 Transporter</U><BR> The glucose transporter protein, GLUT4,
								is normally the major glucose transport system. In insulin resistant diabetes
								mellitus, especially in association with obesity, reduced insulin transport
								into skeletal muscle and fat cells is the major metabolic defect. To better
								understand factors that regulate whole body insulin sensitivity and glucose
								transport, gene knockout technology has been employed to produce mice with one
								null allele of GLUT4 (+/-) and with a complete knockout of the GLUT4 gene
								(-/-). </P> 
							 <P>GLUT4 +/- mice develop a pattern closely resembling
								human type 2 diabetes mellitus. As expected, these animals have reduced GLUT4
								expression and glucose transport in muscle and adipose tissue, in addition to
								reduced glycolysis and glycogen synthesis. In an outbred genetic background,
								severe insulin resistance (quantified by euglycemic/hyperinsulinemic clamps)
								and a number of other pathologic changes noted in human type 2 diabetes
								mellitus are present, including hypertension, myocardial tissue changes
								consistent with a cardiomyopathy, and renal glomerular lesions. These changes
								occur in males only. Females are able to normalize glucose transport through as
								yet uncertain mechanisms. The phenotype in these animals is strongly dependent
								on age, progressing from normoglycemia/insulinemia, to
								normoglycemia/hyperinsulinemia, to hyperglycemia/insulinemia. Unlike human type
								2 diabetes mellitus, GLUT4 +/- mice do not become obese, although their
								adipocytes are enlarged. Thus, the GLUT4 +/- mouse has considerable potential
								for understanding the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy in
								insulin-resistant diabetes mellitus independent of coincident obesity.</P> 
							 <P>Interestingly, GLUT4 -/- mice, while exhibiting
								relatively subtle abnormalities of glucose and lipid metabolism including
								abnormal glucose clearance from the blood, do not become diabetic and do not
								display the sorts of diabetic complications seen in +/- mice. This is accounted
								for by upregulation of both the GLUT1 transporter and most likely another, as
								yet poorly characterized transport mechanism. Surprisingly, the -/- mice
								develop severe cardiac hypertrophy in the absence of hypertension, and yet have
								improved recovery of function following global ischemia-reperfusion when
								compared to the heterzygous animals. GLUT4 -/- animals, while not diabetic, may
								provide clues to interactions between abnormal transport mechanisms and stimuli
								for cardiac hypertrophy, as well as protection from ischemia. </P>
							 <P><U>Apoptosis and Ventricular Remodeling in Diabetes
								Mellitus</U><BR> Multiple abnormalities of both excitation-contraction coupling
								and the contractile machinery have been documented in STZ-diabetes mellitus,
								but a role for apoptosis in this model of diabetes mellitus has not previously
								been sought. This is pertinent in view of increasing evidence of apoptosis in
								other forms of cardiomyopathy. In addition, the relatively modest
								histopathologic changes in STZ-diabetes mellitus suggest the possibility of
								cell dropout due to apoptosis. </P>
							 <P>In preliminary studies designed to assess whether
								significant amounts of apoptosis occur after one month of STZ-diabetes mellitus
								in the rat, heart to body weight ratios were increased, but absolute heart
								weight was decreased because body weight fell faster than heart weight.
								Morphologic analysis revealed a 10% decrease in myocyte mass despite a 13%
								increase in myocyte cell volume. This apparent inconsistency was due to a
								remarkable, 28% decrease in total myocyte number in the left ventricle. As in
								previous studies of STZ-diabetes mellitus, histologic changes were modest.
								Studies using both TdT and Taq analyses of apoptosis suggest that both calcium
								and pH dependent DNAases are activated, and that necrosis may also occur
								despite the absence of histologic sequelae. Parallel in vitro studies in
								cultured myocytes suggest that hyperglycemia per se may be a stimulus for
								increased apoptosis. These preliminary studies suggest a previously
								unappreciated role for apoptosis and cell necrosis in STZ-induced diabetic
								cardiomyopathy. </P>
							 <P>The high mortality after acute myocardial infarction
								in diabetic patients is generally considered to be caused by an increased risk
								of heart failure. One possible explanation is that myocardial necrosis is
								superimposed on a pre-existing cardiomyopathic process, which reduces cardiac
								reserve. Another is that the remodeling process after acute myocardial
								infarction differs in patients with diabetes mellitus. An interaction of
								post-acute myocardial infarction remodeling and apoptosis is of interest
								because factors known to be operative in diabetes mellitus such as altered
								insulin levels, oxidative stress and growth factors, also influence apoptosis.
								</P>
							 <P>This interaction has been studied in vitro using a
								tissue culture model in which neonatal myocytes are first exposed to high
								glucose concentrations for three days followed by a hypoxic period as a
								surrogate for ischemia. High glucose treatment results in markedly reduced
								apoptosis following hypoxia. This is at least in part a generic response to
								osmotic stress. An alternative mechanism of protection may be related to
								hyperglycemia-induced changes in expression and/or phosphorylation (by tyrosine
								kinase) of BCL-2, which is known to be pro-apoptotic. It is unclear at present
								whether glucose protection against hypoxic apoptosis in vitro is relevant to in
								vivo remodeling in either a positive or negative fashion. </P>
							 <P><U>Role of Insulin-Like Growth Factor-1 in Diabetic
								Cardiomyopathy</U><BR> Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) promotes cardiac
								growth, exerts positive effects on contractility and relaxation, promotes
								relaxation of vascular smooth muscle, and is a potentially important
								paracrine/autocrine factor in the myocardium. IGF-1 is produced by both
								vascular smooth muscle cells and cardiac myocytes and is subject to multiple
								regulatory influences. In vascular smooth muscle, its effects appear to be
								mediated by increased nitric oxide production. In contrast, hyperglycemia
								decreases nitric oxide production. In rat papillary muscle preparations and
								isolated ventricular myocytes, IGF-1 causes dose-dependent increases in tension
								development/shortening and calcium<SUP> </SUP>transients, but does not alter
								relaxation parameters. These effects are attenuated by nitric oxide synthase
								inhibition. In STZ-diabetes mellitus rats (5-7 days), the above-mentioned
								effects of IGF-1 are not observed, suggesting an intrinsic defect at the level
								of the myocyte whose mechanism is unknown at present. Similarly, short-term
								STZ-diabetes mellitus results in loss of effects of IGF-1 on vascular muscle,
								although normal responses to norepinephrine and KCl are retained. Since IGF
								receptors are up-regulated in this model, the signaling pathway must be
								disrupted downstream of the receptors. The possibility that paracrine/autocrine
								factors (e.g., IGF-1) contribute to the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy
								is an area that has received little previous attention.</P> 
							 <P><U>Characterization of Diabetic Cardiomyopathy in
								Human Myocardium</U><BR> Hemodynamic and endomyocardial biopsy assessment of
								patients with heart failure presumed due to diabetic cardiomyopathy has been
								mentioned previously, as have noninvasive studies in patients without overt
								evidence of heart disease. There has been no assessment of abnormalities of
								myocardial function in patients with combined diabetes mellitus and coronary
								artery disease, who are at high risk for heart failure and death if they suffer
								acute myocardial infarction. Advances in tissue preservation now allow
								assessment of the in vitro mechanical performance of strips of left ventricular
								myocardium obtained via epicardial biopsy during surgery or from explanted
								hearts. Studies performed in myocardial tissue from patients with mitral
								regurgitation and dilated cardiomyopathy (without diabetes mellitus) reveal a
								key functional abnormality, depression of the force-frequency relation (FFR).
								The positive FFR probably results from increased calcium cycling as contraction
								frequency is increased and is a key mechanism whereby ventricular function is
								augmented during exercise. Depression of the FFR has been strongly correlated
								with depressed sarcoplasmic reticular calcium pumping and decreased expression
								of SERCA-2. Recently, this approach has been applied to patients with combined
								diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease who requires coronary artery
								bypass surgery. Patients selected for study had normal left ventricular
								contraction pattern, and no history of prior acute myocardial infarction or
								hypertension. They were compared to matched bypass surgery patients without
								diabetes mellitus. Left ventricular myocardial strips were stimulated to
								contract isometrically at varying contraction frequencies. In patients with
								combined diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease, contractile performance
								is normal at rest, but the FFR is depressed compared to patients with coronary
								artery disease alone. The extent of depression is intermediate between coronary
								artery disease patients and mitral regurgitation/diabetes mellitus. Preliminary
								results of simultaneous calcium transient measurements indicate that the
								amplitude of the transient decreases in parallel with force measurements,
								implicating abnormal calcium handling as a mechanism of FFR depression. These
								results represent the first<EM> in vitro</EM> documentation of an underlying
								cardiomyopathy in patients with combined diabetes mellitus and coronary artery
								disease, and may provide a mechanism whereby contractile performance is
								impaired, especially during stress, resulting in a high incidence of heart
								failure after acute myocardial infarction. </P> 
							 <P><U>Novel Therapeutic Approaches to Diabetic
								Cardiomyopathy</U><BR> 0000Until recently, the only therapy envisioned for
								prevention and treatment of the complications of diabetes mellitus has been
								tight control of blood glucose with insulin and/or oral hypoglycemic regimens.
								Results in general have been inconclusive. The recent introduction of agents
								that directly increase sensitivity to insulin (e.g., metformin and
								troglitazone) offer one new approach. Looking toward the future, application of
								gene therapy is of course of great interest. The ultimate efficacy of gene
								therapy will be linked to better understanding of the underlying
								pathophysiology of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Some recent developments with
								implications for gene therapy are indicative of the sorts of novel approaches
								that might be employed.<U></U></P> 
							 <P>One alteration in calcium handling proteins identified
								in rodent models of diabetes mellitus is decreased activity of SERCA-2. SERCA-2
								is also depressed in non-diabetic failing myocardium. A number of possibilities
								exist to explain this and other alterations in calcium handling, including
								reduced insulin signaling at the myocyte level, hyperglycemia per se, increased
								fatty acid oxidation and free radical production with damage to membrane
								lipids, and cytokine-mediated effects (e.g., interleukin-6 decreases SERCA-2
								expression). Increasing SERCA-2 activity is therefore a potential novel
								therapeutic approach to diabetic cardiomyopathy. To test this hypothesis, the
								effects of STZ-induced diabetes on contractile function in isolated hearts and
								papillary muscle strips have been tested in transgenic mice that overexpress
								SERCA-2. SERCA-2 overexpression resulted in partial restoration of function
								compared to wild type mice treated with STZ, supporting this as a therapeutic
								modality. Advances in <EM>in vivo</EM> viral transfection techniques offer the
								possibility of transfecting large numbers of myocytes with transgenes that
								would be particularly useful in treating the dysfunction (e.g., by interfering
								with the inhibitory action of phospholamban on SERCA-2).</P> 
							 <P>Recently, transgenic mice with modification of genes
								encoding proteins of oxidative metabolism have been developed. These animals
								may shed light on the relation between altered energy metabolism and depressed
								contractile function in diabetic cardiomyopathy and conceivably suggest targets
								for treatment. New genetic screening approaches to identify small molecules
								with potential use as drugs to protect the heart from metabolic injury are also
								of considerable interest. For example, a group of peptides selected for high
								affinity binding to DnaK, the bacterial orthologue of mammalian hsp70,
								demonstrate marked cytoprotection during substrate deprivation. Based on their
								binding affinity, this may be related to enhanced chaperone activity.</P> 
							 <P>Since skeletal muscle insulin-resistance is a major
								risk factor contributing to metabolic disturbances of diabetes mellitus,
								insight into the cellular mechanisms associated with these changes and the
								effects of drug interventions and exercise may greatly enhance the ability to
								treat and prevent diabetic cardiomyopathy. An example of this is the
								identification of intracellular signaling links between the firing of motor
								nerves controlling the activity of skeletal muscles and transcription of genes
								encoding proteins that are differentially expressed in Type I vs Type IIb
								muscle fibers. These discoveries could lead to novel approaches to increasing
								insulin sensitivity and beneficial effects with respect to diabetic
								cardiomyopathy. </P> 
							 <P>CONSENSUS RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE WORKING GROUP</P> 
							 <P>As indicated in the introductory comments above, the
								Working Group agreed that diabetic cardiomyopathy is an extremely important and
								complex problem and that very little progress has been made in understanding
								its underlying pathophysiology, specific manifestations and natural history in
								patients, and treatment. The Group especially wished to dispel any questions as
								to the existence of diabetic cardiomyopathy as a distinct entity and the notion
								that it is not worth detailed investigation because it is simply a consequence
								of diabetes mellitus-related vasculopathy. Vascular disease may certainly be a
								cause of diabetic cardiomyopathy, but this in no way diminishes its importance
								and/or the need for more knowledge in this area. The Group was particularly
								struck by the fact that poor outcomes due to cardiovascular disease in patients
								with diabetes mellitus, especially those due to heart failure, are associated
								with angioplasty as compared to coronary bypass surgery. In consideration of
								the above, the Working Group strongly recommends that diabetic cardiomyopathy
								be targeted as an area for special emphasis in research funding and supports
								the timely development of a Request for Applications (RFA) to support future
								investigations. The Working Group also felt that this is an area in which
								collaborative, multidisciplinary research is especially appropriate. The
								Working Group agreed that the following constitute the most promising areas for
								funding:</P> 
							 <OL> 
								<LI><EM>Research designed to identify basic mechanisms
								  of disease and novel therapeutic interventions using innovative molecular and
								  cellular approaches. </EM>Emphases should be on distinguishing and elucidating
								  the contributions of direct "toxic" effects of diabetes mellitus from those due
								  to altered gene expression. Correspondingly, the roles of altered organelle and
								  protein function vs cell death (either by necrosis or apoptosis) in the
								  pathophysiology of diabetic cardiomyopathy should also be established. A great
								  deal of effort should be focussed on the fundamental reasons for gender,
								  racial, and ethnic variations in diabetes mellitus and associated
								  cardiomyopathy.
								  <P> </P></LI>
								<LI><EM>The development and utilization of experimental
								  models with high relevance to human disease should be encouraged and used to
								  answer specific, mechanistic questions.</EM> Examples are: animals with insulin
								  resistance as a single risk factor and in combination with other risk factors
								  (e.g., hypertension and/or obesity), models that are particularly amenable to
								  testing novel therapeutic interventions, and longer-term models that better
								  simulate human disease.
								  <P> </P></LI>
								<LI><EM>Delineation of the connections between altered
								  intracellular signaling, including those related to glucose transport and
								  protein kinase C activation, and altered contractile function and cell death.
								  </EM>These mechanisms of disease have been largely unappreciated by
								  investigators working in the field until relatively recently.
								  <P> </P></LI>
								<LI><EM>A better understanding of the relation between
								  altered energy metabolism and myocardial function in diabetes mellitus in
								  particular and heart failure in general. </EM>Is there the possibility of a
								  unifying hypothesis related to abnormal fatty acid oxidation and what are the
								  key metabolic factors that contribute to diabetic cardiomyopathy? What is the
								  relation between "diastolic dysfunction" and energy metabolism?
								  <P> </P></LI>
								<LI><EM>Elucidation of the mechanisms contributing to
								  the modification of cardiac responses to ischemia -reperfusion and oxidative
								  stress in diabetes mellitus.</EM> Is this the key factor in the high mortality
								  of acute myocardial infarction in patients with diabetes mellitus? Does
								  substrate utilization in the diabetic heart influence responses to ischemia and
								  reperfusion?
								  <P> </P></LI>
								<LI><EM>Research designed to better characterize the
								  epidemiology and pathophysiology of diabetic cardiomyopathy in patients.
								  </EM>Recognizing the limitations of short-term animal models in relation to a
								  chronic and extraordinarily complex human disease, it is critical to better
								  characterize organ level and myocardial cellular/molecular alterations in
								  patients with diabetes mellitus.<EM> In vitro</EM> studies employing tissue
								  from patients and modern, non-invasive assessments of myocardial function and
								  metabolism (magnetic resonance spectroscopy/imaging, PET scanning,
								  echocardiography-Doppler and ultrasonic tissue characterization) are likely to
								  be most fruitful in delineating human natural history and pathophysiology.
								  Non-cardiac markers of diabetic cardiomyopathy (e.g., skeletal muscle
								  alterations, retinal vasculopathy) should also be sought. Clues gained from
								  these types of studies could be used to test mechanistic hypotheses relevant to
								  human disease. Other key areas are whether there are meaningful differences
								  between type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus and quantification of gender,
								  racial and ethnic differences. Establishment of a registry of patients with
								  diabetic cardiomyopathy based on noninvasive markers might be useful in
								  delineating genetic markers of diabetic cardiomyopathy and identifying high
								  risk patients, tracking disease incidence and natural history and providing a
								  framework for intervention trials.
								  <P> </P></LI>
								<LI><EM>Clinical trials to test specific
								  interventions.</EM> These could be designed to track clinical endpoints (death,
								  development of heart failure) and/or non-invasive markers as delineated above.
								  The list of potential interventions is large, for example, "tight control" of
								  blood glucose, insulin sensitizers, protein kinase C inhibitors and ACE
								  inhibitors, and is likely to increase in the future. A useful strategy might be
								  to establish a mechanism to perform relatively short-term, feasibility studies
								  followed by larger trials with longer term clinical endpoints when indicated.
