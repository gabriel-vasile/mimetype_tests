Each year as many as 25,000 Americans become blind from complications of <A HREF="http://www.niddk.nih.gov/DiabetesDocs.html">diabetes</A>, collectively known as diabetic eye
disease. Although diabetic eye disease includes cataracts and glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy is the most common eye
complication for people with diabetes. Many of these people could have avoided losing their eyesight, because diabetic
retinopathy can be successfully treated if diagnosed in a timely manner, according to the <A HREF="http://www.nei.nih.gov/">National Eye Institute </A>(NEI), a
component of the National Institutes of Health. 
<P>
Diabetes is the leading cause of new cases of blindness in people from the ages of 20 to 74 in this country. About half of the
nation's estimated 16 million people with diabetes have at least the early signs of diabetic retinopathy. 
<P>
In diabetic retinopathy, blood vessels swell and leak fluid in the retina, the tissue that lines the back of the eye. In some cases,
abnormal blood vessels grow on the retina. These vessels can bleed into the tissue, and in some advanced cases, cause the
retina to detach. As the disease progresses, the central part of the retina, which is crucial to vision, may swell. These changes
may lead to vision loss and blindness.
<P>
Diabetic retinopathy has no early warning symptoms. It can be detected only by a comprehensive eye examination in which the
pupils are dilated. The most important step people with diabetes can take to prevent blindness is to have a dilated eye exam at
least once a year to find out if there are any changes that could lead to vision loss. 
<P>
Another important reason to have frequent eye exams is that treatment with a laser has to be performed at a certain stage in the
disease to be most effective. Research supported by the NEI has shown that early detection and timely treatment is 95 percent
effective in preventing severe vision loss brought on by diabetic retinopathy. 
<P>
Although many people with diabetic retinopathy will never progress to the most serious form of the disease, frequent testing
will enable the doctor to monitor the patient's condition closely and thus determine the best time to do laser treatment. Since
most people do not develop any visual impairment until the disease has progressed considerably, delaying an eye exam until
symptoms occur can result in permanent loss of vision.
<P>
"During the last 25 years, researchers have made great progress in managing and treating diabetic eye disease," says Dr. Carl
Kupfer, NEI director. "Most people with diabetes do not have to expect blindness as a natural progression of their disease, if
they receive regular, complete dilated eye examinations. An annual dilated eye exam is one of the best ways people with
diabetes can prevent blindness and preserve their vision for life."
