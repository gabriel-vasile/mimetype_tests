                          FUNDUS PHOTOGRAPHY                                    
                                                                                
                                                                                
     A photograph of the ocular fundus of one eye was taken on examinees aged   
     40 years and over by a trained examiner in the mobile examination center   
     (MEC).  The protocol for this component did not detail any medical,        
     safety or other exclusions.  However, if the designated eye was            
     unavailable due to an extremely small pupil, severe corneal or lens        
     opacity, complete retinal detachment, or other reason, the other eye was   
     photographed.  If both eyes were unavailable, no photograph was taken.     
                                                                                
     Because the component was administered in the examination center, MEC      
     examination weights (WTPFEX6) should be used for data analysis.  For       
     more information on the use of sample weights in the analysis of           
     NHANES III data, refer to the NHANES III Analytic and Reporting            
     Guidelines (U.S. DHHS, 1996b).                                             
                                                                                
     Photographs of the ocular fundus were taken to determine the presence      
     of diabetic retinopathy, age-related maculopathy, and other retinal        
     diseases that are the leading causes of vision loss in the United          
     States.  A non-stereoscopic, color, 45-degree photograph, centered         
     between the optic nerve and the macula, was taken of one randomly          
     selected eye.  The camera used was a Canon CR4-45NM "non-mydriatic"        
     fundus camera, which incorporated the use of an infrared video camera      
     to allow photographs to be taken in a darkened examination room            
     without the use of dilating drops.                                         
                                                                                
     In a darkened room, the sphincter muscle of the iris normally relaxes,     
     allowing for dilation of the pupil, usually to 6-10 mm in diameter.        
     The technician observed the eye's natural dilation on a special video      
     monitor and took the color photograph with a single flash of white         
     light.  If the examinee wore a contact lens, the photograph was taken      
     directly through the contact lens.  The entire procedure usually took      
     less than six minutes.  Detailed information on the examination            
     procedure is in the Fundus Photography chapter of the Health               
     Technician's Manual (U.S. DHHS, 1996b).                                    
                                                                                
     The exposed film was mailed to the University of Wisconsin-Madison,        
     Department of Ophthalmology, where it was processed by a local             
     laboratory into transparencies that were evaluated for photographic        
     quality.                                                                   
                                                                                
     The ocular fundus images on the final transparencies were reviewed by      
     photograph graders to assess the presence of diabetic retinopathy,         
     age-related maculopathy, and other retinal diseases.  The grading          
     system used for classifying diabetic retinopathy was based on a

     The Modified Airlie House Classification of Diabetic Retinopathy slide     
     standards consist of 27 stereo pairs of color fundus photographs of        
     diabetic retinopathy and one slide depicting poor photographic quality.    
     The standard slides show diabetic proliferative disease and are used for   
     grading the severity of diabetic retinopathy.  The set is available with   
     a detailed chapter outlining its use and a sample grading form.            
     Additional information is available from The Fundus Photograph Reading     
     Center, c/o Michael Neider, WARF Building Room 450, 610 Walnut Street,     
     Madison, WI  53705.                                                        
                                                                                
     The fundus photography consultant provided extensive training to           
     technicians at their time of hire, and each technician's performance       
     was monitored in the field on a periodic basis.                            
                                                                                
     Two sources of nonsampling or measurement error were monitored             
     throughout the survey, the picture taking procedure and the image          
     grading procedure.  To ensure that adequate photographs were taken,        
     the technicians' performance was monitored by a review of photographs      
     at the University of Wisconsin and by review and retraining field          
     visits.  To evaluate the grading procedure, 1500 transparencies were       
     chosen at random for use in assessing inter- and intra-grader              
     reliability.  The Kappa statistic was chosen to assess agreement           
     (Fleiss, 1981).  The measures of agreement were generally good to          
     excellent and improved across time.                                        
                                                                                
     Data processing and editing were performed to ensure internal data         
     consistency.  Notes have been provided for variables requiring             
     additional explanation.

     FPP1020:  Fundus                                                           
                                                                                
          When the fundus was absent (FPP1020=00), the grader was               
          instructed to stop.  All ensuing fields, FPP1030 through FPP1270,     
          were then left blank by the grader.  During data processing, the      
          blank fields were recoded "88  Blank but applicable."                 
                                                                                
                                                                                
     FPP1060:  Gradability status                                               
                                                                                
          Not all photographs were gradable.  The principal reasons were        
          related to the camera (e.g., malfunction, poor focus, dirty lens)     
          and to the examinee (e.g., cataracts, eye movement, corneal           
          change, poor pupil dilation, lens implants).  The grader was          
          instructed to stop when the entire field was ungradable               
          (FPP1060=06), at which point the remaining fields were left           
          blank.  During data processing, the blank fields were recoded "88     
          Blank but applicable."

          This variable represents the current state of severity of retinopathy 
          in the eye.  As such, it differs from the summary diabetic retinopathy
          score (FPPSURET) which represents the combination of current and past 
          retinopathy status.                                                   
                                                                                
                                                                                
     FPP1230-FPP1266:  Drusen details                                           
                                                                                
          Drusen vary in appearance, merging at one end of the spectrum         
          with the normal fundus background and at the other end with           
          diffuse degeneration of the retinal pigment epithelium.  Typical      
          small drusen usually appear as individual, round, flat spots in       
          the plane of the retinal pigment epithelium.  They may be pale        
          yellowish-white, contrasting sharply with the surrounding retinal     
          pigment epithelium, or only slightly more pale than the retinal       
          pigment epithelium and easily overlooked, even with careful           
          examination of well-focused photographs.  Larger drusen typically     
          are yellow-white in color and often have visible thickness.  Some     
          have sharp margins and a solid, nodular appearance, whereas           
          others have indistinct margins and a softer, more liquid              
          appearance.  Drusen may be distributed as individual spots or may     
          appear to merge with adjacent drusen.                                 
                                                                                
          In NHANES III, two characteristics of drusen type (hard or soft)      
          and area were graded in a semi-quantitative fashion within and        
          outside the grid.  Small punctate drusen (usually less than 95        
          microns in diameter) were classified as hard drusen; larger           
          drusen were classified as soft.  No attempt was made to further       
          characterize soft drusen by appearance as soft distinct or            
          indistinct.                                                           
                                                                               
                                                                                
          Drusen area was estimated within a central circle of the grid,        
          within the grid, and outside the grid.  The area covered by           
          drusen was estimated by mentally moving together all hard or soft     
          drusen as if they were confluent and comparing this area with         
          those of standard circles.  The estimate of drusen area was           
          classified into one of four categories:  smaller than a circle        
          with a diameter of 95 microns (comparable to the 63-micron            
          diameter circle used in a 30-degree field), smaller than a circle     
          with a diameter of 375 microns (250-micron diameter in a              
          30-degree field), smaller than a circle with a diameter of 960        
          microns (640-micron diameter in a 30-degree field), or equal to       
          or larger than a circle with a diameter of 960 microns.               
                                                                                
                                                                                
     FPPPHOTO:  Photographic status                                             
                                                                                
          Fundus photographs were not taken on all examinees who came to        
          the mobile examination center.  The principal reasons were            
          refusal to cooperate, equipment failure, physical inability, and      
          insufficient time.
