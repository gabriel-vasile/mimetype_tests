ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDINGS
     

BROKER-DEALER, PENNY STOCK BARS – JOHN SALERNO

     John N. Salerno has been barred from association with a broker or dealer
     and  from  participating in an offering of penny stock.   The  sanctions
     were  ordered  in an administrative proceeding before an  administrative
     law  judge, following his plea of guilty, in U.S. District Court for the
     Middle District of Florida, to filing a false broker-dealer registration
     statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
     
     Salerno’s wrongdoing occurred while he was associated with The  Hamilton
     Shea  Group, Inc., a registered broker-dealer, where he participated  in
     an offering of Certified Diabetic Services, Inc., a penny stock.   (Rel.
     34-50943; File No. 3-11700)
     
SEC FILES CONTEMPT MOTION AGAINST MICHAEL LAUER

     The  Commission  announced that on December 9 it  filed  with  the  U.S.
     District  Court for the Southern District of Florida an Application  for
     an  Order  to Show Cause why Michael Lauer should not be held  in  civil
     contempt for violating the Court’s Nov. 8, 2004, Order Requiring Him  to
     Respond  to  Plaintiff’s First Set of Interrogatories by No  Later  Than
     Nov. 22, 2004.
     
     The  Commission’s  contempt application asserts  that  despite  multiple
     motions  by the Commission to Compel, four Court Orders requiring  Lauer
     to  provide full and complete responses, and subsequent motions  by  the
     Commission  to  hold Lauer in contempt, Lauer still refuses  to  provide
     full  and  complete  interrogatory responses.    On  December  16,  U.S.
     Magistrate Judge Ann E. Vitunac granted the Commission’s Application and
     ordered  Lauer  to show cause in writing within 10 days  why  the  Court
     should  not recommend to the District Court that Lauer be held in  civil
     contempt for violating the Nov. 8, 2004, Order.  [SEC v. Michael  Lauer,
     et al., Case No. 03-80612-CIV-MARRA/VITUNAC (S.D. Fla.)] (LR-19018)
     
SEC FILES APPLICATION FOR AN ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE WHY MICHAEL LAUER SHOULD NOT
BE HELD IN CONTEMPT FOR VIOLATING THE COURT’S DECEMBER 3, 2004, ORDER

     The  Commission  announced that on December 20 it filed  with  the  U.S.
     District  Court for the Southern District of Florida an Application  for
     an  Order  to Show Cause why Michael Lauer should not be held  in  civil
     contempt  for  violating the Court’s December 3 Order requiring  him  to
     provide a Rule 26 initial disclosure statement within five days.
     The  Commission’s  contempt  application asserts  that  even  after  the
     Commission   informed  Lauer  several  times  of  Rule  26’s  disclosure
     requirements  and provided him a copy of the Rule, and  even  after  two
     Court orders requiring him to provide disclosures, Lauer has refused  to
     do   so.   [SEC  v.  Michael  Lauer,  et  al.,  Case  No.  03-80612-CIV-
     MARRA/VITUNAC (S.D. Fla.)] (LR-19019)
