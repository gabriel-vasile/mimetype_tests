Enclosure 1

Which Truck and Bus Crashes Does FMCSA Want?

Report a crash to FMCSA via SAFETYNET if it involves:       
·	Any truck having a gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) of more than 10,000 pounds or a gross combination weight rating (GCWR) over 10,000 pounds used on public highways,
OR
·	Any motor vehicle designed to transport more than eight people, including the driver
OR
·	Any vehicle displaying a hazardous materials placard (regardless of weight)
[NOTE:  This criterion assumes that an officer at a crash site may not be familiar with the Federal Hazardous Materials Regulations (Specifically, 49 CFR Part 172).  If an officer or associate is knowledgeable in those, any vehicle discovered to be transporting hazardous materials without a required placard should also be included.]
AND
·	That vehicle is involved in a crash while operating on a roadway customarily open to the public, which results in:
o	A fatality:  any person(s) killed in or outside of any vehicle (truck, bus, car, etc.)  involved in the crash or who dies within 30 days of the crash as a result of an injury sustained in the crash;
o	An injury:  any person(s) injured as a result of the crash who immediately receives medical treatment away from the crash scene (1); OR
o	A tow-away:  any motor vehicle (truck, bus, car, etc.) disabled as a result of the crash and transported away from the scene by a tow truck or other vehicle.

EXCEPT

      Crashes that involve:
·	A personally-owned truck or passenger vehicle meant for personal use only as the sole vehicle meeting the criteria above, OR
·	A driver with a disease condition (stroke, heart attack, diabetic coma or epileptic seizure) and no other injury or damage occurs, (2), OR
·	Deliberate intent (suicide, self-inflicted injury, homicide, etc.), with no unintentional injury or damage (3).



(1) If an injury is initially reported to FMCSA on a crash report and the injured party dies within 30 days, an updated report should be uploaded to FMCSA.
