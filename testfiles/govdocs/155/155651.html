<center><h2>Saving Medicare</center></h2>
<hr>
Thank you. I'm proud to be part of this observance of Medicare's anniversary.  On this day, it's well worth 
remembering that prior to President Johnson signing Medicare into law, about half of older Americans had 
no health insurance.  And illness and injury too often made old age synonymous with poverty.   <p>

But we're not only here to salute Medicare's past.  We're here to stand up and speak out for Medicare's 
future.  Because since 1965, medicine has moved ahead, but Medicare hasn't always kept pace.  And 
nowhere is this more true than where prescription drugs are concerned.  <p> 

Prescription medicines play as vital a role in health care today as hospitals did when Medicare was created.  
But even though we know that prescription drugs -- when properly used -- can help Americans avoid some 
hospital stays entirely, today, millions of beneficiaries lack coverage and millions more are at risk for 
losing it.  <p>

That's why, on June 29th, President Clinton proposed the drug benefit beneficiaries need, but at a price 
America can afford.  It's part of a well crafted action-plan to modernize Medicare's benefits and strengthen 
its finances for years to come.  And that's never been more important than it is right now.<p>  

Because the fact is, over the next 30 years the number of Medicare beneficiaries will double.  And, unless 
we act now, the impact of this human tidal wave could put the promise of Medicare at risk.<p>

That's why it's so disappointing that rather than join with us to craft sensible solutions, the Republican 
leadership in Congress has called for a tax cut so large it would tie our hands - in effect adding to the 
problem.<p>

Woodie Guthrie once sang that some men will rob you with a six gun, while others will rob you with a 
fountain pen.  Well, if passed, this tax cut will rob America's families of the opportunity to have a modern, 
efficient Medicare system strong enough to meet the challenges of the 21st Century.<p>

But the huge tax cut that's been proposed won't only jeopardize our efforts to strengthen Medicare, it will 
have a devastating effect on the public services America's families depend on.  And perhaps even more 
importantly, it could derail our economic recovery.   <p>

Today, America is at a crossroad.  We could follow the path of enormous, budget busting tax cuts.  But 
America has already been down that road and it leads only to dead-ends and deficits.  Or, we could stand 
up and say that the best way to honor Medicare today is to strengthen and modernize it to meet the 
challenges of tomorrow.<p>

Thank you. <p>
