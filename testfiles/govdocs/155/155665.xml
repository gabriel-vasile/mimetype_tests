								</Objective><OtherInformation>Coastal areas are among the most developed in the Nation. More than half the population lives on less than one-fifth of the land in the contiguous United States. Coastal counties, including those along the Great Lakes, are growing three times faster than counties elsewhere, adding more than 3,600people a day to their populations. Coastal and marine waters support over28 million jobs and provide a tourism destination for 180 million Americans a year. The value of the ocean economy to the United States is over $115billion. The amount added annually to the national economy by the commercial and recreational fishing industry alone is over $48 billion, with an additional $6 billion in direct and indirect economic impacts from aquaculture. With its Exclusive Economic Zone of 3.4 million square miles, the United States manages the largest marine territory of any nation in the world.  NOAA has a unique mandate from Congress to be a lead federal agency in protecting, managing, and restoring these marine resources. To meet this mandate, our scientists, specialists, and external partners contribute world class expertise in oceanography, marine ecology, marine archeology, fisheries management, conservation biology, natural resource management, and risk assessment. To achieve balance among ecological, environmental, and social influences, we have adopted an ecosystem approach to management. We recognize the transition to an ecosystem approach must be incremental and collaborative. In pursuing this approach, we strive to integrate the concerns, priorities, and expertise of all citizens and sectors in the management of coastal and marine resources.  NOAA’s goal to conserve, protect, manage, and restore living marine resources and coastal and ocean resources is critical to the health of the U.S. economy. Increased public knowledge of ecosystems and the principles of sustainable development, and the active involvement of the public as stewards for coastal and marine ecosystem issues in their communities, are critical components of this mission. Developed countries such as the United States have a responsibility for stewardship of the marine ecosystem and for setting standards to protect and manage the shared resources and harvests of the oceans. Believing that it is possible to balance sustainable economic development and healthy functioning marine ecosystems, we seek to provide an example for the rest of the world in comprehensively managing resources of the world’s oceans and coasts.</OtherInformation>

								</Objective><OtherInformation>Climate shapes the environment, natural resources, economies, and social systems that people depend upon worldwide. While humanity has learned to contend with some aspects of climate’s natural variability, major climatic events, combined with the stresses of population growth, economic growth, and land-use practices, can impose serious consequences on society. The1997–98 El Niño, for example, had a $25 billion impact on the U.S. economy—property losses were $2.6 billion and crop losses approached $2 billion. Long-term drought leads to increased and competing demands for freshwater with related effects on terrestrial and marine ecosystems, agricultural productivity, and even the spread of infectious diseases. Decisions about mitigating climate change also can alter economic and social structures on a global scale. We can deliver reliable climate information in useful ways to help minimize risks and maximize opportunities for decisions in agriculture, public policy, natural resources, water and energy use, and public health. We continue to move toward developing a seamless suite of weather and climate products. Whereas the Weather and Water Goal aims to expand predictive capacity out to two weeks, the Climate Goal addresses predictions on timescales of up to decades or longer. In 2003, the U.S. Government formed the Climate Change Science Program (CCSP) to facilitate the creation and application of knowledge of Earth’s global environment through research, observations, decision support, and communication. The DOC, partnering with 12 other federal agencies, leads this nationwide effort (http://www.climatescience.gov/Library/stratplan2003/default.htm). At NOAA, climate performance objectives are virtually identical to CCSP goals and are managed by the Climate Office, which assures consistency among DOC, NOAA, and CCSP strategic goals. NOAA’s climate information, products, and services enable society to understand and respond to changing climate conditions. Together with our partners, we will accelerate the development of information to support climate policy decisions and plans that consider both climate variability and long-term climate change. We will direct our efforts and actions toward delivering trusted, timely information services to those who need and can use them.</OtherInformation>

								</Objective><OtherInformation>Floods, droughts, hurricanes, tornadoes, tsunamis, and other severe weather events cause $11 billion in damages each year in the United States. Weather is directly linked to public safety, and nearly one-third of the U.S. economy(~ $3 trillion) is sensitive to weather and climate. With so much at stake, NOAA’s role in understanding, observing, forecasting, and warning of environmental events is expanding. With our partners, we seek to provide decision makers with key observations, analyses, predictions, and warnings for a range of weather and water conditions, including those related to water supply, air quality, and space weather. Businesses are getting more sophisticated about how to use this weather and water information to improve operational efficiencies, to manage environmental resources, and to create a better quality of life. NOAA is strategically positioned to conduct sound, scientific research and provide integrated observations, predictions, and advice for decision makers who manage environmental resources, ranging from fresh water supplies to coastal ecosystems to air quality. Realizing our information and services bridge both weather and climate timescales, we will continue to collect and analyze environmental data and issue forecasts and warnings that help protect life and property, and enhance the U.S. economy. We recognize future needs can be met even better by exploring new concepts and applications, and we will invest in robust weather and water research. We are committed to excellent customer service. To that end, we depend on the U.S. weather enterprise, including our partners in the private sector, academia, and government, who add value to our information and services, and who help disseminate critical environmental information. We will work more closely with existing partners and will develop new partnerships so the public understands and is satisfied with our information. Together, we will expand services to support evolving national needs, including those associated with space weather, freshwater and coastal ecosystems, and air quality prediction.</OtherInformation>

								</Objective><OtherInformation>Safe and efficient transportation systems are crucial to the U.S. economy. The U.S. marine transportation system ships over 95 percent of the tonnage and more than 20 percent by value of foreign trade through U.S. ports, including48 percent of the oil needed to meet America’s energy demands. At least$4 billion is lost annually due to economic inefficiencies resulting from weather-related air-traffic delays. Improved surface weather forecasts and specific user warnings would reduce the 7,000 weather-related fatalities and 800,000 injuries that occur annually from crashes on roads and highways.  The injuries, loss of life, and property damage from weather-related crashes cost an average of $42 billion annually.  We provide information, services, and products for transportation safety and for increased commerce on roads, rails, and waterways. We will improve the accuracy of our information for marine, aviation, and surface weather forecasts, the availability of accurate and advanced electronic navigational charts, and the delivery of real-time oceanographic information. We seek to provide consistent, accurate, and timely positioning information that is critical for air, sea, and surface transportation. We will respond to hazardous material spills and provide search and rescue routinely to save lives and money, and to protect the coastal environment. We will work with port and coastal communities and with federal and state partners to ensure port operations and development proceed efficiently and in an environmentally sound manner. We will work with the Federal Aviation Administration and the private sector to reduce the negative impacts of weather on aviation without compromising safety. Owing to increased interest by the public and private sectors, we also will expand weather information for marine and surface transportation to enhance safety and efficiency.</OtherInformation>

								</Objective><OtherInformation>Strong, effective, and efficient support activities are necessary for us to achieve our Mission Goals. Our facilities, ships, aircraft, environmental satellites, data processing systems, computing and communication systems, financial and administrative offices, and our approach to management provide the foundation of support for all of our programs. This critical foundation must adapt to evolving mission needs and, therefore, is an integral part of our strategic planning. It also must support U.S. homeland security by providing NOAA services, such as civil alert relays through NOAA Weather Radio and air dispersion forecasts, in response to national emergencies. NOAA ships, aircraft, and environmental satellites are the backbone of the global Earth observing system and provide many critical mission support services. To keep this capability strong and current with our Mission Goals, we will ensure NOAA has adequate access to safe and efficient ships and aircraft through the use of both NOAA platforms and those of other agency, academic, and commercial partners. We will work with academia and partners in the public and private sectors to ensure future satellite systems are designed, developed, and operated with the latest technology. In addition, safe and adequate facilities and state-of-the art information technology are essential to the improvement of NOAA’s operations and service delivery. NOAA’s long-range facility planning and comprehensive maintenance planning are underway with the goal to ensure right-sized, cost-effective, and safe facilities. To achieve our Mission Goals, we must also commit to organizational excellence through management and leadership across a “corporate” NOAA. We will provide effective administrative, financial, and information technology services that enable us to deliver effective products and services. We will continue to improve the policy, programmatic, and managerial functions that support our Mission Goals. Our administrative and finance programs will ensure effective communication inside and outside NOAA, and efficient management of our assets, business processes, and financial resources.</OtherInformation>
