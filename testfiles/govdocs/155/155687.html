<h2 style=font-size:small>Firearms Safety Program</h2>
<dl>
<p>29.1&nbsp; <u>Purpose and Scope</u>.</p>
<dd>
<p>A.&nbsp; To specify the minimum Occupational Safety and Health Program (Program) requirements for the firearms safety program in the Department of the Interior (Department or DOI) and U.S. Geological Survey (Bureau or USGS).</p>

<p>B.&nbsp; The requirements covered in this Chapter apply to USGS personnel, volunteers, and those who work under USGS funding/direction who, in the performance of their official duties, are required to use government or personally owned firearms for protection against wild animal attacks or for specimen collection. A firearm is defined as any breech-loaded handgun or shoulder-fired small-arm from which a solid projectile is fired by gunpowder or compressed gas. Devices that resemble firearms and fire paper blanks, hypodermic darts, cracker shells, etc. can also cause serious injury. Safety training requirements for these firearm-like devices can be found under section 29.3.7 in this chapter and <a href="http://www.usgs.gov/usgs-manual/handbook/hb/445-2-h/a293.html">Appendix 29-3</a> in this Handbook.</p>

<p>B.&nbsp; State Firearm Laws and Regulations pertaining to firearms use, handling, transport, and storage.</p>

<p>C.&nbsp; In this chapter, the word “use” denotes use, handle, carry, or store; the word “personnel” denotes personnel, volunteers, and those who work under USGS funding/direction.</p>
</dl><dl>
<p>29.3&nbsp; <u>Requirements</u>.</p>
<dd>
<p>A.&nbsp; <u>Certificate of Need and Qualification Inquiry</u>.</p>
<dl><dd>
<p>(1)&nbsp; A Certificate of Need (<a href="http://www.usgs.gov/usgs-manual/handbook/hb/445-2-h/a291.doc">Appendix 29-1, Certificate of Need for Issuance of a Firearm for Official Use</a> shall be completed for all personnel authorized to use a firearm as part of their official duties. The Certificate of Need shall only be issued for the time frame required (Time Frame of Use) and, at no time, be issued to cover more than a 12-month period. An approved study plan is required for issuance of a Certificate of Need for specimen collection.</p>

<p>(2)&nbsp; Approval of the Certificate of Need shall be by a direct supervisor who has knowledge of their personnel’s firearm needs and training in firearms safety.</p>

<p>(3)&nbsp; Failure to return a government-owned firearm within 30 days of the termination of Time Frame of Use shall cause the user to be responsible for damage or theft of this sensitive property. Some of the general guidelines for sensitive property are that the item is:</p>
<dl><dd>
<p>(a)&nbsp; Stored in locked facilities when not in use.</p>

<p>(b)&nbsp; Removed from public view when leaving an unattended area for even short periods of time.</p>

<p>(c)&nbsp; Safeguarded when on travel status.</p>
</dl>
<p>(4)&nbsp; On September 30, 1996, 18 United States Code 992(g)(9) took effect, making it a felony for anyone convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence to possess firearms or ammunition. Personnel that use a firearm on official business shall fill out a Qualification Inquiry (<a href="http://www.usgs.gov/usgs-manual/handbook/hb/445-2-h/a292.doc">Appendix 29-2, Qualification Inquiry Form</a>) self-certifying they have not been convicted of such crimes prior to approval of the Certificate of Need or participation in firearms training. A new Qualification Inquiry shall be submitted for each new Certificate of Need or firearms training course.</p>
</dl>
<p>B.&nbsp; <u>Firearms Training</u>.</p>
<dl><dd>
<p>(1)&nbsp; Personnel cannot be certified to use a firearm without first successfully completing an appropriate USGS-approved Basic Firearms Certification Course (BFCC), which includes the 24-hour BFCC for Defense Against Wild Animals (Basic Defense Course) or the 8-hour BFCC for Specimen Collection (Basic Collection Course). The Basic Defense Course can suffice for certification for collection purposes. However, personnel carrying a firearm for both self-defense and specimen collection must first complete the Basic Defense Course. All firearms safety training must be documented by completion of Training Form SF-182.</p>

<p>(2)&nbsp; To recertify for defense purposes, an 8-hour USGS-approved Refresher Firearms Certification Course (RFCC) for Defense Against Wild Animals (Refresher Defense Course) must be attended annually in order to use government- or personally-owned firearms. Re-certification is valid for 12 months.</p>

<p>(3)&nbsp; The Basic Defense Course must be repeated if the person (1) does not use firearms and does not attend a Refresher Defense Course within a 2-year period, or (2) does not successfully complete the Refresher Defense Course. Poor performance or unsafe behavior by personnel using firearms also constitutes grounds for repeating the Basic Defense Course.</p>

<p>(4)&nbsp; To recertify for collection purposes, a 4-hour USGS-approved RFCC for Specimen Collection (Refresher Collection Course) is attended annually. The refresher training can be waived by the person’s supervisor if the person documents that they safely used firearms for specimen collecting the previous year.</p>

<p>(5)&nbsp; All hours of training specified for USGS Basic and Refresher Firearms Certification courses are to be considered the minimal number of contact hours required.</p>

<p>(6)&nbsp; Alternative firearms certification courses and training schedules may be substituted upon review and approval of the USGS Firearms Safety Committee or Regional Firearms Committee, if established. Any contractor should work directly with the USGS Firearms Safety Committee or Regional Firearms Committee, if established, to ensure that the contracted training is relevant to survey objectives. All USGS-approved Firearms Certification courses must cover the minimum firearms training standards specified in <a href="http://www.usgs.gov/usgs-manual/handbook/hb/445-2-h/a293.html">Appendix 29-3,USGS Minimum Firearms Training Standards for Contractors/Other Federal Bureaus</a>.</p>

<p>(7)&nbsp; Personnel who use devices that resemble firearms and that fire paper blanks, hypodermic darts, cracker shells, etc., shall complete safety training as detailed in <a href="http://www.usgs.gov/usgs-manual/handbook/hb/445-2-h/a293.html">Appendix 29-3, USGS Minimum Firearms Training Standards for Contractors/Other Federal Bureaus</a>, that includes, at a minimum:</p>

<p>(4)&nbsp; Each regional firearms committee should contain representatives from each regional science program that uses firearms.</p>
</dl></dl><dl>
<p>29.4&nbsp; <u>Recordkeepin</u>g.</p>
