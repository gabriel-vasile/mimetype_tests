    <h1>Formation of Carbonate Chimneys at the Lost City Hydrothermal Field</h1>

    <h2>White Giants</h2>
    <p>The spectacular chimneys at Lost City are the largest known hydrothermal
      vent structures in the ocean and grow 20-60 m (~65-200 feet) above the
      seafloor. The chimneys are composed of mainly limestone (calcium carbonate),
      the same type of rock found in caves or in hot springs such as Yellowstone
      National Park. Lost City chimneys have a very simple mineralogy and are
      dominated by a mixture of three minerals: aragonite, calcite (both polymorphs
      of calcium carbonate, CaCO<sub>3</sub>), and brucite (Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub>). All three of these
      minerals are typically white in color, giving the chimneys at Lost City
      the ghostly white appearance that stands out so well in the deep sea.</p>
    <div class="imgleft"><a href="media/beehive0.html" title="Beehive Deposit at Lost City"><img src="beehive0_220.jpg" width="220" height="235" border="0" alt="Beehive Deposit at Lost City" /></a>
        <p> This "beehive" deposit has formed on the side of another
          structure. It emits pH ~10 fluids that are ~90?C. These fluids are
          nearly particulate-free and can be seen shimmering above the top of
        the beehive cone. <em>Click image for larger view and image credit.</em> (HR)</p>

    </div>
    <h2>Flanges, Beehives, Fingers, and Towers</h2>
    <p>Not all of the structures at hydrothermal vent fields are large chimneys
      or towers. While these are the most common formations at both Lost City
      and black smoker sites, hydrothermal vents come in all shapes and sizes. This
      is mostly due to the nature of fluid flow through the chimneys. The most
      prominent feature at Lost City is the Poseidon complex. Aptly named after
      the mythological god of the sea, the main tower at Poseidon rises 60 m
      (nearly 200 feet) above the seafloor and has a "crown" of four
      individual chimneys (<em>fig. 1</em>) connected by carbonate saddles. Poseidon
      is flanked by large buttresses of smaller pinnacles and drapery formations
      that are reminiscent of cave deposits. On the sides of Poseidon and other
      chimneys are beautiful examples of different structures, such as "beehive" (<em>fig.</em><em>2</em>)
      formations and fragile flanges. Like an upside down bowl, flanges trap
      warm fluids that form a reflective pool that is typically an excellent
      site for fluid sampling. The buoyant fluids flow over the lip of the flange
      and sometimes through the roof of the flange, creating small, spindly chimneys
      on top of the flange (<em>fig. 3</em>). In other parts of the field
      are delicate carbonate chimneys that are just beginning to form. Some of
      these young deposits look like up-turned hands and fingers or seams in
      the wall rock, outlined in white carbonate. Talus of carbonate rubble and
      old splintered chimneys surround the base of most of the large structures
      in the field. </p>

        <p> This flange has fluids both trapped underneath and flowing through
          the top of it to form the smaller chimneys on the top. It is about
        1 m across. <em>Click image for larger view and image credit.</em> (HR)</p>

    </div>
    <h2>Chimney Geology on a Small Scale</h2>
    <p>When chimney samples from Lost City are cut in half, their cross section
      looks much like a kitchen sponge. In most Lost City chimneys, there appears
      to be no "pipe" through which the vent fluids flow, but instead
      there are loosely connected open spaces (pore spaces) through which fluids
      gently percolate upwards and outwards. </p>
    <p>To better understand the formation and development of the Lost City chimneys,
      samples of vent structures are cut into small pieces and then ground to
      a thickness thinner than a sheet of paper <em>(fig.4)</em>. These "thin
      sections" are mounted on glass slides and are examined using a petrographic
      microscope. Thin sections provide an additional means of analyzing the
      mineralogy, porosity, and petrographic textures of individual rock samples. Thin
      sections of young chimneys indicate that these vents are very porous (<em>fig.
      4</em>) and are filled with pockets of warm vent fluid that diffusely moves
      through the structures. These pore spaces are likely ideal habitats for
      microorganisms that thrive on and within the chimney walls. </p>
    <div class="imgleft"><a href="media/thinsection1.html" title="Microphotograph of Carbonate"><img src="thinsection1_220.jpg" width="220" height="222" border="0" alt="Microphotograph of Carbonate" /></a>
        <p> In a paper-thin section of a chimney from Lost City, a network of
          pore spaces (dark areas) define meandering fluid flow paths through
          walls of aragonite, brucite, and calcite. The wispy nature of the carbonate
          deposition may reflect nucleation of carbonate on bacterial that form
          long strands or filaments on the outside of actively venting chimneys. <em>Click image for larger view and image credit.</em></p>

    </div>
    <h2>Precipitation of Calcium Carbonate on the Seafloor</h2>
    <p>The hydrothermal fluid emitted from the chimneys at Lost City has a very
      high pH (9-11) and carries up to three times the amount of calcium as seawater.
      When calcium-rich fluid with high pH mixes with relatively acidic seawater
      (pH ~8), the calcium in the fluids combines with carbonate and bicarbonate
      from seawater to precipitate aragonite and calcite (CaCO<sub>3</sub>). This is known
      as a "buffer reaction" and is very common in marine systems.
      The mineral brucite (Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub>) precipitates from the mixing of hydroxide-rich
      fluids with magnesium from seawater. These mineral deposits continuously
      build on one another to form the Lost City chimneys. Both aragonite and
      brucite are only stable at warmer temperatures, so actively venting chimneys
      that are bathed in warm vent fluid contain all three of these minerals,
      while inactive older structures are dominated by calcite.</p>
    <p>In the oceans, calcium carbonate dissolves below a certain depth, known
      as the "calcium carbonate compensation depth" or CCD. In the
      Atlantic, the CCD is at ~4000 m, well below the depth of Lost City, so
      that the chimneys are preserved.</p>
    <h2>How old is Lost City?</h2>
    <p>Although Lost City was just discovered in 2000, it has been venting for
      at least 30,000 years. Scientists have used radiocarbon dating to determine
      the age of some of the carbonate chimneys at Lost City. Some of the actively
      venting samples are very young and are only 0 (modern) to ~500 years old.
      Other samples range in age from hundreds of years to more than 25,000 years
      old. Although 30,000 years seems like a long time, the vent field is relatively
      young compared to the 1.5 million year old ocean crust on which it has
      formed. </p>
    <p>Understanding the chemistry, formation, and evolution of the Lost City
      chimneys contributes to piecing together the puzzle of the geologic history
      of this unique site and ultimately may help determine how Lost City began
      and what types of features explorers should look for in the future when
      searching for new vent sites similar to Lost City.</p>
