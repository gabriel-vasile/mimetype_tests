 MEMORANDUM  OPINION  AND  ORDER 
 Adopted:  June  14,  2002  Released:  June  20,  2002 
 By  the  Commission: 
 I.  INTRODUCTION 
 1.  In  this  Memorandum  Opinion  and  Order  (“  Order”),  we  resolve  two  complaint  proceedings  that  we  have  consolidated  for  administrative  convenience.  1  First,  we  grant  in  part 


 1  AT&  T  Corp.  v.  Beehive  Telephone  Co.,  Inc.  and  Beehive  Telephone  Inc.  Nevada,  and  Beehive 
 Telephone  Co.,  Inc.  and  Beehive  Telephone  Inc.  Nevada  v.  AT&  T  Corp.,  Letter  from  Russell  D.  Lukas,  Counsel  for  Beehive  Telephone  Co.,  to  Thomas  D.  Wyatt,  Associate  Chief,  Enforcement  Division,  Common  Carrier  Bureau,

 and  dismiss  and  deny  in  part  a  formal  complaint  that  AT&  T  Corporation  (“  AT&  T”)  filed  against  Beehive  Telephone  Company,  Inc.  and  Beehive  Telephone,  Inc.  Nevada  (collectively,  “Beehive”) 
 pursuant  to  section  208  of  the  Communications  Act  of  1934,  as  amended  (“  Act”  or  “Communications  Act”).  2  Second,  we  dismiss  and  deny  in  its  entirety  a  formal  complaint  that 
 Beehive  filed  against  AT&  T  pursuant  to  section  208  of  the  Act.  3 
 2.  In  its  complaint,  AT&  T  alleges  that  Beehive  exceeded  its  authorized  rate  of  return  and  engaged  in  various  unlawful  billing  practices,  in  violation  of  sections  201(  b)  4  and  203(  c)  5  of 
 the  Act.  6  In  addition,  AT&  T  alleges  that  an  access  revenue-  sharing  arrangement  between  Beehive  and  an  information  service  provider  to  which  Beehive  terminated  traffic  breached 
 Beehive’s  common  carrier  duties,  in  violation  of  section  201(  b)  of  the  Act,  7  and  constituted  unreasonable  discrimination,  in  violation  of  section  202(  a)  of  the  Act.  8  We  grant  AT&  T’s 
 claims  that  Beehive  violated  section  203(  c)  of  the  Act  by  failing  to  comply  with  various  billing  requirements  of  Beehive’s  effective  tariff.  We  also  grant  AT&  T’s  claims  that  Beehive  violated 
 section  203(  c)  of  the  Act  by  failing  to  comply  with  its  tariff’s  requirements  regarding  billing  access  charges  based  upon  call  attempts,  but  only  as  to  liability  and  not  as  to  damages.  We 
 further  grant  AT&  T’s  claims  that  Beehive  exceeded  its  authorized  rate  of  return,  but  only  as  to  liability  and  not  as  to  damages.  Finally,  on  the  basis  of  the  facts  and  arguments  presented  in  this 
 record,  we  deny  AT&  T’s  claims  regarding  the  access  revenue-  sharing  arrangement  between  Beehive  and  the  information  service  provider,  because  AT&  T  has  failed  to  meet  its  burden  of 
 demonstrating  that  this  arrangement  violated  either  section  201(  b)  or  section  202(  a)  of  the  Act.  9

 5  47  U.  S.  C.  §  203(  c).  Section  203(  c)  of  the  Act  states  that  a  carrier  must  provide  communications 
 services  in  strict  accordance  with  the  terms  and  conditions  contained  in  its  tariff.  47  U.  S.  C.  §  203(  c).  6

 (affirming  that  the  complainant  in  a  proceeding  conducted  under  section  208  of  the  Act  bears  the  burden  of  proof).  We  also  dismiss  as  moot  AT&  T’s  billing  claims  under  section  201(  b)  of  the  Act,  because  they  are  based  on  the 


 same  facts,  and  seek  the  same  relief,  as  the  claims  under  section  203(  c)  that  we  grant.

 3.  In  its  complaint,  Beehive  alleges  conditionally  that,  if  (and  only  if)  the  Commission  grants  AT&  T’s  claims  that  Beehive’s  access  revenue-  sharing  arrangement  was 
 unlawful,  then  the  Commission  must  also  grant  Beehive’s  claims  that  certain  of  AT&  T’s  billing  arrangements  with  customers  violated  sections  201(  b),  203,  and  228  (the  Telephone  Disclosure 
 and  Dispute  Resolution  Act  (“  TDDRA”))  of  the  Act  for  precisely  the  same  reasons.  10  Beehive  also  alleges  that  AT&  T  violated  sections  1.17  11  and  1.729(  b)  12  of  the  Commission’s  rules  by 
 failing  to  disclose  certain  information  in  the  AT&  T  Complaint  proceeding.  13  Because  we  deny  AT&  T’s  claims  that  Beehive’s  access  revenue-  sharing  arrangement  was  unlawful,  the  condition 
 precedent  pled  by  Beehive  has  not  been  satisfied,  and  thus  we  dismiss  Beehive’s  claims  under  sections  201(  b),  203,  and  228  of  the  Act.  In  addition,  we  deny  Beehive’s  claims  under  sections 
 1.17  and  1.729(  b)  of  the  Commission’s  rules,  because  Beehive  has  failed  to  meet  its  burden  of  demonstrating  that  AT&  T  deliberately  failed  to  disclose  material  information  in  the  AT&  T 
 Complaint  proceeding. 
 II.  BACKGROUND 
 4.  At  all  relevant  times,  Beehive  was  an  incumbent  local  exchange  carrier  (“  LEC”)  located  in  rural  Utah  and  Nevada  that  served  approximately  700  access  lines.  14  Beehive  provided 
 local  exchange  service  to  end  user  customers,  and  exchange  access  services  to  AT&  T  and  other  interexchange  carriers  (“  IXCs”).  15 


 5.  Prior  to  March  31,  1994,  Beehive  charged  IXCs  access  rates  at  the  levels  contained  in  the  interstate  access  tariff  filed  by  the  National  Exchange  Carrier  Association 
 (“  NECA”)  on  behalf  of  its  member  companies.  16  The  NECA  tariff  specified  a  rate  of

 11  47  C.  F.  R.  §  1.17.  Section  1.17  of  the  Commission’s  rules  forbids  a  carrier  from  making  “any 
 misrepresentation  or  willful  material  omission  bearing  on  any  matter  within  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Commission.”  47  C.  F.  R.  §  1.17. 


 12  47  C.  F.  R.  §  1.729(  b)  (1996).  At  the  relevant  time,  section  1.729(  b)  of  the  Commission’s  rules 
 required  interrogatories  to  be  answered  “fully  in  writing  under  oath  or  affirmation.”  Id.  That  obligation  now  appears  in  section  1.729(  e)  of  our  rules.  47  C.  F.  R.  §  1.729(  e)  (2001).

 approximately  $.  07  per  terminating  access  minute.  17  On  March  31,  1994,  pursuant  to  section  61.39  of  the  Commission’s  rules,  18  Beehive  withdrew  from  the  NECA  tariff  and  filed  its  own 
 interstate  access  tariff  (“  Tariff”)  specifying  a  terminating  interstate  access  rate  of  $.  47  per  minute.  19  That  Tariff  became  effective  on  July  1,  1994.  20  Although  it  contained  its  own  access 
 rates,  Beehive’s  Tariff  explicitly  incorporated  the  non-  rate  regulations,  terms,  and  conditions  for  access  services  set  forth  in  NECA’s  Tariff  F.  C.  C.  No.  5.  21  As  of  July  1,  1995,  Beehive  reduced 
 its  interstate  access  rate  to  $0.14  per  terminating  minute.  22 
 6.  In  October,  1994,  Beehive  entered  into  an  access  revenue-  sharing  arrangement  with  Joy  Enterprises,  Inc.  (“  Joy”),  an  information  service  provider  to  which  Beehive  terminated 
 traffic.  23  Initially,  the  compensation  arrangement  required  Beehive  to  pay  Joy  $.  04  per  access  minute  for  each  long  distance  call  terminated  to  Joy;  eventually,  in  October,  1995,  the 
 compensation  was  adjusted  to  a  flat-  rate  of  $84,000  per  month.  24  Subsequently,  in  January,  1997,  the  amount  was  reduced  to  $42,000  per  month.  25

 III.  DISCUSSION 
 A.  Beehive  Violated  Section  203(  c)  of  the  Act  By  Imposing  Access  Charges  on  AT&  T  For  Unsuccessful  Call  Attempts. 


 7.  AT&  T  alleges  —  and  Beehive  admits  —  that  Beehive  charged  AT&  T  for  terminating  unsuccessful  long-  distance  call  attempts,  i.  e.,  calls  that  did  not  terminate  to  the  end 
 user,  due  to  either  a  “no  answer”  or  “busy  signal”  at  the  called  number.  26  AT&  T  maintains  that  this  practice  contradicted  the  terms  of  Beehive’s  Tariff,  in  violation  of  section  203(  c).  27  For  the 
 following  reasons,  we  agree. 
 8.  As  the  parties  acknowledge,  Beehive  “was  absolutely  bound  by  section  203(  c)  .  .  .  to  provide  access  services  in  exact  accordance  with  its  tariff.”  28  The  parties  also  agree  that 
 section  2.6  of  NECA  Tariff  F.  C.  C.  No.  5  governed  whether  Beehive  could  properly  impose  access  charges  for  terminating  unsuccessful  call  attempts.  29  This  Tariff  section  provided,  in 
 pertinent  part: 
 For  the  purpose  of  calculating  chargeable  usage,  the  term  ‘Access  Minutes’  denotes  customer  usage  of  exchange  facilities  in  the  provision  of 
 interstate  or  foreign  service.  .  .  .  On  the  terminating  end  of  an  interstate  or  foreign  call,  usage  is  measured  from  the  time  the  call  is  received  by  the 
 end  user  in  the  terminating  exchange.  Timing  of  usage  at  both  originating  and  terminating  ends  of  an  interstate  or  foreign  call  shall  terminate  when 
 the  calling  or  called  party  disconnects,  whichever  event  is  recognized  first  in  the  originating  and  terminating  exchanges,  as  applicable.  30

 primarily  to  insure  that  carriers  file  all  rates  and  regulations  in  their  tariffs  and  abide  by  them  upon  all  occasions.”),  vacated  and  remanded  on  other  grounds,  AT&  T  Corp.  v.  FCC,  86  F.  3d  242  (1996).  See  also  Philippine  Long

 5.  This  did  not  violate  any  existing  rule,  however.  At  the  time  the  complaint  was  filed  in  this  proceeding,  section  1.720(  h)  of  the  Commission’s  rules  merely  encouraged  parties  to  provide  copies  of  any  relevant  tariff  provisions. 
 47  C.  F.  R.  §  1.720(  h)  (1996).  This  rule  has  since  been  revised  to  require  that  parties  provide  copies  of  relevant  tariff  provisions.  47  C.  F.  R.  §  1.720(  h)  (2001). 
 30  NECA  Tariff  F.  C.  C.  No.  5,  Section  2.6,  Definitions,  Access  Minutes  (emphasis  added).  Because

 9.  We  interpret  this  Tariff  provision  to  mean  that  usage  for  which  Beehive  may  impose  access  charges  on  AT&  T  does  not  begin  to  accrue  until  a  called  party  “receives”  a  call. 
 Under  this  provision,  a  called  party  does  not  “receive”  a  call  that  goes  uncompleted  (generally  due  to  a  no  answer  or  busy  signal  at  the  called  number);  rather,  a  called  party  “receives”  a  call 
 only  when  that  party  actually  answers  it.  Our  interpretation  of  the  tariff  term  “receive”  comports  with  the  common  understanding  of  the  word.  For  example,  the  dictionary  definition  of  “receive” 
 is,  in  pertinent  part:  “1.  take  or  accept  (something  offered  or  given)  into  one’s  hands  or  possession.  .  .  .  3.  accept  delivery  of  (something  sent).  31  A  called  party  does  not  “take”, 
 “accept”,  or  “accept  delivery  of”  a  call  until  he/  she  answers  it.  Thus,  under  the  pertinent  tariff  provision,  an  uncompleted  call  generates  no  usage  for  which  Beehive  may  impose  access 
 charges  on  AT&  T. 
 10.  To  try  to  counter  this  reading,  Beehive  only  points  out  that,  under  the  Tariff,  the  timing  of  usage  “terminate[  s]  when  the  calling  or  called  party  disconnects.  .  .  .”  32  Based  on  this 
 observation,  Beehive  argues  that  it  can,  in  fact,  charge  for  uncompleted  calls,  because  a  calling  party  can  “disconnect”  a  call  even  when  the  called  party  never  picks  up.  33  This  reading  of  the 
 Tariff  fatally  ignores  the  fact  that  the  standard  for  determining  when  usage  terminates  does  not  even  apply  unless  and  until  the  standard  for  determining  when  usage  begins  has  been  met.  As 
 explained  above,  an  uncompleted  call  does  not  meet  that  latter  standard.  Consequently,  Beehive’s  practice  of  imposing  access  charges  on  AT&  T  for  terminating  uncompleted  calls 
 violated  Beehive’s  Tariff  and,  thus,  section  203(  c)  of  the  Act. 
 11.  AT&  T’s  Complaint  requests  an  order  requiring  Beehive  “to  refund  AT&  T  all  amounts  which  [Beehive]  has  unlawfully  charged  [AT&  T]  in  connection  with”  uncompleted 
 calls.  34  However,  AT&  T  has  neither  submitted  evidence  regarding  the  appropriate  amount  of  such  a  refund,  nor  sought  bifurcation  of  this  proceeding  to  make  a  complete  damages  showing  in 
 a  subsequent  action.  35  Perhaps  this  is  because  the  parties  have  agreed  to  an  arbitration  mechanism  to  resolve  billing  disputes,  or  because  AT&  T  can  assert  these  unlawful  charges  as  a 
 claim  or  an  offset  in  the  Utah  Court  Action.  36  In  any  event,  based  on  this  record,  we  find  that 
 neither  party  submitted  into  the  record  the  version  of  section  2.  6  of  NECA  Tariff  F.  C.  C.  No.  5  that  was  effective  during  the  relevant  period,  we  quote  from  the  currently  effective  version  of  NECA  Tariff  No.  5  (which  is  available 
 on  the  Commission  web  site  at  http://  svartifoss2.  fcc.  gov/  cgi-  bin/  ws.  exe/  prod/  ccb/  etfs/  webpublic/  search.  hts),  and  assume  that  the  current  version  does  not  materially  differ  from  the  version  in  effect  at  the  relevant  time.

 AT&  T  has  established  that  Beehive’s  conduct  regarding  uncompleted  calls  violated  section  203(  c)  of  the  Act  but  has  not  proven  damages.  37 
 12.  Accordingly,  we  grant  Count  Nine  of  AT&  T’s  Complaint  as  to  liability,  but  deny  Count  Nine  as  to  damages.  38  We  express  no  opinion,  however,  as  to  whether  AT&  T  may  pursue 
 a  damages  claim  in  the  Utah  Court  Action  or  in  the  parties’  arbitration.  39 
 B.  Beehive  Violated  Section  203(  c)  of  the  Act  By  Failing  to  Comply  With  Certain  Other  Billing  Requirements  of  Its  Tariff. 


 13.  AT&  T  argues  that  Beehive  violated  section  203(  c)  of  the  Act  by  “consistently  and  intentionally”  40  submitting  bills  to  AT&  T  for  access  services  that  were  “seriously  inaccurate,”  41 
 confusing,  and  non-  compliant  with  the  billing  requirements  of  Beehive’s  own  Tariff.  42  According  to  AT&  T,  the  most  egregious  problems  were  “inconsistent  and  overlapping  time 
 periods  contained  in  each  bill  and  the  intentionally  deceptive  manner  in  which  Beehive  identifies  the  days  on  which  terminating  usage  accrued.”  43  Specifically,  AT&  T  maintains  that  Beehive’s 
 bill  dates  varied,  Beehive’s  billing  periods  ranged  from  three  days  to  thirty-  eight  days,  Beehive’s  bills  often  included  charges  for  usage  incurred  outside  the  billing  period,  and  Beehive  billed 
 some  days  twice  or  not  at  all.  44  Moreover,  AT&  T  asserts  that  Beehive  identified  some  of  the  dates  on  its  bills  through  the  use  of  the  Julian  calendar,  instead  of  the  modern  calendar,  which  is 
 known  as  the  Gregorian  calendar.  45  According  to  AT&  T,  the  Julian  calendar  is  approximately 


 37  Beehive  alleges  that  the  Filed  Rate  Doctrine  bars  AT&  T’s  claim  of  overcharges  based  on  charges 
 for  uncompleted  calls.  Beehive  Answer  at  8,  ¶¶  50-  52.  This  defense  is  patently  meritless.  To  the  extent  that  Beehive  billed  AT&  T  in  violation  of  its  Tariff  and  the  Act,  the  Filed  Rate  Doctrine  provides  no  shelter.  See,  e.  g., 


 AT&  T  Corp.  v.  Business  Telecom,  Inc.,  Memorandum  Opinion  and  Order,  16  FCC  Rcd  12312,  12317-  18,  ¶  9  (2001). 
 38  In  addition,  we  dismiss  as  moot  Count  Eight  of  AT&  T’s  Complaint  because,  although  based  on 
 section  201(  b)  rather  than  section  203(  c),  Count  Eight  is  identical  in  all  other  material  respects  to  Count  Nine.  39 
 This  is  because  this  proceeding  stems  from  a  primary  jurisdiction  referral.  See  paragraph  24,  infra.

 45  AT&  T  Complaint  at  5,  ¶  13;  AT&  T  Initial  Brief  at  20;  AT&  T  Reply  Brief  at  23.  The  Julian 
 calendar  was  adopted  by  Julius  Caesar  in  46  B.  C.  E.  The  Julian  calendar  closely  resembles  the  Gregorian  calendar,  as  both  derive  from  365  days  divided  into  twelve  months.  By  the  thirteenth  century,  however,  scholars  realized  that 


 the  Julian  calendar  included  a  minor  flaw,  which  resulted  in  the  calendar  slowly  becoming  out  of  sync  with  the  solar  year.  The  flaw  was  this:  under  the  Julian  calendar,  a  year  was  365.25  days  long  (i.  e.,  an  extra  day  was  inserted 
7

 13  days  ahead  of  the  Gregorian  calendar,  and  has  not  been  observed  since  the  16  th  century.  46  As  evidence  of  all  these  practices,  AT&  T  submits  three  bills  it  received  from  Beehive  and  an  AT&  T 
 staff  analysis  of  alleged  discrepancies  in  173  Beehive  bills  (“  AT&  T  Chart”).  47 
 14.  As  explained  above,  section  203(  c)  of  the  Act  requires  that  a  carrier  adhere  to  the  terms  of  its  published  tariff.  48  As  also  explained  above,  Beehive’s  Tariff  incorporated  by 
 reference  the  non-  rate  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  NECA  Tariff  F.  C.  C.  No.  5.  49  That  Tariff  clearly  specified  that  the  minimum  billing  period  would  be  one  month;  that  Beehive  would 
 establish  a  uniform  bill  date  each  month  that  would  not  change  except  upon  sixty  days’  notice  to  AT&  T;  and  that  Beehive  would  not  double-  bill  for  the  same  usage.  50  Beehive  admits  that  it 
 failed  to  comply  with  the  first  two  of  these  requirements.  51  Beehive  explains  that  it  could  not  adhere  to  a  standard  billing  cycle  of  at  least  one  month  because  (i)  it  depended  on  data  from  US 
 West,  which  data  often  arrived  out  of  sequence  and  overdue,  and  (ii)  its  billing  systems  experienced  problems.  52  Even  if  factually  correct,  these  explanations  do  not  excuse  Beehive 


 every  fourth  year,  typically  known  as  a  “leap  year”).  This  significantly  differs  from  the  “real”  length  of  the  solar  year,  which  is  approximately  365.242199  days  long.  This  error  amounted  to  slightly  more  than  11  minutes  per  year. 
 As  a  result,  as  the  centuries  passed,  the  Julian  calendar  became  increasingly  inaccurate  with  respect  to  the  seasons.  By  the  16  th  century,  the  Julian  calendar  was  running  nearly  two  weeks  late.  To  fix  this  growing  problem, 
 astronomers  proposed  eliminating  ten  days  from  the  calendar  and  changing  the  rules  regarding  leap  years.  Pope  Gregory  XIII  adopted  this  proposal  in  1582.  Thus,  under  the  Gregorian  calendar,  “leap  year”  is  skipped  three  times 
 every  four  hundred  years.  See  “Calendar,”  15  ENCYCLOPEDIA  BRITANNICA  432,  444-  46  (15  th  ed.,  1991);  Peter  Meyer,  “The  Julian  and  Gregorian  Calendars,”  http://  serendipity.  magnet.  ch/  hermetic/  cal_  stud/  cal_  art.  htm;  L.  E.

 AT&  T  Complaint  at  5,  ¶  13;  AT&  T  Initial  Brief  at  20.  AT&  T  is  incorrect.  Although  Pope  Gregory  XIII  issued  a  papal  decree  establishing  the  Gregorian  calendar  in  1582,  several  nations  continued  to  use  the 


 Julian  calendar  for  some  time  thereafter.  For  example,  Britain  (and  the  British  colonies,  such  as  America)  continued  to  use  the  Julian  calendar  until  1752.  Other  countries  that  continued  to  use  the  Julian  calendar  include  Sweden 
 (switched  in  1753),  Japan  (1873),  Egypt  (1875),  the  Soviet  Union  (1918),  and  Turkey  (1927),  to  name  just  a  few.  Alaska  retained  the  Julian  calendar  until  1867,  when  it  was  transferred  from  Russia  to  the  United  States.  See

 Although  no  provision  of  the  NECA  tariff  expressly  prohibits  double  billing,  this  duty  is  implied  throughout  section  2.  4.  1.  For  example,  section  2.  4.  1(  B)  states  that  Beehive  “shall  bill  on  a  current  basis  all  charges  incurred  by  and

 from  the  obligation  to  comply  with  its  Tariff.  Moreover,  AT&  T  has  submitted  substantial  evidence  of  numerous  and  prolonged  billing  errors,  which  Beehive  does  not  refute.  53  Thus, 
 AT&  T  has  met  its  burden  of  proving  that  Beehive  violated  section  203  of  the  Act  by  committing  numerous  billing  errors  and  by  failing  to  adhere  to  a  standard  billing  cycle  of  at  least  one 
 month.  54 
 15.  We  further  find,  however,  that  the  record  fails  to  support  a  finding  that  Beehive  committed  anything  more  than  a  de  minimus  violation  of  either  section  203(  c)  or  201(  b)  by 
 rendering  access  bills  based  upon  the  Julian  calendar.  The  evidence  submitted  by  AT&  T  is  underwhelming.  There  is  no  allegation  (much  less  proof)  that  any  of  the  three  bills  submitted  by 
 AT&  T  into  the  record  fails  to  properly  identify  the  billing  period  based  upon  the  Gregorian  calendar.  55  Moreover,  the  AT&  T  Chart  that  purports  to  summarize  errors  discovered  on  173 
 bills  indicates  that  almost  all  of  those  bills  expressed  dates  based  upon  both  the  Julian  and  Gregorian  calendars.  56  Finally,  although  Beehive  admits  that  it  submitted  five  invoices  to  AT&  T 
 between  February  and  May  1995  that  referred  only  to  Julian  calendar  dates,  Beehive  denies  that  this  practice  continued  thereafter,  57  and  there  is  no  evidence  in  the  record  to  the  contrary.  Thus, 
 assuming,  arguendo,  that  billing  based  solely  on  the  Julian  calendar  would  violate  sections  201(  b)  and  203(  c),  we  conclude  that  any  such  violations  here  were  too  trivial  to  warrant  any 
 adverse  Commission  finding.  58 
 16.  In  sum,  we  conclude  that  AT&  T  has  met  its  burden  of  proving  that  Beehive  violated  section  203  with  respect  to  all  of  the  billing  practices  alleged,  except  the  use  of  the 
 Julian  calendar.  Therefore,  we  largely  grant  and  partially  deny  Counts  Six  and  Seven  of  AT&  T’s  Complaint  accordingly.  59  We  note  that  AT&  T  neither  requested  nor  sought  to  prove 
 damages  arising  from  the  billing  practices  alleged  in  Counts  Six  and  Seven. 
 C.  Beehive’s  Access  Rates  Violated  Section  201(  b)  by  Generating  Earnings  Above  the  Prescribed  Rate  of  Return  in  1994,  1995,  and  1996. 


 53  See  AT&  T  Initial  Brief  at  Exhibit  3,  Attachment  A. 
 54  Because  of  this  holding,  we  dismiss  as  moot  AT&  T’s  claim  in  Count  Seven  that  Beehive  violated 
 section  201(  b),  based  on  the  same  conduct.  55

 17.  AT&  T  alleges  that  Beehive’s  $.  47  per  minute  and  $.  14  per  minute  rates  for  terminating  interstate  access  services  violated  section  201(  b)  of  the  Act,  because  they  caused 
 Beehive  to  exceed  its  prescribed  rate  of  return  of  11.25%  in  1994,  1995,  and  1996.  60  AT&  T  did  very  little  to  seek  or  submit  in  this  proceeding’s  record  evidence  to  substantiate  its  allegations  of 
 overearnings.  61  AT&  T  did  eventually  request,  however,  that  we  take  official  notice  of  Beehive’s  acknowledgment  in  another  Commission  proceeding  that  Beehive’s  interstate  access  charges 
 exceeded  the  prescribed  rate  of  return  in  1994,  1995,  and  1996.  62  For  the  reasons  explained  below,  we  accede  to  AT&  T’s  request  and,  as  a  result,  conclude  that  AT&  T  has  met  its  burden  of 
 showing  that  Beehive  exceeded  the  prescribed  rate  of  return  in  1994,  1995,  and  1996. 
 18.  On  August  5,  1997,  pursuant  to  section  204(  a)  of  the  Act,  63  the  Common  Carrier  Bureau’s  Competitive  Pricing  Division  suspended  the  interstate  access  tariff  that  Beehive  had 
 belatedly  filed  on  July  22,  1997  for  the  1997-  1999  period  (“  Transmittal  No.  6”).  64  In  doing  so,  the  Suspension  Order  stated  that  Transmittal  No.  6  raised  “significant  questions  of  lawfulness” 
 about,  inter  alia,  whether  it  contained  rates  violative  of  section  201(  b)  of  the  Act.  65  On  December  2,  1997,  the  Common  Carrier  Bureau  designated  for  investigation  various  issues 
 regarding  Transmittal  No.  6  and  directed  Beehive  to  provide  to  the  Commission  detailed  information  concerning  its  costs  and  revenues  during  1994,  1995,  and  1996.  66 


 19.  On  December  15,  1997,  in  response  to  the  Designation  Order,  Beehive  submitted  to  the  Commission  its  “Direct  Case”  containing  cost  and  revenue  information  for  1994,  1995, 
 and  1996.  67  This  information  indicated  that,  for  interstate  services,  Beehive  had  earned  a

 15.18%  rate  of  return  in  1994,  a  62.60%  rate  of  return  in  1995,  and  a  67.95%  rate  of  return  in  1996,  all  well  above  the  prescribed  rate  of  return  of  11.25%.  68  Two  weeks  later,  on  December 
 29,  1997,  Beehive  filed  another  pleading  in  that  proceeding  acknowledging  the  accuracy  of  those  excessive  rates  of  return.  69 


 20.  The  Commission  has  broad  discretion  in  its  adjudicatory  proceedings  to  take  official  notice  of  factual  issues  “related  directly  to  the  agency’s  expertise  or  relate[  d]  to  certain 
 aspects  of  the  parties’  situation  of  which  the  commission  has  a  good  deal  of  prior  knowledge.”  70  The  historic  rate-  of-  return  information  submitted  by  Beehive  in  the  Commission’s  investigation 
 of  Beehive’s  Transmittal  No.  6  falls  well  within  such  discretion.  71  Consequently,  we  agree  with  AT&  T  that  we  should  take  official  notice  of  Beehive’s  acknowledgement  in  the  Commission’s 
 proceeding  investigating  Beehive’s  Transmittal  No.  6  that  Beehive  exceeded  its  prescribed  interstate  access  rate  of  return  in  1994,  1995,  and  1996. 


 21.  Beehive  proffers  several  reasons  why  we  should  refrain  from  considering  AT&  T’s  overearnings  claims  or  taking  official  notice  of  Beehive’s  prior  statements  that  Beehive 
 exceeded  its  prescribed  interstate  access  rate  of  return  in  1994,  1995,  and  1996.  72  All  of  those  reasons  lack  merit.

 22.  First,  Beehive  argues  that  the  two-  year  statute  of  limitations  in  section  415(  c)  of  the  Act  73  bars  AT&  T’s  claim  regarding  Beehive’s  $.  47  rate,  because  AT&  T  knew  or  should  have 
 known  of  the  grounds  for  the  claim  when  the  rate  took  effect  on  July  1,  1994,  more  than  two  years  before  AT&  T  filed  its  complaint  on  October  29,  1996.  74  Beehive  argues  that  section  415 
 also  bars  AT&  T’s  claim  regarding  Beehive’s  $.  14  rate,  because  AT&  T  knew  or  should  have  known  of  the  grounds  for  the  claim  when  the  rate  took  effect  on  July  1,  1995,  more  than  two 
 years  before  AT&  T  submitted  supporting  evidence  on  July  2,  1997.  75  It  is  well  established,  however,  that  the  statute  of  limitations  on  a  claim  alleging  overearnings  does  not  even  begin  to 
 run  until  the  defendant  carrier  files  with  the  Commission  final  information  indicating  that  it  did,  in  fact,  overearn  during  a  particular  period.  76  The  record  contains  no  evidence  that  Beehive  filed 
 such  information  with  the  Commission  more  than  two  years  before  AT&  T  filed  the  instant  complaint.  77  Thus,  Beehive’s  statute  of  limitations  defense  fails.  78 


 23.  Second,  Beehive  maintains  that  we  should  not  take  official  notice  of  information  submitted  in  the  Commission’s  investigation  of  Transmittal  No.  6,  because  such  submissions 
 occurred  after  a  statutory  deadline  for  resolving  AT&  T’s  claims  in  this  proceeding  had  lapsed.  79  Even  assuming,  arguendo,  the  validity  of  Beehive’s  premise,  Beehive’s  conclusion  does  not 
 follow.  It  is  well  established  that  the  expiration  of  a  statutory  deadline  for  the  Commission  to  act  does  not  divest  the  Commission  of  authority  to  continue  moving  toward  resolution  of  a 
 proceeding.  80  Accordingly,  we  have  authority  to  take  official  notice  of  information  submitted  in  the  Commission’s  investigation  of  Transmittal  No.  6,  whether  or  not  such  submissions  occurred

 after  a  statutory  deadline  for  resolving  AT&  T’s  claims  in  this  proceeding  had  lapsed.  81  Thus,  Beehive’s  statutory  deadline  defense  fails. 
 24.  Third,  Beehive  contends  that  section  207  of  the  Act  bars  AT&  T’s  claims  regarding  the  lawfulness  of  Beehive’s  rates,  because  AT&  T  previously  alleged  the  unlawfulness 
 of  Beehive’s  rates  as  a  defense  in  the  Utah  Court  Action.  82  Section  207  provides,  in  pertinent  part,  that  “[  a]  ny  person  claiming  to  be  damaged  by  any  common  carrier  .  .  .  may  either  make 
 complaint  to  the  Commission  .  .  .  or  may  bring  suit  for  the  recovery  of  the  damages  for  which  such  common  carrier  may  be  liable  .  .  .  in  any  district  court  of  the  United  States  .  .  .;  but  such 
 person  shall  not  have  the  right  to  pursue  both  such  remedies.”  83  Beehive  overlooks  the  key  facts,  however,  that  AT&  T  raised  this  defense  in  the  context  of  a  motion  to  dismiss  or  stay  the  matter 
 on  primary  jurisdiction  grounds,  84  and  that  ultimately  the  federal  court  essentially  granted  AT&  T’s  motion.  85  It  is  well  established  that  section  207  does  not  apply  in  the  context  of  a 
 primary  jurisdiction  referral.  86  Thus,  Beehive’s  section  207  defense  fails.  87 
 25.  Fourth,  Beehive  asserts  that  we  should  not  look  to  the  Commission’s  investigation  of  Transmittal  No.  6  for  any  purpose  here,  because  the  procedural  rules  governing  the 
 investigation  were  ad  hoc  and  different  from  formal  complaint  procedures;  the  investigation  included  ex  parte  presentations;  the  investigation  proceeded  on  an  unlawfully  abbreviated 
 schedule;  the  investigation  concerned  Beehive’s  1997  interstate  switching  rates,  not  its  1994-  1996  overall  access  rates;  and  the  investigation  record  contained  no  data  concerning  Beehive’s 


 81  Given  this  conclusion,  we  need  not  and  do  not  decide  whether  the  submissions  at  issue  here 
 occurred  after  a  statutory  deadline  for  resolving  AT&  T’s  claims  in  this  proceeding  had  lapsed.  82

 Branch,  Enforcement  Division,  Common  Carrier  Bureau,  FCC,  File  No.  E-  97-  04  (dated  May  6,  1997),  Attachment.  See  Beehive  Initial  Brief  at  10;  AT&  T  Reply  Brief  at  14-  15. 
 86  See,  e.  g.,  Allnet  Communication  Service,  Inc.  v.  National  Exchange  Carrier  Association,  Inc.,  965 
 F.  2d  1118,  1122  (D.  C.  Cir.  1992).  87 
 It  is  true  that  AT&  T  filed  its  complaint  here  perhaps  a  bit  prematurely,  a  few  months  before  the  federal  court  granted  AT&  T’s  primary  jurisdiction  motion.  At  this  point,  however,  long  after  the  court  has  granted 


 AT&  T’s  motion,  dismissing  AT&  T’s  complaint  on  that  basis  would  unduly  exalt  form  over  substance.  This  is  especially  true,  given  that  Beehive  has  alleged  no  prejudice  arising  from  AT&  T’s  filing  of  the  complaint  in 
 anticipation  of  the  court’s  order  granting  referral.  Indeed,  section  207  might  not  even  apply  here,  because  AT&  T  raised  the  issue  of  rate  reasonableness  in  the  context  of  a  Rule  12(  b)  motion,  not  in  the  context  of  an  affirmative 
 defense  or  counterclaim.  Nevertheless,  we  caution  future  complainants  that  the  mere  filing  of  a  primary  jurisdiction  motion  in  court  does  not  vitiate  section  207  concerns.

 costs  and  demand  in  1993.  88  All  of  these  assertions  miss  the  point.  89  None  of  these  assertions  changes  the  fact  that,  during  the  course  of  the  Commission’s  investigation  of  Transmittal  No.  6, 
 Beehive  itself  submitted  information  to  the  Commission  clearly  indicating  that  Beehive  exceeded  its  prescribed  interstate  access  rate  of  return  in  1994,  1995,  and  1996;  and  Beehive  has  shown 
 nothing  in  the  investigation  proceeding  or  in  this  proceeding  that  undermines  the  validity  of  Beehive’s  submissions.  Thus,  Beehive’s  defense  based  on  the  nature  and  content  of  the 
 Commission’s  investigation  of  Transmittal  No.  6  fails. 
 26.  Finally,  Beehive  argues  that  AT&  T  cannot  challenge  the  lawfulness  of  Beehive’s  interstate  access  rates  in  1995-  1996,  because  AT&  T  refused  during  that  time  to  first  pay  all  of 
 the  charges  based  on  those  rates.  90  Beehive’s  argument  fatally  ignores  the  fact  that  its  own  Tariff  contemplates  that  a  customer  may  withhold  payment  of  disputed  charges  pending 
 resolution  of  the  dispute.  91  Under  the  filed  rate  doctrine,  therefore,  Beehive’s  argument  fails.  92 
 27.  In  sum,  Beehive  presents  no  valid  argument  why  we  should  refrain  from  considering  AT&  T’s  overearnings  claims  and  taking  official  notice  of  information  submitted  by 
 Beehive  during  the  Commission’s  investigation  of  Transmittal  No.  6.  Consequently,  we  take  official  notice  of  the  fact  that,  according  to  Beehive’s  own  records,  Beehive  earned  interstate 
 access  revenues  above  its  prescribed  rate  of  return  in  1994,  1995,  and  1996.  Moreover,  nothing  in  the  record  refutes  this  evidence.  Thus,  AT&  T  has  met  its  burden  of  demonstrating  that 
 Beehive’s  access  rates  during  those  years  were  unjust  and  unreasonable,  in  violation  of  section  201(  b)  of  the  Act.  93

 89  We  note  that  the  D.  C.  Circuit  affirmed  the  Commission’s  order  concluding  the  investigation  of 
 Transmittal  No.  6,  which  found  that  Beehive’s  interstate  rate  of  return  for  local  switching  in  1994-  1996  was  excessive,  and  which  rejected  the  “due  process”  arguments  raised  here.  Beehive  Telephone  Company,  Inc.,  Tariff

 NECA  Tariff  F.  C.  C.  No.  5,  section  2.4.1(  D).  Given  this  result,  we  need  not  decide  whether  Beehive’s  defense  has  any  other  flaws. 


 92  See,  e.  g.,  AT&  T  v.  Central  Office  Telephone,  Inc.,  524  U.  S.  214  (1998).  Beehive  also  seems  to 
 argue  that  the  filed  rate  doctrine  precludes  AT&  T  from  challenging  the  reasonableness  of  Beehive’s  tariffed  access  rates.  Beehive  Answer  at  8,  ¶¶  50-  52;  Beehive  Initial  Brief  at  16-  17.  That  argument  is  patently  meritless.  It  is  well 


 established  that  the  Commission  has  the  authority  to  determine  the  reasonableness  of  a  tariffed  rate  in  the  context  of  a  section  208  complaint  proceeding.  See,  e.  g.,  AT&  T  Corp.  v.  Business  Telecom,  Inc.,  Memorandum  Opinion  and 
 Order,  16  FCC  Rcd  12312,  12317-  20,  ¶¶  9-  12  (2001).  93 
 We  must  assess  the  lawfulness  of  Beehive’s  rates  and  earnings  in  1994  in  combination  with  Beehive’s  rates  and  earnings  in  1993.  See  47  C.  F.  R.  §§  65.600(  b),  65.702(  b).  See  also  Virgin  Islands  Telephone 


 Corp.  v.  FCC,  989  F.  2d  1231  (D.  C.  Cir.  1993).  Here,  we  conclude  that  Beehive’s  rates  in  1994  were  unlawful  based,  in  part,  on  an  assumption  that  Beehive  did  not  materially  underearn  in  1993.  This  assumption  is  reasonable, 
14

 28.  AT&  T  has  not  met  its  burden,  however,  of  demonstrating  the  extent  to  which  it  was  damaged  by  Beehive’s  unlawful  rates.  Although  the  record  contains  some  pertinent 
 information,  the  record  does  not  contain  everything  needed  to  make  a  precise  damage  calculation.  Moreover,  nowhere  in  the  record  does  AT&  T  explain  exactly  how  much  it  believes 
 we  should  award  due  to  these  violations  or  precisely  how  it  would  calculate  such  an  amount  based  on  record  evidence.  Thus,  we  grant  AT&  T’s  overearnings  claims  in  Counts  Four  and  Five 
 of  the  Complaint  as  to  liability,  but  deny  those  claims  as  to  damages.  Again,  however,  we  express  no  opinion  as  to  whether  AT&  T  may  pursue  a  damages  claim  in  the  Utah  Court  Action 
 or  in  the  parties’  arbitration.  94 
 D.  AT&  T  Has  Not  Demonstrated  on  This  Record  that  the  Access  Revenue-  Sharing  Arrangement  Between  Beehive  and  Joy  Violated  Section  201(  b)  or  202(  a)  of  the  Act. 


 29.  AT&  T  alleges  in  its  Complaint  that  the  access  revenue-  sharing  arrangement  between  Beehive  and  Joy  breached  Beehive’s  common  carrier  duties,  in  violation  of  section 
 201(  b)  of  the  Act,  and  constituted  unreasonable  discrimination,  in  violation  of  section  202(  a)  of  the  Act.  95  AT&  T’s  allegations  and  arguments  are  identical  to  those  raised  and  denied  in  AT&  T 
 v.  Jefferson  96  and  AT&  T  v.  Frontier.  97  Thus,  for  the  reasons  explained  in  those  orders,  we  conclude  that  AT&  T  has  failed  on  this  record  to  meet  its  burden  of  demonstrating  that  Beehive 
 violated  either  section  201(  b)  or  section  202(  a)  of  the  Act.  98  Therefore,  we  deny  Counts  One, 
 because  Beehive  knew  that  AT&  T  was  urging  us  to  consider  information  regarding  Beehive’s  rates  and  earnings  in  1994,  yet  offered  no  evidence  (such  as  monitoring  reports)  indicating  that  any  overearnings  in  1994  had  been  offset 
 by  underearnings  in  1993.  This  assumption  is  especially  appropriate  because  (i)  Beehive  participated  in  the  NECA  tariff  during  1993  and  half  of  1994,  and  (ii)  the  record  contains  some  evidence  that  Beehive  actually  overearned  in 
 the  1993-  94  period.  See  AT&  T  Reply  Brief  at  Exhibit  H  (a  Beehive  preliminary  report  indicating  that  its  interstate  rate  of  return  during  1993-  94  would  be  16.93%).  Beehive  moves  us  to  strike  this  (and  other)  evidence  as  untimely 
 filed,  AT&  T  Corp.  v.  Beehive  Telephone  Co.,  Inc.  and  Beehive  Telephone  Inc.  Nevada,  Letter  from  Russell  D.  Lukas,  Counsel  for  Beehive  Telephone  Co.,  to  Greg  Lipscomb,  Attorney,  Enforcement  Division,  Common  Carrier 
 Bureau,  FCC,  File  No.  E-  97-  04  (dated  Jul.  16,  1997),  but  we  deny  that  motion,  because  Beehive  had  ample  opportunity  in  its  briefs  filed  in  1998  to  respond  to  this  (and  other)  evidence,  which  AT&  T  filed  in  1997.

 Two,  and  Three  of  AT&  T’s  Complaint.  99 
 E.  Beehive’s  Complaint  Lacks  Merit. 
 30.  In  its  Complaint,  Beehive  alleges  that,  if  (and  only  if)  the  Commission  were  to  find  in  this  consolidated  proceeding  that  its  access  revenue-  sharing  arrangement  with  Joy  was 
 unlawful,  then  the  Commission  must  also  find  that  AT&  T’s  use  of  so-  called  Terminating  Switched  Access  Arrangements  (“  TSAAs”)  with  AT&  T’s  end  user  customers  is  unlawful.  100 
 Elsewhere  in  this  Order,  we  find  that,  based  on  the  record  in  this  proceeding,  AT&  T  has  failed  to  meet  its  burden  of  proving  that  Beehive’s  access  revenue-  sharing  arrangement  with  Joy  was 
 unlawful.  101  Therefore,  the  condition  precedent  pled  by  Beehive  has  not  been  satisfied,  and  Beehive’s  claims  must  fail.  102  Accordingly,  we  dismiss  the  First  and  Second  Causes  of  Action  of 
 Beehive’s  Complaint.  103

 99  Moreover,  we  decline  to  reach  two  issues  that  AT&  T  raised  for  the  first  time  in  its  briefs,  because 
 the  tardy  raising  of  these  issues  renders  the  record  insufficient  to  permit  a  reasoned  decision.  See,  e.  g.,  AT&  T  v.  Jefferson,  16  FCC  Rcd  at  16133  n.  18;  Consumer.  Net  v.  AT&  T  Corp.,  Order,  15  FCC  Rcd  281,  300,  ¶  40  n.  93 


 (1999)  (declining  to  consider  an  argument  raised  for  the  first  time  in  the  briefs).  Cf.,  Building  Owners  and  Managers  Association  International  v.  FCC,  254  F.  3d  89,  100  n.  14  (D.  C.  Cir.  2001)  (declining  to  address  an  issue 
 raised  cursorily  in  the  brief).  Specifically,  in  its  briefs,  AT&  T  maintains  for  the  first  time  that  the  revenue-  sharing  arrangement  between  Beehive  and  Joy  also  violated  section  201(  b)  by  “evading  the  requirements”  of  TDDRA. 
 AT&  T  Initial  Brief  at  14-  16;  AT&  T  Reply  Brief  at  9-  12.  In  addition,  in  its  briefs,  AT&  T  argues  for  the  first  time  that  Beehive’s  practice  of  billing  AT&  T  for  traffic  terminated  to  Joy  violated  the  Commission’s  tariff  regulations.

 See  section  III.  D,  supra.  102 
 Beehive  filed  a  petition  for  reconsideration  of  a  staff  discovery  ruling  regarding  information  about  AT&  T’s  TSAAs.  Beehive  Telephone  Co.,  Inc.  and  Beehive  Telephone  Inc.  Nevada  v.  AT&  T  Corp.,  Petition  For 


 Reconsideration,  File  No.  E-  97-  14  (filed  Mar.  26,  1998);  AT&  T  Corp.  v.  Beehive  Telephone  Co.,  Inc.  and  Beehive  Telephone  Inc.  Nevada,  and  Beehive  Telephone  Co.,  Inc.  and  Beehive  Telephone  Inc.  Nevada  v.  AT&  T  Corp.,  Letter 
 from  Deena  M.  Shetler,  Attorney,  Enforcement  Division,  Common  Carrier  Bureau,  FCC,  to  Peter  H.  Jacoby,  Counsel  for  AT&  T  Corp.,  and  Russell  D.  Lukas,  Counsel  for  Beehive  Telephone  Co.,  File  Nos.  E-  97-  04,  E-  97-  14 
 (dated  Mar.  16,  1998);  AT&  T  Corp.  v.  Beehive  Telephone  Co.,  Inc.  and  Beehive  Telephone  Inc.  Nevada,  and  Beehive  Telephone  Co.,  Inc.  and  Beehive  Telephone  Inc.  Nevada  v.  AT&  T  Corp.,  Letter  from  Deena  M.  Shetler, 
 Attorney,  Enforcement  Division,  Common  Carrier  Bureau,  FCC,  to  Peter  H.  Jacoby,  Counsel  for  AT&  T  Corp.,  and  Russell  D.  Lukas,  Counsel  for  Beehive  Telephone  Co.,  File  Nos.  E-  97-  04,  E-  97-  14  (dated  Mar.  24,  1998).  As  this 
 Order  makes  clear,  such  information  was  not  germane  to  our  resolution  of  any  of  the  claims  by  either  party.  Thus,  we  dismiss  Beehive’s  petition  as  moot. 
 103  Because  we  dismiss  these  claims  on  other  grounds,  we  need  not  reach  the  arguably  antecedent 
 question  whether  these  claims  should  be  dismissed  due  to  their  conditional  nature.

 different  pending  proceeding  that  a  similar  access  revenue-  sharing  arrangement  between  another  carrier  (Total  Telecommunications  Services,  Inc.)  and  an  information  provider  was  an  unlawful 
 attempt  to  evade  the  requirements  TDDRA,  then  the  Commission  must  also  find  that  AT&  T’s  use  of  TSAAs  constituted  an  unlawful  evasion  of  TDDRA,  as  well.  104  In  Total 
 Telecommunications  Services,  Inc.,  and  Atlas  Telephone  Company,  Inc.  v.  AT&  T  Corp.,  we  rejected  this  TDDRA  claim  as  moot,  105  and  AT&  T  did  not  raise  a  TDDRA  claim  in  its 
 Complaint  here.  Therefore,  again,  the  condition  precedent  pled  by  Beehive  has  not  been  satisfied,  so  Beehive’s  claim  must  fail.  Accordingly,  we  dismiss  the  Fifth  Cause  of  Action  of 
 Beehive’s  Complaint.  106 
 32.  Finally,  Beehive  alleges  that  AT&  T  concealed  material  facts  in  this  complaint  proceeding,  in  violation  of  sections  1.17  and  1.729(  b)  of  the  Commission’s  rules.  107  These  facts 
 dealt  with  the  existence  and  details  of  certain  of  AT&  T’s  TSAAs.  Based  on  our  review  of  the  entire  record  in  this  proceeding,  we  conclude  that  Beehive  has  failed  to  meet  its  burden  of 
 proving  that  AT&  T  willfully  withheld  material  information.  Accordingly,  we  deny  the  Third  and  Fourth  Causes  of  Action  of  Beehive’s  Complaint.  108 


 IV.  ORDERING  CLAUSES 
 33.  ACCORDINGLY,  IT  IS  ORDERED,  pursuant  to  sections  1,  4(  i),  4(  j),  201(  b),  202(  a),  203(  c),  and  208  of  the  Communications  Act  of  1934,  as  amended,  47  U.  S.  C.  §§  151,  154(  i), 
 154(  j),  201(  b),  202(  a),  203(  c),  and  208,  that  the  above-  captioned  complaint  filed  by  AT&  T  IS  GRANTED  IN  PART  AND  DISMISSED  OR  DENIED  IN  PART  to  the  extent  described  herein. 


 34.  IT  IS  FURTHER  ORDERED,  pursuant  to  sections  1,  4(  i),  4(  j),  201(  b),  202(  a),  203(  c),  and  208  of  the  Communications  Act  of  1934,  as  amended,  47  U.  S.  C.  §§  151,  154(  i),  154(  j),

 Case  Nos.  01-  1188,  01-  1201  (D.  C.  Cir.,  filed  Apr.  20,  2001).  106 
 Again,  because  we  dismiss  this  claim  on  other  grounds,  we  need  not  reach  the  arguably  antecedent  question  whether  this  claim  should  be  dismissed  due  to  its  conditional  nature. 


 107  Beehive  Complaint  at  2,  10-  11,  ¶¶  5,  41-  53.  See  Beehive  Supplemental  Brief  at  14-  15,  30-  32; 
 Beehive  Supplemental  Reply  Brief  at  6-  8,  23-  27.  108 
 Because  we  deny  these  claims  on  other  grounds,  we  need  not  reach  the  arguably  antecedent  question  whether  alleged  violations  of  sections  1.17  and  1.729(  b)  of  our  rules  —  which  govern  carriers’  dealings 


 with  the  Commission,  not  their  provision  of  telecommunication  services  —  state  a  claim  under  section  208  of  the  Act.  In  addition,  because  we  deny  Beehive’s  Complaint  in  its  entirety,  we  also  dismiss  as  moot  AT&  T’s  Motion  to 
 Dismiss  Beehive’s  Complaint.  See  AT&  T  Corp.  v.  Beehive  Telephone  Co.,  Inc.  and  Beehive  Telephone  Inc.  Nevada,  Motion  to  Dismiss,  File  No.  E-  97-  14  (filed  May  20,  1997).

 35.  IT  IS  FURTHER  ORDERED,  pursuant  to  sections  1,  4(  i),  4(  j),  201(  b),  202(  a),  203(  c),  and  208  of  the  Communications  Act  of  1934,  as  amended,  47  U.  S.  C.  §§  151,  154(  i),  154(  j), 
 201(  b),  202(  a),  203(  c),  and  208,  that  AT&  T’s  May  20,  1997  Motion  to  Dismiss,  Beehive’s  July  16,  1997  Motion  to  Strike,  and  Beehive’s  March  16,  1998  Petition  for  Reconsideration  are 
 DISMISSED  as  moot.
