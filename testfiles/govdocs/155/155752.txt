 MEMORANDUM  OPINION  AND  ORDER 
 Adopted:  December  1,  1998  Released:  December  1,  1998 
 By  the  Commission:  Commissioner  Furchtgott-  Roth  issuing  a  statement. 
 I.  INTRODUCTION 
 A.  In  this  Memorandum  Opinion  and  Order,  we  conclude  our  investigation  of  Transmittal  No.  11  filed  on  June  16,  1998  by  Beehive  Telephone  Company,  Inc.  and  Beehive  Telephone,  Inc.  of 
 Nevada  (collectively  "Beehive").  Beehive  is  a  small  company,  with  under  one  thousand  access  lines.  We  find  that  Beehive  has  failed  to  meet  its  burden  of  proof  under  Section  204(  a)(  1)  of  the  Communications 
 Act  of  1934,  as  amended  (Act),  47  U.  S.  C.  §  204(  a)(  1),  to  justify  its  proposed  tandem  switched  transport  facility,  tandem  switched  transport  termination,  and  transport  interconnection  charge  (TIC)  rates.  We 
 further  find  for  the  reasons  discussed  below  that  we  are  unable  to  rely  on  supporting  information  submitted  by  Beehive  for  the  purpose  of  prescribing  rates.  We,  therefore,  prescribe  rates  for  these 
 services  based  on  NECA's  rates  for  these  services.  We  direct  Beehive  to  refund  to  its  customers,  with  interest,  the  difference  between  NECA's  rates  and  the  rates  filed  by  Beehive  in  June,  1998.  Based  on  the 
 inconsistent  and  irregular  accounting  practices  we  discovered  in  Beehive's  cost  support  data,  we  further  direct  the  Common  Carrier  Bureau  (Bureau)  to  institute  an  investigation  pursuant  to  Section  205  of  the 
 Act  for  purposes  of  determining  whether  Beehive  is  in  violation  of  any  part  of  the  Act  based  upon  its  Part  32  accounting  methodologies  and  entries,  Part  64  cost  allocation  methodologies,  and  separations 
 methodologies.  1 
 II.  BACKGROUND 
 B.  Prior  to  1994,  Beehive  charged  interstate  local  switching  and  transport  rates  filed  by  the  National  Exchange  Carrier  Association  (NECA)  on  behalf  of  generally  smaller  incumbent  local  exchange 
 carriers  (LECs)  that  participate  in  NECA's  traffic-  sensitive  access  tariff.  In  1994,  Beehive  established  its

 own  interstate  access  rates  pursuant  to  Section  61.39  of  the  Commission's  rules,  2  which  permits  a  LEC  that  qualifies  as  a  small  telephone  company  to  file  its  own  tariff  or  traffic  sensitive  interstate  access 
 charges  under  simpler  rules  than  those  that  apply  to  larger  carriers.  3  This  methodology  generally  permits  qualifying  LECs  to  base  their  rates  for  the  next  two  access  tariff  years  on  their  actual  costs  and  demand 
 during  the  previous  two  calendar  years. 
 C.  On  July  22,  1997,  Beehive  filed  Transmittal  No.  6,  which  proposed  the  rates,  terms,  and  conditions  under  which  Beehive  would  offer  interstate  access  service  for  the  1997-  1999  access  years.  4 
 The  Common  Carrier  Bureau  suspended  Beehive's  tariff  filing  on  August  5,  1997,  concluding  that  it  raised  significant  questions  of  lawfulness,  including  whether  the  proposed  rates  were  unreasonably 
 discriminatory  in  violation  of  Section  202(  a)  of  the  Act;  whether  the  proposed  rates  were  unjust  and  unreasonable  in  violation  of  Section  201(  b)  of  the  Act;  and  whether  Beehive  had  shown  that  its  proposed 
 traffic  sensitive  switched  access  rates  were  justified  under  the  existing  interstate  access  charge  rules.  5 
 D.  On  January  6,  1998,  we  released  the  Beehive  Tariff  Investigation  Order,  Transmittal  No.  6,  6  concluding  our  investigation  of  the  rates  filed  by  Beehive  in  its  1997  annual  access  tariff.  We  found 
 that  Beehive  had  failed  to  provide  an  adequate  explanation  for  the  sharp  increases  in  its  operating  costs  in  1995  and  1996  and  that  its  premium  and  nonpremium  local  switching  rates  were  unjust  and 
 unreasonable.  7  In  that  order,  we  disallowed  Beehive's  operating  expenses  in  excess  of  25  percent  of  its  total  plant  in  service  (TPIS)  and  prescribed  rates  for  Beehive's  premium  and  non-  premium  local  switching 
 services.  8  We  calculated  the  average  ratio  of  operating  expenses  to  total  plant  in  service  among  companies  with  a  comparable  number  of  access  lines  to  Beehive  in  1995  or  1996  using  data  filed  with 
 NECA.  9  We  found  that  the  average  total  operating  expense  to  total  plant  in  service  ratio  among  smaller  LECs  (of  which  NECA  is  largely  comprised)  with  a  comparable  number  of  access  lines  as  Beehive  was

 21.55  percent.  To  account  for  the  possibility  that  Beehive  is  a  high  cost  carrier,  we  used  an  expense  to  total  plant  in  service  ratio  of  25  percent.  10  We  also  directed  Beehive  to  refund  the  difference  between  the 
 actual  local  switching  revenues  that  it  obtained  between  August  6,  1997  and  December  31,  1997  and  the  local  switching  revenues  that  it  would  have  obtained  during  this  period  based  on  the  rates  prescribed  by 
 the  Commission.  Beehive  filed  a  petition  for  reconsideration  of  the  Beehive  Tariff  Investigation  Order  on  February  5,  1998  seeking  reconsideration  of  the  rate  prescriptions  and  the  refund  requirements.  On  May 
 6,  1998,  we  released  the  Beehive  Reconsideration  Order,  which  generally  denied  Beehive's  petition  in  part  but  found  that  we  should  have  used  Beehive's  total  1995/  1996  interstate  premium  and  non-  premium  local 
 switching  access  minutes.  11 
 E.  On  December  17,  1997,  Beehive  filed  Transmittal  No.  8,  which  proposed  to  revise  its  interstate  access  service  rates  in  accordance  with  the  Commission's  Access  Charge  Reform  Order.  12 
 Beehive's  Transmittal  No.  8  proposed  per  minute  switching  rates  of  $0.028252  for  premium  local  switching  and  $0.01815  for  non-  premium  local  switching.  13  Beehive  also  proposed  to  reduce  its  local 
 transport  facility  rates  by  approximately  20  percent,  and  to  raise  its  local  transport  termination  rates  by  approximately  50  percent.  On  December  30,  1997,  the  Bureau  suspended  Beehive's  Transmittal  No.  8  for 
 one  day  and  initiated  an  investigation  into  the  lawfulness  of  Beehive's  tariff  filing.  14 
 F.  On  March  13,  1998,  the  Bureau  released  the  Beehive  Designation  Order,  which  designated  for  investigation  whether  Beehive's  premium  and  non-  premium  local  transport  facility,  local 
 transport  termination,  and  local  switching  rates  filed  in  Transmittal  No.  8  were  just  and  reasonable.  The  Bureau  directed  Beehive  to  file  additional  supporting  documentation  for  its  actual  demand  and  costs 
 during  recent  years  and  designated  many  of  the  same  issues  that  were  the  subject  of  the  investigation  of  Beehive's  1997  annual  access  tariff.  15  The  Bureau  also  directed  Beehive  to  provide  detailed  cost  and 
 accounting  data  for  calendar  years  1994,  1995,  and  1996.  16

 G.  On  June  1,  1998,  the  Commission  released  a  Memorandum  Opinion  and  Order  concluding  its  investigation  of  Beehive's  Transmittal  No.  8.  17  In  that  Order,  we  found  that  Beehive  failed 
 to  meet  its  burden  of  proof  under  Section  204(  a)(  1)  of  the  Act,  and  further  found  that  we  could  not  rely  on  Beehive's  support  documentation  for  the  purpose  of  prescribing  rates.  18  We  therefore  prescribed  rates  for 
 the  services  set  forth  in  Beehive's  Transmittal  No.  8  based  on  the  industry  averages  for  comparably  sized  smaller  LECs.  On  September  28,  1998,  the  Commission  summarily  rejected  Beehive's  petition  for 
 reconsideration  of  Beehive  Tariff  Investigation  Order,  Transmittal  No.  8.  19  H.  On  June  16,  1998,  Beehive  filed  Transmittal  No.  11  proposing  to  revise  its  FCC  Tariff 
 No.  1  to  establish  rates  for  tandem  switched  transport  facility,  tandem  switched  transport  termination,  and  transport  interconnection  (TIC)  pursuant  to  the  Commission's  Access  Charge  Reform  Order.  Beehive 
 also  proposed  increasing  premium  and  non-  premium  local  switching  rates  above  prescribed  levels.  Beehive  included  cost  and  investment  data  for  calendar  years  1996  and  1997  in  support  of  its  filing.  On 
 June  30,  1998,  the  Bureau  released  the  Beehive  Suspension  Order  rejecting  Beehive's  proposed  local  switching  rates  and  suspending  that  portion  of  the  tariff  that  proposed  tandem  switched  transport  rates 
 pursuant  to  the  Access  Charge  Reform  Order.  20  On  October  7,  1998,  the  Bureau  released  the  Beehive  Designation  Order,  Transmittal  No.  11  designating  for  investigation  Beehive's  proposed  rates  for  tandem 
 switched  transport  facility,  tandem  switched  transport  termination,  and  TIC.  21  The  Order  required  Beehive  to  justify  its  rates.  The  Order  also  required  Beehive  to  comply  with  our  regulations  as  set  forth 
 in  §  61.39(  a)  by  providing  explanations  to  apparent  inconsistencies  in  Transmittal  No.  11.  22  As  examples  of  such  inconsistencies,  Beehive  was  required  to  explain:  (1)  why  it  moved  substantial  amounts  of  its 
 expenses  from  Utah  to  Nevada  and  from  corporate  operations  and  plant  specific  accounting  categories  to  customer  operations  expense  accounts;  and  (2)  why  it  reported  an  increase  of  over  26  percent  in  net  plant 
 from  Transmittal  No.  8  to  Transmittal  No.  11.  Beehive  filed  its  Direct  Case  (Beehive  Direct  Case)  on  October  23,  1998.  AT&  T  filed  an  opposition  (AT&  T  Opposition)  to  Beehive's  Direct  Case  on  October 
 30,  1998.  On  November  6,  1998,  Beehive  filed  a  Rebuttal  (Beehive  Rebuttal).

 A.  Calculation  of  Proposed  Tandem  Switched  Transport  Rates  and  the  TIC  Rate 
 I.  Beehive  states  that  it  calculated  its  tandem  switched  transport  facility  rates,  tandem  switched  transport  termination  rates,  and  TIC  rates  on  the  basis  of  historical  data  for  the  years  1996  and 
 1997.  23  For  each  rate  element  under  the  old  transport  structure  (premium  and  non-  premium  local  transport  facility  and  local  transport  termination),  Beehive  contends  it  multiplied  its  access  minutes  of  use 
 by  NECA's  tariffed  rate  to  determine  "an  extended  price."  This  sum  was,  according  to  Beehive,  divided  into  Beehive's  transport  revenue  requirement.  Beehive  multiplied  the  ratio  from  this  calculation  by 
 NECA's  rates  for  the  new  transport  restructure  elements.  This  produced  Beehive's  rates  for  those  elements.  24 


 J.  AT&  T  contends  that  Beehive  failed  to  meet  its  burden  of  proof  under  Section  204(  a)(  1)  of  the  Communications  Act  to  show  that  its  proposed  rates  are  just  and  reasonable.  The  Commission, 
 argues  AT&  T,  should  either  prescribe  rates  as  in  Transmittal  Nos.  6  and  8,  or  allow  a  partial  authorization  of  Beehive's  proposed  rates.  25 


 K.  Beehive  contends  that  its  rates  are  lawful  and  reasonable.  26  If,  however,  we  decide  to  prescribe  Beehive's  rates,  Beehive  argues  that  we  must  make  available  to  it  the  underlying  data  and 
 calculations  of  the  methodology  so  that  Beehive  can  comment. 
 B.  Increase  of  Interstate  Net  Plant  for  Beehive  Nevada  in  1996 
 L.  Beehive  admits  that  it  reported  an  increase  in  interstate  net  plant  from  Transmittal  No.  8  to  Transmittal  No.  11  of  over  26  percent.  27  Beehive  contends  that  this  increase  was  the  result  of  including 
 the  weighted  dial  equipment  minutes  (DEM)  allocator,  rather  than  the  measured  or  unweighted  DEM  allocator  in  the  development  of  the  switching  revenue  requirement.  28  Beehive  states  that  it  has  revised  its 
 rates  using  an  unweighted  DEM  allocator,  and  set  forth  its  revised  rates  in  its  Direct  Case.  29 
 M.  AT&  T  contends  that  Beehive's  cost  support  data  does  not  support  the  position  that  the  use  of  a  weighted  DEM  allocator  could  account  for  Beehive's  reported  26  percent  increase  in  interstate  net

 plant.  30  AT&  T  compared  Beehive's  original  Transmittal  No.  11  cost  support  data  with  revised  cost  support  data  filed  by  Beehive,  and  argues  that  the  data  supports  less  than  a  3  percent  increase.  Therefore, 
 states  AT&  T,  Beehive  has  not  adequately  explained  the  26  percent  increase  in  interstate  net  plant. 
 N.  Beehive  states  in  its  Rebuttal  that  AT&  T  wrongly  assumed  that  the  entire  26  percent  increase  in  interstate  net  plant  was  associated  with  the  incorrect  use  of  the  weighted  DEM  allocator.  31 
 Beehive  argues  that  the  majority  of  the  increase  is  attributable  to  additional  plant  being  placed  in  service.  32 


 C.  Movement  of  Expenses  Between  States  and  Accounts 
 O.  In  its  Direct  Case,  Beehive  argues  that  its  Transmittal  No.  11  does  not  have  "the  problems  the  Commission  discovered  in  the  Transmittal  No.  8  documentation."  33  It  contends  that  the  Commission 
 erred  when  it  tentatively  concluded  that  Beehive  merely  moved  substantial  expenses  from  Utah  to  Nevada  and  between  different  expense  accounts.  34  The  only  substantial  movement  between  accounts  Beehive 
 admits  to  was  a  reclassification  of  $1,008,000  that  it  paid  to  JEI  Enterprises,  Inc.  (JEI)  in  1996  under  a  switching  equipment  lease.  This  reclassification  was  done  by  Beehive's  auditor  in  concurrence  with  the 
 investigation  of  Beehive's  Transmittal  No.  8.  35  Beehive  states  that  the  auditor  examined  the  evidence  supporting  Beehive's  classification  of  the  1996  expense  as  plant  specific  and  corporate  operating 
 expenses,  and  reclassified  it  to  Account  6610  (Marketing).  36  Beehive  argues  that  the  1996  cost  data  for  Transmittal  No.  8  was  based  upon  its  pre-  audit  accounting  records,  and  that  subsequent  adjustments 
 "created  the  appearance"  that  it  was  transferring  expenses  between  Beehive  Utah  and  Beehive  Nevada.  37  Beehive  contends  that  the  rates  it  filed  with  Transmittal  No.  11  are  based  on  costs  that  are  properly 
 recorded  in  accordance  with  Part  32.  It  contends  that  changes  made  to  the  1996  accounting  data  to  comply  with  Part  32  cannot  be  cited  to  as  a  cause  for  rejecting  the  cost  support  data  for  Transmittal  No.

 35  Beehive  Direct  Case  at  21.  As  noted  in  the  Beehive  Designation  Order,  Transmittal  No.  11,  the  auditor's 
 statement  only  address  the  representativeness  of  the  balance  sheet  and  income  statement,  and  does  not  address  the  validity  of  the  cost  support  data  or  rate  development  material.  Id.  at  ¶  10.

 P.  Beehive  contends  that  differences  in  reported  1996  operating  expenses  between  Transmittal  Nos.  8  and  11  show  only  that  Beehive  Utah's  reported  1996  operating  expenses  decreased  by 
 $173,409,  while  Beehive  Nevada's  increased  $40,969.  Beehive  contends  that  these  differences  are  not  significant.  38 


 Q.  AT&  T  argues  that  reclassification  is  not  relevant,  because  Beehive  has  not  justified  the  inclusion  of  these  expenses  in  any  account.  39  AT&  T  contends  that  Beehive  ignored  a  Commission 
 finding  that  the  "lease  agreement"  between  JEI  and  Beehive  had  "few  of  the  normal  terms  and  conditions  of  an  operating  lease,"  and  that  Beehive  had  "not  provided  any  explanation  for  its  relationship  with  JEI 
 that  would  rebut  concerns  raised  by  its  accounting  treatment  of  JEI-  related  costs."  40  AT&  T  further  argues  that  Beehive  does  not  explain  nor  justify  the  decrease  in  Beehive  Utah's  1996  operating  expenses  in  the 
 amount  of  $173,409  or  Beehive  Nevada's  1996  increase  in  operating  expenses  of  $40,969.  41 
 R.  In  its  Rebuttal,  Beehive  argues  that  it  fully  addressed  the  Bureau's  inquiries  regarding  changes  in  Beehive's  reported  expenses  and  accounts  between  Transmittal  No.  8  and  Transmittal  No.  11.  42 
 However,  to  "further  clarify"  its  account  adjustments,  Beehive  filed  with  its  Rebuttal  an  attachment  allegedly  reconciling  the  adjustments  made  between  Transmittal  No.  8  and  Transmittal  No.  11.  Further, 
 Beehive  contends  that,  contrary  to  AT&  T's  allegation,  it  did  not  ignore  our  findings  with  respect  to  the  lease  of  switching  equipment  from  JEI.  Beehive  argues  that:  (1)  it  did  address  the  JEI  issue  in  its  Direct 
 Case  in  detail;  (2)  reclassification  of  the  JEI  expenses  were  prompted  by  Commission  inquiries  with  respect  to  the  JEI  lease;  and  (3)  the  Commission  has  never  ruled  that  the  JEI  expenses  were  not  fully 
 recoverable  if  they  were  recorded  in  the  appropriate  expense  account.  43 
 IV.  DISCUSSION 
 S.  Beehive  has  failed  to  meet  its  burden  of  proof  under  Section  204(  a)(  1)  of  the  Act  and  does  not  justify  its  proposed  tandem  switched  transport  facility,  tandem  switched  transport  termination, 
 and  TIC  rates.  Further,  we  are  unable  to  rely  on  supporting  information  submitted  by  Beehive  for  the  purpose  of  prescribing  rates  and,  therefore,  prescribe  rates  for  Beehive  based  on  industry  averages  that 
 pertain  to  small  LECs  like  Beehive,  namely  NECA's  effective  rates  for  these  services.  44

 T.  Beehive's  supporting  cost  evidence  fails  to  justify  the  proposed  rates.  The  filing  of  data  without  any  explanation  of  how  the  rates  at  issue  were  calculated  is  of  limited  use  to  the  staff  or  the 
 Commission  and  does  not  permit  the  staff  to  properly  evaluate  whether  the  proposed  tandem  switched  rates  are  just  and  reasonable.  For  example,  under  Beehive  Transmittal  No.  8,  $1.008  million  was 
 recorded  as  lease  expense  to  JEI  under  the  plant  specific  operations  and  corporate  operations  expense  categories  for  Beehive  Utah.  Under  Beehive  Transmittal  No.  11,  the  approximate  $1  million  has  been 
 shifted  to  marketing  expense  with  the  explanation  that  this  equipment  is  leased  to  "stimulate  traffic  to  terminate  on  its  system."  45  Beehive's  auditor  apparently  determined  that  the  equipment  leased  from  JEI 
 was  not  used  by  Beehive  as  telecommunications  plant,  and  therefore  reclassified  it  as  a  marketing  expense.  In  this  particular  case,  we  find  that  Beehive's  lease  of  equipment  that  is  used,  not  to  provide 
 service  to  access  customers,  but  to  do  something  else  that  causes  IXC's  customers  to  make  interexchange  calls,  thereby  "stimulating  traffic"  to  terminate  on  Beehive's  system,  is  not  an  allowable  marketing 
 expense  and  may  not  be  included  in  the  rates  that  IXCs  must  pay  to  Beehive  in  order  to  terminate  their  customers'  calls  to  numbers  served  by  Beehive. 


 U.  Beehive  explains  its  alleged  increase  in  interstate  net  plant  for  Beehive  Nevada  as  an  error  in  its  jurisdictional  separations  procedures,  46  and  states  that  it  corrected  its  error  in  recalculated 
 rates.  47  Part  36  specifies  that  tandem  switching  equipment  costs  that  cannot  be  directly  assigned  to  either  the  state  or  interstate  jurisdiction  are  to  be  allocated  between  the  jurisdictions  based  on  relative  minutes  of 
 use.  48  Beehive  is  required  to  use  relative  minutes  of  use  rather  than  DEM  to  allocate  joint  investment.  Beehive  therefore  improperly  calculated  its  investment  costs  resulting  in  a  shift  of  investment  costs  from 
 the  state  to  the  interstate  jurisdiction.  This  means  that  the  investment  in  Beehive's  cost  data  is  overstated  resulting  in  an  overstated  return  component  in  its  revenue  requirement.  Since  related  expenses  normally 
 "track"  the  investment,  there  is  a  strong  possibility  that  switch-  related  interstate  expenses  are  also  overstated.  Beehive  provides  revised  rates  but  fails  to  show  how  the  costs  were  used  in  calculating  its 
 revised  rates.  Once  again,  this  is  further  evidence  of  what  appears  to  be  Beehive's  ongoing  practice  of  failing  to  explain  its  justifications  for  use  of  various  data  in  the  development  of  its  access  rates.  49 


 45  Beehive  Direct  Case  at  21-  22. 
 46  Beehive  explains  that  it  applied  a  weighted  DEM  allocation  factor  rather  than  a  measured,  or  unweighted, 
 DEM  allocation  factor.

 48  47  C.  F.  R.  §36.124. 
 49  In  addition,  regarding  the  shifting  of  expense  between  companies,  Beehive  attempts  to  explain  that  cost  shifts 
 between  companies  somehow  result  from  allocations  of  joint  costs,  but  its  explanation  is  vague  and  unsupported  by  any  facts.  Beehive  either  failed  to  research  the  cause  of  the  difference  and  is  unaware  of  the  specific  causes,  or  is  unwilling 


 to  reveal  the  exact  nature  of  the  differences  to  the  Commission.  This  provides  additional  evidence  of  Beehive's  inconsistent  and  irregular  accounting  and  cost  allocation  practices.

 V.  We  find  that  Beehive's  cost  support  data  are  unreliable,  do  not  support  its  proposed  rates,  and  cannot  be  used  as  a  basis  to  prescribe  rates  for  its  tandem  switched  transport  facility,  tandem  switched 
 transport  termination,  and  TIC  charges.  Despite  our  admonitions  and  findings  in  our  two  recent  decisions  concluding  the  investigations  of  Beehive's  proposed  interstate  access  charges,  50  Beehive  has  once  again 
 failed  to  provide  the  necessary  data  and  explanations  to  support  a  proposed  set  of  access  charges.  The  data  submitted  by  Beehive  in  its  tariff  filing  are  often  unexplained  and  confusing.  For  example,  Beehive 
 provides  no  indication  of  what  historical  demand  for  tandem  switch  related  charges  was  used  in  calculating  its  proposed  tandem  switch  related  rates.  Other  cost  support  data  submitted  by  Beehive  are 
 similarly  deficient.  We  therefore  require  Beehive  to  use  the  premium  access  rates  set  forth  by  NECA  in  its  Tariff  F.  C.  C.  No.  5  (effective  July  1,  1998)  for  its  tandem  switched  transport  facility,  tandem  switched 
 transport  termination,  and  TIC  charges,  until  Beehive's  next  biennial  access  filing.  51  Beehive  must  refund  the  difference  between  its  filed  rates  and  the  NECA  rates. 


 W.  We  also  direct  the  Bureau  to  institute  within  90  days  after  the  release  of  this  Memorandum  Opinion  and  Order  an  investigation  pursuant  to  Section  205  and  other  appropriate 
 provisions  of  the  Act  for  purposes  of  determining  whether  Beehive  is  in  violation  of  any  part  of  the  Act  based  upon  its:  (1)  Part  32  accounting  methodologies  and  entries;  (2)  Part  64  cost  allocation 
 methodologies;  and  (3)  separations  methodologies.  52  Further,  on  the  basis  of  that  investigation,  we  will  determine  whether  further  rate  adjustments  may  be  necessary  or  appropriate. 


 V.  CONCLUSION  AND  ORDERING  CLAUSES 
 X.  For  the  reasons  stated  herein,  WE  FIND  that  the  rates  subject  to  this  investigation  and  identified  in  this  Order,  of  Beehive  Telephone  Company,  Inc.  and  Beehive  Telephone,  Inc.  Nevada  are 
 unlawful.

 Telephone  Company,  Inc.  and  Beehive  Telephone,  Inc.  Nevada  SHALL  REFUND  to  its  customers  with  compounded  daily  interest,  the  difference  between  Beehive's  filed  rates  and  the  rates  directed  prescribed 
 herein,  from  the  effective  date  of  the  Beehive's  tariff  up  to  but  not  including  the  effective  date  of

 SEPARATE  STATEMENT  OF  COMMISSIONER  HAROLD  FURCHTGOTT-  ROTH 
 Re:  Beehive  Telephone  Company,  Inc.,  CC  Docket  98-  108 
 While  I  join  in  today's  Order,  I  write  separately  to  express  my  concern  with  the  Commission's  decision-  making  process.  This  item  has  a  five-  month  statutory  deadline  of  today, 
 but  was  not  circulated  until  last  Wednesday.  I  am  becoming  increasingly  concerned  that  the  Commission's  internal  procedures  that  typically  limit  the  majority  of  Commissioners'  input  until 
 after  an  item  has  been  fully  drafted  and  presented  is  not  only  precluding  full  consideration  of  important  issues  by  the  entire  Commission  in  a  timely  manner,  but  ultimately  delaying  the 
 decision-  making  process.  Indeed,  in  such  a  rushed  environment,  the  Commission  may  not  be  having  an  opportunity  to  fully  appreciate  the  broader  ramifications  of  their  actions,  which  may 
 cause  further  delay  in  subsequent  Orders  dealing  with  related  issues.  53  I  look  forward  to  working  with  my  colleagues  to  attempt  to  rectify  this  situation. 


 53  See  e.  g.,  GTE  Tel  Operating  Company  Transmittal  No  1148,  CC  Docket  98-  79, 
 Memorandum  and  Opinion  and  Order  (rel.  October  30,  1998)  (GTE  DSL  Order).
