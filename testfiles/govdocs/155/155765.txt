		RICH MECHANICAL MEETING AGENDA
			10/25/02 -HC 


HPD array for the test beam.
	Review electrical feedthrus-dwgs 407317 & 407318 on rich testbeam page
	Review of HPD occupied mu-metal tubes -dwg 407317 and locations.ps
	Once these issues have been reviewed it should be a short time to get
	the prints ready for fabrication.  Also the assembly fixture will need
	to be updated (the rods will have to be replaced to reflect the new HPD
	diameter)

Material compatibility issues
	To use carbon or not to use carbon, that is the question.
	What about mirrors, mirror support panel, windows.
	What other material compatibility issues await us??
	
Acrylic availability
	Some grades of acrylic are only available in 48" widths, 
	 We currently have sizes 84" square.
	May need to investigate making seams - a lap joint in required to
	maintain integrity.
	
Comments about the mirror 3 point mount evaluation from Syracuse....

Comments about the thermistors located on the HPD readouts. We need a ohms vs.
	temperature curve, need to know how to calibrate them (are there 
	standards?) and what temperature range you are interested in monitoring)

Status of Other topics.....

Other Updates on RICH Test Beam Stand 
	Review progress on Tank Fabrication
	
	Still needs a gas recirculation system and monitoring system
	
	Comments about HPD electronics cooling.
		possibly could use a heat pipe from the electronics to the hexad
		frame- then use liquid cooling near the hexad frame.
	
C-Zero RICH Tank comments

	Potential design changes for going from HPDs to multinode PMTs
	No update.....
	
	Liquid radiator thermal analysis
	No update.....
	
	Mirror support panel prototype.
	A detailed FEA analysis has been submitted but will take time.....

	Rear window 
	A thick panel foam design has been submitted for FEA analysis.....
	
	WBS and cost book
	Waiting for fermi cost estimates on the HPD hexad, beehive assembly
	fixture, and 3 point mirror mounts....
