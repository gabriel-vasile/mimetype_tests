                   UNITED STATES BANKRUPTCY COURT
                   MIDDLE DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA
                                  
The Electronic Public Access System for the Middle District of Pennsylvania allows outside access to the
Middle District of Pennsylvania's computer system for information retrieval.  The system provides
information on bankruptcy of adversary cases filed in both the Wilkes-Barre or Harrisburg offices. 
Information pertaining to creditors, claims, and attorneys is also available.

Because of the current organization of the information in the Middle District, you are able to view all
Middle District information at both locations. This means that when you call the Wilkes-Barre Electronic
Public Access System, the Harrisburg information that can be seen will be information that is current as
of the previous day.  If "up to the minute" information is important to you, it would be best to call that
location's Electronic Public Access System.  

For registration, billing and support inquiries contact the PACER Service Center in San Antonio at:
                           (800) 676-6856.
                                  
Each location is able to handle two simultaneous calls through the use of a "rollover" phone feature.  The
phone numbers for each location are:

         Wilkes-Barre(717) 821-4033-or-(800) 640-3037
         Harrisburg(717) 782-3727-or-(800) 882-6899

All phone numbers are able to accept modem speeds up to 14400 baud, but the condition of some phone
connections may require 9600 baud for better reliability.  Your communications software should be set
for 8 data bits, No parity, 1 Stop bit and RTS/CTS or NONE for Flow Control.

The communications software which is used at the bankruptcy court to control the Public Access
communication is Norton's pcAnywhere, version 4.5. While it is not mandatory or necessary,  you will
find maximum functionality and reliability if you use the same software, version 4 or greater, or you can
use most common communications software and emulate the following terminal types:

           1. pcAnywhere IV                       11. Falco FAME III       21. Soroc
           2. Ampex 230       12. Hazeltine 1500                      22. Tektronix
           3. ADDS Regent                         13. Hewlett-Packard      23. Teleray
           4. ADDS Viewpoint                      14. IBM 3101        24. Televideo
           5. ANSI Standard                       15. Kaypro          25. Visual V330 (DG)
           6. Beehive 4/78/DMS                    16. Kimtron KT-7 PC      26. VT 100/200
           7. Dasher D410/D460                    17. Link PCTERM          27. Wyse
           8. DEC VT-52       18. LSI ADM 3A      28. Zenith Z-19
           9. Dig Microsystems                    19. Prime PST100         29. Zenith Z-29
          10. Esprit III      20. Qume (102/108)                      30. ATERM or OnLan PC

If you have a common communications software package other than pcAnywhere, you may find the most
reliable emulation will be VT100 emulation.

                           How to Sign On
                                  
         1.    Call one of the Electronic Public Access phone numbers listed on page 1 with your
               communications software.

         2.    When asked to Enter password: key gildea and press the ENTER or RETURN key. (You may
               use upper or lower characters).

         3.    Select one of the following terminal emulations by keying its number and press the ENTER or
               RETURN key:

















NOTE:   If you are using pcAnywhere AND have it set up to use pcAnywhere emulation choose
        option 1.  (If you are using pcAnywhere version 5.0, and are using the Call Host PC 
        option, choose 1)  If you choose terminal emulations 2 through 29, you MAY need to use
        the following table of key sequences:
                   To use:ESC---->Press:ESC ESC

The following display appears after you have successfully selected your terminal emulation.  If the
screen you see does not look similar (i.e. you see strange letters or numbers that look something like
13:H,07:14National etc..), there is a setting which is incorrect in your communications software or
you did not select the correct terminal emulation.  In that case, you should hang up and check your
settings when not connected, then call back and select the terminal emulation that matches your
communications software settings.  First refer to your communications software settings to see if there
is something that needs to be changed.   


At the initial NIBS display, your connection time is being logged (30 minute consecutive maximum)
but you are not being billed.  You can select which data set you want to see, or choose to download
documentation (this document) or Local Rules (Bankruptcy Practice Orders) for the northern tier
of the Middle District of Pennsylvania.

                             DOWNLOADING

Downloading is the transfer of a "file" from one location to another through the use of
communications software.  ("Capture" is not downloading.)  The only files available for downloading
from the Middle District of Pennsylvania Bankruptcy PACER system are this document and the Local
Rules (Bankruptcy Practice Orders) for the Northern Tier.  Successful downloading may be dependent
on your knowledge of how to use your communications software.

           1.  Before dialing in, have your communications software set for the XMODEM-1K protocol
               (some can be set on demand, others would be set in your dialing directory)
           2.  Connect and select the desired download option
           3.  Answer the "ready" question with a Y
           4.  Activate "download" or "receive" on your software.  (If the transfer/download/receive
               works correctly, you will see a display that shows the amount transferred incrementally.)  
If your software asks for file names, use the following:
             For the documentation: EPADOC
             For the Local Rules: RULES

After you select either the Wilkes-Barre data or the Harrisburg data, you will see the following
display. Key the ID that was assigned to you by the Pacer Service Center and press ENTER.

























Key the PASSWORD that was assigned to you by the Pacer Service Center here, and press ENTER.
(billing will begin after the ENTER key if login is successful.)




















Once your ID and Password have been keyed, they are checked against the registered users file which is
stored at each location.  These registrations are received and updated daily by the systems staff in each
location.

If you key an ID and Password that do not match exactly to a record in the registered users file, you will
see a display similar to the following.  If you think you may have miskeyed your ID or Password, simply
press the space bar and try again.

Sometimes it is necessary for local systems staff to communicate with a specific caller.  To do so, they
can attach a message to your login.  If a message is attached, it will display after successful login,
otherwise you will automatically progress to the Client ID display.

At the Client ID display, you can key something (name, case number, file number, etc..) that will appear
on your bill.  This will help allocate charges to specific cases for those that need it.  (To change the Client
ID without disconnecting, simply return to the first menu, and re-select Wilkes-Barre or Harrisburg data.)

                     NIBS CASE LOOKUP AND DISPLAY


Program Synopsis

        These options allow you to view case information.  You can locate a case using the case
number, debtor/business name/alias, or Social Security Number/Tax ID number.  The case information
and adversary information is linked so that you can view related adversaries for a case or the case for a
specific adversary.  Choose the option which best suits your needs.  When using Search by Name, keep
in mind that only a few letters are needed (i.e. SMIT when looking for SMITH) to position you to the
area of the file where you can then scroll forward or backward alphabetically until you find the correct
case or adversary.  (The Middle District of Pennsylvania currently does not store Miscellaneous Matters
on the computer, the option remains here for future use.)

          A) Search by Name:  The name or alias, business or individual listed in
                              any case or matter.
        B) Search by Case Number:       Case number of any bankruptcy case.
        C) Search by Adversary Number:  Case number of any adversary case.
        D) Search by SSAN or Tax ID:    Social Security or tax numbers.
          E) Search by Misc. Matters:Case number of a miscellaneous matter.
        F) Return to the First Menu:         Step back one menu.

        Selecting B for bankruptcy docket, will generate display of the actual legal record of the
case.  First you will be asked if you want to Print the Docket?; answer yes (Y) only if you are using
pcAnywhere, have your software set up to Print to Remote Only, and have your local printer ready
to print. (Printing will not DISPLAY, only print to paper on your local printer.)  You will also be
asked if you want to position yourself at specific entry numbers (i.e. Start with entry number); this
is meant to be a time saving feature for large dockets only.  If the docket is less than 500 entries, all
entries will be displayed regardless of what you request.

        On the docket display screen, the highlighted keys may be used for navigation through the
docket.  The <Spacebar> allows you to move down, one line at a time, while the D moves you
down a page at a time.  Pressing H takes you to the top, or home position, of the docket, and E will
take you to the very end.  When you are done viewing the docket, you should press Q to return to the
case information screen.

        Pressing O will give you the option to "find" a piece of information that appears in the
docket; a key word, a date, a name, etc.  (Note:  this option may not be available for all users, since
it may be deactivated by certain terminal emulators.  If this option doesn't work, contact the system
staff at the court for further information.)

        Some courts may also allow the option of printing the docket via the Case Lookup and
Display option.  In such courts, you will be asked if you want to print before the docket is displayed.

Search by Case Number

        This option will produce the same results as described above, except that you will be asked
to enter a case number instead of a name.  If the case number entered is not found, NIBS will find the
closest match, and you will be asked to select a case from the list.
