Associated Builders & Contractors, Inc. v. Herman, 976 F.
Supp. 1 (D.D.C. 1997).
     Holding that the Department of Labor has fulfilled the
     requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.  The
     court found that it was reasonable for the Department
     of Labor to conclude that few small entities would be
     affected by its refusal to re-implement and enforce
     regulations related to employees known as "helpers."

Southwestern Pennsylvania Growth Alliance v. Browner, 121
F.3d 106 (3d Cir. 1997).
     Holding that the intervenor may not raise its RFA
     argument because it was not adequately presented to the
     Environmental Protection Agency during the rulemaking
     process.  Explaining that the 1996 SBREFA Amendments
     were severable and that the judicial review provision
     could be applied to a legislative rule promulgated
     before their effective date.  Also holding that when a
     principal party adopts an argument, which was fully
     briefed by an intervenor, the intervenor may argue the
     question just as if the principal party had fully
     briefed the issue itself.

Associated Fisheries of Maine, Inc. v. Daley, 127 F.3d 104
(1st Cir. 1997).
     The court held that the Final Regulatory Flexibility
     Analysis (FRFA) prepared by the National Marine
     Fisheries Service puruant to the RFA was not inadequate
     on its face.  The court ruled that an agency can
     satisfy provisions of the RFA by setting forth the
     requirements for the FRFA, "as long as it complies
     meaningful, easily understood analysis that covers each
     requisite component dictated by the statute and makes
     the end product readily available to the public."  The
     court also made mention that the Secretary of Commerce
     considered numerous alternatives, studied the need to
     alleviate the regulatory burden on small entities
     within the fishing industry, adopted some measures to
     ease that burden, and satisfactorily explained his
     reason for rejecting others.

Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association v. Nichols, 142
F.3d 449 (D.C. Cir. 1998).
     The court held that the EPA did not violate the statute
     by not conducting a regulatory flexibility analysis.
     The court found that a regulatory flexibility analysis
     need not be completed when there is not a "significant
     economic impact on a substantial number of small
     businesses."  This decision reaffirmed prior decisions
     where the court held that an agency is not obligated to
     conduct a small entity impact analysis on entities that
     the agency does not regulate.  The EPA in this case was
     only obligated to consider the impact of the rule on
     small automobile manufacturers subject to the rule,
     which it adequately did.

Northwest Mining Association v. Babbitt, 5 F.Supp. 2d 9
(D.D.C. 1998).
     Northwest Mining Association claimed that the Bureau of
     Land Management (BLM) did not follow the legal
     procedure required by the RFA when it issued the final
     rule.  NWMA challenged the BLM's use of "small entity"
     when it certified that there would not be a significant
     impact on a substantial number of small entities.
     During this case, the Office of Advocacy filed its
     first ever amicus curiae brief in court, challenging
     BLM's use of a small business size standard that was
     not in compliance with the SBA's size standards
     published in compliance with the Small Business Act.
     The brief also raised concerns about BLM's failure to
     comply with the APA and the substance of the economic
     analysis put on the record by the BLM.  The court
     agreed with the Office of Advocacy's position and
     holding that the BLM had not complied with the RFA.
     The court held that the final rule's certification
     violated the RFA by failing to incorporate the correct
     definition of "small entity."  The court reaffirmed the
     importance of agency compliance with the RFA by
     stating, "While recognizing the public interest in
     preserving the environment, the Court also recognizes
     the public interest in preserving the rights of parties
     which are affected by government regulation to be
     adequately informed when their interests are at stake
     and to participate in the regulatory process as
     directed by Congress."

     Analysis, which discussed the impact on small cable
     operators and cable programmers.  The court explained
     that the revised rules would only have a "positive"
     effect on programmers, and this analysis was enough to
     satisfy the obligations of the RFA.

Grand Canyon Air Tour Coalition v. FAA, 154 F.3d 455 (D.C.
Cir. 1998).
     The FAA certified under the RFA that its plan to reduce
     aircraft noise would not have a significant economic
     impact on a substantial number of small entities.  The
     Office of Advocacy had earlier filed comments on the
     FAA's notice of proposed rulemaking and when the matter
     went to court, the Office of Advocacy filed a "Notice
     of Intent to File an Amicus Curiae Brief."   This
     notice, pursuant to Section 612(b) of the RFA, was
     written to address the FAA's noncompliance with the
     RFA.  The Office of Advocacy ultimately withdrew this
     Notice in exchange for an agreement with the U.S.
     Department of Transportation that the FAA would "submit
     to the court a statement detailing the new data
     regarding the number of aircraft subject to the
     regulation.[and] include in their communication to the
     court a statement that the agency erroneously certified
     under the Regulatory Flexibility Act that the final
     rule would not have a significant economic impact on a
     substantial number of small entities."
     The court explained that the FAA completed a lengthy
     analysis of the economic impact that the reduction of
     aircraft noise from sight seeing tours in Grand Canyon
     National Park would have on small businesses.  The FAA
     considered alternatives and responded to comments in
     what the court called a "rational decision-making
     process."  The court decided to defer to the FAA's
     judgment and technical expertise.

Supp. 2d 650 (E.D. Va. 1998).
     Finding that the Secretary of Commerce, William M.
     Daley, acted arbitrarily and capriciously in failing to
     give any meaningful consideration to the economic
     impact of the quotes placed on North Carolina
     fisheries.  The court found that the Economic Analysis
     prepared by the Secretary failed to comply with the
     Regulatory Flexibility Act because it failed to
     consider the effect on fishing communities or small
     entities.  It also never considered profitability or
     costs of any kind.  The court found that the Secretary
     did not make a good faith attempt at reasonable
     compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act and
     other statutes.  The court concluded that the Secretary
     and the agency did not uphold their responsibilities
     under the law, and it set aside the 1997 summer
     flounder quota and imposed a penalty against the NMFS.

Greater Dallas Home Care Alliance v. United States, 36 F.
Supp. 2d 765 (N.D. Tex. 1999).
     Holding that the Department of Health and Human
     Services (HHS) did not violate the Regulatory
     Flexibility Act because under the Balanced Budget Act
     of 1997 (BBA) the Secretary of HHS was not granted the
     authority to look at other alternatives in implementing
     the interim payment system (IPS).  The court stated
     that the underlying statute set forth in detail the
     formula for the new cost limit.  As a result, HCFA was
     merely implementing Congress' directives and was,
     therefore, not required to conduct a regulatory
     flexibility analysis.
     In a subsequent motion to reopen the case, the
     plaintiff sought to include a letter written by the
     Office of Advacacy, dated June 15, 1988, as new
     evidence.  The letter criticized HCFA's procedure in
     promulgating the regulations.  The court denied the
     motion, stating that the letter is a legal opinion on
     issues fully presented and argued during the hearing
     already held.  The court also found that, even if the
     letter contained factual information, it was cumulative
     and duplicative of evidence presented by witnesses.
     The court further explained that admitting it into
     evidence would be prejudicial and disruptive because
     the defendants would be allowed to cross-examine the
     authors of the letters and call witnesses in
     opposition.

Tutein v. Daley, 43 F. Supp.2d 113 (D. Mass. 1999).
     New England commercial fishermen of Atlantic Bluefin
     Tuna claimed that the Secretary of Commerce violated
     the RFA by failing to prepare regulatory flexibility
     analysis for the guideline.  The Department had
     certified under the RFA that the guideline would not
     have a significant  impact upon a substantial number of
     entities.  The court deferred its ruling on the RFA
     issue by accepting the agency's argument that the issue
     is not ripe for decision by the court at this time.

National Propane Gas Association v. Department of
Transportation, 43 F. Supp. 2d 665 (N.D. Tex. 1999).
     The Department of Transportation's Research and Special
     Programs Administration (RSPA) instituted an emergency
     interim final rule to address concerns about the
     transportation of compressed gas on highways.  RSPA
     later modified and adopted the interim final rule as
     the emergency discharge control regulation for loading
     or unloading of cargo tank motor vehicles.  The rule
     was challenged on the ground that the defendants failed
     to prepare a FRFA.  The court held that although the
     agency did not prepare a FRFA, all of the elements of a
     FRFA were available throughout their summary of such
     analysis published in the Federal Register.  The court
     further explained that the RSPA had met all the
     requirements found in the RFA, and to require an
     additional analysis by the agency would be duplicative.

     the RFA; at most its role is advisory."  As a result,
     the court refused to defer to the SBA's interpretation
     of the RFA.  The court went on to explain that SBREFA
     did not change the court's decision in Mid-Tex.

Southern Offshore Fishing Association v. Daley, 55 F. Supp.
2d 1336 (M.D. Fla. 1999).
     In 1997 the Office of Advocacy filed to intervene as
     amicus curiae in this case.  The Office of Advocacy
     later withdrew from the matter after the Department of
     Justice stipulated that the standard of review for RFA
     cases should be "arbitrary and capricious."  Before
     withdrawing, the court noted that the Chief Counsel for
     Advocacy is the "watchdog of the RFA," and quoted
     excerpts from Advocacy's comments criticizing NMFS for
     not complying with the RFA.
     The court held that the secretary's certification of
     "no significant economic impact" and the FRFA failed to
     satisfy the APA standards and RFA requirements.  The
     court criticized the agency's economic analysis and
     failure to comply with the law.  The court then
     remanded the agency's RFA determinations to the
     Secretary with instructions to undertake a rational
     analysis of the economic effects and potential
     alternatives.
     The NMFS prepared a draft analysis and published it for
     public comment.  The Office of Advocacy concluded that
     the analysis did not comply with the RFA because the
     analysis lacked important substantive information about
     the economic impact of this rulemaking on small
     businesses.  The Office of Advocacy found that the
     agency did not use a consistent definition of the
     industry, there was no consideration on the impact on
     profits, the agency failed to present the economic
     information in a manner that could be understood by the
     public, the agency failed to perform an economic
     analysis of the alternatives, and it did not address
     all of the concerns raised by the court.

Sporty's v. FAA, 201 F.3d 441 (6th Cir. 1999).
     The court held that the FAA did not violate the APA in
     designating airspace as "Class B."  The court further
     held that the FAA was correct in ruling that the impact
     was justified and there would not be a significant
     economic impact on a substantial number of small
     entities.

Alenco Communications, Inc. v. FCC, 201 F.3d 608 (5th Cir.
2000).
     The court held that the FCC reasonably complied with
     the requirements of the RFA in promulgating interim
     orders to carry out the aims of Telecommunications Act
     of 1996, which called for universal service and
     competition in the local markets.  The court went on to
     explain that the RFA does not require cost-benefit
     analysis or economic modeling.  The RFA does not
     require economic analysis, but instead only requires
     the agency to discuss the steps it took to minimize the
     economic impact on small entities.

U.S. App. LEXIS 14052, 2000 WL 737750 (D.C. Cir. 2000).
     The court ruled that 603 of the RFA, which discusses
     initial regulatory flexibility analysis, was not
     subject to judicial review.  The court found that the
     EPA examined alternatives to product reformulation when
     creating regulations limiting content of volatile
     organic compounds (VOCs) in consumer and commercial
     products, and that its decisions were neither arbitrary
     nor capricious.

Michigan v. EPA, 2000 U.S. App. LEXIS 3209, 2000 WL 180650
(D.C. Cir. 2000).
     The court rejected the claim that the EPA violated the
     RFA when it issued a final rule mandating that 22
     states and the District of Columbia revise their state
     implementation plans (SIPs), which provide for the
     implementation, maintenance, and enforcement of the
     national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS), to
     mitigate the interstate transport of ozone.  The court
     further agreed with the EPA that the SIP regulating NO
     subx (nitrogen oxides) does not directly regulate
     individual sources of emissions.

     to issue its final regulations is excused by additional
     rulemaking requirements that Congress has imposed on
     agencies, like the RFA, since the Mine Act was passed
     in 1977.

1264 (11th Cir. 1998).
     The court held that determining if a regulation will
     have a "significant economic impact on a substantial
     number of small entities" is not the same as deciding
     if a rule is economically feasible.  The court also
     found that the Secretary of Labor's certification that
     single-shift sampling, instead of multi-shift
     measurements, will not have a "significant impact on a
     substantial number of small entities."

     notice of proposed rulemaking for the Ozone
     Transportation SIP Call.  The court found that the

Dunn-Edwards Corporation v. EPA, 122 F.3d 1070 (9th Cir.

     The court held that the judicial review provision of
     the RFA did not provide for judicial review of agency
     compliance with the rulemaking process governed by
     Section 183(e) of the Clean Air Act.  This section
     directs the EPA to conduct a study and then to
     promulgate regulations to control emissions of volatile
     organic compounds from consumer and commercial
     products.

     rule or regulation will not affect a substantial number
     of small businesses.  This ruling reaffirms Section
     603(b) of the RFA.

American Mining Congress v. EPA, 965 F.2d 759 (9th Cir.
1992).
     The court held that it lacks the authority to strike
     down the storm water rule on the basis of a flawed
     certification under Section 605(b) of the RFA.  The
     EPA's certification that no regulatory flexibility
     analysis was necessary constitutes a "determination by
     an agency concerning the applicability of any of the
     provisions of" the RFA, and is therefore unreviewable.
     The court also declined to invalidate the rule because
     the EPA was not required to consider economic and
     administrative impacts in formulating this rule.

Michigan v. Thomas, 805 F.2d 176 (6th Cir. 1986).
     The Sixth Circuit in this case decided to adopt the
     District of Columbia Circuit's conclusion in Thompson
     v. Clark.  In that case the court found that although
     an agency's compliance with the Act itself is not
     subject to judicial review, the contents of the
     analysis should be considered in determining whether a
     rule is reasonable.  Agency decisions may be overturned
     if the analysis is so defective that it renders the
     final decision unreasonable or if the agency fails to
     respond to public comment concerning the rules' impact
     on small entities.  The court further held that the EPA
     performed its regulatory flexibility analysis in its
     overall rulemaking analysis and it was unnecessary to
     consider any alternatives, to certify the proposed rule
     under section 605(b) or to prepare a complete initial
     regulatory flexibility analysis.

National Truck Equipment Association v. National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration, 919 F.2d 1148 (6th Cir.
1990).
     The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
     promulgated steering column standard for trucks under
     10,000 pounds.  The court used the RFA to reinforce its
     conclusion that the proposed amendment is impracticable
     and unreasonable.  Citing Michigan v. Thomas, the court
     commented that regulation can be found to be arbitrary,
     capricious, or contrary to law if it has a great impact
     on small businesses in violation of the RFA despite the
     fact that the Act does not permit judicial review.

Small Business Administration, 557 F.Supp. 37 (D.D.C. 1982).
     The court held that the Small Business Administration
     was granted summary judgment and the complaint against
     the SBA was dismissed.  The plaintiff had challenged
     regulations promulgated by the SBA placing limits on
     the period of time a business may receive assistance
     under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act.  The
     plaintiff's claim that the regulation was in violation
     of the RFA was withdrawn at oral arguments.

Transmission Access Policy Study Group v. FERC, 2000 WL
762706 (D.C. Cir. Jun. 30, 2000).
     The court held that it would not question FERC's
     decision.  FERC looked at the potential impact of Order
     888, and included in the order a provision allowing an
     exemption from compliance with the reciprocity
     conditions. The court ruled that nothing in the
     reciprocity conditions was unreasonable.
         (No subsequent case law)



United Distribution Companies v. FERC, 88 F.3d 1105 (D.C.
Cir. 1996).
     The court held that FERC has no jurisdiction to
     regulate the local distribution of natural gas. It
     further held that the contention that Order No. 636 may
     have a significant economic impact on LDCs is not
     sufficient to trigger the mandate of the RFA. FERC had
     no obligation to conduct a small entity impact analysis
     of effects on entities, which it does not regulate.

Time Warner Entertainment Co., L.P. v. FCC, 56 F.3d 151
(D.C. Cir. 1995).
     The court held that the RFA question was not properly
     before the court.  The reason for this was that none of
     the petitioners raised the issue in their petitions for
     review.  Since intervenors may only raise issues raised
     by the parties, the issue was not properly before the
     court.

Mid-Tex Elec. Cooperative, Inc. v. FERC, 773 F.2d 327 (D.C.
Cir. 1985).
     The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission proposed a
     rule which allowed electric utilities to include in
     their rate bases amounts equal to 50% of their
     investments in construction work in progress.  The
     Small Business Administration, arguing against FERC,
     stated that FERC "should have considered the impact of
     the proposed rule on wholesale and retail customers of
     the jurisdictional entities subject to rate regulation
     by the Commission."  FERC stated that "the RFA does not
     require the Commission to consider the effect of this
     rule, a federal rate standard, on non-jurisdictional
     entities whose rates are not subject to the rule."
     The court held that regulatory flexibility analysis is
     limited to small entities subject to the proposed
     regulation.  As a result, FERC was correct in its
     determination that it need not prepare a regulatory
     flexibility analysis in connection with its proposed
     CWIP rule.  The court concluded that "an agency may
     properly certify that no regulatory flexibility
     analysis is necessary when it determines that the rule
     will not have a significant economic impact on a
     substantial number of small entities that are subject
     to the requirements of the rule."

Thompson v. Clark, 741 F.2d 401 (D.C. Cir. 1984).
     The court held that the reviewing court may consider
     the contents of the preliminary or final regulatory
     flexibility analysis, along with the rest of the record
     in assessing not the agency's compliance with the RFA,
     but the validity of the rule under other provisions of
     law.  The agency is not required to respond to every
     comment it receives.  However, if the agency does not
     prepare a final regulatory analysis within 180 days
     from the date of publication of the final rule the rule
     will lapse and have no effect.

Small Refiner Lead Phase-Down Task Force v. EPA, 705 F.2d
506 (D.C. Cir. 1983).
     The court found that it could consider the adequacy of
     the EPA's regulatory flexibility analysis regarding the
     EPA's rule to set lead-content limits for leaded
     gasoline produced by certain small refiners.  The court
     found that the EPA had considered a reasonable range of
     alternatives and had given sufficient reasons for
     rejecting them.  The court further held, "that a
     reviewing court should consider the regulatory
     flexibility analysis as part of its overall judgment
     whether a rule is reasonable and may, in an appropriate
     case, strike down a rule because of a defect in the
     flexibility analysis."

American Moving and Storage Association, Inc. v. U.S.
Department of Defense, 91 F. Supp. 2d 132 (D.D.C. 2000).
     The court found that the RFA does not apply to the
     Department of Defense's procurement policy decision
     changing its distance calculation source to PC*Miller
     computer software.  The court held that the OFPPA
     publication for comment requirement does not reach the
     standard of APA "rulemaking."  As a result, the RFA
     does not apply.

New Mexico Cattle Growers Association v. U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service, 81 F. Supp.2d 1141 (D.N.M. 1999).
     The court agreed with the Fish and Wildlife Service's
     belief that economic considerations have no relevance
     to determinations regarding the status of species and
     intends that the economic analysis of the RFA does not
     apply.  The court held that the reason for this was
     because the Endangered Species Act requires the
     Secretary to make critical habitat listing
     determinations "solely on the basis of the best

Greater Dallas Home Care Alliance v. U.S., 1998 WL 355464
(N.D. Tex. June 22, 1998).
     The Small Business Administration wrote a letter to the
     Health Care Financing Administration criticizing HCFA's
     procedure in promulgating its January 2, 1998 and March
     31, 1998 regulations implementing the Interim Payment
     System of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.  The SBA
     claimed the HCFA violated the analysis requirement of
     the RFA among other things.  The court denied the
     request of Greater Dallas Home Care Alliance to reopen
     the evidentiary hearing to consider the letter.  The
     court claimed that the letter represented issues
     already presented and argued before the court.

     limits.  As a result, the court found that HCFA was
     implementing Congress' directives and was not required
     to conduct a 604(a)(5) analysis under the RFA.

Southern Offshore Fishing Association v. Daley, 995 F. Supp.
1411 (M.D. Fla. 1998).
     The National Marine Fishery Service certified under the
     RFA that the quota reduction was not expected to
     significantly affect a substantial number of small
     entities.  They cited that fisherman would be able to
     adapt their fishing operations, and that fishermen did
     not rely exclusively on revenue from shark fishing.
     The Small Business Administration criticized NMFS's "no
     significant impact" certification, stating that it was
     "perplexed" and "bewildered" by the "illogical
     certification."  The SBA went on to state the directed
     shark fishermen's "conversion to other fishing
     operations is costly and probably not feasible."
     The court, agreeing with the SBA, found no adequate
     explanation of the agency's calculation.  The court
     held that the Secretary of Commerce's certification and
     the FRFA failed to satisfy the APA standards and RFA
     requirements.  The court concluded by remanding the
     agency's RFA determinations to the Secretary with
     instructions to undertake a rational consideration of
     the economic effects and potential alternatives to the
     1997 quotas.

Supp.2d 647 (E.D. Va. 1997).
     The court stated that the government must make some
     showing that it has considered the potential effects of
     quotas for fisheries.  The mere showing that the quota
     was the same in 1997 as it was in 1996 was not deemed
     to be an analysis.  The court concluded that the
     Secretary of Commerce violated the RFA and the issue
     was remanded to the Secretary so that he could
     undertake the correct analysis to determine whether the
     quota had a significant economic impact on the North
     Carolina fishery.

     complied with the RFA in its promulgation of Amendment
     7.  The final rule listed the comments and responses
     the Secretary of Commerce received and explained why
     alternatives that would reduce the burden on fisheries
     were rejected.  The court held that the agency
     adequately complied with the RFA.  The court also held
     that judicial review was unavailable in this case

     portion of the 1996 SBREFA amendments to past agency

     that because the rule to allow interstate branching by
     federal savings associations does not increase the
     operating costs or otherwise hurt federal associations

Texarkana Livestock Commission v. United States Department

     The court held that the USDA could not produce any
     documents that indicated how it created its regulations
     relating to brucellosis testing of cattle involved in
     interstate movement.  The court found no mention of the
     effect on small entities nor any study or any
     supporting documentation.  The court concluded that the
     USDA's certification that there was no need for a
     regulatory flexibility analysis was incorrect.

Sargent v. Block, 576 F. Supp. 882 (D.D.C. 1983).
     The court held that the Secretary of Agriculture was
     correct in deciding there was no need for a regulatory
     flexibility analysis regarding the revision of
     verification procedures under the national school lunch
     program.  The court held that it had the power to
     review an agency's compliance with the RFA based on 5
     U.S.C. 611(b).  However the court found no evidence to
     contradict the Secretary's statement that there were
     "[n]o major increase in cost or prices for program
     participants, individual industries, federal, state or
     local government agencies or geographic regions."
