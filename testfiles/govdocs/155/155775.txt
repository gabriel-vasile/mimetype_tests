early bloom to the petal fall stage from North to South.
Peach and pear development ranged from full bloom to petal
fall across the six State region. Fruit growers continued
with protective sprays on fruit trees. Burning and mowing
continued in wild blueberry fields. Fungicides were
sprayed to protect against Mummyberry disease. Cranberry
bogs have experienced some winter kill however vines are
reported in good shape.  Growers applied insecticides for

-- Other Agricultural Comments and News

CONNECTICUT - Howard Rood (FSA), Fairfield/Litchfield:
Most farmers spent the week planting field corn. Some
farmers have started chopping grass. Crops look good. Ross
Eddy (FSA), Hartford/Tolland: Planting of field corn
continued at a fast pace. More planting of sweet corn and
snap beans. Laying plastic mulch and drip irrigation for
squash and pepper plants. A bit early for tomatoes. A
heavy bloom for apples. Mowing grass for silage. Marsha
Jette (FSA), New London: Busy planting silage corn, sweet
corn and other vegetables. Beginning first cut of hay in
the dryer fields. Greenhouse sales have been very good.
Dawn Pindell (FSA), Windham: Petal fall on most fruits. No
frost. Good moisture. Hot weather pushing things. Too
early to tell on pollination. Peach crop light due to lack
of buds. Still pruning, mowing, mulching blueberries.
Getting ready to plant vegetables. Blueberries not in full
bloom yet. Corn planting just beginning. Fields in good
condition, not too wet, not too dry in most areas. Karen
Vozarik (FSA), New Haven: Hay looks good. Warm and humid
weather for the past week has brought up the silage corn.
We have had showers during the night. Richard Meinert
(Ext), CT Cooperative: Orchard grass is in full flower.
Timothy is showing a few flowers. Grass in general is
short. Temperatures that jumped from late winter to mid
summer seem to have hastened flowering at the expense of
height for the grass. A number of fields are still too wet
for corn to get planted. Grass harvest is also  going to
have to wait for ground to dry. 

MAINE - Marvin Hedstrom, Northern Aroostook: Potatoes and
small grains: This past week has been a beehive of
activity with all growers in the fields; planting
potatoes, small grains, etc. Lime being applied. Cool
weather with gusty winds made it somewhat uncomfortable on
open machinery. Soils, although somewhat cold, appear to
be working up real well. No emergence of any crop as of
yet. Pam Hickey (Ext), Central Aroostook: Farmers are
planting grains. Some field work has begun to plant
potatoes. This past weekend soil temperatures are warmer
because of the sunny weather. If this warm weather
continues, farmers will be planting all week. Steve
London, Southern Aroostook: Potatoes and small grains:
Producers are planting when weather is good. Albert Dow
(NRCS), Piscataquis: Farmers are still spreading manure.
Livestock are starting to graze. A lot of tilling is going
on. A heavy shower Saturday seemed to bring out the wild
cherry blossoms and some apple blossoms by Sunday. Janet
King (FSA), Somerset: Corn ground being limed and
fertilized. Some corn is being planted. Rick Kersbergen
(Ext), Waldo: Nice rain on Saturday night helped with the
dry soil conditions. A lot of field work was done last
week and the corn planters are out. Apples are blooming
and the early strawberries are now flowering. Trudy Soucy
(FSA), Knox/Lincoln: Bees have been set out on blueberry
fields. Salad greens are available. Summer weather on
Saturday was great news for flowering plant and vegetable
seedling sales. An inch of rain Saturday night was a mixed
blessing - some fields were getting dry, others hadn't
dried out since spring. Dr. David Yarborough (Ext),
Washington: Wild blueberries: Fields being pruned by
mowing and burning. Crop  fields being sprayed with Indar
fungicide to protect them from Mummyberry disease. Michael
Tardy (FSA), Androscoggin: Greenhouses have been busy.
Trees, shrubs and seedlings now available. Soil moisture
is good. Farmers fixing pasture fences. Pastures not quite
ready for grazing. Manure spreading  continues. Gary
Raymond (FSA), Franklin: Growing season is about five days
ahead of schedule here. Peas are doing well. Sweet corn
under plastic up four to five inches. Oats and Barley
planted. Strawberries under special cover have berries
setting already. Field conditions are excellent. Laura
Rand (FSA), Oxford: Grass is getting green and the soil is
getting prepared for planting. Peas and sweet corn (under
cover) are being planted. Many producers are mending
fences after winter storms and spreading manure. 

MASSACHUSETTS - Arthur Williams (FSA), Berkshire:
Everybody is planting field and sweet corn. Some  spraying
for weed control. Orchards are misting spray on the trees.
Forage seeding is about all done. Crop conditions appear
to be good. One inch of rain Saturday night into Sunday
morning. Paul Russell (FSA), Southeast Massachusetts:
Conditions are greatly improved, weather was normal and
growers got a lot of planting completed. Cranberry bogs
have some winter kill but in general vines and buds are
average. Growers are applying insecticides for fireworm
and cranberry weevil. Growers also continue to apply
fertilizer. Frank Caruso (Ext), Plymouth: Cranberries:
Growers are applying pre-emergence herbicides, first
insecticides and fungicides (for root rot control).
Several beds have exceeded thresholds for cranberry
weevil, black-headed fireworn, and cutworm. Unfortunately,
it looks like its going to be another bad year for
insects. No frost nights this week. Winter injury still
looks horrid on some beds. David Rose (FSA), Bristol: A
great week for field work, a lot of planting being done.
Tomatoes, peppers and eggplant all being planted now.
Beets, beans and cucumbers all up and looking good.
Apples, and strawberries in full bloom. Ted Smiarowski,
Jr. (FSA), Hampshire/Hampden: It was a dry and very warm
week. Everyone is planting. Growers are planting field
corn, sweet corn, potatoes, cucumbers, winter squash,
cabbage, etc. We are a week ahead of schedule in planting
crops. Early potatoes are emerging and sweet corn under
plastic is 10 to 12 inches tall. The seed onion crop looks
good. Harvesting hay, spinach, asparagus and rhubarb.
Orchardists are mowing and applying a fungicide spray.
More rain is needed and some vegetable growers are
irrigating already. Gary Guida, Worcester: Great week for
farm work. Fields being plowed and fitted. Herbicide on
corn fields being applied. Corn planted May 2, finally up.
Retail sales of flowers strong with consumers willing to
pay slightly higher price for quality plants and products,
than at "box" stores. 

NEW HAMPSHIRE - Amy Ouellette (Ext), Belknap: Farmers are
very busy with field prep including liming, fertilizing,
seeding, laying plastic, planting corn and transplanting.
Fruit growers are monitoring pests, spraying, fertilizing
and finishing up pruning winter damage out of blueberries.
Hayfields and pastures are looking good. Garden center
sales are brisk. Carl Majewski (Ext), Cheshire: Plenty of
warm sunshine all week - great conditions for field work.
Corn planting preceding at a furious pace, some is just
starting to emerge. Grass and pastures continue to look
great, a couple of producers have started first cutting
baleage. Orchard grass starting to head out. Vegetable
growers continuing to lay plastic and put out transplants.
Steve Turaj (Ext), Coos: Corn planting has begun. Most
fields now worked up for seeding. Manure fertilizer
spreading continues throughout week. Nice weather for
field work with some rain over weekend. Grass meadows now
growing well, pastures looking good. Some winter damage
being seen on blueberries. Garden centers doing an active
trade. Tom Buob (Ext), Grafton: Corn planting continues as
weather permits. Some early planted corn is just emerging.
Dry soils were helped by rain late in the week but wet
soils are now too wet to work. Grass hay and pasture
growing well. Alfalfa growing slowly. New seeds are
emerging and added moisture should help. George Hamilton
(Ext), Hillsborough: Fruits: Peaches were in petal fall
stage. Apples and pear were at full bloom at the beginning
of week and petal fall by end of week. Some orchardists
concerned about the hot weather that occurred during week,
where bloom went by quickly and possibility of fire blight
infection. Planting fruit trees, raspberries, blueberries
and strawberries. Orchardists making sure to have
protective fungicide sprays applied. Vegetables:
Successive plantings of sweet corn and trying to finish
potato planting. Growers were plowing, discing fertilizing
and laying down plastic mulch and drip irrigation tape.
Some growers are gambling by transplanting field tomatoes.
Weed spraying on planted sweet corn fields. Harvesting
asparagus on weekend. Field Crops: Farmers spreading
manure, plowing, discing, fertilizing and planting corn on
fields. Grasses and forage crops growing quickly. First
hayfield being mowed. John Porter (Ext), Merrimack: Good
conditions for planting corn. Farmers were waiting for the
weekend rain to apply herbicides, because conditions have
been too windy, dry, and dusty. New grass and alfalfa
seeds are starting to look green. Mid May applications of
fertilizer on high bush blueberries should be timed around
rain and stage of fruit development. Great rotational
pasture conditions so far. Nada Haddad (Ext), Rockingham:
Busy week preparing and planting vegetable field. Picking
rocks. Strawberries and raspberries are in full bloom and
bees are active. Apples are mainly at petal fall stage.
Spraying protective fungicides and insecticides for plum
curculio in orchards. Mowing grass. Rain and
thundershowers occurred on late Saturday afternoon.
Pastures and hay fields look good. Pam Marvin (FSA),
Sullivan: A good week for field work. Showers mainly
coming in the evening. Some first cut of alfalfa has begun
in the valley. Silage corn planting has been moving right
along with good weather. First crop of dry hay looks to be
good quality. Most vegetable gardens and fields have been
planted and early vegetables have been emerging and look
real healthy. Geoffrey Njue (Ext), Strafford: In general
it was a good week to work the fields. However, the
weekend was overcast, rains and thunderstorm. Grass in hay
fields and pastures is growing well. Farmers busy planting
corn. Vegetable growers busy planting sweet corn and
laying plastic mulch for other vegetable crops. Greenhouse
and high tunnel tomatoes are growing very well. Fruit
growers busy monitoring diseases and spraying protective
sprays against scab. Greenhouses and garden centers
continue to experience increased plant sales. 

RHODE ISLAND - Karen Menezes (Ext), Newport: Lots of field
activity. Planting sweet and field corn, planting 
potatoes, harvesting some lettuce and early vegetables,
especially those under row cover. Spraying for insect and
disease control on Christmas Trees. Roadside stands and
garden centers are steamy with activity, the weather is
cool and sunny, great field weather. Catching up time.
Marilu Soileau (FSA), All Counties: Bright sunny weather
has the farmers out plowing and harrowing. The warm
sunshine has brought fruit trees well into bloom and the
maple trees are fully leafed out. 

VERMONT - John St. Onge/Kim Peterson (FSA), Lamoille: Many
farmers worked hard at corn planting last week. Others are
still spreading manure and preparing fields for planting.
Warmer temperatures and a weekend rain was very beneficial
for grass growth. Dave Blodgett (NRCS), Orleans: It was a
good week for planting corn. Top soil has dried enough to
till and seed almost everywhere. Most cows and heifers are
out on pasture now. First crop hay is growing well. Perley
Sparrow (FSA), Windham: This past week was hot dry and
most of the corn is planted. Germination rate looks good
with little insect damage. Sunday I saw my first haylage
being cut for 2004. The local sweet corn producer reported
that his corn is five to six leaves tall. Cutting spinach
and harvesting radishes. Jeff Carter (Ext), Addison:
Planting corn, new seeding hay. Tilling soil for planting.
Fertilizing hay fields, spray weed control on planted
corn. Pasture growth good, Dandelions and Lilacs in full
bloom. Soil moisture good at field capacity in most cases.
Some fields still very wet in lower areas. Chris Benedict
(Ext), Chittenden: At week's end apples (McIntosh) reached
full bloom. Pest management  concerns will take a week
off, but thinning thoughts have begun. With good moisture
last week, the trees are ready for warmer weather.
