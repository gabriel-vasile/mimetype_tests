.SHORT TERM...DEEP COLD UPPER TROUGH IS BECOMING WELL ENTRENCHED                
INTO THE DISTRICT THIS MORNING AS OBSERVED ON SATELLITE AND RUC                 
UPPER AIR ANALYSIS. THIS TROUGH WILL CONTINUE EVOLVING TODAY AS MORE            
COLD AIR FILTERS INTO THE DISTRICT TO PRODUCE MORE UNSETTLED                    
WEATHER. SHORT RANGE MODELS NOW INDICATING 700MB TEMP/S FROM MINUS              
13 TO 15 DEG-C OVER THE AREA ALONG WITH 500MB TEMP/S DOWN TO MINUS              
30 DEG-C. THESE TEMP/S TRANSLATE IN SNOW LEVELS DOWN TO 1000 FEET.

POTENTIAL FOR THUNDERSTORMS AS FAR SOUTH AS THE KINGS/TULARE AND                
KERN COUNTY LINE AND ALONG THE FOOTHILLS. THESE CONDITIONS WILL

...PERSISTENT SNOWS IN THE MOUNTAINS...WIND ACROSS THE LOWER                    
ELEVATIONS...FIRE WEATHER CONCERNS ON THE PLAINS AGAIN SUNDAY AFTERNOON...      
REALLY NO DISTINCT LETUP IN THE PATTERN THROUGH THE WEEKEND. THE                
UPPER LEVEL JET WILL CONTINUE THE OROGRAPHIC SNOW MACHINE ALONG                 
THE CONTINENTAL DIVIDE...BRINGING LOTS OF NEEDED SNOWFALL. NOT                  
NEARLY ENOUGH TO MAKE UP THE HUGE DEFICITS IN THE SNOWPACK ACROSS               
SOUTHERN COLORADO...BUT AT LEAST LESSENING THE BLOW OF A DRY                    
WINTER. LOOKS LIKE THERE WILL CONTINUE TO BE PERIODS OF LIGHT SNOW              
EARLY SATURDAY. SNOW WILL BECOME HEAVY AGAIN SATURDAY NIGHT AS A                
NEGATIVE TILT SHORTWAVE TROUGH EJECTS THROUGH COLORADO. LOOKS LIKE              
EVERY 12 HOUR PERIOD FROM SATURDAY THROUGH SUNDAY SHOULD DELIVER                
SEVERAL INCHES OF SNOW ACROSS THE CREST OF THE SAN                              
JUANS...INCLUDING WOLF CREEK AND CUMBRES PASSES. THE CENTRAL                    
MOUNTAINS SHOULD SEE PERIODS OF SNOW INTO EARLY MONDAY...WITH THE               
BEST SNOWFALL RATES LIKELY SUNDAY AND INTO EARLY MONDAY...AS THE                
THE SHORTWAVE MOVES THROUGH AND THE FLOW BECOMES MORE                           
WEST/NORTHWESTERLY.                                                             
WELL...WITH THE JET OVERHEAD...AND AN UPPER DISTURBANCE TO MOVE                 
THROUGH...YOU MIGHT EXPECT WINDY CONDITIONS. INDEED...IT LOOKS                  
GENERALLY WINDY THROUGH THE WEEKEND...BUT ESPECIALLY SUNDAY AS THE              
UPPER SHORTWAVE MOVES ACROSS...AND SURFACE LOW PRESSURE DEEPENS                 
ACROSS NORTHEAST COLORADO. THIS COMBINATION WILL TEND TO DRAW A                 
STRONG DOWNSLOPE FLOW OFF THE MOUNTAINS...PULLING DOWN THE WINDS                
FROM ALOFT. SHOULD SEE SUSTAINED VALUES OVER 25 MPH AND GUSTS TO                
40 MPH OR HIGHER. FIRE WEATHER CONCERNS WILL RETURN THIS DAY...DUE              
MAINLY TO THE WIND. RHS ARE A BIT QUESTIONABLE RIGHT NOW. THE                   
MODELS ARE CURRENTLY ONLY PROJECTING 15-20% ON THE PLAINS...WHICH               
ISN'T QUITE LOW ENOUGH FOR A FIRE WEATHER HIGHLIGHT. BUT...IF RHS               
DROP LOWER...THEN WE'LL DEFINITELY NEED SOMETHING. WILL CONTINUE                
TO MONITOR.                                                                     
THERE IS SOME SMALL THREAT FOR SNOW ACROSS THE LOWER ELEVATIONS                 
AND PLAINS AT TIMES THROUGH EARLY MONDAY. THE BEST WINDOW WILL RUN              
FROM SUNDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH MONDAY MORNING...AS THE MAIN UPPER                
LEVEL SHORTWAVE MOVES THROUGH. SOME SORT OF WEEK FRONT MAY PUSH                 
SOUTH THROUGH THE PLAINS SUNDAY NIGHT TO HELP FOCUS THINGS AT THE               
SURFACE. HOWEVER...UPSLOPE DOESN'T LOOK VERY GOOD AT THIS                       
TIME...SO PROBABLY JUST SOME BRIEF CONVECTIVE SHOWERS...POSSIBLY                
HELPED BY A LITTLE WEAK UPSLOPE.                                                
AFTER MONDAY...RATHER ZONAL (WESTERLY) FLOW PATTERN SETS UP OVER                
COLORADO. MEANS CONTINUED THREAT FOR SOME SNOWS ALONG THE                       
CONTINENTAL DIVIDE...BUT MAINLY JUST WIND AND MILD TEMPERATURES                 
OVER THE EAST. PROBABLY BE LOOKING AT FIRE WEATHER ISSUES AGAIN                 
AT TIMES DURING THE WEEK. LW

NIGHT. TEMPERATURES UPSTREAM ARE CURRENTLY /AT 20Z/ 80 DEGREES AS

INSTABILITY AXIS WILL TAKE UP RESIDENCE OVER THE LOWER OHIO VALLEY.             
A WEAKENING COLD FRONT WILL APPROACH THE LOWER OHIO VALLEY FROM THE             
NORTHWEST SATURDAY NIGHT. 850 MB LOW LEVEL JET WILL INCREASE TO NEAR            
60 KNOTS. DEEP LAYER SHEAR WILL BE IMPRESSIVE...PER 0 TO 6 KM SHEAR             
AT OR ABOVE 60 KNOTS THROUGH THE PERIOD. SEVERAL ROUNDS OF STRONG TO            
POSSIBLY SEVERE CONVECTION ARE LIKELY SATURDAY NIGHT. DESPITE THE

SE MISSOURI BEFORE LIFTING IT BACK NORTH AS A WARM FRONT SUNDAY

AREA ON MONDAY. IN ADVANCE OF THE FRONT...THE LOW LEVEL JET WILL                
AGAIN STRENGTHEN TO 50 PLUS KNOTS SUNDAY NIGHT. EXPECT AT LEAST ONE

BEYOND MONDAY...HIGH PRESSURE AND COOLER AIR WILL DOMINATE MOST OF              
THE WEEK. A MODERATELY STRONG MID LEVEL SHORTWAVE IN THE NORTHWEST              
FLOW ALOFT WILL CROSS THE LOWER/MID OHIO VALLEY AROUND MID WEEK. 12Z

THE NEXT SHORTWAVE TO AFFECT THE CWA IS ACROSS THE PACIFIC NW NOW.              
PLENTY OF COLD AIR ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SHORTWAVE AS WATER VAPOR                
SHOWING INSTABILITY AND COLD AIR ALOFT SHOWERS WITH BEEHIVE LOOK ON             
THE WEST COAST WITH SOME LIGHTNING ON THE WEST COAST. THIS SHORTWAVE            
WILL AFFECT THE CWA ON SAT AND SAT NIGHT. THE GULF OF MEXICO LOOKS              
WIDE OPEN FOR THIS STORM SYSTEM AND WILL HAVE PLENTY OF MOISTURE                
AVAILABLE TO WORK WITH. DRY SLOT OF STORM ALSO LOOKS TO MOVE ACROSS             
THE CWA IN THE AFTERNOON BASED ON 1000-500 MB RH OFF THE NAM. STRONG            
850-500 MB Q-VECTOR CONVERGENCE MOVES INTO THE CWA SAT AFTERNOON AND            
QUICKLY EXITS SAT EVENING ALONG WITH THE DEEPER MOISTURE. NAM SHOWS             
ISENTROPIC LIFT AND MOISTURE ON THE I280K-I295K SURFACES RETURNING              
SAT MORNING AND DRY SLOT SHOWS UP WELL ON THE I295K SURFACE 00Z SUN             
OVER THE CWA. GFS SIMILAR TO THE NAM...BUT SEEMS TO BE ABOUT 6 HOURS            
SLOWER THAN THE NAM WITH THE DRY SLOT AND ALSO BRINGING IN THE PCPN             
AND DEEPER MOISTURE AND THE GFS IS FURTHER WEST WITH THIS NEXT                  
SYSTEM WHILE THE NAM IS FURTHER EAST. WILL GO WITH A COMPROMISE AND             
GO STRONGER THAN THE GFS HAS FOR THE SFC LOW...BUT WILL NOT GO AS               
FAR EAST AS THE NAM DOES WITH THE TRACK OF THE SFC LOW THROUGH MSP.             
FORECASTING A CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS STILL LOOKS GOOD FOR SAT WITH             
NAM AND GFS BOTH SHOWING LIFTED INDICES AT 850 MB DOWN TO -2C OR SO             
AND GFS AND NAM BOTH HAVE ELEVATED CAPE AT 850 MB UP TO 300 J/KG AND            
GFS HAS CAPE UP TO 300 J/KG FOR MOST UNSTABLE CAPE. SPC EVEN HAS THE            
AREA IN A 5 PERCENT CHANCE OF SEVERE WEATHER WHICH LOOKS GOOD. WOULD            
NOT BE SURPRISED WITH THE DRY SLOT COMING ACROSS TO HAVE SOME                   
THUNDERSTORMS WITH SMALL HAIL IN THEM AND THIS WILL HAVE TO BE                  
WATCHED. IT IS UNUSUAL TO HAVE SEVERE WEATHER IN MARCH IN THE                   
U.P...BUT THERE HAS BEEN SEVERAL INSTANCES OF IT HAPPENING BEFORE IN            
MARCH AND SATURDAY COULD BE THE DAY FOR LARGE HAIL. GOING WITH A                
COMPROMISE OF SOLUTIONS...KEPT THUNDER IN IN THE EVENING FOR THE CWA            
AND ALONG WITH A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AS THINK THE DRY SLOT WILL BE                
COMING INTO THE CWA LATE IN THE AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING WITH THE            
MOST UNSTABLE AIR MOVING ACROSS THE CWA.                                        
NEXT SYSTEM WILL AFFECT THE CWA SUN NIGHT AND MON AND GFS SHOWS A               
SHORTWAVE OVER THE UPPER GREAT LAKES WHILE NAM DOES NOT SHOW THIS.              
PARALLEL NAM DOES AND IS CLOSE TO THE GFS SOLUTION AND THIS COULD BE            
A POSSIBLE SNOWSTORM FOR THE AREA. WILL FOLLOW THE GFS FOR THIS                 
FORECAST AND CONTINUE WITH A CHANCE OF SNOW ACROSS MOST OF THE CWA              
AND A MIX OF RAIN AND SNOW ACROSS THE EASTERN HALF OF THE CWA. IF               
THE GFS IS TO BE BELIEVED...IT IS PUTTING OUT ABOUT .75 INCH OF QPF             
WHICH WOULD DEFINITELY BE HEADLINES FOR THE AREA. WILL HAVE TO                  
CONTINUE TO WATCH THIS AND SEE IF THERE WILL BE SOME MODEL                      
CONTINUITY IN SOLUTIONS AND SEE IF THE NAM PICKS UP ON THIS WAVE.               
WILL ALSO BE INTERESTING TO SEE IF THIS COLD AIR MAKES IT INTO THE              
SYSTEM OR NOT. WILL CONTINUE TO MENTION THIS STORM SYSTEM IN THE                
HWO.                                                                            
OVERALL...DID NOT MAKE TOO MANY MAJOR CHANGES TO THE GOING FORECAST             
FOR TEMPERATURES OR WEATHER OTHERWISE. KEPT DRIZZLE IN FOR SAT NIGHT            
AND ADDED FREEZING DRIZZLE AS THE DRY SLOT MOVES THROUGH THE AREA               
AND TEMPERATURES DROP CLOSE TO FREEZING. PUT THIS IN FOR EARLY SUN              
MORNING AS WELL BEFORE DRY AIR MOVES IN AND WRAPAROUND PART OF STORM            
IS GONE.

WATCHING A COUPLE OF FEATURES CONGEAL NEAR THE REGION TO PRODUCE                
ISOLATED TSRA OVERNIGHT ACROSS THE MO OZARKS. A QUICK UPDATE TO THE             
FORECAST IS FORTHCOMING TO SHIFT COVERAGE OF ISOLATED HAIL POTENTIAL            
WESTWARD TO THE I-44 CORRIDOR TONIGHT.                                          
WAT VAP IMAGERY AND 500MB VORTICITY FROM RECENT RUC INITIALIZATIONS             
SHOWS AN ELONGATED MID LEVEL SHEAR AXIS EXTENDING FROM THE SOUTHERN             
GREAT LAKES INTO WEST CENTRAL TEXAS. AHEAD OF THIS FEATURE...A LOW              
LEVEL JET WAS STRENGTHENING...AS NOTED BY REGIONAL PROFILERS...AND              
ENHANCING MOISTURE TRANSPORT INTO THE REGION. WITH TIME...THE LLJ               
WILL STRENGTHEN TO AROUND 50KTS AND SHIFT EASTWARD AHEAD OF THE MID             
LEVEL SHEAR AXIS. A 100KT ULJ CORE WAS ALSO NOTED COINCIDENT WITH               
THE SHEAR AXIS ENHANCING UPPER SUPPORT. AT THE SFC...WINDS WERE                 
GENERALLY SOUTHEASTERLY WITH A DRYLINE EXTENDING FROM SOUTH CENTRAL             
OK THROUGH CENTRAL TX AND A WARM FRONT EXTENDING FROM JUST NORTH OF             
ARDMORE OK EASTWARD TO PINE BLUFF ARK. A BOUNDARY HAS BEEN NOTICED              
ON THE REGION 88D IMAGERY THIS EVENING. WITH NO SENSIBLE WX                     
DIFFERENCE NOTED BEHIND THIS FEATURE...IT IS LIKELY SOME SORT OF                
REFLECTION OF THE MID LEVEL SHEAR AXIS.                                         
A LINE OF CONVECTION HAS ERUPTED IN EASTERN OKLAHOMA IN RESPONSE TO             
THE UPPER FORCING AND STRONG ISENTROPIC LIFT NEAR THE 300K LEVEL                
(WHERE LLJ IS MOST NOTED). THIS ACTIVITY HAS BEEN DEVELOPING OVER A             
DRY LAYER IN THE LOWEST 10KFT AND HAS BEEN DIMINISHING IN INTENSITY             
AS IT MOVES TOWARD THE SW MO BORDER. THE LLJ CONTINUES TO INCREASE              
IN INTENSITY WITH 40-45KTS AT THE DE QUEEN AND NEODESHA PROFILERS IN            
THE PAST HOUR. THIS JET WILL CONTINUE TO PROMOTE ISENTROPIC LIFT                
INTO THE REGION AS THE MID LEVEL SHEAR AXIS STEADILY PROGRESSES                 
EASTWARD. AT THIS TIME...AREAS ALONG AND SOUTHEAST OF THE I-44                  
CORRIDOR WILL BE PRONE TO SCT SHRA/TSRA DEVELOPMENT FOR THE                     
REMAINDER OF TONIGHT (MOSTLY AFTER MIDNIGHT). AS THE LLJ VEERS WITH             
TIME THE FOCUS WILL SHIFT FROM WEST TO EAST. THE CONVECTION THAT HAS            
DEVELOPED OVER EASTERN OK HAS HAD A HISTORY OF PRODUCING QUARTER                
SIZED HAIL AND FEEL THAT IS PRUDENT TO SHIFT THE RISK AREA JUST A               
TAD TO THE WEST TO ALIGN WITH THE FEATURES NOTED ON SATELLITE AND               
RADAR. THIS ACTIVITY IS ELEVATED IN NATURE AND ANY WIND RISK IS                 
MINIMAL AT BEST. AM ONLY EXPECTING A FEW HAILERS AND NOTHING                    
WIDESPREAD. IN ADDITION...WITH COMBATING A RATHER STOUT DRY LAYER...            
QPF WILL BE ON THE LIGHT SIDE.                                                  
GOING POPS ARE STRATIFIED WELL AND WILL ONLY MAKE MINOR TWEAKS TO               
THEM...LOWERING VALUES A BIT IN WESTERN ZONES AND INCREASING A BIT

CHALLENGES O'PLENTY WITH THE FORECAST TODAY...WITH THE MOST PRESSING            
CONCERN BEING THE CONVECTIVE CHANCES OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS. RATHER             
DEEP LONG WAVE TROUGH HAS BECOME ESTABLISHED OVER THE WESTERN CONUS             
WITH 991MB LEE SIDE CYCLONE HAVING DEVELOPED TO THE EAST OF DENVER              
AS ONE SPEED MAX BEGINS TO EJECT OUT THE BASE OF THE MEAN LONG WAVE             
TROUGH. LOW LEVEL FLOW IS ALREADY RESPONDING TO THE FALLING HEIGHTS             
WITH REGIONAL PROFILER NETWORK ALREADY SHOWING A 20-40KT SOUTHERLY              
850MB FLOW ESTABLISHED FROM THE EASTERN TEXAS PLAINS NORTHWARD INTO             
THE MISSOURI VALLEY. GOES SOUNDER IMAGERY SHOWS A PLUME OF DEEPER               
MOISTURE BEING DRAWN NORTHWARD BY THIS SOUTHERLY FLOW WITH SOME                 
UNCONTAMINATED SATELLITE DERIVED PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES NEARING              
AN INCH WELL ONSHORE NOW.                                                       
AS THE BOUNDARY LAYER DECOUPLES THIS EVENING LOOK FOR A STRONG 50KT+            
LOW LEVEL JET TO DEVELOP AND INTENSIFY THE NORTHWARD ADVECTION OF               
LOW LEVEL MOISTURE INTO THE OZARKS. THE STRONG LOW LEVEL THETA E                
ADVECTION WILL BEGIN THE PROCESS OF DESTABILIZING THE ATMOSPHERE                
WITH POINT FORECAST SOUNDINGS FROM THE NAM AND GFS BOTH SHOWING                 
MUCAPES OF 500-1250 J/KG DEVELOPING OVERNIGHT. THOSE SAME SOUNDINGS             
ALSO ARE SHOWING A NON-NEGLIGIBLE AMOUNT OF CONVECTIVE INHIBITION               
WITH THE MOST UNSTABLE PARCELS SO A FAIR AMOUNT OF FORCING WILL BE              
REQUIRED TO BREAK THROUGH THE CAP. STRONG ISENTROPIC ASCENT AND                 
CONVERGENCE ASSOCIATED WITH THE STRONG LOW LEVEL JET COULD BE ENOUGH            
TO OVERCOME THE CONVECTIVE INHIBITION...BUT GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTIES             
KEPT POPS MODEST TONIGHT AND MOSTLY CONFINED TO THE EASTERN OZARKS              
CLOSER TO THE PROGGED STRONGER MOISTURE CONVERGENCE/TRANSPORT.                  
LOW DEVELOPING OVER COLORADO THIS AFTERNOON WILL MOVE QUICKLY                   
NORTHEASTWARD INTO THE UPPER MISSISSIPPI RIVER VALLEY SATURDAY                  
AFTERNOON. TRAILING DRYLINE/PRE-FRONTAL TROUGH WILL SAG INTO OUR CWA            
TOMORROW AFTERNOON BRINGING AT LEAST SOME POTENTIAL FOR CONVECTIVE              
DEVELOPMENT TOMORROW AFTERNOON AND EVENING. NAM FORECAST SOUNDINGS              
SHOW A DEEPLY MIXED BOUNDARY LAYER...PROBABLY UNREALISTICALLY SO                
WITH TOO MUCH CAPPING LIKELY BEING MIXED AWAY. SUSPECT THE NAM                  
FORECAST OF A COMPLETELY UNCAPPED ENVIRONMENT TOMORROW AFTERNOON                
ISNT REALISTIC AND WITH VIRTUALLY NO UPPER FORCING AND ONLY MODEST              
SURFACE CONVERGENCE ALONG THE BOUNDARY...HARD TO GET OVERLY EXCITED             
ABOUT PRECIPITATION CHANCES TOMORROW AFTERNOON. IF THUNDERSTORMS DO             
DEVELOP THEN DEEP LAYER SHEAR WOULD CERTAINLY BE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF             
SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS AND SUPERCELLS...SO ITS WORTH KEEPING AN EYE ON            
TOMORROW AFTERNOON.                                                             
GFS AND THE MAJORITY OF THE OTHER NUMERICAL GUIDANCE THEN SUGGEST A             
MUCH MORE VIGOROUS SHORTWAVE WILL SWING OUT OF THE WESTERN TROUGH               
AND INTO THE CENTRAL PLAINS. STRONG SURFACE CYCLOGENESIS WOULD THEN             
TAKE PLACE SUNDAY AFTERNOON WITH A SHARPENING DRYLINE ACROSS THE                
EASTERN PLAINS LIKELY LEADING TO CONVECTIVE INITIATION SUNDAY                   
AFTERNOON. ALL PARAMETERS (INTENSE DEEP AND LOW LEVEL                           
SHEAR...MODERATE INSTABILITY...FAVORABLE SHEAR VECTOR ORIENTATION               
WRT THE BOUNDARY) IN THE GFS REALLY SEEM TO POINT TO THE POSSIBILITY            
OF AN OUTBREAK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS AND POSSIBLY TORNADOS SUNDAY             
AFTERNOON AND EVENING ACROSS FAR EASTERN KANSAS AND WESTERN                     
MISSOURI.                                                                       
WHILE THE GFS SOLUTION IS STRONGLY SUPPORTED BY THE                             
GEM...NOGAPS...AND UKMET...THE NAM IS SINGING A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT            
TUNE AND NOT EJECTING A STRONG SHORTWAVE INTO THE PLAINS AND                    
ALLOWING SURFACE FLOW TO VEER MORE WESTERLY AND LEAVING LITTLE IF               
ANY HOPE FOR ANY SIGNIFICANT CONVECTION. GIVEN THE LACK OF SUPPORT              
FOR THE NAM AMONG ANY OF THE OTHER MODELS DECIDED TO DISCOUNT ITS               
SOLUTION...HOWEVER IT DID STICK ENOUGH DOUBT INTO MY MIND ABOUT                 
SUNDAYS SEVERE POTENTIAL TO KEEP THE HWO TONED DOWN A BIT. IF THE               
GFS DOES INDEED PAN OUT THOUGH...SUNDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING WILL              
BE VERY INTERESTING INDEED.                                                     
SHOULD SEE A SHOT OF COOLER AIR WORK INTO THE REGION IN THE WAKE OF             
SUNDAY'S SYSTEM WITH A RETURN TO NEAR NORMAL TEMPERATURES. MEDIUM               
RANGE MODELS ARE IN FAIRLY GOOD AGREEMENT ON DEVELOPING A ZONAL FLOW            
ACROSS THE COUNTRY NEXT WEEK WHICH WOULD MEAN NEAR AVERAGE                      
TEMPERATURES AND NO SIGNIFICANT PRECIPITATION CHANCES.

TWO ISSUES TO DEAL WITH OVER THE NEXT 6 TO 12 HOURS. FIRST IS THE               
POTENTIAL FOR A FEW TSRA TO AFFECT MAINLY THE SE HALF OF THE CWFA.              
TS WOULD BE ISOLATED TO LOW END SCATTERED IN NATURE AND POTENTIALLY             
FLIRT WITH KSGF AROUND OR JUST AFTER 06Z. FOR NOW...HAVE INTRODUCED             
A VCTS INTO THE TAF WITH RATHER HIGH BASES ON THE CIG...WELL ABOVE              
MVFR AND PROBABLY AROUND THE 7KFT LEVEL (BASED ON CURRENT OBS OVER

WILL END UP MOVING JUST TO THE EAST.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE RALEIGH NC                                             
1037 AM EST FRI MAR 10 2006                                                     
.SHORT TERM (REST OF TODAY THROUGH TONIGHT)...                                  
WEAKENING COLD FRONT OVER THE WESTERN PART OF THE STATE WITH VERY               
LITTLE CONVERGENCE ASSOCIATED WITH IT.  MORNING UPPER-AIR SOUNDING              
FROM GREENSBORO WAS STABLE...AND 12Z UPPER-AIR ANALYSIS SHOWS VERY              
LITTLE MOISTURE AT 850MB AND 500MB WITH ISOLATED POCKETS OF DEEPER              
MOISTURE AT 700MB FROM NORTH CAROLINA INTO GEORGIA.  AS THE FRONT               
MOVES EAST AT A VERY SLOW PACE...IT WILL CONTINUE TO WEAKEN.  WATER             
VAPOR IMAGERY ALREADY SHOWS VERY DRY MOISTURE MOVING NORTHEAST                  
TOWARD THE TRIAD...BUT THE SLOW MOVEMENT OF THE FRONT AND THE                   
SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT WILL ONLY ALLOW FOR A GRADUAL EASTWARD PROGRESS            
TO THE CLOUDINESS AT LEAST THROUGH THE EARLY-TO-MID PART OF THE                 
AFTERNOON.  MODEL SOUNDINGS FROM BOTH THE RUC AND THE NAM SUGGEST               
POTENTIAL FOR PRECIPITATION NEARLY NIL THIS AFTERNOON IN A STABLE               
ENVIRONMENT...BUT AVAILABLE MOISTURE AT 700MB COUPLED WITH SURFACE              
DEW POINTS THAT ARE RELATIVELY HIGH CENTRAL AND EAST MAY ALLOW FOR A            
FEW SPRINKLES.  LIKELY THE LAST CHANCES FOR ANY SPRINKLES WILL BE               
WITH THE WEAK WAVE MOVING NORTHEAST OUT OF SOUTH CAROLINA WHERE A               
FEW CLOUDS HAVE BUILT BACK TOWARD THE NORTHWEST ON THE LAST COUPLE              
OF VISIBLE IMAGES.                                                              
BASED ON MORNING THICKNESSES AND EXPECTED SUN...RAISED MAX                      
TEMPERATURES WELL INTO THE 70S EVEN TOWARD THE TRIAD THIS                       
AFTERNOON.  OTHERWISE...KEPT TEMPERATURES WHERE THEY WERE AS IT WILL            
NOT TAKE LONG WITH DEVELOPING SUN TO SEE READINGS HIT MAXES GIVEN               
GOOD MIXING.  BREEZY CONDITIONS WILL CONTINUE IN THE TIGHT SURFACE              
GRADIENT AND WITH 850MB WINDS FAIRLY STRONG OVER THE AREA...45KT AT             
KGSO THIS MORNING.  DEW POINTS SHOULD FALL INTO THE 40S AND POSSIBLY            
EVEN THE UPPER 30S TOWARD KINT BUT RELATIVE HUMIDITIES SHOULD STAY              
ABOVE 25 PERCENT.  STILL...NOT A GOOD DAY FOR ANY BURNING ACTIVITY              
GIVEN THE GUSTY WINDS.                                                          
BASED ON THE LATEST NAM AND RUC TRENDS...AND DRY AIR MOVING TOWARD              
THE STATE...REMOVED THE SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS FOR THE EVENING                
HOURS IN SOUTHERN ZONES.  THINK THE BETTER CHANCES FOR ANY SHOWERS              
WILL BE CONFINED TO LATER TONIGHT.  GRIDDED AND WORDED FORECASTS                
HAVE ALREADY BEEN ISSUED.

SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT)...                                      
MAIN FORECAST CHALLENGE IN SHORT TERM REVOLVES AROUND PRECIP CHANCES            
TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY. OTHERWISE PATTERN OF WELL ABOVE NORMAL TEMPS            
EXPECTED TO PERSIST THROUGH SHORT TERM.                                         
TODAY...REMNANTS OF ONCE POTENT SQUALL LINE THAT CROSSED THE TN                 
VALLEY THU AFTERNOON/EVENING WILL CROSS CENTRAL NC THIS MORNING. 00Z            
GSO SOUNDING DEPICTED QUITE A BIT OF DRY AIR OVER REGION PLUS DECENT            
MID LEVEL CAP.  IN ADDITION...BEST FORCING WILL LIFT WELL NW OF                 
REGION. THUS A LOT OF ELEMENTS GOING AGAINST SUSTAINING                         
NUMEROUS/SCATTERED SHOWERS CURRENTLY OVER THE MOUNTAINS FROM MAKING             
IT INTO THE PIEDMONT. PREVIOUS FORECAST OF 30% POP...MAINLY IN THE              
MORNING...APPEARS DIFFICULT TO IMPROVE UPON. WHILE DO NOT EXPECT A              
TOTALLY SUNNY DAY...A MILD START COUPLED WITH A BREEZY SW FLOW AND              
PARTIAL SUN THIS AFTERNOON SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO BOOST TEMPS INTO             
THE MID AND UPPER 70S THIS AFTERNOON.                                           
FOR TONIGHT INTO SAT MORNING...DECIDED TO ADD A CHANCE POP. APPEARS             
MINOR DISTURBANCE IN THE SW FLOW ALOFT WILL PASS JUST SE OF REGION              
LATE TONIGHT AND SATURDAY MORNING. GFS APPEARS TO SUFFER FROM                   
CONVECTIVE FEEDBACK BUT THE NAM HAS TRENDED TOWARD A SCENARIO                   
COMPARABLE TO THE GFS...JUST MORE BENIGN. BEST LIFT TO GENERATE                 
PRECIP APPEARS TO BE IN THE MID LAYERS...GENERALLY BETWEEN 305-310K             
LAYER (BETWEEN 8000-12000 FT). MODELS DISSIPATE MID LEVEL CAP BUT               
HAVE SEEN IN PAST EXPERIENCES THAT THE MODELS TEND TO                           
ERODE/DISSIPATE THIS FEATURE TOO QUICKLY. WHILE CAN'T RULE OUT                  
ISOLATED THUNDER...CONFIDENCE NOT HIGH ENOUGH TO MENTION IN FORECAST            
AT THIS TIME. SO FOR NOW JUST EXPECT A FEW SHOWERS. AGAIN...DUE TO              
PERSISTENT SW FLOW AND POTENTIAL FOR BREAKS IN CLOUDS DURING THE                
AFTERNOON...SHOULD SEE AFTERNOON TEMPS IN THE MID TO UPPER 70S.                 
EARLY SUMMER LIKE CONDITIONS SUN AS MID/UPPER LEVEL HEIGHTS BUILD               
OVER REGION AS STORM SYSTEM DEVELOPS/STRENGTHENS OVER THE PLAINS                
STATES. A BIT MORE SUN AND CONTINUED SW LOW LEVEL FLOW SHOULD BE                
ENOUGH TO PROPEL TEMPS TO NEAR 80/LOWER 80S OVER CENTRAL NC. THIS IS            
NOT IN RECORD TERRITORY AS RECORD HIGHS ARE IN THE MID 80S (GSO) TO             
NEAR 90 (RDU).                                                                  
LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...                                          
FEW IF ANY CHANGES MADE TO LONG TERM. CONTINUED SUMMER LIKE MONDAY              
IN BREEZY SW FLOW AHEAD OF STRONG COLD FRONT. TIMING OF BEST CHANCE             
FOR SHOWERS (SOME THUNDER?) STILL APPEARS TO BE LATE MONDAY NIGHT               
INTO TUESDAY. IN WAKE OF SYSTEM...EXPECT RETURN TO SEASONABLE TEMPS             
WED AND THU.

BROAD SCALE RIDGING CURRENTLY ACROSS THE REGION WILL CONTINUE TO                
RESULT IN DIMINISHING RAIN COVERAGE THIS MORNING ACROSS THE FORECAST            
AREA AS UPPER LEVEL SUPPORT RACES WELL TO THE NORTH. CEILINGS FOR               
THE MOST PART WILL REMAIN ABOVE 3KFT BUT CEILINGS COULD BRIEFLY                 
LOWER TO 1500-2500FT WITH A PASSING SHOWER. MEANWHILE BREEZY SW                 
WINDS OF 15KT WITH GUSTS TO 25-30KTS WILL CONTINUE THROUGH LATE                 
MORNING AS 60-65KT 850H JET STREAK PROGRESSES EAST ACROSS THE AREA.             
WILL SEE SCATTERED TO BROKEN MID AND HIGH CLOUDS THROUGH THE                    
AFTERNOON AND EVENING. A WARM FRONT/DEWPOINT BOUNDARY WILL LIFT

SFC LOW LOCATED SOUTHEAST OF NORTH PLATTE NEBRASKA AT 02Z. WIND                 
FIELD WOULD INDICATE SFC LOW TO MOVE TOWARD FSD TONIGHT AND 00Z                 
NAM AND RUC SHOWING THAT EXACT SAME THING. CONSENSUS OF ALL MODELS              
FOR PAST TWO DAYS HAS BEEN A FSD LOCATION FOR SFC LOW AT 12Z. THEN              
SFC LOW TO MOVE NORTHEAST TOWARD DLH AREA. BUT MAIN ISSUE WITH                  
THIS SYSTEM IS MOISTURE. VERY LIMITED MOISTURE ENTERING SYSTEM                  
WITH SOUTHEAST SFC FLOW AS LARGE STORM SYSTEM THAT MOVED THRU OHIO              
VALLEY AND GULF COAST STATES AS SHUT OFF ANY GULF INFLOW INTO                   
SYSTEM. SOUNDINGS AT 00Z FOR ABR SHOW DRY LAYER SUB 800 MB WITH                 
MODELS CONTINUING TO INDICATE SLOW SATURATION OVERNIGHT. RADAR                  
SHOWING WEAK ECHOES (SPRINKLES PER ABR)...WITH MAIN PCPN COMPLEX                
OVER NCNTRL NEBRASKA MOVING NORTHEAST. 00Z NAM/RUC CONTINUE TO                  
INDICATE ENOUGH SATURATION OVERNIGHT INTO SATURDAY FOR NARROW BAND              
OF SNOW FROM ABR-FAR-TVF-BDE AREA WITH BACK EDGE OF ANY REAL SNOW               
FROM ROSEAU TO GRAND FORKS TO VALLEY CITY. DROPPED ANY MENTION OF               
SNOW IN DVL REGION. SNOW GRIDDS WOULD HAVE 3-5 INCH IN BAND...WITH              
LITTLE EAST OR WEST OF ABOVE MENTIONED BAND. DUE TO DRY AIR AND                 
SLOW SATURATION OF THE SUB 800 MB LAYER...SLOWED DOWN TIMING OF                 
SNOW ARRIVAL IN GRIDDS AND ISSUED UPDATED ADVISORY STATEMENT TO                 
SLOW DOWN START TIME. THRU 12Z ANY PCPN TO REACH ONLY FARGO...THEN              
12-15Z WILL SPREAD NORTHEAST INTO NW MN. DID NOT MAKE ANY CHANGES               
TO ADVISORY AREA...BUT WITH NARROW BAND...PLACES ON FAR WEST AND                
EAST EDGES OF ADVISORY AREA WILL BE ON THE FENCE WITH LARGE                     
GRADIENT IN SHORT DISTANCES LIKELY ROX-GFK-VCY AREA ON WEST EDGE

VERY DIFFICULT TO TIME MOVEMENT OF SNOW AND MVFR/IFR CIGS/VSBY                  
INTO TAF SITES ATTM. NARROW AREA OF IFR CONDITIONS NOW APPEARS                  
MORE LIKELY INTO FAR BY 12Z AND BJI BY 15Z OR SO. GFK WILL BE ON

SHORT TERM...                                                                   
MAIN CHALLENGE CONTINUES TO BE STORM FOR TONIGHT AND SATURDAY.                  
MODELS ARE COMING MORE INTO LINE WITH OVERALL SCENARIO...AND                    
PLACES MOST QPF FROM SE ND TO FARGO TO AROUND BDE. WILL BE ISSUING              
A SNOW ADVISORY FROM NEAR VALLEY CITY TO SOUTH OF GFK TO BDE. THIS              
WILL INCLUDE THE FARGO AREA...WITH 3-6 INCHES POSSIBLE THROUGH THE              
EVENT.                                                                          
FOR TONIGHT AND SATURDAY...STRONG JET AND SHORTWAVE WILL EJECT OUT              
OF DEEP WESTERN TROUGH. SFC LOW WILL MOVE OUT OF NE                             
COLORADO...THEN WASH OUT AND MOVE INTO EASTERN MN. REGION WILL BE               
AFFECTED MAINLY BY SFC INVERTED TROUGH AND STRONG UPPER LEVEL                   
DYNAMICS AND DEEP LAYERED OMEGA/ISENTROPIC LIFT NEAR 290K SFC. THE              
MAIN PROBLEM FOR GETTING WARNING CRITERIA SNOW WILL BE FAIRLY                   
QUICK SHOT OF LIFT...AROUND 6-8 HRS. IN ADDITION...SFC TEMPS ARE                
WARM AND DEWPOINTS ARE ALREADY IN THE LOW TO MID 30S. THEREFORE                 
GETTING 6+ INCHES OVER A WIDE AREA APPEARS UNLIKELY. WE FEEL THAT               
A SNOW ADVISORY SHOULD WORK OUT WELL FROM NEAR VALLEY CITY TO                   
BDE...WHICH WILL ENCOMPASS MOST OF THE AREA PREVIOUSLY COVERED BY               
THE WATCH. I AM NOT AS CONFIDENT OF GETTING ADVISORY CRITERIA SNOW              
IN GFK...BUT IT WILL BE CLOSE AND FEE IT/S WARRANTED TO INCLUDE                 
GFK AREA. THERE COULD BE SOME AREAS...ESPECIALLY IN SOUTHEAST ND THAT           
GET CLOSE TO 6 INCHES FROM BANDED SNOW POTENTIAL...WITH FOCUSSED                
FRONTOGENESIS HERE. OVERALL THOUGH...3 UP TO 6 INCHES OF WET SNOW               
LOOKS LIKE A GOOD BET...WITH SNOW RATIOS AROUND 10 TO 1. IF AN                  
ARCTIC HIGH WAS IN PLACE TO THE NORTH...THIS WOULD BE A                         
BLOCK BUSTER STORM. LACK OF REAL COLD AIR FOR SYSTEM TO FEED ON                 
THOUGH SHOULD MEAN A MORE PROGRESSIVE AN FAIRLY QUICK SHOT OF                   
FAIRLY HEAVY SNOW. IN THE FAR SOUTH AND EASTERN AREAS...THERE                   
SHOULD BE JUST PLAIN RAIN SHOWERS TONIGHT...CHANGING TO SNOW BY                 
SATURDAY MORNING. WITH STRENGTH OF LIFT...CAN/T RULE OUT A RUMBLE               
OF THUNDER...ALTHOUGH WON/T MENTION WITH NEGATIVE SHOWALTERS WELL               
TO THE EAST.                                                                    
FOR SUNDAY AND MONDAY...A SYSTEM WILL BRUSH MAINLY SOUTHERN AREAS               
SUNDAY AFTERNOON AND SUNDAY NIGHT WITH A FEW INCHES OF SNOW                     
POSSIBLE. REST OF AREA WILL SEE A SLOW COOLING TRENDS WITH                      
SLIGHTLY COOLER AIR FILTERING DOWN FROM CANADA.                                 
LONG TERM...TUE THROUGH FRI...LONG RANGE MODELS IN FAIR AGREEMENT               
ON UPPER LEVEL FEATURES FOR EXTENDED FORECAST. 500MB RIDGE CONTINUES            
TO AMPLIFY OVER THE ROCKIES...KEEPING THE AREA IN NW FLOW FOR THE               
EXTENDED FORECAST. INITIAL SYSTEM MOVES OUT OF THE AREA ON                      
TUE...WITH HIGH PRESSURE DOMINATING THE WEATHER OVER THE AREA FOR               
THE REST OF THE EXTENDED FORECAST. ALTHOUGH DO KEEP NW FLOW OVER THE            
AREA...TIMING OF ANY WAVES THAT DO MOVE THROUGH THE FLOW HAS BEEN               
EXTREMELY TOUGH THIS WINTER AND WITH THE BEST LIFT AND MOISTURE                 
REMAINING S OF THE AREA...WILL KEEP THE FORECAST DRY AT THIS POINT.             
AS FAR AS TEMPS...REMAIN NEAR TO SLIGHTLY BELOW NORMAL THROUGH THE              
EXTENDED FORECAST.

THE WINTER STORM WATCH AND HAVE ISSUED A SNOW ADVISORY FOR 2 TO 5

SURFACE DEWPOINTS IN THE UPPER 50S TO LOWER 60S OVER PARTS                      
OF EAST TEXAS THIS MORNING. GFS AND RUC MODELS MORE AGGRESSIVE                  
IN LIFTING MOISTURE NORTHWARD THIS AFTERNOON AND TONIGHT AS                     
SURFACE LOW DEEPENS OVER NORTHEAST COLORADO/NORTHWEST KANSAS.

THIS AFTERNOON. DEEP MIXING ACROSS WESTERN INTO CENTRAL PARTS                   
WILL RESULT IN GUSTY WINDS DURING THE AFTERNOON.  LOW RH...

ENHANCED FIRE THREAT THROUGH THE WEEKEND WITH ONLY A SLIGHT CHANCE              
FOR RAIN. A DEEPENING SURFACE LOW OVER WESTERN KANSAS WILL CAUSE                
SOUTH TO SOUTHWEST WINDS TO INCREASE ACROSS THE AREA TODAY. THE                 
WINDS... ALONG WITH WARMER TEMPERATURES AND LOW HUMIDITIES... WILL              
AGAIN PUSH THE FIRE DANGER LEVEL INTO THE VERY HIGH TO EXTREME                  
CATEGORIES. LOW DEWPOINTS OVER WEST TEXAS WILL LIKELY CONTINUE TO               
SPREAD INTO WESTERN OKLAHOMA TODAY. WE HAVE EXPANDED THE RED FLAG               
WARNING FOR TODAY A LITTLE FARTHER EAST... INTO CENTRAL                         
OKLAHOMA... AND INTO SOUTHEAST OKLAHOMA. ALTHOUGH THE SOUTHEAST                 
SAW THE MOST RAIN OVER THE PAST DAY OR SO... THE WARM TEMPS...                  
GUSTY WINDS AND RELATIVELY DRY AIR... WILL QUICKLY DRY OUT THE

TEMPERATURES ARE EXPECTED TO BE WARMER... AND HUMIDITIES AGAIN                  
QUITE LOW... ALTHOUGH THE WINDS SHOULD NOT BE AS STRONG. SUNDAY                 
COULD POTENTIALLY SEE THE HIGHEST FIRE DANGER THREAT... ESPECIALLY              
IF THE GFS VERIFIES. THERE IS QUITE A BIT OF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN                 
THE GFS AND NAM FOR SUNDAY WITH THE GFS GENERATING MUCH MORE WIND               
AT LOW AND MID LEVELS. THIS APPEARS TO BE DUE THE MODEL DEVELOPING              
MORE SIGNIFICANT CYCLOGENESIS ACROSS KANSAS... IN RESPONSE TO A                 
STRONGER WAVE MOVING OUT INTO THE CENTRAL PLAINS. CURRENTLY WILL                
LEAN TOWARDS THE GFS SOLUTION AS SATELLITE INDICATES A FAIRLY                   
STRONG JET MAX IN THE PACIFIC... OFF THE COAST OF CANADA... WHICH               
MAY BE THE ENERGY THE GFS IS CAPTURING TO GENERATE THE STRONGER                 
WAVE IN THE CENTRAL PLAINS ON SUNDAY. THIS SCENARIO ALSO FAVORS                 
THE DEVELOPMENT OF A FEW THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE EASTERN PART OF                 
FORECAST AREA SUNDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING... ALONG AND AHEAD OF A              
RELATIVELY SHARP DRYLINE. IF THE GFS IS RIGHT ABOUT THE DEEPENING               
OF THE SURFACE LOW... WE WILL ALSO SEE EXTREME FIRE CONDITIONS                  
DEVELOPING TO THE WEST OF THE DRYLINE BY SUNDAY AFTERNOON.                      
HOWEVER... IF THE NAM PROVES CORRECT... THE DRYLINE PROGRESSION                 
WILL BE SIMILAR... BUT THE LOW LEVEL ENERGY IS MUCH LESS.                       
IN THE LONGER TERM... COOLER AIR WILL MOVE BACK INTO THE REGION BY              
MONDAY AND TUESDAY... BEFORE TEMPERATURES BEGIN TO WARM BY THE                  
SECOND HALF OF THE WEEK. GFS SHOWING SOME SIGNAL THAT A FEW                     
SHWRS/TSTMS COULD DEVELOP OVER THE SOUTH BY THURSDAY... AS                      
MOISTURE STARTS TO GET LIFTED OVER THE LOW LEVEL COOL AIR.

TRACKING JUST AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT STRETCHING FROM SOUTHWEST                 
ALABAMA TO NORTHEAST GEORGIA. AS THE COLD FRONT MOVES EAST DURING               
THE REST OF THE MORNING AND INTO THE AFTERNOON...IT WILL BEGIN TO               
LOSE ORGANIZATION AND STRENGTH UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF PERSISTENT

12Z GFS STAYS A BIT MORE CONSERVATIVE WITH INSTABILITY...THE MODEL              
DOES ALLOW LI VALUES TO DROP BELOW ZERO. WILL MAINTAIN MENTION OF

LEVEL CLOUDS TODAY...AS COMPARED TO YESTERDAY...MAY SUPPRESS MORE               
VIGOROUS MIXING THIS AFTERNOON. WINDS AT BOTH 925 MB AND 850 MB WILL            
BE DECREASING THROUGH THE AFTERNOON AS THE APPROACHING FRONT

REALISTIC FOR WIND SPEEDS TODAY WITH GUSTS OF 35-45 MPH. THE FAR                
WEST-SW COUNTIES SHOULD SEE THE STRONGEST WINDS AND MAY APPROACH                
ADVIOSRY LEVELS. THIS SHOULD ALSO BE ENOUGH TO KICK UP SOME DIRT ON             
THE CAPROCK AND RETAINED BLOWING DUST WORDING IN THE GRIDS. CLOUD               
COVER WILL BE ON THE DECREASE THROUGH THE AFTERNOON AS DRY SLOT                 
WORKS IN FROM THE WSW.                                                          
DEWPOINTS AT 3 AM ARE RUNNING IN THE SINGLE DIGITS ACROSS MOST OF               
SRN NM AND SW TX. THIS SHOULD BE THE SOURCE REGION FOR OUR SFC                  
MOISTURE TODAY. MODEL SNDGS DO INDICATE SOME DOWNWARD MIXING OF                 
SLIGHTLY MORE MOIST AIR FROM THE MID-LVLS BUT THIS DOES NOT APPEAR              
SUFFICIENT TO PRODUCE THE 20+ DEGREE DEWPOINTS INDICATED ON THE                 
CAPROCK IN THE MODELS. THUS HAVE REDUCED DEWPOINTS IN THE FCST GRIDS            
WITH THE CONSEQUENCE THAT ALL OF THE CWA REACHING RHS OF TEENS OR               
LESS BY AFTN. MORE ON THIS IN THE FIRE WEATHER SECTION.                         
WITH THE NEXT SPEEDMAX MOVING ACROSS WTX TONIGHT...AND THE SFC LOW              
BEGINNING TO KICK OUT ACROSS KS...EXPECT WINDS TO STAY ELEVATED                 
UNTIL 6Z OR SO...AFTER WHICH SFC PRESSURE GRADIENT BEGINS TO RELAX.             
THIS SHOULD LEAD TO A MILD NIGHT...WITH TEMPS MAINLY IN THE 40S.                
FCST X-SECTIONS SHOW LIFT AND INCREASED RH AT MID-LVLS...SO SKIES TO            
REMAIN PARTLY CLOUDY.

AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED             
THROUGH THE WEEKEND...PLEASE SEE FIRE WEATHER SECTION BELOW. PERSISTENTLY       
DRY AND WINDY WEATHER IS IN STORE FOR THE SOUTH PLAINS REGION THIS              
WEEKEND BEFORE A COUPLE OF WEAK FRONTS AFFECT THE AREA NEXT WEEK.               
BY 12Z SATURDAY A LONGWAVE TROUGH WILL BE ESTABLISHED OVER THE                  
WESTERN U.S. WITH FAST SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT SPREADING OVER THE              
SOUTHERN ROCKIES. THIS PATTERN WILL PROMOTE DEEPLY VEERED/DRY FLOW

OCCASIONAL MID/HIGH CLOUDS WILL STREAM THROUGH THE FAST                         
SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW OVER THE AREA...BUT SHOULD NOT BE SUBSTANTIAL                
ENOUGH TO SIGNIFICANTLY INHIBIT DEEP MIXING.

APPROACHING 140+KT UPPER JET NOSES TOWARD THE AREA LATE IN THE DAY.             
A MENTION OF GUSTS AND BLOWING DUST IS WARRANTED. GRADIENTS/WINDS

LATER SHIFTS WILL FURTHER EVALUATE THE WIND POTENTIAL.

PANHANDLE/NRN ROLLING PLAINS TODAY. STRONG SOUTHWEST TO WEST FLOW AT            
THE MID LEVELS CONTINUE ACROSS THE REGION TODAY. A STRONG JET MAX               
WILL MOVE ACROSS THE TX PANHANDLE AND SRN PLAINS AND DEEPEN A                   
SURFACE LOW OVER SOUTHEAST COLORADO. VERY STEEP LAPSE RATES WILL                
ALLOW MIXING OF 25 TO 35 MPH WINDS AT 700 MB TOWARD THE SURFACE.                
THIS WILL PRODUCE WINDS IN THE 20 TO 25 MPH RANGE AT THE 20 FOOT                
LEVEL OVER THE REGION. ADDITIONALLY...MINIMUM RH VALUES ARE EXPECTED            
TO DROP TO BELOW 15 PERCENT BY LATE MORNING AS TEMPERATURES WARM                
INTO THE 70S. FINALLY...VERY DRY FUELS WILL CONTRIBUTE TO CRITICAL              
FIRE WEATHER CONDITIONS. RED FLAG CONDITIONS OVER THE ROLLING PLAINS            
ARE SLIGHTLY LESS CERTAIN DUE TO WEAKER WINDS...BUT ARE STILL                   
EXPECTED TO MEET THE CRITERIA SOUTH OF HALL AND COTTLE COUNTIES.                
LONG TERM...FIRE WEATHER WATCHES WILL BE POSTED FOR AREAS ON THE

CAPROCK. A SLIGHT DECREASE IN HEIGHTS/TEMPERATURES AND SCATTERED/

60 KNOT WINDS ACROSS THE SOUTHERN MISSISSIPPI VALLEY INTO THE                   
TENNESSEE VALLEY AT 12Z. THIS WILL BRING LOW LEVEL MOISTURE INTO THE            
REGION STRAIGHT OUT OF THE GULF OF MEXICO. INSTABILITY IS ALSO                  
INCREASING SO HAVE LEFT THE CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS IN THE WEST                 
COUNTY WARNING AREA THIS EVENING. FOR TIMING OF THE PRECIPITATION               
USED MAINLY THE NAM UVV AND Q-V FORCING FORECASTS WHICH KEEPS THE               
BEST CHANCE OF SHOWERS BETWEEN 03-12Z TONIGHT. WITH THE STRONG WARM             
AIR ADVECTION AND CLOUD COVER...THERE WILL BE NO BIG SWING IN

THE VALLEYS AND A CATEGORY ABOVE GUIDANCE ON THE RIDGES.

SEEN DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS...HOWEVER...HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OFF            
THE SE COAST WITH WEAK SHORT WAVE MOVING ON THE OUTER EDGE OF THIS

CREATE ENOUGH LIFT TO IGNITE A FEW THUNDERSTORMS AS NAM DISPLAYING              
CAPE VALUES BETWEEN 200 TO 800 AND LI'S -2 TO -4C. CONSIDERING TIME

JET OVERNIGHT...NOT A LOT OF MOISTURE AVAILABLE DOWNSTREAM EITHER.              
SOUNDINGS FROM ILX...SGF...OAX AND TOP SHOW A VERY SIMILAR PROFILE.             
FORCING THAT COMES IN OVERNIGHT WILL HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO TO                
SATURATE THE COLUMN AND CONCERNED THAT SATURATION MAY NOT BE ABLE TO            
OCCUR. TIME/HEIGHT PLOTS FROM THE NAM MAINTAINS THE DRY LAYER INTO              
SATURDAY MORNING. THE RUC DOES SHOW AN INCREASE IN THE HUMIDITY IN              
THIS DRY LAYER...BUT ONLY TO ABOUT 50 PERCENT. THE GFS IS THE MOST              
AGGRESSIVE BRINGING THE MOISTURE IN...BUT DO NOT THINK THIS IS                  
CORRECT WITH DRY 00Z SOUNDINGS. WILL PUSH THE POPS BACK TO AFTER 09Z

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT                                      
THE MAIN FORECAST CONCERNS WITH THIS PACKAGE ARE PRECIPITATION                  
CHANCES FROM TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY...AND PRECIPITATION TYPE                  
FROM SUNDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH MONDAY.                                           
AFTERNOON SURFACE ANALYSIS HAD LOW PRESSURE NEAR NORTH                          
DAKOTA/CANADIAN BORDER...WITH COLD FRONT TRAILING TO ANOTHER LOW                
PRESSURE DEVELOPING OVER COLORADO. SURFACE DEW POINTS RISING INTO               
THE 40S ACROSS THE SOUTHERN PLAINS IN STRONG SOUTHERLY FLOW. WATER              
VAPOR IMAGERY INDICATED STRONG SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT OVER THE                
NATIONS MIDSECTION...WITH 300MB WINDS OF 100KTS EXTENDING FROM                  
KANSAS TO ARIZONA.                                                              
TONIGHT...AS SURFACE WAVE LIFTS OUT INTO THE CENTRAL PLAINS...STRONG            
FORCING MANIFESTED BY 850MB WARM AIR ADVECTION ON 40-50KT LOW LEVEL             
JET...ALONG WITH 850MB THETA-E ADVECTION. FORECAST SOUNDINGS                    
SUPPORTED ELEVATED CAPE OF AS MUCH AS 500 J/KG BETWEEN 06Z-18Z                  
11MAR06 THROUGH THE HAIL GROWTH ZONE OF MINUS 10C-MINUS 20C. BASED              
ON THIS...AND AS MIDNIGHT ARX FORECASTER MENTIONED...STRONGER STORMS            
SHOULD HAVE POTENTIAL FOR PRODUCING SMALL HAIL. HAZARDOUS WEATHER               
OUTLOOK WAS UPDATED AT 1750Z 10MAR06 TO INCLUDE THIS POSSIBILITY.               
SATURDAY...GFS AND NAM HAD DIFFERENCES WITH SURFACE FEATURES. OPTED             
TO MAINTAIN SPIRIT OF FORECAST DATA BASE...THUS GFS SOLUTION WAS                
UTILIZED. THIS WAS BASED ON GFS CONSISTENCY AND SIGNAL IN NCEP SREF.            
BEST FORCING ASSOCIATED WITH LOW LEVEL AND THETA-E ADVECTION                    
EXPECTED TO MOVE OUT OF THE FORECAST AREA. THEREFORE...MAINTAINED               
DIMINISHING RAIN PROBABILITIES DURING THE AFTERNOON GENERALLY FROM              
MISSISSIPPI RIVER WESTWARD...WHERE DRY SLOT WILL BE PUSHING IN.                 
WITH MODELS INDICATING BEST EFFECTS OF DRY SLOT TO AFFECT PORTIONS              
OF SOUTHWEST WI AND NORTHEAST IOWA ON SATURDAY...THESE AREAS SHOULD             
RECEIVE BEST INSOLATION. EVEN THOUGH GFS AND NAM MOS GUIDANCE WERE              
AT ODDS...TRENDED MAXIMUM TEMPERATURES UPWARD AT SUCH LOCATIONS AS              
KOLZ...KPDC...KOVS...WHERE PROBABILITIES APPEAR HIGHEST FOR                     
TEMPERATURES TO REACH ABOVE 60F SATURDAY AFTERNOON.                             
ON SATURDAY NIGHT...THE GFS...GEM...AND ECMWF MODELS ARE IN GOOD                
AGREEMENT THAT A VIGOROUS SHORT WAVE TROUGH WILL ROUND THE BASE OF              
THE WESTERN 500 MB RIDGE AND THEN MOVE NORTHEAST INTO THE CENTRAL               
PLAINS ON SUNDAY. SHORT WAVE RIDGING DEVELOPS AHEAD OF THIS SYSTEM              
ACROSS THE CENTRAL PLAINS ON AND UPPER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY LATE                  
SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY. THE STRONG SUBSIDENCE ASSOCIATED WITH                
RIDGE WILL KEEP SKIES PARTLY CLOUDY THROUGH SUNDAY MORNING.                     
ON SUNDAY AFTERNOON...STRONG FRONTOGENETIC FORCING DEVELOPS ACROSS              
IOWA AND SOUTHERN MINNESOTA. THIS IS ASSOCIATED WITH A SOUTHERLY                
50 KNOT 850 MB JET TIGHTENING THE 850 MB ISOTHERMS ACROSS THIS                  
REGION. IN ADDITION...THIS JET WILL BE BRINGING ABUNDANT GULF                   
MOISTURE NORTHWARD INTO THIS BOUNDARY RESULTING IN THE DEVELOPMENT              
OF PRECIPITATION. THIS SHOWS UP WELL IN BOTH THE GFS AND GEM                    
MODELS. THE NAM ALSO HAS THIS OCCURRING...BUT WELL TO OUR SOUTH.                
THE MAIN REASON FOR THIS IS THAT THE NAM IS MUCH WEAKER WITH THIS               
SYSTEM UNTIL IT MOVES INTO THE SOUTHERN PLAINS. AS A RESULT...IT                
DOES NOT DEVELOP THE SHORT WAVE RIDGING AHEAD OF IT. ALL OF THIS                
COMBINES TO KEEP THIS WELL TO OUR SOUTH. LOOKING AT THE WATER                   
VAPOR IMAGERY THIS SYSTEM CURRENTLY LOOKS RATHER STRONG OFF THE                 
WEST COAST. IN ADDITION...THE GFS...GEM...AND ECMWF HAVE BEEN VERY              
CONSISTENT WITH THIS SYSTEM OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS. DUE TO                
THESE TWO FACTORS...THE NAM MODEL WAS NOT CONSIDERED BEYOND                     
SATURDAY AFTERNOON.                                                             
TEMPERATURES ALOFT ARE A CONCERN ACROSS SOUTHEAST MINNESOTA ON                  
SUNDAY AFTERNOON. BOTH THE GFS AND ECMWF SHOW THAT THE AIR MASS                 
ALOFT WILL COLD ENOUGH THAT THE RAIN MAY MIX WITH SNOW OR                       
BE ALL SNOW. SINCE THERE HAS BEEN A TREND TOWARD WARMER AND WARMER              
TEMPERATURES BELOW 850 MB...I HAVE OPTED TO GO A CHANCE OF RAIN OR              
SNOW DURING THE AFTERNOON. THIS WILL LIKELY HAVE TO REVISITED AGAIN             
AS WE APPROACH THIS TIME PERIOD.                                                
ON SUNDAY NIGHT...THE MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW A RATHER TIGHT                    
BAROCLINIC ZONE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. 850 MB TEMPERATURES ARE               
AROUND 10C IN PORTION OF NORTHEAST IOWA AND SOUTHWEST WISCONSIN...              
AND -4C FROM DODGE CENTER MINNESOTA TO MEDFORD WISCONSIN. IN                    
ADDITION...THE GFS SHOWS A COUPLING OF THE 250 MB JET AND STRONG                
UPPER LEVEL DIVERGENCE AT THIS SAME LEVEL. THIS WILL FURTHER                    
ENHANCE THE LIFT ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. IN ADDITION...THE GFS                
CONTINUE TO SHOW THAT THE DRY SLOT WILL MOVE NORTHEAST ACROSS                   
NORTHEAST IOWA...AND SOUTHWEST AND CENTRAL WISCONSIN. THIS WILL                 
DESTABILIZE THE ATMOSPHERE ACROSS THIS REGION RESULTING IN THE                  
DEVELOPMENT OF SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THIS AREA. FURTHER                
NORTHWEST IN THE DEFORMATION AREA OF THIS SYSTEM...THE WARM                     
CONVEYOR BELT WILL BE BRINGING ABUNDANT GULF MOISTURE NORTHWARD                 
INTO THE DEFORMATION REGION OF THIS SYSTEM. THERE IS A STRONG                   
COUPLING OF THE -15C ISOTHERM AND THE FRONTOGENETIC FORCING...THIS              
WILL RESULT IN A BAND OF HEAVY SNOW LIKELY NORTH OF AN AUSTIN                   
MINNESOTA TO MEDFORD WISCONSIN LINE. THE HEAVIEST SNOW WILL LIKELY              
FALL FROM NORTHWEST IOWA INTO NORTHEAST WISCONSIN. IN THIS                      
BAND...SNOW AMOUNTS MAY BE IN THE 12 TO 18 INCH RANGE.                          
TEMPERATURES ACROSS THE SOUTHERN PORTIONS WILL BE RATHER TRICKY                 
ACROSS THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE COUNTY WARNING AREA BECAUSE OF THE              
WARM SECTOR OF THIS SYSTEM MOVING INTO THIS AREA. AS A RESULT...                
I WENT AWAY FORM THE DIURNAL TEMPERATURE TOOL AND I HAVE                        
TEMPERATURES ACTUALLY RISING OVERNIGHT.                                         
ON MONDAY...THE DEFORMATION ZONE QUICKLY SLIDES EAST ACROSS THE                 
FORECAST AREA. IN ADDITION...THERE WILL BE STRONG COLD AIR                      
ADVECTION. THIS WILL RESULT IN A CHANCE OF LIGHT SNOW ACROSS THE                
REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST AREA. HOWEVER LITTLE ACCUMULATION IS                  
EXPECTED. IN ADDITION...THE TEMPERATURES SHOULD BE FALLING                      
THROUGHOUT THE DAY.                                                             
.LONG TERM...TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY                                             
THE MEDIUM RANGE MODELS ARE IN VERY GOOD AGREEMENT THAT THE UPPER               
AIR PATTERN WILL BECOME MORE ZONAL FROM TUESDAY THROUGH                         
THURSDAY. EVEN THOUGH THIS IS THE CASE...THE GFS LOOKS TOO COLD                 
WHEN COMPARED WITH THE ECMWF AND GEM OUTPUT. AS A RESULT...I                    
TRENDED TEMPERATURES TOWARD THE WARMER MEMBERS OF THE GFS                       
ENSEMBLE...BUT I MAY NOT BE WARM ENOUGH YET. ON FRIDAY AND INTO                 
NEXT WEEKEND...A STRONG UPPER LEVEL RIDGE BUILD ACROSS THE CENTRAL              
UNITED STATES. THIS IS IN RESPONSE TO A 500 MB LONG WAVE TROUGH                 
DEVELOPING OVER THE WESTERN UNITED STATES. AS A RESULT...WE RETURN              
BACK TOWARD THE NEGATIVE PACIFIC NORTH AMERICAN TELECONNECTION

THE MOUNTAINS HAVE EXTENDED THE SNOW ADVISORY FOR THOSE AREAS

SHORT TERM...THROUGH SUNDAY...UNSETTLED PATTERN CONTINUES THROUGH               
THE PERIOD AND MAY BE PUNCTUATED WITH A MORE ORGANIZED EVENT SUNDAY.            
FOR THE REST OF THE AFTERNOON AND TONIGHT...SNOW WILL GRADUALLY END             
FROM SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. WILL PROBABLY             
LET THE SNOW ADVISORY CONTINUE UNTIL 6 PM EVEN THOUGH THE WORST OF              
THE SNOW IS OVER. IR IMAGERY SHOWING AN ENHANCED AREA OF CLOUDINESS             
MOVING INTO SOUTHEAST WYOMING...SO THE MOUNTAINS WILL GET ANOTHER               
INCH OR TWO IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS. SHOULD GET A BREAK IN THE              
SNOW TOMORROW BEFORE THE NEXT SYSTEM BEGINS TO AFFECT THE AREA LATE             
SATURDAY NIGHT/EARLY SUNDAY MORNING. A TREMENDOUS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN            
THE NAM AND GFS ON WHAT IS IN STORE. THE GFS SPINS UP AN UPPER LOW              
OVER WESTERN NEBRASKA WHILE THE NAM MAINTAINS NEARLY ZONAL FLOW.                
OTHER MODELS OUT THERE INDICATE THAT THE NAM SOLUTION IS A BIG                  
OUTLIER AT THE MOMENT SO HAVE MAINTAINED HIGH POPS FOR SUNDAY. DON'T            
HAVE THE CONFIDENCE TO ISSUE A HIGHLIGHT AT THIS TIME...BUT IF THE              
GFS VERIFIES THEN AREAS NORTH OF A TORRINGTON-ALLIANCE LINE WOULD               
SEE AT LEAST 6 INCHES FROM THE EVENT.                                           
LONG TERM...SUNDAY NIGHT THRU FRIDAY...WILL CONTINUE TO LEAN TOWARD             
THE GFS IN THIS PERIOD.  SNOW WILL BE TAPERING OFF SUNDAY EVENING AS            
AFOREMENTIONED SYSTEM PULLS EAST OF THE AREA WITH WEAK SHORT RIDGE              
MOVING ACROSS MONDAY.  PATTERN FOR THE EARLY TO MID PART OF THE WEEK            
GENERALLY ZONAL WITH A FAST MOVING SYSTEMS CROSSING THE CWA EVERY               
24-30 HRS.  THESE SHOULD BRING SOME SNOW SHOWERS MAINLY TO MTN AREAS

FORECAST UPDATED TO INCLUDE SEVERE THUNDERSTORM WATCH #59. LLJ                  
CONTINUES TO STRENGTHEN OVER THE REGION AND THUNDERSTORMS HAVE                  
EXPANDED IN COVERAGE OVER EASTERN OK AND WESTERNMOST ARK. THE DE                
QUEEN PROFILER NOTING 55KTS AT THIS HOUR. STILL DEALING WITH THE                
PROS AND CONS FOR CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT OVER THE NEXT FEW HOURS.               
WHILE THE LLJ CONTINUES EXCELLENT MOISTURE ADVECTION AT 925/850                 
LEVELS...THERE IS A LARGE DRY LAYER BELOW 600MB TO OVERCOME.                    
SHRA/TSRA THAT HAVE TRIED TO MOVE INTO THE AREA HAVE DISSIPATED IN              
LARGE PART DUE TO THIS DRY LAYER. MEANWHILE...THE SHEAR AXIS AT                 
500MB REMAINS ORIENTED NW TO SE ACROSS THE AREA WITH ANOTHER IMPULSE            
MOVING THROUGH EASTERN OK.                                                      
GIVEN GOOD THETA-E ADVECTION OVER THE NEXT FEW HOURS...ISENTROPIC               
LIFT ON THE 300K LEVEL WILL CONTINUE TO EAT AWAY AT THE DRY LAYER.              
THIS SHOULD ALLOW FOR ISO TS TO DEVELOP IN THE SVR WATCH AREA OVER              
THE SE PORTION OF THE CWFA. GIVEN SFC TEMPS IN THE UPPER 50S AND                
STRONG WARMING JUST OFF THE DECK DUE TO LLJ AM EXPECTING TS TO BE               
ELEVATED IN NATURE. MARGINALLY SEVERE HAIL (UP TO QUARTERS) REMAINS             
THE PRIMARY RISK. A ROGUE WIND GUST IS NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION...BUT            
A SLIGHT CHC AT BEST.

WATCHING A COUPLE OF FEATURES CONGEAL NEAR THE REGION TO PRODUCE                
ISOLATED TSRA OVERNIGHT ACROSS THE MO OZARKS. A QUICK UPDATE TO THE             
FORECAST IS FORTHCOMING TO SHIFT COVERAGE OF ISOLATED HAIL POTENTIAL            
WESTWARD TO THE I-44 CORRIDOR TONIGHT.                                          
WAT VAP IMAGERY AND 500MB VORTICITY FROM RECENT RUC INITIALIZATIONS             
SHOWS AN ELONGATED MID LEVEL SHEAR AXIS EXTENDING FROM THE SOUTHERN             
GREAT LAKES INTO WEST CENTRAL TEXAS. AHEAD OF THIS FEATURE...A LOW              
LEVEL JET WAS STRENGTHENING...AS NOTED BY REGIONAL PROFILERS...AND              
ENHANCING MOISTURE TRANSPORT INTO THE REGION. WITH TIME...THE LLJ               
WILL STRENGTHEN TO AROUND 50KTS AND SHIFT EASTWARD AHEAD OF THE MID             
LEVEL SHEAR AXIS. A 100KT ULJ CORE WAS ALSO NOTED COINCIDENT WITH               
THE SHEAR AXIS ENHANCING UPPER SUPPORT. AT THE SFC...WINDS WERE                 
GENERALLY SOUTHEASTERLY WITH A DRYLINE EXTENDING FROM SOUTH CENTRAL             
OK THROUGH CENTRAL TX AND A WARM FRONT EXTENDING FROM JUST NORTH OF             
ARDMORE OK EASTWARD TO PINE BLUFF ARK. A BOUNDARY HAS BEEN NOTICED              
ON THE REGION 88D IMAGERY THIS EVENING. WITH NO SENSIBLE WX                     
DIFFERENCE NOTED BEHIND THIS FEATURE...IT IS LIKELY SOME SORT OF                
REFLECTION OF THE MID LEVEL SHEAR AXIS.                                         
A LINE OF CONVECTION HAS ERUPTED IN EASTERN OKLAHOMA IN RESPONSE TO             
THE UPPER FORCING AND STRONG ISENTROPIC LIFT NEAR THE 300K LEVEL                
(WHERE LLJ IS MOST NOTED). THIS ACTIVITY HAS BEEN DEVELOPING OVER A             
DRY LAYER IN THE LOWEST 10KFT AND HAS BEEN DIMINISHING IN INTENSITY             
AS IT MOVES TOWARD THE SW MO BORDER. THE LLJ CONTINUES TO INCREASE              
IN INTENSITY WITH 40-45KTS AT THE DE QUEEN AND NEODESHA PROFILERS IN            
THE PAST HOUR. THIS JET WILL CONTINUE TO PROMOTE ISENTROPIC LIFT                
INTO THE REGION AS THE MID LEVEL SHEAR AXIS STEADILY PROGRESSES                 
EASTWARD. AT THIS TIME...AREAS ALONG AND SOUTHEAST OF THE I-44                  
CORRIDOR WILL BE PRONE TO SCT SHRA/TSRA DEVELOPMENT FOR THE                     
REMAINDER OF TONIGHT (MOSTLY AFTER MIDNIGHT). AS THE LLJ VEERS WITH             
TIME THE FOCUS WILL SHIFT FROM WEST TO EAST. THE CONVECTION THAT HAS            
DEVELOPED OVER EASTERN OK HAS HAD A HISTORY OF PRODUCING QUARTER                
SIZED HAIL AND FEEL THAT IS PRUDENT TO SHIFT THE RISK AREA JUST A               
TAD TO THE WEST TO ALIGN WITH THE FEATURES NOTED ON SATELLITE AND               
RADAR. THIS ACTIVITY IS ELEVATED IN NATURE AND ANY WIND RISK IS                 
MINIMAL AT BEST. AM ONLY EXPECTING A FEW HAILERS AND NOTHING                    
WIDESPREAD. IN ADDITION...WITH COMBATING A RATHER STOUT DRY LAYER...            
QPF WILL BE ON THE LIGHT SIDE.                                                  
GOING POPS ARE STRATIFIED WELL AND WILL ONLY MAKE MINOR TWEAKS TO               
THEM...LOWERING VALUES A BIT IN WESTERN ZONES AND INCREASING A BIT              
ALONG AND EAST OF THE I-44 CORRIDOR.

TWO ISSUES TO DEAL WITH OVER THE NEXT 6 HOURS. FIRST IS THE                     
POTENTIAL FOR A FEW SVR TSRA TO AFFECT MAINLY THE SE THIRD OF THE               
CWFA. TS COVERAGE IS EXPECTED TO BE ISOLATED TO LOW END SCATTERED IN            
NATURE AND MAINLY EAST OF THE I-44 CORRIDOR. HAVE INTRODUCED ONLY               
INCLUDED A CB OVER THE NEXT FEW HOURS AT KSGF WITH RATHER HIGH BASES            
ON THE CIG...WELL ABOVE MVFR. GUT FEELING IS THAT ANY ACTIVITY THAT             
ENCROACHES KSGF WILL END UP MOVING JUST TO THE EAST.                            
SECONDLY...THE LOW LEVEL JET WINDS WILL CONTINUE TO CREATE STRONG               
WIND SHEAR FOR THE REMAINDER OF TONIGHT. HAVE CONTINUED 50 KNOTS AT             
2000 FEET WITH ABOUT A 30 TO 40 DEGREE DIRECTIONAL CHANGE WITH                  
HEIGHT.                                                                         
FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE TAF VALID PERIOD...VFR CONDITIONS ARE                  
EXPECTED FOR MUCH OF TOMORROW. SOUTHERLY WINDS WILL BE GUSTY MUCH OF            
THE DAY. AS IS THE CASE FOR THE REST OF THE OVERNIGHT HOURS...THE               
AREA WILL BE ON THE WESTERN EDGE OF POTENTIAL TS DEVELOPMENT                    
SATURDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING. ANOTHER IN A SERIES OF UPPER                    
DISTURBANCES WILL SWING THROUGH THE REGION AT THIS TIME AND HELP                
INITIATE SCT TS. HAVE INCLUDED A VCTS AT KSGF AND CB AT KJLN DURING             
THE AFTERNOON HOURS TO ACCOUNT FOR LOWER PROB RISK OF TS. BEST

SFC LOW AND ASSOCIATED PRESSURE FALLS INDICATING THE LOW WILL TRACK

THE WINTER STORM WATCH AND HAVE ISSUED A SNOW ADVISORY FOR 2 TO 5               
INCHES BY NOON SATURDAY IN THIS AREA. EXPECT AN INCH OR LESS IN

FROM NORTH OF ABR TO EAST OF VALLEY CITY. BUT...CURRENT PROGRESS                
SUGGESTS THEY MAY ONLY HAVE 2-3 MORE HOURS AND THEN HAVE LIGHT                  
SNOW THE REST OF THE MORNING. THE INITIAL UPPER LEVEL SHORTWAVE                 
WILL MOVE ON THIS MORNING WITH ANOTHER SHORTWAVE TO TARGET                      
SLIGHTLY FARTHER EAST BY LATE MORNING/AFTERNOON. THUNDERSTORMS                  
NEAR THE FIRST SHORTWAVE WILL ARRIVE IN/NEAR RICHLAND COUNTY BY                 
12Z-13Z BUT AM NOT SURE WHETHER IT WILL BE RAIN OR SNOW. MORE                   
THUNDER IS BEGINNING NEAR MINNESOTA RIVER AND WILL NEED TO WATCH                
FOR PHASE OF PRECIPITATION FOR HEAVY SNOW AND A POSSIBLE WARNING.

STRONG. RUC AND ETA SHOW LIFTED INDEXES BELOW ZERO COVERING MUCH                
OF NORTHWEST MN LATE THIS MORNING AND EARLY AFTERNOON BUT ONLY                  
WHEN PARCELS ARE LIFTED FROM HIGHER THAN 850 MB. THE LIGHTNING                  
JUST WEST OF HON THIS MORNING WAS QUITE A BIT FARTHER WEST THAN                 
THESE MODELS SHOW THIS INSTABILITY. SO EXTENDED THE ISOLATED                    
THUNDER FARTHER WEST THAN THESE MODELS SHOW AND CONVECTION ALONE                
COULD PRODUCE 3 TO 5 INCHES OF SNOW IN A SHORT TIME. DIDN/T HAVE

1015 AM CST SAT MAR 11 2006                                                     
SCATTERED STORMS DEVELOPED QUICKLY THIS MORNING OVER NORTH CENTRAL              
TEXAS DUE TO ENHANCED ASCENT ON THE WESTERN PERIPHERY OF THE LOW                
LEVEL JET AND NEAR THE DRYLINE. RADAR SUGGESTS HIGH BASED                       
DEVELOPMENT WITH LITTLE RISK OF SEVERE AT THIS TIME. THE DRYLINE                
ADVANCED NORTHWARD VERY QUICKLY OVERNIGHT AND CURRENTLY EXTENDS FROM            
WAURIKA TO OKLAHOMA CITY AND STILLWATER...WHERE THE DRYLINE THEN                
INTERSECTS A WEAK COLD FRONT THAT EXTENDS WESTWARD FROM STILLWATER...TO         
NEAR OKLAHOMA CITY AND HOBART. PRESSURE GRADIENT AND THUS                       
CONVERGENCE ALONG BOTH BOUNDARIES REMAIN VERY WEAK WITH WINDS                   
LIKELY BECOMING VARIABLE NEAR THE BOUNDARIES AT SOME POINT THIS                 
AFTERNOON.                                                                      
ALTHOUGH STORMS APPEAR POORLY ORGANIZED AT THIS TIME...MORE                     
ORGANIZED DEVELOPMENT IS EXPECTED THIS AFTERNOON AS THE ATMOSPHERE              
DESTABILIZES FURTHER AND STORMS POTENTIALLY DEVELOP CLOSER TO THE               
SURFACE. THE DRYLINE IS FORECAST TO MOVE ONLY SLIGHTLY EASTWARD THIS            
AFTERNOON WITH THE COLD FRONT MOVING SOUTH OF OKLAHOMA CITY BEFORE              
STALLING...WHICH KEEPS SOUTH CENTRAL AND SOUTHEAST OKLAHOMA IN THE              
WARM SECTOR. MODIFIED RUC SOUNDINGS FOR FORECAST CONDITIONS THIS                
AFTERNOON SUGGEST MLCAPES OF 1300-2000 WITH DEEP LAYER SHEAR OF 50              
TO 70 KTS...WHICH WILL BE MORE THAN ADEQUATE FOR SUPERCELLS. THE                
HAZARDOUS WEATHER OUTLOOK WAS UPDATED EARLIER TO REFLECT SUPERCELL              
DEVELOPMENT...POSSIBLY AS EARLY AS 1 OR 2 PM...AS INSOLATION QUICKLY            
OVERCOMES A LARGE AND SHALLOW NOCTURNAL INVERSION NEAR THE DRYLINE.             
OTHERWISE...TEMPERATURES BEHIND THE COLD FRONT ARE STRUGGLING TO GET            
OUT OF THE 40S AND 50S OVER NORTHWEST OKLAHOMA WITH CONSTANT                    
MID/HIGH CLOUD DEVELOPMENT FORMING TO THE REAR OF AN UPPER                      
JET...REDUCING HEATING. WITH LIGHT WINDS PREVAILING OVER ALL BUT                
SOUTHEAST OKLAHOMA TODAY...RED FLAG WARNING CONDITIONS ARE NOT                  
ANTICIPATED OVER ABOUT THE NORTHERN THIRD OF OKLAHOMA....WHERE HIGHS            
WILL LIKELY REMAIN THE 60S. HUMIDITIES WILL STILL BE QUITE LOW                  
HOWEVER BUT SHOULD BE A LITTLE HIGHER THAN FORECAST DUE TO COOLER               
TEMPERATURES. WILL THEREFORE BE CANCELING THE RED FLAG WARNING FOR              
PORTIONS OF NORTHERN OKLAHOMA.                                                  
EXTREME FIRE DANGER APPEARS ON TRACK FOR SUNDAY AS THE DRYLINE                  
PUSHES ALMOST COMPLETELY EAST OF THE AREA AND A DEEPLY MIXED                    
BOUNDARY LAYER CONNECTS WITH STEEP MID LEVEL LAPSE RATES. WESTERLY              
FLOW OF AT LEAST 15 TO 25 KTS WITH GUSTS IN THE MID 30S SEEMS LIKELY            
WITH EVEN STRONGER WINDS POSSIBLY DEVELOPING...ESPECIALLY OVER                  
NORTHERN OKLAHOMA. FIRE WEATHER WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FOR ALL                 
AREAS SUNDAY WITH AN UPGRADE TO A RED FLAG WARNING POSSIBLE LATER               
TODAY.

DEWPOINT AIR MOVING OVER GROUND THAT HAD COOLED OVERNIGHT. BELIEVE              
FOG AND STRATUS SHOULD MIX OUT RELATIVELY QUICKLY THIS MORNING AS               
LOW LEVEL WINDS BEGIN TO VEER AND THE DRYLINE STARTS MOVING BACK                
TO THE EAST.

UNSEASONABLY WARM WEATHER WILL PERSIST THROUGH THE WEEKEND AS                   
HIGH TEMPERATURES AVERAGE AROUND 20 DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL.                       
MEANWHILE... LOW LEVEL MOISTURE... IN THE FORM OF 50 AND 60 DEGREE              
DEWPOINTS... CONTINUES TO SPREAD NORTHWEST INTO PORTIONS OF                     
CENTRAL AND SOUTHEAST OKLAHOMA EARLY THIS MORNING. WE EXPECT THE                
MOISTURE TO BE SHUNTED BACK TO THE EAST TODAY AS THE DRYLINE MIXES              
EAST. BEHIND THE DRYLINE... VERY HIGH TO EXTREME FIRE CONDITIONS                
ARE EXPECTED DUE TO LOW HUMIDITIES AND WARM TEMPERATURES. WINDS                 
WILL BE MODERATE... INCREASING IN THE AFTERNOON TO 15 TO 20 MPH...              
WITH OCCASIONAL GUSTS NEAR 25 POSSIBLE IN THE WEST. A FEW                       
THUNDERSTORMS MAY OCCUR AGAIN IN SOUTHEAST OKLAHOMA THIS                        
AFTERNOON AND EVENING... DEPENDING ON EXACTLY HOW FAR EAST THE                  
DRYLINE MIXES. THE DRYLINE IS EXPECTED TO WAFFLE BACK TO THE WEST               
OVERNIGHT. THE NAM HAS COME AROUND CLOSER TO THE GFS SOLUTION FOR               
SUNDAY WITH THE DEEPENING OF A SURFACE LOW OVER WESTERN KANSAS BY               
AFTERNOON AND THE DRYLINE MOVING EAST ACROSS THE AREA. THIS WILL                
RESULT IN GUSTY SOUTHWEST WINDS OVER MUCH OF THE AREA... WITH VERY              
LOW HUMIDITIES AND WARM TEMPERATURES BEHIND THE DRYLINE...                      
RESULTING IN EXTREME FIRE DANGER LEVELS. DEEP MIXING COULD RESULT               
IN WIND GUSTS OVER 35 MPH... WITH A FEW POSSIBLY PUSHING 45 MPH...              
AS WINDS IN EXCESS OF 60KTS ARE FORECAST AT 700 MB ACROSS THE                   
AREA BY SUNDAY AFTERNOON. WILL SCALE BACK THE AREA OF LOW POPS FOR SUNDAY       
TO LIMIT THEM PRIMARILY THE SOUTHEAST ZONES... BASED ON THE EXPECTED            
LOCATION OF THE DRYLINE BY LATE SUNDAY. AS THE SURFACE LOW MOVES                
EAST INTO THE MIDDLE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY... A COLD FRONT WILL DROP               
SOUTH INTO THE AREA BY LATE SUNDAY NIGHT... WITH A NAM A LITTLE                 
SLOWER WITH THIS FEATURE. THIS WILL COOL TEMPERATURES A BIT ON                  
MONDAY... BUT SOUTH WINDS AND WARMER READINGS WILL RETURN BY                    
MIDWEEK. ANOTHER COLD FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT...                
AND FOR NOW... PCPN CHANCES WITH THIS SYSTEM LOOK SLIM.

SOUTHEAST KANSAS. LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS IS ALSO SHOWING THE WEAK              
COLD FRONT SLOWING DOWN ITS PROGRESSION AHEAD OF THE WAVE IN                    
OKLAHOMA. RUC ANALYSIS IS SHOWING THE CAP WEAKENING ACROSS THIS                 
REGION. DEEP LAYER SHEAR IS ON THE ORDER 70KTS IN THIS REGION WHICH             
WILL BE FAVORABLE FOR SOME ROTATING SUPERCELLS.                                 
HOWEVER...SIGNIFICANT TORNADO PARAMETER AND THE SHEAR IS MOSTLY                 
UNIDIRECTIONAL SO I WOULD ANTICIPATE THE MAIN POTENTIAL TO BE LARGE             
HAIL AND DAMAGING WINDS. THESE STORMS WILL BE FAST MOVING SO THEY               
MAY NOT STICK AROUND TOO LONG. RIGHT NOW...I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED             
TO SEE THINGS DEVELOP BY 20Z DUE TO THE STRONG SHEAR INDUCING A                 
STRONG VERTICAL PRESSURE GRADIENT WHICH MAY HELP GET UPDRAFTS GOING             
BEFORE THE CONVECTIVE INHIBITION IS TOTALLY ERODED.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY AFTERNOON)...                               
CURRENTLY A WARM FRONT BISECTS THE FORECAST AREA FROM JUST NORTH OF             
HARTFORD IN OHIO COUNTY...EAST TO NEAR STANFORD IN LINCOLN COUNTY.              
TEMPS NORTH OF THE FRONT ARE IN THE LOW TO MIDDLE 50S...AND                     
IMMEDIATELY SOUTH OF THE FRONT LOWER TO MID 70S. THIS FRONT WILL                
HAVE MAJOR RAMIFICATIONS IN THE UPCOMING FORECAST...POSSIBLY                    
WORSENING THE CURRENT HYDRO ISSUES FROM THE PAST 72 HOURS OF                    
MODERATE TO HEAVY RAIN ACROSS SOUTHERN INDIANA AND EXTREME NORTH                
CENTRAL KENTUCKY. WILL BE FOLLOWING A 12Z NAM12/ 09Z SREF BLEND FOR             
SUNDAY... AND LIKE THE RUC IN THE VERY SHORT TERM AS IT DEPICTS THE             
40KT LOW LEVEL JET WELL MOVING NORTH INTO THE FORECAST AREA...AND               
ITS 850-700MB OMEGA FIELDS LOOK VERY REASONABLE...THOUGH SLIGHTLY               
DISPLACED SOUTHWARDS.                                                           
PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED WARM FRONT SITS ACROSS THE HEART OF THE                    
FORECAST AREA...SEE LITTLE REASON FOR IT TO MOVE MUCH NORTH AS THE              
FRONT HAS BECOME VIRTUALLY DETATCHED FROM ITS "PARENT" LOW...AND                
MODEST SFC HI TO THE EAST KEEPING DECENT EASTERLY FLOW INTO THE                 
NORTHERN REGIONS OF THE AREA. ANOTHER LOW DEVELOPING ACROSS OK ATTM.            
BOUNDARY ACROSS THE REGION WILL ENHANCE LIFT ACROSS THE NORTHERN                
HALF OF THE FORECAS AREA...WITH STRONG LOW LEVEL JET DRIVING INTO               
THE THROUGH KENTUCKY THIS EVENING...PAH RADAR SHOWING DEVELOPING                
STORMS INCREASING IN COVERAGE TO THE WEST AND SOUTHWEST...TRAINING              
WILL BE AN ISSUE TONIGHT AND WITH PWATS NEARLY 1.5 INCHES...HEAVY               
RAIN AMOUNTS CAN BE EXPECTED...WITH THE NORTH AND WESTERN PORTIONS              
OF THE FORECAST AREA SEEING THE MAJORITY TONIGHT. RUC HAS A GOOD                
HANDLE OF THE SITUATION THROUGH TONIGHT..WITH GOOD SUPPORT FROM THE             
NAM12. AS LL JET DEPARTS AFTER MIDNIGHT...SOME LESSENING OF COVERAGE            
WILL OCCUR AND HAVE LOWERED POPS IN RESPONSE. TEMPS WILL STAY WARM              
ACROSS MUCH OF THE REGION...WITH A DECENT GRADIENT FROM NORTH TO                
SOUTH.                                                                          
EARLY SUNDAY SFC LOW FROM OK HAS MOVED NE ACROSS IL INTO IN...FRONT             
WILL BE JUST OFF TO THE WEST OF THE FORECAST AREA AT 06Z...                     
INCREASING RAIN/THUNDER CHANCES FROM 6 TO 12Z SUNDAY AS THE FRONT               
DRAPES ITSELF NEAR OR ALONG THE OHIO RIVER BY AFTERNOON...AGAIN                 
HEAVY RAINFAL AMOUNTS WILL BE LIKELY...AND UNFORTUNATELY IT WILL BE             
IN THE NORTHERN PORTIONS OF THE CWA AGAIN. WITH HIGH PWATS STILL                
REMAINING AROUND 1.5 INCHES. PRECIP WILL LESSEN DURING THE                      
AFTERNOON...WITH BEST CHANCES REMAINING ACROSS THE NORTHERN PORTIONS            
OF THE AREA...ALONG OR JUST SOUTH OF THE FRONT. WARMER SUNDAY FOR               
THE NORTHERN HALF...THOUGH RAIN MAY KEEP TEMPS SLIGHTLY UNDER                   
FORECASTED...BUT 70S LOOK LIKELY FOR MOST OF THE REGION. SEVERE                 
CHANCES ARE GOOD FOR SUNDAY...INSTABILITY WILL BE INPLACE WITH                  
DEWPOINTS WELL INTO THE UPPER 50S PUSHING LOWER 60S...AND SFC LIS               
NEARLY -3 TO -5 BY AFTN...AND CAPES PUSHING 1000 TO 2000 J/KG FROM              
EAST TO WEST. WESTERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA ARE UNDER A MODERATE RISK            
FROM SPC...WITH SLIGHTRISK REST OF AREA. AGREE WITH SPC THAT SOME               
SUPERCELLS MAY BE POSSIBLE ...BUT THINK BOWS OR MULTICELLS WILL MORE            
LIKELY FOR OUR AREA...LARGE AND HAIL WOULD BE THE MAIN THREATS.                 
HAVE EXTENDED FLOOD WATCH BOTH GEOGRAPICHALLY AND TEMPORALLY...WENT             
ONE TIER OF COUNTIES FURTHER SOUTH AND OUT UNTIL 00Z MONDAY (SUNDAY             
7PM). EXPECT THAT NUMEROUS ROADS WILL HAVE WATER OVER THEM DURING               
THE NIGHT INTO THE DAY SUNDAY...ALONG WITH CREEKS/STREAMS WELL OUT              
OF THEIR BANKS IN THE WATCH AREA. --SCHOTT                                      
.LONG TERM (SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...                                   
STILL A COUPLE OF ROUNDS OF BUMPY WEATHER TO GET THROUGH IN THE                 
FIRST FEW PERIODS OF THE LONG TERM BEFORE THINGS CALM DOWN A BIT.               
SUNDAY EVENING LOW PRESSURE OVER KANSAS WILL HAVE A WARM FRONT EAST             
ACROSS ILLINOIS...INDIANA...AND OHIO. AS THIS LOW MOVES NORTHEAST               
WITH THE WARM FRONT TO OUR NORTH AND A COLD FRONT WELL TO OUR WEST              
WE WILL REMAIN WELL WITHIN THE WARM SECTOR SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY.            
THE COLD FRONT IS THEN EXPECTED TO SWEEP THROUGH OUR AREA MONDAY                
EVENING.                                                                        
THERE ARE TWO MAIN EPISODES OF STORMS EXPECTED. FIRST...STORMS WILL             
BLOSSOM OVER THE MID-MISSOURI VALLEY AND OZARKS SUNDAY                          
AFTERNOON...QUICKLY BECOMING SEVERE. THE STORMS WILL STRIKE OUT TO              
THE EAST AND WILL CONGEAL INTO A LINEAR MCS OVER THE MID-MISSISSIPPI            
VALLEY AROUND MIDNIGHT SUNDAY NIGHT AS THEY ENCOUNTER PWATS OVER 1.5            
INCHES...SURFACE DEW POINTS IN THE MID TO UPPER 60S...AND 850 HPA               
DEW POINTS AROUND 12 DEG C. THIS BAND OF STRONG TO SEVERE STORMS                
WILL CONTINUE EASTWARD AND WILL IMPACT SOUTHERN INDIANA AND CENTRAL             
KENTUCKY LATE SUNDAY NIGHT INTO EARLY MONDAY MORNING. GIVEN THE TIME            
OF DAY AND ORGANIZATION OF THE STORMS A BIG THREAT WOULD APPEAR TO              
BE STRONG WIND GUSTS. THIS IS BORNE OUT LOOKING AT SOUNDINGS THAT               
REVEAL A SOMEWHAT DRY LAYER IN THE MIDDLE ATMOSPHERE...SUGGESTING               
POSSIBILITY OF STRONG DOWNDRAFTS. INDEED THE MDPI IS FORECAST TO BE             
AROUND 0.7 BY 12Z MONDAY...INDICATING THE POSSIBILITY OF ISOLATED               
DOWNBURSTS. A 50 TO 60 KT LOW LEVEL JET WILL HELP WITH THE STRONG               
WIND POTENTIAL AS WELL. HOWEVER...HAVING SAID ALL THAT...HAIL WILL              
BE POSSIBLE AS WELL WITH WET BULB ZERO HEIGHTS AROUND 9000 TO 10000             
FEET. ENERGY HELICITY INDEX EVEN SUGGESTS AN ISOLATED TORNADO                   
POSSIBLE AROUND DAWN MONDAY MORNING BUT THAT WOULD BE MOST LIKELY               
ONLY IN ANY DISCRETE SUPERCELLS AHEAD OF THE LINE OR NEAR WHERE TWO             
STORMS CAN HAVE A LOCAL INFLUENCE ON EACH OTHER. THE REALLY                     
SIGNIFICANT TORNADO THREAT WILL REMAIN WEST OF OUR CWFA.                        
SO...THE FIRST AREA OF STORMS WEAKENS AND MOVES OFF TO THE EAST                 
MONDAY MORNING. MODELS DO HINT THAT WE COULD SEE SOME BREAKS IN THE             
CLOUDS EARLY MONDAY AFTERNOON...LEADING TO INSOLATION THAT WOULD                
HELP TO RE-DESTABILIZE THE ATMOSPHERE. THEN THE COLD FRONT COMES IN.            
LOOKS LIKE STORMS WILL RE-FIRE IN THE LATE AFTERNOON ON MONDAY ALONG            
THE INTERSTATE 65 CORRIDOR AND MOVE QUICKLY OFF TO THE                          
EAST...DEPARTING THE LMK CWFA AROUND MIDNIGHT. THESE STORMS WILL                
AGAIN HAVE A CHANCE OF BEING SEVERE...SO WE WILL CONTINUE TO WATCH              
HOW THIS SETS UP.                                                               
HEAVY RAIN WILL BE A PROBLEM...ESPECIALLY OVER SECTIONS OF SOUTHERN             
INDIANA AND FAR NORTHERN CENTRAL KENTUCKY WHERE THE GROUND IS                   
ALREADY SATURATED. LOOKS LIKE GENERAL AMOUNTS OF ONE TO 1.3 INCHES              
OF RAIN WILL BE POSSIBLE FROM SUNDAY EVENING TO MONDAY NIGHT ALONG A            
50 MILE WIDE CORRIDOR ALONG THE OHIO RIVER. IN ADDITION...VERY                  
STRONG STORMS AND ANY TRAINING OF STORMS MAY LEAD TO LOCALLY EVEN               
HIGHER AMOUNTS.                                                                 
COLD FRONT CLEARS THE AREA LATE MONDAY NIGHT AND THE AXIS OF THE                
LARGE WESTERN TROF PASSES OVERHEAD TUESDAY. DRY WEATHER TUESDAY AND             
WEDNESDAY.                                                                      
GFS AND ECMWF IN DECENT AGREEMENT BRINGING LOW PRESSURE TO AROUND               
SAINT LOUIS THURSDAY AFTERNOON AND DRAGGING A COLD FRONT ACROSS OUR             
REGION THURSDAY NIGHT. GFS ENSEMBLE MEAN AND GEM ENSEMBLE INDICATE              
PRECIPITATION DURING THAT TIME AS WELL. SO...WILL PUT IN A SMALL                
CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS THURSDAY AFTERNOON AND NIGHT.               
HIGH PRESSURE THEN BUILDS BACK IN FOR FRIDAY AND SATURDAY.

MLCAPE VALUES OF 1500 TO 2500 J/KG. LOOKS TO BE A BIT OF A FORCING

THIS...COVERAGE OF CONVECTION HAS REMAINED ISOLATED THROUGH THE                 
AFTERNOON HOURS...POSSIBLY DUE TO A LITTLE WARMING AROUND 700 MB AS             
SHOWN BY THE RUC. WILL KEEP ISOLATED CONVECTION IN THE FORECAST FOR             
TONIGHT...AND THERE IS STILL THE SMALL POTENTIAL FOR A STRONG OR                
SEVERE STORM THIS EVENING MAINLY IN THE SW SECTIONS WHERE BEST                  
INSTABILITY AND FLOW EXISTS. A VERY ACTIVE OVERNIGHT IS EXPECTED TO

EXPECT THAT MOST OF THIS WILL SLIDE N AND NW OF FORECAST AREA

AGREE ON RELATIVELY STRONG NEGATIVE 850 MB THETA-E ADVECTION OVER               
MOST AREAS AS BEST MOISTURE ADVECTION FOCUSES TO OUR WEST AHEAD OF

CONTINUED MOIST AND UNSTABLE ATMOSPHERE...BUT WILL GENERALLY KEEP               
POPS IN THE 20 PCT RANGE.  WINDS COULD BE A BIT OF A PROBLEM AGAIN              
SUNDAY...AS GFS SHOWS 30-35 KT 925/850 MB FLOW AND GOOD MIXING. WILL

EVENING (00Z-02Z). DUE TO INITIAL DRY LOWLEVEL CONDITIONS AND TRENDS            
SHOWN BY NAM FORECAST SOUNDINGS, EXPECT FLIGHT CONDITIONS TO STILL              
MAINLY BE IN VFR RANGE (6SM -SHRA BR OVC035CB). AS LOW LEVELS BECOME            
MORE MOIST LATE TONIGHT, EXPECT MVFR FLIGHT CONDITIONS TO DEVELOP.              
THE LOWEST CONDITIONS SHOULD OCCUR WITH THE MIDDAY SHOWER BAND AND              
EMBEDDED THUNDERSTORMS (4SM -SHRA BR OVC020CB).                                 
&&                                                                              
.LONG TERM (SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...                                   
MILD WEATHER WITH PERIODS OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL                     
CONTINUE THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT. RAIN WILL BECOME MORE PREVALENT                  
WITH TIME.                                                                      
A STRONG COLD FRONT WILL PUSH THROUGH ON LATE MONDAY NIGHT. THIS                
WILL PROVIDE MORE SEASONAL TEMPERATURES AS NORTHWEST FLOW PULLS                 
COOLER AIR DOWN FROM CANADA. THE NORTHWESTERLY FLOW COULD KICK OFF              
SOME RAIN OR SNOW SHOWERS AS MOISTURE FROM THE LAKE IS ADDED TO                 
THE AIR.                                                                        
ANOTHER SYSTEM WILL MOVE QUICKLY SOUTH OF THE AREA ON THURSDAY.                 
THIS WILL BRING OVERRUNNNING PRECIPITATION TO THE REGION AS IT                  
MOVES BY.

.SHORT TERM...THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT                                             
PRIMARY FOCUS OF THE FORECAST CONTINUES TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH                   
POTENTIAL FOR WINTER STORM ACROSS PARTS OF THE UPPER MISSISSIPPI                
VALLEY SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY.                                                
AT EARLY AFTERNOON...A COLD FRONT EXTENDED FROM THE TWIN CITIES                 
SOUTH THROUGH ROCHESTER MINNESOTA AND WATERLOO IOWA. NO PRECIPITATION           
HAS DEVELOPED ALONG THIS FRONT YET THIS AFTERNOON. MEANWHILE A WARM             
FRONT EXTENDED FROM THE WESTERN TIP OF LAKE SUPERIOR SOUTHEAST TO               
MILWAUKEE. THE RUC SHOWS MOST UNSTABLE CAPES CLIMBING UP TO 1200 J/KG           
AT 20Z ALONG THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER THIS AFTERNOON AND THEN QUICKLY              
MOVES EAST ACROSS WISCONSIN DURING THE REMAINDER OF THE AFTERNOON AND           
EVENING. THESE CAPES ARE POOLING ALONG THE SURFACE COLD FRONT. OTHER            
THAN SOME SCATTERED SHOWERS BETWEEN MOLINE AND DUBUQUE NO OTHER                 
SHOWERS HAVE SHOWED UP IN THE WARM SECTOR OF THIS STORM SYSTEM.                 
OVERALL THE GFS AND NAM WERE POORLY INITIALIZED WITH THEIR 925 MB               
AND 850 MB TEMPERATURES ACROSS THE MID AND UPPER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY.            
TEMPERATURE ERRORS RANGED FROM 2C TO 5C TOO COLD. AS A RESULT...                
THE MODELS WERE TOO COOL WITH THEIR SURFACE HIGHS ACROSS MUCH OF THE            
REGION TODAY. OTHER THAN THESE DISCREPANCIES...THE GFS AND NAM WERE             
WELL INITIALIZED WITH THEIR TEMPERATURE...DEW POINT...AND WIND                  
FIELDS.                                                                         
LATEST UKMET AND ECMWF HAVE BEEN CONSISTENT IN MORE NORTHERLY TRACK             
OF LOW PRESSURE EJECTING OUT OF THE CENTRAL PLAINS INTO THE GREAT               
LAKES SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY. GFS HAS ALSO BEEN CONSISTENTLY                  
CLOSER TO THE TRACK OF THE EUROPEAN MODELS...WHILE NAM CONTINUES                
TO BE AN OUTLIER. IN FACT...FROM 00Z 13MAR06- 00Z 14MAR06...                    
80 PERCENT OF THE GFS ENSEMBLE MEMBERS INDICATED PRECIPITATION                  
AMOUNTS OF UP TO 0.30 INCH OF AN INCH ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA.                 
IN ADDITION...80 PERCENT OF THE GFS ENSEMBLE MEMBERS IN THE                     
AFOREMENTIONED TIME FRAME INDICATED THE 0C 850MB ISOTHERM FROM                  
NEAR KTOB TO KMFI. BASED ON ENSEMBLES...PREFER THE MORE NORTHERN                
TRACK OF THIS SYSTEM...WHICH CONTINUES TO FAVOR AXIS OF HEAVIEST SNOW           
FROM SOUTHWEST MN INTO NORTHERN WI. THEREFORE...CONFIDENCE WAS HIGH             
IN DETAILS OF CURRENT DATA BASE. THUS...EXPECT BULK OF SNOWFALL                 
ASSOCIATED WITH THIS WINTER STORM TO IMPACT THE NORTHERN AND WESTERN            
MOST SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA.                                             
THE GFS...ECMWF...AND GEM MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW THAT A STRONG                 
UPPER LEVEL DISTURBANCE WILL DROP SOUTHWARD INTO THE WESTERN LONG               
WAVE TROUGH TONIGHT...AND THEN EJECT NORTHEASTWARD INTO THE CENTRAL             
PLAINS. THIS RESULTS IN A SHORT WAVE 500 MB RIDGE DEVELOPING ACROSS             
THE UPPER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY AFTER MIDNIGHT TONIGHT. THE OPEN                   
CELLULAR CLOUDS WILL RAPIDLY DISSIPATE LATE THIS AFTERNOON AND                  
EVENING WITH THE LOSS OF DIURNAL HEATING. IN ADDITION...THE                     
SUBSIDENCE ASSOCIATED WITH THE 500 MB RIDGE WILL RESULT IN A BRIEF              
PERIOD OF CLEAR SKIES FROM LATE THIS EVENING THROUGH 3 AM...AND                 
THEN MID AND UPPER LEVEL MOISTURE WILL BEGIN TO MOVE INTO THE AREA.             
SUNDAY...THE GFS CONTINUES TO SHOW THAT THE 850 MB BAROCLINIC ZONES             
WILL QUICKLY TIGHTEN LATE SUNDAY MORNING AND AFTERNOON. THIS                    
FRONTOGENETIC AREA WILL ESTABLISH ITSELF AT START OF THE PERIOD IN              
WEST TO EAST DIRECTION...AND THEN GRADUALLY SHIFT TO A SOUTHWEST TO             
NORTHEAST ORIENTATION AS THE UPPER LEVEL WAVE APPROACHES. IN                    
ADDITION...THE MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW THAT A 50 KNOT 850 MB JET WILL           
BRING ABUNDANT GULF OF MEXICO MOISTURE NORTHWARD INTO THIS BOUNDARY.            
THIS WILL RESULT IN THE LOW LEVELS OF THE ATMOSPHERE QUICKLY                    
SATURATING AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF PRECIPITATION.                                
THE MAIN QUESTION IS HOW MUCH DRY AIR WILL STILL RESIDE ACROSS                  
SOUTHEAST MINNESOTA AT THE ONSET OF THIS PRECIPITATION. IF THE DRY              
AIR CAUSES THE WET BULB TEMPERATURE TO FALL BELOW ZERO ALOFT...THE              
PRECIPITATION WILL START OFF AS SNOW. THE GFS HAS CONTINUED TO SHOW             
THAT THIS WILL LIKELY BE THE CASE...BUT THE ECMWF WHICH HAS BEEN THE            
MOST STABLE WITH THE TRACK OF THE SYSTEM AND THE 850 MB TEMPERATURES            
STILL SHOWS THAT THAT THE 850 MB TEMPERATURES WILL BE WARM ENOUGH FOR           
THE PRECIPITATION TO START OUT AS RAIN AND STAY THAT WAY THROUGH MUCH           
OF THE AFTERNOON. AS WE APPROACH EVENING...THERE SHOULD BE ENOUGH               
VERTICAL VELOCITIES ACROSS DODGE AND WABASHA COUNTIES IN SOUTHEAST              
MINNESOTA FOR THE PRECIPITATION TO CHANGE TO A MIX OF RAIN...SNOW...            
AND SLEET.                                                                      
SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MIDDAY MONDAY...MOST INTENSE PART OF THIS STORM CAN           
BE EXPECTED AT THIS TIME. STRONG AND DEEP LAYERED Q-G CONVERGENCE               
MAXIMIZES BETWEEN 00Z 13MAR06 - 12Z 13MAR06...THEN EXITS BY 18Z                 
MONDAY. INITIAL BURST OF STRONG LOW LEVEL WARM AIR ADVECTION                    
INDICATED TO CONTINUE INTO SUNDAY EVENING...THEN MID LEVEL                      
FRONTOGENETIC BAND BECOMES ESTABLISHED IN A SOUTHWEST-NORTHEAST                 
ORIENTATION FROM KULM...KMSP...KIWD. UPWARD VERTICAL MOTIONS                    
ANTICIPATED TO MAXIMIZE IN THIS SNOW GROWTH REGION...WHICH SHOULD               
PRODUCE HEAVY SNOWFALL POTENTIAL. THEREFORE...STORM TOTAL SNOWFALL              
EXPECTED TO BE HIGHEST IN OUR FORECAST AREA GENERALLY ALONG AND NORTH           
OF A LINE FROM KTOB TO KMDZ.                                                    
STRONG DYNAMICS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS STORM WILL ALSO HAVE TIGHT LOW             
LEVEL BAROCLINIC RIBBON ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA TO WORK WITH. THIS             
RESULTS IN PRECIPITATION TYPE CONCERNS. IN FACT...GFS FORECAST                  
SOUNDINGS SUPPORTED AN ELEVATED WARM LAYER SUNDAY NIGHT FROM                    
SOUTHEAST MN INTO NORTH CENTRAL WI...WHERE 850MB TEMPERATURES REACH             
AROUND 1C. MAXIMUM WET BULB VALUES IN THIS ZONE WERE ALSO AROUND 1C.            
AFTER COLLABORATION WITH SURROUNDING SITES...WE ISSUED A WINTER                 
STORM WATCH FROM SUNDAY NIGHT UNTIL MIDDAY MONDAY FOR ZONES ALONG               
THE NORTHERN AND WESTERN MOST SECTIONS OF OUR FORECAST AREA. THIS               
SHOULD BE WHERE SNOWFALL POTENTIAL HAS THE HIGHEST PROBABILITY FOR              
MEETING WARNING CRITERIA...AS WELL AS WORST TRAVELING PROBLEMS DUE TO           
WINTRY MIX OF PRECIPITATION EXPECTED IN THIS AREA SUNDAY NIGHT.                 
.LONG TERM...WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY                                         
GFS AND ECMWF CONTINUED TO INDICATE AN UPPER LEVEL AND SURFACE WAVE             
TO IMPACT THE UPPER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY AROUND MIDWEEK. WHILE THE                
MODELS HAVE HAD THEIR DIFFERENCES WITH RESPECT TO TIMING AND                    
POSITION...BOTH HAVE BEEN CONSISTENT ENOUGH SUGGESTING A SYSTEM                 
SHOULD IMPACT THE FORECAST AREA. THUS...CONFIDENCE WAS HIGH ENOUGH              
TO NUDGE PRECIPITATION PROBABILITIES UPWARD A BIT. REMAINDER OF THE
