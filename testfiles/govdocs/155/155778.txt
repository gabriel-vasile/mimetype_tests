6.  Bibliographic Data Entry

   A number of our users have developed program6 for automation

of preprint and bibliographic files.  These vi11 be reviewed
and a suitable program adapted for public use.

7.  Time-Oriented Medical Records Support and Other Patient
   Data Base studies

   By the fall of 1972, we hope to review all the work per-
formed to date on tine-oriented medical records in order to
select the optimal file desiga, the data entry foraat, and
retrievable wocabulary for the near term usem.  Our goal will
be to provide the system tools and the systems or applications
programming that will yield generalized programs which can be
used by many different departments in the fledical Center, Ue
have found that impleaenting the system in the Oncology Depart-
ment required some changes froa the programs used for the
Immunology Clinic.  Ue have been impressed by physician
acceptance of the time-oriented medical record.   Please refer
to the user project descriptions for Drs. Pkies and Slilliaa
for additional explanation of the time-oriented medical record
concept.

   Additional patient data base studies will be undertaken
with the follouing goals:

a.

b.

C.

d.

Obtain as such information as possible concerning new
file systems to be supported by IB8 and other aanufac-
turers.  Review the Stanford SPIBBS spstea as to its
applicability.

Honitor carefully the problems encountered at Stanford
ia use of the time-oriented medical records.

Through literature, search, and travel remain well
informed of work being performed elsewhere.

Assign at least one Computer Science department graduate
student (research assistant) to the problem of file
structure design for patient medical records.

   The goal of these studies vi11 be to provide a broad
base of information on file system technology and patient
data base systems that vi11 be used to guide Stanfordas
development and implementation of medical information systems,

C.  Harduare Acusitions
     w---w--     -1a-1

   Rental and purchase funds are included in the FY73
budget for several additional items of hardware.   A discussion
of each itea follows,

1.   Terminals

    Several 2741 terminals will be released and funds will be
used to acquire tvo additional high speed hard copy terminals
and four CBT terminals.  Ye are especially interested in
terminals capable of operating at 1200 baud.  The choice vi11
be limited to standard EBCD, Correspondence Code, and ASA
terminals,  if at all possible.

2,  Public Printer/Plotter

   The availability of a relatively fast printer/plotter
device for general use has been requested by our users.
We have been looking at several electrostatic printers,
as such a device provides extremely fast and flexible
printing and plotting.   Hovever,  electrostatic devices place
a high demand on CPU and channel resources.   A further
review of available plotters vi11 be conducted before a decision
is reached.

3.  PDP- 11 Equipment

   An item is included for purchase of additional core memory
for both the development PDP-11 and the front-end PDP-11.

   Several additional devices (printer/plotter, DEC tape,
voice drum) are to be attached to the front-end PDP-11.
Available core will not be adequate to service these devices.

   The current 8k of core on the development PDP-11 is
minimal for DEC's operating systen.  Purtherrore,  several users
have been unable to perform some operations due to the core
limitation.  An additional 8k is required.

4.  Ampex Disk Drive

   Current 360 disk utilization approaches full capacity.
Addition of a new user pack may be necessary unless significant
savings result from the new file compaction algorithm.


(28)

   The disk configuration is eight on one control unit, eight
ylus spare on the other.  On the first control unit, the eighth
drive serves as a spare since only fifteen disk packs must be
permanently mounted.  If we decide to add an additional user pack
(always permanently mounted), rental of a second spare drive
guarantees better system reliability.

I-
3.   Riscellaneous

   This category includes interfaces and' cabling for the
voice drum and additional acoustic couplers and modems (part-
icularly for 1200 baud terminals).

D.  Listen Softuare
         -w--Y-

   The specific suggestions for system softuate tasks are
derived from four criteria:

1.  The software should be stabilized as soon as possible.

2.  System documentation must be completed.

3.  Additional or improved user services should be aimed
  toward attracting additional income.

4,  all changes in the form of additional features should
  be disallowed and the system frozen by the end of the
   grant year.

   Three major modifications (points 5, 6, and 7) are in
direct conflict with rguirenents one and four.  tiowever, they
dre also the prinarp tasks for achieving requirement three.

1.  System Stabilization and Cleanup

    The effort here vi11 concentrate on the elimination of
known inconsistencies and errors in the system.   Yherever
easily possible, attempts will be made to reduce the size of
the software.

2.   Dot unen ta tion

   A considerable docnseatation effort is planned,   The aims
are to remove incompleteness and redundancies in the current
documentation of the system software.  A general paper should
be written explaining the system design, the general functional
flow, and the interactions of the various components.  Also,
a comprehensive table of contents and a cross index to each
subject category is useful.


(29)

  Cleanup of documentation and the softuare will benefit any
transfer of the system code to another machine and it will
expedit the maintenance of the system by a reduced staff.

3.  Support of Additional Hardware
  We anticipate attaching a number of new peripheral devices
to the system.  A list of possibilities is discussed in Section
C above.

  Additional software will be required in the front-end PDP-11
system for support of the voice drum,
this year's grant),              DEC tape (purchased from
            and a printer/plotter.  Depending upon
the type of printer/plotter selected, we may be able to adapt
manufacturer-supplied software.

  With the installation of the Hemorex 1270 controller,
session-controlling devices (terminals) and graphics devices
are often synonymous.  A few of the planned projects are:

a.

b.

C.

d.

Where necessary, add specialized terminal support. An
exanple is the inclusion of the Correspondence Code
translation table as developed by the Stanford 360/67
facility for the unique features of the IBB Kagnetic Card
Selectric Typewriter terminal (BCST),  The new TBKTEOHIX
terminals (4010), if selected,
ized support.            will require some special-

Add a few terminal control commands, such as SET UPPEB/
UPLOW and SHOW CASE for specifying upper and lover case
options.
or TTY),  Other commands determine the terminal type (ASA
     and suppress or allov transmission of the ACHE

light box characters.

For high-speed displays, incorporate modifications to
the LIST command so that output is suspended every I4
lines.  This allows the user to scan a page of lines and
use BREAK if he is interested in stopping at that point.

Implement page mode output for displays.   A full screen
of data is displayed directly from the user's in-core
array or variables with a single command.  The user may
then modify the contents of the screen and read it back
with another command.  Some of the problems in implemen-
tation of this capability are identical to those discussed
under 'Extended Logon'.


(30)

4.  Additional Satellite Hachine Support

   Satellite machine support will focus on tasks essential for
a smooth transition to SUIiEX and other long range programs
expected to succeed ACHE.  Ia addition, assistance vi11 be pro-
vided to small machine users wishing to connect to the neu small
machine multiplexor.

5.   Batch and OS Services

  The provision for a user batch service seems necessary
for several reasons:

Current methods for submission of user disk-to-tape
jobs and for submission of LISP overnight work are
inadequate and operationally difficult to control.

Our present method for providing routfne printing and
punching services invites some danger to the reliability
of the ACME system.  Occasional long delays produce poor
turn-around time.

A number of jobs now routinely executed fro@ an AC&lB
terminal need not be run interactively.  Scheduling
these jobs for overnight batch frees both the terminal
and the CPU for additional on-line work.

   Recent hardware monitor tests indicate that the CPU
is busy for 90%-95X of available cycles during peak daytime
hours.  Also, there is little free core available during the
same hours.

   Consequently, only a small printing/punching utility
region could be supported during the prime shift.  Bowever,
sufficient core and cycles are available during evening
and overnight shifts to accommodate a limited load of user
batch work.

  Provision for a batch service requires the completion
of these tasks:

a.  An OS-type task which will convert ACfM-type files
   to OS files and the converse.  The design document on
  this feature has been completed.  Both direct access and
  tape data sets vi11 be supported.

b,  Incorporation of the HASP system into the OS supervisor.
  HASP facilities are preferred over conventional OS
  services for both better operational contlcol and for
  its smaller core and disk requirement.


(31)

C.  kevieu of the WYLBUB/EASP interface and its adaptation
  to the ACHE system, if possible.  Otherwise, the
  developaent of a capability to communicate uith the
   HASP in-core reader.

d.  Development of a small library of standard OS
  procedures for routine utility operations (printing,
  punching, etc.)

e.  Adaptation of HASP accounting.  Development of a
  program to merge HASP accounting with time-sharing
  accounting.

6.  PL/ACHE Object nodules

  The ability to save compiled code on a PL/ACHP program
and reload it at a later time has been repeatedly requested,
Unfortunately, we have avoided the subject primarily because
of the lack of a definitive statement as to its impact on the
current design of compiled code.

  Reloading of compiled code saves user setup time. It
also frees CPU cycles now used for recompilation for more
productive purposes.

  Due to the time constraints of the next year and due to
the uncertainties mentioned above, this project is initially
planned as a two man-month study and design specification.
Actual isplenentation plans will be deferred until the level
of effort is known and until the choice of a computer system
is determined.

7.  Extended Logon

  As the ACClE system is currently configured, a user session
can be controlled only by a device routed through the Flenorex
1270.  Beferences to the desirability of expansion to logon
services are to be found throughout this report.

Specifically,  some of the extensions are:

a.  Allow a satellite computer to function as a terminal,
  invoking programs, etc.

b.  Allow our front-end PDP-11 to act as a raster terminal,
  'logging on' users from devices not necessarily
  capable of sending and receiving lengthy transactions
  (such as touch-tone telephones).


02)

C.  Provide a master/slave terminal concept, so that one
  copy of a user program can service multiple requests
  from multiple, geographically separate, users.

d.  Page mode support for CRT's requires extension to the
  'one-line-at-a-tiue' node of operation.

   The precise technique for implementation has not been
determined.  However, a reorganization of high-level
system control functions is absolutely necessary,  Bxpansions
to the GET/PUT and READ/HRITB stateaents of PL/ACHB are a
possibly simple scheme for user commnications,

   We feel that this is the most valuable of all suggestions
for additions to the ACHE system.  The considerable design
effort and its impact upon the total structure of the system
software are more than justifiable.

8.   Miscellaneous

  This category contains a number of small projects, none
of which may produce any signif icant increase in system usage,
but all of which provide gratifying additions to
the current level of service.  Compared to the level of
effort anticipated for implementation of other proposals in
this section, these projects require very minor * anpouer
expenditures.

a.  A method whereby a user may determine his aggregate
  monthly charges from his terminal (SHOU CHARGBS cormand).

b,  Extensions to the Text Editor to allow relocation or
  duplication of lines of text within a data set (HOVE/
  COPP commands).

c.  Addition of the UNPEOTECT command to corplement the
   PROTECT command.  This command is necessary if a
  user vishes to delete or maintain an existing protected
   file.

d.  A technique is needed whereby a user can guarantee
  sufficient disk file space for writing data to his
   data set.  A simple implementation is to provide
  an option wherein the user specifies the nuaber of
  disk blocks required at OPE# time.   The blocks
  are held in reserve for him (assuming they are
  available) until either they are consumed or the file
   is closed.

v.    AD~IIISTRATIBB OBCAPXZATIO1

   Stanford University has an Associate Provost for Computing anl
reports directly to the Provost and Academic vice President.   The
Provost for Computing and heads the operation of three major
facilities:  Campus facility, ACBE facility, and SLAC computing
racility.  The current SCC director, Charles Dickens, has made
a number of organizational and procedural changes during the past
year in an effort to find an optimal organization for Stanford's
system programming efforts.  One finding uas that organizational
rather than functional lines seen to be the most appropriate in
the Stanford setting.  For six months ue had a single systems
group manager for all three facilities - SLAC, Campus, and
ACBE.  Soae benefits of the trial period were the creation of a
better reporting system, cross-fertilization of ideas. and much
more interaction among the systems programmers.   Some of the dis-
advantages were a longer communications chain, travel time between
facilities,  and some loss of control by facility directors.   The
operations managers of the three facilities mere also brought
together in one functional arm of the organieation.   Cross-
facility training among operations was partially completed.
Reporting schemes were unified,  and an exchange of ideas nas
accomplished.  Today, the functional organizations exist for
purposes of communication and coordination.   Pormal lines of
authority, houever, have been returned to individual facility
directors.

   We have had a number of meetings in the past year with the
Hospital Data Processing facility director and his staff.   A new
era of cooperation and communication between Hospital Data
Processing and ACME has arrived.

   The personnel currently on the ACBE payroll, their job func-
tion, and percent of full time equivalents are listed below:

B.  Justification for FY1973 Budget

Fiscal year 1973 will be the final year for the ACME Grant.  The gross
operating costs will be slightly higher than fiscal year 1972, primarily
due to salary increases, some incremental equipment rent and maintenance,
and some additional programming help for users.  The emphasis in this
final year will be one of pulling loose ends together and preparing for a
transition to alternate hardware for research and service computing. In
addition, strong effort will be made to improve the income posture of the
facility so that it can survive in future years without the financial
guarantees provided under the ACME Grant.

The budget for fiscal year 1973 assumes that the staff level achieved
in fiscal year 1972 will be retained.  The facility is currently recruiting
a replacement for Gio Wiederhold who has had primary responsibility for
liaison with users and supervision of the consultants.   Gio Wiederhold
assumed new responsibilities in the Hospital Data Processing Facility in
March, 1972.  ACME continues to pay a fraction of his salary for consulting
on system problems and planning.

An average salary increase of 5% has been included in the budget for fiscal
year 1973.

Equipment rental costs have been budgeted at the current rental rates. The
overall equipment rental budget is slightly higher than fiscal year 1972
due to the installation of Ampex core.  Similarly, the hardware maintenance
budget is up slightly due to acquisition of terminals and aging of interface
hardware built during the past six years,  and maintenance of the small machine
equipment pool acquired over the past 18 months.

Some miscellaneous budget elements include funds for training of staff on
the PDP-10, acquisition of some terminal service on PDP-10's run by other
institutions, and some additional communications costs associated with the
move to multiple speed terminal support made in April, 1972.

Capital equipment requested for the new budget period is as follows:

1) Four CRT terminals
2) Electrostatic Printer/Plotter, or expansion
  of smsLL1 machine equipment pool

u.,600

22,000

3) 8K of core for development PDP-11              5,700
4) 4K of core for production PDP-11               3,300
5) Two 30 character per second typewriter terminals    5,000
6) Acoustic couplers, modems, etc.             1,400

                                 TOTAL       $50,000


(37)

The CRT's and 30 character per second typewriter terminal will replace
IBM 2741 terminals which have been rented by the facility in the past.
The terminals are less expensive and will provide faster output and a
savings of programmer time.  The printer/plotter to be acquired has not
been selected yet.  This item is incorporated in the budget because
graphic support continues to attract more users.  At the present time
the ACME facility has no plotter to support its users.  Three user
groups have plotters attached to ACME and they find the provision of
service to miscellaneous users more than a trivial nuisance.  Provision
of good interactive graphics support on the ACME system will demand
that the facility offer plotting to its users.  Another problem which
we have had is the slow turnaround on print jobs caused by the speed of
our printer and the system degradation caused by use of the printer while
PL/ACME is running.  This latter problem is induced by IBM hardware and
software constraints which cannot be fixed without a very sizable expen-
diture of effort.

The core for the Development PDP-11 and Production PDP-11 systems will
permit use of the DEC Fortran compiler on the development system and
will remove the limitation which has hampered the efforts of several
development groups.  The added core for the production PDP-11 will be
needed only if several additional user devices or services are inter-
faced through the PDP-11.  We have barely enough core to mount the
voice drum at the present time.  We assume that additional special
devices will be needed.

Funds for acoustic couplers modems, etc., will be needed to effectively
use the new terminals from remote locations.  Also, a number of medical
school groups are being moved to space adjacent to but outside of the
current Medical Center buildings.  For such users, telephone service
for terminals is a must.  This requires expansion of the communication
equipment available.  Users pay for their own terminals and acoustic
couplers but the facility helps to respond to their temporary require-
ments or new requirements pending delivery of new equipment.

F.  Income Projection:

A revised rate structure was implemented effective April 16, 1972. In
general, rates for use of ACME were increased by 25% to 30%. Some users
computing bills were doubled as a result of the new increase.  Actual
income for the month ending May 15, 1972 amounted to $31,500. Some users
will reduce their utilization due to the higher rates.   A conservative
estimate of income for fiscal year 1973 is $360,000. This figure does
not include the terminal service fees which cover terminal rent plus
other services to the ACME user community which could not be covered by
the current funding level of the ACME grant.  Some major users of the
current system will be transferring loads to dedicated small computer
systems in the next 12-month period.  One such user is Dr. Stanley
Cohen whose Drug Interaction Program should be running on a dedicated
PDP-11 by early 1973.  Another such user is Dr. Howard Sussman in the
Clinical Laboratory; programs are being written now for use of the
newly acquired Sigma 3 by the Clinical Laboratory.  Both Drs. Cohen
and Sussman will continue to make some use of ACME for data analysis
but the income from these two sources will be much reduced over current
levels.  On the next page you will see a table which shows the monthly
income collected by ACME for the past nine months.  Based upon this
experience and the estimated impact of the higher rates, it is felt
that the $360,000 is a reasonable estimate of next fiscal year's income
from computer service fees.

   VII.  PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS

CORE RESEARCH PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS

Staff

Core research and development projects carried on by the ACME staff during
Fiscal 1972 have already been discussed in previous sections of this report.

Principal Investigator

Joshua Lederberg maintains one account for the purpose of system development
and testing and another as a utility file for demonstration programs-  These
projects, PILOT1 and PILOT2, are listed in Category 6 of the Summary of
Computer Resource Usage.

Users

During portions of Fiscal 1972, two user projects had core research status:
DENDRAL and the Drug Interaction Project.  Since both began to be charged for
their usage during Fiscal 1972, they are listed below as a combination of core
and collaborative research,

CORE AND COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS

Joshua Lederberg, and Carl
Djerassi.
Dept. of Chemistry, Computer

Project Began 1970

       Project: DENDRAL
                Realtime
Chargeable use began May 1971

The DENDRAL project involves collaboration between the Instrumentation Re-
search Laboratory operating under NASA grant NGR-05-020-004, investigators
operating under NIH grant RR 00612-02, and ACME.

The emphasis of the DENDRAL-ACME efforts is computer science, while that of
IRL-ACME endeavors is data acquisition and computer-instrument control.

The DENDRAL project aims at emulating in a computer program the inductive
behavior of the scientist in an important but sharply limited area of science:
organic chemistry.  Most of the work is addressed to the following problem:
given the data of the mass spectrum of an unknown compound, infer a workable
number of plausible solutions, that is,  a small list of candidate molecular
structures.  In order to complete the task, the DENDRAL program then deduces
the mass spectrum predicted by the theory of mass spectrometry for each of
the candidates and selects the most productive hypothesis, i.e., the struc-
ture whose predicted spectrum most closely matches the data.

Core and Collaborative Research Project Descriptions (cont'd.)

The project has designed, engineered, and demonstrated a computer program
that manifests many aspects of human problem solving techniques.  It also
works faster than human intelligence in solving problems chosen from an
appropriately limited domain of types of compounds, as illustrated in the
cited publications.

Some of the essential features of the DENDRAL program include:

Conceptualizing organic chemistry in terms of topological graph
theory, i.e., a general theory of ways of combining atoms.

Embodying this approach in an exhaustive HYPOTHESIS GENERATOR.
This is a program which is capable, in principle, of "imagining"
every conceivable molecular structure.

Organizing the GENERATOR so that it avoids duplication and irrele-
vancy, and moves from structure to structure in an orderly and pre-
dictable way.

The key concept is that induction becomes a process of efficient selection
from the domain of all possible structures. Heuristic search and evalua-
tion are used to implement this "efficient selection."

Most of the ingenuity in the program is devoted to heuristic modifications
of the GENERATOR.  Some of these modifications result in early pruning of
unproductive or implausible branches of the search tree.  Other modifica-
tions require that the program consult the data for cues (pattern analysis)
that can be used by the GENERATOR as a plan for a more effective order of
priorities during hypothesis generation.  The program incorporates a memory
of solved sub-problems that can be consulted to look up a result rather than
compute it over and over again.  The program is aimed at facilitating the
entry of new ideas by the chemist when discrepancies are perceived between
the actual functioning of the program and his expectation of it.

The DENDRAL research effort has continued to develop along several dimen-
sions during Fiscal 1972.  The mass spectra of some previously uninvestiga-
ted compounds were recorded.  The computer program has been extended to
analyze the mass spectra of a more complex class of compounds, using new
kinds of data.  The artificial intelligence work on theory formation and
program generality has also progressed.

Many mass spectra were taken to gather more data for the DENDRAL program.
The analysis of the mass spectra of a variety of functional groups provided
general mass spectrometry rules for the computer program. The spectra of
many estrogenic steroids were taken to elucidate the mass spectrometry of
this class of steroids and to provide data for a problem area new to DEN-
DRAL.

The estrogenic steroid problem is new in several respects:

(1) 3.n working with steroids, the program deals with much more com-
  plex molecules than ever before;
(2) 'the computer program uses element maps from high resolution data
  to resolve ambiguities; and
