MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER

   Adopted:  April 29, 2002	Released: May 8, 2002

By the Commission:


I. INTRODUCTION
1. We have before us the Ad Hoc Coalition’s (“Coalition”)  second Petition for 
Reconsideration.   The Coalition seeks reconsideration of the 218-219 MHz Second Reconsideration 
Order  that denied the Coalition’s first Petition for Reconsideration.   We dismiss the second Petition for 
Reconsideration for the reasons set forth below.
II. BACKGROUND
2. On July 28 and 29, 1994, the Commission conducted an auction in the 218-219 MHz 
Service  (“Auction No. 2”).   The applicable rules at the time included provisions to encourage 
participation by small businesses and minority- and women-owned entities.   Small businesses were 
entitled to pay eighty-percent of their winning bids in installments  while businesses owned by minorities 
and/or women were entitled to a twenty-five percent bidding credit that could be applied to one of the two 
licenses available in each market.   Bidders that were both small businesses and minority- and/or women-
owned entities could use installment financing as well as bidding credits.   
3. At the time our rules were adopted for Auction No. 2, the standard of review applied to 
federal programs designed to enhance opportunities for racial minorities and women was an “intermediate 
scrutiny standard.”   In June 1995, almost a year after the conclusion of Auction No. 2, the U.S. Supreme 
Court decided Adarand Constructors v. Pena, holding that racial classifications are subject to “strict 
scrutiny” and will be found unconstitutional unless “narrowly tailored” and in furtherance of “compelling 
governmental interests.”  
4. On December 5, 1995, the Coalition filed a Petition for Relief that alleged that the 
bidding credits in Auction No. 2 were unconstitutional and sought a twenty-five percent reduction of its 
members’ winning bids to match the bidding credits provided to minority- and women-owned entities.   
At the same time, members of the Coalition sought judicial review as petitioners and intervenors in appeal 
of the Commission’s IVDS Omnibus Order in which the Commission denied a challenge to race- and 
gender-based bidding credits brought by Graceba Total Communications.   The Commission held the 
Petition for Relief in abeyance pending the outcome of this case. 
5. On June 26, 1996, the U.S. Supreme Court decided United States v. Virginia, which held 
that to successfully defend a gender-based program, the government must demonstrate an “exceedingly 
persuasive justification” for the program.  
6. On November 21, 1996, the Commission released the Competitive Bidding Tenth Report 
and Order which modified certain competitive bidding provisions concerning the treatment of small 
businesses, businesses owned by members of minority groups and women, and rural telephone companies 
for the then-planned second IVDS auction, in order to address the legal requirements of the Supreme 
Court’s decisions in Adarand and VMI.   Additionally, in order to avoid undue delay of future auctions in 
other services, the Commission eliminated the race- and gender-based provisions for those auctions and 
instead employed a similar provision for small businesses. 
7. On June 20, 1997, the D.C. Circuit dismissed the Coalition’s challenge to the IVDS 
Omnibus Order, finding that the appeal was not ripe due to the Coalition’s Petition pending before the 
Commission.   Subsequently, on January 9, 1998, the Coalition filed with the Commission a Supplement 
to its Petition for Relief that claimed that: (1) failure to provide the twenty-five percent reduction in the 
license payments amounts to an unconstitutional taking of property without due process of law; and (2) 
finality-related concerns do not bar the retroactive application of Adarand.   The Coalition also expanded 
its requested remedy to include all Auction No. 2 winning bidders who did not receive a 25 percent 
bidding credit. 
8. On May 28, 1998, the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau (“Bureau”) issued the 
Community Teleplay Order, which denied the Coalition’s requests based on its finding that members of 
the Coalition had sufficient opportunity to raise a challenge in a timely manner, but failed to do so.   On 
June 29, 1998, the Coalition filed an Application for Review. 
9. On September 10, 1999, the Commission released the 218-219 MHz Order,  which, 
among other things, dismissed the Coalition’s Application for Review as moot because the 218-219 MHz 
Order eliminated from the Commission’s rules the bidding credit for minority- and women-owned 
businesses.   Thus, all minority- and women-owned businesses lost the bidding credit they had 
previously received in Auction No. 2.   At the same time, to fulfill the Commission’s statutory mandate 
of encouraging participation by small businesses, rural telephone companies, and businesses owned by 
members of minority groups and women, the Commission granted a retroactive twenty-five percent 
bidding credit to the accounts of “every winning bidder in the 1994 auction of what is now the 218-219 
MHz Service that met the small business qualifications for that auction.”   The Commission noted that 
this approach minimized the disruption to entities that have previously received a bidding credit and the 
public,  and that similar bidding credits had been provided to bidders in other services.  The 
Commission also rejected the Coalition’s takings argument.  
10. On December 3, 1999, the Coalition filed its first Petition for Reconsideration (“First 
PFR”) alleging that the remedial bidding credit adopted in the 218-219 MHz Order represented a 
“conversion” of an unconstitutional race- and gender-based preference to a small business preference  
and that the new credit did not resolve its constitutional claims and should be subject to strict scrutiny.   
The Coalition requested that the Commission extend the remedial bidding credit to all Auction No. 2 
bidders regardless of size. 
11. On December 13, 2000, the Commission denied the Coalition’s First PFR in the 218-219 
MHz Second Reconsideration Order.   The Commission rejected the argument that the remedial bidding 
credit was impermissibly motivated  and found that the remedial bidding credit satisfied rational basis 
review  because it was adopted to further Congress’s objective to disseminate licenses among a wide 
variety of applicants.   Finally, the Commission determined that there was no evidence to support the 
allegation, previously raised by Kingdon Hughes (another Petitioner), that the original bidding credits 
inflated the prices paid by auction participants.   The Commission declined to expand the remedial 
bidding credit to all winning bidders in Auction No. 2. 
12. On February 15, 2001, the Bureau exercised its delegated authority and issued a Refund 
Procedures PN explaining the procedures relating to the remedial bidding credit.   The Commission is 
presently processing  the refund requests of all eligible requestors.   
13. On March 9, 2001, the Coalition filed its second Petition for Reconsideration (“Second 
PFR”) seeking reconsideration of the Commission’s 218-219 MHz Second Reconsideration Order.   The 
Coalition, in its Second PFR, argued that the remedial bidding credit was unconstitutional and that the 
price inflation argument (previously raised by Kingdon Hughes in his Petition for Reconsideration of the 
218-219 MHz Order)  was not “wholly speculative.”   The Coalition also raised, for the first time with 
sufficient particularity, the argument that the remedial bidding credit violated the notice and comment 
provisions of the Administrative Procedures Act (“APA”)  because the remedial bidding credit was not 
included in the 218-219 MHz Notice of Proposed Rule Making. 
III. DISCUSSION
14. As we explain below, we dismiss as repetitious the Coalition’s Second PFR with respect 
to the constitutional and price inflation arguments because these arguments were previously the subject of 
reconsideration  and fully considered in the 218-219 MHz Second Reconsideration Order.   We also 
dismiss the Coalition’s untimely APA argument because the Coalition does not plead or otherwise 
establish new facts, changed circumstances, or public interest considerations that would merit review of 
this untimely request for reconsideration.
15. Repetitious Arguments.  The Commission does not grant reconsideration for the 
purpose of allowing a petitioner to reiterate arguments already presented.  This is particularly true, where 
a petitioner advances arguments that the Commission previously considered and rejected in a prior order 
on reconsideration.  If this were not the case, the Commission “would be involved in a never ending 
process of review that would frustrate the Commission's ability to conduct its business in an orderly 
fashion.”   However, the Commission will entertain a petition for reconsideration if it is based on new 
evidence or changed circumstances or if reconsideration is in the public interest.   In this case, a 
comparison of the Coalition’s Second PFR with the Coalition’s First PFR and the Petition of Kingdon 
Hughes establishes that the Coalition’s constitutional and price inflation arguments were previously raised 
and fully addressed in the 218-219 MHz Second Reconsideration Order. 
16.  In its First PFR, the Coalition argued that the remedial bidding credit adopted in the 218-
219 MHz Order represented a “conversion” of an unconstitutional race- and gender-based preference to a 
small business preference.   The Coalition argued that this “conversion” failed to resolve its 
constitutional claims.   Additionally, the Coalition contended that the remedial bidding credit was 
impermissibly motivated, violated Hunt v. Cromartie,  and should be subject to strict scrutiny review.   
The Commission rejected these arguments in the 218-219 MHz Second Reconsideration Order.  The 
Commission explained that the remedial bidding credit was adopted not to remedy the race- and gender-
discrimination that allegedly occurred in 1994.   Rather, the Commission explained that the extent of any 
“remedy” for the alleged race- and gender-discrimination was the elimination of the race and gender-
based bidding credit.  The remedial bidding credit was accorded to small businesses to fulfill the 
Commission's statutory mandate of encouraging participation by small businesses and to make the rules 
consistent with those in other services.  Thus, the Commission resolved a multi-faceted and complex set 
of regulatory issues by leveling the bidding credit upward.   Because the remedial bidding credit was not 
based on race- or gender-classifications, the Commission found that it is not subject to strict scrutiny 
review and satisfied rational basis review.   In its Second PFR, the Coalition reiterated its constitutional 
arguments concerning the remedial bidding credit.   Because these arguments were fully addressed by 
the Commission in a prior order, we dismiss them here as repetitious. 
17. The Coalition also raised, in its Second PFR, an argument previously raised by Kingdon 
Hughes in his Petition for Reconsideration of the 218-219 MHz Order, which asserted that the bidding 
credits inflated the prices paid by licensees.   The Commission rejected this argument as wholly 
speculative in the 218-219 Second Reconsideration Order.   Again, because this argument was 
previously raised by another petitioner, and fully addressed by the Commission in the 218-219 MHz 
Second Reconsideration Order, we dismiss it here as repetitious.  
18. APA Argument.  The Coalition’s APA argument is untimely.  Although the Commission 
did not previously address this argument, it was not originally made with enough particularity in the 
Coalition’s First PFR to merit the Commission’s attention.  The Coalition’s inclusion of this argument in 
its Second PFR does not correct its earlier failure or obviate the fact that the argument is now untimely.
19. The Commission’s rules require that petitioners state with particularity the grounds on 
which reconsideration of a Commission action is sought.   The precedent is clear that the Commission 
“‘need not sift pleadings and documents’ to identify arguments that are not ‘stated with clarity’ by a 
petitioner.  It is the petitioner that has the burden of clarifying its petition before the agency.”    The mere 
mention of a legal concept is insufficient to properly raise an argument for review.  As the Court of 
Appeals for the D.C. Circuit has noted “even where an issue has been ‘raised’ before the Commission, if 
it is done in an incomplete way . . . the Commission has not been afforded a fair opportunity [to pass on 
the issue].”   In the First PFR, the Coalition’s passing reference to the APA in a section devoted to the 
constitutionality of the remedial bidding credit does not meet the standard.   Although the Coalition 
characterized the adoption of the remedial bidding credit as “dubious” under the APA, it did not develop 
any argument or cite any authority.  Indeed, the Coalition did not even specifically claim that the remedial 
bidding credit violated the APA.   Thus, this passing reference in the First PFR did not comport with the 
requirement that the basis for a petition for reconsideration be stated with particularity and, accordingly, 
the issue was not properly raised for our review.   
20. As we have previously noted, “[t]he Communications Act, our rules, and the need for 
administrative orderliness require petitioners to raise issues in a timely manner.”   Accordingly, unless 
the public interest would be served by reconsideration, section 1.429(i) of our rules limits subsequent 
reconsideration to modifications made to the original order on reconsideration.   The 218-219 MHz 
Second Reconsideration Order did not modify the remedial bidding credit.  Thus, a petition for 
reconsideration of the 218-219 MHz Second Reconsideration Order that challenges the remedial bidding 
credit is precluded under section 1.429(i).   This result is particularly appropriate where, as here, the 
Coalition’s Second PFR did not establish that the public interest would be served by review of the 
untimely APA argument.   Accordingly, we dismiss the Coalition’s APA argument. 
IV.      ORDERING CLAUSE
21. For the reasons set forth above, IT IS ORDERED that, pursuant to the authority of 
section 4(i), 257, 303(b), 303(g), 303(h), 303(q), 303(r), 309(j) and 332(a) of the Communications Act of 
1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. §§ 154(i), 257, 303(b), 303(g), 303(h), 303(q), 303(r), 309(j) and 332(a), 
and Section 1.429 of our rules, 47 C.F.R. § 1.429, the Second Petition for Reconsideration filed by the Ad 
Hoc Coalition is DISMISSED.
22. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this Third Order on Reconsideration of the Report and 
Order and Memorandum Opinion and Order is adopted and that a copy of this Third Order on 
Reconsideration of the Report and Order and Memorandum Opinion and Order be sent to the Ad Hoc 
Coalition via certified mail, return-receipt requested.

Celtronix, Interactive, TV-Active, United, and Hale’s requests and is presently processing Zarg’s request.  We note, 
however, that TI and Hispania are ineligible for a refund.  As noted in the Refund Procedures PN, the refunds 
generated by the remedial bidding credit will be paid to the payor of record of the upfront, first and second down 
payments.  Refund Procedures PN, 16 FCC Rcd at 3453.  TI acquired its license from the original licensee and 
payor of record of the upfront, first and second down payment, Dr. Joseph Zavaletta.  Accordingly, because TI was 
not the payor of record of the upfront, first, or second down payments it was not the appropriate entity to apply for 
the refund.  Finally, Hispania failed to make its second down payment and accordingly never became a licensee.  
Having failed to make these payments, Hispania cannot seek a refund based upon such payments.  Hispania Letter 
(undated) (assessing default payments on License Numbers IVM091B, IVM147B, and IVM202B).  We note that 
Hispania is subject to the default payment provisions set forth in section 1.2104(g) of the Commission’s rules.  47

824 F.2d 1205, 1210 n. 8 (D.C. Cir. 1987).  The Coalition’s passing reference to the APA also fails to meet the 
requirement, in the judicial context, that legal arguments be developed to be considered properly raised.  See 
Carducci v. Regan, 714 F.2d 171, 177 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (“We will not resolve [an] issue on the basis of briefing and 
argument of counsel which literally consisted of no more than an assertion of violation of due process rights, with no 
discussion of case law supporting that proposition or of the statutory text and legislative history relevant to the 
central question.”); see also Washington Ass’n. for Television and Children v. FCC, 712 F.2d 677, 681 (D.C. Cir. 
1983) (appellant “never explicitly” made its argument); Alianza Federal de Mercedes v. FCC, 539 F.2d 732, 739 
(D.C. Cir. 1976) (the “gist” of appellant's argument was there, but “nothing was made of it”).
  	First PFR at 5 (“The FCC’s conversion of the race/gender credit to small business credit, aside from its 
dubious lawfulness under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), which requires notice and comment proceedings 
for the adoption of new rules, does not resolve the constitutional issue.”).

  	47 C.F.R. § 1.429(i).
  	Second PFR at 6-7.  Merely because the Coalition asserts an APA challenge does not establish that the 
public interest would be served by reconsideration.  This is particularly true where the Coalition does not explain 
how review of its APA argument would serve the public interest thereby demonstrating that the public interest 
exception to 1.429(i) is met.  See Beehive Telephone Co. v. FCC, 180 F.3d 314, 320 (1999) (noting that the 
Commission did not abuse its discretion in refusing to admit evidence under the “public interest” standard where the 
petitioner “does not even argue that [the] standard is satisfied”), rev’d on other grounds, Entravision Holdings, LLC 
v. FCC, 202 F.3d 311 (2000); see also, Amendment of Section 73.202(b), Table of Allotments, FM Broadcast 
Stations, (Scranton and Surfside Beach, South Carolina), Memorandum Opinion and Order, 4 FCC Rcd 2366
