      <h4>Abstract</h4>
      <p class="epaBodyText">The focus of this project is to reduce worker exposure 
        to pesticides in the greenhouse environment by implementing IPM/biocontrol. 
        Growers in this rapidly expanding industry will be less dependent on pesticide 
        use, thus delaying development of pesticide resistance, and will avoid 
        phytotoxicity problems and physical damage to plants from spray equipment. 
        Consumers of greenhouse-grown products also will face less potential of 
        exposure to pesticides.</p>
      <p class="epaBodyText"> A statewide greenhouse Integrated Pest Management 
        (IPM)/biocontrol program will be initiated in Pennsylvania with emphasis 
        on technology transfer. A core group of growers in western Pennsylvania 
        will receive one on one, hands on training in IPM/biocontrol concepts, 
        selection and deployment of natural enemies, biological information on 
        plant pests and their associated natural enemies, pesticide resistance, 
        scouting, and record keeping. A scouting manual will be prepared that 
        eventually will be used as core material in a greenhouse IPM/biocontrol 
        scout certification program. </p>
      <p class="epaBodyText"> Participating greenhouses will serve as demonstration 
        areas for other growers to observe. Plant Inspectors of the PDA will be 
        trained so they can promote IPM/biocontrol throughout the state, and where 
        possible, staff of Penn State University's Cooperative Extension 
        program will assist in the promotion of IPM/biocontrol.</p>
      <p class="epaBodyText"> As a result of this cooperative effort, we expect 
        to document an increase in the number of greenhouses adopting IPM/biocontrol 
        programs and an overall interest among growers who want to consider adopting 
        some aspect of IPM in their operations. Through monitoring of pesticide 
        application records, we will be able to document reductions in numbers 
        of applications and in the amount of active ingredient applied. </p>
      <h4>Project Title: IPM/Biological Control Program for 
        Greenhouse Production of Vegetables and Ornamental Plants: Education, 
        Training and Technology Transfer to Pennsylvania Greenhouse Operators</h4>
      <p class="epaBodyText">Greenhouse production of ornamental and bedding plants 
        and vegetables has a great need for Integrated Pest Management (IPM) technology. 
        Overall, little work has been done in this rapidly growing area, especially 
        when compared to IPM in fruit and field crops. Horticultural IPM remains 
        in its infancy in large part because of the traditional reliance on pesticides 
        to produce marketable crops and reluctance of many growers to invest time 
        and money in a more complex, alternate approach. The need to produce pest 
        free, aesthetically pleasing plants and the heavy use of chemicals has 
        lead to concerns over worker protection and pesticide residues. With only 
        a small number of pesticides available for use in greenhouses (especially 
        on vegetables), their continued and frequent use can lead to development 
        of resistance, thus compounding problems. The recent formation of the 
        Pennsylvania IPM Program by the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture 
        (PDA) and Penn State University has helped make greenhouse producers more 
        aware of IPM and its benefits, thus providing a more receptive audience 
        for implementation of the concept. </p>
      <p class="epaBodyText"> A research project sponsored by the Pennsylvania 
        Department of Agriculture (PDA) in the early 1990s resulted in the development 
        of an IPM-based biocontrol program for production of poinsettias and greenhouse-grown 
        tomatoes. The participating poinsettia growers controlled whitefly populations 
        by periodic releases of parasitic wasps and marketed plants that were 
        aesthetically pleasing to consumers and in some cases were able to be 
        sold as pesticide-free plants. A similar project was initiated with a 
        greenhouse tomato producer who, prior to participating, was releasing 
        parasites of whiteflies at the beginning of each week and following up 
        with a pesticide application at the end of the week. This grower, who 
        continues to use biocontrol, has decreased his use of pesticides by nearly 
        100%, relies on parasitic wasps for whitefly control, and because of nearly 
        total elimination of pesticides, has been able to utilize bumblebees instead 
        of human labor to pollinate tomato flowers. Use of these bees has enhanced 
        pollination, providing an increase in yields, another economic benefit.</p>
      <p class="epaBodyText"> The IPM/biocontrol program allowed six poinsettia 
        growers and the tomato grower an opportunity to substantially reduce pesticide 
        application (in some cases, by 100%). The six poinsettia growers have 
        formed a greenhouse IPM cooperative and hired a part-time scout so they 
        can continue the biocontrol program. This documents the ability of our 
        programs to fit into the production structure of private industry. </p>
      <p class="epaBodyText"> Since PDA's sponsorship of the IPM/biocontrol 
        program ended, the need for continued technology transfer of the program 
        has been apparent. Several growers in western Pennsylvania are very interested 
        in adopting this technology, but a lack of trained scouts and lack of 
        an agency (and qualified individual) to spearhead such an effort has hindered 
        progress. The failure of most IPM education programs is that the concepts 
        are not carried out beyond the training session. The need for developing 
        a program infrastructure and implementing the initial IPM concepts will 
        result in IPM adoption.</p>
      <p class="epaBodyText"> We propose to use PESP funds to hire Cathy Thomas, 
        the researcher who developed the IPM/biocontrol project sponsored by PDA 
        in the early 1990s, to accomplish the technology transfer to the horticultural 
        industry, beginning with those interested growers in western Pennsylvania. 
        Ms. Thomas will be receiving her Master's Degree from Penn State 
        University in Summer, 1999, and will be available for this work. Her degree 
        work involved IPM/biocontrol research, making her well qualified to coordinate 
        this project. </p>
      <p class="epaBodyText"> In addition to the technology transfer, Ms. Thomas 
        will develop a scouting manual and begin work on a certification program 
        for IPM scouts. She also will serve as a support person for PDA Plant 
        Inspectors who annually visit all greenhouses in the state and will have 
        opportunities to promote IPM/biocontrol to growers.</p>
      <p class="epaBodyText"> The project can be promoted by both PDA field inspection 
        staff and the Cooperative Extension staff of Penn State University, making 
        IPM adoption a cooperative effort by both agencies. Such an initiative 
        will allow for both groups to continue their efforts to make the agricultural 
        community aware of IPM and to facilitate adoption of this technology. 
        Additional benefits include development of a scouting manual, a certification 
        program for IPM scouts, development of new IPM techniques, and the potential 
        for eventual expansion of this work to include similar objectives for 
        nursery-grown ornamentals and Christmas trees. Program deliverables will 
        represent transferable technologies that could easily be expanded statewide 
        and to other states as well.</p>
      <h4>Objectives</h4>
      <ol>
        <li class="epaBodyText">Hire a person with experience in greenhouse IPM/biocontrol 
          to respond to growers requests for education, training and the technology 
          transfer necessary for them to adopt and implement an IPM/biological 
          control program in their greenhouses.</li>
        <li class="epaBodyText"> Conduct meetings with growers to determine level 
          of interest in IPM and make arrangements to enroll them in a trial program.</li>
        <li class="epaBodyText"> Conduct the technology transfer and train growers 
          in the use of IPM/biocontrol for use on poinsettias and/or tomatoes 
          in greenhouses.</li>
        <li class="epaBodyText"> Work with PDA Plant Inspection staff, either 
          in the field or in training sessions, to expose them to IPM/biocontrol 
          tactics so they can promote and explain the concept to other interested 
          growers and therefore create opportunities for additional technology 
          transfer.</li>
        <li class="epaBodyText"> Work with Penn State Cooperative Extension staff 
          to incorporate new IPM concepts into the program. </li>
      </ol>
      <h4>Justification for Objective</h4>
      <ol>
        <li class="epaBodyText"> A critical part of this proposal is a person 
          with expertise in greenhouse biocontrol programs. We have such a person 
          in mind, one who basically did virtually all the hands on work associated 
          with a project that the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture funded 
          from 1989-1992. This person worked with about a half dozen growers most 
          of whom produced ornamentals and one who grew tomatoes. She introduced 
          them to the concept of IPM/biocontrol, acquainted them with the parasite 
          used, demonstrated and conducted the actual weekly scouting, evaluated 
          quality of parasites the growers received, and made recommendations 
          as to when any chemical controls were necessary. In addition, she also 
          kept records on pest thresholds and pesticide use and provided information 
          to growers the economic benefits of reduced pesticide usage during the 
          project. </li>
        <li class="epaBodyText"> The next critical step is expanding this project 
          from a small group of greenhouses to a statewide program embraced by 
          the industry. We feel this can be accomplished rather easily with one 
          group of about six growers in the Pittsburgh area, who have expressed 
          interest in the technology transfer but have no one to develop the program. 
          We will target this area as the primary one for development of the program. 
          These six growers have already learned of the success of the previous 
          biocontrol work that PDA funded in Lancaster and Lebanon counties in 
          the eastern part of the state, where implementation of the biocontrol 
          work resulted in the formation of a private greenhouse IPM cooperative.<br />
          After the project is initiated in the Pittsburgh area, non-participating 
          growers can be invited to observe the biocontrol work as a demonstration 
          project, thus giving them an educational opportunity to talk with the 
          growers involved. If the participating growers are supportive of the 
          project, we feel that this will make it easy to promote to growers in 
        other areas of the state.</li>
        <li class="epaBodyText"> Training of growers will be accomplished through 
          initial educational sessions followed by intensive one-on-one, hands 
          on type training in the greenhouse setting. Growers will be educated/trained 
          on scouting techniques, pest and parasite biology, release of parasites, 
          population assessment of both parasitized and non-parasitized whiteflies, 
          determining economic thresholds for problem pests, and record keeping. 
          A resource person can guide a grower through times of indecision and 
          unforeseen problems, and as growers gain confidence, they will become 
          more independent. This person also can train greenhouse employees to 
          assist with the scouting. Preparation of a greenhouse scouting manual 
          will be one of the benefits resulting from the hands on approach by 
          the principal investigator.</li>
        <li class="epaBodyText"> PDA has a staff of 18 people trained in plant 
          inspection who also will promote this project to other growers. The 
          inspectors' duties include visiting all state greenhouses annually 
          to inspect and examine plant material and to identify pest problems. 
          Information gained from the project and passed on to the Plant Inspectors 
          can assist them in promoting the program and educating non-participating 
          growers in the advantages of biocontrol.</li>
        <li class="epaBodyText"> This project represents an opportunity not only 
          to educate growers but also to make Cooperative Extension staff aware 
          of the project and its benefits. Local Extension staff will be invited 
          to training sessions to familiarize them with the goals of the project. 
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h4>Literature Review</h4>
      <p class="epaBodyText">The use of biological control in greenhouses was 
        triggered by epidemic populations of whiteflies in spite of heavy pesticide 
        use. Biological control is predicted to increase due to the high selective 
        pressure that exists in greenhouses from limited pesticide availability 
        (Van Lenteren and Woets1988, Dittrich et al. 1990). </p>
      <p class="epaBodyText"> The natural enemy-pest interaction (Hussey and Scopes 
        1985) of the greenhouse whitefly, Trialeurodes vaporarium (Westwood) and 
        its parasitoid Encarsia formosa (Gahan) has been used successfully in 
        Europe (van Lenteren and Woets 1988, Tittanen and Markkula 1989), and 
        reports in the United States indicate various degrees of success (Parella 
        et al. 1991, Lindquist 1989, Harbaugh and Mattson 1976). With the loss 
        of certain insecticides, progressive Pennsylvania growers became interested 
        in utilizing biological control, and a three year research study was initiated 
        in 1989 with funds from the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture, Research 
        Grant ME 449222 and 449260, and the Pennsylvania Vegetable Growers Association. 
        The research was designed to evaluate integrated pest management techniques 
        using natural enemies.</p>
      <p class="epaBodyText"> Seven growers participated in this IPM study, and 
        six were able to reduce pesticide applications. Five growers reduced pesticide 
        usage by more than 50%, three were able to eliminate all pesticide applications 
        by using only biological controls. One grower documented the elimination 
        of 47 pesticide applications in a six month period. The growers involved 
        in this project felt that the costs of using biocontrol were comparable 
        to synthetic insecticides and offered the added benefits of increased 
        worker safety and pesticide free fruit (Michael 1991). </p>
      <h4>Approach and Methods</h4>
      <p class="epaBodyText">The methods for this type of work already have been 
        developed. A horticultural IPM specialist works closely with growers and 
        introduces them to the concept of IPM/biocontrol. Pest recognition and 
        biology, scouting, record keeping, pesticide usage, resistance, etc. are 
        all topics the specialist discusses with the grower, who learns how to 
        scout. Parasites are released weekly in an effort to keep whitefly numbers 
        below a threshold. Pesticide intervention may be necessary if whitefly 
        numbers increase, but where possible, insect growth regulators, which 
        are non-toxic to beneficials, are emphasized. IPM/biocontrol is radically 
        different from adopting a preventive program based on pesticide applications, 
        and grower education becomes extremely important. </p>
      <p class="epaBodyText"> The approach will center around the Pittsburgh based 
        growers because of their interest in establishing a greenhouse IPM cooperative. 
        Because of the short-term nature of this project, we feel that the person 
        we hire can train and work with growers individually and as a group so 
        that a biocontrol program can be established. Our long term goal is to 
        have greenhouse IPM/biocontrol adopted as a statewide program. The success 
        of the biocontrol work in Lancaster and Lebanon counties has sparked interest 
        in the Pittsburgh area, and we feel that once growers know that a person 
        is available to assist them in establishing such a program that much interest 
        will be generated.</p>
      <p class="epaBodyText"> Once the project has been completed, we feel the 
        demand will still be there. As a result, PDA would like to then hire this 
        person and make this program available on a permanent basis for growers. 
        PDA would supply the resource person and support from our Plant Inspectors 
        to assist growers in adopting this new technology. Since the project also 
        involves working on a scouting manual, we feel that as scouts become available, 
        our resource person can move on to assisting other groups of growers with 
        the technology transfer. We also would hope that IPM concepts can be further 
        developed and made available to nurserymen and Christmas tree growers.

      <h4>Impact Assessment</h4>
      <p class="epaBodyText"> The number of insect species found in greenhouses 
        in Pennsylvania is small; however, most of them are major pests. Historically, 
        greenhouse operators have relied heavily on pesticides to solve pest problems. 
        Weekly or more frequent applications are not uncommon where whiteflies 
        occur, especially with high dollar value crops such as poinsettia. Growers 
        must maintain records of pesticide applications, and these records will 
        allow documentation of any reduction in pesticide use. </p>
      <p class="epaBodyText"> Less use of insecticides has far reaching effects. 
        Worker safety is a major concern to growers, and a biocontrol program 
        provides a considerably safer environment for workers and growers alike. 
        We can document and compare any worker safety incidents during the biocontrol 
        project with any such previous occurrences. Participating growers also 
        can publicize their use of biologicals for the benefit of customers who 
        walk through sales areas, a prime place where people could be exposed 
        to residues. Growers who produce tomatoes also could initiate public education 
        efforts on biocontrol. These initiatives, although simple to do, would 
        challenge us on how to document their effects; our principal investigator 
        will develop a survey form that could be placed in the participating greenhouses.</p>
