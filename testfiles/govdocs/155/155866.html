<FONT SIZE=3><P>Because of the diverse coverage of some of the databases, any 
grouping of the databases is somewhat arbitrary. However, an attempt was made to arrange 
the abstracts in groups that reflect the interests of potential users. Within each group, 
closely related databases are placed together, and databases with the broadest taxonomic and 
geographic coverage are listed first. Also, added to some of the groupings is 
information on websites and/or contacts for over 25 other related databases for 
which abstracts were not submitted for consideration at the workshop. The databases are placed 
in the following groups: (1) plants, (2) terrestrial vertebrates,
 (3) arthropods, (4) microbial databases with broad coverage, (5) plant pests and disease 
agents, (6) animal diseases, (7) introduced beneficial 
organisms, (8) aquatic organisms, and (9) global and regional databases with broad taxonomic 
coverage.</P>

<P><B><I>Alien Plant Invaders of Natural Areas: Weeds Gone Wild </I></B>is a 
web-based, public education project aimed at informing the general public, natural 
resource managers and others about the serious threat and impact of invasive 
alien (exotic-nonnative) plants to the native flora, fauna, and 
ecosystems in the U.S. The site provides: (1) a comprehensive national listing 
of alien invasive species of natural areas in the U.S. (currently 
around 500 species); (2) a referenced invasive database "USA Weeds&quot" (to be 
posted by the summer of 1999); (3) illustrated fact sheets; (4)background information 
on the problem, including terminology; (5) links to species management experts and 
other people and organizations in the U.S. and worldwide who can provide extra expertise 
and assistance; and (6) invasive species policy, press releases, and selected publications.</P>

<P>The national list of invasive trees, scrubs, woody vines, herbs, and aquatic plants 
includes species that have been identified as serious ecosystem invaders 
by The Nature Conservancy, the U.S. National Park Service, Exotic Pest Plant Councils 
(California, Florida, Tennessee, Pacific Northwest), native plant societies, universities, 
and other people and organizations. The list continues to grow as new plants are 
identified and it is updated as needed.</P>

<P>The USA weeds database includes the following information: genus, species, plant 
type (e.g., herb), family, native range, U.S. distribution, and reference citations for 
each plant listed.</P>

<P>Illustrated fact sheets are written in a consistent format, take a national 
perspective, and provide information on: identification, native range, habitat and 
distribution in the U.S., ecological threat, biology and mechanism of spread, management 
options, links to management experts, and suggested alternative plants. Fact 
sheets are available for 40 plant invaders as of March, 1999, an additional 80 are in 
preparation, and 200 are planned.</P>

<P>Alien Plant Invaders of Natural Areas is a project of the Alien Plant 
Working Group (APWG) which is a subcommittee of the Native Plant Conservation 
Initiative. The project is supported by volunteers from government, nongovernment 
organizations, universities, private firms, and other affiliations. Participation is 
open to anyone interested in helping. Fact sheet authors are needed: please 
contact the chair through the website.</P>

<P><B><I>Pacific Island Ecosystems at Risk</I> (PIER)</B>. 
The project is compiling a database and synthesis of available information on plants 
that are known or potential threats to Pacific island ecosystems, particularly the present and 
former U.S. territories. Master files will be maintained on the websites of the United 
Nations Food and Agriculture Organization’s Global Plant Pest Information System (FAO-GPPIS)
 and the World Conservation Union’s Invasive Species Specialist Group (IUCN-ISSG). This 
will facilitate worldwide access via the Internet, continuous updating, cross-referencing, 
use of computer search functions, links to references on the Web, and interaction with 
Pacific Rim and island collaborators. A loose-leaf manual will be published using the information 
on the website for use by quarantine officers and other field personnel who may not have 
ready access to the Internet. Information being compiled for each plant species 
includes:</P>

<P><B><I>Southwest Exotic Plant Mapping Database</I> (SWEMP)</B>.
 The Colorado Plateau Field Station of the U.S. Geological Survey’s Biological Resources 
Division is developing a database on invasive exotic plants of Arizona and New Mexico 
and adjacent areas of Colorado and Utah using data collected by collaborating 
land managers. The database provides federal, tribal, state, and private land 
managers an important tool for inventorying, monitoring, and sharing data on exotic 
species invasions in the region. </P>

<P>SWEMP utilizes standards for database development and documentation developed by the 
Federal Geographical Data Committee, and is distributed on the World Wide Web using 
conventional file transfer protocol (ftp). Using the new Internet map server, 
database users may generate and query maps of exotic species locations on the 
Internet in the fashion of a geographic information system.</P>

<P><B><I>Connecticut Invasive Plant Database.</I></B>
The Education Subcommittee of the Connecticut Invasive Plant Working Group is compiling a 
database to document websites, videos, brochures, books, and magazine articles on 
invasive species that are directed at the general public. The database, in Microsoft 
Access format, includes information on both aquatic and terrestrial species in the 
New England region. The objective is to develop a clearinghouse for information on 
multimedia educational materials for use by local conservation organizations and other 
interested parties with interests in invasive plants. The Connecticut Invasive 
Plant Working Group includes specialists from academia, government agencies, garden 
clubs, the green industry, and nongovernmental organizations; environmental 
educators, and other individuals concerned with the impacts of invasive 
species on native biodiversity in Connecticut. The mission of the Connecticut 
Invasive Plant Working Group is: to gather and convey information on the 
presence, distribution, ecological impacts, and management of invasive plant 
species; to promote uses of native plants or non-invasive 
ornamental alternatives throughout Connecticut; and to work 
cooperatively with researchers, conservation organizations, government 
agencies, the green industry, and the general public to identify and manage 
invasive species proactively and effectively.</P>

<P><I><B>Witchweed Management Database. </B></I>Witchweed, <B><I>Striga asiatica,</I></B> is an 
introduced parasitic weed capable of substantially reducing yields in corn 
and other grass crops. The species was detected in North Carolina and South Carolina in 
the late 1950s and is listed as a federal and state noxious weed. In cooperation with the 
affected states, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service initiated an effective 
eradication effort that has reduced the infested acreage to approximately 6,600 acres. In 
1995, the USDA delegated responsibility for completion of the project in 
North Carolina to the North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer 
Services (NCDA&CS). Through a cooperative agreement, USDA provides funds to the 
state for survey, control, and regulatory activities. To manage the 
project, NCDA&CS developed a database to track the progress of the eradication effort on 
the infested fields. The database includes information on survey, treatment, 
field status, and regulatory components.</P>

<P><I><B>North American Breeding Bird Survey</B></I>. The North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) database 
contains data from roadside surveys for more than 500 species of birds, of which 
approximately 250 to 300 species are considered to be well sampled. The BBS monitors the 
status and trends in bird populations using approximately 4,000 randomly located 
routes scattered across the continental United States, Canada, and Alaska. Surveys were 
initiated east of the Mississippi River in 1966, in central North America in 1967, across 
the continental U.S. and Canada by 1968, and in Alaska and northern Canada 
in the early 1980s. Surveys are conducted by skilled volunteers able to identify all of the 
breeding birds on the survey route by sight and sound. Each route is 24.5 miles long, and the 
observer conducts 3-minute point counts at 0.5-mile intervals. Routes are surveyed once during 
the breeding season, usually in June, but sometimes earlier in desert regions and in the 
southern states. The BBS database, which is accessible on the Internet, may be used to estimate 
population trends for native and exotic species at various geographic scales including states, 
provinces, physiographic regions, and larger regions. It may also be used to display temporal trends 
and geographic patterns in distribution and relative abundance. For most species of 
breeding birds, the BBS is the only source of data on status and trends at large 
geographic scales. </P>

<P>North American Nonindigenous Arthropod Database (NANIAD). NANIAD is a database in 
Microsoft Access format, on North American nonindigenous insects and arachnids. The database contains infor
mation on more than 2,441 species in two orders of Arachnida (Pseudoscorpiones, Acari) 
and 18 orders of Insecta, within which names of taxa are alphabetically arranged by 
family, genus, and species. The development of NANIAD was initiated as part of a 
project U.S. Congress’ Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) on nonindigenous insects and 
arachnids, for which the final report, "Pathways and Consequences of the 
Introduction of Nonindigenous Insects and Arachnids in the United States" by K. C. Kim 
and A. G. Wheeler was submitted to OTA in 1991. The report examined the current 
status of nonindigenous species of U.S. insects and arachnids, major entry factors and 
pathways, impacts, case studies, and analysis of information gaps. The NANIAD project was 
continued through a grant in 1993 from the National Biological Control
 Institute (NBCI) of USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), and the 
initial development of the database was completed in 1995. Preparation of the database utilized 
an extensive literature search, contributions from 123 taxonomists, various reports, and 
several databases including the USDA Biological Control Documentation Center’s database 
on importation of biological control organisms, the USDA Agricultural Research Service’s 
North American Immigrant Arthropod Database and Western Hemisphere Immigrant 
Arthropod Database. NANIAD includes information on:</P>

<P>A mechanism is needed for continuous integration of new records as they become available from 
publications and taxonomists. The database requires updating to include records of new entries 
and pathways that have accumulated during the last decade. Basic information is currently
 available on a website. However, development of search capabilities is needed to enable 
analysis of patterns of interactions involving points of origin, introduction, and 
establishment of nonindigenous arthropods to support future pest management policies.</P>

<P><B><I>Systematic Entomology Laboratory Databases. </B></I>The Systematic Entomology Laboratory 
of the USDA Agricultural Research Service (ARS) has various databases and expert systems which 
are currently being made available on the Internet and on CD-ROM. The databases 
include (1) species inventories of the holdings of the Smithsonian Institution’s National
 Entomological Collection, (2) catalogs of insects important to 
agriculture, and (3) information on how to identify various insects of agricultural 
importance. Projects for specific insect groups include:</P>

<P><I><B>Diptera—</B></I>The ARS leads an international effort to develop a biosystematic 
database of world Diptera (flies) parts of which are being disseminated as they are 
completed. Currently, this database includes all the family-group names (4,296 records), 
genus-group names (18,000 records), and some species-group names (78,742 records). The final
 database, to be completed by the year 2000, will probably include more than 250,000 records. 
Completed databases include a catalog of the family-group names, the Systematic Database 
of Nearctic Diptera providing basic nomenclatural data for all flies found in North America, 
and the first fascicle of World Diptera covering the Tephritidae (fruit flies). An expert 
system for the identification of fruit flies of importance to agriculture is also complete 
and available on CD-ROM. In addition, the ARS Diptera staff is building an inventory of 
the Diptera in the National Entomological Collection (about 18,000 records are already 
available on the Smithsonian Institution’s website). </P>

<P><I><B>Lepidoptera—</B></I>ARS is developing and maintaining various databases on 
Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths). A large database on world Noctuidae (noctuid moths) 
and its associated bibliography, already published, are continuously updated. Specimen 
label databases for Chionodes (Gelechiidae—gelichiid moths. about 18,000 entries) and 
North American cuculliine and simpistine Noctuidae (30,000 to 40,000 entries) are 
active and growing. Mapping programs are also in use. A&nbsp;pilot project to test
 the feasibility of developing a computerized library of colored photographs of 
lepidopterous larvae (with data on hosts and distribution) has been started with the 
digitizing of about 200 slides. The computerized library archives these valuable p
hotographs so that they are protected from deterioration and yet are easy to reference 
for making taxonomic determinations, for publishing, and for creating prints and CD-ROMs. </P>

<P><B><I>U.S. National Fungus Collections Databases. </B></I>Databases developed at 
the U.S. National Fungus Collections are continuously updated by the Systematic 
Botany and Mycology Laboratory of USDA’s Agricultural Research Service. They provide 
access to information about fungi, primarily those associated with plants of agricultural
importance. The following databases may be selected individually on the website, or 
searched together for information on a particular fungus or host.</P>


<P><I><B>Nomenclature—</B></I>About 32,000 scientific names of fungi have so far been 
reviewed and listed, along with accurate authorities, synonyms, alternate states, 
notes on worldwide distribution, and important literature references. This database 
enables the user to select data from various databases about a particular fungal 
species or host.</P>

<P><I><B>Specimens—</B></I>The database enables the user to access the database of 
fungal specimens in the herbarium of the U.S. National Fungus Collections. This is 
the world’s largest fungal collection, and includes more than one-million specimens 
from around the world. Information associated with these specimens constitutes an 
enormous data resource, especially about plant-associated fungi. All groups of 
importance to agriculture have been completed including the Uredinales (rusts), 
Ustilaginales (smuts), Polyporales (polypores) Deuteromycetes (imperfect fungi), 
and Ascomycetes.</P>

<P><I><B>Host-Fungus Distribution—</B></I>Reports of fungi on vascular plant hosts from 
both inside and outside the U.S. are continuously entered as new publications 
are received. The database includes over 340,000 reports of about 62,000 fungal 
species on 14,500 plant hosts from 408&nbsp;localities throughout the world. A 
reference is cited&nbsp;for each entry and all references are found in the literature 
database listed below.</P>

<P><I><B>Literature—</B></I>The database includes all important references on the 
systematics of fungi of agricultural importance. More than 25,000 references have been 
entered. References may be retrieved by author’s name, scientific names of the 
fungi (genus and species) and hosts (often limited to plant genus name), or 
separately entered keywords. </P>

<P>The newest addition to the databases is an interactive identification system for species 
of <I><B>Tilletia</B></I> (bunt fungi) in the U.S. based primarily on plant host data 
and the characteristics of fungal teliospores. The database includes 
photomicrographs and illustrations of descriptive terminology to aid in 
teliospore identification. For example, the system enables the user to 
distinguish the teliospores of Karnal bunt of wheat from the teliospores of a 
new species of <I><B>Tilletia</B></I> on ryegrass (<I><B>Lolium perenne</B></I>) with 
which Karnal bunt has been confused.</P>

Officers inspect these introduction pathways for pests, pathogens, and federal 
noxious weeds. PIN-309 is a centralized database system that records and tracks 
all quarantine significant pests detected by officers. USDA uses this information 
to support risk assessments, international phytosanitary discussions, port resource 
allocation, local program analysis, customer&nbsp;inquiries, and other 
types of analysis. Upon request, customized reports from PIN-309 are available 
to researchers outside PPQ for analysis regarding movement of certain potentially

<P><I><B>National Agricultural Pest Information System</I> (NAPIS)</B>. NAPIS provides 
plant pest survey data in conjunction with the Cooperative Agricultural 
Pest Survey (CAPS). It describes the results of a wide range of plant pest surveys 
conducted throughout the U.S., and serves as the official U.S. phytosanitary database 
under the standards of International Plant Protection Convention. Emphasis is on 
surveys for exotic pests, pests which may impact export of U.S. agricultural products, 
cooperative program pests, and biological control agents. CAPS projects facilitate 
the collection and management of data on these subjects. </P>

<P>NAPIS data are referenced to a state and county, and each record may have point-location 
referencing. Access to NAPIS has been provided to the State Land Grant University, the 
State Department of Agriculture, and the headquarters for the USDA-APHIS-PPG unit in 
each state and in Puerto Rico. Other USDA agencies also have access to NAPIS. CAPS 
members and other users may access NAPIS via direct dial telephone service or 
the Internet. CAPS members may use NAPIS for managing data on any nonvertebrate 
plant pest, and may enter individual records, summary records, presence/absence data, or 
quantified data. In addition to formatted data, NAPIS contains graphic and textual 
information in a World Wide Web link format.</P>

<P>NAPIS has replaced hard copy publications which formerly reported the results of 
various USDA pest surveys (i.e., the Cooperative Plant Pest Report, the Cooperative 
Economic Insect Report, and the Plant Disease Report). Data previously reported to 
these publications is now entered into NAPIS, which can download data in coded or 
plain-language forms and generate a variety of reports, including specialized 
reports tailored for particular projects or needs. Used with standard geographic 
information system (GIS) software, NAPIS data can also be downloaded to create maps 
and analytical reports.</P>

<P><I><B>Exotic Forest Pest Information System for North America (EFPISNA). </B></I>The database, 
being developed by the USDA Forest Service and maintained by the NSF Center for Integrated 
Pest Management, identifies exotic insects, mites, and pathogenic organisms with potential 
to cause  significant damage to North American forest resources. It contains valuable 
background information on each identified pest and serves as a resource for regulatory 
and forest protection agencies in North America. The database indicates the relative 
importance of each pest based on the ability to maintain a free-living population and to cause 
either economic or environmental damage in its new range. The pest risk assessment model 
developed for this project emphasizes potential for establishment and impact. Information on
 pathways for introduction and means of dispersal is provided in Pest Fact Sheets. The on-line 
database, initially deployed with minimal records in November 1998, should prove useful for 
the assessment and management of introduced pests, wood products and other commodities from 
foreign sources. The number of pest records in the database is expected to increase greatly 
in 1999.</P>

<P>EFPISNA is being developed under the sponsorship of the North American Forest Commission 
and involves, Canada, the U.S., and Mexico. The database will be available in French, 
English, and Spanish.</P>

<P><B><I>Slow-the-Spread Gypsy Moth Database</I>.</B> The database is part of a cooperative 
pilot project of the USDA Forest Service, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, and 
state governments to delay the damage and management costs associated with the spread of 
the exotic gypsy moth to new forest areas. Since its introduction to North America near 
Boston in 1869, the gypsy moth has slowly expanded its range and, in 1998, infested somewhat 
less than one-third of the potentially susceptible U.S. forests. Spread rates have increased 
during the last 30 years and projections indicate that the species could infest most of the 
remaining susceptible forests in the South and Midwest during the next 30 years. The database 
contains monitoring data, collected and reported using standardized procedures, from 
the Slow-the-Spread (STS) pilot project conducted from 1992 to 1998 in portions of 
Michigan, North Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia. STS deploys grids of pheromone 
traps to intensively monitor transition areas where numerous distinct, low-density
 populations have recently become established ahead of the expanding population 
front. Detected populations are treated. Without treatment these populations would 
continue to expand, coalesce, and contribute to increased spread. Analyses using the 
database have shown that the rate of gypsy moth spread could be slowed by at least 60 
percent through comprehensive implementation of these management practices throughout 
the transition area. </P>

<P>The distributed database currently has nodes in four (soon to be five) states. All 
nodes run Oracle-E27 either on Sun SPARC stations or on PCs with Windows NT operating 
systems. The Virginia Gypsy Moth Information Management System in the Department of 
Entomology at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech) maintains 
the master database with approximately 600 megabytes of data stored online, as well as the 
primary STS web server (on a Sun workstation). Web pages are the major means for 
disseminating STS information at all project levels. Their primary functions are to 
introduce the project, distribute survey reports and maps, facilitate access from the 
field to the STS FTP server, provide a repository of historical data, and facilitate 
evaluation and analysis of information. Efforts have been made to have all servers present 
data in an identical or similar format to provide a seamless interface among the 
different servers. As the STS program expands, the distributed design of the database 
and Web server will allow for a seamless expansion of the information system toward 
the goal of an operational, national STS&nbsp;program. </P>

several pest management programs, including the USDA Forest Service’s Appalachian Integrated
 Pest Management (1988 to 1992) and Slow-the-Spread (1993  to present) Programs. The 
database consists of georeferenced data on male moth counts (1980 to 1998) of the gypsy 
moth <I>Lymantria dispar</I> L. and egg mass sampling (1988 to 1991). Data on male
 moth counts can be analyzed on-line to monitor the progression of the population 
front and to suggest areas for placing delimiting grids of traps and for treatment. All 
files are in ASCII format with three columns separated with tabs or 
spaces, and  x y counts, where counts refer to male moth counts in a pheromone 
trap or counts of gypsy moth egg masses in a plot. </P>

years (1981 through 1985). Entry of historical data from the voluminous records of past 
importations and releases resident in the Documentation Center, as well as data on 
current importations and releases, are expected to be accomplished rapidly when database 
reprogramming is completed in 1999. ROBO is still in the process of development on the 
Internet in early 1999. This includes final development and testing of the data entry 
screens, refinement of data search capabilities, and final review of five years 
data (19,706 records) currently included in the database. USDA facilities (Agricultural 
Research Service, Animal and Plant Inspection Service, and Forest Service) and 
their cooperators (including many U.S. universities, state departments of 
agriculture, etc.) will then be able to enter current data and search the database via 
the Internet, allowing the Documentation Center to fill the gaps between 1986 to the 
present and to add data for importations and releases from 1934 to 1980. ROBO provides 
important information for use in efforts to address threats from invasive species, protect
 global biological diversity, and develop U.S. regulations relating to international 
trade involving exotic organisms. </P>

<P><B><I>Nonindigenous Aquatic Species Database</I>.</B>Primarily in response to the introduction 
of the zebra mussel into the Great Lakes, Congress enacted the Nonindigenous Aquatic 
Species Prevention and Control Act of 1990. The major focus of the Act was to set a 
framework to monitor, control, and prevent the introduction of nonindigenous aquatic 
species. A core element of this framework was to create an Information Service to provide 
timely data on the presence and distribution of introduced aquatic species. In 1993, the 
Nonindigenous Aquatic Species Program was established. The program is founded on a 
database containing more than 39,000 geographically referenced accounts of aquatic 
organisms introduced to fresh and marine waters since 1850. More than 1,100 species of 
vertebrates, invertebrates, their diseases and parasites, as well as 
vascular and nonvascular plants are tracked. Nonindigenous coverage includes exotic 
species as well as native organisms introduced outside of their natural range. Staff 
scientists from the U.S. Geological Survey’s Florida-Caribbean Science Center research 
and compile spatial data from a variety of sources including published literature, agency 
reports, monitoring programs, museum accessions, on-line databases, professional 
communications and a website reporting form. The database is composed of fields that 
set a protocol for extracting and referencing data. Records are normalized by geo-referencing 
according to USGS hydrologic unit, which correlates occurrence data to drainage basin. Real 
time Internet access to a portion of the dataset ensures that new records are available
 within 24 hours to the World Wide Web. Website users can perform state or hydrologic
 basin queries, obtain fact sheets and distribution maps, or contact the staff for 
custom reports.</P>

<P><B><I>National Marine and Estuarine Invasions Database</I>. </B>The database focuses on 
marine and estuarine alien species in U.S. waters, including organisms that occur in tidal 
waters of all salinities (i.e., freshwater to full marine salinities). The data-base is 
developed and maintained by the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center (SERC) with the p
rimary goal of describing the patterns and effects of alien species invasions in coastal
 communities at multiple spatial and temporal scales. For each species, the database i
ncludes detailed information about taxonomy, invasion history (e.g., mechanism and date 
of introduction, source region, history of spread, etc.), population biology 
(e.g., life-history characteristics, abundance), community ecology (e.g.,&nbsp;habitat 
utilization, environmental tolerances, interspecific interactions, and ecological effects),
 economic impacts, as well as associated references for each topic area. Although the 
database is used to synthesize available information on a species-by-species basis, it is 
explicitly designed as a research and management tool to test hypotheses about invasion 
patterns and processes. It can be queried to examine patterns and impacts of invasion by 
taxa, region, habitat, date of invasion, mechanism of introduction, source region, etc. The 
database is now complete for Chesapeake Bay and analyses of invasion patterns and effects 
are at various stages of completion. SERC is presently expanding the scope of this database 
to include other coastal sites and regions throughout the U.S. to (1) characterize invasion 
patterns on a national scale and (2) measure spatial variation in the extent and consequences 
of invasions. The database (and resulting analyses) will continue to develop and expand over 
many years, as part of the National Ballast Water Information Clearinghouse, and will provide a 
national informa-tion source on marine and estuarine invasions through SERC’s website.</P>

<P><B><I>Indian River Lagoon Species Inventory</I>. </B>The high biodiversity of the Indian 
River Lagoon (IRL), located on Florida’s central East Coast, is a valuable coastal resource 
which is increasingly impacted by anthropogeneic activities. A taxonomic listing of 
over 2,400 plants and animals, compiled initially by Hilary Swain, provides 
an important basis for disseminating and updating information on the status of IRL’s 
biodiversity. The Smithsonian Marine Station is converting the IRL Species Inventory i
nto an Internet-accessible database, using a format that will allow for updating and 
revising the initial data and for expanding the database to include available 
information on species life history, habitat requirements, ecology, economic importance, 
special status (exotic, threatened, endangered), and geographic range, including 
distribution within the IRL. The expanded database is scheduled to be

<P><I><B>World’s 100 Worst Invasive Species</I>.</B>The World’s 100 Worst Invasive Species 
is a database funded by the total Foundation and making up a part of the Global
 Invasive Species Programme (GISP) "Early Warning" section. This database 
will focus on invasive species that threaten conservation and biodiversity values, 
rather than agricultural, economic or other interests. It is intended to serve as a tool 
for public awareness and education and thus is limited (artificially, but usefully so) 
to 100 species only. Species will be included if they are deemed to be amongst the
 top 100 of those high-risk species (e.g., the brown tree snake being developed by 
the World Conservation Union’s Invasive Species Specialist Group and cooperating
organizations, for elucidation and testing of database design and content for two 
larger-scale regional databases. World’s 100&nbsp;Worst will focus on species that 
threaten conservation and biodiversity, rather than agriculture or other values. The 
database is intended to serve as a tool for public awareness and education, and is t
hus limited to 100 species. Species will be included if they are deemed to be amongst 
the top 100 of those presenting a high global risk to biodiversity; e.g., the brown 
trees snake, a small, nocturnal, generalist predator which has devastated the native 
land birds of Guam, and is easily transported worldwide after self-concealment in 
aircraft undercarriages and packaging. </P>

<P>The system will be structured as a <I><B>Paradox</B></I> database with web-page front end. It

<P><B><I>Integrated Taxonomic Information System</I> (ITIS). </B>ITIS is the first 
comprehensive, standardized reference for the scientific names, as well as synonyms 
and common names, of all the plants and animals of North America and surrounding 
oceans. The goal of ITIS is to create an authoritative, easily accessible, well-documented 
database with scientifically credible integrated information on species names and 
authors, their taxonomic classifi-cation, commonly used synonyms, common names, 
species nativity (native or introduced), and general distribution. The ability to refer to 
an authoritative taxonomic nomenclature or dictionary of accepted biological names is 
a prerequisite to biological data sharing and effective communication about flora 
and fauna. ITIS is a cooperative effort of several U.S. federal agencies
 including the U.S. Geological Survey, Environmental Protection Agency, 
Agricultural Research Service and Natural Resource Conservation Service, National Oceanic 
and Atmospheric Administration, and the National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian 
Institution. Within the past year, Agriculture-Canada has joined the ITIS effort. ITIS is 
also a partner in the global Species 2000 program to index the world’s biological 
diversity. ITIS partner agencies collaborate with taxonomic specialists throughout 
the world who serve as &quot;stewards&quot; to develop, review, and verify the 
reliability and quality of the taxonomic data represented. ITIS data are 
periodically reviewed to ensure current information is being presented. The database 
can be directly accessed from the World Wide Web. </P>

<P><B><I>Invasive Species of Indian Ocean Islands</I>. </B>The database is 
currently being developed to disseminate information about invasive species, and 
specifically those which threaten biodiversity and conservation values. The 
geographical focal area, at least for the first phase of database development, is 
the small islands of the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Small isolated ecosystems are 
particularly vulnerable to invasion by more cosmopolitan species, and as a result, 
suffer huge losses of native biodiversity. The database is part of the "Early Warning" 
section of the Global Invasive Species Programme (GISP); this section aims to put in 
place systems that will either prevent new invasions or provide expertise to control 
or stop invasions detected in their early stages, before too much damage is done. The 
system under development is a <I><B>Paradox</B></I> database with web-page front end. The

<P><B><I>Harmful Nonindigenous Species in Hawaii</I>. </B>The database is a loosely-bound 
collection of databases and electronic information sources containing information 
about alien species which are or could be detrimental to the economy, quality of 
life, and/or natural resources of the state of Hawaii. The U.S. Geological Survey’s 
Biological Resources Division, in cooperation with partner agencies and 
organizations, is developing the database as a component of the Hawaii 
Ecosystems at Risk (HEAR) Project. The purpose of the HEAR database is to 
provide access to information about nonindigenous species to land managers, decision 
makers, and the general public. The individual data sets comprising the database are 
maintained by HEAR as well as federal, state, and private sector organizations. Data 
sets include information such as: detailed harmful nonindigenous species write-ups; 
one-page public education flyers on particular species; permanent-plot/transect-based data 
from protected areas; island- and area-specific distribution and "controllability" data; 
plant pathogen data; herbicide-treated areas (national park data); information on 
alien threats to endangered/ threatened species; and information on other data 
sets relevant to alien species in Hawaii. Most information in the HEAR database currently 
focuses on plants, although some information on vertebrates and invertebrates is 
included. However, any harmful or potentially harmful nonindigenous species is 
eligible for inclusion. The individual data sets comprising the HEAR database codify 
species information based on statewide de facto standard "taxon codes", developed 
by HEAR, which in turn are based on standard nomenclature maintained by 
Bishop Museum (the State Museum of Natural and Cultural History). Using these 
data sets, HEAR has developed a prototype modeling system for predicting the potential 
range of alien species in Hawaii based on species-specific climatic tolerance 
information. HEAR’s goal is to eventually put all HEAR-maintained data on the 
World Wide Web; and much of the HEAR database is already available on-line in 
various formats. More detailed descriptions of all components of the database 
are available through HEAR’s website. </P>

<P><B><I>Illinois Natural History Survey Collections. </I></B>The database provides 
computerized specimen label data from the extensive collections of the Illinois Natural 
History Survey (INHS). It includes data for the entire INHS collections of vascular 
plants, fish, mammals, reptiles and amphibians, mollusks, and crustacea, plus a few 
selected orders of insects. However, some assemblages containing a large number of 
non-indigenous species, mostly within the insects, have not yet been entered. All 
completed databases, except vascular plants, are available on the Internet at the 
INHS homepage under "On-Line INHS Databases." Georeferencing of specimens, at 
whatever level permitted by the label data, is included in some of the insect 
databases. Coordinates associated with specimens are plotted as point locations, place 
names, or county records using unique symbols. These maps are currently served to the 
Internet in a somewhat static form. Interactive mapping using the Internet may soon be
 possible, and will further encourage applications of the data in mapping, modeling, 
and prediction of species occurrence. This system is envisioned for 
all INHS data in the future.</P>

<P>Currently, only the mollusk database indicates whether a species is indigenous or not. 
Other INHS databases could be linked through taxon names to such resources as 
the USDA’s North American Nonindigenous Arthropod Database. This would permit
 coding of species origins, at least at the continental level. Difficulty arises in 
coding species origins when smaller political and geographic units are considered. This 
more specific coding must be accomplished on a state-by-state basis. </P>

<P>INHS, founded in 1858, is the second oldest and largest of the state biological 
surveys in the U.S. INHS maintains major collections of aquatic and terrestrial organisms 
from middle North America, including more than 6 million insect specimens (ninth largest 
collection in North America) and 712,000 fish. As many INHS-supported state and regional surveys of fauna and flora occurred prior to pervasive degradation of natural habitats, the collections have 
exceptional value for documenting geographic and temporal distributions 
of indigenous and nonindigenous taxa. </P>

<P>Illinois is a hub for commerce and transportation. It retains very little 
of its natural habitat, and is especially vulnerable to the establishment and 
spread of non-indigenous, invasive species. The Asian longhorn beetle outbreak in 
suburban Chicago is a startling example of just how fast an invader can become 
problematic. To encourage an integrated approach to the study and management 
of non-indigenous species, a consortium of Illinois natural resource 
agencies recently proposed to state government a new Illinois Exotic
 Species Invasion Management Strategy for fiscal year 2000. The objectives of 
this initiative include (1) identification and assessment of nonindigenous species 
threats in Illinois, (2) development of an educational program for young Illinoians, 
and (3) development and implementation of exclusion and control technologies 
for invasive, non-indigenous species. The INHS database provides essential 
information for implementing the proposed strategy. </P>
