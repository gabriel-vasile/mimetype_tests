<p><strong>Web :</strong> <a href="http://www.gwmfg.com">http://www.gwmfg.com</a><br />
<strong>Company and Product Description :</strong><br />
Manufacturer of sifters used for scalping,grading and fines removal from dry, free-flowing powders.<br />
Gravity flow and In-Line Stainless Steel Sifters primarily for food processing. Primary objective within that market would be bakeries and mix plants.<br />
Among other advantages, our equipment operates with a horizontal gyratory sifting motion that is less hazardous than the more intense centrifugal sifters commonly used for bakeries and mix plants in Europe.<br />
Further, this sifting motion retains material longer, has a slower and more gentle sieving action, and minimizes vertical agitation. These attributes keep the fine material in contact with the screen longer, leading to more accurate separations. Thsi allows finer screens to be used.<br />
Our sifters use multiple sieves stacked one above the other, large amounts of sifting surface with minimumof floor area can be obtained. If multiple separations are required, this sieve arrangement allows the amount of sieve area required for each separation to be accurately allocated according to the requirements of each separation.<br />
Each sifter has aa number of unique construction, maintenance and inspection features as well.<br />

<p><strong>Web :</strong> <a href="http://www.megtec.com">http://www.megtec.com</a><br />
<strong>Company and Product Description :</strong><br />
MEGTEC Systems is a world-leading turnkey supplier of VOC emission control systems and energy recovery systems, for many industrial processes, including the baking industry.<br />
MEGTEC also provides dryer/oxidizer refurbishing, plant and process energy optimization, engineering studies, pilot coating line testing, heat exchanger replacements, and catalyst sales/testing services.<br />
MEGTEC's CLEANSWITCH RTO (Regenerative Thermal Oxidizer)offers reduced energy use and faster installation than conventional designs. The unit is the first RTO to guarantee 99+% standard VOC destruction efficiency without flush chambers. The key is MEGTEC’s patent pending switch valve that gave the unit its name. The valve keeps treated air totally separate from dirty process air. No significant amount of untreated air escapes when flow direction changes. By eliminating the “puff” of untreated air, the CLEANSWITCH RTO eliminates the need for flush chambers.<br />
The CLEANSWITCH oxidizer utilizes an economical modular design that provides exceptional operating economy with thermal efficiencies of up to 97%. Under normal operating conditions, the unit will run in a self-sustaining mode, meaning no additional fuel is required to destroy VOCs and achieve clean air compliance. Optional equipment to further increase the energy efficiency of the process is available including recirculation systems, hot-side bypass and secondary heat recovery.<br />
In addition, MEGTEC supplies catalytic oxidzers, with many installations throughout the industry.<br />

Our stock division produces a wide range of custom products(plain and printed), specializing in high speed die-cutting, central impression flexographic printing, and sheet-fed offset lithography. Our custom division manufactures high quality sheet-fed offset lithography for a variety of commercial, institutional and industrial markets.<br />
Our company is well recognized in the industry for top quality products and customer service. With a recent investment in machinery, we are now even more competive in our industry and especially with our printing capabilities. Our new central impression flexographic press is capable of producing 150 line screen print which is something most companies in our industry cannot do. We also have a new lithographic press to compliment our smaller one in the custom division. SCT uses top quality paperboard for our packaging products while we maintain the option of using a less expensive paperboard substrate for our econo-line of products<br />
We have found that many of the markets we are looking at lack quality paper board packaging products, top-notch printing capabilities and have nearly no customer service, so we will market these advantages as a means of distinguishing ourselves.<br />
