Army, Supply Excellence Award Program</i></b></p>

<p><i>CW5 John O&#146;Mara, Chief, Warrant Officer Proponency
Office, Office of The Quartermaster General</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>CW3 Michael E. Toter of the Logistics Training Department, US
Army Quartermaster Center and School, and myself have just
completed the Chief of Staff, Army, Supply Excellence Award
evaluations for FY98. This was my first year on the program and I
would like to share some thoughts on what I observed during the
evaluations.</p>

<p>As stated by a brigade commander in Hawaii, we have the best
Army in the world, and we are now competing for the best supply
organization in that Army. This makes a lot of sense when you
think about it. Almost all units we evaluated were of the highest
quality. The soldiers and civilians were professional in every
sense of the word. Units were very well prepared and excited to
be a part of this program. All units were winners in one way or
another. Just being selected to represent a major Army command
(MACOM) speaks volumes for the organizations. Our hats are off to
all who competed.</p>

<p>One negative that we noticed on the evaluations was the lack
of the total battalions that played. We may have seen one company
out of a battalion, but in very few instances did we see the
entire battalion compete. Having the entire battalion compete
will build esprit de corps, not only in that organization but
also in others. Word travels very fast electronically these days.
After seeing all the attention a MACOM winner receives, units
were envious. Newspaper articles, television broadcasts and other
media devices spread the word quickly.</p>

<p>We heard this question numerous times: How can I compete? It
starts at the organization level. Make commanders aware that this
award is well worth competing for, as it is. Things begin to
snowball as units ready themselves for evaluations. Once the word
is spread, more and more organizations want to play. This will
certainly make all units who participate more supply conscious.
The end result is it that the entire Army is more supply
conscious.</p>

<p>The end far outweighs the means in the Supply Excellence Award
program. I encourage all organizations, big or small, to
participate. You will certainly not be sorry for the experience.</p>

<p>Contact your MACOM representative or the chief for the Supply
Excellence Award program, CW5 Robert Gowin at the US Army
Quartermaster Center and School, Fort Lee, VA. Phone him at DSN
687-3163 or (804) 734-3163. E-mail to <a

<p><a name="Officer"><b><i>Joint</i></b></a><b><i> Positions in
Total Life Cycle Management</i></b></p>

<p><i>LTC Richard J. Poole, Lieutenant Colonels Assignment
Officer</i></p>

<p>Since taking the lieutenant colonels desk in November 1998, I
have become increasingly aware of the importance of understanding
the total life cycle of an officer and how career decisions which
seem inconsequential at one rank can have major implications at
another. One consideration along the path to success is that of
serving in a joint position. As one of our more senior
Quartermaster Generals said at a recent briefing, &quot;If you
ain&#146;t joint, you ain&#146;t!&quot; This simple quote serves
to drive home the point that the Goldwater-Nichols Reorganization
Act of 1 Jan 87 is here to stay. More importantly, we (as
individual soldiers and as a Quartermaster Branch) need to
understand just what &quot;joint&quot; means and does not mean to
us in career paths.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In looking at an officer&#146;s career path that includes
battalion command, senior service college, brigade command and
the possibility of obtaining general officer (GO) rank, there are
some finite times when a joint opportunity can fit. The first is
immediately after branch qualification as a major. If this does
not work, the next opportunity arises after battalion command and
senior service college. If this is not available, the time is
immediately after brigade command. I lay this out very quickly to
point out the realities of a shortened timeline and the
constraints: you have to fit 10 pounds of career into a 5-pound
bag. </p>

<p>This timeline is also directed toward a career path that is
competitive to the rank of GO because the fact of the &quot;joint
law&quot; is that an officer will not be promoted to the rank of
brigadier general without previously serving in a joint tour.
There are exceptions by waiver, but these are getting ever harder
to obtain.</p>

<p>This career synopsis is not intended to indicate that only
officers on the path to &quot;stars&quot; will serve in joint
positions. Many great opportunities exist at the 05/06 level
throughout the Department of Defense that need competent Army
logisticians. In reality, there are enough joint positions in
order to have a pool of joint-qualified officers from which our
future leaders will emerge. So, what constitutes a joint position
and how do I know if I am joint qualified?</p>

<p>The Under Secretary of Defense approves a joint duty
assignment list (JDAL) of positions that are recognized for
giving joint duty credit. Title 10 mandates the tour length for
these positions, which is normally three years. For GOs, the tour
length is reduced to two years. There are exceptions to the tour
length rules. However, a Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) waiver is
required when an officer leaves before full tour completion. For
more information on exceptions, access the Internet at <a
href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www-perscom.army.mil/opmd/myths.htm  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www-perscom.army.mil/opmd/myths.htm'" tppabs="http://www-perscom.army.mil/opmd/myths.htm">http://www-perscom.army.mil/opmd/myths.htm</a>.</p>

<p>An additional skill identifier (ASI) of 3A is now awarded
officers who have completed a joint duty assignment position and
been awarded FULL tour credit. The 3A ASI will be annotated on
the Officer Record Brief (ORB). PERSCOM&#146;s Joint Management
Branch awards the ASI. The annotation of the 3A ASI on the ORB
replaces joint experience in the remarks section of the ORB. For
those who have received FULL joint credit, double check for the
ASI. If the ASI is not properly annotated, contact your branch
manager.</p>

<p>An additional ASI of 3L is awarded officers who qualify as a
Joint Specialty Officer (JSO) by a central selection board. To be
eligible for selection as a JSO, a Quartermaster officer must
complete Joint Professional Military Education Phases I and II
(JPME I/II) and have fulfilled a FULL joint duty assignment in
sequence. There are exceptions by SECDEF waiver for officers who
have not completed JPME II but have completed two or more full
joint tours. If selected as a JSO, the officer will receive the
ASI 3L and be managed as one of a few 3Ls within the
Quartermaster Branch. </p>

<p>Quartermasters have many quality officers who are serving or
will have the opportunity to serve in joint billets. The process
is nominative and takes about 9 to 12 weeks from the nomination
to the actual Request for Proposal (RFO). If interested in
serving in a joint capacity, let your desires be known early.
There are exciting positions worldwide which require the
strengths of the best the Quartermaster Corps has to offer</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b><i>Questions That Officers Often Ask PERSCOM</i></b></p>

<p><i>MAJ Bob Cheshire, Majors Assignment Branch</i></p>

<p>The following are a few topics that have been of interest to
officers calling into the Quartermaster Branch:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b><i>Regular Army (RA) Oaths</i></b><i> </i></p>

<p>As soon as you pin on your major&#146;s gold oak leaf, make
sure you execute the RA Oath of Office. All officers, regardless
of RA standing at the time of promotion to major, must ensure
they are administered the oath if they want to become or remain
RA officers. The oath is certified on a DA Form 71 (Oath of
Office - Military Personnel), which your command must forward to
the Accessions Branch, PERSCOM. PERSCOM then cuts the orders
which officially appoint officers into the RA. Significantly, <b>officers
who fail to take the RA Oath</b> within the first 30 days of
promotion may be <b>involuntarily accessed as Reserve Component
officers and then mandated to retire at 20 years of service. </b></p>

<p>The Quartermaster Branch is now working with PERSCOM&#146;s
Accessions Branch to validate the RA status of Quartermaster
majors. For any questions about the RA Oath, contact your field
grade technician at the Quartermaster Branch by E-mail at
virgilm@hoffman.army.mil. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b><i>Nominative Assignments</i></b></p>

<p>Some confusion exists about nominative assignments for field
grade officers. A quick review of the nominative process may help
answer some questions. Nominative assignments require the gaining
command&#146;s concurrence before placing an officer into certain
key positions. Examples of nominative assignments include
Inspector General (IG) positions, joint duty assignments,
exchange positions and some major command (MACOM) staff
positions. These positions are representative, but not inclusive,
of the type of positions that are nominative for field grade
officers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nominative Process</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Step 1. The assignment officer receives an assignment
    requirement and then screens possible officers who meet the
    prerequisites and are available for reassignment. Not all
    assignments are created equal. Most nominative assignments
    have prerequisites that specify skills required for the
    position. Specific requirements vary by each position, but
    specifications may include areas such as security clearance
    levels, family considerations (such as no Exceptional Family
    Member Program (EFMP)), military education level (MEL) 4
    completed, branch-qualified, recent troop experience, and/or
    MACOM staff experience to list just a few examples of job
    qualifiers.</p>
    <p>Step 2. The Quartermaster Branch coordinates with the
    candidate officer and nominates him to the gaining command.
    Depending on the proposed duty position, this nomination may
    involve a short biography detailing the officer&#146;s
    qualifications along with a copy of the nominated
    officer&#146;s ORB. It is important to understand that once
    nominated for a position, the officer is no longer considered
    available for other assignments until the nominative process
    has run its course. </p>
    <p>Step 3. Nominations go through a series of checks and
    balances at PERSCOM to ensure equity in the system before
    nominations are released to the gaining command for approval.
    Once approved by PERSCOM&#146;s Distribution Division, the
    nomination is forwarded to the field unit for review. The
    review process at each gaining command varies. For example, a
    nomination for a position in Kuwait may require approval of
    the officer by the Kuwaiti Minister for Foreign Affairs (or a
    similar office). Exchange nominations require acceptance by
    the defense attache and the host country. Conversely, a
    position at the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) may require
    the review of the directorate and division, followed by the
    approval at the Chief of Staff of the Army level. The point:
    each command is unique in its acceptance process and the
    level of review. In each example, the one common thread is
    that the nominative process is time-consuming and may take 6
    to 10 weeks to receive approval of an officer nominated for a
    position. </p>
    <p>Step 4. Upon acceptance of an officer for a position, the
    assignment officer may finally provide assignment
    instructions (cut the RFO) to the officer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Two important points about the nominative process:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The commitment to the nominated position begins when the
        assignment officer nominates an officer. This is a
        commitment to the gaining command that an officer is
        available for the assignment. </li>
    <li>The process is time-consuming, and patience is required.</li>
</ul>

<p>Nominative assignments can be some of the most challenging and
professionally rewarding assignments that the Army offers.
However, much like general troop assignments, nominative
assignments come in every shape and size. Assignments are
dictated by the Army&#146;s needs. Positions in Iceland, Turkey
and Korea are every bit as important and challenging as the jobs
in Hawaii and the Pentagon. As with every assignment out there,
the only bad job is the one done poorly.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b><i>Command and Staff Colleges </i></b></p>

<p>While the &quot;Class of &#145;98&quot; is now entering new
assignments, the incoming class is preparing to take positions in
command and staff colleges (CSCs) around the world. This article
will provide insight into the process for slating officers
selected for resident CSC.</p>

<p>Historically, Quartermaster Branch receives 50(+) seats at CSC
schools each year. The number varies, based on population size of
the year groups in the window of consideration. This seat
allocation includes slots for Air, Navy, and Marine CSCs as well
as foreign staff colleges.</p>

<p>The timing of CSC attendance from point of selection will vary
based on a number of factors. A quick analysis shows that about
60 percent of a given class is made up of officers selected that
year, with 40 percent deferring attendance for reasons such as
branch qualification, US Army Military Academy instructing or
many other professionally important reasons.</p>

<p>CSC slating is made from the combined list of newly selected
officers and the officers selected but deferred from previous
lists. This list is prioritized into one branch-unique order of
merit list (OML). It is important to note that the OML is
established not to exclude officers from CSC attendance, but to
prioritize officers for attendance. All officers selected for
resident CSC attendance will attend a CSC. (Discount the one-time
Department of the Army-directed &quot;constructive credit&quot;
as a one-time Army fix to bring CSC backlog into line.) Slating
factors include time on station (TOS) including DEROS, Year Group
(YG), branch qualification status, below the zone promotion, and
number of times deferred. These factors are assessed in a complex
computer model that provides a baseline OML. This baseline is
adjusted to ensure the branch complies with guidance received
from the Chief of Staff of the Army and PERSCOM&#146;s commanding
general. Each officer is assessed a numerical score, and the
slating process begins with that score.</p>

<p>The officer who is relatively senior in terms of YG, has met
all TOS requirements, needs bachelor quarters, and may have been
deferred once already will be probably be higher on the list than
a recently selected/promoted major who was just selected for CSC
and just arrived at his duty position outside the continental
United States (OCONUS). Between these two extremes is the
remaining population of officers selected for CSC. </p>

<p>As a general rule, the more senior the officer, the higher his
standing on the OML. Likewise, longer time-on-station raises the
overall score and is applicable for the obvious stability factors
(both personal and professional) and the dollars associated with
permanent change of station moves. Officers who have previously
been deferred will be slated ahead of recently selected officers,
when all else is equal. The process is the same with branch
qualification.</p>

<p>After the OML is established, a preliminary slating is
conducted. In some cases officers slated high on the list may be
deferred at their request (or their command&#146;s) based on
branch-qualifying opportunities. Also, officers with unique
language capabilities may jump into a school position to take
advantage of a foreign service school with special language
requirements. (This invariably provides Quartermaster officers an
extra slot versus taking one from a peer). After a series of
prescreens and briefs through the PERSCOM command structure, the
list of slated officers is approved by the director of OPMD and
released to the field.</p>

<p>The premises of the slating process are to put officers into
school consistent with their professional development
requirements and to act in a fiscally responsible manner.
Quartermaster Branch endeavors to meet the professional and
personal needs of each selected officer while adhering to
Department of the Army slating guidance and Army requirements. </p>

Management Branch</i></b></p>

<p><i>LTC C. S. Vakas, Chief, Quartermaster Enlisted Personnel
Management Branch, vakasc@hoffman.army.mil</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our first priority at PERSCOM continues to be taking care of
our fine Quartermaster soldiers and their families. Service to
you is the most important thing that we do in the Quartermaster
Enlisted Personnel Management Branch. Each and every
Quartermaster soldier deserves the best, and the 27 senior </p>

<p>noncommissioned officers (NCOs) and Department of the Army
civilians who work in the branch are committed to providing you
first-class assignment and professional development support.</p>

<p>We are also charged to ensure the proper worldwide
distribution of Quartermaster soldiers, and this leads to some
inevitable challenges as we balance soldier wants with Army
needs. We continue to make about 1,250 assignments every month.
Your input is a vital part of the assignment process. Let us know
what you want and we will always consider you preferences.
Frequently our telephone lines are busy, but we are always
interested in you and will make the time to discuss your
assignment and professional development needs. Please be
persistent and also consider using PERSCOM&#146;s alternative
contact procedures.</p>

<p>Our <i>PERSCOM Online</i> newsletter is a good source of
continuously updated information. We recently established direct
web linkages to and from the Quartermaster Home Page for your
convenience. Also note that you are now able to send E-mail
directly to the specific assignment managers and professional
development NCOs that represent you by clicking on their
underlined names once you enter <i>PERSCOM Online</i>. E-mail is
a great alternative to the telephone. You should receive an
E-mail reply within two normal work days. Please make sure you
include your complete name and social security number. Also
provide your complete E-mail address in the body of your note and
a work telephone number in case we need to call you. </p>

<p>Communication - whether by voice, E-mail or any of several
other methods - is important, particularly as relates to your
next assignment. All of the assignment managers want to fully
consider your preferences. We make assignments six to nine months
into the future. About a year from your normal permanent change
of station, you should begin to communicate with us. Get your
preferences in early so that your assignment manager can best
work on your behalf.</p>

<p>E-mail is not a substitute for the traditional DA Form 4187
(Personnel Action). In many cases, the assignment manager will
require you to follow up an E-mail discussion with a DA Form
4187. This ensures your chain of command fully supports your
requests. </p>

<p><b><i>Promotion Within the Quartermaster Corps: SFC and MSG
Selection Procedures</i></b></p>

<p><i>CPT Bruce E. Cox, Deputy Branch Chief, Quartermaster
Enlisted Personnel Management Branch, Coxb0@hoffman.army.mil</i></p>

<p>Recently, the master sergeant (MSG) selection board was
released, with the Quartermaster Corps getting the best-qualified
noncommissioned officers (NCOs) promoted to their new ranks and
higher levels of responsibility. Questions about this process
often center around the procedures to determine the number of
selections and to evaluate the individual files. I will explain
some of the logic used in determining selection rates and discuss
some items necessary to prepare your file for a selection board.</p>

<p>For many soldiers (myself included until assignment to my
present job at PERSCOM), the promotions process seems to be
derived and operated in a cloudy environment, shortchanging
military occupational specialties (MOSs) and year groups within
MOSs. This is quite far from the truth. Detailed analysis is
completed before each board convenes. The Quartermaster Branch
submits recommendations based on the number of positions that we
predict will be vacant by the next year. In other words, the
branch recommends how many soldiers in each MOS are needed next
year in that particular grade. Selection rates for the ranks of
sergeant first class (SFC) and MSG vary widely from MOS to MOS.
This is not due to selection bias but tied to individual MOS
structure.</p>

<p>Each MOS&#146;s structure is unique, and this structure
represents the proportion of grades to each other within the MOS.
The old standard grade and distribution matrix outlined the
preferred structure for any MOS (based on a mathematical
formula). The implementation of the Change in NCO Structure
(CINCOS) reshaped all MOSs to reflect the proponent-authorized
posture for field units. This is based on assigning the proper
number of privates first class to sergeants (SGTs), the proper
number of SGTs to staff sergeants (SSGs), and so on throughout
the grades.</p>

<p>Because of field requirements, there is grade band variation
within each MOS. For example, each Army unit is authorized a
supply sergeant. However, most units only have one or two supply
clerks. This places the supply sergeant in positions where he
normally supervises a handful of personnel from his MOS. However,
in an Infantry unit, a SSG is usually in charge of numerous skill
level 1 (SL1) soldiers and a number of SGTs of the same MOS.
Therefore, there is a greater number of SL1 soldiers authorized
throughout the Army for an Infantry SSG. This change in the mix
of NCO to SL1 soldiers changes the balance of the MOS and creates
greater promotion opportunity at different levels of rank for
each MOS. This is best illustrated by the charts with this
article. These charts represent two sample MOSs that show
different grade distributions. The bars of the chart represent
the level of authorizations (number of positions in the field for
the MOS by grade):</p>

<blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p><img src="career1.gif" tppabs="http://www.lee.army.mil/quartermaster/bulletin/1998/career1.gif" width="291"
                        height="224"></p>
                    </blockquote>
                </blockquote>
            </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>In the case of this MOS, there are almost as many SSG
positions authorized as there are SGT positions. In this type of
MOS, promotion to SSG will be competitive but provide a solid
opportunity for a SGT to be promoted to SSG. The promotion
progression to SFC in this MOS becomes much more competitive,
however, with fewer authorized SFC positions than authorized SSG
positions. </p>

<p>The second MOS represented by a chart presents a different
structure entirely. For this MOS, authorizations in the field are
notably higher at different ranks. Notice in this MOS that the
authorizations for SSG are much lower than those for SGT. In this
case, progression from SGT to SSG is reserved for the most
competitive soldiers. However, once a soldier makes SSG in this
MOS, his progression to SFC will be easier. This is because there
are nearly as many SFC positions as SSG positions. This creates
an above-average opportunity for SSGs to make SFC during their
career.</p>

<blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p><img src="career2.gif" tppabs="http://www.lee.army.mil/quartermaster/bulletin/1998/career2.gif" width="260"
                        height="198"></p>
                    </blockquote>
                </blockquote>
            </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>As you can see from these two examples in charts, each MOS
varies greatly from grade to grade. However, the structure of
each MOS presents a clear picture of promotion opportunities as
each soldier progresses from one rank to the next. For
Quartermaster MOSs, promotion opportunity through the ranks tends
to balance out across time over the career of each soldier. Most
important on a personal basis is to make yourself as competitive
as possible.</p>

<p>These two charts show the selection rates for Quartermaster
and Chemical soldiers in the grades of SSG and SFC during the
past few years. Although there is some fluctuation within the
MOSs from earlier years, promotion rates have become more stable
and the standing promotion lists that were out for two to three
years have been eliminated. </p>

<p>Chief among a soldier&#146;s responsibility to his career is
to keep personnel records updated. This means developing a
&quot;pack rat&quot; mentality when you receive ANY
administrative data about your military career or civilian
education. Many soldiers call Branch to try to find certificates
that have &quot;dropped&quot; off records. Although PERSCOM does
maintain some records for SSGs and above, we do not usually have
the ability to research and add lost items to your file. The
Enlisted Records and Evaluation Center in Indiana is the official
agency responsible for the maintenance of soldiers&#146; records.
Typically, if some of your administrative data is not on your
microfiche, then there is no immediate record of the action.
There are different steps to research every item that may have
been erroneously omitted from a file and too many to list in this
article. The best defense to counter this occurrence is to
develop a folder for all personnel actions in case proof of
completion of a course, an award presentation, or other actions
disappear from your professional record. </p>

<p>Other important actions include updating your official
photograph. All photographs should now be in the standard,
digitized format. Most facilities have upgraded to the new camera
system and your photos should remain current, especially before a
board. An updated 2A and 2-1 should be included with all updates
entered through the Standard Installation/Division Personnel
System (SIDPERS) and show no pen and ink changes unless
absolutely necessary. A professional-looking file is a good first
impression for members of a promotion board. Conversely, a sloppy
file is sends a signal to the board that the soldier is not
concerned with attention to detail, even in regard to his own
career. </p>

<p>Finally, it is important to mention some file enhancements
that will improve your promotion potential. While there is no
secret job that guarantees soldier promotion to the next rank,
there are jobs that will enhance your file. Jobs such as drill
sergeant, recruiter, and Active Component/Reserve Component
assignments are non-mainstream jobs that can enhance your file.
Many excellent NCOs will miss promotion opportunity because their
files show little diversity. It is critical to do any job to the
best of your ability to be competitive. However, when an NCO
demonstrates the ability to perform well outside of his normal
career field, this displays the adaptability and flexibility of
an NCO and reflects very favorably to the promotion board panel.
These are critical jobs for which the Army gets an enormous
number of volunteers. However, prerequisites are tough, limiting
selection to the very best. After all, the Army wants to put its
best foot forward when selling or teaching the Army philosophy to
new recruits and when assisting partners in the Army National
Guard and US Army Reserve. </p>

<p>In this article two MOSs were used as models. During site
visits by PERSCOM to installations, all MOSs and promotion
potential are discussed. If you have questions about promotions
based on the structure of your MOS, feel free to E-mail me and I
can generally answer your questions. For review of your personal
record, call your Professional Development NCO and for an
assessment based on your professional military file.</p>

<h2 align="center"><a name="OPMS XXI"><b>OPMS XXI</b></a><b> -
Its Impact on Reserve Component Quartermaster Officers</b></h2>

<p>The Army&#146;s Officer Personnel Management System (OPMS) XXI
is the new system that will groom a generation of Reserve
Component (RC) Quartermaster officers. It will prepare them for
senior leadership and decision-making positions at all levels of
the Department of Defense into the year 2025.</p>

<p>With the advent of the Reserve Officer Personnel Management
Act (ROPMA) in October 1996, it quickly became apparent that the
current management system in the RC was inadequate in terms of
developing the &quot;best qualified&quot; Quartermaster officers
who could successfully compete with their Active Component (AC)
counterparts in Army XXI and the Army After Next.</p>

<p>Also, the RC continues to be an essential resource in the
Army&#146;s worldwide missions. For example, as operating tempo
has increased, RC Quartermaster units and individual soldiers
have found themselves activated for duty in Bosnia, Haiti and
Southwest Asia. This trend of the increased mobilization of RC
Quartermaster assets is expected to continue and increase in
scope. Therefore, RC Quartermaster officers must be able to meet
the challenges put before them. OPMS XXI is the vehicle that will
allow RC Quartermaster officers to maximize their abilities and
provide relevant and expanding contributions as leaders in
America&#146;s Army.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Success in the Reserve Component</b></p>

<p>In the past, success in the RC was determined by what control
group the Quartermaster officer was in. Officers assigned to
units or in the Active Guard Reserve (AGR) program were
considered &quot;players,&quot; while those assigned to the
Individual Ready Reserve (IRR) or the Individual Mobilization
Augmentee (IMA) program were not, regardless of the reason they
were in that control group. Many RC Quartermaster officers were
able to complete an entire career, from commissioning to
retirement, in the same command. They accomplished this by
networking their way into positions of increasing responsibility
or by continually switching branches or functional areas to fill
whatever vacancy happened to be available. The end result for
those continually switching branches or functional areas were RC
Quartermaster officers who became &quot;generalists,&quot;
knowing a little about the branches they served, but an expert in
none of them.</p>

<p>To meet the Army&#146;s demand for highly trained specialists
in Army XXI and the Army After Next, OPMS XXI focuses on branch
and functional area requirements as the centerpiece of life cycle
career management. Under the current OPMS, RC Quartermaster
officers were expected to develop and maintain the knowledge and
skills required to perform effectively in many different types of
positions to remain &quot;marketable&quot; - positions within
their basic branch and functional area, plus branch-immaterial
positions. Under OPMS XXI, RC Quartermaster officers are expected
to develop the skills and knowledge necessary to perform
effectively in only two different types of positions - positions
within their branch <i>or</i> functional area, and functional
integrator positions. Where RC Quartermaster officers have served
and how many different specialties they possess will not be as
important as what branch and functional area positions they have
held with demonstrated proficiency. The &quot;best
qualified&quot; officer envisioned in ROPMA (and OPMS XXI) is one
with demonstrated skills in a branch or functional area <i>through</i>
progressive assignments and appropriate professional military
education.</p>

<p>OPMS XXI will reduce assignment turbulence among RC field
grade officers. They will migrate where their specialties are in
the force. Reclassification will be limited. They will have the
opportunity for more repetitive branch or functional area
assignments within their designated specialty in other areas of
the RC. Through repetitive assignments based on their skill and
increased on-the-job experience, these officers will have the
opportunity to develop more in-depth knowledge and expertise
within their branch or functional area.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>What every RC Quartermaster officer should know about OPMS
XXI:</b></p>

<ul>
    <li>Excessive branch or functional area transfers will hurt
        your chances for advancement. You will track in a skill
        and remain in that skill as much as possible to be
        considered &quot;best qualified.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Do not be afraid to accept assignments in another
        component or program, such as IMA. Where you serve will
        not be as important as what assignments you have held.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>You will have the opportunity to be assigned to the IRR
        to complete educational requirements throughout your
        career, such as Combined Logistics Officer Advanced
        Course (CLOAC) and Combined Arms and Services Staff
        School (CAS3). It is not a permanent assignment. This
        will be an accepted and encouraged component of career
        progression. The IRR will be used as a <i>temporary</i>
        &quot;holding cell&quot; for officers who are completing
        non-resident PME, or cannot actively participate in the
        Troop Program Unit (TPU) or IMA programs due to <i>temporary</i>
        conditions. Access to the IRR will be very limited and at
        the discretion of Career Management Officers (CMO). The
        IRR will no longer be a repository for nonparticipants
        who are nonmobilization assets.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>You are encouraged to discuss your assignment preferences
        with your CMO, but understand that the needs of the RC
        come first.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>You are encouraged to seek the advice and guidance of
        senior USAR Quartermaster officers, and provide
        mentorship to US Army Reserve (USAR) Quartermaster
        officers junior to you.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Self-development is just as critical as formal training.
        RC Quartermaster officers in Army XXI and the AAN cannot
        be taught everything they need to know.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Important New Career Management Changes for RC Officers</b></p>

<p>There are several changes for RC Quartermaster officers in the
updated, and soon-to-be-released, Department of the Army Pamphlet
600-3 (Commissioned Officer Development and Career Management).
As noted in the Quartermaster Life Cycle Developmental Model
(Reserve), these changes are as follows:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The CLOAC and CAS3 have been integrated. The new course
        is called the Captains Career Course. AC, and some RC,
        Quartermaster officers attend a 20-week CLOAC,
        immediately followed by six weeks of CAS3. Most RC
        Quartermaster officers, however, will continue to attend
        the courses in the current format until course
        reconfiguration and other details are worked out.You must
        complete Quartermaster Officer Basic Course (MEL 7) by
        the second year (not the third) of service.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>You must complete a degree before promotion to captain.</li>
</ul>

<p align="left"><b>Army </b><a name="Divisions"><b>Divisions</b></a><b>
Created This Century</b></p>

<p>Divisions are relatively new creations in the history of
warfare, according to Dr. Susan Canedy of the US Army Training
and Doctrine Command (TRADOC). France created the first division
in 1794 made up of infantry, cavalry and artillery. The British
led the rest of Europe by adopting its division in 1807.</p>

<p>The United States&#146; first division appeared after the
passage of the National Defense Act of June 1916. Within two
months of America&#146;s entry into World War I, 28,000 soldiers
of the First Expeditionary Division sailed to France. It was
organized on a square structure with two infantry brigades, each
having two regiments of three battalions and a machine gun
company. The division field artillery brigade had two regiments
of 3-inch field guns and one regiment of 6-inch howitzers. An
engineer regiment and a field signal battalion augmented the
combat arms.</p>

<p>After the Great War, the War Department retained the square
with a reduced strength of 22,000. However, during the lean years
between World War I and World War II, the surviving divisions
were fully staffed on paper only.</p>

<p>With technological advances and improved weapons developed in
the 1930s, the US Army examined its division structure. After
limited tests of several designs in service schools in the first
half of 1937, three division designs were tested in the field.
The choices were an unmodernized contemporary division, a
modernized and motorized contemporary division and a new and
improved advanced division. The 2d Division tested them all in
two months of extensive maneuvers around Fort Sam Houston, TX.</p>

<p>The new and improved division won out, became the triangular
division and was activated in 1940. It was much leaner -- about
15,000 strong -- with three regiments of infantry with three
rifle battalions each and no brigade headquarters. A battalion
had three rifle companies and a company had three platoons. There
were also four battalions of 105mm howitzers. A reconnaissance
troop, a signal company, a military police company, an engineer
battalion, a Quartermaster battalion and a medical battalion
provided additional support.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Army Divisions Change Many Times</b></p>

<p>Armored and airborne versions of the triangular division also
fought during World War II. Since then, the American division has
changed three more times: from the triangular division to the
pentomic division of 1957-62, the ROAD (Reorganization Objective
Army Division) of 1964-1984 and the current Army of Excellence.</p>

<p>Only one pentomic division was ever fielded. Its organizations
and tactics were created for a nuclear environment, which would
require small, lethal and self-sustaining units. Success would
depend on high mobility, rapid communications and devastating
combat power. Five battle groups were planned for the infantry
and airmobile divisions. A battle group was larger than a
battalion but smaller than a regiment and could be employed
singly or in combination. The armored pentomic division had
14,617 soldiers while the infantry and airborne divisions had
13,748 and 11,486, respectively.</p>

<p>The pentomic division, while lithe and mobile, lacked depth.
Two new division designs were tested in early 1962. They became
the ROAD divisions, of which five&#151;infantry, armored,
airborne, mechanized and airmobile -- were eventually organized,
each with 15,000 troops.</p>

<p>A ROAD division had a semi-fixed common base that included a
division headquarters, three brigades, division artillery, a
support command, an aviation unit, an engineer battalion, a
signal battalion, a cavalry squadron and a military police
company. Depending upon the type of division and mission, it
could be tailored with other forces to give it flexibility.</p>

<p>By the mid-1970s ROAD divisions were found lacking as the
Warsaw Pact expanded and the Sinai and Syrian battles of 1973
offered glimpses of modern warfare. After considerable study, the
Army of Excellence division was designed and fielded between
1984-86. Major pieces of the Army of Excellence division had been
part of an earlier Division 86 study. The Army of Excellence
heavy division eventually settled at about 18,000 troops in nine
maneuver battalions. Much of the field artillery, air defense
artillery and aviation assets moved to the corps.</p>

<p>The Army of Excellence light division is a three-brigade
organization with nine battalions of infantry containing about
10,800 soldiers. The light division was designed specifically to
respond to contingency missions where early response was
critical.</p>

<p>Development work began on a successor to the Army of
Excellence division in 1994. Though the Army&#146;s new division
for the 21st Century is smaller, its technological enhancements
will make it more agile and lethal. It can also be tailored to
better handle a wide range of missions. General William W.
Hartzog, current TRADOC commander, has said that the only
resemblance that the new division design has to today&#146;s
division is that the organization is still called a division.</p>

<p>The organizational structure of the Army&#146;s newest
division has not remained the same. The units in the organization
are totally different inside, and they do different things with
different equipment for different reasons. Nearly every part of
the division organization for the 21<sup>st</sup> Century has
fewer people. By 2000, the division will have new equipment so
soldiers can operate more efficiently. By 2010, when the division
is outfitted with systems now in the development phase,
capabilities of the organizations will increase dramatically.
