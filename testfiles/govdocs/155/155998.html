			<p><A name="top"></A><b>Chapter 1. Grammar</b></p>
<p><A NAME="1.1."></A><b>1.1. Grammar and Effective Writing</b>
    
</p>
<P>All writing begins with ideas that relate to one another. An
author chooses words that express the ideas and chooses an
arrangement of the words (syntax) that expresses the relationships
between the ideas. Given this arrangement of words into phrases,
clauses, and sentences, the author obeys grammar and punctuation
rules to form a series of sentences that will impart the ideas.</P>

<P>English rules of grammar originated in antiquity, but over
centuries have evolved according to usage and are still changing
today. Thus, grammar rules may change and may be inconsistent, but
usually have a functional basis. This functional attitude toward
grammar, and punctuation, is described in <I>Effective Revenue
Writing 2</I> (Linton 1962). A rule of grammar or punctuation with a
functional basis will not prevent effective statement of ideas, nor
will following all the rules ensure effective writing.</P>

<P>Effective writing requires good syntax, that is, an effective
arrangement of sentence elements. Obviously, an editor is responsible
for ensuring that a consistent and correct set of grammar and
punctuation rules have been applied to a report (a process often
called copy editing). However, language and substantive edits, as
defined by Van Buren and Buehler (1980), involve revision of
sometimes perfectly grammatical sentences to improve effectiveness of
sentence structure. This chapter discusses grammar, and the next
chapter concerns sentence structure with emphasis on methods of
revision.</P>

<P>According to <I>Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary,
grammar</I> means "the study of the classes of words, their
inflections &#91;changes in form to distinguish case, gender, tense,
etc.&#93;, and functions in a sentence." An abundance of good,
detailed grammar, writing, and usage books are available. This
chapter is not meant to be a definitive grammar reference. It is
intended to address grammatical problems often encountered in
technical documents and to indicate preference when grammar
authorities do not agree. Please refer to the books cited in the
References section and others to complement and clarify the
discussions that follow.</P>
<A NAME="1.2."></A><b>1.2. Nouns</b>

<P>Nouns change form to indicate case and number. The number of a
noun is usually not a problem (though the number of pronouns and
verbs corresponding to the noun may be). The three possible cases are
nominative, objective, and possessive. In English, nominative and
objective case nouns have the same form.</P>

<A NAME="1.2.1."></A><b>1.2.1. Possessive Case</b>
<P>At Langley, the preferred rules for forming possessives are as
follows (G.P.O. 1984; and Rowland 1962):</P>

<P>&#149; Form the possessive of a singular or plural noun not ending
in s by adding '<I>s</I>.</P>

<P>&#149; Form the possessive of a singular or plural noun ending in
<I>s</I> by adding an apostrophe only:</P>

   editor's, proofreader's, and typist's tasks</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Some authorities (for example, Skillin et al. 1974; and Bernstein
1981) partially disagree with the second rule above. They state that
the possessive of a singular <I>proper</I> noun is formed by adding
'<I>s</I> even when the noun ends in <I>s</I> (for example, Jones's);
however, a triple sibilant is always avoided (for example,
Jesus').</P>
<P><A NAME="1.2.2."></A><b>1.2.2. Possessive of Inanimate Objects</b></P>
<P>In the past, the possessive case ('<I>s</I>) was not acceptable
for inanimate nouns. Instead the preposition of was preferred, that
is, <I>strength of the laminate</I> rather than <I>laminate's
strength</I>..</P>

<P>Exceptions to this rule were inanimate words representing a
collection of animate beings (for example, company's profits,
university's curriculum) and words expressing measure or time (for
example, 2 hours' work). Current practice is to dispense with both
the '<I>s</I> and the <I>of</I> (Skillin et al. 1974):</P>

<P><B>2</B>&nbsp;<a href="#top">Back to Top</a>

<HR>

&nbsp;
<P>In fact, the use of '<I>s</I> on an inanimate object is no longer
taboo, particularly if the object has some lifelike qualities
(Bernstein 1981):</P>

<A NAME="1.3."></A><b>1.3. Pronouns</b>
<P>All pronouns must have an antecedent (the noun they replace) with
which they agree in number, gender, and person. In addition, some
pronouns change form to indicate nominative, objective, and
possessive case (for example, <I>he</I>, <I>him</I>, <I>his</I>).</P>

<P>&#149; An apostrophe is never used to form possessive case
pronouns.</P>
<P><A NAME="1.3.1."></A><b>1.3.1. Antecedents</b></P>
<P>Most grammatical errors involving pronouns result from the lack of
a clear antecedent. The following sentences suffer from this
problem:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>He foresaw aircraft applications and thus emphasized
   rectilinear motions.<BR>
   <I>This</I> causes complicated integral equations for other types
   of motion.
   
   <P>The boundary condition becomes a source term, <I>which</I>
   permits use of the<BR>
   Green function.&nbsp;</P>
   
   <P>Required surface pressures are obtained in several ways, for
   example,<BR>
   from blade element theory or experimental measurements. Whatever
   the<BR>
   technique, <I>it</I> is usually available.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>In the first two sentences the pronouns <I>this</I> and
<I>which</I> refer to the idea of the previous sentence or clause and
do not have a noun antecedent. The <I>Writer's Guide and Index to
English</I> (Ebbitt and Ebbitt 1978) states that this "broad
reference" usage of pronouns is acceptable in "general" writing, but
should be avoided in "formal" writing. The danger of broad reference
is that the antecedent (whether a noun or a clause) may not be clear.
In the second sentence above, <I>which</I> appears to refer to
<I>term</I>. The following revisions would be preferable:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>He foresaw aircraft applications and thus emphasized
   rectilinear motion.<BR>
   This emphasis causes complicated integral equations for other
   types of<BR>
   motion.&nbsp;
   
   <P>Because the boundary condition becomes a source term, the
   Green<BR>
   function can be used.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>In the third sentence, <I>it</I> is much too distant from its
antecedent, <I>pressures</I>. Because of this distance, the pronoun
does not agree in number with its antecedent.</P>

<P>Bernstein (1981) discusses ambiguous or nonexistent antecedents

<P>&#149; Grammatical errors involving pronoun antecedents can be
avoided very simply: check every pronoun for a clear, appropriate
antecedent and then ensure agreement between antecedent and
pronoun.</P>
<P><A NAME="1.3.2."></A><b>1.3.2. Personal Pronouns</b></P>
<P><B><I>First person pronouns</I></B></P>

<P>Tichy and Fourdrinier (1988) attribute the pervasiveness of
passive voice in technical writing to evasion of first person
pronouns (<I>I</I>, <I>we</I>). In the early 1900's, first person
pronouns were banished from technical writing to obtain objectivity;
however, Tichy and Fourdrinier effectively demonstrate that
objectivity is not always attained. Writing authorities no longer
forbid, and sometimes encourage, the use of first person pronouns
(CBE 1978; AIP 1978; Houp and Pearsall 1984; and Mills and Walter
1978). Thus, <I>we</I> in technical documents cannot be condemned,
particularly when the opinion of the author (and a research staff) is
being expressed:&nbsp;</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>We believe that this effect is due to nozzle aspect
   ratio.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>This use of <I>we</I>, meaning "I and others," should be
distinguished from the editorial <I>we</I>, meaning "you readers and
I" (Ebbitt and Ebbitt 1982). In technical documents the editorial we
is often used in mathematical presentations:</P>

<P>Tichy and Fourdrinier (1988) recommend that the antecedent of
<I>we</I> always be made clear. They also offer advice on when to use
first person pronouns and when not to.</P>

<P><B><I>Gender</I></B></P>

<P>Third person singular pronouns change form to indicate gender
(<I>he</I>, <I>she</I>). When the pronoun could refer to either sex
or when the antecedent's sex is unknown, the masculine pronoun is
grammatical. However, in recent years, objections have been raised to
this grammatical rule.</P>

<P>&#149; It is preferred practice to avoid the masculine pronoun
when the antecedent may be feminine. Often the antecedent can be made
plural:</P>

</B><A NAME="1.4."></A><b>1.4. Verbs</b>
<P>Verbs, the only words that can express action, change form to
indicate person, tense, mood, voice, and number.</P>
<A NAME="1.4.1."></A><b>1.4.1. Tense</b>
<P>Verbs change form to indicate tense, or time that an action or
state of being takes place. English has six tenses: present, present
perfect, past, past perfect, future, and future perfect. Each of the
six tenses has a progressive form indicating a continuing action.
(See Text 4 of <I>Effective Revenue Writing 1</I>, IRS 1962.) Writing
authorities do not specify exactly which tenses should be used in a
technical document, but they universally agree that shifts in tense
should occur only when the time of the action changes. In other
words, the point of view of a report with respect to tense must be
consistent.</P>

<P>The relationship between point of view and verb tense can be
understood in terms of the four elements of discourse (Buehler
1970):</P>

<UL type=disc>
   <LI>Exposition (explains how and why things happen)<BR>
   &nbsp;</LI>
   
   <LI>Narration (tells what happened)<BR>
   &nbsp;</LI>
   
   <LI>Description (gives a mental image)<BR>
   &nbsp;</LI>
   
   <LI>Argumentation (convinces by reasoning)</LI>
</UL>

<P>The elements are quite often mixed. For example, in the Results
and Discussion section, behavior of models or specimens (narration)
might be discussed alang with presentation of results in tables and
figures (description) and explanation of results (exposition).
Narration is usually in past tense while description and exposition
are usually in present tense. Consistency in tense does not mean that
all sentences are in the same tense; it means that sentences
expressing the same point of view (or element of discourse) are in
the same tense. Avoid shifting back and forth between points of view
by grouping material with a consistent viewpoint; but when the
viewpoint does shift, shift the tense accordingly.</P>

<P><B><I>Tenses of independent clauses of report</I></B></P>

<P>There are no firm rules concerning tense of various sections in a
report. However, if an author is inconsistent in tense, the following
guidelines might be helpful to the editor:</P>

<P>&#149; The Summary is usually in past tense.</P>

<P>&#149; Past research (for example, in references) is usually
described in past tense.&nbsp;</P>

<HR>
<P>&#149; Behavior of models, specimens, etc., during the study is

<BLOCKQUOTE>Typical fracture profiles are shown in figure 21. These
   profiles show that fracture mode changed with cyclic exposure. The

<BLOCKQUOTE>The data failed to provide any reasonable estimates for

   attributed to the small excitation of yawing velocity.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>&#149; The Concluding Section is usually in past tense except that
conclusions (that is, deductions thought to be universally true
independent of the specific conditions of the investigation) should
be in present tense.</P>

<P>&#149; The Abstract is usually in present tense.</P>

<P><B><I>Sequence of tenses</I></B></P>

<P>The logical time relation between the various verbs and verbals in
a sentence is expressed by shifts in the tense of these verbs and
verbals. Sequence of tenses is a very complicated subject, which is
discussed in almost every grammar and writing book. Only the basic
guidelines are given here; for a more complete understanding, refer
to such reference books.</P>

<P>&#149; When the principal verb is in a present or future tense,
subordinate verbs may be in any tense:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The data indicate that lift increases with angle of
   attack up to <IMG SRC="/images/alpha2.gif" WIDTH=11 HEIGHT=9 ALIGN=bottom> =
   35&#176;.
   
   <P>The data indicate that the specimen failed in a noncumulative
   mode.</P>
   
   <P>The data indicate that propellers will have a place as a
propulsive device of the future.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>&#149; When the principal verb is in a past tense, the subordinate
verb must be in a past tense unless the subordinate clause expresses
a universal truth or an action that is still continuing:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The data indicated that lift increased with angle of
   attack up to <IMG SRC="/images/alpha2.gif" WIDTH=11 HEIGHT=9 ALIGN=bottom> =
   35&#176;.
   
   <P>Previous studies had indicated that alumina is a suitable fiber
for reinforcement.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>&#149; The present tense forms of verbals refer to action
occurring at the same time as the main verb; the past tense or
perfect tense forms of verbals refer to action occurring before the action of
  the main verb. This
principle is most easily seen for participles:</P>

<A NAME="1.4.2."></A><b>1.4.2. Mood</b>
<P>The three moods in English are indicative, imperative, and
subjunctive. Almost all verbs in technical documents are indicative.
Imperative mood is sometimes used in instructions or descriptions of
procedures. Subjunctive mood is rarely used and seems to be
disappearing from English usage. However, there are two situations
when the subjunctive should be used (Bernstein 1981):</P>

<P>&#149; Subjunctive mood is used to indicate a command, suggestion,
recommendation, or requirement:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The console operator instructed that the preflight
   inspection <I>be repeated</I>.
   
   <P>The committee recommends that this research <I>be
   continued</I>.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>&#149; Subjunctive mood is used to indicate a condition contrary
to fact or highly improbable:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>If the integral <I>were</I> not singular, the question
   could be solved easily.
   
   <P>Up to now, all discontinuous fiber-reinforced composites have
   low ductility. If their ductility <I>were improved</I>, they would
   be highly attractive materials for aircraft applications.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The subjunctive should be used only when the author wishes to
imply strong doubt. Notice the subtle change in attitude when the
subjunctive is not used in the above example:</P>

  <p>If their ductility <I>was improved</I>, they would be
     highly attractive materials for aircraft applications.</p>
  <p><A NAME="1.4.3."></A><b>1.4.3. Voice</b></p>

<P>The voice of a verb indicates whether the subject is performing
the action (active) or receiving the action (passive). Writing
authorities overwhelmingly prefer active voice because it is direct,
clear, and natural. Overuse of passive voice weakens style and
obscures responsibility. This preference for active voice is not a
condemnation of passive voice. Tichy and Fourdrinier (1988) list five
situations when the passive voice is appropriate:</P>

<P>&#149; When the actor is unimportant, not known, or not to be
mentioned</P>

<P>&#149; When the receiver of the action should be emphasized</P>

<P>&#149; When the sentence is abrupt in active voice</P>

<P>&#149; When variety is needed in an active voice passage</P>

<A NAME="1.9.3."></A><b>1.9.3. Dangling Verbals</b>
<P>An infinitive, gerund, or participle dangles when the agent of the
action that it expresses is not clear.</P>

<P>Some authorities (IRS 1962; Tichy and Fourdrinier 1988) consider
an introductory gerund or infinitive phrase to dangle when it does
not modify the subject:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>When <I>using</I> a nonaligning pitot static tube, the
   total velocity component cannot be exactly measured because of the
   swirl component.
   
   <P><I>To predict</I> the thrust and power coefficients of the
   propeller, the aerodynamic coefficients must be provided.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Rowland (1962) considers such gerund phrases acceptable because
"they are employed so frequently in technical writing that they may
be said to be idiomatic." The same can be said of introductory
infinitive phrases. These introductory phrases are clearly adverbial
because no one would attribute their action to the subject. Note that
the verbs in the above sentences are in passive voice, so that an
unknown agent can be supplied for the verbals' actions. When the verb
is in active voice, the verbal tends to dangle:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>When using a nonaligning pitot probe, the swirl component
   precludes exact measurement of total velocity.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Although Rowland justifies introductory adverbial gerund and
infinitive phrases because they are idiomatic and clearly adverbial,
he does not extend this argument to participles. He condemns dangling
participles as "slovenly English" and "weak constructions that should
be replaced by more robust phrasing." Are dangling participles
slovenly English? Or, like the dangling gerund, are they becoming
idiomatic?</P>
