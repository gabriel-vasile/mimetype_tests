They demonstrated, using questionnaire and on-line reading techniques, that readers in English prefer to give a quantified noun phrase in (VP-external) subject position a presuppositional interpretation, in which the noun phrase limits or restricts the interpretation of an already available set, rather than giving it a nonpresuppositional or existential interpretation, in which it introduces completely new entities into the discourse. Experiment 1 showed that readers prefer a presuppositional interpretation of <span class="underline">three ships</span> over the existential interpretation in <span class="underline">Five ships appeared on the horizon. Three ships sank.</span> Experiment 2 showed longer reading times in sentences that are disambiguated toward the existential interpretation than in sentences that permit the presuppositional interpretation. Experiment 3 suggested that the presuppositional preference is greater when the phrase <span class="underline">three ships</span> occurs outside the verb phrase than when it occurs inside the verb phrase. Experiment 4 showed that Korean subjects marked with a topic marker received more presuppositional interpretations than subjects marked with a nominative marker. Experiment 5 showed that German subjects in VP-external (but nontopic) position received more presuppositional interpretations than VP-internal subjects. The results suggest the syntactic position of a phrase is one determinant of its interpretation, as expected according to the mapping hypothesis of <a href="#R10" class="cite-reflink bibr">Diesing (1990)</a>.<div class="p"><span class="kwd-label">Keywords: </span><span class="kwd-text">language processing, syntax-semantics interface, cardinals, mapping hypothesis</span></div></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td class="sidebar-cell" width="145"><div class="side-section-group"><span style="text-transform: none;"><div class="sidefm-pmclink-item"><a href="#top" class="sidefm-pmclink" style="text-transform: none;">Top</a></div></span><span style="text-transform: none;"><div class="sidefm-pmclink-item"><a href="#id452430" class="sidefm-pmclink" style="text-transform: none;">Abstract</a></div></span><span style="text-transform: none;"><div class="sidefm-pmclink-item"><a href="#id578218" class="sidefm-pmclink" style="text-transform: none;">Interpretive preferences</a></div></span><span style="text-transform: none;"><div class="sidefm-pmclink-item"><a href="#id578431" class="sidefm-pmclink" style="text-transform: none;">Experiment 1</a></div></span><span style="text-transform: none;"><div class="sidefm-pmclink-item"><a href="#id578603" class="sidefm-pmclink" style="text-transform: none;">Experiment 2</a></div></span><span style="text-transform: none;"><div class="sidefm-pmclink-item"><a href="#id579170" class="sidefm-pmclink" style="text-transform: none;">Experiment 3</a></div></span><span style="text-transform: none;"><div class="sidefm-pmclink-item"><a href="#id579400" class="sidefm-pmclink" style="text-transform: none;">Experiment 4</a></div></span><span style="text-transform: none;"><div class="sidefm-pmclink-item"><a href="#id579595" class="sidefm-pmclink" style="text-transform: none;">Experiment 5</a></div></span><span style="text-transform: none;"><div class="sidefm-pmclink-item"><a href="#id579840" class="sidefm-pmclink" style="text-transform: none;">General Discussion</a></div></span><span style="text-transform: none;"><div class="sidefm-pmclink-item"><a href="#id580384" class="sidefm-pmclink" style="text-transform: none;">References</a></div></span></div></td><td class="content-cell"><div class="head1 section-title" style="text-transform: none;" id="id452495"> </div><div class="section-content"><span id="P2"></span>Consider the interpretation of <span class="underline">three ships</span> in (1):<p><span id="P3"></span>(1) Five ships appeared on the horizon.

She advanced a general principle of interpretation, the &#x0201c;mapping hypothesis,&#x0201d; that relies on the distinction between phrases that are inside vs. outside the verb phrase (VP) at LF (see <a href="#R32" class="cite-reflink bibr">May, 1986</a>, for discussion of LF). Material which is VP-internal receives a nonpresuppositional (cardinal, existential) interpretation. Material which is VP-external at LF receives a presuppositional (or quantificational) interpretation. VP-external (presupposed) material is presumed to limit the interpretation of VP-internal (existential) material in certain ways.</p><p><span id="P7"></span>The mapping hypothesis can be formalized in the semantic framework of tripartite structures (<a href="#R11" class="cite-reflink bibr">Diesing, 1992</a>; Partee, 1991), as illustrated in (2). Each tripartite structure contains an operator, a restrictor clause expressing restrictions on the domain of quantification, and the asserted materials which are called the &#x0201c;nuclear scope.&#x0201d; A quantifier is mapped onto the operator position; material outside the VP at LF is mapped onto the restrictor clause; and material inside the VP at LF is mapped onto the nuclear scope.</p><p><span id="P8"></span>(2) Sentence:</p><div style="margin: 1em; margin-right: 2em;        border: 1px solid #999999;border-left: 1px solid #AAAAAA;border-bottom: 1px solid #AAAAAA;"><div style="border: 3px solid #F0F0F0; border-left: 1px solid #F8F8F8; border-bottom: 1px solid #F8F8F8;"><a id="F2" name="F2"></a><table border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="5" style="clear:both; width: 100%;"><tr valign="top" align="left"><td width="100" align="center"><a href="articlerender.fcgi?artid=1482313&amp;rendertype=figure&amp;id=F2" class="icon-reflink" onclick="startTarget(this, 'figure', 1024, 800)"><img src="picrender.fcgi?artid=1482313&amp;blobname=nihms10515f2.gif" border="1" class="icon-reflink" alt="figure nihms10515f2" title="figure nihms10515f2"></a></td><td><a class="side-caption" href="articlerender.fcgi?artid=1482313&amp;rendertype=figure&amp;id=F2" onclick="startTarget(this, 'figure', 1024, 800)"></a><div class="figure-table-caption-in-article"><span></span></div></td></tr></table></div></div><p><span id="P9"></span>The quantifier in (2) is <span class="underline">every</span>.

For example, in a conversation about the women in a linguistics class, the domain of quantification in (2) might only include the women in the class. Both restrictors are presupposed. The nonpresupposed information is the predicate in the nuclear scope, <span class="underline">laughs</span>.</p><p><span id="P10"></span>The mapping hypothesis applies at surface structure in some languages, e.g., Diesing offered German examples where a VP-external numeral phrase is claimed to only have a presuppositional interpretation. English is less restrictive<sup><a href="#FN2" class="cite-reflink fn">1</a></sup>. The subject of an English sentence is outside the VP at surface structure, allowing for the presuppositional interpretation, but it is frequently assumed to bind a trace inside the VP. At Logical Form (LF) the subject may be interpreted in the position of the trace inside the VP, giving rise to the existential/cardinal interpretation. In (1), the possibility of the existential interpretation of five ships is presumably due to the trace in the VP internal subject position. Given the presentational verb and the lack of any preceding discourse context, in (1) essentially must receive the nonpresuppositional/ existential interpretation.</p><p><span id="P11"></span>Returning to the interpretation of <span class="underline">three ships</span> in the second sentence, however, the phrase is ambiguous not just in principle but also given the actual preceding discourse context.

The existential interpretation carries no presupposition and hence there is no presupposition violation in this sentence.</p><p><span id="P12"></span>Below we explore the preferences concerning the interpretation of mini-discourses like (1). One question is simply whether there is a tendency to interpret <span class="underline">three ships</span> presuppositionally. If so, is this preference due to a general tendency to favor presuppositional interpretations of phrases in all positions, perhaps because this helps the reader to integrate the new sentence into the preceding discourse, or is this tendency restricted to or stronger for phrases which appear in particular syntactic positions, e.g., VP-external positions?</p></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td class="sidebar-cell" width="145"><div class="side-section-group"><span style="text-transform: none;"><div class="sidefm-pmclink-item"><a href="#top" class="sidefm-pmclink" style="text-transform: none;">Top</a></div></span><span style="text-transform: none;"><div class="sidefm-pmclink-item"><a href="#id452430" class="sidefm-pmclink" style="text-transform: none;">Abstract</a></div></span><div class="sidefm-pmccurrent-item"><a class="sidefm-pmclink" href="javascript:return(false);" style="text-transform: none;"><span class="sidebar-menu-square-image-holder"><img border="0" src="corehtml/pmc/pmcgifs/square.gif" alt="&gt;"></span>Interpretive preferences</a></div><span style="text-transform: none;"><div class="sidefm-pmclink-item"><a href="#id578431" class="sidefm-pmclink" style="text-transform: none;">Experiment 1</a></div></span><span style="text-transform: none;"><div class="sidefm-pmclink-item"><a href="#id578603" class="sidefm-pmclink" style="text-transform: none;">Experiment 2</a></div></span><span style="text-transform: none;"><div class="sidefm-pmclink-item"><a href="#id579170" class="sidefm-pmclink" style="text-transform: none;">Experiment 3</a></div></span><span style="text-transform: none;"><div class="sidefm-pmclink-item"><a href="#id579400" class="sidefm-pmclink" style="text-transform: none;">Experiment 4</a></div></span><span style="text-transform: none;"><div class="sidefm-pmclink-item"><a href="#id579595" class="sidefm-pmclink" style="text-transform: none;">Experiment 5</a></div></span><span style="text-transform: none;"><div class="sidefm-pmclink-item"><a href="#id579840" class="sidefm-pmclink" style="text-transform: none;">General Discussion</a></div></span><span style="text-transform: none;"><div class="sidefm-pmclink-item"><a href="#id580384" class="sidefm-pmclink" style="text-transform: none;">References</a></div></span></div></td><td class="content-cell"><span id="S1"></span><div class="head1 section-title" style="text-transform: none;" id="id578218"><a id="S1"></a>Interpretive preferences</div><div class="section-content"><span id="S1"></span><p><span id="P13"></span>One could imagine that an interesting answer to the question of whether presuppositional or nonpresuppositional interpretations would be preferred, and why, might be developed by reference to widely-accepted analyses of the interpretation of pronouns and other anaphors. A pronoun or anaphor is generally assumed to find a preferred antecedent in a discourse, rather than introducing a new entity into a discourse. This amounts to saying that a pronoun receives a presuppositional interpretation: Its referent is presupposed to exist in the discourse. However, it is clearly too strong to claim that noun phrases in general, or more particularly quantified noun phrases like <span class="underline">three ships</span> in (1), typically receive presuppositional interpretations. Such phrases commonly introduce new entities into a discourse (carry a nonpresuppositional interpretation). We must begin to spell out when they receive a presuppositional interpretation (and be treated in some ways like an anaphor), and when they receive a nonpresuppositional interpretation.</p><p><span id="P14"></span>Similarly, one could attempt to develop a prediction about whether the presuppositional or the nonpresuppositional interpretation is preferred based on speakers&#x02019; and listeners&#x02019; bias to relate new material to already given material. The principle of Referential success (&#x0201c;Favor analyses which succeed in referring to an entity already in the hearer&#x02019;s mental model of discourse over one that does not,.&#x0201d; <a href="#R9" class="cite-reflink bibr">Crain &#x00026; Steedman, 1985</a>) seems to suggest a preference for a presuppositional interpretation.<sup><a href="#FN3" class="cite-reflink fn">2</a></sup> But whether the principle of referential success actually applies depends on how that principle is fleshed out. In our examples, e.g., <span class="underline">Three ships sank</span>, are the three ships already present in the discourse model, or not? In one sense, they are. If a set is available (<span class="underline">five ships</span>) in one sense its subsets are also available. But in another sense, the particular subset introduced by <span class="underline">three ships</span> is new. So the principle of referential success does not apply unambiguously to the examples studied here. Nevertheless, referential overlap may be important in establishing discourse coherence. Complete overlap may be a special case.</p><p><span id="P15"></span>In a similar line, one might suggest that listeners prefer the presuppositional interpretation because they assume that a speaker is likely to continue talking about the same thing in successive sentences. This &#x0201c;continuity preference&#x0201d; explanation is vague, and it carries hidden assumptions. It assumes that when uttering <span class="underline">Five ships appeared on the horizon</span> the speaker is talking about five ships, rather than talking about what happened last night or about the recent naval battle. Further, it assumes that a partitive relation (the three ships were among the initial five) supports continuity better than some other relation (e.g., contrast; five ships returned from a battle, but the remainder of the fleet did not).</p><p><span id="P16"></span>A more explicit version of this suggestion appears in <a href="#R26" class="cite-reflink bibr">Hendriks and De Hoop (2001)</a>, who discuss examples like those tested here, e.g. the example in (3).</p><p><span id="P17"></span>(3) Ten students attended the meeting. Three spoke.</p><p><span id="P18"></span>In an Optimality Theoretic semantics, they proposed that the principle of forwards directionality in (4) applies to the intepretation of such examples.</p><p><span id="P19"></span>(4) Forwards Directionality (<a href="#R26" class="cite-reflink bibr">Hendriks and De Hoop, 2001</a>): The topic range induced by the domain of quantification of a determiner (set A) is reduced to the topic range induced by the intersection of this determiner (A &#x02229; B) [B is the set introduced by the nuclear scope, i.e, the VP.]</p><p><span id="P20"></span>The principle basically specifies that after processing the first sentence in (3) the hearer expects the next sentence to be about the students who attended the meeting. The insight behind the forwards directionality principle seems related to a topic-based account: given a quantifier in subject position of one sentence, a very likely continuation of the discourse does seem to involve the intersection of the restrictor of the quantifier and its nuclear scope.</p><p><span id="P21"></span>An alternative (or additional) approach, which we consider in the present paper, assumes that something along the lines of Diesing&#x02019;s mapping hypothesis applies to human sentence comprehension. Imagine further that readers follow a &#x0201c;minimal effort&#x0201d; principle and prefer to keep phrases in the same position at LF that they appear in at surface structure (see Frazier, 1987, for discussion of the &#x0201c;minimal attachment&#x0201d; principle in parsing which is similar in that it minimizes processing time and effort; see <a href="#R14" class="cite-reflink bibr">Frazier, 1999</a>, <a href="#R15" class="cite-reflink bibr">2000</a>, for an extended development of minimal effort in the form of a &#x0201c;minimal lowering&#x0201d; principle). When <span class="underline">three ships</span> appears in subject position, as in (1), it is in a VP-external position at surface structure, and will by default be in a VP-external position at LF. It will therefore receive a presuppositional interpretation. Only if the processor moves the subject back into the VP at LF would we expect a cardinal reading of <span class="underline">three ships</span>. Thus, a preference for presuppositional interpretations should apply to sentence subjects, as in (1), due simply to a minimal effort strategy.</p><p><span id="P22"></span>The experiments reported here examined discourses like (1), which are ambiguous between a presuppositional and an existential interpretation of the NP introduced in the final sentence. Experiment 1 tested the prediction that presuppositional (minimal effort) interpretations would be preferred in a written questionnaire study, and Experiment 2 provided confirmation in an online eyetracking study. Experiments 3&#x02013;5 explore whether the preferences observed in Experiments 1 and 2 are modulated by the structural position of phrases, as expected under the assumption that the mapping hypothesis applies in sentence interpretation. Experiment 3 investigated the effects of presenting the quantified term (<span class="underline">three ships</span>) in English object vs. subject position (presumably biasing whether it is taken to be VP-internal). Experiment 4 investigated the role of topic and nominative markers on interpretation of corresponding Korean sentences. Experiment 5 examined German.</p></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td class="sidebar-cell" width="145"><div class="side-section-group"><span style="text-transform: none;"><div class="sidefm-pmclink-item"><a href="#top" class="sidefm-pmclink" style="text-transform: none;">Top</a></div></span><span style="text-transform: none;"><div class="sidefm-pmclink-item"><a href="#id452430" class="sidefm-pmclink" style="text-transform: none;">Abstract</a></div></span><span style="text-transform: none;"><div class="sidefm-pmclink-item"><a href="#id578218" class="sidefm-pmclink" style="text-transform: none;">Interpretive preferences</a></div></span><div class="sidefm-pmccurrent-item"><a class="sidefm-pmclink" href="javascript:return(false);" style="text-transform: none;"><span class="sidebar-menu-square-image-holder"><img border="0" src="corehtml/pmc/pmcgifs/square.gif" alt="&gt;"></span>Experiment 1</a></div><span style="text-transform: none;"><div class="sidefm-pmclink-item"><a href="#id578603" class="sidefm-pmclink" style="text-transform: none;">Experiment 2</a></div></span><span style="text-transform: none;"><div class="sidefm-pmclink-item"><a href="#id579170" class="sidefm-pmclink" style="text-transform: none;">Experiment 3</a></div></span><span style="text-transform: none;"><div class="sidefm-pmclink-item"><a href="#id579400" class="sidefm-pmclink" style="text-transform: none;">Experiment 4</a></div></span><span style="text-transform: none;"><div class="sidefm-pmclink-item"><a href="#id579595" class="sidefm-pmclink" style="text-transform: none;">Experiment 5</a></div></span><span style="text-transform: none;"><div class="sidefm-pmclink-item"><a href="#id579840" class="sidefm-pmclink" style="text-transform: none;">General Discussion</a></div></span><span style="text-transform: none;"><div class="sidefm-pmclink-item"><a href="#id580384" class="sidefm-pmclink" style="text-transform: none;">References</a></div></span></div></td><td class="content-cell"><span id="S2"></span><div class="head1 section-title" style="text-transform: none;" id="id578431"><a id="S2"></a>Experiment 1</div><div class="section-content"><span id="S2"></span><p><span id="P23"></span>Experiment 1 simply asked readers for their preferred interpretation of quantified noun phrases that appeared in sentence subject position.

The experimental texts occupied 2 to 3 lines and the maximum line length was 80 characters. To optimize the accuracy of the eye tracking data, the lines of the texts were arranged such that the target regions occurred in the central region of a line.</p></p><p><span id="S13"></span><span class="head3">Procedure </span> <span id="P46"></span>Each participant was tested individually. A bite bar was made for each participant to help minimize head movements during the experiment. Participants were given a brief description of the eye tracker and were told that the purpose of the experiment was to study how people read. Participants were instructed to read at a comfortable pace. They were told that some of the passages would be followed by a two-choice alternative question. Once the instructions were understood, the eye tracker was calibrated.<p><span id="P47"></span>Before reading each passage, a row of five fixation boxes was displayed where the first line of a text would appear. The participant was instructed to look at the middle box, and then to look at each box to the left until reaching the left-most box, which indicated the position of the first letter in the upcoming text. If the calibration was accurate, the experimenter initiated the trial. If there was any question, the experimenter had the participant look to the boxes on the right, and recalibrated if necessary. After reading the passage the participant pressed a response key, which cleared the screen. On those trials for which there was a question, the cue &#x02018;Question&#x02019; was presented for 500 ms, and then the question and alternatives were presented. Participants responded to the question by pressing the key corresponding to the correct alternative. The row of five boxes was displayed again, and the next trial was conducted. Half way through the experiment, participants were given a break.</p></p></p><p><span id="S14"></span><div class="head2 head-separate">Results</div><span id="P48"></span>Following standard practice in analyzing eye movement data (<a href="#R35" class="cite-reflink bibr">Rayner, Sereno, Morris, Schmauder &#x00026; Clifton, 1989</a>), a variety of measures were examined. First, each two-sentence discourse was divided into regions as indicated in (7). For our purposes, the critical regions are Region 5, the quantifier phrase of the third sentence which disambiguated toward a presuppositional vs. a nonpresuppositional interpretation, and Region 6, the following region which was defined as the following word or string of words spanning at least seven characters.<p><span id="P49"></span>The measures which proved to be most informative were first pass reading time (the sum of all fixation durations made in a region from first entering it to first leaving it) and total time (the sum of all fixations made in a region, including those made after the eye had left the region then returned). Since the length of Region 5 varied systematically among conditions, an attempt was made to correct for length differences by using a &#x0201c;deviation from regression&#x0201d; analysis introduced by <a href="#R12" class="cite-reflink bibr">Ferreira &#x00026; Clifton, 1986</a> (cf. <a href="#R38" class="cite-reflink bibr">Trueswell, Tanenhaus &#x00026; Garnsey, 1994</a>). In this analysis, a linear regression equation is computed for each subject, based on all the data in the experiment, predicting reading time as a function of region length, and then the parameters of this regression are used to predict the expected reading time for the region of interest. The signed difference between the observed time and the predicted time is used as the statistic of interest, &#x0201c;adjusted reading time,&#x0201d; positive numbers being slower than predicted. Since Region 6 did not differ among conditions, and since the results of analyses of these adjusted times did not differ materially from analyses of unadjusted times, only the analysis of unadjusted times will be reported for Region 6.</p><p><span id="P50"></span>The data appear in <a href="articlerender.fcgi?artid=1482313&amp;rendertype=figure&amp;id=F1" class="fig-table-link " onclick="startTarget(this, 'figure', 1024, 800)">Figure 1</a> and <a href="articlerender.fcgi?artid=1482313&amp;rendertype=table&amp;id=T1" class="fig-table-link " onclick="startTarget(this, 'table', 1024, 800)">Table 1</a>. The former contains first pass adjusted times for all regions of the sentences, while the latter contains the unadjusted first pass and total times for the critical regions. Consider first pass times first. Recall that the lexical items in Region 5, the subject of the final sentence, differed systematically among the four conditions, making clear predictions about reading time impossible. This region was much shorter in conditions 1 and 2 than in conditions 3 and 4, resulting in faster reading time for the former than the latter (261 vs 409 ms). Adjusting first pass times for region length made the difference disappear or even reverse slightly (75 vs. 131 ms faster than predicted by length). There were too many missing observations in the short Region 5 of conditions 1 and 2 to do an statistical analysis. However, simple t-tests comparing the adjusted first pass times for Condition 3 (unambiguous presuppositional, 110 ms faster than predicted) and Condition 4 (unambiguous nonpresuppositional, 39 ms faster than predicted) indicated that the former was significantly faster (t1(1,47) = 5.09; t2(1,15) = 3.14, p &#x0003c; .01). There may have been a fast-appearing source of difficulty in the nonpresuppositional sentence, even when it is clearly disambiguated. However, this conclusion is uncertain, because the comparison involved the lexical items <span class="underline">N of them</span> and <span class="underline">another N</span> in all cases, confounding any comparison.</p><div style="margin: 1em; margin-right: 2em;        border: 1px solid #999999;border-left: 1px solid #AAAAAA;border-bottom: 1px solid #AAAAAA;"><div style="border: 3px solid #F0F0F0; border-left: 1px solid #F8F8F8; border-bottom: 1px solid #F8F8F8;"><a id="F1" name="F1"></a><table border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="5" style="clear:both; width: 100%;"><tr valign="top" align="left"><td width="100" align="center"><a href="articlerender.fcgi?artid=1482313&amp;rendertype=figure&amp;id=F1" class="icon-reflink" onclick="startTarget(this, 'figure', 1024, 800)"><img src="picrender.fcgi?artid=1482313&amp;blobname=nihms10515f1.gif" border="1" class="icon-reflink" alt="Figure 1" title="Figure 1"></a></td><td><a class="side-caption" href="articlerender.fcgi?artid=1482313&amp;rendertype=figure&amp;id=F1" onclick="startTarget(this, 'figure', 1024, 800)"><strong>Figure 1</strong></a><div class="figure-table-caption-in-article"><span>Mean first pass reading time (in ms deviation from predicted time) for each region of sentences 2 and 3, Experiment 2.

A 2X2 analysis of variance of Region 6 first pass times with the factors ambiguity and presuppositionality showed a significant interaction (F1(1,47) = 4.08, p &#x0003c; .05; F2(1,15) = 11.11, p &#x0003c; .01). Both main effects were also significant (ambiguity: F1(1,47) = 8.03, p &#x0003c; .01, F2(1,15) = 11.39, p &#x0003c;. 01; presupposionality: F1(1,47) = 3.99, p &#x0003c; .06, F2(1,15) = 9.10, p &#x0003c; .01), but they reflect the same effect that gave rise to the interaction: Condition 2, the temporarily ambiguous nonpresuppositional form, was slower (at 570 ms) than the other three conditions, which did not differ from each other (and ranged from 463 to 490 ms). Disambiguating toward the nonpresuppositional form was costly in reading time, suggesting that readers preferred the presuppositional interpretation.</p><p><span id="P52"></span>Total time data support compatible conclusions. Once again, in Region 5, Condition 3 was faster than Condition 4 according to simple t-tests (459 vs 546 ms in unadjusted time; t1(47) = 3.93; t2(15) = 2.68, p &#x0003c; .05). This may indicate difficulty in even the unambiguous nonpresuppositional form, or it may reflect lexical differences between the regions.</p><p><span id="P53"></span>Considering Region 6, once again Condition 2 (ambiguous nonpresuppositional) was notably longer in total reading time than the rest (725 vs. an average of 608 ms., ranging from 582 to 624 ms). This time, the interaction was nonsignificant (F1(1,47) = 1.70, p &#x0003e; .15; F2(1,15) = 2.29, p &#x0003e; .10), although both main effects were again significant (ambiguity: F1(1,47) = 11.85; F2(1,15) = 4.66; presuppositionality: F1(1,47) = 5.47; F2(1,15) = 9.05; all p &#x0003c; .05). A more powerful test contrasted Condition 2 with the remaining conditions, and indicated a significant difference (F1(1,47) = 13.63, p &#x0003c;.001; F2(1,15) = 9.05, p &#x0003c; .01) while the differences among the remaining conditions were not significant (F1 and F2 &#x0003c; 1).</p></p><p><span id="S15"></span><div class="head2 head-separate">Discussion</div><span id="P54"></span>Descriptively, the data show a quick disruption of reading immediately following a region that disambiguates the interpretation of a quantified NP in subject position in favor of a nonpresuppositional vs. a presuppositional meaning. Condition 2, the temporarily ambiguous nonpresuppositional condition, was read more slowly in Region 6 than Condition 1, the temporarily ambiguous presuppositional condition. The data also show possible evidence of earlier disruption when a syntactically unambiguous sentence forces a nonpresuppositional interpretation. The quantified NP was read slowly in Condition 4, the disambiguated nonpresuppositional condition, compared to the Condition 3, the disambiguated presuppositional condition. Neither disruption was massive, and the comparison of Conditions 3 and 4 at the quantified NP is difficult to interpret because of the lexical differences between the two conditions. Total reading times were only modestly longer than first pass reading times, suggesting that most subjects usually did not have to devote substantial time to re-reading sentences. Analyses not reported above indicated that some re-reading was done (e.g., the frequency of regressive eye movements out of Region 6 was greater in the ambiguous than the unambiguous conditions; 20 vs 12%, F1(1,47) = 7.53; F2(1,15) = 6.39; p &#x0003c; .02) but the amount was modest.<p><span id="P55"></span>One possible view of the disruption shown in ambiguous nonpresuppositional items and possibly in unambiguous ones is simply that they are less plausible than presuppositional items, perhaps because they violate principles such as Referential success or Forward Directionality, or perhaps because they conflict with the &#x0201c;minimal effort&#x0201d; application of Diesing&#x02019;s mapping hypothesis, discussed above. We explored this possibility by having 44 University of Massachusetts undergraduates rate the unambiguous versions of the items used in Experiment 2 on a five-point scale where &#x0201c;1&#x0201d; was &#x0201c;implausible&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;5&#x0201d; was &#x0201c;plausible.&#x0201d; Each subject saw the first two sentences from half the items in the unambiguous presuppositional version and other half in the unambiguous nonpresuppositional version. Two counterbalanced questionnaire forms were used, so that each item was tested equally often in each version. The mean rating of presuppositional items was significantly higher than the mean rating of nonpresuppositional items, 3.97 vs 3.64 (t(43) = 3.10, p &#x0003c; .01.</p><p><span id="P56"></span>This plausibility difference is not unexpected, given the possibly greater naturalness of the presuppositional version. However, the difference might be a concern if it reflects idiosyncratic factors making individual unambiguously nonpresuppositional items implausible rather than a general dispreference for nonpresuppositional items. To evaluate this possibility, we computed the difference in plausibility between the presuppositional and nonpresuppositional versions of each item and divided the items at the median of these differences. The mean difference was .77 for the eight items with the largest difference, and .10 for the eight items with the smallest difference. First pass eyetracking means for Region 6, the predicate of the final sentence, were computed for the items in each group. The time penalty for ambiguous nonpresuppositional sentences compared to ambiguous presuppositional sentences was 56 ms for the eight items with the largest difference in plausibility between nonpresuppositional and presuppositional forms, and 96 ms for the eight items with the smallest difference in plausibility. It thus seems unlikely that the overall effect of presuppositional status on reading times is due to adventitious implausibility of some of the nonpresuppositional items.</p><p><span id="P57"></span>Experiment 2 provides an on-line demonstration of what was apparent in Experiment 1: Presuppositional readings are favored for quantified NPs in sentence subject position. It further suggests that the advantage of the presuppositional interpretation reflects an interpretive choice principle, not simply the greater plausibility of presuppositional readings. If presuppositional readings were harder, or unpreferred, simply because they are implausible, then we would have expected to find larger reading time penalties when the plausibility difference between presuppositional and nonpresuppositional readings is greatest. We did not. Further, if presuppositional reading were harder just because of their implausibility, we should have found slow reading times in the lexically-constant Region 6 for unambiguous presuppositional than for unambiguous nonpresuppositional discourses (as was found for temporarily-ambiguous discourses). We did not.</p><p><span id="P58"></span>We do not want to claim that discourse continuity principles are irrelevant to the preference we observed for the presuppositional interpretation. But we do want to explore the possibility that they are not sufficient. They differ from the minimal effort application of Diesing&#x02019;s mapping hypothesis that we have described in that this latter application claims that the syntactic position of a phrase is also important. A phrase is often ambiguous between being presuppositional and nonpresuppositional, as in the case of the theme argument of a passive or active sentence. If the phrase appears in VP-internal position, readers should be less likely to take it as presuppositional than if it appears in VP-external position according to the mapping hypothesis, but not according to the continuity preference, Referential success, or Forwards directionality principle. Strictly speaking, the mapping hypothesis prediction depends on the position of the phrase in LF, not at surface structure. However, if Diesing&#x02019;s mapping hypothesis applies to normal reading in a minimal effort fashion, placing the ambiguous phrase in postverbal position should result in fewer presuppositional interpretations than placing it in subject position, as has been done up to now. In other words, readers will be more likely to compute an LF with the object interpreted in the VP when the object is placed in the VP in surface structure than when it occurs outside the VP at surface structure.</p><p><span id="P59"></span>Intuition suggests that this prediction may be correct. Consider the discourses in (8) and (9).</p><p><span id="P60"></span>(8) Three men were standing in the restaurant when I came in.

That is, it is less likely to receive a presuppositional interpretation when it is in postverbal position than when it is in subject position.

Their postverbal counterparts (10b) received a presuppositional interpretation 59.0% of the time. This difference is significant by subjects (F1(1,59) = 4.08, p &#x0003c; .05) and nearly significant by items (F2(1,15) = 4.54, p = .07. A replication of Experiment 3 was carried out, using the same items, but this time randomly included among 56 other items of various forms, all requiring a choice between two interpretations. Forty-eight subjects from the same population were tested in the same way, except that this time the YES alternative always appeared on the left. In this replication, subject-position discourses received 66.2% presuppositional interpretations, and postverbal discourses received 60.9%.

The lack of significance in the items analysis may be due to a lack of power caused by using only 16 items to observe a small effect. However, the joint probability under the null hypothesis of obtaining the reported by-items significance levels in Experiment 3 and its modified replication is less than .02. Thus, we are willing to conclude that the effect is real, even if it is small.</p><p><span id="S19"></span><div class="head2 head-separate">Discussion</div><span id="P74"></span>Surface position (VP external vs. internal) of the quantified NP seemed to have a small effect on whether it received a presuppositional or a nonpresuppositional interpretation. The mapping hypothesis, together with minimal effort hypothesis, predicted the observed effect. However, one can legitimately ask, if VP external phrases receive presuppositional interpretations and VP internal phrases nonpresuppositional, as we have claimed, why is the difference so small? (Though we note that an effect can be real even if it is small. The question is really whether it replicates.) One may also ask how a VP internal phrase can receive nearly 60% presuppositional interpretations. We suspect that various reasons are possible. There is certainly some slippage between position in surface structure and position at LF. The latter position is what matters, but the former is what we can manipulate. However, out of context, a reader can treat the sentence subject as introducing new information (by, e.g., putting focus on it) and thus as VP internal nonpresupposed information. Further, although it goes against the default mapping principle, a reader could treat material inside the surface VP as old, presupposed, information (&#x0201c;Who hit Jack? JILL hit Jack&#x0201d;), mapping it onto the nuclear scope (the asserted material, cf. (3)). Such interpretations go against our presumed minimal effort principle, whereby the surface position of a phrase is mapped into its interpretation as presuppositional or not, but minimal effort may be just one of many factors that influence interpretation. In the present case, discourse factors are likely to be part of the answer. But our point is that syntax too is playing a role.<p><span id="P75"></span>Assuming that VP-external subjects in English tend to be interpreted presuppositionally when possible (Experiment 1 and 2) and tend to receive more presuppositional interpretations than VP internal phrases (Experiment 3) the important question is why? Must these results be attributed to the mapping hypothesis? In English, the highest subject seems to serve as the default topic. For example, pronouns typically take the highest subject as antecedent when it is available (<a href="#R8" class="cite-reflink bibr">Clifton &#x00026; Ferreira, 1987</a>) and repeated name penalties are observed for subjects (<a href="#R23" class="cite-reflink bibr">Gordon, Grosz &#x00026; Gilliam, 1993</a>, <a href="#R24" class="cite-reflink bibr">Gordon &#x00026; Hendrick, 1997</a>). This raises the question of whether the presuppositional preference observed in the preceding experiments might really be due not to the VP-external position of the numeral phrase but instead due to information-structure and the default topic status of the subject.</p><p><span id="P76"></span>The possibility that topichood is what&#x02019;s at issue in the preceding experiments may be assessed by examining a language where the subject is explicitly marked with either a topic marker or with a nominative case marker. Ideally one would like to test the effect of having a topic marker without varying the syntactic position of a phrase. Korean is, a language which contains both a topic marker and a nominative marker though, as will be discussed below, the question of the syntactic position of topics has not been fully resolved. Experiment 4 tests the preferred interpretation of Korean counterparts to the sentence tested in English to see if overt marking of a phrase as topic matters. Experiment 5 will then examine subjects that vary in whether they are VP-internal or VP-external, in German, where VP-external subjects occur in a within clause non-topic position.</p></p></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td class="sidebar-cell" width="145"><div class="side-section-group"><span style="text-transform: none;"><div class="sidefm-pmclink-item"><a href="#top" class="sidefm-pmclink" style="text-transform: none;">Top</a></div></span><span style="text-transform: none;"><div class="sidefm-pmclink-item"><a href="#id452430" class="sidefm-pmclink" style="text-transform: none;">Abstract</a></div></span><span style="text-transform: none;"><div class="sidefm-pmclink-item"><a href="#id578218" class="sidefm-pmclink" style="text-transform: none;">Interpretive preferences</a></div></span><span style="text-transform: none;"><div class="sidefm-pmclink-item"><a href="#id578431" class="sidefm-pmclink" style="text-transform: none;">Experiment 1</a></div></span><span style="text-transform: none;"><div class="sidefm-pmclink-item"><a href="#id578603" class="sidefm-pmclink" style="text-transform: none;">Experiment 2</a></div></span><span style="text-transform: none;"><div class="sidefm-pmclink-item"><a href="#id579170" class="sidefm-pmclink" style="text-transform: none;">Experiment 3</a></div></span><div class="sidefm-pmccurrent-item"><a class="sidefm-pmclink" href="javascript:return(false);" style="text-transform: none;"><span class="sidebar-menu-square-image-holder"><img border="0" src="corehtml/pmc/pmcgifs/square.gif" alt="&gt;"></span>Experiment 4</a></div><span style="text-transform: none;"><div class="sidefm-pmclink-item"><a href="#id579595" class="sidefm-pmclink" style="text-transform: none;">Experiment 5</a></div></span><span style="text-transform: none;"><div class="sidefm-pmclink-item"><a href="#id579840" class="sidefm-pmclink" style="text-transform: none;">General Discussion</a></div></span><span style="text-transform: none;"><div class="sidefm-pmclink-item"><a href="#id580384" class="sidefm-pmclink" style="text-transform: none;">References</a></div></span></div></td><td class="content-cell"><span id="S20"></span><div class="head1 section-title" style="text-transform: none;" id="id579400"><a id="S20"></a>Experiment 4</div><div class="section-content"><span id="S20"></span><p><span id="S21"></span><div class="head2 head-separate">Method</div><span id="P77"></span>The 16 mini-discourses of Experiment 1 (<a href="#APP1" class="cite-reflink app">Appendix A</a>) were translated into Korean.

Similarly, in Italian (unmodified) bare nominals receive generic interpretations in VP-external/pre-verbal subject position but only existential interpretations in VP-internal/postverbal subject position (<a href="#R30" class="cite-reflink bibr">Longobardi, 2000</a>). These and other facts support a broader generalization of the mapping hypothesis variety rather than the narrower generalization that likely-topics are interpreted presuppositionally.</p></p></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td class="sidebar-cell" width="145"><div class="side-section-group"><span style="text-transform: none;"><div class="sidefm-pmclink-item"><a href="#top" class="sidefm-pmclink" style="text-transform: none;">Top</a></div></span><span style="text-transform: none;"><div class="sidefm-pmclink-item"><a href="#id452430" class="sidefm-pmclink" style="text-transform: none;">Abstract</a></div></span><span style="text-transform: none;"><div class="sidefm-pmclink-item"><a href="#id578218" class="sidefm-pmclink" style="text-transform: none;">Interpretive preferences</a></div></span><span style="text-transform: none;"><div class="sidefm-pmclink-item"><a href="#id578431" class="sidefm-pmclink" style="text-transform: none;">Experiment 1</a></div></span><span style="text-transform: none;"><div class="sidefm-pmclink-item"><a href="#id578603" class="sidefm-pmclink" style="text-transform: none;">Experiment 2</a></div></span><span style="text-transform: none;"><div class="sidefm-pmclink-item"><a href="#id579170" class="sidefm-pmclink" style="text-transform: none;">Experiment 3</a></div></span><span style="text-transform: none;"><div class="sidefm-pmclink-item"><a href="#id579400" class="sidefm-pmclink" style="text-transform: none;">Experiment 4</a></div></span><div class="sidefm-pmccurrent-item"><a class="sidefm-pmclink" href="javascript:return(false);" style="text-transform: none;"><span class="sidebar-menu-square-image-holder"><img border="0" src="corehtml/pmc/pmcgifs/square.gif" alt="&gt;"></span>Experiment 5</a></div><span style="text-transform: none;"><div class="sidefm-pmclink-item"><a href="#id579840" class="sidefm-pmclink" style="text-transform: none;">General Discussion</a></div></span><span style="text-transform: none;"><div class="sidefm-pmclink-item"><a href="#id580384" class="sidefm-pmclink" style="text-transform: none;">References</a></div></span></div></td><td class="content-cell"><span id="S24"></span><div class="head1 section-title" style="text-transform: none;" id="id579595"><a id="S24"></a>Experiment 5</div><div class="section-content"><span id="S24"></span><p><span id="P91"></span>To further explore the issue, we turn to German. In German, phrases may scramble outside the VP, in front of a speaker-oriented adverb like <span class="underline">ja doch</span> &#x02018;certainly&#x02019; or <span class="underline">leider</span> &#x02018;regretfully&#x02019;. A subject in this position (12a) is VP-external, but it is not in topic position. Topic position is higher in the structure and sentence-initial, i.e., it precedes the highest tensed verb. (<span class="underline">Gegen Mittag</span> is generally considered the topic in (12a, b).)</p><p><span id="P92"></span>(12) Am Morgen sind f&#x000fc;nf Schiffe am Horizon erscheinen.</p><p><span id="P93"></span>&#x02018;At morning are five ships at horizon appeared.&#x02019;</p><ul style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li><span>Gegen Mittag sind <span class="underline">drei Schiffe leider</span> gesunken.

(VP-internal)</span></li></ul><p><span id="P97"></span>In the scrambled position, the subject is VP-external but not in topic position, allowing one to tease apart the topic-based account and the position-based account. If subjects in VP-external position receive more presuppositional interpretations than subjects in VP -internal position, this would support the broader generalization of the mapping hypothesis. However, if subjects in these two positions do not differ in how often they are interpreted presuppositionally, this would favor the view that the Korean and English results are due to topichood, not syntactic mapping constraints between syntactic position and interpretation.</p><p><span id="P98"></span>The English sentences of Experiment 1 were adapted to permit the inclusion of an adverb, so that the position of the subject was unambiguous. Two forms of each mini-discourse were constructed. They differed only with respect to the relative position of the subject and the adverb, as illustrated in (12). When the subject occurs after the adverb, as in (12b), it is VP-internal. When the subject scrambles over the adverb, as in (12a), it is in VP-external position.</p><p><span id="S25"></span><div class="head2 head-separate">Method</div><p><span id="S26"></span><span class="head3">Materials </span> <span id="P99"></span>The 16 two-sentence discourses of Experiment 1 were translated into German, as shown in (12). The first sentence was translated as literally as possible. The second sentence was translated with the following restrictions applying. First, SpecCP was filled with an adverbial. The part of the sentence following the finite verb contained the crucial indefinite NP (<span class="underline">f&#x000fc;nf Schiffe</span>/<span class="underline">five ships</span>) as well as one of those adverbials which delimit the left edge of VP in German (cf. <a href="#R11" class="cite-reflink bibr">Diesing, 1992</a>; <a href="#R19" class="cite-reflink bibr">Frey &#x00026; Pittner, 1998</a>), mainly sentential adverbials but also some temporal adverbials. The indefinite NP either followed or preceded this adverbial.<p><span id="P100"></span>A question was prepared for each mini discourse. It queried the interpretation of the ambiguous phrase, e.g. &#x0201c;Geh&#x000f6;rten die drei Schiffe, die sanken, zu den f&#x000fc;nf Schiffen, die am Horizont erschienen? Ja __ Nein __&#x0201d; (&#x0201c;Did the three ships that sank belong to the five ships that appeared on the horizon? Yes __ No __&#x0201d;) for the discourses in (12). For each discourse, the same question was used for both orders of subject and adverbial.</p><p><span id="P101"></span>Two lists of the 16 discourses were constructed in a counterbalanced way, ensuring that each discourse appeared in only one version in a given list and that each list contained the same number of discourses of each type.</p></p><p><span id="S27"></span><span class="head3">Procedure and participants </span> <span id="P102"></span>The materials were randomized together with 16 other two-sentence discourses that did not contain quantified noun-phrases. Seventy-seven students of the University of Konstanz either received course credit or were paid for participating in the experiment. They were instructed to read each discourse and answer a question about it by checking the appropriate (yes/no) answer.</p></p><p><span id="S28"></span><div class="head2 head-separate">Results</div><span id="P103"></span>The discourses in which the subject preceded the adverbial (like (12a)) received a presuppositional interpretation 72.3% of the time. Discourses in which the subject followed the adverbial (like (12b)) received a presuppositional interpretation 63.1% of the time. This difference was significant by subjects (F1(1,76) = 4.56, p &#x0003c; .05) and almost significant by items (F2(1,15) = 3.57, p = .08).</p><p><span id="S29"></span><div class="head2 head-separate">Discussion</div><span id="P104"></span>The German results are informative. In VP-external position, subjects received more presuppositional interpretations than in VP-internal position. Further, the size of the effect (9.2%) is very comparable to the size of the topic-nominative difference in Korean. However, as discussed above, the effect in German cannot be attributed to topichood: Neither the VP-external nor the VP-internal position is a topic position. It appears necessary to attribute the effect to whether the subject NP is internal vs. external to the VP, congruent with the Mapping hypothesis.</p></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td class="sidebar-cell" width="145"><div class="side-section-group"><span style="text-transform: none;"><div class="sidefm-pmclink-item"><a href="#top" class="sidefm-pmclink" style="text-transform: none;">Top</a></div></span><span style="text-transform: none;"><div class="sidefm-pmclink-item"><a href="#id452430" class="sidefm-pmclink" style="text-transform: none;">Abstract</a></div></span><span style="text-transform: none;"><div class="sidefm-pmclink-item"><a href="#id578218" class="sidefm-pmclink" style="text-transform: none;">Interpretive preferences</a></div></span><span style="text-transform: none;"><div class="sidefm-pmclink-item"><a href="#id578431" class="sidefm-pmclink" style="text-transform: none;">Experiment 1</a></div></span><span style="text-transform: none;"><div class="sidefm-pmclink-item"><a href="#id578603" class="sidefm-pmclink" style="text-transform: none;">Experiment 2</a></div></span><span style="text-transform: none;"><div class="sidefm-pmclink-item"><a href="#id579170" class="sidefm-pmclink" style="text-transform: none;">Experiment 3</a></div></span><span style="text-transform: none;"><div class="sidefm-pmclink-item"><a href="#id579400" class="sidefm-pmclink" style="text-transform: none;">Experiment 4</a></div></span><span style="text-transform: none;"><div class="sidefm-pmclink-item"><a href="#id579595" class="sidefm-pmclink" style="text-transform: none;">Experiment 5</a></div></span><div class="sidefm-pmccurrent-item"><a class="sidefm-pmclink" href="javascript:return(false);" style="text-transform: none;"><span class="sidebar-menu-square-image-holder"><img border="0" src="corehtml/pmc/pmcgifs/square.gif" alt="&gt;"></span>General Discussion</a></div><span style="text-transform: none;"><div class="sidefm-pmclink-item"><a href="#id580384" class="sidefm-pmclink" style="text-transform: none;">References</a></div></span></div></td><td class="content-cell"><span id="S30"></span><div class="head1 section-title" style="text-transform: none;" id="id579840"><a id="S30"></a>General Discussion</div><div class="section-content"><span id="S30"></span><p><span id="P105"></span>Are there structural constraints on the interpretation of a phrase or do discourse and the intrinsic properties of a phrase alone determine its interpretation? The present results address this question with respect to one ambiguity: the presuppositional vs. existential interpretation of numeral phrases.</p><p><span id="P106"></span>Two striking generalizations emerge from the questionnaire data (Experiments 1, 3, 4, and 5). Overall readers preferred the more presuppositional interpretation of the ambiguous phrase -60% or higher in all cases. As noted earlier, this might be related to some principle like a continuity preference, referential success or forwards directionality - any principle which favors relating new material to old independent of position (although as discussed in Experiment 2, the principle apparently must act as an ambiguity resolution principle, not simply a source of added plausibility or felicity).</p><p><span id="P107"></span>The second generalization about the questionnaire data is the close comparability of the distinct manipulations in the three languages: subject vs. object in English, topic vs. nominative in Korean, and VP external vs. VP-internal subject in German. Though the mechanisms for conveying information structure differ across these languages, the effect on interpretation is surprisingly similar. Indeed, <a href="#R28" class="cite-reflink bibr">Kaan and Wijnen (2001)</a> have also reported data from Dutch examples similar to those tested here. They too found a preference for presuppositional interpretations.</p><p><span id="P108"></span>The English and German examples can, of course, be attributed directly to the predictions of the mapping hypothesis. But what about Korean? Is it possible that the Korean examples too should be attributed not to the particular particle per se, but to distinct positions of the phrase the particle attaches to? Since the German results cannot be attributed to topicalization, they raise the question of whether the apparent topic effect in Korean might really be an effect of structural position. Although the order of constituents is the same for the Korean topic sentences and the nominative sentences, the position of the subject might differ. A Korean sentence may have a topic preceding the nominative subject, as in (13) (We are grateful to M. Kim for discussion of Korean syntax.)</p><p><span id="P109"></span>(13) John - un sakwa-ka mat-iss-ta.</p><p><span id="P110"></span>John-top apple-nom taste-exist-declarative.</p><p><span id="P111"></span>&#x02018;As for John, apples are delicious,&#x02019;</p><p><span id="P112"></span>The grammaticality of (13) suggest that a topic phrase may occur higher than a nominative subject. Further, in sentences like (13) above or other types of sentences including both a topic and a nominative (e.g., 14), the nominative cannot be scrambled outside the topic phrase, appearing before it, unless it is given a special contrastive interpretation.</p><p><span id="P113"></span>(14) Sakwa-ka John-un mat-iss-ta.</p><p><span id="P114"></span>Apple-nom John-top taste-exist-declarative.</p><p><span id="P115"></span>&#x02018;It is apples that John likes.&#x0201d;</p><p><span id="P116"></span>If topic-marked subjects and nom-subjects occupied the same syntactic position, these facts would be surprising. There would be no reason to expect an ordering restriction or a special interpretation just in case the nominative subject occurs in front of a topic-marked phrase. If the nominative sentences we tested really have VP internal subjects, then assuming the topic phrase is VP-external, the Korean examples might in fact be further evidence for a structural effect on interpretation of the mapping hypothesis variety. In short, the German results prevent us from attributing all of the results of Experiments 1&#x02013;5 to topichood. But nothing prevents all of the results being attributed to the mapping hypothesis.</p><p><span id="P117"></span>Many interesting studies of information structure differences among languages exist (Valluvi and Engdahl, 1996, <a href="#R18" class="cite-reflink bibr">Frey, 2002</a>, for example). The current work contributes to this tradition, we hope. Like the purely linguistic work, based on intuitive judgments, the current work suggests that it is not the intrinsic properties of a phrase alone that determines its interpretation. Nor is it just the discourse context in which the sentence containing the phrase occurs. It is also the structure in which the phrase occurs. Speakers use the devices available in the grammars of their languages to encode the (non-)presuppositional status of phrases. Across languages many devices are available. But where a VP-internal vs. VP-external choice exists presuppositional phrases preferentially occur outside the VP.</p></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td class="sidebar-cell" width="145"> </td><td class="content-cell"><span id="APP1"></span><div class="head1 section-title" style="text-transform: none;" id="id581657"><a id="APP1"></a>Appendix A: Materials from Experiment 1 (with percentages of YES [presuppositional] answers)</div><div class="section-content"><p><ul style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li><span>Five ships appeared on the horizon.
