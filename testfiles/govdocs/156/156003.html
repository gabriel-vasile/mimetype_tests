<P><STRONG>Subject: </STRONG>	Response to US Domain Request for Comments</P>


<P>As is made clear from the fact that you are gathering comments on this</P>

<P>issue, there are many problems with the current .us domain structure. </P>

<P>In this comment, I propose to identify some of the perceived problems</P>

<P>and to detail the solutions that I would suggest for them.  My standing</P>

<P>in this matter is as a long time user of the Internet (I've been on the</P>

<P>net in one form or another since the late 1980's.)  I have also</P>

<P>consulted with many firms attempting to move onto the net.</P>


<P>The biggest single problem with the .us domain is the excessive length</P>

<P>of domain names in this domain.  For example, if I wished to get a</P>

<P>'nominative' domain for use at my home, my domain name would be</P>

<P>something similar to the following:</P>

<P> narkinsky.newport-news.va.us</P>

<P>If I wanted to follow the customary 'www' prefix to web servers, it</P>

<P>would be:</P>

<P> www.narkinsky.newport-news.va.us</P>

<P>This is completely unacceptable, especially for email addresses which</P>

<P>often have to be typed.  Even worse, if I have only a vague recollection</P>

<P>of someone's email address, I could just as easily choose:</P>

<P> narkinsky.nn.va.us (Which would make a lot more sense)</P>

<P> narkinsky.newportnews.va.us</P>

<P> narkinsky.hamptonroads.va.us</P>

<P> narkinsky.hampton-roads.va.us</P>

<P> ...</P>

<P>Just as bad, if I move less than one mile to Hampton, my domain should</P>

<P>really change.  To this end, I would suggest that the structure of the</P>

<P>.us domain be updated to offer more options.  Most other 'country' TLD's</P>

<P>use a structure somewhat similar to the following:</P>

<P> organization.type.country</P>

<P>where organization is the name of the organization, type is the type,</P>

<P>and country is obviously the 2 digit ISO country code.</P>


<P>Hence, my first recommendation: I think we should move to a structure</P>

<P>where it is possible to have an address of the form:</P>

<P> organization.type.state.country</P>

<P>For example, I could then have an address of 'narkinsky.nom.va.us'.  I</P>

<P>would suggest that the following be valid types:</P>

<P> com: For companies</P>

<P> nom: Nominative -- for individuals and families.</P>

<P> gov: State government</P>

<P> org: Non-Profit organizations</P>

<P> net: For network entities and ISP's</P>

<P> edu: Schools</P>

<P>Ideally, there should be a fairly streamlined way to add to the above</P>

<P>types.  Really and truly, the overhead of maintaining additional</P>

<P>subdomains is not much.</P>


<P>Secondly, we need to accept the fact that many companies are truly</P>

<P>national in scope.  It is absolutely inane to insist that, for example</P>

<P>IBM, register as 'ibm.armonk.nj.us'.  Far more reasonable, intuitive,</P>

<P>and usable would be to have the above categories available directly</P>

<P>under the .us domain.  So, for example, one could have </P>

<P> ibm.com.us -- IBM</P>

<P> sbc.org.us -- The Southern Baptist Coalition</P>

<P> etc.</P>

<P>However, I do think that there needs to be a clear requirement for</P>

<P>registering under these domains.  Otherwise, we will end up</P>

<P>'bobs-garage.com.us', which is not appropriate.</P>


<P>Thirdly, I think that a careful look needs to be taken at how the .us</P>

<P>domain is distributed.  For example, if I want to create an entry in the</P>

<P>.newport-news.va.us subdomain, I have to go through the Network</P>

<P>Administrator at NASA Langley.  While the gentleman in question is a</P>

<P>hard-working and extremely competent engineer, he is extremely busy with</P>

<P>other duties.  This makes the turn around on new domains in excess of a</P>

<P>week.  To be manually entering new entries is ridiculous: that's why we</P>

<P>have Web based forms and email.  So, my third recommendation: I think</P>

<P>that .us domain needs to have a central registry, similar to InterNIC,</P>

<P>and that all domain registrations happen centrally.  Then, appropriate</P>

<P>domain files can be propagated out as necessary.  However, the important</P>

<P>thing is that this should happen totally electronically without</P>

<P>requiring human intervention except in extreme cases.  This kind of</P>

<P>system has been done many times before, and should be extremely simple</P>

<P>to setup.  I have setup similar systems in the past in less than a</P>

<P>couple of days.</P>


<P>Finally, I think that a careful examination needs to be made of whom you</P>

<P>are delegating authority over localities to.  Furthermore, I think that</P>

<P>the number of delegations needs to be reduced.  Many of the delegated</P>

<P>authorities are not as conscientious as my friend at Langley, and many</P>

<P>of them charge what seem to be exhorbitant rates.</P>


<P>All of the recommendations mentioned above are additions to the current</P>

<P>domain structure. Hence, they could be setup while not affecting current</P>

<P>.us registrants at all. </P>


<P>Thanks for you attention, and if I can be of any assistance, please feel</P>

<P>free to contact me.</P>

<P><STRONG>Subject: </STRONG>	The .us domain space.</P>


<P>For what my opinion is worth, I think that the organizational management</P>

<P>of domains by adding the .us toplevel domain.  I feel that it is an</P>

<P>infringement of the freedom that already exists on the internet.  Where I</P>

<P>note that there are certain benefits and I realize that a lot of the</P>

<P>development of the internet structure has come through the government, I</P>

<P>don't feel that it is necessary to include this expansion.</P>

<P><STRONG>Subject: </STRONG>	Comments re Enhancement of the .us Domain Space</P>


<P>Re: http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/domainname/usrfc/dotusrfc.htm</P>

<P>Contents: ASCII</P>


<P>I most fervently urge that you reconsider any further</P>

<P>semantic enhancement of the Domain Name System.</P>

<P>Instead, the use of meaningful second-level names should</P>

<P>be eliminated entirely as soon as is practical.</P>

<P>For resolution of meaningful names, site locations,</P>

<P>site types, etc., we should rely not on the DNS but on</P>

<P>third-party LDAP-enabled portals and directory caches.</P>


<P>Suppose, e.g., we were to:</P>

<P> 1. establish a new TLD .g and fund its name registrars;</P>

<P> 2. allocate to every existing and future generic-nameholder</P>

<P>a randomly-chosen, durable, alphameric name axxxxx.g;</P>

<P> 3. require that issuers of .g names elaborate their</P>

<P>whois databases with links to nameholders' directories,</P>

<P>should nameholders choose to provide them;</P>

<P> 4. require that domestic .g issuers make their whois</P>

<P>databases available to all at reasonable fees;</P>

<P> 4. ensure that DNS performance via domestic generic TLD</P>

<P>servers begins to suffer in 2002.</P>


<P>Would you not agree that we would see a multiplicity of</P>

<P>independent directory services who compete on quality and</P>

<P>offer free or inexpensive resolution of .g names and/or</P>

<P>protocol addresses by name, location, classification of</P>

<P>entity and other useful criteria?  Would we not see</P>

<P>directory caches at interchanges and within intranets?</P>

<P>Relatively simple direct hardware implementations of .g</P>

<P>servers will be possible. And foremost: We will be absolved</P>

<P>of most of the concerns of this RFC as well as the legal,</P>

<P>political, architectural and financial consequences we have</P>

<P>suffered under our system of meaningful second-level names.</P>


<P>The existing system served us well until a two or three</P>

<P>years ago. But now that meaningful names have become scarce</P>

<P>and a needless source of argument, their use should be</P>

<P>discouraged rather than embellished. They cannot be enhanced.</P>
