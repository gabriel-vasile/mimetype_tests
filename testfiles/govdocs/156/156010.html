<H1 CLASS="CENTER">More About Commas</H1>

<P>
More about commas? Given the wealth of information about commas presented in
the <A HREF="WEEK50.htm">last Word of the Week article</A>
, this is a fair question.
</P>

<P>
NASA Langley&#39;s Grammar, Punctuation, and 
Capitalization: A Handbook for Technical Writers and Editors 
,<SUP>1</SUP> referenced in our last article, noted that &quot;the
primary functions of the comma are to separate and to enclose the elements of a
sentence.&quot; In our last article we dealt with commas that separate, now we
will focus on commas that enclose.
</P>

<P>
It is standard form to omit commas whenever possible--so long as there is no
danger of ambiguity when you do so. However, it&#39;s much easier to
comfortably omit a comma when you are sure of the rules for the use of commas.
Follow the links in the headings below for more detailed
explanations <SUP>1</SUP> of commas that enclose the elements of a
sentence.
</P>

<P>
The most important thing to remember about commas that enclose (other than
when to use them) is that an enclosing comma must always have a partner. The
partner does not need to be another comma; it can be a colon, semicolon,
period, question mark, or exclamation mark.

<H2>Nonrestrictive Modifiers</H2>
<P>
&quot;A nonrestrictive modifier does not affect the meaning of the basic
sentence; it could be removed from the sentence without altering
meaning.&quot;<SUP>1</SUP>
</P>

<P>
Here a comma and period enclose:
</P>

<P>
Materials for the spacecraft were mainly selected on the basis of
availability, cost, weight, and reliability, <EM>which relegated color to a
back-burner position</EM>.
</P>

<P>
In the following sentence, two commas enclose the nonrestrictive modifier:
</P>

<P>
NASA&#39;s largest launch vehicle, <EM>which is as tall as a 20-story
building</EM>, weighs about 2 million pounds.
</P>

<H2>Appositives</H2>

<P>
An appositive is another way of referring to something or someone. In the
following sentence, &quot;our new postal carrier&quot; is an appositive.
</P>

<P>
&quot;Sam, <EM>our new postal carrier</EM>, is always on schedule.&quot;
</P>

<P>
Commas are used to set off words used as appositives or contrasts:
</P>

<P>
Hydrogen, <EM>the cryogenic fluid of choice</EM>, is the most difficult
cryogenic fluid to handle.
</P>

<P>
The next sentence gives an example of a contrasting phrase:
</P>

<P>
This approach provides simple, <EM>yet highly reliable</EM>, temperature
control for all situations.
</P>

<H2>Interrupting Elements</H2>

<P>
Nonrestrictive phrases, such as parenthetical phrases, rhetorical adverbs,
introductory words, and antithetical phrases, are usually set off by commas.
</P>

<P>
The design constraints imposed by the Martian environment, <EM>such as
those listed previously</EM>, can greatly affect the shape of the aircraft.
</P>

<P>
The elapsed time between tests was uniform; <EM>however</EM>, the test times
varied widely.
</P>

<H2>Phrases With Common Termination</H2>
<P>
A phrase with termination that reads back to a previous phrase is enclosed
with commas:
</P>

<P>
The static pressure measurement at three of these stations, <EM>if not
all</EM>, is anticipated to be the same.
</P>

<P>
The experiment panels should be as cold as, <EM>if not colder than</EM>, the
control panels.
</P>

<H2>Nominative Absolutes</H2>

<P>
A phrase that has a noun modified by a participle and which is
grammatically unconnected with the rest of the sentence is a nominative
(subjective) absolute. Such phrases, which are nonrestrictive, usually tell
when, why, or how something happened.
</P>

<P>
All four bottles were decoupled from the mainframe, <EM>the radiative
decoupling of the main tank already having been performed</EM>.
</P>

<P>
<EM>The fuel having already been selected</EM>, we concentrated on finding a
suitable engine.
</P>


<H2>Conventional Uses of the Comma</H2>

<P>
There are many conventional uses of the comma, such as in dates (February
26, 1998), geographical names (Cleveland, Ohio), names (Dr. Martin Luther King,
Jr.), and addresses. One such use, often debated in technical work, is the
comma that is used to separate thousands in numbers of five or more digits
(34,566). Our style at NASA Lewis is to separate these numbers by a space (34
566) because in some countries the comma indicates a decimal point. Follow the
link in this section for a good refresher on such uses of the comma.
