<p>Before carbon modelers can "borrow" ARM data to use for their own
purposes, they need to have a general understanding of both the conceptual
philosophy of the ARM experimental design and the hierarchical
terminology used with ARM datasets.</p>

<h2><strong>Spatial Organization and Sampling Design for ARM Data</strong></h2>

<p>Data generated by ARM represent a single geographic point rather than
a geographic line or area.  Consistent with its mission to support and
improve climate modeling, all ARM points at a single site are meant to
represent a single cell of a General Circulation Model (GCM).  Most GCMs
simulate the atmosphere as a series of <a href="./single_column.jpg"
target="_new">"single columns" with vertical structure located above
a cell location on the earth's surface</a>.  Although the atmosphere
is dynamic, the ARM instruments will always sample the same conceptual
column which is represented in many popular GCM models.  At the SGP
site, the ARM sampling design places instruments within both the "core"
of the conceptual single cell (with central, intermediate, and extended
facilities) and areas just outside the boundaries of the GCM cell
(boundary facilities).</p>

<p>The geographic locations sampled by ARM are structured in a two-level
hierarchy:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="./armsitemap.jpg" target="_new">Sites</a> - large-scale "single column"
locations in the Southern Great Plains (SGP), Tropical Western Pacific
(TWP), and North Slope of Alaska (NSA).  The TWP and NSA sites are
conceptually ONLY central facilities.</li>

<li>Facilities - similar instrument installations
at different geographic locations within a site. The <a
href="http://www.arm.gov/images/sgpmapsiting.jpg" target="_new">SGP
site</a> has central, extended, boundary, and intermediate
facilities. The <a href="./twpmapsiting.jpg" target="_new">TWP site</a> has
installations on <a href="./manus.jpg" target="_new">Manus</a> and <a href="./nauru_pres.jpg" target="_new">Nauru</a>
Islands.  A third site for operational staging is now implemented
at <a href="./darwin_map.jpg" target="_new">Darwin, Australia</a>. The <a
href="./nsamapsiting.jpg" target="_new">NSA site</a> includes installations at Barrow
and Atqasuk.</li> </ol>

<p>The SGP site may be of particular interest to carbon modelers,

<h2><strong>Recognizing ARM Data Uses in Carbon Models</strong></h2>

<p>ARM data have the potential to improve estimates of carbon cycle fluxes
and pools affected by <a href="./carbfig.jpg" target="_new">exchanges
between the atmosphere and the land surface</a>, especially vegetation,
soil, and detritus.  In addition to standard meteorological forcing
variables, ARM measures many aspects of the <a href="./radiation_pres.jpg"
target="_new">radiation budget</a> as <a href="./nsdlparameters11.png" target="_new">solar energy passes through the
atmosphere to reach the land surface</a>, including longwave and shortwave
direct and diffuse radiation, and latent and sensible heat.  All of
these measurements reflect parameters which affect vegetation and
decomposition.</a>

<h2>Use of ARM Measurements as Forcing or Driver Variables</h2>

<p>Perhaps the most obvious potential use for ARM data is to provide
<italic>measured</italic> rather than estimated meteorological data
which can be used to "drive" carbon cycle simulations.  Most carbon
simulations require weather data, which they use as "forcing" functions to
control photosynthesis, respiration, decomposition, and other important
carbon fluxes.  Daily or hourly meteorological inputs are often needed,
although the internal calculation timesteps used in these models may be
even faster.</p>

<p>The following table shows a number of ARM data types that are clearly
well-suited for use as <strong>driver</strong> or <strong>forcing</strong>
variables in carbon models.<br>

<br>

<p>One complication with using ARM meteorlological data as forcing
functions for carbon models is that ARM facilites do not duplicate
the measurement of basic surface meteorological observations
(<a href="http://www.arm.gov/instruments/static/smos.stm"
target="_new">SMOS</a>) if there is a meteorological station operated
by another agency, the <a href="http://okmesonet.ocs.ou.edu/overview"
target="_new">Oklahoma MESONET</a> or the <a href="http://www.xdc.arm.gov/docs/data_info/release_forms/sgp60ksumesob1.release.html" target="_new">Kansas MESONET</a>, located within 20 km.
The Oklahoma and Kansas MESONET networks are subscription services, and require a paid
account to obtain data.  Carbon modelers wishing to use ARM data at
certain locations would ordinarily have to subscribe, then obtain and
merge appropriate data from these external sources to build a complete
matrix of driver measurements.  As part of this project, we have
prepared and are distributing <a href="../dataproducts/dataproducts.html"
target="_new">statistical summarizations of such merged data products</a>
which are ready for immediate use as meteorological driver variables in
carbon simulations.</p>

<p>The table below shows ARM facilities which do not measure surface meteorology, and the closest MESONET site which must be substituted:</p>

<h2>Use of ARM Measurements for Validation and Comparison</h2>

<p>ARM also measures a number of parameters which are commonly estimated
internally by carbon models.  A less-obvious but more interesting
possibility is the use of ARM data as an external validation for internal
algorithms present in carbon models.  Rather than being used as input or
driver data, ARM data are used in this capacity as a standard against
which algorithms simulating important intermediate processes can be
independently tested, evaluated, and tuned.  Our research group has
expertise with such <a href="./jager.pdf" target="_new">validation of
models with observed data</a>.</p>

<p>Several candidates for such validation and comparison exist within
the ARM data collection:</p>

<UL>
<LI>Latent heat, as measured by the <a
href="http://www.arm.gov/instruments/static/ebbr.stm"
target="_new">Energy-Balance Bowen Ratio (EBBR)</a> instrumentation<br>

<p>Latent heat is the energy transported away from the surface by
evaporating water, sensible heat is the energy transported from the land
surface by air movement (convection), and soil/water heat is the heat that
goes into changing the temperature of the soil or the water standing on
the land surface.  The difference between net radiation and soil/water
heat is the energy transported upward by sensible heat and latent heat.
The Bowen ratio is the ratio of sensible heat to latent heat.  The energy
budget can then be written in terms of the Bowen ratio to solve directly
for latent heat.  The latent heat can be used to obtain estimates of
evapotranspiration, a value computed internally in most carbon cycle
models.</p></LI>

<LI>Soil moisture and temperature, which are directly
measured through a soil depth profile by the ARM <a
href="http://www.arm.gov/instruments/static/swats.stm"
target="_new">Soil Water and Temperature System (SWATS)</a><br>

<p>It is usually necessary for models to estimate depth profiles of
soil moisture and temperature, and these estimates can be compared
to ARM measured values to gauge the accuracy of this portion of the
simulations.  Go <a href="./Soil-webpage.html">here for links to soil temperature and moisture data sets designed and prepared for such model validation</a>.</p></LI>

<LI>it may be possible to
generate from ARM radiation measurements a partitioning of radiation into
visible/near-infrared and direct/diffuse radiative components, including
photosynthetically-active radiation (PAR) and photon flux density.</LI>

</UL>

<h2>Use of ARM Measurements to Reduce Simulation "Spin-up" Time</h2>

<p>Many carbon simulations must be run for a prolonged period
<italic>prior to</italic> the actual period for which output results
are desired.  Such model "spin-up" is required to allow all compartments
and fluxes to come to relative equilibrium before the desired simulation
interval is reached.  Without a sufficiently long spin-up period,
initial outputs may contain strange transient values or show unusual
trajectories until equilibrium is initially achieved.</p>

<p>Spin-up can consume significant time, effort, and computational
resources.  Often it is soil compartments which are the slowest to come
into equilibrium.  Depth profiles of soil temperature and soil moisture
are difficult to initially set, and, because of their slow response, may
be among the last to equilibrate.  The ARM Archive contains measurements
of soil moisture and temperature through a depth profile, as part of
the <a href="http://www.arm.gov/instruments/static/swats.stm"
target="_new">Soil Water and Temperature System (SWATS)</a> instruments.
It may ultimately be possible to reduce or eliminate simulation spin-up
time by using ARM SWATS measurements to initialize soil water and
temperature profiles more accurately.</p>

<h2><strong>Review of Frequently Used Global Carbon Models</strong></h2>

<P>To guide the identification of ARM data suitable for use with carbon
models (as either drivers or comparison), we reviewed several popular
models for input and comparison data needs. The carbon simulation models
described below simulate carbon, nutrient (primarily nitrogen), and water
cycles in terrestrial ecosystems.  Environmental variables influence
processes such as photosynthesis, decomposition, microbial nutrient
transformations, and water fluxes. Predictions include net primary
productivity (NPP), net nitrogen mineralization, evapotranspiration
fluxes, and storage of carbon and nitrogen in vegetation and in soil.</P>

<P>Most carbon models can be run in equilibrium or transient mode. When
run in equilibrium mode, the models assume that all carbon and nitrogen
fluxes are balanced and that annual carbon and nitrogen inputs to
the ecosystem are equal to annual losses.  When the models are run in
transient mode, annual net ecosystem production (NEP) changes in response
to transient climate and atmospheric CO<SUB>2</SUB> concentration.
In the absence of disturbances, annual NEP (equals NPP minus heterotrophic
respiration) represents the net annual CO<SUB>2</SUB> flux between the
atmosphere and the terrestrial biosphere.  Terrestrial ecosystems act
as a sink of atmospheric CO<SUB>2</SUB> when NEP is positive and act as
a source of CO<SUB>2</SUB> when NEP is negative.</P>

<p>Many of the more advanced carbon models also have two spatial modes:
point-based, or single location mode, and area-based mode, which produces
a continuous raster grid of values.  Although we are starting our
investigations using carbon models to simulate single spatial points,
we have plans to move to spatial grid simulation mode as this project
progresses.  Input data for models running in grid mode must themselves
be in a spatial grid format, necessitating interpolation between actual
measurement locations.</p>

<h2><strong>Carbon Models Reviewed</strong></h2>

<OL>
  <LI><p><A HREF="BIOME-BGC.html" target="_new">Biome-BGC</A><br>
The Biome-BGC (BioGeochemical Cycles) model simulates NPP for multiple
biomes.  Because NPP is computed as the difference between simulated GPP
and autotrophic respiration, environmental controls operate on both the
process of photosynthesis and respiration.  Although nitrogen dynamics
have been added, Biome-BGC relies primarily on the hydrologic cycle
and how water availability controls C uptake and storage. The response
of NPP to elevated CO<SUB>2</SUB> is determined mainly by changes in
transpiration associated with reduced leaf conductance, rather than
feedbacks from nutrient cycling.  Biome-BGC has a daily time step and
no explicit spatial scale.  The model has an intermediate number of
vegetation (4) and litter/soil (3) pools.</LI></p>

  <LI><p><A HREF="CENTURY.html" target="_new">Century</A><br>
The CENTURY model simulates carbon, nutrient, and water dynamics
for different types of ecosystems.   CENTURY includes a soil organic
matter/decomposition sub-model, a water budget sub-model, two plant
production sub-models (grassland and forest), and functions for
scheduling events.  The model computes flows of carbon, nitrogen,
and (optionally), phosphorus, and sulfur through model compartments.
The four elements have identical organic matter structure, but they
differ in inorganic compounds.  Carbon uptake in CENTURY is controlled
primarily by nitrogen availability.  A grassland/crop sub-model and
a forest production sub-model assume that the monthly maximum plant
production is controlled by moisture and temperature, and that maximum
plant production rates depend on the availability of nutrients. The
CENTURY model uses a monthly time step. This model has the finest
partitioning of soil/litter (15) and vegetation (8) pools.</LI></p>

  <LI><p><A HREF="TEM.html" target="_new">TEM</A><br>
The Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (TEM) is a process-based ecosystem
model that describes carbon and nitrogen dynamics of plants and soils
for terrestrial ecosystems.  This model simulates limitation of GPP by
multiple factors.  Because plant respiration is explicitly modeled, NPP
is simulated as the difference between GPP and carbon respiration. TEM
explicitly simulates nitrogen mineralization and immobilization dynamics.
However, TEM does not consider the influence of vapor pressure deficit
on stomatal conductance or photosynthesis.  The TEM uses spatially
referenced information on climate, elevation, soils, vegetation and water
availability as well as soil- and vegetation-specific parameters to make
monthly estimates of carbon and nitrogen fluxes and pool sizes. The
response of NPP to elevated CO<SUB>2</SUB> in TEM is controlled by
the control of nitrogen availability on carbon uptake and storage.
TEM operates on a monthly time step. The TEM model is viewed as a global
model with a spatial resolution of 0.5 degrees latitude/longitude. This
model uses the relatively few compartments, with only one carbon pool
each for vegetation and soil/litter (two for nitrogen).</LI></p>

  <LI><p><A HREF="PNET.html" target="_new">PnET</A><br>
The PnET models provide a nested set of modular approaches to simulating
the carbon, water and nitrogen dynamics of forest ecosystems. The
different versions of PnET are modular and build out from simplest to
most complex. Algorithms such as photosynthesis are identical among
model versions.  PnET-Day uses foliar mass, specific leaf weight, foliar
N concentration, temperature and radiation flux to predict daily gross
and net photosynthesis of whole forest canopies.  PnET-II adds carbon
allocation and respiration terms, as well as a full water balance to
predict NPP, transpiration and runoff. An empirical soil respiration
terms allows prediction of total ecosystem carbon balance under ambient
conditions. This version is used to predict the combined effects
of climate change and increased atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> on these processes.
PnET-CN adds compartments for woody biomass and soil organic matter, as
well as algorithms for biomass turnover and litter and soil decomposition
to allow calculation of complete carbon and nitrogen cycles.  The original
PnET uses a monthly timestep.   PnET-Day uses a daily timestep.  The PnET
models do not have an explicit spatial scale, but they are viewed as
regional.</LI></p>

  <LI><p><A HREF="LoTEC.html" target="_new">LoTEC</A><br>
LoTEC is a mechanistic soil-plant-atmosphere model of ecosystem
carbon storage and CO<SUB>2</SUB> and H<SUB>2</SUB>O flux. Canopy
photosynthesis is described by a "Bigleaf" implementation of either
a C3 or C4 biochemical model of photosynthesis combined with a
sub-model of stomatal conductance. Maintenance respiration for four
plant compartments is a function of tissue nitrogen concentration and
temperature, while growth respiration is proportional to the change in
compartment size.  Canopy photosynthesis and maintenance respiration are
calculated hourly. Carbon allocation, growth, and growth respiration are
calculated daily.  Litter and soil carbon dynamics are simulated with
a monthy time step.  The spatial scale of the model is a half-degree
grid cell.  This model uses the empirical Miami model, including a
factor that represents the response to changing CO<SUB>2</SUB>, as a
basis for estimating steady-state NPP instead of the Farquahar model or
other process-based models.  Because rubisco-limited photosynthesis is
not simulated, use of LoTEC is best justified when light is the limiting
factor.  A complete run generally requires three phases of simulation:
spin-up, historical, and future.</LI></p>

  <LI><p><A HREF="SiBD.html" target="_new">SiBD</A><br>
The Simple Biosphere 2 (SiB2) model can simulate local and regional
scale land-surface energy, momentum and mass fluxes using observed
forcing ("off-line" mode), or serve as the land surface component of a
General Circulation Model (GCM).  The strength of SiB2 is its vegetation
modeling, with dynamic treatment of LAI based on remote-sensed imagery.
Meteorology driver data are typically provided at 30-min. intervals.
Model results can be provided with a high (seconds) or low (monthly)
temporal resolution.  The spatial scale of each model simulation is a
local canopy, but global simulations can be made by providing separate
inputs for each location in a grid.  The SiBD model was developed for
integration with GCMs.  SiBD allows dynamic vegetation to be simulated
driven by satellite-derived global data of vegetation phenology.
The soil hydrological parameterization has been modified to give
more-reliable calculations of inter-layer exchange within the soil
profile.  SiBD simulates gradual changes in surface temperature and
reflectance as the amount of snow varies.</LI></p>

<br>

<p>Many of the data needed can be summarized or directly obtained from the
ARM data collection. Other data have been recorded as metadata during the
implementation or operation of the Sites.  Some needed input measurements
associated with vegetation or land use are not contained in the ARM
archive.  Parameters listed in bold represent summaries or measurements
that cannot be directly obtained from the ARM data collection.</P>

<h2><strong>The Problem of Gaps in Data Measurement Streams</strong></h2>

<p>Most models do not contain logic to handle missing data.  Data
products designed for use as input to models must be complete (i.e., have a
value for every parameter for every time step), yet every practical
dataset contains times when measurements were unable to be recorded.
<a href="../gapfilling/gapfilling.html" target="_new">Another phase
of this project</a> is dedicated to the development and evaluation of
intelligent gap-filling techniques to fill these measurement gaps.

<h2><strong>Collaborating with Carbon Modelers to Assess Their Needs</strong></h2>

<p>In order to better understand their needs, we are working
closely with leading carbon modelers.  We have retained
<a href="http://www.nrel.colostate.edu/people/niall.html"
target="_new">Dr. Niall Hanan</a>, at Colorado State University
and NREL, to give us feedback as we develop products designed
to enhance applicability of ARM data to carbon modeling.  We are
also in contact with Dr. Ian Baker, a postdoctoral fellow working
with <a href="http://biocycle.atmos.colostate.edu/~denning/"
target ="_new">Dr. Scott Denning at CSU</a>.  <a
href="http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/tss/staff/thornton/thornton.html"
target="_new">Dr. Peter Thornton</a>, now working at NCAR, has given us
advice on MT-CLIM, one of the synthetic weather generators used in <a
href="../dataassess/dataassess.html" target="_new">our Make-a-Difference
experiment</a>.

<p><a href="http://esd.lbl.gov/ESD_staff/torn/" target="_new">Margaret
Torn</a>, a member of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
<a href="http://www-esd.lbl.gov/GEO/staff/torn.shtml"
target="_new">Geochemistry Department Staff</a>, is the acting
Program Leader for <a href="http://esd.lbl.gov/ARMCarbon/" target="new_">our sister project, "Design and Implementation of
Carbon Measurements at the ARM Southern Great Plains Site"</a>, which
is part of the LBNL <a href="http://www-esd.lbl.gov/CLIMATE/GCCB/"
target="_new">Global Change and Carbon Biogeochemistry Program</a>.
<a href="http://eetd.lbl.gov/env/mlf/" target="_new">Dr. Marc
Fischer</a> assists with this LBNL project, and helps to coordinate
it with our ORNL efforts.  We have also been in contact with <a
href="http://carnegiedpb.stanford.edu/research/research_berry.php"
target="_new">Dr. Joseph Berry</a>, who assists with
several fixed and portable CO<sub>2</sub> eddy flux towers
operating at an ARM CART site as part of the LBNL project.
<a href="http://www.esd.ornl.gov/people/king/king.html"
target="_new">Dr. Tony King</a> and <a
href="http://www.esd.ornl.gov/~wmp/" target="_new">Dr. Mac Post</a>
are carbon modelers here at the Environmental Science Division (and
creators of the <a href="./LoTEC.html" target="_new">LoTEC model</a>)
with whom we consult regularly.</p>

<p>In July 2002, one of us (Hargrove) attended a <a
href="http://www.ntsg.umt.edu/MODISCon/index.html"
target="_new">workshop on the MODIS sensor</a>, organized by
<a href="http://www.ntsg.umt.edu/~swr/default.htm"
target="_new">Dr. Steve Running</a> at the University of
Montana-Missoula (home of the Biome-BGC model).  Hargrove presented a <a
href="http://www.ntsg.umt.edu/MODISCon/html/posters.html"
target="_new">poster</a> and gave a <a href="./WilliamHargrove.mov"
target="_new">brief interview (Quicktime movie)</a>.  Already available
on the Terra and Aqua satellite platforms, MODIS data will provide for
the first time global 1 km<sup>2</sup> estimates of LAI, fPAR, PSN and
NPP as often as once a day.  These products are certain to become central
data in carbon models of the future.</p>

<p>Presently, carbon modelers are involved in intensive efforts
to validate these derived MODIS products.  One such validation
effort, <a href="http://www.fsl.orst.edu/larse/bigfoot/"
target="_new">Bigfoot</a>, is being led by Dr. David P. Turner, at
Oregon State, <a href="http://forest.wisc.edu/facstaff/gower.html"
target="_new">Dr. S. Tom Gower, at Wisconsin-Madison</a>, and
Dr. Warren B. Cohen, at the PNW Research Station.  Bigfoot is a
NASA-funded project which is comparing MODIS products to intensive
ground measurements taken at nine 5km x 5km sites which are centered
on a CO<sub>2</sub> eddy flux tower.  The MODIS/ground comparison
is <a href="http://www.fsl.orst.edu/larse/bigfoot/data.html"
target="_new">completed for four of the sites</a>.</p>

<p>We have suggested the possibility of establishing an NACP intensive
within the ARM Cart area.  While this makes scientific
sense, the cross-agency nature of such a collaboration might prove
challenging.  Nevertheless, the <a href="../upgrades.html"
target="_new">increased role of ARM in national carbon monitoring</a>
would make the location of an NACP intensive at the ARM CART
a clear choice.  We prepared a <a href="./review.html">favorable review in strong support</a> of the <a href="http://www.carboncyclescience.gov/nacp-intensive-wp-006.pdf">original whitepaper suggesting this possibility</a>.</p>

<p>Such participation (and the ground sampling that would be involved)
would help with another future goal of our project, which is to spatially
interpolate ARM "spot" measurements into continuous spatial coverage
grid maps.  Such spatially continuous maps of input variables will be
necessary to supply carbon models not running in simple point mode with
the requisite input data.  Preparing spatial data products which modelers
can easily use to run carbon models in this spatially explicit area mode
will be another way to attract carbon modelers to use the data held in
the ARM archive.</p>

<p>We are also considering the possibility of hosting or sponsoring
a National Workshop for carbon modelers interested in using data from
the ARM archive.  This idea, still in the planning stages, would be to
gather researchers interested in carbon modeling, present results from
the MAD framework, and sponsor "hands-on" laboratories to help carbon
modelers work with ARM data.</p>
