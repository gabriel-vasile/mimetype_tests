Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Determination of&nbsp;
Threatened Status for Chlorogalum purpureum (Purple Amole), a Plant&nbsp;
From the South Coast Ranges of California

AGENCY: Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.

ACTION: Final rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, determine threatened&nbsp;
status pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended&nbsp;
(Act), for the California plant, Chlorogalum purpureum (purple amole).&nbsp;
This species comprises two varieties, C. p. var. purpureum and C. p.&nbsp;
var. reductum. Chlorogalum purpureum var. purpureum is known only from&nbsp;
the south coast ranges in Monterey County, on lands managed by the&nbsp;
Department of the Army at Fort Hunter Liggett. It is threatened by loss&nbsp;
and alteration of habitat, direct loss of plants from construction and&nbsp;
use of military training facilities and from military field training&nbsp;
activities, displacement by nonnative annual grasses, and potentially&nbsp;
by alteration of fire cycles due to military training. Livestock&nbsp;
grazing is a potential threat, as grazing may be reinstated in occupied&nbsp;
habitat in the future. The other variety, C. p. var. reductum, is known&nbsp;
only from two sites in the La Panza region of the coast ranges in San&nbsp;
Luis Obispo County, on U.S. Forest Service and private lands. It is&nbsp;
threatened by illegal vehicle trespass into the population on Forest&nbsp;
Service land, road maintenance, displacement by nonnative annual&nbsp;
grasses, and by livestock grazing depending upon the intensity of&nbsp;
grazing use within the population area. This final rule implements the&nbsp;
Federal protection and recovery provisions afforded by the Act.&nbsp;
Although this rule lists Chlorogalum purpureum at the species level,&nbsp;
each variety should be treated as a separate taxonomic unit for the&nbsp;
purposes of applying the section 7 jeopardy standard and identifying&nbsp;
recovery units, if applicable.

DATES: This rule is effective April 19, 2000.

ADDRESSES: The complete file for this rule is available for inspection,&nbsp;
by appointment, during normal business hours at the Ventura Fish and&nbsp;
Wildlife Office, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2493 Portola Road,&nbsp;
Suite B, Ventura, California 93003.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chlorogalum purpureum was first described by Brandegee in 1893 from&nbsp;
specimens collected in the Santa Lucia Mountains by William Vortriede a&nbsp;
year earlier (Brandegee 1893). In 1904, E.L. Greene (1904) published&nbsp;
the new combination Laothoe purpurea when he discovered that the genus&nbsp;
name Laothoe had been published earlier than Chlorogalum. However, R.F.&nbsp;
Hoover (1940) reinstated use of the name Chlorogalum through the rule&nbsp;
of nomen conservandum. Hoover (1964) described the variety reductum&nbsp;
(Camatta Canyon amole), first collected in the late 1940s, based on its&nbsp;
shorter stature compared to the nominative variety. This nomenclature&nbsp;
was retained in the most recent treatment of the genus (Jernstedt&nbsp;
1993). These two varieties comprise the entire species.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chlorogalum purpureum is a bulb-forming perennial herb in the lily&nbsp;
family (Liliaceae). It has a basal rosette of linear leaves 2 to 5&nbsp;
millimeters (mm) (0.1 to 0.2 inches (in)) wide with wavy margins. A&nbsp;
widely branching stem supports bluish-purple flowers with six recurved&nbsp;
tepals (petals and sepals that have a similar appearance). The stems of&nbsp;
C. p. var. purpureum are 25 to 40 centimeters (cm) (10 to 16 in) high,&nbsp;
whereas those of C. p. var. reductum are only 10 to 20 cm (4 to 8 in)&nbsp;
high (Hoover 1964, Jernstedt 1993). Chlorogalum purpureum is the only&nbsp;
member of the genus with bluish-purple flowers that open during the day&nbsp;
(Jernstedt 1993).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reproduction in Chlorogalum purpureum is primarily by seed. Each&nbsp;
flower contains six ovules, although not all develop into seeds in the&nbsp;
wild (Hoover 1964). The species is reported to be self-compatible, and&nbsp;
insect pollination appears to result in increased seed set (D. Wilken,&nbsp;
Santa Barbara Botanic Garden, in litt. 1998; M. Elvin, U.S. Fish and&nbsp;
Wildlife Service, pers. com. 1998). Hoover (1940) reports that clonal&nbsp;
reproduction by longitudinal splitting of the bulbs is rare; some&nbsp;
splitting has been noted in one population of C. p. var. reductum&nbsp;
(Alice Koch, California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG), pers. comm.&nbsp;
1997b).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chlorogalum purpureum occurs in grassland, oak woodland, and oak&nbsp;
savannah between 300 and 620 meters (m) (1,000 and 2,050 feet (ft)) in&nbsp;
elevation in the south coast ranges of California. Like other members&nbsp;
of the lily family, C. purpureum is probably mycorrhizal (develops&nbsp;
root-hyphae relationships with a fungus).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mycorrhizal relationships can aid in nutrient and water uptake by a&nbsp;
host plant and can alter growth and competitive interactions between&nbsp;
species (Allen 1991).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chlorogalum purpureum var. purpureum is known from oak woodlands&nbsp;
and grasslands at three sites near Jolon in Monterey County on lands&nbsp;
owned and managed by the Department of the Army (Fort Hunter Liggett).&nbsp;
Historically, appropriate habitat may have existed east of the base, in&nbsp;
Jolon Valley, but most of the flat areas in that valley have been&nbsp;
converted to cropland, pasture, or vineyards. At Fort Hunter Liggett,&nbsp;
the plant occurs on flat or gently sloping terrain with a gravelly&nbsp;
surface underlain by clay soils, often where other herbaceous&nbsp;
vegetation is sparse.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the three localities of Chlorogalum purpureum var. purpureum,&nbsp;
one comprises discontinuous and fragmented patches of plants scattered&nbsp;
over an area 7 to 9 kilometers (km) (4 to 6 miles (mi)) long and about&nbsp;
5 km (3 mi) wide in the cantonment (housing and administration area),&nbsp;
the Ammunition Supply Point, adjacent Training Area 13, and the&nbsp;
boundary of Training Area 10 (U.S. Army Reserve Command 1996; map&nbsp;
provided by D. Hines, in litt. 1998; Painter and Neese 1998). While&nbsp;
some of the discontinuities in distribution are due to unsuitable&nbsp;
intervening habitat, other patches have been fragmented by roads, the&nbsp;
historical settlement of Jolon, and military training facilities. No&nbsp;
population counts have been made at this site, but estimates of some&nbsp;
areas within it suggest that it supports several thousand plants (U.S.&nbsp;

Department of the Army 1997, Painter and Neese 1998). The second&nbsp;
locality is about 4 km (2.5 mi) to the southeast in Training Area 25.&nbsp;
The taxon is patchily distributed in an area of about 6 square km (2&nbsp;
square mi) that is laced with vehicle tracks and dirt roads. At one&nbsp;
location there, 400 to 500 plants have been recorded (Painter and Neese&nbsp;
1998), but the entire site may support several thousand individuals.&nbsp;
The third and southernmost locality is at the boundaries of Training&nbsp;
Areas 23, 24, and 27. This is the largest known site and contains&nbsp;
plants in high densities. Following a fire that may have

[[Page 14879]]

promoted flowering, this site was estimated to support up to 10,000&nbsp;
plants (Painter and Neese 1998).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The primary threats to Chlorogalum purpureum var. purpureum are the&nbsp;
loss, fragmentation, and alteration of habitat and direct elimination&nbsp;
of plants from construction and use of military training facilities,&nbsp;
military field training activities, displacement by nonnative annual&nbsp;
grasses, and potentially by alteration of fire cycles due to military&nbsp;
training. Livestock grazing and associated habitat changes may threaten&nbsp;
this taxon if grazing is resumed in occupied habitat in the future.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About 110 km (70 mi) to the south, Chlorogalum purpureum var.&nbsp;
reductum occurs in one region in the La Panza Range of San Luis Obispo&nbsp;
County. It is currently known from only two sites. The larger site is&nbsp;
located adjacent to a two-lane State highway; a smaller site is located&nbsp;
approximately 5 to 8 km (3 to 5 mi) farther to the south. The larger&nbsp;
locality is located on a narrow, flat-topped ridge or plateau&nbsp;
supporting blue oak (Quercus douglasii) savannah. This plateau,&nbsp;
bisected by a highway, is probably the remains of an ancient elevated&nbsp;
alluvial terrace (a terrace consisting of material deposited by running&nbsp;
water), most of which has been eroded away by surrounding drainages&nbsp;
that are now 90 to 120 m (300 to 400 ft) below the plateau (H.&nbsp;
Ehrenspeck, in litt. 1994). The soils have been described as well-
drained red clays with a large component of gravel and pebbles (Hoover&nbsp;
1964, Lopez 1992). North of the highway, the population occurs on&nbsp;
private lands. South of the highway, it grows on public lands managed&nbsp;
by the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) on Los Padres National Forest (LPNF).&nbsp;
A few plants may extend into the California Department of&nbsp;
Transportation (Caltrans) right-of-way along the highway. Caltrans has&nbsp;
designated both sides of the highway right-of-way in this area as&nbsp;
Botanical Management Areas. These areas are to be managed for their&nbsp;
special resource values (D. Magney, consulting biologist, pers. comm.&nbsp;
1999).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This population is patchily distributed over the plateau and has&nbsp;
been estimated to occupy just 2 to 3 hectares (ha) (fewer than 8 acres&nbsp;
(ac)) south of the highway and probably somewhat less on the highway's&nbsp;
north side (Gaskin 1990; Lopez 1992; M. Borchert and K. Danielsen,&nbsp;
USFS, pers. comm. 1997). A graded dirt road about 10 m (30 ft) wide&nbsp;
bisects the portion of the population on public land. The road leads to&nbsp;
private inholdings and residences on the LPNF and is bounded on either&nbsp;
side by a pipe barrier that was installed in 1989 or 1990 to prevent&nbsp;
off-highway vehicles (OHVs) from using the site (David Magney,&nbsp;
biological consultant, pers. comm. 1997). A removable portion of the&nbsp;
barrier and a barbed wire section of fence have been routinely breached&nbsp;
by OHVs. Such illegal use was noted to be increasing from 1995 through&nbsp;
1997 (A. Koch, California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG), in litt.&nbsp;
1997a). In 1998, after publication of the proposed rule to list the&nbsp;
species (63 FR 15142), the Forest Service replaced the broken section&nbsp;
of barbed wire fence with a single post barrier and rewelded sections&nbsp;
of broken pipe barrier elsewhere.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because the site north of the highway is on private land, estimates&nbsp;
of abundance or recent information on habitat conditions are not&nbsp;
currently available. Population size estimates south of the highway, on&nbsp;
public lands, have ranged from 1,000 individuals to several hundred&nbsp;
thousand individuals (Borchert 1981, Warner 1991, Borchert et al.&nbsp;
1997). Some of this variability reflects changes in the above-ground&nbsp;
presence of plants, since bulbs may remain dormant during years with&nbsp;
unfavorable growing conditions. Monitoring along a 100 m (330 ft)&nbsp;
transect showed that plant numbers were relatively stable within the&nbsp;
transect between 1991 and 1997 (Borchert et al. 1997). This transect is&nbsp;
not located in an area where vehicle trespass has continued to occur&nbsp;
and is, therefore, not representative of the status of the population&nbsp;
in areas subject to OHV activity. That portion of the population where&nbsp;
the transect is located is accessible to livestock.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second known locality of Chlorogalum purpureum var. reductum&nbsp;
was first documented by botanists in the mid 1990s. It is located 5 to&nbsp;
8 km (3 to 5 mi) south of the LPNF population in an area with similar&nbsp;
soils and topography (David Chipping, California Polytechnic State&nbsp;
University, in litt. 1997). The taxon has been estimated to occupy less&nbsp;
than 0.1 ha (0.25 ac) and consists of several hundred plants in two or&nbsp;
more patches on private land. The landowner has expressed an interest&nbsp;
in the plant and its protection (D. Chipping, in litt. 1997).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chlorogalum purpureum var. reductum is threatened by illegal&nbsp;
vehicle trespass into the larger locality on LPNF.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Livestock use may be detrimental to this taxon depending upon the&nbsp;
intensity of livestock use and the extent to which livestock congregate&nbsp;
in the population area. The effects of livestock grazing on this taxon&nbsp;
need further evaluation.

Previous Federal Action

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Federal Government actions on this species began as a result of&nbsp;
section 12 of the Act, which directed the Secretary of the Smithsonian&nbsp;
Institution to prepare a report on those plants considered to be&nbsp;
endangered, threatened, or extinct in the United States. This report&nbsp;
(House Doc. No. 94-51) was presented to Congress on January 9, 1975,&nbsp;
and included Chlorogalum purpureum var. purpureum and C. p. var.&nbsp;
reductum as endangered. On July 1, 1975, we published a notice in the&nbsp;
Federal Register (40 FR 27823) of our acceptance of the report as a&nbsp;
petition within the context of section 4(c)(2) (petition provisions are&nbsp;
now found in section 4(b)(3) of the Act) and of our intention to review&nbsp;
the status of the plant taxa named therein.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On June 16, 1976, we published a proposed rule in the Federal&nbsp;
Register (41 FR 24523) to determine approximately 1,700 vascular plant&nbsp;
species to be endangered species pursuant to section 4 of the Act. This&nbsp;
list, which included Chlorogalum purpureum var. purpureum and C. p.&nbsp;
var. reductum, was assembled on the basis of comments and data received&nbsp;
by us and by the Smithsonian Institution in response to House Document&nbsp;
No. 94-51 and the July 1, 1975, Federal Register publication. General&nbsp;
comments received in relation to the 1976 proposal were summarized in&nbsp;
an April 26, 1978, Federal Register publication (43 FR 17909). In 1978,&nbsp;
amendments to the Endangered Species Act required that all proposals&nbsp;
over 2 years old be withdrawn.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A 1-year grace period was given to those proposals already more&nbsp;
than 2 years old. Subsequently, on December 10, 1979, we published a&nbsp;
notice (44 FR 70796) of the withdrawal of the portion of the June 16,&nbsp;
1976, proposal that had not been made final, along with four other&nbsp;
proposals that had expired. Chlorogalum purpureum var. purpureum and C.&nbsp;
p. var. reductum were included in that withdrawal notice.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On December 15, 1980, we published an updated Candidate Notice of&nbsp;
Review (NOR) for plants (45 FR 82480). This notice included Chlorogalum&nbsp;
purpureum var. purpureum and C. p. var. reductum as ``category 2&nbsp;
candidates.'' Category 2 candidates were defined as taxa for which we&nbsp;
had data on biological vulnerability and threats indicating that&nbsp;
listing was possibly appropriate, but the data were not sufficient to&nbsp;
support proposed rules. The two Chlorogalum taxa were

[[Page 14880]]

included as category 1 candidates in the revised plant NOR is published&nbsp;
in the Federal Register on September 27, 1985 (50 FR 39526), February&nbsp;
21, 1990 (55 FR 6184), and September 30, 1993 (58 FR 51144). Category 1&nbsp;
candidates were defined as those taxa for which we had on file&nbsp;
sufficient information on biological vulnerability and threats to&nbsp;
support the preparation of listing proposals, but issuance of proposed&nbsp;
rules was precluded by other pending listing proposals of higher&nbsp;
priority. The two Chlorogalum taxa were included as candidates in the&nbsp;
NOR published on February 28, 1996 (61 FR 7596), as well as in the NOR&nbsp;
published on September 19, 1997 (62 FR 49398). The definition formerly&nbsp;
applied to category 1 candidates now applies to candidates as a whole.&nbsp;
On March 30, 1998, we published a proposed rule in the Federal Register&nbsp;
(63 FR 15142) to list Chlorogalum purpureum as threatened.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The processing of this final rule conforms with our fiscal year&nbsp;
2000 listing priority guidance, published in the Federal Register on&nbsp;
October 22, 1999 (64 FR 57114). The guidance establishes the order in&nbsp;
which we will process rulemakings. The guidance calls for giving&nbsp;
highest priority to handling emergency situations (Priority 1). With&nbsp;
the exception of emergency actions, all other listing activities may be&nbsp;
undertaken simultaneously; however, relative priorities for non-
emergency listing actions may be based on the following priority&nbsp;
levels. Processing final decisions on pending proposed listings are&nbsp;
priority 2 actions. Priority 3 actions are the resolution of the&nbsp;
conservation status of species identified as candidates (resulting in a&nbsp;
new proposed rule or a candidate removal). Priority 4 actions are the&nbsp;
processing of 90-day or 12-month administrative findings on petitions.&nbsp;
Critical habitat determinations, which were previously included in&nbsp;
final listing rules published in the Federal Register, may now be&nbsp;
processed separately, in which case stand-alone critical habitat&nbsp;
determinations will be published as notices in the Federal Register.&nbsp;
This final rule is a priority 2 action and is being completed in&nbsp;
accordance with the current listing priority guidance.

Summary of Comments and Recommendations

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the March 30, 1998, proposed rule (63 FR 15142), all interested&nbsp;
parties were requested to submit factual reports or information that&nbsp;
might contribute to development of a final rule. Appropriate Federal&nbsp;
agencies, State agencies, county and city governments, scientific&nbsp;
organizations, and other interested parties were contacted and&nbsp;
requested to provide comments. Newspaper notices inviting public&nbsp;
comment were published in the San Luis Obispo County Telegram-Tribune&nbsp;
on April 2, 1998, and in the Monterey Herald on April 10, 1998. The&nbsp;
comment period closed on May 29, 1998.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nine comments were provided by individuals, organizations, and&nbsp;
agencies on the proposed rule. Six of the commenters supported the&nbsp;
listing, and two commenters opposed it. Several commenters provided&nbsp;
additional technical information that, along with other clarifications,&nbsp;
has been incorporated into the ``Background'' or ``Summary of Factors&nbsp;
Affecting the Species'' sections of this final rule. Issues raised by&nbsp;
commenters, and our response to each, are summarized as follows:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Issue 1: Two commenters noted that Chlorogalum purpureum var.&nbsp;
purpureum is present in old roadbeds and areas that have been used or&nbsp;
disturbed by vehicles. They speculated that disturbance may be&nbsp;
beneficial to the plant; one commenter noted that we did not address&nbsp;
this possibility in the proposed rule.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our response: Observations of flowering Chlorogalum purpureum in&nbsp;
vehicle tracks and scraped areas do exist (Gaskin 1990, Koch 1997).&nbsp;
Because C. purpureum grows from an underground bulb, some mature plants&nbsp;
may be able to survive situations when the above-ground portions are&nbsp;
crushed by vehicles. The reduction in other vegetation may make the&nbsp;
flowering C. purpureum more visible, as even a light cover by annual&nbsp;
grasses can obscure the flowers of this species due to its short&nbsp;
stature. It is also possible that the removal or suppression of&nbsp;
competing vegetation that may occur due to multiple passes of a vehicle&nbsp;
may temporarily make available greater light, water, or nutrient&nbsp;
resources to the surviving C. purpureum plants. Mature C. purpureum&nbsp;
plants may respond to this temporary increase in available resources by&nbsp;
flowering. However, it would be inappropriate to therefore conclude&nbsp;
that the species responds ``favorably'' to disturbance. The type of&nbsp;
``disturbance'' and its effects on all life history stages of the plant&nbsp;
must be considered. For instance, increased flowering has been observed&nbsp;
in many bulb-forming plants following fires (Gill 1977, Zedler and&nbsp;
Zammit 1989). While scraping or vehicle use may mimic the removal of&nbsp;
vegetation that occurs following fires, these activities do not mimic&nbsp;
the other effects of fire (e.g., conversion of thatch and other plant&nbsp;
biomass to ash, alteration of nutrient availability, and soil chemistry&nbsp;
(Gill 1977, Zedler and Zammit 1989)). In addition to crushing or&nbsp;
removal of competing vegetation, vehicle-use in grassland habitats is&nbsp;
also likely to cause soil compaction, loss of cryptogamic crusts, and&nbsp;
introduction and spread of nonnative plant species; damage mycorrhizae;&nbsp;
and crush seedlings, adult rosettes, and flowering stalks. Seedling&nbsp;
establishment of C. purpureum var. reductum in compacted soils is&nbsp;
reduced in comparison to establishment in loosened soils (Koch 1997).&nbsp;
While C. purpureum has evolved in systems that are periodically&nbsp;
``disturbed'' by events such as wildfire, the human-caused&nbsp;
``disturbances'' addressed here do not mimic those with which the plant&nbsp;
has evolved, have many unfavorable effects (as mentioned above), and&nbsp;
take place in an environment where nonnative invasive plants are now&nbsp;
established. We are not aware of any evidence to suggest that vehicle&nbsp;
use, soil surface scraping, and excessive trampling in populations of&nbsp;
C. purpureum would be other than detrimental to their long-term&nbsp;
persistence.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Issue 2: One commenter suggested that quantitative data is&nbsp;
inadequate to support listing Chlorogalum purpureum var. purpureum and&nbsp;
that threats to this taxon discussed in the proposed rule should be&nbsp;
considered only ``potential'' threats. The commenter stated that the&nbsp;
number of documented locations of C. p. var. purpureum has increased,&nbsp;
since 1994, from 5 to about 100, with few documented losses.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our response: The Act requires that we use the best available&nbsp;
scientific information as the basis for our listing decisions. In&nbsp;
addition to published papers in peer-reviewed journals, scientific&nbsp;
reports, letters, and personal correspondence, we consider professional&nbsp;
judgment and expert opinion by knowledgeable biologists in making&nbsp;
decisions. We have assessed the best available information provided by&nbsp;
the Army at Fort Hunter Liggett and by other parties on the activities&nbsp;
occurring in the locations supporting C. p. var. purpureum. While the&nbsp;
Army has been responsive and shown initiative in implementing their&nbsp;
environmental review process and while this may benefit C. p. var.&nbsp;
purpureum and other sensitive plant species, we conclude that the&nbsp;
activities occurring in the populations of C. p. var. purpureum, and&nbsp;
the damage to associated soils and vegetation, are of sufficient&nbsp;
magnitude that the taxon is imperiled and meets the definition of&nbsp;
``threatened'' under the Act. To assess the comment on the number of&nbsp;
locations of C. p. var. purpureum, we compared the data on

[[Page 14881]]

known locations of C. p. var. purpureum submitted by this commenter&nbsp;
with data we had received previously from this commenter and others on&nbsp;
the locations of C. p. var. purpureum and found no substantial&nbsp;
difference, other than how the locations are described. For instance,&nbsp;
in the proposed rule, we described the northern site of C. p. var.&nbsp;
purpureum as patches of plants occurring over an area 7 to 9 km (4 to 6&nbsp;
mi) long, while the commenter has this area mapped as about 60&nbsp;
individual locations. Because many of the patches of C. p. var.&nbsp;
purpureum in this area grow within 100 meters of one another, gene flow&nbsp;
may be occurring between them, and they may function as one or multiple&nbsp;
populations. Therefore, we concluded that it is most appropriate to&nbsp;
describe the distribution of plants in this area as a single&nbsp;
discontinuous locality. Plants had been documented in this locality by&nbsp;
1994.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Issue 3: One commenter stated that the effects of military training&nbsp;
activities on Chlorogalum purpureum var. purpureum are not known and&nbsp;
that no evidence exists that foot traffic resulting from use of the&nbsp;
obstacle course will degrade the C. p. var. purpureum sites. In&nbsp;
response to our observation that no areas where this taxon occurs are&nbsp;
off-limits to training, the commenter stated that eliminating military&nbsp;
training from C. p. var. purpureum localities may not be needed because&nbsp;
the plant is doing well at Fort Hunter Liggett under current&nbsp;
conditions.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our response: We disagree that the plant is doing well at Fort&nbsp;
Hunter Liggett under current conditions. Military training activities,&nbsp;
including field maneuvers, occur in the populations of Chlorogalum&nbsp;
purpureum var. purpureum. Their effects are most evident in the&nbsp;
locality in Training Area 25. Field maneuvers typically involve tracked&nbsp;
and wheeled vehicles, placement of temporary housing (tents) for&nbsp;
troops, digging of latrines, protection berms or bunkers, and use by&nbsp;
hundreds of troops (U.S. Army Reserve Command 1996). Field maneuvers&nbsp;
and bivouacking (temporary encampments) have resulted in soil&nbsp;
compaction, ruts in the soil that alter microhabitat characteristics&nbsp;
(Painter and Neese 1998; D. Steeck, pers. obs. 1998; J. Chesnut,&nbsp;
consulting biologist, in litt. 1998), and loss of most herbaceous&nbsp;
vegetation in areas where troop use is heavy (D. Steeck, pers. obs.&nbsp;
1997, 1998) and may result in direct crushing or trampling of&nbsp;
vegetative or reproductive parts of purple amole. Such activity may&nbsp;
also increase the spread or abundance of nonnative plant species. Other&nbsp;
training activities involve the use of developed facilities, such as&nbsp;
obstacle courses. According to their records (Hormann 1996), the Army&nbsp;
at Fort Hunter Liggett avoided placing individual obstacles for the&nbsp;
obstacle course directly on plants, however the obstacles were placed&nbsp;
within the population. Use of the obstacle course is likely to reduce&nbsp;
seedling establishment through crushing and soil compaction, and the&nbsp;
construction of the course and its use may increase the abundance of&nbsp;
nonnative grasses and weedy species on the site. We conclude that&nbsp;
adequate evidence exists that military training activities, including&nbsp;
field maneuvers and development and use of training facilities such as&nbsp;
the obstacle course, are detrimental to C. p. var. purpureum at Fort&nbsp;
Hunter Liggett.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Issue 4: One commenter stated that, because the historical&nbsp;
distribution of Chlorogalum purpureum var. purpureum is not known, the&nbsp;
extent of fragmentation cannot be known.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our response: We agree that the extent of fragmentation of&nbsp;
Chlorogalum purpureum var. purpureum populations is not known. Patches&nbsp;
of plants may be discontinuous due to differences in soils and&nbsp;
microhabitat conditions, even without human-induced changes to the&nbsp;
landscape. However, in numerous places at Fort Hunter Liggett, plants&nbsp;
occur up to, and on both sides of, a road or other human structure,&nbsp;
strongly suggesting that they were once continuous (for instance,&nbsp;
plants within the ``triangle'' of roads at the entrance gate, those on&nbsp;
both sides of Mission Creek Road and on both sides of the dirt road&nbsp;
leading to the rifle range and conditioning course). In these cases,&nbsp;
depending on pollinator type and amount and type of converted habitat,&nbsp;
gene flow from seed and pollen dispersal between the isolated or&nbsp;
fragmented patches of plants will be reduced. We conclude that the&nbsp;
historical settlement of Jolon on Fort Hunter Liggett and the&nbsp;
construction and use of training areas, roads, and buildings have&nbsp;
fragmented and isolated patches of C. p. var. purpureum.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Issue 5: One commenter suggested that we should not have included&nbsp;
Chlorogalum purpureum var. purpureum in the proposed rule because it&nbsp;
had a candidate listing priority number of 9, suggesting less threat&nbsp;
than that for C. p. var. reductum, which had a candidate listing&nbsp;
priority number of 3.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our response: Assigning listing priority numbers to candidates,&nbsp;
based on immediacy and degree of threat, is simply a method to help us&nbsp;
prioritize the order in which candidates will be proposed for listing.&nbsp;
By definition, a candidate species is one for which we have determined&nbsp;
that we have adequate information on file to propose listing. When&nbsp;
candidate species occur together in the same habitat or have close&nbsp;
taxonomic affinities, we often include them together in a listing&nbsp;
package to increase efficiency. The two taxa addressed in this listing&nbsp;
make up the entire species Chlorogalum purpureum, so it is appropriate&nbsp;
to address the entire species in one rule.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Issue 6: One commenter stated that a new road was not constructed&nbsp;
at Fort Hunter Liggett as had been reported in 1988 by an observer. The&nbsp;
commenter stated that Fort Hunter Liggett simply repaved an abandoned&nbsp;
road that had fallen into disrepair. An aerial photograph from 1950 was&nbsp;
presented to document the statement.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our response: We have reviewed the photo and agree that it appears&nbsp;
that the road in question was in place by 1950. The area where the&nbsp;
plants are located (the commenter has illustrated their location on the&nbsp;
photo) does not appear to have been surrounded by roads in 1950,&nbsp;
however, suggesting that additional road construction since 1950 has&nbsp;
occurred and has resulted in their being left in a triangular-shaped&nbsp;
area, bounded on all sides by roads.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Issue 7: One commenter clarified that, since 1995, under the Army's&nbsp;
environmental review procedures, projects have been modified in all&nbsp;
cases where it was necessary to protect the Chlorogalum purpureum var.&nbsp;
purpureum, not in just some cases, as the proposed rule described.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our response: We are pleased to learn that, during the&nbsp;
environmental review process, projects have been modified in all cases&nbsp;
where needed to reduce impacts to this taxon. Our assessment is that&nbsp;
these modifications have not always been sufficient. The wording in&nbsp;
this final rule has been altered to reflect this determination. We also&nbsp;
recognize that some activities that threaten this plant, such as&nbsp;
bivouacking, are not addressed through the environmental review process&nbsp;
but cause substantial modification of habitat for Chlorogalum&nbsp;
purpureum, particularly in Training Area 25.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Issue 8: One commenter stated that Chlorogalum purpureum,&nbsp;
particularly var. reductum, should be listed as endangered, due to the&nbsp;
combined effects of livestock grazing and OHV trespass, which are&nbsp;
degrading a significant portion of this taxon's range.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our response: Although Chlorogalum purpureum var. reductum occupies&nbsp;
a very limited area, the taxon is abundant within that area. The&nbsp;
species is long-lived, and the threat of OHV trespass has been&nbsp;
partially addressed by the

[[Page 14882]]

USFS through fencing, although more rigorous monitoring and maintenance&nbsp;
of the barriers are needed. Transect data have shown that recruitment&nbsp;
is occurring in the transect area where numbers of C. p. var. reductum&nbsp;
have been relatively stable over the last 7 years (Borchert et al.&nbsp;
1997). The transect is in an area accessible to cattle, but is not in&nbsp;
an area where OHV trespass has continued to occur and cannot be&nbsp;
considered representative of the population. We have concluded that,&nbsp;
while not currently in danger of extinction, C. p. var. reductum is ``*&nbsp;
* * likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future throughout&nbsp;
all or a significant portion of its range'' (the definition of&nbsp;
``threatened'') if impacts from increasing OHV trespass, road use and&nbsp;
maintenance, livestock grazing, and potential displacement by nonnative&nbsp;
species continue or increase.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Issue 9: One commenter stated that the Service, in the proposed&nbsp;
rule, failed to address means, other than grazing, of reducing the&nbsp;
impacts of invasive nonnative species on Chlorogalum purpureum var.&nbsp;
reductum. The commenter also requested that the final rule include&nbsp;
measures the USFS will take to reduce vehicle trespass into the&nbsp;
population area.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our response: We do not typically make management recommendations&nbsp;
in proposed or final rules. Therefore, in this rule we have not&nbsp;
included a discussion of methods to reduce the impacts of nonnative&nbsp;
plants on Chlorogalum purpureum populations or the measures by which&nbsp;
the USFS will address vehicle trespass. The latter will be addressed in&nbsp;
the consultation process under section 7 of the Act, and both issues&nbsp;
will be addressed through the recovery planning process after the&nbsp;
species is listed. In the proposed rule, we noted that previous reports&nbsp;
had suggested that C. purpureum might benefit from grazing if it&nbsp;
reduced the abundance of nonnative annual grasses that occur in the&nbsp;
population area and which may displace C. purpureum. These reports were&nbsp;
not based on monitoring data, as none is available that address the&nbsp;
effects of livestock on nonnative grasses at this site. In the proposed&nbsp;
rule, we did not advocate or oppose livestock grazing as a means to&nbsp;
reduce the effects of nonnative plants on C. purpureum; we believe&nbsp;
studies investigating the effects of livestock grazing on C. purpureum&nbsp;
are necessary should cattle continue to have access to the habitat of&nbsp;
this taxon on Federal lands.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Issue 10: One commenter stated that our argument for not&nbsp;
designating critical habitat was not well justified and that a&nbsp;
designation of critical habitat would provide additional benefit to&nbsp;
Chlorogalum purpureum var. reductum through the section 7 process.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our response: We are deferring a critical habitat determination for&nbsp;
Chlorogalum purpureum in accordance with the Final Listing Priority&nbsp;
Guidance for FY 2000 (64 FR 57114). The Critical Habitat section in&nbsp;
this rule contains further discussion of this issue.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Issue 11: One commenter stated that we lack jurisdiction to enact&nbsp;
the proposed rule and that the rule should be withdrawn since there is&nbsp;
no connection between regulation of these plants and a substantial&nbsp;
effect on ``interstate commerce.''
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our response: Congress does have the authority pursuant to the&nbsp;
Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution, to extend the regulatory&nbsp;
protection of the Act to species that occur in a single site, such as&nbsp;
the one in this final rule. A recent federal court case has upheld this&nbsp;
authority (National Association of Home Builders v. Babbitt, 130 F. 3d&nbsp;
1041 (D.C. Cir. 1997). cert. denied 118 S.Ct. 1998).

Peer Review

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In accordance with our peer review policy published on July 1, 1994&nbsp;
(59 FR 34270), we solicited the expert opinions of three peer reviewers&nbsp;
regarding pertinent scientific or commercial data and assumptions&nbsp;
relating to population status and biological and ecological information&nbsp;
for Chlorogalum purpureum. Two of the three peer reviewers provided&nbsp;
responses. Both respondents supported the listing of the species and&nbsp;
described the information included in the rule as factually correct to&nbsp;
the best of their knowledge. Both provided technical corrections. One&nbsp;
reviewer also provided additional detailed technical information and&nbsp;
references pertaining to threats to the species which the reviewer&nbsp;
suggested needed more thorough discussion than that provided in the&nbsp;
proposed rule.

Summary of Factors Affecting the Species

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 4 of the Act and the regulations (50 CFR part 424) that&nbsp;
implement the listing provisions of the Act set forth the procedures&nbsp;
for adding species to the Federal lists. A species may be determined to&nbsp;
be an endangered or threatened species due to one or more of the five&nbsp;
factors described in section 4(a)(1). These factors and their&nbsp;
application to Chlorogalum purpureum Brandegee (purple amole) are as&nbsp;
follows:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. The present or threatened destruction, modification, or&nbsp;
curtailment of its habitat or range.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chlorogalum purpureum var. purpureum is known only from three&nbsp;
localities on Fort Hunter Liggett, Monterey County. The northern site&nbsp;
comprises discontinuous and fragmented patches over a 7 to 9-km (4 to&nbsp;
6-mi) area in the cantonment (housing and command center), several&nbsp;
training areas, the Ammunition Supply point, and near the Jolon&nbsp;
entrance gate. Habitat for C. p. var. purpureum has been destroyed, and&nbsp;
patches of plants have been isolated and fragmented by the historical&nbsp;
settlement of Jolon, roads, and the construction and use of training&nbsp;
facilities over the past several decades. In the last 50 years, a large&nbsp;
group of plants near the Jolon entrance gate was isolated by the&nbsp;
addition of a new road (aerial photos from Hines in litt. 1998).&nbsp;
Bounded on all sides by roads, this area was used as a vehicle parking&nbsp;
area in the 1980s. Representatives from Fort Hunter Liggett and the&nbsp;
Monterey Chapter of the California Native Plant Society (CNPS)&nbsp;
cooperated in constructing barriers to reduce impacts to the area&nbsp;
(Matthews and Branson 1988). Although the military has committed to&nbsp;
maintaining these protective barriers, this site remains vulnerable due&nbsp;
to its proximity to roads and isolation from surrounding patches of&nbsp;
plants. For example, in 1996 a vehicle mishap resulted in a large piece&nbsp;
of earth-moving machinery entering the site; its tracks through the&nbsp;
population were still evident in September 1997 (Painter and Neese&nbsp;
1998; D. Steeck, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, pers. obs. 1997).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In another portion of this northern locality, the Army recently&nbsp;
expanded training facilities (Hormann 1996). Since 1996, a new obstacle&nbsp;
course and two small parking areas have been placed in habitat occupied&nbsp;
by Chlorogalum purpureum var. purpureum. Although the obstacles and&nbsp;
parking areas themselves were placed to avoid individual patches of&nbsp;
plants (Hormann 1996; Hines in litt. 1998), foot traffic and use of the&nbsp;
training facilities will likely degrade the habitat and eliminate a&nbsp;
portion of the population. In addition to the obstacle course and&nbsp;
parking areas, the Army has in the past 3 years constructed a&nbsp;
confidence course and upgraded a firing range along the stretch of dirt&nbsp;
road adjacent to the locality. The existence of some training&nbsp;
facilities made this area more attractive for additional construction&nbsp;
because the facilities could be located within walking distance of one&nbsp;
another (Hormann 1996). For the same reason, this area is likely to be&nbsp;
attractive for the siting of future training facilities,

[[Page 14883]]

although the Army recently stated that they do not intend to develop&nbsp;
the area further and are willing to enter into an agreement stating&nbsp;
this decision (Hines in litt. 1998).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second locality is in Training Area 25, which is used for field&nbsp;
training maneuvers and is crossed by numerous dirt roads and tracks.&nbsp;
Field maneuvers at Fort Hunter Ligget involve setting up temporary&nbsp;
camps (bivouac sites), which may include excavations for latrines and&nbsp;
washing facilities, bunkers, and protective berms. Field maneuvers&nbsp;
routinely involve hundreds of troops and support staff as well as both&nbsp;
tracked and wheeled vehicles (U.S. Army Reserve Command 1996). Large&nbsp;
areas where substantial bivouacking occurred in 1997 were denuded, with&nbsp;
much of the herbaceous vegetation among the oaks destroyed (D. Steeck,&nbsp;
pers. obs. 1997). Vehicle tracks were evident throughout the site (D.&nbsp;
Steeck, pers. obs. 1997, 1998) and had been reported by other observers&nbsp;
(Painter and Neese 1998). Bivouacking typically occurs in these areas&nbsp;
in summer (U.S. Army Reserve Command 1996). Although soils are not as&nbsp;
susceptible to compaction at that time, fruiting stalks are destroyed&nbsp;
and the loss of vegetation may lead to erosion and consequent loss of&nbsp;
existing seeds and bulbs in the soil, as well as an increase in the&nbsp;
abundance of nonnative plants. Soil compaction may damage soil&nbsp;
mycorhizzae, and the loss of cryptobiotic crusts may hinder seedling&nbsp;
establishment of native species (Belnap 1994), thereby intensifying&nbsp;
displacement of native species by nonnative grasses. Cryptobiotic&nbsp;
crusts have been observed in at least one locality where Chlorogalum&nbsp;
purpureum var. purpureum is found (Painter in litt. 1998). Vehicle&nbsp;
tracks have also been reported in the third locality of C. p. var.&nbsp;
purpureum at the boundaries of Training Areas 23, 24, and 27 (Painter&nbsp;
and Neese 1998, J. Chesnut, in litt. 1998). In 1997, the vegetation of&nbsp;
this area appeared to be the least affected by training activities,&nbsp;
although military training the previous year had caused a spring fire&nbsp;
that burned the site and destroyed most of the year's seed crop&nbsp;
(Painter and Neese 1998).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The larger site of Chlorogalum purpureum var. reductum, located on&nbsp;
LPNF and on private land, is estimated to occupy less than 8 ha (20 ac)&nbsp;
(maps in Borchert 1981, Gaskin 1990; Danielsen pers. comm. 1997). It&nbsp;
was likely once continuous, but is now divided by a two-lane highway.&nbsp;
The southern portion of the site, on public lands, is further bisected&nbsp;
by a dirt road that is currently about 10 m (33 ft) wide and runs the&nbsp;
length of the population. Although this road has existed for many&nbsp;
decades, grading during the past 5 years has widened it toward the&nbsp;
bounds of the pipe barrier fence that lines it, causing direct loss of&nbsp;
some individuals of C. p. var. reductum and additional habitat loss (D.&nbsp;
Magney, pers. comm. 1997). Because the roadbed is graded and highly&nbsp;
compacted, the loss of habitat due to the roadbed is relatively&nbsp;
permanent, barring extensive restoration efforts. Dust from use of the&nbsp;
road during late spring may impede pollination in those plants exposed&nbsp;
to it, and dust coating leaves can reduce photosynthetic abilities&nbsp;
(Farmer 1993).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the 1970s and 1980s, most of the LPNF locality of Chlorogalum&nbsp;
purpureum var. reductum was used as a staging area by OHV enthusiasts&nbsp;
(McLeod 1987). An active 4-wheel drive route still exists near the&nbsp;
population (USFS 1993). A portion of the population was fenced in the&nbsp;
early 1980s by the CNPS with help from the USFS to protect it from OHV&nbsp;
use. In 1989 or 1990, due to continued OHV use in the area, the USFS&nbsp;
installed a pipe barrier on both sides of the dirt road that bisects&nbsp;
the population, to exclude vehicles from most of the population.&nbsp;
Vehicles repeatedly trespassed onto the site over the past 5 years&nbsp;
through broken fences leaving ruts or exposed tracks in the population&nbsp;
(K. Danielsen pers. comm. 1996; A. Koch, CDFG, in litt. 1997; D.&nbsp;
Steeck, pers. obs. 1997). In 1998, the USFS replaced a section of&nbsp;
barbed wire fence with a metal post and rewelded broken pipe barriers.&nbsp;
Continued monitoring and repairs will be needed to exclude vehicles. In&nbsp;
addition to causing injury or death of individual plants, vehicle&nbsp;
passes may destroy cryptobiotic soil crusts (Webb and Wilshire 1983),&nbsp;
damage soil mycorrhizae, and cause soil compaction, altering the soil's&nbsp;
water-holding capacity and interfering with the ability of roots to&nbsp;
penetrate the soil (Webb and Wilshire 1983). The existing scars of&nbsp;
older vehicle tracks in the population are probably partly the result&nbsp;
of soil compaction. Biologists attempting to establish seedlings of C.&nbsp;
p. var. reductum in old OHV tracks in the LPNF population found that&nbsp;
only 36 percent of the seeds planted in untreated tracks germinated and&nbsp;
survived through their first 1.5 years. Survival was 66 percent for&nbsp;
seeds planted in old tracks where the top 10 cm (4 in) of soil was&nbsp;
loosened prior to planting to reduce the effects of soil compaction.&nbsp;
Bulbs in unloosened soil of old tracks also had a lower survival rate&nbsp;
compared to those in loosened soil (Koch 1997). Other tests of&nbsp;
germination response suggest that seeds require burial for post-
germination survival and that uncompacted soils containing small&nbsp;
fissures and spaces around gravel components are likely essential to&nbsp;
successful seedling establishment (D. Wilken, in litt. 1998). Little&nbsp;
information is available on the portion of this population located on&nbsp;
private lands north of the highway.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second site for Chlorogalum purpureum var. reductum, located&nbsp;
solely on private lands, is reported to be extremely small (less than&nbsp;
0.1 ha (0.25 ac) with several hundred plants), compared to the&nbsp;
population managed by the USFS (8 ha). Because this taxon is so&nbsp;
narrowly distributed, the degradation of even an acre or two of the&nbsp;
occupied habitat in the LPNF population constitutes a significant&nbsp;
portion of this taxon's range.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most localities of Chlorogalum purpureum are, or have been, subject&nbsp;
to cattle grazing. The negative effects of livestock use on oak&nbsp;
savannah habitat, where C. purpureum is most likely to occur, includes&nbsp;
soil compaction, soil disturbance that enhances the introduction or&nbsp;
spread of nonnative aggressive weedy species, direct crushing of the&nbsp;
above-ground portion of plants, and diminished seedling establishment&nbsp;
from trampling or from destruction of cryptobiotic crusts (Beymer and&nbsp;
Klopatek 1991). It has been suggested that light grazing in the habitat&nbsp;
of C. purpureum var. reductum may benefit C. p. var. reductum by&nbsp;
reducing competition from annual grasses (The Nature Conservancy 1987,&nbsp;
CDFG 1988). Others have noted, however, that any benefits of cattle use&nbsp;
in the area may be more than offset by loss of reproductive structures,&nbsp;
damage to seedlings, and habitat damage caused by livestock, since the&nbsp;
allotment is in use February through May, a critical season in the life&nbsp;
cycle of the purple amole (B. Painter in litt. 1998; J. Kuyper,&nbsp;
Environmental Defense Center, in litt. 1998). Cattle use is likely to&nbsp;
negatively affect the habitat of this species to the extent that cattle&nbsp;
actually use the portion of the allotment where the population is&nbsp;
located. Anecdotal observations in recent years suggest the cattle&nbsp;
spend more time in other areas of the allotment where water and more&nbsp;
forage is available (M. Fountain, pers. comm. 1998). However, cattle&nbsp;
impacts can vary from year-to-year through variation in the grazing,&nbsp;
congregating, or trailing patterns of the cattle without an increase in&nbsp;
the permitted level of forage utilization in the allotment. If cattle&nbsp;
have continued access to the population area, their effect on the&nbsp;
population on Federal lands must be monitored; the

[[Page 14884]]

allotment should be managed to prevent negative effects to this taxon.&nbsp;
Predation by cattle is discussed below under Factor C of this section.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B. Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or&nbsp;
educational purposes.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overutilization is not currently known to be a factor affecting&nbsp;
this species.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C. Disease or predation.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nearly every locality of Chlorogalum purpureum either is or has&nbsp;
been subject to cattle grazing. The potential negative effects of&nbsp;
livestock grazing (actual herbivory) on C. purpureum include the loss&nbsp;
of flowers, fruit, and leaves. Cattle have been recorded grazing a&nbsp;
substantial portion of the leaves of other, larger, Chlorogalum species&nbsp;
(Willoughby 1986). Leaves of C. p. var. purpureum are more likely than&nbsp;
those of C. p. var. reductum to be attractive to cattle, as the leaves&nbsp;
of the latter are narrow and only a couple of inches long. All three&nbsp;
localities of C. p. var. purpureum at Fort Hunter Liggett were in&nbsp;
grazing allotments prior to 1991. Documented overgrazing occurred from&nbsp;
1963 to 1977 at Fort Hunter Liggett, after which a study of grazing was&nbsp;
begun (Stechman 1995). During the grazing study, cattle stocking rates&nbsp;
continued to exceed the capacity of the habitats to support them,&nbsp;
especially when combined with the drought of the late 1980s and early&nbsp;
1990s (Stechman 1995). No specific information is available on the&nbsp;
condition of the localities of C. p. var. purpureum during the period&nbsp;
of overgrazing, as no basewide surveys for sensitive plant species had&nbsp;
been conducted and the status of populations was not tracked. Grazing&nbsp;
on Fort Hunter Liggett stopped in 1991, following an extended drought&nbsp;
and poor range condition (Stechman 1995), but is scheduled to be&nbsp;
resumed in the future, although no date has been set. If the&nbsp;
recommendations in the grazing assessment are followed, cattle grazing&nbsp;
leases would include most of the extended northern locality of this&nbsp;
taxon and all of the second locality in Training Area 25. Only the&nbsp;
southernmost locality, at the boundaries of Training Areas 23, 24, and&nbsp;
27, would be completely excluded from cattle use (Stechman 1995).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chlorogalum purpureum var. reductum is within an active grazing&nbsp;
allotment on the LPNF that cattle use from February through May (USFS&nbsp;
1997). The permitted level of use of the allotment by livestock is&nbsp;
moderate (USFS 1997). In 1986 livestock use became a problem when&nbsp;
cattle congregated within the population behind a fence built to block&nbsp;
vehicle access (The Nature Conservancy 1987). A pipe barrier with low&nbsp;
sections was later installed to permit cattle movement over the&nbsp;
barriers. Because the period of cattle use coincides with growth and&nbsp;
flowering of C. p. var. reductum, it is likely that reproduction would&nbsp;
be negatively affected if cattle congregated on the plateau within the&nbsp;
locality containing the population. In 1995 and 1996, cattle appeared&nbsp;
to have spent little time on the plateau (A. Koch, pers. comm. 1997a).&nbsp;
In 1997, fecal evidence suggested that cattle spent relatively more&nbsp;
time within the site (D. Steeck, pers. obs. 1997; A. Koch, pers. comm.&nbsp;
1997b). Although current monitoring data are insufficient to evaluate&nbsp;
the use of the allotment on C. p. var. reductum, grazing has the&nbsp;
potential to negatively affect reproduction and survival (through loss&nbsp;
of inflorescences and photosynthetic tissue), and may exacerbate damage&nbsp;
already caused by vehicles or other human activities. We consider the&nbsp;
inclusion of the population in an active grazing allotment a potential&nbsp;
threat that should be assessed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D. The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pursuant to the Native Plant Protection Act (Div. 2, chapter 10&nbsp;
sec. 1900 et seq. of the California Department of Fish and Game Code)&nbsp;
and the California Endangered Species Act (Div. 3, chapter 1.5 sec.&nbsp;
2050 et seq.), the California Fish and Game Commission listed&nbsp;
Chlorogalum purpureum var. reductum as rare in 1978. California Senate&nbsp;
Bill 879, passed in 1997 and effective January 1, 1998, requires&nbsp;
individuals to obtain a section 2081(b) permit from CDFG to take a&nbsp;
listed species incidental to otherwise lawful activities, and requires&nbsp;
that all impacts be fully mitigated and all measures be capable of&nbsp;
successful implementation. As applied to State-listed plant species,&nbsp;
however, these requirements have not been tested; their effectiveness&nbsp;
cannot be evaluated for several years.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chlorogalum purpureum var. reductum occurs primarily on Federal&nbsp;
lands managed by the LPNF and on private lands. State listing provides&nbsp;
no consultation or other requirements for protection on Federal lands,&nbsp;
although it is USFS policy to work with the State in the conservation&nbsp;
of such taxa. The management of sensitive resources on the LPNF is&nbsp;
guided by various policies and regulations, including the National&nbsp;
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 (Pub. L. 91-109, 42 U.S.C.&nbsp;
4321-4347, 83 Stat. 852), National Forest Management Act (16 U.S.C.&nbsp;
1600 et seq.), and the Land and Resource Management Plan for the Los&nbsp;
Padres National Forest (USFS 1988).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The NEPA requires that the USFS disclose and consider potential&nbsp;
environmental impacts of a proposed project. Under new regulations, 10-
year grazing permits are subject to the NEPA process, and the NEPA&nbsp;
process is under way for the grazing allotment where Chlorogalum&nbsp;
purpureum var. reductum occurs (USFS 1997). Although NEPA requires&nbsp;
disclosure of potential effects of Federal actions and allows for&nbsp;
comment by agencies and the public, it does not, of itself, provide&nbsp;
additional protection.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Land and Resource Management Plan for LPNF (USFS 1988) directs&nbsp;
the USFS to ensure the viability of sensitive plant species and to&nbsp;
emphasize the improvement and protection of habitat for sensitive&nbsp;
species in their management activities. These regulations appear to be&nbsp;
adequate, but their implementation by the USFS has not been consistent.&nbsp;
Unless the barriers around portions of the population are regularly&nbsp;
monitored and maintained, illegal trespass by vehicles into the habitat&nbsp;
of Chlorogalum purpureum var. reductum is likely to continue. To date,&nbsp;
the USFS has not adequately monitored vehicle trespass, repaired&nbsp;
fencing, bolstered barriers in a timely manner, or adequately evaluated&nbsp;
the effects of permitted livestock use on the population on LPNF (D.&nbsp;
Steeck, pers. obs. 1998).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chlorogalum purpureum var. purpureum occurs solely on Federal lands&nbsp;
managed by Fort Hunter Liggett. The Department of Defense has various&nbsp;
policies and directives to guide the management of sensitive natural&nbsp;
resources. Army Regulation 200-3 provides for environmental review of&nbsp;
projects that might affect sensitive and listed species. Fort Hunter&nbsp;
Liggett has had an environmental review process since 1994, and C. p.&nbsp;
var. purpureum is included in this process. According to the Army at&nbsp;
Fort Hunter Liggett (D. Hines in litt. 1998), all projects are modified&nbsp;
to reduce impacts to this taxon if impacts are predicted to occur. For&nbsp;
example, a planned bayonet course was relocated to avoid placing it&nbsp;
within or directly adjacent to patches of C. p. var. purpureum. In&nbsp;
other cases, such as with the recent construction of the obstacle&nbsp;
course and parking areas in occupied habitat, project modifications&nbsp;
have been insufficient, and projects continue to be sited in occupied&nbsp;
habitat and continue to affect this taxon. In addition, environmental&nbsp;
review only occurs for projects that require excavation; bivouacking&nbsp;
and vehicle impacts are not covered by this process. The environmental&nbsp;
review process does not

[[Page 14885]]

always allow for assessment surveys to be conducted at the time of year&nbsp;
when the plant can be identified (H. Hormann, in litt. 1997). For&nbsp;
example, surveys for the proposed bayonet course occurred in late&nbsp;
summer 1997, when the above-ground portions of the plants were dry and&nbsp;
difficult to locate.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under Army Regulation 200-3, a Species Management Plan for&nbsp;
Chlorogalum purpureum var. purpureum and other sensitive species on the&nbsp;
base has been developed (Hazebrook and Clark 1997). While some of the&nbsp;
goals will benefit C. p. var. purpureum if achieved, the actual&nbsp;
protection the plan affords is minimal and based primarily on avoiding&nbsp;
impacts to populations ``when feasible.'' To date, no areas where C. p.&nbsp;
var. purpureum occurs on the base are off-limits to training. We&nbsp;
conclude that Army directives, while improving the consideration that&nbsp;
this taxon receives on the base, have not yet altered activities to&nbsp;
sufficiently reduce the threats posed by military activities.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E. Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued&nbsp;
existence.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other factors affecting individuals of Chlorogalum purpureum var.&nbsp;
purpureum include military training, changes in fire frequency, and the&nbsp;
invasion of this taxon's habitat by nonnative plant species. Training&nbsp;
activities that involve trampling, camping, or driving through occupied&nbsp;
habitat can directly crush flowers, fruits, and vegetative parts of C.&nbsp;
p. var. purpureum and result in diminished reproductive success, lower&nbsp;
seedling establishment, and reduced plant vigor. At Fort Hunter&nbsp;
Liggett, training activities increase in the spring, around April, and&nbsp;
peak in the summer (U.S. Dept. of Army 1997), a period that coincides&nbsp;
with flowering and fruiting of the taxon. Military field training&nbsp;
activities can reduce seedling establishment by direct crushing and by&nbsp;
altering soil bulk density and water-holding capacity. Training&nbsp;
activities lead to soil compaction and soil disturbance, which also&nbsp;
encourages the invasion of weedy, nonnative plant species that may&nbsp;
compete directly with C. p. var. purpureum. Habitat alterations due to&nbsp;
training activities are further discussed under Factor A.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The oak savannah and grassland habitats in which Chlorogalum&nbsp;
purpureum occurs have been invaded by nonnative annual plants such as&nbsp;
wild oats (Avena sp.), soft chess (Bromus hordeaceus), red brome&nbsp;
(Bromus madritensis var. rubens), schismus (Schismus barbatus), and&nbsp;
filaree (Erodium sp.) (Borchert 1981; Magney 1988; Painter and Neese&nbsp;
1998). Hoover (1970) noted that C. p. var. reductum grew higher under&nbsp;
oaks where the soil was looser with greater humus content; others have&nbsp;
noted since then that C. p. var. reductum is not found where annual&nbsp;
nonnative grasses are dense (Borchert 1981, Painter in litt. 1998),&nbsp;
which tends to be under oaks at the site on USFS land (D. Steeck, pers.&nbsp;
obs. 1998). It may be that C. p. var. reductum has been displaced by&nbsp;
nonnative grasses in these areas, restricting C. p. var. reductum to&nbsp;
the patches of gravelly soils where nonnative grasses are stunted or&nbsp;
sparse. Increasing invasion by nonnative annual grasses has been&nbsp;
implicated in loss of habitat for other rare geophytes (e.g.,&nbsp;
Rosentreter 1994). Cryptobiotic crusts that form on the soil surface&nbsp;
have been shown to enhance seedling establishment in some native taxa&nbsp;
(Belnap 1994), and the displacement of crusts may enhance invasion by&nbsp;
nonnative species. These soil crusts are found in at least some&nbsp;
populations of C. purpureum (Painter and Neese 1998; B. Painter in&nbsp;
litt. 1998). Scraping or other activity that disturbs the soil surface&nbsp;
has been noted in one instance at Fort Hunter Liggett to result in at&nbsp;
least temporary high abundance of nonnative annual grasses (Painter and&nbsp;
Neese1998). The rapid, dense growth of nonnative annual grasses may&nbsp;
also act as an abundant, rapidly replenished fuel source leading to&nbsp;
more frequent range fires as has been documented in other areas (Wright&nbsp;
1985) or the need for more frequent prescribed burns to reduce the&nbsp;
potential of uncontrolled range fires (J. Chesnut, consulting&nbsp;
biologist, in litt. 1998).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Burning too frequently or during seasons of growth and reproduction&nbsp;
may threaten Chlorogalum purpureum var. purpureum at Fort Hunter&nbsp;
Liggett. A spring burn swept through the southernmost locality on Fort&nbsp;
Hunter Liggett in 1995. Botanists conducting a post-fire survey&nbsp;
reported that all observed fruiting inflorescences were either damaged&nbsp;
or destroyed, and they concluded that the seed crop was mostly, if not&nbsp;
completely, destroyed (Painter and Neese 1998). The fire occurred in&nbsp;
May, rather than summer or early fall, when most seeds would have been&nbsp;
dispersed (Painter and Neese 1998). Burning too frequently may damage a&nbsp;
population due to the slow growth rate of seedlings. Estimates of time&nbsp;
needed for C. purpureum to reach reproductive maturity in the wild&nbsp;
range from 5 to 15 years (Judy Jernstedt, University of California at&nbsp;
Davis, in litt. 1998; M. Elvin, pers. comm. 1998). In addition,&nbsp;
immature plants with small bulbs located near the soil surface may be&nbsp;
particularly vulnerable to fires. The fire did appear to stimulate an&nbsp;
increase in the number of plants flowering the following year (Painter&nbsp;
and Neese 1998).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In developing this final rule, we have carefully assessed the best&nbsp;
scientific and commercial information available regarding the past,&nbsp;
present, and future threats faced by this species. Based on this&nbsp;
evaluation, the preferred action is to list the species as threatened.&nbsp;
This species is particularly vulnerable due to the restricted range it&nbsp;
occupies. Threats to the species are vehicle trespass on USFS lands,&nbsp;
military activities due to the species' location in active training&nbsp;
areas and in the housing and administration area of an Army base, road&nbsp;
use and maintenance, displacement by nonnative plant species, and&nbsp;
livestock grazing. Because the Army's environmental directives are&nbsp;
increasing the consideration afforded to this and other rare plant&nbsp;
species on Fort Hunter Liggett and because the USFS has implemented&nbsp;
some management actions for this species, we determine that threatened&nbsp;
status is currently appropriate. The species is not currently in danger&nbsp;
of extinction, but is likely to become so if substantial use of its&nbsp;
habitat for military training activities continues and if OHV&nbsp;
activities or livestock impacts increase in the population area on USFS&nbsp;
lands.

Critical Habitat

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Critical habitat is defined in section 3 of the Act as: (i) The&nbsp;
specific areas within the geographical area occupied by the species, at&nbsp;
the time it is listed in accordance with the Act, on which are found&nbsp;
those physical or biological features (I) essential to the conservation&nbsp;
of the species and (II) that may require special management&nbsp;
considerations or protection and; (ii) specific areas outside the&nbsp;
geographical area occupied by a species at the time it is listed, upon&nbsp;
a determination that such areas are essential for the conservation of&nbsp;
the species. ``Conservation'' means the use of all methods and&nbsp;
procedures needed to bring the species to the point at which listing&nbsp;
under the Act is no longer necessary.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, and implementing&nbsp;
regulations (50 CFR 424.12) require that, to the maximum extent prudent&nbsp;
and determinable, we designate critical habitat at the time the species&nbsp;
is determined to be endangered or threatened. Our regulations (50 CFR&nbsp;
424.12(a)(1)) state that the designation of critical habitat is not&nbsp;
prudent when one or both of the following situations exist--(1) the&nbsp;
species is threatened by taking or other human activity, and

[[Page 14886]]

identification of critical habitat can be expected to increase the&nbsp;
degree of threat to the species, or (2) such designation of critical&nbsp;
habitat would not be beneficial to the species.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Final Listing Priority Guidance for FY 2000 (64 FR 57114)&nbsp;
states, the processing of critical habitat determinations (prudency and&nbsp;
determinability decisions) and proposed or final designations of&nbsp;
critical habitat will no longer be subject to prioritization under the&nbsp;
Listing Priority Guidance. Critical habitat determinations, which were&nbsp;
previously included in final listing rules published in the Federal&nbsp;
Register, may now be processed separately, in which case stand-alone&nbsp;
critical habitat determinations will be published as notices in the&nbsp;
Federal Register. We will undertake critical habitat determinations and&nbsp;
designations during FY 2000 as allowed by our funding allocation for&nbsp;
that year. As explained in detail in the Listing Priority Guidance, our&nbsp;
listing budget is currently insufficient to allow us to immediately&nbsp;
complete all of the listing actions required by the Act. Deferral of&nbsp;
the critical habitat designation for Chlorogalum purpureum will allow&nbsp;
us to concentrate our limited resources on higher priority critical&nbsp;
habitat and other listing actions, while allowing us to put in place&nbsp;
protections needed for the conservation of Chlorogalum purpureum&nbsp;
without further delay.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We propose that critical habitat is prudent for Chlorogalum&nbsp;
purpureum. In the last few years, a series of court decisions have&nbsp;
overturned Service determinations regarding a variety of species that&nbsp;
designation of critical habitat would not be prudent (e.g., Natural&nbsp;
Resources Defense Council v. U.S. Department of the Interior 113 F. 3d&nbsp;
1121 (9th Cir. 1997); Conservation Council for Hawaii v. Babbitt, 2 F.&nbsp;
Supp. 2d 1280 (D. Hawaii 1998)). Based on the standards applied in&nbsp;
those judicial opinions, we believe that designation of critical&nbsp;
habitat would be prudent for Chlorogalum purpureum.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the absence of a finding that critical habitat would increase&nbsp;
threats to a species, if there are any benefits to critical habitat&nbsp;
designation, then a prudent finding is warranted. In the case of this&nbsp;
species, there may be some benefits to designation of critical habitat.&nbsp;
The primary regulatory effect of critical habitat is the section 7&nbsp;
requirement that Federal agencies refrain from taking any action that&nbsp;
destroys or adversely modifies critical habitat. While a critical&nbsp;
habitat designation for habitat currently occupied by this species&nbsp;
would not be likely to change the section 7 consultation outcome&nbsp;
because an action that destroys or adversely modifies such critical&nbsp;
habitat would also be likely to result in jeopardy to the species,&nbsp;
there may be instances where section 7 consultation would be triggered&nbsp;
only if critical habitat is designated. Examples could include&nbsp;
unoccupied habitat or occupied habitat that may become unoccupied in&nbsp;
the future. There may also be some educational or informational&nbsp;
benefits to designating critical habitat. Therefore, we find that&nbsp;
critical habitat is prudent for Chlorogalum purpureum.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We plan to employ a priority system for deciding which outstanding&nbsp;
critical habitat designations should be addressed first. We will focus&nbsp;
our efforts on those designations that will provide the most&nbsp;
conservation benefit, taking into consideration the efficacy of&nbsp;
critical habitat designation in addressing the threats to the species,&nbsp;
and the magnitude and immediacy of those threats. We will develop a&nbsp;
proposal to designate critical habitat for the Chlorogalum purpureum as&nbsp;
soon as feasible, considering our workload priorities.

Available Conservation Measures

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or&nbsp;
threatened under the Endangered Species Act include recognition,&nbsp;
recovery actions, requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions&nbsp;
against certain activities. Recognition through listing encourages and&nbsp;
results in conservation actions by Federal, State, and local agencies,&nbsp;
private organizations, and individuals. The Act provides for possible&nbsp;
land acquisition and cooperation with the States and requires that&nbsp;
recovery actions be carried out for all listed species. The protection&nbsp;
required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions against certain&nbsp;
activities involving listed plants are discussed, in part, below.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to&nbsp;
evaluate their actions with respect to any species that is proposed or&nbsp;
listed as endangered or threatened and with respect to its critical&nbsp;
habitat, if any is designated. Regulations implementing this&nbsp;
interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR&nbsp;
part 402. Section 7(a)(4) requires Federal agencies to confer with us&nbsp;
on any action that is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a&nbsp;
species proposed for listing or result in destruction or adverse&nbsp;
modification of proposed critical habitat. If a species is listed&nbsp;
subsequently, section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to ensure that&nbsp;
activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to&nbsp;
jeopardize the continued existence of the species or destroy or&nbsp;
adversely modify its critical habitat, if any is designated. If a&nbsp;
Federal action may affect a listed species or its critical habitat, the&nbsp;
responsible Federal agency must enter into formal consultation with us.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although this final rule lists Chlorogalum purpureum at the&nbsp;
specific level, we intend through the recovery planning process to&nbsp;
designate each of the varieties as a separate recovery unit for&nbsp;
purposes of section 7 consultation and the recovery process. In other&nbsp;
words, the jeopardy standard would be applied to either C. p. var.&nbsp;
purpureum or C. p. var. reductum as separately identified recovery&nbsp;
units, in accordance with our Endangered Species Consultation Handbook.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Federal agencies that may affect the species proposed in this rule&nbsp;
through activities they fund, authorize, or carry out are the USFS (at&nbsp;
Los Padres National Forest), the Department of the Army (at Fort Hunter&nbsp;
Liggett) and, to a much smaller extent, the Federal Highway&nbsp;
Administration through funds provided for State highway construction or&nbsp;
maintenance.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chlorogalum purpureum var. purpureum occurs wholly on Federal lands&nbsp;
managed by the Department of the Army. Activities the Army funds,&nbsp;
authorizes, or carries out that could affect this taxon include, but&nbsp;
are not limited to, construction and use of training facilities, field&nbsp;
training exercises, road construction and maintenance, prescribed&nbsp;
burning, fire suppression activities, livestock grazing, and hunting.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chlorogalum purpureum var. reductum occurs primarily on public&nbsp;
lands managed by the USFS on Los Padres National Forest. Activities&nbsp;
that the USFS funds, authorizes, or carries out that could affect this&nbsp;
taxon include livestock grazing, OHV activities, road maintenance, fire&nbsp;
suppression activities, and special use permits authorizing use and the&nbsp;
development of management plans for special use areas.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Listing Chlorogalum purpureum as threatened will provide for the&nbsp;
development of a recovery plan. The plan will bring together Federal,&nbsp;
State, and local efforts for the plant's conservation, establishing a&nbsp;
framework for cooperation and coordination. The plan will set recovery&nbsp;
priorities and describe site-specific management actions necessary to&nbsp;
achieve the conservation of the species. Additionally, pursuant to&nbsp;
section 6 of the Act, we will be more likely to grant

[[Page 14887]]

funds to the State for management actions promoting the protection and&nbsp;
recovery of the species.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Act and its implementing regulations set forth a series of&nbsp;
general prohibitions and exceptions that apply to all endangered or&nbsp;
threatened plants. All prohibitions of section 9(a)(2) of the Act&nbsp;
implemented by 50 CFR 17.71 for threatened plants apply. These&nbsp;
prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for any person subject to the&nbsp;
jurisdiction of the United States to import or export, transport in&nbsp;
interstate or foreign commerce in the course of a commercial activity,&nbsp;
sell or offer for sale in interstate or foreign commerce, or remove and&nbsp;
reduce the species to possession any such species from areas under&nbsp;
Federal jurisdiction. In addition, for plants listed as endangered, the&nbsp;
Act prohibits the malicious damage or destruction on areas under&nbsp;
Federal jurisdiction and the removal, cutting, digging up, or damaging&nbsp;
or destroying of such plants in knowing violation of any State law or&nbsp;
regulation, or in the course of violation of State criminal trespass&nbsp;
law. Section 4(d) of the Act allows for the provision of such&nbsp;
protection to threatened species through regulation. This protection&nbsp;
may apply to this species in the future if regulations are promulgated.&nbsp;
Seeds from cultivated specimens of threatened plants are exempt from&nbsp;
these prohibitions provided that their containers are marked ``Of&nbsp;
Cultivated Origin.'' Certain exceptions to the prohibitions apply to&nbsp;
agents of the Service and State conservation agencies.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Act and 50 CFR 17.62, 17.63, and 17.72 also provide for the&nbsp;
issuance of permits to carry out otherwise prohibited activities&nbsp;
involving endangered or threatened plant species under certain&nbsp;
circumstances. Such permits are available for scientific purposes and&nbsp;
to enhance the propagation or survival of the species. For threatened&nbsp;
plants, permits are also available for botanical or horticultural&nbsp;
exhibition, educational purposes, or special purposes consistent with&nbsp;
the purposes of the Act. It is anticipated that few trade permits would&nbsp;
ever be sought or issued because this species is not in cultivation or&nbsp;
common in the wild. Information collections associated with these&nbsp;
permits are approved under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501&nbsp;
et seq., and assigned Office of Management and Budget clearance number&nbsp;
1018-0094. For additional information concerning these permits and&nbsp;
associated requirements, see 50 CFR 17.72.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Requests for copies of the regulations on listed species and&nbsp;
inquiries about prohibitions and permits may be addressed to the U.S.&nbsp;
Fish and Wildlife Service, Endangered Species Permits, 911 NE 11th&nbsp;
Avenue, Portland, Oregon 97232-4181 (telephone: 503/231-2063;&nbsp;
facsimile: 503/231-6243).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is our policy, published in the Federal Register (59 FR 34272)&nbsp;
on July 1, 1994, to identify to the maximum extent practicable those&nbsp;
activities that would or would not be likely to constitute a violation&nbsp;
of section 9 of the Act if a species is listed. The intent of this&nbsp;
policy is to increase public awareness of the effect of the species'&nbsp;
listing on proposed and ongoing activities within its range. Collection&nbsp;
of listed plants are prohibited without a Federal endangered species&nbsp;
permit. We are unaware of any activities on non-Federal lands that&nbsp;
constitute a violation of section 9 of the Act.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Questions regarding whether specific activities would constitute a&nbsp;
violation of section 9 should be directed to the Field Supervisor of&nbsp;
the Ventura Fish and Wildlife Office (see ADDRESSES section).

National Environmental Policy Act

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have determined that Environmental Assessments and Environmental&nbsp;
Impact Statements, as defined under the authority of the National&nbsp;
Environmental Policy Act of 1969, need not be prepared in connection&nbsp;
with regulations adopted pursuant to section 4(a) of the Endangered&nbsp;
Species Act of 1973, as amended. A notice outlining our reasons for&nbsp;
this determination was published in the Federal Register on October 25,&nbsp;
1983 (48 FR 49244).

Regulatory Planning and Review

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This rule is not subject to review by the Office of Management and&nbsp;
Budget under Executive Order 12866.

Paperwork Reduction Act

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This rule does not contain any information collection requirements&nbsp;
for which Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval under the&nbsp;
Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. is required. An&nbsp;
information collection related to the rule pertaining to permits for&nbsp;
endangered and threatened species has OMB approval and is assigned&nbsp;
clearance number 1018-0094. For additional information concerning&nbsp;
permits and associated requirements for threatened plants, see 50 CFR&nbsp;
17.32.
