<B>Community Overview&nbsp;
</B>
<p>The Northwoods NiiJii Empowerment Zone consists of three Indian Reservations and three non-Indian developable sites. All three Reservations are located in the rugged northern forests of Wisconsin. The developable sites are located in Shawano County bordering the Menominee Reservation, the Town of Nashville bordering the Mole Lake Reservation and Vilas County bordering the Lac du Flambeau Reservation. High unemployment, large families, critically substandard housing, crime, alcohol abuse, and dependence on welfare are some of the poverty-related problems that have confronted the Tribe. The strategic planning process created new partnerships between the tribes and local non-tribal governments and organizations. The Menominee Reservation contains the oldest sustainable forest in the world. The President’s Council on Sustainable Development, the United Nations and several other Nation Governments have acknowledged the Tribe as a leader in science of sustainable development.&nbsp;</p>

startup, and matching funding.&nbsp; The EC assisted in the leveraging of seed 
funding to acquire $70 million in project funding and $7.5 million in in-kind
