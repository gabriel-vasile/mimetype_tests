Dear Sirs,
     
        I would like to comment your rule S7-31-99 and selective disclosure.
     
        I feel that SEC-regulated institutions should be confined to comment 
upon their financial situation through the specific means of E-mail.
     
        E-mail comments should be sent by an SEC-regulated institution in a 
good-faith effort to stock exchange members,  newspapers having 10,000+ 
audited paid subscriptions and registered with the SEC, lenders to the 
SEC-regulated institution providing the disclosure, registered 
shareholders(actual, nominative, and beneficial), mutual funds, company 
directors, and such others as the institution may designate within a 
two-hour timeframe.
     
        Except for public annual shareholder meetings and such other 
meetings or reporting as may be approved by the SEC or required by law, such 
E-mail comments should be the exclusive means of communicating financial 
information by SEC-regulated institutions.
     
         In addition, SEC-regulated institutions should vigorously attempt 
to suspend trading in the securities of the institution making a disclosure 
1 hour before making a disclosure till 12 noon on the following trading day.
     
          Mutual funds and financial analysts should be confined to 
submitting written questions to the managements of SEC-regulated 
institutions. These should only be answered on Saturday through the E-mail 
method described previously.
     
          In addition, I would be more than willing to pay the SEC 30 cents 
instead of 3 cents a stock trade if the SEC would be able to audit companies 
to prevent my all too frequent multi-thousand dollar losses in the market. 
Information must also be correct as well as uniformly distributed.
     
                                             Yours Truly
