      secondary schools

-STATUTE-
      (a) Authority of Secretary. - (1) If the Secretary of Defense
    makes a determination that appropriate educational programs are not
    available through a local educational agency for dependents of
    members of the armed forces and dependents of civilian employees of
    the Federal Government residing on a military installation in the
    United States (including territories, commonwealths, and
    possessions of the United States), the Secretary may enter into
    arrangements to provide for the elementary or secondary education
    of the dependents of such members of the armed forces and, to the
    extent authorized in subsection (c), the dependents of such
    civilian employees.
      (2) The Secretary may, at the discretion of the Secretary, permit
    dependents of members of the armed forces and, to the extent
    provided in subsection (c), dependents of civilian employees of the
    Federal Government residing in a territory, commonwealth, or
    possession of the United States but not on a military installation,
    to enroll in an educational program provided by the Secretary
    pursuant to this subsection. If a member of the armed forces is
    assigned to a remote location or is assigned to an unaccompanied
    tour of duty, a dependent of the member who resides, on or off a
    military installation, in a territory, commonwealth, or possession
    of the United States, as authorized by the member's orders, may be
    enrolled in an educational program provided by the Secretary under
    this subsection.
      (b) Factors for Secretary To Consider. - (1) Factors to be
    considered by the Secretary of Defense in making a determination
    under subsection (a) shall include the following:
        (A) The extent to which such dependents are eligible for free
      public education in the local area adjacent to the military
      installation.
        (B) The extent to which the local educational agency is able to
      provide an appropriate educational program for such dependents.

      (2) For purposes of paragraph (1)(B), an appropriate educational
    program is a program that, as determined by the Secretary, is
    comparable to a program of free public education provided for
    children by the following local educational agencies:
        (A) In the case of a military installation located in a State
      (other than an installation referred to in subparagraph (B)),
      local educational agencies in the State that are similar to the
      local educational agency referred to in paragraph (1)(B).
        (B) In the case of a military installation with boundaries
      contiguous to two or more States, local educational agencies in
      the contiguous States that are similar to the local educational
      agency referred to in paragraph (1)(B).
        (C) In the case of a military installation located in a
      territory, commonwealth, or possession, the District of Columbia
      public schools, except that an educational program determined
      comparable under this subparagraph may be considered appropriate
      for the purposes of paragraph (1)(B) only if the program is
      conducted in the English language.

      (c) Eligibility of Dependents of Federal Employees. - (1)(A) A
    dependent of a Federal employee residing in permanent living
    quarters on a military installation at any time during the school
    year may enroll in an educational program provided by the Secretary
    of Defense pursuant to subsection (a) for dependents residing on
    such installation.
      (B) A dependent of a United States Customs Service employee who
    resides in Puerto Rico, but not on a military installation, may
    enroll in an educational program provided by the Secretary pursuant
    to subsection (a) in Puerto Rico in accordance with the same rules
    as apply to a dependent of a Federal employee residing in permanent
    living quarters on a military installation.
      (2)(A) Except as provided in subparagraphs (B) and (C), a
    dependent of a Federal employee who is enrolled in an educational
    program provided by the Secretary pursuant to subsection (a) and
    who is not residing on a military installation may be enrolled in
    the program for not more than five consecutive school years.
      (B) At the discretion of the Secretary, a dependent referred to
    in subparagraph (A) may be enrolled in the program for more than
    five consecutive school years if the dependent is otherwise
    qualified for enrollment, space is available in the program, and
    the Secretary will be reimbursed for the educational services
    provided. Any such extension shall cover only one school year at a
    time.
      (C) Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to an individual who is a
    dependent of a Federal employee in the excepted service (as defined
    in section 2103 of title 5) and who is enrolled in an educational
    program provided by the Secretary pursuant to subsection (a) in
    Puerto Rico, Wake Island, Guam, American Samoa, the Northern
    Mariana Islands, or the Virgin Islands.
      (D) Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to a dependent covered by
    paragraph (1)(B). No requirement under this paragraph for
    reimbursement for educational services provided for the dependent
    shall apply with respect to the dependent, except that the
    Secretary may require the United States Customs Service to
    reimburse the Secretary for the cost of the educational services
    provided for the dependent.
      (d) School Boards. - (1) The Secretary of Defense shall provide
    for the establishment of a school board for Department of Defense
    elementary and secondary schools established at each military
    installation under this section. The Secretary may provide for the
    establishment of one school board for all such schools in the
    Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and one school board for all such
    schools in Guam instead of one school board for each military
    installation in those locations.
      (2) The school board shall be composed of the number of members,
    not fewer than three, prescribed by the Secretary.
      (3) The parents of the students attending the school shall elect
    the school board in accordance with procedures which the Secretary
    shall prescribe.
      (4)(A) A school board elected for a school under this subsection

    personnel, and educational policies, procedures, and programs for
    the school, except that the Secretary may issue any directive that
    the Secretary considers necessary for the effective operation of
    the school or the entire school system.
      (B) A directive referred to in subparagraph (A) shall, to the
    maximum extent practicable, be issued only after the Secretary
    consults with the appropriate school boards elected under this
    subsection. The Secretary shall establish a process by which a
    school board or school administrative officials may formally appeal
    the directive to the Secretary of Defense.
      (5) Meetings conducted by the school board shall be open to the
    public, except as provided in paragraph (6).
      (6) A school board need not comply with the provisions of the
    Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. App.), but may close
    meetings in accordance with such Act.
      (7) The Secretary may provide for reimbursement of a school board
    member for expenses incurred by the member for travel,
    transportation, lodging, meals, program fees, activity fees, and
    other appropriate expenses that the Secretary determines are
    reasonable and necessary for the performance of school board duties
    by the member.
      (e) Administration and Staff. - (1) The Secretary of Defense may
    enter into such arrangements as may be necessary to provide
    educational programs at the school.
      (2) The Secretary may, without regard to the provisions of any
    other law relating to the number, classification, or compensation
    of employees - 
        (A) establish positions for civilian employees in schools
      established under this section;
        (B) appoint individuals to such positions; and
        (C) fix the compensation of such individuals for service in
      such positions.

      (3)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), in fixing the
    compensation of employees appointed for a school pursuant to
    paragraph (2), the Secretary shall consider - 
        (i) the compensation of comparable employees of the local
      educational agency in the capital of the State where the military
      installation is located;
        (ii) the compensation of comparable employees in the local
      educational agency that provides public education to students who
      reside adjacent to the military installation; and
        (iii) the average compensation for similar positions in not
      more than three other local educational agencies in the State in
      which the military installation is located.

      (B) In fixing the compensation of employees in schools
    established in the territories, commonwealths, and possessions
    pursuant to the authority of this section, the Secretary shall
    determine the level of compensation required to attract qualified
    employees. For employees in such schools, the Secretary, without
    regard to the provisions of title 5, may provide for the tenure,
    leave, hours of work, and other incidents of employment to be
    similar to that provided for comparable positions in the public
    schools of the District of Columbia. For purposes of the first
    sentence, a school established before the effective date of this
    section pursuant to authority similar to the authority in this
    section shall be considered to have been established pursuant to
    the authority of this section.
      (4)(A) The Secretary may, without regard to the provisions of any
    law relating to the number, classification, or compensation of
    employees - 
        (i) transfer employees from schools established under this
      section to schools in the defense dependents' education system in
      order to provide the services referred to in subparagraph (B) to
      such system; and
        (ii) transfer employees from such system to schools established
      under this section in order to provide such services to those
      schools.

    following:
        (i) Administrative services.
        (ii) Logistical services.
        (iii) Personnel services.
        (iv) Such other services as the Secretary considers
      appropriate.

      (C) Transfers under this paragraph shall extend for such periods
    as the Secretary considers appropriate. The Secretary shall provide
    appropriate compensation for employees so transferred.
      (D) The Secretary may provide that the transfer of an employee
    under this paragraph occur without reimbursement of the school or
    system concerned.
      (E) In this paragraph, the term "defense dependents' education
    system" means the program established and operated under section
    1402(a) of the Defense Dependents' Education Act of 1978 (20 U.S.C.

      1431 et seq.).

      substantive rights, protections, and procedural safeguards
      (including due process procedures) available to children with
      disabilities who are 3 to 5 years old under part B of such Act.

      (2) Paragraph (1) may not be construed as diminishing for
    children with disabilities enrolled in day educational programs
    provided for under this section the extent of substantive rights,
    protections, and procedural safeguards that were available under
    section 6(a) of Public Law 81-874 (20 U.S.C. 241(a)) to children
    with disabilities as of October 7, 1991.

    dependent of an employee of a Federal agency outside the Department
    of Defense, the head of the other Federal agency shall, upon
    request of the Secretary of Defense, reimburse the Secretary for
    those services at rates routinely prescribed by the Secretary for

    Secretary for the operation of educational programs under this
    section.

    the armed forces or a dependent of a Federal employee to continue

    pursuant to subsection (a) for the remainder of a school year
    notwithstanding a change during such school year in the status of
    the member or Federal employee that, except for this paragraph,
    would otherwise terminate the eligibility of the dependent to be
    enrolled in the program.
      (2) The Secretary may, for good cause, authorize a dependent of a

    dependent to be enrolled in the program. The enrollment may
    continue for as long as the Secretary considers appropriate.
      (3) Paragraphs (1) and (2) do not limit the authority of the
    Secretary to remove a dependent from enrollment in an educational
    program provided by the Secretary pursuant to subsection (a) at any
    time for good cause determined by the Secretary.

    definitions as apply to the determination of such status with
    respect to Federal employees in the administration of this section.
      (4) Subsection (g) shall apply with respect to determining the

      (c) Annual Certification by Secretary of Defense. - Private
    sector employees may receive instruction at the National Defense

    Committee on Armed Services of the House of Representatives, that
    providing instruction to private sector employees under this
    section during that year will further national security interests
    of the United States.
      (d) Program Requirements. - The Secretary of Defense shall ensure
    that - 
        (1) the curriculum for the professional military education

      continue to be determined solely by the needs of the Department
      of Defense.

      (e) Tuition. - The President of the National Defense University
    shall charge students enrolled under this section a rate - 
        (1) that is at least the rate charged for employees of the
      United States outside the Department of Defense, less
      infrastructure costs, and
        (2) that considers the value to the school and course of the
      private sector student.

      (f) Standards of Conduct. - While receiving instruction at the
    National Defense University, students enrolled under this section,
    to the extent practicable, are subject to the same regulations
    governing academic performance, attendance, norms of behavior, and
    enrollment as apply to Government civilian employees receiving
    instruction at the university.
      (g) Use of Funds. - Amounts received by the National Defense
    University for instruction of students enrolled under this section
    shall be retained by the university to defray the costs of such
    instruction. The source, and the disposition, of such funds shall
    be specifically identified in records of the university.
