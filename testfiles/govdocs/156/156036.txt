    Description:
      Abstract:
        This GIS overlay is a component of the U. S. Geological Survey,
        Woods Hole Field Center's, Gulf of Mexico ArcView GIS database. The
        Gulf of Mexico GIS database is intended to organize and display USGS
        held data and provide on-line (WWW) access to the data and/or metadata.
      Purpose:
        This ArcView shapefile an additional GIS overlay. It contains the
        names of various seafloor features (basins, slopes, knolls, ridges,
        etc.) for the Gulf of Mexico.
      Supplemental_Information:
        This ArcView shapefile was created from a Microsoft Excel spread
        sheet found at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric's National
        Geophysical Data Center's website. The information contained in the
        spread sheet was editted to include only those features that would
        pertain to the planned Gulf of Mexico Internet Map Server for the
        USGS, Woods Hole Field center. Therefore, this is not a complete
        listing as would be found from NOAA-NGDC.

        Process_Description:
          The Microsoft Excel datafile was downloaded from the NOAA-NGDC site.
          Records that did not contain a latitude/longitude coordinate for a
          feature name were deleted from the spreadsheet.  The text fields
          containing the latitude and longitude coordinate of the seafloor
          feature were then copied and added to the spreadsheet as the first
          two fields.  These fields were added so numeric latitude longitude
          fields recorded as signed decimal degrees could be created later.
          The modified spreadsheet was saved as a comma separated values text file.

        Process_Description:
          The comma separated values file was processed on a UNIX operating
          system to convert the first two text fields that contained the
          feature coordinates to numeric, signed decimal degree fields.

      Process_Step:
        Process_Description:
          The text file with geographic coordinates was read into ArcView as a
          table. Features locations that did not fall within the bounds of the
          Gulf of Mexico IMS were eliminated, and the remaining table
          information was converted to an ArcView shapefile.
