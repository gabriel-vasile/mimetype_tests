 PUBLIC  NOTICE  FEDERAL  COMMUNICATIONS  COMMISSION  445  12th  STREET,  S.  W.  WASHINGTON,  D.  C.  20554 
 News  media  information  202/  418-  0500  Fax-  On-  Demand  202/  418-  2830  Internet:  http://  www.  fcc.  gov  ftp.  fcc.  gov 
 Report  No.  148  November  29,  2000 
 MASS  MEDIA  BUREAU  MULTIPOINT  DISTRIBUTION  SERVICE  AND 
 INSTRUCTIONAL  TELEVISION  FIXED  SERVICE  APPLICATIONS 
 TENDERED  FOR  FILING 


 Notice  is  hereby  given  that  the  applications  listed  below  for  Multipoint  Distribution  Service  (MDS) 
 and  Instructional  Television  Fixed  Service  (ITFS)  were  tendered  for  filing  for  the  initial  filing  window, 
 August  14  through  18,  2000.  See  Public  Notice,  15  FCC  Rcd  11466  (DA  00-  1481,  rel. 
 June  30,  2000). 


 Following  this  public  notice,  applicants  have  a  period  of  sixty  (60)  days  to  amend  their  applications. 
 These  amendments  must  not  result  in  any  increase  in  interference  to  any  previously  proposed  or 
 authorized  station,  or  to  facilities  proposed  during  the  filing  window,  absent  consent  of  the  licensee  of, 
 or  applicant  for,  the  authorized  or  proposed  station  that  would  receive  such  additional  interference. 
 See  47  C.  F.  R.  §§  21.27  and  74.911.  All  amendments  must  be  filed  electronically  via  the  Internet  through  the  Mass  Media  Bureau’s  Broadband  Licensing  System  (BLS)  at: 


 http://  www.  fcc.  gov/  mmb  no  later  than  the  close  of  business  January  29,  2001.  MDS  and  ITFS 
 applicants  for  two-  way  authority  shall  submit  electronically  their  amendments  using  FCC  Form  331. 
 All  amendments  and  modifications  to  ITFS  main  stations  must  be  filed  electronically  on  FCC  Form 
 330,  including  proposals  for  two-  way  transmissions  of  the  main  station. 


 Each  amendment  must  identify  the  MDS  or  ITFS  application  by  its  file  number  and  the  proposed  or 
 authorized  station  by  its  facility  identification  number.  Response  station  hubs,  signal  booster  stations 
 and  I  channels  are  considered  stand-  alone  stations  and  thus  have  unique  facility  ID  numbers  separate 
 from  the  associated  main  stations.  The  correct  facility  ID  number  can  be  found  through  a  BLS  public 
 access  search.  If  an  amendment  results  in  a  change  in  the  required  Methodology,  the  applicant  must 
 submit  a  revised  CD-  ROM  or  3.5-  inch  diskette  showing  the  amended  Methodology  to  the  FCC 
 Reference  Information  Center,  445  12th  Street,  SW,  Room  CY-  A257,  Washington,  DC,  20554.  The 
 applications  and  any  amendments  will  be  available  for  public  inspection  and  copying  during  regular 
 business  hours  at  the  FCC  Reference  Information  Center.  In  addition,  applicants  and  members  of  the 
 public  have  online  access  to  MDS  and  ITFS  applications  and  station  information  through  the  BLS. 


 After  this  60-  day  amendment  period,  the  Commission  will  issue  a  public  notice  announcing  those 
 applications  accepted  for  filing.  All  petitions  to  deny  such  applications  must  be  filed  no  later  than  the 
 sixtieth  (60th)  day  after  the  date  of  that  public  notice.  See  47  C.  F.  R.  §§  21.27,  21.909,  21.913, 
 74.911,  74.939  and  74.985. 


 For  further  information,  contact  Melvin  Collins  at  (202)  418-  1622  or  Nazifa  Naim  at  418-  7059.
