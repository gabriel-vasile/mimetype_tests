    PM</small><p>I totally disagree with the position of WDIA stated below and am in support
    of The Financial Modernization Act both as an individual and as the owner of a business
    who uses credit reporting agencies for the valid purposes of checking credit history
    before leasing valueable assets. As it is vital in today's economy to have accounts at
    financial institutions, I strongly believe that these institutions and the credit agencies
    necessary for their business, should not give out my name and address to outsiders.
    Despite their arguement that these items are &quot;public information&quot; that is simply
    not true. My name and address are not published in the phone book if I have an unlisted
    number. My address is only printed on my checks if I request that it be. I only give
    checks to individuals that I want to have that information and/or that have promised to
    keep that information confidential. My credit cards have my name on them but not my
    address. I have no obligation to put my name on my mailbox. My address and phone number
    are NOT public information. I also find it overly burdensome to have to write my financial
    institutions and request that they not give out my personal information. </p>
    <p>I AM IN FAVOR OF the proposed regulations to implement Title V of the
    Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 </p>

    <p><small>Dear Business User: </small></p>
    <p><small>You are about to lose some of your most valuable business tools! We are urging
    you to write or email 5 government agencies before the March 31st deadline... Save your
    right to access this data!!! </small></p>
    <p><small>A sample letter is included below. </small></p>
    <p><small>Any organization that uses consumer information to conduct business knows that
    regulatory and legislative scrutiny is at an all time high. This environment has given
    rise to a situation that demands a swift and comprehensive reaction from all businesses
    that rely on accessible, accurate, and publicly available consumer information. </small></p>
    <p><small>The Financial Modernization Act (FMA) is intended to protect consumer interests
    regarding the use of personal financial information and many companies, including W.D.I.A.
    Corporation, applaud the objectives of the act, however, something has gone awry. </small></p>
    <p><small>The Federal Reserve Board of Governors, The Federal Deposit Insurance
    Corporation, Department of the Treasury, Office of Thrift Supervision, Comptroller of the
    Currency, and Federal Trade Commission have wrongly interpreted the intent and scope of
    the FMA as passed by Congress. And that distortion has the potential to seriously disrupt
    the ontributions that the consumer credit infrastructure makes to the overall economy, not
    to mention your particular business. While logic, overall benefits to the economy, and the
    interests of consumers would seem to provide a powerful impetus for the regulatory
    agencies to avoid broad stroke interpretations, to date they are heading in exactly that
    direction. </small></p>
    <p><small>If allowed to stand as defined today, these regulations will effectively
    eliminate a long list of information products currently in use. W.D.I.A. Corporation is
    suggesting that our customers who are concerned about losing access to valuable business
    tools, join us in presenting articulate and logic based comments to the regulatory agency
    that has enforcement authority over your business. </small></p>
    <p><small>We at W.D.I.A. have a vested interest in the future success of your business. As
    a customer service, we have developed a positioning document below that outlines our
    opinion and which will form the basis of our official comments. We urge you to work with
    your legal counsel, government affairs office, or trade association to review the W.D.I.A.
    position and develop your own or your industry's comments for submission to the
    regulators. </small></p>
    <p><small>Many information products are at risk of becoming inaccessible to your company.
    This is a very time sensitive issue! Comments to regulators are due by March 31st. Please
    act as quickly as possible to protect the tools our industry uses to effectively serve the
    consumer marketplace! </small></p>

    <p><small>Comments on Proposed Regulation P Privacy of Consumer Financial Information
    February 16, 2000 </small></p>
    <p><small>The Regulations issued by the Regulatory Agencies under the Financial
    Modernization Act, define &quot;Nonpublic Personal Information&quot; in a way that ignores
    the plain language of the Act and goes far beyond the intended purpose of protecting the
    financial information of consumers. The result will cause serious harm to any company that
    uses names and addresses to contact their current or prospective customers. It will have a
    serious negative impact on electronic commerce and its security by interfering with
    digital certificate identifications. It will make address verifications unavailable for
    internet companies that need to verify identities and addresses of customers prior to
    shipping products. It will result in data being unavailable for utilities that need to
    verify occupants for service, telecommunications companies that verify identities of
    prospective customers, insurance companies that need to locate policy holders, state
    government unclaimed fund departments, companies that have returned mail, law enforcement
    and government agencies, such as the IRS, that need to locate individuals or investigate
    fraud and universities that seek to locate alumni. It will interfere with fraud prevention
    by the private sector, and it will seriously impact any company that engages in direct
    marketing, including financial institutions that send invitations to consumers to apply
    for credit. </small></p>
    <p><small><strong>I. The Potential Impact on the Economy </strong></small></p>
    <p><small>Credit bureaus have the most current name and address file available because
    consumers update their addresses with their credit card companies and other lenders when
    they move. That information is provided to credit bureaus on a regular basis. The
    information has the following uses: </small></p>
    <p><small>&quot;Header data&quot;, as found on consumer reports is used to update
    addresses on mailing lists by the direct marketing industry. </small></p>
    <p><small>Law enforcement agencies use it to locate suspects, witnesses, and dead beat
    parents. The IRS uses it for returned mail, or to verify social security numbers. </small></p>
    <p><small>Mutual Funds use it to locate lost shareholders. Banks use it to verify
    addresses when opening checking accounts. </small></p>
    <p><small>The internet economy will thrive if new companies can locate customers through
    direct mail and invite them to visit their web site. Start up electronic commerce
    companies cannot afford mass marketing, they cannot afford commercials on the Super Bowl,
    so they will need direct marketing to locate customers and be able to compete. As the mass
    media becomes more diversified, and less &quot;mass,&quot; as fewer consumers read general
    circulation magazines and newspapers, mass marketing becomes less effective and
    individualized direct marketing becomes more essential. </small></p>
    <p><small>Digital certificates used to assure security on the web will require means to
    verify addresses. </small></p>
    <p><small>Prior to the use of header data from consumer reporting agencies, the best
    available source of names and addresses was the telephone directory. If Regulation P
    prohibits the use of header data, all of the above industries and government agencies will
    be forced to return to the phone book for names and addresses and the emerging internet
    economy will be crippled. </small></p>
    <p><small><strong>II. The Law </strong></small></p>
    <p><small>The purpose of Title V is the &quot;protection of nonpublic personal
    information.&quot; All the obligations in the Title pertain to &quot;nonpublic personal
    information.&quot; There can be no Congressional interest in protecting information that
    is public or not sensitive. The term &quot;nonpublic personal information&quot; is,
    therefore, defined with care. Title V, Section 509 (4), defines &quot;nonpublic personal
    information&quot; as &quot;personally identifiable financial information-(i) provided by a
    consumer to a financial institution; (ii) resulting from any transaction with the
    consumer?; or (iii) otherwise obtained by the financial institution.&quot;.. </small></p>
    <p><small>The information covered must, as an initial matter, be financial information.
    The act deals with financial institutions and the information they have as a result of
    being financial institutions, namely, financial information. The Act could not have been
    intended to address and protect information that financial institutions have, that many
    other companies or entities have with no requirement to provide the information any level
    protection. Information in the public domain, information in the phone book, information
    freely disclosed by consumers with no attempt to protect it, information not considered
    private or financial could not be the subject matter of the Act. The definition of
    &quot;financial information&quot; is critical to determine the coverage of the Act </small></p>
    <p><small>In addition, Congress went further to help clarify its intent. The Act does not
    address all information held by a financial institution about a consumer, only information
    that is financial and &quot;(i) provided by a consumer.&quot; When consumers enter into
    transactions with financial institutions, they often provide financial information such as
    income, other banking or credit relationships, assets, net worth, employment information
    and so on. Obviously, that information is nonpublic personal information intended to be
    protected. </small></p>
    <p><small>Further, the information must be financial information &quot;(ii) resulting from
    any transaction with the consumer?&quot; The private financial information that results
    from a transaction is the performance information resulting from opening a credit account,
    such as balance information, payment information, and other events that result from the
    initial transaction. The fact that a consumer has an account is displayed by the consumer
    every time he or she uses a credit card or writes a check. No effort is made to treat it
    as private, or in need of protection. Congress included only financial information
    &quot;resulting from&quot; the transaction as subject to the requirements of the Act and
    protected. </small></p>
    <p><small>Finally, Congress required that to be covered by the requirements of the Title,
    the information must be financial information &quot;(iii) otherwise obtained?&quot;
    Information otherwise obtained would be such information as that which is obtained as a
    result of a background investigation, or from a credit report. That type if information is
    financial, uniquely in the hands of a financial institution, considered private by the
    consumer, and a proper subject of protection. </small></p>
    <p><small>As can be seen, the definition is complex, well thought out, carefully crafted,
    and intended to protect what is truly private and financial. </small></p>
    <p><small><strong>III The Regulations </strong></small></p>
    <p><small>Unfortunately, the definition in the Regulations treat much of the definition in
    the law as surplusage. They do this by defining &quot;financial&quot; so broadly that it
    defies ordinary logic and word usage. &quot;The Agencies recognize that this
    interpretation may result in certain information being covered by the rules that my not be
    considered intrinsically financial?&quot; But not only is the information covered not
    intrinsically financial, it also violates ordinary rules of statutory construction, and
    ignores words and sections in the Law. </small></p>
    <p><small>As the Regulations recognize, the statute sets out three categories of financial
    information, as recited above, that the information must meet in order to be covered. By
    establishing three categories, the definition, like any definition, is intended to
    distinguish between covered information, and information that is not covered. However, by
    defining &quot;financial information&quot; so broadly in the Regulations, the categories
    become surplusage, since no information is not covered. This is true under Alternative A
    as well as Alternative B. </small></p>
    <p><small>A. Under Alternative A, any information provided by a consumer to a financial
    institution, including name and address and other identifiers, is covered whether or not
    it is otherwise publicly available. In other words, all information a financial
    institution has about a consumer is &quot;nonpublic personal information.&quot; Under this
    interpretation, it is impossible for a financial institution to have any information about
    a consumer that is not covered. The definition distinguishes nothing and there is no need
    to consider the categories. Everything is financial information, and as a result covered
    whether or not is obtained from the consumer, results from the transaction, or is
    otherwise obtained. If that were the intent, it would have been easy for Congress to say
    so. Although that may be, as the commentary says, &quot;a workable and clear standard for
    distinguishing information that is financial from other personal information,&quot; it is
    not reasonable, and cannot reflect Congressional intent. </small></p>
    <p><small>B. Under Alternative B, if information is publicly available, it is not
    financial information even if not obtained from public sources. That definition, at least,
    creates some distinction between information that is covered and information that is not
    covered. However, the same problem arises when the categories are considered. </small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small>a)Clearly, some information that a financial institution has about a consumer,
      under this alternative, is not &quot;financial.&quot; Under the first category, name and
      address and other identifiers are provided by the consumer and are not covered if that
      information is publicly available. The definition works and the words in the statute have
      meaning, even though limited, because it still covers what most consumers do not consider
      financial or private information, such as name and address. </small></p>
      <p><small>b)However, what information would not be covered by the second category? What
      information &quot;resulting from the transaction&quot; is not also financial? Clearly,
      &quot;account balance information, payment or overdraft history, and credit or debit card
      purchase information,&quot; which is cited by the Regulators, &quot;results&quot; from the
      transaction and is inarguably financial information. But then, what information is not? It
      appears that all information a financial institution has about a consumer is covered by
      the second category, because of the expansive definition of &quot;financial
      information&quot; making the section surplusage. That result is contrary to ordinary rules
      of statutory construction, that all words and sections of a statute are to be given
      meaning. A reasonable interpretation that gives meaning to the section is that balance
      information, payment history, and the other element cited as &quot;resulting from the
      transaction&quot; are covered, but a mere list of customers is not. </small></p>
      <p><small>c) The same is true of the third category. Information &quot;otherwise
      obtained,&quot; such as information from a consumer report, is covered. Information
      otherwise obtained that is not of a financial nature, is not. Without a distinction
      between financial and non-financial information, the third category has no meaning and
      does not add any distinction to the definition. </small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small>Accordingly, the Regulators should redefine &quot;financial information&quot; in
    a way that gives meaning to all parts of the definition; namely, financial information is
    information of a financial and private nature, under the ordinary meaning and
    understanding of the word. </small></p>
    <p><small>IV. Impact of the Proposed Regulations </small></p>
    <p><small>Account information, which includes names and addresses, is given to credit
    bureaus by financial institutions, under an exception in the Act, that does not subject
    the information to the notice and opt-out requirement. A general exception that the Act is
    not to impact the operation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act permits credit bureaus to
    disclose credit eligibility information as permitted by that Act. However, header data is
    not governed by FCRA since it is not eligibility information. It is not governed by the
    Banking Reform Act because it is not personally identifiable financial information. But
    now, it is governed by the Regulations, because they ignore the well crafted definitions
    in the Act. As a result, if the Regulations stand, header data cannot be used for internet
    or other verification, location, law enforcement, fraud prevention, address correction, or
    any of the other purposes listed above. </small></p>
    <p><small>Therefore, it is imperative that the Regulators take into account Congressional
    intent, using rules of statutory construction, and define the terms in accordance with
    ordinary understanding of their meaning, thereby protecting personal financial
    information, as the statute envisions. </small></p>

    <p><small>Regarding: Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Privacy Rule 16 CFR Part 313- Comment Federal
    Reserve Board Docket No R-1058 Office of Thrift Supervision Docket No 2000-13 </small></p>
    <p><small>To Whom It May Concern: I am writing to express my concern with the proposed
    regulations to implement Title V of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999. As a business
    professional and small business person, I fear we would lose a valuable and very necessary
    source of locating individuals if &quot;non-public personal information&quot; is defined
    to include simple names and addresses of customers of financial institutions. </small></p>
    <p><small>It was my impression that the clear intent of Congress was to provide an
    opportunity for customers of financial institutions to &quot;opt-out&quot; of sharing
    their personal financial information with non-affiliates of the institutions. </small></p>
    <p><small>The statute provides protection for financial information--not mere names and
    addresses. If all information available to a financial institution is defined as
    &quot;non-public personal information,&quot; then what is &quot;public&quot;? Congress
    seemed to be offering a distinction by describing financial information. I believe the Act
    provides opt-out of information regarding credit history, employment and financial assets.
    But name, address and phone number should not be classified as &quot;non-public.&quot;
    Credit bureaus have the most current name and address file available because consumers
    update their addresses with their credit card companies and other lenders when they move.
    That information is provided to credit bureaus on a regular basis. The information has the
    following uses: </small></p>
    <p><small>&quot;Header data&quot;, as found on consumer reports is used to update
    addresses on mailing lists by the direct marketing industry. Law enforcement agencies use
    it to locate suspects, witnesses, and dead beat parents. The IRS uses it for returned
    mail, or to verify social security numbers. Mutual Funds use it to locate lost
    shareholders. Banks use it to verify addresses when opening checking accounts. The
    internet economy will thrive if new companies can locate customers through direct mail and
    invite them to visit their web site. Start up electronic commerce companies cannot afford
    mass marketing, they cannot afford commercials on the Super Bowl, so they will need direct
    marketing to locate customers and be able to compete. As the mass media becomes more
    diversified, and less &quot;mass,&quot; as fewer consumers read general circulation
    magazines and newspapers, mass marketing becomes less effective and individualized direct
    marketing becomes more essential. Digital certificates used to assure security on the web
    will require means to verify addresses. Prior to the use of header data from consumer
    reporting agencies, the best available source of names and addresses was the telephone
    directory. If Regulation P prohibits the use of header data, all of the above industries
    and government agencies will be forced to return to the phone book for names and addresses
    and the emerging internet economy will be crippled. If this information is deemed
    &quot;non-public personal,&quot; only wrongdoers and criminals will benefit and the
    law-abiding consumer will be the loser. I urge you to define non-public personal
    information in the manner that Congress intended. </small></p>
