&nbsp;
Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants: Notice of Receipt&nbsp;
of an Application for an Incidental Take Permit and Availability and&nbsp;
Opening of Comment Period for an Environmental Assessment/Habitat&nbsp;
Conservation Plan (EA/HCP) for the Red-Cockaded Woodpecker in&nbsp;
Association With Mr. Owen Strickler's Timber Harvest of a 75-acre Tract&nbsp;
of Forest on the Border of Sussex and Southampton Counties, Virginia

AGENCY: U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.

ACTION: Notice of availability and receipt of application.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: This document advises the public that Mr. Owen Strickler&nbsp;
(president and owner of Virginia-Carolina Properties) has applied to&nbsp;
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) for an incidental take&nbsp;
permit (ITP) pursuant to section 10(a)(1)(B) of the Endangered Species&nbsp;
Act of 1973 (ESA), as amended. The application has been assigned permit&nbsp;
number (TE090858-0). The proposed permit would authorize the incidental&nbsp;
take of a federally endangered species, the red-cockaded woodpecker&nbsp;
(RCW) (Picoides borealis), known to occur on property owned by the&nbsp;
applicant and located off of State Route 612 on the border of Sussex&nbsp;
and Southampton Counties, Virginia. The proposed taking is incidental&nbsp;
to the planned timber harvest of the 75-acre tract of land. The permit&nbsp;
would be in effect for up to 5 years depending on the availability of&nbsp;
donor RCWs at Carolina Sandhills National Wildlife Refuge to be&nbsp;
translocated for mitigation.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Service announces the receipt of the Strickler ITP application&nbsp;
and the

[[Page 50148]]

availability of the proposed Strickler HCP, which accompanies the ITP&nbsp;
application, for public comment. In addition, the Service also&nbsp;
announces the availability of a draft EA for the proposed issuance of&nbsp;
the ITP. This notice is provided pursuant to section 10(c) of the ESA&nbsp;
and National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) regulations (40&nbsp;
CFR 1506.6).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Service will evaluate the application, associated documents,&nbsp;
and comments submitted thereon to determine whether the application&nbsp;
meets the requirements of NEPA regulations and section 10(a) of the&nbsp;
ESA. If it is determined that the requirements are met, a permit will&nbsp;
be issued for the incidental take of the RCW. The final NEPA and permit&nbsp;
determinations will not be completed until after the end of the 60-day&nbsp;
comment period and will fully consider all public comments received&nbsp;
during the comment period.

DATES: Written comments on the permit application, HCP, and EA should&nbsp;
be sent to the Virginia Field Office (VAFO) (see ADDRESSES) and should&nbsp;
be received on or before October 12, 2004.

ADDRESSES: Persons wishing to review the permit application, HCP, and&nbsp;
draft EA may obtain a copy by writing the U.S. Fish and Wildlife&nbsp;
Service, Virginia Field Office, 6669 Short Lane, Gloucester, Virginia&nbsp;
23061. Requests for the documentation must be in writing to be&nbsp;
processed. Documents will also be available for public inspection by&nbsp;
written request, by appointment only, during normal business hours (8&nbsp;
to 4:30). Written data or comments concerning the permit application,&nbsp;
draft EA, and/or HCP should also be addressed to the Field Supervisor,&nbsp;
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Virginia Field Office, Gloucester,&nbsp;
Virginia. Please refer to permit (TE090858-0) when submitting comments.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Jolie Harrison or Mr. Eric Davis,&nbsp;
VAFO, at (804) 693-6694 (see ADDRESSES above).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 9 of the ESA and Federal regulation&nbsp;
prohibits the ``taking'' of a species listed as endangered or&nbsp;
threatened. Under the ESA, the term ``take'' means to harass, harm,&nbsp;
pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect listed&nbsp;
wildlife, or to attempt to engage in any such conduct. The Service may,&nbsp;
under limited circumstances, issue permits to ``incidentally take''&nbsp;
listed species, if such taking is incidental to, and not the purpose&nbsp;
of, otherwise lawful activities. Regulations governing permits for&nbsp;
endangered species are promulgated in 50 CFR 17.22.

Background

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Strickler has applied to the Service for an incidental take&nbsp;
permit pursuant to section 10(a) of the ESA. The Applicant proposes to&nbsp;
implement an HCP for the RCW that will allow removal of RCW habitat.&nbsp;
The Applicant's proposed timber harvest is likely to result in take, as&nbsp;
defined in the ESA and its implementing regulations, of listed species.&nbsp;
Authorized take would only affect the RCW; take of other federally&nbsp;
listed species is specifically excluded from the proposed action. This&nbsp;
permit would authorize the incidental take of one RCW group, consisting&nbsp;
of a single male, at Mr. Strickler's property, through otherwise lawful&nbsp;
activities, specifically the harvest of 75 acres of timber, occurring&nbsp;
in RCW habitat. The HCP and permit would be in effect for a maximum of&nbsp;
5 years upon issuance.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Applicant proposes the harvest of all mature timber at his 75-
acre site. Timber will be harvested using a feller buncher, which will&nbsp;
transport cut trees directly to a log deck, where they will be loaded&nbsp;
onto a truck and transported to Mr. Strickler's mill. The site will&nbsp;
undergo a prescribed burn and subsequently be replanted with loblolly&nbsp;
pine (Pinus taeda). The southern boundary of the project area is&nbsp;
approximately 2,000 feet north of State Route 612 where it joins State&nbsp;
Route 615 in Southampton County.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The anticipated incidental take will consist of harm through&nbsp;
permanent loss of 75 acres of foraging habitat and a cluster of cavity&nbsp;
trees, as well as possible death of one RCW from predation or&nbsp;
starvation due to the subsequent lack of shelter or foraging habitat.&nbsp;
Mr. Strickler proposes to implement measures to minimize, mitigate, and&nbsp;
monitor impacts to the RCW. Through an agreement with the Center for&nbsp;
Conservation Biology, College of William and Mary, impacts to the lone&nbsp;
male RCW will be minimized by removing him from the project site prior&nbsp;
to timber harvest and placing him in a prepared cavity at an active&nbsp;
cluster (at the Piney Grove Preserve, Sussex, Virginia) with a subadult&nbsp;
female moved in simultaneously. Through an agreement with The Nature&nbsp;
Conservancy, if the translocated lone male does not remain at Piney&nbsp;
Grove, his loss will be mitigated by translocating a maximum of three&nbsp;
subadult pairs from the designated donor population at the Carolina&nbsp;
Sandhills National Wildlife Refuge in McBee, South Carolina to the&nbsp;
Piney Grove Preserve.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The draft EA considers the environmental consequences of three&nbsp;
alternatives: A no-action alternative, permit issuance (the proposed&nbsp;
alternative), and issuance of permit with conditions (selective&nbsp;
harvest).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Service provides this notice pursuant to section 10(c) of the&nbsp;
ESA. The Service will evaluate whether the issuance of a section&nbsp;
10(a)1)(B) ITP complies with section 7 of the ESA by conducting an&nbsp;
intra-Service section 7 consultation. The results of the biological&nbsp;
opinion, in combination with the evaluation of the permit application,&nbsp;
the HCP, EA, and comments submitted thereon, will be used in the final&nbsp;
analysis to determine whether the application meets the requirements of&nbsp;
section 10(a) of the ESA. If the requirements are met, the Service will&nbsp;
issue a permit to Mr. Strickler for the incidental take of one RCW&nbsp;
group, consisting of one male, during the proposed harvest of timber on&nbsp;
the 75-acre project site. We will make the final permit decision no&nbsp;
sooner than 60 days from the date of this notice.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pursuant to an order issued on June 10, 2004, by the District Court&nbsp;
for the District of Columbia in Spirit of the Sage Council v. Norton,&nbsp;
Civil Action No. 98-1873 (D. D.C.), the Service is enjoined from&nbsp;
issuing new section 10(a)(1)(B) permits or related documents containing&nbsp;
``No Surprises'' assurances, as defined by the Service's ``No&nbsp;
Surprises'' rule published at 63 FR 8859 (February 23, 1998), until&nbsp;
such time as the Service adopts new permit revocation rules&nbsp;
specifically applicable to section 10(a)(1)(B) permits in compliance&nbsp;
with the public notice and comment requirements of the Administrative&nbsp;
Procedures Act. This notice concerns a step in the review and&nbsp;
processing of a section 10(a)(1)(B) permit and any subsequent permit&nbsp;
issuance will be in accordance with the Court's order. Until such time&nbsp;
as the June 10, 2004, order has been rescinded or the Service's&nbsp;
authority to issue permits with ``No Surprises'' assurances has been&nbsp;
otherwise reinstated, the Service will not approve any incidental take&nbsp;
permits or related documents that contain ``No Surprises'' assurances.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comments, including names and home addresses of respondents, will&nbsp;
be available for public review during regular business hours.&nbsp;
Individual respondents may request confidentiality. If you wish us to&nbsp;
withhold your name and or address from public review or from disclosure&nbsp;
under the Freedom of Information Act, you must state this prominently&nbsp;
at the beginning of your written comment. Such requests will be honored&nbsp;
to the extent allowed by law. We will not, however, consider anonymous
