MORNING UPDATE...EXCEPT FOR THE FAR NORTH...MOST OF THE CWA IS                  
EXPERIENCING FILTERED SUNSHINE DUE TO MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES AT THE MID            
AND UPPER LEVELS. MID/UPPER LEVEL CLOUDINESS SHOULD STAY WITH US FOR            
THE DAY AS LATEST RUC RUN SHOWS THAT THE 250MB JET AXIS WILL REMAIN             
NORTH OF OUR AREA THROUGH THE EVENING. WEST TO NORTHWEST WINDS WILL             
SLOWLY INCREASE AS TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE OFF THE GA/SC COAST                   
DEVELOPS INTO A CLOSED SURFACE LOW BY THIS EVENING. LATEST MSAS

...UPDATE TO INCLUDE MENTION OF P-TYPE...                                       
IT STILL APPEARS THAT THE PRECIPITATION WILL HAVE A VERY DIFFICULT              
TIME ADVANCING FAR ENOUGH INTO THE PIEDMONT THROUGH 15Z/TUE... WHERE            
P-TYPE WOULD BE A SLIGHT CONCERN. THE TOP DOWN METHOD COMBINED WITH             
OUR PARTIAL THICKNESS SCHEMES INDICATE THAT THERE COULD BE WET SNOW             
FLAKES OR SLEET MIXED IN WITH THE LIGHT RAIN OVER THE PIEDMONT                  
BETWEEN 10Z-15Z TUESDAY...(IF)... THE PRECIP REACHES THAT FAR DURING

AIR ALOFT AND IN THE BOUNDARY LAYER. REGARDLESS... SURFACE TEMPS ARE            
EXPECTED TO REMAIN ABOVE 32. AFTER 15Z... WARMER MID LEVEL AIR IS               
EXPECTED TO COME WESTWARD OVER THE PIEDMONT FROM THE ATLANTIC                   
STRONGLY INDICATING COLD RAIN.

THE CLASSIC INSTANT OCCLUSION CYCLOGENESIS CONTINUES THIS EVENING.              
A DEVELOPING SURFACE LOW WAS CENTERED ABOUT 150 MILES EAST OF CHS...            
ALONG THE SURFACE TROUGH... BUT WAS NOT YET DEEPENING SIGNIFICANTLY.            
THE MID LEVEL LOW WAS BEGINNING TO CLOSE OFF OVER GA. THERE                     
CONTINUES TO BE A POTENTIAL FOR RAPID INTENSIFICATION LATER TONIGHT             
AND TUESDAY... WHEN A WIDESPREAD COLD WIND DRIVEN RAIN WILL LIKELY              
OVERSPREAD MUCH OF CENTRAL NC FROM THE EAST... EXCEPT THE FAR                   
WESTERN PIEDMONT.

.SHORT TERM /REST OF TONIGHT/...                                                
EARLY ON WITH THIS DEVELOPING STORM OFF THE SE U.S. COAST... THERE              
IS A BIG BATTLE OF LOW LEVEL DRY AIR SURGING SOUTH FROM THE INTERIOR            
MID ATLANTIC STATES INTO CENTRAL NC (20S DEW POINTS)... AND THE                 
MOISTURE ASSOCIATED WITH THE STORM OFF THE SE COAST. THE DRY AIR WAS            
BEING DRIVEN SOUTHWARD BY A 1030 SURFACE HIGH EXTENDING FROM THE MS             
VALLEY NE INTO THE LOWER GREAT LAKES. AS THIS HIGH CONTINUES TO                 
DEVELOP EAST TOWARD PA/NY LATER TUE-WED... LOW LEVEL DRY AIR WILL BE            
IN CONTINUOUS SUPPLY INTO OUR PIEDMONT DAMMING REGION... WHICH WILL             
LIKELY CREATE A SHARP BACK EDGE TO THE SIGNIFICANT RAINS DURING THIS            
EVENT TUE AND TUE NIGHT. THE FAR NW PIEDMONT APPEARS THAT IT WILL BE            
ON THIS BACK EDGE DURING THIS TIME FRAME.                                       
THE LATEST SATELLITE DATA INDICATED CLEAR TO PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES                
OVER THE PIEDMONT... WITH A SHARP INCREASE IN CLOUDS FROM RALEIGH               
AND FAYETTEVILLE EASTWARD.THE MID EVENING RADAR DATA DEPICTED                   
SEVERAL BANDS OF RAIN SPREADING NORTHWEST INTO COASTAL SE NC... WITH            
CONVECTION CONTINUING OVER THE GULF STREAM. LIGHT RAIN HAS BEEN                 
FALLING OVER SAMPSON AND SE WAYNE COUNTIES THIS EVENING... WITH ONLY            
A FEW HUNDREDTHS OF AN INCH RECORDED THUS FAR. THE RAIN HAS BEEN

MID ATLANTIC STATES INTO CENTRAL NC (20S DEW POINTS)... AND THE                 
MOISTURE ASSOCIATED WITH THE STORM OFF THE SE COAST. THE DRY AIR WAS            
BEING DRIVEN SOUTHWARD BY A 1030 SURFACE HIGH EXTENDING FROM THE MS             
VALLEY NE INTO THE LOWER GREAT LAKES. AS THIS HIGH CONTINUES TO                 
DEVELOP EAST TOWARD PA/NY LATER TUE-WED... LOW LEVEL DRY AIR WILL BE

SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCED BY THE CURRENT CONVECTION OFF THE NC/SC                  
COAST. GIVEN THE AFOREMENTIONED CLASSIC INSTANT OCCLUSION                       
CYCLOGENESIS... BOTTOM LINE FOR CENTRAL NC IS THAT THERE IS                     
STRONG POTENTIAL FOR THE SURFACE LOW TO BE DEEPER AND CLOSER TO                 
THE COAST ALLOWING FOR MUCH GREATER POP AND QPF... ESPECIALLY IN

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...                                        
EXPECT THE CURRENT CLOUDY/FLURRY CONDITIONS OVER THE UPPER OHIO                 
VALLEY, ASSOCIATED WITH THE LINGERING COLD UPPER TROUGH, TO GIVE WAY            
TO MAINLY CLEAR SKIES TONIGHT AND TUESDAY, AS NAM-WRF AND GFS MODEL             
RUNS SHOW HIGH PRESSURE-ASSOCIATED SUBSIDENCE BUILDING INTO THE

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...                                    
MAINLY DRY WEATHER IN THE FORECAST AS HIGH PRESSURE WILL DOMINATE               
THE AREA. THE DEEP UPPER LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE              
USA WILL PULL NORTHEASTWARD ON FRIDAY UP THE EASTERN COAST LINE.                
THIS WILL GIVE A CHANCE OF SHOWERS TO THE EASTERN PORTION OF THE                
CWA BY FRIDAY NIGHT. UPPER LEVEL ZONAL FLOW WILL THEN SET UP                    
GIVING MORE SEASONAL TYPE WEATHER FOR THE WEEKEND.                              
BASICALLY WENT WITH HPC GUIDANCE FOR THE EXTENDED PERIOD AS THE                 
PACKAGE LOOKED PRETTY GOOD WITH ONLY THE PRECIP ON FRIDAY BEING OF              
CONCERN.                                                                        
THANKSGIVING DAY IS LOOKING NICE AS THE SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL              
KEEP THE REGION MOSTLY SUNNY. THE SUNSHINE WILL PROVIDE HIGH TEMPS              
THAT WILL BE A LITTLE BIT ABOVE NORMAL FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR.

CURRENT STRATOCUMULUS CLOUD SHIELD OVER THE UPPER OHIO VALLEY WILL              
BEGIN ERODING FROM THE WEST TONIGHT, AS INDICATED BY TRENDS IN                  
RECENT SATELLITE DATA AND RUC, NAM-WRF, AND GFS MODEL RUNS. SO                  
EXPECT CURRENT MVFR-VFR CEILINGS TO BECOME UNLIMITED TONIGHT.

HAS BEEN SHOWING AREAS OF VERY LIGHT SNOW (FLURRIES). THESE AREAS               
WILL BE DIMINISHING IN COVERAGE TOWARD EVENING, SO EXPECT THAT ANY              
ISOLATED LOWER VISIBILITIES WILL BE GONE BY AROUND SUNSET.

IN THE PAST SEVERAL HOURS AND SFC PRESSURES ACROSS THE NC/SC/GA                 
PIEDMONT HAVE RISEN ABOUT 2-3MB. THIS HAS PRODUCED A 3-5MB PRESS

RESPONDED AND ARE NOW GUSTING 35 MPH AT MANY COASTAL OBSERVATION

SUGGESTS A DEFORMATION ZONE WL SET UP ACROSS COASTAL NC AND SC

PERSISTENCE OF SHOWERS FOR THE NEXT TWO DAYS. WILL UPDATE THE FLOOD             
POTENTIAL OUTLOOK TO FOCUS MORE ON THE CHANCE FOR FLOODING IN AREAS             
NEAR THE COASTLINE...SUCH AS DOWNTOWN CHARLESTON. DO NOT FEEL THAT              
FLOODING POTENTIAL IS HIGH ENOUGH TO WARRANT A FLOOD WATCH FOR THE              
FORECAST AREA.                                                                  
DETAILS FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS ARE MUCH TRICKIER TO PIN DOWN...AS                
MODEL DISCREPANCIES CONTINUE WITH THE LATEST SOLUTIONS. 12Z GFS HAS             
WEAKENED THE SURFACE LOW QUITE A BIT ON TUESDAY AND TRACK IT FURTHER            
NORTH...THEREBY DECREASING WINDS AND PRECIP IMPACTS. NAM IS                     
NOTICEABLY MORE AGGRESSIVE IN INITIALLY DEEPENING THE COASTAL LOW               
AND SEEMS TO BE AN OUTLIER WITH THE OTHER MODELS. LATEST ECMWF FALLS            
BETWEEN THE GFS AND NAM CONCERNING STRENGTH OF THE COASTAL LOW.                 
WILL LEAN TOWARD THE GFS AND ECMWF SOLUTIONS...AND PREFER NOT TO                
MAKE DRASTIC CHANGES TO THE ONGOING PUBLIC FORECAST. MODEL SOLUTIONS            
HAVE BEEN JUMPY...AND JUST A LITTLE CHANGE IN THE ORIENTATION AND               
TRACK OF THE COASTAL LOW COULD CAUSE A LARGE CHANGE IN POPS. WOULD              
THUS PREFER TO REMAIN GENERIC WITH RAIN CHANCES. WILL INDICATE                  
LIKELY POPS FOR TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY IN THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE               
CWA CLOSEST TO THE WRAP AROUND PRECIP FROM THE COASTAL LOW...WITH               
CHANCE POPS FURTHER SOUTH.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...NO MAJOR CHANGES WERE MADE TO            
THE EXTENDED FORECAST THIS AFTERNOON IN ORDER TO FOCUS ON HIGH                  
IMPACT EVENT IN THE SHORT TERM. VERTICALLY STACKED LOW SYSTEM WILL              
GRADUALLY MOVE NORTH THROUGH THE END OF THE WEEK. RAIN CHANCES WILL             
LINGER ON THANKSGIVING DAY BEFORE HIGH PRESSURE SETS IN ON FRIDAY.              
LOOKS LIKE A DRY FORECAST FRIDAY THROUGH THE WEEKEND.                           
&&                                                                              
.MARINE...VIS SATELLITE AND SFC OBS INDICATES THE SFC LOW DEEPENING             
JUST E OF THE NAVY R2 TOWER. PREFERENCE IS WITH THE                             
ECMWF/CAN/UKMET/GFS SOLUTION CONCERNING THE NEXT THREE DAY/S FCST.              
THIS IS NOT QUITE AS STRONG AS THE PREVIOUS RUNS...AND SIGNIFICANTLY            
WEAKER THAN THE LATEST WRF SOLUTION. IN GENERAL...THE WRF APPEARS               
OVERDONE WITH THE SFC LOW AND ASSOCIATED WIND FIELD.                            
NEVERTHELESS...THE 925 MB WINDS SHOULD INCREASE DRAMATICALLY TONIGHT            
TO 35-45 KT...THEN TO 50-60 KT TUE AND TUE NIGHT. SFC WINDS SHOULD              
EASILY REACH GALE FORCE ACROSS ALL THE WATERS BEGINNING LATER                   
TONIGHT OR TUE MORNING. IN THE HARBOR...FREQUENT GUSTS TO GALE FORCE            
WILL BE THE MAIN THREAT. CONDITIONS LOOK TO STAY PRETTY NASTY                   
THROUGH TUE NIGHT...WITH WINDS BEGINNING TO TAPER OFF ON WED                    
ASSUMING THE SFC LOW BEGINS TO PULL AWAY FROM THE COAST AS                      
ADVERTISED. DO NOT PLAN ANY CHANGES TO CURRENT MARINE HEADLINES.                
FREQUENT STORM FORCE WIND GUSTS ARE EXPECTED OVER THE OUTER GA                  
WATERS LATE TONIGHT. SEAS SHOULD BUILD RAPIDLY TONIGHT...WITH 12                
FOOTERS POSSIBLE OVER THE FAR OUTER GA WATERS LATE. BUMPED DOWN                 
WINDS AND SEAS A TAD THROUGH THE PERIOD TO HINT AT THE NEWER MODEL              
SUITE BEING WEAKER.                                                             
WILL CONTINUE WITH WIND ADVISORY FOR THE COASTAL COUNTIES STARTING 3            
PM TUE. THE BEST CHANCE OF SEEING CRITERIA WINDS WILL BE RIGHT AT               
THE COAST...ALONG THE LAND-SEA INTERFACE. FARTHER INLAND...DO NOT               
EXPECT A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF LLVL MIXING WITH WEAK COLD ADVECTION              
THROUGH THE PERIOD.                                                             
THE END OF THE WEEK SHOULD BE MUCH IMPROVED AS THE LOW PRES SYSTEM              
PULLS OFF TO THE NE AND WEAK HIGH PRES BUILDS IN FROM THE N.                    
&&                                                                              
.COASTAL IMPACTS...THE DEVELOPING LOW PRES SYSTEM OFF THE COAST                 
COULD HAVE MUCH WORSE COASTAL IMPACTS IF IT WERE FARTHER TO THE                 
NORTHEAST. HOWEVER...WITH A NEARLY DUE NORTH WIND THROUGHOUT THIS               
EVENT...THE OFFSHORE FETCH WILL SIGNIFICANTLY LIMIT THE IMPACTS.                
COASTAL FLOODING DOES NOT LOOK TO BE A MAJOR THREAT ATTM...GIVEN                
THAT THE PREDICTED TIDES ARE A LITTLE ABOVE 6 FT AT CHS AND NO                  
HIGHER THAN 7.8 FT AT FT PULASKI...WITH STRONG OFFSHORE WINDS. THE              
THE ONLY WAY TO SEE COASTAL FLOODING WOULD BE AROUND THE TIMES OF               
HIGH TIDE WITH HEAVY RAINFALL. THIS WILL BE ADDRESSED IN THE FLOOD              
POTENTIAL OUTLOOK.                                                              
EROSION IS A POSSIBILITY...BUT AGAIN...A NORTHEAST FLOW WOULD BE                
OPTIMAL FOR SUCH OCCURRENCE. WILL CONTINUE MENTION OF THIS IN THE               
HWO AND SPS. A HIGH SURF ADVISORY MAY STILL BE REQUIRED FOR SOME                
PORTION OF THE COAST LATE IN THE DAY TUESDAY...BUT DUE TO THE LARGE             
UNCERTAINTY IN HOW MUCH THE SEAS WILL BUILD NEARSHORE...WILL HOLD               
OFF ON ISSUANCE ATTM.

.LAKE WINDS...GFS AND NAM CONTINUE TO SHOW 925 MB WINDS RAMPING UP              
QUICKLY THIS EVENING WITH 40 KT OR GREATER BY 06Z. MODEL SOUNDINGS              
OVER THE WATER SHOW A GOOD MIXING PROFILE AND THUS WE SHOULD SEE                
SOME PRETTY GUSTY CONDITIONS DEVELOPING OVER LAKE MOULTRIE TONIGHT.             
WILL CONTINUE WITH THE LAKE WIND ADVISORY AS CURRENTLY ADVERTISED.              
BEING THAT THE MODEL SUITE HAS BEEN TRENDING A BIT WEAKER WITH THE              
OVERALL SYSTEM...WE WILL NOT ISSUE ANY SORT OF HIGH WIND WATCH FOR

POSSIBILITY OF A HIGH WIND WARNING AT SOME POINT.

EASTERN WASHINGTON SOUTHEAST OF A LINE FROM HANFORD TO SPOKANE.                 
THIS LINE CORRELATES FAIRLY WELL WITH THE POSITION OF THE 850MB                 
FRONT. AS A SERIES OF WEAK SHORTWAVES PIVOT AROUND THE LARGE                    
UPPER LOW CENTERED OVER THE GULF OF ALASKA TODAY...THE 850MB FRONT              
WILL MAKE GRADUAL PROGRESS SOUTHEAST. ASIDE FROM THE

WILL BE BEST THIS MORNING FROM LA CROSSE TO PULLMAN SOUTHWARD TO                
LEWISTON. THE MAJORITY OF THE LOWER ELEVATIONS OF CENTRAL AND

STRATUS HAS BECOME WIDESPREAD OVER THE VALLEYS AND LOWLANDS EAST                
OF THE CASCADES THIS MORNING...AND LOW CLOUDS WILL BE TOUGH TO GET              
RID OF TODAY. I HAVE TRIMMED A FEW DEGREES FROM THE FORECAST HIGH

MID-LEVEL LAPSE RATES, WELL IN EXCESS OF 7CKM-1, WILL ACCOMPANY A               
SERIES OF VORT MAXES THAT WILL REMAIN OVER THE INLAND NW THRU AT                
LEAST THURS AS THE LONG-WAVE TROF SLOWLY TRANSITIONS E THRU THE PAC             
NW. WATER VAPOR LOOPER THIS MORNING CLEARLY SHOWS A NUMBER OF TIGHT             
VORT MAXES PASSING THRU THE OFFSHORE TROF. THESE VORT MAXES, WITH               
THEIR LOCALLY-ENHANCED INSTABILITY BELOW 500MB TEMPS OF -30C WILL               
LAUNCH A ROUND OF WIDESPREAD SHOWERS BEGINNING TUES FOR ALL FCST                
ZONES. THO THE LG-SCALE FORCING FOR ASCENT WILL NOT BE WOLD-

BEEN LOWERED TO 3K FT MSL FOR THE CASCADE ZONES TUES NT AND WED...AND           
ONLY 4K FT MSL FOR THE LEWISTON REGION. WITH THE TRACK OF THE ABOVE-            
MENTIONED VORT MAXES...THE BEST THREAT OF SIGNIFICANT SNOWS WILL                
STRETCH FROM THE E SLOPES OF THE CASCADES...TO THE OKANOGAN HIGHLANDS           
AND INTO THE NRN ID PANHANDLE. SNOW AMNTS APPROACHING ADVSY LEVELS

ITS NOT UNTIL FRI THAT THE UPPER TROF COMPLEX MOVES SLOWLY E OUT OF

MOISTURE DISCONTINUITY DELINEATING THE SUBTLE CHANGE IN AIRMASS.                
BEHIND THE FRONT...LOW STRATUS AND FOG HAS DROPPED FLIGHT CONDITIONS            
TO LESS THAN 1000 FEET IN AREAS OF THE VALLEYS EAST OF THE CASCADES.            
A GRADUAL IMPROVEMENT OF CEILINGS AND VISIBILITIES IS EXPECTED TODAY

.SYNOPSIS...                                                                    
08Z WATER VAPOR AND H4 RUC ANALYSIS SHOWING A HIGHLY AMPLIFIED UPPER            
PATTERN ACROSS THE CONUS. MAIN FEATURES INCLUDE AN UNSEASONABLY                 
DEEP AND SHARP TROUGH ALONG THE EAST COAST ANCHORED BY A UPPER LOW              
THAT IS JUST NOW CLOSING OFF OVER SOUTHERN GA/NORTHERN FLORIDA.                 
IMPRESSIVE POCKET OF COLD LOW/MID LEVEL AIR WITH THE UPPER LOW IN               
PLACE ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST WITH 850MB TEMPS FALLING INTO THE 3-7C               
BELOW ZERO RANGE ALL THE WAY INTO THE NORTHERN GULF OF MEXICO.                  
UPSTREAM FROM THE UPPER LOW WE SEE A LARGE UPPER RIDGE FROM THE FOUR            
CORNERS REGION UP THROUGH MUCH OF THE CENTRAL PLAINS AND INTO THE               
NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. A SERIES OF WEAK DISTURBANCES CAN BE               
SEEN ROUNDING THE TOP OF THIS UPPER RIDGE THROUGH THE PACIFIC                   
NORTHWEST AND INTO THE NORTHERN PLAINS. THESE IMPULSES WILL HAVE                
LITTLE IMPACT ON OUR WEATHER OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS.                        
SURFACE OBSERVATIONS AND IR SATELLITE IMAGERY IS NOW SHOWING THE                
PROJECTED SURFACE LOW OFF THE SOUTHEAST COAST TO BE TAKING SHAPE.               
REGIONAL RADAR IS ALSO NOW SHOWING AN AREA OF SHOWERS AND                       
THUNDERSTORMS BACKING IN TOWARD THE GA/NE FLORIDA COASTLINES. THIS              
SURFACE LOW AND THE ASSOCIATED CLOSED UPPER DISTURBANCE WILL BE THE             
MAIN FEATURES OF INTEREST ACROSS OUR FORECAST AREAS THROUGH THE NEXT            
72 HOURS.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...                                         
AS MENTIONED ABOVE...THE MAIN FORECAST CONCERN FOR THE SHORT TERM               
WILL BE THE EVOLUTION OF THE UPPER LOW / SURFACE LOW PAIR JUST OFF              
TO OUR EAST. WILL BE SEEING PERIOD OF CLOUDS AND EVEN                           
SPRINKLES/SHOWERS ROTATING SOUTH AND WEST FROM EASTERN GA OVER THE              
NEXT SEVERAL DAYS AND TIMING THESE IMPULSES AND HOW STRONG THEY WILL            
BE IS WHERE THIS FORECAST BECOMES A BIT TRICKY.                                 
TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY WILL SEE THE 552DM H5 UPPER LOW MOVE SLOWLY             
OFF THE SOUTHEAST COAST. AT THE SAME TIME THE SURFACE LOW WILL                  
CONTINUE TO SPIN JUST EAST OF THE GA COAST WHILE SLOWLY DEEPENING.              
STARTING THIS MORNING AND GOING THROUGH THE DAYLIGHT HOURS                      
ON WEDNESDAY WILL KEEP A SLIGHT TO LOW END CHANCE POP FOR MAINLY                
SPRINKLES OR SHOWERS ACROSS MOST OF OUR GA ZONES INTO THE BIG BEND              
ZONES. HAVE ALREADY THROUGH THE OVERNIGHT SEEN A FEW ECHOS ACROSS               
THESE AREAS WITH KVLD REPORTING A PERIOD OF LIGHT RAIN. FURTHER                 
WEST...GUIDANCE IS IN AGREEMENT OF THE DRY AIR WINNING OUT AND WILL             
GO WITH SILENT 10 POPS IN THE GRIDS. CLOUD-COVER WILL BE ANOTHER                
DIFFICULT VARIABLE. CURRENT THINKING IS THAT THERE WILL BE A FAIRLY             
SHARP CUTOFF TO THE EXTENSIVE CLOUDCOVER SOMEWHERE NEAR THE AL/GA               
BORDER. EAST OF THE BORDER WILL BE GOING WITH PREDOMINANTLY MOSTLY              
CLOUDY SKIES THROUGH WEDNESDAY...HOWEVER PERIODS OF SUN OR AT LEAST             
BREAKS OF SUN ARE LIKELY EVEN HERE AS LOBES OF SHORTWAVE ENERGY                 
ROTATE IN AND OUT OF THE AREA AROUND THE UPPER LOW.                             
A BIT MORE LINGERING LOWER CLOUDS ARE POSSIBLE IN THE FAR EAST                  
DURING WEDNESDAY NIGHT AS THE UPPER LOW BEGINS TO MOVE UP THE EAST              
COAST AWAY FROM THE AREA. SHOWER CHANCES SHOULD HAVE DIMINISHED ALL             
AREAS BY THIS TIME. IF CURRENT MODEL TRENDS WITH THIS UPPER SYSTEM              
PAN OUT AND THE LOW PULLS NORTH TO THE CAROLINA COAST BY THURSDAY               
MORNING THEN A PLEASANT AND SEASONABLE THANKSGIVING LOOKS IN STORE              
FOR THE AREA WITH UPPER RIDGING BUILDING OVERHEAD DURING THE DAY.               
.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...                                          
PERIOD OF DRY AND WARMER WEATHER LOOKS LIKELY FOR THE END OF THE                
WORKWEEK THROUGH THE UPCOMING WEEKEND. HIGH PRESSURE IS FORECAST TO             
BUILD EAST ACROSS THE CENTRAL AND EASTERN GULF COAST BY FRIDAY                  
MORNING AND THEN REMAIN IN PLACE INTO MONDAY MORNING. THE UPPER                 
PATTERN LOOKS TO BECOME QUITE ZONAL ACROSS THE REGION WITH ANY UPPER            
LEVEL ENERGY REMAINING WELL TO THE NORTH ACROSS THE TENNESSEE AND               
OHIO VALLEYS. CURRENT INDICATIONS ARE THAT THE NEXT SYSTEM TO AFFECT            
OUR FORECAST ZONES WOULD ARRIVE SOMETIME MONDAY NIGHT OR TUESDAY.               
LONG WAY OUT AT THIS POINT AND WILL COVER IN THE GRIDS WITH LOW END             
CHANCE POPS.

COASTAL WATERS IN BETWEEN DEVELOPING LOW PRESSURE JUST EAST OF THE              
GEORGIA COAST AND SURFACE HIGH OVER THE TEXAS COAST AND WESTERN                 
GULF. THE DEEPENING LOW TO OUR EAST WILL HELP TO KEEP THE GRADIENT              
FAIRLY TIGHT ACROSS THE COASTAL WATERS. FOR THIS REASON HAVE RAISED             
SMALL CRAFT ADVISORIES THROUGH THIS MORNING IN THE NEARSHORE WATERS             
WITH SMALL CRAFT ADVISORIES CONTINUING THROUGH TONIGHT ACROSS THE               
OFFSHORE WATERS. LOW PRESSURE SLOWLY RETREATS NORTH UP THE EAST                 
COAST ON THURSDAY WITH WINDS AND SEAS GRADUALLY SUBSIDING. HIGH                 
PRESSURE TO OUR WEST WILL THEN BUILD ACROSS THE COASTAL WATERS BY               
FRIDAY AND REMAIN IN PLACE THROUGH THE BULK OF THE UPCOMING WEEKEND.

DEVELOPING LOW PRESSURE OFF THE NORTHEAST FLORIDA COAST WILL                    
DOMINATE THE REGION THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD...MAINTAINING A                 
STRONG PRESSURE GRADIENT WHICH WILL SUPPORT CONTINUED GUSTY NORTH               
WINDS. AS THE LOW DEVELOPS TODAY...MOISTURE WRAPPING AROUND IT WILL             
SPREAD A DECK OF MOSTLY STRATO CU WITH ISOLATED PATCHES OF LIGHT                
RAIN OR SHOWERS SOUTH AND WEST ACROSS THE AREA. EXPECT CEILINGS TO

CONTINUE TO SPREAD COOL AIR SOUTHWARD ACROSS THE AREA ALONG WITH                
BRISK NORTHERLY WINDS. THE LOW WILL ALSO SPREAD CLOUDS AND ISOLATED             
LIGHT SHOWERS...MAINLY ACROSS SOUTH-CENTRAL GEORGIA AND THE EASTERN             
FLORIDA PANHANDLE. CONDITIONS MAY APPROACH RED FLAG CRITERIA THIS

BROAD RELATIVELY FLAT UPPER RIDGING PERSISTS ACROSS THE CENTRAL                 
CONUS THIS MORNING AS EVIDENCED BY WATER VAPOR IMAGERY AND SUPPORTED            
BY RUC UPPER AIR ANALYSES. SOME MOUNTAIN WAVE INDUCED CIRRUS IS                 
CURRENTLY FILTERING ACROSS THE CWA IN A WEST/NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT.              
MSAS OBJECTIVE SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A STRONG SURFACE HIGH CENTERED            
OVER THE EASTERN SOUTHERN PLAINS/LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY...AND A LEE           
TROUGH STRETCHING THROUGH THE HIGH PLAINS. THE GRADIENT BETWEEN                 
THESE TWO DOMINANT SURFACE FEATURES HAS KEPT SOUTHERLY WINDS UP                 
THROUGH THE NIGHT...WHICH IN TURN ARE HOLDING TEMPERATURES IN THE               
MID 30S TO LOWER 40S ACROSS MOST OF THE CWA AT THIS HOUR. HOWEVER THE           
TROUGH AXIS HAS MADE ITS WAY EAST INTO THE FAR WESTERN REACHES OF               
THE CWA WITH THE LATEST SURFACE OB FROM KLXN REPORTING CALM WINDS               
AND A TEMP OF 30F.                                                              
AN UPPER TROUGH MOVING INTO THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST WILL HELP TO PUSH             
THE UPPER RIDGE SLOWLY EAST ACROSS THE PLAINS TODAY. MEANWHILE THE              
LEE SURFACE TROUGH WILL BROADEN WITH THE PRESSURE GRADIENT WEAKENING            
AS THE SURFACE HIGH TO THE SOUTHEAST CONTINUES TO PUSH                          
SOUTHEAST...WITH WINDS WEAKENING THROUGH THE MORNING HOURS IN                   
RESPONSE. WELL ABOVE AVERAGE TEMPS STILL LOOK ON TRACK FOR TODAY                
EVEN GIVEN SHALLOW MIXING SHOWN BY FORECAST SOUNDINGS. THE WARMEST              
TEMPS WILL BE FOUND ACROSS WESTERN PORTIONS OF THE CWA DUE TO                   
SLIGHTLY BETTER MIXING (UP TO 900 MB VERSUS 920 MB TO THE EAST)                 
AND MORE OF A WESTERLY WIND COMPONENT WEST OF THE TROUGH AXIS. MAX              
TEMPERATURES WILL LIKELY FLIRT WITH RECORD VALUES ACROSS THE                    
WESTERN HALF OF THE CWA BUT AM EXPECTING HIGHS ACROSS THE EASTERN               
HALF TO BE A FEW DEGREES BELOW RECORDS. THE WILD CARD WITH TEMPS                
IS COVERAGE AND THICKNESS OF CIRRUS. MAIN CIRRUS SHIELD WILL                    
REMAIN WELL NORTHWEST OF THE AREA...HOWEVER MODELS ARE INDICATING               
PERIODS OF MOUNTAIN WAVE CIRRUS SPILLING ACROSS THE CWA. THIS                   
SHOULD BE PRETTY THIN AND INTERMITTENT IN NATURE SO DO NOT EXPECT               
IT TO HAVE A BIG EFFECT ON TEMPS.                                               
THE FLOW ALOFT TURNS SOUTHWEST BY WEDNESDAY AND THIS LOOKS TO BE                
THE WARMEST DAY OF THE WEEK. IT AGAIN LOOKS LIKE WE WILL ONLY MIX               
TO 900-920 MB WITH A STRONG INVERSION ABOVE THIS LAYER. RECORD                  
HIGHS IN THE MID TO UPPER 60S WILL BE IN DANGER AT                              
KGRI...KEAR...AND KHSI. IF WE WERE TO MIX ANY HIGHER THAN 900 MB                
THEY WOULD BE SURE TO FALL...BUT MODELS HAVE BEEN CONSISTENT IN                 
ADVERTISING THIS SHALLOW MIXING WITH A STRONG INVERSION ABOVE. IT LOOKS         
LIKE SOME CIRRUS MIGHT EDGE INTO THE NORTHWEST DURING THE                       
AFTERNOON BUT IT SHOULD BE LATE ENOUGH TO NOT PUT MUCH OF A DAMPER              
ON TEMPS. THE WELL ABOVE SEASONAL TEMPS CONTINUE INTO                           
THANKSGIVING DAY. HIGH CLOUDS WILL GRADUALLY INCREASE FROM THE                  
NORTHWEST AS THE ULJ PUSHES EASTWARD. SOUTHERLY WINDS PERSIST                   
THROUGH THE DAY AHEAD OF A COLD FRONT THAT WILL SLIDE THROUGH                   
THURSDAY NIGHT. TEMPS LOOK TO COOL A FEW DEGREES FROM WEDNESDAY                 
BUT WILL STILL BE AROUND 20 DEGREES ABOVE AVERAGE. TEMPERATURES                 
THEN COOL OFF FOR THE REST OF THE HOLIDAY WEEKEND BEHIND THE

THE WIND WILL BE A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD AT             
BOTH TERMINALS. NORTHERLY WINDS WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE                       
TODAY...WITH SUSTAINED WIND SPEEDS GENERALLY AROUND 20 KT WITH GUSTS            
TO 30 KT...IF NOT EVEN HIGHER AT TIMES. LOW LEVEL WIND SHEAR MAY

.MARINE...SFC LOW PRES OFF THE SC COAST HAS AN IMPRESSIVE                       
PRESENTATION ON VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGERY THIS MORNING. BASED ON                
SPARSE MARINE DATA...THE CENTER IS ABOUT 170 MI SE OF CHS. THE LOW              
IS EXPECTED TO MOVE VERY LITTLE TODAY BUT WILL CONTINUE TO                      
STRENGTHEN UNDER FAVORABLE UPPER-LEVEL CONDITIONS. THE RUC                      
INITIALIZED WIND AND PRESSURE FIELDS QUITE WELL AND ITS FCST SEEMS              
VERY REASONABLE. HAVE TWEAKED WIND DIRECTIONS AND SPEEDS WITH LATEST

WATERS BUT REDUCED SUSTAINED WIND SPEEDS OVER MOST INLAND AREAS A               
DECENT AMOUNT. WE SHOULD BE HARD-PRESSED TO SEE SUSTAINED WINDS                 
ABOVE 20 KT ACROSS INLAND AREAS DUE TO THE SHARP LLVL INVERSION.

EDGE OF FIRST BAND OF PRECIP ASSOCIATED WITH THE UPPER LOW                      
APPROACHING THE CWFA ATTM. STILL LOW LEVELS STILL QUITE DRY AS                  
SEEN ON 12Z GSO RAOB. THAT SOUNDING ALSO SHOWED TEMPERATURES BELOW              
FREEZING ON ALL BUT THE LOWEST 50 OR SO MILLIBARS. EXPECT SURFACE               
AND VERY LOW LEVEL TEMPERATURES TO CONTINUE TO WARM...ALTHOUGH                  
SLOWER IN THE EAST WITH CLOUDS. THAT SAID...SURFACE OBS TO THE                  
EAST SHOWED SNOW THEN SLEET MIXING WITH THE RAIN. EXPECT A SIMILAR              
TREND AS PRECIP DEVELOPS OVER OUR EASTERN SECTIONS...ALTHOUGH IT                
MAY HAVE WARMED ENOUGH TO BE JUST SLEET AT ONSET. THIS IS TYPICAL               
IN WINTER RAIN EVENTS WHERE A QUICK BURST OF SLEET WILL OCCUR WHEN              
PRECIP BEGINS THEN QUICKLY CHANGE TO ALL RAIN. DO NOT EXPECT ANY

SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT/...                                   
THE MAIN CONCERN WITH THIS PACKAGE WILL REVOLVE AROUND THE UPPER LOW            
CURRENTLY LOCATED OVER SOUTHEAST GEORGIA AND ASSOCIATED COASTAL                 
CYCLONE...AND THEIR EFFECTS ON THE SENSIBLE WEATHER ACROSS THE                  
WESTERN CAROLINAS. THE LEADING EDGE OF THE PRECIP SHIELD HAS PUSHED             
INTO THE NC COASTAL PLAIN...AND CONTINUES TO OOZE GRADUALLY TO THE              
WEST. THE GFS AND NAM APPEAR TO BE DOING A SIMILARLY DECENT JOB IN              
HANDLING THE WESTWARD EXTENT OF THE PRECIP ATTM. HOWEVER...THE GFS              
IS MUCH FASTER IN PUSHING PRECIP INTO THE WESTERN PIEDMONT BY LATE              
MORNING...WHILE THE NAM DOESN/T BEGIN TO PRECIPITATE OVER THE CWFA              
UNTIL LATE AFTERNOON. BASED ON RADAR TRENDS AND THE GFS SOLUTION...A            
CHANCE POP IS WARRANTED ACROSS THE EXTREME SOUTHEAST ZONES LATE THIS            
MORNING. BASED ON FORECAST SOUNDINGS...ANY PRECIP THAT FALLS THIS               
MORNING...OR EVEN EARLY THIS AFTERNOON COULD MIX WITH A LITTLE SLEET            
OR EVEN SNOW AS EVAPORATIONAL EFFECTS COOL THE DRY LOW LEVEL                    
AIRMASS. A CHANCE OF IP/-SN WILL BE MENTIONED IN THE FORECAST                   
PRODUCTS. BY LATE AFTERNOON...LIKELY TO CATEGORICAL POPS WILL BE                
FEATURED ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST ZONES...BUT STRONG WARM ADVECTION WILL            
ENSURE THAT ANY PRECIP FALLS AS RAIN LATE THIS AFTERNOON INTO THE               
EVENING.                                                                        
AFTER TODAY...EACH OPERATIONAL AND NON-OPERATIONAL MODEL HAS ITS OWN            
IDEA ON THE FUTURE MOVEMENT OF THE UPPER LOW...AND THEREFORE ITS                
EFFECTS ON SENSIBLE WEATHER IN OUR AREA. ALTHOUGH MODEL GUIDANCE                
MAKES ME REASONABLY CONFIDENT THAT RAIN WILL CONTINUE ACROSS THE                
SOUTHEAST ZONES TONIGHT (LIKELY POP WILL BE CARRIED THERE INTO THE              
2ND PERIOD)...THE EXTENT OF THE WESTWARD PENETRATION OF THE PRECIP              
SHIELD IS VERY MUCH IN QUESTION. WE WILL CARRY CHANCE POPS FOR                  
TONIGHT AS FAR WEST AS THE BLUE RIDGE.                                          
UNCERTAINTY PERSISTS INTO WED AND WED NIGHT...AS THE UPPER LOW BEGINS           
A NORTHWARD PUSH ALONG OR NEAR THE ATLANTIC COAST. THE GFS IS                   
FURTHER WEST THAN THE NAM...AND THEREFORE WRAPS A COUPLE OF MORE                
PRECIP BANDS INTO OUR EASTERN ZONES THROUGH WED NIGHT...WHILE THE               
NAM IS BASICALLY DRY AFTER WED MORNING. AT THIS POINT...FEEL THE                
BEST COURSE OF ACTION IS TO MAINTAIN CHANCE POPS MAINLY ACROSS THE              
EAST AND SOUTHEAST THROUGH WED NIGHT.                                           
LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...                                          
THE LATTER PART OF THE WEEK LOOKS FAIRLY UNEVENTFUL...AS WILL BANK              
ON THE POSSIBILITY THAT MAIN EFFECTS OF COASTAL LOW WILL BE                     
DOWNSTREAM OF THE CWFA BY FRIDAY. A TOKEN LOW OR SLIGHT CHANCE FOR              
LEFTOVER LIGHT RAIN WILL BE CARRIED THURSDAY NIGHT AS BETTER                    
MOISTURE PULLS AWAY AND MORE PRONOUNCED NW FLOW DEVELOPS THROUGH                
FRIDAY. A FAIRLY NON-DISTINCT WESTERLY FLOW THEN REMAINS OVER THE               
SOUTHEAST U.S. SATURDAY THROUGH NEXT MONDAY.

FOR AT LEAST THE FIRST PART OF THE DAY...SCATTERED TO BROKEN CLOUDS             
BETWEEN 5K AND 10K FT WILL GRADUALLY THIN AS FRONTOGENESIS WEAKENS              
AND MOISTURE WRAPS SOUTHWARD AROUND THE DEVELOPING UPPER LOW OFF THE            
SOUTHEAST COAST. BY THE MIDDLE PART OF THE MORNING...WE SHOULD BE               
LEFT WITH ONLY SCATTERED MID CLOUDS...BUT WITH A FAIRLY BRISK N WIND            
AS THE PRESSURE GRADIENT TIGHTENS AROUND THE DEEPENING LOW. EXPECT              
MID AND LOW CLOUDS SEEN OVER COASTAL NC TO EVENTUALLY WRAP AROUND TO            
THE WEST DURING THE AFTERNOON. MODELS ARE IN RELATIVELY GOOD                    
AGREEMENT WITH FIRST BRINGING A MID LEVEL CEILING IN FROM THE EAST              
BY SUNSET...FOLLOWED BY A LOW CLOUD CEILING SOME TIME IN THE                    
EVENING. AT THIS TIME...IT APPEARS THAT THE LOW CLOUDS WILL ONLY                
REACH KCLT WITH ENOUGH CERTAINTY TO MENTION IN THIS SET OF TAFS. THE            
CEILING THERE HAS BEEN KEPT ABOVE 4000 FEET FOR THE OUTLOOK...BUT               
LOW VFR OR EVEN MVFR IS NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION AFTER 00Z WEDNESDAY.            
LIGHT PRECIP WILL ALSO DEVELOP AT KCLT AS FORCING INCREASES...BUT               
VIS SHOULD NOT BE IMPACTED INITIALLY. LOOKING AHEAD...THE LOW CLOUDS            
SHOULD EVENTUALLY REACH ALL TAF SITES DURING THE EARLY MORNING HOURS

.UPDATE...BAND OF MODERATE DEFORMATION SNOWS IS MOVING SLOWLY                   
THROUGH PORTIONS OF FAR INTERIOR SOUTHEAST SOUTH CAROLINA AND                   
SOUTHEAST GEORGIA THIS EVENING. REPORTS OF UP TO 1/2 INCH HAVE BEEN             
RECEIVED IN SEVERAL AREAS WITH SNOW NOW STARTING TO COVER SOME                  
ROADWAYS. HAVE ISSUED A SNOW ADVISORY UNTIL 8 PM FOR ACCUMULATIONS              
UP TO 1 INCH. WL MONITOR TRENDS AND REPORTS FROM COUNTY WARNING

SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT/...SFC LOW CENTERED ABOUT            
200 NM ESE OF SAVANNAH COMBINED WITH A POTENT H5 LOW OVR THE SE                 
COAST MAKING FOR AN EVENTFUL 24-48 HOURS OVR THE CHS CWFA. THIS                 
SYSTEM IS ALREADY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE EARLIEST WINTER SEASON                    
SNOWFALLS RECORDED AT BOTH KCHS AND KSAV...BUT PLENTY OF MOISTURE               
ALONG WITH WARM CONVEYOR DYNAMICS WILL MAKE FOR COPIOUS RAINFALL                
TONIGHT THROUGH TOMORROW NIGHT. AM STILL DEALING WITH A BAND OF                 
SNOW/SLEET MIX THROUGH CENTRAL PORTIONS OF THE CWFA...MAINLY DUE TO             
THE STRONG VERTICAL MOTIONS IN THE BAND DRAGGING DOWN NEARLY                    
FREEZING TEMPS AT ONLY 925-950 MB. WILL KEEP A MENTION OF MIXED                 
PRECIP IN INLAND PORTIONS FOR THIS EVE...BUT WILL NOT BE XPCTG                  
FROZEN PRECIP CONCERNS BEYOND THIS EVE AS WARMER AIR BECOMES BETTER             
ENTRAINED INTO THE OVERALL SYSTEM AND KEEPS THE PRECIP AS LIQUID.               
THE LOW WILL MAINTAIN A RELATIVE POSITION JUST OFF THE COAST THROUGH            
TMRW NIGHT THEN GRADUALLY PULL AWAY TO THE NE ALONG WITH THE UPR LVL            
TROF. BEST CHANCES OF PRECIP THRU LATE TMRW WILL BE OVR NRN AND                 
CENTRAL PORTIONS OF THE CWFA SO HAVE CONTINUED THE CATEGORICAL POPS             
FOR THOSE AREAS. CLOSER TO THE ALTAMAHA RIVER...WHICH WOULD BE                  
FURTHEST FROM THE BEST DYNAMICS... WILL KEEP LIKELY POPS GOING BUT              
LESSER COVERAGE PREVENTS CATEGORICAL MENTION. POPS WILL STEADILY                
TAPER DOWN TMRW NIGHT INTO THU SUCH THAT BY THU NIGHT WILL BE ABLE              
TO RUN WITH A DRY FCST.                                                         
QPF WILL BE A BIT TRICKY WITH THERE BEING A FEW BREAKS IN THE PRECIP            
CURRENTLY BUT MODEL FCSTS PUT OUT 1-3 INCHES OF RAINFALL. HAVE TAKEN            
A MORE CONSERVATIVE APPROACH AND RAIN WITH GENERALLY 1-2 INCHES OF              
RAIN AND THEREFORE AM NOT XPCTG WIDESPREAD FLOODING. BETTER RAINFALL            
AMOUNTS WILL OCCUR FURTHER UP THE COAST SO WILL LET THE ESF PRODUCT             
EXPIRE AND HANDLE ANY FLOODING CONCERNS WITH ADDITIONAL SHORT-TERM              
STATEMENTS.                                                                     
TEMPERATURES HAVE NOT RISEN MUCH AT ALL TODAY AND HAVE IN FACT                  
DROPPED FROM THE EARLY MORNING HOURS ONCE THE PRECIP BEGAN. TEMPS               
BEFORE 12Z ACRS THE CWFA WERE IN THE LOWER 40S...THEN DROPPED TO THE            
35-38 DEGREE RANGE ONCE THE WINTRY PRECIP BEGAN LATE THIS MRNG.                 
TEMPS HAVE SINCE HELD FORT IN THE UPR 30S SO WILL LOOK FOR                      
TEMPERATURES TO SLOWLY RISE THROUGH THE 40S OVRNGT INTO TMRW CAPPING            
OUT IN THE UPR 40S TO ARND 50 TMRW AS WARMER AIR MIXES INTO THIS                
SYSTEM ON THE WARM CONVEYOR BELT. BETTER DIURNALS WILL THEN OCCUR               
TMRW NIGHT INTO THU AS THE SYSTEM PULLS AWAY...SKIES CLEAR OUT...AND            
STRONGER DAYTIME WARMING WITH IMPROVED NIGHTTIME COOLING CONDS OCCUR.           
LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...MEDIUM RANGE GUIDANCE IS IN                
GOOD AGREEMENT WITH SFC AND UPPER LEVEL FEATURES THROUGH THE                    
EXTENDED PERIOD THIS AFTERNOON. UPPER LEVEL HEIGHTS WILL BEGIN TO               
RISE ACROSS THE AREA FRI AS THE COASTAL STORM CONTINUES TO PULL OFF             
TO THE NE AND AWAY FROM THE REGION. UPPER LEVEL RIDGING WILL THEN               
BUILD OVER THE SOUTHEAST CONUS FOR THE WEEKEND AND INTO EARLY NEXT              
WEEK. AT THE SFC...HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD INTO THE REGION                     
FRI...AND WILL REMAIN THE DOMINANT WEATHER FEATURE THROUGH EARLY                
NEXT WEEK. WITH HIGH PRESSURE IN PLACE...EXPECT GENERALLY CLEAR                 
SKIES THROUGH THE WEEKEND...ALONG WITH RAIN FREE CONDITIONS. BY                 
EARLY NEXT WEEK...HIGH PRESSURE WILL SHIFT NORTH AND EAST OF THE                
AREA...ALLOWING RETURN FLOW OFF THE ATLANTIC TO GET ESTABLISHED.                
ALTHOUGH A FEW ISOLATED SHOWERS CAN/T BE RULED OUT MON THROUGH                  
TUE...CHANCES APPEAR TOO LOW TO MENTION AT THIS TIME...AND THEREFORE            
WILL KEEP THE FORECAST RAIN FREE. AS FOR TEMPERATURES...EXPECT MORE             
SEASONAL READINGS...WITH HIGHS AROUND 70 DEGREES AND LOWS IN THE MID            
40S THROUGH THE EXTENDED.                                                       
AVIATION...IFR CONDS MAINLY DUE TO CIGS TO PREVAIL WITH OCCASIONAL              
SHOWERS THRU THE NIGHT AT BOTH KCHS AND KSAV. MOD/HVY RAIN SHOWERS              
AT TIMES MAY PUSH VSBY INTO IFR CATEGORY THIS EVE...BUT AFTER DARK              
VSBYS WILL LIKELY BOUNCE BETWEEN MVFR AND IFR. CONDS LOOK TO IMPROVE            
TO MVFR TMRW MRNG THEN GRADUALLY IMPROVE TWD VFR BY LATE TMRW NIGHT             
BUT WITH THE STORM SYSTEM BEING SLOW TO EXIT...AM NOT QUITE                     
CONVINCED VFR CONDS WILL BE SEEN THRU TMRW AFTN. WINDS WILL ALSO                
REMAIN BREEZY TO WINDY...WITH SUSTAINED SPEEDS ARND 15 KT AND GUSTS             
ARND 25-30 KT.

AN APPROX 1008 MB LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM CENTERED 170 MILES SE OF CHS.             
SIGNIFICANT PRESSURE FALLS HAVE BEEN OCCURRING OVER MUCH OF NORTH               
AND SOUTH CAROLINA THIS AFTERNOON AS THE SYSTEM EXPANDS ITS DOMAIN N            
AND W. SATELLITE IMAGERY HAS SHOWN A SLOW NORTHWARD MOVEMENT OVER               
THE LAST FEW HOURS. OF ALL THE MODELS...THE RUC HAS CONTINUED TO                
INITIALIZE ESPECIALLY WELL AND SHOW A REALISTIC SHORT-TERM PROG FOR             
THE SYSTEM AND ITS WIND FIELD. HAVE UTILIZED THE RUC DIRECTIONS AND             
SPEEDS FOR THE NEXT 12 HRS. MODEL SUITE CONTINUES TO BE QUITE SPREAD            
CONCERNING THE EVENTUAL TRACK AND TIMING OF THE SYSTEM. PARENT                  
CLOSED UPPER LOW IS PROGGED TO BEGIN LIFTING N ON WED AND ALLOW THE             
SFC LOW TO MOVE OUT AS WELL. NONE OF THE GUIDANCE INDICATES WIND                
SPEEDS WOULD INCREASE AT ALL OVER ANY OF OUR WATERS...HOWEVER SOME              
DECREASE IS DEPICTED ON OCCASION.                                               
BUOY AND MOVING SHIP OBS ARE DEFINITELY SHOWING A DOWNWARD TREND                
OVER THE LAST FEW HRS. STORM FORCE WINDS ARE RARELY SHOWING                     
UP...MAINLY JUST OVER THE EXTREME OUTER GA WATERS IN SOME GUSTS.                
CARO-COOPS BUOYS ARE LOCATED IN A GOOD POSITION TO SAMPLE THE                   
NEARSHORE SC WATERS. THEY HAVE BEEN DECREASING THIS AFTERNOON WITH              
NO GUSTS ABOVE GALE FORCE IN THE LAST FOUR HRS. IT DOES LOOK AS IF              
THE GRADIENT WILL TIGHTEN OVERNIGHT...ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE                     
NEARSHORE WATERS AND THE HARBOR. THEREFORE...THE PLAN IS TO LOWER               
THE NEARSHORE SC STORM WARNINGS TO GALE WARNINGS AND EXTEND THROUGH             
06Z THU. WILL RUN THE NEARSHORE GA AND CHAS HARBOR GALE WARNING                 
THROUGH 22Z WED. WILL MAINTAIN THE OUTER GA WATERS STORM WARNING                
THROUGH 11Z WED...AFTER WHICH IT WILL LIKELY NEED TO BE TRANSITIONED            
TO A GALE WARNING FOR MUCH OF WED. CONDITIONS SHOULD RAPIDLY IMPROVE            
BY WED NIGHT OR THU MORNING AS THE LOW PULLS AWAY FROM THE AREA AND             
THE PRES GRAD DECREASES.                                                        
INLAND WINDS HAVE GENERALLY BEEN 15-25 MPH WITH SOME GUSTS AS HIGH              
AS 35 MPH ALONG THE COAST. LUCKILY...EVEN THE ELEVATED BRIDGES HAVE             
NOT SEEN SUSTAINED WINDS MUCH ABOVE ABOUT 25 MPH WHICH HAS PRECLUDED            
ANY NECESSARY CLOSINGS. NONE OF THE MODEL GUIDANCE SUGGESTS WINDS               
WILL INCREASE TONIGHT OR ON WEDNESDAY AS THE LOW PRES CENTER MOVES              
NORTH. PLAN TO CANCEL THE ENTIRE WIND ADVISORY WITH THIS PACKAGE AS             
CRITERIA ARE NO LONGER EXPECTED TO BE MET. WILL MAINTAIN BREEZY OR              
WINDY WORDING IN THE ZONES.                                                     
HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD NORTH OF THE WATERS FRI THROUGH                        
SUN...RESULTING IN A NORTHERLY FLOW ACROSS THE REGION. WINDS AND                
SEAS ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN BELOW SCA CRITERIA ACROSS THE NEARSHORE             
WATERS...BUT FAVORABLE FETCH MAY NECESSITATE SCA/S ACROSS THE OUTER             
GA WATERS THROUGH FRI EVENING.                                                  
COASTAL IMPACTS...LARGE WAVES OUT OF THE NORTHEAST CONTINUE TO ENTER            
THE SURF ZONE THIS AFTERNOON. UNFORTUNATELY...GAGING THE WAVES AT               
THE COAST IS DIFFICULT DUE TO AN ABSENCE OF WAVE HEIGHT BUOYS IN                
THOSE AREAS. SPECTRAL DATA FROM BUOY 41004 AND 41008 INDICATE SOME 5            
FT BREAKERS WILL BE LIKELY AT LEAST THROUGH THE EVENING HRS BEFORE              
THE TRAJECTORIES BECOME MORE NORTHERLY. WILL EXTEND THE HIGH SURF               
ADVISORY THROUGH 11Z WEDNESDAY. MID SHIFT MAY NEED TO CANCEL IT                 
EARLY.

WINDS ACROSS THE INLAND AREAS THROUGH TONIGHT...BEFORE A GRADUAL                
DECREASE BEGINS ON WED. ALTHOUGH THE WIND SENSOR IS NOT FULLY                   
SAMPLING THE OPEN LAKE WINDS...DO NOT THINK THE WINDS ARE ENOUGH                
HIGHER IN THOSE AREAS TO JUSTIFY A HIGH WIND WARNING /SUSTAINED 35

.AVIATION UPDATE...RAIN/SNOW MIXTURE IS STILL BEING REPORTED AT THE             
SAVANNAH AIRPORT PER 5-MIN OBSERVATIONS. REPORTS OF SNOW ARE BEING              
RECEIVED UPSTREAM ACROSS JASPER COUNTY. AMENDED THE KSAV TAF TO                 
INCLUDE A TEMP GROUP FOR 4SM RASN FOR THE NXT FEW HOURS.

200 NM ESE OF SAVANNAH COMBINED WITH A POTENT H5 LOW OVR THE SE                 
COAST MAKING FOR AN EVENTFUL 24-48 HOURS OVR THE CHS CWFA. THIS

SNOWFALLS RECORDED AT BOTH KCHS AND KSAV...BUT PLENTY OF MOISTURE               
ALONG WITH WARM CONVEYOR DYNAMICS WILL MAKE FOR COPIOUS RAINFALL                
TONIGHT THROUGH TOMORROW NIGHT. AM STILL DEALING WITH A BAND OF                 
SNOW/SLEET MIX THROUGH CENTRAL PORTIONS OF THE CWFA...MAINLY DUE TO             
THE STRONG VERTICAL MOTIONS IN THE BAND DRAGGING DOWN NEARLY                    
FREEZING TEMPS AT ONLY 925-950 MB. WILL KEEP A MENTION OF MIXED                 
PRECIP IN INLAND PORTIONS FOR THIS EVE...BUT WILL NOT BE XPCTG                  
FROZEN PRECIP CONCERNS BEYOND THIS EVE AS WARMER AIR BECOMES BETTER             
ENTRAINED INTO THE OVERALL SYSTEM AND KEEPS THE PRECIP AS LIQUID.               
THE LOW WILL MAINTAIN A RELATIVE POSITION JUST OFF THE COAST THROUGH

FURTHEST FROM THE BEST DYNAMICS... WILL KEEP LIKELY POPS GOING BUT

QPF WILL BE A BIT TRICKY WITH THERE BEING A FEW BREAKS IN THE PRECIP            
CURRENTLY BUT MODEL FCSTS PUT OUT 1-3 INCHES OF RAINFALL. HAVE TAKEN            
A MORE CONSERVATIVE APPROACH AND RAIN WITH GENERALLY 1-2 INCHES OF              
RAIN AND THEREFORE AM NOT XPCTG WIDESPREAD FLOODING. BETTER RAINFALL            
AMOUNTS WILL OCCUR FURTHER UP THE COAST SO WILL LET THE ESF PRODUCT             
EXPIRE AND HANDLE ANY FLOODING CONCERNS WITH ADDITIONAL SHORT-TERM

BUT WITH THE STORM SYSTEM BEING SLOW TO EXIT...AM NOT QUITE                     
CONVINCED VFR CONDS WILL BE SEEN THRU TMRW AFTN. WINDS WILL ALSO

AN APPROX 1008 MB LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM CENTERED 170 MILES SE OF CHS.             
SIGNIFICANT PRESSURE FALLS HAVE BEEN OCCURRING OVER MUCH OF NORTH               
AND SOUTH CAROLINA THIS AFTERNOON AS THE SYSTEM EXPANDS ITS DOMAIN N            
AND W. SATELLITE IMAGERY HAS SHOWN A SLOW NORTHWARD MOVEMENT OVER               
THE LAST FEW HOURS. OF ALL THE MODELS...THE RUC HAS CONTINUED TO                
INITIALIZE ESPECIALLY WELL AND SHOW A REALISTIC SHORT-TERM PROG FOR             
THE SYSTEM AND ITS WIND FIELD. HAVE UTILIZED THE RUC DIRECTIONS AND             
SPEEDS FOR THE NEXT 12 HRS. MODEL SUITE CONTINUES TO BE QUITE SPREAD            
CONCERNING THE EVENTUAL TRACK AND TIMING OF THE SYSTEM. PARENT                  
CLOSED UPPER LOW IS PROGGED TO BEGIN LIFTING N ON WED AND ALLOW THE             
SFC LOW TO MOVE OUT AS WELL. NONE OF THE GUIDANCE INDICATES WIND                
SPEEDS WOULD INCREASE AT ALL OVER ANY OF OUR WATERS...HOWEVER SOME              
DECREASE IS DEPICTED ON OCCASION.                                               
BUOY AND MOVING SHIP OBS ARE DEFINITELY SHOWING A DOWNWARD TREND                
OVER THE LAST FEW HRS. STORM FORCE WINDS ARE RARELY SHOWING                     
UP...MAINLY JUST OVER THE EXTREME OUTER GA WATERS IN SOME GUSTS.                
CARO-COOPS BUOYS ARE LOCATED IN A GOOD POSITION TO SAMPLE THE                   
NEARSHORE SC WATERS. THEY HAVE BEEN DECREASING THIS AFTERNOON WITH              
NO GUSTS ABOVE GALE FORCE IN THE LAST FOUR HRS. IT DOES LOOK AS IF              
THE GRADIENT WILL TIGHTEN OVERNIGHT...ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE                     
NEARSHORE WATERS AND THE HARBOR. THEREFORE...THE PLAN IS TO LOWER               
THE NEARSHORE SC STORM WARNINGS TO GALE WARNINGS AND EXTEND THROUGH             
06Z THU. WILL RUN THE NEARSHORE GA AND CHAS HARBOR GALE WARNING                 
THROUGH 22Z WED. WILL MAINTAIN THE OUTER GA WATERS STORM WARNING                
THROUGH 11Z WED...AFTER WHICH IT WILL LIKELY NEED TO BE TRANSITIONED            
TO A GALE WARNING FOR MUCH OF WED. CONDITIONS SHOULD RAPIDLY IMPROVE            
BY WED NIGHT OR THU MORNING AS THE LOW PULLS AWAY FROM THE AREA AND             
THE PRES GRAD DECREASES.                                                        
INLAND WINDS HAVE GENERALLY BEEN 15-25 MPH WITH SOME GUSTS AS HIGH              
AS 35 MPH ALONG THE COAST. LUCKILY...EVEN THE ELEVATED BRIDGES HAVE             
NOT SEEN SUSTAINED WINDS MUCH ABOVE ABOUT 25 MPH WHICH HAS PRECLUDED            
ANY NECESSARY CLOSINGS. NONE OF THE MODEL GUIDANCE SUGGESTS WINDS               
WILL INCREASE TONIGHT OR ON WEDNESDAY AS THE LOW PRES CENTER MOVES              
NORTH. PLAN TO CANCEL THE ENTIRE WIND ADVISORY WITH THIS PACKAGE AS             
CRITERIA ARE NO LONGER EXPECTED TO BE MET. WILL MAINTAIN BREEZY OR              
WINDY WORDING IN THE ZONES.                                                     
HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD NORTH OF THE WATERS FRI THROUGH                        
SUN...RESULTING IN A NORTHERLY FLOW ACROSS THE REGION. WINDS AND                
SEAS ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN BELOW SCA CRITERIA ACROSS THE NEARSHORE             
WATERS...BUT FAVORABLE FETCH MAY NECESSITATE SCA/S ACROSS THE OUTER             
GA WATERS THROUGH FRI EVENING.                                                  
COASTAL IMPACTS...LARGE WAVES OUT OF THE NORTHEAST CONTINUE TO ENTER            
THE SURF ZONE THIS AFTERNOON. UNFORTUNATELY...GAGING THE WAVES AT               
THE COAST IS DIFFICULT DUE TO AN ABSENCE OF WAVE HEIGHT BUOYS IN                
THOSE AREAS. SPECTRAL DATA FROM BUOY 41004 AND 41008 INDICATE SOME 5            
FT BREAKERS WILL BE LIKELY AT LEAST THROUGH THE EVENING HRS BEFORE              
THE TRAJECTORIES BECOME MORE NORTHERLY. WILL EXTEND THE HIGH SURF               
ADVISORY THROUGH 11Z WEDNESDAY. MID SHIFT MAY NEED TO CANCEL IT                 
EARLY.                                                                          
LAKE WINDS...WINDS ON THE LAKE HAVE CONTINUED OUT OF THE NORTH AT 20

WINDS ACROSS THE INLAND AREAS THROUGH TONIGHT...BEFORE A GRADUAL                
DECREASE BEGINS ON WED. ALTHOUGH THE WIND SENSOR IS NOT FULLY                   
SAMPLING THE OPEN LAKE WINDS...DO NOT THINK THE WINDS ARE ENOUGH                
HIGHER IN THOSE AREAS TO JUSTIFY A HIGH WIND WARNING /SUSTAINED 35

40S THROUGH THE EXTENDED.

.AVIATION...IFR CONDS MAINLY DUE TO CIGS TO PREVAIL WITH OCCASIONAL             
SHOWERS THRU THE NIGHT AT BOTH KCHS AND KSAV. MOD/HVY RAIN SHOWERS              
AT TIMES MAY PUSH VSBY INTO IFR CATEGORY THIS EVE...BUT AFTER DARK              
VSBYS WILL LIKELY BOUNCE BETWEEN MVFR AND IFR. CONDS LOOK TO IMPROVE            
TO MVFR TMRW MRNG THEN GRADUALLY IMPROVE TWD VFR BY LATE TMRW NIGHT             
BUT WITH THE STORM SYSTEM BEING SLOW TO EXIT...AM NOT QUITE                     
CONVINCED VFR CONDS WILL BE SEEN THRU TMRW AFTN. WINDS WILL ALSO                
REMAIN BREEZY TO WINDY...WITH SUSTAINED SPEEDS ARND 15 KT AND GUSTS             
ARND 25-30 KT.

.MARINE...VERY ROUGH CONDITIONS CONTINUE OVER THE WATERS TODAY WITH             
AN APPROX 1008 MB LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM CENTERED 170 MILES SE OF CHS.             
SIGNIFICANT PRESSURE FALLS HAVE BEEN OCCURRING OVER MUCH OF NORTH               
AND SOUTH CAROLINA THIS AFTERNOON AS THE SYSTEM EXPANDS ITS DOMAIN N            
AND W. SATELLITE IMAGERY HAS SHOWN A SLOW NORTHWARD MOVEMENT OVER               
THE LAST FEW HOURS. OF ALL THE MODELS...THE RUC HAS CONTINUED TO                
INITIALIZE ESPECIALLY WELL AND SHOW A REALISTIC SHORT-TERM PROG FOR             
THE SYSTEM AND ITS WIND FIELD. HAVE UTILIZED THE RUC DIRECTIONS AND             
SPEEDS FOR THE NEXT 12 HRS. MODEL SUITE CONTINUES TO BE QUITE SPREAD            
CONCERNING THE EVENTUAL TRACK AND TIMING OF THE SYSTEM. PARENT                  
CLOSED UPPER LOW IS PROGGED TO BEGIN LIFTING N ON WED AND ALLOW THE             
SFC LOW TO MOVE OUT AS WELL. NONE OF THE GUIDANCE INDICATES WIND                
SPEEDS WOULD INCREASE AT ALL OVER ANY OF OUR WATERS...HOWEVER SOME              
DECREASE IS DEPICTED ON OCCASION.                                               
BUOY AND MOVING SHIP OBS ARE DEFINITELY SHOWING A DOWNWARD TREND                
OVER THE LAST FEW HRS. STORM FORCE WINDS ARE RARELY SHOWING                     
UP...MAINLY JUST OVER THE EXTREME OUTER GA WATERS IN SOME GUSTS.                
CARO-COOPS BUOYS ARE LOCATED IN A GOOD POSITION TO SAMPLE THE                   
NEARSHORE SC WATERS. THEY HAVE BEEN DECREASING THIS AFTERNOON WITH              
NO GUSTS ABOVE GALE FORCE IN THE LAST FOUR HRS. IT DOES LOOK AS IF              
THE GRADIENT WILL TIGHTEN OVERNIGHT...ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE                     
NEARSHORE WATERS AND THE HARBOR. THEREFORE...THE PLAN IS TO LOWER               
THE NEARSHORE SC STORM WARNINGS TO GALE WARNINGS AND EXTEND THROUGH             
06Z THU. WILL RUN THE NEARSHORE GA AND CHAS HARBOR GALE WARNING                 
THROUGH 22Z WED. WILL MAINTAIN THE OUTER GA WATERS STORM WARNING                
THROUGH 11Z WED...AFTER WHICH IT WILL LIKELY NEED TO BE TRANSITIONED            
TO A GALE WARNING FOR MUCH OF WED. CONDITIONS SHOULD RAPIDLY IMPROVE            
BY WED NIGHT OR THU MORNING AS THE LOW PULLS AWAY FROM THE AREA AND             
THE PRES GRAD DECREASES.                                                        
INLAND WINDS HAVE GENERALLY BEEN 15-25 MPH WITH SOME GUSTS AS HIGH              
AS 35 MPH ALONG THE COAST. LUCKILY...EVEN THE ELEVATED BRIDGES HAVE             
NOT SEEN SUSTAINED WINDS MUCH ABOVE ABOUT 25 MPH WHICH HAS PRECLUDED            
ANY NECESSARY CLOSINGS. NONE OF THE MODEL GUIDANCE SUGGESTS WINDS               
WILL INCREASE TONIGHT OR ON WEDNESDAY AS THE LOW PRES CENTER MOVES              
NORTH. PLAN TO CANCEL THE ENTIRE WIND ADVISORY WITH THIS PACKAGE AS             
CRITERIA ARE NO LONGER EXPECTED TO BE MET. WILL MAINTAIN BREEZY OR              
WINDY WORDING IN THE ZONES.                                                     
HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD NORTH OF THE WATERS FRI THROUGH                        
SUN...RESULTING IN A NORTHERLY FLOW ACROSS THE REGION. WINDS AND                
SEAS ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN BELOW SCA CRITERIA ACROSS THE NEARSHORE             
WATERS...BUT FAVORABLE FETCH MAY NECESSITATE SCA/S ACROSS THE OUTER             
GA WATERS THROUGH FRI EVENING.                                                  
&&                                                                              
.COASTAL IMPACTS...LARGE WAVES OUT OF THE NORTHEAST CONTINUE TO                 
ENTER THE SURF ZONE THIS AFTERNOON. UNFORTUNATELY...GAGING THE WAVES            
AT THE COAST IS DIFFICULT DUE TO AN ABSENCE OF WAVE HEIGHT BUOYS IN             
THOSE AREAS. SPECTRAL DATA FROM BUOY 41004 AND 41008 INDICATE SOME 5            
FT BREAKERS WILL BE LIKELY AT LEAST THROUGH THE EVENING HRS BEFORE              
THE TRAJECTORIES BECOME MORE NORTHERLY. WILL EXTEND THE HIGH SURF               
ADVISORY THROUGH 11Z WEDNESDAY. MID SHIFT MAY NEED TO CANCEL IT                 
EARLY.

.LAKE WINDS...WINDS ON THE LAKE HAVE CONTINUED OUT OF THE NORTH AT              
20 TO 30 MPH WITH SOME GUSTS TO 35 MPH. DO NOT EXPECT MUCH CHANGE IN            
WINDS ACROSS THE INLAND AREAS THROUGH TONIGHT...BEFORE A GRADUAL                
DECREASE BEGINS ON WED. ALTHOUGH THE WIND SENSOR IS NOT FULLY                   
SAMPLING THE OPEN LAKE WINDS...DO NOT THINK THE WINDS ARE ENOUGH                
HIGHER IN THOSE AREAS TO JUSTIFY A HIGH WIND WARNING /SUSTAINED 35              
KT OR GUSTS TO 50 KT/. THEREFORE...PLAN TO DOWNGRADE THE HIGH WIND              
WARNING TO A LAKE WIND ADVISORY AND EXTEND THROUGH 00Z THURSDAY.
