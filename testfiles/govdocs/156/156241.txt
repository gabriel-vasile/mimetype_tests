QUICK UPDATE TO LOWER POPS FOR TODAY. LINE OF SHRA/TSRA HIT THE                 
STATE LINE AND POW...VAPOR. NOT THAT THE MODELS WERE OFF ON                     
THIS...BUT WAS EXPECTING AT LEAST A HUNDREDTH TO GET SQUEEZED OUT               
OVER MOST OF NW 1/3RD OF CWA. NOT SO SURE NOW UNLESS NEW ACTIVITY               
CAN DEVELOP THIS AFTERNOON. BEST CHC FOR MEASURABLE PRECIP WILL BE              
ACROSS NORTHERN ZONES.

EDGE OF FRONT HAS BEEN VIGOROUS ALL MORNING LONG BUT IS FINALLY                 
SHOWING SIGNS OF WEAKENING AS CG FREQUENCY WITHIN THE COMPLEX HAS               
DROPPED TO BELOW 100 STRIKES/15 MIN. NORTHERN AL LMA DATA NOT

WANES THIS MORNING. BY AFTERNOON...NO SFC-BASED CAPE INDICATED BY               
NMM/WRF OR GFS ACROSS CWA. COULD SEE SOME SCATTERED SHOWERS WITH                
AN ISOLATED STORMS AROUND TODAY BUT SVR STORMS APPEAR UNLIKELY GIVEN            
LIMITED INSTABILITY AND TIMING OF SYSTEM. FRONT SHOULD PROGRESS                 
QUICKLY WITH STRONG WINDS DEVELOPING BEHIND FRONT. W TO NW WINDS                
OF 15-19 MPH WITH GUSTS OF 25-30 MPH EXPECTED THROUGH ABOUT 06Z                 
TONIGHT. SHOULD REMAIN BELOW ADVISORY CRITERIA.

AFTERNOON AND REST OF CWA TONIGHT. TEMPS STILL NOT TOO COLD DURING              
THE DAY WITH NEAR NORMAL READINGS EXPECTED. USED BIAS-ADJUSTED MAV

NOW PROGGING A MONSTER TROUGH ALONG THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY FOR                  
WED. THE ONE FORECAST BY THE THURSDAY 18Z DGEX THAT THIS                        
FORECASTER WAS DISSING THIS TIME YESTERDAY. YEA. WELL...WE WILL                 
SEE HOW IT PANS OUT. WITH THIS AGREEMENT HAVE BUMPED POPS UP TO                 
HIGH CHC CATEGORY FOR WED AND WED NIGHT...NOT QUITE THE LIKELIES

PICK UP THROUGH THE MORNING HOURS AS THE COLD FRONT APPROACHES. THIS            
WITH RADIATIONAL COOLING HAS ALLOWED FOG TO DEVELOP AT                          
CLIMATOLOGICALLY PREFERRED SITES. SOME HIGH CLOUDS HAVE ALREADY

FORMATION WILL BE SHUT DOWN SINCE COOLING POTENTIAL WILL BE SLOWED.             
CONVECTION THAT WAS ONGOING THROUGH THE VERY EARLY MORNING HOURS HAS            
FIZZLED OUT OVER MS/AL...BUT NAM/RUC BOTH SEEM TO THINK THAT PRECIP

MENTION OF SHOWERS FOR THE AFTERNOON PERIOD. WRAPAROUND COLD-AIR

NORTHWEST AREAS LATE THIS AFTERNOON AND SPREAD ACROSS THE                       
REMAINDER OF THE REGION TONIGHT. COLDER AIR FILTERING INTO EXTREME              
NORTHERN MAINE WILL CHANGE THE RAIN TO SNOW LATER TONIGHT.

.SHORT TERM /REST OF TODAY/...                                                  
BASED ON THE LATEST RUC MODEL FORECAST DECIDED TO DECREASE THE                  
CHANCE OF PRECIPITATION FROM ALL ZONES TODAY. RUC ALONG WITH 12Z NAM            
WRF INDICATE THAT RAIN WILL OVERSPREAD NORTHWEST MAINE ESPECIALLY               
NORTHERN ZONES 1 AND 3 BY LATE AFTERNOON BUT SHOULD HOLD OFF UNTIL              
AFTER SUNSET ELSEWHERE. SAT AND RADAR TRENDS ALSO SUPPORT THIS AS WELL.

SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...                                            
WEAK SURFACE RIDGE THAT BROUGHT DRY CONDITIONS TO THE CWA                       
DURING THE LAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS WILL MOVE OFF TO THE EAST                     
EARLY THIS MORNING. LATEST IR SATELLITE LOOP INDICATING CLOUDS                  
ALREADY SPREADING OVER THE NORTHERN AND NORTH CENTRAL ZONES WITH                
WARM ADVECTION PATTERN SETTING UP ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE RIDGE                 
AND WITHIN THE DEVELOPING FRONTOGENETIC ZONE OFF TO THE SOUTHWEST.              
THE FORECAST IN THE SHORT TERM HINGES ON STRENGTH OF THE LOW LEVEL              
FRONTOGENESIS AND ACCOMPANYING LARGE SCALE LIFT RESULTING IN THE                
OVERRUNNING PATTERN THAT SETS UP ACROSS THE NORTHERN PORTION OF                 
THE CWA THIS AFTERNOON INTO TONIGHT.                                            
BOTH THE NAM WRF AND GFS INCREASE THE LOW LEVEL Q-VECTOR FORCING                
AND CONVERGENCE STRENGTHENING THE BAROCLINIC ZONE THROUGH NORTH                 
CENTRAL MAINE TODAY. INCREASING LOW LEVEL SOUTHERLY FLOW AND MOISTURE           
CONVERGENCE ALONG/NORTH OF THE FRONT WILL ESTABLISH A BAND                      
PRECIPITATION ACROSS THE FAR NORTH. HAVE INCREASED TO POPS TO                   
LIKELY FOR ZONE 1 WITH HIGH CHANCE CONTINUING FOR ZONES 2>4 THIS                
AFTERNOON.                                                                      
MODEL SOUNDINGS SUGGEST PRECIPITATION TO BEGIN AS RAIN...HOWEVER AS             
SURFACE HIGH OVER CENTRAL QUEBEC PROVINCE BUILDS AND ENHANCES A                 
NORTHEAST LOW LEVEL FLOW NORTH OF THE WARM FRONT...THE COLUMN COOLS             
CONSIDERABLY ESPECIALLY AFTER MIDNIGHT TO AOB FREEZING ACROSS                   
NORTHWEST MAINE AND THROUGHOUT THE SAINT JOHN VALLEY. IN-HOUSE                  
SNOW TOOL SUGGESTS UP TO AN INCH ACROSS THE ALLAGASH WILDERNESS                 
AND SAINT JOHN VALLEY WITH UP TO 3 INCHES ACROSS THE BIG TWENTY                 
TOWNSHIP /ESTCOURT STATION/ BY EARLY SUNDAY MORNING. SOME MIXED                 
PRECIPITATION ALSO POSSIBLE ACROSS EXTREME NORTHERN ZONE 2 FROM                 
VAN BUREN TO HAMLIN WITH LITTLE IF ANY ACCUMULATION EXPECTED.                   
ELSEWHERE EXPECT RAIN TO DEVELOP ACROSS DOWNEAST EARLY TONIGHT.                 
LOW LEVEL SUPPORT GRADUALLY WEAKENS AS FRONTAL BOUNDARY SLOWLY                  
MOVES TOWAD THE COAST LATE TONIGHT AND SUNDAY MORNING. HAVE                     
REFLECTED THIS THINKING WITH LOWERING POPS ACROSS THE NORTH AND A               
GRADUAL INCREASE IN POPS DOWNEAST FOR SUNDAY.                                   
WENT BELOW THE MOS GUIDANCE FOR MAX TEMPERATURES ON SUNDAY WHICH

LONG TERM /SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/...                                     
STILL SOME MAJOR DISAGREEMENTS ON THE MOVEMENT OF MID ATLC LOW                  
EARLY NEXT WEEK. GFS THE MORE PROGRESSIVE MODEL...EJECTING LOW ACROSS           
THE STATE ON TUESDAY NIGHT WITH THE ECMWF WAITING UNTIL WEDNESDAY.              
STRONG HIGH PRESSURE NORTH OF THE STATE COMBINED WITH LOW PRESSURE              
SOUTH OF THE AREA WILL KEEP MOIST EASTERLY FLOW ACROSS THE STATE.               
WITH EITHER MODEL SOLUTION EXPECT PLENTY OF CLOUDS AND OCCASIONAL               
SHOWERS SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY.

SHORT TERM: SWELL AROUND 6 FT STILL OCCURRING OVER THE WATERS                   
EARLY THIS MORNING. WILL CONTINUE WITH SCA HEADLINE AS EXPECT                   
WINDS TO INCREASE TO SCA CRITERIA /IN GUSTS/ WITH SOUTHERLY FLOW                
INCREASING THIS AFTERNOON INTO EARLY TONIGHT.                                   
LONG TERM: COMBINATION OF HIGH PRESSURE TO THE NORTH AND LOW                    
PRESSURE TO THE SOUTH WILL PRODUCE EASTERLY FLOW OVER THE WATERS                
EARLY NEXT WEEK. AS GRADIENT CONTINUES TO TIGHTEN BETWEEN THESE                 
TWO SURFACE FEATURES...EXPECT SEAS AND WINDS TO INCREASE TO SCA CRITERIA

MAIN FCST ISSUES OVERNIGHT ARE CLOUDS/TEMPS.                                    
EVENING SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS STRATOCU DECK HANGING TOUGH ACROSS              
UPPER MI. THERE HAVE BEEN A FEW TRANSIENT SMALL BREAKS IN THE CLOUD             
COVER OVER A PORTION OF CNTRL UPPER MI...BUT BREAKS HAVE FILLED IN              
FOR THE MOST PART RECENTLY. MOISTURE IS TRAPPED BLO SHARP INVERSION             
BASED AT ABOUT 3.5KFT AGL PER TAMDAR SOUNDING FROM FLIGHT OUT OF                
KSAW JUST BEFORE 01Z. ALTHOUGH SFC RIDGE IS PASSING ACROSS UPPER MI             
ATTM...NOT TOO CONFIDENT ABOUT SIGNIFICANT CLEARING OVERNIGHT...                
ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THAT WINDS INTIALLY AFTER RIDGE PASSAGE WILL             
BE A SE UPSLOPING FLOW OFF LAKE MICHIGAN FOR A GOOD PORTION OF THE              
FCST AREA. HOWEVER...SE TO S FLOW OVER FAR WRN UPPER MI TOWARD LAKE             
SUPERIOR IS DOWNSLOPING AND THAT SHOULD PROMOTE SOME BREAK UP OF                
STRATOCU THERE. OTHERWISE...AS FLOW BECOMES STRONGER AND SRLY VERY              
LATE TONIGHT/EARLY SUN MORNING...STRATOCU SHOULD BEGIN TO BREAK UP              
ALL AREAS. THIS IS ALREADY UNDERWAY ACROSS SW WI. WITH MORE CLOUD               
COVER EXPECTED THRU THE NIGHT...HAVE BUMPED MIN TEMPS UP INTO THE               
20S EVERYWHERE. IF ANY PERSISTENT HOLES IN THE CLOUD COVER SHOULD               
DEVELOP OVER THE CNTRL/E WHERE SNOWCOVER IS PRESENT...TEMPS WILL                
DROP INTO THE TEENS.

WV LOOP AND RUC ANALYSIS INDICATED A PROGRESSIVE PATTERN WITH A                 
POSITIVE TILT MID/UPPER LEVEL TROF FROM ERN ONTARIO AND LWR MI TO               
THE LWR MS VALLEY...AN UPSTREAM RIDGE FROM THE SRN PLAINS TO THE                
UPPER MS VALLEY AND ANOTHER TROUGH OVER THE WRN CONUS. AT THE

FROM NRN ONTARIO AND WRN LAKE SUPERIOR THROUGH IA TO TX. SRLY FLOW              
WAS INCREASING OVER THE PLAINS AND UPPER MS VALLEY AHEAD OF A TROUGH            
FROM SRN SASK INTO ERN WY. VIS IMAGERY SHOWED LOW CLOUDS LINGERING              
OVER FROM WRN LK SUPERIOR INTO NW WI..BENEATH STRONG 850 MB                     
INVERSION...PER 19Z KCMX TAMDAR SOUNDING. MORE CELLULAR LAKE EFFECT             
CLOUDS PERSISTED WITH NNE FLOW FROM E LK SUPERIOR INTO CNTRL AND E              
UPPER MI. 850 MB TEMPS NEAR -10C PROVIDED ENOUGH INSTABILITY FOR                
CONTINUED LIGHT LES THIS AFTERNOON. HOWEVER...RADAR SHOWED MAINLY               
JUST SCT -SHSN OR FLURRIES.                                                     
SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND SUNDAY)...                                              
MAIN FCST CONCERNS ARE CLOUD TRENDS AND IMPACTS ON TEMPS.                       
ANY LINGERING LES OVER CNTRL UPR MI SHOULD DIMINISH AND END EARLY               
THIS EVENING AS THE WINDS BECOME VARIABLE AND EVENTUALLY OFFSHORE.              
ALTHOUGH THE CLOUD DECK HAS BEEN SLOWLY ERODING OVER NW WI...THE                
STRENGTH OF THE INVERSION AND LACK OF SIGNIFICANT DRY ADVECTION HAS             
HINDERED ANY CLEARING. THE 18Z RUC SUGGESTS THAT AS THE RDG AXIS                
SLIDES TO THE EAST RETURN SRLY FLOW WILL PUSH THE CLOUDS NORTH OF               
UPPER MI WHILE THE NAM...AS IS OFTEN THE CASE WITH LOW LVL                      
MOISTURE...IS MORE PESSIMISTIC. GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF CLOUDS THROUGH              
CNTRL WI...A SLOWER DEPARTURE OF LOWER CLOUDS LOOKS MORE LIKELY. IN             
ADDITION...HIGHER CLOUDS AHEAD OF THE WRN CONUS TROUGH WERE ALREADY             
STREAMING TOWARD THE WRN LAKES. COMBINATION OF GREATER CLOUD COVER              
AND INCREASING S WINDS LATE TONIGHT OVER THE WEST HALF SHOULD KEEP              
TEMPS FROM DROPPING OFF AS FAR...EVEN WITH THE ABUNDANT SNOW COVER              
IN PORTIONS OF CNTRL AND E UPR MI.                                              
THERE MAY BE SOME LINGERING LOW CLOUDS INTO CNTRL UPR MI LATE                   
TONIGHT INTO SUN WITH LONG SRLY FETCH DEVELOPING ACROSS LAKE MI AND             
925 MB TEMPS FCST NEAR -4C. OTHERWISE...SOME SUNSHINE THROUGH                   
INCREASING HIGH CLOUDS SHOULD PREVAIL SUNDAY. SNOW COVER SHOULD                 
AGAIN KEEP TEMPS AOB GUIDANCE FOR INLAND PORTIONS OF CNTRL UPR MI.              
LONG TERM (SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH NEXT SATURDAY)...                               
MAIN FORECAST CONCERN IS MODERATE TO HEAVY PERIOD OF SNOW SUNDAY                
NIGHT INTO MONDAY.                                                              
SUNDAY NIGHT...SHRTWV TROUGH EXTENDING FROM WASHINGTON INTO                     
CALIFORNIA IS PROGGED TO BE LOCATED OVER THE PLAINS AT 00Z. SINCE               
FAIRLY STRONG UPPER LEVEL RIDGING IS EXPECTED AHEAD OF THE TROUGH               
OVER THE EAST COAST...THIS TROUGH WILL HAVE TO LIFT NORTHEAST                   
TOWARDS THE CWA. BY 12Z...THE TROUGH SHOULD BE LOCATED IN WESTERN               
WISCONSIN. THE TRACK OF THE TROUGH ALSO ALLOWS FOR A 100KT JET                  
STREAK...WHICH SHOULD BE JUST SOUTH OF OMAHA AT 00Z MON...TO TRACK              
UP TO SAULT SAINTE MARIE BY 12Z...PLACING MUCH OF THE CWA IN THE                
LEFT EXIT REGION (FAVORED FOR UPPER LEVEL DIVERGENCE). IN ADDITION              
TO THE FAVORABLE UPPER JET TRACK...NAM/GFS SHOW DECENT MID-LEVEL                
FRONTOGENESIS MOVING THROUGH...ADDING EXTRA VERTICAL MOTION. OTHER              
THAN FOR SOME INITIAL DRY AIR...PARTICULARLY OVER THE EASTERN                   
CWA...CONDITIONS LOOK FAVORABLE FOR BRINGING PRECIPITATION ACROSS               
MUCH OF THE CWA BY 12Z. SINCE MODELS HAVE BEEN SHOWING THIS FEATURE             
FOR A WHILE...HAVE RAISED POPS TO CATEGORICAL. MOST TEMPERATURE                 
PROFILES ON SOUNDINGS WHEN THE PRECIPITATION IS MOVING THROUGH IS               
ALL BELOW FREEZING...EXCEPT IMMEDIATELY ALONG LAKE MICHIGAN...                  
THEREFORE MAINLY SNOW IS EXPECTED. AS FOR AMOUNTS...GIVEN THE STRONG            
VERTICAL MOTION...AT LEAST A 0.25 INCH OF LIQUID SHOULD BE POSSIBLE.            
BECAUSE OF THE SYNOPTIC NATURE OF THE SYSTEM...A 10 TO 1 SNOWFALL               
RATIO WOULD BE APPROPRIATE...HOWEVER WITH THE SATURATED  SNOW GROWTH            
LAYER A FEW THOUSAND FEET DEEP AND PLENTY OF VERTICAL MOTION IN THAT            
LAYER...WILL USE A 15 TO 1 RATIO TO ACCOUNT FOR MORE SNOWFALL.                  
ADVISORIES MAY BE NEEDED FOR THIS EVENT IF SLIGHTLY MORE QPF OCCURS             
THAN EXPECTED.                                                                  
MONDAY...SHRTWV TROUGH WILL CONTINUE MOVING NORTHEASTWARD...CROSSING            
MOST OF THE CWA BY 00Z. IN FACT...SOME WEAK UPPER LEVEL RIDGING IS              
PROGGED TO BUILD INTO FAR WESTERN LAKE SUPERIOR BY 00Z AHEAD OF                 
TROUGHING DEVELOPING OVER THE NW U.S.. EXPECT THE BAND OF                       
FRONTOGENETIC SNOWFALL TO PROGRESS EASTWARD ACROSS THE CWA WITH THE             
SHRTWV TROUGH...AND SKIES GRADUALLY CLEARING OUT BEHIND IT. WITH                
850MB TEMPS RISING TO AROUND -2C BY THE END OF THE                              
DAY...TEMPERATURES SHOULD STILL BE ABLE TO HIT THE UPPER 30S/LOW                
40S.                                                                            
MONDAY NIGHT...UPPER LEVEL RIDGING IS PROGGED TO ENCOMPASS THE CWA              
THROUGH THE NIGHT WHILE THE TROUGHING OVER THE NW MOVES TOWARDS THE

GFS/ECMWF INDICATE THAT A WEAK SHRTWV MAY MOVE ACROSS THE CWA DURING            
THE DAY. HOWEVER...RH PROFILES ARE VERY DRY...SO LIKELY THE MAIN                
IMPACT FROM THIS SHRTWV WILL BE FOR INCREASING MID/HIGH CLOUDS.                 
ANOTHER SHRTWV IS PROGGED TO APPROACH THE WESTERN U.P. LATE IN THE              
DAY. THIS SHRTWV WILL BE ASSOCIATED WITH MORE ISENTROPIC LIFT AND               
MOISTURE...SO HAVE MAINTAINED A CHANCE OF RAIN/SNOW THERE. AS FAR AS

POSITIVE TILT MID/UPPER LEVEL TROF FROM ERN ONTARIO AND LWR MI TO

WAS INCREASING OVER THE PLAINS AND UPPER MS VALLEY AHEAD OF A TROUGH

CLOUDS PERSISTED WITH NNE FLOW FROM E LK SUPERIOR INTO CNTRL AND E              
UPPER MI. 850 MB TEMPS NEAR -10C PROVIDED ENOUGH INSTABILITY FOR

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND SUNDAY)...                                             
MAIN FCST CONCERNS ARE CLOUD TRENDS AND IMPACTS ON TEMPS.                       
ANY LINGERING LES OVER CNTRL UPR MI SHOULD DIMINISH AND END EARLY               
THIS EVENING AS THE WINDS BECOME VARIABLE AND EVENTUALLY OFFSHORE.              
ALTHOUGH THE CLOUD DECK HAS BEEN SLOWLY ERODING OVER NW WI...THE                
STRENGTH OF THE INVERSION AND LACK OF SIGNIFICANT DRY ADVECTION HAS             
HINDERED ANY CLEARING. THE 18Z RUC SUGGESTS THAT AS THE RDG AXIS                
SLIDES TO THE EAST RETURN SRLY FLOW WILL PUSH THE CLOUDS NORTH OF               
UPPER MI WHILE THE NAM...AS IS OFTEN THE CASE WITH LOW LVL                      
MOISTURE...IS MORE PESSIMISTIC. GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF CLOUDS THROUGH              
CNTRL WI...A SLOWER DEPARTURE OF LOWER CLOUDS LOOKS MORE LIKELY. IN             
ADDITION...HIGHER CLOUDS AHEAD OF THE WRN CONUS TROUGH WERE ALREADY             
STREAMING TOWARD THE WRN LAKES. COMBINATION OF GREATER CLOUD COVER              
AND INCREASING S WINDS LATE TONIGHT OVER THE WEST HALF SHOULD KEEP              
TEMPS FROM DROPPING OFF AS FAR...EVEN WITH THE ABUNDANT SNOW COVER              
IN PORTIONS OF CNTRL AND E UPR MI.                                              
THERE MAY BE SOME LINGERING LOW CLOUDS INTO CNTRL UPR MI LATE                   
TONIGHT INTO SUN WITH LONG SRLY FETCH DEVELOPING ACROSS LAKE MI AND             
925 MB TEMPS FCST NEAR -4C. OTHERWISE...SOME SUNSHINE THROUGH                   
INCREASING HIGH CLOUDS SHOULD PREVAIL SUNDAY. SNOW COVER SHOULD                 
AGAIN KEEP TEMPS AOB GUIDANCE FOR INLAND PORTIONS OF CNTRL UPR MI.              
.LONG TERM (SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH NEXT SATURDAY)...                              
MAIN FORECAST CONCERN IS MODERATE TO HEAVY PERIOD OF SNOW SUNDAY                
NIGHT INTO MONDAY.                                                              
SUNDAY NIGHT...SHRTWV TROUGH EXTENDING FROM WASHINGTON INTO                     
CALIFORNIA IS PROGGED TO BE LOCATED OVER THE PLAINS AT 00Z. SINCE               
FAIRLY STRONG UPPER LEVEL RIDGING IS EXPECTED AHEAD OF THE TROUGH               
OVER THE EAST COAST...THIS TROUGH WILL HAVE TO LIFT NORTHEAST                   
TOWARDS THE CWA. BY 12Z...THE TROUGH SHOULD BE LOCATED IN WESTERN               
WISCONSIN. THE TRACK OF THE TROUGH ALSO ALLOWS FOR A 100KT JET                  
STREAK...WHICH SHOULD BE JUST SOUTH OF OMAHA AT 00Z MON...TO TRACK              
UP TO SAULT SAINTE MARIE BY 12Z...PLACING MUCH OF THE CWA IN THE                
LEFT EXIT REGION (FAVORED FOR UPPER LEVEL DIVERGENCE). IN ADDITION              
TO THE FAVORABLE UPPER JET TRACK...NAM/GFS SHOW DECENT MID-LEVEL                
FRONTOGENESIS MOVING THROUGH...ADDING EXTRA VERTICAL MOTION. OTHER              
THAN FOR SOME INITIAL DRY AIR...PARTICULARLY OVER THE EASTERN                   
CWA...CONDITIONS LOOK FAVORABLE FOR BRINGING PRECIPITATION ACROSS               
MUCH OF THE CWA BY 12Z. SINCE MODELS HAVE BEEN SHOWING THIS FEATURE             
FOR A WHILE...HAVE RAISED POPS TO CATEGORICAL. MOST TEMPERATURE                 
PROFILES ON SOUNDINGS WHEN THE PRECIPITATION IS MOVING THROUGH IS               
ALL BELOW FREEZING...EXCEPT IMMEDIATELY ALONG LAKE MICHIGAN...                  
THEREFORE MAINLY SNOW IS EXPECTED. AS FOR AMOUNTS...GIVEN THE STRONG            
VERTICAL MOTION...AT LEAST A 0.25 INCH OF LIQUID SHOULD BE POSSIBLE.            
BECAUSE OF THE SYNOPTIC NATURE OF THE SYSTEM...A 10 TO 1 SNOWFALL               
RATIO WOULD BE APPROPRIATE...HOWEVER WITH THE SATURATED  SNOW GROWTH            
LAYER A FEW THOUSAND FEET DEEP AND PLENTY OF VERTICAL MOTION IN THAT            
LAYER...WILL USE A 15 TO 1 RATIO TO ACCOUNT FOR MORE SNOWFALL.                  
ADVISORIES MAY BE NEEDED FOR THIS EVENT IF SLIGHTLY MORE QPF OCCURS             
THAN EXPECTED.                                                                  
MONDAY...SHRTWV TROUGH WILL CONTINUE MOVING NORTHEASTWARD...CROSSING            
MOST OF THE CWA BY 00Z. IN FACT...SOME WEAK UPPER LEVEL RIDGING IS              
PROGGED TO BUILD INTO FAR WESTERN LAKE SUPERIOR BY 00Z AHEAD OF                 
TROUGHING DEVELOPING OVER THE NW U.S.. EXPECT THE BAND OF                       
FRONTOGENETIC SNOWFALL TO PROGRESS EASTWARD ACROSS THE CWA WITH THE             
SHRTWV TROUGH...AND SKIES GRADUALLY CLEARING OUT BEHIND IT. WITH                
850MB TEMPS RISING TO AROUND -2C BY THE END OF THE                              
DAY...TEMPERATURES SHOULD STILL BE ABLE TO HIT THE UPPER 30S/LOW                
40S.                                                                            
MONDAY NIGHT...UPPER LEVEL RIDGING IS PROGGED TO ENCOMPASS THE CWA              
THROUGH THE NIGHT WHILE THE TROUGHING OVER THE NW MOVES TOWARDS THE             
PLAINS. SKIES SHOULD CLEAR OUT ACROSS MUCH OF THE CWA DURING THE                
EVENING DUE TO A COMBINATION OF DRY AIR ADVECTION...MID/UPPER LEVEL             
SUBSIDENCE AND LOW LEVEL ANTICYCLONIC FLOW FROM A HIGH PRESSURE                 
RIDGE MOVING ACROSS. THESE FACTORS WILL ALLOW TEMPERATURES TO DROP              
FAIRLY QUICKLY. BY 12Z...THE SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE IS PROGGED

PLAINS STATES BY 00Z WED...SIMILAR TO THAT OF 00Z MON BUT DEEPER.               
GFS/ECMWF INDICATE THAT A WEAK SHRTWV MAY MOVE ACROSS THE CWA DURING

TOUGH CALL ON THE EXACT TIMING OF MVFR CLOUD DISSIPATION                        
TONIGHT...BUT VERY DRY AIR AND LARGE SCALE SUBSIDENCE SHOULD WIN                
OUT SOONER RATHER THAN LATER. THEREFORE...CEILINGS ARE EXPECTED TO              
LIFT ABOVE 3K FEET BY MIDNIGHT...WITH STRATOCUMULUS CLOUDS                      
BECOMING SCATTERED DURING THE EARLY MORNING HOURS.                              
THIS WILL ALL BE DRIVEN BY RIDGING THAT WILL QUICKLY REPLACE THE                
TROUGHINESS CURRENTLY OVER THE REGION. 500 MB HEIGHTS WILL RISE                 
QUICKLY BEGINNING EARLY THIS EVENING...RESULTING IN STRONG                      
SUBSIDENCE AND A DRYING ATMOSPHERE. THE THINKING IS THAT THE WINDS              
WILL REMAIN UP JUST ENOUGH TO PRECLUDE ANY FOG DEVELOPMENT                      
OVERNIGHT. HOWEVER...IF WE CLEAR OUT COMPLETELY AND WINDS GO                    
NEARLY CALM...WE MAY HAVE SOME PATCHY FOG FOR A BRIEF PERIOD OF

SOUTHEAST LOWER MICHIGAN AND A WEDGE OF MOISTURE ALONG THE                      
MID/UPPER LEVEL TROUGH AXIS SLOWLY PIVOTING TO THE EAST ACROSS

OUTSIDE OF A VERY BRIEF PERIOD OF A RAIN AND SNOW MIX AT A FEW                  
LOCATIONS ACROSS THE NORTHERN COUNTIES AROUND SUNRISE...ALL                     
PRECIPITATION HAS BEEN IN THE FORM OF RAIN. RADAR COVERAGE AND

DRIZZLE (AS SUPPORTED BY OBS) STRETCHING ACROSS PART OF THE CWA

FEW DEGREES AT MOST SITES ACROSS THE CWA THIS MORNING. MOST SITES               
ARE CURRENTLY IN THE UPPER 30'S...TO THE LOW 40'S ACROSS THE                    
SOUTHERN COUNTIES. DEWPOINTS ARE ALSO WELL ABOVE FREEZING. MID                  
LEVELS WILL CONTINUE TO COOL THIS AFTERNOON...BUT AT THE SAME                   
TIME...MUCH DRIER AIR WILL ADVECT INTO THE AREA. SHALLOW MOIST                  
BOUNDARY LAYER WILL BECOME MORE UNSTABLE BUT LACK ENOUGH SUPPORT                
FOR PRECIPITATION AT THE SURFACE.

IN RESPONSE TO INCREASING EXTENT OF SHOWERS HAVING DEVELOPED IN

SCATTERED LIGHT PRECIPITATION THIS MORNING. THEN...WITH BETTER                  
MOISTURE AND STILL SOME DYNAMICS THIS AFTERNOON...WILL GO NUMEROUS              
POPS EXCEPT SCATTERED IN SAGINAW VALLEY. AS FOR PRECIPITATION

LONG TERM...SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY                                               
SAME METEOROLOGICAL THINKING APPLIES THIS MORNING FROM PREVIOUS                 
FORECASTS AS POTENT PACIFIC JET (ANALYZED NEAR 200KTS PER SATELLITE             
DERIVED INFO) WILL PLAQUE THE WEATHER ACROSS THE CONUS THIS UPCOMING            
WEEK.  STILL SEVERAL MODELS POINTING TOWARD A STRONG STORM SYSTEM TO            
IMPACT THE REGION MID-WEEK BUT NO MAJOR ARCTIC INTRUSIONS EXPECTED.             
SUNDAY...                                                                       
SURFACE HIGH AND UPPER RIDGE AXIS WILL BE OVER THE GREAT LAKES WITH             
VERY DRY FORECAST SOUNDINGS.  HOWEVER...SOME HINT OF LOW LEVEL                  
MOISTURE BUT THIS DOES SEEM SHALLOW AND THOUGHTS ARE TOWARD A MOSTLY            
SUNNY DAY.  WITH MINIMAL MIXING EXPECTED...STILL KEEP HIGH                      
TEMPERATURES GENERALLY BETWEEN 41-46 DEGREES.                                   
SUNDAY NIGHT...                                                                 
AS OBSERVED IN THE WATER VAPOR IMAGERY THIS MORNING...PACIFIC SHORT             
WAVE COMING ASHORE ACROSS THE WEST COAST OF THE CONUS RACES TOWARD              
THE PLAINS. THIS WILL AID THE SURFACE COLD FRONT TO APPROACH THE                
WESTERN LAKES OVERNIGHT.  MOISTURE APPEARS LIMITED AND QUITE NARROW             
WHICH COMES INTO THE LOCAL AREA MONDAY.  CLOUDS SHOULD BE SLOW TO               
INCREASE DUE TO THE AFOREMENTIONED LACK OF MOISTURE SO RADIATIONAL              
COOLING (AT OR A FEW DEGREES BELOW FREEZING...NEAR MAV NUMBERS)                 
SHOULD COMMENCE EARLY BEFORE SOME OF THIS CLOUD COVER MOVES INTO THE            
AREA OVERNIGHT.                                                                 
MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT...                                                      
FAST MOVING COOL FRONT...SHORT WAVE TROF AND ENTRANCE REGION OF                 
UPPER JET WILL BE IN PLACE MONDAY AFTERNOON.  DPROG/DT OF THE MODEL             
FIELDS SUGGEST QPF WILL DECREASE WITH MINIMAL MOISTURE TRANSPORT AND            
GULF ALL BUT SHUT OFF TO THIS SYSTEM.  THEREFORE POPS WILL BE                   
DECREASED ANOTHER 10% AND WILL RETAIN THE CHANCE/SLIGHT CHANCE FOR              
THE CWA.  LOCATIONS SOUTH OF M59 HAVE A GOOD SHOT OF REMAINING DRY              
BEFORE NEXT SURFACE HIGH AND A DRY COLUMN OF AIR (850-500MB RH OF               
<=20%) MOVE IN THE REGION MONDAY NIGHT.                                         
TUESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY...                                                     
MODEL CONSENSUS FOR THE MID WEEK FAVORS A WET PATTERN FOR THE GREAT             
LAKES ALTHOUGH DETAILS REMAIN IFFY.  THE UKMET/GFS/ECMWF/18Z-DGEX               
SUGGEST POTENT PACIFIC JET WILL DIVE SOUTHEAST FROM THE PACIFIC                 
NORTHWEST INTO THE SOUTH CENTRAL PLAINS WITH SURFACE CYCLOGENESIS               
ACROSS THE MID MISSISSIPPI RIVER VALLEY TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY            
AS UPPER PATTERN BECOME MORE NEGATIVELY TILTED TOWARD THE GREAT                 
LAKES.  THE LOCAL WRF-HEMI SUGGESTS A RATHER MORE PROGRESSIVE NATURE            
TO THIS SYSTEM WHICH IS AN OUTLIER BUT IT DOES HAVE SOME SUPPORT                
FROM THE RECENTLY UPGRADED CANADIAN GLOBAL.  THE ECMWF IS NEARLY                
IDENTICAL TO THE 18Z-DGEX AND WHEN BLENDING THESE MODEL SOLUTIONS TO            
THE LOCAL WRF-HEMI SUGGESTS A WEAKER SURFACE REFLECTION BUT UPPER               
PATTERN DOES AMPLIFY BUT LIKELY NOT TO THE EXTENT OF THE GFS.                   
SENSIBLE WEATHER FOR THE GREAT LAKES DOES NOT CHANGE IN THE CURRENT             
FORECAST WITH RAIN CHANCES INCREASING TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY.             
ELEVATED INSTABILITY IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE WITH SHOWALTERS                    
DROPPING BACK TOWARD 0C AND WILL ADD THE SLIGHT CHANCE FOR THUNDER.             
COOLER AIR ARRIVES THURSDAY WITH THE CHANCE FOR SOME RAIN/SNOW                  
SHOWERS.  AGAIN...NO MAJOR ARCTIC OUTBREAKS WITH THE PACIFIC ZONAL              
INFLUENCE KEEPING THE COLDER AIR LOCKED UP TO OUR NORTH.                        
FRIDAY...                                                                       
IT SEEMS WE REMAIN WITHIN A REGION OF BAROCLINICITY WITH A NEAR                 
ZONAL FLOW ACROSS THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE CONUS (MORE LIKE AN EL

MID/UPPER LEVEL TROUGH AXIS SLOWLY PIVOTING TO THE EAST ACROSS                  
LAKE MICHIGAN. WATER VAPOR DEPICTS THIS WEDGE OF MOISTURE STEADILY              
DISSIPATING...SUPPORTING AN OVERALL WEAKENING TO THIS SYSTEM.                   
OUTSIDE OF A VERY BRIEF PERIOD OF A RAIN AND SNOW MIX AT A FEW                  
LOCATIONS ACROSS THE NORTHERN COUNTIES AROUND SUNRISE...ALL                     
PRECIPITATION HAS BEEN IN THE FORM OF RAIN. RADAR COVERAGE AND                  
RETURNS SUPPORT A CONTINUED WEAKENING TREND WITH A BAND OF LIGHT                
DRIZZLE (AS SUPPORTED BY OBS) STRETCHING ACROSS PART OF THE CWA                 
WITHIN AN AREA OF WEAKENING DEFORMATION. TEMPERATURES HAVE RISEN A              
FEW DEGREES AT MOST SITES ACROSS THE CWA THIS MORNING. MOST SITES               
ARE CURRENTLY IN THE UPPER 30'S...TO THE LOW 40'S ACROSS THE                    
SOUTHERN COUNTIES. DEWPOINTS ARE ALSO WELL ABOVE FREEZING. MID                  
LEVELS WILL CONTINUE TO COOL THIS AFTERNOON...BUT AT THE SAME                   
TIME...MUCH DRIER AIR WILL ADVECT INTO THE AREA. SHALLOW MOIST                  
BOUNDARY LAYER WILL BECOME MORE UNSTABLE BUT LACK ENOUGH SUPPORT

SAME METEOROLOGICAL THINKING APPLIES THIS MORNING FROM PREVIOUS                 
FORECASTS AS POTENT PACIFIC JET (ANALYZED NEAR 200KTS PER SATELLITE             
DERIVED INFO) WILL PLAQUE THE WEATHER ACROSS THE CONUS THIS UPCOMING            
WEEK.  STILL SEVERAL MODELS POINTING TOWARD A STRONG STORM SYSTEM TO            
IMPACT THE REGION MID-WEEK BUT NO MAJOR ARCTIC INTRUSIONS EXPECTED.             
SUNDAY...                                                                       
SURFACE HIGH AND UPPER RIDGE AXIS WILL BE OVER THE GREAT LAKES WITH             
VERY DRY FORECAST SOUNDINGS.  HOWEVER...SOME HINT OF LOW LEVEL                  
MOISTURE BUT THIS DOES SEEM SHALLOW AND THOUGHTS ARE TOWARD A MOSTLY            
SUNNY DAY.  WITH MINIMAL MIXING EXPECTED...STILL KEEP HIGH                      
TEMPERATURES GENERALLY BETWEEN 41-46 DEGREES.                                   
SUNDAY NIGHT...                                                                 
AS OBSERVED IN THE WATER VAPOR IMAGERY THIS MORNING...PACIFIC SHORT             
WAVE COMING ASHORE ACROSS THE WEST COAST OF THE CONUS RACES TOWARD              
THE PLAINS. THIS WILL AID THE SURFACE COLD FRONT TO APPROACH THE                
WESTERN LAKES OVERNIGHT.  MOISTURE APPEARS LIMITED AND QUITE NARROW             
WHICH COMES INTO THE LOCAL AREA MONDAY.  CLOUDS SHOULD BE SLOW TO               
INCREASE DUE TO THE AFOREMENTIONED LACK OF MOISTURE SO RADIATIONAL              
COOLING (AT OR A FEW DEGREES BELOW FREEZING...NEAR MAV NUMBERS)                 
SHOULD COMMENCE EARLY BEFORE SOME OF THIS CLOUD COVER MOVES INTO THE            
AREA OVERNIGHT.                                                                 
MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT...                                                      
FAST MOVING COOL FRONT...SHORT WAVE TROF AND ENTRANCE REGION OF                 
UPPER JET WILL BE IN PLACE MONDAY AFTERNOON.  DPROG/DT OF THE MODEL             
FIELDS SUGGEST QPF WILL DECREASE WITH MINIMAL MOISTURE TRANSPORT AND            
GULF ALL BUT SHUT OFF TO THIS SYSTEM.  THEREFORE POPS WILL BE                   
DECREASED ANOTHER 10% AND WILL RETAIN THE CHANCE/SLIGHT CHANCE FOR              
THE CWA.  LOCATIONS SOUTH OF M59 HAVE A GOOD SHOT OF REMAINING DRY              
BEFORE NEXT SURFACE HIGH AND A DRY COLUMN OF AIR (850-500MB RH OF               
<=20%) MOVE IN THE REGION MONDAY NIGHT.                                         
TUESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY...                                                     
MODEL CONSENSUS FOR THE MID WEEK FAVORS A WET PATTERN FOR THE GREAT             
LAKES ALTHOUGH DETAILS REMAIN IFFY.  THE UKMET/GFS/ECMWF/18Z-DGEX               
SUGGEST POTENT PACIFIC JET WILL DIVE SOUTHEAST FROM THE PACIFIC                 
NORTHWEST INTO THE SOUTH CENTRAL PLAINS WITH SURFACE CYCLOGENESIS               
ACROSS THE MID MISSISSIPPI RIVER VALLEY TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY            
AS UPPER PATTERN BECOME MORE NEGATIVELY TILTED TOWARD THE GREAT                 
LAKES.  THE LOCAL WRF-HEMI SUGGESTS A RATHER MORE PROGRESSIVE NATURE            
TO THIS SYSTEM WHICH IS AN OUTLIER BUT IT DOES HAVE SOME SUPPORT                
FROM THE RECENTLY UPGRADED CANADIAN GLOBAL.  THE ECMWF IS NEARLY                
IDENTICAL TO THE 18Z-DGEX AND WHEN BLENDING THESE MODEL SOLUTIONS TO            
THE LOCAL WRF-HEMI SUGGESTS A WEAKER SURFACE REFLECTION BUT UPPER               
PATTERN DOES AMPLIFY BUT LIKELY NOT TO THE EXTENT OF THE GFS.                   
SENSIBLE WEATHER FOR THE GREAT LAKES DOES NOT CHANGE IN THE CURRENT             
FORECAST WITH RAIN CHANCES INCREASING TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY.             
ELEVATED INSTABILITY IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE WITH SHOWALTERS                    
DROPPING BACK TOWARD 0C AND WILL ADD THE SLIGHT CHANCE FOR THUNDER.             
COOLER AIR ARRIVES THURSDAY WITH THE CHANCE FOR SOME RAIN/SNOW                  
SHOWERS.  AGAIN...NO MAJOR ARCTIC OUTBREAKS WITH THE PACIFIC ZONAL              
INFLUENCE KEEPING THE COLDER AIR LOCKED UP TO OUR NORTH.                        
FRIDAY...                                                                       
IT SEEMS WE REMAIN WITHIN A REGION OF BAROCLINICITY WITH A NEAR                 
ZONAL FLOW ACROSS THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE CONUS (MORE LIKE AN EL               
NINO PATTERN WITH LATEST SST ANALYSIS INDICATING EASTERN PACIFIC

COOLED QUICKLY BEHIND SFC FROPA EARLIER THIS EVENING...ALLOWING                 
FOR A CHANGE TO SNOW ALONG THE FOOTHILLS...AND SOME LIGHT SNOW                  
ACCUMULATION IS NOTED AT RED LODGE AS OF 0230Z. PCPN IS HEAVIEST                
ALONG THE SOUTHERN HIGHER TERRAIN PER THE POST FRONTAL NW FLOW.                 
LOCATIONS TO THE NORTH AND EAST HAVE SEEN LITTLE MORE THAN                      
SPRINKLES OR VIRGA DUE TO THE DRY LOW LEVELS. HAVE REDUCED EVENING              
POPS FROM BILLINGS NORTH/EAST TO JUST ISOLD...AND EVEN THIS IS                  
PROBABLY TOO OPTIMISTIC GIVEN LATEST SATELLITE/RADAR TRENDS. HAVE               
RAISED POPS ALONG THE SOUTHERN FOOTHILLS...WHERE THEY SHOULD SEE                
UP TO AN INCH OF QUICK SNOW FROM NYE TO RED LODGE.

COLDEST AIR ALOFT MOVES IN FROM THE WEST WITH A SECONDARY WEAK

ONLY MINOR CHANGES FOR THE EXTENDED FORECAST THIS AFTERNOON. WILL               
KEEP PRECIPITATION CHANCES AS INHERITED DUE TO LIFT ASSOCIATED                  
WITH THE COLD FRONTAL PASSAGE TUESDAY. AFTER THIS ROUND OF                      
PRECIPITATION SHIFTS EAST OF THE AREA TUESDAY NIGHT...THE NEXT                  
JET STREAK WILL COME ASHORE IN WASHINGTON STATE AND INDUCE                      
SURFACE PRESSURE FALLS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA WEDNESDAY. WARM                 
AIR ADVECTION ALOFT AS THIS TROUGH AND WARM FRONT SHIFT EAST WILL               
PRODUCE A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR RAIN SHOWERS ACROSS THE CENTRAL AND                 
WESTERN ZONES WEDNESDAY. IN ADDITION...VERY FAST WESTERLY FLOW                  
ASSOCIATED WITH THE JET STREAK WILL ENHANCE PRECIPITATION CHANCES               
IN THE MOUNTAIN AREAS...PARTICULARLY THE WEST FACING SLOPES. AS                 
THE SURFACE LOW PASSES TO THE NORTH...PRESSURE GRADIENTS BETWEEN                
EASTERN IDAHO AND THE LEWISTOWN AREA ARE CURRENTLY FORECAST TO BE               
ENOUGH TO SUPPORT AT LEAST ADVISORY CRITERIA WINDS IN THE UPPER                 
YELLOWSTONE AND UPPER STILLWATER VALLEYS. SINCE THIS IS STILL                   
FOUR DAYS OUT IN THE FORECAST...HAVE ONLY ADJUSTED WIND SPEEDS UP               
IN THE GRIDS. WILL NEED TO WATCH THIS WEDNESDAY NIGHT PERIOD FOR                
POSSIBLE HIGH WIND WARNINGS IN THOSE AREAS. NO MAJOR CHANGES FOR                
PRECIPITATION CHANCES BEYOND THAT POINT IN THE FORECAST...KEEPING               
THE IDEA THAT THE FAST ZONAL WESTERLY FLOW WILL CONTINUE TO                     
PRODUCE THE BEST CHANCES FOR PRECIPITATION IN THE MOUNTAIN                      
AREAS...PARTICULARLY THE WEST FACING SLOPES.                                    
HAVE INCREASED TEMPERATURES SLIGHTLY FROM WEDNESDAY THROUGH

HOLDING IN THE MID 60S INLAND TO UPPER 60S FAR EAST AND OUTER                   
BANKS WITH SOUTHERLY FLOW AHEAD OF FRONT. OVERNIGHT LOWS APPEAR ON

FRONT IS STILL WELL TO THE WEST. OBSERVATIONS AHEAD OF THE FRONT                
INDICATE CIGS IN THE 4K TO 5K FT RANGE WITH MINIMAL VSBY REDUCTION              
WHILE BEHIND THE FRONT CIGS DROP TO AROUND 1500 FT WITH MVFR VSBYS              
IN RAIN. COULD BE A BRIEF PERIOD OF LOWER CIGS/VSBYS IN CONVECTION              
LATE TONIGHT BUT OVERALL FEEL CONVECTION WILL BE VERY SHORT LIVED               
AND CONCENTRATED NEAR THE FRONT AND SCATTERED AT BEST. LOW LVL                  
CLOUDS BEHIND THE FRONT LIKELY TO HANG ON SUNDAY WITH MVFR CIGS

.MARINE...WINDS NEAR DIAMOND BUOY INCREASING A BIT FASTER THAN                  
OTHER LOCATIONS LIKELY DUE TO ENHANCED MIXING ON THE WESTERN EDGE               
OF THE GULF STREAM WHERE SSTS ARE APPROACHING 80 DEGREES. SEAS                  
HAVE RISEN TO 7 FT AT DIAMOND AS WELL...WELL ABOVE THE NEAR SHORE               
BUOYS THAT ARE REPORTING MAINLY 2 TO 3 FT. SOME CONVECTION IS                   
PRESENT ALONG THE WESTERN EDGE OF THE GULF STREAM AND THE HIER                  
SEAS AT DIAMOND MAY BE IN RESPONSE TO THIS AS WELL. OVERALL THINK               
GFS IS STILL DOING A SLIGHTLY BETTER JOB WITH WINDS. RUC DOES NOT               
APPEAR TO INCREASE WINDS ENOUGH THROUGH THE NIGHT. IT IS CLOSER TO              
THE NAM BUT WITH LESSER SPEEDS. SIG PRESSURE RISES BEHIND THE                   
FRONT SHOULD INDUCE STRONGER WINDS AS PRES GRADIENT BEGINS TO                   
TIGHTEN LATE TONIGHT. HAVE MADE ONLY MINOR ADJUSTMENTS TO WINDS

WAS BEGINNING TO APPROACH THE APPALACHIANS FROM THE TN VALLEY...                
AND WAS BEGINNING TO TAKE ON A NEGATIVE TILT. SHOWERS AND ISOLATED              
THUNDERSTORMS ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE IN COVERAGE AND INTENSITY                
IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS FROM GSP TO CLT... THEN OVERSPREAD MUCH OF                
CENTRAL NC OVERNIGHT. POP WILL BE NEAR 100 AND QPF BETWEEN 0.25 TO

THE LINE OF CONVECTION ASSOCIATED WITH THE COLD FRONT HAS BEEN                  
DIMINISHING IN INTENSITY OVER OUR WESTERN PIEDMONT IN THE PAST                  
HOUR. THE CG LIGHTNING STRIKES HAD GREATLY DECREASED FROM THE LATE              
AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING OVER NW NC... MAINLY DUE TO THE LOSS                
OF THE REMAINING MINIMAL INSTABILITY. HOWEVER... THE GUST FRONT                 
HAS BEEN FORMIDABLE AS IT ROLLED THROUGH THE TRIAD REGION WITH                  
GUSTS TO 36 MPH REPORTED AT WINSTON- SALEM (827 PM)... AND 31 MPH               
AT GREENSBORO (905 PM). THIS COLD FRONT IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE                 
MOVING EAST THROUGH THE PIEDMONT THROUGH 06Z/12 AND THEN SLOW DOWN              
AS A SURFACE WAVE IS EXPECTED TO DEVELOP ON THE FRONT IN THE                    
VICINITY OF SOP TO RDU BETWEEN 06Z-09Z.                                         
02Z/12 NOVEMBER UPPER AIR DATA INDICATED THE STRONGEST UPPER                    
DIVERGENCE AND MID LEVEL ASCENT WAS LOCATED ON THE NOSE OF A 100                
KNOT 300 MB JET... OVER UPSTATE SC EXTENDING INTO THE SW PIEDMONT OF            
NC NEAR CLT. IR SATELLITE IMAGERY INDICATED COOLING CLOUD TOPS                  
OVER THIS SAME REGION AND RADAR INDICATED AN INCREASE IN ACTIVITY               
APPROACHING THE SW PIEDMONT OF NC.                                              
AS THE MID AND UPPER LOW CONTINUES TO BECOME NEGATIVELY TILTED                  
AND CLOSES OFF AS IT COMES EAST OVER NC TONIGHT... CONDITIONS WILL              
BE FAVORABLE FOR STRONG MID LEVEL ASCENT TO CONTINUE TO OVERSPREAD              
CENTRAL NC. IT IS STILL TOO EARLY TO TELL WHICH MODEL SOLUTION                  
REGARDING THE EXACT TRACK THE CUT OFF LOW WILL TAKE LATER TONIGHT               
AND SUNDAY... BUT THE LATEST RUC AND NEW 00Z/12 NAM SUPPORT THE                 
EARLIER THINKING OF A TRACK THAT WOULD BE ACROSS NC.                            
WITH THE ABOVE IN MIND... THIS UPDATE WILL RAISE THE POP TO 100                 
ACROSS CENTRAL NC FOR THE OVERNIGHT PERIOD. SHOWERS WILL BECOME                 
WIDESPREAD WITH ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS THROUGHOUT CENTRAL NC. THE               
00Z NAM SUPPORTS THE CURRENT TRENDS... AND IF THE TRACK AND                     
INTENSITY OF THE MID-UPPER LEVEL SYSTEM PROVES CORRECT LATER                    
TONIGHT AND SUNDAY... THERE WILL HAVE TO BE ADJUSTMENTS MADE LATER

PASSED JEFFERSON AND BOONE IN ASHE AND WATAUGA COUNTIES... AND                  
WILL BE MOVING OFF THE BLUE RIDGE AND INTO THE WESTERN PIEDMONT                 
IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS. A SOLID LINE OF SHOWERS AND SCATTERED

SHORT TERM /REST OF TONIGHT/...                                                 
WILL UPDATE THE FORECAST NOW BASED ON CURRENT SATELLITE AND RADAR               
TRENDS. THE FRONT WILL BE MOVING INTO THE PIEDMONT TRIAD REGION                 
BY MID EVENING (EARLIER THAN PREVIOUS THINKING... ACCOMPANIED BY A              
LINE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS). WILL RAISE EVENING POP OVER THE             
WESTERN PIEDMONT TO 100 PERCENT. WILL ADD SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS.              
WILL ALSO INDICATE A STRONG WIND SHIFT TO THE NW-N BEHIND THE FRONT             
WITH GUSTS TO 20-25 MPH.                                                        
LATER UPDATES WILL BE LIKELY FOR THE EASTERN PIEDMONT AS THE                    
CURRENT WATER VAPOR LOOP INDICATES THE MID AND UPPER LOW                        
APPROACHING THE TN VALLEY IS GOING TO BECOME NEGATIVELY TILTED IN               
THE NEXT FEW HOURS... AND CLOSE OFF OVERNIGHT IN WESTERN NC. POP                
WILL HAVE TO BE RAISED TO NEAR 100 EARLIER THAN ANTICIPATED.                    
QPF WILL HAVE TO BE MONITORED CLOSELY AND WILL STRONGLY BE TIED TO              
EXACTLY WHERE THE CUT OFF FORMS. A DEEPER AND MORE SOUTHERN CUT

SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT/...                                   
MODELS QUICKLY DIVERGE WITH THEIR FORECAST FOR TONIGHT AND INTO                 
SUNDAY WITH ONE SET OF MODELS (INCLUDING THE NAM) DROPING THE 500               
MILLIBAR LOW NEAR THE SOUTH CAROLINA BORDER WHILE THE GFS AND                   
OTHERS MOVE THE LOW ALONG THE VIRGINIA BORDER. I CAN FIND NO                    
MAJOR CLUES TO THE CORRECT SOLUTION AND AM RELATIVELY SATISFIED TO              
GO WITH A COMPROMISE.                                                           
AS THE UPPER LEVEL LOW IS FORECAST TO DEEPEN AS IT DROPS SOUTH...               
THE CURRENT THIN LINE OF SHOWERS SHOULD BLOSSOM OVER NORTH                      
CAROLINA INTO A LARGER BLOB TOWARD MIDNIGHT. RAINS SHOULD BEGIN TO              
EXIT THE WEST AFTER SUNRISE AND LEAVE THE NORTHEAST PARTS IN THE                
AFTERNOON. IT IS CERTAINLY OPEN TO DEBATE THAT SOME RAINS MAY STILL             
BE OVER THE ROANOKE RIVER AFTER DARK... BUT WILL LEAVE SUNDAY                   
NIGHT DRY AT THIS TIME. STORM TOTAL PRECIPITATION IN EXCESS OF ONE              
INCH TOWARD VIRGINIA...TAPERING OFF TO THE SOUTHEAST. CHANCES FOR               
THUNDER LOOK BEST IN THE WEST AND EARLY IN THE EVENT...BUT LEADING              
COLD ADVECTION AT THE SURFACE MAY KNOCK THE LEGS OFF OF ANY                     
THUNDER THREAT BEFORE IT BEGINS.                                                
LOW LEVEL THICKNESS FALLS FROM THIS EVENING TO SUNRISE SUNDAY ARE               
FORECAST TO BE ON THE ORDER OF 60 METERS. NO HOPE OF CORRECTLY                  
NAILING DOWN TIMING AND INTENSITY. DID RISK INCREASING THE                      
TEMPERATURE GRADIENT WEST TO EAST ACROSS THE AREA TO TEN DEGREES                
AND GRADIENT COULD BE A BIT STRONGER. FOUR TO SEVEN DEGREE DIURNAL              
RISE TO SUNDAY HIGH TEMPERATURES COULD BE TOO HIGH...ESPECIALLY NORTH.          
LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...                                       
DID NOT SPEND A LOT OF TIME HERE WITH PROBLEMS IN THE SHORT TERM                
FORECAST. ANOTHER LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM MAY BRING RAINS AS EARLY AS               
WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON...WITH WEDNESDAY NIGHT PERHAPS THE BETTER BET               
AT THIS TIME. TEMPERATURES WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON AND THURSDAY                     
MORNING WILL BE ABOVE NORMAL...OTHERWISE NOT STRAYING TOO FAR FROM              
CLIMATOLOGY.

WARM SOUTHERLY FLOW WILL CONTINUE OVER THE AREA THROUGH THE                     
AFTERNOON...WITH SOUTH TO SOUTHWEST WINDS AT 10 TO 15 MPH. MAINLY               
HIGH LEVEL CLOUDS WILL OVERSPREAD THE AREA IN ADVANCE OF A COLD                 
FRONT. THE FRONT WILL APPROACH THE WESTERN PORTION OF THE REGION                
THIS EVENING AND TRACK EAST TONIGHT. BROKEN CLOUDS AROUND 10                    
THOUSAND FEET WILL DEVELOP AFTER 22Z. CONDITIONS WILL LOWER TO MVFR             
IN RAIN AND FOG AFTER MIDNIGHT IN THE WEST... AND SPREAD EAST AFTER             
09Z. MOISTURE WRAPPING AROUND THE ASSOCIATED LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM                
WHICH WILL BE LOCATED OVER THE SOUTHERN VIRGINIA COAST AFTER 12Z                
WILL DELAY IMPROVING CONDITIONS UNTIL AFTER 13Z IN THE WEST... 15Z              
IN THE EAST... AND THE EARLY AFTERNOON IN THE NORTHEAST. WINDS WILL             
SHIFT TO THE WEST AT 10 TO 20 MPH AFTER 09Z ...AND TO THE NORTHWEST

THE LATEST RUC ANALYSIS PLACES THE CENTER OF SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE              
NEAR THE NW CORNER OF ARKANSAS AND NE CORNER OF OKLAHOMA AT THIS                
HOUR. CONSEQUENTLY... TEMPERATURES IN THAT PORTION OF THE FORECAST              
AREA HAVE FALLEN RAPIDLY TO NEAR FORECAST MINIMUMS. SEVERAL OTHER               
SITES FURTHER WEST ACROSS NORTHERN OKLAHOMA HAVE ALSO DROPPED A                 
LITTLE MORE THAN EXPECTED. COPIOUS HIGH CLOUDS TO OUR NORTH AND                 
WEST SHOULD HAVE TROUBLE MAKING IT INTO THE REGION WITH THE                     
BUILDING UPPER RIDGE. HAVE THEREFORE LOWERED OVERNIGHT MINIMUMS                 
SEVERAL DEGREES ACROSS BASICALLY OUR NORTHERN TIER OF COUNTIES.                 
HAVE ADJUSTED HOURLY GRIDS FOR TEMP AND RH AND SENT ALL UPDATED

A COLD NIGHT IN STORE TONIGHT WITH SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE PROVIDING              
CLEAR SKIES AND LIGHT WINDS. TEMPS TONIGHT EXPECTED TO BE WELL DOWN             
INTO THE 30S...WITH NORMALLY COOLER SPOTS FALLING BELOW FREEZING.               
SOUTHERLY WINDS RETURNING IN WESTERN AREAS BY MORNING...AS THE                  
SURFACE HIGH SLIDES OFF TO THE EAST...SHOULD KEEP TEMPS IN

LOOKS LIKE A FEW UNEVENTFUL DAYS FOR SUNDAY AND MONDAY AS ANOTHER               
WAVE BYPASSES THE AREA TO THE NORTH. A WEAK BOUNDARY SHOULD MAKE                
ITS WAY INTO THE AREA LATE SUNDAY NIGHT...BUT NOT ENOUGH MOISTURE               
TO WARRANT ANY POPS OVER THE AREA AND NO DRAMATIC TEMPS CHANGES                 
EXPECTED.  TEMPS SUNDAY AND MONDAY SHOULD BE GENERALLY NEAR

HAIL WAS REPORTED IN WATAUGA COUNTY IN NC...RIGHT ALONG THE NC/W

BLEND OF THE TWO MODELS AS WELL AS LOOKING AT HPC'S PRECIP

PIEDMONT AND CNTRL VA. AMOUNTS COULD BE UP TO THREE INCHES IN SOME

RIDGE TO PASS SLOWLY EAST ACROSS SOUTHEAST MI TODAY INTO TONIGHT. AT            
500 MB...MEANWHILE...SHORTWAVE RIDGE OVERHEAD TODAY TO RETREAT EAST             
TONIGHT.                                                                        
EXCEPT AS NOTED BELOW...OVERALL DESCENT SEEN IN OMEGA FIELDS TODAY

DIVERGENCE/SUBSIDENCE.                                                          
850 TO 500 MB MOISTURE RATHER MEAGER THROUGH TONIGHT. INCREASING                
CIRRUS...THOUGH...LIKELY TO BE SEEN MAINLY LATE TONIGHT BEHIND RIDGE            
ALOFT. LOW LEVEL MOISTURE...AS AT 925 MB...EXPECTED TO DIMINISH                 
TODAY.                                                                          
THE EXCEPTION TO NO WEATHER IS THE OVERNIGHT SPRINKLES AND FLURRIES             
SEEN OVER MUCH OF THE FORECAST AREA...LARGELY RELATED TO LAKE EFFECT            
FROM NORTH TO NORTHEAST FLOW OFF OF LAKE HURON. DELTA TS INTO THE               
LOWER TEENS EARLIER IN THE NIGHT SHOULD LESSEN STEADILY THIS MORNING            
AS 850 MB TEMPERATURES WARM BEHIND THE BRIEF THERMAL TROUGH. NAM/RUC            
AND GFS SHOW GOOD LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE...TENDING TO MAXIMIZE                   
AROUND 06Z...ALSO ON THE WANE THIS MORNING. NAM ALSO SHOWS MODEST               
950 MB OMEGA LIFT...MAINLY IN THE THUMB...WANING THIS MORNING. WILL             
CARRY MENTION OF SPRINKLES OR FLURRIES INTO THE MORNING FOR MOST OF             
THE AREA...THEN RIDGE OVERHEAD THIS AFTERNOON SHOULD KILL OFF ANY               
MORE POSSIBILITY OF THIS TRACE PRECIPITATION. PERSISTENCE OF                    
SPRINKLES...AS OPPOSED TO FLURRIES...SEEMS RELATED TO SHALLOW DEPTH             
OF MOISTURE AND THUS VERY POOR ICE NUCLEATION POTENTIAL...AS PER                
MODEL SOUNDINGS.                                                                
AS FOR CLOUD COVER TODAY...MOST MODELS INDICATE LESSENING BY                    
AFTERNOON...AND WILL SO INDICATE. SATELLITE IMAGERY ALREADY SHOWING             
SOME THIN SPOTS/HOLES IN THE CLOUD COVER. DAYTIME MIXING SHOULD AID             
IN CLOUD COVER DECREASE.

.LONG TERM...MONDAY THROUGH SUNDAY                                              
CONFIDENCE IS INCREASING FOR A POTENT STORM TO IMPACT THE REGION FOR            
MID WEEK...HOWEVER...PREDICTABILITY OF THE EVENTUAL UPPER FLOW                  
REGIME ACROSS THE CONUS REMAINS BELOW AVERAGE. SATELLITE DERIVED                
WINDS IN THE EASTERN PACIFIC AS OF 03Z WERE AVERAGING AROUND 120KTS             
WITH A DEVELOPING JET STREAK APPROACHING 150KTS EAST OF 150W                    
INBETWEEN 40-50N.  GLOBAL MODELS SEEM TO HAVE INITIALIZED THE                   
PACIFIC JET ORIENTATION AND GENERAL STRENGTH AS THE ECMWF APPEARS TO            
HAVE PICKED UP THE JET STREAK EARLIER THAN THE OTHER OPERATIONAL                
GLOBAL MODELS.  THIS FEATURE(S) WILL BE OUR FORECAST CHALLENGE FOR              
THIS UPCOMING WEEK.                                                             
BEGINNING WITH MONDAY...LONG WAVE TROUGH CURRENTLY PROGRESSING                  
THROUGH THE INTERMOUNTAIN WEST AND EMBEDDED SHORT WAVE ACROSS THE               
FOUR CORNERS WILL LIFT NORTHEAST THROUGH THE DAY AS SHORT WAVE RIDGE            
AND SURFACE HIGH PRECEDING IT SLIDES FURTHER EAST.  WHILE A GOOD                
AERIAL COVERAGE OF PRECIP IS EXPECTED TO ACCOMPANY THIS FEATURE                 
INITIALLY...DECREASING THERMAL GRADIENT IN THE LOW-MID LEVELS ACROSS            
THE MID-UPPER MISSISSIPPI RIVER VALLEY AND BEST UPPER SUPPORT WILL              
LIFT INTO CANADA AND REDUCE THE CHANCES OF PRECIP FOR THE CWA.  IN              
FACT...HARD TO FIND A MODEL THAT PRINTS ANY QPF ACROSS THE CWA.  DO             
NOT FEEL COMPELLED TO REMOVE POPS COMPLETELY AND WILL RETAIN THE                
CURRENT FORECAST WITH 20% POPS ALONG AND NORTH OF 8-MILE WITH 30%               
POPS AROUND THE TRI CITIES.  THEN A BRIEF RESPITE MONDAY NIGHT INTO             
TUESDAY AS WEAK SURFACE HIGH AND SHORT WAVE RIDGE AXIS MOVES ACROSS             
THE GREAT LAKES.  HOWEVER... LOW LEVEL MOISTURE REMAINS RATHER HIGH             
AS OBSERVED IN THE GFS/NAM/WRF-HEMI SOUNDINGS HENCE THE PERCENT                 
CLOUD COVER WILL REMAIN RATHER HIGH THROUGH EARLY TUESDAY MORNING.              
POTENT PACIFIC JET COMES ASHORE AND DIVES SOUTHEAST INTO THE THE                
FOUR CORNERS REGION TUESDAY NIGHT WITH SURFACE LOW DEVELOPING IN THE            
VICINITY OF THE PANHANDLE OF TEXAS.  DEPENDING ON HOW THIS PATTERN              
UNFOLDS ACROSS THE CONUS...TRENDS IN THE GLOBAL MODELS SUGGEST UPPER            
PATTERN QUICKLY BECOMES NEGATIVELY TILTED AS GULF OF MEXICO MOISTURE            
ADVANCES NORTHWARD WEDNESDAY-WEDNESDAY NIGHT.  CROSS SECTIONS FROM              
THE GFS SHOW A RATHER POTENT PETTERSSEN 2-D FGEN LAYER BETWEEN                  
850-700MB WITH AN INCREASED SLANTWISE INSTABILITY (INCLUDING DEPTH)             
JUST ABOVE THIS LAYER AS SUGGESTED IN THE LOWERING EPV/S ACROSS THE             
CWA.  COULD SEE A BAND(S) OF HEAVY RAIN AND THUNDER WEDNESDAY                   
AFTERNOON INTO THURSDAY MORNING...THIS WILL NEED TO MONITORED                   
CLOSELY AS PWATS ARE EXPECTED TO CLIMB IN EXCESS OF 1 INCH.                     
LOW BECOMES VERTICALLY STACKED ACROSS THE STATE THROUGH THURSDAY                
WITH A SLOW RETREAT NORTHWARD THROUGH THE END OF THIS WEEK.  850MB              
TEMPS DROP BACK TOWARD THE NEGATIVE TERRITORY AND PERHAPS EVEN LOWER            
INTO THE WEEKEND AS UPPER FLOW AMPLIFIES TOWARD A RIDGE ACROSS THE              
ROCKIES AND A TROUGH ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES/MIDDLE ATLANTIC COAST.              
THIS SETS THE STAGE FOR THE CHANCE OF SNOW SHOWERS FROM THE                     
COLD/MOIST CYCLONIC FLOW AND CONTRIBUTIONS FROM LAKE MICHIGAN.  WILL            
GO LOWER THAN MEX NUMBERS AND ADD POPS FOR SNOW THROUGH AT LEAST                
NEXT SATURDAY.

SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL GRADUALLY BUILD INTO LOWER MICHIGAN                  
TONIGHT. DESPITE THIS HIGH...LOW LEVEL MOISTURE FLUX OVER LAKE HURON

POSITIVE VORTICITY ADVECTION FROM THE 500 MB LOW/VORTICITY MAXIMUM              
WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT PRESSURE FALLS NEAR THE EAST CENTRAL NORTH

CONVECTION)...AND LIFTED INDICES NEAR ZERO THIS MORNING.                        
DEVELOPING SOUTHEAST TO EAST BOUNDARY LAYER FLOW THIS

DEEP CONVECTION (AS SHOWN BY ALL MODELS INCREASING THE SHOALWATER               
INDEX TO ABOVE 0 AND MOST ABOVE 2 THIS AFTERNOON).                              
AS FAR AS TEMPERATURES GO ALL BUT ORANGE/WESTERN PASSAIC COUNTIES               
ALREADY HAVE TEMPERATURES AROUND 60...SO USED WARMEST AVAILABLE                 
GUIDANCE FOR HIGHS. EXPECT TEMPERATURES TO GENERALLY RISE 3-5                   
DEGREES FROM CURRENT LEVELS BEFORE ONSET OF STEADIER

DURING THE AFTERNOON.                                                           
HAVE QUITE A LARGE NUMBER OF OBSERVATIONS OF VISIBILITIES OF 2 MILES            
OR LESS...SO HAVE PATCHY FOG IN THE ZONES THIS MORNING. AS                      
SOUTHEAST TO EAST FLOW SETS UP AND STRENGTHENS BY THIS AFTERNOON                
IN THE BOUNDARY LAYER THE FOG SHOULD MIX OUT...BUT THIS SHOULD                  
PROMOTE PATCHY DRIZZLE IN THE AFTERNOON (ESPECIALLY OVER LONG                   
ISLAND AND COASTAL CT) WHEN IT IS NOT RAINING.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...                                      
WHILE I INITIALLY PREFER THE NAM WITH STORM TRACK...OVER TIME IT                
BECOMES THE SLOWEST IN LIFTING THE STORM TO THE NORTH...AND HAS                 
BEEN IN THE PAST FEW RUNS SLIGHTLY ACCELERATING ITS SOLUTION AND                
SHIFTING IT FURTHER WEST. THIS IS STILL TRUE WITH THE 6Z                        
NAM...WHICH IS FURTHER WEST AND NORTH THAN THE 0Z NAM AT 0Z                     
WEDNESDAY. THE GFS REMAINS THE FASTEST MODEL LIFTING NORTH...AND                
IS AN OUTLIER IN THIS...SO HAVE DISREGARDED IT. THE 0Z                          
UKMET/ECMWF/3Z SREF ENSEMBLE MEAN ARE A REASONABLE SOLUTION IN                  
TERMS OF SPEED (THOUGH THE ECMWF IS FURTHER EAST THAN THE OTHER                 
2...ALSO FURTHER EAST THAN THE 6Z NAM)...SO FOLLOWED THE 12Z                    
UKMET/3Z SREF FOR THE LOW TRACK BY TUESDAY MORNING. CURRENTLY                   
EXPECT THE LOW TO BE CENTERED SOUTH OF MONTAUK POINT TUESDAY                    
MORNING...THEN LIFT NORTH ACROSS/JUST TO THE EAST OF FAR EASTERN                
PORTIONS OF THE CWA TUESDAY MORNING/EARLY TUESDAY AFTERNOON.                    
THIS LOW TRACK MADE NECESSARY CHANGES TO THE CURRENT FORECAST. THE              
MAIN CHANGE IS THE SHIFT OF THE AXIS OF QPF TO THE EAST. WHILE                  
EXACT DETAILS ARE IN THE HYDROLOGY SECTION...THIS RESULTS IN                    
DROPPING THE FLOOD WATCH. EXPECT PERIODS OF RAIN THIS AFTERNOON                 
AND EVENING WITH PATCHY DRIZZLE AS THE TROUGH ASSOCIATED WITH THE               
DEVELOPING COASTAL LOW CROSSES THE AREA...THEN EXPECT A LULL FROM               
LATE TONIGHT INTO MONDAY MORNING AS THE COASTAL LOW CONSOLIDATES                
AND LIFTS SLOWLY NORTH AND EAST. HAVE LOWERED POPS TO CHANCE                    
DURING THIS TIME...AS IT WILL BE MAINLY PREDOMINATED BY DRIZZLE.                
INCREASE POPS TO LIKELY MONDAY AFTERNOON AND NIGHT AS COASTAL LOW               
GETS BETTER ORGANIZED AND DRAWS NEAR. FOCUS LIKELY POPS TUESDAY                 
MORNING (IN COLLABORATION WITH SURROUNDING OFFICES) OVER EASTERN

SETS UP OVER THE REGION AHEAD OF THE NEXT SYSTEM WHICH SHOULD BE                
LOCATED OVER THE UPPER OHIO RIVER VALLEY/LOWER GREAT LAKES BY

THE END OF THIS WEEK...THE FORECAST IN GENERAL REFLECTS THIS...SO               
COUPLED WITH MORE PRESSING SHORT TERM CONCERNS...MADE NO CHANGES

GENERALLY IFR CONDITIONS ARE LIKELY THROUGH 06Z MON. SOME SPOTS WILL            
SEE MVFR OR LIFR/VLIFR AT TIMES...BUT THESE WILL TEND TO BE THE                 
EXCEPTION RATHER THAN THE RULE. SATURATED LOW LEVELS HAS LED TO A               
GOOD BIT OF FOG EARLY THIS MORNING...LOCALLY DENSE. EXPECT THE FOG              
TO BECOME LESS PREVALENT LATER THIS MORNING AS NE FLOW KICKS                    
IN...BUT IFR CIGS WILL CONTINUE. RAIN WILL BE DEVELOPING DURING THE             
DAY AS WELL...LIKELY BECOMING WIDESPREAD IN THE AFTERNOON. THE RAIN             
COULD BE HEAVY AT TIMES DURING THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING WITH                   
CIGS/VSBYS DROPPING DOWN INTO THE LIFR CATEGORY. STEADY RAIN WILL               
GIVE WAY TO MORE OF A DRIZZLE SITUATION LATE TONIGHT...BUT THERE IS             
LITTLE HOPE FOR IMPROVING AVIATION CONDITIONS THROUGH 12Z MON. THE              
NEXT TAF PACKAGE WILL LIKELY REFLECT IFR OR WORSE CONDITIONS                    
CONTINUING THROUGH THAT TIME.                                                   
LGT/VRBL WINDS WILL BECOME E THEN NE THIS MORNING. SPEEDS WILL RANGE            
FROM 6-12 KT. NE FLOW WILL INCREASE A BIT TONIGHT INTO THE 10-15 KT             
RANGE.

WIND FCST REMAINS DIFFICULT AS 00Z MODELS CONTINUE TO PRESENT A                 
VARIETY OF SOLUTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE PLACEMENT AND INTENSITY OF LOW         
PRESSURE ALONG THE MID ATLANTIC COAST DURING THE NEXT 24-48 HOURS.              
BASICALLY THE GFS IS FASTEST TO MOVE THE SFC LOW NORTHWARD INTO NEW             
ENGLAND...THEN NAM IS THE SLOWEST AND FURTHEST OFFSHORE...AND THE               
UKMET AND ECMWF ARE IN BETWEEN. THIS RESULTS IN QUITE A BIT OF                  
SPREAD FOR THE MODEL WIND FCSTS. MOSTLY WENT CLOSE TO THE NAM...BUT             
ADJUSTED DIRECTIONS/SPEEDS SOMEWHAT TO FIT BETTER WITH THE OTHER                
MODELS AND SURROUNDING OFFICES. RESULT IS NE FLOW DEVELOPING TODAY...           
THEN INCREASING TONIGHT AND REMAINING RATHER BRISK ON MON. THE                  
PERSISTENT NE FLOW WILL CAUSE SEAS TO BUILD REACHING 6 TO 9 FT MON              
AND MON NIGHT. FLOW GRADUALLY BACKS TO NORTH ON TUE AS THE LOW                  
PASSES BY...LIKELY JUST TO THE EAST OF THE LOCAL WATERS. THIS WILL              
ALLOW SEAS TO SUBSIDE. BASED ON THE ABOVE FCST...NO CHANGES ARE                 
NEEDED TO THE EXISTING SCA FOR THE OCEAN ZONES...WHICH RUNS THROUGH             
TUE AFTERNOON.                                                                  
LONG PERIOD OF BRISK NE FLOW WILL CAUSE WATER TO PILE UP IN WESTERN             
LONG ISLAND...AS WELL AS IN NY HARBOR AND THE BACK BAYS OF THE LONG             
ISLAND SOUTH SHORE. FORTUNATELY ASTRONOMICAL TIDES ARE RELATIVELY               
LOW FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS...AND 2.5 TO 3 FOOT DEPARTURES WILL             
BE NEEDED TO REACH MINOR COASTAL FLOODING THRESHOLDS. CURRENT                   
GUIDANCE SUGGESTS THAT WE WILL PROBABLY REMAIN BELOW THOSE LEVELS               
AT MOST LOCATIONS...AND ANY COASTAL FLOODING WOULD BE ISOLATED AND              
MINOR AT WORST. GREATEST POSSIBILITY FOR ANY FLOODING THAT MIGHT                
OCCUR WOULD LIKELY BE DURING THE MON AFTERNOON AND LATE MON NIGHT               
HIGH TIDE CYCLES. WILL NEED TO CONTINUE MONITORING OVER THE NEXT                
COUPLE OF DAYS.

EXPECTED STORM TRACK SHIFTS THE AXIS OF HEAVIEST QPF OVER THE NEXT              
48 TO 60 HOURS EASTWARD OVER CONNECTICUT AND LONG ISLAND. THIS IS               
THE AREA OVER WHICH ALL MODELS CURRENTLY AGREE WILL RECEIVE 1 TO                
1.5 INCHES OF RAIN. TO THE WEST...MODELS GENERALLY AGREE ON 0.75                
TO 1 INCH OF RAIN OVER THE CURRENT FLOOD WATCH AREA. THIS IS MUCH               
LESS (BY A FACTOR OF 75 TO 100 PERCENT) THAN CURRENT 12-24 HOUR                 
FLASH FLOOD GUIDANCE OVER NORTHEAST NEW JERSEY AND THE LOWER

LONG ISLAND IS ALSO 75 TO 100 PERCENT BELOW FLASH FLOOD

.UPDATE...STRONG 900MB INVERSION STILL HANGING ON OVER INDIANA THIS             
MORNING.  H85 RIDGE MAX IS STILL SLIGHTLY TO OUR WEST WHICH IS                  
CONTRIBUTING TO THE LACK OF CLEARING.  RUC SHOWING PLENTY OF                    
MOISTURE BELOW 900MB AND UNTIL THE RIDGE MAX PASSES TO OUR EAST                 
SUBSIDENCE WONT BE STRONG ENOUGH TO FORCE THE INVERSION TO THE                  
GROUND.  THE FEW BREAKS IN THE CLOUDS HAVE BEGUN TO FILL IN WHICH               
WILL ALSO LIMIT DAYTIME HEATING.  WITH LITTLE TEMPERATURE ADVECTION             
BELOW 900MB WOULD NOT EXPECT CLOUDS TO BREAK UP UNTIL THE 18Z-21Z               
TIMEFRAME.  BECAUSE OF THIS WILL SHAVE A DEGREE OR TWO OFF OF

.PREV DISCUSSION...MAIN WEATHER FACTOR TO WORK WITH TODAY WILL BE               
THE CLOUDS. THIS MORNING SATELLITE PICTURES AND SURFACE OBSERVATIONS            
SHOW A LINGERING AREA OF LOW CLOUDS OVER MOST OF CENTRAL INDIANA.               
THESE CLOUDS ARE BEING TRAPPED OVER THE AREA BY AN INVERSION. ONCE              
THE INVERSION BREAKS MID TO LATE MORNING THE CLOUDS SHOULD MOVE OUT.            
THE NEXT CLOUD PROBLEM IS AN AREA OF CI THAT IS OVER ILLINOIS MOVING            
EAST. ONLY THE GFS HAS THIS MOVING INTO INDIANA. WITH ITS PRESENT               
STEADY MOVEMENT THIS LOOKS GOOD. THE PROBLEM WILL BE WHEN IT DOES               
MOVE IN HOW DENSE WILL IT BE. AT THE PRESENT TIME IT LOOKS THIN                 
ENOUGH TO GO MOSTLY SUNNY. THE CLOUDS DURING THE MORNING WILL SLOW              
THE TEMPERATURE INCREASE SOME ALONG WITH ANY CLOUDS THIS AFTERNOON.             
SO WILL GO TOWARD THE LOWER GUIDANCE HIGHS.                                     
HIGH PRESSURE WILL CONTINUE TO BUILD INTO INDIANA DURING THE DAY.               
THE GFS CONTINUES TO SHOW MID AND HIGH LEVEL MOISTURE OVER INDIANA              
TONIGHT. WILL GO AT LEAST PARTLY CLOUDY DUE TO THE MOISTURE. WITH               
THE CLOUDS WILL KEEP MIN TEMPERATURES A LITTLE HIGHER.                          
THE HIGH WILL MOVE EAST OF INDIANA ON MONDAY. THIS WILL ALLOW A WEAK            
COLD FRONT TO MOVE INTO THE STATE. 850 MB TEMPS SHOW A WARM UP FOR              
PART OF THE DAY. WILL GO NEAR GUIDANCE FORECAST. DUE TO LACK OF                 
MOISTURE WILL NOT MENTION ANY RAIN WITH THIS FRONT.

STRATOCUMULUS CLOUDS ACRS THE FCST AREA.  LOCAL RAOBS AND RUC40

TIME EXITING THE REGION AS WINDS WILL BE FAIRLY LIGHT OVERHEAD.  AS             
A RESULT...THE CLEARING OF THE CLOUDS WILL HAVE TO DEPEND ON THE                
LATE AUTUMN SUNSHINE IN ORDER TO ERODE THE CLOUD DECK.  WILL UPDATE

SLOWLY EAST THIS MORNING. WIDESPREAD LOW CLOUDS TRAPPED BENEATH                 
INVERSION BASED AROUND 925MB TO THE EAST OF THE RIDGE SHOULD LINGER             
OVER THE AREA PAST DAYBREAK WITH A GRADUAL CLEARING FROM W-E DURING             
THE DAY AS THE RIDGE MOVES INTO WRN OH BY 00Z MON. LOWERED MAXES A              
FEW DEGS FM PREVIOUS FCST IN AGREEMENT WITH COOLER LATEST MAV/MET

AT LEAST PART OF THE DAY. SKIES SHOULD BE MOSTLY CLEAR THIS EVE AND             
WINDS LIGHT AS THE RIDGE MOVES SLOWLY EAST OF THE AREA. A SHRTWV                
OVER THE FOUR CORNERS THIS MORNING IS EXPECTED TO LIFT NE TO THE MS             
VLY BY MON MORNING. THIS WILL INCREASE THE GRADIENT WITH SOME                   
INCREASE IN HIGH CLOUDS LATE OVER WRN PORTIONS OF THE AREA. HWVR,               
SHOULD BE DECENT RADIATIONAL COOLING EARLY ACROSS THE ENTIRE AREA

WEAKENING FRONTAL BOUNDARY ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES...BUT FORCING WILL            
DECREASE WITH TIME AND WHAT MSTR EXISTS WITH IT WILL REMAIN MAINLY              
NORTH OF THE AREA. POPS WERE PULLED BY DAY SHIFT AND WILL CONTINUE              
WITH THIS THINKING AS AT BEST A SPRINKLE OR 2 MAY OCCUR.                        
THEN ATTENTION TURNS TO SYSTEM ADVERTISED TO ARRIVE SOMETIME IN THE             
TUES NGT/WEDS TIME FRAME. WIDE VARIETY OF SOLUTIONS COMING OUT OF

NAM OVER CNTRL IL...GFS OVER W TENNESSEE...AND UKMET OVER N                     
LOUISIANA. ALL SOLUTIONS HAVE MANY IMPLICATIONS ON AMOUNT OF PRECIP             
AND CONVECTIVE POTENTIAL. GENERAL CONSENSUS OF MOST MODELS HAVING               
THE LOW TRACK OVER OR SOUTH OF THE AREA WOULD SUGGEST MINIMAL                   
THUNDER CHANCES...BUT INCREASING CHCS FOR MEASURABLE QPF. CURRENTLY             
HAVE LOW CHC POPS IN FOR TUES EVE THEN HIGH CHC TUES NGT INTO WEDS.             
WAS TEMPTED TO INCREASE TO LIKELY ON WEDS BUT IF FURTHER SOUTH                  
SOLUTIONS VERIFY...MAIN PRECIP MAY NOT ARRIVE TILL WEDS NGT/THURS SO            
WILL LEAVE THINGS ALONE. ALL PRECIP THROUGH THURS SHOULD BE IN THE              
LIQUID FORM...WITH SNOW BECOMING MORE OF AN ISSUE ON THE BACK SIDE              
OF THE SYSTEM. BY 00Z FRI MODELS DO COME INTO SLIGHTLY BETTER                   
AGREEMENT ON THE SFC LOW SOMEWHERE FROM NE LK HURON TO LAKE ERIE OR             
NW OHIO. ANOTHER TROUGH WILL MOVE IN ACROSS SOUTHERN CANADA LATE                
THURS AND ALLOW FOR THE SYSTEM OVER THE GREAT LAKES TO BE PULLED                
NORTH ENDING PRECIP CHANCES JUST AS THE COLDER AIR ARRIVES. ANOTHER             
FRONT MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS APPROACHING TROUGH IN THE FRI TIME            
FRAME. ENOUGH MODEL ISSUES THAT FAR OUT TO PRECLUDE PRECIP MENTION.             
IF SCENARIO WORKED OUT WOULD BE SHOT AT SOMEWHAT COLDER AIR ARRIVING            
WITH THIS FRONT...BUT NOT SO SURE THIS WILL OCCUR. PLENTY OF TIME TO            
MONITOR SO WILL KEEP THURS NGT THROUGH SATURDAY DRY WITH TEMPS NEAR

THE SOUTHERN TIP OF LAKE HURON OVERNIGHT HAS OVERALL WEAKENED BUT               
IS STILL DISCERNIBLE IN AVAILABLE RADAR IMAGERY. HARDER TO EXPLAIN              
IS THE DEGREE OF CLEARING LATE IN THE OVERNIGHT OVER PARTS OF                   
SOUTHEAST MI. BELIEVE THAT THE THINNING/CLEARING IS RELATED AT                  
LEAST IN PART TO RELATIVE SUBSIDENCE BETWEEN THE CONVERGENCE                    
PLUMES ASSOCIATED WITH THE LAKE EFFECT BANDS. THIS MAY ALSO                     
EXPLAIN WHY SOME AREAS ARE TENDING TO FILL BACK IN AGAIN WITH                   
CLOUDS AS THE LAKE EFFECT/CONVERGENCE WEAKENS. THIS WEAKENING                   
TREND IS STILL SUPPORTED BY THE 06Z GFS/NAM AND LATEST RUC.                     
SO...FOR THE TAFS...THE ONLY ISSUE IS IN GETTING RID OF THE LOW                 
CLOUDS. MOST MODEL SOUNDINGS DO LOOK TO WIDEN THE LOW LEVEL

TONIGHT.                                                                        
EXCEPT AS NOTED BELOW...OVERALL DESCENT SEEN IN OMEGA FIELDS TODAY

DIVERGENCE/SUBSIDENCE.                                                          
850 TO 500 MB MOISTURE RATHER MEAGER THROUGH TONIGHT. INCREASING                
CIRRUS...THOUGH...LIKELY TO BE SEEN MAINLY LATE TONIGHT BEHIND RIDGE            
ALOFT. LOW LEVEL MOISTURE...AS AT 925 MB...EXPECTED TO DIMINISH                 
TODAY.                                                                          
THE EXCEPTION TO NO WEATHER IS THE OVERNIGHT SPRINKLES AND FLURRIES             
SEEN OVER MUCH OF THE FORECAST AREA...LARGELY RELATED TO LAKE EFFECT            
FROM NORTH TO NORTHEAST FLOW OFF OF LAKE HURON. DELTA TS INTO THE               
LOWER TEENS EARLIER IN THE NIGHT SHOULD LESSEN STEADILY THIS MORNING            
AS 850 MB TEMPERATURES WARM BEHIND THE BRIEF THERMAL TROUGH. NAM/RUC            
AND GFS SHOW GOOD LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE...TENDING TO MAXIMIZE                   
AROUND 06Z...ALSO ON THE WANE THIS MORNING. NAM ALSO SHOWS MODEST               
950 MB OMEGA LIFT...MAINLY IN THE THUMB...WANING THIS MORNING. WILL             
CARRY MENTION OF SPRINKLES OR FLURRIES INTO THE MORNING FOR MOST OF             
THE AREA...THEN RIDGE OVERHEAD THIS AFTERNOON SHOULD KILL OFF ANY               
MORE POSSIBILITY OF THIS TRACE PRECIPITATION. PERSISTENCE OF                    
SPRINKLES...AS OPPOSED TO FLURRIES...SEEMS RELATED TO SHALLOW DEPTH             
OF MOISTURE AND THUS VERY POOR ICE NUCLEATION POTENTIAL...AS PER                
MODEL SOUNDINGS.                                                                
AS FOR CLOUD COVER TODAY...MOST MODELS INDICATE LESSENING BY                    
AFTERNOON...AND WILL SO INDICATE. SATELLITE IMAGERY ALREADY SHOWING             
SOME THIN SPOTS/HOLES IN THE CLOUD COVER. DAYTIME MIXING SHOULD AID             
IN CLOUD COVER DECREASE.                                                        
LONG TERM...MONDAY THROUGH SUNDAY                                               
CONFIDENCE IS INCREASING FOR A POTENT STORM TO IMPACT THE REGION FOR            
MID WEEK...HOWEVER...PREDICTABILITY OF THE EVENTUAL UPPER FLOW                  
REGIME ACROSS THE CONUS REMAINS BELOW AVERAGE. SATELLITE DERIVED                
WINDS IN THE EASTERN PACIFIC AS OF 03Z WERE AVERAGING AROUND 120KTS             
WITH A DEVELOPING JET STREAK APPROACHING 150KTS EAST OF 150W                    
IN BETWEEN 40-50N.  GLOBAL MODELS SEEM TO HAVE INITIALIZED THE                  
PACIFIC JET ORIENTATION AND GENERAL STRENGTH AS THE ECMWF APPEARS TO            
HAVE PICKED UP THE JET STREAK EARLIER THAN THE OTHER OPERATIONAL                
GLOBAL MODELS.  THIS FEATURE(S) WILL BE OUR FORECAST CHALLENGE FOR              
THIS UPCOMING WEEK.                                                             
BEGINNING WITH MONDAY...LONG WAVE TROUGH CURRENTLY PROGRESSING                  
THROUGH THE INTERMOUNTAIN WEST AND EMBEDDED SHORT WAVE ACROSS THE               
FOUR CORNERS WILL LIFT NORTHEAST THROUGH THE DAY AS SHORT WAVE RIDGE            
AND SURFACE HIGH PRECEDING IT SLIDES FURTHER EAST.  WHILE A GOOD                
AERIAL COVERAGE OF PRECIP IS EXPECTED TO ACCOMPANY THIS FEATURE                 
INITIALLY...DECREASING THERMAL GRADIENT IN THE LOW-MID LEVELS ACROSS            
THE MID-UPPER MISSISSIPPI RIVER VALLEY AND BEST UPPER SUPPORT WILL              
LIFT INTO CANADA AND REDUCE THE CHANCES OF PRECIP FOR THE CWA.  IN              
FACT...HARD TO FIND A MODEL THAT PRINTS ANY QPF ACROSS THE CWA.  DO             
NOT FEEL COMPELLED TO REMOVE POPS COMPLETELY AND WILL RETAIN THE                
CURRENT FORECAST WITH 20% POPS ALONG AND NORTH OF 8-MILE WITH 30%               
POPS AROUND THE TRI CITIES.  THEN A BRIEF RESPITE MONDAY NIGHT INTO             
TUESDAY AS WEAK SURFACE HIGH AND SHORT WAVE RIDGE AXIS MOVES ACROSS             
THE GREAT LAKES.  HOWEVER... LOW LEVEL MOISTURE REMAINS RATHER HIGH             
AS OBSERVED IN THE GFS/NAM/WRF-HEMI SOUNDINGS HENCE THE PERCENT                 
CLOUD COVER WILL REMAIN RATHER HIGH THROUGH EARLY TUESDAY MORNING.              
POTENT PACIFIC JET COMES ASHORE AND DIVES SOUTHEAST INTO THE THE                
FOUR CORNERS REGION TUESDAY NIGHT WITH SURFACE LOW DEVELOPING IN THE            
VICINITY OF THE PANHANDLE OF TEXAS.  DEPENDING ON HOW THIS PATTERN              
UNFOLDS ACROSS THE CONUS...TRENDS IN THE GLOBAL MODELS SUGGEST UPPER            
PATTERN QUICKLY BECOMES NEGATIVELY TILTED AS GULF OF MEXICO MOISTURE            
ADVANCES NORTHWARD WEDNESDAY-WEDNESDAY NIGHT.  CROSS SECTIONS FROM              
THE GFS SHOW A RATHER POTENT PETTERSSEN 2-D FGEN LAYER BETWEEN                  
850-700MB WITH AN INCREASED SLANTWISE INSTABILITY (INCLUDING DEPTH)             
JUST ABOVE THIS LAYER AS SUGGESTED IN THE LOWERING EPV/S ACROSS THE             
CWA.  COULD SEE A BAND(S) OF HEAVY RAIN AND THUNDER WEDNESDAY                   
AFTERNOON INTO THURSDAY MORNING...THIS WILL NEED TO MONITORED                   
CLOSELY AS PWATS ARE EXPECTED TO CLIMB IN EXCESS OF 1 INCH.                     
LOW BECOMES VERTICALLY STACKED ACROSS THE STATE THROUGH THURSDAY                
WITH A SLOW RETREAT NORTHWARD THROUGH THE END OF THIS WEEK.  850MB              
TEMPS DROP BACK TOWARD THE NEGATIVE TERRITORY AND PERHAPS EVEN LOWER            
INTO THE WEEKEND AS UPPER FLOW AMPLIFIES TOWARD A RIDGE ACROSS THE              
ROCKIES AND A TROUGH ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES/MIDDLE ATLANTIC COAST.              
THIS SETS THE STAGE FOR THE CHANCE OF SNOW SHOWERS FROM THE                     
COLD/MOIST CYCLONIC FLOW AND CONTRIBUTIONS FROM LAKE MICHIGAN.  WILL            
GO LOWER THAN MEX NUMBERS AND ADD POPS FOR SNOW THROUGH AT LEAST

CLOUDINESS HUGGING THE TENNESSEE BORDER AREAS...AND SOME OF THE                 
INTERIOR MOUNTAINS BUT MOST OF THE NON-TERRAIN AREAS MOSTLY CLEAR.              
MORNING OBSERVATIONS FROM THE MOUNTAINS REVEALED A LIGHT SNOW FELL

THE SATURATED LAYER IS NOT VERY DEEP AND THE 85H TEMPERATURES                   
SHOULD BE RISING THROUGH THE AFTERNOON. SATELLITE TRENDS REVEAL                 
SLOW EROSION OF THE ANCHORED CLOUD DECK HAS ALREADY BEGUN...BUT                 
THE LOW CLOUDS MAY HANG ON FOR MOST OF THE AFTERNOON. SO...ANY                  
LINGERING SNOW AT THIS HOUR SHOULD TRANSITION TO ALL RAIN BY EARLY              
AFTERNOON. NEITHER RUC NOR 06Z NAM/WRF PRODUCES MUCH MORE                       
ADDITIONAL PRECIPITATION FOR THE TENNESSEE BORDER AREAS. WE WILL                
HOLD ON TO ISOLATED RAIN SHOWERS FOR THE NORTHERN                               
MOUNTAINS...HOWEVER...THIS AFTERNOON.                                           
MOUNTAIN WINDS HAVE GUSTED AS HIGH AS 40 TO 45 MPH SO FAR; KAVL                 
JUST HAD A WIND GUST TO 43 MPH. THE BETTER MIXING HAS ALSO                      
RESULTED IN STRONG GUSTS FOR THE FOOTHILLS AND PIEDMONT; KCLT                   
RECENTLY GUSTED TO 31 MPH. WITH TIME...THE WINDS THROUGH THE                    
ATMOSPHERIC COLUMN SHOULD WANE...AND ANY RESIDUAL COLD ADVECTION                
WILL BE REPLACED BY WARM ADVECTION. FOR NOW...WILL NOT PLAN ANY                 
CHANGES TO CURRENT WIND ADVISORY/LAKE WIND ADVISORY PRODUCTS FOR                
THE HIGHER TERRAIN. BASED ON CHANGES WE MADE TO THE                             
FOOTHILL/PIEDMONT WINDS FOR THE AFTERNOON...WILL HAVE TO CARVE OUT              
SOME OF TEH LARGER ZONE GROUPINGS TO INCREASE TO BREEZY BUT WILL                
HOLD OFF ON ANY EXTENSION OF THE LAKE WIND ADVISORY AND MONITOR

EAST MONDAY NIGHT AS WEAK SHORT WAVE MOVES THRU INTRODUCING NEAR                
ZONAL FLOW AND MORE WEAK SHORT WAVES FOR TUESDAY. STRONG WAVES DIG              
A TROF OVER THE CENTRAL PART OF THE COUNTRY TUESDAY NIGHT WHILE

FOR MONDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING...BUT LOW LEVELS VERY DRY. THE DRY             
LOW LEVELS CONTINUE TUESDAY...BUT COULD BE QUITE A BIT OF CIRRUS                
STREAMING EASTWARD SO PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES. NEXT SYSTEM APPROACHES               
THE AREA TUESDAY NIGHT. NAM BRINGS PRECIP TO THE MOUNTAINS...WHILE              
GFS KEEPS IT TO THE WEST. SHORT RANGE ENSEMBLES SHOW SOME PRECIP                
POSSIBLE OVER THE MOUNTAINS SIMILAR TO NAM...BUT PLUME DIAGRAMS SHOW            
MANY DRY MEMBERS. MEMBERS SHOWING PRECIP...EXCEPT FOR ONE...HAVE                
ONLY LIGHT AMOUNTS. CANADIAN IS EVEN SLOWER THAN THE GFS. THEREFORE             
HAVE DECIDED TO SLOW PRECIP WITH ONLY CHC TO SLIGHT CHC OVER THE                
MOUNTAINS.

LEAVE POP AS IS. WILL HAVE TO WATCH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS                     
SYSTEM. GFS SHOWS QUITE A BIT OF FORCING WITH HIGH SHEAR. FORECAST

MAIN AVIATION CONCERN FOR THIS TAF PACKAGE IS HOW FAST PESKY MVFR               
STRATOCUMULUS DECK WILL ERODE.  STRATOCUMULUS DECK WAS NEARLY STUCK             
ACRS THE REGION AS A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE FROM THE SFC THROUGH 850            
MB WAS PROVIDING FOR FAIRLY LIGHT WIND REGIME THROUGH THE LAYER.                
AS A RESULT...ONLY DAYTIME SUNSHINE WILL BE THE KEY FACTOR ON                   
DISSIPATING THE DECK.  LATEST VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGERY WAS                     
INDICATING THAT THIS INDEED WAS OCCURRING ACRS THE WEST.  WILL ONLY             
EMPLOY A SCATTERED DECK AT KSBN WITH TAF ISSUANCE.  FARTHER                     
EAST...THE EROSION PROCESS HAS BEEN MUCH SLOWER.  THEREFORE...WILL

FOR TONIGHT...SFC RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL MOVE SLOWLY EAST.  A              
WEAK COLD FRONT ACRS THE PLAINS THIS AFTN WILL MOVE INTO THE WRN                
GREAT LAKES BY LATE MONDAY AFTN.  AS THIS FEATURE APPROACHES...MID

SATELLITE IMAGERY THIS MORNING CONTINUES TO SHOW PLENTY OF                      
STRATOCUMULUS CLOUDS ACRS THE FCST AREA.  LOCAL RAOBS AND RUC40                 
SOUNDINGS INDICATE THAT THIS MOISTURE LAYER IS NEAR 900 MB...AND IT             
IS TRAPPED BENEATH A STRONG INVERSION.  WITH A RIDGE OF HIGH                    
PRESSURE FCST TO MOVE ACRS THE AREA TODAY...CLOUDS WILL HAVE A HARD             
TIME EXITING THE REGION AS WINDS WILL BE FAIRLY LIGHT OVERHEAD.  AS             
A RESULT...THE CLEARING OF THE CLOUDS WILL HAVE TO DEPEND ON THE                
LATE AUTUMN SUNSHINE IN ORDER TO ERODE THE CLOUD DECK.  WILL UPDATE             
THE ZONES/GRIDS TO KEEP MOSTLY CLOUDY CONDITIONS LONGER THROUGH THE             
DAY...BUT EVENTUALLY HOPING THAT SKIES BECOME PARTLY CLOUDY LATE.               
WILL ALSO TWEAK HIGH TEMPERATURES DOWN SOME DUE TO THE LINGERING                
CLOUD COVER.

SLOWLY EAST THIS MORNING. WIDESPREAD LOW CLOUDS TRAPPED BENEATH                 
INVERSION BASED AROUND 925MB TO THE EAST OF THE RIDGE SHOULD LINGER             
OVER THE AREA PAST DAYBREAK WITH A GRADUAL CLEARING FROM W-E DURING

FEW DEGS FM PREVIOUS FCST IN AGREEMENT WITH COOLER LATEST MAV/MET               
FCSTS WHICH SEEM REASONABLE GIVEN WK MIXING AND LINGERING LOW CLOUDS            
AT LEAST PART OF THE DAY. SKIES SHOULD BE MOSTLY CLEAR THIS EVE AND

OVER THE FOUR CORNERS THIS MORNING IS EXPECTED TO LIFT NE TO THE MS             
VLY BY MON MORNING. THIS WILL INCREASE THE GRADIENT WITH SOME                   
INCREASE IN HIGH CLOUDS LATE OVER WRN PORTIONS OF THE AREA. HWVR,

HIGH PRESSURE WILL SLIDE EAST ON MONDAY. MODELS CONTINUE TO BRING A             
WEAKENING FRONTAL BOUNDARY ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES...BUT FORCING WILL            
DECREASE WITH TIME AND WHAT MSTR EXISTS WITH IT WILL REMAIN MAINLY              
NORTH OF THE AREA. POPS WERE PULLED BY DAY SHIFT AND WILL CONTINUE              
WITH THIS THINKING AS AT BEST A SPRINKLE OR 2 MAY OCCUR.                        
THEN ATTENTION TURNS TO SYSTEM ADVERTISED TO ARRIVE SOMETIME IN THE             
TUES NGT/WEDS TIME FRAME. WIDE VARIETY OF SOLUTIONS COMING OUT OF

NAM OVER CNTRL IL...GFS OVER W TENNESSEE...AND UKMET OVER N                     
LOUISIANA. ALL SOLUTIONS HAVE MANY IMPLICATIONS ON AMOUNT OF PRECIP             
AND CONVECTIVE POTENTIAL. GENERAL CONSENSUS OF MOST MODELS HAVING               
THE LOW TRACK OVER OR SOUTH OF THE AREA WOULD SUGGEST MINIMAL                   
THUNDER CHANCES...BUT INCREASING CHCS FOR MEASURABLE QPF. CURRENTLY             
HAVE LOW CHC POPS IN FOR TUES EVE THEN HIGH CHC TUES NGT INTO WEDS.             
WAS TEMPTED TO INCREASE TO LIKELY ON WEDS BUT IF FURTHER SOUTH                  
SOLUTIONS VERIFY...MAIN PRECIP MAY NOT ARRIVE TILL WEDS NGT/THURS SO            
WILL LEAVE THINGS ALONE. ALL PRECIP THROUGH THURS SHOULD BE IN THE              
LIQUID FORM...WITH SNOW BECOMING MORE OF AN ISSUE ON THE BACK SIDE              
OF THE SYSTEM. BY 00Z FRI MODELS DO COME INTO SLIGHTLY BETTER                   
AGREEMENT ON THE SFC LOW SOMEWHERE FROM NE LK HURON TO LAKE ERIE OR             
NW OHIO. ANOTHER TROUGH WILL MOVE IN ACROSS SOUTHERN CANADA LATE                
THURS AND ALLOW FOR THE SYSTEM OVER THE GREAT LAKES TO BE PULLED                
NORTH ENDING PRECIP CHANCES JUST AS THE COLDER AIR ARRIVES. ANOTHER             
FRONT MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS APPROACHING TROUGH IN THE FRI TIME            
FRAME. ENOUGH MODEL ISSUES THAT FAR OUT TO PRECLUDE PRECIP MENTION.

DAYS 1-2...                                                                     
THE MAIN FORECAST CONCERN FOR THE SHORT TERM ARE THE CHANCES FOR                
PRECIP TONIGHT AND TUESDAY AFTERNOON, ALONG WITH TEMPERATURES.                  
THE UPPER TROUGH AXIS THAT WAS OVER THE FOUR CORNERS REGION AT 12Z              
HAS PROGRESSED INTO COLORADO, AND SHOULD CONTINUE TO MOVE ACROSS                
THE PLAINS TONIGHT. THE TROUGH HAS BROUGHT PLENTY OF UVV, AND                   
LIGHT ECHOES HAVE SPREAD ACROSS OUR RADAR SCOPE IN THE LAST FEW                 
HOURS. HOWEVER, TEMPERATURE DEWPOINT SPREADS ARE STILL GREATER                  
THAN 20 DEGREES AT THE SFC IN MOST LOCATIONS, AND THE 850MB OBS                 
FROM THIS MORNING SHOW SIMILAR PATHETIC MOISTURE. MOST OF THE                   
ACTIVITY HAS BEEN IN THE MID LEVELS AND LITTLE IF ANY IS REACHING               
THE GROUND. TEMPS SHOULD BE COOLING OFF TONIGHT THOUGH, AND RUC                 
MODEL SOUNDINGS ARE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT OUR NORTHERN LOCATIONS                     
GETTING ENOUGH MOISTURE IN THE COLUMN FOR SOMETHING TO REACH THE                
GROUND. WILL KEEP SLIGHT/LOW CHANCE POPS GOING FOR LIGHT RAIN                   
UNTIL MIDNIGHT, WHEN THE TROUGH AXIS AND SFC FRONT SHOULD BE PAST               
US.                                                                             
CLOUDS SHOULD START TO BREAK UP LATER TONIGHT AS THE TROUGH AXIS                
MOVES EAST AND SUBSIDENCE SETS IN. WITH THE BREAKS IN CLOUDS,                   
DIMINISHING WINDS, AND LOW DEWPOINTS, LOWS TONIGHT SHOULD DROP                  
DOWN INTO THE UPPER 20S TO LOW 30S. THE LEE SFC TROUGH SHOULD                   
RAPIDLY RE-DEVELOP TOMORROW, WITH SOUTHERLY WINDS. THE MODELS HAVE              
STRONG RH AT HIGH LEVELS THOUGH, SO SOME CIRRUS AGAIN LOOKS                     
PROBABLE. HIGHS IN THE 50S CONTINUE TO SEEM REASONABLE, SO ONLY                 
MADE MINOR TWEAKS. WINDS SHOULD STAY UP SOME MONDAY NIGHT, KEEPING              
TEMPS FAIRLY MIXED AND A BIT WARMER THAN TONIGHT. WARMING SHOULD                
CONTINUE INTO TUESDAY WITH 850MB TEMPS RETURNING INTO THE LOWER TO              
MID TEENS C. CONTINUED WITH HIGHS IN THE UPPER 50S TO LOW 60S. THE              
NEXT UPPER TROUGH WILL MOVE OUT INTO THE NORTHERN PLAINS BY                     
TUESDAY, WITH ANOTHER PACIFIC FRONTAL BOUNDARY MOVING INTO THE                  
WESTERN PLAINS BY LATE IN THE DAY. THE LACK OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE               
WILL AGAIN BE A FACTOR, SO CONTINUED TO KEEP VERY LOW POPS OF 10-               
15 FOR TUESDAY AFTERNOON FOR NOW.                                               
DAYS 3-7...                                                                     
FORECAST CHALLENGE THIS PERIOD IS THE EXPECTED SENSIBLE WEATHER FROM            
A DEEPENING MID-WEEK SYSTEM.  BASED ON EXPECTED FORCING FROM THE                
TROPICS AND RESULTING AMPLIFICATION DOWNSTREAM...THE SYSTEM THAT                
CURRENTLY IS IN THE NORTHEAST PACIFIC SHOULD DIG INTO THE CENTRAL               
PLAINS LATE TUESDAY/WEDNESDAY.  HOWEVER, EVERYTHING WILL LIKELY BE              
TOO FAR EAST OF MY CWA TO OFFER MUCH HOPE FOR PCPN.  WIND AND                   
BRIEFLY COLDER TEMPS WILL BE IN THE OFFING THOUGH.  THEN A QUICK                
WARMUP IS EXPECTED LATE IN THE WEEK AS HEIGHTS BEGIN TO RISE AGAIN              
IN RESPONSE TO A FULL LATITUDE TROUGH THAT IS EXPECTED ALONG THE                
WEST COAST.

MID AND HIGH LEVEL MOISTURE SHOWING UP ON MOISTURE CHANNEL FROM THE

FOCUSING ON NORTHERN BORDER THROUGH 06Z. GFS BROADER WITH                       
PRECIPITATION WITH HIGHEST AMOUNTS NORTH OF INTERSTATE 70. MORNING              
SOUNDINGS WERE VERY DRY AND FORECAST SOUNDINGS SHOW THAT IT WILL                
TAKE A FEW HOURS TO SATURATE THE AIRMASS FOR PRECIPITATION. LIFT

MOVING THROUGH AXIS MOVING THROUGH AROUND 09Z. HAVE EXTENDED                    
PRECIPITATION CHANCES IN THE EASTERN COUNTIES THROUGH 09Z. CLOUDS

ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST TWO THIRDS OF THE CWA.                                     
FOR MONDAY...MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES WILL PREVAIL INTO THE EARLY

ADJUSTED HIGHS SLIGHTLY FROM PREVIOUS FORECAST WITH MID 50S.                    
MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY...MODELS STILL SHOW CONSIDERABLE                 
DISAGREEMENT ON EVOLUTION OF H5 PATTERN AND THE AFFECTS ON THE                  
SURFACE FEATURES. GFS IS STILL MUCH SLOWER AND DEEPER WITH                      
DEVELOPMENT OF H5 TROUGH. WHILE OTHER MODELS HAVE TRENDED                       
STRONGER...A WEAKER VERSION OF THE GFS IS STILL PREFERRED. AS UPPER             
FEATURE DIGS IN...SURFACE BOUNDARY/LOW WILL MOVE EAST ACROSS THE                
CENTRAL PLAINS...ACROSS THE TOP CWA TUESDAY NIGHT. NOT MUCH CHANGE              
MADE TO THE GOING FORECAST AS BEST CHANCES FOR PRECIP WILL BE ACROSS            
THE NORTHEAST CWA...IN CLOSER VICINITY TO DEEPENING SURFACE LOW. A              
QUICK CHANGE OVER TO SNOW LATE WEDS NIGHT/EARLY THU MORNING CANNOT              
BE RULED OUT...BUT STILL KEPT LIQUID PRECIP AS STILL PLENTY OF                  
DOUBT ON COLD AIR TIMING AND MAGNITUDE. PRECIP WILL COME TO AN                  
END BY EARLY WEDS MORNING. AS FAR AS TEMPERATURES GO...HIGHS ON                 
TUESDAY WILL BE IN THE UPPER 50S AND LOW 60S WITH GOOD WAA.                     
OFFSETTING THE WAA SOMEWHAT WILL BE  SIGNIFICANT MID CLOUD COVER.               
BY COMPARISON...STRONG CAA BEHIND SURFACE LOW WILL KEEP HIGHS ON

VERY SHALLOW...AND LATEST MODEL DATA INSISTS RAPID EROSION OF THIS              
MOISTURE THIS AFTERNOON. BUT GIVEN LATEST SATELLITE IMAGES AND

TREND BY A COUPLE OF HOURS. IT WILL LIKELY BE AFTER SUNSET BEFORE               
WE COMPLETELY SCOUR OUT THIS MOISTURE...BUT WE DO STILL EXPECT

AXIS PASSES TO THE EAST. ALSO LOWERED TEMPS ABOUT 3                             
DEGREES. BUT DO HOWEVER STILL EXPECT ENOUGH SUNSHINE AND WARM AIR               
ADVECTION TO ALLOW MIXING UP TO 925MB...WHICH WOULD LEAD TO

THE WEAK BUT PERSISTENT BANDING OF SPRINKLES/FLURRIES DETECTED                  
COMING OFF OF SAGINAW BAY AND ALSO CLIPPING AREAS PRIMARILY NEAR                
THE SOUTHERN TIP OF LAKE HURON OVERNIGHT HAS OVERALL WEAKENED BUT               
IS STILL DISCERNIBLE IN AVAILABLE RADAR IMAGERY. HARDER TO EXPLAIN              
IS THE DEGREE OF CLEARING LATE IN THE OVERNIGHT OVER PARTS OF                   
SOUTHEAST MI. BELIEVE THAT THE THINNING/CLEARING IS RELATED AT                  
LEAST IN PART TO RELATIVE SUBSIDENCE BETWEEN THE CONVERGENCE                    
PLUMES ASSOCIATED WITH THE LAKE EFFECT BANDS. THIS MAY ALSO                     
EXPLAIN WHY SOME AREAS ARE TENDING TO FILL BACK IN AGAIN WITH                   
CLOUDS AS THE LAKE EFFECT/CONVERGENCE WEAKENS. THIS WEAKENING                   
TREND IS STILL SUPPORTED BY THE 06Z GFS/NAM AND LATEST RUC.                     
SO...FOR THE TAFS...THE ONLY ISSUE IS IN GETTING RID OF THE LOW                 
CLOUDS. MOST MODEL SOUNDINGS DO LOOK TO WIDEN THE LOW LEVEL                     
TEMPERATURE/DEW POINT SPREAD ENOUGH TO SUGGEST LOSS OF THE

STRATOCUMULUS CLOUDS CONTINUE TO PERSIST DESPITE RIDGE AXIS                     
OVERHEAD. SOUNDINGS REVEAL THAT THE MOISTURE TRAPPED AT 925MB IS                
VERY SHALLOW...AND LATEST MODEL DATA INSISTS RAPID EROSION OF THIS              
MOISTURE THIS AFTERNOON. BUT GIVEN LATEST SATELLITE IMAGES AND                  
SURFACE OBSERVATIONS...WILL GO AHEAD AND SLOW DOWN THE CLEARING                 
TREND BY A COUPLE OF HOURS. IT WILL LIKELY BE AFTER SUNSET BEFORE               
WE COMPLETELY SCOUR OUT THIS MOISTURE...BUT WE DO STILL EXPECT                  
SKIES BECOMING PARTLY SUNNY DURING THE AFTERNOON...AS THE RIDGE                 
AXIS PASSES TO THE EAST. ALSO LOWERED TEMPS ABOUT 3                             
DEGREES. BUT DO HOWEVER STILL EXPECT ENOUGH SUNSHINE AND WARM AIR               
ADVECTION TO ALLOW MIXING UP TO 925MB...WHICH WOULD LEAD TO                     
TEMPERATURES IN THE LOW 40'S.

THE WEAK BUT PERSISTENT BANDING OF SPRINKLES/FLURRIES DETECTED                  
COMING OFF OF SAGINAW BAY AND ALSO CLIPPING AREAS PRIMARILY NEAR                
THE SOUTHERN TIP OF LAKE HURON OVERNIGHT HAS OVERALL WEAKENED BUT               
IS STILL DISCERNIBLE IN AVAILABLE RADAR IMAGERY. HARDER TO EXPLAIN              
IS THE DEGREE OF CLEARING LATE IN THE OVERNIGHT OVER PARTS OF                   
SOUTHEAST MI. BELIEVE THAT THE THINNING/CLEARING IS RELATED AT                  
LEAST IN PART TO RELATIVE SUBSIDENCE BETWEEN THE CONVERGENCE                    
PLUMES ASSOCIATED WITH THE LAKE EFFECT BANDS. THIS MAY ALSO                     
EXPLAIN WHY SOME AREAS ARE TENDING TO FILL BACK IN AGAIN WITH                   
CLOUDS AS THE LAKE EFFECT/CONVERGENCE WEAKENS. THIS WEAKENING                   
TREND IS STILL SUPPORTED BY THE 06Z GFS/NAM AND LATEST RUC.                     
SO...FOR THE TAFS...THE ONLY ISSUE IS IN GETTING RID OF THE LOW                 
CLOUDS. MOST MODEL SOUNDINGS DO LOOK TO WIDEN THE LOW LEVEL

.SHORT TERM...THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT                                           
PRIMARY FORECAST CONCERNS WERE WITH PRECIPITATION CHANCE/TYPE                   
TONIGHT INTO EARLY MONDAY AND AGAIN TUESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY NIGHT.               
INFRARED AND VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGERY INDICATED CONSIDERABLE MID               
AND HIGH LEVEL CLOUDS ADVANCING ACROSS THE UPPER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY.            
THIS WAS IN ADVANCE OF SURFACE COLD FRONT...WHICH EXTENDED ACROSS               
EASTERN DAKOTAS AND NEBRASKA INTO CENTRAL KANSAS. NARROW BAND OF                
PRECIPITATION NOTED ON REGIONAL RADAR FROM NORTHEAST TO WEST                    
CENTRAL MN. LATEST RUC SUPPORTS THIS PRECIPITATION AS ASSOCIATED                
WITH 700-500MB FRONTOGENESIS. WATER VAPOR IMAGERY INDICATED MID                 
LEVEL TROUGH EXTENDING NORTH-SOUTH ACROSS NATIONS MIDSECTION...WITH             
VIGOROUS WAVE IN THE TEXAS PANHANDLE AREA.                                      
12Z 12NOV06 MODEL SOLUTIONS HAD EXCELLENT CLUSTERING WITH RESPECT               
TO UPPER LEVEL SURFACE FEATURES AFFECTING THE FORECAST AREA TONIGHT             
INTO EARLY MONDAY. THEREFORE...FORECAST CONFIDENCE WAS HIGH THAT WE             
WILL RECEIVE A LIGHT PRECIPITATION EVENT. IN FACT...80-100 PERCENT              
OF GFS ENSEMBLES SUPPORTED PRECIPITATION DURING THE OVERNIGHT HOURS.            
IN ADDITION...NCEP SREF ENSEMBLE SUPPORTED HIGHER PROBABILITY OF                
SNOW IN NORTHERN PART OF THE FORECAST AREA...WITH BETTER PROBABILITY            
OF RAIN ELSEWHERE.                                                              
ANOTHER AND MORE VIGOROUS SYSTEM SHOULD IMPACT PARTS OF THE MIDWEST             
AT MIDWEEK. EVEN THOUGH MODEL DETAILS STILL DIFFER A BIT...THE                  
CONSENSUS APPEARS TO BE INCREASING TOWARD A SOLUTION OF A CLOSED                
500MB LOW DEVELOPING OVER THE MID MISSISSIPPI AND LOWER OHIO VALLEY             
BY WEDNESDAY. THIS SHOULD EFFECTIVELY KEEP THE HEAVIEST QPF SOUTH OF            
OUR FORECAST AREA....WHICH AGREED WITH NCEP SREF ENSEMBLE MEMBERS.              
THEREFORE...CONFIDENCE WAS INCREASING IN THIS AS A PROBABLE                     
SOLUTION...WHICH CURRENT DATA BASE ALREADY SUPPORTS.                            
TONIGHT INTO EARLY MONDAY...MODELS CONTINUED TO INDICATE A CONSISTENT           
SIGNAL WITH REGARD TO FRONTOGENETIC FORCING ASSOCIATED WITH UPPER               
LEVEL WAVE. NORTH-SOUTH CROSS SECTION INDICATED A NARROW BUT STRONG             
UPWARD VERTICAL MOTION SIGNAL SLIDES ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. THIS             
SUGGESTS PRECIPITATION MAY FALL STEADILY FOR AWHILE...ALTHOUGH                  
TRANSITORY NATURE OF THE FORCING SHOULD PRECLUDE HEAVY AMOUNTS PER              
MODEL QPF. BECAUSE OF CONSISTENTLY STRONG FORCING SIGNAL...                     
CONFIDENCE WAS HIGH TO INCREASE PRECIPITATION PROBABILITIES INTO                
CATEGORICAL VALUES.                                                             
ACCORDING TO NCEP SREF AND BUFKIT PRECIPITATION TYPE ALGORITHMS...              
PRECIPITATION PROBABILITIES FOR SNOW SHOULD BE BEST ACROSS NORTHERN             
MOST SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA. THEREFORE...TAILORED SNOW                   
AMOUNTS IN THE DATA BASE ACCORDINGLY...WITH AROUND 2 INCHES OF                  
ACCUMULATION IN NORTH CENTRAL WI AND AN INCH OR LESS ELSEWHERE.                 
TUESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY NIGHT...MORE VIGOROUS SYSTEM SHOULD IMPACT               
PARTS OF THE MIDWEST...ALTHOUGH BEST DYNAMICS APPEAR TO RESIDE SOUTH            
OF THE FORECAST AREA WHERE 500MB LOW CLOSES OFF. DIFFERENCES IN                 
STRENGTH OF FORCING NOTED BETWEEN NAM/WRF AND GFS...WITH GFS                    
STRONGER WITH REGARD TO DEEP LAYERED Q-G CONVERGENCE. IN ADDITION...            
SREF AND BUFKIT PRECIPITATION TYPE ALGORITHMS SUGGEST COULD BE RAIN             
AND/OR SNOW. ONLY CHANGE TO DATA BASE IN THIS TIME FRAME WAS TO TRIM            
EASTWARD EXTENT OF PRECIPITATION PROBABILITIES INTO CENTRAL WI ON               
TUESDAY.

BETTER CONSENSUS ON CLOSED 500MB LOW ADVANCING FROM OHIO VALLEY INTO            
EASTERN GREAT LAKES AND SOUTHEAST CANADA. THIS WAS CORROBORATED BY              
MREF ENSEMBLES. THUS...FORECAST CONFIDENCE INCREASING IN DETAILS                
WITHIN CURRENT DATA BASE...WHICH SUPPORTS DRY CONDITIONS.

THE DETAILS OF UPPER LEVEL AND SURFACE FEATURES. MREF ENSEMBLES                 
SUPPORTED A LESS AMPLIFIED FLOW...THEREFORE FORECAST CONFIDENCE WAS
