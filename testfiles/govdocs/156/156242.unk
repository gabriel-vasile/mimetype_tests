The objective of this White Paper is to report the
state of the science of measurement of drug abuse
treatment services outcome and to guide future
research efforts, after carefully considering
relevant clinical and health services research
experience. To this end, the Office of National
Drug Control Policy convened a panel of clinicians,
researchers, and administrators to guide the review
of past research and experience and to recommend
appropriate, reliable measures of treatment
effectiveness.

The talent, dedication, and thoughtful
participation of the panel members, the Treatment
Outcome Working Group, has provided a foundation
upon which clinicians, administrators, and
researchers can build future research and
demonstrate the benefits of effective treatment
approaches. ONDCP gratefully acknowledges all those
individuals who served this effort.

TREATMENT PROTOCOL EFFECTIVENESS STUDY

Drug dependence is a chronic, relapsing disorder
requiring specialized treatment. Breaking the cycle
of dependence is difficult at best, and hardcore
drug users often suffer extreme physical,
psychological, emotional, economic, and social
pain. In many ways, hardcore drug users are
isolated from society. Their addiction affects not
only them but also their families and friends as
well as the larger community (Office of National
Drug Control Policy [ONDCP], 1994).

Drug abuse treatment is the process of breaking an
individual's dependence on illicit drugs (e.g.,
heroin and cocaine) or licit drugs (e.g., alcohol
and prescription medications). Although the term
"drug abuse treatment" implies a single entity, in
fact it is a complex and variable network of
services tailored to meet the multiple needs of the
individual. Drug abuse treatment can take place in
hospitals; long-term residential treatment
programs; walk-in clinics; and counseling centers,
psychotherapists' offices, and church basements.
The choice of setting and the type of treatment
selected by or mandated for the individual depends
on such factors as the drug of addiction, history
of drug use and previous drug treatment, social
needs, criminal record, economic status, and
personality characteristics.

In both the drug treatment and in the treatment
research communities, there is broad consensus that
drug abuse treatment works. However, identifying
the most effective type of treatment and for whom
it is most effective continues to be a difficult
task. In this climate of managed care, it is more
important than ever to determine which treatment
will work best for which patient. The surest way to
make this determination is through rigorous
evaluation of treatment modalities, treatment
programs, and patient outcomes.

------------------------------

EVALUATING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF DRUG ABUSE
TREATMENT

Evaluating drug abuse treatment effectiveness
begins with an understanding of a number of other
factors related to the drug treatment modality or
program itself. These include knowing the array of
social, medical, and other services needed and
available to the drug user; understanding the
extent of drug use in a community; and
understanding the nature and progression of drug
addiction. The following sections discuss the
considerations for treatment evaluation,
definitions of effective drug abuse treatment, and
recommendations for improving drug abuse treatment.

Considerations for Treatment Evaluation

For most drug users, treatment includes a variety
of social and medical services necessary to aid
recovery. For hardcore drug users (i.e., those
suffering from continuing and increasing use, those
suffering from significant social and health
consequences, and those with a preoccupation with
obtaining drugs), drug treatment occurs within a
cluster of legal, social, and medical services
functioning in the community. Knowledge of the ways
in which these services are integrated and
delivered is important to determine what can be
expected from treatment and how to evaluate the
treatment provided.

Interventions required by the hardcore drug user
typically involve the criminal justice system, the
health care system, and the welfare and educational
systems. These, together with the drug abuse
treatment system, serve the drug user in the
process of treatment and recovery. These services
sometimes, but not always, are delivered in a
coordinated, supportive, and integrated fashion.
The greater the support given the drug user
throughout the process of treatment and long-term
recovery, the greater the likelihood of treatment
success. In reality, few communities claim fully
functional provision of services for all persons in
need, especially drug users. It is the degree of
function or dysfunction of the treatment and
service environment that must be understood to
formulate expectations and accurately evaluate drug
treatment effectiveness.

The extent and types of drug abuse in a community
also must be gauged accurately to evaluate the
array of required services. Ideally, the drug use
patterns, medical and social consequences, and
costs of drug abuse should be understood. In
addition, understanding the nature of addiction is
important to structuring and evaluating appropriate
treatment services.

Defining Effective Drug Abuse Treatment

Given what is known about the many social, medical,
and legal consequences of drug abuse, effective
drug abuse treatment should, at a minimum, be
integrated with criminal justice, social, and
medical services and lead to the following results
or outcomes:1

o Reduced use of the primary drug. -- Definitions
of treatment effectiveness include abstinence,
reduced time to relapse, reduced frequency of drug
use, and the reduced amount of the drug used in
total and during each episode of use.

o Improved functioning of drug users in terms of
employment. -- This includes increased number of
days worked and enrollment in training programs or
school, if needed.

o Improved educational status. -- This includes
increased school attendance and improved grades and
overall performance.

o Improved interpersonal relationships. -- This
includes relationships with family, friends, and
employers.

o Improved medical status and general improvement
in health. -- This is indicated by fewer
hospitalizations, doctor visits, and emergency room
visits.

o Improved legal status. -- This is indicated by
improvements in current legal status (e.g.,
probation, parole, or incarceration); fewer
arrests; fewer convictions; reductions in crimes
committed against self or others; and reductions in
property crimes committed.

o Improved mental health status. -- This includes
improved mood and cognition, reduced psychotic
states, improved personality traits, and reduced
need for mental health treatment.

o Improved noncriminal public safety factors. --
This includes reduced incidence of drug-related
fires, motor vehicle crashes, accidents, trauma to
self and others, and emergency room visits.

Among the indicators of treatment effectiveness
cited above, the following are frequently cited as
particularly important when determining treatment
effectiveness among hardcore drug users, regardless
of treatment model or client type:

o Reduced crime;
o Reduced drug use;
o Reduced domestic violence;
o Reduced behavior at risk for HIV (human
immunodeficiency virus) infection;
o Increased days of employment; and
o Positive changes in social values and networks.

Recommendations for Improving Drug Abuse Treatment

Effective drug abuse treatment requires a thorough
assessment and integration of the needs of every
individual entering treatment. Matching client
needs to the treatments and services available is
an essential component of treatment success. In the
short term, tailoring and integrating treatment and
related services to the needs and characteristics
of the individual and the specific drug that is
abused may be time-consuming and costly, but the
reduction of drug use and therefore the need for
further treatment will provide the biggest payoff
in the long term.

The following are areas in which many programs need
to improve to reach the goal of treatment success
for drug-abusing clients, including hardcore drug
users:

o Integration of services;
o Needs assessment;
o Efforts to engage clients in treatment;
o Client retention;
o Intensity of services;
o Cultural sensitivity in treatment programs;
o Staff training and retention;
o Data collection and management services; and
o Stable sources of funding.

In addition, the following elements of a
national-level program evaluation system would
allow thorough monitoring of treatment goals:

o A series of demonstration programs that closely
monitor service delivery over a specified period of
time;

o Selective, regionalized data collection to
identify changes in drug abuse patterns, such as
reductions in drug-related crimes and violence; and

o Development of nationwide policy indicators that
policymakers and treatment professionals will agree
represent minimum standards for treatment services.

Evaluation of drug abuse treatment must focus on
the effects of treatment, not on the drug problem
itself. Treatment goals must be realistic and
reflect what is possible, as opposed to what is
desirable, in treating a particular client.

Treatment research should focus on rates of
improvement as a result of drug abuse treatment,
rather than on simply documenting a "cure." The
degree of change expected should be realistic and
take into consideration the resources that are
available to an individual client.

Treatment evaluation should assess and document (1)
whether patients receive the treatment they need,
(2) whether (and which) other improvements are
needed in treatment, (3) whether the array of
consequences of drug abuse are reduced because of
the quality of treatment and other services
provided, and (4) whether the benefits outweigh the
costs of investing in the treatment system. Future
research efforts should focus on evaluating these
areas and on monitoring the ongoing needs of the
drug-using population.

The remainder of this review will present and
describe (1) what is known about effective
treatment, (2) what research reveals about which
treatments work best and for whom, and (3) how
treatment effectiveness is measured and the
limitations of such measurement. Although broad
research literature has been reviewed to prepare
this report, the emphasis is on treatment for the
hardcore drug user (i.e., those with criminal
histories and those with chronic, heavy use of
heroin and cocaine).

------------------------------

EVIDENCE FOR TREATMENT EFFECTIVENESS

Determining treatment effectiveness is a complex
endeavor that hinges on the interplay among many
client, program, and environmental factors. After
more than 25 years of evaluations of various types
of treatment programs, there are surprisingly few
national longitudinal or multisite studies that
offer universal, definitive "truths." However,
three national multiprogram studies and one
statewide study represent rigorous analysis of the
effectiveness of the major treatment modalities
(i.e., pharmacotherapies and the therapeutic
communities, inpatient treatment settings, and
outpatient treatment settings.)2 These studies are
known as the Drug Abuse Reporting Program (DARP),
the Treatment Outcome Prospective Study (TOPS), the
Drug Abuse Treatment Outcome Study (DATOS), and the
California Drug and Alcohol Treatment Assessment
(CALDATA). Although other studies of treatment
effectiveness have been conducted and reviewed in
preparation for this report, to date, these four
studies are the broadest in scope. They were
conducted with the largest populations in
treatment, representing the widest variety of
treatment programs, over the longest period of
time. These studies and their findings in support
of treatment effectiveness are described below.

Drug Abuse Reporting Program

DARP was conducted between 1969 and 1973 with
individuals admitted into publicly funded drug
treatment and for the first time provided a
nationwide, comprehensive assessment of treatment
effectiveness with a large client sample. It was
the first national followup study to assess
treatment effectiveness based on clients' outcomes
1 year after treatment. Major findings from the
DARP study include the following: (1) the three
major modalities -- outpatient drug-free, methadone
maintenance, and therapeutic communities --
produced an equal level of positive outcomes and
(2) clients in detoxification (i.e., inpatient)
programs or those who dropped out of treatment
within 3 months did not demonstrate positive
outcomes.

Treatment Outcome Prospective Study

Building on the methodology and findings of DARP,
from 1979 to 1981 the TOPS examined client
characteristics, treatment, and outcomes for more
than 11,000 clients in 41 methadone, residential,
detoxification, and outpatient drug-free programs.
Clients were assessed after 1 month in treatment;
at 3-month intervals during treatment; and at
intervals of 3 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 3 to 5
years after leaving treatment. Researchers in this
study claimed that determining treatment
effectiveness requires a consideration of both
behavioral and psychological factors of those in
treatment and an assessment of treatment success in
terms of both drug use and improvement in related
behaviors and attitudes. Consequently, the TOPS
study concluded that effectiveness should be
measured by changes in a client's antisocial (e.g.,
criminal) behavior, evidence of socially productive
behavior (e.g., employment or school attendance),
and cessation of drug use. The TOPS study found
that 95 percent of individuals in residential
treatment and 80 percent of individuals in
methadone programs reported more than minimal drug
use before entering treatment and a substantial
reduction in use after 3 months of treatment. For
example, of patients in residential programs for
more than 13 weeks, 22.2 percent reported more than
minimal use of heroin (not narcotics) before
treatment. After 13 weeks of treatment, only 7.3
percent of the same population reported more than
minimal use (Hubbard et al., 1989). Of those
reporting illegal activity before drug treatment,
97 percent reported cessation of that activity
during treatment. Furthermore, more than one-third
of clients (across all programs) reported total
abstinence from their primary drug during the
followup period. Finally, a 50- to 57-percent
decrease in indicators of depression was found in
clients across all treatment modalities.

Drug Abuse Treatment Outcome Study

DATOS was conducted with groups of patients
admitted to drug treatment between 1991 and 1993,
and results are not yet available. DATOS is a
multiyear, longitudinal study of 12,000 adult
clients in more than 50 treatment programs (e.g.,
methadone maintenance, inpatient, long-term
residential and therapeutic community, and
outpatient drug-free programs) in 12 cities, with
followup of 4,500 clients. One of the largest
longitudinal prospective studies of treatment
outcome ever conducted, DATOS will attempt not only
to determine which treatments work but also to
conduct a more indepth analysis of why various
treatments work and for which patients. Preliminary
data from this important study already are
beginning to provide further insight into the most
critical needs of patients entering treatment, who
is and who is not entering treatment, and some of
the barriers to successful treatment. For example,
in a recent study comparing support services needed
by TOPS and DATOS clients (based on self-reports),
Etheridge and colleagues (1995) found a decline
from "...TOPS to DATOS in the percentage of clients
who reported having received and of the seven
services [i.e., medical, psychological, family,
legal, educational, vocational, and financial
services] during the first 3 months of treatment."
Furthermore, this trend was particularly evident
for the DATOS methadone and outpatient treatment
clients.

California Drug and Alcohol Treatment Assessment

In 1992 the California Department of Alcohol and
Drug Programs launched a large-scale study of the
effectiveness, benefits, and costs of alcohol and
drug treatment in California. The purpose of
CALDATA was to study the effects of treatment on
participant behavior, the costs of treatment, and
the economic value of treatment to society.
CALDATA's key findings demonstrate that treatment
is a good investment for taxpayers and saves money
in terms of real costs attributed to drug-related
crime, illness, and lost productivity. The specific
findings are summarized as follows:

o The cost of treating the approximately 150,000
participants represented by the CALDATA study
sample in 1992 was $209 million, while the benefits
received during treatment and in the first year and
thereafter were worth approximately $1.5 billion in
savings to taxpaying citizens, due mostly to a
reduction in crime.

o Treatment for problems with crack-cocaine and
powdered cocaine was found to be just as effective
as treatment for alcohol problems and somewhat more
effective than treatment for heroin problems.

o The level of criminal activity declined by
two-thirds from before treatment to after
treatment. The greater the time spent in treatment,
the greater the percent reduction in criminal
activity.

o Alcohol and other drug use declined by
approximately two-fifths from before to after
treatment.

o Hospitalizations were reduced by approximately
one-third from before to after treatment. There
were corresponding significant improvements in
other health indicators.

o For each type of treatment studied, there were
slight or no differences in effectiveness between
men and women; younger and older participants; or
among African-Americans, Hispanics, and whites.

o Overall, treatment did not have a positive effect
on the economic situation of the participants
during the study period. However, the data indicate
that longer lengths of stay in treatment have a
positive effect on employment. This finding is
greater for those in residential programs than for
those in other treatment types. The largest gains
in employment occur with those individuals staying
in treatment beyond the first month.

These noteworthy large-scale studies of drug abuse
treatment effectiveness conclude that treatment
works. But which treatments are most effective, and
for whom are they most effective? The answers to
these questions remain elusive. Although treatment
programs have been studied for decades, many
studies produce isolated, anecdotal evidence of
success for individual treatment programs. However,
if standardized research methodologies with
comparable outcome measures had been used, the
research may have provided definitive information
regarding treatment effectiveness for specific
types of problems or clients. What we do know,
gathered from the programs that have been
thoughtfully evaluated, demonstrates that most
treatments are effective under particular
conditions and for some people. More rigorous
studies using comparable measures of success will
help us to answer these questions more
definitively.

------------------------------

A REVIEW OF WHAT IS KNOWN ABOUT TREATMENT MODELS
THAT WORK

This section reviews information about the
following drug abuse treatment models that have
been proven effective: therapeutic communities
(TCs), pharmacological treatment, outpatient
drug-free treatment, and inpatient treatment.

Therapeutic Communities

TCs are intensive, long-term, self-help, highly
structured residential treatment modalities for
chronic, hardcore drug users who have failed at
other forms of drug abuse treatment. More than
one-third of all admissions (including dropouts) to
TCs demonstrate long-term, successful outcomes 1 to
2 years after treatment. In addition, approximately
60 percent of all admissions show significant
improvement on specific outcome variables 1 to 2
years after treatment. However, clients remaining
in treatment longer than 12 months have the
greatest likelihood of successful outcomes.

The following is known about TC treatment:

o Length of stay in treatment is predictive of
outcome;
o Treatment is effective, although relapse is the
rule; and
o Treatment is effective, although dropout is the
rule.

TCs view drug use as a symptom of profound problems
of personality, social maladjustment, inadequate
interpersonal skills, little or no education, and
few (if any) marketable job skills. In other words,
the problem is the person, not the drug.

The environment of the TC, in supportive and
confrontational aspects, serves to make clients
aware of the role that their problems play in
contributing to drug use. Elements of TCs (e.g.,
encounter groups, rule-setting and rule
enforcement, rewards, and work) allow the client to
learn -- often for the first time -- interpersonal,
educational, and vocational skills and to develop
psychological, moral, and social strengths that are
fundamental to living a drug-free life, which is
the common goal of all TCs.

The concept-based TC, often referred to as the
"traditional" TC, is a departure from traditional
psychiatric care (i.e., care in which the doctors
are in control of treatment, rather than a modality
in which patients exert control over their own
recoveries). It is a self-help modality developed
by recovering addicts. This modality has become
widely accepted as an effective treatment approach
for drug addiction and antisocial problems.
Examples of TCs are San Francisco's Delancey Street
Foundation and New York's Phoenix House, where the
length of the residential stay ranges from 9 to 24
months and where residents move through explicit
stages of treatment over time.

The TC atmosphere is informal and communal. TC
staff comprise primarily recovered addicts and a
limited number of professionals, such as
psychologists. Staff and resident roles in all TCs
are hierarchical in structure, with an explicit
chain of command. New residents are assigned to
work teams with the lowest status and are
responsible for the most menial tasks, such as
washing floors. As residents demonstrate increased
competency and emotional growth, they are moved up
the hierarchy, earning positions with improved
status and privileges. These rewards are highly
reinforcing. Group meetings are central to TC
operations and treatment.

TCs provide an orderly environment for many who
have lived in chaotic or disruptive settings,
reduce boredom and distracts from negative
preoccupations that in the past had been associated
with drug use, and offer an opportunity to achieve
satisfaction from a busy schedule and the
completion of daily chores. However, because TCs
are physically and psychologically demanding, the
dropout rate is high, especially in the first 3
months. Only one in four voluntary clients remains
longer than 3 months, while fewer than one in six
complete the 1- to 2-year course of treatment. For
those who do complete the program, the possibility
of living a life free from drugs is greater than
for those who drop out early.

Measures of TC Treatment Effectiveness

The goal of all TCs, and the way they define
clinical effectiveness, is the promotion of a
drug-free lifestyle through psychological
habilitation and rehabilitation. Additional issues
become important in TC treatment for specific
populations. Drug-addicted pregnant women or women
with children need to develop self-esteem,
parenting skills, and ways to cope without drugs in
an environment that nurtures both them and their
children. Adolescent drug users need approaches to
treatment that take into account their sense of
denial and invulnerability. Drug-addicted
incarcerated offenders need an environment in which
they will be respected so that the dual goals of
reduced recidivism to both prison and drug use will
be met.

Good programs can be distinguished on the basis of
well-defined treatment protocols, adequate staffing
patterns and experience, explicit program goals,
reasonable and consistent funding, and
comprehensive management information systems.

------------------------------

Pharmacological Treatment

As with other types of settings, several factors
govern the effectiveness of programs that use
pharmacotherapy primarily:

o The intake population (i.e., substantial
selection occurs during the screening process);

o The length of time an individual waits for
treatment;

o The dropout frequency of those on the waiting
list;

o The point at which the individual is in the
treatment process;

o The client's environment;

o The points at which success is monitored;

o The services integrated into the overall service
package; and

o The treatment process, including dosages, pattern
and duration of treatment, training of providers,
funding, and program demand constraints.

In addition, as with other treatment modalities,
programs that provide pharmacological treatment
consider retention in treatment a measure of
positive treatment outcome.  Understanding who is
retained and the referral history of clients can
help programs prevent relapse and attrition.

The success of pharmacotherapy programs is well
documented. A variety of pharmacological treatments
for drug dependence and evidence of their
effectiveness are described below.

Treatment of Opioid Dependence

Pharmacological treatments for opioid dependence
frequently use one of two general approaches. The
first approach is long-term treatment in which the
addict is maintained with a legally sanctioned
narcotic such as methadone. The second approach is
short-term treatment in which the addict is
intended to be detoxified to a drug-free state.
This review will focus on long-term pharmacological
treatment.

Pharmacological maintenance programs involve the
long-term administration of a medication that
either replaces the illicit drug or blocks its
actions. The medication is administered for at
least 1 month and can be administered for as long
as several years. The goal of some programs is
lifetime maintenance on medication. Lifetime
maintenance may be warranted as patient needs and
preferences dictate.

Methadone

Methadone is a narcotic analgesic that is an
effective substitute for heroin, morphine, codeine,
and other opiate derivatives. Opiates act quickly
and wear off within a few hours of administration,
producing withdrawal symptoms such as sleep
disturbance, agitation, and mild depression.
Long-lasting methadone doses are substituted for
illicit opiates to suppress withdrawal symptoms.
Methadone may be prescribed to assist in
detoxification or to reduce the use of illicit
drugs and the related criminal, social, and
psychological problems associated with them.

Methadone is used to suppress opioid withdrawal
symptoms for the entire 24-hour period between
doses without producing euphoria or sedation. This
treatment eliminates a major source of pressure to
use illicit opioids (i.e., the discomfort of
withdrawal). The use of methadone typically renders
concurrent use of other opioids ineffective for
purposes of producing euphoria.

Detoxification using methadone takes between 3
weeks and 6 months. The process begins with
increasing the dosage of methadone and decreasing
illicit opiate use without producing symptoms of
withdrawal. Methadone doses eventually may be
tapered down to zero. Attrition is reported to be
high during the second week of 3-week programs, and
patients show a rate of relapse greater than 90
percent.

Methadone maintenance programs frequently are long
term, often lasting 12 months or longer.
Participation in methadone maintenance programs
enables recovering addicts to focus on their social
and vocational rehabilitation and to become
reintegrated into society, although they still are
addicted to an opioid. Reducing the use of illicit
drugs and reducing the commission of other crimes
to finance the drug habit are the primary goals of
methadone maintenance. Improved physical and
psychological well-being and social productivity
also are objectives.

A 1991 study sponsored by the National Institute on
Drug Abuse focused on six established methadone
maintenance programs in New York, New York;
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and Baltimore,
Maryland. Comprehensive data about the structure
and operations of these programs were collected
during a 3-year period. For example, the study
found that the experience and education of
counselors at these facilities varied. Each clinic
had its own philosophy of treatment, which appeared
to be strongly conditioned by the director's
personal philosophy. Unfortunately, the criteria
that constituted a successful outcome were often
unclear to the counselors who were providing
treatment. The only services applied consistently
were case management and individual counseling
sessions. Initial assessment by a counselor was
consistently available at only one program. This
study found that although opioid use declined
markedly after admission, 82 percent of subjects
who left treatment rapidly relapsed to intravenous
drug use within 1 year. Crime was reduced
substantially at all six programs.

Naltrexone

Naltrexone, an opioid antagonist, blocks the
effects of opioids such as heroin, thereby
discouraging their use. Naltrexone can be
administered in small daily doses or in larger
doses three times per week. To avoid intensified
withdrawal symptoms, patients must be completely
detoxified from opioids before naltrexone can be
used. Detoxification can be accomplished with the
aid of buprenorphine or clonidine.

Naltrexone is typically an adjunct to individual,
group, or family therapy. In general, naltrexone is
thought to work best for highly motivated patients,
especially those with social supports.
Consequently, the retention rate appears to be
greatest for health professionals and others with
high social and economic status. Patients with
appropriate external motivations, such as fear of
job loss or return to prison, may also find success
using naltrexone if they have family support.

In 1986 researchers reported on the success of
naltrexone programs serving three general types of
patients. The key findings of this study are
summarized below:

o The Veterans' Administration in Philadelphia
treated 327 outpatient addicts for an average of 9
years. At the 6-month followup, 32 percent of
patients receiving naltrexone for more than 30 days
remained opioid free.

o Middle-class suburban subjects who had been using
opioids for an average of 10.5 years were studied
in 13 California clinics. Included in this study
were 42 former heroin addicts who had been
maintained with methadone, levo-alpha-
acetylmethadol (LAAM), or other medications prior
to naltrexone treatment. Most of these subjects
were employed. Outcomes studied were drug use and
treatment retention. Retention averaged only a few
weeks but was clearly helped by counseling. It was
concluded that the use of naltrexone appears to
promote long periods of opioid abstinence but does
not prevent subsequent relapse.

o Of the 114 business executives treated at Regent
Hospital in New York City and at Fair Oaks Hospital
in Summit, New Jersey, all had been addicted for at
least 2 years and had entered treatment under
serious threat of losing their jobs. The initial
phase of the programs, lasting 4 to 10 weeks,
consisted of treatment with clonidine
detoxification, group therapy, peer group meetings,
family meetings, individual therapy, educational
sessions, and physical exercise. The second phase
consisted of outpatient naltrexone treatment for at
least 6 months in conjunction with group and/or
individual therapy, self-help groups, and urine
monitoring. Outcomes reported were drug use,
employment, and retention in treatment. At 12- to
18-month followup, 64 percent of subjects were
still opioid free. Patients who completed at least
6 months of treatment were more likely to be opioid
free, employed, and continuing therapy or
participating in a self-help group than those who
discontinued treatment shortly before hospital
discharge.

Buprenorphine

Buprenorphine, a medication still in the
experimental stage, exhibits mixed opioid-like and
opioid-antagonist properties. It causes dependence
in those not already taking opioids but acts as an
antagonist to precipitate withdrawal in those who
are opioid dependent. Maintenance buprenorphine
treatment, like methadone, seems to reduce craving,
enhance treatment retention, and block the effects
of illicit opioids. Buprenorphine is more
frequently used as an aid to detoxification.

LAAM

Long-acting opioid maintenance compounds, such as
LAAM, are being developed to overcome the need for
daily clinic attendance required by methadone
maintenance. LAAM has been shown to suppress
withdrawal symptoms in opioid-dependent subjects
for 72 to 96 hours. Its delayed onset results in
fewer sedative effects and less euphoria than
methadone.

Clinical trials of LAAM suggest that it is
comparable to methadone maintenance in clinical
safety and efficacy but offers a number of
advantages. First, its long duration of action
allows clinic attendance to be reduced from daily
attendance to attendance three times per week. The
need for take-home doses that may be diverted to
street use is eliminated. LAAM also increases the
clinics' treatment capacity since fewer clinic
visits per patient are required. Fewer clinic
visits further reduces the patient's feelings of
dependence on the clinic. Second, slower onset and
more sustained action reduce feelings of sedation
and decrease its attractiveness to street addicts
as a potential drug of abuse.

Treatment of Cocaine Dependence

Both short-term and long-term medications have been
studied for their potential to treat addiction to
cocaine and its derivatives. None of these
medications has been accepted for widespread use.
Short-term medications (e.g., amantadine and
bromocriptine) have been shown to reduce symptoms
of cocaine withdrawal (e.g., cocaine craving, lack
of energy, depression, and insomnia). Long-term
agents have a delayed onset of action in reducing
cocaine craving. For example, desipramine's onset
of action is usually delayed for 10 to 20 days.

Fluphenthixol decanoate has both antidepressant and
antipsychotic properties. Preliminary research on
this medication has shown it to be effective in
ameliorating cocaine withdrawal symptoms. In
experimental research, fluphenthixol has been found
to decrease cocaine use markedly, resulting in a
260-percent increase in the average time a patient
was retained in treatment compared with their
longest previous stays.

Measures of Pharmacological Treatment Outcome

Outcome measures used for evaluating
pharmacological treatments depend on the philosophy
of the individual program and the goals of the
researchers. Short-term pharmacological treatment
generally implies detoxification. Medications for
detoxification are usually evaluated in terms of
immediate pharmacological effects and retention in
treatment for the several days that detoxification
requires. These medications are intended to subdue
physical withdrawal symptoms.

Medications for long-term or maintenance treatment
(e.g., methadone or naltrexone) are usually
evaluated for overall effectiveness and are
measured by such factors as retention in treatment
as part of specific programs. Outcome measures have
included the following (separately or in various
combinations):

o Drug use. -- This is measured in terms of use of
heroin, total opiates, cocaine, intravenous drugs,
depressants, marijuana, or alcohol.

o Criminality. -- This is expressed by number of
arrests or convictions, time spent in jail, number
of days involved in crime, percent of income
derived from crime, or dollar amount derived from
crime.

o Productivity. -- This is defined by employment,
school, or homemaking.

o Medical problems. -- This includes days having
medical problems, time physically disabled, and
reduction of intravenous-related risk factors such
as AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) and
hepatitis.

o Psychological functioning. -- This is usually
measured with standard instruments, such as the
Beck Depression Inventory.

o Social functioning. -- This is usually measured
as the number of days having family or other
interpersonal problems.

Many researchers use the Addiction Severity Index
(ASI) for all measurements. The ASI is a structured
clinical interview that can be administered in 30
minutes. It produces 10-point problem severity
ratings in each of 6 areas commonly affected by
addiction: drug abuse, physical health, employment,
family/social supports, the law, and psychological
health. "Current functioning" combines ASI measures
of employment, drug use, family, and psychological
problems for the past month. In addition, the ASI
has proven to be extremely useful as a set of
relevant measurement outcomes in clinical trials
examining addictive disorders.

------------------------------

Outpatient Drug-Free Treatment

Some researchers consider outpatient drug-free
treatment to be the "backbone" of treatment efforts
in most parts of the United States. Outpatient
drug-free treatment includes a range of protocols,
from highly professional psychotherapy to informal
peer discussions. Counseling services vary
considerably and include individual, group, or
family counseling; peer group support; vocational
therapy; marital therapy; and cognitive therapy.
Aftercare, considered necessary to prevent relapse,
typically consists of 12-step meetings, periodic
group or individual counseling, recovery training
or self-help and relapse prevention strategies,
and/or vocational counseling.

The National Drug Abuse Treatment System Survey,
conducted in 1988, indicated that outpatient
drug-free programs have an average of 9 staff
members, compared with 13 in methadone maintenance
programs, and tend to have more staff members with
advanced academic degrees and with drug abuse
treatment certification or training than do
methadone maintenance programs. TOPS found that
outpatient drug-free programs are more likely than
other modalities to employ psychologists and social
workers.

Measures of Outpatient Treatment Effectiveness

While abstinence appears to be the ideal goal of
outpatient drug-free treatment programs, reduced
drug use is commonly viewed as a more realistic
objective and also is considered a sign of
treatment efficacy. The clinical measures of
effectiveness are particularly difficult to discern
due to the enormous diversity within the modality
and the relative scarcity of available outcome
studies. Like the other major modalities,
outpatient drug-free programs most often focus on
clients' drug use when assessing treatment
effectiveness. Studies indicate that outpatient
drug-free programs are more likely than outpatient
methadone programs to stress abstinence as an
outcome. Even so, relapse is common and is not
considered a sign of treatment failure. Other
common measures of effectiveness, depending on the
intensity and range of services offered by
particular programs, are improved employment
status, reduced criminal activity, and a wide
variety of psychosocial factors. Programs
specifically for women consider other outcomes,
such as improved perinatal outcomes and parenting
skills, as significant signs of treatment
effectiveness.

Outpatient drug-free treatment programs continue to
grow in number and diversity. As more and more
people turn to outpatient treatment as a
cost-effective treatment modality, a clearer
understanding will be needed regarding the effects
that these treatments have on overall long-term
outcomes.

------------------------------

Inpatient Treatment

Inpatient treatment refers to the treatment of drug
dependence in a hospital and includes medical
supervision of detoxification. Inpatient drug
treatment programs traditionally lasted for 28
days, although this duration has changed
considerably since the emergence of managed care
models in substance abuse services and currently
range from as little as 3 days to longer, more
traditional lengths of stay. Criteria for
hospitalization of the cocaine abuser are as
follows:

o Users whose drug compulsions are uncontrollable,
especially heavy freebasers3 and intravenous drug
users;

o Users with physical dependence on other drugs or
alcohol;

o Users with severe medical or psychiatric
complications;

o Users with severe psychosocial impairments; and

o Users who have failed in outpatient treatment.

Admission to inpatient programs to treat dependence
on drugs other than cocaine is equally stringent,
often using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition criteria for
drug use disorders.

The primary objective of inpatient drug-free
treatment is to help the patient achieve and
maintain a drug-free lifestyle. Additional
objectives include the following: decreased
involvement in illegal activities; increased
productivity in work or school settings; improved
social, family, and psychological functioning; and
improved physical health. Improved psychological
and family functioning facilitates improvement in
other areas as well. There are different types of
inpatient programs, serving different types of
clientele. Those discussed below are therapy-based
programs, 12-step programs, and multimodality
programs.

Therapy-Based Programs

Therapy-based programs, also referred to as
psychiatric inpatient programs, tend to serve older
or middle-class patients, adolescents whose drug
use has not yet developed the secondary
characteristic of drug addiction, and patients who
have a specific psychiatric problem in addition to
drug use. Psychiatric programs require a 4- to
12-week length of stay, although adolescent
treatment may be longer. Programs generally begin
with detoxification, followed by a variety of
services, including individual, group, and family
therapy; education; and training in behavioral
techniques, such as relaxation and exercise.
Participation in Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) or
Narcotics Anonymous (NA) is required. Psychiatric
inpatient programs are described as more useful for
older, middle-class, or blue-collar patients.
Addicted health professionals constitute a specific
patient population that appears to benefit from
psychiatric inpatient treatment.

12-Step Programs

Twelve-step programs, such as the Minnesota Model
(patterned after the Hazelden program in
Minnesota), are based on a model of total
abstinence. Certified counselors (often recovering
addicts) conduct most of the group and individual
counseling, with program staff providing consulting
and resource backup as needed. Counseling is
focused on family and other interpersonal
relationships. Patients work on at least the first
four steps of the AA model while in the treatment
program, with progression through the remaining
eight steps expected through subsequent involvement
with AA or NA. Detoxification and health assessment
also are included in 12-step programs.

Patients in 12-step programs generally are
middle-class or working-class males with a high
school education who do not have co-occurring
psychiatric disorders. Lower rates of abstinence
were reported for clients under age 25. Twelve-step
treatment is reportedly more effective for
middle-age participants than for those in other age
groups.

Multimodality Programs

Multimodality programs, pioneered by Jaffe (1973)
and Kleber (1985), offer a variety of services,
including inpatient treatment, medical care,
outpatient brief treatment, vocational training,
educational enhancement for adolescents, family
therapy, adult or adolescent TCs, methadone
maintenance, group psychotherapy, individual
psychotherapy, drug education, and stress-coping
techniques. Multimodality programs require
coordination among noncompetitive treatment
programs. These options often exist within a single
community.

Treatment options differ from program to program. A
case manager or client representative assists
patients in selecting appropriate treatment
options. Inpatient treatment generally is required
at some point in the multimodal treatment process.
Patients may be transferred into or out of
different treatment modalities based on progress,
which is assessed by evaluation staff and the case
manager. Criteria for transfer include the
following: level of compulsion or severity of drug
use, psychiatric or psychological impairment,
compliance with program requirements, and
improvement in psychological functioning.

Inpatient treatment is not an option for everyone,
including many drug-using women with children. Few
programs provide childcare services; foster care
may be the only option for women who require
inpatient treatment, especially for low-income
families and single women. Many women avoid
treatment for fear that they will be unable to
regain custody of their children after completing
treatment. Pregnant women may risk criminal charges
for drug use during pregnancy and may therefore
refrain from seeking treatment.

Measures of Inpatient Treatment Effectiveness 

Abstinence is the most common goal of inpatient
treatment programs and the most widely used measure
of clinical effectiveness. Abstinence, by most
definitions, means refraining from use of all
drugs, including the primary drug of dependence
(generally cocaine or heroin), alcohol, marijuana,
and all other mood-altering drugs. Measures of
abstinence, however, may be divided into separate
measures for abstinence from the primary drug of
dependence, alcohol, marijuana, and other drugs.
Alternately, abstinence may be measured by the
length of time the patient remains drug free during
the followup period or by the frequency of
subsequent drug use.

Measures of clinical effectiveness focus on
continuance of a drug-free lifestyle and evidence
of improved psychological functioning and social
skills for all inpatient programs reviewed. All
programs measured total abstinence, although some
included data on levels of use for nonabstainers
and an indication as to whether data were
self-reported or verified objectively.
Participation in aftercare, another measure of
treatment effectiveness, is an important factor in
preventing relapse and continued development of
coping skills.

Intake data are benchmarks against which
posttreatment lifestyle measures are compared. The
CATOR (the Chemical Abuse/Addiction Treatment
Outcome Registry) methodology and studies using the
ASI are examples of pretreatment and posttreatment
measures of outcome variables.

------------------------------

INTEGRATING SERVICES FOR SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME

Regardless of the setting (e.g., inpatient,
outpatient, or residential), a successful course of
treatment will combine therapies, services, and
methods that produce favorable outcomes. Since drug
users, especially hardcore drug users, face many
related problems (e.g., high-risk environment,
unemployment, lack of education, and physical and
sexual abuse), effective treatment requires several
critical elements, including the following:

o Complete and ongoing assessment of the client;

o A comprehensive range of services, including
pharmacological treatment, if necessary;
counseling, either individual or group, in either
structured or unstructured settings; and HIV-risk
reduction education;

o A continuum of treatment interventions;

o Case management and monitoring to engage clients
in an appropriate intensity of services; and

o Provision and integration of continuing social
supports.

These elements, rather than the specific treatment
models, determine whether a program will be
successful in treating individual clients and
affecting the broader social or community problems
that exist because of drug abuse.

In conclusion, drug addiction is a complex disorder
involving a range of biological, psychological, and
often environmental factors. Often a chronic,
relapsing disorder, treatment works when those who
abuse drugs can be engaged and retained in
treatment and when other needed services can be
integrated with drug treatment itself and delivered
to help clients resolve the range of problems that
accompany their drug use.

Substance-Abusing Population in Treatment

NATIONAL DRUG AND ALCOHOLISM TREATMENT UNIT SURVEY

When discussing treatment protocols and
effectiveness, it is helpful to know the number of
people in the United States currently involved in
treatment for substance abuse and to understand the
characteristics of the population in treatment. The
National Drug and Alcoholism Treatment Unit Survey
(NDATUS) is a primary source of national data on
specialty substance abuse treatment and the
population seeking such treatment; therefore,
NDATUS is used to provide a representative point of
reference in this report.

NDATUS collects services data for 1 day out of the
year. This "snapshot" provides an indication of the
scope and costs of annual treatment services,
albeit, to the extent that flow of admissions,
duration of treatment episodes, and nature of
treatment services are stable throughout the year.
Although treatment services are changing in light
of the development of the services environment and
the introduction of managed care, NDATUS is
believed to be the most representative source of
information on treatment nature, type, and
duration.

CLIENTS IN TREATMENT

On September 30, 1992, approximately 945,000
individuals were undergoing specialty substance
abuse treatment. This represents an average of 432
clients ages 12 and older per 100,000 in the
general population. However, the number of clients
varies across the Nation. Of the four census
regions, the highest rate of specialty treatment
clients was found in the West (656 per 100,000).
The Northeast had a rate of 539 clients per
100,000, the Midwest was below the national average
with a rate of 361 clients per 100,000, and the
South had the lowest rate average of 293 per
100,000.

SUBSTANCES OF ABUSE

Since 1991 NDATUS has classified clients by whether
they were being treated for drugs only, alcohol
only, or both alcohol and drugs. Besides
identifying the actual substances abused by
clients, this classification might also reflect
treatment service provider expectations. For
example, if a provider is oriented toward alcohol
abuse, the provider is more likely to report that
its clients abuse alcohol. State funding,
licensing, and reporting practices also may
influence the reporting of clients' problems.

Among clients in treatment, simultaneous abuse of
illicit drugs (e.g., cocaine, opiates, and
marijuana) and alcohol was the most common pattern
of substance abuse (38 percent). Thirty-seven
percent abused only alcohol, while 25 percent
abused only drugs.

CLIENT DEMOGRAPHICS

The demographic data for clients has been collected
by NDATUS since 1980. Actual numbers of clients
cannot be compared over time because of
fluctuations in survey coverage; therefore, the
proportion of clients in each demographic category
are compared. Comparing the proportion of clients
as opposed to the number of clients in each
category allows an assessment of how the mix of
clients may have changed over time, highlighting
potential survey discontinuities.

An analysis of the demographic data revealed the
following information:

o In 1992, 72 percent of clients in specialty
substance abuse treatment were male. This
percentage represents a slow decline in the
proportion of men in treatment, who comprised 75
percent of the total in 1980.

o The age pattern of clients has changed. The
proportion of clients ages 21 to 44 rose from 62
percent in 1980 to 75 percent in 1992, while the
proportion of clients under age 21 or over age 44
declined substantially.

o In 1992 white clients represented the largest
proportion of clients in treatment (60 percent).
Blacks, Hispanics, and Native Americans were
overrepresented when compared with their
proportions of the general population. Blacks
comprised 22 percent of treatment clients, compared
with 12 percent of the general population;
Hispanics represented 15 percent of treatment
clients, compared with 10 percent of the general
population; and Native Americans comprised 1.3
percent of treatment clients, compared with 0.7
percent of the general population.

TREATMENT SERVICES

Analysis of the demographic data revealed the
following information on treatment services:

o In 1992, 87 percent of daily clients1 were
enrolled in outpatient rehabilitation. The
remaining 13 percent were in 24-hour treatment.

o The proportion of outpatient rehabilitation
clients increased steadily from 1982 to 1992. The
proportion of outpatient methadone clients remained
between 12 and 15 percent of all clients.

o In 1992 the proportion of clients in 24-hour
detoxification treatment was less than 6 percent in
all States and 3 percent or less in 40 States.
However, States varied widely in their proportion
of clients in outpatient versus 24-hour
rehabilitation and in their proportion of
outpatient methadone clients.

o When States are ranked by number of clients per
100,000 in the general population, there appears to
be a positive correlation between clients per
100,000 and the proportion of clients in outpatient
treatment. That is, the larger the rate of clients
in treatment, the greater the proportion of clients
in outpatient care.

The predominance of outpatient services over
24-hour rehabilitation has two caveats. First, it
is more difficult for providers to accurately count
the number of outpatient clients than 24-hour
rehabilitation clients because the definition is
more complicated, more records must be reviewed,
and many "actively enrolled" clients who scheduled
appointments during the past month may not return.
As a result, many respondents may estimate the
number of active outpatient clients without any
detailed review of clinical records. 

Second, because 24-hour treatment clients typically
have shorter lengths of stay, more clients are
admitted to 24-hour slots than outpatient slots
during a year. Consequently, the proportion of
24-hour clients measured on this 1-day census is
lower than it would be if clients were reported on
an annual basis.

MATCHING CLIENTS TO TREATMENT

As stated earlier, for each treatment type, NDATUS
enumerates the number of clients being treated for
alcohol only, drugs only, or both alcohol and
drugs. Although it is difficult to classify problem
severity with only these three categories of
substance abuse, clients who use both drugs and
alcohol are more likely to have severe dependency
problems. 

Clients with both alcohol and drug problems also
receive the most intensive treatment. In 1992, 20
percent of clients using both substances were in
24-hour treatment versus 10 percent of clients
using only drugs and 8 percent using only alcohol.
In 1991, 19 percent of clients using both
substances were in 24-hour treament versus 12
percent using only drugs and 8 percent using only
alcohol.

Two possible reasons explain why clients with
polysubstance abuse are more often treated in
24-hour programs: (1) They may be more disabled by
their substance abuse, thereby requiring
round-the-clock care or (2) they may need to be
taken out of environments that perpetuate substance
abuse.
