print,' '
print,'This is a short introduction to what GRP Map Maker does and to '
print,'its uses.  For full details on how to use the program please refer'
print,'to the users guide by J.A. Tyler.'
print,'  '
print,'GRP Map Maker is entirely original code written by J.A. Tyler.'
print,'However, GRP Map Maker does build on the previous efforts of ,
print,'J. Luo, D. Mason, J. Kirsch, J. Horne, and M. Terra.'
print,'  '
print,'GRP Map Maker is a program designed to compute the spatial '
print,'distribution of growth rate potentials (GRP) across a transect.'
print,'GRP Map Maker takes data on prey fish distributions, water '
print,'temperatures, and when available light intensities and combines '
print,'them with foraging and bioenergetic growth models to get a spatial'
print,'distribution of GRP.  The program requires data inputs from the '
print,'DEVIS acoustic data processing system (Jech & Luo 1997) or from '
print,'biosonics acoustic data processing system, BSNFISH_WDT, (Jech) '
print,'and water temperature data processed using the temp_fill program'
print,'(Hondorp & Jech 1997).  '
print,'For a description of GRP, see Brandt et al. (1992). '

print,' '
print,'The bioenergetics equations come from the so-called "Wisconsin" model.'
print,'Equations for that model may be found in Hewett & Johnson (1992).  The '
print,'functional equations and bioenergetic parameters used in GRP Map Maker '
print,'are identical to those presented in Hewett & Johnson (1992).  Users will'
print,'have to use the program GRPPARAM to create a bioenergetics parameter '
print,'file that is compatable with GRP Map Maker.'
print,' '
print,'The foraging models are adapted from standard foraging models of '
print,'Gerritsen & Strickler (1977), Bailey & Batty (1984), Aksness & Giske'
print,'(1993).  The model computes a volume searched based on fish reactive'
print,'distance and swimming speed.  Consumption is based on volume searched,'
print,'biomass density of prey, and capture probability.'

print,' '
print,'This version of GRP Map Maker extends the capabilities of previous '
print,'versions by adding the ability of modifying fish foraging by '
print,'light intensities at depth.  This part of the program operates by'
print,'modifying predator reactive distance as a function of light intensity'
print,'in a given cell.  The reactive distance part is unique to GRP Map Maker,'
print,'thus not found in previous models such as those found in Brandt et al. '
print,'(1992), Goyke & Brandt (1993), and Luo & Brandt (1993).'
print,'The functions used to adjust fish foraging by light intensity are '
print,'constructed from previously published data.  However, these fuctions'
print,'are the result of efforts of J.A. Tyler and M.E. Terra and are at'
print,'present not published and should not be considered "public domain".'
print,'Therefore, use of the capabilities of GRP Map Maker 2.8 that include'
print,'light intensity adjustments of fish foraging are to only be used if '
print,'you have come to an agreement with both J.A. Tyler and M.E. Terra '
print,'for a collaborative effort.  Once the functions have been published, '
print,'use of this component of GRP Map Maker 2.8 will be made available to '
print,'all users.'
