{description}   STS-101 Pilot Scott Horowitz arrives at KSC's Shuttle Landing
                Facility at the controls of a T-38 jet aircraft. Mission
                Specialist Jeffrey Williams was a passenger. They and the rest of
                the crew are at KSC to take part in Terminal Countdown
                Demonstration Test (TCDT) activities that include emergency
                egress training and a dress rehearsal for launch. The other crew
                members are Commander James Halsell and Mission Specialists Mary
                Ellen Weber, James Voss, Susan Helms and Yuri Usachev. During
                their mission to the International Space Station, the STS-101
                crew will be delivering logistics and supplies, plus preparing
                the Station for the arrival of the Zvezda Service Module,
                expected to be launched by Russia in July 2000. Also, the crew
                will conduct one space walk to perform maintenance on the Space
                Station. This will be the third assembly flight for the Space
                Station. STS-101 is scheduled to launch April 24 at 4:15 p.m.
                from Launch Pad 39A.
