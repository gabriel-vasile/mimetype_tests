        <h2>I. Scope
         
        </h2>

           
        <p>This statement includes graphic arts materials in non- book formats, 
          as detailed in the Sections below. For books and periodicals, see the 
          CPS Fine and Applied Arts - Books and Periodicals.</p>

                

           
        <p>Paintings, sculptures, and other three-dimensional works of art are 
          not acquired except under the special conditions described in the CPS 
          for Non-Library Materials. Also not acquired: individual greeting cards; 
          postcards unless they contain fine prints or photographs.</p>


<h2>II.   Fine prints</h2>

           <p>The Library of Congress selectively acquires woodcuts,
engravings, etchings lithographs, and other types of original
prints of the highest quality which relate to and complement the
Library's existing fine print collection.</p>
<ol type="A">
      <li>   The Library's fine print collection is international in
	  Scope with particular emphasis on prints produced in the United States
	  since 1870.  In special instances
efforts may be made to acquire the complete oeuvre of an American
printmaker, e.g., James McNeil Whistler or Joseph Pennell.</li>

      <li>   In acquiring works by contemporary United States and
        foreign artists, the Library seeks to include in its collections
        only major works by those who have had or potentially will have an
impact on printmaking in the United States.</li>
      <li>   The Library collects foreign prints which support the
        research collections and interests of the Library's area studies
divisions.</li>
      <li>   Existing strengths of the Fine Prints Collections, in
        such areas as early lithography, chiaroscuro woodcuts, and French
        nineteenth-century printmaking, are further developed through the
        acquisition of important examples of work in this area.  Prints
        which are appropriate to a study collection on the history of
printmaking technique are also acquired.</li>
      <li>   The Library does not generally acquire fine prints which
        are represented in other national collections in Washington.</li>
</ol>
      <h2>III.  Posters</h2>

          <p> The Library attempts, within available resources, to
acquire outstanding examples of posters produced throughout the
world, with emphasis on:</p>

          <ol type="A">
            <li>   Examples illustrative of political, military, social,
              economic, industrial and cultural history, including advertising
              and propaganda, with priority given to documentation of the United
              States life and history;</li>
            <li>   Examples of the work of major artists, with priority
              given to work of United States origin;</li>
            <li> Examples of motion picture posters, lobby cards, and related materials, which
              complement the already significant and comprehensive holdings that begin with 
              depictions of the earliest presentations of the motion picture, to serial versions
              and feature length silent films and talkies through the emergence  of the movie star
              and the rise of the great Hollywood studios, to the era of the blockbuster, special 
              effects and independent film.</li>
            <li>    Examples illustrative of the history of the poster as an
              art form, and as a medium of communication.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Every effort is to be made to achieve worldwide
coverage.</p>



<h2>IV.   Reproductions of works of art</h2>

           <p>The Library of Congress selectively acquires
reproductions relating directly to the materials and artists
represented in the prints and Photographs Division, but only if
comparable high-quality material is not available in book,
microform, or other collected format.</p>

<h2>V.    Artists' drawings</h2>

      <p>The Library acquires drawings which substantially support or
enrich the Library's existing graphic arts collections or which
serve as primary research documents for American political,
economic and social history, including the following:      </p>

    <ol type="A">  
      <li>   Fine, representative examples of preparatory studies,
        sketches, and finished drawings prepared for illustrations in
        American books and magazines.</li>
      <li>   Selected drawings which support and related to the
        Library's existing collections of fine and historical prints and
        posters.  These include drawings by major printmakers represented
        in the Library's collections and drawings executed in preparation
        for or closely relating to prints and posters in the collections.</li>
      <li>   Drawings for American political and social cartoons and
        caricatures as documents of public opinion and of the history of
        visual satire and propaganda.  Drawings for foreign political
        cartoons and caricature drawings of personalities of international
        prominence will be acquired selectively as documents of the
        comparative history of visual satire and propaganda.</li>
      <li>   Topographical drawings of a scenographic character and
        other drawings of documentary value as records of American
        historical events and American urban and rural buildings,
        structures, and scenery.</li>
      <li>   The Library will not acquire the following types of
        materials:
    <ol>
          <li>Drawings for portraits of American public figures,
                these being considered the responsibility of the
          National Portrait Gallery.</li>
          <li>Drawings for technical designs and diagrams.</li>
    </ol></li>
    </ol>

<h2>VI.  Architectural drawings and documentation</h2>

           <p>The Library of Congress acquires architectural drawings,
photographs, and related documents of research value that
substantially support or enrich the Library's existing
architectural collections or will serve as primary research
materials for the study of the architecture of the United States,
its territories, and possessions.  Materials to be acquired
include:</p>

           <ol type="A">
             <li>   Selected original drawings by significant or potentially
               significant American architects, designers and planners.  The
               Library will not normally collect detailed engineering drawings, or
               the entire output of an architect's office.  The emphasis will be
               on buildings other than those erected by the Federal government,
               since the National Archives and Records Service is responsible for
               the building records of the majority of these structures.</li>
             <li>   Selected measured drawings, photographs, and other
               documentation of existing, lost and, in some cases, unexecuted
               buildings; characteristic building types and technologies; historic
               structures; and the work of notable architects, craftsmen,
               engineers, landscape architects, urban planners and interior
               designers active in the United States.  These materials include,
               but are not limited to, the Historic American Buildings
               Survey/Historic American Engineering Record.</li>
             <li>   Selected drawings, photographs, and other documentation
               of buildings or sites outside the United States representing
               particular designers, techniques, building types and styles,
               technical or design innovations, etc., that have had notable impact
               on work in the United States or were influenced by work in this
               country.</li>
             <li>   Materials relating to foreign buildings and sites that
               substantially strengthen or supplement the existing holdings of the
               Library, or fill notable gaps in the Library's record of the
               history of architecture in all countries.</li>
             <li>   For Western architecture before 1800, the Library
               attempts to coordinate its acquisitions with those of the National
               Gallery of Art in order to avoid duplication.  Similarly,
               the Library works with the Dumbarton Oaks Library to avoid
               duplication in the field of garden and landscape
               architecture.</li>
             <li>   In general, the Library does not endeavor to build large
               collections of original architectural drawings, blueprints and
               specifications relating to the construction and building trades, as
               these fall within the scope of the collections of the National
               Building Museum.</li>
             <li>   The Library, as part of its work towards the Cooperative
               Preservation of Architectural Records (COPAR), encourages the
               placement of archives of limited subject or geographical interest
               in appropriate regional collections.  The Library collects
               information about such holdings and, where possible, microform
               copies of the same.  </li>
           </ol>
               <h2>VII.  Engineering drawing and documentation</h2>
           
               <ol type="A">
                 <li>   The Library of Congress attempts to build a documentary
                   collection of drawings, and related documents showing the history,
                   monuments, and achievements of civil engineering in the United
                   States, to complement the Historical American Engineering Record
                   (HAER).  The purpose of HAER is to record the accomplishments of
                   engineering in the United States, its territories and possessions,
                   as shown in such installations as bridges, canals, waterworks,
                   irrigation systems, transportation systems, dams, tunnels, etc.
                 <br />
                 The types of materials to be acquired include measured
                   drawings from existing structures, photographs, and accompanying
                   historical and technical data.</li>
                 <li>   The Library does not attempt, in general, to build large
                   collections of original engineering or technical drawings,
                   blueprints and specifications.  The Library, rather, attempts to
                   coordinate its acquisitions in the field of historic engineering
                   with those of the National Museum of American History in order to
                   avoid duplication.</li>
               </ol>
               <h2>VIII.      Popular and applied graphic art</h2>

           <p>The Library selectively acquires popular and historical
prints which are important documents of American history and the
history of graphic art in the United States, or which relate to and
complement the Library's existing graphic art study collection.</p>

           <ol type="A">
             <li>   Particular emphasis is placed on the acquisition of
               prints which are important pictorial records of the people,
               history, and culture of the United States and of its present and
               former territories and possessions.  These include views of
               American buildings, cities, urban and rural sites, people, and
               events or personalities of work significance or of special
               importance to the history of the United States, and are acquired on
               a selective basis.</li>
             <li>   The Library acquires on a selective basis important
               examples of the ornamental and functional uses of the graphic arts
               in the United States.  The types of materials include, but are not
               limited to, illustrated sheet music, advertising labels, and bank-
               note engravings.  Outstanding examples of foreign works in these
               categories will be acquired if they can be shown to have influenced
               developments in American illustration and graphic design.</li>
             <li>   The Library collects foreign prints of historical
               significance which support the research interests and collections
               of the Library's various area studies divisions.</li>
             <li>   Works which are of strictly local significance are
               considered the province of regional repositories.  The Library
               attempts to direct such works to the appropriate institutions.</li>
             <li>   Collections in most cases are confined to individually
               issued prints or series of prints, as distinct from those
               originally included in books or periodicals.</li>
             <li>   In acquiring examples of popular and applied graphic
               arts, the holdings of other institutions in the Washington area are
               to be taken into account so that duplication is generally, though
               not necessarily, avoided.  For example, the Library will not
               normally acquire portraits of American statesmen and public
               figures, as this intrudes upon the collection mission of the
               National Portrait Gallery.</li>
             <li>   The Library acquires on a comprehensive basis American
               and foreign political satires, allegories, and caricatures and
               other types of political prints from the Reformation period to the
               present.</li>
