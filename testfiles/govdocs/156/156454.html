    BEFORE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</strong> </p>
    <p align="center"><em>In the Matter of </em></p>
    <p align="center"><strong>RHODIA</strong>, a corporation,<br>
    <strong>DONAU CHEMIE AG,</strong> a corporation, and<br>
    <strong>ALBRIGHT &amp; WILSON PLC, </strong>a corporation. </p>
    <p align="center">Docket No. C-3930</p>
    <p align="center"><strong>COMPLAINT</strong></p>
    <p>The Federal Trade Commission (&quot;Commission&quot;), having reason to believe that
    Rhodia has entered into an agreement to acquire Albright &amp; Wilson PLC, a wholly-owned
    subsidiary of Donau Chemie AG, and that the acquisition, if consummated, would result in a
    violation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. §&nbsp;45, and
    Section 7 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 18, and it appearing to the Commission that a
    proceeding in respect thereof would be in the public interest, hereby issues its
    complaint, stating its charges as follows:</p>
    <p align="center"><strong>A. THE RESPONDENTS</strong></p>
    <p>1. Respondent Rhodia is a corporation organized, existing, and doing business under and
    by virtue of the laws of France, with its executive offices located at 26, quai Alphonse
    Le Gallo, 92512 Boulogne-Billancourt Cédex, France. Rhodia, among other things, engages
    in the development, manufacture and sale of pure phosphoric acid and phosphate salts,
    primarily in Europe and North America. </p>
    <p>2. Respondent Donau Chemie AG is a corporation organized, existing and doing business
    under and by virtue of the laws of Austria, with its office and principal place of
    business located at Am Heumarkt 10, A-1037, Vienna, Austria. In April 1999, Donau acquired
    Albright &amp; Wilson through a cash tender offer valued at approximately $720 million.</p>
    <p>3. Respondent Albright &amp; Wilson PLC is a corporation organized, existing and doing
    business under and by virtue of the laws of the United Kingdom, with its office and
    principal place of business located at 210-222 Hagley Road West, Oldbury, West Midlands,
    B68 ONN, England. Albright &amp; Wilson, among other things, engages in the worldwide
    development, manufacture and sale of pure phosphoric acid and phosphate salts.</p>
    <p>4. At all times relevant herein, Respondents Rhodia, Donau and Albright &amp; Wilson
    have been and are now engaged in commerce, as &quot;commerce&quot; is defined in Section 1
    of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 12, and are corporations whose business is in or
    affecting commerce as &quot;commerce&quot; is defined in Section 4 of the Federal Trade
    Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. § 44.</p>
    <p align="center"><strong>B. THE PROPOSED ACQUISITIONS</strong></p>
    <p>5. On March 30, 1999, Rhodia and Donau executed two agreements, including a Heads of
    Agreement and a Call Option Agreement. Pursuant to these agreements, Donau acquired,
    through a cash tender offer supported by Rhodia, all of the outstanding voting securities
    of Albright &amp; Wilson, and granted Rhodia an option to acquire from Donau the ownership
    of the Albright &amp; Wilson voting securities. Rhodia currently intends to exercise its
    option to acquire Albright &amp; Wilson, for an aggregate exercise price exceeding $700
    million. </p>
    <p align="center"><strong>C. RELEVANT MARKET</strong></p>
    <p>6. The relevant line of commerce in which to analyze the effects of Rhodia's proposed
    acquisition of Albright &amp; Wilson is the manufacture, marketing and sale of pure
    phosphoric acid. There are no economic substitutes for pure phosphoric acid.</p>
    <p>7. Pure phosphoric acid is a syrupy tribasic acid that is used in a wide variety of
    applications. It is used in food applications, such as cola beverages and pet food, and in
    technical applications, such as cleaning compounds, metal surface treatments, and water
    treatment products. Pure phosphoric acid is sold directly to end users, and also is used
    as an input to create phosphate salts, such as sodium tripolyphosphate. </p>
    <p>8. Pure phosphoric acid is produced in the United States primarily by two different
    methods. The older method is the thermal process, in which producers add water to
    elemental phosphorus. The newer method is the solvent extraction process, in which
    producers use solvents to remove impurities from impure, or &quot;green,&quot; phosphoric
    acid. The solvent extraction process has a cost advantage over the thermal process because
    it is much less energy-intensive.</p>
    <p>9. A small but significant and non-transitory price increase would not affect the
    current level of consumption of pure phosphoric acid in any of the significant end-use
    applications.</p>
    <p>10. The relevant geographic market in which to analyze the effects of Rhodia's proposed
    acquisition of Albright &amp; Wilson is the United States. The level of imports of pure
    phosphoric acid has been small compared to the overall market, and has not been highly
    responsive to changes in United States prices. In fact, prices in the United States have
    historically been much higher than prices in other parts of the world.</p>
    <p>11. There are several reasons why imports of pure phosphoric acid into the United
    States have been limited. One reason is that transportation costs account for a
    significant portion of the delivered cost of phosphoric acid. Another reason is that many
    of the overseas producers employ the older, higher-cost thermal process to produce pure
    phosphoric acid. Other reasons why imports have been limited include access to
    distribution and the cost of terminal storage for product imported from overseas. In
    addition, agreements between producers in the United States and various overseas producers
    have had the effect of limiting the level of competition from these overseas producers.</p>
    <p>12. The overseas producers that have been most active in making sales of pure
    phosphoric acid in the United States have been those that employ the solvent extraction
    process. Nevertheless, the level of sales by these companies has been low. Moreover, these
    overseas producers of pure phosphoric acid have faced significant duties that have limited
    their ability to sell pure phosphoric acid in the United States. These duties have
    increased costs for the overseas producers, and also have chilled sales by the overseas
    producers in the United States.</p>
    <p>D. MARKET STRUCTURE</p>
    <p>13. The United States market for pure phosphoric acid is highly concentrated. Four
    manufacturers, including Rhodia, Albright &amp; Wilson, FMC and Solutia, currently account
    for approximately 95% of the local production capacity that can supply United States
    customers, and 95% of sales of pure phosphoric acid. Albright &amp; Wilson's share of
    direct sales to customers is close to 28%, and Rhodia's share is approximately 11%. The
    proposed acquisition would increase the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index for United States sales
    of pure phosphoric acid by over 630 points, from over 2300 to over 2940. </p>
    <p>14. Rhodia produces pure phosphoric acid using the solvent extraction process at a
    plant in Geismar, Louisiana, which has an annual capacity of approximately 100,000 metric
    tons. It produces pure phosphoric acid via the thermal process at plants in Nashville,
    Tennessee and Morrisville, Pennsylvania. The Nashville plant has an annual capacity of
    over 38,000 metric tons and the Morrisville plant has an annual capacity of over 100,000
    metric tons. Rhodia utilizes the production capacity of the Geismar plant at a much higher
    rate than the two thermal acid plants. Rhodia also produces phosphate salts in several
    different plants. Rhodia sells purified phosphoric acid directly to end-customers, and
    also uses it in the manufacture of phosphate salts.</p>
    <p>15. In 1998, Rhodia had total sales to customers in the United States of over 50
    million pounds of pure phosphoric acid. Rhodia also consumes large amounts of pure
    phosphoric acid internally in the manufacture of phosphate salts. </p>
    <p>16. Albright &amp; Wilson produces pure phosphoric acid via the solvent extraction
    process at one plant in the United States, in Aurora, North Carolina, which is part of a
    joint venture with Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan (&quot;PCS&quot;). The capacity of
    this plant is approximately 155,000 metric tons per year. It produces pure phosphoric acid
    via the thermal acid process at a plant in Charleston, South Carolina, which has a
    capacity of approximately 14,000 metric tons per year. Albright &amp; Wilson also produces
    pure phosphoric acid at a plant in Mexico, which has a capacity of approximately 180,000
    metric tons per year. A&amp;W utilizes the production capacity of the Aurora plant at a
    higher rate than the capacity of the Charleston thermal acid plant. </p>
    <p>17. In 1998, Albright &amp; Wilson had total sales to customers in the United States of
    over 150 million pounds of pure phosphoric acid. Its North American sales of pure
    phosphoric acid totaled over 400 million pounds. Albright &amp; Wilson also consumed large
    amounts of its pure phosphoric acid production internally, to produce a wide range of
    phosphate salts. </p>
    <p>18. Besides Rhodia, Albright &amp; Wilson, FMC and Solutia, two other companies that
    produce pure phosphoric acid in North America for sale in the United States are Earth
    Sciences and Simplot. Earth Sciences and Simplot have each been producing pure phosphoric
    acid for the last two to three years, using processes to manufacture pure phosphoric acid
    different from the other North American producers. Both of these companies have very
    limited production capacity and sales compared to the other four producers, and are
    unlikely to grow their sales substantially in the foreseeable future. </p>
    <p>E. CONDITIONS OF ENTRY</p>
    <p>19. <em>De novo</em> entry or fringe expansion into the relevant market would require a
    substantial sunk investment and a significant period of time, such that new entry would be
    neither timely, likely, nor sufficient.</p>
    <p>20. The minimum viable scale of a pure phosphoric acid production facility likely
    precludes new entry. The prevailing pure phosphoric acid technology demands large-scale
    production, relative to market size, in order to operate efficiently. This technology has
    but a single use -- the production of pure phosphoric acid. It can not economically be
    shifted toward another use. Therefore, all returns on investment must be derived from pure
    phosphoric acid sales. Because economic entry would require that a new producer capture a
    significant market share from existing producers, and because the costs of such entry
    would be sunk, such entry is inherently risky.</p>
    <p align="center"><strong>F. MARKET CHARACTERISTICS THAT FACILITATE COORDINATED
    INTERACTION</strong></p>
    <p>21. The characteristics of the market for pure phosphoric acid facilitate coordinated
    interaction among producers, to the detriment of the purchasers of this product. Among
    such characteristics are:<dl>
      <dd>a. The United States market for pure phosphoric acid is highly concentrated;</dd>
      <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
      <dd>b. Pure phosphoric acid is a highly homogeneous product that is purchased primarily on
        the basis of price;</dd>
      <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
      <dd>c. Reliable pricing information is available from customers, and from other producers
        due to the practice of publicly announcing price increases in advance of their
        implementation;</dd>
      <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
      <dd>d. There is a strong tendency toward coordination among producers of pure phosphoric
        acid. Producers recognize the market to be an oligopoly in which competitive rivalry is
        low; and</dd>
      <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
      <dd>e. Producers tend to refrain from bidding against their competitors at accounts that
        they recognize to be important to the other producers, and, furthermore, undertake
        strategic retaliation at specific accounts as a means to discipline and deter future
        competition.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>G. EFFECTS OF THE PROPOSED ACQUISITION</p>
    <p>22. The effect of the acquisition may be substantially to lessen competition and to
    tend to create a monopoly in the relevant market in violation of Section 7 of the Clayton
    Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. §&nbsp;18, and Section 5 of the FTC Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C.
    §&nbsp;45, in the following ways, among others:<dl>
      <dd>a. It will substantially increase concentration in the market for pure phosphoric acid;</dd>
      <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
      <dd>b. It will significantly enhance the likelihood of coordinated interaction in the
        relevant market among the competitors in the manufacture and sale of pure phosphoric acid;
      </dd>
      <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
      <dd>c. It will increase the likelihood that purchasers of pure phosphoric acid in the
        relevant geographic market will be forced to pay higher prices. In fact, Rhodia's
        documents project higher pure phosphoric acid prices as a result of the proposed
        acquisition of Albright &amp; Wilson.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p align="center"><strong>H. VIOLATIONS CHARGED</strong></p>
    <p>23. The acquisition agreements between Rhodia and Donau, as described in Paragraph 5,
    violate Section 5 of the FTC Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C.§&nbsp;45.</p>
    <p>24. The acquisition of Albright &amp; Wilson by Rhodia, if consummated, would violate
    Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. § 45, and Section 7
    of the Clayton Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. § 18. </p>
    <p>WHEREFORE, THE PREMISES CONSIDERED, the Federal Trade Commission on this thirteenth day
    of March, 2000, issues its complaint against said Respondents.</p>
    <p>By the Commission, Commissioner Thompson dissenting.</p>
