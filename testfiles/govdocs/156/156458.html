 AGENCY: Import Administration, International Trade Administration,
 Commerce.

 ACTION: Notice.

 SUMMARY: We preliminarily determine that certain benefits which constitute subsidies
 within the meaning of the countervailing duty law are being provided to
 manufacturers, producers, or exporters in Belgium of industrial phosphoric acid. The
 estimated net subsidy is 0.65 percent ad valorem. In addition, we preliminarily
 determine that "critical circumstances" do not exist in this case.

 We have notified the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) of our determinations.
 We are directing the U.S. Customs Service to suspend liquidation of all entries of
 industrial phosphoric acid from Belgium that are entered, or withdrawn from
 warehouse, for consumption, on or after the date of publication of this notice, and to
 require a cash deposit or bond or entries of this product in an amount equal to the
 estimated net subsidy as described in the "Suspension of Liquidation" section of this
 notice.

 If this investigation proceeds normally, we will make our final determination by April 14,
 1987.

 EFFECTIVE DATE: February 5, 1987.

 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:Alain Letort of Mark Linscott, Office of
 Investigations, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S.
 Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC
 20230; telephone: 202/377-0186 (Letort) or 202/377-1174 (Linscott).

 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Preliminary Determination

 Based upon our investigation, we preliminarily determine that there is reason to believe
 or suspect that certain benefits which constitute subsidies within the meaning of section
 701 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act), are being provided to manufacturers,
 producers, or exporters of industrial phosphoric acid in Belgium. For purposes of this
 investigation, the following programs are found to confer subsidies to manufacturers,
 producers, or exporters of industrial phosphoric acid in Belgium:
<FONT COLOR="800000"><B> - Capital Grants and Interest Rate Reductions
 - Exemptions from Real Property Taxes</B></FONT>
 We determine the estimated net subsidy to be 0.65 percent ad valorem for all
 manufacturers, producers, or exporters of industrial phosphoric acid in Belgium.

 Case History

 On November 5, 1986, we received a petition in proper form filed by the FMC
 Corporation, of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and the Monsanto Company, of Saint Louis,
 Missouri, on behalf of the U.S. industry producing industrial phosphoric acid.
 In compliance with the filing requirements of section 355.26 of the Commerce
 Regulations (19 CFR 355.26), the petition alleges that manufacturers, producers, or
 exporters in Belgium of industrial phosphoric acid receive, directly or indirectly,
 subsidies within the meaning of section 701 of the Act, and that these imports materially
 injure, or threaten material injury to, a U.S. industry.
 In addition, the petition alleges that "critical circumstances," as defined in section
 703(e)(1) of the Act, exist in this case. We found that the petition contained sufficient
 grounds upon which to initiate a countervailing duty investigation, and on November
 25, 1986, we initiated such an investigation (51 FR 43761, December 4, 1986). We stated
 that we expected to issue a preliminary determination by January 29, 1987.
 Since Belgium is a "country under the Agreement" under section 701(b) of the Act, the
 ITC is required to determine whether imports of the subject merchandise from Belgium
 materially injure, or threaten material injury to, a U.S. industry. Therefore, we notified
 the ITC of our initiation. On December 22, 1986, the ITC determined that there is a
 reasonable indication that an industry in the United States is materially injured by reason
 of imports from Belgium of industrial phosphoric acid (52 FR 612, January 7, 1987).
 On December 5, 1986, we presented a questionnaire to the government of Belgium in
 Washington, DC, concerning the petitioners' allegations, and requested a response by
 January 5, 1987. On December 22, 1986, and again on January 7, 1987, upon request of
 respondents, we granted additional time to submit responses. On January 20, 1987, we
 received responses to our questionnaire from the government of Belgium, the
 Socie>=1te>=1 Re>=1gionale d'Investissement de Wallonie (SRIW), which is an agency of
 the regional government of Wallonia, and from the Socie>=1te>=1 Chimique
 Prayon-Rupel S.A. (SCPR), which is the only known producer and exporter of industrial
 phosphoric acid in Belgium.

 Scope of Investigation

 The product covered by this investigation is industrial phosphoric acid, which is
 currently provided for in item 416.30 of the Tariff Schedules of the United States (TSUS).

 Analysis of Programs

 Throughout this notice, we refer to certain general principles applied to the facts of the
 current investigation. These principles are described in the "Subsidies Appendix" attached
 to the notice of "Cold-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat- Rolled Products from Argentina; Final
 Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination and Countervailing Duty Order"
 (49 FR 18006, April 26, 1984).
 Consistent with our practice in preliminary determinations, when a response to an
 allegation denies the existence of a program, receipt of benefits under a program, or
 eligibility of a company or industry under a program, and the Department has no
 persuasive evidence showing that the response is incorrect, we accept the response for
 purposes of the preliminary determination. All such responses are subject to verification.
 If the response cannot be supported at verification, and the program is otherwise
 countervailable, the program will be considered a subsidy in the final detemination.
 For purposes of this preliminary determination, the period for which we are measuring
 subsidization ("the review period") is calendar year 1985, which coincides with SCPR's
 fiscal year. In their responses, the government of Belgium, SRIW, and SCPR provided
 data, including financial statements, for the applicable period.
 Based upon our analysis of the petition and the responses to our questionnaire, we
 preliminarily determine the following:

 I. Programs Preliminarily Determined to Confer a Subsidy

 We preliminarily determine that subsidies are being provided to manufacturers,
 producers, or exporters 

<B>*3682</B>

 of industrial phosphoric acid in Belgium under the
 following programs.
<a name="IA"></a>
<FONT COLOR="800000"><B> A. Programs Created by the 1970 Economic Expansion Law (EEL)</B></FONT>

 Under the Economic Expansion Law (EEL) of December 30, 1970, the Belgian
 government offers incentives to promote sectoral and technological development in
 designated development areas and in adjoining industrial sites. The provisions of the EEL
 are implemented and administered by regional authorities. Under the EEL the following
 benefits may be provided: Capital grants or interest rate reductions; loan guarantees;
 accelerated depreciation; real property, capital registration and capital gains tax
 exemptions; contractual aid and employment premiums. Companies which invest in
 development areas and which contribute directly to the creation, extension or
 conversion of industrial and service-related establishments pursuant to the general
 economic interest of the country are eligible to participate in these programs.
<a name="IA1"></a>
<FONT COLOR="800000"><B> 1. Capital Grants and Interest Rate Reductions.</B></FONT> Companies which finance qualifying
 investments under the EEL through approved credit institutions may receive up to a
 seven percent reduction in the interest rate payable on 75 percent of the total cost of
 investment, so long as the effective rate does not fall below one percent per annum.
 For those companies which finance at least 50 percent of the investment from their own
 funds, the interest rate reduction may be wholly or partly replaced by a nonrefundable
 capital grant of an equivalent amount. Because benefits received under this federal
 program are limited to companies within certain regions, we preliminarily determine the
 capital grants to be countervailable.
 SCPR'S plant at Puurs, the only plant producing industrial grade phosphoric acid for sale
 to all markets, is not located in a development area and has never received benefits under
 this program. According to the responses, SCPR's plant at Engis was located in a
 development area and received two capital grants in 1985. All of the Engis plant's
 production of industrial phosphoric acid is for captive use (i.e., it is consumed internally
 by SCPR to manufacture other products). Although industrial phosphoric acid produced
 by the Engis plant is not currently sold to any market, we find no evidence in the
 responses that industrial phosphoric acid produced at Engis differs in any respect from
 that produced at Puurs, nor any evidence that industrial phosphoric acid produced in the
 Engis plant could not be exported to the United States. Accordingly, to the extent that
 SCPR's production of industrial phosphoric acid has benefited under this program,
 regardless of the fact that benefits were conveyed to the Engis plant rather than to the
 Puurs plant, we find that these benefits accure to all production of industrial phosphoric
 acid.
 To calculate the benefits, we allocated the grants received in 1985 over ten years, which is
 the average useful life of renewable physical assets in the chemical manufacturing
 industry, as determined under the U.S. Internal Revenue Service's Asset Depreciation
 Range System. Because SCPR obtained no new loans during the year in which it received
 the grants, we used as our discount rate the average rate charged by commercial banks in
 Belgium to their prime borrowers in 1985. Applying the grant methodology and
 dividing by the f.o.b. value of total sales by SCPR during the review period, we calculated
 an estimated net subsidy of 0.54 percent ad valorem.
<a name="IA2"></a>
<FONT COLOR="800000"><B> 2. Exemption from Real Property Tax</B></FONT>. Companies which make qualifying investments
 pursuant to the EEL in designated development areas may be exempted from national,
 provincial and local real property taxes for a period of up to five years. Because benefits
 received under this federal program are limited to companies within certain regions, we
 preliminarily determine real property tax exemptions to be countervailable.
 Due to its location in a development area, SCPR's plant at Engis has been exempt from
 paying a combined real property tax rate of 37.9 percent for investments it has made in
 Engis. To the extent that SCPR's production of industrial phosphoric acid has benefited
 under this program, regardless of the fact that benefits were conveyed to the Engis plant
 rather than to the Puurs plant, we find these benefits to accure to all production of
 industrial phosphoric acid.
 To calculate the benefits, we divided the amounts reported in the responses as exempted
 in 1985 by the f.o.b. value of total sales by SCPR during the review period. Using our usual
 tax methodology, the benefit would be that amount reported in the tax return filed during
 the review period. According to SCPR's response, the government does not notify the
 taxpayer of its real property tax liability until the year following the year covered by the
 tax liability. Because we did not have the tax exemption for the 1984 tax liability, which
 would have been actually reported by government tax authorities during the review
 period in 1985, we have used as best information available, the exemption for the 1985
 tax liability reported in 1986. Using this methodology, we calculated an estimated net
 subsidy of 0.11 percent ad valorem.
 The remaining benefits under the EEL are discussed in the "Programs Preliminarily
 Determined Not to Be Used" section of this notice.

 II. Programs Preliminarily Determined not to Confer a Subsidy

 We preliminarily determine that subsidies are not being provided to manufacturers,
 producers, or exporters of industrial phosphoric acid in Belgium under the following
 programs.
<a name="IIA"></a>
<FONT COLOR="800000"><B> A. Investment in SCPR by SRIW</B></FONT>

 Petitioners allege that the Societe Regionale d'Investissement de Wallonie
 (SRIW), an agency of the regional government of Wallonia, played a crucial role in
 liquidating the former holding company Societe de Prayon (SP) and its
 manufacturing subsidiary Societe Industrielle de Prayon (SIP), and reorganizing
 them into the Societe Chimique Prayon-Rupel S.A. (SCPR), the current producer
 and exporter in Belgium of the subject merchandise. Petitioners further allege that
 SRIW's equity investment in SCPR was made on terms inconsistent with commercial
 considerations.
 In its response, SRIW states that it carries out two types of activities: (1) Equity
 investments made on behalf of and under the direction of the regional government of
 Wallonia with funds transferred to it by that government; and (2) equity investments
 aimed at promoting the economy of the region, made with SRIW's own funds, without any
 direction, advice, or prior approval from the regional government of Wallonia or the
 government of Belgium. SRIW's investment in SCPR falls into the second category.
 Under the law of April 2, 1962, governing regional investment companies, SRIW is
 required to seek a "normal return" on the second category of investments and to apply
 rules of "sound management." In order to avoid confusion between the two types of
 investments, SRIW set up in 1985 a wholly owned subsidiary called SOWAGEP, whose
 purpose is to act, in lieu of SRIW, as a representative of the regional government of
 Wallonia with respect to investments by that government.
 With respect to SRIW's investment in SCPR, SRIW and SCPR state that SCPR is not SP or
 SIP reorganized, but rather a separate firm. According to the responses, SP and SIP filed
 for bankruptcy in 1981 under normal Belgian procedures comparable to Chapter XI
 proceedings in the United States. After SP and SIP were placed in receivership, SRIW
 formed a joint venture with a private Belgian industrial consortium, a Moroccan
 phosphate company, and a private French engineering firm. This joint venture was named
 Socie>=1te>=1 Chimique Prayon-Rupel S.A. (SCPR). SCPR then purchased certain assets
 of the former SP and SIP from the court-appointed receiver.
 In order to determine whether SRIW's equity investment in SCPR was made on terms
 inconsistent with commercial considerations, we analyzed the terms of this investment in
 light of normal commercial practices. We do not find this transaction inconsistent with
 commercial considerations for the following reasons.
 First, SRIW is only a minority shareholder in SCPR. SRIW purchased its equity in SCPR on
 the same terms and conditions, at the same price, and at the same time as the private
 shareholders, which constitutes a prima facie indication that SRIW's investment was
 consistent with commercial considerations.
 Second, at the time the joint venture was set us (late in 1981), the shareholders in the joint
 venture had every expectation that SCPR would return a profit, as evidenced by the
 shareholders' agreement which shows SCPR's anticipated stream of profits and rates of
 return on equity. SCPR purchased only those assets of SP and SIP it believed could return
 a profit, i.e., the plants at Engis and Puurs. The sizable share of foreign and private
 investment in the joint venture is another indication of anticipated profitability.
 Third, SRIW states that its investment in SCPR was made with its own funds, and not at the
 direction of the regional government of Wallonia. As noted above, where SRIW makes an
 equity investment with its own funds, it is required by law to obtain a "normal return" on
 its investment.
 For the reasons stated above, we preliminarily determine that SRIW's investment in SCPR
 was not made on terms inconsistent with commercial considerations, and, therefore, does
 not confer a subsidy on industrial phosphoric acid from Belgium.
<a name="IIB"></a>
<FONT COLOR="800000"><B> B. 1985 Equity Infusion by SRIW into SCPR</B></FONT>

 Petitioners allege that SCPR's capital stock increase by its shareholders in 1985 was
 inconsistent with commercial considerations because the company was clearly not an
 attractive investment opportunity at that time.
 In order to determine whether the 1985 equity infusion was made on terms inconsistent
 with commercial considerations, we followed the same methodology as for the original
 equity investment into SCPR and analyzed this infusion in light of normal commercial
 practices. We do not find this transaction inconsistent with commercial considerations
 because (1) SCPR's private shareholders also contributed to the increase in capital stock
 on the same terms and conditions as SRIW, which constitutes a prima facie indication that
 SRIW's investment was consistent with commercial considerations, and (2) SCPR reported
 profits in each of the three years preceding the 1985 equity infusion.
 Accordingly, we preliminarily determine that SRIW's equity infusion into SCPR in 1985
 does not confer a subsidy on industrial phosphoric acid from Belgium.

 III. Programs Preliminarily Determined not to be Used

 We preliminarily determine that the following programs were not used by the
 manufacturers, producers, or exporters of industrial phosphoric acid in Belgium during
 the review period.
<a name="IIIA"></a>
<FONT COLOR="800000"><B> A. Preferential Loans</B></FONT>

 Petitioners allege that SCPR may have benefited from loans made on terms inconsistent
 with commercial considerations by the Socie>=1te>=1 Nationale de Cre>=1dit a>=2
 l'Industrie (SNCI), which is a primary government-controlled lender to industrial and
 commercial enterprises in Belgium. In its response, SCPR states that it has never applied
 for nor received loans from SNCI.
<a name="IIIB"></a>
<FONT COLOR="800000"><B> B. Employment-Based Benefits</B></FONT>

 Petitioners allege that SCPR may have received funds for employee training programs and
 other employment-based benefits from the Office National de l'Emploi. In its response,
 SCPR states that it has never applied for nor received such benefits.
<an ame="IIIC"></a>
<FONT COLOR="800000"><B> C. Programs Created by the 1970 Economic Expansion Law (EEL)</B></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="800000"><B> 1. Loan Guarantees.</B></FONT> The government may gurantee loans made or bonds issued for the
 financing of investments which realize the objectives set forth in the EEL. If a loan was not
 granted by a public credit organization, or if a bond was not acquired or subscribed by a
 public-sector institution, the guarantee is limited to 75 percent of the amount due after
 realization of any collateral security. According to the responses, SCPR received no
 guarantees under this program.
<a name="IIIC2"></a>
<FONT COLOR="800000"><B> 2. Accelerated Depreciation</B></FONT>. Companies qualified for governmental aid under the EEL
 may depreciate investments in plants, equipment and industrial buildings at double the
 rate allowed for normal straight-line depreciation. Accelerated depreciation benefits may
 be utilized for three successive tax periods, to be agreed upon and embodied in an aid
 contract. According to the responses, SCPR has not claimed accelerated depreciation
 under this program.
<a name="IIIC3"></a>
<FONT COLOR="800000"><B> 3. Exemption from Capital Registration Tax. Subscriptions or contri</B>butions to the capital</FONT>
 of companies vested with legal personality and incorporated to act in accordance with the
 intentions of the EEL are exempted from payment of the capital registration tax.
 According to the responses, SCPR received no exemptions under this program.
<a name="IIIC4"></a>
<FONT COLOR="800000"><B> 4. Employment Premiums</B></FONT>. Investments made pursuant to the EEL that create new jobs in
 development areas entitle the employer to a non-repayable grant. The magnitude of
 payment varies according to the number of jobs created. According to the responses,
 SCPR received no employment premiums under this program.
<a name="IIIC5"></a>
<FONT COLOR="800000"><B> 5. Contractual Aid</B></FONT>. The EEL provides aid in the form of contracts awarded to firms making
 investments that promote economic, technological, industrial and/or commercial
 development within development areas. Specific types of aid include progress contracts,
 administrative promotion contracts, technological promotion contracts and contracts
 for the conversion or restructuring of operations. According to the responses, SCPR was
 awarded no contracts under this program.
<a name="IIIC6"></a>
<FONT COLOR="800000"><B> 6. Exemption from Capital Gains Tax</B></FONT>. Capital gains invested in development areas under
 the EEL are exempt from the Belgium capital gains tax, if invested within a year
 following the close of the tax year in which the gain is realized. According to the
 responses, SCPR received no capital gains tax exemptions under this program.
<a name="IIID"></a>
<FONT COLOR="800000"><B> D. Operating Subsidies</B></FONT>

 Petitioners allege that SCPR's annual reports for 1984 and 1985 show that the company
 received certain unspecified "operating subsidies." In its response, SCPR states that the
 "operating subsidies" in question consisted of certain research and development grants
 awarded by IRSIA, an agency of the government of Belgium, for 

<B>*3683</B>

 laboratory
 research wholly unrelated to industrial phosphoric acid. Because these grants did not
 benefit the production of industrial phosphoric acid, we preliminarily determine that
 these grants were not used in this case.

 Critical Circumstances

 Petitioners allege that "critical circumstances" exist with respect to imports of industrial
 phosphoric acid from Belgium. Under section 703(e)(1) of the Act, critical
 circumstances exist when the Department has a reasonable basis to believe or suspect
 that (1) the alleged subsidy is inconsistent with the Agreement on Interpretation and
 Application of Articles VI, XVI, and XXIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
 (the Subsidies Code), and (2) there have been massive imports of the class or kind of
 merchandise which is the subject of the investigation over a relatively short period.
 Section 355.29(a) of the Commerce Regulations [19 CFR 355.29(a)] on critical
 circumstances provides, inter alia, that we will determine "whether the alleged subsidy is
 an export subsidy inconsistent with the Agreement" (emphasis added). Thus, under
 existing regulations, a subsidy may be viewed as inconsistent with the Agreement only if
 it is an export subsidy.
 Based upon our analysis, no export subsidies inconsistent with the Subsidies Code are
 being bestowed upon industrial phosphoric acid from Belgium. Therefore, we do not
 need to address the issue of whether there have been massive imports of industrial
 phosphoric acid from Belgium over a relatively short period. Accordingly, we
 preliminarily determine that "critical circumstances" do not exist with respect to
 industrial phosphoric acid from Belgium.

 Verification

 In accordance with section 776(a) of the Act, we will verify the data used in making our
 final determination. We will not accept any statement in a response that cannot be
 verified for our final determination.

 Suspension of Liquidation

 In accordance with section 703(d) of the Act, we are directing the U.S. Customs Service
 to suspend liquidation of all entries of industrial phosphoric acid from Belgium which
 are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption, on or after the date of
 publication of this notice in the Federal Register, and to require a cash depisit or bond
 equal to 0.65 percent ad volorem for each such entry of this merchandise. This
 suspension will remain in effect until further notice.

 ITC Notification

 In accordance with section 703(c) of the Act, we will notify the ITC of our determination.
 In addition, we are making available to the ITC all nonprivileged and nonproprietary
 information relating to this investigation. We will allow the ITC access to all privileged
 and proprietary information in our files, provided the ITC confirms that it will not
 disclose such information, either publicly or under an administrative protective order,
 without the written consent of the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Import Administration.
 If our final determination is affirmative, the ITC will determine whether these imports
 materially injure, or threaten material injury to, a U.S. industry within 45 days after the
 Department makes its final determination.

 Public Comment

 In accordance with § 355.35 of the Commerce Regulations (19 CFR 355.35) we will hold a
 public hearing, if requested, to afford interested parties an opportunity to comment on
 this preliminary determination, at 1:00 p.m. on March 3, 1987, at the U.S. Department of
 Commerce, Room 3708, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC
 20230. Individuals who wish to participate in the hearing must submit a request to the
 Deputy Assistant Secretary, Import Administration, Room B-099, at the above address
 within 10 days of the publication of this notice in the Federal Register.
 Requests should contain: (1) The party's name, address, and telephone number; (2) the
 number of participants; (3) the reason for attending; and (4) a list of the issues to be
 discussed. In addition, at least 10 copies of the proprietary version and seven copies of
 the nonproprietary version of the pre-hearing briefs must be submitted to the Deputy
 Assistant Secretary by February 24, 1987. Oral presentations will be limited to issues
 raised in the briefs. In accordance with 19 CFR 355.33(d) and 19 CFR 355.34, all written
 views will be considered if received not less than 30 days before the final determination is
 due, or, if a hearing is held, within 10 days after the hearing transcript is available.
 This determination is published pursuant to section 703(f) of the Act [19 U.S.C. 1671b(f)].
