       <STRONG><H2><CENTER>ITC WILL CONDUCT FULL "SUNSET" REVIEWS CONCERNING 
          INDUSTRIAL PHOSPHORIC ACID FROM ISRAEL AND BELGIUM</CENTER></H2></STRONG>


The U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) today voted to conduct full five-year
("sunset") reviews concerning the countervailing duty order on industrial phosphoric acid
from Israel (Inv. No. 701-TA-286 (Review)) and the antidumping duty order on industrial
phosphoric acid from Belgium (Inv. No. 731-TA-365 (Review)).<P> 

As a result of today's votes, the Commission will conduct full reviews to determine whether
revocation of the countervailing duty and antidumping duty orders on these products would
be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of material injury within a reasonably
foreseeable time.  The Commission's reviews in these cases will be completed no later than
February 24, 2000, unless extended.<P>

The Uruguay Round Agreements Act requires the Department of Commerce to revoke an
antidumping or countervailing duty order, or terminate a suspension agreement, after five
years unless the Department of Commerce and the ITC determine that revoking the order or
terminating the suspension agreement would be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of
dumping or subsidies (Commerce) and of material injury (ITC) within a reasonably
foreseeable time.  Reviews of outstanding antidumping and countervailing duty orders in
existence as of January 1, 1995, began in July 1998.<P> 

The Commission's institution notice in five-year reviews requests that interested parties file
responses with the Commission concerning the likely effects of revoking the order as well as
other information.  Generally within 95 days from institution, the Commission will determine
whether the responses it has received reflect an adequate or inadequate level of interest in a
full review.  If responses to the ITC's notice of institution are adequate, or if other
circumstances warrant a full review, the Commission conducts a full review, which includes
a public hearing and issuance of questionnaires.<P>

The Commission's determinations to conduct full reviews resulted as follows.<P>

With regard to industrial phosphoric acid from both countries, Chairman Lynn M. Bragg,
Vice Chairman Marcia E. Miller, and Commissioners Carol T. Crawford, Jennifer A.
Hillman, Stephen Koplan, and Thelma J. Askey concluded that both the domestic and the
respondent group responses for these reviews were adequate and voted for full reviews.<P>  

A record of the Commission's votes on these matters is available from the Office of the
Secretary, U.S. International Trade Commission, 500 E Street SW, Washington, DC  20436. 
Requests may be made by telephone by calling 202-205-1802.<P>

The record of the Commission's votes is also posted on the ITC's Internet server at
<EM>www.usitc.gov</EM> (under "Five-Year (Sunset) Reviews"/"Five-Year Reviews
Listing"/"Industrial Phosphoric Acid from Israel" and "Industrial Phosphoric Acid from
Belgium").<P>

The <EM>Federal Register</EM> notice will indicate whether any further information or statements will
be available.  The Commission will issue a report after it completes its reviews.<P>
