                            PHOSPHATE ROCK

             (Data in thousand metric tons, unless noted)

Domestic Production and Use:  Phosphate rock ore was mined by 10 firms in 4 States,
and upgraded into an estimated 45.5 million metric tons of marketable product valued
at about $1 billion, f.o.b. mine.  Florida and North Carolina accounted for about 85%
of total domestic output, with the remainder produced in southeastern Idaho and
northwestern Utah.  Approximately 88% of U.S. phosphate rock demand was for
conversion into wet-process phosphoric acid and superphosphoric acid used principally
as intermediates in the manufacture of granular and liquid ammonium phosphate
fertilizers for domestic consumption and export.  About 50% of U.S. wet-process
phosphoric acid production was consumed for exports in the form of upgraded granular
diammonium and monoammonium phosphate fertilizer materials, triple superphosphate
fertilizer, and as merchant grade phosphoric acid.  Industrial applications accounted
for about 6% of U.S. phosphate rock demand, while another 6% was directly exported,
principally to countries in the Far East and Western Europe.  Calcium phosphate
animal feed supplements, essential to livestock nutrition, were derived from
defluorinated phosphoric acid and defluorinated phosphate rock, while purified
phosphoric acid was used in a variety of industrial applications.  Phosphate rock was
mined by three western firms as feedstock for high-purity, industrial-grade elemental
phosphorus manufacture in wholly owned electric furnace facilities in Idaho and
Montana.  Hydrofluosilicic acid and oxides of uranium and vanadium were recovered as
value added byproducts of phosphate manufacture.

                            PHOSPHATE ROCK

Events, Trends, and Issues:  The U.S. phosphate industry continued to experience
favorable economic trends in 1995, associated with a sustained period of supply-demand 
balance that commenced during 1994.  Phosphate rock mines were operating at
90% of capacity and wet-process phosphoric acid and elemental phosphorus plants at
near 100% owing to favorable demand.  Ammonium phosphate plants operated at 95% of
capacity to satisfy strong export demand.  U.S. planted crop acreage and domestic
fertilizer consumption are expected to increase significantly between 1995 and 1996
owing to below normal grain inventories at the domestic and global levels.  Balanced
phosphate supply-demand conditions at the global level were favored by a combination
of restricted production and relatively low grain inventories.

Major restructuring of the domestic phosphate industry continued into 1995, as
evidenced by the acquisition and consolidation of mines and plants in North Carolina
and northern Florida by a major Canadian potash firm, together with the acquisition
and consolidation of a new mining operation in central Florida by an existing U.S.
phosphate producer.  In a related move, an emerging force in the fertilizer industry
based in western Canada purchased a phosphate fertilizer production facility and
phosphate rock reserves near Soda Springs, ID.  A new 3.2-million-ton-per-year mine
at South Pasture in Hardee County, FL, commenced operations in the fall of 1995. 
Production from the new mine supplied phosphate rock to a wholly owned conversion
facility at Plant City, FL.

World phosphate rock production increased substantially compared with output in 1994.

World Resources:  Phosphate rock resources occur principally as sedimentary marine
phosphorites.  Significant igneous occurrences are found in Russia and South Africa. 
Large phosphate resources have been identified on the continental shelves and on sea
mounts in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.

Substitutes:  There are no substitutes for phosphorus in agriculture.
