Description of data :
Stable isotopic analyses were done at the University of Michigan.  
Powdered coralline aragonite samples (~ 100 mg) were vacuum roasted for one hour 
at 200°C before isotopic analysis.  Samples were reacted with anhydrous phosphoric 
acid at 75°C in individual reaction vessels of a CarboKiel carbonate extraction system 
coupled to the inlet of a MAT 251 mass spectrometer.   Precision (± 1 s) was monitored 
by daily analyses of a powdered calcite standard (NBS-20), and was better than 0.08‰ 
for both carbon and oxygen.  Values are reported in standard d notation relative to the 
Chicago PDB standard.  Ages were derived from annual density banding.
