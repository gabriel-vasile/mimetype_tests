1.	Data Set Overview

1.1	Data Set Identification

BOREAS TGB-05 Dissolved Organic Carbon Data from NSA Beaver Ponds

1.2	Data Set Introduction

Organic matter is a major component of the boreal forest ecosystem, and can be 
considered as the defining parameter for biogeochemical processes occurring in the 
soil, wetlands, ponds, and lakes in the boreal forest.  Beaver ponds are common in 
the boreal forest, and dissolved organic matter (DOM) is the dominant aquatic 
component.

1.3	Objective/Purpose

Trace Gas Biogeochemistry Team 5 (TGB-05) studied the character of DOM from an 
active beaver pond near Thompson, Manitoba, Canada, in conjunction with the BOReal 
Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS) project.  This study spans the entire 
hydrologic cycle in 1994 from snowmelt and ice breakup through the spring flood, 
summer growing season and autumn draw down.

1.4  Summary of Parameters

Dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), particulate 
organic carbon (POC), and DOM fractions (see Section 18).

1.5 Discussion 

Water samples were collected throughout the BOREAS sampling periods described 
above for all open water sites (including some earlier samples that were under 
ice) and from inflow, groundwater, and drainage sites.  These samples were 
analyzed in a timely manner at a field lab in Thompson for various aquatic carbon 
species, as described in Sections 1.4 and 7.

3. Theory of Measurements: 

Chemical measurements were made on water samples.  Dissolved carbon analyses were 
made using a Dohrmann DC-190 Carbon Analyzer.  This instrument uses the High 
Temperature Catalytic Oxidation (HTCO) method to determine total carbon (TC) and 
organic carbon (DOC) species, and acidification and sparging for inorganic carbon 
(DIC) species.  An alternate method of measuring DIC, the difference method (see 
below), was used for all 1994 samples.  The quartz oxidation tube was filled with 
a catalyst made of platinum on alumina beads and placed in a furnace set at 900 
degrees C; the carrier gas was Ultra High Purity Zero Air from Canox at 200 
mL/min.  The detector on this instrument is a Milton Roy Model 3300 nondispersive 
infrared (NDIR) gas analyzer (Mfg: Fuji Electric), which is a single beam detector 
with a wide dynamic range. The instrument was used mostly in the automatic 
sampling mode (ASM), but occasionally manual injection was used.  TC analyses were 
done on whole filtered samples, DOC was determined after acidification (pH <4 
using 20% phosphoric acid) and sparging (5 minutes with carrier) to remove DIC and 
DIC was determined by the difference: TC - DOC = DIC.

POC was determined by HTCO on filters using a CHN Analyzer after acidification to 
remove solid carbonates (done by Environment Canadaís National Laboratory for 
Environmental Testing, Burlington, ON).

4.1.5 Principles of Operation

Dissolved Carbon analyses were made using a Dohrmann DC-190 Carbon Analyzer.  
This instrument uses the High Temperature Catalytic Oxidation (HTCO) method to 
determine total (TC) and organic carbon (DOC) species, and acidification and 
sparging for inorganic carbon (DIC) species.  An alternate measurement of DIC, 
the difference method (see below) was used for all 1994 samples.  The quartz 
oxidation tube was filled with a catalyst made of Platinum on Alumina beads, 
placed in a furnace set at 900 degrees C, and the carrier gas was Ultra High 
Purity Zero Air from Canox at 200 mL/min.

4.2 Calibration

4.2.1 Specifications

The DC-190 uses a single-point calibration method.  This is possible because of 
the wide dynamic range of the detector and the stable, closely spaced calibration 
curves stored in the instrument by the factory.  Calibrations for TC and DOC were 
done using fresh dilutions of Potassium Biphthalate (KHP), primary standard grade, 
diluted with E-Pure water (Barnstead).  System blanks were calculated by 
regressing results from low ppm range standards; the intercept of a true value vs. 
measured value was called the system blank and was subtracted from each analysis.  
The calibration factor was updated for each set of 32 samples, and system blank 
samples were included within each set.

Under the conditions described above, system blanks were typically between 1-2 
mgC/L.  Note that much of this is probably attributable to residual carbon in the 
E-Pure water, as carbon-free water was unattainable.  Under these conditions, the 
system blank correction is probably higher than the actual system blank.  Under 
the high TC and DOC conditions found for the waters in the Northern Study Area 
(NSA), the system blank accounts for 4-8% of the measured values, and the over 
correction could be as high as 3-6%.  Without "carbon-free water," this could not 
be improved.

None given.

4.2.2 Frequency of Calibration

5. Data Acquisition Methods

The DC-190 uses internal algorithms to calculate carbon concentrations that are

7. Data Description

7.1 Spatial Characteristics

7.1.1 Spatial Coverage

All of the data in this set are results of analyses of water samples taken from 
the NSA Tower Beaver Pond Site (TP) including its groundwater inputs, open water 
sites on the pond, and its inflow and outflow creeks.

All site designations are TP for this data set.  Sub-designations refer to the 
specific location within the TP watershed where the water sample was taken:

P1-P10 - Ten refers to 10 open water sites on the Beaver Pond. Site P1 is the 
         "main" site and is at the deepest part of the pond.
PL, B3 - Sites along the boardwalk to the tower platform.
OD, UD - Sampled from over and under the main (east) dam.
NOD    - Sampled from over the dam on the older pond to the north of TP.
WD     - Sampled from the footbridge at the west dam outlet.
D, D2  - Sampled from the Highway 391 (100 m from road) end of the drainage creeks 
         that flow from the west and east dams, respectively.
I1, I2, I3 - Inflow creeks on the south end of the pond, sampled at their mouths.  
             I3 is the main inflow of surface water to the pond.
SM     - Snowmelt collected during the thaw period.
FP, C, H - Samples from intermittent surface inflows along the southwest, south, 
           and southeast perimeter of TP.  These flowed only occasionally after 
           rain events during the thaw period. 
SZ(S), SZ(M), SZ(D) - Shallow, Middle, and Deep piezometers (wells) from a nest 
                      adjacent to TP at the west end of the main (east) dam.
NZ(S), NZ(M), NZ(D) - Shallow, Middle, and Deep piezometers (wells) from a nest 
                      adjacent to the older pond to the north of TP and also near 
                      the west end of the old dam.
NZDP1, NZDP2 - The first and second pools of groundwater collected from the NZ(D) 
               piezometer over a number of days during Focused field Campaign-Thaw 
               (FFC-T) and Intensive Field Campaign (IFC)-1.
HOLE - Water sampled through a hole in the ice adjacent to the boardwalk, 
       equivalent to B3 under ice conditions.
Sample Depth - All surface samples were taken at approximately 10 cm depth.  Other 
               depths refer to the measured depths from the pond surface and 
               piezometer depths are the deepest part of the interval sampled.  
               The shallowest depth for any well is the deepest interval for the 
               well above, and zero for the shallow wells.

All of the data in this set are results of analyses of water samples taken from 
the NSA Gillam Road Beaver Pond Site including its groundwater inputs, open 
water sites on the pond, and its inflow and outflow creeks.

All site designations are NSA Gillam Road Beaver Pond Site for this data set.

9. Data Manipulations

9.1 Formulae

Some formulae were used in DOM fraction calculations prior to input into the data 
set - see Section 17, References.

9.1.1 Derivation Techniques and Algorithms

None given. 

9.2 Data Processing Sequence

9.2.1 Processing Steps

None given.

9.2.2 Processing Changes

None given.

9.3 Calculations

9.3.1 Special Corrections/Adjustments

All FA data are corrected for the average ëfilter blankí for the entire season. 
Difference calculations for DIC, HA, HPON, and X4AC occasionally resulted in 
small negative values, which were edited to zero.

9.3.2 Calculated Variables

None given.

9.4 Graphs and Plots

None given.

10. Errors

10.1 Sources of Error

The system blank for the Dohrmann DC-190 is the main source of error, but since 
carbon values are generally greater than 10 mgC/L, the correction is rarely more 
than 10% of the value and usually less than 5%.

10.2 Quality Assessment

10.2.1 Data Validation by Source

All carbon determinations reported are averages of 3 (TC) or 4 (DOC) replicate 
analyses on the Dohrmann DC-190.

10.2.2 Confidence Level/Accuracy Judgment

None given.

10.2.3 Measurement Error for Parameters

The precision for TC was typically +/- 0.8 mgC/L at the 50 mgC/L level and for 
DOC a precision of +/- 0.5 mgC/L was typical at the 25 mgC/L level.

10.2.4 Additional Quality Assessments

A few obvious outlier values were deleted from the data set.  These samples had 
very high DOC or TC values that resulted from contamination during sampling.

10.2.5 Data Verification by Data Center

Data were examined for general consistency and clarity.

11. Notes

11.1 Limitations of the Data

Not all parameters were determined for all samples, and not all sites were 
covered for all dates.  See above descriptions.

11.2 Known Problems with the Data

System blanks were typically between 1-2 mgC/L.  Note that much of this is 
probably attributable to residual carbon in the E-Pure water, as carbon-free 
water was unattainable.  Under these conditions, the system blank correction is 
probably higher than the actual system blank.  Under the high TC and DOC 
conditions found for the waters in the NSA, the system blank accounts for 4-8% 
of the measured values, and the overcorrection could be as high as 3-6%.  
Without carbon-free water, this could not be improved.

11.3 Usage Guidance

Note that the definition of HA used here is more like the traditional soil 
science definition and differs from that used by many aquatic scientists (see 
references).  Note that DIC by difference is subject to more error than DIC 
measured directly.

11.4 Other Relevant Information

None given.

12. Application of the Data Set

This data set was created for BOREAS investigators who need soils data in the 
vicinity of the NSA for further modeling and to generate maps of carbon stocks 
and fluxes.
