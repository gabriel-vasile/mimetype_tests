	MASTER TESTING LIST - 1992 

	Introduction

	The Master Testing List (MTL) is an important component of the Existing Chemicals Program (ECP) in EPA's Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics.  The ECP is responsible for assessing and managing health and environmental risks that may be posed by "existing" chemicals.  For more information about the ECP refer to Appendix I (EPA's Existing Chemicals Program - An Overview.)

	EPA has been using the MTL since 1990 to set its chemical testing agenda.  Section 4 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) gives EPA the authority to require chemical manufacturers and processors to test chemicals.  Under Section 4, EPA has the authority to require testing after finding that (1) a chemical substance may present an unreasonable risk of injury to human health or the environment, or the chemical is produced in substantial quantities which could result in significant or substantial human or environmental exposure, and (2) available data to evaluate the chemical are inadequate, and (3) testing is needed to develop the necessary data.  EPA's Chemical Testing Program also continues to work with industry to develop test data by way of consent orders and voluntary testing agreements.

	The purposes of the MTL are to (1) identify chemical testing needs of the Federal Government (including EPA) and international programs of interest to the U.S., (2) focus limited EPA resources on the highest priority chemical testing needs, (3) identify and publicize EPA's testing priorities for industrial chemicals, (4) obtain broad public comment on EPA's Chemical Testing Program and its priorities, and (5) encourage initiatives by industry to provide EPA with the priority data needs identified on the MTL.

	Since 1990, EPA has (1) added 222 specific chemicals and 9 categories to the MTL, (2) deleted 45 chemicals from the MTL, (3) proposed testing for 113 chemicals via proposed rulemaking under TSCA Section 4; (4) required testing for 6 specific chemicals and 1 category (carpet/carpet products) via final TSCA Section 4 test rules, negotiated consent orders or voluntary testing agreements, and (5) made risk assessment/management decisions on 41 chemicals based on final TSCA Section 4 test results received.  Further, 159 chemicals listed on the MTL are now being tested under the Screening Information Data Set (SIDS) program, an international voluntary testing program developed under the aegis of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).  Members of the U.S. chemical industry have agreed to test 39 of these chemical substances while other OECD member countries are testing the remainder.  This effort addresses the testing needs for international high production volume chemicals.
	The MTL now contains over 320 specific chemicals and 9 categories and presents EPA's Chemical Testing Program priorities for 1992-1994.


 I.   ADDITIONS TO THE MTL

  A. Specific Chemical Substances

	The 222 chemicals added to the MTL are as follows:

  o	106 chemicals from the OECD's SIDS testing program;

  o	14 chemicals designated by the Interagency Testing Committee (ITC) in its 27th and 28th Reports;

  o	66 chemicals from the "Glycidol and Glycidol Derivatives" category designated by the ITC in its 3rd Report and which were the subject of a proposed TSCA Section 4 test rule   (56 FR 57144; November 7, 1991);

  o	12 chemicals from the "Aryl Phosphates" category designated by the ITC in its 2nd Report and the subject of a proposed TSCA Section 4 test rule (57 FR 2138; January 7, 1992);

  o	12 chemicals from the proposed TSCA Section 4 Multi-Chemical Test Rule for Developmental and Reproductive Toxicity
	(56 FR 9092; March 4, 1991);

  o	10 chemicals from the proposed TSCA Section 4 Multi-Chemical Test Rule for Neurotoxicological Effects (56 FR 9105;
	March 4, 1991);

  o	Refractory Ceramic Fibers (RCF) monitoring to obtain exposure data on RCF levels in industrial environments resulting from RCF manufacture, processing and end-use.

  o	Formaldehyde emissions characterization in new conventional and manufactured housing that contain formaldehyde-emitting pressed wood building materials and products.  This effort will also involve characterization of the rate at which formaldehyde levels decrease in these indoor environments.

  B. Categories
 
	The following 9 categories have been targeted by the Agency for testing action.  Work is currently underway to identify the specific chemical substances in each category and the type(s) of testing that should be pursued.


	Persistent Bioaccumulators

	Many chemicals that combine persistence and bioaccumulation have been found to present significant environmental problems.  Emerging concerns in EPA, especially in the Office of Water, focus on sediments contaminated with chemicals having these characteristics.  OPPT plans to require development of environmental fate and ecotoxicity test data on these chemicals to support a more comprehensive risk assessment.  OPPT is in the process of identifying the set of chemicals that will be handled under this effort.

	New Chemicals Program Categories of Concern

	EPA's New Chemicals Program has established 40 chemical categories whereby TSCA section 5(e) risk determinations have been made based upon health or environmental concerns identified through structure-activity relationships (SAR).  These categories were established to simplify the TSCA Section 5 regulatory process and represent part of a general effort by EPA to promote the development of safer chemicals.  As part of this activity, EPA will work with companies to identify and obtain the test data needed to better define the limits of each category and to improve the understanding of risks (hazard and exposure) that may be presented by TSCA section 5 "Pre-Manufacture Notification" (PMN) substances within these categories.

	EPCRA Section 313 ("TRI Screening")

	The Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) was established under section 313 of the "Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act" (EPCRA).  Under this effort, an as yet undefined subset of TRI chemicals that are produced and released in high volumes will be evaluated and screening level testing developed using the OECD SIDS model.  Current efforts focus on a possible voluntary program organized by the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA) and possibly other trade associations to provide the needed information and testing.

	CAAA Section 112 "Air Toxics"

	Data are needed by EPA's Office of Air and Radiation (OAR) to determine the "residual risk" posed by the 189 chemicals listed under section 112 of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.  The 1992 MTL includes this category of chemicals, although only a subset will have testing proposed for them over the next several years.

	SARA Section 104 "Priority Data Needs"

	Section 104 of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA) requires EPA and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) to list chemicals frequently identified in Superfund sites.  ATSDR is charged with the preparation of "Toxicological Profiles" for these chemicals, identifying data gaps and research needs, and developing a testing/research program.  When and where appropriate, TSCA authorities are to be used to obtain the necessary data.  To date, 250 chemicals have been listed under section 104 of SARA.  Toxicological Profiles have been completed on 110 out of the 250 chemicals listed in SARA section 104 and cover a total of 195 individual chemicals.  The reason for the apparent discrepancy is that a single chemical substance may be listed but the Toxicological Profile covers several chemical substances (e.g., the Toxicological Profile for lead covers lead as well as several lead compounds).  ATSDR has developed priority data needs for a subset of the 250 chemicals.  The industrial chemicals that are included in this subset will be proposed for testing by EPA's Chemical Testing Program over the next few years.

	Respirable Fibers
	
	Man-made and naturally-occurring fibers with diameters less than 3.5 micrometers that can enter the small airways of the lower respiratory tract and survive in biological systems for long periods of time can present significant health concerns.  EPA is assessing the potential risks associated with the production and use of synthetic and naturally-occurring respirable fibers and products made from such fibers.  The testing likely to be proposed by EPA will focus on health effects via inhalation and better characterization of exposure.

	Indoor Air Source Characterization - 
	Carpet/Carpet Products

	An agreement has been reached to generate the test data needed for characterization of Total Volatile Organic Compound (TVOC) emissions from carpets and carpet-related products. The emissions testing program was developed via EPA's Carpet Policy Dialogue and testing was initiated in 1991.  This effort involves testing to determine the TVOC emissions from carpet, carpet cushion, and carpet adhesives.  (See 56 FR 67317; December 30, 1991)


	Indoor Air Source Characterization - 
	Interior Architectural Coatings

	OPPT and EPA's Office of Air and Radiation are coordinating efforts to characterize specific chemical emissions and total emissions from indoor air sources such as paints, varnishes and other coatings.

	Polychlorinated Dioxins/Furans in Wood Pulp/Paper Mill Sludge

	Polychlorinated dioxins and furans (D/F) are produced when wood pulp is bleached with chlorine or chlorine-derivative compounds.  The sludge that results from the wastewater treatment process in pulp and paper mills has been found to be contaminated with D/F.  The Agency is concerned about the possible adverse human health and environmental risks posed by the disposal of this sludge through land application and has determined that additional testing and monitoring data to evaluate such risks are needed.  The testing program could include determination of D/F concentrations in pulp and paper mill sludge and an evaluation of the environmental fate and ecological effects of D/F in this type of sludge.

  C.  NOTE

	Also see the discussion in Part III.A.3. concerning changes in the definitions of how chemicals will be removed from the MTL.  These changes have resulted over 20 chemical substances that should have appeared, but did not appear, in the 1990 MTL and are now included in the MTL for 1992.

II.  DELETIONS FROM THE MTL

	A total of 45 chemical substances have been deleted from the MTL for the reasons set forth below.

	The Interagency Testing Committee (ITC) has withdrawn the quaternary ammonium compounds (designated for testing in the ITC's 22nd Report) and plans to reevaluate the testing need(s) and method(s) for these substances.  Therefore, the following 4 quaternary ammonium compounds have been removed from the MTL:

       Chemical Name                        CAS Registry Number

  Imidazolium Quaternary Ammonium Compound      68142-86-1
  Ethoxylated Quaternary Ammonium Compound      68410-69-5
  Ethoxylated Quaternary Ammonium Compound      68413-04-7
  Imidazolium Quaternary Ammonium Compound      72623-82-6

	Due to the fact that the Agency has received, reviewed and accepted the results of all tests required under TSCA Section 4, the following 41 chemicals have been deleted from the MTL:

III. FORMAT CHANGES IN THE MTL FOR 1992 

  A.	Comments Submitted by Interested Parties
 
	EPA bases its testing priorities on broad input from all those who have a stake in EPA's Existing Chemicals Program, including other offices at EPA, other Federal agencies, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), environmental groups, public interest groups, unions, chemical companies, and private citizens.  Availability of the 1991 MTL and the date for a public meeting were announced in the Federal Register (56 FR 42055, August 26, 1991).  EPA received written comments, and these and other issues were discussed at the public meeting.  In response to public comments, the MTL has been restructured; these structural changes are summarized below.  Other issues raised via the public comment process can be found in Appendix II.

  1)	Status in the Testing Process  

	A status code now indicates a chemical's progress through the four stages of the testing process.   Status code (A) is assigned to chemicals when they are added to the MTL; (S) is assigned to chemicals for which EPA is starting development of a proposed test rule or negotiation of a consent agreement; (F) is assigned to chemicals for which EPA is developing a final test rule; and (T) is assigned to chemicals that are under test via a voluntary agreement, consent order, or final test rule.  The year in which a chemical is expected to complete its current stage and move to the next stage of the process is also shown on the list.

  2)	Testing Endpoint Indicators

	Testing needs have now been organized into three general categories of endpoints: health effects (Health), environmental effects (Environ), and/or chemical fate (Fate).  Additional information on specific testing needs and codes is contained in Table 2 on page 10.

  3)	Chemicals Removed Upon Receipt of All Test Data

	The 1991 version of the MTL indicated that EPA would remove chemicals after a final rule is published, but would continue to list voluntary testing cases until the data were received.  EPA agrees with a number of comments about the inequity of this approach, and will leave chemicals on the MTL until all required tests are completed and final reports are received and accepted as adequate by EPA.  Further, EPA will remove chemicals from the MTL if the testing priority is significantly reduced, as was the case with the quaternary ammonium compounds discussed previously.  As the result of this procedural change, more than 20 chemicals which should have appeared, but did not appear, on the 1990 MTL are now included in the 1992 MTL.

  B)	FORMAT, HEADINGS AND CODES USED IN THE MTL 

	The chemicals listed on the 1992 MTL are ordered by the source of the testing need.  In addition, the MTL includes an index ordered by Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) Registry Number.  A description of the MTL columns as they are ordered from left to right follows. 

CAS No.:  This unique identifier of up to 9 digits is assigned to chemicals by the Chemical Abstract Service (CAS).  CAS numbers are not available for several chemicals (e.g., commercial hexane) and all categories on the MTL.  Chemicals lacking CAS numbers are listed at the beginning of the CAS-ordered index of MTL entries.  
Chemical Name:  The common chemical name used by EPA.  

Source:  The chemical substances and categories listed on the MTL have been recommended for testing by sources from within EPA, outside agencies, and the international toxics community.  For several chemical substances, several sources were responsible for the testing recommendation.  All sources are listed separately in the CAS-ordered index to the MTL and include the following:

	CPSC - U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission

	ITC - Interagency Testing Committee (ITC).  The ITC was created under TSCA to recommend chemicals for testing.  The ITC recommends chemicals in biannual reports to the EPA Administrator.  This code also indicates the ITC report number in which a chemical substance was recommended for testing. 

	OAR - Office of Air and Radiation, USEPA.

	OECD - The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.  OECD member nations agreed that certain high production volume chemicals should have a base set of screening level test data available.  These data are referred to as the Screening Information Data Set (SIDS).  OECD considered groups of chemical substances in three phases (1, 2, and 3); the number after the country code (see the following section) denotes the phase.

	Country:  This column (when it appears) identifies the OECD country sponsoring the chemicals identified for testing under the OECD SIDS testing program.  Under this voluntary cooperative program, a country prepares a data summary or "Dossier" and conducts testing to provide missing SIDS data.  The country (or in some cases, countries) handling the chemical is identified by a 2-letter code.  The codes and corresponding countries are listed in Table 1 below.

	  o   Neurotoxicity Endpoint Rule (N);

	  o   Developmental/Reproductive Toxicity Endpoint Rule (D); and

	  o   Dioxin/Furan Rule (D/F).

	OW - Office of Water, USEPA.

Year Added:  The calendar year in which a chemical substance or category was added to the MTL.

Status:  Status code (A) is assigned to chemicals when they are added to the MTL; (S) is assigned to chemicals for which EPA is initiating development of a proposed test rule or negotiation for a consent agreement; (F) is assigned to chemicals for which EPA is developing a final test rule; and (T) is assigned to chemicals under test via a voluntary agreement, consent order or final test rule.  The estimated date for completion of the current stage in the chemical testing process is indicated by a 2 digit year code.  For example, the entry "S/93," indicates that the proposed rule or a consent order is under development and is expected to be completed (and final rulemaking is expected to begin) in 1993. 

Testing Needs: The last 3 columns indicate specific testing needs for health effects (Health), environmental effects (Environ) and environmental fate (Fate).  Table 2 below lists the codes for specific testing needs recommended for chemicals on the 1992 MTL.

APPENDIX I.


	EPA'S EXISTING CHEMICALS PROGRAM:  AN OVERVIEW


What are "existing chemicals"?

The approximately 70,000 chemicals that can be commercially produced or used under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) are known as "existing chemicals."  These chemicals are listed on the TSCA Inventory.  As described below, the Existing Chemicals Program focusses on approximately 14,000 chemicals (other than polymers) that are produced in quantities of more than 10,000 pounds per year.


Under what authority does EPA regulate existing chemicals?

TSCA, enacted in 1976, gives EPA authority to gather information about the toxicity of existing chemicals and the extent to which people and the environment are exposed to them, to assess whether those chemicals pose unreasonable risks to humans and the environment, and to take appropriate actions to control unreasonable risks.  (TSCA also requires that EPA review most new chemicals before they are manufactured.)

The law exempts eight product categories from TSCA regulatory authorities:  pesticides, tobacco, nuclear material, firearms and ammunition, food, food additives, drugs, and cosmetics.  Most of these product categories are regulated under other federal laws.


What is the Existing Chemicals Program?

The Existing Chemicals Program is in EPA's Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics (OPPT).  The program screens, establishes testing requirements for, assesses, and develops strategies for managing risks posed by chemicals currently in production or use.  Risk management encompasses any actions, regulatory or non-regulatory, to reduce or eliminate the likelihood of harm to human health or the environment.

OPPT has recently revised Existing Chemicals Program policies and procedures.  These revisions are directed toward

	enhancing the program's productivity--in terms of both the number and effectiveness of risk management actions taken;

	increasing public participation in the program;

	incorporating the concept of pollution prevention into all stages of the program; and

	integrating program priorities as closely as possible with agency-wide environmental risk-reduction priorities.

To do this, OPPT will

	focus on areas of highest risk;

	direct its efforts toward "clusters" of chemicals--groups of chemicals with common characteristics; and

	apply a wide range of approaches to risk management, both regulatory and non-regulatory, including, for example, providing the affected public with better information about chemicals and their potential risks.



How does the new Existing Chemicals Program work?

The fundamental elements of the new program are described below.



	RISK MANAGEMENT ONE (RM1)

A hallmark of the new Existing Chemicals Program is flexibility--flexibility to take quick, early action to reduce risk whenever possible.  The Risk Management One (RM1) phase of the program is a framework for ensuring that fact-finding and risk-management activities begin at the earliest possible time.

	Initial Screening

The first phase of RM1 is initial screening to identify potential health and environmental risks of chemicals and to propose candidates for action under the Existing Chemicals Program.  In broad terms, the population of potential candidates consists of the approximately 14,000 chemicals (other than polymers, which are generally of lesser concern due to limited bioavailability) on EPA's TSCA Inventory that are produced in quantities greater than 10,000 pounds annually.

In addition to its own analyses and databases, OPPT uses a variety of resources to identify likely candidates for action, including other Federal agencies, other EPA offices, international organizations, states, Indian tribes, and environmental and labor groups.  Initial screening activities rely primarily on readily available data concerning potential hazard and potential exposure.

	RM1 Committee

Chemicals identified as potential candidates for risk reduction during initial screening next move to the RM1 Committee, which consists of representatives from throughout OPPT.  The RM1 Committee, in consultation with other EPA offices and other Federal agencies when appropriate, has two tasks:  (1) to reach initial qualitative conclusions about the risk presented by each chemical candidate identified during initial screening and (2) to determine the next step for each candidate.  Where further action is needed, OPPT will notify industry of its concern through a "letter of concern" and will open an administrative record on the chemicals of concern to allow all members of the public to track the written materials EPA is evaluating.

Whenever possible, the program will take immediate steps to reduce exposures to chemicals found during initial screening to pose potential risk by (1) alerting industry and the public to the problem and (2) promptly initiating actions to limit exposures.  Actions at this stage may include encouraging voluntary pollution prevention or other control activities by industry; listing the chemical on the Toxics Release Inventory (a national inventory, established by the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, of annual releases of toxic chemicals from manufacturing facilities); acquiring additional information about the chemical under TSCA authorities; requiring notification of EPA before the chemical is manufactured for any new use; or referring the chemical to another Federal agency for risk management action.

In addition to taking any immediate action that is appropriate and feasible, the RM1 Committee has four options for proceeding with chemical candidates:

	Place the chemical on OPPT's Master Testing List, a list of chemicals given priority consideration for testing.  This course is taken when there are significant information needs regarding the chemical's hazard or exposure potential.  After testing is completed, the chemical returns to the RM1 stage of the process to determine whether it should be dropped from further consideration or put on course for additional action; the test results may be used in ongoing risk management deliberations or regulatory development activities.

	Place the chemical on the Risk Reduction List.  Chemicals suspected of posing or known to pose significant risks are placed on an action list, known as the Risk Reduction List.  Chemicals are not removed from this list until the concerns they present have been fully addressed and resolved.

	Place the chemical on the Regional Activities Track.  Chemicals assigned to the Regional Activities Track are those for which concern is limited to a few discrete geographical areas or those for which control activities require close coordination with state or local authorities.  When a chemical of concern is identified that meets either or both of these criteria, OPPT immediately notifies all appropriate EPA regional offices and provides them with any support necessary to address the concern.

	Drop the chemical from the list of candidates for further fact-finding or risk-management activities.  Decisions to drop are made when early fact-finding fails to indicate a significant basis for concern or need for additional action.  (If OPPT subsequently receives new information about a chemical that has been "dropped," however, that chemical may reenter RM1.)



	RISK MANAGEMENT TWO (RM2)

Risk Management Two (RM2) is the second phase of the Existing Chemicals Program.  The activities in this phase of the program  focus on (1) improving understanding about hazards posed by and levels of exposure to particular chemicals and (2) developing and adopting strategies to reduce or eliminate risks posed by individual chemicals to human health or the environment.

	Selecting Chemicals for RM2 Action

The Risk Reduction List is the bridge between RM1 and RM2.  RM2 begins when a chemical is selected from the Risk Reduction List for review.  In general, the following criteria determine the order in which chemicals move from the Risk Reduction List to RM2:  (1) the chemical's potential or known toxicity; (2) the potential or known exposure to the chemical; and (3) the extent to which pollution prevention can be achieved.

	RM2 Investigation

When a chemical moves from the Risk Reduction List to RM2, OPPT staff review existing information about the chemical and the risk it presents, identify options to address the risk, and determine what information is needed to select the most effective option.  Pollution prevention options are carefully considered at this stage and may be recommended to industry for immediate voluntary adoption.  Other interested EPA offices and federal agencies are also actively involved in this phase.



	RM2 Decision

After completing the RM2 investigation and considering any information provided by the public, OPPT management reconvenes to select a strategy to manage risks posed by the chemical in question.  The strategy selected may contain one or more of a wide range of actions, including:

	initiating a public awareness campaign;

	calling for voluntary action by industry;

	referring the chemical to another EPA program office, regional office, or other federal agency for action;

	stepping up enforcement of existing regulations;

	developing regulations, such as labeling requirements, restrictions on processing or use, or bans (regulations developed under TSCA follow standard EPA rulemaking procedures, including provisions for public participation); and

	dropping from further consideration, if warranted by information that is developed during the RM2 investigation.


How can the public get involved in EPA's existing chemicals process?

A central goal of the Agency's revitalized Existing Chemicals Program is that its work be carried out with as much public involvement as possible.  OPPT invites and encourages active public participation, via comment and consultation, throughout the process.  The Existing Chemicals Program also welcomes nominations of chemical candidates for screening and/or review and for inclusion on the Master Testing List, as well as suggestions for early pollution-prevention and risk-reduction actions.

The vehicle that permits full public participation in the existing chemicals process is the administrative record, a central collection point established by OPPT for materials on each chemical under consideration.  The administrative record includes the following documentation:

	a screening dossier containing relevant exposure and hazard information, recommendations from the screening workgroup, and the supporting rationale for that decision;

	summaries of major studies cited in the screening dossier;

	summaries of RM1 and RM2 meetings;

	any letters of concern to industry or others and replies;

	comments and other correspondence from other parties outside of EPA.

The public can gain access to the RM administrative record in the following two ways:

1.	In person, by going to room G-004 of the Northeast Mall, EPA Headquarters, at 401 M Street SW., Washington, D.C., between 8:00 a.m. and noon and 1:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m. Monday through Friday (facilities for photocopying are available); or

2.	By writing to the TSCA Public Docket (TS-793), Attention: RM1 Docket, Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20460.

EXISTING CHEMICAL PROGRAM OPERATIONS CHARTAPPENDIX II.   PUBLIC COMMENTS/ISSUES



  A) The MTL Should Include 3 Lists and a Process to Set Priorities

	Representatives of the chemical industry recommended that EPA expand the MTL to include three lists: a list of testing candidates; a list of those chemicals on which EPA is currently working  (this would be similar to the present MTL); and a list of chemicals that have completed testing.  In a related comment, the chemical manufacturers questioned how EPA will set priorities and select chemicals for the MTL.

	EPA believes the MTL should remain a single list containing chemicals for which EPA plans to initiate work within the next several years.  This can be explained by describing how the MTL is integrated into the OPPT Existing Chemicals Program (ECP).  Briefly, the program works like this:  OPPT receives requests for test data and nominations for additional testing from other EPA offices, Federal and state agencies, the ITC, and other sources outside the program.  OPPT screens these chemicals and others identified by OPPT through its ECP.  During this screening, OPPT determines whether (1) additional information is needed concerning a chemical's hazard and/or exposure potential, and (2) determines the relative priority of the action.  Those chemicals judged to present high priority testing needs will be added to the MTL.  Prioritization decisions will consider factors such as:  the extent which testing addresses high-risk or high-exposure situations; the potential for future regulatory or voluntary activities to reduce risks or prevent pollution; Congressional mandates; existence of a practical use and need for the data; and the existence of multiple needs for the data.  When testing is completed, the data are evaluated via OPPT's ECP. To learn more about the ECP, refer to Appendix I.



  B) Categories are Helpful But Confusing

	Some commentors indicated that they are confused by the use of chemical categories.  For example, the categories may be inadequately defined, chemicals may be in more than one category, and some categories do not specify the chemicals included.  The 1992 MTL includes only those categories selected for testing action by OPPT.  These categories are discussed in the section entitled "Additions to the MTL."


  C) The MTL Should Include All Testing

	Several commentors recommended expanding the MTL to include all testing for all industrial chemicals, including, for example, testing being conducted by the National Toxicology Program.  EPA has chosen to keep the MTL limited to testing related to authorities under section 4 of TSCA and other OPPT coordinated voluntary testing activities such as the Screening Information Data Set (SIDS) testing effort under the aegis of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).

Air Toxics

OAR
1992
Data needed to determine "residual risk" posed by Hazardous Air Pollutants listed under section 112 of the Clean Air Act Amendments.


Indoor Air Source Characterization - Carpet
OPPT
1991
Agreement has been reached to generate test data needed for characterization of Total Volatile Organic Compound (TVOC) emissions from carpets, carpet cushions, and carpet adhesives.   The emissions testing program was developed via EPA's Carpet Policy Dialogue; and testing was initiated in 1991. (56 FR 67317, December 30, 1991).  


Indoor Air Source Characterization - Interior Architectural Coatings
OPPT & OAR
1992
This effort will focus on developing data needed to characterize specific chemical emissions and TVOC emissions from indoor air sources such as paints, varnishes, and other coatings.


New Chemicals Program Categories of Concern
OPPT
1992
EPA's New Chemicals Program has established 40 chemical categories whereby TSCA section 5(e) risk determinations have been made based upon health or environmental concerns identified through structure-activity relationships (SAR).  These categories were established to simplify the TSCA section 5 regulatory decision process and represent part of a general effort by the Agency to promote the development of safer chemicals.  As part of this activity, EPA will work with companies to identify and obtain the test data needed to better define the limits of each category and to improve the understanding of the risks (hazard and exposure) presented by TSCA section 5 "Pre-Manufacture Notification" (PMN) substances within these categories.


Persistent
Bioaccumulators
OPPT
1992
Chemicals that combine persistence and bioaccumulation are being identified through Structure Activity relationships (SAR) analysis.  Testing will likely focus on confirming persistence/bioaccumulation potential and characterizing environmental effects.

Polychlorinated Dioxins/Furans in Wood and Paper Pulp Sludge
OPPT
1992
Polyhalogenated dioxins and furans (D/F) are produced when wood pulp is bleached with chlorine or chlorine-derivative compounds.  The sludge resulting from the wastewater treatment process in pulp and paper mills have been found to be contaminated with D/F.  The Agency is concerned with risks to humans and the environment from the disposal of this sludge through land application, and has determined a need for additional testing and monitoring data to evaluate the risks.  The testing program could include determination of D/F concentrations in pulp and paper mill sludge and an evaluation of the environmental fate and ecological effects of D/F in this type of sludge.


Respirable Fibers
OPPT
1992
EPA plans to investigate potential inhalation health hazards and better characterize potential exposures to synthetic and naturally-occurring respirable fibers.


SARA Section 104
OPPT
1992
Priority data needs on industrial chemicals identified by ATSDR following preparation of Toxicological Profiles will be referred for handling by OPPT under TSCA section 4.


TRI Screening
OPPT
1992
High volume/high release chemicals on the Toxics Release Inventory have been targeted for development of screening level test data.
