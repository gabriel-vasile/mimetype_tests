Many of thesecis-actingelements are redundant and are located up to 100kb from the promoter.  Byscreeningfor mutations that fail to properly regulate the homeotic genes, the lab hasidentified eighteen new trans-acting factors required for the function ofthesecis-acting regulatory elements.  One of the new trans-acting factors, thebrahmaprotein, is related to yeast and mammalian transcription factors that formpart of aprotein complex that facilitates transcription by altering chromatinstructure.Trans-acting factors required for function of the hedgehog gene have alsobeenidentified.  Many of these are the same factors required for function ofthe homeoticgenes.  Current work is directed towards identifying factors that interactwith thebrahma complex, including the TBP-associated factors (TAFs) and homeoticcis-regulatoryelements as well as the molecular characterization of other newtrans-acting factorsalready identified.<H4>RECENT PUBLICATIONS</H4><p>Kennison JA, (1995) The Polycomb and trithorax group proteins ofDrosophila: Trans-regulators of homeotic gene function, Annu.Rev.Genet. 29:289-303.<p>Felsenfeld AL and Kennison JA, (1995) Positional signaling by hedgehog inDrosophilaimaginal disc development, Development 121:1-10.<p>Brizuela BJ, Elfring L, Ballard J, Tamkun JW, and Kennison JA, (1994)Genetic analysisof the brahma gene of Drosophila melanogaster and polytene chromosomesubdivisions 72AB,Genetics 137:803-813.<p>Kennison JA, (1993) Transcriptional activation of Drosophila homeoticgenes from distantregulatory elements, Trends in Genetics 9:75-79.<p>Tamkun JW et al.
