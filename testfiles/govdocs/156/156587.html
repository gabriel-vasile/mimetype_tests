We have examined over 10,000,000 DSC and SSC altimetric differences on the
three satellites Geosat (March 1985 - November 1988),
Ers1 (April 1992 - December 1993), and T/P (October 1992 - December 1996).
As outlined above the different passes in each observation
are either contemporaneous, for SSCs within
each repeating orbit cycle (17 days for Geosat, 10 days for T/P and 35
days for Ers1), or within the same months for the DSCs of
Ers1 and T/P (October 1992 - December 1993).
Here have been two sources of these
observations (involving principally the corrections to the same altimeter
observations), one from NOAA during the early stages of the project (prior
to 1997) and later from NASA (Pathfinder altimetry),
incorporating updated media corrections after 1996).
The original measurements are given in both
NOAA and NASA versions as sea heights above a reference surface
(for NOAA the reference is a detailed geoid above a certain ellipsoid, for
Pathfinder a specific mean sea surface above another
ellipsoid), in both cases the reference sea surface is the same for all
altimeter measurements on the three satellites.  Thus ideally in
either case (not mixing the two sources) the crossover difference is
indifferent to the reference surface.
<P>
The geopotential orbit model for all satellites except
Pathfinder for Ers1 (Scharoo and Visser, 1998), is Jgm3
 (Tapley et al., 1996).
Our altimeter observations are independent of the data
used to determine this model from combined satellite tracking and surface
gravity anomalies.  In particular Jgm3 has no tracking data for Ers1 (but
some on the nearby orbit of Spot&nbsp;2), considerable
Doppler tracking information on Geosat and extensive observations
(from Laser, Dopper and GPS) on T/P.
We note also that most of the more precise marine surface gravity anomalies
in Jgm3 were derived from large amounts of direct Geosat altimetry.
However, it appears that these did not account for
the geopotential effects on the radius
of the Geosat orbit which we consider here.
<P>
In our application, we
convert the measurement legs of Pathfinder Ers1 crossovers to
Jgm3 basis by analytically projecting the radial effect of
the difference of Jgm3 and the Pathfinder Geopotential
for Ers1 (Dgm-E4, Scharroo and Visser, 1998)
pass (either ascending or descending).
Table 1 summarizes the media corrections to the altimeter
observations that were applied to the source altimeter heights as well as
their reference orbit and sea surface models.  Notice that the only dynamic
ocean surface models we applied initially were the so-called inverse barometer
correction, the potential response of the water column to atmospheric pressure
changes, and a tide model (both for the solid earth, the ocean itself and the
effect of its load on the bottom). Table 1 also gives the time periods and
amounts of SSC measurements used and their average point power (after only the
media corrections) before binning.

The bins were sized to recover a 50x50 geopotential and the power of
these averages (also in Table 1) are a substantial reduction from that of the
original observations which were (as will be seen) affected by substantial
time-varying errors.
<P>
The analytic transformation for converting the Dgm-E4 base original Ers1
sea heights to Jgm3-basis is given in the next section but here we compare
Ers1 SSCs (long term 2x3 degree bin averages)
from the NOAA data (derived from Jgm3
orbits) with two of these conversions of original Pathfinder Ers1 SSCs
(Figure&nbsp;1).  The first conversion (Figure&nbsp;1b)
is based just on the difference
between the Jgm3 and Dgm-E4 geopotential's effect on the radius of Ers1,
the second (Figure&nbsp;1c)
on a straight differencing of the radial ephemerides
of the two orbit models from April 1992 to December 1993.

 d. Jgm3 basis from NOAA data, Rms = 5.6 cm.  The Dgm-E04 field has been
 fit to Ers1 SSCs though some evidence of residual geoopotential-orbit
 error remains.  The correlation of the two Jgm3-basis transfers of Pathfinder
 crossovers with the NOAA result are about 0.85. <BR>
</I></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
First notice the power of the Dgm-E4 basis SSc (Fig.&nbsp;1.a)
are  significantly smaller than the two conversions. The reason
is simply that this geopotential model
was tuned to Ers1 with both ordinary tracking and crossover altimetry
(to control 1 cpr error).  While the two conversions of Pathfinder SSCs
to Jgm3-basis appear equally close to the NOAA version (Fig. 1d),
 the trajectory
differenced one is slightly superior in this example.  However, we cannot be
certain this slight superiority is not due to small differences in the media
corrections for this particular Pathfinder and NOAA data set (Table 1) and
also because the analytic conversion does not account
(at this stage) for other
time-varying orbit differences (at 1 cpr primarily) which will be resolved
in the final inversion.  For these reasons we chose to use the simple and
flexible analytic conversion for all Ers1 Pathfinder sea heights.
<P>
Table 1 also gives the time periods, amounts and power of the DSC measurements
used (point and bin averages), namely for Geosat-T/P, Geosat-Ers1 and Ers1-T/P.
<P>
What are the errors likely in a typical altimetric sea height &quot;measurement&quot;
for the three satellites examined here?  There are three generic sources
of these associated with  nature of the measurement itself (a
subtraction of an altimeter distance from a trajectory height).  The
trajectory height can be in error, the  measurement height  along its
path to the ocean can be in error and the estimation of the ocean's mean
surface in the radar's footprint can be in error due to so-called
electromagnetic bias (EMB) from waves.
<P>
Table 2 is a summary of the error budget for altimeter heights estimated
for both NOAA and NASA Pathfinder sources
(reduced to a Jgm3-basis for Ers1), following
Wagner and Klokocnik (1994) and Klokocnik et al. (1996).
The largest uncertainties are for the Geosat heights, 11&nbsp;cm <I>rms</I>,
due principally to the geopotential on the low orbit but also from
relatively weak environmental corrections (ionosphere and
wet troposphere, not as well known in 1985-88).  Ers1 heights
we assess as in error by roughly 9&nbsp;cm <I>rms</I>,
a relatively low orbit again dominated by geopotential uncertainty
with better control over the environmental corrections and,
for Pathfinder, use of altimeter
crossovers in orbit determination.  The T/P heights appear
to be uncertain at a level of about 6&nbsp;cm <I>rms</I>
with low geopotential error on its relatively high orbit
(about 1&nbsp;cm)
and well measured ionosphere and wet troposphere environmental
corrections with on-board instruments.
<P>

<P> <IMG WIDTH=634 HEIGHT=541 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tabular561" SRC="table2.gif"  > <P>
<P>

<P>
Note that the principal orbit error component
after the geopotential is due to
incorrect initial conditions (mainly the 6 fundamental state components of
the trajectory) which manifests itself at 1&nbsp;cpr.  In past
analyses of satellite altimetry (e.g., Wagner and Klokocnik, 1994;
Moore and Ehlers, 1990) this was removed empirically by use of
crossovers exclusively within each orbit-arc of data
spanning about 4 days (for Geosat and Ers1) and 10 days for
T/P.  Here, we take a different approach and initially leave this error
unresolved as a part of the bin averages.
Our reason is that the 1 cpr effect
over the long period analysed will generally consist of
a small constant and a larger component which fluctuates
from one orbit cycle to the next.  The
fluctuating part tends to cancel in the average and the mean can be closely
represented by a simple zonal function of the latitude
which can be resolved in
the global anlysis along with the geopotential (see below,
also Appendix A).
<P>
We treat the time-tag error
in a similar fashion, only as part of the global analysis,
instead of on an arc by arc basis.  In this way, not only
is the preprocessing of the observations
greatly simplified but the removal of important oceanographic and geopotential
information in the large number of these short-term empirical parameters
is avoided.
<P>
As alluded to above, we
sought to minimize the errors in these complex media models by choosing
crossovers with a little time between passes as possible.
For the SSCs, we took those only in each natural orbit repeat cycle (17 days
for Geosat, 35 for Ers1 and 10 for T/P) though the average time difference in
these were less than half of these figures.  For the
DSCs, we segregated all passes for measurements by months,
contemporaneously for pairs involving Ers1 and T/P
(between October 1992 and December 1993), and
with various multi-year gaps for Geosat and Ers1, Geosat and T/P
(Table&nbsp;1).
<P>
Notice there is a natural order for these media errors
which we anticipate: the smallest should be found for T/P SSCs
(with   <IMG WIDTH=51 HEIGHT=12 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline590" SRC="img1.gif"  >   measured ionosphere and
wet troposphere delays, as well as the shortest cycle time),
the next largest from Ers1 SSCs
(with more current delay models than for Geosat), the next
from Geosat SSCs (at least small non-tidal ocean dynamics and other media
model errors within the few days between ascending and descending passes),
the next from Ers1-T/P DSCs (with model errors peculiar to two missions, not
one), and finally the DSCs from Geosat-T/P and Geosat-Ers1 with ocean
interannual effects also affecting the crossovers.  It is the last of these
error sources which has proved most surprising (Klokocnik el al.,
1998, 2000).
<P>
We knew interannual ocean dynamics would affect our measurements (e.g.,
Wagner et al., 1997) but we hoped that after averaging our
crossover measurements in both space and time these errors as
well as from the other sources would be both reduced in amount and would
lose much of their systematic character in space, crucial to geopotential
recovery.  Perhaps most surprising was not that the interannual ocean dynamics
would retain its character after this averaging treatment (interannual
implies long-term) but that we could distinguish this dynamic action from
the orbit-geopotential in our measurements.  We will have much more to say
about this aspect later (see also Klokocnik et al., 2000.)<BR>
