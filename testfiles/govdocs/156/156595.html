My lab has focused on how these ROS are generated         and regulated in nonphagocytic cells and what intracellular signaling         pathways they seem to regulate. </font>       <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" >Early in our studies, we         observed that vascular smooth muscle cells stimulated by platelet-derived         growth factor (PDGF) produce a large and rapid but transient increase         in intracellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. We were able to demonstrate         that this increase in ROS was essential for PDGF signal transduction and,         in particular, for growth factor&#173;stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation.         Results from our lab and others have since suggested that the burst of         ROS is not confined to smooth muscle cells or PDGF, but occurs with a         variety of ligands in a multitude of cells. </font>       <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" >We next were able to demonstrate         the role of the small GTPases ras and rac1 in the regulation of ligand-stimulated         ROS.

Nonetheless,         these results suggested that the ras superfamily of proteins might function         to regulate the balance of oxidation and reduction, that is, the redox         state, of the cell. </font>       <p><font  face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Not only does our work suggest         that ROS play a role in growth-factor signal</font><font  face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">ing,         we have also demonstrated that ROS serve as mediators of apoptosis.

As a confirmed         Drosophila geneticist, I have used the sophisticated genetics of the fruit         fly <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> to identify and characterize the genes         involved in one particular developmental step, the specification of segmental         identity in the fly. Segmental identity is specified by the homeotic genes,         the Drosophila homologues of the HOX genes of vertebrates. Because the         homeotic genes have 100-kb cis-regulatory regions that control their developmental         expression patterns, a large number of proteins are required to specify         and maintain expression. I have concentrated on identifying and characterizing         two groups of genes that function to maintain patterns of gene activity,         either repression or activation. These two groups of genes, the Polycomb         and trithorax, are conserved between Drosophila and humans. </font>       <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" >My colleagues and I have         identified more than a dozen new Polycomb and trithorax group genes using         genetic screens.

Additional studies have shown that         a similar link exists between brain regions that subserve motor performance         and stored knowledge about how objects are used. Thus, the organization         of semantic information parallels the organization of the sensory and         motor systems in the primate brain. </font>       <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" >These studies have provided         us with a deeper understanding of object-recognition, object-naming, and         language-comprehension problems in a variety of brain disorders, including         Alz-heimer's disease and related dementias. They have also provided us         with a framework for understanding the etiology of category-specific knowledge         disorders that result from focal brain lesions (for example, how one patient         can have problems naming and retrieving information about a single category         of objects, such as four-legged animals, and another patient can have         a deficit limited to naming and knowing about tools). This framework is         based on the premise that the distinction between members of different         categories of objects depends on access to information about different         types of features. More generally, these studies have provided us with         a means for asking questions about the broader issue of how information         is stored and organized in the human brain.</font>       <hr>      <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" > </font>       <table border="0" align="left" cellpadding="3">        <tr align="center">           <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b><font  face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><img src="stanko-u.GIF" width="90" height="90" align="MIDDLE" border="4"><i></i><br>            <i><font color="#000040" size="2">Stanko Stojilkovic</font></i></font>             <font size="2"><i> </i></font><font  face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">             </font></b></font></td>        </tr>      </table>      <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b><font color="#000040"><a href="mailto:ss69d@nih.gov">Stanko       Stojilkovic</a> </font></b><i><font color="#000040">received his Ph.D. in       1982 from the University of Novi Sad, Yugoslavia, where he was an assistant       professor of animal physiology until joining the NICHD's Endocrinology and       Reproduction Research Branch in 1985.

The major thrust of these investigations         was on the role of dihydropyridine-sensitive channels in calcium signaling         and the mechanism of their activation and inactivation. </font>       <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" >ER-derived calcium signaling         in hypothalamic and pituitary cells is activated by several hypothalamic         calcium-mobilizing agonists. Agonist-induced calcium release from the         ER is mediated by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and leads to frequency-modulated         oscillatory calcium signaling in gonadotrophs (the ER oscillator) and         to nonoscillatory amplitude-modulated calcium signaling in lacto-trophs         (lactotrophs and gonadotrophs are pituitary cells that produce hormones         that control lactation and ovulation and spermatogenesis, respectively).         </font>       <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" >I have characterized the         role of several intracellular elements involved in the regulation of the         oscillatory vs. nonoscillatory calcium response, such as inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate         receptor channels and the ER calcium pump. I have also studied the coupling         of PM </font><font ><font  face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">and ER         oscillators during agonist stimulation. These experimental studies led         to the development of quantitative mathematical models<font color="#000040"><i>&#151;</i></font>one         for the PM oscillator and one for the ER oscillator<font color="#000040"><i>&#151;</i></font>as         well as a coupled model that describes the effect of the PM oscillator         on depletion and repletion of the ER calcium pool. Functional studies         have shown that both hormone release and gene transcription can be activated         by calcium-mobilizing agonists when the PM oscillator is rendered inoperative         by the depletion of extracellular calcium. In the absence of an agonist,         spontaneous activity of the PM oscillator is sufficient to trigger hormone         release and early-response gene expression in lactotrophs but not in gonadotrophs.         </font> </font>       <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" >Current investigations focus         on two families of plasma-membrane calcium channels. We recently found         that ATP- gated purinergic-receptor (P2X) channels<b> </b>are expressed         in pituitary cells and have the capacity to modulate PM- and ER-derived         calcium signals and secretion. The primary P2X gene transcripts in pituitary         cells undergo extensive al ternative splicing, generating several isoforms.         We have identified the amino-acid residues contributing to the desensitization<b>         </b>of the P2X<sub>2</sub> subtype of these channels, or the protective         attenuation of response during prolonged ATP stimulation. The finding         that these residues are also expressed in all slowly (but not rapidly)         desensitizing P2X channels<b> </b>suggests that a common mechanism controls         the rate of cationic influx through these channels, a hypothesis that         will be tested in the near future. </font>       <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" >We recently identified a         novel calcium-influx pathway in several excitable cells that is activated         by depletion of the ER calcium pool in a manner comparable to that observed         in nonexcitable cells. In neuroendocrine cells, these calcium-influx channels         also depolarize the plasma membrane to generate action potentials or to         increase the frequency of spiking in spontaneously active cells. Our current         investigations are directed toward characterizing the electrophysiological         properties of these channels in hypothalamic and pituitary cells, as well         as the mechanism of synchronization of calcium release from intracellular         stores and action-potential&#173;driven calcium influx. </font>       <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" >Our recent finding that endothelin,         unlike other calcium-mobilizing agonists, induces a prolonged inhibition         of electrical activity<font color="#000040"><i>&#151;</i></font>with associated         decreases in calcium influx and cytosolic calcium, depletion of the ER         calcium pool, and inhibition of prolactin release<font color="#000040"><i>&#151;</i></font>piqued         our interest. Preliminary pharmacological investigations suggest that         a novel endothelin receptor is expressed in lactotrophs. We are now attempting         to clone this receptor.
