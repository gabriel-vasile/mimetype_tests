Introduction

Homeotic mutants resulting in the conversion of stamens into pistils,
designated multiovary <i>mo</i>, were first reported in barley by Gregory and Purvis
(1947) and, more recently, by Moh and Nilan (1953). This character is
apparently common in barley mutation experiments and 5 presumed alleles have
been described. One of these, <i>mo5</i>, has been reported to be closely linked to
the naked, <i>n</i>, locus (Tazhin, 1980) .  We have isolated two multiovary mutants
from fast neutron irradiated barley (see below).<p>
          
Organ identity genes have been extensively studied in two species, <i>Arabidopsis
thaliana</i> and <i>Antirrhinum majus</i> (snapdragon), and fall into three separate
classes, A, B, and C, each controlling organ identity in two adjacent whorls
(Weigel & Meyerowitz, 1994). The B loss-of-function mutants, replace
second-whorl petals with sepals and third-whorl stamens with carpels and
appear to be phenotypically similar to the barley <i>mo</i> mutants. Two Arabidopsis
and two snapdragon B organ identity genes have been cloned and designated
<i>APETALA3 (AP3)</i> and <i>PISTILATA (PI)</i> in Arabidopsis and <i>DEFICIENS (DEF)</i> and
<i>GLOBOSA (GLO)</i> in snapdragon.  These, and other organ identity genes, encode
members of a gene family characterized by an amino-terminal DNA-binding and
dimerization domain designated MADS for the first four members of this family,
MCM1 (yeast), AG (Arabidopsis), DEF (Snapdragon), and SRF (mammals)
(Schwarz-Sommer et al., 1990).<p>

Here we report the isolation of MADS-like genes from barley and attempts to
correlate the genes with mutant phenotypes.<p>

Results<p>

Isolation and characterization of mutants. The multiovary mutants, designated
<i>mo,,a</i> and <i>mo,,b</i>, were selected from fast neutron treated M2 generation field
plantings.  Plants were first observed as male sterile, but closer examination
revealed the complete absence of anthers and an abnormal number of stigmas and
carpels. A normal barley floret consists of a pistil, three anthers and two
lodicules enclosed by a lemma and palea (Fig. 1). The <i>mo,,a</i> mutant lacks all
anthers and has multiple carpels (Fig. 2A). The carpel structures appear to be
complex and abnormal. The lodicules (monocot equivalent of petals) appear to
be fairly normal, although enlarged. The <i>mo,,b</i> mutant also lacks all anthers
which are replaced by normal looking carpels (Fig. 2B). The lodicules appear
as twisted leaf-like structures resembling sepals.<p>

Cloning and characterization of MADS-like genes. Ten barley genomic DNA lambda
clones were isolated using a rice agamous-like gene as a probe. An 800 bp Hind
III fragment was subcloned from one of these, designated pJS18-2 and used as
an RFLP probe. This fragment was sequenced and shown to contain strong
homology to the MADS domain.<p>
     
The isolated lambda clones were digested with several restriction enzymes,
blotted and probed sequentially with pJS18-2, and the Arabidopsis organ
identity genes <i>AGAMOUS (AG)</i>, <i>APETALA3 (AP3)</i>, and <i>PISTILATA (PI)</i>.  The lambda
clone 16 hybridized strongly to <i>AG</i> and <i>AP3</i> while <i>PI</i> showed strong
hybridization to lambda clone 22. These clones were analyzed in more detail.<p>

The lambda 16 clone was restriction mapped and individual fragments used to
test for polymorphism. Only the Sall fragment pJS68 was polymorphic and could
be used for mapping (see below). Fragment 24 was shown to hybridize with a
mRNA probe.<p>

Genetic analyses. Female fertility was demonstrated for both <i>mo,,a</i> and
<i>mo,,b</i>.The F2 segregation ratios were distorted for <i>mo,,a</i> (3/53 <i>mo</i> plants), but
monogenic for <i>mo,,b</i> (1 1/50 <i>mo</i> plants). Allelism tests and mapping are in
progress.<p>
     
A lambda18 HindIII fragment, JS18-2, with homology to a rice agamous-like gene
and shown to contain MADS-like sequences was used to map two loci on the
barley RFLP map (Fig. 3). These loci, designated JS18A and JS18B, are
located on chromosome 1P and the telomeric region of chromosome 7P. The
lambda16Sall fragment, JS68, was polymorphic and 5 loci were mapped to
chromosomes 1, 3 and 6 and designated JS68A to E (Fig. 3). One of the loci
maps close to the <i>n</i> locus and may be the same as <i>mo5</i>.<p>
