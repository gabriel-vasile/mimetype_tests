A close relationship exists between adipocyte differentiation
of stromal cells and their capacity to support hematopoiesis.
The molecular basis for this is unknown. We have established an
<I>in vitro</I> system to study whether dlk/Pref-1, an EGF-like
molecule that intervenes in adipogenesis and fetal liver hematopoiesis,
affects both stromal cell adipogenesis and B cell lymphopoiesis.
Pre-B cell cultures require both soluble IL-7 and stromal cell
to promote pre-B cell growth and prevent B cell maturation or
death. We found that Balb/c 3T3 fibroblasts express dlk and function
as stromal cells. Transfection of these cells with antisense dlk
decreased dlk expression and increased insulin-induced adipocytic
differentiation. When antisense transfectants were used as stroma,
pre-B cells grew in a manner inversely correlated with the expression
of stromal dlk, in the absence of IL7. In addition, pre-B and
mature B cells also express dlk. These results demonstrate that
dlk plays a role in regulating differentiation signals directed
both to the stromal cells and to the lymphocyte precursors. Understanding
of the molecular mechanisms governing stromal cell-precursor interactions
is important for regulation of biological therapies involving
<I>ex vivo</I> expansion of hematopoietic and other tissue precursors.
