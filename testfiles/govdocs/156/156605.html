Notch, a transmembrane receptor member of the homeotic EGF-like
family of proteins, participates in cell-to-cell signaling to
control cell fate during development.  Activated Notch-1 constructs
lacking the extracellular region prevent differentiation of several
mammalian cells in vitro. This effect, however, bypasses the normal
mechanisms of cell-to-cell interactions in which Notch-1 participates.
 We investigated the role of Notch-1 in the hormone-induced adipocyte
differentiation of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts, a paradigmatic model of
adipogenesis that requires cell-to-cell contact.  Unlike other
differentiation models, Notch-1 expression and function were necessary
conditions for adipogenesis. Impaired Notch-1 expression by antisense
Notch-1 constructs prevented adipocyte differentiation. Strategies
aimed at blocking putative Notch-ligand interactions also blocked
adipogenesis, implicating Notch as a critical molecule in cell-to-cell
signaling necessary for differentiation. Inhibition of Notch-1
expression or function decreased the expression of PPAR  and PPAR
, transcription factors that control adipocyte differentiation
and are upregulated at cell confluence. These results implicate
Notch in the commitment of 3T3-L1 cells to undergo adipogenesis
by controlling the expression of the principal regulators of this
process.
