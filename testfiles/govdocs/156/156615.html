            <p><strong>Polly Chang</strong>, Ph.D., Director of the Molecular 
              Toxicology Program at the Biopharmaceutical Division, SRI International 
              (<a href="http://www.sri.com/biopharm/">http://www.sri.com/biopharm/</a>), 
              currently serves as Principal Investigator (PI) on the NIAID HIV 
              vaccine contract NIAID-N01-AI-95375 and has supervised the successful 
              preclinical safety testing of 6 candidate HIV vaccines under this 
              program. Working closely with the project management and regulatory 
              compliance teams in the preparation of the INDs, several of these 
              vaccines have been approved by the FDA for Phase I clinical trials. 
              Dr. Chang received her B.A. in mammalian physiology and her M.S. 
              in Bioradiology/Biophysics, both from the University of California, 
              Berkeley. She worked as a researcher at Lawrence Berkeley National 
              Laboratory (LBNL), eventually attaining the position of Principal 
              Research Associate before returning to the University of California 
              at Berkeley to obtain her Ph.D. in Biophysics. The focus of her 
              research was on the interactions of two clinical treatment modalities 
              (hyperthermia and radiation) and the impact of de novo protein synthesis 
              in in vitro cellular responses. Her global scientific experience 
              during the 1990s includes working as a Visiting Scientist at the 
              National Cancer Center, in Tokyo, Japan, and as a NIH Fogarty Fellow 
              at the Cancer Biology Department, University of Tokyo Medical Center 
              in Japan, examining the differential expression of a conserved family 
              of homeotic genes in multi-step chemical carcinogenesis. In 1997 
              Dr. Chang joined SRI where, in addition to her vaccine work, she 
              is currently the PI on a grant from NASA to apply transgenic mouse 
              mutation models to study the mutagenic potential of charged particle 
              radiation that mimics exposure that space travelers will receive. 
              She is examining the expression of key genes that are involved in 
              cell functions, linking perturbations in cellular systems after 
              treatments with genotoxic agents to the misregulation of normal 
              differentiation and pathophysiology. She also supervises a variety 
              of molecular biology-related projects and serves as Study Director 
              on several NCI studies to evaluate chemopreventive therapeutics. 
              She is author or coauthor of over 30 publications.</p>
            <p>CDR <strong>Rebecca Sheets</strong>, Ph.D., (USPHS) (<a href="/vrc/key_sheets.htm">http://www.niaid.nih.gov/vrc/key_sheets.htm</a>) 
              obtained her B.S. degree in Biology from the California Institute 
              of Technology; M.S. degree in Cellular, Viral, and Molecular Biology 
              from the University of Utah School of Medicine, and Ph.D. in Pathology 
              from the University of Southern California School of Medicine. During 
              12 years of laboratory experience, she performed research in virology 
              and viral pathology. Rebecca Sheets also worked in the pharmaceutical 
              industry as a Clinical Research Associate, prior to obtaining her 
              Ph.D. Her responsibilities were in the development, monitoring, 
              and data auditing of clinical trials for cancer adjunct therapy 
              with a biological cytokine. Dr. Sheets served for 9 years (1993-2002) 
              as a Scientific Reviewer in the Viral Vaccines Branch of the Division 
              of Vaccines and Related Products Applications, Office of Vaccines 
              Research and Review, CBER/FDA, reviewing Investigational New Drug 
              Applications and Biologics License Applications. In 1994, to foster 
              her commitment to public health, she became a Commissioned Officer 
              in the U.S. Public Health Service (Scientist Category), in which 
              she has been promoted to the rank of Commander (CDR). Since April 
              2002, Dr. Sheets is currently assigned as a Vaccine Scientific and 
              Regulatory Specialist in the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious 
              Diseases at the National Institutes of Health. In this role, she 
              serves the Division of AIDS and the Vaccine Research Center supporting 
              the pre-clinical development of research concepts into HIV vaccine 
              candidates suitable for human clinical trials.</p>
            <p><strong>Stuart Z. Shapiro</strong>, M.D., Ph.D., is currently a 
              Medical Officer in the Preclinical Research &amp; Development Branch, 
              Vaccine &amp; Prevention Research Program, Division of AIDS, National 
              Institute of Allergy &amp; Infectious Diseases where he provides 
              scientific, clinical, technical, and budgetary planning, monitoring 
              and management of grants, contracts, and cooperative agreements 
              that support HIV/AIDS vaccine development with a focus on programs 
              designed to facilitate the rapid transition of new vaccine designs 
              through preclinical development into phase I human trials. Dr. Shapiro 
              obtained his B.A. degree in Biochemistry from the University of 
              California at Berkeley (1969), and his Ph.D. (Molecular Biology; 
              1976; thesis research on retrovirus protein synthesis) and M.D. 
              (1977) degrees from Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva 
              University. He underwent medical internship training at Los Angeles 
              County Harbor General Hospital after which he was a postdoctoral 
              fellow and then a core Staff Scientist in tropical parasitic disease 
              vaccine development for eight years at the International Laboratory 
              for Research on Animal Diseases (ILRAD) in Nairobi, Kenya. He continued 
              in parasitic disease vaccine research as an Assistant Professor 
              of Veterinary Microbiology/Immunoparasitology and taught immunology 
              and parasitology at the University of Illinois (Urbana-Champaign) 
              from 1987 to 1993. In 1993 Dr. Shapiro joined the Division of Viral 
              Products, Office of Vaccines, CBER, FDA as a laboratory-based reviewer 
              and Senior Staff Fellow in retrovirology. In 1998, following 4 years 
              at the FDA, Dr. Shapiro made a brief foray into industry as the 
              sole proprietor of a regulatory affairs consultancy and vaccine 
              design company. He came to his present position in DAIDS in September 
              1999 more fully aware of the difficulties vaccine developers face 
              in getting their products into clinical trials. He is the author 
              of a recent review (Shapiro, S.Z., Vaccine 2002; 20: 1261-1280) 
              that attempts to explain to academic HIV/AIDS vaccine researchers, 
              in plain English, what the FDA wants from them.</p>
            <p><strong>Sally J. Hargus</strong>, Ph.D., is currently a Toxicologist 
              in the Division of Vaccines and Related Products Applications, Office 
              of Vaccines Research and Review, Center for Biologics Evaluation 
              and Research, US FDA. She was recruited to FDA in July, 2001, following 
              5 years working in the pharmaceutical industry as a toxicologist. 
              Dr. Hargus was a Fellow at the NIH from 1992-1996, in the laboratory
