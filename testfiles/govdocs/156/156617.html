<H3><I>The construction of a BAC contig for chromosome walking
at the Tsn1 locus in wheat.</I><FONT COLOR="#ff0000"> [p. 252-253]</FONT></H3>

<P><I>Tsn1</I> conditions sensitivity to a host-selective proteinaceous
toxin (Ptr ToxA) produced by the pathogenic fungus Pyrenophora
tritici-repentis and plays an important role in pathogen-host
recognition.  A large F2 population consisting of 5,450 gametes
was produced to develop a high-resolution map for positional cloning
of the gene.  High-resolution mapping delineated the <I>Tsn1</I>
gene to a 0.55 cM interval flanked by AFLP-derived markers <I>Xfcg17</I>
and <I>Xfcg9</I> at 0.15 and 0.41 cM from the gene, respectively.
 More tightly linked markers were developed using chromosome walking
in conjunction with complete sequencing of BACs identified in
the Langdon durum BAC library.  Although the <I>Tsn1</I> gene
lies within a recombination hot spot along the chromosome, our
results indicate that recombination frequencies vary significantly
within the BAC contig.  From the regions that have been sequenced,
we identified more than 10 genes, most of which are genes that
encode cell wall-associated receptors or kinases.  The product
of the <I>Tsn1</I> gene also may be a cell wall-associated protein
that interacts with the toxin to manifest necrosis because plants
having <I>tsn1</I> or the null allele (deletion lines) are insensitive
to Ptr ToxA.  The cloning and characterization of <I>Tsn1</I>
will be helpful in better understanding the host-pathogen interaction.<BR>

<H3><I>Molecular cloning of the Q locus in wheat.</I><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">

<P>Kristin Simons, John P. Fellers, Harold Trick, Bikram S. Gill,

<P>The <I>Q</I> locus played a major role in the domestication
of polyploid wheat because it confers the square-headed phenotype
and the free-threshing character, and it pleiotropically influences
many other agronomically important traits.  A physical contig
spanning the <I>Q</I> locus on chromosome 5A was constructed using
a <I>T. monococcum</I> BAC library.  The 100-kb segment cosegregating
with <I>Q</I> contained an <I>APETELA2</I> (<I>AP2</I>)-like gene.
 This gene is a likely candidate for <I>Q</I>, because AP2 plays
a major role in controlling floral homeotic gene expression in
Arabidopsis.  The <I>AP2</I>-like gene was sequenced from the
free-threshing <I>T. aestivum</I> cultivar Chinese Spring, the
free-threshing <I>T. turgidum</I> cultivar Langdon, and several
nonfree-threshing wild relatives.  Sequence comparisons revealed
slight differences between free-threshing and nonfree-threshing
species.  EMS-treated <I>T</I>. <I>aestivum</I> lines were screened
for mutations in the <I>Q</I> locus.  Of six mutant lines, three
were the result of large deletions encompassing the <I>Q</I> locus.
 The AP2-like gene in the remaining three lines had base substitutions
that resulted in coding of a different amino acid or the alteration
of a predicted exon/intron splice site.  Transgenic individuals
were created using a 5 kb subclone of a <I>T</I>. <I>turgidum</I>
BAC containing the <I>Q</I> locus.  These transgenic individuals
mimicked the increased or decreased dosage effect of <I>Q</I>,
suggesting the occurrence of silencing and over-expression, respectively.</P>

<H3><I>Molecular mapping of resistance to Pyrenophora tritici-repentis
race 5 and sensitivity to PtrToxB in wheat.</I><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">
[p. 253]</FONT></H3>

<P>Justin D. Faris and Timothy L. Friesen.</P>

<P>Tan spot is an economically important foliar disease in the
major wheat growing areas of the world.  Multiple races of the
pathogen have been characterized based on their ability to cause
necrosis and/or chlorosis on differential wheat lines.  Isolates
of race 5 cause chlorosis only, and they produce a host-selective
toxin designated Ptr ToxB that induces chlorosis when infiltrated
into sensitive genotypes.  We used the ITMI mapping population
to identify genomic regions harboring QTL for resistance to fungal
inoculations of PTR race 5 and to determine the chromosomal location
of the gene conditioning sensitivity to Ptr ToxB.  The toxin-sensitivity
gene mapped to the distal tip of the short arm of chromosome 2B.
 This gene was responsible for the effects of a major QTL associated
with resistance to the race 5 fungus and accounted for 69 percent
of the phenotypic variation.  Additional minor QTL were identified
on the short arm of 2A, the long arm of 4A, and elsewhere on chromosome
2B.  A multiple regression model consisting of the major QTL on
2BS identified by the toxin insensitivity gene, a marker underlying
a minor QTL on 2B, a marker on 4AL, and an epistatic interaction
accounted for 76 percent of the total phenotypic variation for
resistance to PTR race 5.  The results of this research indicate
that Ptr ToxB is a major virulence factor, and the markers underlying
significant QTL should be useful for introgression of resistance
into adapted germ plasm.</P>

<H3><I>Genetic and physical mapping of a gene conditioning sensitivity
in wheat to a partially purified host-selective toxin produced
by Stagonospora nodorum.</I> <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">[p. 253-254]</FONT></H3>

<P>Zhaohui Liu, Justin D. Faris, Steven Meinhardt, Shaukat Ali,

<P><I>Stagonospora</I> <I>nodorum</I> is the causal agent of wheat
leaf and glume blotch, an economically important disease in many
wheat-growing areas throughout the world.  Using filtration, ion-exchange
and gel-filtration chromatography, we partially purified a toxin
from culture filtrates of isolate Sn2000.  This toxin, designated
as SnTox1, showed selective action on several different wheat
genotypes indicating that it is a host-selective toxin (HST).
 The ITMI mapping population was evaluated for toxin reaction
and used to map the host gene conditioning sensitivity.  This
gene, designated as <I>Snn1</I>, was genetically mapped to the
distal end of chromosome 1BS.  The wheat cultivar Chinese Spring
and all CS nullisomic-tetrasomic lines were sensitive to the toxin,
with the exception of N1BT1D.  Insensitivity also was observed
when the 1B chromosome of CS was substituted by the 1B chromosome
of an insensitive accession of Triticum dicoccoides.  These results
indicate that the toxin sensitivity gene resides on chromosome
1B, and suggest that sensitivity is dominant.  A series of 1BS
deletion lines were used to physically localize the sensitivity
gene.  Physical mapping indicated that <I>Snn1</I> lies within
a major gene-rich region on 1BS.</P>

<H3><I>QTL analysis and mapping of resistance to Stagonospora
nodorum leaf blotch in wheat.</I> <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">[p. 254]</FONT></H3>

Jack B. Rasmussen, and Justin D. Faris.</P>

<P>Stagonospora nodurum leaf blotch (SNB) is an economically important
foliar disease in the major wheat-growing areas of the world.
 Utilization of host resistance is considered to be the most important
and preferred method to control disease.  In related work, we
identified a host-selective toxin (SnTox1) produced by the isolate
Sn2000 and mapped the gene (<I>Snn1</I>) conditioning sensitivity
to chromosome 1BS.  Here, we screened the ITMI mapping population
and cytogenetic stocks, including nullisomic-tetrasomic lines
and CS-<I>T. dicoccoides</I> (CS-DIC) substitution lines, with
isolate Sn2000 to identify QTL associated with resistance to SNB.
 QTL analysis revealed that Snn1 underlies a major QTL and explained
58.3, 47.7, and 27 percent of the phenotypic variation for 5,
7, and 10-day readings, respectively.  This 1BS QTL, a minor QTL
on chromosome 4BL, and an interaction between <I>Snn1</I> and
a marker on chromosome 2B, explained as much as 66 percent of
the total phenotypic variation.  An additional QTL on chromosome
7BL was identified for the 10-day readings.  Toxin sensitivity
was highly correlated with chlorotic flecking on the leaves, which
occurred in the early stages of disease development.  N1BT1D and
CS-DIC 1B were absent of chlorotic flecking and less susceptible
to the fungus.  These results in combination with the decreased
effects of the 1BS QTL from 5 to 7 to 10 days indicate that the
toxin is a major virulence factor, and is most effective in the
early stages of the interaction.<BR>

<H3><I>Evaluation of synthetic hexaploid wheats for seedling resistance
to tan spot and Stagonospora nodorum blotch.</I> <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">[p.

<P>Steven S. Xu and Timothy L. Friesen.</P>

<P>Production of synthetic hexaploid wheat (SHW or synthetic)
lines (2n = 6x = 42, AABBDD) is a practical way to generate a
useful germ plasm source for the transfer of desirable traits
from <I>Ae. tauschii</I> and tetraploid wheat to bread wheat.
 The Wide Hybridization Program at CIMMYT recently selected and
characterized two sets of elite SHW lines (Elite 1 and Elite 2).
 Thus far, some important traits such as agronomic performance,
quality traits, and resistance to various diseases have been evaluated.
 However, their resistance to tan spot and SNB has not been evaluated.
 Tan spot and SNB are important foliar diseases of bread wheat
and durum wheat.  These two diseases have ability to cause serious
yield losses.  Because the majority of current bread and durum
wheat cultivars are susceptible, there is a need to find new sources
of high level resistance to tan spot and SNB and transfer the
resistance to local cultivars.  In this study, 120 elite CIMMYT
SHW lines and their durum wheat parents were inoculated with <I>P.
tritici-repentis</I> race 1 and a standard field isolate (Sn2000)
of <I>S. nodorum</I>, respectively, in two separate, three-replication
experiments.  The seedling reactions to <I>P. tritici-repentis</I>
and <I>S. nodorum</I> were evaluated 7 and 10 d postinoculation,
respectively.  The plant leaves also were infiltrated with the
host selective toxin Ptr ToxA at the two-leaf stage and sensitivity
was evaluated 3-4 d post infiltration.  As expected, most SHW
lines were the same as their durum parents in their sensitivity
to Ptr ToxA, because the sensitivity locus <I>Tsn1</I> is located
on chromosome 5B.  However, a few of the synthetics were different
from their durum parents, suggesting that heterozygosity and heterogeneity
might exist in some of the SHW lines and durum parents.  The toxin
sensitivity significantly increased susceptibility of the synthetics
to tan spot but had no significant effects on durum parents. 
The data showed that 56 (46.7 %) and 36 (30.0 %) SHW lines were
resistant to tan spot and SNB, respectively, whereas resistance
was almost absent in the durum parents.  These results suggest
that the elite CIMMYT synthetics are an excellent source of new
resistance to tan spot and SNB and should be useful in developing
new resistant cultivars and adapted germplasm in bread wheat.characterization

<H3><I>Chromosomal locations of novel glutenin subunits and gliadins
in wild emmer wheat.</I> <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">[p. 255]</FONT></H3>

<P>Steven S. Xu, Khalil Khan, Daryl L. Klindworth, Justin D. Faris,
Gloria Nygard.</P>

<P><I>Triticum turgidum</I> subsp. <I>dicoccoides</I> (DIC), known
as wild emmer, is the tetraploid progenitor of durum and bread
wheat.  Wild emmer has many useful traits such as pest resistance,
high protein content, and unique protein compositions.  The glutenin
and gliadin proteins of wild emmer wheat have potential for improvement
of durum wheat quality.  The objective of this study was to determine
the chromosomes controlling the high molecular weight (HMW) glutenin
subunits and gliadin proteins present in three <I>T. turgidum</I>
subsp. <I>dicoccoides</I> accessions (Israel-A, PI-481521, and
PI-478742), which were used as chromosome donors in Langdon durum-<I>T.
turgidum</I> subsp. <I>dicoccoides</I> (LDN-DIC) chromosome substitution
lines.  The three<I> T. turgidum</I> subsp. <I>dicoccoides</I>
accessions, their respective LDN-DIC substitution lines, and a
number of controls with known HMW-glutenin subunits were analyzed
by SDS-PAGE, Urea/SDS-PAGE, and A-PAGE.  The results revealed
that all three <I>T. turgidum</I> subsp. <I>dicoccoides</I> accessions
possess <I>Glu-1A</I> alleles that are the same as or similar
to those reported previously.  However, each <I>T</I>. <I>turgidum</I>
subsp. <I>dicoccoides</I> accession had a unique Glu-B1 allele.
 The new <I>Glu-B1</I> alleles were designated as Glu-B1be in
Israel-A, Glu-B1bf in PI-481521, and <I>Glu-B1bg</I> in PI-478742.
 Results from A-PAGE indicated that there were eight, twelve,
and nine unique gliadin proteins bands, which were assigned to
specific chromosomes, in PI-481521, PI-478742, and Israel-A, respectively.
 The identified glutenin and gliadin proteins in the LDN-DIC substitution
lines provide the basis for evaluating their effects on end-use
quality, and they are also useful biochemical markers for identifying
specific <I>T. turgidum</I> subsp. <I>dicoccoides</I> chromosomes
or chromosome segments. </P>

<H3><I>Agronomic and quality characteristics of T1AS&middot;1AL-1DL
translocation lines of durum wheat carrying Glu-D1d.</I> <FONT

<P>Daryl L. Klindworth, Gary A. Hareland, Elias M. Elias, and
Steven S. Xu.</P>

<P>Markets for durum wheat could be expanded if cultivars with
dual-purpose end-use could be developed.  The <I>Glu-D1d</I> allele
encoding glutenin subunits 5+10 imparts good baking quality to
hexaploid wheat.  The objective of this study was to test the
agronomic and baking quality of T1AS&middot;1AL-1DL translocation
lines of durum wheat with <I>Glu-D1d</I>.  Translocation lines
were classified according to the presence of either low-molecular
weight I (LMWI; weak gluten) or LMWII (strong gluten) banding
patterns conditioned by the <I>Glu-B3</I> locus.  Advanced generation
translocation lines in a Renville background were grown in yield
trials conducted at two locations in North Dakota from 1998 through
2002.  Translocation lines were milled and mixing and baking characteristics
determined.  Only two translocation lines did not differ statistically
from Renville for yield and were similar to Renville for lodging
score, heading date, and plant height.  The translocation lines
had reduced thousand kernel weight and a high 'G x E' interaction
for farinogram characteristics.  Compared to Renville, mean loaf
volumes were not improved.  Translocation lines having LMWI had
better mixing stability and loaf volume than lines having LMWII.
 Although the results suggest agronomic traits can be sufficiently
improved, commercial production of the translocation lines may
not be feasible without more consistent mixing traits and improved
baking characteristics.</P>

<H3><I>High-throughput marker identification and mapping in wheat
using TRAPs (Target Region Amplification Polymorphism).</I> <FONT
 COLOR="#ff0000">[p. 255-256]</FONT></H3>

<P>Justin D. Faris, Steven S. Xu, Zhaohui Liu, and Jinguo Hu .</P>

<P>High-throughput marker technologies are necessary for the rapid
mapping of plant genomes to identify genomic regions harboring
genes governing desirable traits and for marker-assisted selection.
 The recently developed TRAP technique employs an 18mer random
primer in combination with a fixed 18mer primer designed based
on known EST sequences to amplify genomic fragments.  The random
primers are 3' end-labeled with IR dye 700 or IR dye 800 for autodetection
on a Li-Cor Global DNA Sequencer.  We applied the TRAP technique
to two sets of tetraploid Langdon durum-<I>T. turgidum</I> subsp.
<I>dicoccoides</I> (LDN-DIC) disomic chromosome substitution lines
to determine the number and chromosomal locations of polymorphic
TRAP markers.  The LDN-DIC (PI481521) disomic substitution set
has been characterized with 37 PCR reactions resulting in the
identification of 642 TRAP markers.  The markers were distributed
among all 14 chromosomes, and the number per chromosome ranged
from 19 (3B) to 72 (7A).  The second disomic substitution set
[LDN-DIC (PI4787420] has been partially characterized with 91
polymorphic markers identified from five PCR reactions.  On average,
17 polymorphic markers were observed per PCR reaction in the LDN-DIC
lines.  In addition, we assessed the number of polymorphic markers
and genetic map locations of TRAPs in a hexaploid wheat recombinant
inbred population derived from 'BR34/Grandin'.  In this population,
we observed an average of 20 polymorphic markers per PCR reaction.
 The TRAP markers are useful for genome characterization, tagging
desirable genes, and high-throughput mapping of wheat populations.</P>

<P>The mission of our wheat germ plasm enhancement program primarily
includes the development and characterization of new genetic stocks
and germ plasm in durum and hard red spring wheat.  Leonard R.
Joppa (ARS retired) and the late Norman D. Williams developed
a number of valuable genetic stocks and germ plasms using classical
cytogenetic approaches.  Many of them have not been characterized
and released to the public. We have engaged in efforts in characterizing
these materials using molecular cytogenetics and DNA marker technologies.
Some of these lines also have been recently evaluated for resistance
to various diseases, Hessian fly, and seed-storage-protein compositions.
 Here, we summarize the genetic stocks and germ plasm available
for distribution.  We are able to provide a small seed sample
(20-30 seeds/line) upon request.</P>

Dr. Leonard R. Joppa developed a number of spontaneous synthetic

by E.R. Kerber (Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Winnipeg, Manitoba,
Canada) and E. Nevo (University of Haifa, Haifa, Israel).  Except
for the synthetic line from cross 'LDN/PI 268210' was named as
Largo and released as greenbug-resistant germ plasm, other lines
have not been characterized previously.  These synthetics have
recently been evaluated for resistance to tan spot, SNB, leaf
and stem rust, and Hessian fly.  We currently are evaluating their
resistance to FHB and seed-storage protein compositions.  The
synthetics that are available for seed distribution are listed

<P><B>Durum wheat T1AS&middot;1AL-1DL translocation lines carrying
<I>Glu-D1d</I>. </B> Four translocation lines with the pedigree
'LDN 1D (1A)/LEN//LDN/3/2*Renville' and with glutenin subunits
1Dx5 and 1Dy10 from the <I>Glu-D1d </I>allele are available. 
These lines were produced in an effort to develop dual-purpose
(good baking and pasta quality) durum wheat.  The lines are identified
as L092, L252, S99B33, and S99B34.  Three of the lines carry the
LMWII-banding pattern derived from Renville and conditioned by
the <I>Glu-B3</I> gene.  The fourth line, L252, carries the LMWI-banding
pattern derived from LDN.  Quality tests have indicated L252 has
better mixing traits and slightly better loaf volume than the
translocation lines with LMWII.  In trials conducted in North
Dakota from 2000-02, S99B33 and S99B34 were the highest yielding
of the translocation lines and similar in yield to Renville. 
These lines should be useful to breeders attempting to produce
dual-purpose durum or for cereal chemists studying effects of
<I>Glu-D1d</I> in a durum background.</P>

<P><B>Induced mutants in hexaploid and tetraploid wheat and miscellaneous
stocks.</B>  N.D. Williams induced many mutants in hexaploid and
tetraploid wheat, primarily through application of EMS to seeds.
 Male-sterile mutants in hexaploid wheat include the FS2, FS3,
FS6, FS20, and FS24 mutants that have been reported in the literature.
 Additional recessive male sterile mutants that have not been
reported in the literature are also available, and all are known
to be allelic to either ms1 or ms5.  Chlorina mutants are available
in both hexaploid and tetraploid wheat that have been reported
in the literature.  Additional abnormal chlorophyll mutants, such
as virescent and albino, genetics have not been studied.  Lines
derived from conventional breeding techniques include a durum
line carrying the blue aleurone trait and lines carrying genes
conditioning the branched spike trait in durum wheat.  </P>
