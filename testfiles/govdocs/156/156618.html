<p>The discovery of adult frogs harboring gross limb deformities ranging from 
  the absence of limbs to the formation of multiple additional limbs indicates 
  an environmental disruption of limbdevelopment. While frog limb development 
  has not been specifically studied, vertebrate limbdevelopment has been the focus 
  of intense investigation with the mouse, chicken, andsalamander limbs as models. 
  Among vertebrates the developmental anatomy, the molecularcharacteristics, and 
  in some cases, direct experimentation indicates that all vertebrate limbsdevelop 
  in a similar manner. Of the types of limb deformities displayed by frogs caught 
  in thewild, the formation of multiple limbs, called supernumerary limbs, is 
  the most informative. Theformation of supernumerary limbs in laboratory experiments 
  is used as an indicator of signalingpathways important for the initiation of 
  limb formation. Thus far two signaling pathways thatlead to supernumerary limb 
  formation have been identified and partially characterized. The firstinvolves 
  signaling by a family of factors called fibroblast growth factor (FGF). FGF 
  signalinghas been linked to the initiation of bud formation, maintaining bud 
  outgrowth, and the inductionof a regeneration response following bud amputation. 
  FGF signaling has also been linked to theinhibition of limb formation in experiments 
  in which a source of FGF is placed at the base of thelimb bud. FGFs are secreted 
  primarily by ectodermal cells at the apex of the limb bud that forma structure 
  called the Apical Ectodermal Ridge (AER). Signaling occurs via a tyrosine kinase 
  cellsurface receptor (FGF receptor) that is expressed on mesenchyme cells. The 
  biological activitiesof FGF signaling in the limb bud include the stimulation 
  of cell proliferation, the regulation ofcell migration, and the induction of 
  genes known to be important for the control of limboutgrowth. It is possible 
  that an environmental interface with this signaling pathway could leadto limb 
  deformities that include the absence of limbs and the formation of ectopic supernumerarylimbs. 
<p>A second pathway important for limb formation involves hormone signaling by 
  retinoic acid(RA). Endogenous RA signaling is important for setting up the limb 
  field prior to outgrowth. Introducing an ectopic source of RA leads to the induction 
  of supernumerary limbs, whereasinhibiting RA synthesis or systemic exposure 
  to high levels of RA can result in the inhibition oflimb outgrowth altogether. 
  RA is a lipophilic signaling molecule that is synthesized from aubiquitous non-signaling 
  precursor, retinol, and functions by activating nuclear receptors that areligand-dependent 
  transcription factors present in responsive cells. The level of RA in the cell 
  isregulated by cytoplasmic retinoic acid bind proteins (CRABP) that function 
  as an intracellularbuffer. Experiments directly on frogs indicate that exogenous 
  RA results in hypomorphic limbdeformities (absence of limb structures), whereas 
  exogenous RA in association with aregeneration response results in a hypermorphic 
  response which includes the duplication ofstructures in the proximal-distal 
  and the formation of supernumerary limbs. In addition,exogenous RA in association 
  with tail regeneration results in a homeotic transformation of tailtissue into 
  limb tissue with the ectopic formation of clusters of supernumerary hindlimbs 
  fromthe wound site. The RA induced supernumerary limbs are morphologically similar 
  to thesupernumerary response observed in deformed frogs caught in the wild. 
  These morphologicalsimilarities raise the possibility that the limb deformities 
  observed in wild frog populations arecaused by chemical pollutants present in 
  the environment that disrupt RA signaling during limbdevelopment. There are 
  multiple ways that the RA signaling pathway could be affected byenvironmental 
  pollutants, including 1) RA signaling mimics, 2) RA antagonists, and 3)modifying 
  levels of CRABP. Evidence that chemical present in the environment can act tomimic 
  retinoid signaling exist from laboratory studies.
