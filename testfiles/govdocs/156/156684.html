              Information on Festivities in Colonial St. Louis: </font></p>
            <p><font color="#760501">The people of St. Louis loved feasts and 
              festivals. Every month of the year had at least one, and even Sundays 
              were days of merriment. Capt. Amos Stoddard of the U.S. Army observed 
              in 1804 that:</font></p>
            <p> <font color="#760501"><cite>"Perhaps the levities displayed and 
              the amusements pursued by the French people on Sunday may be considered 
              by some to border on Licentiousness. They attend mass in the morning 
              with great devotion; but after the exercises of the church are over, 
              they usually collect in parties and pass away their time in social 
              and merry intercourse. They play at billiards and other games, and 
              to balls and assemblies the Sundays are particularly devoted. To 
              those educated in regular and pious Protestant habits such parties 
              and amusements appear unreasonable, strange and odious. . . When 
              questioned relative to their gaiety on Sundays, they will answer 
              that men were made for happiness, and that the more they are able 
              to enjoy themselves the more acceptable they are to their creator." 
              </cite></font></p>
            <p><font color="#760501">Amusements included horse racing, although 
              there was no official track. There were two billiard rooms in St. 
              Louis as early as 1767, and a third was opened later. Dancing and 
              card-playing were also popular. Another day of celebration was the 
              annual Catholic feast day of St. Louis (the saint, not the city), 
              on August 25. Christmas and New Years were also special holidays 
              in early St. Louis. </font></p>
