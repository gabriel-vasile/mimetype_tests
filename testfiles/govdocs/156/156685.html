Dear Mr. Zwick:<BR>
                      you may have gotten some email from members of
amnesty international encouraging the just. dept to give compensation to
partners of lesbians and gays who were killed on Sept ll. I am a member
of Amnesty for the past 20 years and I vehemently oppose this effort of
Amnesty and I regret deeply that Amnesty would support such
compensation..<BR>
                     Gay and Lesbian partners have no legal
standing...any friend or casual acquaintance  could ask for compensation
if these are granted compensation...you would be opening the door to all
kinds of relationship compensation if this is granted...<BR>
                   Moreover, I dont want my tax dollars going to support
promiscuity, hedonism and licentiousness, a hallmark of the gay agenda.<BR>
                      Thank you for your time sir.<BR>
