<abstract>The objectives of this data acquisition project were to complete the downhole geophysical logging including video and flowmeter logging of two core holes (9A and 11A), which are the deepest wells at monitor well sites 0009AB and 0011AB.</abstract>
<purpose>
The goal of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan Biscayne Bay Coastal Wetlands Project (BBCWP) is to rehydrate wetlands and reduce point-source discharge to Biscayne Bay. The BBCWP will replace lost overland flow and partially compensate for the reduction in ground-water seepage by redistributing, through a spreader system, available surface water entering the area from regional canals. The proposed redistribution of freshwater flow across a broad front is expected to restore or enhance freshwater wetlands, tidal wetlands, and near shore bay habitat. A critical component of the BBCWP is the development of a realistic representation of ground-water flow within the karst Biscayne aquifer.  Mapping these ground-water flow units is key to the development of models that simulate ground-water flow from the Everglades and urban areas through the coastal wetlands to Biscayne Bay.  Because there is little detailed hydrogeologic data of the Surficial aquifer (to depth) in this area, the Biscayne Bay Coastal Wetlands Project Delivery Team installed two monitor-well sites and collected the necessary detailed hydrogeologic data.

The L-31 North Canal Seepage Management Pilot Project is intended to curtail easterly seepage emanating from within Everglades National Park (ENP). The pilot project is examining various seepage management technologies as well as operational changes that could be implemented to reduce the water losses from ENP. This project is in close proximity to Biscayne Bay so an effort has been made to combine ongoing work efforts at the two project areas.  The distribution of seepage into the L-31 North Canal and beneath it is not known with any degree of certainty today. A canal draw down experiment was conducted to provide additional field data that will be utilized to refine seepage estimates in the study area as well as determine aquifer parameters in the study area.

The Corps of Engineers contracted with a licensed drilling contractor to install two continuously cored monitor ground water wells in April-May 2004.

Prior to completion of the wells, the USGS completed geophysical logging of the wells.  The USGS hydrogeologist was on site while the drilling crew developed monitoring wells 9A and 11A for logging and during geophysical borehole logging of the deepest well at each of the two monitor wells.  The site USGS hydrogeologist (1) monitored the drilling contractor for adherence to correct borehole development and preparation for geophysical borehole logging; (2) ran geophysical logs, digital-image logs,video logs, flowmeter measurements; and (3) provided calculated computed vuggy-porosity logs.

The L-31 North Canal seepage manamgement pilot project is intended to curtail easterly seepage from within Everglades National Park (ENP).  The pilot project is examining various seepage menagement technologies was well as operational changes that could be implemented to reduce the water losses from ENP.  As this area is in close proimity to Biscayne Bay, the Biscayne Bay Coastal Wetlands well-site project was modified to combine efforts in both project areas.

The distribution of seepage into the L-31 North Canal and beneath it is not known with any degree of certainty today.  A canal draw down experiment was proposed to provide additional field data that will be utilized to refne seepage estimates in the study area as well as determine aquifer parameters in the study area.  The canal drawdown experiment was scheduled to be completed in two phases.  A dry-season test would be conducted toward the end of May 2004 and a wet-season test was scheduled for late July 2004.  Both portions of the test were planned for at least four days duration.  During the test multiple sets of hydrologic instrumentation were to be monitored on a continual basis.  In addition, during the dry-season test, downhole flow logging would be completed in two open-hole interval wells adjacent to the L31N Canal.

The USGS was to acquire geophysical logs using the fluid conductivity and temperature probes, and heat-pulse and spinner flowmeters at two coreholes specified by the Corps of Engineers.  The two coreholes would be logged during the second day of  the 48-hour duration of the drawdown test.  The drawdown test was scheduled for late May or early June 2004 during dry-season conditions.
