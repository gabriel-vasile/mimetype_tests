      <h1>Stanton's Address</h1>
      <h4>Delivered at the Seneca Falls Convention <br>
        July 19, 1848</h4>
      <hr>
      <img align="LEFT" src="vcecs.jpg" alt="Stanton in 1848"> 
      <p>We have met here today to discuss our rights and wrongs, civil and political, 
        and not, as some have supposed, to go into the detail of social life alone. 
        We do not propose to petition the legislature to make our husbands just, 
        generous, and courteous, to seat every man at the head of a cradle, and 
        to clothe every woman in male attire.</p>
      <p>None of these points, however important they may be considered by leading 
        men, will be touched in this convention. As to their costume, the gentlemen 
        need feel no fear of our imitating that, for we think it in violation 
        of every principle of taste, beauty, and dignity; notwithstanding all 
        the contempt cast upon our loose, flowing garments, we still admire the 
        graceful folds, and consider our costume far more artistic than theirs. 
        Many of the nobler sex seem to agree with us in this opinion, for the 
        bishops, priests, judges, barristers, and lord mayors of the first nation 
        on the globe, and the Pope of Rome, with his cardinals, too, all wear 
        the loose flowing robes, thus tacity acknowledging that the male attire 
        is neither dignified nor imposing. </p>
      <p>No, we shall not molest you in your philosophical experiments with stocks, 
        pants, high-heeled boots, and Russian belts. Yours be the glory to discover, 
        by personal experience, how long the kneepan can resist the terrible strapping 
        down which you impose, in how short time the well-developed muscles of 
        the throat can be reduced to mere threads by the constant pressure of 
        the stock, how high the heel of a boot must be to make a short man tall, 
        and how tight the Russian belt may be drawn and yet have wind enough left 
        to sustain life.</p>
      <p> But we are assembled to protest against a form of government existing 
        without the consent of the governed - to declare our right to be free 
        as man is free, to be represented in the government which we are taxed 
        to support, to have such isgraceful laws as give man the power to chastise 
        and imprison his wife, to take the wages which she earns, the property 
        which she inherits, and, in case of separation, the children of her love; 
        laws which make her the mere dependent on his bounty. It is to protest 
        against such unjust laws as these that we are assembled today, and to 
        have them, if possible, forever erased from our statute books, deeming 
        them a shame and a disgrace to a Christian republic in the nineteenth 
        century. We have met to uplift woman's fallen divinity upon an even pedestal 
        with man's. And, strange as it may seem to many, we now demand our right 
        to vote according to the declaration of the government under which we 
        live. </p>
      <p>This right no one pretends to deny. We need not prove ourselves equal 
        to Daniel Webster to enjoy this privilege, for the ignorant Irishman in 
        the ditch has all the civil rights he has. We need not prove our muscular 
        power equal to this same Irishman to enjoy this privilege, for the most 
        tiny, weak, ill-shaped stripling of twenty-one has all the civil rights 
        of the Irishman. We have no objection to discuss the question of equality, 
        for we feel that the weight of argument lies wholly with us, but we wish 
        the question of equality kept distinct from the question of rights, for 
        the proof of the one does not determine the truth of the other. All white 
        men in this country have the same rights, however they may differ in mind, 
        body, or estate. </p>
      <p>The right is ours. The question now is: how shall we get possession of 
        what rightfully belongs to us? We should not feel so sorely grieved if 
        no man who had not attained the full stature of a Webster, Clay, Van Buren, 
        or Gerrit Smith could claim the right of the elective franchise. But to 
        have drunkards, idiots, horse-racing, rum-selling rowdies, ignorant foreigners, 
        and silly boys fully recognized, while we ourselves are thrust out from 
        all the rights that belong to citizens, it is too grossly insulting to 
        the dignity of woman to be longer quietly submitted to. </p>
      <p>The right is ours. Have it, we must. Use it, we will. The pens, the tongues, 
        the fortunes, the indomitable wills of many women are already pledged 
        to secure this right. The great truth that no just government can be formed 
        without the consent of the governed we shall echo and re-echo in the ears 
        of the unjust judge, until by continual coming we shall weary him </p>
      <p>There seems now to be a kind of moral stagnation in our midst. Philanthropists 
        have done their utmost to rouse the nation to a sense of its sins. War, 
        slavery, drunkenness, licentiousness, gluttony, have been dragged naked 
        before the people, and all their abominations and deformities fully brought 
        to light, yet with idiotic laugh we hug those monsters to our breasts 
        and rush on to destruction. Our churches are multiplying on all sides, 
        our missionary societies, Sunday schools, and prayer meetings and innumerable 
        charitable and reform organizations are all inoperation, but still the 
        tide of vice is swelling, and threatens the destruction of everything, 
        and the battlements of righteousness are weak against the raging elements 
        of sin and death. </p>
      <p>Verily, the world waits the coming of some new element, some purifying 
        power, some spirit of mercy and love. The voice of woman has been silenced 
        in the state, the church, and the home, but man cannot fulfill his destiny 
        alone, he cannot redeem his race unaided. There are deep and tender chords 
        of sympathy and love in the hearts of the downfallen and oppressed that 
        woman can touch more skillfully than man. </p>
      <p>The world has never yet seen a truly great and virtuous nation, because 
        in the degradation of woman the very fountains of life are poisoned at 
        their source. It is vain to look for silver and gold from mines of copper 
        and lead. </p>
      <p>It is the wise mother that has the wise son. So long as your women are 
        slaves you may throw your colleges and churches to the winds. You can't 
        have scholars and saints so long as your mothers are ground to powder 
        between the upper and nether millstone of tyranny and lust. How seldom, 
        now, is a father's pride gratified, his fond hopes realized, in the budding 
        genius of his son! </p>
      <p>The wife is degraded, made the mere creature of caprice, and the foolish 
        son is heaviness to his heart. Truly are the sins of the fathers visited 
        upon the children to the third and fourth generation. God, in His wisdom, 
        has so linked the whole human family together that any violence done at 
        one end of the chain is felt throughout its length, and here, too, is 
        the law of restoration, as in woman all have fallen, so in her elevation 
        shall the race be recreated. </p>
      <p>&quot;Voices&quot; were the visitors and advisers of Joan of Arc. Do 
        not &quot;voices&quot; come to us daily from the haunts of poverty, sorrow, 
        degradation, and despair, already too long unheeded. Now is the time for 
        the women of this country, if they would save our free institutions, to 
        defend the right, to buckle on the armor that can best resist the keenest 
        weapons of the enemy -- contempt and ridicule. The same religious enthusiasm 
        that nerved Joan of Arc to her work nerves us to ours. In every generation 
        God calls some men and women for the utterance of truth, a heroic action, 
        and our work today is the fulfilling of what has long since been foretold 
        by the Prophet -- Joel 2:28: </p>
      <p>&quot;And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit 
        upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy.&quot; 
      </p>
      <p> We do not expect our path will be strewn with the flowers of popular 
        applause, but over the thorns of bigotry and prejudice will be our way, 
        and on our banners will beat the dark storm clouds of opposition from 
        those who have entrenched themselves behind the stormy bulwarks of custom 
        and authority, and who have fortified their position by every means, holy 
        and unholy. But we will steadfastly abide the result. Unmoved we will 
        bear it aloft. Undauntedly we will unfurl it to the gale, for we know 
        that the storm cannot rend from it a shred, that the electric flash will 
        but more clearly show to us the glorious words inscribed upon it, </p>
