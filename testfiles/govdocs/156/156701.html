	 <P><FONT CLASS="headermed">Black Studies in the Department of Labor,
		1897-1907</FONT></P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify"><I>The Department helped break new ground,
		but, in a climate of racial strife, suddenly abandoned the black studies
		effort</I></P> 
	 <P>By <A HREF="#*">Jonathan Grossman</A> <A NAME="**"></A></P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify;">At the dawn of the 20th century, when 8.5
		million blacks constituted about 12 percent of the population of the United
		States, according to the distinguished black scholar, William Edward Burghardt
		(W. E. B.) Du Bois, "not a single first&#8209;grade college in America
		undertook to give any considerable scientific attention to the American
		Negro."<SUP><A HREF="#1">1</A> </SUP>Yet between 1897 and 1903, the Department
		of Labor, then an agency without Cabinet status and forerunner of the present
		Bureau of Labor Statistics, published
		<A HREF="/oasam/programs/history/blackstudieslist.htm">nine investigations</A>,
		of varying length, importance, and point of view, about the condition of blacks
		in America. Du Bois himself prepared three of these studies. When, in 1906, Du
		Bois prepared another study for the Commissioner of Labor which he considered
		his finest sociological work, it was destroyed, willfully, according to its
		author. The fate of this 10th and last study raises fascinating questions.</P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify">These Department of Labor studies were
		closely related to the historically more famous Atlanta University
		publications. The first and the last departmental investigations were done by
		Atlanta University, and though other studies were independent, the relationship
		with Atlanta University was close. Both the Atlanta and the Department of Labor
		investigations were among pioneering "scientific" studies of the condition of
		blacks in America, and differed from the popular and primarily inspirational
		conferences at Hampton and Tuskegee Institutes which were "propaganda for
		social uplift."</P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify">The cast of characters in the drama of black
		studies at the Department of Labor was large. The stars were Carroll D. Wright,
		the distinguished Commissioner of Labor from 1885 to 1905; George G. Bradford,
		a forgotten pioneer of both the Atlanta University and Department of Labor
		studies; and W. E. B. Du Bois, the brilliant scholar later turned militant
		propagandist. Also important was the dramatic and ambiguous role of Charles P.
		Neill, who was trapped by the great racial crisis at the time he succeeded
		Carroll Wright as Commissioner of Labor. Was he, as Du Bois implied, the
		villain? Or more important from the view of public policy, do his actions point
		to the need for protecting men of basic integrity from social and political
		pressures?</P> 
	 <P><B>The origin of black studies</B></P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify">The origin of objective black studies is
		obscure, but scraps of evidence, though inconclusive, are intriguing. When
		Congress was debating in 1884 whether to create a Bureau of Labor, several
		newspapers commented on the fact that the bill failed to authorize the
		Commissioner of Labor to study conditions and employment of blacks. Senator
		Henry W. Blair of New Hampshire, though friendly to black aspirations, objected
		to special black studies because "there are no distinctions of race or color in
		the eyes of the law." Study of the condition of "the colored man is as much
		covered and protected by the scope of the bill as is the white man." <SUP><A
		HREF="#2">2</A></SUP></P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify">There is some evidence that when Carroll
		Wright came from Massachusetts to head the newly created United States Bureau
		of Labor in 1885, be planned a large-scale study of black workers. Wright,
		earlier in his career, had investigated the conditions of blacks.<SUP><A
		HREF="#3">3</A></SUP> Because the new Bureau was in the Department of Interior,
		Wright checked with his superior, the influential Secretary of Interior, Lucius
		Quintius Cincinnatus Lamar. Lamar, a former confederate General, and a former
		United States Senator from Mississippi, allegedly told Wright that such a study
		would be worthwhile, but that there would be "the devil to pay" in the South,
		if he, a Democrat from Mississippi, authorized Wright, a Republican from
		Massachusetts, to investigate conditions of blacks. Wright again sought
		authorization in 1888 from President Benjamin Harrison, and still later from
		President Grover Cleveland. Though the program finally undertaken by the
		Department under President William McKinley in 1897 was on a more modest scale
		than originally conceived, there is little doubt that Carroll Wright put the
		Bureau of Labor in the front line among serious investigators of the conditions
		of black Americans.<SUP><A HREF="#4">4</A></SUP></P> 
	 <P><B>The forgotten pioneer</B></P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify;">Sometimes relatively unknown individuals
		flit across the historical scene, make important contributions, and disappear.
		Such a person is George G. Bradford, trailblazer for both the Atlanta
		University and Department of Labor black studies. Bradford, a trustee of
		Atlanta University from 1895 to 1902, was a young Boston businessman and a
		Harvard graduate in finance (class of 1886) who made the study of life among
		blacks in America his leisure time activity. Along with the apostle of black
		higher education, President Horace Bumstead of Atlanta University, Bradford won
		the approval of the trustees of Atlanta University to initiate scientific
		studies of black city life.</P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify;">At the first Atlanta Conference held at the
		university in May 1896, Bradford described his plans to study the physical and
		moral condition of city blacks which, he said, had not been studied previously
		in any extensive or systematic way. Each year graduates of Atlanta would study
		a different phase of black life. The first investigation would concern itself
		with mortality among blacks in cities, which ran about twice the death rate for
		the white city population.<SUP><A HREF="#5">5</A></SUP></P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify;">Bradford invited the Department of Labor to
		cooperate with him and tabulate and publish the results. These statistics
		became the basis of the first of a pioneer series begun in 1897 by the
		Department of Labor dealing with the social and economic conditions of blacks.
		Both the Atlanta study and Department of Labor study used data gathered under
		Bradford's guidance by about 50 black volunteers, including graduates of black
		colleges along with prominent black doctors, ministers, lawyers, and teachers.
		According to the Department of Labor, exclusive reliance on black volunteers
		made the work quite difficult, but it secured the "interest of the leading
		colored men of the country, upon whom would depend the success of any practical
		measures of reform that might be suggested by the results of the
		investigation." And in the words of one of the investigators, the statistics
		were "more than usually accurate because of the investigators' knowledge of the
		character, habits and prejudices of the people." <SUP><A
		HREF="#6">6</A></SUP></P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify;">Although the Department of Labor Bulletin
		was based on the same raw data and covered most of the same subjects as the
		first two Atlanta University studies, it was more detailed, more restrained,
		and much duller than the Atlanta version. Both the Department of Labor and
		Atlanta University used identical material showing excessive mortality rates
		among blacks of all ages. Both the Department of Labor and Atlanta University
		noted the pathetically high death rate among black and white children under age
		5, with the black rate more than twice as high as the white. (The rates were 10
		to 20 times as high as modern comparable child-mortality statistics.) Both
		studies observed that black women to a greater extent than white women were
		breadwinners and of the 1,157 black families studied, 57 percent were supported
		wholly or in part by a female head. Both studies provided statistics that
		syphilis was more prevalent among blacks than among whites.</P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify;">By contrast with the Department of Labor,
		which presented data with only a little interpretation, the Atlanta University
		studies drew lessons to be applied. The Atlanta investigators followed the line
		of the "assimilationist" point of view, then in vogue among many educated
		blacks. They claimed that though blacks faced socially, politically, and
		economically unjust restrictions, many of their problems were
		self&#173;inflicted. There were aspects of life in which blacks had an almost
		equal chance with whites and in which they could in large measure control their
		destiny and solve their own problems. Thus, the Atlanta investigators claimed
		that the very high death rate could not be attributed to an unfavorable
		environment but "rather to the ignorance of the masses of the people and their
		disregard of the laws of health and morality." For them, the sad heritage of
		slavery with its "whipped women," separation of wives from husbands, and
		assignment of female slaves to other men, explained, but did not excuse. Many
		childhood diseases grew out of neglect and licentiousness. "Infants in their
		graves will rise up in judgment against this evil and adulterous generation,"
		wrote one investigator. "The <I>sine qua non </I>of a change for the better . .
		. is a higher social morality." <SUP><A HREF="#7">7</A></SUP></P> 
	 <P><B>Changing leadership</B></P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify;">Although he was not the founder, were it not
		for W. E. B. Du Bois, the Atlanta studies and the Department of Labor studies
		might have died unnoticed following their publications of the conditions of
		city blacks in 1897. Bradford, though he was to remain a trustee of Atlanta
		University, could not run a business in Boston and direct studies in Atlanta at
		the same time. As he slipped into oblivion, Du Bois not only took his place,
		but created a new mold for the study of socioeconomic conditions of blacks.</P>
	 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify;">W. E. B. Du Bois' later and greater fame
		came as a militant leader of black aspirations. But his training at German
		universities and his Ph. D. at Harvard in the 1890s inculcated in him a
		devotion to objectivity which won for him in his early career distinction as a
		careful and creative scholar.</P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify;">The black studies of the period grew out of
		the "scientific altruism" of the age. Carroll Wright, George Bradford, and W.
		E. B. Du Bois all believed that truth was the most potent medicine for curing
		the evils of society. Carroll Wright, for example, argued that labor statistics
		was a means of promoting the "material, social, intellectual, and moral
		prosperity" of the working people.<SUP><A HREF="#8">8</A></SUP> As the range of
		Wright's investigations grew broader, it was natural that he would also study
		the condition of black Americans. Bradford, in outlining plans for the Atlanta
		study, observed that some of the information which the investigators would
		uncover might be unpleasant. But, he warned, "if we are to make any progress,
		we must have the courage to look unpleasant facts in the face."<SUP><A
		HREF="#9">9</A></SUP> Similarly Du Bois believed that "there is only one sure
		basis of social reform and that is Truth &#151; a careful, detailed knowledge
		of the essential facts of each social problem. Without this there is no logical
		starting place for reform and uplift."<SUP><A HREF="#10">10</A></SUP> Racial
		prejudice, Du Bois believed, was based on ignorance. The remedy for outrageous
		treatment of blacks, based on doctrines of racial inferiority, was truth. Facts
		would prove that a man's color limited neither his capacity nor his opportunity
		to share in the rewards of society.<SUP><A HREF="#11">11</A></SUP></P> 
	 <P><B>Du Bois and Wright</B></P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify;">At the time that Atlanta University and the
		Department of Labor were cooperating on their study of the condition of blacks
		in various cities, Du Bois was completing his monumental study of Philadelphia
		blacks and had resolved to make his life goal the scientific study of black
		Americans. He would study what up to that time many concerned citizens merely
		discussed.</P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify;">Du Bois wrote Carroll Wright, who encouraged
		him. At Wright's suggestion he thought out methods of studying black industrial
		development and then wrote Wright a long letter suggesting preliminary studies
		which "would by allaying false notions and prejudices prepare the public mind
		for a larger work." Du Bois then suggested 10 different plans of study. Wright
		accepted one of the plans but agreed to pay for it only if he were satisfied
		with it.<SUP><A HREF="#12">12</A></SUP></P> 
	 <P><B>Shaping black studies</B></P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify;">Du Bois submitted to Wright his manuscript
		"The Negroes of Farmville, Virginia: A Social Study." Wright liked and paid for
		this "first of a series of investigations of small, well&#8209;defined groups
		of Negroes in various parts of the country." This little research gem served as
		the model for many later studies.</P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify;">Du Bois described Farmville, in Prince
		Edward County, as easy going, gossipy, and conservative. Farmville was a market
		town which attracted young country people, while at the same time, it sent boys
		and girls to Richmond, Norfolk, Baltimore, and New York. Farmville acted as a
		clearing house by training raw country lads in industrial life, and sending
		more or less well&#8209;equipped recruits to metropolitan areas.</P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify;">Du Bois lived with the Farmville Negroes,
		joined their social life, visited their homes, and asked each family and
		individual 21 questions concerning birth, sex, and age of each family member,
		occupation, wages, employment, landownership, and church attendance.</P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify;">Du Bois reported that 1,350 Farmville blacks
		made up about 60 percent of the population. A moderate excess of women over men
		indicated some migration of men looking for better economic opportunity. Du
		Bois compared the Farmville age distribution with that estimated for blacks in
		the United States, with the total U.S. population, and with that of European
		countries. He then explained the excessive proportions of old people and of
		children under age 15 by people in their prime working ages migrating to cities
		and leaving their children with grandparents. This also accounted for the small
		proportion of black children in cities like Philadelphia.</P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify;">In studying marriage he found that the
		second generation of freedmen postponed marriage for economic reasons. Delayed
		marriage, combined with easy sexual morality a by-product of slavery, reduced
		the sober influence of family life. Du Bois found his study of miscegenation
		very difficult because of racial intermingling going back for generations.
		However, he classified by personal appearance 750 individuals of whom 333 were
		apparently of unmixed Negro blood, 219 were brown, while 153 were yellow, or
		lighter, evidence of considerable infusion of white blood.</P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify;">Du Bois reported that illiteracy was
		diminishing, but 23 percent of blacks between 10 and 20 years of age could
		neither read nor write. In investigating occupations, he found that
		entrepreneurs made up about 2 percent of the work force, domestic and
		industrial workers about 60 percent, and those not gainfully occupied about 25
		percent. The jobs open to black men were limited, and jobs for black women were
		restricted to domestic service and housewifery. Du Bois also collected data on
		many other subjects such as wages, family income and budgets, value of black
		property, secret and beneficial societies, slums, gambling, liquor, local
		prostitution, and group, social, and religious life.</P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify;">Du Bois concluded that studies of
		communities like Farmville brought to light good, bad, and indifferent
		conditions. One visitor might find Farmville blacks shiftless and lewd. Another
		might find them industrious, with steadily advancing educational and moral
		standards. These contradictory statements were both partially true, but when
		stated without reservation, they were misleading. Though Du Bois found the
		degree of sloth and immorality in Farmville dangerous, be believed that an
		impartial investigation showed that the industrious black citizen "best
		represents, on the whole, the general tendencies of the group." <SUP><A
		HREF="#13">13</A></SUP></P> 
	 <P><B>The black belt</B></P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify;">While Du Bois was studying blacks in
		Farmville for the Department of Labor, he was selected as a professor in
		sociology at the University of Atlanta and given the responsibility of
		directing a thoroughly scientific investigation of the conditions of black
		life. Beginning with its third publication in 1898 on <I>Some Efforts of
		American Negroes For Their Own Social Betterment, </I>the Atlanta studies
		became the reflection of Du Bois' scholarship and personality. Du Bois later
		claimed "without undue boasting that between 1896 and 1920 there was no study
		of race problems in America which did not depend in some degree upon the
		investigations made at Atlanta University." <SUP><A HREF="#14">14</A></SUP></P>
	 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify;">Du Bois continued Atlanta University's
		association with Carroll Wright. One result was a study called "The Negro in
		the Black Belt: Some Social Sketches," which the Department of Labor published
		in 1899. "The Negro in the Black Belt" was based on notes made by members of
		the senior class of Atlanta University who had firsthand knowledge of
		conditions among small groups of blacks whom they described. It is among the
		poorest works appearing under Du Bois' name because the evidence was skimpy,
		and Du Bois drew broad conclusions based more on his personal knowledge than on
		the research of his students.<SUP><A HREF="#15">15</A></SUP></P> 
	 <P><B>Labor Department black studies, 1901-03</B></P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify;">Although Atlanta University and the
		Department of Labor continued to cooperate, they also went their separate
		ways.<SUP><A HREF="#16">16</A></SUP> Starting in January 1901, the Department
		of Labor published four studies by other investigators modeled on Du Bois'
		Farmville, Va., report, and a fifth study based on Du Bois' theme of the
		Atlanta investigation of black self-betterment.</P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify;">Of the studies following Du Bois' Farmville
		pattern, two were by William Taylor Thom, a Virginia college teacher of history
		and English who had written on Shakespeare and Chaucer and who had a Ph. D.
		from Johns Hopkins University. Carroll Wright authorized Thom to study first
		"The Negroes of Sandy Spring, Maryland," then "The Negroes of Litwalton,
		Virginia," and finally "The True Re&#173;formers," a black self-help
		enterprise.</P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify;">Sandy Spring in Montgomery County, Md., had
		been settled largely by Quakers who believed slavery was immoral and had
		emancipated their slaves before the Civil War. The fact that blacks had been
		free for several generations, Thom claimed, warranted a special investigation
		into the social and economic effect of freedom. However, his analysis of
		property ownership failed to prove that blacks whose families had been free
		before the Civil War had acquired more property than those who had been freed
		after the Civil War.<SUP><A HREF="#17">17</A></SUP></P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify;">Thom also studied Litwalton, Va., with a
		perma&#173;nent population of about 400 blacks and 250 whites. The fortunes of
		the area rose and fell with one industry &#151; oystering &#151; in which
		relatively large amounts of money could be earned by hard work and good luck.
		However, according to Thom, eco&#173;nomic conditions were not good, for blacks
		failed to take advantage of opportunities open to them.<SUP><A
		HREF="#18">18</A></SUP></P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify;">At Carroll Wright's suggestion, Thom
		followed his two "Farmville type" reports with a short study of the True
		Reformers headquartered at Richmond, Va. Wright asked Thom to investigate their
		work because it "illustrates in very positive ways the social and economic
		attitudes of the Negro race."<SUP><A HREF="#19">19</A></SUP> Thom reported that
		"The 'True Reformers' constitutes probably the most remarkable Negro
		organization in the country." It was founded in 1881 by an ex-slave with 100
		members and a capital of $150. By the end of 1901 it provided death and sick
		benefits for 50,000 dues-paying members. Other "affiliated by-products" were a
		savings bank, a black economic journal, an old folks' home, cooperative grocery
		and general merchandise stores, and a hotel .<SUP><A
		HREF="#20">20</A></SUP></P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify;">In November 1901, Carroll Wright received
		from Dr. J. Bradford Laws a paper on Louisiana planta&#173;tion blacks. He
		agreed to pay Dr. Laws $125 for his study and made some changes "to better
		enable comparison with former Negro articles which we have published." Law's
		report was among the most derogatory of any of the Department of Labor's black
		studies.</P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify;">Sugar plantation Negroes were among the most
		backward in the United States. Laws reported con&#173;ditions at Cinclare
		Central Factory and Calumet plantation, La., which were much worse than at
		Farmville, Litwalton, or Sandy Spring. The illiteracy rate was over 70 percent,
		and Louisiana blacks had low earning potential. According to Laws, plantation
		blacks never looked to the future and it was difficult to get them to work when
		they had a little money. Laws commented that:</P> 
	 <P STYLE="
">&#147;They very much dislike the gang system of labor and roam all over the
		country seeking jobwork, when they can work as they please.... As a race they
		are strong and healthy, but as they abuse themselves, they are not as a general
		thing, long&#8209;lived. In trouble they are helpless. They lack confidence in
		themselves and are not ingenious in finding expedients. They are not the petty
		chicken thieves painted at the north. . . . They appear to have little
		intellectual and little moral capacity . . . .&#148;<SUP><A
		HREF="#21">21</A></SUP></P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify">Du Bois had also recognized the "lowest
		economic depth of the black American peasant," but unlike Laws, he explained
		that black degradation had grown out of "a slave ancestry and a system of
		unrequited toil." He compared the forced labor of blacks on plantations in
		Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas to that of serfs under feudalism. When
		Louisiana plantation blacks had tried to improve their condition in 1880 and
		1886, their strikes were brutally smashed. Laws' lack of perspective may have
		resulted in a report which was factually accurate but misleading.<SUP><A
		HREF="#22">22</A></SUP></P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify;">At the same time that Carroll Wright was
		work&#173;ing with Laws on the article on degraded plantation blacks of
		Louisiana, he was negotiating with Richard R. Wright, Jr., son of the president
		of a black college in Savannah, Ga., who had cooperated with the first
		Department of Labor study on the "Condi&#173;tions of the Negro in Various
		Cities." Carroll Wright agreed to pay Richard Wright $100 for a "social survey"
		of the blacks of Xenia, Ohio.</P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify;">The Xenia, Ohio, investigation turned out to
		be an excellent study. It was the only Department of Labor report on Northern
		blacks, many of whom could trace their ancestry to runaway slaves but who had
		been free for several generations. Richard Wright's report showed substantial
		black economic and social achievements. The degree of literacy was high. There
		were two black physicians and several other professionals. About 85
		entrepreneurs con&#173;ducted 75 businesses, while other blacks were in skilled
		trades, clerical work, or owned farms. Though many blacks remained in
		low-status occupations, such as common labor and domestic service,
		earn&#173;ings were much higher than in Farmville, Sandy Spring, and other
		black communities studied, and blacks owned a considerable amount of
		property.<SUP><A HREF="#23">23</A></SUP></P> 
	 <P><B>Negro landholders of Georgia</B></P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify;">While Thom, Laws, and Wright were following
		the pattern set by Du Bois' Farmville investigation, Du Bois himself was
		striking out in new directions. His study of black landholders in Georgia,
		based on careful analysis of primary source documents, was made up of
		painstakingly developed tables of statistics and maps of Georgia showing black
		population county by county for each decade between 1790 and 1890. Landholdings
		were analyzed in those counties with substantial black populations, and tables
		in&#173;cluded such items as acres of land owned by blacks and assessed
		valuation of the land. Du Bois must have slaved away countless hours extracting
		information from reports of the Comptroller-Generals of the State of Georgia
		which he supplemented with infor&#173;mation obtained from tax receivers of
		individual counties who held the manuscript records with their separate lists
		of white and black taxpayers. Labor Department officials reviewed and checked
		these materials, map by map, arid table by table. The end result was a
		dry-as-dust study of changes in land&#173;ownership over decades of time.</P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify;">Yet even in this monotonous study there is
		that powerful undercurrent of black aspiration which distinguishes so much of
		Du Bois' work. For Du Bois believed that the relation of blacks to ownership of
		the soil was of tremendous significance. By showing how the emancipated black
		and his children acquired land, Du Bois felt he was developing an index
		measuring the success of the freedman's struggle upward. By 1900, blacks, who
		comprised nearly one-half the population of Georgia, owned only 4 percent of
		the total value of assessed property in Georgia. To an outsider these meager
		holdings might not be strong evidence of economic progress. But Du Bois showed
		that whatever little the black had acquired had been done against heavy odds,
		and that the value of black holdings was rising both absolutely and
		proportionately to white ownership. From these facts, Du Bois concluded
		hopefully:</P> 
	 <P STYLE="
text-align:justify;">"The Georgia Negro is in the midst of an unfinished cycle
		of property accumulation. He has steadily acquired property since the war, and
		in fully 100 counties he has continued this steady increase in the last
		decade."<SUP><A HREF="#24">24</A></SUP></P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify">Du Bois used the material gathered for his
		Department of Labor study in a less restrained fashion in his famous early
		book, <I>The Souls of Black Folk, </I>in which he substituted "throbbing human
		souls for statistics." As an example he took Doherty County in the Georgia
		black belt, which had no black land&#173;holders on its tax rolls in 1870.
		Decade by decade, little by little, blacks acquired land which totaled 15,000
		acres in the early 20th century. If America were truly a land of opportunity
		for all her sons, Du Bois observed, "we might call such a result small or even
		insignificant. But for a few thousand poor ignorant field hands" to acquire
		even a little property, meant a "bitter struggle, a hard and soul-sickening
		battle with the world." These 15,000 acres were "proof of no little weight of
		the worth and ability of the Negro people." <SUP><A HREF="#25">25</A></SUP></P>
	 
	 <P><B>Different points of view</B></P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify;">The Department of Labor studies varied not
		only in quality but also in point of view. Some of the attitudes expressed in
		these studies will strike the present-day reader as unusual. They are reported
		here to express the tenor of the times and the attitudes of the investigators.
		For example, different investigators showed different attitudes toward sexual
		morality. Du Bois described varying moral standards among different groups of
		blacks, praised virtuous family life among better class blacks, and explained
		the behavior of lower class blacks as a heritage of slavery and the problems of
		newly emancipated peoples in coping with the new environment. Thom, though not
		basically anti-black, nevertheless, found in Sandy Spring deterioration rather
		than progress. Dr. J. Bradford Laws reported that plantation blacks had only
		vague "notions of the marriage relations" and he severely criticized their
		sexual mores both inside and outside of marriage.</P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify;">On "innate" black characteristics, Du Bois
		and Richard R. Wright, Jr., cultured men themselves, showed faith in the
		ability of lower class blacks to rise. Thom explained the alleged degeneration
		in Sandy Spring blacks as possibly being caused by "less active leadership on
		the part of whites," or possibly by "a reversion toward ancestral type. . . ."
		The racist Dr. Laws branded blacks as hopelessly inferior.</P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify;">Perhaps the greatest difference in view grew
		out of Du Bois' observation in the Farmville study that the "group life of the
		Farmville Negroes" was:</P> 
	 <P STYLE="
">"Pervaded by a peculiar hopefulness on the part of the people themselves. No
		one of them doubts in the least that one day black people <I>will </I>have all
		the rights they are now striving for, and that the Negro <I>will </I>be
		recognized among the earth's great peoples."</P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify">Richard R. Wright, Jr. agreed. He concluded
		that "The Negroes of Xenia are of a hopeful mood almost to unit&#160; [sic] . .
		. the future will see the Negroes better their condition as their environment
		becomes better." By contrast Thom found little hopefulness either in Sandy
		Spring or Litwalton. Some more successful blacks saw things getting better, but
		some older blacks declared that though the younger set might read better and be
		worth more than their fathers, "in manner and character they were distinctly
		degenerates. In this opinion the whites of the community seem to coincide." Dr.
		Laws was even more derogatory and concluded that "conditions have improved but
		little, if any, since freedom was given them." <SUP><A
		HREF="#26">26</A></SUP></P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify;">What accounts for such radically different
		viewpoints? One factor might be that conditions of blacks were radically
		different in such areas as Farmville, Va., Sandy Spring, Md., Calumet
		Plantation, La., or Xenia, Ohio. Another factor could be the race and, even
		more important, the attitude of the investigator. William Taylor Thom explained
		that blacks might respond differently to Du Bois who was "an educated member of
		their own race" than to an investigator like himself who was a "member of the
		dominant race." Or perhaps another factor might be implicit in the lines of the
		black poet Paul Dunbar which Du Bois quoted on the page facing the introduction
		of the first study he supervised for Atlanta University:</P> 
	 <P>The sky of brightest grey seems dark <BR><SPAN>&#160;&#160; </SPAN>To
		one whose sky was ever white, <BR>To one who never knew a spark
		<BR><SPAN>&#160;&#160; </SPAN>Thro' all his life of love or light, <BR>The
		greyest cloud seems overbright .<SUP><A HREF="#27">27</A></SUP></P> 
	 <P><B>The decline of black studies</B></P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify;">The Department of Labor's investigations of
		blacks was making it the leading center of black studies in America. The
		Department published more investigations than did Atlanta University; it
		presented more points of view; and though it was perennially short of money, it
		had fewer budget problems than did the poverty-striken university which had to
		rely on voluntary contributions. To a large degree, the Atlanta University
		studies depended on questionnaires sent through the mail, which Carroll Wright
		three decades earlier had found unreliable. Labor Department studies were based
		on firsthand investigations and primary source documents. Moreover, the
		Department did not suffer the disability of Atlanta University. Du Bois
		explained: "We never 'belonged'; we remained unrecognized in learned societies
		and academic groups. We rated merely as Negroes studying Negroes. . . ." By
		contrast, Carroll Wright definitely "belonged." He was a giant in academia,
		president of the American Statistical Association, and influential in other
		scholarly societies .<SUP><A HREF="#28">28</A></SUP></P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify;">But suddenly the Department of Labor lost
		interest in black studies. One reason was that the fight to deprive black
		Southerners of their rights was reaching a climax. Following the 1896 decision
		of Plessy <I>v. Ferguson, </I>establishing the validity of "separate but equal"
		facilities, nearly all Southern States passed "Jim Crow" laws enforcing racial
		segregation. As Du Bois explained, "a legal caste system based on race and
		color, had been openly grafted on the democratic constitution of the United
		States." <SUP><A HREF="#29">29</A></SUP> Calm discussion of economic and social
		conditions of blacks was becoming difficult.</P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify;">A simpler explanation of loss of interest in
		black studies was the shortage of money and the demotion early in 1903 of the
		independent Department of Labor to a mere bureau in the newly created
		Department of Commerce and Labor, in which the Secretary had "authority to
		rearrange the statistical work of the bureaus" in the Department. Carroll
		Wright was ready to quit to become President of Clark College, but at the
		request of President Theodore Roosevelt, hung on for 2 years longer as
		Commissioner of Labor. <SUP><A HREF="#30">30</A></SUP></P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify;">The subordinated Bureau of Labor published
		only one black study, "The Negroes of Xenia, Ohio," which had already been in
		progress before its demotion. Wright's successor, Charles P. Neill, wrote Dr.
		Carl Kelsey of the University of Pennsylvania, that he "had not intended to
		continue that series of studies on Negroes."<SUP><A HREF="#31">31</A></SUP></P>
	 
	 <P><B>The Lowndes County investigation</B></P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify;">But Du Bois, still working on the premise
		that "truth will make us free" was tireless in his efforts for further
		investigations of conditions of the American black. He sought support from
		Carroll Wright and bombarded him with plans. Wright found particularly
		appealing Du Bois' proposal to study social and economic conditions of blacks
		in Lowndes County, Ala., in the heart of the black belt.</P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify;">Wright blew hot and cold on the Lowndes
		County study. The following are excerpts of some of Carroll Wright's letters to
		W.E.B. Du Bois:</P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify;">"I am not certain now whether I can take up
		any of the subjects which you suggest, but before deciding definitely I would
		like to know your idea of the first subject which you name that is, a study of
		conditions in Lowndes County, Alabama.<SUP><A HREF="#32">32</A></SUP></P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify">"I think I may be able to authorize the
		Lowndes County study, provided I can pay for the report you make after the
		Month of June, 1903.<SUP><A HREF="#33">33</A></SUP></P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify">"I do not believe it will be possible for us
		in the near future to take up the question of the Lowndes County Negroes. This
		is a financial question with us at the present time."<SUP><A
		HREF="#34">34</A></SUP></P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify">After Carroll Wright retired, Commissioner of
		Labor Charles P. Neill alternately raised and dashed Du Bois' hopes. He
		telegraphed on June 26, 1905:</P> 
	 <P>"Inform me of the cost of study . . . Wire reply."</P> 
	 <P>Then on July 7, 1905, Neill explained:</P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify;">"At the time I wired you at Atlanta, we had
		some funds available . . . and not being able to get in touch with you, we
		closed an agreement for (other) work . . . if we have anything available at the
		end of the present fiscal year, I <I>will </I>be glad to take up the matter
		with you at that time. . . ."</P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify">Early in February 1906 Du Bois met with Neill
		and must have been very persuasive, for Neill shifted somewhat from his
		position against more black studies, but he stated that Du Bois' would "be the
		only study of the Negro I would care to have made." On February 16, 1906, Neill
		rejected a black study by Monroe N. Work, on the grounds that he had already
		made "partial arrangements" for a study of black workers. On May 7, 1906, Neill
		wrote to Richard R. Wright, Jr., rejecting a study he had suggested because of
		plans to have Du Bois make a "comprehensive study" of a black community. Neill
		received a comprehensive outline from Du Bois and met with him in Washington in
		June of 1906. Then followed a series of letters in the summer of 1906 from
		Neill to Du Bois in which the funds for the study were promised and deadlines
		set.</P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify;">After 5 years of frustration and delay, Du
		Bois began what he considered the most important survey of black Americans up
		to that time. Du Bois wrote in his <I>Autobiography</I>:</P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify;">"I wanted to take Lowndes County, Alabama,
		in a former slave state with a large majority of Negroes, and make a social and
		economic study from the earliest times when documents were available, down to
		the present; supplemented by studies of official records and a present
		house-to-house canvass of Negroes.... Helped by Monroe Work.&#133;and R. R.
		Wright&#133;and a dozen or more local employees, I settled at the Calhoun
		School and began the study.</P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify;">"It was carried on with all sorts of
		difficulties, including financing&#133;and with the greeting of some of my
		agents with shotguns in certain parts of the county; but it was eventually
		finished. The difficult schedules were tabulated and I made chronological maps
		of the division of the land; I considered the distribution of Labor; the
		relation of landlord and tenant; the political organization and the family life
		and the distribution of the population &#133;."<SUP><A
		HREF="#35">35</A></SUP></P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify;">The scope and difficulty of the study is
		borne out by extracts from Neill's letters to Du Bois in the fall of 1906 which
		reveal that 6,000 families were to be studied and 10,000 copies of the Lowndes
		County schedules ordered printed. In addition, one or two agents from the
		Bureau were to be sent to Lowndes County to examine records of mortgages,
		liens, and crime, and records of the justice of the peace. These agents were
		also to secure information from white men regarding politics and sexual
		morality and were to take a census of white workers. Neill appeared a bit
		uncertain about the use of information collected and on October 17, he wrote Du
		Bois:</P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify;">"I am not quite sure that the schedules
		which you have used for a colored census will serve for the census of white
		laborers; if not, I would suggest that you send me a form of schedule for this
		purpose at once."</P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify;">Recognizing the problem of resistance, Neill
		on November 7 wrote:</P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify;">"I note what you say with reference to the
		difficulty of securing schedules in certain outlying districts, and if this
		difficulty is great and likely to arouse considerable antagonism, the canvass
		of families in these districts may be abandoned. Nevertheless, I trust that you
		will make the canvass as complete as possible."</P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify">In the same letter, he assured the author
		that the law division of the Bureau had begun compiling laws and court
		decisions for Du Bois on selected subjects, a task Neill found "very
		considerable."</P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify;">Aside from a letter 2 weeks later telling Du
		Bois that he would have to have a special map made because those commercially
		available were inadequate, there is no further record because the method of
		filing correspondence was changed in a way which made it more difficult for
		later researchers to trace.</P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify;">Du Bois, in his <I>Autobiography, </I>gives
		a skimpy version of his side of the story:</P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify;">&#147;<I>The report was finished by hand
		with no copy, </I>and rushed to Washington. I was criticized and I spent some
		weeks there in person, revising and perfecting it. It was finally accepted by
		the government, and $2,000 paid for it, most of which went back to the
		University. . . .</P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify;">&#147;I finally approached the Bureau and
		tried to find out when it would be published and was told <I>the Bureau had
		decided not to publish the manuscript, </I>since it &#145;touched on political
		matters.&#146; I was astonished and disappointed, but after a year I went back
		to them again and asked if they would allow me to have the manuscript since
		they were not going to use it. <I>They told me it had been destroyed!
		</I>(Italics added.) <SUP><A HREF="#36">36</A></SUP></P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify">So ended the early Department of Labor black
		studies effort. More than a decade elapsed before the Bureau again studied
		conditions of black workers.</P> 
	 <P><B>An exercise in speculation</B></P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify;">Why, after so major an effort, was Du Bois'
		work destroyed? One reason may have been that the Bureau of Labor was already
		under attack because of its reports on child labor which some Southern
		Congressmen charged were "vile and slanderous upon our people." Senator Lee S.
		Overman of North Carolina later told his Senate colleagues that he protested to
		the Secretary of Commerce and Labor, Charles Nagel, who promised that some of
		the material would not be published.<SUP><A HREF="#37">37</A></SUP></P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify;">The problem the Bureau of Labor faced can be
		surmised from the experience of the Department of Justice. A U.S. attorney
		described a case involving J. W. Dixon, sheriff of Lowndes County, the same
		county Du Bois was studying. When the Grand Jury investigated an incredibly
		brutal case of forced labor, "five Dixon brothers rode up on their horses at 12
		o'clock Saturday night" to warn one of the grand jurors "what to expect."
		"These Dixons," the U.S. attorney observed, "are men of the highest political
		and financial influence&#133;.They are large planters and control a great deal
		of labor....They are said to have killed several men. It is believed that
		witnesses are practically compelled to perjure their souls because they fear
		their lives&#133;" The Dixons were not indicted.<SUP><A HREF="#38">38</A></SUP>
		In the light of its own and Department of Justice experiences, Bureau of Labor
		officials might have doubts about publishing Du Bois' investigation of social
		and economic conditions in Lowndes County.</P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify;">Another difficulty may have been Du Bois'
		growing militancy. While working in Lowndes County, he received news of the
		Atlanta riot of 1906 in which white mobs with police support invaded the
		Atlanta ghetto, killed four blacks, and wantonly destroyed black property. "I
		took the next train for Atlanta and my family," he wrote. A "poor Negro in
		Central Georgia...had been lynched, and...his knuckles were on exhibition at a
		grocery store." How could a scholar remain detached, Du Bois asked, when his
		black brothers were being starved, beaten, and lynched?<SUP><A
		HREF="#39">39</A>&#160; </SUP>He expressed his bitterness in his Litany of
		Atlanta, written on the train from Lowndes County to Atlanta:</P> 
	 <P>"Doth not this justice of hell stink in Thy nostrils, O God&#133;.Sit no
		longer dumb, Lord God, deaf to our prayers and dumb to our dumb
		suffering.&#160; Surely Thou, too, are not white, O Lord, a pale, bloodless,
		heartless thing!"<SUP><A HREF="#40">40</A></SUP></P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify;">Du Bois' attacks against Booker T.
		Washington may have been a factor in the rejection of his study. Not only did
		many blacks consider Washington as their peerless leader, but whites also
		treated him as the spokesman of black aspirations. But Du Bois challenged
		Washington's implicit acceptance of black inferiority in return for modest
		economic rewards. President Theodore Roosevelt used Booker T. Washington as his
		power broker for Federal awards to blacks. Both Washington and Roosevelt
		considered Du Bois dangerous. And Booker T. Washington has been charged with
		using this power to throttle opponents. In an era of racial hatred, it would
		not have been hard to suppress an investigation of politics, living conditions,
		crime, landlord&#8209;tenant relations, debt, economic peonage, miscegenation,
		and sexual morality in a county in the heart of the black belt.</P> 
	 <P><B>Statistical suicide?</B></P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify;">Du Bois blamed the Bureau of Labor and
		Commissioner of Labor, Charles Neill, for the destruction of his Lowndes County
		study. That the Bureau and its Commissioner would do such a thing seems
		unbelievable. After all, the foundation upon which the Bureau was built was
		faithful investigation and fearless reporting. The mishandling of statistics,
		Carroll Wright said, was a "crime" punished by the "unwritten law" which
		sentences the "man who prostitutes the cause of humanity."<SUP><A
		HREF="#41">41</A></SUP></P> 
	 <P>Although Charles Neill did not attain the stature of Carroll Wright
		whose place he took, he was a thoughtful scholar with a reputation for ability,
		integrity, and courage. He was a leader in the Catholic movements for ethical
		social conduct. He had backed Du Bois while he was investigating in Lowndes
		County. During his term as Commissioner, the Bureau investigated working
		conditions of women and children and industrial accidents. Neill created so
		many enemies because of his reports that his reconfirmation as Commissioner of
		Labor Statistics was twice rejected by the Senate .<SUP><A
		HREF="#42">42</A></SUP></P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify;">Yet as incongruous as it might seem, Du Bois
		was able to make a strong case in his charges against Neill. In the climate of
		the times, Du Bois' study may have been too hot to handle.</P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify;">Scholars like to say "tell the truth and let
		the chips fall where they may." This is possible under conditions where reason
		can prevail. But sometimes when human passions are involved, people do not want
		their convictions challenged by fact. Such was the issue of the race relations
		in 1907 and 1908.</P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify;">In this atmosphere Du Bois in part recanted
		his earlier philosophy. "I regarded it as axiomatic that the world wanted to
		learn the truth," he wrote. "This was of course but a young man's idealism, not
		by any means false, but also never universally true." Without abandoning
		scholarship, Du Bois, in addition, became a propagandist for black social
		equality.</P> 
	 <P STYLE="text-align:justify;">Neill also, like Du Bois, believed in the
		search for truth. But did he also have his limits? Did he consider the problems
		of publishing Du Bois' report tantamount to statistical suicide for the Bureau?
		Did Neill think he could surrender on one front and still continue objective
		research in other areas? The fact remains that the Bureau's failure to publish
		Du Bois' report or to return the data to him, led Du Bois to point an accusing
		finger at Neill. In his Autobiography, Du Bois wrote:</P>
