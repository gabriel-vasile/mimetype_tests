  JUSTICE O'CONNOR, with whom JUSTICE BREYER joins except as to a portion of
Part I, dissenting.

  I dissent from the Court's disposition of this case.  I agree with the Court
that the issue before us is whether the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA)
is a proper exercise of Congress' power to enforce S5 of the Fourteenth
Amendment.  But as a yardstick for measuring the constitutionality of RFRA, the
Court uses its holding in Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v.                          _________________________________________________
Smith, 494 U. S. 872 (1990), the decision that prompted Congress to enact RFRA______
as a means of more rigorously enforcing the Free Exercise Clause.  I remain of
the view that Smith was wrongly decided, and I would use this case to reexamine              _____
the Court's holding there.  Therefore, I would direct the parties to brief the
question whether Smith represents the correct understanding of the Free Exercise                 _____
Clause and set the case for reargument.  If the Court were to correct the
misinterpretation of the Free Exercise Clause set forth in Smith, it would                                                           ______
simultaneously put our First Amendment jurisprudence back on course and allay
the legitimate concerns of a majority in Congress who believed that Smith                                                                    _____
improperly restricted religious liberty.  We would then be in a position to
review RFRA                                95-2074 - DISSENT

in light of a proper interpretation of the Free Exercise Clause.
                                        I
  I agree with much of the reasoning set forth in Part III-A of the Court's
opinion.  Indeed, if I agreed with the Court's standard in Smith, I would join                                                           ______
the opinion.  As the Court's careful and thorough historical analysis shows,
Congress lacks the "power to decree the substance of the Fourteenth Amendment's                                        _________
restrictions on the States."  Ante, at 9 (emphasis added).  Rather, its power                              _____
under S5 of the Fourteenth Amendment extends only to enforcing the Amendment's                                                     _________
provisions.  In short, Congress lacks the ability independently to define or
expand the scope of constitutional rights by statute.  Accordingly, whether
Congress has exceeded its S5 powers turns on whether there is a "congruence and
proportionality between the injury to be prevented or remedied and the means
adopted to that end."  Ante, at 10.  This recognition does not, of course, in                       _____
any way diminish Congress' obligation to draw its own conclusions regarding the
Constitution's meaning.  Congress, no less than this Court, is called upon to
consider the requirements of the Constitution and to act in accordance with its
dictates.  But when it enacts legislation in furtherance of its delegated
powers, Congress must make its judgments consistent with this Court's exposition
of the Constitution and with the limits placed on its legislative authority by
provisions such as the Fourteenth Amendment.
  The Court's analysis of whether RFRA is a constitutional exercise of Congress'
S5 power, set forth in Part III-B of its opinion, is premised on the assumption
that Smith correctly interprets the Free Exercise Clause.  This is an assumption     _____
that I do not accept.  I continue to believe that Smith adopted an improper                                                  _____
standard for deciding free exercise claims.  In Smith, five Members                                                ______                                95-2074 - DISSENT

of this Court - without briefing or argument on the issue - interpreted the Free
Exercise Clause to permit the government to prohibit, without justification,
conduct mandated by an individual's religious beliefs, so long as the
prohibition is generally applicable.  Contrary to the Court's holding in that
case, however, the Free Exercise Clause is not simply an antidiscrimination
principle that protects only against those laws that single out religious
practice for unfavorable treatment.  See Smith, supra, at 892-903 (O'CONNOR, J.,                                         ______ ______
concurring in judgment).  Rather, the Clause is best understood as an
affirmative guarantee of the right to participate in religious practices and
conduct without impermissible governmental interference, even when such conduct
conflicts with a neutral, generally applicable law.  Before Smith, our free                                                            ______
exercise cases were generally in keeping with this idea: where a law
substantially burdened religiously motivated conduct - regardless whether it was
specifically targeted at religion or applied generally - we required government
to justify that law with a compelling state interest and to use means narrowly
tailored to achieve that interest.  See 494 U. S., at 894 (citing Hernandez v.                                                                  _________

  The historical evidence casts doubt on the Court's current interpretation of
the Free Exercise Clause.  The record instead reveals that its drafters and
ratifiers more likely viewed the Free Exercise Clause as a guarantee that
government may not unnecessarily hinder believers from freely practicing their
religion, a position consistent with our pre-Smith jurisprudence.                                             _____

  The original Constitution, drafted in 1787 and ratified by the States in 1788,
had no provisions safeguarding individual liberties, such as freedom of speech
or religion.  Federalists, the chief supporters of the new Constitution, took
the view that amending the Constitution to explicitly protect individual
freedoms was superfluous, since the rights that the amendments would protect
were already completely secure.  See, e.g., 1 Annals of Congress 440, 443-444,                                      _____
448-459 (Gales and Seaton ed. 1834) (remarks of James Madison, June 8, 1789). 
Moreover, they feared that guaranteeing certain civil liberties might backfire,
since the express mention of some freedoms might imply that others were not
protected.  According to Alexander Hamilton, a Bill of Rights would even be
dangerous, in that by specifying "various exceptions to powers" not granted, it
"would afford a colorable pretext to claim more than were granted."  The
Federalist No. 84, p. 513 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961).  Anti-Federalists, however,
insisted on more definite guarantees.  Apprehensive that the newly established
federal government would overwhelm the rights of States and individuals, they
wanted explicit assurances that the federal government had no power in matters
of personal liberty.  T. Curry, The First Freedoms: Church and State in America
to the Passage of the First Amendment 194 (1986).  Additionally, Baptists                                95-2074 - DISSENT

and other Protestant dissenters feared for their religious liberty under the new
Federal Government and called for an amendment guaranteeing religious freedom. 
Id., at 198.____
  In the end, legislators acceded to these demands.  By December 1791, the Bill
of Rights had been added to the Constitution.  With respect to religious
liberty, the First Amendment provided: "Congress shall make no law respecting an
establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof."  U. S.
Const., Amdt. 1.  Neither the First Congress nor the ratifying state
legislatures debated the question of religious freedom in much detail, nor did
they directly consider the scope of the First Amendment's free exercise
protection.  It would be disingenuous to say that the Framers neglected to
define precisely the scope of the Free Exercise Clause because the words "free
exercise" had a precise meaning.  L. Levy, Essays on American Constitutional
History 173 (1972).  As is the case for a number of the terms used in the Bill
of Rights, it is not exactly clear what the Framers thought the phrase
signified.  Ibid. ("[I]t is astonishing to discover that the debate on a Bill of            _____
Rights was conducted on a level of abstraction so vague as to convey the
impression that Americans of 1787-1788 had only the most nebulous conception of
the meanings of the particular rights they sought to insure").  But a variety of
sources supplement the legislative history and shed light on the original
understanding of the Free Exercise Clause.  These materials suggest that -
contrary to Smith - the Framers did not intend simply to prevent the Government            _____
from adopting laws that discriminated against religion.  Although the Framers
may not have asked precisely the questions about religious liberty that we do
today, the historical record indicates that they believed that the Constitution
affirmatively protects religious free exercise and that it limits the
government's ability to intrude on religious                                95-2074 - DISSENT

  The principle of religious "free exercise" and the notion that religious
liberty deserved legal protection were by no means new concepts in 1791, when
the Bill of Rights was ratified.  To the contrary, these principles were first
articulated in this country in the colonies of Maryland, Rhode Island,
Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Carolina, in the mid-1600's.  These colonies, though
established as sanctuaries for particular groups of religious dissenters,
extended freedom of religion to groups - although often limited to Christian
groups - beyond their own.  Thus, they encountered early on the conflicts that
may arise in a society made up of a plurality of faiths.
  The term "free exercise" appeared in an American legal document as early as
1648, when Lord Baltimore extracted from the new Protestant governor of Maryland
and his councilors a promise not to disturb Christians, particularly Roman
Catholics, in the "free exercise" of their religion.  McConnell, The Origins and
Historical Understanding of Free Exercise of Religion, 103 Harv. L. Rev. 1409,
1425 (1990) (hereinafter Origins of Free Exercise).  Soon after, in 1649, the
Maryland Assembly enacted the first free exercise clause by passing the Act
Concerning Religion: "[N]oe person . . . professing to beleive in Jesus Christ,
shall from henceforth bee any waies troubled, Molested or discountenanced for or
in respect of his or her religion nor in the free exercise thereof . . . nor any
way [be] compelled to the beleife or exercise of any other Religion against his
or her consent, soe as they be not unfaithfull to the Lord Proprietary, or
molest or conspire against the civill Governemt."  Act Concerning Religion of
1649, reprinted in 5 The Founders' Constitution 49, 50 (P. Kurland & R. Lerner
eds. 1987) (hereinafter Founders' Constitution).  Rhode Island's Charter of 1663
used the analogous term                                95-2074 - DISSENT

"liberty of conscience."  It protected residents from being "in any ways
molested, punished, disquieted, or called into question, for any differences in
opinion, in matters of religion, and do not actually disturb the civil peace of
our said colony."  The Charter further provided that residents may "freely, and
fully have and enjoy his and their own judgments, and conscience in matters of
religious concernments . . .; they behaving themselves peaceably and quietly and
not using this liberty to licentiousness and profaneness; nor to the civil
injury, or outward disturbance of others."  Charter of Rhode Island and
Providence Plantations, 1663, in 8 W. Swindler, Sources and Documents of United
States Constitutions 363 (1979).  Various agreements between prospective
settlers and the proprietors of Carolina, New York, and New Jersey similarly
guaranteed religious freedom, using language that paralleled that of the Rhode
Island Charter of 1663.  See New York Act Declaring Rights & Priviledges (1691);
Concession and Agreement of the Lords Proprietors of the Province of New
Caesarea, or New-Jersey (1664); Laws of West New-Jersey, Art. X (1681);
Fundamental Constitutions for East New-Jersey, Art. XVI (1683); First Charter of
Carolina, Art. XVIII (1663).  N. Cogan, The Complete Bill of Rights 23-27
(Galley 1997).
  These documents suggest that, early in our country's history, several colonies
acknowledged that freedom to pursue one's chosen religious beliefs was an
essential liberty.  Moreover, these colonies appeared to recognize that
government should interfere in religious matters only when necessary to protect
the civil peace or to prevent "licentiousness."  In other words, when religious
beliefs conflicted with civil law, religion prevailed unless important state
interests militated otherwise.  Such notions parallel the ideas expressed in our
pre-Smith cases - that government may not hinder believers from freely    _____
exercising their religion, unless necessary to                                95-2074 - DISSENT

further a significant state interest.
                                        C
  The principles expounded in these early charters re-emerged over a century
later in state constitutions that were adopted in the flurry of constitution-
drafting that followed the American Revolution.  By 1789, every State but
Connecticut had incorporated some version of a free exercise clause into its
constitution.  Origins of Free Exercise 1455.  These state provisions, which
were typically longer and more detailed than the federal Free Exercise Clause,
are perhaps the best evidence of the original understanding of the
Constitution's protection of religious liberty.  After all, it is reasonable to
think that the States that ratified the First Amendment assumed that the meaning
of the federal free exercise provision corresponded to that of their existing
state clauses.  The precise language of these state precursors to the Free
Exercise Clause varied, but most guaranteed free exercise of religion or liberty
of conscience, limited by particular, defined state interests.  For example, the
New York Constitution of 1777 provided:

   "[T]he free exercise and enjoyment of religious profession and worship,
   without discrimination or preference, shall forever hereafter be allowed,
   within this State, to all mankind: Provided, That the liberty of conscience,                                      _________
   hereby granted, shall not be so construed as to excuse acts of                   ______________________________________________

  In addition to these state provisions, the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 - which
was enacted contemporaneously with the drafting of the Constitution and re-
enacted by the First Congress - established a bill of rights for a territory
that included what is now Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin, and part of
Minnesota.  Article I of the Ordinance declared:

   "No person, demeaning himself in a peaceable and orderly manner, shall ever               ____________________________________________________
   be molested on account of his mode of worship or religious sentiments, in the

   1787, Art. I, 1 Stat. 52 (emphasis added).

  The language used in these state constitutional provisions and the Northwest
Ordinance strongly suggests that, around the time of the drafting of the Bill of
Rights, it was generally accepted that the right to "free exercise" required,
where possible, accommodation of religious practice.  If not - and if the Court
was correct in Smith that generally applicable laws are enforceable regardless               _____
of religious conscience - there would have been no need for these documents to
specify, as the New York Constitution did, that rights of conscience should not
be "construed as to excuse acts of licentiousness, or justify practices
inconsistent with the peace or safety of [the] State."  Such a proviso would
have been superfluous.  Instead, these documents make sense only if the right to
free exercise was viewed as generally superior to ordinary legislation, to be
overridden only when necessary to secure important government purposes.
  The Virginia Legislature may have debated the issue most fully.  In May 1776,
the Virginia Constitutional Convention wrote a constitution containing a
Declaration of Rights with a clause on religious liberty.  The initial drafter
of the clause, George Mason, proposed the following:

   "That religion, or the duty which we owe to our CREATOR, and the manner of
   discharging it, can be (directed) only by reason and conviction, not by force
   or violence; and therefore, that all men should enjoy the fullest toleration                               ________________________________________________
   in the exercise of religion, according to the dictates of conscience,   ____________________________

   And that it is the mutual duty of all to practice Christian forbearance,
   love, and charity towards each other."  Committee Draft of the Virginia

   of George Mason 284-285 (R. Rutland ed. 1970) (emphasis added).

  Mason's proposal did not go far enough for a 26-year-old James Madison, who
had recently completed his studies at the Presbyterian College of Princeton.  He
objected first to Mason's use of the term "toleration," contending that the word
implied that the right to practice one's religion was a governmental favor,
rather than an inalienable liberty.  Second, Madison thought Mason's proposal
countenanced too much state interference in religious matters, since the
"exercise of religion" would have yielded whenever it was deemed inimical to
"the peace, happiness, or safety of society."  Madison suggested the provision
read instead:

   "`That religion, or the duty we owe our Creator, and the manner of
   discharging it, being under the direction of reason and conviction only, not
   of violence or compulsion, all men are equally entitled to the full and free                              _________________________________________________
   exercise of it, according to the dictates of conscience; and therefore that   ________________________________________________________
   no man or class of men ought on account of religion to be invested with
   peculiar emoluments or privileges, nor subjected to any penalties or
   disabilities, unless under color of religion the preservation of equal                 ________________________________________________________
   liberty, and the existence of the State be manifestly endangered.'"  G.   ___________________________________________________________________                                                                     _
   Hunt, James Madison and Religious Liberty, 1 Annual Report of the American
   Historical Association 163, 166-167 (1901) (emphasis added).

  Thus, Madison wished to shift Mason's language of "toleration" to the language
of rights.  See S. Cobb, The Rise of Religious Liberty in America 492 (1902)
(reprint 1970) (noting that Madison objected to the word "toleration" as
belonging to "a system where was an established Church, and where a certain
liberty of worship was granted, not of right, but of grace").  Additionally,                                95-2074 - DISSENT

under Madison's proposal, the State could interfere in a believer's religious
exercise only if the State would otherwise "be manifestly endangered."  In the
end, neither Mason's nor Madison's language regarding the extent to which state
interests could limit religious exercise made it into the Virginia
Constitution's religious liberty clause.  Like the federal Free Exercise Clause,
the Virginia religious liberty clause was simply silent on the subject,
providing only that "all men are equally entitled to the free exercise of
religion, according to the dictates of conscience."  Virginia Declaration of
Rights, Art. XVI (1776), in 10 Swindler, Sources and Documents of United States
Constitutions, at 50.  For our purposes, however, it is telling that both                                                                     ____
Mason's and Madison's formulations envisioned that, when there was a conflict, a
person's interest in freely practicing his religion was to be balanced against
state interests.  Although Madison endorsed a more limited state interest
exception than did Mason, the debate would have been irrelevant if either had
thought the right to free exercise did not include a right to be exempt from
certain generally applicable laws.  Presumably, the Virginia Legislature
intended the scope of its free exercise provision to strike some middle ground
between Mason's narrower and Madison's broader notions of the right to religious
freedom.

  The practice of the colonies and early States bears out the conclusion that,
at the time the Bill of Rights was ratified, it was accepted that government
should, when possible, accommodate religious practice.  Unsurprisingly, of
course, even in the American colonies inhabited by people of religious
persuasions, religious conscience and civil law rarely conflicted.  Most 17th
and 18th century Americans belonged to denominations of Protestant Christianity
whose religious practices were generally                                95-2074 - DISSENT

harmonious with colonial law.  Curry, The First Freedoms, at 219 ("The vast
majority of Americans assumed that theirs was a Christian, i.e. Protestant,
country, and they automatically expected that government would uphold the
commonly agreed on Protestant ethos and morality").  Moreover, governments then
were far smaller and less intrusive than they are today, which made conflict
between civil law and religion unusual.
  Nevertheless, tension between religious conscience and generally applicable
laws, though rare, was not unknown in pre-Constitutional America.  Most
commonly, such conflicts arose from oath requirements, military conscription,
and religious assessments.  Origins of Free Exercise 1466.  The ways in which
these conflicts were resolved suggest that Americans in the colonies and early
States thought that, if an individual's religious scruples prevented him from
complying with a generally applicable law, the government should, if possible,
excuse the person from the law's coverage.  For example, Quakers and certain
other Protestant sects refused on Biblical grounds to subscribe to oaths or
"swear" allegiance to civil authority.  A. Adams & C. Emmerich, A Nation
Dedicated to Religious Liberty: The Constitutional Heritage of the Religion
Clauses 14 (1990) (hereinafter Adams & Emmerich).  Without accommodation, their
beliefs would have prevented them from participating in civic activities
involving oaths, including testifying in court.  Colonial governments created
alternatives to the oath requirement for these individuals.  In early decisions,
for example, the Carolina proprietors applied the religious liberty provision of
the Carolina Charter of 1665 to permit Quakers to enter pledges in a book. 
Curry, The First Freedoms, at 56.  Similarly, in 1691, New York enacted a law
allowing Quakers to testify by affirmation, and in 1734, it permitted Quakers to
qualify to vote by affirmation.  Id., at 64.  By 1789, virtually all of the                                 ____

oath exemptions.  See Adams & Emmerich 62.
  Early conflicts between religious beliefs and generally applicable laws also
occurred because of military conscription requirements.  Quakers and Mennonites,
as well as a few smaller denominations, refused on religious grounds to carry
arms.  Members of these denominations asserted that liberty of conscience should
exempt them from military conscription.  Obviously, excusing such objectors from
military service had a high public cost, given the importance of the military to
the defense of society.  Nevertheless, Rhode Island, North Carolina, and
Maryland exempted Quakers from military service in the late 1600's.  New York,
Massachusetts, Virginia, and New Hampshire followed suit in the mid-1700's. 
Origins of Free Exercise 1468.  The Continental Congress likewise granted
exemption from conscription:

   "As there are some people, who, from religious principles, cannot bear arms
   in any case, this Congress intend no violence to their consciences, but
   earnestly recommend it to them, to contribute liberally in this time of
   universal calamity, to the relief of their distressed brethren in the several
   colonies, and to do all other services to their oppressed Country, which they
   can consistently with their religious principles."  Resolution of July 18,
   1775, reprinted in 2 Journals of the Continental Congress, 1774-1789, pp.
   187, 189 (W. Ford ed. 1905).

Again, this practice of excusing religious pacifists from military service
demonstrates that, long before the First Amendment was ratified, legislative
accommodations were a common response to conflicts between religious practice
and civil obligation.  Notably, the Continental Congress exempted objectors from
conscription to avoid "violence to their consciences," explicitly recognizing
that civil laws must sometimes give way to freedom of                                95-2074 - DISSENT

  States and colonies with established churches encountered a further religious
accommodation problem.  Typically, these governments required citizens to pay
tithes to support either the government-established church or the church to
which the tithepayer belonged.  But Baptists and Quakers, as well as others,
opposed all government-compelled tithes on religious grounds.  Id., at 1469.                                                                ____
Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Hampshire, and Virginia responded by exempting
such objectors from religious assessments.  Ibid.  There are additional examples                                            _____
of early conflicts between civil laws and religious practice that were similarly
settled through accommodation of religious exercise.  Both North Carolina and
Maryland excused Quakers from the requirement of removing their hats in court;
Rhode Island exempted Jews from the requirements of the state marriage laws; and
Georgia allowed groups of European immigrants to organize whole towns according
to their own faith.  Id., at 1471.                     ____
  To be sure, legislatures, not courts, granted these early accommodations.  But
these were the days before there was a Constitution to protect civil liberties -                                 ____
judicial review did not yet exist.  These legislatures apparently believed that
the appropriate response to conflicts between civil law and religious scruples
was, where possible, accommodation of religious conduct.  It is reasonable to
presume that the drafters and ratifiers of the First Amendment - many of whom
served in state legislatures - assumed courts would apply the Free Exercise
Clause similarly, so that religious liberty was safeguarded.

thoughts of James Madison - one of the principal architects of the Bill of
Rights - as revealed by the controversy surrounding Virginia's General
Assessment Bill of 1784, are particularly illuminating.  Virginia's debate over
religious issues did not end with its adoption of a constitutional free exercise
provision.  Although Virginia had disestablished the Church of England in 1776,
it left open the question whether religion might be supported on a
nonpreferential basis by a so-called "general assessment."  Levy, Essays on
American Constitutional History, at 200.  In the years between 1776 and 1784,
the issue how to support religion in Virginia - either by general assessment or
voluntarily - was widely debated.  Curry, The First Freedoms, at 136.
  By 1784, supporters of a general assessment, led by Patrick Henry, had gained
a slight majority in the Virginia Assembly.  M. Malbin, Religion and Politics:
The Intentions of the Authors of the First Amendment 23 (1978); Levy, supra, at                                                                      ______

Christian Religion," which proposed that citizens be taxed in order to support
the Christian denomination of their choice, with those taxes not designated for
any specific denomination to go to a public fund to aid seminaries.  Levy,

  The "Memorial and Remonstrance" begins with the recognition that "[t]he
Religion . . . of every man must be left to the conviction and conscience of
every man; and it is the right of every man to exercise it as these may
dictate."  2 Writings of James Madison 184 (G. Hunt ed. 1901).  By its very
nature, Madison wrote, the right to free exercise is "unalienable," both because
a person's opinion "cannot follow the dictates of other[s]," and because it
entails "a duty toward the Creator."  Ibid.  Madison continued:                                      ____

   "This duty [owed the Creator] is precedent both in order of time and degree
   of obligation, to the claims of Civil Society. . . . [E]very man who becomes
   a member of any Civil Society, [must] do it with a saving of his allegiance
   to the Universal Sovereign.  We maintain therefore that in matters of
   Religion, no man's right is abridged by the institution of Civil Society, and
   that Religion is wholly exempt from its cognizance."  Id., at 184-185.                                                         ____

  To Madison, then, duties to God were superior to duties to civil authorities -
the ultimate loyalty was owed to God above all.  Madison did not say that duties
to the Creator are precedent only to those laws specifically directed at
religion, nor did he strive simply to prevent deliberate acts of persecution or
discrimination.  The idea that civil obligations are subordinate to religious
duty is consonant with the notion that government must accommodate, where
possible, those religious practices that conflict with civil law.
  Other early leaders expressed similar views regarding religious liberty. 
Thomas Jefferson, the drafter of Virginia's Bill for Establishing Religious
Freedom, wrote in that document that civil government could interfere in
religious exercise only "when principles break out into overt acts against peace
and good order."  In 1808, he                                95-2074 - DISSENT

indicated that he considered "`the government of the United States as
interdicted by the Constitution from intermeddling with religious institutions,
their doctrines, discipline, or exercises.'"  11 The Writings of Thomas
Jefferson 428-429 (A. Lipscomb ed. 1904) (quoted in Office of Legal Policy,
U. S. Dept. of Justice, Report to the Attorney General, Religious Liberty under
the Free Exercise Clause 7 (1986)).  Moreover, Jefferson believed that
"`[e]very religious society has a right to determine for itself the time of
these exercises, and the objects proper for them, according to their own
particular tenets; and this right can never be safer than in their own hands,
where the Constitution has deposited it.'"  Ibid.                                            _____
  George Washington expressly stated that he believed that government should do
its utmost to accommodate religious scruples, writing in a letter to a group of
Quakers:

   "[I]n my opinion the conscientious scruples of all men should be treated with
   great delicacy and tenderness; and it is my wish and desire, that the laws
   may always be as extensively accommodated to them, as a due regard to the
   protection and essential interests of the nation may justify and permit." 
   Letter from George Washington to the Religious Society Called Quakers (Oct.
   1789), in George Washington on Religious Liberty and Mutual Understanding 11
   (E. Humphrey ed. 1932).

Oliver Ellsworth, a Framer of the First Amendment and later Chief Justice of the
United States, expressed the similar view that government could interfere in
religious matters only when necessary "to prohibit and punish gross immoralities
and impieties; because the open practice of these is of evil example and detri-
ment."  Oliver Ellsworth, Landholder, No. 7 (Dec. 17, 1787), reprinted in 4

Backus, a Baptist minister who was a delegate to the Massachusetts ratifying
convention of 1788, declared that "`every person has an unalienable right to

where others are not injured thereby.'"  Backus, A Declaration of Rights, of
the Inhabitants of the State of Massachusetts-Bay, in Isaac Backus on Church,
State, and Calvinism 487 (W. McLoughlin ed. 1968).
  These are but a few examples of various perspectives regarding the proper
relationship between church and government that existed during the time the
First Amendment was drafted and ratified.  Obviously, since these thinkers
approached the issue of religious freedom somewhat differently, see Adams &
Emmerich 21-31, it is not possible to distill their thoughts into one tidy
formula.  Nevertheless, a few general principles may be discerned.  Foremost,
these early leaders accorded religious exercise a special constitutional status. 
The right to free exercise was a substantive guarantee of individual liberty, no
less important than the right to free speech or the right to just compensation
for the taking of property.  See P. Kauper, Religion and the Constitution 17
(1964) ("[O]ur whole constitutional history . . . supports the conclusion that
religious liberty is an independent liberty, that its recognition may either
require or permit preferential treatment on religious grounds in some instances
. . . ").  As Madison put it in the concluding argument of his "Memorial and
Remonstrance":

   "`[T]he equal right of every citizen to the free exercise of his Religion
   according to the dictates of [his] conscience' is held by the same tenure

  Second, all agreed that government interference in religious practice was not
to be lightly countenanced.  Adams & Emmerich at 31.  Finally, all shared the
conviction that "`true religion and good morals are the only solid foundation
of public liberty and happiness.'"  Curry, The First Freedoms, at 219 (quoting
Continental Congress); see Adams & Emmerich at 72 ("The Founders . . .
acknowledged that the republic rested largely on moral principles derived from
religion").  To give meaning to these ideas - particularly in a society
characterized by religious pluralism and pervasive regulation - there will be
times when the Constitution requires government to accommodate the needs of
those citizens whose religious practices conflict with generally applicable law.
                                       III
  The Religion Clauses of the Constitution represent a profound commitment to
religious liberty.  Our Nation's Founders conceived of a Republic receptive to
voluntary religious expression, not of a secular society in which religious
expression is tolerated only when it does not conflict with a generally
applicable law.  As the historical sources discussed above show, the Free
Exercise Clause is properly understood as an affirmative guarantee of the right
to participate in religious activities without impermissible governmental
interference, even where a believer's conduct is in tension with a law of
general application.  Certainly, it is in no way anomalous to accord heightened
protection to a right identified in the text of the First Amendment.  For
example, it has long been the Court's position that freedom of speech - a right
enumerated only a few words after the right to free exercise - has special
constitutional status.  Given the centrality of freedom of speech and religion
to the American concept of personal liberty, it is altogether                                95-2074 - DISSENT

reasonable to conclude that both should be treated with the highest degree of
respect.
  Although it may provide a bright line, the rule the Court declared in Smith                                                                        _____
does not faithfully serve the purpose of the Constitution.  Accordingly, I
believe that it is essential for the Court to reconsider its holding in Smith -                                                                        _____
and to do so in this very case.  I would therefore direct the parties to brief
this issue and set the case for reargument.
  I respectfully dissent from the Court's disposition of this case.
