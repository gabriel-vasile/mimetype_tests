I have reached the goal of starting a family because of this business idea.  My next goal will allow my wife to stay at home with our children, which we do not yet have.  This opportunity has also brought me closer to my parents than I would be otherwise.  My parents, now Platinums, registered me.  I have also worked really close with them and Emerald Ed Libich, being my references so to speak, to get my business going.  We are open to give all information and answer all questions to the best of our ability.  If we are unable to answer them Diamonds Bill and Jann Newton are always willing to help with a simple phone call.  We are sure to inform all prospects this is a 2-5 year plan if you do what is required and compare it to a 40-50 year plan.  We also point out not everyone is made to be a business person and therefore we as well as others will be with them all the way to assist in any way and there are tools to help educate them about the business on different topics should they need more information.  We make sure to inform all prospects there is a $45 registration fee which is a yearly renewal fee plus tax.  We also inform them of certain options they have to purchase monthly tools that help them to build a stronger business and/or a startup pack introducing them to daily products such as vitamins, washing detergents, cleaning supplies, etc.  This totals $125 plus tax if all options are chosen. 
I believe some of the rules are stringent.  We work with a team of IBOs and the prospect, if interested, will meet many more IBOs who are working the same concept.  Upon registration, a new IBO will receive numbers of Diamonds, Emeralds, Platinums, and sponsor in their upline.  Many IBOs also give business cards when they meet a new IBO.  Therefore, I feel it is unnecessary to have requirements to give references.  A seven day waiting period can delay someones growth in business tremendously.  The main reason being we must have an IBOs number to allow more prospects to join their team.  We must also have a prospect registered in order for them to get the full benefit of starting their business off on the right foot, allowing them to place orders and get the information to show others this opportunity and earn the money they desire in the amount of time they want.  A litigation list could be helpful but specific to the certain organization the IBO is involved with and containing only a team from Diamond, Emerald, Platinum to Sponsor.  This would show there is nothing to hide and reduce unneeded information to overwhelm the prospect.  We use a general on the average example to show disclosures for money.  We explain how much is spent monthly on average, $300, and show on average how much is given in rebates based on percentages from 3%-25% and explain there are bonuses given at different times and the income potential has no cap.  If the prospect wishes to know certain bonuses we will explain these to them.  We also start out explaining the process by sharing why I registered, what goals I had and how I have achieved or plan to achieve some goals, and benefits this business opportunity has such as being 100% willable and being a worldwide business.  I feel financial information is private information and should be shared only when an IBO feels comfortable sharing that information.  An IBO sharing financial information with a new prospect could turn the prospect away because they may not be willing to share their financial information with someone else.  
Thank you for your consideration and willingness to make business better for everyone.  I hope this information is helpful.</body></html>
