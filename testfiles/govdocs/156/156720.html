           STUDENTS WERE KILLED, 12 WERE KILLED THAT DAY AND A SCORE OR

           STARTED MY REMARKS. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT ONE OF THE

           THAT COUNTRIES THAT WE DEAL WITH WHO ARE HAVING SEVERE ECONOMIC
           PROBLEMS, WHERE WE SEE STARVING POPULATIONS, WHERE WE SEE

           MR. LOTT: -- THE DEBATE NOW, POST-KILO KHUREES HAS TO BE ON THE
           AFRICAN TRADE BILL. AFTER THAT VOTE OCCURS, WE WOULD GO TO THE

           SENATORS THAT WOULD WISH TO SPEAK ON THIS SUBITL WILL WANT TO
